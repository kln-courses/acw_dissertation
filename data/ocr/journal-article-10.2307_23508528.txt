<plain_text><page sequence="1">Is There A Doctrine of "Collective Retribution" in The Hebrew Bible? JOZE KRASOVEC University of Ljubljana — Institute of Biblical Studies, Slovenia The passages of Exod 20:5-6 (= Deut 5:9-10), 34:6—7, Num 14:18, Deut 7:g-10, and Jer 32:18 are similar in their basic antithetical structure and con stituent parts. Their fundamental similarity and characteristic participial style provide sufficient evidence to show that we have here a more or less fixed credo formula summarizing a generally valid understanding of God's attitude toward Israel. Because it comprehends two opposed aspects of the divine activity, it rep resents both promise and threat, emphasis being laid on the one or the other in accordance with particular circumstances. After all attempts to explain the threat of punishment have been exhausted, the only possible conclusion is that it reflects a feeling that ancestral guilt is inheritable. Other biblical passages dealing with collective retribution make clear that collective punishment is of relative character. On the one hand, God makes use of it only in special circum stances. On the other hand, human institutions are not allowed to practice it. Consequently, general statements of collective divine punishment should not be regarded as a doctrine or principle, but as an anthropomorphous expression of the fact that operation of natural law implies collective or inherited punish ment. The point is that children are victims of "natural" consequences of their father's guilt. The general imprecision of attempts to define "collectivism" and "indi vidualism"— and the equally uncertain term "doctrine" — in relation to punishment or retribution makes any examination of the complex ques tion of "collective retribution" difficult all the more. We shall start, there fore, with a brief clarification of the key terms used in this study: the adjective "collective" with its synonyms and antonyms, the concept of "doc trine," and possible applications of "retribution." The use of the terms "collective" must reflect the structure and role of society in ancient Israel. Provided the general characteristics of that soci ety are adequately defined, the nature and function of the "community," the "clan" or "family," and the "self" or "individual" as reflected in the He brew Bible can be properly determined.1 There are many different views (1) For the background and the relationship between these terms, see especially: J. de Fraine, "Individu et société dans la religion de l'Ancien Testament," Biblica 33(1952) 35</page><page sequence="2">36 JOZE KRASOVEC [2] regarding "collecdvism" and "individualism" in ancient Israel. It remains incontestable, however, that the Hebrew understanding of any type of community, on the one hand, and the role of the individual, on the other, could never deteriorate into "collective determinism" or "autonomous in dividualism," as is often the case in the Enlightenment and emancipative types of society, for the Israel of history was animated by profound senti ments of responsibility and solidarity within the community. Walther Eichrodt responds to the challenge of philosophical idealism in its hand ling of concepts of "collectivism" and "individualism" thus: "Instead of em ploying such conceptual categories it is better to keep firmly in mind the striking fundamental characteristic of all forms of community in the an cient world, and in particular of those of Israel, namely the strength of their sense of solidarity — a sense which adjusts itself in a variety of ways to changes in the shape of society, but is always the essential determinant of its distinctive quality."2 It is generally recognized that the documents of the Hebrew Bible im ply a progression in the role and value of the individual and some strengthening of individuality within the various types of Israelite society. In the pre-monarchy period, Israel shared the clan or tribe-centered com munity sense characteristic of a nomadic way of life. The clan is founded on a close spiritual and psychic association of individual and community. It seems that the tribes' view of the Covenant was based not only on their particular concept of God but also on genealogical relationship. After the settlement in Canaan this sense of solidarity was transferred from the clan to the local communities, on the one hand, and to the immediate family, on the other. It is taken for granted that the underlying sense of solidarity within a clan or a family, or even within a local community, implies an idea of collective divine retribution.3 But "a permanent organic connection 324-55י75_445 ' F.

The more God was perceived as the One and transcendent, the more the whole existence of the nation was seen to depend on the divine will, and the individual ap preciated for his distinctive personal quality and capacity for decision. The divine demand for repentance proclaimed by classical prophets to the na tion as a whole was decisive in finally transcending the confrontation of "collectivism" and "individualism." The supremacy of Israel's monotheism over all forms of pantheism and polytheism brought about a strengthening of sacred unity between various forms of Israelite society (the community) and between that society and the individual. It is justifiable to claim: "For Israel's sages, God alone en dures, while the things of this world pass away, acquiring individuality only as instruments of God's purposes. Only idol-worshipers place their trust in mere things. . . . The meaning and value of individuality depends on its source: creator or creature."5 Since the goal of creation and of God's deal ings with the world is completion of that creation, it follows that "a whole cannot be itself or function as it should unless each part is fully itself within the whole. Thus the whole depends upon its parts, each of which contributes a unique and indispensable function to the whole. The part, in turn, can realize its unique identity and fulfill its functional potential only within the whole of which it is a part and outside of which it is devoid of meaning. Therefore each part depends upon the whole to define itself and become actualized as uniquely meaningful and valuable. The unique ness of the part and the completeness of the whole are reciprocal values that can be actualized only in and through their inherent mutuality. Thus, for example, unique personal individuality and total corporate solida tive dans la religion." See also Plutarch (c. 46-120 A.D.) on solidarity within a city, presented in his On the Delays of the Divine Vengeance {De Sera Numinis Vindicta) (559a 1-eg) ; translation by Ph. H. de Lacy and B. Einarson, Plutarch's Moralia VII (LCL 405; Cambridge, Mass./Lon don: Harvard University Press/W. Heinemann) 245: "A city, like a living thing, is a united and continuous whole. This does not cease to be itself as it changes in growing older, nor does it become one thing after another with the lapse of time, but is always at one with its former self in feeling and identity, and must take all blame or credit for what it does or has done in its public character, so long as the association that creates it and binds it together with interwoven strands preserves it as a unity."

Ochs, "Individuality," Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, 482.</page><page sequence="4">38 JOZE KRASOVEC [4] rity — both Judaic emphases — are not contradictory, but complementary aspects of unity."6 The relationship between God and creation makes the distinction be tween divine and human retribution crucial. And when divine retribution comes into play, it is important to determine whether it (or of course rec ompense) is direct or indirect. The distinctions are vital in cases of collec tive divine retribution, for God may rule the world not only according to general principles, but also according to the exigencies of special circum stances and reasons that are beyond human grasp or fitness to employ. In either situation God may execute retribution by direct intervention or by permitting human deeds to produce their appropriate fruits, which may then be considered as punishment or reward. It follows that use of the term "doctrine" in relation to collective retribution must be subject to scrutiny. Etiological explanations of tragic historical events dependent on the guilt of ancestors, or execution of collective retribution for singular reasons, cannot be dignified by the term "doctrine." A classic example of etiological interpretation is provided by the lamentations of Mursilis, the Hittite king (c. 1340—1310 B.C.E).7 Stricken by a national plague that lasted for twenty years, the king asks whether this is a punishment inflicted by the Storm-god, because the Hattians have violated an agreement made be tween them and the Egyptians during the reign of his father Suppiluliuma (c. 1375—1340). It is important to note that the prayers of Mursilis do not imply a divine statement about collective retribution, but amount only to a surmise by the king that the crisis might betoken an inherited punish ment. Since the king is uncertain, he begs: "... let those that are still able to give sacrificial loaves and libations die no longer! If, on the other hand, people are dying for some other reason, either let me see it in a dream, or let it be found out by an oracle, or leta prophet declare it, or let all the priests find out by incubation whatever I suggest to them. . . . For whatever reason people are dying, let that be found out!. . ."8 Such docu ments cannot be considered witnesses to "doctrines" of causality in the sense of collective retribution or inherited punishment.9 In the Hebrew Bible there are a number of passages showing that divine (6) See Ch. E. Vernoff, "Unity," Contemporary Jewish Religious Thought, 102g. (7) See the translation by A. Gôtze, "Die I'estgebete des Mursilis," KAF 1(1929)204-35; idem,idem, "Plague Prayers of Mursilis," ANE T, 394—96. (8) See a.11; translation by A. Gôtze, "Plague Prayers of Mursilis," ANET, 3g6.

Malamat deals with these prayers and the similar case reported in 2 Sam 21:1-14 under the inappropriate title, "Doctrines of Causality in Hittite and Biblical Historiography: A Parallel," VT 5 (1955) 1-12. It is true that Mursilis at one point refers to in herited punishment: "It is only too true that man is sinful. My father sinned and trans</page><page sequence="5">[5] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW bible 39 collective retribution was not dictated by a doctrine or a principle but by special circumstances. Against that, others reflect a crude desire for vengeance and a belief or feeling that ancestral guilt is inheritable. It be comes all the more urgent to consider the question of how to interpret the famous retribution formula that occurs several times in various forms : Exod 20:5—6 (=Deut 5:9—10); 34:6—7; Num 14:18; Deut 7:9—10; and Jer 32:18. These passages are somewhat problematic from both the lin guistic and theological points of view, and are in consequence variously translated and interpreted.10 Since the formula leaves the impression that it may reflect a doctrine of collective retribution, many exegetes try to avoid the conclusion that it has anything to do with collective retribution. It is therefore necessary that it should be assessed as much in light of its linguistic and literary structure in each occurrence as in relation to other cases that concern collective retribution, taking into account the immedi ate or broader context in every case. The following questions are of cardinal importance in dealing with pas sages concerned with collective retribution and that imply an idea of com munal responsibility or suggest other grounds for its justification or a feeling of the inheritability of ancestral guilt: how far do historical and ideological setting determine the meaning of individual passages? Where are the boundaries between their literal and metaphorical or symbolical literary meanings? How are individual and collective retribution related to each other? Is there any ground in the Hebrew Bible for treating exam pies of "collective retribution" as expressions of doctrine or principle? 1. 1. The Structure and Semantics of the "Collective Retribution" Formula The passages cited above are similar in their basic antithetical structure and constituent parts. Nevertheless, there are certain significant diffe rences that divide them into two groups: 1) Exod 34:6—7; Num 14:18; Jer 32:18; and 2) Exod 20:5—6 (=Deut 5:9—10); Deut 7:9—10. The first gressed against the word of the Hattian Storm-god, my lord. But I have not sinned in any re spect. It is only too true, however, that the father's sin falls upon the son. So, my father's sin has fallen upon me" (see a.9 ; translation by A. Gôtze, "Plague Prayers of Mursilis," ANET, 395). We have no proof that this statement expresses more than the view of the king. More over, that view does not reveal how inherited punishment is suposed to be exercised: whether directly by the will of the gods or indirectly by the operation of natural law. (10) This fact is particularly clearly indicated by J. Scharbert, "Formgeschichte und Ex egese von Ex 34,6f und seiner Parallelen," Biblica 38(1957)130-50, and M. Weiss, "Some Problems of the Biblical 'Doctrine of Retribution,' " Tarbiz 32 (1962-63) 1-18 + I-I I.</page><page sequence="6">4-0 JOZE KRASOVEC [6] group appears to be older than the second," although the development of the passages into their present form has not been convincingly estab lished. This makes it even more necessary to take into account their pre sent structure, their role within context, and their semantics. The following are questions of special interest: What sort of relationship exists between divine steadfast love, retribution, and forgiveness? What are the reasons or conditions that bring one or the other into play? a. exod 34:6—7 The book of Exodus may be divided into three major parts, following the narrative sequence: Israel in Egypt (1:1—13:16); Israel in the Wilder ness (13:17-18:27); Israel at Sinai (19:1—40:38). The statement of retribu tion reported in 34:6—7 appears within the composite literary structure of section 32:1—34:35, which deals with Israel's violation of the Covenant by the apostasy to the golden bull-calf and the restoration of the Covenant through intercessory mediation by Moses.12 Since the section is a compila tion of J, E, and several editorial elements, it is difficult to establish the date of the solemn statement in 34:6-7 with any certainty, but it seems to present a very ancient summary of divine characteristics in the form of a professional formula.13 All the more is it appropriate to acknowledge the function of the formula within the section as a whole: it marks the turning-point in the greatest crisis of the Covenant relationship between God and Israel. God is present to lead again the people of Israel despite their act of idolatry and an earlier threat: "I will not go up among you, lest I consume you in the way, for you are a stiff-necked people" (33:3b); the formula announces, then, divine mercy and forgiveness. The theme of the section 34:1—28 is the renewal of the Covenant that (11) See J. Scharbert, Biblica 38(1957) 131-37. (12) For general questions about the book of Exodus and the section chs. 32-34, see especially A. H. McNeile, The Book of Exodus (WC; London: Methuen, 1908); G. Beer and K. Galling, Exodus (H AT 3; Tubingen : J. C. B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1939) ; R. E. Clements, Ex odusodus (CBC; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1972); B.S.Childs, Exodus: A Commen tarytary (OTL; London: SC.M Press, 1974); U. Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Exodus (Jerusalem: Magnes Press, Hebrew University, 1983); J. I. Durham, Exodus (WBC; Waco, Texas: Word Books, 1987). (13) See the statement by J. I. Durham, Exodus, 454: "In fact, we have no basis for certainty regarding the origin of these verses; they are certainly a part of a confession of faith about Yahweh, but probably of a very ancient one, far older than the Wisdom movement in any for mal sense and connected with Israel's oldest perception of Yahweh and his relationship to those he claimed as 'his own people'."

In the morning Moses makes his solitary ascent of Mount Sinai with the stone tablets. "And the Lord descended in the cloud and stood with him there, and proclaimed the name of the Lord" (34:5). Further on God uses the third person: "The Lord, the Lord, a God merciful and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness (wêrab hesed wëDèmet), keeping steadfast love for thousands {nôsër hesed làDâlàfim), forgiving iniquity and transgression and sin, but who will by no means clear the guilty, visiting {pôqëd){pôqëd) the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation (cal-sillësîm wë-al-ribbëcîm)" (vv. 6—7).5י The repetition of the divine name recalls its revelation in 3:14—15; self-unveiling of that name provides a very special knowledge of the nature of the Divine itself. The formula presents a confessional défini tion of God by referring to the divine nature and activity; it is thus of ex ceptional theological significance. The structure of the formula suggests clarification of some terms. First, we may point to the wide semantic range of the verb pâqad 'pay attention to, look after, take care of, muster, appoint, allot, assign, observe, investi gate, test, visit'; in the Niphcal stem it includes even the opposing aspect 'miss, lack.' The verb nàsar means 'watch, keep, guard.' Regarding the syn tax it is especially important to note that the formula employs — in all its manifestations — a participai predicate to denote the opposing divine characteristics, which does not function as a finite verb with a clear time or mood reference. "The participle active indicates a person or thing con ceived as being in the continual uninterrupted exercise of an activity.'"6 This syntactic form confirms the view that the retribution formula arises from an old Israelite hymnic liturgical tradition. In general, an abounding (14) For the origins of the section, see R. E.Clements, Exodus, 220: "Several features indi cate that the present narrative is basically from J, whereas the earlier covenant ceremony re ported in Exod. 19, 24 centres upon an account from E . .

Note that in the Pentateuch, God usually speaks of Himself in the first person. See J. Scharbert, BiblicaBiblicaBiblica 38(1957)131-32.Biblica 38(1957)131-32.

Deutero-Isaiah and Psalms). In this context the meaning of the divine quality of hesed 'steadfast love' must be taken into consideration. God's hesed designates a covenantal relationship toward faithful followers — the reciprocal rela tionship of God to the patriarchs, to David and his house, to his people, and to his community.17 The relationship between hesed and its synonyms shows that "God's hesed corresponds to the demands of loyalty, justice and rightousness and already contains these concepts. God's hesed and °emet are to be considered a hendiadys, in which Demet has the value of a descrip tive adjective."18 The other point of interest is the contradictory numerals with their appropriate prepositions (là) 3âlàfîm// /il-sillësîm wêcal-ribbêcîm (cf. Exod 20:5— 20:5—6 = Deut 5:9—10; Num 14:18; Jer 32:18). Whom do they denote? Most commentators take the indefinite plural form câlàfim to mean 'a thousand generations', so the majority of translations render the phrase nôsérnôsér hesed là :âlàfîm as 'keeping steadfast love for a thousand generations (or thousands of generations).'19 Consequently, they also see the equally indefinite numbers sillësîm and rebbêcîm in the parallel clause as désignât ing generations of descendants. The connecting sentence pôqëd câwôn =àbôt =àbôt =àbôt cal-bànîm wëcal-bënê bànîm cal-sillësîm wécal ribbêcîm is usually translated as follows: '. . . visiting the iniquity of the fathers upon the children and the children's children, to the third and the fourth generation.'20 Some re cent commentators emphasize the importance of solidarity within the tribe (clan), family, or nation, and think that the number ?âlàfîm denotes an indefinitely large number of living members of a community.21 Others apply the numbers sillësîm and ribbëcîm to living persons who are related more remotely to the link with the third and fourth generation.22 Such differences are not crucial from the theological point of view. Whatever one makes of numerals and prepositions, the passage remains a declaration of collective retribution or refers to inherited reward or pun ishment. The second section of the formula poses a difficult theological (17) See N. Glueck, Hesed in the Bible (translated by A.Gottschalk from the German; Cin cinnati, Ohio: Ktav Publishing House, 1975) 70-102: "Hesed as Divine Conduct." (18) See N.Glueck, op. cit. 102. (1g) See Targum Onkelos and Neophyti 1. But the Septuagint and Vulgate preserve the general form "thousands." (20) Here the Septuagint and the Vulgate agree. (21) See A. H. McNeile, The Book of Exodus, 117; S. R. Driver, A Critical and Exegetical Com mentarymentary on Deuteronomy (ICC; Edinburgh: T. &amp;T. Clark, 1895, 1973) 102.

The question prompted an attempt to seek other explanations of the significance of the numerals. It was suggested that they do not signify a doctrine of collective retribution over an unlim ited period of time, but are used as a superlative expressing divine reward and punishment in the most absolute sense.23 No matter how the numbers are interpreted, two clearly related facts are important for an understanding of the confessional definition of the Divine. First, the declaration is made in the context of divine reconcili ation with a people who have greatly sinned; and secondly, it is primarily a promulgation of divine benevolence, mercy, and forgiveness, and only sec ondarily of punishment for iniquity. God restores Israel to a relationship of grace after it has become aware of its rebellion, and this gesture is a res ponse to Moses' intercession in the previous chapter (33:12—23). In this context (33:19), we find an extraordinary disclosure of the divine true na ture: "I will make all my goodness pass before you, and will proclaim be fore you my name 'The Lord'; and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious, and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy (wéhannôtî Det 3âser3âser Dâhàn wêrïhamtî 3et^âser כârahëm)." That Moses was capable of assess ing the magnitude of the divine mercy is made clear in 34:8-9: "And Moses made haste to bow his head toward the earth, and worshipped. And he said, 'If now I have found favor in Thy sight, O Lord, let the Lord, I pray thee, go in the midst of us, although it is a stiff-necked people; and pardon (wêsàlahtà) our iniquity and our sin, and take us for Thy inheri tance.'" The terminology echoes God's command to Moses in 33:5: "Say to the people of Israel, 'You are a stiff-necked people; if for a single mo ment I should go up among you, I would consume you. So now put off your ornaments from you, that I may know what to do with you.'" What Moses could achieve with his humble intercession was reconciliation. "Moses asks for reconciliation, not forgiveness; for assurance that Israel will be brought to its land, not that the sin of the Exodus generation will be exonerated. Moses is quite content to invoke the dreaded doctrine of vertical retribution, provided that salah will also be dispensed, justice will (23) See M. Weiss, Tarbiz 32(1962-63) 1-18 + I-I I.

Roth and Zakovitch do not reach the same conclusion as Weiss.</page><page sequence="10">44 J°£e krasovec [10] be tempered by mercy, and God will continue as Israel's God and fulfill the promise of His covenant."24 The supremacy of divine mercy over the demands of punishment ap pears striking especially when we compare the biblical retribution formula with the statements of collective punishment contained in the Hittite in structions relating to the sacral law and to offenses against the king (14th and 13th centuries B.C.E.). We find there only a statement about collective punishment; mercy is out of the question. The whole context excludes any possibility of mercy in cases of greater transgressions. In instructions for temple officials we find a statement of collective retribution after a significant comparison between the human and the divine authority: Are the minds of men and of the gods generally different? No! With regard to the matter with which we are dealing? No! Their minds are exactly alike ... If a slave causes his master's anger, they will either kill him or they will injure him at his nose, his eyes (or) his ears; or [they will seize] him, his wife, his children, his brother, his sister, his in-laws, his kin whether it be a male slave or a slave-girl. They may (ei ther) impose the extreme penalty, (or) they may do to him nothing at all. If ever he is to die, he will not die alone; his kin will accompany him. If then, on the other hand, anyone arouses the anger of a god, does the god take revenge on him alone? Does he not take revenge on his wife, his children, his descendants, his kin, his slaves, and slave-girls, his cattle (and) sheep together with his crop and will utterly destroy him? Be very reverent indeed to the word of a god!25 The Hittite instructions contain several similar declarations of collective punishment. Consequently we may conclude that the instructions reflect general practice of collective punishment in the Hittite empire at that time. The instruction relating to the matter of fire in the temple, for ex ample, concludes: "... he who commits the crime will perish together with his descendants. Of those who are in the temple not one is to be spared, together with their descendants they shall perish. So for your own good be very careful in the matter of fire."26 (24) See J. Miigrom, "Vertical Retribution: Ruminations on Parashat Shealah" CJud 37 (1981)16. (25) See §§ 2-3; translation by A. Gôtze, "Instructions for Temple Officials," ANET, 207-208.

NUM 14: 18 The story of the spies (Num 13:1—14:45) occupies a central place in the wilderness itinerary; it is the first account of conflicting attitudes regard ing the conquest of the Promised Land. Martin Noth states: "This narra tive is presented in great detail. The reason for this is that several literary sources have been conflated and that these sources have then been ex panded by later additions."27 It seems that the narrative "in its present form is a blending of P, Old Epic (J E), and pre-P supplements of the Old Epic."28 To the P-version are attributed the folowing sections: 13:1—17a, 21, 25, 26, 32, 33; 14:1—3, 5—10, 26—38. The retribution formula appears within a J-section 14:11—25. It is noteworthy that a Deuteronomistic ver sion of the story of the spies is preserved in Deut 1:20-45 — without the retribution formula. Combination of various traditions is probably the main reason for some tensions in the text. The present composition of the story opens with God's command to Moses: "Send men to spy out the land of Canaan, which I give to the peo pie of Israel; from each tribe of their fathers shall you send a man, every one a leader among them" (13:2). The spies return to Paran at Kadesh and report on the strength of the inhabitants and their towns. The Is raelites are disheartened and express the desire to replace Moses with an other leader and to return to Egypt: "Let us choose a captain, and go back to Egypt" (14:4). The rebellion against the designated leader implies contempt for the divine promises and rejection of the whole covenant re lationship with God. Consequently, it cannot go unpunished; God de clares: "How long will this people despise me? And how long will they not believe in me, in spite of all the signs which I have wrought among them? I will strike them with the pestilence and disinherit them, and I will make of you a nation greater and mightier than they" (14:11—12; cf. Exod 32:9-10). Now Moses intercedes (14:13-19) in a way that calls to mind his intercession after the rebellion of the people at Sinai (Exod 32:11-14), at Taberah (Num 11:1-13), and the complaint of Miriam and Aaron against Moses (Num 12:1—16). The retribution formula reappears, then, at the crucial moment of Moses' intercession, which incorporates God's own words from Exod 34:6-7, in slightly shorter form: "And now, I pray Thee, let the power of the Lord be great as Thou has promised, saying, 'The (27) See Numbers: A Commentary (translated by J.D.Martin from the German: OTL: Lon don: SCM Press, 1968) tot.

It is noteworthy that the supremacy of mercy over reasons for punish ment is emphasized through the positive/negative sequence in God's way of dealing with the people, but hen; the striking "(keeping steadfast love) for thousands" is omitted, whereas the negative part of the retribution for mula retains the numerals three-four (generations). God yields to Moses' intercession and declares forgiveness: "I have pardoned (sàlahtî), accord ing to your word . .." (v. 20). In what follows, however, there is a foreshad owing of punishment for all who persist in rebellion : they will not see the Promised Land (vv. 21—23, 26—29). This ambiguous reply illuminates the antithetical nature of the retribution formula: God is above all a benevo lent and compassionate God, but cannot tolerate the stubborn resistance of "despisers." Ultimately, God deals with each according to his deeds. The faithful Caleb is separated from the rebels (vv. 24, 30) when the "despi sers" are condemned to death in the desert (vv. 23, 29). This fact is crucial in interpreting the purpose of Moses' intercession and the role of the retribution formula in this context. It may be con eluded that Moses' intention is not to save everyone — including even the rebels — but only the substance of the nation. The situation is very similar to that obtaining after the apostasy at Sinai. In both cases Moses' interces sion is based on the evidence that there was a "remnant" of the faithful, and his prayer implies that the people should be judged according to the principle of individual retribution. Collective retribution may be exercised only to a limited extent; "despisers" should not cause a judgment of obli teration to be passed upon the whole of Israel. In this critical situation, the declaration of God's nature, as expressed in the retribution formula with its clear reference to Exod 34:6—7, offers a good foundation for interces sion. Seen in retrospect, however, the whole story provides an explication of why "the people" were not completely destroyed in the wilderness.29 (2g) Cf. the appropriate interpretation by K. D. Sakenfeld, CBQ 37(1975)317-30. On p. 326 she states: "It is essential to recognize that the real content of God's forgiveness here is in the non-destruction of the people, in the very continuation of His relationship to the community as His community, in the decision not to create a new nation of Moses or of any one else and not to disinherit the presently constituted community of God. Yahweh's willing ness to maintain the covenant relationship is based solely in his great hesed, just as it has been from the time of the initiation of the relationship with the people in the Exodus."</page><page sequence="13">[13] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 47 C.JER 32:18 In Jeremiah, the retribution formula appears in the account of the pur chase of a field in Anatot (32:1-44), which clearly falls into three sections: God's command and the act of purchase (vv. 1—15); Jeremiah's prayer (vv. 16—25); ar|d God's response (vv. 26—44). seems that the account is not original to Jeremiah but to the Deuteronomic editor. The narrative was obviously written before the fall of Jerusalem. It is centered on a decla ration that amounts to a crucial proclamation of hope forjudah: "Houses and helds and vineyards shall again be bought in this land" (v. 15b) .3° The prayer of Jeremiah, uttered at the moment of giving the deed of purchase to Baruch, is composed in the style of hymns expressive of God's general characteristics (cf. the longer prayer in Jer 32:6—35). The aim of Jeremiah's prayer is to acknowledge that the judgment passed upon Israel is fully justified, which could mean that the fate of Jerusalem is sealed for ever. Sudden divine tidings of hope naturally astonished the prophet; "... What Thou didst speak has come to pass, and behold, Thou seest it. Yet Thou, O Lord God, hast said to me, 'Buy the field for money and get witnesses' — though the city is given into the hands of the Chaldeans" (vv. 24—25). But exactly here lies the key to the question of why the hym nic retribution formula, enshrining as it does the ambiguous character of God's dealings with the people, was included in the opening section of the prayer: "Ah Lord God! It is Thou who hast made the heavens and the earth by Thy great power and by Thy outstetched arm! Nothing is too hard for Thee, who showest steadfast love to thousands (côseh' hesedhesed laDâlàpîm),laDâlàpîm), but dost requite the guilt of fathers into the lap of their chil dren after them (ûmësallëm câwôn :àbôt כel-hêq bênêhem 2ahàrêhem), O great and mighty God whose name is the Lord of hosts, great in counsel and mighty in deed; whose eyes are open to all the ways of men, rewarding every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings (là tel (là tel (là tel Ifîs kidrâkâw wëkiprî macâlâlâwf (vv. 17—1g). The positive aspect of the retribution formula, "who showest steadfast love to thousands," linked to the phrase "Nothing is too hard for Thee," is crucial in the context of the prayer. It stands at the beginning, thus evoking the hope that, in the final analysis, God will act according to this principle. The function of the retribution formula in Jer 32 is obviously the same as its role in Exod 32—34 and Num 13-14, although there are differences (30) For more detailed discussion about the chapter in general, see especially: P. Volz, Der ProphetDer ProphetDer Prophet Jeremiah (KAT to; Leipzig: W Scholl, 1928) 302-10; J. Ph. Hyatt, The Book ofjere miahmiah (IB 5; Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon, 1956) 1042-48; W.

The most obvious of these is the use of the second person (Jer 32:18) rather than the third (Exod 34:6—7; Num: 18). And there are others: in Exod 34:7 we find the verbal link nôsër hesedhesed 'keeping steadfast love,' in Jer 32:18 coseh hesed 'showest steadfast love'; in Exod 34:7 and Num 14:18 we find pôqëd câwôn :abôt cal bànîm . . .

Isa 65:6b—7a). The conclusion in Jeremiah's version (v. 19) is important for an understanding of the retribu tion formula: "... rewarding every man according to his ways and ac cording to the fruit of his doings." The rest of the passage demonstrates that the retribution formula is based on a critical assessment of Israel's history and upon the mystery of its election. In vv. 20—25, Jeremiah asserts that Jerusalem's present misfor tune has to be understood as punishment for Israel's past infidelity: "... therefore Thou hast made all this evil come upon them" (v. 23). In vv. 26—35 God says the same thing: "For the sons of Israel and the sons of Judah have done nothing but evil in My sight from their youth . . ." (v. 30). In both passages it is made clear that the present generation is suffering for its own sins and those of its ancestors. The positive aspect of the retribution formula can provide God's prom ise for the future, because it constitutes a summary of divine promises and deeds arising out of divine benevolence in times past. This is true even though the somber state of Jeremiah's Israel may show otherwise: to the human eye it seemed as if only Israel's guilt and God's wrath could be dis cerned in either the horizon of the past or the landscape of the present. Nor, at that moment, was God prepared to abate the demand for faithful ness, and any bestowal of favor presupposes that the people change their ways. Because past experience gave no basis for the hope that Israel would reform of its own accord, God, in the response to Jeremiah's prayer, promises (in vv. 36—44) to give the chosen people "one heart and one way," that they may fear their Lord, and to make a lasting covenant with them and set them firmly in the land. The divine punishments and promises are summarized thus: "Just as I have brought all this great evil Cet Cet kol-hàràcàh haggédôlâh hazzôt) upon this people, so I will bring upon them all the good Cet~kol-hattôbàh) that I promise them" (v. 42). The sequence of the positive and negative aspects of the retribution for mula and of historical illustration is probably significant. In the retribu tion formula we have an attestation of benevolence/punishment; in the application, the opposite. The sequence can hardly be adequately ex plained in terms of the supposition of dependence derived from Exod</page><page sequence="15">[15] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 49 34:6—7 or Num 14:118, for the formula in Jeremiah is much rearranged. The key to understanding lies in the context, the whole of ch. 32, and its main burden is positive change. In the darkest hour Jeremiah receives a command to buy a field in Anatot, which is a token of divine good intent. In times of darkness God represents hope against hope, which ultimately means that God is in essence one who "shows steadfast love." It is possible to link all three passages with the question of why the posi five aspect of the formula is given pride of place. Everything indicates that similar situations produce a similar answer: the people have sinned and have shown certain signs of penitence. Both Moses and Jeremiah admit Is rael's guilt, and God then affirms anew a readiness to look upon them with favor and benevolence. D. EXOD 20:5-6 (= DEUT 5:9-10) These verses form part of the Decalogue (Exod 20:1—17; Deut 5:6—18), which is an integral part — the center and very heart — of the great Sinai narrative; the Exodus context of the Decalogue belongs to the E source. In order to discern the role of the retribution formula in this context it is necessary first to clarify the main characteristics of the Ten Command ments so far as location and form are concerned. The placing of the Decalogue within the Sinai narrative means that the commandments reflect the liberation from slavery in Egypt and God's covenant with Israel. They take the form of a personal divine address in the first person to the individual, for whom the second person singular is used. The I-Thou relationship is a very distinctive and highly significant feature of the Decalogue. Other notable points are the negative formula tion of the commandments in the form of prohibitives and the apodictic style of the unconditional "You shall," which contrasts with the customary casuistic forms of ancient Near Eastern legislation. These characteristics combine to provide the distinctive nature and role of the Decalogue: "The peculiarity of the Decalogue does not express itself in its contents, for almost all of the commandments are found in a similar form elsewhere in the Pentateuch. . . . What makes this collection of commandments pe culiar is its specific nature. It is a creed, a basic formal affirmation in the religion of Israel".31 In their original state, the Ten Commandments appear to have been shorter. An example of the later augmentation some of them underwent is found in the retribution formula in Exod 20:5b—6 (= Deut 5:9b—10).32 (31) See M. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy 1-11 (AB 5; New York: Doubleday, 1991) 245-46. (32) See J. Scharbert, Biblica 38(1957) 134.</page><page sequence="16">50 JOZE KRASOVEC [16] Attempts to establish the earlier development of the Decalogue have pro duced many hypotheses but few convincing conclusions,33 and we must therefore consider the place and meaning of the formula in the structure and role of the Decalogue as we now have it. The linkage with the revela tion on Sinai gives the Decalogue a historical context. It begins with the self-revelation of God as Redeemer: "I am the Lord your God, who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of bondage" (20:2; cf. 3:14; 6:2; Deut 5:6). Again, the experience of deliverance from Egypt provides a historical setting for the commandments and prohibitions of the Decalogue, particularly the prohibition against worshipping foreign gods (20:3-5). Herein lies the basis of the covenant. As sole Redeemer, God sets up a covenant with the Chosen People, demanding of them com plete faithfulness so that they may be saved from errors that can lead to their destruction.34 In this context, the retribution formula (20:5b—6) acquires its own justification and weight. It is causally linked with the preceding prohibi tion of the worship of foreign gods and is uttered by God in the first per son: "... for (kî) I the Lord your God am a jealous God {3el qanna3), visiting (pôqëd) the iniquity of the lathers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation of those who hate me (lësoné~&gt;ày), but showing steadfast love to thousands (côseh hesed laDalàfîm) of those who love me and keep my commandments (VPôhâbay ûlésomrê miswôtây)." In vv. 3—5a, God prohibits with special emphasis the making and worshipping of "other gods", and it therefore stands to reason that the reference to 3el qannd3 a "jealous God" — should precede the pronouncement of the retribution for mula; this innovation explains why the formula starts with the threat of punishment instead of the assuranct: of God's steadfast love. Unfortunately the text is not as clear as may seem at first glance. In con trast to Exod 34:6-7, Num 14:18, andjer 32:18, we find here at the end of the first half of the formula lésônë3ày and at the end of the second lë36hâbay ûlésomrêûlésomrê miswôtây. It is these additions that give rise to an insoluble Unguis tic problem, and a correct interpretation of the meaning of this formula actually depends more on a general understanding of collective versus in (33) See B. S. Childs, Exodus, 391-93: "Traditio-History of the Decalogue." See, however, the conclusions by R.E.Clements, Exodus, 122: "... we should date the Decalogue earlier rather than later, and almost certainly before the introduction of the monarchy at the end of the eleventh century B.C and by J. I. Durham, Exodus, 282: "Any establishment of a pre cise date for the origin of the Ten Commandments, or for that matter their successive expan sion into the form in which we know them is of course impossible — but we can now be confident of an earlier rather than a later dating."

A translation alone does not indicate clearly enough in which of these two senses the translator views the text. Lamed before sônëJây and :&gt;ôhâbay is usually understood as a genitive relating to the fathers: in the sense of collective retribution, God will visit their iniquity upon the children of those fathers who hate their Lord, and demonstrate benevolence to thousands of those fathers who love their God and keep the divine commandments.35 Some exegetes con sider a collective interpretation too problematic, and propose other solu tions. Mention should be made of the suggestion that lamed should be taken to mean "with regard to, in relation to." In that case the formula would imply individual retribution: God will visit the iniquity of the fa thers upon the children to the third and the fourth generation in relation to those who hate their Lord, and show steadfast love to the thousandth generation of those who love their Creator.36 The most convincing view seems to be that lamed before s one''ay and ''ôhâbay''ôhâbay denotes a dative in relation to "I . . . God." So the translation quoted above should be somewhat modified to read: "... for I, the Lord your God, am a jealous God to those who hate me, visiting the iniquity of the fathers to the third and the fourth, but to those who love me and keep my commandments, I show steadfast love for thousands."37 The indefinite use of the numbers "the third and the fourth" and "thousands" inevitably creates some obscurity in translation, but does not muddy the overall meaning. In the end, one has to admit that the interpretation in the sense of in herited guilt is unavoidable, even though the phrases "to those who hate me" and "to those who love me" are not related only to "the fathers" but to all the generations suffering punishment or enjoying divine benevo lence.38 The declaration that God visits the iniquity of the fathers upon (35) See F.

It deals with the conquest of Canaan in three sections: first, the nations and their cultic in stallations must be utterly exterminated according to the prescriptions of Ms.Ms. Neophyti r II: Éxodo (TE 8; Madrid/Barcelona: Consejo superior de investigaciones cien tfficas, 1970) 465, English translation of Exod 20:5-6: "... because I am the Lord, your God, a jealous and revenging God who takes revenge with zeal on the wicked, upon the re bellious sons, until the third and fourth generation on those who hate me; when the sons fol low their fathers in sin I call them those who hate me.

It is noteworthy that Targum Onkelos has an identical translation for Exod 20:5-6 and Deut 5:9-10, while in Neophyti 1 the translations differ slightly. See also the Septuagint, with, in essence, the same translation for both texts: "... for I am the Lord thy God, a jealous God, recompensing the sins of the fathers upon the children, to the third and fourth generation to them that hate me, and bestowing mercy on them that love me to thousands of them, and on them that keep my commandments." For the explanations by the Church Fathers, see F. Spadafora, Collettivismo e individualismo nel Vec chiochio Testamento, 19-33, 178-79■ Among more recent interpreters C. F. Keil, Genesis und Exo dus,dus, 512, and U. Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Exodus, 243, offer a similar interpretation of the Targum. (39) When C. F. Keil, Genesis und Exodus, 512, mentions Targum Onkelos, he adds: "... so daB die Nachkommen fur ihre eigenen und fiir ihrer Vorfahren Missetaten Strafe leiden." (40) J. Scharbert, Biblica 38(1857)146, for instance, first affirms: "HaB oder Liebe sind das allein Entscheidende dafùr, wie sich Gott zu den Menschen verhâlt." Immediately after this he says that God adds the sins of the fathers to those of the sons if the latter follow in their evil footsteps. Does not this signify a uniting of individual and collective retribution?</page><page sequence="19">[ 1g] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 53 ban (vv. 1-5) ; second, Israel is distinguished from all other nations by its election as a holy people (vv. 6—16) ; and third, faith in God should over come all fear (vv. 17—26). The retribution formula is part of the affirma tion that God has freely chosen Israel from among all peoples and is faithful to the promises given to its fathers, which were affirmed most no tably in the deliverance from Egypt. The writer speaks of God in the third person: "Know therefore that the Lord your God is God, the faithful God (hdJel(hàJêl(hàJêl hanne^màn) who keeps covenant and steadfast love {sorrier habbërît wéhahesed)wéhahesed) with those who love Him and keep His commandments, to a thousand generations (léDelep dôr), and requites to their face those who hate Him, by destroying them; He will not be slack with him who hates Him, He will requite him to his face. You shall therefore be careful to do the commandment, and the statutes, and the ordinances, which I com mand you this day" (vv. g—11 ). Divine fidelity is primarily a basis for an invitation to the people to be faithful to their God and it therefore seems extremely apt that the retribu tion formula should begin with its positive aspect. This (v. 9) contains the following new elements: sômër instead of noser (Exod 3:7) or cdseh (Exod 20:6 = Deut 5:10; Jer 32:18); bérît, appearing only here; and iPelep dôr. The expression iPelep dôr provides valuable confirmation that, in the pas sages already dealt with, laDâlàfîm (Exod 20:6 = Deut 5:10; Exod 34:7; Jer 32:18) must be understood in the sense of a sucession of up to a thou sand generations and not as denoting a mass of people living at one par ticular time. The negative section (v. 10) departs notably from the classical formula. Every trace of inherited punishment in the succession of genera tions has vanished, because the immediacy of the death penalty for those who "hate" God is emphasized. Finally it is worth taking into account that the expressions "those who love Him" and "those who hate Him" are not placed at the end as they are in Exod 20:5—6 (= Deut 5:9—10). The Deu teronomist wanted to show unambiguously that love given to God was the precondition required for divine faithfulness and for the covenant with all its rich fruits, while hostility leads inexorably and directly to destruction. f. Conclusion The fundamental similarity of the passages considered above and their characteristic participial style provide sufficient evidence to show that we have here a more or less fixed retribution formula, and the term "credo formula" is probably appropriate and justified. The formula does in fact summarize a generally valid understanding of God's nature, and is a kind of synthesis of Hebrew belief. It is accordingly of exceptional solemnity</page><page sequence="20">54 J°ZE KRASOVEC [20] and significance.41 Because it comprehends two opposed aspects of the divine character and activity, it represents both promise and threat, em phasis being laid on one or the other in accordance with particular cir cumstances. This may provide an explanation of the selection of the positive positive/negative or negative/positive sequence in describing aspects of God's dealing with the Chosen People. In Exod 34:6-7, Num 14:18, Deut 7:9—10, andjer 32:18, the formula serves as an assurance of divine fidelity, mercy, and forgiveness; whereas in the Decalogue (Exod 20:5—6 = Deut 5:9—10), it functions primarily as a threat in the warning given against the worshipping of foreign gods. Owing to its brevity, the formula cannot provide sufficient linguistic evi dence for all aspects of its profound theological message. The main em phasis is, however, evident. Of the utmost importance is the enormous gap between the numbers 'thousand' and 'three-four' used to denote opppos ing aspects of the divine activity in relation to Israel; this difference can not be fortuitous. God is, by His own nature, a benevolent God, and, regardless of how one understands the expression laDâlâpîm — whether as a succession of generations, or as people living at one particular time — a thousand denotes a very large number, and in the hymn-like declaration of the formula it sounds like a synonym for unlimited : God's steadfast love toward the faithful is without limit.42 Despite the disparity of the numbers, the negative section of the for mula still holds a question. No attempt to explain this section can escape the conclusion that collective retribution or inherited punishment is at least partially presupposed : the children suffer as much for their own ini quity as for that of their fathers — but why should they suffer at all for what their fathers did? How can this statement be brought into line with the postulate that divine justice is incontrovertible and with the frequent assertions of the Bible that God punishes each only according to his own iniquity? So major a question can only be authoritatively answered within the framework of all the statements of the Hebrew Bible that are in any way connected with either collective or individual retribution.43 (41) See R. Knierim, Die Hauptbegriffe fur Sunde im Alten Testament (Gûtersloh: G. Mohn, 1965) 103: "Die Vermutung liegt nahe, daC in diesen, in Kultus entstandenen und tradier ten Sâtzen Israel seine Geschichtserfahrung unter Jahwe summarisch und doxologisch zusammengefasst hat und dafi wir in ihnen die Kernstellen haben, die ausdriicklich bezeu gen, was sie in der Gesamtkomposition des Pentateuch — und dariiber hinaus in der Gesamt geschichte Israels — breit entfaltet niederschlug."J. Scharbert, Biblica 38(1957)130, calls the formula "Bekenntnisformei." (42) The majority of commentators look for the difference in the numbers thousand/ three-four along these lines.

The Execution and Rejection of Punishment for Ancestral Guilt Quite a number of passages in the Hebrew Bible testify to the validity of collective or inherited (vicarious) punishment. Their diversity requires that they should be investigated in categories: punishment for ancestral iniquity; pronouncement of collective punishment; and execution of col lective punishment. There are also a few passages that explicitly reject the dogma of inherited punishment or affirm the validity of individual di vine retribution. In spite of their paucity, it is these texts that answer deci sively the question whether collective retribution should be considered a doctrine. Etiological explanations of certain facts present a special problem. When unusual, tragic historical events occur, it is normal to look for rea sons, and biblical writers tend to conclude that there must either be obvi ous personal guilt, or the familial guilt of the fathers, or the communal (generic) guilt of the people. An etiological explanation of this sort may be partially convincing, especially when it is supported empirically; it is sometimes obvious that a specific transgression has led to a particular mis fortune. Again, misfortune may awaken memories of past guilt that are suddenly recognizable as the cause of tribulation.44 Arguing from misdeed to mishap in this way is, however, in principle of only relative validity: mis fortune may have other causes. A. PUNISHMENT FOR THE INIQUITY OF THE FATHERS (ANCESTORS) The Holiness Code (Lev 17:1—26:46) contains laws and instructions but tressed by powerful exhortations to Israel to be holy and distinct from all other nations. The great concluding exhortation, the Epilogue to the Ho liness Code (26:1—46), sets before the people the way of life and the way of destruction.45 The section dealing with "curses" (vv. 14—39) declares pect of the formula in order to provide a broader basis for a synthetic discussion of the prob lem of collective retribution. The positive aspect of the formula, is not disputable and it is therefore unnecessary to deal with it.

The reiterated threat ends with the words: "And you shall perish among the nations, and the land of your ene mies shall eat you up. And those of you that are left shall pine away in your enemies' lands because of their iniquity; and also because of the in iquities of their fathers they shall pine away like them" (vv. 38—39). The next section, dealing with divine forbearance (vv. 40—45), begins with the promise: "But if they confess their iniquity and the iniquity of their fa thers . . . , then I will remember my covenant with Jacob . . ." There must be cogent reasons for the inclusion of ancestral iniquity in these opposing statements. The severity of the threat of punishment for disloyalty is em phasized, while the demand for the admission of personal guilt and that of the fathers shows that only an eagerness for radical change will incline God to benevolence. An extremely odd example of vicarious collective punishment is given in the self-contained narrative of the Gibeonites' revenge in 2 Sam 21:1—14. The passage states that during David's reign there were three years of famine, and that the king sought from God the reasons for it. A similar sit uation (noted above) arose in the Hatti land during the reign of Mursilis who made like inquiries. In both cases the conclusion was that the disaster might have arisen from an earlier violation of treaty obligations.46 The treaty between the Israelites and the Gibeonites was concluded by an oath sworn in the time of Joshua (cf. Josh 9:3—27), and David was told: "There is bloodguilt on Saul and on his house, because he put the Gibeonites to death" (v. 1).47 David takes the explanation to heart, and asks the Gibeon ites: "What shall I do for you? And how shall I make expiation, that you may bless the heritage of the Lord?" (v. 3). They reject material compensa tion but, in accordance with the principle of blood-vengeance, demand the lives of seven of Saul's sons: "The man who consumed us and planned to destroy us, so that we should have no place in all the territory of Israel, let seven of his sons be given to us, so that we may hang them up before the Lord at Gibeon on the mountain of the Lord" (vv. 5—6). David agrees, and hands over seven of Saul's sons to the Gibeonites, who hang them on the mountain "before the Lord" (vv. 6—9) in the first days of harvest. He arranges for them to be decently buried together with the remains of their Butzon Se Bercker/Neukirchener Verlag, 1993) 123-50, defends the poetical integrity of the Epilogue and points to its exilic or post-exilic origin.

The tale ends: "And after that God heeded supplications for the land" (v. 14). This interpretation of divine will and the attempt to appease God by human sacrifice is problematic in several respects. It is obvious that both the Gibeonites and David had reasons for taking vengeance on the "house of Saul"; the request of the Gibeonites was probably motivated by their crude desire for vengeance rather than by a feeling of the inheritability of ancestral guilt. David's consent was not understood by everybody as a mea sure of propitiatory justice; during his flight before Absalom he was cursed by Shimei: "Begone, begone, you man of blood, you worthless fel low! The Lord has avenged upon you all the boood of the house of Saul, in whose place you have reigned; and the Lord has given the kingdom into the hand of your son Absalom. See, your ruin is on you; for you are a man of blood" (2 Sam 16:7-8). The plague prayers of Mursilis do not pro vide any justification of David's consent, for Mursilis pleads for mercy, claiming that restitution has already been made twentyfold, and does not mention propitiatory sacrifice. Unlike the story in 2 Sam 21:14, the plague prayers of Mursilis do not end with any mention of the Storm-god's heed ing his supplication for the land, but express the king's readiness to do anything the Storm-god or other gods might order.48 In the final analysis, past transgression cannot be considered the only possible reason for a mis fortune and therefore propitiatory sacrifice cannot be the only possible means of expiation. Much less problematical is the etiological interpretation of misfortune in reference to the notorious "sin of Manasseh" and other earlier trans gressions, especially when the inherited sin is linked with the communal sin of Israel. In 2 Kgs 21:10—15, God gives reasons for the decision to de stroystroy Jerusalem, which include a severe indictment of King Manasseh and past generations: "Because Manasseh king of Judah has committed these abominations, and has done things more wicked than all that the Amor ites did, who were before him, and has made Judah also to sin with his idols; therefore thus says the Lord, the God of Israel, Behold, I am bring (48) See a.io; translation by A. Gôtze, ibid., ANET, 395-96: "... if the servant has in curred a guilt, but confesses his guilt to his lord, his lord may do with him whatever he pleases. But, because (the servant) has confessed his guilt to his lord, his lord's soul is pacified, and his lord will not punish that servant. I have now confessed my father's sin. It is only too true, I have done it. If there is to be restitution, it seems clear that with all the gifts that have already been given because of this plague, with all the prisoners that have been brought home, in short with all the restitution that Hattusa has made because of the plague, it has already made restitution twentyfold. And yet the soul of the Hattian Storm-god, my lord, and of the (other) gods, my lords, is not pacified. But, if ye demand from me additional restitution, tell me of it in a dream and 1 will give it to you."</page><page sequence="24">58 JO ZE KRASOVEC [24] ing upon Jerusalem and Judah such evil that the ears of every one who hears it will tingle . . . , because they have done what is evil in my sight and have provoked me to anger, since the day their fathers came out of Egypt, even to this day" (cf. Jer 15:1—4). In 2 Kgs 23:25, the writer singles out King Josiah for special praise, but adds: "Still the Lord did not turn from the fierceness of his great wrath, by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasseh had provoked Him" (v. 26). Verse 27 speaks of God's decision to remove Judah as Israel was removed. In 2 Kgs 24:3—4 'he writer concludes that misfor tune has befallen Judah according to God's will because of all Manasseh's sins. He had filled Jerusalem with innocent blood, and this God could not forgive. The report on the finding of the Book of the Law in 2 Kgs 22:8—20 (cf. 2 Chr 34:14—28) reflects a conviction that the current generation was suffering on account of the iniquity of their fathers. But the punishment was not irrevocable: he who bowed before God's law might hope for mercy. The High Priest Hilkiah finds the Book of the Law in the temple. When the scribe Shaphan reads it before Josiah, the king rends his gar ments and orders his trusted men : "Go, inquire of the Lord for me, and for the people, and for all Judah, concerning the words of this book that has been found; for great is the wrath of the Lord that is kindled against us, because our fathers have not obeyed the words of this book, to do ac cording to all that is written concerning us" (v. 13). The prophetess Hul dah confirms the fundamental meaning of the Book of the Law and predicts punishment for the whole of Jerusalem because of its infidelity to God (vv. 16—17), but she also tells King Josiah that God wishes to exempt him from the general misfortune since he had humbled himself, rending his clothes when he heard the divine castigation of Jerusalem (vv. 18—20). All cited examples from 2 Kings are part of the Deuteronomistic etio logical (post eventum) interpretation, which shows that "Manasseh's sin" was paradigmatic. In principle, even an experience of the most deter mined apostasy does not compel the conclusion that a particular misfor tune has to be linked with the guilt of ancestors or (and) the present generation. Nevertheless, the Deuteronomistic historian insists, by con trasting the sin of Manasseh and the faithfulness of David and Josiah, that the people of Israel must acknowledge their guilt and that of past genera tions. The main purpose of his demonstration that continual disobedi ence finally caused the destruction of Israel and Judah through divine judgment is his desire to awaken a sense of repentance.49 But by doing so (49) For the discussion about sources and themes of the book of Kings, cf. especially</page><page sequence="25">[25] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 59 he discloses his profound feeling of communal responsibility and the in heritability of ancestral guilt — in the period when the principle of indi vidual responsibility and retribution was about to prevail over all kinds of collectivism. The theme of inherited punishment is particularly important in the book of Jeremiah. In rebuking Judah's evil deeds (2:1—37), God re proaches the people for their backsliding, and v. 9 declares: "Therefore I still contend with you, says the Lord, and with your children's children I will contend." It is possible that the reference is not to the apostasy of the "children's children" then alive but to the rule that children tend to follow the bad example of their fathers. The longer the record of past apostasy, the greater the likelihood of it in future generations. The dialogue between God and the prophet in Jer 14:1-15:9 is highly relevant to the issuse of inherited punishment. The structure is as follows: description of the drought (14:2-6); lament of the people (14:7-9); di vine response (14:10—173); defeat (14:1711—18); lament of the people (14:19—22); divine response (15:1-4); divine judgment on the people (15:5—9).(15:5—9)■ First, Jeremiah speaks of the exceptional circumstances affecting men and beasts (14:2-6). This is followed by contrite self-reproach and a plea by the people (vv. 7-9) : "Though our iniquities testify against us, act, O Lord, for Thy name's sake . . ." God in reply reproaches the people and orders orders Jeremiah : "Do not pray for the welfare of this people ..." (v. 11). The prophet vainly attempts to justify the people (vv. 13—16) and com plains of their extreme desolation (vv. 17-18). The people are penitent once more in vv. 19-22: "Hast Thou utterly rejected Judah?. . . We ac knowledge our wickedness, O Lord, and the iniquity of our fathers, for we have sinned against Thee . . ." But God replies even more decisively (15:1-4) that He will not relent: "Though Moses and Samuel stood before Me, yet My heart would not turn toward this people. . . . And I will make them a horror to all the kingdoms of the earth because of what Manasseh the son of Hezekiah, king of Judah, did in Jerusalem" (15:1-4). The refe rence to Manasseh's transgression as the final reason for the catalogue of promised disaster implies that his sin must have been exceptional indeed (cf. 2 Kgs 21:10-16; 23:25; 24:3-4). The story of Jeremiah's life serves as a warning. In Jer 16:1—13, the prophet is commanded to eschew three normal human acts in order that the threat of terrible punishment shall be brought home to the people: M.Noth, The Deuteronomistic History (2nd ed.; translated from the German; JSOT.S 15; Shef field:field: JSOT Press, 1981); F. M, Cross, Canaanite Myth and Hebrew Epic: Essays in the History of the Religion Religion of Israel (Cambridge, Mass. / London : Harvard University Press, 1973) 274-89: "The Themes of the Book of Kings and the Structure of the Deuteronomistic History."</page><page sequence="26">60 JOZE KRASOVEC [26] he must not marry, for God will bring unnatural death upon all newborn children and their parents (vv. 2—4); nor may he enter any house of mourning, for God will "remove peace" (sàlôm) from "this people," and though many will die, no one will weep for them nor comfort their or phans (vv. 5—7); nor, finally, may he enter any house of feasting, for God will end all rejoicing in Israel (vv. 8—9). Jeremiah is warned that when he announces these prohibitions and threats, the people will self-confidently ask: "Why has the Lord pronounced all this great evil against us? What is our iniquity? What is the sin that we have committed against the Lord our God?" (v. 10). The prophet must answer: "Because your fathers have for saken Me, says the Lord, and have gone after other gods and have served and worshipped them, and have forsaken Me and have not kept My law, and because you have done worse than your fathers, for behold, every one of you follows his stubborn evil will, refusing to listen to Me; therefore I will hurl you out of this land into a land which neither you nor your fa thers have known, and there you shall serve other gods day and night, for I will show you no favor (hânînâh)" (vv. 11—13). The punishment is dictated by the lex talionis: because they chose freely in the past to worship other gods, they will be forced to serve them in the future. Verses 10—13 parallel the declaration in 5:19: "And when your people say, 'Why has the Lord our God done all these things to us?' you shall say to them, 'As you have forsaken Me and served foreign gods in your land, so you shall serve strangers in a land that is not yours'." Trito-Isaiah speaks in Isa 65:1—16a to a divided post-exilic community of the contrasting fates that await them: punishment and reward. The first section (vv. 1—7) contains a reproach to the rebellious, who have rejected God's offers of salvation and are following false ways. The rebuke ends with the threat of punishment for their own iniquity and that of the fathers: Behold, it is written before Me: "I will not keep silent, but I will repay, yea, I will repay into their bosom their iniquities and their fathers' iniquities together, says the Lord; because they burned incense upon the mountains and reviled Me upon the hills, I will measure into their bosom payment for their former doings." The history of Israel shows that threats of punishment were usually</page><page sequence="27">[27] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 61 ineffective. Only infliction of punishment brought the people to their knees, admitting their guilt and showing a genuine desire for amendment of their ways. The prayers in Lam 5 and Dan 9:4—19 testify to this stubborn fact. Self-criticism by the people is characteristic of the book of Lamenta tions. The complaint of the excessive pain endured by a humbled and trampled people never becomes a complaint about God, but accompanies an admission of, and regret for, their own guilt. On one occasion they also refer to inherited punishment (5:7): Our fathers sinned, and are no more ; and we bear their iniquities. From what follows it is evident that the people ascribe only part of their guilt to the fathers. In 5:16 they exclaim: The crown has fallen from our head; woe to us, for we have sinned! Daniel's prayer (Dan 9:4—19) confesses Israel's guilt in the first person plural, admitting that God has justifiably smitten Jerusalem and dispersed the chosen people. In 9:16b the people acknowledge: "Because for our sins, and for the iniquities of our fathers, Jerusalem and Thy people have become a byword among all who are round about us." Parallel to the ad mission of iniquity, Daniel acknowledges God's mercy and forgiveness (vv. 9, 18), pleading for a deflection of the divine wrath from Jerusalem (v. 16a) and that the guilt of Israel be pardoned (v. 19). B. PRONOUNCEMENT OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT The Holiness Code (Lev 17:1—26:46) provides penalties for sacrifice to Molech (20:1—5). In 20:2, it is laid down that an Israelite, or anyone tern porarily resident in Israel, who dedicates his child to Molech shall be stoned to death. In 20:4—5 the law threatens collective punishment: "And if the people of the land do at all hide their eyes from that man, when he gives one of his children to Molech, and do not put him to death, then I will set My face against that man and against his family, and will cut them off from among their people, him and all who follow him in playing the harlot after Molech." The reason for this collective punishment is that some types of apostasy are held to desecrate God's name and the temple. Purification is possible only at the cost of the transgressor's life. To tole rate such aberrations would be to encourage the spreading of desecration and the contamination of society.</page><page sequence="28">62 J O Z E KRASOVEC [28] A classic example of such desecration ending with radical purification is the story of rebellion and punishment in Num 16:1—35. It is generally agreed that this section is a complex of traditions. It seems that the Dathan and Abiram material belongs to J E, and the Korah material to P. The final editor, however, worked the various traditions together in the hope of providing a unifying theological perspective. As has been aptly said: "Different persons are involved and they have in common only the fact that they rebel against something or other."50 The Levite Korah rebels against Moses and Aaron, demanding the high priesthood. He is joined by Dathan and Abiram and 250 leaders of the congregation, who formulate their grievances thus: "You have gone too far! For all the congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them; why then do you exalt yourselves above the assembly of the Lord?" (v. 3). Moses calls for a divine judgment that will make it clear whom God has chosen and who is holy (vv. 4—7), and tries to persuade Korah to be content with his exist ing status and relinquish his claim on the priesthood (vv. 8—11). But Korah gathers together the whole community against Moses and Aaron at the en trance to the tent of meeting (v. 1g), and the glory of the Lord appears to all the congregation. God tells Moses and Aaron: "Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may consume them in a moment" (v. 21). The two respond in deep humility: "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin and wilt Thou be angry with all the congre gation?" (v. 2 2). This intercession is reminiscent of the Hittite plague prayers of Mursilis, which end with the appeal: "Whatever rage (or) anger the gods may feel, and whosoever may not have been reverent toward the gods — let not the good perish with the wicked! If it is one town, or one [house], or one man, O gods, let that one perish alone! Look ye upon the Hatti land with favorable eyes, but the evil plague give to [those other] countries!"5' The difference between the two cases is that Moses and Aaron appeal to the principle of individual retribution in order to prevent collective judgment being unleashed on the entire congregation, while the Hittite petition is inspired by the observed effects of a supposed collec tive judgment and the hope that further casualties may be averted. Moses orders the people to remove themselves from the vicinity of the dwelling-places of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and calls on the judge of all the world to indicate who has been sent: "Hereby you shall know that the Lord has sent me to do all these works, and that it has not been of my own accord. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they are (50) See M. Noth, Numbers (translated by J. D. Martin from the German; OTL; London: SCM Press, 1968) 121.

But if the Lord creates something new, and the ground opens its mouth, and swal lows them up, with all that belongs to them, and they go down alive into Sheol, then you shall know that these men have despised the Lord" (vv. 28—30). The rebels, their families,52 and all their possessions are duly engulfed, while fire consumes another 250 who have offered incense (vv. 31—35; 26:10). Thus God hearkened to Moses' and Aaron's plea not to destroy the whole community, but restricted retribution to the instigators of the rebellion, upon whom, however, an even more radical collective punishment was imposed. In the last resort, nonetheless, this terrible sen tence is concerned not with the principle of collective punishment but with the cleansing of an entire region that had become contaminated by a brazen challenge to God's absoluteness and sanctity. The books of Samuel contain several pronouncements of collective or inherited punishment: 1 Sam 2:31—33; 2 Sam 3:28—29; and 2 Sam 12:14. The first passage appears in the oracle against the house of Eli (1 Sam 2:27—36), which is regarded by many exegetes as an insertion by the Josianic historian. Verses 31—33 reflect a desire to justify the exclusion of Eli's house from the Jerusalem sanctuary. The passage of doom is clearly concerned with the destrucion of the whole of Eli's house on account of the unfaithfulness of his sons Hophni and Phinehas: "Behold, the days are coming, when I will cut off your strength and the strength of your fa ther's house, so that there will not be an old man in your house . . ." This prediction is probably an echo of Saul's slaughter of the priests in Nob (1 Sam 2 2:11—19), since they were Eli's descendants. Saul has carried out a horrible act of collective punishment out of his crude desire for ven geance, but "a man of God" (2:27) anticipates this event in his oracle of future judgment. The second passage, 2 Sam 3:28—29, is a report of David's curse on Joab and his household after Joab treacherously murdered Abner, the com mander of the Israelite army under Saul: "I and my kingdom are for ever guiltless before the Lord for the blood of Abner the son of Ner. May it fall upon the head of Joab, and upon all his father's house; and may the house of Joab never be without one who has a discharge, or who is lep rous, or who holds a spindle, or who is slain by the sword, or who lacks bread." David's explicit avowal of his innocence and some other formal in dications suggest that this pronouncement might be of Deuteronomistic origin.53 His ruthless legacy to his son ofjoab's punishment in 1 Kgs 2:5-6, (52) See also Deut 11:6. In Num 26:11 it is stated that Korah's sons did not die. (53) Cf. especially T. Veijola, Die ewige Dynastie: David und die Entstehung seiner Dynastie</page><page sequence="30">64 J(:)ZE KRASOVEC [30] which points to the court source, in common with most of the Succession Document (2 Sam 9—20 + 1 Kgs 1—2), indicates, however, that the present formulation of David's curse must have some historical ground. The pronouncement of punishment in 2 Sam 12:10 is part of Nathan's Parable (11:27b—12:25), which referred to David's affair with Bathsheba (11:1—27a). The prophet Nathan begins by pronouncing a general re tributive punishment: "Why have you despised the word of the Lord, to do what is evil in his sight? You have smitten Uriah the Hittite with the sword, and have taken his wife to be your wife, and have slain him with the sword of the Ammonites. Now therefore the sword shall never depart from your house ... I will raise up evil against you out of your own house . . ." (12:9—12). This prediction "looks very much like a prophecy after the event in order to provide a theological interpretation of Absalom's rebel lion and, especially, of his appropriation of David's concubines (16:21— 22)."54 It is striking how David's own words justifying Uriah's death come back to haunt him according to the principle of jus talionis: kîkàzôh ivékâzeh tô^altô^al hehàreb "for the sword devours now one and now another" (11:25). The point of Nathan's prophecy is, however, the pronouncement of a curse on David's house, which strikes the child born of his adultery. David's sincere confession: "I have sinned against the Lord" (v. 13a) saves his his life, but the punishment is transferred to his child: "The Lord also has transferred your sin (gam-yhwh hecêhîr hattdDtka) ; you shall not die. Never theless, because by this deed you have utterly scorned the Lord, the child that is born to you shall die" (vv. 13b—14). P. Kyle McCarter is obviously right in commenting: "The verb (hecëbîr) means more than 'has put away' (RS V). The sin cannot simply be forgotten: It must be atoned for. Thus, if David himself is not to die, the sin must be transferred to someone who will."55 Nathan's pronouncement of doom then, does imply that the death of David's child was a result of God's direct intervention.56 David's subse quent history, especially the narrative of Absalom's rebellion, however, shows that his house was in the truest sense stricken by an inherited curse : nachnach der deuteronomistischen Darstellung (STTAASF B/1g3; Helsinki: Suomalainen Tiede akatemia, 1975) 30-32.

The jus talionis, so often secretly at work in history, is here prophetically revealed as the personal activity of the Lord of History against the adulterer. The whole history of David can, indeed, be in some sense understood as the history of the punishment for this one transgression."</page><page sequence="31">[31] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 65 these events were not guided by direct divine intervention but by the in tendons and deeds of human actors.57 In i Kgs 14:1—18, we find an account of the death of Jeroboam's son. The original story seems to be preserved in vv. 1—6, 12, and 17, whereas the remainder is the work of the Deuteronomic editor. The illness of his son Abijah moves King Jeroboam to send his wife secretly to Shiloh to ask the prophet Ahijah for a prognosis. He, however, goes further, he re counts to her Jeroboam's apostasy (vv. 5—9) and pronounces merciless punishment upon him (vv. 10—16). The beginning and end of the passage have the taste of inherited punishment: "Therefore behold, I will bring evil upon the house of Jeroboam, and will cut off from Jeroboam every male, both bond and free in Israel, and will utterly consume the house of Jeroboam, as a man burns up dung until it is all gone . .." (v. 10) ; "And he will give Israel up because of the sins of Jeroboam, which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin" (v. 16). Jeroboam's wife returns to face the fulfillment of the prophet's prediction, for Abijah is already dead. The end of the dynasty is recounted in 15:29—30: Baasha has murdered Jero boam's son Nadab, and reigns in his stead (vv. 27—28). "And as soon as he was king, he killed all the house of Jeroboam; he left to the house of Jero boam not one that breathed, until he had destroyed it, according to the word of the Lord which he spoke by his servant Ahijah the Shilonite; it was for the sins of Jeroboam which he sinned and which he made Israel to sin, and because of the anger to which he provoked the Lord, the God of Israel" (vv. 29—30). A similar punishment befalls King Ahab at Elijah's intervention (1 Kgs 21:17—29). Verses 20b—22 and 24 come from the early, vv. 25—26 from the later Deuteronomic editor. Ahab connives at the murder of Nabot by means of false witnesses suborned by the Lady Macbeth of her day, his wife Jezebel, and the prophet Elijah announces the divine punishment: "I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do what is evil in the sight of the Lord. Behold, I will bring evil upon you; I will utterly sweep you away, and will cut off from Ahab every male, bond or free, in Israel" (vv. 20-21; cf. 2 Kgs 9:7-8; 9:26). Jehu, who has killed Kingjoram, Ahab's (57) See G. von Rad, op. cit., 166-204 (ch. VIII) : "The Beginnings of Historical Writing in Ancient Israel." The point of this chapter is the observation that 11 Samuel, especially the Succession Narrative, is based on the perception of indirect ways of divine retribution. On p. 204 he concludes: "... now for the first time it was possible to understand God's activity in an all-embracing sense. It is no longer seen as something which operates from time to time through the charisma of a chosen leader, but as a much more constant, much more widely embracing factor concealed in the whole breadth of secular affairs, and pervading every single sphere of human life."</page><page sequence="32">66 J()ZE KRASOVEC [32] son (2 Kgs 9:24), and Ahab's remaining 70 sons (2 Kgs 10:6—9), jusdfies his action before the people injezreel: "Know then that there shall fall to the earth nothing of the word of the Lord, which the Lord spoke concern ing the house of Ahab; for the Lord has done what He said by His servant Elijah" (2 Kgs 10:10; cf. 10:17). The book of Jeremiah refers three times to collective or (and) inherited punishment: twice in the form of prediction and once of demand. In one of Jeremiah's "confessions" (11:18-12:6) we find that the prophet is pro hibited from prophesying in the Lord's name in Anatot, so he demands divine punishment: "But, O Lord of hosts, who judgest righteously, who triest the heart and the mind, let me see Thy vengeance upon them, for to Thee have I committed my cause" (11:20). He receives the following di vine answer: "Behold, I will punish them (hinënîpôqèd câlêhem); the young men shall die by the sword; their sons and their daughters shall die by famine; and none of them shall be left. For I will bring evil upon the men of Anatot, the year of their punishment" (11:22—23). When Jeremiah's op ponents hatched a plot against him (18:18—23), similar to that of 11:18— 12:6, the prophet turns to the Lord, demanding their punishment (18:21): Therefore deliver up their children to famine; give them over to the power of the sword, let their wives become childless and widowed. May their men meet death by pestilence, their youths be slain by the sword in battle. One of Jeremiah's concerns was the exiles in Babylonia. Their religious leaders were promising an immediate return to their homeland, but Jere miah was obliged to rebut this false hope. In a general letter to the exiles (29:1—23), which shows much evidence of Deuteronomic editing, he pro nounces judgment on their prophets Ahab and Zedekiah. Another letter (29:24—32) is concerned with Shemaiah of Nehelam who had written to the temple overseer in Jerusalem in an attempt to counteract Jeremiah's influence on the exiles. This letter closes with pronouncement of divine punishment: "Behold, I will punish (hinënî pôqèd) Shemaiah of Nehelam and his descendants; he shall not have any one living among this people to see the good that I will do to my people, says the Lord, for he has talked rebellion against the Lord" (v. 32). In the eighth century, a clash between Amos and Amaziah, the official representative of the state priesthood, resulted in a famous oracle, Amos 7:10—17, which consists of three scenes and an epilogue of judgment: Amaziah accuses Amos of conspiracy against Jeroboam II (vv. 10—11); he</page><page sequence="33">[33] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 67 orders Amos to leave Bethel and return to Judah (vv. 12—13); and Amos denies any connection with "professional" prophets, but emphasizes that God himself has made him a prophet (vv. 14—16). Since Amaziah was at tempting to interfere with divine rule, he becomes the target of a fivefold curse affecting himself, his family, and the people of Israel as a whole (v. 17): Your wife shall be a harlot in the city, and your sons and your daughters shall fall by the sword, and your land shall be parcelled out by line; you yourself shall die in an unclean land, and Israel shall surely go into exile away from its land. In Job's speeches, contradictory statements are sometimes made con cerning the fate of the wicked. When Zophar claims that their earthly glory and joy are transient (20:1—29), Job asserts exactly the opposite (21:7-34). In 27:13-14, however, he says: This is the portion of a wicked man with God, and the heritage which oppressors receive from the Almighty: If his children are multiplied, it is for the sword; and his offspring have not enough to eat. C. EXECUTION OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT The first case to be considered here is the story of Achan, which is part of the account of the compaign against Ai in Josh 7:1-8:29. The narrative contains traditional material from J and E, but the decisive strain is the Deuteronomic interpretation by the Josianic historian in light of the an cient ideology of the holy war. An expedition against Ai shows that God helps Israel only in return for obedience; in the present context herem sta tus is concerned, i.e., the things devoted to destruction (see 6:17—19; cf. Deut 7:26; 13:16). Joshua is told by God that there are "devoted things" concealed among the people. He is therefore to carry out the procedure of the sacred lot, "and he who is taken with the devoted things shall be burned with fire, he and all that he has" (7:15). After "Akhan the son of Carmi, son of Zabdi, son of Zerah, of the tribe of Judah, was taken" (7:18), "Joshua and all Israel with him took Achan the son of Zerah, and the sil ver and the mantle and the bar of gold, and his sons and daughters, and his oxen and asses and sheep, and his tent, and all that he had; and they brought them up to the Valley of Achor" (7:24). Joshua employs a signi ficant word-play on the jus talionis: meh câkhartànû y a ckorkd yhwh bayyôm hazzeh, "why did you bring trouble on us? The Lord brings trouble on you</page><page sequence="34">68 J°7.E KRASOVEC [34] today" (7:25). He then delivers the guilty man to collective execution by stoning. The narrator thinks it important to add: "... then the Lord turned from his burning anger" (7:26). It is obvious that this execution does not reflect any doctrine or principle of collective retribution, not even "the strong feeling of solidarity, amounting to a sense of corporate personality, which existed in ancient Israel,"58 but rather the view that an exceptionally serious sin resulted in contamination of the whole area where the crime was committed. Hence purification was possible only if everything belonging to the transgressor was destroyed.59 Another difficult case is the punishment of the Benjaminites for a crime reminiscent of that committed by the people of Sodom (see Judg 19:22-26; cf. Gen 19:4—11). Their obscene behavior impelled the tribes of Israel "to a man" to gather before the Lord in Mizpah in order to decide how to destroy the tribe of Benjamin (Judg 20:1-11). When this was achieved, after initial reverses, only 600 escaped, all the others being slaughtered, "men and beasts and all that they found" (20:48). Jabesh in Gilead was similarly punished, because its inhabitants had not come to Mizpah to collaborate in dealing with the Benjaminites (21:4—11). The congregation commanded: "Go and smite the inhabitants of Jabesh Gilead with the edge of the sword; also the women and the little ones. This is what you shall do; every male and every woman that has lain with a male you shall utterly destroy" (21:10—11). The extermination was, how ever, incomplete: 400 virgins were selected and handed over to the Ben jaminites who escaped the earlier slaughter (21:12—14), an expression of the pain the tribes of Israel felt at the punishment meted out to the latter. The people cried in Bethel: "O Lord, the God of Israel, why has this come to pass in Israel, that there should be today one tribe lacking in Israel?" (58) See J. Bright, The Book of Joshua (IntB 2; Nashville, Tennessee: Abingdon, 1953) 589-90■ (59) See M. Noth, Das Buch Josua (HAT 1/7; 2nd ed.; Tiibingen: J. C.B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1953) 45; M. Greenberg, "Some Postulates of Biblical Criminal Law," Yehezkel Kauf mannmannJubilee Volume (ed. M. Haran; Jerusalem: Magnes Press, Hebrew University, i960) [24] : "Achan's misappropriated objects — the story tells us four times in three verses (Josh. 7:21,22,23) — were hidden in the ground under his tent. Therefore he, his family, his do mestic animals, and his tent, had to be destroyed, since all incurred the חרם status. This is not a case, then, of vicarious or collective punishment pure and simple, but a case of collec tive contagion of a taboo status. Each of the inhabitants of Achan's tent incurred the חרם sta tus for which he was put to death, though, to be sure, the actual guilt of the misappropriation was Achan's alone." A similar explanation is to be found in R. G. Boling, Joshua Joshua (AB 6; Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1982) 277-28; on p. 228 he states: "... this execution does not reflect excessive and disproportionate retaliatory 'justice' but a serious concern for public health."</page><page sequence="35">[351 "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 69 (21:3). Because they had vowed they would not give their own daughters as wives to the Benjaminites (21:7), they chose this ingenious way out of the quandary, ensuring that the tribe of Benjamin would continue to exist (cf. 21:15—23). The story in its entirety testifies that extreme wickedness calls for an extreme punishment, which leads in turn not to victorious joy but to sorrow. This is the beginning of mercy. The ultimate aim of the punishment is not destruction but conciliation.60 Mention may be made also of Saul's crude revenge on the priests of Nob who had aided David in his flight: "You shall surely die, Ahimelech, you and all your father's house" (1 Sam 2 2:16). At his command the Edomite Doeg murdered 75 priests (2 2:18). "And Nob, the city of the priests, he put to the sword; both men and women, children and suck lings, oxen, asses and sheep, he put to the sword" (v. 19). This is not, of course, a pronouncement and execution of divine punishment, but rather the lawless reaction of a deceived king. In contrast, the narrative of David's census and the plague in 2 Sam 24:1—25 (= 1 Chr 21:1—30) has a strongly theological implication. In its fundamental theological message the passage resembles the tale of the blood revenge of the Gibeonites (2 Sam 21:1—14). Both narratives are based on an account of a specific transgression by a king resulting in di vine anger, which could be appeased only by some kind of expiation. The narrative clearly falls into three parts: the census story (vv. 1—9); the plague story (vv. 10—17); and the altar story (vv. 18—25). There is a wide di versity of opinion about the original nucleus and its growth into the pre sent narrative.61 "Seen in its totality, chap. 24 is primarily concerned with the plague,the plague, its cause (the census), and solution (the altar)."62 The account does not make it clear wherein the evil of a population census consists, since that seemed self-evident to the writer. In establishing the impressive number of his warriors, David is seeking to demonstrate his own impor tance and strength, instead of trusting in the divine power and its provi dence.dence. Joab perceives the sinfulness of the deed at its inception; David, only after its implementation. Collective punishment then follows, and God threatens the entire people with destruction on account of David's (60) See H. W. Hertzberg, Die BûcherJosua, Richter, Ruth (ATD g; 4th éd.; Gôttingen: Van denhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1969) 248-56. (61) Cf. especially T. Veijola, Die ewige Dynastie, 108-17; H.

Only when David sets up an altar on the spot selected by God is there forgiveness for the transgression and an end to the pestilence. David's attitude is highly significant for an assessment of the concept of collective retribution. When David becomes conscious of his guilt, he rec ognizes it and asks for mercy: "I have sinned greatly in what I have done. But now, O Lord, I pray thee, transfer your servant's guilt (wêcattàh yhwhyhwh hacâber-nâ~'hacâber-nâ~' ''et-câwôn cabdëkà), for X have done very foolishly" (v. 10). It is crucial to see that the verb càbar does not mean simply 'taking away' (see RSV), but 'transfer' of the guilt (cf. 12:13).63 God accedes to David's request and allows him to choose between three possible punishments (v. 13). David's answer is ingenious in its argumentation: "I am in great distress; let us fall into the hand of the Lord, for His mercy is great; but let me not fall into the hand of man" (v. 14) .64 But when David realizes the ex tent of the punishment chosen by God, he prays (v. 17): Lo, I have sinned and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Thy hand, I pray Thee, be against me and against my father's house. This prayer is astonishing, because it shows that David does not accept the principle of individual retribution whithout qualification. He sees clearly that the people should not be the object of collective or inherited punishment, but finds it justifiable — or unavoidable? — that both he and the house of his father should suffer for his sin. Where lies the reason for limiting collective retribution to his "father's house"? Is he bound by his plea for "transfer" of his guilt in v. 10, or by the general consciousness of communal responsibility within a family and of the inheritability of ances tral guilt? No exegete has tried to answer this question. But in the final analysis, the solution is a matter of common sense and experience: it seems un avoidable that the guilt of a particular person must affect his closest associ ates, especially his family. We may even be inclined to think of genetic "transfer" of collective retribution. It is therefore more than justifiable to speak of inherited punishment. It is not by chance that the link between sin and curse is so close. Consequently, only God can save human beings (63) See P. K. McCarter, ibid., 511 : "David requests a way to save his life by transferring his guilt to someone or something else." (64) See the comment by H. W. Hertzberg, / &amp; II Samuel, 413: "David merely decides against the second punishment and leaves it to the Lord to decide between the first or the third."</page><page sequence="37">[37] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 71 from their curses — once they are aware of the fatal nature of their mis deeds and are willing to amend their ways. A further example of execution of collective retribution is found in the book of Esther. There punishment is carried out by human beings, but within the context of God's involvement in the life of the Chosen People, who are saved while God's enemies are exterminated. Influenced by Queen Esther, King Ahasuerus hangs Haman from the gallows the latter had intended for Mordecai (7:9—10). He also fulfills Esther's wish and hangs 10 of Haman's sons who had already been slaughtered by the Jews in Susa (9:12—14) ; the queen, not content with their murder, demands their posthumous humiliation. This fact shows how inexorable the de mand for collective retribution could be for the Jews. The essence of the message of the book of Esther is epitomized in 9:24—25: "For Haman the Agagite, the son of Hammedatha, the enemy of all the Jews, had plotted against the Jews to destroy them, and had cast Pur, that is the lot, to crush and destroy them; but when Esther came before the king, he gave orders in writing that his wicked plot which he had devised against the Jews should come upon his own head, and that he and his sons should be hanged on the gallows." A similar case occurs in the book of Daniel. The Persian satraps, casting about for reasons why Daniel should die, persuade King Darius to sign a death warrant against his will (6:5—16). Daniel is cast into a lions' den, but the beasts leave him alone because he is innocent before God and the king (6:17—24). He is brought out of the den unharmed, and his accusers are thrown into it in his stead, along with their wives and children: "Be fore they reached the bottom of the den the lions overpowered them and broke all their bones into pieces" (6:25). D. PROHIBITION OF COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT There is a curious example of rejection of the principle of collective ret ribution in the ordinance given within the framework of the "Book of the Covenant" (Exod 20:22—23:33). Here we have a collection of individual laws giving evidence of differing origins, applications, patterns, literary forms, and style.65 One section, 21:18-36, deals with bodily injuries in (65) For the date of this collection see R. E. Clements, Exodus, 128: "So far as the date of this law code is concerned, a precise ascription can hardly be given, since the laws apply to the everyday life of a typical settled community, without direct reference to external political conditions. As the laws of Deuteronomy (not later than 621 B.C.) show an attempt to revise and adapt the Book of the Covenant to a later era, the latter must be older. It presupposes in a number of its laws the conditions of life in the settled land of Palestine so that it must have been compiled after the settlement of Israel in the late thirteenth century B.C."</page><page sequence="38">72 JOZE KRASOVEC [38] general, and vv. 28—32 prescribe punishment for injuries caused by a bull's horns in particular. Verse 28 states: "When an ox gores a man or a woman to death, the ox shall be stoned, and its flesh shall not be eaten; but the owner of the ox shall be clear." This stipulation harmonizes with God's declaration in Gen 9:5: "For your lifeblood I will surely require a reckoning; of every beast I will require it and of man; of every man's brother I will require the life of man." Since the human race was created in the image of God and is bound to its maker by covenant, the death penalty applies to the beast even though it is not responsible, because it has offended against the sacral and communally-covenanted nature of hu man life and has thereby become impure. The community must not only inflict the death penalty on the beast — and in certain circumstances on its owner — but also solemnly remove the agent of the misdeed from its midst. Hence the prohibition of eating the flesh of the punished animal. An important point is that the owner of the ox is free of guilt, unless he was aware that the beast was dangerous and had failed to restrain it. Then, if the owner is an accessory to someone's death, the death penalty (not by stoning, however) affects him also, though the court may commute this to a fine (vv. 29—30). Verse 31 provides that: "If it gores a man's son or daughter, he shall be dealt with according to this same rule." This statute apppears to reject vicarious punishment under the severe lex talionis in fa vor of the principle of individual retribution, thus opposing the judicial tradition in the ancient Near East, which at that time demanded for a son's death the life of a son of the guilty person.66 The statute provides for the death penalty to fall on the person responsible and not on his son or daughter.67 If this interpretation is correct, the passage contains what was in its time and place a double novelty. First, exceptional severity is shown in punishing the guilty person; secondly, punishment of the one who is not guilty is rejected. The point gains in importance because the ordi nance belongs among the older provisions of Israelite law. This interpretation of Exod 21:31 is confirmed by the provision found (66) See §§229-30 of Hammurabi's Code of Laws, which prescribe the death of a builder's son if a finished building collapses, killing the son of the owner. See Also §§116 and 209-10. Cf. S. A. Cook The Laws of Moses and the: Code of Hammurabi (London : A. &amp; C. Black, 1903) 260-62; G. R. Driver and J. C.

There are good reasons for ascribing this prohibition to an early period of Hebrew law: "It is not in the form expected of a deuteronomic law (viz. expressed in the second person singular form of address) and gives no sign of being a late addition; it must, therefore, be an older law quoted by the deuteronomic legislator. It affirms a principle which is by no means a late phenomenon in Israelite history."68 It is highly significant that a simi lar prohibition appears in the Middle Assyrian laws from the time of Tiglathpileser I in the twelfth century. There we find the provision: "If a woman, whether the wife of a seignior or the daughter of a seignoir, has uttered blasphemy or indulged in loose talk, that woman shall bear the penalty due her; they shall not touch her husband, her sons (or) her daughters."69 The prohibition of collective or vicarious punishment takes the form of a positive commandment, binding upon human legal systems. There are at least two reasons for making such a provision : first, the existence of a law with an opposite sense; second, the ubiquitious recognition of collec five or vicarious retribution in the tradition, although the positive law nowhere prescribes it. As noted above, Hebrew law does not recognize positive legal provisions that might call for collective or vicarious retribu tion, though other nations in the ancient Near East were familiar with such decrees.70 An even more important reason for such a prohibition might have been the human propensity to take full or even excessive re (68) See A. D. H. Mayes, Deuteronomy (NCBC; Grand Rapids; Michigan/ London : Wm.B.Wm.B. Eerdmans/Marshall, Morgan &amp; Scott, 1979) 326. See further G. von Rad, Deuteron amy:amy: A Commentary (translated by D. Barton from the German; OTL; London: SCM Press, 1966) 152: "A thorough study of early legal history, including that outside Israel, has shown that the conception of a general development from collective to individual liability is incor rect. The principle of personal responsibility was by no means unknown in the earlier times. The whole Book of the Covenant knows nothing of such corporate liability within the family. Therefore we must reckon with the possibility that our Deuteronomic regulation is after all much earlier than was formerly assumed." (6g) See tablet A.2; the translation by Th.J.

Anyone in a position of authority — particularly any ruler — may permit himself to impose collective punishment, even when it defies objective, rational explanation.7' Some of the collective or vicarious punishments recorded in the Hebrew Bible probably have their origin here. A crude human desire for vengeance that justifies itself as a demand for collective punishment was not well thought of, and King Amaziah, who succeeded his murdered father Joash, received praise for acting in the opposite sense. After strengthening the royal authority, he put to death both his father's murderers (2 Kgs 14:5). "But he did not put to death the children of the murderers; according to what is written in the book of the law of Moses, where the Lord commanded, 'The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, or the children be put to death for the father; but every man shall die for his own sin'" (14:6; 2 Chr 25:4). It is evident, then, that the prohibition in Deut 24:16 rejects both contrary legal provisions made by some neighboring nations and misuse of the practice by the Israelites. Hence there are no reasons for concluding that the verse is more recent than, or replaces, the previously generally valid principle of collective retribution. The prohibition of collective punishment in Deut 24:16 is crucial in dis tinguishing between the divine and the human administration of justice. Even though collective punishment is explicitly prohibited to humans and their legal institutions it may in certain circumstances be dictated by God. It is important to note that such distinction is not to be found in the cor responding Hittite documents. In instructions for temple officials, the justification of human and divine collective punishment is introduced thus: "Are the minds of men and of the gods generally different? No! With regard to the matter with which we are dealing? No! Their minds are exactly alike."72 In a much later period, Cicero (106—43 B.C.E.) was equally unable to see any difference between divine and human adminis tration of justice. When Stoic philosophers contend that children, grand children, and their descendants may inherit punishment from a person who has escaped it by dying, he reacts in ironical indignation: "What a a wonderful equality of gods! Would any state tolerate a proposer of such a legal measure that a son or grandson was to be sentenced if a father or grandfather had transgressed?"73 It is significant that Cicero rejects the (71) See C.

The ideological pre suppositions of Greek and Roman religions are the most pressing reasons for assuming that such statements of collective punishment probably rest on perception of indirect rather than of direct ways of divine punish ment, for the gods work through nature and do not intervene directly in human affairs.74 In this context mention may be made of Philo Judeaus (c. 30 B.C.E.— 45 C.E.) who clearly distinguishes between the action of divine providence and the law. In his treatise On Providence, Philo defends divine justice in general and finds it justifiable that God should permit collective punish ment for special reasons: "Earthquakes, pestilence, thunderbolts and the like though said to be visitations from God are not really such. For nothing evil at all is caused by God, and these things are generated by changes in the ele ments. They are not primary works of nature but a sequel of her es sential works, attendant circumstances to the primary. If some persons of a finer character participate in the damage which they cause, the blame must not be laid on God's ordering of the world, for in the first place it does not follow that if persons are considered good by us they are really such, for God judges by standards more ac curate than any which the human mind employs. Secondly provi dence or forethought is contented with paying regard to things in the world of the most importance, just as in kingdoms and com mands of army it pays regard to cities and troops, not to some chance individual of the obscure and insignificant kind. Some declare that just as when tyrants are put to death it is justifiable to execute their kinsfolk also, so that wrongdoings may be checked by the magnitude of the punishment, so too in times of pestilence it is well that some of the guiltless should perish also as a lesson extending further to call all others to a wiser life ... 75 But in dealing with the law, Philo provides, in The Special Laws, a magnifi cent argument against applying the principle of collective punishment: (74) Cf. especially H. Lloyd-Jones, The Justice of Zeus (SCL 41; Berkeley, Los Angeles, Lon don: University of California Press, 1971, 1983). (75) See 2.53-55; the translation by F. H. Colson, Philo IX (LCL 363; Cambridge, Mass/ London: Harvard University Press/W. Heinemann, 1941, 1985) 493-95.</page><page sequence="42">76 JOZE KRASOVEC [42] . . . Indeed in the past the legislators themselves, who are the land marks and standards of justice, have not shrunk from acting as such to the greatest injustice. With an eye to men's opinions rather than to truth they have ordained that the fate of traitors and tyrants should be shared by the children in the first case and by the next five fami lies in the second. Why, one might ask? If they were companions in error let them also be companions in punishment, but if they had no association with the others, never followed the same objects, never let elation at the success of their kinsmen tempt them to a life of ease and pleasure, why should they be put to death? Is their relationship the one sole reason? Then is it birth or lawless actions which deserve punishment? Probably you, most reverend lawgivers, had worthy peo pie for relations. If they had been bad, I do not think the idea of such enactments would have entered your minds . . . He therefore expressly forbade that sons should be slain instead of fathers or fa thers instead of sons. Thereby also he gave it as his judgment that persons who had sinned should be the persons who were punished, whether the punishment consisted of monetary fines or stripes and injurious treatment of a still more violent kind, or wounds and mai ming and disfranchisement and exile or any other kind of sentence. For in the single statement that one man should not be killed instead of another he included also the cases which he left unmentioned.76 E. ADVOCACY OF INDIVIDUAL DIVINE RETRIBUTION Apart from the legal provisions governing the human administration of justice we have so far encountered few supporters of divine methods of enforcing individual or limited collective retribution. When God decided to annihilate a whole region on account of Korah's rebellion, Moses and Aaron fell on their faces, crying: "O God, the God of the spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be angry with all the congrega tion?" (Num 16:22). And when David saw the angel slaughtering the peo pie because of his transgression, he appealed to God: "Lo, I have sinned, and I have done wickedly; but these sheep, what have they done? Let Thy hand, I pray thee, be against me and against my father's house" (2 Sam 24:17). There are other passages, involving Abraham, Jeremiah, and Ezekiel, that are even more significant in this respect. Once an ex plicit demand that legal institutions sentence a person according to the principle of individual retribution had surfaced in the Hebrew Bible, it be (76) See 3.163-68; the translation by F. H. Colson, Philo VII (LCL 320; Cambridge, Mass./London: Harvard University Press/W Heinemann, 1937, 1984) 577-81.</page><page sequence="43">[43] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 77 came ever more evident that for God this rule must be decisive. Jeremiah and Ezekiel make it clear that God ultimately deals with Israel in confor mity with this principle.77 When facing the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, Abraham ar gues with God: "Wilt Thou indeed destroy the righteous with the wicked? Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; wilt Thou then destroy the place and not spare it for the fifty righteous who are in it? Far be it from Thee to do such a thing, to slay the righteous with the wicked, so that the righteous fare as the wicked! Far be that from Thee! Shall not the Judge of all the earth do right?" (Gen 18:23—25). One would have ex pected Abraham to rely on the principle of individual retribution and sug gest a separation of the righteous from the wicked, followed by the punishment of the latter. God's justice would then have been unarguably displayed. But Abraham embroils himself in an extremely controversial ar gument, demanding that the divine forbearance be shown to all, on ac count of a hypothetical handful of the righteous. Jeremiah's personal experience with his people must have made him conclude that the nation as a whole had gone astray, and that there were no righteous folk left in the land. It thus stands to reason that the prophet saw the ruin of the nation as proof of divine administration of justice. But at the same time he knew that God could not abandon the Chosen People entirely. Once the severity of the punishment had opened their eyes and made them acknowledge their guilt (31:18—19), God promised radical changes: "And it shall come to pass that as I have watched over them to pluck up and break down, to overthrow, destroy and bring evil, so I will watch over them to build and to plant, says the Lord" (31:28). God will conclude a new covenant with them, different from the previous one bro ken by Israel, "I will put my law within them, and I will write it upon their heart; and I will be their God, and they shall be my people" (31:33). This new covenant will be marked by forgiveness of iniquity (31:34), which will afford an incentive toward proper comprehension and permanent faith fulness on the part of the people. How should the declaration in vv. 29-30 be understood in this context? The passage states: "In those days they shall no longer say: 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge.' But every one shall die for his own sin; each man who eats sour grapes, his teeth shall be set on edge." This statement shows that the proverb "The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge" was in (77) See especially H.G.May, "Individual Responsibility and Retribution," HUCA 32(1961) 107-20.</page><page sequence="44">78 JOZE KRASOVEC [44] use at the time to express a complaint that the present generation was suffering an inherited punishment or curse. Such a reproach cannot be tolerated in the hands of evil-doers who want to pin all the guilt on past generations and on God, but it may be justified to some degree when ut tered by the relatively righteous, by believers who see clearly that Israel's present condition is chiefly the result of the sins of former generations. The retribution formula in Exod 20:5 (= Deut 5:9), Exod 34:7, Num 14:18, and and Jer 32:18 must be an awkward stumbling-block to such people. Since Jeremiah does not appear to oppose the current application of the proverb, and promises that individual retribution will apply only in the fu ture, it is clear that, regardless of the virtues or defects of his contempo raries, he sees the current situation as providing confirmation of the proverb's validity. The present generation is indeed suffering on account of the sins of its fathers (cf. 32:18). Yet Jeremiah also knows that it is being penalized for its own sins. Its present state is a consequence of both past and present iniquity and it cannot expect instant amelioration. The magnificent promise of a future covenant (31:31—34) may suggest that there will be no call in the future for either collective or individual retribution, since iniquity itself will have disappeared. So it is possible to perceive a contradiction between the statement about individual retribu tion in v. 30 and the promise of forgiveness in v. 34•78 But can we accept a purely literal explanation of such a rhetorical and even emotional passage, regardless of fundamental theological postulates and of historical reality? Does the promise in 31:31—34 really mean that in the future "all," without exception, will know God, and that God will forgive them without excep tion? It seems more probable that the promise of forgiveness stems from circumstances — the penitent attitude of the suffering people — but is not intended to have general and absolute validity. Those who eat sour grapes will continue to have their teeth set on edge. Historical realism requires us to acknowledge that the statement "they shall all know Me" cannot be un derstood in an absolute sense. Who can believe in universal righteousness prevailing in all human affairs, without any possibility of man's going astray? Even in Christ's "new covenant," the threat of death for apostates remained.79 (78) W. Rudolph, Jeremia (HAT 12; 3rd éd.; Tùbingen: J. C. B. Mohr [Paul Siebeck], 1968) 200-201, even sees in this seeming contradiction proof that the text was not put together by Jeremiah. The opposite viewpoint is presented by: A.

In 18:2—4 he rebukes the people: "What do you mean by repeating this proverb concerning the land of Israel, 'The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge'? As I live, says the Lord God, this proverb shall no more be used by you in Israel. Behold, all souls are Mine; the soul of the father as well as the soul of the son is Mine: the soul that sins shall die." Ezekiel saw only too clearly that his own generation did not admit its guilt and showed no signs of penitence. The proverb was being used to accuse previous generations and to justify the present one. Ezekiel therefore drew the attention of his fellow-countrymen to the need for amendment of their conduct. His view that everyone dies for his own sins did not imply a denial of inheritability of ancestral guilt. It must have been clear to Ezekiel that the current state of affairs was largely the result of the sins of the fathers.80 He knew, however, that salvation was ultimately dependent upon the actions and attitudes of the present generation, and that the people needed nothing more than true repentance and return to the Lord. It was precisely this question of repentance that convinced both Jeremiah and Ezekiel that individual retribution is decisive. In the last resort, each is responsible for his own fate. Ezekiel concludes his reply to the challenge of the people with these words: "Therefore I will judge you, O house of Israel, every one according to his ways, says the Lord God. Re pent and turn from all your transgressions, lest iniquity be your ruin. Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed against me, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit! Why will you die, O house of Israel? For I have no pleasure in the death of any one, says the Lord God; so turn, and live" (18:30—32). F. CONCLUSION The passages that deal with one or another mode of collective or inhe rited punishment testify to a demand for collective punishment, a feeling of the inheritability of ancestral guilt, and an idea of communal responsi biltybilty in the history of Israel. But even more do they set limits to all brands of collectivism. Its relative character is made clear mainly in the relation ship between divine and human administratin of justice, and in relation to individual retribution. The relative character of collective punishment be ments on our text: "In Zukunft wird kein Abfall mehr môglich sein." J. Morgenstern, "The Book of the Covenant: Part III — The Huqqim," HUCA 8-9(1931-32)6, however, assumes that some Jews will sin but that they will be given the chance of reconciliation and a full rela tionship with God.

(80) See Ezek 16; 20; 21:3,9; 23.</page><page sequence="46">80 J()ZE KRASOVEC [46] comes apparent from the fact that human institutions are not allowed to practice it.81 From this prohibition it may be concluded that the principle of collective retribution is in essence negative. A God who makes use of it must have very cogent reasons for doing so. In principle, collective or vie arious punishment concerns directly only the transgressor: "Where the deity is expected to take punitive action, it is not uncommon for the crimi nal's punishment to include the extermination of his family. But this is less a genuine instance of collective responsibility than of retribution against the paterfamilias who in this way is touched in the loss of his family and so of his posterity."82 It is, however, sometimes impossible to establish in par ticular instances whether a collective punishment has been dictated by God. In cases of contamination or brazen rebellion against divine autho rity,83 it is possible to see justification for God's direct intervention and the imposition of radical and total judgment, but the case is different when re venge most foul is taken by human beings.84 In such instances human agents may attempt to justify their actions, unjustifiable in human terms, by referring to God's will. The most important argument against inflicting collective punishment is the principle of individual retribution. The Bible normally assumes that humans are responsible only for their own actions; only a punishment that is deserved is justifiable. Jeremiah and Ezekiel explicitly emphasize that individual retribution is normative for God's dealings with mankind (81) See Exod 21:28-31; Deut 24:16. Even J. B. Mozlely, Ruling Ideas in Early Ages and their Relation Relation to Old Testament Faith, 83-103: "Exterminating Wars," saw in these prohibitions the key to assessing all the examples of collective retribution found in the Old Testament, includ ing the extermination of pagans during the period of conquest. Mozley emphasizes that these cases are not an expression of positive law but special circumstances dictating miracu lous divine intervention in events, or the explicit authorization of human beings to impose collective punishment. In his opinion, in the earlier era the Israelites were exceptionally open to such miraculous divine authorization, because they did not as yet possess any deve loped sense of human individuality. (82) See W. Eichrodt, Theology of the Old Testament II, 235. (83) See particularly the ordinance on dedicating children to Molech in Lev 20:4-5, the sentence upon the rebels Korah, Dathan, and Abiram in Num 16:28-35, and the extermina tion of Achan together with his family in Josh 7:24-25. (84) See in particular the terrible revenge upon the Benjaminites (Judg 20:1-48) and Jabesh-gilead (Judg 21:10-11); the blood revenge of the Gibeonites (2 Sam 21:1-14);Jehu's liquidation of Ahab's sons and other members of his court (2 Kgs 10:6-12); the revenge upon Haman and his sons according to the lex talionis (Esth 9:12-14); the punishing of Daniel's enemies, together with their wives and children, also according to the lex talionis (Dan 6:25). It is difficult to see the operation of the divine will in the background to these events, because they testily only too clearly to the human tendency towards inexorable and total revenge.</page><page sequence="47">[47] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 81 (cf.(cf. Jer 31:29-30; Ezek 18:1—32). Examples of collective punishment are therefore exceptions to a rule, and there are clear-cut reasons for them. Once we accept that those reasons must be left to God, the problem posed by instances of collective retribution is solved. It becomes all the more ur gent to determine the true meaning of the solemn formula in Exod 20:5 (= Deut 5:9), Exod 34:7, Num 14:18, and Jer 32:18 which presents collec tive or inherited punishment as an eternal law governing the Lord's deal ings with Israel. How can this law and the supposed inheritability of ancestral guilt be reconciled with that of individual retribution? Is there an irreconcilable contradiction between the two, or may both be valid without one excluding the other? This question calls for a more general and synthesized assessment of the problem of collective retribution in the light of correlation between historical witness to the distinctive Hebrew concept of God and fundamental human experience of the relation be tween guilt and punishment. Only within this framework can the issues raised by all other cases referring to inherited punishment in the Hebrew Bible be properly assessed. 3. Operation of Natural Law Implies Collective or Inherited Punishment In the first part of this examination, the conclusion was reached that the formula of collective retribution, in its several variations, amounts to credo-formula expressing the very essence of God's attitude toward Israel in accordance with its attitude to divine law. After all attempts to explain the retribution formula have been exhausted, the only possible conclu sion is that it reflects a demand for collective punishment or a feeling that ancestral guilt is inheritable. In the second part it has emerged that bibli cal examples of collective punishment resulting from direct intervention in events by God or human agents are not expressions of a doctrine or a principle of collective retribution but are dictated by special circumstance. On the other hand, passages referrng to inherited punishment reflect ei ther rhetorical threats of future corporate punishment or experience of the inheritability of ancestral guilt. Sections dealing with punishment mo tivated by a crude desire for vengeance are a special case. The idea of communal responsibility hardly comes into question. It now seems possi ble to find a way of explaining the issue of collective or inherited punish ment in the Hebrew Bible in the context of divine retribution in general. The Bible testifies that God appears as a judge of human affairs both di rectly and indirectly: directly, in a personal response to aberration; indi rectly, through the operation of natural laws. This fact is compatible both</page><page sequence="48">82 JOZE KRASOVEC [48] with the human feeling that collective punishment should not be viewed as a doctrine or a principle and with the historical experience that evil un avoidably affects both the guilty and the guileless. A. COLLECTIVE PUNISHMENT AS ''NATURAL" CONSEQUENCE OF GUILT Many passages — notably in Wisdom literature — show that an evil deed often triggers its own punishment,85 while the historical and prophetic books, on the other hand, tend to use the language of divine wrath, jea lousy, repentance, revenge, and retribution.86 Indirect retribution makes clear the causal link between guilt and punishment: the sin inexorably avenges itself upon the sinner. Explicitly cosmic explanations of the prob lem carry this causal link to extremes and, as a result, exclude the possibi litylity of forgiveness. An inexorable natural sequence of guilt followed by punishment can be tragic, particularly when the consequences of evil are borne by the innocent as well as by the evil-doer. There are so many exam pies of this that it seems as if nearly all individual retribution is, at least in directly, also collective. No man is, indeed, an island. This fact shows that (85) Passages reflecting indirect retribution have provided K. Koch in his treatise "Gibt es ein Vergeltungsdogma im Alten Testament?" ZThK 52(1955) 1-42 = Um das Prinzip der Ver geltunggeltung in Religion und Recht des Alten Testaments (WdF 125; Darmstadt: Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, 1972) 130-81 — English translation "Is There a Doctrine of Retribution in the Old Testament?" Theodicy in the Old Testament (ed. J. L.Crenshaw; IRTh 4; Philadelphia, PA/London: Fortress Press/SPCK, 1983) 57-58, with arguments for rejecting the concept of "retribution." Cf. R.

Barton, "Natural Law and Poetic Justice in the Old Testament," JThSJThS 30(1979)1-14. Influenced by K. Koch's treatise, J. Barton suggests the use of the term "natural law" when talking of indirect retribution. (86) Many reacted to Koch's challenge on the basis of such passages, and defended the traditional meaning of retribution: F.

Once the moral order is demolished and the damage becomes irreparable, those affected are at best left with the possibility of avenging themselves upon evil-doers and excluding them from the community. Experience of the "natural" method of collective retribution may be considered the key to an appropriate method of interpreting the credo formula and passages like it. It is an indisputable and universal experience of human life that evil deeds have adverse effects on persons other than the perpetrator. The reputation of a whole family can be sullied by one of its members, and an indequate leader can bring misfortune upon a whole nation, as far as the third or fourth generation. Since we are concerned with universal experience of inherited punishment, and the credo-formula in Exod 20:5—6 (= Deut 5:9—10) and elsewhere is presented as a universal rule governing God's attitude toward Israel, we may conclude that the for mula is speaking not of a direct but of an indirect manifestation of God's steadfast love or punishment. If so, this means that the threat of punish ment is not an announcement of impending revenge, but merely a meta phorical pointer to the inescapable consequences of evil conduct — particularly when it is a matter of apostasy from God. Only such a conclu sion can explain why the same law threatens collective punishment by God, but disallows its use by human institutions. This prohibition is considered to be a positive ordinance, whereas indirect divine retribution is plainly a natural law.87 This conclusion makes it evident that the credo-formula has to be inter (87) See S. R. Driver, Deuteronomy, 277-78, who draws a parallel between the threat in Deut 7:10 and the prohibition in Deut 24:16: "There the reference is to the providence of God, operating naturally through the normal constitution of society: children are linked to their parents by ties, physical and social, from which they connot free themselves; and they suffer, not because they are guilty of their fathers' sins, but because by the self-acting opera tion of natural laws their fathers' sins entail disgrace or misfortune upon them. Here a law is prescribed for human action, and a principle is laid down for the administration of justice by the State : the family of a criminal is not to be punished judicially with him. The two cases are thus altogether different : it is one thing that, in virtue of the physical and social conditions in which they live, children should suffer for their fathers' sins; it is another thing that, by the deliberate intervention of human authority, they should be punished for criminal acts which they have not committed." See also S. R. Driver, The Book of Exodus (CBSC; Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1911) 195-96. Driver relies on J. B. Mozley, Ruling Ideas in Early Ages Ages and their Relation to Old Testament Faith, 104-25: "Lecture V: Visitation of the Sins of the Fathers upon the Children." Mozley uses the expressions "self-acting vindication" and "the law of God's natural providence." On p. 112 he states: "The link which connects the sin of the father with the injured condition of the children under the law of providence, is not a judi cial but a physical one."</page><page sequence="50">84 JOZE KRASOVEC [50] preted in the light of the characteristic symbolic and anthropomorphic Hebrew style embodied in biblical text. The Hebrew Bible emphasizes unceasingly that God is absolute, all-embracing, unfathomable, incompre hensible, utterly different from human beings. Consequently, the por trayal of the divine is in theory prohibited, although in practice God is presented through analogy, allegories, symbols, and expressions that are used to depict human nature, with all its extremes of feeling. If we com prehend and acknowledge these characteristics of biblical writing in gen eral, we ought to take them more into account in particular cases. In view of all the unsuccessful attempts to deny the existence of collective retribu tion in the credo-formula, we can only conclude that the formula is a metaphorical expression of human experience of indubitable, indirect di vine retribution in the world.88 The main weakness of most alternative explanations is that the formula has to be taken literally as a promise or threat of a direct manifestation of God's steadfast love or collective punishment. Being absolute and tran scendent, God does not need to intervene directly in the course of events without compelling reason. The belief in creation implies that God rules the world primarily through natural law, and permits this natural law to punish iniquity. God also allows history to form constellations of human factors, until it becomes necessary to intervene directly in the chain of hu man events. How, then, are examples of direct divine retribution to be explained? In the conclusion to the second section, attention has been drawn to the relative character of passages concerned with that subject, and this relativ ity needs emphasis. Nowhere does God appear as the only actor, but al ways in company with men whose actions are prey to personal feelings and passions. There is always a danger that humans claiming to act in the name of the divine will are giving effect to their own wishes and to a crude desire for vengeance. There is good reason, therefore, at least to inquire whether all the recorded cases of collective or inherited punishment were truly willed by God. It is evident that they happened because God permit ted them to happen, but permission implies only indirect divine retribu tion; it is based on definite reasons that man, most often, is unable to comprehend. This uncertainty as to whether certain historical events depict God's di rect intervention does not mean that the personal relationship between God and human beings should not be taken too seriously. On the con (88) When this study was finished, I discovered L. E. Goodman's On Justice'. An Essay in Jew ishish Philosophy (New Haven/London: Yale University Press, 1991) which adopts the same inter pretation on pp. 137-40: "The Sins of the Fathers."</page><page sequence="51">[51] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 85 trary. It is not necessary for us to be told directly by God that our inten tions are good or bad. We have simply to realize that the causal link be tween guilt and punishment is ubiquitous, on the cosmic level as well as on the personal-spiritual one. The community must recognize that evil ac tions and even wicked thoughts can destroy the harmony between God and the people, and that in every case the whole nation or even the whole human race is affected by them. If people pour poison upon their hearts, it is not necessary for God to intervene in order to destroy them. And when they choose not to live in communion with the divine, it is enough for God to withdraw and abandom them to their own deserts. If the credo-formula envisages God's dealings with Israel as indirect, this does not diminish the weight of its message — quite the opposite. It gains much greater significance than is perhaps at first apparent. This way of looking at things can make human beings more responsive to the facts of experience, which show how destructive man's behavior can be. Only some one with a comprehensive personal experience of the destructiveness of human iniquity is able to sense the gravity of the warning in the credo-for mula.89 It is not a matter of a hypothetical future possibility, but of a cer tainty buttressed by past experience. The complaints of the people of Israel that they are suffering on ac count of the guilt of the fathers are not based solely on imagination, but rather on knowledge of the actual errors of earlier generations, and of the sequence of events that logically followed these errors. Hence they express a feeling that God has abandoned them to their own devices, instead of re deeming them from their difficult situation. Their complaint that the Lord has not taken pity on them is a mark of confession of their guilt and the guilt of their fathers. Confession of sin is always the best way to salva tion. Those who recognize the gravity of their own iniquity and of that of the people as a whole may meet with their God in the depths of their souls and experience the divine presence, even though nothing has changed externally.90 The healing process must start in the human heart. B. THE RELATION BETWEEN COLLECTIVE AND INDIVIDUAL RETRIBUTION Wellhausen put forward the view that in ancient times Israel was familiar only with collective retribution; the idea of individual retribution suppos edly came later. This view is based on the type of solidarity derived from (8g) See L. E. Goodman, On Justice, 137: "The first impact of the statement that God visits the sins of ancestors upon subsequent generations is that of a warning directed more to the parents than the offspring, a caution as to the impact of our acts." (go) See particularly Job 40:1-42:6, and many psalms of lament.</page><page sequence="52">86 JOZE KRASOVEC [52] clan thinking in the early period of the history of Israel. Most recent ex egetes, however, think that the two concepts existed concurrently, although the principle of individual retribution became prominent only during the period around the Exile, when the individual shook off his collective ties as a result of the destruction of organized national communities. Such differences of opinion are mainly due to the state of the biblical texts. They came into existence within a relatively short period of time, so that the basis for diachronic research is very limited. It is difficult to deter mine which elements in particular passages are original, where they came from, and how they evolved to reach their final form. And there is an other problem : the passages dealing with retribution are extremely varied and are often declarative rather than descriptive in nature. If the theme of retribution occurs in a broader context, the same writer may recognize both individual and collective retribution.91 Of the utmost importance is the finding that in contrast to neighboring cultures and religions the Hebrews acknowledged only a divine right of collective retribution.92 When the law in Deut 24:16 explicitly forbids hu (91) Ezekiel, for example, presents collective retribution in chs. 16; 20; 21 (vv. 3 and g); 23, whereas in ch. 18 he emphasizes the validity of individual retribution. Cf. Job 20:1-29; 21:7-34; 27:13,14. (92) S. Segert, "Bis in das dritte und vierte Glied," CV 1(1955)37-39, draws attention to the possibility that the numbers sillësîm, ribbêcîm in the credo—formula have their basis in the execution of the law on blood revenge, still valid among Bedouins today. The law of blood revenge permits revenge up to the fourth generation, the fifth generation being exempt. Does the anthropomorphic comparison of a norm of divine justice with existing customs in human communities also signify approval of these customs? Segert thinks the opposite: "Die Formulierung im Dekalog ist eher illustrativ als imperativ, sie ist als Widerspiegelung einer bestehenden Gewohnheit und nicht als ihr Grund anzusehen" (p. 38). In essence, this affir mation is correct. The characteristic (and advantage) of anthropomorphic speech in ex pressing transcendent divine attributes lie precisely in the fact that it is not an adequate expression of them, but is merely analogical. Nevertheless, it implies some correspondence between allegory and reality, otherwise the allegory would lack foundation. It is not difficult to perceive that a basic accord exists between the primitive law of blood revenge and the message of the credo-formula. Blood revenge is the most paradoxical proof that, in the depths of the human conscience, murder is held to be so terrible a deed that it connot be appropriately dealt with other than by the taking of another life. This elemental desire for adequate compensation is probably more a cry for justice than a matter of someone being harmed: what is at stake is the fundamental requirement of restoring equilibrium to the moral order. Were it otherwise, the law would not have acquired broad social support. In its essence, this law must be in accord with the will of the Creator and Lord of the cosmic and moral orders, but He for several reasons ultimately retains jurisdiction over life and death. The indisputable fact that every moral evil done by man avenges itself in some way as much upon the evil-doer as upon those in any way linked to him and his dead, and that it may re sound negatively down through several generations, signifies in the light of divine absolute</page><page sequence="53">[53] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 87 man institutions to implement the principle of collective retribution, it af firms that such retribution must, in essence, be wrong. This, however, only makes the question of how to understand examples of divine collective retribution more urgent.93 An answer to this crucial question can only be sought within the framework of the Hebrew concepts of God's absolute ness and omniscience. Only God is the sovereign law-giver; only God can unchallengeably punish humankind. In the light of this divine absolute ness, all human authority is open to question. Consequently, God can set limits to human competence to act, even when the principle acted upon is valid, as, for example, in cases of individual retribution. Once it is clear that cases of God's direct collective retribution are die tated by exceptional circumstance, it may be asked how we are to justify the general rule of God's indirect collective retribution. An answer is pos sible only if, alongside the divine absoluteness, we take into account the relativity of the world as a whole and of human freedom within it. In dealing with a world in which so much is relative, God simply cannot apply absolute and irreversible rules. The created world is not perfect, but stands poised before the goal of completeness, and conflict arises between the absolute rules of God the Creator and the contingent reality of a ere ated world. Within this framework, human beings with their own freedom can create situations that demand departures from the rules. When, for instance, individuals demolish the bases of their own existence and that of the nation, God does not intervene to separate the wicked from the right eous, but permits the chronicles of time to unfurl in a manner that re fleets the behavior of the wrongdoers. So may the righteous become victims of the ways of the wicked. It appears to follow that the problem of collective divine retribution ness and providence that the specific human practice of blood revenge may serve as a univer sal anthropomorphic expression for a divine levelling of the moral order in the broadest sense and in all its aspects. (93) P J• Verdam, RIDA 2/3(1949)393-416, states correcdy that a differentiation between what is valid for human jurisdiction and the rules of divine justice is of essential significance for an assessment of the commandment on individual retribution in Exod 21:28-31; Deut 24:16, and collective retribution in the Bible. In p. 408 he states: "... il va de soi qu'il n'est pas permis au peuple d'Israël d'user des normes de la justice divine." On p. 412 he says: "Celui qui distingue ces deux terrains: le droit divin et le droit humain, chacun avec ses pre scriptions propres, peut aussi voir des cas-limites dans la législation comme dans la pratique israélites." Verdam does not, however, take the risk of trying to give a more profound and critical assessment of examples of indirect and direct collective punishment in the light of the experience and the reciprocity of the fundamental postulates of Hebrew belief. He is content with the finding that man cannot comprehend the rules of divine justice, and that some biblical examples of collective retribution are not legitimate.</page><page sequence="54">88 J()ZE KRASOVEC [54] is one of human righteousness rather than of divine justice. The sheer de structiveness of human iniquity is particularly evident in the indisputable fact that it has consequences not only for the evil-doer but also for the in nocent. The realization that this is so provides society with well-founded reasons for punishing the wrongdoer — although the problems do not end there. Ultimately, everyone must acknowledge his own unrighteouse ness and guilt before others, and everyone deserves punishment. Conse quently, the call for universal penitence and return to the Lord is more appropriate than the demand for punishment. This call must not be made solely "in the interest" of the individual, but on behalf of the whole of hu man society. Since iniquity is always social in nature, whether we like it or not, penitence must be so as well. Only in this light does the response in Ch. 18 of the prophet Ezekiel to the complaint of the people that they are suffering for the sins of their fathers become understandable : he calls them to an admission of their own iniquity and to amendment of their conduct. Conclusion This investigation of the credo-formula in Exod 20:5—6 (= Deut 5:9—10), 34:6—7, Num 14:18, Deut 7:9—10, andjer 32:18 has made it clear that the formula is based on a consciousness of the collective effects of God's deal ings with Israel. Attempts to argue otherwise have failed. Other biblical passages dealing with collective divine retribution show, however, that it is impossible to regard this concept as a doctrine or a principle, although an awareness of it existed alongside the principle of individual retribution in all periods of the history of Israel. We may conclude that consciousness of collective retribution was dominant during earlier periods on account of the more powerful social, tribal, and family ties then obtaining, but that the conviction gradually prevailed that only individual retribution was justifiable and applicable. Individual retribution, then, can be considered a doctrine or a principle in the strict sense of the word. In assessing the relation between individual and collective retribution, we must distinguish between principle or theory, on the one hand, and re ality,ality, on the other. Reality can differ sharply from a theory, consciousness, principle or moral imperative. The contradiction between individual and collective retribution does not signify a clash between two principles, but between a principle or imperative, and the objective facts resulting from the interplay between the laws of the world as a whole and human life in that world. In a relative, self-contained, and internally cohesive world, God cannot act exclusively in accordance with the principle of individual retri</page><page sequence="55">[55] "COLLECTIVE RETRIBUTION" IN THE HEBREW BIBLE 89 bution, distinguishing the wicked from the righteous. All have to dwell to gether under the sun, and participate in the triumph and travail of the created world. It follows that collective divine retribution cannot be con sidered as a direct, but only as an indirect way of God's acting in the world. It does not eventuate because God positively wishes it to do so, but because events are permitted to unroll in accordance with destructive in tervention by human beings in the created order of things. For Hebrew religion, the personal relationship between God and the Chosen People is cardinal, although God is transcendent and completely different from the world and human beings. Hebrew historic and prophetic religion overcomes the fatal nature of the process of individual and collective retribution with the belief in divine providence, in divine freedom, in relative human freedom, and in the Covenant. These founda tions of belief and sentiment make it possible to deal with the relation be tween guilt and punishment not only on a cosmic but also on a personal level. That is why the biblical writers express themselves anthropomorphi cally, making use of the most familiar symbols to arouse in the people a feeling for God's providence and mysterious ways of acting in the world. In spite of the poetic coloring with which the Hebrew faith is expounded, and the difficulty of defining basic terms with complete precision, the con elusions reached so far are firmly founded. This fact legitimates the methods employed by those exegetes who take their stand somewhere be tween the literal and the metaphorical or symbolic-literary approaches.</page></plain_text>
