SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE SAFETY EFFORT two decades ago, the anthropometric attributes of human mechanical simulations (dummies) used in crash impact work appear to have evolved as a result of predominantely arbitrary decisions rather than by a rational process of selection based on safety requirements. Researching into the past deliberations of appropriate SAE subcommittee activities (1)* and also the resolutions of the ISO/TC22/SC-1 2 subcommittee (2) one cannot find appropriate rationale for the 5th, 50th, and 95th percentile size selec- tions, except for the fact that the 50th percentile size and weight specifications appear to coincide reasonably well with the Gaussian midpoint of the injured male car occupant and also with the mean of the U.S. male adult population. There is virtually no information, however, on whether the 5th and 95th percentile size and weight combinations are even possible. With the forthcoming need to develop a new generation of crash test dummies, it is necessary to lay the background for the selection of the physical characteristics of the driving population which could be used for the construction of analytical and physical simulations. While the use of three dummy sizes has been advocated for years, a recent report by Peugeo t -Re nau 1 t (3) has questioned the rationale for this advocacy. On a prelimi- nary basis, the study established the hypothesis that the risk of being more or less severely injured in a car accident is independent of the physical stature of the injured car occupant.

ABSTRACT The National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) data file was interrogated to determine whether occupants of different statures and masses are subject to different injury severity rates. The NCSS data was divided into four height and weight categories. Injury severity rates were calculated for each category. The data was also interrogated for occupant size effects relative to frontal and side impacts, male and female occupants, use or non-use of restraints, and driver and right occupant positions. To gain further insight into the injury severity rate sensitivity relative to occupants' statures and masses, the data was also reviewed from the point of view of body segment injury. The analysis shows little, if any, effect on the rates, of injury severity due to either height or weight variations of the occupant. The evidence of no effect is very strong for frontal impacts and somewhat less for side impacts. A lower level of confidence in side impacts is caused primarily by substantial thinning out of the data at the extreme ends of the accident population distribution. Expansion of the analysis to include injury severity rates of body areas produced likewise no substantial evidence of height and weight dependency. 611 0096-736X/81 /8901 -061 1 $02.50 Copyright 1981 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">612 S. H. BACKAITIS AND D. NAJJAR was undertaken at the urging of the chairman of the SAE Human Biomechanics and Simulations Subcommittee (HBSS) (4) to provide, on the basis of accident data, some initial evidence on whether the severity of occupant injury is a function of his or her height and weight. In response to this suggestion, the authors undertook the task of performing an explor- atory analysis of the NCSS data bank. The study, because of its limited data base and other analytical limitations, is intended primarily to establish an initial determin- ation of injury anthropometry relationships and, hopefully, to spark further research based on different accident information files. LIMITATIONS Because this study was initially intended to be primarily exploratory in nature, focusing mainly on the question of height and weight of the occupant within the limited NCSS data set, it was not possible to explore a number of occupant and crash environment characteristics such as the age, of the occupant, present and past history of his health, vehicle characteristics, particulars within each crash mode, etc., all of which may also have significant influence on the level of injury severity. The study also did not investigate for the effects of other derived factors which could influence the outcome of this investigation, such as the characteristics and the sampling techniques of the NCSS data, its processing methodology, its validity to project national statistics, etc. REVIEW OF LITERATURE Review of past literature revealed the existence of only a few studies which are directly related to the question of what the composition of size and weight of human simu- lations should be (5). Appropriate SAE and ISO subcommittees discussed this question numerous times without making clear cut resolutions. The first substantive discussion paper published by Searle and Haslegrave (6) questioned the appropriateness of the height and weight parameters which make up the 5- and 95-th percentile sizes. Backaitis and Stephens (7), and Nyquist (8) confirmed on the basis of accident data that the mean height and weight of the accident population coincides closely with the mean of the U.S. population and that there is some reasonable matching of individual height and weight parameters at the 5th and 95th percentile size intervals but not necessarily for their combination. Recently, the Mechanical Simulations Crash Task Force of the HBSS (9) has expressed the desirability of developing all three sizes of simulations, but has not provided a scientifically based rationale for this need. METHODOLOGY This study was formulated in order to resolve the question: are there differences in injury severities between various weight and height groups of occupants in frontal and /or side impact modes and if there are any, can they be explained by the frequency of injury severities associated with individual body areas? Also, an attempt was made to determine whether the location of the occupant, his or her sex, and the use or non-use of the restraint system would have any influence on the above distribution. The NCSS data set was chosen to provide the base for this study. Although NCSS data may not necessarily represent the national accident statistics, it is probably the only data set publically available at this time that has a reasonably adequate quantity of information about the occupant and his injuries to make such a study possible. Initially, the data was parted into OAIS injury groups &gt; 3, &gt; 4 and fatals for both the height and weight categories. The height category was divided into four sets consisting of: (1) 4 ft. 11 in. and below, (2) 4 ft. 11 in. to 5 ft. 7 in., (3) 5 ft. 7 in. to 6 ft. 3 in., and 4) 6 ft. 3 in. and above. The weight category was also parted into four sets consisting of: (1) 114 lbs. and below, (2) 114 lbs. thru 164 lbs., (3) 165 lbs. thru 214 lbs., and (4) 215 lbs. and above. For body area injury study the body was divided into the following segments: (1) head, (2) neck, (3) chest- shoulders, (4) abdomen, (5) lumbar spine-back, (6) pelvis, (7) legs and (8) arms. The accident injury data was used to calculate the probability of injury to a certain OAIS level and above for each height and weight category, such as OAIS &gt; 3/Total, OAIS &gt; 4/Total, fatal/total. For these subsets which were found to differ signifi- cantly from the mean, the data was parted further in order to determine whether any particular parameter combination might be excessively sensitive to injury severity. Finally, the cumulative injuries, up to a maximum of three counts (one permitted per body segment) at or above the designated AIS &gt; 3 or &gt; 4 levels, were compared against all injuries attributed to that body segment in the NCSS data file. A significant difference in probability of injury for the body segment in question at various heights and weights would indicate that there are differences in injury severities between various sizes of people and, therefore, would support the need for different sizes of simulations. If no differences were found the need for different sizes of simulations would</page><page sequence="3">LIKELIHOOD OF INJURY 61 3 have to be supported on other basis than accident injury statistics, if at all. The data was examined for differences by two different methods: (1) by testing for significant differences using the chi square (X ) technique, (2) by examining the data through the comparison of pairs. The tests for significance using the technique employed standardized statistical methods which do not require further explanation. The tests for significance using the paired comparison method were performed as follows: (a) the data were calculated for probabilities of injury to OAIS &gt; 3 and OAIS &gt; 4 levels and tabulated as pairs against the respective height or weight segmentations (e.g. Table 3), (b) the data were then examined for low and empty cell counts. The remaining useful cells were analyzed in the following manner: (1) the useful portions of the data were judged to be significantly different if corresponding OAIS &gt; 3/Total and OAIS &gt; 4/Total pairs were covariant and higher or lower by at least 33 percent than the averages of their respective subcategories , (2) if only one cell of the pair was different from its respective average the data would not be considered different as the variations could be caused either by distortions of the weighting factors used in compiling the NCSS data or by the low cell counts at the OAIS &gt; 4 level, (3) If all the data in the paired subsets were similar it would indicate that the particular parameters under investigation are not sensitive relative to the respective height and weight variations of the occupant. RESULTS The NCSS file contains data from a total of 81,489 injured occupants of towed passenger cars, light trucks and vans. Of these occupants 2,766 are injuries at OAIS &gt; 3, 1,228 at OAIS &gt;4 and 755 fatalities. The injury counts are made up of weighted and unweighted occupant cases per established NCSS data collection procedures (10). Only occupants 16 years and above were considered in this study. The child injury data was purposely excluded to assure as much uniformity and lack of bias as possible, such as usage primarily of the right passenger position, different sensitivity to injury, etc. Table 1 shows the occupant height broken down into the four size categories and the aforementioned injury severity sets. Each category was divided into the following parameters pairs: (a) frontal and side collisions (FC&amp;SC), (b) male-female occupants (M&amp;F ) , (c) driver-right passenger occupants (DR&amp;RP), (d) restrained and unrestrained occupants (RE&amp;UR). Table 2 shows the occupant weight data broken down into identical subsets as was done for the height category. Seventy three and 72 percent of the occupants had known heights and weights, respectively. In the height breakdown 3 percent of those reported fall into the extreme categories (2 percent shortest and 1 percent tallest). Similarly, in the weight breakdown 12 percent fall into the extremes (9 percent lightest and 3 percent heaviest). Comparing the injury distributions in Tables 1 and 2, the cell counts were found to be relatively small in the size extremes, having a tendency to exaggerate the ratios and their differences. For example, the data set shows a high predominance of female occupants in the low height and weight categories and an over- whelming higher quantity of male occupants in the high height and weight categories. Similarly, the restrained occupant categories are nearly empty at both extreme ends of height and weight. For each data set the injury severity ratios were calculated by dividing the quantity in a particular data cell by the total within the corresponding category, such as OAIS ^ 3/Total and OAIS ^ 4/Total for DR , RP, M, F parameters, etc. The calculated values are shown in Tables 3 and 4 for the height and weight categories respectively. The data set was not reduced beyond OAIS &gt; 4 level at this point because of excessive thinning-out of the cell content at the size extremes. The data were then evaluated further for overall usefulness. Review of Tables 3 and 4 shows that some of the data cells in the female, restrained, and right passenger categories are incomplete and therefore of limited use. To determine what occupant positions are meaningful for further analysis, the data were then broken down into FC/DR, FC/RP, SC/DR and SC/RP categories as shown in Tables 5 and 6. Here the data again show a high degree of thinning-out at both extreme ends of the height and weight categories especially in the FC/RP and SC/RP categories (Tables 7 and 8). To determine whether the findings in the FC/DR and SC/DR categories are real or perhaps a composition of unrealistic data inputs, the FC/DR, FC/RP, SC/DR, and SC/RP categories were investigated further for frequency of injury to various body segments. Tables 9 and 10 reflect overall cumulative body injury counts for each height and weight category permitting each injured occupant to be credited up to a maximum of three AIS injuries. Tables 11 and 12 list the probabilities of injury to each body area, which were calculated by dividing the individual cell count by the total for each respective size category.

In most cases, the cell counts are low or empty at both extreme ends of height and weight.

Tables 21 through 24 reflect the calculated severity of injury rates to various parts of the body of drivers and right passengers in frontal and side impacts. ANALYSIS OF DATA Overview. Initial review of the data in Table 3 shows that the shortest set of people appear to have a higher severity of injury rate than any other set within the height category. Looking at certain variables such as collision direction, sex, occupant location, and use or non-use of the restraint system, the differences in the ratios are found to vary significantly among the subcategories. The injury rates of the shortest people in the frontal collision and in the right passenger categories at the OAIS &gt; 3 level are approxim- ately 2-1/2 times higher than those of the middle sets. On the other hand the differ- ences due to sex and usage of restraints appear to be insignificant, especially in the life-threatening injury subsets (OAIS &gt; 4).

Looking at the ratios of particular variables, many of the differ- ences are again found to vary with respect to each other primarily because of the relative smallness of the cell counts. In the frontal collision category, the heaviest set appears to be exposed to 1-1/2 times the rate of injury of the corresponding middle sets at the OAIS &gt; 3 level. The other variables produce differences that are less significant. The life-threatening injury ratios are less variant for each of the four categories and subcategories examined. The conclusion that might be drawn is that the heaviest set of people has a slightly higher OAIS &gt; 3 injury rate, in general, and in frontal collisions in particular. However, these injury rates are not higher for the 1 i f e - t hr e a t e n i n g categories.

This combination seems to explain most of the differences evident in the overall ratios (Table 3). Similarly, for the weight group (Table 8) the higher injury severity rates in the FC/DR category at the OAIS &gt;3 level appear to explain previously observed higher overall injury probabilities for the heaviest occupant set (Table 4). ANALYSIS OF SIGNIFICANCE OF INJURY SEVERITY VS. OCCUPANT SIZE AND WEIGHT Occupant Height. The initial analysis of the data in the NCSS file showed that the smallest group of adults (below 5 ft. tall) has a severity-of-in jury rate 1-1/2 times higher than the rates for taller people (Table 3). It was found that this difference in rate was even greater in the subcategories of frontal collision accident and right passenger occupant and that these two variables combined produced an injury rate that was five times as high. Are these differences significant? In response to this question, it was noted that the count in the extreme height groups was very small relative to the middle groups and that this smallness was probably exag- gerating the differences in rates. To test for the significance of these differences, the X2 was calculated. The values are pre- sented in Table 25. For the overall differ- ence among height groups the X? is 10.49. Since the numbers are weighted and the .05 significance region is above 7.82, it is not possible to say whether the difference is truly significant. If the three tallest groups are aggregated into one group and a -X.2 test is performed for just two groups, the X2 is 10.05. Thus, it is the difference between the smallest height group and the others which is contributing most to the statistic. The same two tests were executed for the subcategories for frontal collision accident, right passenger occupant and frontal collision accident/right passenger occupant (combined). The X2ls increase in value to reflect the greater differences in rates. The two group test shows again the smallest height group is creating this difference. It is likely that any subset of the original will increase the X2 since sub-</page><page sequence="18">628 S. H. BACKAITIS AND D.

Since the above tests did not conclude significance or insignificance definitively, another approach was considered. If the smaller height group is really incurring a higher injury rate, then this may be reflected in the distribution of injuries by body part. The premise here is that a higher injury rate for smaller people may be the result of more frequent injury to certain body parts. Table 26 shows the distribution of injuries by body part for occupants with OAIS 3. For simplicity and as a result of previous analysis, the extreme group is compared to the sum of the middle groups (60"-75" tall). The X2 is 29.23 (df.=8), which because of the weighted values , is not a decisively clear statistic. Looking at the frequencies of the two groups, the largest difference occurs for leg injuries: 38.3 per- cent vs. 14.0 percent. A X^ performed for the leg vs. other injuries gives a statistic of 21.73. Thus, most of the original statistic is due to the difference in leg injuries. Since the numbers have been weighted by either 1, 4, or 10 in the NCSS Table 25 - X2 TESTS FOR HEIGHT GROUP DIFFERENCES 4 Groups 2 Groups X2 df X2 _df Total 10.49 3 10.05 1 Frontal Collision 40.78 3 38.30 1 Right Passenger 33.03 3 32.13 1 Frontal Collision/ 98.37 3 96.65 1 Right Passenger file, it is obvious that none of the other body injuries in the small height group has been weighted by 10 except for unweighted count of leg injuries. Thus, one leg injury alone was weighted 10 times and this distorted the proportion of leg injuries and deceptively created most of the statistic. OAIS &gt; 3 Occupant Injuries/All Injuries ratios were also generated for each body part (Table 27). Again, the major differences exist for leg injuries, and for the same reason as before. From this analysis of X^, it is un- likely that the injury distribution by body part varies significantly between height</page><page sequence="19">LIKELIHOOD OF INJURY 629 Table 26 - DISTRIBUTION OF INJURIES BY BODY PART FOR HEIGHT GROUP Back/ Head/ Shoulder/ Total Abdomen Arm Spine Face Leg Neck Pelvis Chest Other 59 in &amp; below OAIS &gt;3 Occupants 47 6606 18 40 7 0 % of Total Injury 100 12.8 12.8 0 12.8 38.3 8.5 0 14.9 0 All Occupants 423 22 51 18 192 97 31 9 49 4 OAIS &gt;3/All Occupants .111 .273 .118 0 .042 .186 .129 0 .143 0 60-75 in OAIS &gt;3 Occupants 1858 218 142 30 376 260 127 92 609 4 % of Total Injury 100 11.7 7.6 1.6 20.2 14.0 6.8 5.0 32.8 .2 All Occupants 22866 571 2803 1110 8529 3978 2198 475 3049 155 OAIS &gt;3/All Occupants .081 .382 .051 .027 .044 .065 .058 .194 .200 .026 Table 27 - DISTRIBUTION OF INJURIES BY GODY PART FOR WEIGHT GROUP Back/ Head / Shoulder/ Total Abdomen Arm Spine Face Leg Neck Pelvis Chest Other IIA lbs &lt;1 below OAIS &gt;3 Occupants 81 7 10 0 9 12 7 7 ?9 0 % of Total Injuries 100 8.6 12.3 0 11.1 14.8 8.6 8.6 35.8 0 115-214 lbs OAIS &gt;3 Occupants 1661 190 123 29 343 247 113 75 537 4 % of Total Injuries 100 11.4 7.4 1.7 20.7 14.9 6.8 4.5 32.3 .2 groups. Thus, under the assumption that different injury rates are caused by different distributions of injury by body part, it cannot be concluded that observed differences in injury rates are actually significant. No factors that may possibly cause a difference in injury rates (occupant location, type of impact and body part injury) have been shown to definitely do so. Some of the incon- clusiveness is attributed to the small count of occupants in the extremes and the possible distortion caused by weighting. Thus, the overall difference in injury rates can not be supported by a significant effect of any of the factors. A significant overall difference of injury rates among height groups can not be conclusively shown with the NCSS data. OCCUPANT WEIGHT In the first analysis the partitioning by weight produced a similar effect but to a slighter degree. The rate of injury was higher in the heaviest category than in any of the others and in frontal collision accidents in particular. Again, the counts were very small in the extremes. A X2 test among all 4 weight categories gi- ves X2 = 12.27. For two categories (the heaviest and the others summed), the X2 is 6.07. Thus, the difference of the heaviest group does not account for most of the statistic; the differences are more evenly distributed. For weight, the distribution of injuries by body part was investigated as was for height. The results (Table 27) show no sig- nificant difference (X2 = 11.55, df. = 8). Thus, the conclusion, as reached previously with height, is that no evidence exists to significantly show that an injury rate difference exists. COMPARISON OF BODY INJURY DATA BY THE PAIR METHOD Review of occupant injury by cumulative count of injured body parts (Table 2) shows that only two sets exceed the significance criteria of 33 percent variation from their respective concurrent averages at the OAIS &gt; 3 and &gt; 4 levels: the injury rate of the arms group is high and the head group is low for the shortest occupant set. The risk of injury appears to be significantly different to the abdomen of the occupants of the lowest weight group and to the head of the heaviest set. To determine whether these differences are real and make engineering sense, the data was parted further into impact direction and occupant position combinations. Tables 13 through 20 show that the three most pre- dominant life-threatening injuries of nearly equal proportions (approx. 26 percent) to the driver in the frontal collision are those to the abdomen, the head and the shoulder-throax area. The right passenger experiences nearly twice the frequency of injury (36 percent) to the head as to the abdomen and the shoulder- thorax complexes. For side collision the head of the driver shows the highest rate of injury at approxi-</page><page sequence="20">630 S. H. BACKAITIS AND D. NAJJAR mately 30 percent, followed by the shoulder- thorax at 25 percent, and the abdomen at 18 percent. On the other hand, the probability of injury to the shoulder-thorax and to the head are nearly equal for the right passenger in the side collision (28 percent), followed by the abdomen at nearly 19 percent, and the neck at 15 percent. The parting of the data into four sets caused, however, excessive thinning out of the cell counts in the extreme height and weight subsets. For this reason, the entire data set was recombined and then parted into two halves : above and below 59 in. in stature and at 164 lbs. in weight, respectively. In testing the data for significance at the 33 percent variation level, no differences were found for the driver and the right passenger occupants in frontal collisions in any of the body segment categories (Tables 21 and 22). For the side impact, the legs of the driver in the height subset appear to be injured at significantly higher rates for the shortest set of people and at significantly lower rates for the tallest set (Table 23). Significant injury differences were also noted in the abdominal area in both the height and the weight groups and in the neck area for the right passenger (Table 24). Further investigation into reasons for these differences reveals, however, that these particularly large variations are caused primarily by the smallness of the respective data cells in the side impact category which tend to significantly exaggerate the differ- ences in rates of injury severity between the corresponding data cells. The continuous shift of injury rates from one body region to another as the data is being subdivided into smaller units, leads to the conclusion that these differences are not consistent. Further subsetting of already low count data in the side impact category creates such low cell counts that their size alone produces and distorts rate differences, rendering them useless for the intended analysis. From this analysis and from the trend revealed by chi square tests it is concluded that it is unlikely that the injury distribution by body parts varies signif- icantly between the respective height and weight groups. DISCUSSION The NCSS data set contains a sizable amount of information on the injury severities of adult occupants and their distribution for various heights and weights. Initial analysis of the data in coarse breakdowns appears to indicate higher rates of injury at the OAIS &gt; 3 level for the shortest set of right passengers who are involved in frontal collisions. A look at injury rates at the OAIS &gt; 4 severity level, however, does not support the conclusion. In the weight category, the initial indication of higher injury rates for the &gt; 215 lbs. occupant set at the OAIS &gt; 3 level is again not substantiated at OAIS &gt; 4 level. Further breakdowns of data by combined occupant position and impact direction, while appearing to be significant at the OAIS &gt; 3 level in some cells, were found to be inconsequential at the OAIS &gt; 4 level. Tests of the existing data for significance of differences do not provide conclusive evidence that differences between various height groups are significant. Only pooled group data indicates that the rate of injury for the smallest height group may be different from the taller occupant set (11). In performing further tests of significance by body parts, the difference between the smallest height group and the other height groups was found to be made up of an apparently large number of leg injuries in the shortest height set. Further investigation revealed, however, that the statistic was distorted by the weighting methodology of the NCSS data file. Testing the data for significance by weight produced an even lesser indication of the existence of significant differences. Thus, the overall conclusion is that, by utilizing the chi square method to test for significance, it could not be shown that injury distribution by body part varies significantly between respective height and weight groups of accident victims. Further attempts to compare the data for significant differences by using the pair comparison method also did not produce any evidence of differences in the rates of injury between the various height and weight groups. The evidence of no dependency was very strong for drivers and right side occupants in frontal collisions. In side collisions, the initially suspect difference in injury rates for the abdomen and the legs was found to be caused by distortions due to smallness of the data cells rather then being real variations between different height and weight subsets. Overall, the variations within the respective height and weight categories follow the same basic rate of injury trends. The rates for short people appear to be well lined up with the rates of low weight people and the rates for tall people are reasonably well matched with the injury rates of heavy people. The matching is considerably better within the middle height and middle weight sets than between their extreme end counterparts, where data cells are less plentiful. On the whole, it would appear that parting the occupant data into four unequal size groups for a limited data set such as the NCSS</page><page sequence="21">LIKELIHOOD OF INJURY 63 1 file, in many instances makes those groups, which are at the extreme ends of the Gaussian distribution, insignificant for analysis purposes. Distortions in the frequency of injury data distribution caused by end effects need to be identified and their significance assessed. A division of the accident population into more equally sized groups would ha ve probably provided a better visibility of the existence or non-existence of trends. While the injury rate has been found to be independent of occupant height and weight , it is still to be established that these findings would ho Id true on the national and international scales. This data set was also too small to determine whether some particular impact conditions coupled with occupant locations could produce injury rates which are height and weight dependent, such as side impact injuries to nearby vs. distant occupants, occupant's age, size and make of the vehicle, etc. CONCLUSIONS The following conclusions are evident from this study: 1. The NCSS data supports the hypothesis that car occupants are injured at essentially the same rates regardless of their physical stature and weight. 2. The occupant injury rate in frontal impacts was found to be independent of occupant stature and weight. 3. The rates of occupant injury in side impact appear to be independent of occupant stature and weight. Less certainty in this group is due primarily to the smallness of the data sample. 4. There is little difference in injury rate distribution between corresponding height and weight groups of occupants (of low weight and short stature, and of heavy weight and tall stature) . 5. Analysis of rate of injury by body segments for various impact configu- rations and occupant locations is a useful tool in tracking down data dis- tortions and in resolving arising uncertainties. 6. Injury data cell counts are either very low or empty in the lowest height and weight subsets for males, and in the highest subsets for females. 7. There is little difference in injury rates between male and female occupants in those subsets in which cell counts are substantial in size. 8. Injury rates among the unrestrained occupants are nearly equal between the two mid-size occupant groups for the stature and weight categories. 9. Injury rates appear to be similar among the restrained occupants between the two middle stature and weight groups. However, due to shortage of data, the results can not be con- sidered conclusive. 10. Although the differences due to height and weight parameters do not appear to be significant in the context of this study the differences may be important and sizeable for specific vehicles and or impact modes. RECOMMENDATIONS 1. It is recommended that other accident files be analyzed for injury rate stability due to variations in occupant height and weight. 2. It is recommended that the analyzed accident population be divided into groups of more equal size in order to assure more uniform cell counts at the extreme portions of the distribution. 3. It is recommended that the effects of weighting factors be carefully evaluated and accounted for in order to prevent possible distortions of relationships and the subsequent drawing of erroneous conclusions. 4. It is recommended that with large samples, the occupant injury rates be investigated for the whole spectrum of occupant height and weight combi- nations with respect to the occupant's position in the vehicle and also for the effects of vehicle size.
