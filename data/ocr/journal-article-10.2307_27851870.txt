<plain_text><page sequence="1">Brains, Behavior, &amp; Robotics. James S. Albus. 352 pp. McGraw-Hill, 1981. $16.95. Albus knows about robots. For quite a number of years, he has been a pioneer and pedagogue in the business of devis ing machines that perform like humans, and now he has written a book to teach us what he knows. It is a good book?not 1983 January-February 89</page><page sequence="2">comprehensive but very substantial. Easy to read, for the most part, it shows a sense of humor but is certainly not glib, and it touches a very large number of bases. It is written for the layman, for no one could be an expert over the range of topics covered, but it is thorough enough to give one a feeling of accomplishment after reading it. Albus's interest in robots is centered on control and perception, and he believes that we can learn much about how to make intelligent anthropomorphic ma chines by selective emulation of our own control mechanisms. Consequently, he starts his book by explaining how we humans work. The first few chapters are an engineer's description of the human neurological control system from mind to reflex. Not many details are omitted as we touch on such topics as dendrites, color vision, and the cerebral cortex. It is a clear and very well illustrated expla nation that leaves one with that smug 'Tm much smarter than I was" feeling. After examining himself, the reader is introduced to some methods used in modeling human functionality. A chap ter devoted to hierarchical systems gives the flavor of the field but is certainly not comprehensive. Then, in Chapter 6, Albus does his own thing?he introduces a method for modeling multivariate sys tems that he and Marr invented, which is based on mechanisms of cerebellar pro cessing. This is a difficult chapter but worth some effort. In it, Albus explains his model, describes its properties, and gives examples of its effectiveness. I would have liked more. The next chapter is devoted to high-order functionality? things like motor control and sensing, about which we know a bit, and emotion and faith, about which we know very little. The remainder of the book is devoted to robots, those which exist and those which might. The chapters survey in dustrial robotics, artificial intelligence, applications, and economic and social effects. They are a bit spotty, becoming very detailed on some topics and passing lightly over others, but they are infor mative. They round out a very well composed book which, while it reflects unabashedly the interests and prefer ences of its author, gives its readers more than their money's worth.?John Zornig, Electrical Engineering, Yale University</page></plain_text>
