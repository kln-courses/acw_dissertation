<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION IN CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY 1993-2007 By Pia Guldager Bilde, Birgitte Bogh, Soren Handberg, Jakob Munk Hojte, Jens Nieling, Tatiana Smekalova and Vladimir Stolba With contributions by Alexandre Baralis, Iulian B?rzescu, Diana Gergova, Valetina V Krapivina, Krassimir Krusteff, Vasilica Lungu and Alexander A. Maslennikov INTRODUCTION (Fig. 1) The last report, including the year 1992, (Hind 1992-1993) was published only 3 years after the fall of the Iron Curtain and the year following the collapse of the Soviet Union. This has been a decisive factor in the strongly renewed interest of Western scholars in the Black Sea region. In general since the last report, the Black Sea world has moved closer to the West. In 2004 2 of the Black Sea countries, Romania and Bulgaria, became members of NATO and on 1 January 2007 they joined the European Union. Turkey, since 1952 a member of NATO, is currently negotiating with the EU concerning the conditions of membership, and Georgia and Ukraine currently aspire to membership of NATO. The fall of the Iron Curtain also proved to be the turning point after which many collaborative projects between Eastern and Western scholars were initiated. At the institutional level this led to the formation of Black Sea research groups at several Western universities and other research institutions. The renewed interest is also reflected in several new periodicals dedicated to the Black Sea region, or at least part of it, as well as a series of publications that treat the Black Sea region from a holistic perspective and a number of international conferences and comprehensive exhibitions. Thus, knowledge of the Black Sea region in the West is decisively much better today than when the last report was made, and, as this report will show, many researchers have seized the new opportunities for East West collaboration. However, a counter current can be observed in the new millennium. After the fall of the Iron Curtain, Western scholars were optimistic about the new possi bilities for collaboration; however, due to strengthened nationalism in many Black Sea countries many East-West projects were given up after a few seasons. So in 2008, in fact, there are fewer running collaborative projects than was the case in the 1990s. This is an alarming development for the scientific investigation of the region. The anc. world plays an increasing role in the formation of new national identities, which came out of the break up of the Soviet Union. However, the new emphasis on the region and its material remains also has its draw backs. First of all, the number of illicit excavations, especially in S Russia and Ukraine, has exploded as the result of, on the one hand, increased wealth among the region's many new wealthy people, who are interested in collecting Cl antiquities, and, on the other hand, the new Western focus on the region has provided growth for the international art market. In the period covered by the present report several leading scholars in the field of archaeology of the Black Sea region passed away: Ja.V Domanskij, A. Fol, O. Lordkipanidze, D.M. Pippidi, D.B. Selov, V Velkov, Ju.G Vinogradov to mention only some of the most well known and highly esteemed in the West. The authors would sincerely like to thank the contributors to the present report: Alexandre Baralis, Iulian B?rzescu, Diana Gergova, Valetina V Krapivina, and Krassimir Krusteff, Vasilica Lungu and Alexander A. Maslennikov. We also acknowledge our indebtedness to our colleagues at the Danish National Research Foundation's Centre for Black Sea Studies: Leif Erik Vaag and Kristina W. Jacobsen for their considerable effort improving the text and to Jane Hjarl Petersen for procuring the first background material for the section on Bulgaria and Romania. The Centre's employees were responsible for the following sections: Introduction (PGB); Bulgaria (BB, PGB, D. Gergova, K. Krusteff); Romania (BB, PGB, I. B?rzescu, V. Lungu); SW Ukraine (PGB, SH, V.V. Krapivina); W and Central Crimea (VS); E Crimea (JMH, TS, A.A. Maslennikov); Maiotis, Taman', N Caucasus (TS); Georgia (JN); Turkey (JMH). P. Guldager Bilde served as general editor. INSTITUTIONS In 1995 the Eurasien-Abteilung of the DAI was established in Berlin. This research institution is engaged in the study of interrelations between the nomadic and sedentary cultures of Eurasia, and its work thus intersects with half of the Black Sea region. Currently, DAI carries out 3 archaeological field projects in the Russian part of the Black Sea region: investiga tion of Taganrog (from 2004; O. Dally, W. Rabbel, H. St?mpel, Ch. M?ller, G. Wendt, M. Ullrich, A.O. Kozin, P.A. Larenok and V.P. Kopylov), of the Kislovodsk basin in the LB A and El A (from 2006; S. Reinhold, D.S. Korobov and A.B. Belinskij) and prospection in the Taman' Peninsula (from 2007; H. Bruckner, U. Schlotzhauer, H. St?mpel and D. Zuravlev). The Eurasien Abteilung publishes the periodical Eurasia Antiqua. Zeitschrift ?r Arch?ologie Eurasiens; to date 13 volumes have appeared. The British Institute at Ankara (BIAA) supports research focused on Turkey and the Black Sea littoral in all academic disciplines within the arts, humanities and social sciences. For 3 years they financed the British Academy Black Sea Initiative (BABSI) (2002-2005). Among other projects they co-finance is the joint British-Georgian Pichvnari Expedition established in 1998, partly published by the directors M. Vickers and A. Kakhidze (2004; Kakhidze 2007). In 2000, Zentrum f?r Arch?ologie und Kulturgeschichte des Schwarzmeerraumes (ZAKS), an interdisciplinary research platform, was created by the archaeological institutes of the Martin-Luther-Universit?t in Halle-Wittenberg (directors: F. Bertemes and A. Furtw?ngler). ZAKS publishes the series Schriften des Zentrums f?r Arch?ologie und Kulturgeschichte des Schwarzmeerraumes. To date 11 volumes have been published. The organization most recently established, which is dedicated to the Black Sea region, is the Centre for Black Sea Studies, University of Aarhus (Denmark), created in 2002 by the Danish National Research Foundation (director: P. Guldager Bilde). The centre works on a grant lasting until 2010. It publishes the series Black Sea Studies of which to date 7 volumes have been published. Six of these volumes are the proceedings of international conferences hosted by the Centre (http://www.pontos.dk/publications/books). In 2003 F. Fless became Professor at Freie Universit?t in Berlin; since then a number of Black Sea activities have been hosted by that institution, such as the investigations of Alma Kermen (2003-2007; F. Fless and J. Zaycev) and Ak Kaja (2007; K. Moede and J. Zajcev) in the Crimea.</page><page sequence="2">116 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL.

Map of the Black Sea region including major sites In 2004 an American Research Centre was established in Sofia (ARCS), its first director being K. Clinton. The centre aims at facilitating academic research in Bulgaria for N American scholars and furthering collaboration between scholars from N America and the countries in SE Europe (http://www.einaudi.comell.edu/arcs/index.asp). PRINCIPAL NEW PERIODICALS AND BOOKS In the 1990s, a number of new periodicals, partly or fully dedicated to the Black Sea region in antiquity, came into being. The first was the French-Italian-Romanian periodical founded in 1994, // Mar Nero. Annali di archeologia e storia (eds P. Alexandrescu and S. Papacostea), 5 volumes of which have appeared to date. Already mentioned is Eurasia Antiqua from 1995. Also in 1995 appeared the first volume of Ancient Civilizations from Scythia to Siberia. An International Journal of Comparative Studies in History and Archaeology (eds G. Bongard-Levin, G Gnoli and A. Ivantchik). This journal covers the territory of the former Soviet Union and, in fact, much the same area as Eurasia Antiqua. To date 14 volumes have been published. One year later, the first volume of Colloquia Pontica, a series of publications on the archaeology and anc. history of the Black Sea area edited by G Tsetskhladze appeared. So far 13 volumes have been published. In 1997 followed Archaeologia Bulgarica, a periodical edited by L.F. Vagalinski and published in English by the Archaeological Institute of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, Sofia. It comes out 3 times a year. It has no restrictions as to time and territory, but the emphasis is on the archaeology of SE Europe. Ancient West &amp; East edited by GR. Tsetskhladze is ajournai devoted to the study of the peripheries of the anc. world and the relations between the Gree#ks and Romans and various local, 'barbarian' peoples. The first volume came out in 2002, and to date 5 volumes have been published. A very useful resource concerning the archaeology of Bulgaria and Romania is the multi-lingual and multi-period Fasti-online (http://www. fastionline.org/about.php). The site is a web-based GIS database that contains a basic record sheet for each site excavated. The beginning of the new millennium witnessed the publication of several important studies providing a topograph ical overview of the Black Sea region. First to be mentioned is The Barrington Atlas of the Greek and Roman World, edited by R.J.A. Talbert (Princeton 2000). This is a comprehensive atlas spanning the entire period and space of Gr and Rom civilization from ca. 1000 BC to AD 650. The atlas includes a detailed listing of periods of cultural activity, mod. names and locations, and bibliographic citations for each feature. The Black Sea region is covered by maps 22-23, 52-53, 84, 86-88, and ca. 1,300 anc. sites are briefly catalogued. Three years later, D.V. Grammenos and E.K. Petropoulos edited Ancient Greek Colonies in the Black Sea (Thessaloniki 2003) in 2 volumes. This was supplemented in 2007 by the same editors in the British Archaeological Reports International Series (Grammenos and Petropoulos 2007). Both publications are topographically organized but contain thematic chapters as well.</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 117 With a geographical approach also to be mentioned is M. Hermann Hansen and T. Heine Nielsen (eds), An Inventory of Archaic and Classical Poleis (Oxford 2004). Though the inventory is limited to the Ar and Cl periods, it provides a thorough up-to-date overview of all known poleis and similar units in the Black Sea region. Finally, at www.pontos.dk a gazetteer of anc. sites has been made available by the Danish Centre for Black Sea Studies featuring photographs of sites and finds as well as literary sources. In 1995 volume 4 of the Lexicon of Greek Personal Names including the Black Sea region was published by P.M. Fraser and E. Matthews (2005). Curated by V.N. Zin'ko, the Demeter Foundation in Kerch has initiated a complete publication of the holdings of the Kerch Archaeological Museum. So far volumes on the sculpture (Zin'ko 2004), the coin hoards (Abramzon et al. 2006) and the Ar to EHel lamps (Zuravlev, Bykovskaja and Zeltikova 2007) have appeared. To be mentioned also are the SNG volumes of the British Museum, W.M. Stancomb Collection and the National Museum in Krakow which are devoted exclusively to the Black Sea coins (Price 1993; Stancomb 2000; Bodzek 2006a). Three major contributions on amphorae have been published; 2 monographs on Gr and Black Sea amphorae found in the region (Monachov 1999; 2003), and one on late Hel and Rom amphorae of Black Sea production (Vnukov 2003). I.V. Tunkina has published a magisterial study on the research history of the old S Russia (Tunkina 2002). A sizeable resume with major additions is published in English in BSS 1 (Tunkina 2003). INTERNATIONAL CONFERENCES Since 1992 a number of open, international conferences have taken place, which merit to be mentioned. Two of these were in the outset aimed at discussing the Bosporan Kingdom, namely the Bosporan Phenomenon (Bosporskij Fenomen) held ca. every one and a halfyears in St Petersburg and the Bosporan Readings (Bosporskie Stenijd), which is annual. Thematically both conferences have developed beyond the Bosporan Kingdom so today they cover the entire region along the N littoral of the Black Sea and the most important new discoveries of the current year are made public here. Substantial abstracts have been pre-published for both conferences and many of the contributions to the Kerch conferences have later been published in full in the series Bosporskie Issledovanija edited by V.N. Zin'ko (first volume in 2001; to date 20 volumes have been published as well as 3 supplementary volumes). Unfortunately, the volumes with conference abstracts are not available on the book market, but back issues can often be bought through the conference organizers. The first St Petersburg conference on the Bosporan Phenomenon was held in 1998. It was a small, local enterprise organized on the initiative of V Chrsanovskij in the State Museum of the History of Religion and dedicated to the Bosporan Kingdom as a historical and cultural phenomenon. Since this first conference, 6 further conferences have been held: Gr culture in the periphery of the anc. world (1999); colo nization of the region, establishment of poleis and the appearance of states (2001); funerary monuments and sanctuaries (2002); problems concerning chronology and dating of monuments (2004); problems of written and archaeo logical sources (2005); and sacred meaning of regions, sites and objects (2007). The Kerch conferences are organized by V.N. Zin'ko and held in the month of May in the former capital of the Bosporan Kingdom, the first one in 2000. Only in recent years has a thematic focus been chosen: in 2004 the theme was ethnic processes; in 2005 periods of destabilizations and catastrophes; in 2006 oikos; in 2007 sanctuaries and sacred objects; and the latest in 2008 focused on militar?a. Other international conferences have not at the outset been confined thematically to a historical phenomenon such as the Bosporan Kingdom. To these belong the recurring conferences at Vani that also pre-publish abstracts. After the conferences the proceedings have been published as monographs. Since 1992 5 volumes have appeared (Sur les traces des Argonautes [1990], 1996; La mer Noire, zone de contacts [1994], 1999; Religions du Pont-Euxin [1997], 1999; Pont-Euxin et commerce: la gen?se de la 'route de la soie' [1999], 2002; Pont-Euxin et Polis: Polis hellenis et polis barbaron [2002], 2005). The publication of the 2005 conference is currently being edited. In September 2001, The Second International Congress on Black Sea Antiquities was held in Ankara, Turkey, which still awaits publication. In November 2002, the conference Les cit?s grecques, les soci?t?s indig?nes et les empires mondiaux dans la r?gion nord-pontique culturelle: origines et d?veloppe ment d'une koin? politique, ?conomique et culturelle (Vile s. av. J.-C.-III s. ap. J.-C), was held in Bordeaux, France. The conference proceedings were published in 2007 (Bresson, Ivancik and Ferrary 2007). In October 2004 the conference The Black Sea Region: Past, Present and Future was held in Istanbul, Turkey. It was published in 2007 (Erkut and Mitchell 2007). In September 2005 The Third International Congress on Black Sea Antiquities, The Black Sea Area and its Relationship with Ancient Central and Eastern Europe (1st Millennium BCSth Century AD) was held in Prague. Abstracts are available on-line at http://www.fhs.cuni.cz/ conference/blacksea2005/default.asp?id=8. Contemporary with this conference, The 11th International Symposium on the Ancient History and Archaeology of the Black Sea Area was held in Vani, Georgia. In Batumi and Trabzon, in April 2006, the conference Production and Trade of Amphorae in the Black Sea, covering the expanding field of amphora studies, was held. On 18 March 2006, the Institute of Archaeology of the Jagiellonian University hosted the conference Pontica which was preceeded by a photographic exhibition In Search of Treasures. Polish-Ukrainian Research at Koshary near Odessa at the National Museum in Cracow. Proceedings of the conference appeared under the title Pontika 2006. Recent Research in Northern Black Sea Coast Greek Colonies (Krakow 2008). In April 2008, the 2nd Pontika conference, Recent Research on the Northern and Eastern Black Sea in Ancient Times, took place in Cracow. Proceedings will be published in the BAR series. Two major international conferences scheduled for 2008 have regrettably been cancelled: the 12th Vani conference and the conference on Paphlagonia and Pontus in antiquity and the EByz period to be held in Izmir. The abstracts of the latter conference, which was cancelled with a few days notice, are available on-line (http://www.cca.unimelb.edu.au/community/ Events/PAPHLAGONIA-PONTUS-abstracts.pdf). EXHIBITIONS In 2007, the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg closed down its Black Sea exhibition for a major renovation. A number of large-scale exhibitions have made Black Sea antiquities known in the West since 1992. However, the picture promoted of the Black Sea cultures is rather biased, as the exhibitions mostly focus on gold objects found in the region.</page><page sequence="4">118 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. In 1995 the exhibition Unterwegs zum Goldenen Vlies on Georgian antiquities was held in Saarbr?cken (catalogue: Miron and Orthmann 1995). In 1998-1999, the exhibition Ancient Gold - The Wealth of the Thracians: Treasures from the Republic of Bulgaria toured the United States (catalogue: Marazov 1998). In 2000 Scythian gold was displayed in 2 competing exhibitions: The Golden Deer of Eurasia: Scythian and Sarmatian Treasures from the Russian Steppes, The Metropolitan Museum of Art, October 2000 to February 2001 (catalogue: Alekseev and Farkas 2000) and Gold of the Nomads, Scythian Treasures from Ancient Ukraine which travelled the United States from November 1999 to August 2001 and ended in Paris (catalogue: Reeder 2000). Also in 2001 the exhibition Georgien - Sch?tze aus dem Land des Goldenen Vlies was held in Bochum (catalogue: Gambashidze et al. 2001). From February to July 2004 the exhibition Greek Gold - From the Treasure Chambers of the Hermitage celebrated the opening of the Hermitage Amsterdam, a dependency of the Hermitage Museum of St Petersburg on the River Amstel in Amsterdam. The exhibition Die Thraker - Das goldene Reich des Orpheus could be seen in the Kunst- und Ausstellungshalle der Bundesrepublik Deutschland at Bonn from July 2004 to January 2005 (Catalogue: Fol et al. 2004). From October 2004 to February 2005 the large exhibition Gold Treasures -Romania in 7,000 years was shown in Medelhavsmuseet, Stockholm (catalogue: Slej, S?rling and Popovici 2004). In connection with the Danish Queen Margrethe's visit to Bulgaria and the return visit of the Bulgarian president to Denmark, the rich finds made in Bulgarian tombs in 2004 and 2005, e.g., of the magnificent portrait probably of King Seuthes III (Fig. 6), were exhibited for a short period in April 2006 at the Danish National Museum. While the Odessa Archaeological Museum was closed for refurbishment, a significant part of its holdings was exhibited in Cracow: Treasures from the Black Sea. Gold, Sculpture and Ceramics from the Museum of Archaeology in Odessa, National Museum in Krakow, March to June 2006 (catalogue: Bodzek 2006b). It was also the closure for renovation of the Black Sea exhibition in the State Hermitage Museum that made possible the encompassing exhibition Greeks on the Black Sea: Ancient Art from the Hermitage in the J. Paul Getty Museum at the Getty Villa, Malibu, June to September 2007 (catalogue: Trofimova and Kalashnik 2007). Thus 2007 was a great year for Black Sea exhibitions. Apart from the previously mentioned exhibition in Malibu, 2 exhibitions could be enjoyed in Berlin: Im Zeichen des Goldenen Greifen - K?nigsgr?ber der Skythen (catalogue: Parzinger et al. 2007) and Griechen - Skythen - Amazonen, a joint exhibition by Freie Universit?t Berlin and the Staatliche Museen zu Berlin in the Pergamon Museum, June to October (catalogue: K?stner, Langner and Rabe 2007). In the Antikenmuseum Basel and Sammlung Ludwig the exhibition Die alten Zivilisationen Bulgariens - Das Gold der Thraker was open to the public from March to July in the same year (catalogue: Nikolov et al. 2007). Crossing the Atlantic, the exhibition Wine, Worship and Sacrifice: The Golden Graves of Ancient Vani - Treasures from the Republic of Georgia was shown at the Smithsonian Institute in Washington DC from December 2007 to February 2008 (catalogue: Kacharava and Kvirkvelia 2008). From March to June 2008 it has been exhibited at the Institute for the Study of the Ancient World, New York University, and from June to September 2008 it was on display at the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston. The exhibition has foremost featured the finds from 4 newly found rich graves unearthed in Vani in 2004. This is the first time that archaeological finds from Georgia have been brought to the United States. Some of the finds have previously been shown in Tblisi and are illustrated in the catalogue edited by D. Kacharava et al., Colchis - Land of Golden Fleece (Tbilisi 2005). This smaller exhibition was earlier presented at 3 venues in Europe, in Berlin, Paris and Nice. BULGARIA (Fig. 2) Since 1991, changes in the official governmental funding of archaeological research have lead to a decrease in the systematic excavations in Bulgaria, but due to increased building activities the number of rescue excavations has risen considerably (Cholakov and Chukalev 2008, 144). Thus, in 2006 rescue excavations amounted to half of the archaeological fieldwork carried out on the Bulgarian Black Sea coast (Cholakov and Chukalev 2008, 146). Institutions The National Institute of Archaeology of the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences, with its museum (NIAM), coordinates the archaeological research over the entire territory of Bulgaria, and the Interagency Council of Field Research of NIAM appointed by the Minister of Culture issues permits for archae ological fieldwork in Bulgaria. The annual documentation of the archaeological investigations is kept in the Research Archives of NIAM. Presently this amounts to 812 collections covering sites investigated during the last 50 years. A National Automated Informational System 'Archaeological Map of Bulgaria' is also hosted at NIAM. The Centre for Underwater Archaeology in Sozopol organizes underwater investigations and the symposia Thracia Pontica and Pontica Mediaevi. Conferences and principal publications Conference activity and publications have continued since 1993 with a growing international outlook reflected both in the number of international participants and the focus on Thracian interrelations with other cultures. The main conferences were: La Thrace et les soci?t?s maritimes anciennes, 1994 (Thracia Pontica 1997); Thracians and Phrygians: Problems of Parallelism, 1995 (Tuna, Akture and Lynch 1998); The Thracian World at the Crossroads of Civilization, 1996 (Roman 1997); Thrace and the Aegean, 2000 (Fol 2002) and The Culture of Thracians and their Neighbours (Bouzek and Domaradzka 2005). Various Bulgarian periodicals can be consulted for new archaeological finds in Bulgaria, the most important ones being published by the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences. Thus NIAM is responsible for Helis (vols 3-5), Arheologia and the annual reports of ongoing fieldwork in the country Archeologiceski Otkritija i Razkopki, as well as Razkopki i proucvanija and Izvestija na Archeologiceskija Institut (see more on their website http://aim.sofianet. net/main.php?lang=ENG) in addition to Archaeologia Bulgarica mentioned in the introduction, whereas since 1993 the Institute of Thracology (http://www.thracologia.org/ publice.html) in Sofia has published vols 10-17 of Thracia, vols 6-8 of Studia Thracica, vol. 10 of Thracia Antiqua (in Bulgarian) and vols 5-15 o? Orpheus. For inscriptions, see the addendum to G. Mihailov's IGBulg (Banev et al 1999; 2001). A survey of new developments in Bulgarian archaeology and an extensive list of references and publications can be found in Stoyanov and Lozanov (n.d.), and in Cholakov and Chukalev 2008 (concerning the year 2006). Detailed information on various Gr and Rom sites in Bulgaria and Romania (as well as other countries), including maps, discoveries made since 2000 and information about research teams, can be found at http : //www. fastionline. org/.</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 119 Sborianovo Albesti # Kallatis Durankulak Dionysopolis Bizone .Smiadovo Odessos Kazanlakj Ostru?a Pistiros .Alexandrovo Mesembria Anchialos Kabyle Burgas Deultum# # Apollonia Pontike ?

Map of S Romania and Bulgaria with sites mentioned in the text # Thynias Agathopolis (Ahtopol') Sporadic rescue excavations in Ahtopol' have revealed the stratigraphy of the anc. town from the 5th Ct BC until the Med period. Part of the town's LRom and Med wall has been inves tigated (AOR [1990], 81-82; [1992], 62). The 1999-2000 excavations were directed by D. Gergova. A tumulus with a rich burial of the Hel period and later burials from the ist-2nd Ct AD near Sinemorec S of the town most probably belongs to the still unexcavated anc. town (AOR [1996], 40-41; [2007], 77-78; [2008], 233-34). Cape Urdovisa Thracian and Gr pottery from the 5th-4th Ct BC, as well as from the 5th Ct AD and the Med period, has been found on Cape Urdovisa near Kiten (AOR [2008], 454-62). Archaeological surveys have been organized in the territory of the Ropotamo National park, where several Thracian sanctuaries have been localized (AOR [2003], 109). Apollonia Pontike (SozopoP) During rescue excavations in Sozopol' new data about the town planning, the architecture and the stratigraphy of the town have been revealed (AOR [2007], 353-58). The necropoleis of Apollonia Pontike are among the best studied on the entire W coast. To date 916 graves have been unearthed (Cholakov and Chukalev 2008, 167-68). We thank A. Baralis, A. Hermary, K. Panayotova and A. Riapov for the following information on the necropolis of Kalfata situated S of the city walls and dating from the M5th-M3rd Ct BC (Figs 3,4). Two hundred and eighty graves and a large number of deposits with funeral artefacts have been found during the last 10 years. Most typical among the grave goods were fragrance vessels: Attic and local hydriai (Fig. 5), lekythoi, askoi, alabastra and ung?entar?a. Amphorae (mainly from Herakleia Pontike and Thasos), jugs, oinochoai, dishes and lamps were also common. The grave goods were almost always ritually mutilated. Terracotta figurines were found together with strigils, mirrors, astragals and jewellery. In a few instances, reburial or cremation performed outside the graves could be documented (K. Panayotova, D. Nedev, A. Hermary, 2004 excavations, Fasti-online). Most common were the pit graves with inhumation burials. Traces of repeated post-burial rituals at the grave testify to the tradition of performing memorial rites for the deceased. More detailed information on the finds can be found in Panayotova 1998; Panayotova, Riapov and Baralis 2006; Hermary 2007; AOR (2007), 364-68. Several tumuli from the Hel period on Cape Kolokita S of Apollonia reveal Thracian burial rites (AOR [2007], 234, 244, 307; [2008], 309-31). A number of Kyzikene silver coins have been found in different hoards in the region between Apollonia and Nessebar, all from the 4th Ct BC. In 1998 a hoard containing silver coins of Kyzikean origin was found in the chora of Mesembria, and in 2000 another hoard was found in Apollonia (Karayotov 2007). Deultum (Debelt) Investigations of Deultum, founded by Vespasian, comprise excavations of the Rom and Byz fortress as well as excavations of the Thracian tumular necropolis. This necropolis was very long-lived with burials from the LBA and EIA, and the Rom period between the 1st and 5th Ct AD (AOR [2007], 241-42). Burgas A Thracian fortress by Lake Mandra near Burgas has been studied, and materials from the EIA as well as from the 3rd quarter of the 4th-E3rd Ct BC have been found (AOR [2008], 308, 427-28).</page><page sequence="6">120 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL.

Apollonia Pontike: map of the location of the necropoleis Tumuli from the Rom period, lst-4th Ct AD, have been studied near the village of Fakia (AOR [1995], 101; [1996], 45). Excavations of a Thracian cult complex by Manastir Tepe near the Burgas mineral baths have unearthed stone buildings, fireplaces, and Thracian and Gr pottery dated to the 3rd-2nd Ct BC (AOR [1995], 70-71). Anchialos (Pomorie) Archaeological excavations preceeded by geophysical prospection have been initiated in Pomorie. Part of the Rom city's street grid and several buildings, as well as Med structures have been found. Rescue excavations near the village of Medovo of a tumulus belonging to Anchialos' necropolis contained a cremation from the 2nd Ct AD (AOR [2005]). Mesembria (Nessebar) Buildings from the Cl, Hel and Med periods have been found, as well as new Gr inscriptions (AOR [2007], 273-75). The latest volume of the Nessebar series, Nessebre III, was published in 2005 after a long delay (Velkov and Karayotov 2005). This volume includes mostly finds from before 1993, but is recommended for giving a good overview of the excavated town which included temples of Zeus and Apollo, the city archive, a theatre and private houses. Excavations in the necropolis continue. In 2007, a grave with a terracotta figurine, probably Kybele, was discovered. Other finds from this site are published in AOR 2007 and 2008. K. Krusteff kindly reports that an archaeological expedition in the municipality of Nessebar was organized by Prof. I. Karayotov and himself in 2006-2007. The expedition explored the valley of the River Hadzijka, situated in the territory of the Mesembrian chora and inhabited by Greeks and Thracians settled in numerous small katoikiai. Pottery, mainly pithoi and roof tiles, was found. A fortified site inhabited from the IA through to Hel times was found in the territory of the village of Orizare. Another fortification from the Rom period was discovered 500m E, in which pieces of ceramic Rom pipes were found, possibly the remains of an aqueduct. On the left bank of the Poroy Reservoir, a small necropolis with 5 mounds was located. A coin hoard of 31 bronze coins minted in Mesembria was found in Snjagovo, in the region of Burgas, dating from 125-100 BC, and published by I. Karayotov in 2007 (Karayotov 2007, 148; AOR [2007], 304-05). Karayotov also published the gold and silver coinage of Mesembria (1994). Archaeological survey in the area of Mesembria was carried out in 2000 (AOR [2001], 115).</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 121 * m Ktf, 3D--.

Apollonia Pontike: rf Attic hydria from the Kalfata necropolis Odessos (Varna) Drilling sondages in the botanical garden of Varna in 2004 revealed a single course of a stone wall and 3 dolia arranged parallel to it. Three pits N of the dolia were excavated. The investigations seem to suggest that a Rom villa existed at this locality and most likely a small settlement appeared around the villa during L antiquity. Coins of Valentinian II (AD 375-392) and Theodosius II (AD 408-450) and small finds from the excavation indicate that the building was used from the 2nd half of the 4th-6th Ct AD (V Slavchev, H. Kuzov Fasti-online). Near the Rom baths, excavations revealed the decumanus paved with slabs and a drain faced with slabs below it. A later street-covering consisting of rubble, sherds and fragmentary building terracottas was preserved in a few places over the slabs of the decumanus in which 4 bronze coins of the end of the 4th Ct AD were found. The decumanus had at least 3 construction phases during the Rom and the EByz periods. During the 2 earlier phases, the street was paved with slabs, while the drain belongs to the 2nd phase. Furthermore, remains of L antique buildings were discovered N and S of the street (H. Kuzov and K. Sokolova Fasti-online). In August 2002, a shipwreck was identified off the coast of Odessos by a joint US-Bulgarian research expedition headed by D. Coleman and P. Dimitrov (http://news.nationalgeo graphic. com/news/2003/01/0110_030113_blacksea.html). A single amphora was recovered from the wreck, which contained bones of a large freshwater catfish species with cutting marks and several olive stones. When found, the amphora was dated to the '5th-3rd Ct BC. However, the organic material has reputedly been dated by radiocarbon analysis to between ca. 487 and 277 BC (Lund and Gabrielsen [2005], 164), but the amphora itself still awaits publication in order to confirm this dating, which is cmcial as evidence of Black Sea maritime trade. According to the opinion of the amphora specialists M. Lawall and A. Opait, the amphora should be dated to the 2nd Ct AD. Dionysopolis (Balcik) In the spring of 2006, a team of archaeologists uncovered the foundations of a Hel temple of Kybele on the fringes of the mod. city of Balcik. The preserved walls of the temple are at least 2.5m h., and the foundation of the building is large compared to other similar buildings of the same age. The excavations within the temple revealed several Kybele reliefs, a pediment with a bust of Helios, 2 statues of naked men, of a woman (possibly a priestess) and an near life-size statue of the goddess, as well as an altar. Several inscriptions were found dating from the time of the construction in the 4th Ct BC to the 4th Ct AD, including official documents and votive inscriptions, all currently being treated by N. Sharankov. The Kybele repre sentations and epithets are in typical Hel style, except for the hitherto unattested appelation Kybele Pontia. The inscriptions reveal Gr, Thracian and Rom names. A limestone slab with a lion figure has also been found, as has a 0.5m h. Doric column with a well-preserved inscription addressed to the Rom emperor Licinius. The report on the finds is published in Lazarenko, Mirceva, Enceva and Sharankov in AOR (2008). Rescue excavations of a tumulus at Taushan Yuk near Balcik have disclosed a stone tomb with a cremation. The tomb, dating to the L4th-E3rd Ct BC contained amphorae, lamps and weapons (AOR [2008], 300-01). Bizone (Kavarna) During underwater investigations in the area of Kavama's harbour, amphorae from the Hel, Rom and Byz periods, as well as lead anchors, were discovered (AOR [1994], 93-94; [2002], 80). Remains of a sunken quarter of Rom Bizone were discovered during underwater archaeological explorations in the harbour of Kavama in 2004 (A. Salkin and P. Georgiev Fasti-online). A series of stone blocks were found 6m under the sea level as well as a well-preserved anc. millstone and other building remains. It is assumed that a large administra tive building, storehouses or a harbour installation existed on this location during the Rom period (A. Salkin and P. Georgiev Fasti-online). Excavations at Cape Cirakman near Kavama have revealed part of a large building from the 6th-E7th Ct AD. Fragmentary Hel and Rom pottery, Hel amphora stamps, a head of a terracotta figurine and coins of Dionysopolis minted in the 3rd and 2nd Cts BC were found within the EByz occupation level. Trial trenches on the E slope of Cape Cirakman revealed a fortification wall defending the lower suburb (I. Sotirov and I. Gatev Fasti-online). Another monumental building was discovered on the S slope of the cape. The amphorae found in connection with this stratum were imported from Thasos, Herakleia Pontike, Sinope, Rhodos, Knidos and Kos. The earliest strata contained fragments of local Grey Ware vessels and Gr pottery dated to the 4th Ct BC. Two other groups date to the same period: local brick-coloured ceramic vessels and Celtic pottery. This last group, and the fragmentary glass bracelets of Celtic type found during the previous excavations, raises the question of the presence of Celtic ethnic groups in the hinterland of Bizone (M. Tonkova, C. Landes, A. Salkin and M. Doncheva Fasti-online).</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 123 Excavations of the L antique fortress at Timum near Kavarna provide evidence for the existence of settlements from the Hel, EByz and Med periods (AOR [2008], 454-58). A Thracian settlement with abundant finds of amphorae from the Hel period has been registered on a high plateau near the village of Top?la (AOR [1995], 121). Traces of a Thracian settlement from the EIA were found beneath a Thraco-Rom sanctuary and a church from the 4th Ct AD near Top?la (AOR [2008], 498-501). Durankulak Durankulak, situated on the coast in the NE corner of Bulgaria, has been excavated for decades under the direction of H. Todorova. An overview of the research results from 1974? 2005 can be found in Todorova 2007, which includes the finds from the Hel period, monuments, pottery, stamps, burials, etc. THRACIAN INLAND SITES A good overview of the Odrysian Kingdom is provided in the recent monograph by Z. Archibald, The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford 1998). Helis? (Sborianovo) The investigations of the religious and political centre of the Getai, founded at the end of the 2nd millennium BC, began in 1982 under the direction of M. Cicikova and have been continued since 1996 by a team directed by D. Gergova. The site is of a dispersed type and consists of several sanctuaries from the ?A, a Hel town, an EIA tumular necropolis, a Hel necropolis of more than 100 tumuli and several sacred places (Stoyanov 2002; 2003; Gergova 2004; Stoyanov et al 2006; Cholakov and Chukalev 2008, 160-62; Helis 3-5; annual report in AOR). The city is situated on a plateau surrounded on 3 sides by the River Krapinec and enclosed by a massive forti fication system (Cholakov and Chukalev 2008, fig. 20). The main fortification wall was about 1,400m /., built of large, roughly-worked blocks of local limestone. Two main gates have been found to the S and N. Three diateichismata with separate entrances have also been identified. In 1996 the inner fortification wall was investigated. The fortified area of the plateau was densely built over. Recently a residential quarter situated W and NW, as well as on terraces in front of the S wall outside the fortified area, was unearthed. There are 2 main phases of the city. It emerged in the last quarter of the 4th Ct BC and was destroyed by an earthquake around 250 BC. Seemingly life was resumed in the city, but on a more modest scale by the end of the 3rd or the beginning of the 2nd Ct BC until the \{ Ct BC. Two sanctuaries on the high plateau of Kamen Rid in the courtyard of the Demir Baba monastery were founded towards the end of the 2nd millennium BC and reconstructed in the Hel period. Here ritual pits, clay hearths, stone circles and a small absidal building have been discovered, as well as abundant Thracian and imported pottery, cult objects, etc. (Balanska 1998; Gergova 2004). The excavations of the Hel necropolis, initiated in 1982 with the discovery of the Sveshtari tomb, have continued till now. The 20 tumuli excavated since 1982 reveal a variety of stone tombs with sliding doors, cist graves, urns and a complex system of burial rites corresponding to a specific social hierarchy. The architecture of the tombs indicates the long distant contacts of the Getai with W Asia Minor, S Italy and Palestine. A Celtic sword, fibulae and bracelets testify to a Celtic presence. Pistiros (Vetren) Since 1988, excavations of Pistiros have been undertaken by a team of Bulgarian, British (from 1992), Czech (1993) and French (from 1997) archaeologists under the direction of M. Domaradzki. Architectural remains of a fortified settlement dated to the 5th-2nd Ct BC have been unearthed. The name of the site became known as Pistiros, the emporion, thanks to a M4th Ct BC inscription in Gr found in 1990 (Velkov and Domaradzka 1994; SEG 43,486). The inscription made shortly after the death of the Thracian king Kotys I in 359 BC records the rights which the Thracian authorities granted to the Gr resident traders living in the town. Seemingly the town was founded by merchants from the island of Thasos under the first kings of the Odrysian state, Teres or Sitalkes. Large amounts of Gr amphorae, as well as hundreds of bronze and silver coins, discovered during the excavations shed light on its internal and external trade contacts with the Odrysian rulers and the Gr centres on the Pontic coast and in the Mediterranean. In 1999, 552 silver and gold coins issued by Alexander the Great, Demetrios Poliorketes, Lysimachos, Lysimacheia and Seleukos I were discovered. The final destruction of the city is well dated by a large hoard of 561 coins, mainly minted by Lysimachos including his last issues, and by swords and spearheads of Celtic types and a late Duchcov fibula found in the destruction layers. They reveal that the city was completely destroyed by the Celtic campaign led by Kommontorios in 279/8 BC (Bouzek et al. 2002). No cultural layer post-dating the destruction has been discovered. Graffiti on Thracian and Gr pottery suggest that the inhabitants were of mixed ethnic origins. The results of the excavations are published in the series Emporion Pistiros in Bulgarian (3 volumes to date) as well as in the Pistiros series published in English and French (vol. I, 1996; vol. II, 2002). Kazanlak The most spectacular find occurred in the so-called Valley of the Odrysian Kings near Kazanlak where in 2004 a large tomb was found, which has been identified as the mausoleum of Seuthes III (330-301 BC), the king who built the Thracian capital Seuthopolis. In front of the entrance of the tomb, a marvellous over life-size bronze portrait interpreted as Seuthes III was found (Fig. 6). Inside the tomb, where no human remains were found, a gold wreath, a helmet with the inscription 2EY0OY, weapons, gold and silver vessels, etc. were found. An earlier tumulus, called Svetitsata, located not far from the one just mentioned, contained bronze armour, silver and bronze vessels, Gr pottery and a male funerary mask of solid gold weighing almost 700gr. Ostrusa Several new painted tombs have been unearthed. In particular, the L4th Ct BC tomb at Ostrusa near Sipka will be mentioned, which was excavated in 1993 (Kitov and Krasteva 1994-1995; Valeva 2005). The complex consists of a rectangular monolithic burial chamber resting on a 3-stepped podium. Inside, against the N wall of the chamber, a stone-built kline with carved legs was still standing. The coffered ceiling of the chamber was carved and painted in imitation of wood and separated by painted coffer panels with scenes pertaining to the thiasoi of Achilles and Dionysos. The burial chamber was subsequently incorporated, perhaps soon after, into a rectangular, multi-room complex consisting of 3 rectangular chambers and a circular room, possibly a heroon. In one of the chambers a horse burial, iron weapons, silver harness fittings and silver and bronze vessels were found.</page><page sequence="10">124 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. 6. Kazanlak: over life-sized bronze portrait, perhaps of the Thracian king Seuthes III (330-301 BC) found outside a monumental tomb near Kazanlak in 2004 Alexandrovo One of the most important discoveries of Thracian tumuli was made at the village of Alexandrovo in the Chaskovo region in LI999 and it excavated between 2000 and 2003 (http://www. coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/Regional/SEE/IRPPSAAH/FS/FS _Bulgaria_ThracianTomb_Alexandrovo_APP.pdf). In the dromos a frieze with 2 similar scenes depicts a horseman fighting a warrior on foot above a panel of marble imitation. In the W lunette of the small antechamber another image of a horseman fighting a standing figure is depicted. In the central chamber, the decoration of the walls and the dome consists of several horizontal bands in red, black, white and yellow, and 2 friezes with various scenes. The lower frieze is badly damaged and only 4 human figures taking part in a funerary or heroic feast with table and utensils are still visible. The upper frieze contains 4 hunting scenes, including 4 horsemen, 4 hunters on foot attacking 2 deer and 2 boars pursued by 9 dogs. Across the entrance a 2-line graffito was incised on the wall-paintings in Gr ca. 1.7m above the floor of the chamber in the style of a Gr funerary inscription reading: Kozimases chrestos (Kitov 2004; Sharankov 2005). The tomb is comparable to the Kazanlak tomb and it provides us with a new centre of painted Thracian ?lite tombs. Smiadovo Very few Gr epitaphs have been found in the Thracian interior, but recently an epitaph written on an architrave of a monumental tomb in the surroundings of the village of Smiadovo, in the Sumen district, was discovered. The inscription dated to the L4th-E3rd Ct BC reads: 'Gonimaseze, wife of Seuthes' (Atanasov and Nedelcev 2002). Perperikon Research in the Rhodope mountains in S Bulgaria, initiated in 2000, has identified Thracian Perperikon, a large multi-period site in use from the Chai period until the Middle Ages. The site is a fortified hilltop settlement. An unroofed, oval hall with a round altar carved out of the rock, niches, artificially made caves, basins, channels and rock-cut steps support the theory that this site functioned also as a sanctuary (Ovtcharov 2005; www.perperikon.bg). Kabyle Kabyle, a Thracian settlement situated 70km from the coast, was established by Philip II as a Macedonian outpost; later it served as a Thracian royal residence until it was conquered by the Romans in the 1st Ct BC. Since it was never built over by a mod. city, it is an ideal site for excavations. Earlier research has revealed a Thracian mountain sanctuary and a Thracian city with town houses modelled after contemporary Gr standards (Archibald 1999, 441-44). In 2003, Bulgarian archaeologists excavated a building from the Hel period (sector V). The building lies below the foundations of a L antique horreum. It was built in the 3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC. After destruction by fire at the end of the 4th Ct BC, the building was recon structed only to be demolished finally around the M3rd Ct BC. Attic pottery and amphorae from Chios, Herakleia, Thasos, Kos and Rhodes were found, as well as coins of Alexander the Great, Seuthes III, Antiochos II Theos and Mesembria (L. Getov, K. Rabadzhiev, I. Lozanov and S. Bakardzhiev Fasti online). In 2007, a joint Australian-American-Bulgarian research team directed by S. Ross and A. Sobotkova began investigations at the site with the aim of determining the level of Gr and Rom impact on the indigenous population (see www.einaudi.cornell.edu/arcs/ARCSNEWSLETTER2007.pdf) and a systematic survey was conducted in the area around the settlement (AOR [2007]; [2008], 420-27). ROMANIA During the period of reporting the number of excavations has increased considerably, partly because of rescue excavations. Romanian field archaeology has become the responsibility of the Ministry of Culture in consultation with the National Commission for Archaeology which consists mainly of museum employees. Since 2000 the reorganization of archae ological research in Romania has led to direct political involvement in its activity. Publications Although generally delayed, archaeological academic periodicals have continued to appear and even more new periodicals have entered the international academic circuit. From the IAB, the periodicals Dacia. Nouvelle Serie, Studii si cercet?ri de istorie veche si arheologie (SCIVA), Thraco Dacica, Studii si cercet?ri numismatice (SCN) and Materiale si cercet?ri arheologice (MCA) contain numerous contributions on Dobrudjan antiquity. Brief reports on rescue or research excavations have been published in Cr?nica cercet?rilor</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 125 arheologice din Romania (CCA), edited by the Ministry of Culture and easily accessible on the internet (http://archweb.cimec.ro/scripts/ARH/ Cronica/selen.asp). Cr?nica is an internet database containing more than 2,000 archaeological reports on excavations undertaken between 1983 and 2006 at 703 archaeological sites in Romania, accompanied by illustrations and maps. Most of the contribu tions are in Romanian, but about a quarter of the reports have abstracts in English or French. The periodicals of the museums in Tulcea and Constanta, Peuce and Pontica, are especially important for the area under discussion. Pontica has recently been posted on the internet as well. To a large extent Romanian archaeology has remained an auxiliary science to historical research. An overall synthesis for the period under discussion is missing, but 2 exhaustive studies stand out. One is the study of M. Oppermann (2004) about the W Pontic colonies and the indigenous world before the Rom conquest (7th-1st Ct BC), the other consists of the first 2 volumes of Istoria Rom?nilor (2001), a collective study edited by the Romanian Academy (reviewed by A. Niculescu in Dada [2004-2005]). Other studies are concerned with shorter periods, for example the 7th-4th Ct BC (Buzoianu 2001 ). Papers on the founding, the organization and relations of the W Pontic Gr cities have increased in number (e.g., Avram 1996b; Nawotka 1997; Avram 1999a; Ruscu 2002; Avram, Hind and Tsetskhladze 2004; Ivantchik 2005; Petropoulos 2005). The same can be said about the later periods; there are a number of essays of historical synthesis (Zahariade 2006). Numerous studies focus on broader themes concerning the territory of Dobrudja, such as economic exchanges between the Greeks and the local population from the hinterland in the 7th 3rd Ct BC (Banari 2003), rural life in the lst-4th Ct AD (Baumann 1995a; B?rbulescu 2001), trade in the lst-3rd Ct AD (Bounegru 2002), fortifications from the same period (Zahariade and Gudea 1997), LRom cities in the 4th-6th Ct AD (S?mpetru 1994) and E Christianity (Lungu 2000a). Only a few studies are concerned with archaeological themes exclusively, such as sculpture of the Rom period (Covacef 2002), Rom funerary stelae (Conrad 2004) or depictions of the Thracian rider (Oppermann 2006). Another category of studies is anthologies regarding the archaeology of the W Pontic colonies (Alexandrescu 1999; Avram and Babe? 2000) or N Dobrudja (Simion 2003). V Cojocaru has published an epigraphical studiy of names in the W Pontic region (2004) and, in the field of numismatics, numerous publi cations concern the production and circulation of coins (e.g., Preda 1998; Vertan 2002; Poenaru Bordea 2004) and several catalogues have been published (SNG BM IX. 1; SNG Stancomb). Conferences Although having little international impact, the number of conferences has multiplied, and some of them are held annually. The Pontica meetings organized by MINAC held at the beginning of October unite Romanian specialists and lately also more and more archaeologists from abroad. Another annual meeting is the session for archaeological reports, organized by the Ministry of Culture in various places in Romania. A number of meetings have addressed specific subjects; thus numismatics is often discussed in the symposia organized by IAB at Chi?inau in the Republic of Moldavia; the Museum of Tulcea has been involved in organizing colloquia on funerary archaeology; a colloquium on ethnicity and cultural exchanges was held 2005 in Ia?i, and another regarding the local production of ceramics in the W Pontic Gr colonies took place in Bucharest in 2004. Kallatis (Mangalia) Kaliatis is situated on the coast 10km N of the Bulgarian border. Since the city is located under the mod. city of Mangalia, only small-scale rescue excavations can be carried out. Even though the literary and epigraphical sources seem to agree on a foundation date towards the end of the 6th Ct BC, the archaeological discoveries made so far only provide evidence of a later date at the beginning of the 4th Ct BC. Building elements pertaining to cult buildings of Hel date have been unearthed (P?slaru and Colesniuc 2004-2005b, 413-18). Rescue excavations have taken place in the Hel and Rom necropoleis (P?slaru and Colesniuc 2004-2005a; Radu 2007). More than 100 tombs from the Hel necropolis of Kallatis have been published, the oldest of which date to the 3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC (Avram 2007, 243). In 2000, new excavations were initiated in the Rom-Byz necropolis of Kallatis. The 168 tombs found so far are published by M. Ionescu, N. Alexandru and R. Constantin (2002-2003). A new corpus of Gr and Rom inscriptions from Kallatis (ISM III) has been published by A. Avram (1999), who has published extensively on several other subjects regarding the city (Avram 2007). A discussion on the topography is provided in Alexandru et ai (2004-2005); on the water supply (Papuc 2007). Avram has also written a monograph on the relationship between Rome and Kallatis and the foedus signed by the 2 cities just before 100 BC (Avram 1999a). A few studies on ceramics (Buzoianu and B?rbulescu 2004-2005) and amphora stamps have been published. Albe?ti Excavations have taken place at Albe?ti, located in the W periphery of the territory of Kallatis (R?dulescu et al. 2002). It is a fortified settlement site with several large house complexes. Its centre is constituted of a rectangular fortification of ca. 40m x 40m, extended later to 45m x 45m, with a corner tower of 9m x 9m. Founded in the first half of the 4th Ct BC, the fortifica tion has 3 main phases: the first 2 phases date to the 4th Ct BC; the 3 rd phase, representing an extension of the fortified area to the S, dates to the 3rd Ct BC. The structures inside the fortified area date to the same centuries. There are 2 periods of intense activity: the first one dating to the end of the 4th Ct and E3rd Ct BC, and the 2nd one dating to the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC. The inhabitants seem to have been of mixed ethnic origin (Buzoianu, B?rbulescu and Chelut? Georgescu 2000-2001; Fasti-online'. A?ezarea fortificata de la Albe?ti - La Cetate). Almost every volume of the periodical Pontica contains an article about discoveries from this site. The first monograph is currently in print (due to appear in 2008). Tropaeum Traiani (Adamclissi) In the territory around Tropaeum Traiani settlements of the Rom and pre-Rom periods have been investigated, for instance a Hel settlement at ?ipote (CCA [2008]). Tomis (Constanta) The anc. city of Tomis is built over by the mod. town of Constanta. Increasing mod. building activities hinder systematic research of the anc. monuments. Numerous discoveries, e.g., of inscriptions, sculpture and ceramics, are published in Pontica. Dug-outs from the first half of the 5th Ct BC situated in the Cathedral Park have been unearthed. Among the main archaeological projects are excavations in the Hel (Bucoval? 1995-1996), the Rom and LRom necropolis (CCA [2007]), the city wall with the main gate and Hel and Rom houses (CCA [2007]).</page><page sequence="12">126 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. The extent of anc. Tomis and its chora has been compared to that of Istros to the N and Kallatis in the S, but unlike these, no systematic excavations have been conducted on the settlements in the territory (Buzoianu and B?rbulescu 2007). A quadriburgium (53m x 41.3m) from the 6th Ct AD has been investigated at Ovidiu, 10km N of Tomis (Fig. 7). The site lies on the coast and had a harbour. Several discoveries of LAr (Klazomenian transport amphorae) and Hel date indicate earlier occupation. During the 16 archaeological campaigns, the forti fications, a Ch basilica and several LRom houses have been excavated. In 2003, a hoard (named Constanta-Obor, hitherto unpublished) of 6,500 coins and 500 coin fragments was found in a ceramic vessel in a suburban area. The earliest coins date from the time of Licinius, the latest were issues of Valens and Valentinian, and the hoard was probably buried in advance of a Gothic attack in 378 AD (Buzoianu and B?rbulescu 2007, 320). 0 5 10m i *.t 1. Tomis, Ovidiu: quadriburgium 2003 Istros/Histria (Sinoe) The archaeological site of Istros was discovered by V. P?rvan in 1914 and has enjoyed a long history of systematic investiga tions. In contrast to earlier times, archaeological research has recently been concentrated almost exclusively inside the city, and all the historical periods are attested. Since 1990 excavations at the site have been directed by P. Alexandrescu and A. Suceveanu (both IAB) and from 1999 by A. Suceveanu alone. The finds are published in the Histria series. Eight volumes of Histria have been printed since 1993: Avram 1996 (Histria VIII. Les timbres amphoriques 1 [Thasos]), Conovici 1998 (Histria VIII. Les timbres amphoriques 2 [Sinope]), Suceveanu 1999-2000 (Histria X. La c?ramique romaine des Ier-IIIe si?cles ap. J.-C), Domaneantu 1999-2000 (Histria XI. Les bols hell?nistiques ? d?cor en relief), Alexandrescu Vianu 2003 (Histria IX. Les statues et les reliefs en pierre), Alexandrescu 2005 (Histria VII. La zone sacr?e d'?poque 8. Istros/Histria: Hel marble relief from the sacred area 2002 grecque [fouilles 1915-1989]), M?rgineanu C?rstoiu 2006 (Histria XII. Architecture grecque et romaine) and Suceveanu 2007 (Histria XIII. La basilique episcopate). Of these, Domaneantu 1999-2000 and Suceveanu 1999-2000 are available on-line at http://archweb.cimec.ro/Web-Histria/ 6bibliografie/bibliografie_eng.htm. Several updates to previous studies have been made. Regarding the excavations themselves, they have revealed numerous data from Ar until LRom times (Fig. 8). In the sacred area the aim was to find the S and W limits. To the SE of the Aphrodite temple a drop in the bedrock about 14m /., 7m w. and 3m d. was uncovered, on the bottom of which were 2 massive parallel walls dated to the 4th Ct BC (Fig. 9). The purpose of the structure is still unclear, but its location close to the temple indicates a relation between them. A new, possibly Ar sanctuary was discovered recently in the SE corner of the sacred area (CCA [2007]), reinforcing the idea of one large central sanctuary in this part of the city. Another goal concerning the Ar period has been to trace the city wall on the W side of the city (CCA [1995]). A Hel sanctuary of Kybele has been hypothesized in sector X on the so-called plateau (CCA [2006]). In 1994, A. Suceveanu and M.V Angelescu reported the find of a Hel marble frieze from the end of the 2nd Ct BC depicting on its sides Helios and in the centre Apollo, Hephaistos, Poseidon, Eros, Aphrodite, Athena, Zeus, Hermes and, probably, Hera. It was found in a foundation ditch of a basilica restoration in the S part of the large square in 1994. 9. Istros/Histria: sacred area 2004</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 127 In the excavations from 1990-1997 in the villae quarters of Histria, normally referred to as the domus sector, a 4th villa of the 6th Ct AD was explored (Bounegru 2000-2001). The campaigns of 1996-1998 by a team of German archaeologists allowed a number of preliminary observations to be made on the topography of the anc. town. These included the location of the anc. harbour (H?ckmann et al. 1998), the Rom defence system in the time of Hadrian, the enlargement of the defence wall towards the N, the extension of the Ar town in an E direction, the sacred zone including a Temple of Zeus, the so called Temple A and the propylon (all functioning in Ar times), as well as the habitation area on the acropolis in this period. On the plateau, traces of urbanization were evident already from the 7th Ct BC, all supporting the theory that rational planning of the urban space was employed here already in Ar times (Alexandrescu 2000-2001, 198). In 2000, investigations began in the area outside the walls of the L city with the purpose of studying the ERom city - and possibly the Hel city. The 2000 2003 investigations have brought to light 3 buildings and a number of structures, most of them dated before 238 AD. During the 2004 campaign the team excavated part of an Ar building that was named casa no. 4, and a pit containing Ar pottery N of this building (http://www.cimec.ro/Arheologie/ web-histria/2cercetare/cercetarea_eng.htm). In 2002, after 21 seasons, excavations in the sector of the episcopal basilica of the 6th Ct AD ended (Histria XIII). Recently, excavations resumed at 3 other basilicas connected to the LRom settlement (SCIVA 54-56 [2003-2005]). Although the excavations in the territory are scarce, the number of publications is considerable. They include papers published about previous research (Dom?neantu 1993; Suceveanu 1998; Teleag? and Zirra 2003) and essays on the understanding of Histrian territory from a broader perspective (Avram 1996; 2001). Orgame/Argamum (Jurilovka) The settlement with its large necropolis is located on Cape Dolojman (Fig. 10). The site has been under excavation since the M 1920s. In the earlier period of investigations it was foremost the city's LRom and Byz structures that were the focus (see overview of research history at http://www.archaeology. ro/argamum_istoric.htm). Three basilicas have been found inside the LRom fortification, which protected a settled area of 2.5ha. Another basilica, basilica IV, was excavated outside the fortifications at the W border of the Gr necropolis. During the last 15 years, the main archaeological objectives have been the necropolis of the Gr period, the Gr living quaters, the city wall as well as the LRom settlement. A tumulus, found in 1995, dating to around the M7th Ct BC is important evidence for the early settlement (TA 95) (Fig. 11). Compared with the average tumuli of the site's extended tumulus necropolis, this tumulus is monumental, having a di. of 42m (tomb of ktistes?). A ditch for offerings, in which ancestor or hero worship continued to take place until 200 BC, was dug around the tumulus (Lungu 2000c; Lungu 2000-200lb; Lungu 2007). 10.

Orgame/Argamum: tumulus (TA 95) found in 1995 and dated to around the M7th Ct BC Milesian pottery from the 3rd quarter of the 7th Ct BC and Middle Wild Goat I (M?nucu Adame?teanu 2000) found in other parts of the city support a foundation date towards the M7th Ct BC, the same as Istros. Ar, Cl and Hel houses were uncovered in the 1980s and published in 1999 (Lungu 1999a). The Ar ones of humble dimensions (ca. 3.5m x 2.5m) are similar to those from the Histrian plateau. Recently, the Gr fortification, built probably in the 5th Ct BC, has been excavated on the S slope of the promontory (M?nucu Adamesteanu 2005) (Fig. 12). The necropolis, covering 120ha, has been excavated since 1988 under the direction of V Lungu. Approximately 100 cremation tombs have been uncovered, most of them dating to the 4th and 3rd Cts BC (Lungu 1999a). A funerary stele from the Hel period, dedicated to Apollonis, wife of Apollodoros, was found in another tumulus (TB 95) in 1995 (Lungu 2004c). Due to the large number of anc. remains found in the necropolis area, it has been protected by national law since 1995, when it was made an archaeological preserve. In 2005 the publication series Orgame was launched, with the first volume on the excavation notes of M. Coja's, who reopened the excavations in the 1960 (M?nucu Adame?teanu 2005). The volume appeared 7 years post-mortem. Another volume in the same series has published the papers from an international colloquium organized on the occasion of the celebration of 40 years of excavations at Orgame. Halmyris (Murighiol) At Murighiol, a site located in the Danube delta, systematic excavations led by M. Zahariade have been conducted inside the city. The main goal has been the study of the Bishopric basilica and the buildings around it. Inside the crypt 2 skeletons were discovered, perhaps belonging to 2 Ch martyrs (// Mar Nero [2006]). Other excavations have been undertaken in the area of the LRom city wall, where a tower has been almost entirely excavated. Pottery from this site has been published by A. Opait (2004). 12. Orgame/Argamum: Cl wall 2004</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 129 UKRAINE Southwestern Ukraine With the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, a large part of the classical archaeological sites of former S Russia, foremost the Crimea and the Bug, Dnieper and Dniester regions, came under Ukrainian jurisdiction. A very useful homepage, with short biographies and bibliographies of Ukrainian Black Sea scholars, can be found at http://www.fridmanbooks.netfirms. com/authorancient/antiq.htm. Museums At the Kerch Museum a major renovation was initiated in 2000 with the help of the Demeter Foundation. In 2003 the A.G. Leventis Foundation completed the architectural renovation and the museological refurbishment of the Archaeological Museum of Odessa. This was preceded by the publication of a catalogue of around 200 of the collection's finest Cypriot and other artefacts (Karageorghis and Vanchugov 2001). The Odessa Virtual Museum of Numismatics (http://www.museum. com.ua/), in Ukrainian and English, offers a useful introduction to the museum as well as to the coinage of the anc. cities of S Ukraine. Leuke? (Island of Zmeinyj) In 1988 the Odessa Archaeological Museum initiated fieldwork on land and under water at the Island of Zmeinyj located E of the Danube delta. The island has for a long time been identified as Achilles' sacred island of Leuke. The fieldwork, which is ongoing, is directed by S.B. Ochotnikov and A.S. Ostroverchov. The finds from the investigations have been summarized in a short monograph, Svjatilisce Achilla na ostrove Levke (Ochotnikov and Ostroverchov 1993). Of great interest are the numerous finds of lead and stone elements pertaining to anc. anchors. No less than 9 stone anchors, 35 lead rods and 6 lead fastenings have been found, spanning the period from the LArc or EC1 period until the Rom period (Ochotnikov and Ostroverchov 2002). Tyras (Bel'gorod-Dnestrovskij) Between the 2 major poleis of the NW Pontic region, Istros and Olbia, are the 2 smaller cities of Tyras and Nikonion. The 2 sites are situated on opposite banks of the Dniester. Most parts of the city of Tyras are lost, either to nature (being under water) or to culture, because part of the anc. city has been covered by either the Med fortress of Akkerman or by the mod. city of Bel'gorod Dnestrovskij. In 1996, T.L. Samojlova took over the direction of the excavations from LB. Klejman, collaborating with the Romanian Institute of Thracology and Brail Museum. In 2002 the collaborators published a monograph on their investigations (Kozokaru et al. 2002). Most impressive are the remains of the city's fortification wall. It was first constmcted in the L5th-E4th Ct BC, and through the Hel and Rom periods it was rebuilt and enlarged several times. A recent find of great interest is the fragment of an Attic black-glossed vessel dating to the L5th Ct BC with the graffito [Achil]/ez ^[thias] confirming the title of Achilles, Lord over Scythia (Cojocaru 2002). Tyras' chora, on the right bank of the Dniester, extends between the village of Udobnoe 30km NW of the city to the village of Primorskoe 35km to the S. In this region approxi mately 25 settlements have been found. The richest settlements seem to be located in the immediate vicinity of Tyras itself, especially around the village of Sabo, S.B. Ochotnikov has recently published an overview of the settlement systems on both banks of the lower Dniester (Ochotnikov 2006). Nikonion (Roksolany) Nikonion is among the least known of the anc. cities on the Pontic shore. Systematic investigations started as late as 1957. Currently, excavations are directed by N.M. Sekerskaja of Odessa Archaeological Museum (since 1995) in collaboration with archaeologists from the Polish University of Toru?. A comprehensive collection of articles published in 1997 as Nikonij i anticnyj mir Severnogo Pricernomor ja (Ochotnikov et al. 1997) celebrated the 40 anniversary of the archaeolog ical excavation of the site, as did a small booklet edited by M. Mielczarek, S.B. Ochotnikov and N.V. Sekunda published the same year (1997). Kosary Archaeological investigations have also been taking place in the stretch of land in the Gulf of Odessa between the 2 cities mentioned above and Olbia. Most important are the investiga tions at the large site of Kosary located on a promontory on the right bank of the Tiligul' estuary. The excavation is directed by E.I. Diamant, E.A. Levina and E.F. Redina of the Archaeological Museum in Odessa. Recently, the Institute of Archaeology of the Jagiellonian University in Krakow, Poland, has joined the investigations (Papuci-Wladyka, Chochorowski and Redina 2004). The site itself is around 10ha in size. It was defended by a wall to the W (trench III) and a rampart running NE-SW (trench VII). Outside the fortification is a 'suburb' with individual farms (trench VI). Excavations carried out between 1999 and 2004 revealed remains of the defensive wall. Apart from the extended necropolis, a large ash hill, zolnik, ca. 20m x 30m with a preserved maximum h. of ca. 2.5m, is currently (since 1998) being excavated. This is considered a cult place by the excavators. Pit houses constitute the majority of the buildings at the site. The settlement was short-lived from the beginning of the 4th until the first half of the 3rd Ct BC. There are annual reports in AVU. An overview of the Gr amphorae found at the site can be found in Papuci-Wladyka and Kokorzhitskaia 2004. There are several articles on the site in the proceedings of the Pontika conference held in 2006 in Cracow (Papuci-Wladyka 2008). Island of Berezan' Scholars from the Institute of Archaeology of the Ukrainian Academy of Sciences and the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg have investigated the Island of Berezan' in the estuary of the Dniepr and the Bug rivers intensively during the last 15 years. The project is currently led by V.V. Krutilov and D.E. Cistov. Much new literature has appeared and the last decade, especially, has witnessed a growth in non-Russian publications, the most prominent of which is S.L. Solovyov's 1999 monograph (Solovyov 1999; see also Ksenofontov 2007 for the latest account). From June until September 2005, the State Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg held an exhibition devoted to the 120th anniversary of the archaeological exploration of the island. A catalogue and the release of the first volume of a planned series of 5 volumes devoted to the Berezan' material accompanied the exhibition (Solov'ev 2005a; 2005b). The most significant fieldwork on the island has been the excavation of a t?menos situated at the W boundary of the Ar settlement on the N part of the island, approximately 100m inland from the W coast (Nazarov 1997). The excavations conducted there from 1996 to 1999 under the direction of the late V.V Nazarov revealed a small ante-temple measuring 5.72m x 4.25m and an accompanying alter surrounded by a t?menos wall with 2 phases (Nazarov 1998; 1999a; 1999b; 2001b; 2007). The temple was constructed on top of previous dug-out structures from which the latest material can be dated</page><page sequence="16">130 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. to the M6th Ct BC. The material associated with the t?menos continues into the beginning of the 5th Ct BC and subsequent activity has not been proven so far (Nazarov, Pan'kov and Nazarova 2003). Most notable among the many finds from the t?menos are the terracotta statuettes of seated and standing 'goddesses'. The assemblage can be compared to that from the Aphrodite sanctuary on the Zeytintepe at Miletos, where similar terracottas have been found. A terracotta of a standing 'goddess' holding a pigeon is of particular interest, because it can be associated with previously known ostraca from Berezan' with graffiti mentioning Aphrodite (Rusjaeva 1992, 100). The hypothesis of metal working on Berezan' has recently been substantiated by extensive new evidence from the area of Osnovoj half way up the E coast (Domanskij and Marcenko 2003). This area had previously produced scant evidence for metal working, but the discovery in 1998-2000 of 2 copper workshops by the St Petersburg team testifies to metal working in the early period of the settlement. The workshops (building complex nos 6 and 13) were placed 12m apart and partially dug into the ground. Remains of kilns were found in both workshops, as well as 272 small copper droplets and one large ingot weighing 3kg (for previous finds see, Lapin 1961; Solovyov 1999, 36, 52-53). The habitation quarters on the N part of the island have also been subject to investigation. The layout of the LAr houses situated in the flat N part exhibit a structured plan with an approximate orthogonal street grid (Solovyov 1999, 64-79; Nazarov 2001). The reconstruction of individual houses is, however, still a topic of debate (Kryzickij 2005). Finally, mention should be made of the excavation in 2000 2002 of 2 pits containing ceramic wasters datable to the 3rd quarter of the 6th Ct BC (Nazarov, Pan'kov and Nazarova 2003). Among the wasters are red clay jugs, Grey Ware oinochoai and a rhyton, as well as fragments of painted jugs. The pits most probably functioned as waste dumps for a nearby potter's workshop. They are the first proof of pottery production on Berezan'. In addition, recent NAA analyses of pottery from Berezan' have possibly identified the chemical composition of the Berezan' pottery production (named BERa), one example of which includes an amphora imitating N Ionian pottery (Kerschner 2006, especially 151-54; Mommsen et al. 2006; Posamentir and Solovyov 2006). Unfortunately, the island is still subjected to illicit excavation and plundering, as well as deliberate destruction of monuments, which continuously destroys valuable archaeolog ical records. Despite the increase in the number of academic publications, few publications are concerned with contextual publication of assemblages, such as the many pits and wells (see, however, Domanskij et al. 2006). Olbia An overall description of the city from the Ar period through to Rom times has been presented in the monograph published in German by Ju.G Vinogradov and S.D. Kryzickij, Olbia -Eine Altgriechische Stadt im Nordwestlichen Schwarzmeerraum (Leiden 1995), in the comprehensive monograph by S.D. Krizic'kij, A.S. Rusjaeva, V.V. Krapivina, N.A. Lejpunskaja, M.V Skrzinskaja and VA. Anochin, Olvia.

Braund and S.D. Kryzhitskiy (2007). In 2006, as a response to extensive illicit digging in the city and its necropoleis, Olbia, including the Island of Berezan', was made a national preserve. In addition to the well-known dug-outs and semi-dug-outs of the upper city (sector AGD), a number of dug-outs have been found in sector R-25 (Krapivina and Bujs'kych 2006). They have also been found in the lower city (sector NGS), which, until now, was considered to be settled only in the Cl period, and thus later than the upper city, and, for the first time, remains of a LAr house with a dry stone foundation were excavated in the central part of the terraced city (Lejpuns'ka 2001). In the S part of the upper city remains of a temple dating to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC have been found, including large architectural elements of the Doric order. In 2000 a bothros was opened in its vicinity. Inside, vessels with dedications to Aphrodite and a unique terracotta relief with a female dressed in an ultra-short, transparent dress playing krotala next to a kline (a sacred prostitute?), were found (Fig. 13) (overview in Krapivina 2006b). During recent decades, Rom and LRom Olbia, in particular, have become decisively better known, first of all through the investigations in the S part of the upper and the lower city of Olbia (sector R-25) (Fig. 14). Here, most of the structures unearthed during recent years have been dated to the end of the 3rd_4th Q AD (Krapivina 2007, 608-09). A large civil building, which was built with lime mortar, of the 3 rd Ct AD was excavated. Here, in 2004, a fragment of a Rom military diploma pertaining to a veteran of the classis moesica was found, the first military diploma found in Olbia and only the 2nd 13.

Olbia: sector R-25 one from the N Black Sea littoral (Krapivina and Bujskich 2006, 234; Ivantchik and Krapivina 2007). Three building phases can be distinguished in the 4th Ct AD. As in earlier periods, the slope was terraced and the houses were situated on the lower and on the upper terraces. They were rather large, rectangular in plan, sometimes with 2 floors, combining dwellings and workshops. Their courtyards often had stone paving with drains. A large metal workshop has been revealed, also dated to the 4th Ct AD (Krapivina 2006a; Krapivina and Bujs'kych 2004, 178). Rescue excavations were carried out in sector L-1 N of the praetorium. Here a wide street of the 4th Ct AD was revealed. Under the N part of the road the remains of the paved courtyard of a house and ruins of a winery of the end of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD were excavated (Krapivina 2008, 102). In the S part of the sector a tile paving made in the Rom opus spicatum technique was revealed. The pavement, made of fragments of tiles, is seen here for the first time in Olbia (Krapivina and Bujs'kych 2004, 181, fig. 6). Two wineries of the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD were excavated on the E slope of the Zajacja ravine (sector R-21) (Krapivina 2008, 103). In sector NGF-SV, situated SE of sector NGF, rescue excavations were also carried out. Two main levels of the Rom period were revealed: of the L2nd-3rd Ct AD and of the L3rd-4th Ct AD. The first phase is represented by 2 streets, a metal workshop and 2 rooms of a house, in which a large number of coins and bone objects were found. The 2nd phase is represented by the ruins of a large square, which covered the street and workshop of the previous phase. The square had a system of stone and terracotta drains and a cistern for gathering water (Krapivina 2008, 104). The material culture of the period has been summarized in a monograph by V.V. Krapivina (1993). In 2003, the Danish National Research Foundation's Centre for Black Sea Studies initiated the publication project The Lower City of Olbia in the 5th Century BC - 4th Century AD (Sector NGS) in collaboration with the Institute of Archaeology of the National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine in Kiev (publication is due in 2009). Sector NGS is situated in the lower city in the northernmost part of the city near the city wall. This part of the anc. city has been excavated since 1985 during annual campaigns by Ukranian archaeologists directed by N.A. Lejpunskaja. In this sector, remains of 8 house blocks have been identified, 2 of which are now fully excavated. The house blocks range in size between 522m2 and 1,200m2 and each contains 4 to 7 living units (Fig. 15). The houses are relatively modest. They do not have any uniform plan, but they have a number of common features such as 3 to 4 rooms grouped around a central paved courtyard and one or more well-built cellar. The cellars and the foundations of the walls were constmcted of more or less well-dressed stones, whereas the upper part of the houses were built of mud-bricks. NGS was situated not far from the harbour, and it is quite evident from the finds in the houses that fishermen and artisans lived here. Net weights and fishing hooks attest to this, as well as small moulds for crafting simple metal jewellery. The earliest activity detected in sector NGS seems to have taken place in the LAr period, when at least one hut was dug into the ground, as well as a number of pits.

Olbia: plan of habitation quarter in the lower city, sector NGS</page><page sequence="18">132 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. E4th Ct BC material testifies that the area was inhabited in the Cl period, but building remains of that period are scarce because they are situated below later houses. The main building phases belong to the LCI and EHel periods. In 331 BC, Alexander the Great's general, Zopyrion, besieged the city. This may have been the reason for a significant drop in activities in the city, as well as in NGS during the last 3rd of the 4th Ct, but already in the E3rd Ct extensive building activity had resumed. This came to an abrupt end sometime in the 2nd quarter of the 3rd Ct BC. This period was a time of crisis in the N Black Sea region, and during the next decades very little activity can be noted in NGS. At the end of the 3rd Ct BC, this sector of the city was partly reinhabited. The LHel period, until the 130s BC, was the last major habitation phase in sector NGS. It may have come to an end as a result of the Scythian King Skiluros' contemporary expansion policy. At least, this part of the city was almost completely abandoned in the 130s BC. In the 60s BC the contracted city was once more subjected to the region's larger powers, now the Thracian tribe, the Getai, under their king Burebista. Only during the Rom period did Olbia regain some kind of position. However, sector NGS was never rebuilt, even though there was occasional activity attested by a number of furnaces and tombs. Fieldwork continues in the necropolis. In 1996, as a result of illicit digging, 4 tabellae defixionum were found, dated to the 2nd half of the 4th Ct BC (Tochtas'ev 2000; SEG 50, 700). In 2004 in the W part of the necropolis a 4th Ct BC mansion was found, which existed before the westward expansion of the necropolis (Papanova and Ljasko 2005). A number of cult installations, altars of various designs and pits, were unearthed. In addition to the 2 epitaphs with Latin inscriptions previously found at the necropolis, 2 further fragmentary Latin inscrip tions, dated to the 3rd Ct AD, were found, one in 1994 and one in 2002 (Zubar' and Kozub 2004). They testify to the continued presence of Rom soldiers and civilians in Olbia. Concerning the cults of Olbia and its chora in general, 4 publications merit mention. One is the monograph by A.S. Rusjaeva, Religija i kul'ty anticnoj O'lvii (Kiev 1992). The same author also published the book Religija pontijskich ellinov v anticnuju epochu. Mify. Svjatilisca. Kul 'ty olimpijskich bogov i geroev (Kiev 2005), which, though broad in scope, is primarily based on the evidence from Olbia, and thus supplements the previous monograph. The 3rd is the compre hensive publication of the W t?menos, which was the subject of a monograph published in 2006, Drevnejsij t?menos OTvii Pontijskoj (MAIET Suppl. 2). The last book to be mentioned is the volume edited by J. Hupe, The Cult of Achilles in the Northern Black Sea Area from the Beginning of Greek Colonization until the Roman Imperial Period. Contributions to the Field of Acculturation Research (Internationale Arch?ologie 94). In this volume, the main Achilles sanctuaries are discussed (Leuke: S.B. Ochtonikov; Tendra: I. Tunkina; Bejkus at the mouth of the River Bug: S. Bujskich; Tyras, Neapolis Skythike and Olbia: J. Hupe). Hupe concludes that during the Rom period, the cult of Achilles Pontarches became the uniting religious force for the entire population in Olbia, of both Gr and Sarmatian descent. It should also be mentioned that 3 sizeable collections of the characteristic Olbian small votive lead plaques have been published: first, A. W?sowicz and W. Zdrojewska (1998), who based their study on the collections in the National Museum in Warsaw. More recent are 2 articles by K.I. Zajceva, the first of which is an overview article on the most common types (adorned heads of bulls and rams, as well as double axes) in the State Hermitage Museum, Warsaw, and other museums (Zajceva 2004a). The 2nd article contains a large number of the more uncommon types from collections in Moscow and St Petersburg (Zajceva 2004b). Lead plaques, as well as moulds for producing such items, are recurrently found in the public areas, in the inhabited quarters and in the necropolis. In 1996 L. Dubois published his Inscriptions grecques dialectales d 'Olbia du Pont (Gen?ve) presenting 110 different inscriptions and graffiti from Olbia organized according to function or type. Currently, A. Ivancik is working on the publication of the entire corpus of Olbian inscriptions. Some new inscriptions have been found in Olbia since Dubois' book was published: in 1991 a decree dated to the first half of the 4th Ct BC was found, which honours the Bosporan ruler Satyros with citizenship and celebrates a symmachia treaty between Olbia and Leukon. An inscription was found in sector NGS, dated to the 2nd Ct BC, with a dedication of the city wall made by Posideos, son of Dionysios, to the Eleusinian deities Demeter, Kore and Plouton, as well as to the Demos (Krizic'kyj, Krapivina and Lejpuns'ka 1994, 29, fig. 15); according to a white marble base found in 2002 in the SE part of the upper city in the territory of the citadel of the Rom period (sector R25) another section of the city wall was dedicated to the Mother of the Gods by Diogenes, son of Thyaios, strategos and city governor under King Mithridates Eupator in the year 220 (78/77 BC) (Krapivina and Diatroptov 2005). A fragment of a marble relief with the image of Mithras killing the bull was found in sector R25 in 1993 (Krizic'kyj, Krapivina and Lejpuns'ka 1994, 35, fig. 20). Recently 2 monographs on Olbian numismatics have been published (Karyskovskij 2003; Frolova and Abramzon 2005). Western and Central Crimea (Fig. 16) After the stagnation of the early 1990s, an enormous spread of illicit excavations followed at nearly all known sites during the reporting period. Recently, however, W Crimean archaeology has experienced a revival in both fieldwork and publishing activity. Publications Largely thanks to the efforts of the late M.I. Zolotarev, Chersonesskij Sbornik, which with vol. 6 was brought to a hold in 1961, was resumed in 1996 (to date 9 additional volumes have appeared). An important event was the appearance of a bilingual Russian-English edition, Ancient Greek Sites in the Crimea (Kiev 2004), which, among other sites, covers Chersonesos and its chora, Kerkinitis, Kalos Limen and the sanctuary at the Gurzuf Saddle Pass. Several new publication series were initiated in Simferopol, Bachcisaraj and Eupatoria (Archeologija Kryma [1: 1997], Archeologiceskie issledovanija v Krymu [1994; 1997; 2007], Krymskij Muzej [1: 1994; 2: 1996], Bachcisarajskij istoriko-archeologiceskij sbornik [1: 1997; 2: 2001; 3: 2008], Istoriceskoe nasledie Kryma [1-18: 2003-2007]). However, few of them survived more than a couple of issues. Although not always complete, a systematic reporting of the fieldwork conducted in W Crimea was given in Archeologicni vidkryttja v Ukraini, succeeded in 2005 by Archeologicni doslidzennja v Ukraini, as well as in Archeologiceskie Otkrytija (where only excavations conducted by Russian archaeologists are reported). The formation of the Chersonesean state in W Crimea, its development and relations with Kerkinitis and indigenous populations have been surveyed by various scholars (Rogov 1999; 2005; Kutajsov 1995b; 1996; 2001c; 2002b; 2003b; Vnukov 2001; Zubar 2004a; Lantsov and Uzhentzev 2007).

Distant Chora of Chersonesos Lake coring project To study the impact of climatic and environmental changes on the ethno-political and economic history of the region, a Danish-Russian-Ukrainian multi-disciplinary project, Northern Black Sea in the 1st millennium BC: Human History and Climate Changes, has been initiated under the direction of VF. Stolba. In 2005, the coring of 2 lakes, Saki and Dzarylgac (Saki and Cernomorskoe districts), was carried out by the joint team of the Danish National Research Foundation's Centre for Black Sea Studies (VF. Stolba) and the Institute of Limnology, Russian Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg (D.A. Subetto, TV. Sapelko, D.D. Kuznecov and A.V Ludikova). Long sediment sequences were examined for lithostratigraphy, magnetostratigraphy and biostratigraphy (ostracod, diatom, malacofaunal and polen analyses). Along with a varve chronology, an independent AMS C14 dating for the sequences was produced at the C14 Dating Laboratory, University of Aarhus (Neustrueva et al. 2007; Stolba et al. 2007; Subetto et al. 2007a; Subetto et al. 2007b; Subetto, Stolba and Sapelko 2007). Dzarylgac Survey Project In 2007 an interdisciplinary, multi-period (BA until E mod. times) survey project, the Dzarylgac Survey Project, directed by P. Guldager Bilde (Centre for Black Sea Studies, University of Aarhus) and P. Attema (Groningen Institute of Archaeology), was launched. It aims at investigating the mral hinterland of the settlement of Panskoe I on both sides of Lake Dzarylgac. The methodologies applied have been systematic field walking and collection of surface finds, augering, geomagnetic and other surface measurements, as well as GPS recording and trial excavations at selected sites. Already during the first season, the investigations have revealed a rich and complex settlement pattern covering the entire survey area from the coast and onto the hinterland slopes hitherto undetected by archaeologists working in the area. These startling results made apparent the urgent need for a large-scale revision of the settlement history of the NW Crimean landscape (Guldager Bilde et al. 2007). Masliny/Vladimirovka No new investigation at the settlement has taken place since excavations terminated in 1986. Various groups of finds have been treated in a series of articles by the late VA. Latyseva (1994: terracotta; 1996: handmade pottery; Latyseva and Tadenev 1992: 4 lead weights of the 3r?-2nd Ct BC). Panskoe I Situated 10km NE of mod. Cernomorskoe, excavations commenced in 1969 by A.N. Sceglov and continued on a systematic basis until the collapse of the USSR. Two major phases in the site's occupation have been recognized by this work: (1) Olbian: around 400 BC-ca. 360/350 BC; (2) Chersonesean: ca. 360/350-ca. 270 BC. The extra-mural house excavated at tower III of the early fort (area U7) in 1987 furnishes the earliest evidence for the Chersonesean presence (Stolba 1991). A private ceramic letter found just outside this building is written in Doric dialect and contains a mention of a cenotaph (yeuB?piov) (Stolba 2005a). Ju.G Vinogradov's article on the graffito from U7 refering to Olbiopolitai is now available in German (Vinogradov 1997; for criticism, see Jajlenko 2001a; also in German 2001b). Complete publication of the monumental building U6, from the 2nd phase of the site's occupation, which was investigated from 1969 to 1977, is now available (Hannestad, Stolba and Sceglov 2002). At the settlement, excavation along its N periphery has targeted the area where soundings in 1987 disclosed a complex of household pits overlaid by a block of buildings (U2) of the L4th-E3rd Ct BC. House U2-2 (ca. 260m2) has been completely excavated, as was the NE part of an adjacent building, U2-3. Both structures are of a similar orthogonal plan with a courtyard, a row of household rooms at the NW side and 2 rows of living units ranged along the NE wall of the house. The pottery assemblage and human skeletons found in U2-2/rooms 14 and 19, as well as in U2-3/room 25, indicate a termination date at the time of a general destruction of the settlement in the first 3rd of the 3rd Ct BC (Stolba &amp; Sceglov 1995). To the same period belong the remains of 2 rooms excavated at U10 in the S sector of the settlement which proved to be part of a larger structure. One of these rooms produced fragments of terracotta figurines and a tymiatherion. In 1994, which was the only excavation campaign in the period under report, the St Petersburg team of the Russian Academy of Sciences (under the direction of A.N. Sceglov and V.F. Stolba) was working together with the Institute of Classical Archaeology, University of Aarhus, Denmark (L. Hannestad) (Stolba, Hannestad and Sceglov 1995; Sceglov, Hannestad and Stolba 1995; Sceglov et al. 1995; Hannestad 1995). In the necropolis area, work was confined to clearing and rescue excavations of graves destroyed by robbers in 1991-1993. The complete publication of the investigations carried out at the necropolis since 1969 is now in print (Rogov and Stolba in print). An overview of rf and bg pottery from the Panskoe cemetery was given by Rogov and Tunkina (1998). Finds of beads, pendants and amulets, and their role in burial rites, are treated in depth by Stolba (2007b; in print). Within the framework of the Dzarylgac Survey Project, a geomagnetic prospection of the N, E and S parts of the settlement has been made by T. Smekalova in 2007 and 2008. The complete layout of the preserved part can now be reconstructed. Kalos Limen (Cernomorskoe) The West-Crimean Expedition (VA. Kutajsov) continued excavation in the settlement and necropolis. The stratigraphy of the site has been defined with more accuracy, distinguishing 4 main horizons (A-D): (1) Gr: E4th-3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC; (2) Gr: last quarter of the 4th-1st half of the 2nd Ct BC; (3) Scythian: 2nd half of the 2nd Ct BC-lst half of the 2nd Ct AD; (4) Saltovo-Majak Culture associated with the Khazars: 8th-1st half of the 9th Ct AD. Excavations in 1988-1991 in the E part of the site, omitted in the previous report, unearthed a 40m /. section of the EHel defensive wall with gates and a tower (5.5m x 4.75m) attached from the outside to the already existing curtain</page><page sequence="21">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 135 (Kutajsov and Uzencev 1994). A burnt destruction layer of the 1st quarter of the 3rd Ct BC testifies to a destiny similar to that of mral sites in the territory of Chersonesos. In the Scythian period, along with the above-ground structures, pit shelters became a common type of architecture (Uzencev 1994; 1997), although one such dwelling excavated in 1994 seems to date as early as the 3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC (Kutajsov et ai 1991 \ Uzencev 2006). A 120m2 large Scythian house built in the 1st Ct AD in the area of the former Gr citadel, and left by its inhabitants some decades later, is published by Uzencev (2002). Since 1992 excavations have mainly focused on the S W part of the site where a citadel was erected in the last third of the 3 rd Ct BC. Tower 4, protecting the SW comer of the citadel, measures 10.2m x 9.2m and is the only one reinforced by an 'anti-ramming' belt. Three adjoining structures of orthogonal plan (complexes I-III), unearthed here in 1993-1995 and built over by the city wall, belong to the earliest phase of the site, the 1st to the 3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC. Their interpretation as a winery was suggested, but is uncertain (Kutajsov and Uzencev 1996; 1997; 2007; Kutajsov etal. 1997; Uzencev 2004). Walls of the same period have also been traced inside the citadel where structures of the L3rd-E2nd Ct BC were studied, including a row of rooms adjacent to its N wall interpreted as barracks. The fortifications of the citadel are the subject of a separate study by Uzencev (2004). Reuse of gravemarkers and architectural elements is recorded in their construction. One of the gravemarkers bears the name of Heronikos, son of Damis. This name must have been especially popular in W Crimea, as attested by several LGPN IV entries for Heronikos restricted exclusively to Chersonesos and Kerkinitis. Smaller trenches were also dug in the central as well as in the NW parts of the settlement, where in 1997-1998 the Hel house 6 adjoining the N defensive wall was investigated (Kutajsov and Uzencev 1999; Kutajsov and Kutajsov 2005). Worthy of mention is a find of the bone inlay of a box with incised representation of a Nereid riding a hippocampus. Red slipped pottery from the site is treated by Uzencev and Trufanov (Uzencev 1999; Uzencev and Trufanov 2004). In the numismatic material, coins of Chersonesos by far predominate, other mints being represented by Pantikapaion, Kerkinitis, Olbia, Istros, Kallatis, Amisos, Dioskourias and Egypt. Uzencev 2006 is a useful synthetic study bringing together both literary and archaeological evidence about the settlement of Kalos Limen. Investigations in the tumular necropolis, SE and E of the settlement, were mainly of a rescue character (Kutajsov and Uzencev 1994; Kutajsov and Pridnev 2007). Both mound burials and graves in the area between the tumuli have been unearthed, many barrows having been robbed already in antiquity. The location of the flat ground cemetery remains unknown. The earliest burials date to the 2nd quarter of the 4th Ct BC. No graves of the 2nd phase of the Gr occupation are so far recorded. Above-ground mud-brick cists have been excavated in tumuli 12, 26 and 31, the other types of burial structures being represented by simple trenches, slab lined graves, stone cists, etc. Gravemarkes are both of the classical and the anthropomorphic types, all found reused in the constmction of the citadel. Karadza The impressive site is located in the N outskirts of the village of Olenevka (Karadza). In 2005 V.A. Kutajsov initiated excavations, the first archaeological undertaking at the site since 1901, when 5 burial mounds were excavated by the local landowner A.I. Popov in the territory of his estate. The settlement, the size of which was estimated at ca. 3.2ha, has a trapezoid plan measuring ca. 200m x 160m. A trench dug in its S part, exposed to erosion, revealed a terraced building with a complex stratigraphy and material no earlier than the 3r quarter of the 4th Ct BC (Kutajsov 2006). A damaged fragment of a limestone sculpture of a male head was found in the stone debris on the upper terrace. Fragments of mouldmade bowls testify to occupation until the 2nd Ct BC. A 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD dating is assumed for the upper stratigraphie horizon, although the material retrieved to date is insufficient to prove this. Dzan-Baba In 2002, the site situated 200m W of the mod. village of Mar'ino, together with the settlements of Terekly-Konrat, Beregovoe, Murzacok and Airci, were inspected by S.V. Pridnev (2004). Drawings of an 'anti-ramming' belt of a tower observable in the eroding cliff were made, as well as a surface sampling of pottery. No trenches were dug. KuPcuk A.S. Golencov excavated at the fortified settlement of Kul'cuk until 1994 (Golencov 1994; 1995). In 2006 work at the site was resumed under the direction of S.B. Lancov (Lancov et al. 2007). The main work has been carried out in the S, intensively eroded, part and in the E sector, where strata of the Gr, L Scythian and EMed periods have been recognized. A large building complex investigated in the E sector of the settlement (no. 2 in Lancov's numeration) is trapezoidal in plan measuring 38-40m x 25.6m with a tower (9.8m x 10.25m) reinforced by an 'anti-ramming' belt in its NW corner. An anti-seismic, rather than defensive, purpose of these belts is argued by V.M. Ivanov (2003). A destruction layer of the 1st Ct BC has been recorded in 2 rooms in the NE part of the complex. Several pit shelters unearthed by Golencov in the coastal part so far provide the earliest material which dates to the M or 3rd quarter of the 4th Ct BC. Presumed pottery kilns excavated in the same area date to the Scythian period and went out of use no later than the 1st Ct BC. Work has also involved excavations in the necropolis situated to the N of the settlement. Excavated burials date to the 1st Ct BC-1st Ct AD, but some reuse the tombs of an earlier period. Two bronze coins from Olbia and Amisos are reported among the chance finds. A 3rd specimen, which is said to be from Messembria (Lancov et al. 2007), belongs to Mytilene. Excavations in 2008 produced a limestone relief depicting a reclining Herakles (S.B. Lancov, personal commu nication). Similar reliefs have been found at the settlements of Cajka and Mezvodnoe (Stolba 2004). A brief account of the Chersonesean amphora stamps from the 1989-1994 excavations has been provided by Golencov (1999). Beljaus Excavations at the settlement and necropolis of Beljaus, directed by O.D. Dasevskaja, continued throughout the whole period under report (Dasevskaja 1994; 1996; 1997a; 1997b; Dasevskaja and Golencov 2005; 2007). Supplementary exam inations have been undertaken in various parts of the site. By 2008 the entire area (amounting to 6,000m2) has been almost completely excavated. Fieldwork in the necropolis yielded 2 new burials of the Hunnic period (Dasevskaja 1995; 2003). A fragment of a limestone relief with a representation of a funeral banquet, which was found in 1988 in debris of the 1st Ct AD Scythian house, has been studied by P.D. Diatroptov (1994). Zapadno-Donuzlavskoe Dasevskaja and Golencov (1999) have published an overview of the main results of excavations conducted in the period 1967-1988.</page><page sequence="22">136 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. Juzno-Donuzlavskoe The site on the S shore of Lake Donuzlav has not been investi gated since O.D. Dasevskaja's excavations in the 1960s-1970s. Abrief account of amphora stamps has been given by Golencov (1999). Coins from excavations and chance finds are published by Stolba and Golencov (1999; 2000). Cajka The settlement of Cajka, situated on the W outskirts of mod. Eupatoria, is one of a few sites in the distant chora of Chersonesos where investigations, since 1987 under the direction of E.A. Popova, have continued uninterrupted. The main results of these excavations were recently brought together in 2 volumes (Popova and Kovalenko 2005; Popova et al. 2007). A brief summary of the sites in the immediate vicinity of Cajka (the necropolis of Zaozemoe, Pescanka, Majak, Mojnakskoe) can be found in Kolesnikov and Jacenko (1999). In the period under report, excavation has been focused on 2 large EHel houses named usad'ba (farmhouse) 2 and 3, which, along with house 1 published in 1991 by Jacenko and Turina, were built at the spot of an earlier fortified emporion. House 2 (ca. 450m2) is of a TT-shaped plan with a courtyard and 11 rooms along the W, S and E walls of the building, its SW comer being reinforced by a tower. House 3, slightly smaller in size, partially adjoins house 2 on the SE. Unlike the previous building, it has 2 courtyards separated by a row of 4 rooms ranging from N to S. By the N wall of the house, a workshop for producing mud-bricks was uncovered (Popova and Kovalenko 2001). Built sometime in the L4th Ct BC, both structures were destroyed by fire in the 270s/260s BC as a result of a military attack. Besides the strata of the Gr period, in 2004-2006, the stmctures of the L Scythian period were investigated in the NW part of the Scythian settlement where a section of the W defensive wall, as well as 3 rooms along the N defensive wall, were uncovered (Popova and Egorova 2005; 2007). Along with numerous finds of pottery, terracotta and metal artefacts treated in a series of articles (Jacenko 1993; 1994; Il'ina 2000; 2007a; Egorova 2000; 2004; 2005; 2007; Belovinceva and Popova 2007; Zuravlev 2007), the excavation yielded 2 limestone reliefs each with representations of a standing Herakles (Popova and Kovalenko 1996; 1997; 1998; 2000-2001). A large fragmentary terracotta statuette (in Eupatoria Museum) was originally identified as Herakles too (Popova and Kovalenko 1996, 68, fig. 5; 1997, 81, fig. 3), but it is now appropriately attributed as Dionysos (Il'ina 2007b). Despite previous attempts to date the foundation of the Gr settlement to the L5th or E4th Ct BC, the material does not seem to substantiate this notion. The pottery assemblage from the well below the SW tower, as well as numismatic material, point to a considerably later date in the 360s BC. Kerkinitis Excavations have taken place in the NW comer of the anc. city, but were restricted to small trenches because the site is totally built over by mod. Eupatoria. Soundings and excavations of 1993-1994 outside the earliest defensive line uncovered 2 ash hills of the 5th and 4th Cts BC. Remains of an EHel stone structure, which overlays these deposits, are said to post-date the expansion of the city's territory (Kutajsov and Pavlenkov 1994; 1999). Rescue excavations undertaken in the same area in 2000 unearthed a human cremation and remains of a round tower of the E4th Ct BC, which possibly belonged to a farmhouse built in the immediate vicinity of the city wall (Kutajsov, Pavlenkov and Pridnev 2001). Kutajsov and Pridnev (1997) report on a rescue excavation in the necropolis area in 1994. Out of 10 excavated burials, there was only one cremation, the rest being inhumations, including 2 enchytrismoi in amphorae. None of these seems to post-date the 4th Ct BC. Kutajsov (2004) offers an important synthesis of the history and archaeology of Kerkinitis. Paleoeconomical aspects of the city's history have been the subject of studies by the same author (Kutajsov 1999; 2001b; 2003a; 2006). The literary tradition about the city and the Bay of Kerkinitis has been examined by V.F. Stolba (2004). Despite attempts to find 2 different cities of the same name, both Karkinitis of Herodotos and Carcine/Karkina of the later authors refer to one and the same polis in W Crimea, merely reflecting different chronolog ical strata of the source material available to them. The geographical confusion in the later tradition is likely to predate the lifetime of Mela in whose work it is first evident. Karkinit?s kolpos might be an original name of what is now the bay of Eupatoria (Stolba 2004). Substantial scholarly attention has been devoted to the local coinage and coin circulation (Zaskoka 1995; Kutajsov 1995a; 2002a; Stolba 1996b; 2007a; 2007c). The spread of the cult of Artemis Epheseia to Kerkinitis is evidenced by 2 5th Ct BC dedicatory graffiti: APTEMI EOEIHIH:HAEA and APTEMI EOE2H (Kutajsov 2001a; 2004, figs 70, 72). However, the attempt to make this an argument for the Ephesian foundation of the city seems far fetched (Kolesnikov 2004). In 1998 Anochin rejected Solomonik's reading of the letter of Apatourios (1987), offering instead his own, rather fantastic, interpretation of the text (Anochin 1998). An overview of around 860 amphora stamps found in the city in 1980-1987 has been provided by Machneva (1994). Kara-Tobe S.Ju. Vnukov continues excavations of the fortified settlement of Kara-Tobe on the W outskirts of the mod. city of Saki, identified as the Eupatorion of Strabo (Vnukov 1994; 1997; 2000; 2007). The site's plan approaches a square measuring ca. 100m x 100m with a tower (12.9m x 12.2m) in the middle. Excavations of the tower, which began in 1992, are now completed. Whereas the earliest finds of pottery date back to the 4th Ct BC, no actual habitation layer prior to the 2nd Ct BC has been recorded. Soundings in 1993 N of the site uncovered catacombs and simple trench and niche-grave burials of the 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD. The flat grave necropolis of the L Scythian period has also been discovered W of the site; some child burials were excavated inside the inhabited area, below the floor of room 15 and E of the central tower (Vnukov 2005; 2007; Vnukov and Lagutin 2001). Some groups of artefacts found at the settlement, including mouldmade bowls, coins, weapons, etc., have been the subject of special studies (Vnukov and Kovalenko 1998; 2004; Lagutin 1999). A unique golden stater of the Bosporan King Asandros, found in 2006 in pit 9/06, has the date H (the 8th year of Asandros' rule = 37/36 BC) (Vnukov and Kovalenko 2007). A fragment of an inscription bearing the name Aristonikos is interpreted as a dedication of a tropaion from the period of the Diophantos' campaign against the Scythians (Vinogradov and Vnukov 1997 = SEG 47, 1177). Sakskaja Peresyp' The site is situated in the SE part of a sand bar separating Lake Saki from the sea. Rescue excavation undertaken by S.B. Lancov in 1986-1987 after the site began to be plundered covered an area of ca. 500m2. A supplementary survey took place in 2007 (Lancov 2008). No convincing traces of above ground structures have been recorded. Numerous fragments of</page><page sequence="23">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 137 sculpture, dedicatory inscriptions, as well as pottery and coins prompt the interpretation of the site as a sanctuary which existed from the 2nd Ct BC to the 3rd Ct AD. One of the inscribed fragments bears the name of Artemis. A detailed description of the site and finds is given by Lancov (Lancov 2001a; 2003). Seventy-four coins confiscated from local schoolboys have been published separately (Lancov 2001b). Several hundreds more remain in a private collection in Simferopol, including a gold stater of Chersonesos struck in the year 119 (=AD 95) of the local era (Sidorenko 2001, 439, no. 7). Novo-Fedorovka The site, situated 500m N of the mod. village of Novo Fedorovka, was partly destroyed by systematic ploughing. The last year of excavation was in 1992 (Lancov 1994). The site is broadly dated from the L5th-2nd Ct BC, although the material seems to speak in favour of a somewhat later initial date (2nd quarter of the 4th Ct BC?). To the 1st half of the 4th Ct BC belongs a rectangular pit shelter measuring 2.4m x 2.1m. Above-ground stmctures are represented by remains of rubble stone sockles. Along with the sites of Kizil-Jar (Lancov 1989) and Vilino (Koltuchov, Zubar' and Myc 1992) found S of Lake Saki, this site fills the gap on the map of Gr settlements between Eupatoria and Sevastopol. A 4th Ct BC barrow with Gr material excavated between Lake Kizil-Jar and Lake Bogajly seemingly antedates the Chersonesean presence in the area (Koltuchov, Trufanov and Uzencev 2005). Home Chora of Chersonesos The home chora of Chersonesos has maintained its importance for the study of anc. land use and management. Excavations of farmhouses and rural infrastructure have taken place at various locations. Earlier archaeological work on the Herakleian Peninsula, since the LI8th Ct until 2000, is summarized by Zubar' (2005; 2006a; 2007). Of major importance is the appearance of 2 volumes by G Nikolaenko, Chora Chersonesa Tavriceskogo. ZemeTnyj kadastr IV?III vv. do n.e. (1999; 2001), indispensable tools for anyone working in the area. S. Saprykin has published in English the results of excavations of farmhouses on plots 9, 10, 86 and 57 conducted in 1974-1990 by the late I.T. Kruglikova (Saprykin 1994). The fortified settlement on the isthmus of the Majacnyj peninsula identified as the TraXai? Xeppovnoo? of Strabo (7.4.2) has been the subject of studies by A.N. Sceglov ( 1994; 1997; 2001 ). Pottery of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD from site 343 ('Twins') excavated from 1987 to 1990 is treated in detail by E. Klenina (2004). A brief account of the 1976-1987 excavations of the Moscow State University at plot 227 (no. 150 of the old numeration) has been given by Kuziscin and Ivancik ( 1998). Since 1994 the major foreign collaborator with the National Preserve of Tauric Chersonesos has been the Institute of Classical Archaeology (ICA), University of Texas, Austin, which sponsored and participated in the excavation and restoration work in the chora of Chersonesos on the Herakleian Peninsula and in the city itself (J.C. Carter). This collaboration has also made it possible for the preserve to provide a compre hensive and highly useful homepage in 3 languages, Russian, Ukrainian and English (http://www.chersonesos.org). During the decade from 1994-2004, work of the joint Ukrainian American expedition was restricted to sites 151 and Bezymjannaja. A well-preserved farmhouse excavated on plot 151, the plan of which parallels other sites in the nearby chora of Chersonesos, was fortified with a central tower surrounded on 3 sides by a courtyard. The pottery assemblage and coins provide a date from the 4th-2nd Ct BC. A general overview of finds can be found in Carter 1998. Unlike plot 151, the stratig raphy of the farmhouse at Bezymjannaja, a full publication of which is underway, is more complex comprising strata of the Hel, LRom and EByz periods (Carter et al. 2000; Thompson 2000; Rabinowitz, Yashaeva and Nikolaenko 2002). In order to obtain an idea about landscape transformation during the M-L Holocene, since 1997 archaeological work in the chora has been complemented by geomorphological, pale obotanical and paleoenvironmental studies (Cordova and Lehman 2003; 2005; Cordova, Rybak and Lehman 2001; Cordova 2007). In 1996, the Herakleian Expedition of the National Preserve under the direction of G Nikolaenko resumed excavations of the settlement on the isthmus of the Majacnyj Peninsula, on the W coast of the Kazac'ja Bay. Except for the plan and photograph of the trench published by Nikolaenko (1999; 2006) and coin finds (Dem'jancuk et al. 2005, 438-46) information is scarce. The interpretation of the discovered structure as a t?menos, proposed by the excavators (Nessel et al. 2006), is uncertain. An alternative interpretation is offered by Bujskich and Zubar' (2007) who argue for its profane character. In 1993, on plot 53a, Nikolaenko excavated a 2 chambered structure, which was interpreted as a roadside shrine. Built of rubble, it measures 9.4m x 4.7m. Rock-cut pits were uncovered in the corners of one of the rooms and outside the building. The finds included pottery and coins of the L4th Ct BC, but no terracotta fragments have been reported (Nikolaenko 1997; 2001; 2006). Material of the L4th/E3rd Ct BC has been retrieved from the farmstead on plot 39, which was much destroyed by coastal erosion. A fortified multi period complex in the Berman ravine, where work was resumed in 1990, has continued to be excavated. L.A. Kovalevskaja carried out excavations of the farmhouse on plot 341, which consists of a courtyard with the household and living units on 3 sides and a tower in its SW corner. Measuring 10m x 11.3m, the tower was reinforced by an 'anti ramming' belt and contained 2 rooms, in one of which was a well, whereas the other served as storage space. The earliest find is represented by a single coin of Pantikapaion from the 4th Ct BC, the bulk of material belonging to the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct BC-3rd Ct AD (Kovalevskaja 1994; 1997; 2007). With interruptions, habitation on the site continued until the 13th Ct AD. A pottery assemblage of the 2nd-3rd Ct AD is published by Kovalevskaja (1998). An outstanding find is a pentagonal limestone slab with an incised depiction of Parthenos as Promachos (Fig. 17) following the iconography of the goddess known from local coins of the 1st Ct BC-3rd Ct AD (Kovalevskaja and Sevcenko 2003). A limestone head found in 1995 in room 13 is likely to represent Herakles (Kovalevskaja 2007). Soundings on the W slope of the Sarandinaki ravine uncovered the ceramic pipes of a water duct, which could be traced for a distance of 3.5km (Kovalevskaja 1994). The other localities involved were farmhouses on plots 129, 130 and 297, but the information is scarce. Chersonesos (Sevastopol) Several new guidebooks on the city have appeared (Zolotarev and Chapaev 2002; Sorocan, Zubar' and Marcenko 2003). Of these, Crimean Chersonesos. City, Chora, Museum, and Environs (Austin 2003), edited by GR. Mark and J.C. Carter, provides the most valuable and best illustrated introduction to the history and archaeology of Chersonesos and its environs, as well as to the finds. A substantially updated version of Saprykin's book, Gerakleja Pontijskaja i Chersones Tavriceskij</page><page sequence="24">138 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. 17. Home chora of Chersonesos: limestone relief with incised rendering of Parthenos as Promachos found in the farmhouse on plot 341 (1986), appeared in English in 1997. Several new monographs offer both popular and in-depth scholary treatments of various aspects of the city's history (Zubar' 1993; 1994; 2004a; Sorocan, Zubar' and Marcenko 2001; Zubar', Bujskich, Kravcenko and Rusjaeva 2005). Economic and political relations with the Bosporan Kingdom in the 4th-2nd Ct BC were the subject of a study by Molev (2003). In 2002, VDI created a special section devoted to Tauric Chersonesos aiming at the publication of new finds and discussion of the main issues of its history and archaeology. Virtually all parts of the anc. city have been subjected to archaeological investigations throughout the period under report. Since the untimely death of I.A. Antonova in 2000, excavation and conservation work have continued in the citadel and in the harbour area under the direction of S.B. Sorocan. Built in the 3rd Ct BC (Zubar' and Antonova 2001), in the 2nd 3rd Ct AD it accommodated a Rom garrison stationed in the city, and later on it was the location of the Byz praetorium. About 70% of its territory had been investigated by 2008. A full account of archaeological investigations hitherto conducted in the citadel has been provided most recently by Zubar' and Sorocan (2008). The joint expedition of the Chersonesos Museum and the University of Kharkov (M.I. Zolotarev and S.V. D'jackov) completed investigations of a large public building, the so-called barracks, near the SE gates of the city. Amphora stamps from this complex were treated by M.I. Zolotarev (1999) who suggested a constmction date shortly after 350 BC. In Rom times, the N part of the building was converted into a winery which remained in use until the 2nd half of the 3rd Ct AD. In its S part, supposed remains of an earlier city wall, dated to the L5th or E4tfl Ct BC, were discovered in 1993-1994 (Zolotarev and D'jackov 1994; Zolotarev 1995; Zolotarev, Korobkov and Usakov 1997). In 2005 another approximately 5m /. segment of the city's early fortifications was discovered by Ryzov in the N sector of Chersonesos (2007a). His conjecture of their general outline challenges the reconstruction proposed by Bujskich (2005). The excavation at the basilika of 1935 in the N sector of the city, conducted by the Chersonesean Preserve in collaboration with the Macalester College in St Paul, MN and the University of Puget Sound in Tacoma, WA, within the framework of the project Diaspora Jews, Romans, Others in the Greek Style Cities of First Century Crimea (1993-1994), has revealed evidence for a Jewish presence in the city (MacLennan 1996; Overman, MacLennan and Zolotarev 1997; Edwards 1999). A large piriform cistern of the Rom period was cleared in block XCVI, NE sector. A valuable overview of the pottery assemblage from a Hel cistern unearthed in the same block in 1991 is offered by Zolotarev (2005). He also provides more detail on 14 pit shelters discovered in the NE sector in the L 1980s, which are thought to be the earliest dwellings of the city's inhabitants. Their size varies from 4m2 to approximately 10m2. The material found in situ on the floors allows for a narrow date from the L5th-lst 3rd of the 4th Ct BC (Zolotarev 1998). In 2003, prior to the construction of the Packard Laboratory in the central area of the city, S.G. Ryzov and J.C. Carter excavated remains of an EHel house with foundations overlaying the graves of the earlier city's necropolis (Ryzov 2007). Some earlier burials have also been recorded in the N sector. Minor-scale rescue excavations have been conducted in the city's necropolis on both sides of Quarantine Bay (Usakov 1994; Turovskij, Filippenko and Stupko 2007), as well as in the W cemetery where 11 graves of the Rom period were excavated (Magda and Dmitriev 1997). At curtain 13 of the S defensive wall, the Ukrainian-American team (L. Sedikova, P. Arthur, A. Rabinowitz) completed many years of investigations of a large, 18m x 13.5m water cistern of the LRom-EMed period (Sedikova 1994; 1997; 2007). A new archaeological periodization of Chersonesean monuments was attempted by M.I. Zolotarev (2002). Drawing largely on the observations from his own work in the NE sector of the city (Zolotarev 1996; 1998), he distinguished 6 main periods: (1) LAr (528 BC-last quarter of the 5* Ct BC); (2) Cl (last quarter of the 5th Ct-ca. 330 BC); (3) Hel (last 3rd of the 4th-Mlst Ct BC); (4) Rom (Mlst Ct BC-E5th Ct AD); (5) Byz (E5th Ct-L13th Ct AD); (6) Post-Byz (from the 14th Ct AD). The heated debate which broke out in the late 1980s about the foundation date of the city has developed further. The suggested date of ca. 528/527 BC for the city's establishment (Vinogradov and Zolotarev 1998a; 1999a; 1999b; Zolotarev 1993; 1994; 1995a; 1996) continues to be questioned by various scholars (Zedgenidze 1993; Saprykin 1998; Bujs'kych 2006; Tochtas'ev 2007; Stojanov 2007), who basically argue for a somewhat later date for the material. Monachov and Abrosimov's study of the pottery from old and more recent excavations on the necropolis (1993; with profile drawings and catalogue) is an important contribution to this discussion. Out of 58 analysed and catalogued vessels, which include amphorae and table ware, one 6th (9 items) prove to antedate 422/421 BC, the conventional date of the city's foundation proposed by J.H. Schneiderwirth (1882) and A.I. Tjumenev (1938). Finds of fineware from the earlier excavations in the necropolis have been revisited by Stojanov (2005). Several articles address the issues of the city plan and defences of the Gr-LRom period (Zolotarev 1995b; Antonova 1996; Zubar' and Antonova 2001; Bujs'kych and Zolotarev 2002).</page><page sequence="25">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 139 Approximately 300 EHel grave stelae, their fragments and other architectural details, retrieved in the 1960s-1970s from tower XVII (of Zeno) and in the city wall, make up a central part of a publication project undertaken by J.C. Carter in collabora tion with R. Pozamentir, P. Perlman, V.N. Danilenko and A.V. Bujskich (Carter 2006). Danilenko (1996) suggests that a large group of architectural elements from this collection may in fact belong to the construction of sarcophagi. A peculiar group of local grave-markers, the anthropomorphic stelae, the ethno cultural attribution of which remains obscure, has been discussed by Bujskich and Zubar' (2006; note also Pozamentir 2005; Rogov and Stolba in print). As with the anthropomorphic grave-markers, the interpretation of contracted burials, most of which come from the city's N cemetery and constitute another peculiarity of local burial rites, continues to be fiercely disputed. The suggested interpretations range from regarding them as the burials of the socially dependent population, presumably of slaves (Zubar' 1995), through to the idea of a Gr origin of the rite (Kadeev 1995; Zubar' 2006b), to an utter scepticism of finding any plausible solution to the problem (Stojanov 2002; 2003). The organization of the Chersonesean mint, the metrology and chronology of the bronze and silver issues have been examined by S. Kovalenko (1999; 2003 [in Russian] = 2004 [in English]; 2005). His corpus of coins produced in the city in the LCI period appeared in the series Griechisches M?nzwerk in 2008. Important observations on the typology and chronolog ical sequence, and descriptions of new types have been made by Stolba and Turovskij (Stolba 1996c; Turovskij 1997a; 2003); Turovskij also offers a discussion of finds from the Herakleian Peninsula (1998). The coin-like pieces of lead, which some scholars consider tokens (Kovalenko 2002, 33-58; 2004b), while others interpret them as 'emergency' money (Turovskij 2005), have remained a matter of controversy, albeit the number of finds since their first description by Rostovcev (Tesserae plumbeae urbis Romae 1912) has increased signifi cantly. The Mithridatic bronze coins from the city's excavations have been brought together by S. Saprykin ( 1996), who also gives an overall account of coin circulation in the chora (2004; 2005). For finds from particular sites, see Stolba and Golencov 1999; 2000; Vnukov and Kovalenko 2004; Kovalenko 2006. Gold coinage of the lst-2nd Ct AD has been studied by Sidorenko (2001). The distribution and chronology of the Chersonesean coin hoards of the 4th-2nd Ct BC is the subject of a posthumous article by A. Gilevic ( 1999). Detailed description of 61 EHel coins from a hoard found in the 1970s on the SE slope of Mt Sapun is provided by Alekseenko ( 1998). Illicit metal detecting at the farmsteads of the Herakleian Peninsula brought to light 2 more hoards, as well as a number of new, previously unrecorded types (Sonov 2003; 2005; Sidorenko and Sonov 2006). Tense foreign relations seem to have affected coin circulation both in the chora and in the city, which resulted in a similar distribution pattern of hoards and stray finds (Stolba 2007c). Cessation of silver issues, systematic countermarking of circulating coins and deteriora tion of their alloy composition are likely indications of a crisis which struck the economy of Chersonesos and other major centres of the N Black Sea coast in the L4th or E3rd Ct BC (Stolba 2005c). Paleobotanical, limnological and archaeolog ical data available to date prompt the suggestion that the monetary crisis, like the general economic decline, was rooted in substantial environmental changes (Stolba 2005d). Finds of several new inscriptions sparked notable activity in epigraphic research as well. Eleven Gr inscriptions found in the excavations of the city in 1983-1991 have now been published by Solomonik (1996 = SEG 46, 923, 924, 927-28, 930-34, 936-37); for her no. 2 [= SEG 46, 923], a new reading has been suggested by Makarov (2000; 2002). A dedication of a certain Charmippos, son of Prytanis, to Sarapis, Isis and Anoubis, found in 1993 in the NE sector of the city, offers a valuable insight into the religious life of Chersonesos in the 3rd Ct BC (Vinogradov and Zolotarev 1998b; 2000 = SEG 50, 691; Bricault 2005, no. 115/0302). Except for one earlier known document (IOSPE I2, 5) and one recently found fragment from Tyras (Ivancik and Samojlova 2007), it furnishes the only epigraphic evidence for the worship of the Egyptian triad on the N Black Sea coast in the Hel period. An extensive text containing 2 decrees honouring T Aurelius Calpurnianus and his wife Paulina, which shed new light on relations between Chersonesos and Rome at the time of the Marcomannic Wars, was found by I.A. Antonova in the 1990 excavations in the harbour area (Antonova and Jajlenko 1995; Vinogradov 1996; Svencickaja 1996; Smysljaev 1996; Jajlenko 1999; 2000; Haensch 2005; Demougin and Loriot 2005; Bull?p [1997], 425; SEG 45, 985). Saprykin (1998a = SEG 48, 999) has published the 2nd Ct AD honorary decree for the Sinopean citizen Gaius Valerius. In 1993-2001 6 more fragments of Rom period inscriptions from the city excavations were brought to light by Makarov (2006b; 2007). IOSPE I2, 355, 423 and 691 have been republished with Italian translations by F. Canali De Rossi (1999, nos 148-50). Multiple articles have offered commentaries and new interpreta tions of inscriptions of the IOSPE previously published: no. 343: Vinogradov 1997b (new dating and restoration; conjecturing an attack by the Sarmatians on the city environs already around 280 BC); no. 349: Avram 2002, 71-73; no. 352: Gavrilov 1996; Avram 2000, 152; S. Anghel 1999-2000, 92-93; Heinen 2001, 500-02; no. 353: Avram 2002, 69-70; no. 365: Saprykin 2002b, 72-84; no. 381 : Makarov 2006b, 89-92 (adding a new fragment to the proxeny for the citizen of Amastria); no. 401: Botvinnik 1997; Gavrilov 1998 (on the term saster); Jajlenko 2001a; Jahne 2002 (dating); D?ssel 2003, 179-96; Stolba 2005d (on the economical implications of the text); Bondarenko and Ivanov 2006 (on the term saster); no. 402: Heinen 2005; Hojte 2005; no. 403: Turovskij 1992 (proposing a date in the 230s BC); Solomonik and Nikolaenko 1995 (a French version of their article published in 1990 in VDI); Bujskich 1998 (on the term hekatorygos); no. 404: Makarov 2003; no. 410: Makarov 2001 (proposing a new reading and arguing that the annual offices of the basileus and the priest of Parthenos were combined duties of one, not of 2 different officials); no. 418: Jajlenko 2001a; Zubar' 2004b (on the location of pedion mentioned in this inscription and IOSPE L, 401 ); no. 597: an epitaph of the commander of the Armenian archers, can now be supplemented by the fragment found in 1971. Makarov (2005; also in French [2006a]), who republished both fragments, challenges the traditional notion arguing for Armenia Minor and Kolchis being subdued to Mithridates VI prior to his conquest of Scythia. Along with the inscriptions on stone, a certain scholarly attention has been given to the inscriptions on pottery and other objects, such as loomweights, roof tiles, clay moulds, etc. (Solomonik 1993; 1994; 1995; Treister and Zolotarev 1993; Saprykin and D'jackov 1994; Turovskij 1997b; Efremov 1998). Vinogradov and Zolotarev ( 1999b) substantially extended the list of ostraka from Chersonesos, which now amounts to 45 entries and almost doubles the number presented in an earlier article by the authors. Supposing a democratic government, they date the implementation of ostracism to the E5th Ct BC. The chronology of these ostraka has, however, most recently been revised by Tochtas'ev (2007). An exhaustive study of the typology and chronology of stamps on local transport amphorae and roof tiles was undertaken by Kac (1994; 2006; 2007). Consisting of 3 groups, his chronological sequence</page><page sequence="26">140 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. embraces a period from ca. 325-179 BC. Different initial and terminal dates of the stamping, ca. 335/330 and ca. 150 BC respectively, have been proposed by Stolba (2005b), who also suggested a ca. 30-year gap in production in the 3rd Ct BC. Saprykin (1996b, the Russian version of this article being published in VDI [1996a]) argued, implausibly though, that enigmatic amphora stamps reading Skythikon, Taurikon and Athenaiou eis emporion refer to Chersonesean export to the Scythians and Taurians via Kalos Limen and Balaklava respec tively. A discussion of stamps with eis emporion has also been undertaken by Garlan (1993). The numerous finds of amphora stamps of Chersonesos from the Lower Don and the Dnieper areas testify to an extensive flow of local Gr wine into the barbarian hinterland and to the existence of a well-established communication system (Zolotarev 2000; see already Stolba 1990). Stamped measuring vessels from Chersonesos have been published by Fedoseev (2005). Several papers address the issues of onomastics and proso pography. A group of personal names which habitually was thought to be evidence for the presence of non-Greeks in the city's population is examined by Stolba (1993b; 1996a). Articles by Sceglov and Gilevic (1996), and by Rusjaeva (2003) have investigated the careers of Bathyllos and Agasikles respectively, the city's officials in the 4th-3rd Ct BC, whose names emerge on local coins and amphora stamps, as well as in the inscriptions. Balaklava An important discovery was made in the early 1990s in Balaklava, in the bay which anc. literary sources refer to as Symbolon Limen. Here, construction works disclosed the remains of a Rom building, presumably barracks, 9 rooms of which were unearthed in 1991-1992 by rescue excavations. The building was destroyed by fire sometime in the 1st half of the 3rd Ct AD. Among the roof tiles, about 70 fragments bear the stamps VEMI, VEM, LEXICL and CAL A hoard found inside the building contained 57 Rom denarii, the youngest coin being struck under Alexander Severus (Savelja 1994; 1997). In 1996-1997, excavations conducted 170m NE of this area revealed remains of a sanctuary of Iuppiter Dolichenus related to the Rom garrison stationed here in the 2nd half of the 2nd and the 1st half of the 3rd Cts AD (Samowski and Savelja 1998; 2000; Savelja and Samovskij 1999; Kryzyc'kyj and Zubar' 2000). The Latin inscriptions found in the sanctuary in 1996 have been published by Zubar', Savelja and Samovskij (1997; also in German: Samowski, Zubar' and Savelja 1998), with illustrations of other finds too. Synchronous components of the Rom infrastructure are now found on the W coast of the Balaklava Bay (Ivanov 2002). The activities prior to the Genoese colonization of the area are also documented at the site of the Med fortress of Chembalo placed on top of the rocky Mt Kastron at the entrance to the Balaklava Bay, where coin finds of the Rom and Byz periods were made (Alekseenko 2007). Taurians The Taurians of the anc. literary sources, traditionally associated with the Kizil-Koba Culture (KKC), occupied, according to Herodotus (4.99), the mountainous part of Crimea as well as the foothills all the way up to the city of Kerkinitis. The ethno cultural processes in this area at the rum of the LBA and EIA were the subject of a study by VA. Kolotuchin, who argued for a genetic relationship between the KKC and the Sabatinovka and Belozerka Cultures of the LBA (Kolotuchin 1996). The KKC was also a topic of 2 PhD dissertations defended in St Petersburg and Kiev (Senatorov 2002; Kravcenko 2008). S.N. Senatorov has offered a treatment of KKC pottery from excavations in Chersonesos (2000; 2003). The chronology of KKC has been reassessed by Vlasov (1997b). Excavation continued at the settlement of Shpil', 1km SE of the village of Druznoe, Simferopol district. Here, no traces of continuous cultural layers or above-ground structures have been recorded, but 99 household pits, spread over an area of ca. 5,000m2 and filled with the local handmade and imported pottery of the L5th-4th Ct BC, testify to the Taurian presence (Chrapunov and Vlasov 1995; 1996-1997). A similar situation was observed at the village of Tenistoe, Bachcisaraj district, where 20 household pits containing pottery of Kizil-Koba type and fragments of a bg Attic skyphos of the L5th Ct BC were disclosed (Zajcev 2007a). In the Sarandinaki ravine, in the territory of plot 338 of the Chersonesean home chora, such pits were related to the remains of a hut-like structure. One of the pits contained a double burial of a male and a female accompanied by 2 dogs. Given the material of the L5th-E4th Ct BC, the site must antedate the Gr land division. Contemporary sites with KKC material were also recorded in other parts of the Herakleian Peninsula near the Maksimova Daca, the English cemetery and the Laboratornaja ravine (Savelja 1994; 1997). Remains of a rectangular Taurian pit shelter, datable roughly to the same period, were recorded W of the Balaklava Bay at the site of Karan' 2 (Senatorov 1998). An updated catalogue of the KKC sites on the Herakleian Peninsula can now be found in Kravcenko (2005). Recently she resumed excavations at the site of Uc-Bas in the vicinity of Inkerman. A full publication of the material from A.M. Leskov's excavations of 1956-1957 at ridge A of the Taurian necropolis of Urkusta I is now available (Leskov and Kravcenko 2007). The lower date proposed for the necropolis, the L3rd Ct BC, challenges the existing notion about the termination date of the KKC. The anthropological data from various Taurian cemeteries seem to indicate the prevalence of the mesobrachi cranial, broad-faced type (Nazarova 1997). The emergence of ethnonymic hybrids such as Tauroskythai and Skythotauroi in the inscriptions and narrative of the Rom period is likely to reflect actual ethnic processes in the foothill and steppe zone of Crimea, which, having started fairly early, must have increased in the Mithridatic and post-Mithridatic periods (Stolba 1993a). Scythian and Sarmatian Sites of the Crimean Steppes and Foothills The fieldwork conducted by the North Crimean Expedition of the Crimean Branch of the Institute of Archaeology in the N, NW and central part of Crimea has expanded substantially our knowledge of Scythian burials of the EIA. Published reports of the campaigns of 1981-1991 and 1991-1993 are now available (Koltuchov, Kislyj and Toscev 1994; Koltuchov, Kolotuchin and Kislyj 1994; Kolotuchin 2000). Along with the history of research in the field of Scythian antiquities (Koltuchov and Jurockin 2004), the fortifications of Crimean Scythia and the burial rites of its population in the LHel and Rom periods have been the subject of special studies (Koltuchov 1999; Puzdrovskij 2007). Scythian Neapolis (Simferopol) Scythian Neapolis, the presumed capital, or, rather, one of the capitals of the Scythian Kingdom, has been excavated system atically throughout most of the period in question. The main attention was given to finalizing the excavations of the so</page><page sequence="27">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 141 called Southern Palace, the supposed residence of King Skiluros (Zajcev 1994; 1997a). Ju.P. Zajcev has established 2 main stages in the history of this building with multiple sub periods, which correspond to stratigraphical horizons E and D of the site and cover a period from around 140 to ca. 112/108 BC (1995; 2005; 2007b). Excavations in 1999 of the SW part of the Southern Palace produced multiple fragments of a funerary epigram for Argotas, presumably a Scythian chieftain of the 2nd Ct BC (Vinogradov and Zajcev 2003), which must have decorated his heroon built in the immediate vicinity of the central gate. Anthropological data from the city's necropolis were treated by Nazarova (2005). A synthesis of the new research conducted at this site since the 1980s can be found in a monograph by Zajcev, in Russian and English (2003; 2004). Sites of the Late Scythian and Sarmatian Cultures West and Southwest of Simferopol The settlement of Bulganak, which some scholars identify with the Scythian royal fortress of the Chabaioi of the Diophantos decree (IOSPE I2, 352), has not been excavated since 1991. Several articles which have appeared in the period under report offer a discussion of its fortifications (Chrapunov and Mul'd 1993) and pottery assemblage (amphora stamps: Chrapunov and Fedoseev 1997; handmade pottery: Vlasov 1997a). In the same area, near the village of Kol'cugino, the University of Simferopol undertook excavations of 14 graves, some containing multiple burials, in the necropolis associated with the nearby Scythian settlement of the 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD (Chrapunov, Masjakin and Mul'd 1997). The results of earlier excavations at the settlement and necropolis of Ust' Alminskoe near the village of Pescanoe, Bachcisaraj district, are now brought together by Vysotskaja (1994). In the reporting period, the expedition of the Simferopol Institute of Archaeology, headed by A. Puzdrovskij, continued excavation at the necropolis of this site, where 626 new graves in an area of ca. 5,000m2 have been excavated. The earliest complexes, datable to the 1st Ct BC-lst Ct AD, often contain multiple burials, sometimes placed head to toe, in earthen vaults or simple trenches. Many graves of the 2nd half of the lst-E2nd Ct AD contained richly furnished burials of the Sarmatian ?lite (Loboda, Puzdrovskij and Zajcev 2002; Puzdrovskij and Zajcev 2004). In particular to be mentioned are remains of Chinese lacquer boxes. Over 100 burials on the territory of ca. lha had been robbed near the village of Levadki, ca. 5km S of Simferopol. The excavations undertaken there in 1997 by the University of Simferopol and the Crimean Branch of the Institute of Orientalistics unearthed 12 Scythian graves which date from the 1st Ct BC-3rd Ct AD, and were left by the inhabitants of the nearby settlement of Zmeinoe (Chrapunov, Stojanova and Mul'd 2001). In 2003, rescue excavations took place at the necropolis associated with the L Scythian settlement of Balta-Cokrak, near the village of Skalistoe, Bachcisaraj district, where around 500 graves were destroyed by robbers in 2001-2002. Thirty-nine burials unearthed during these excavations, of which the majority is represented by niche graves, date to the 2nd-3rd Ct AD. Anthropological data were retrieved from 15 burials (Zajcev et al. 2005b). Extensive robbing instigated rescue excavations at other locations too. Burials of the Rom period are reported from the necropoleis near the villages of Suvorovo (Belyj and Nenevolja 1994; Zajcev 1997b; Zajcev and Mordvinceva 2003), Krasnaja Zarja (Belyj and Nenevolja 1997; Nenevolja 2007; Volosinov, Masjakin and Nenevolja 2007), Cholmovka (Trufanov, Puzdrovskij and Medvedev 2004) and Visnevoe (Turovskij 2002), and on the Kazan-Tas hill (Zajcev 1997b). Vdovicenko and Koltuchov (1994) have published 6 Sarmatian burials of the 3rd Ct AD, excavated by the Bachcisaraj Museum in 1986 near the village of Tankovoe. In 2004, the State Historical Museum, Moscow, resumed investi gations near the village of Ljubimovka at the necropolis of Belbek IV, where during 1991-1996 over 300 graves had been destroyed by robbers (Zuravlev and Firsov 2004). The publication of 331 burials of the lst-3rd Ct AD, excavated there by the Moscow team in the period 1969-1991, has now been prepared by Guscina and Zuravlev. The Crimean Branch of the Institute of Archaeology, in collaboration with the Bachcisaraj Museum and the Freie Universit?t, Berlin, has undertaken rescue excavations of the Alma-Kermen settlement and the necropolis at the village of Zavetnoe, datable to the lst-3rd Ct AD (Zajcev et al. 2005a; 2007). In grave 310 an Achaemenid intaglio of the 5th/4th Ct BC was found (Fig. 18). A treatment of red-glazed pottery from this necropolis is offered by E. K?hnelt (2007). At the settlement, a destruction layer of the 2nd Ct AD produced multiple finds of roof tile bearing the stamps LEXICL (Zajcev et al. 2007). The burial structures and grave goods from the previously excavated necropolis, Sovchoz 10, have been addressed in a number of articles by Vysotskaja (1998; 2000; 2001; Vysotskaja and Zestkova 1999). iR 18. Zavetnoe: Achaemenid intaglio from the late Scythian necropolis</page><page sequence="28">142 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. Sites of the Late Scythian and Sarmatian Cultures East and Southeast of Simferopol A complex ethno-cultural composition, including L Scythian, Sarmatian and Alanian burials of the lst-4th Ct AD, was observed at the necropolis of Opuski, 15km E of Simferopol, and excavated by an expedition of the University of Simferopol in 2003-2004. In 1990-1994, the same team, headed by I.N. Chrapunov, explored the 3rd-4th Ct AD necropolis of Druznoe (Chrapunov 2002), SE of Simferopol in the immediate vicinity of the settlement of Zolotoe Jarmo, which Chrapunov excavated in 1990-1991 (Chrapunov e/a/. 1994). Since 1996, the University of Simferopol has been involved in the excavations of the Rom necropolis of Nejzac (Neusatz) near the mod. village of Balanovo. Two consistent chronolog ical horizons were established, which are associated with the Sarmatian and Alanian presence. Eight LBA burials found there among the graves of the Rom period were attributed to the Belozerka Culture (Chrapunov et al. 2004; Chrapunov and Muid 2005). Surprisingly, a contemporary settlement of the 2nd-4th Ct AD, excavated in the Barabanovskaja ravine, just 200m away from the Nejzac necropolis, features a quite different material culture which was attributed to the L Scythian period (Chrapunov, Vlasov and Smokotina 2007). In 1996, the Crimean Branch of the Institute of Archaeology started investigations of the Scythian aristocratic necropolis on the ridges of the Ak-Kaja and Bes-Oba hills, in the E part of the Crimean foothills, where 65 barrows have been located (Koltuchov and Myc 2001). Many of them date to the 4th Ct BC, containing occasionally intmsive burials of the Rom period. The context of the main burial in tumulus Bes-Oba IV/2 has been treated by Koltuchov (2007). Kimmerian Bosporus (Fig. 19) The study of the anc. cities in Bosporos and the Bosporan Kingdom was particularly affected by the disintegration of the Soviet Union in 1991, as the 2 sides of the straits suddenly belonged to 2 different newly formed countries. Many of the Russian archaeological expeditions, which traditionally had been working on sites of the Gr and Rom period in S Ukraine, particularly in the Crimea, changed the regions of their investi gations, focusing their efforts on S Russia instead. Despite the considerable difficulties of the 1990s it has proved possible for many scientific institutions to preserve their main staff and to obtain the necessary funds for conducting excavations. Publications The periodical Drevnosti Bospora (Bosporan Antiquities) has appeared annually since 1998, and Bosporskie Issledovanija (Bosporos Studies), published since 2001, now numbers 20 volumes, many of which are monographs, while other volumes include longer articles from the Bosporan Readings. Bosporskij sbornik has appeared irregularly since 1992. Numerous monographs concerning Bosporan history and archaeology have appeared. To mention a few: S.Ju. Saprykin (2002a) addresses the E post-Mithridatic period; the Bosporan army is studied by M. Mielczarek (1999), VA. Goroncarovskij (2003) and Ju.A. Vinogradov (2004); and N.I. Vinokurov (1999; 2007) offers an exhaustive treatment of wine making (and consumption). Further chapters of Rostovcev's unfinished study on Scythia and the Bosporos have been made available in German translation (Heinen 1993) and his book on the wall paintings of S Russia has been reprinted (Rostovtseff 1913? 1914). The coinage of the cities in Bosporos and the Bosporan Kingdom are treated in several studies (Frolova 1997; Anochin Azov Sea Kuchugury Golubitskoer? Black Sea Gorgippia 19. Kimmerian Bosporos</page><page sequence="29">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 143 1999; Frolova and Ireland 2002; Frolova 2004; Abramzon et al. 2006). An illustrated new edition of Corpus Inscriptionum Regni Bosporani appeared in 2004 (Gavrilov et al. 2004). Although questions about the content of the volume have been raised, the accompanying CDs with illustrations provide a useful tool. Graffiti and dipinti have been collected by S.Ju. Saprykin and A.A. Maslennikov (2007). Kerch Peninsula Athenaion (Kutlak) At Kutlak, 8km SW of Sudak, excavations continued into the early 1990s, headed by S.B. Lancov (1999), and uncovered nearly the entire site of a single period fortress built under Asander (47-17 BC) and continuing no later than Aspurgos (8 37/38 AD). The site may be the Skythotauron Limen or Athenaion mentioned by later sources. A pentagonal structure covering more than 1,500m2 has one large and 3 smaller towers, and rooms inside along 3 walls. In the court, a row of 6 rooms extends from the S wall. The pottery and the ethnic implications of the composition of the assemblage, consisting mostly of handmade ware, are considered in Lantsov and Yurochkin 2007. Theodosia (Feodosia) The chora of Theodosia has been explored extensively by A.V Gavrilov, and the number of known Gr and Rom sites now totals around 80. His monograph (Gavrilov 2004) includes a catalogue of sites and of coin finds, and also contains information on recent excavations carried out at rural sites, notably Novopokrovka 1 (5th-3rd Ct BC) and Uzun Syrt (6th-3rd Ct BC). Kuru Bas, a settlement founded in the 3rd Ct BC, discovered in 2003 after reports of coin finds in the area, apparently received a Mithridatic garrison in a nearby fort controlling the E approaches to the city after the area was incor porated into the Pontic Kingdom. At Tepe-Oba, 4km W of Theodosia, a single farmstead from the M6 Ct BC grew into a larger settlement in the 5th and 4th Cts. The material resembles Scythian and Kizil-Koba cultures (Bejsans et al. 1997). A total of 1,262 amphora stamps has been recorded in the chora (Gavrilov and Fedoseev 2002), with the overwhelming majority being Herakleian (700) and Sinopean (446). Kim mer ikon After having been inaccessible for 50 years due to the presence of a military installation, exploration of the site of Kimmerikon at Mt Opuk was resumed in 1991. Results of recent fieldwork are offered by the late VK. Golenko (2006; for a summary in English, see Golenko 2007). The exact location of the early town has not been established. Traditionally, it has been located on the SW slopes or on hill A to the SE, but walls and material from the L6* Ct BC to the Med period have been detected on the N slopes as well. In the citadel on Mt Opuk a section of the W curtain wall and proteichisma and 3 adjoining rooms, one of them with a kiln, were excavated. This enabled the dating of the fortification to not earlier than the E4th Ct AD, although the present structure probably overlies an earlier construction. The surprising find of a Runic inscription below the walls of the citadel has caused some debate (Golenko et al. 1999). Investigations of the chora have revealed more than 30 mral settlements. Excavation and surface finds show that the sites closest to Kimmerikon began in the L5th Ct BC, while the whole territory flourished in the 4th and 3rd Cts until, by the 2nd Ct BC, only the larger sites remained. Kytai Excavations at Kytai, at the entrance to the straits, were continued by E.A. Molev until 1996 and again from 2005. In a ritual complex consisting of 4 houses of the 2nd-5th Ct AD, animal sacrifices, predominantly of dogs, took place (Molev and Moleva 2007). It has, furthermore, been possible to establish that the city was abandoned in the L6th Ct AD. Excavation at the necropolis has revealed further graves of the 3rd Ct BC and of L antiquity. Molev's monograph on Kytai is now in print. Akra In 1994, fieldwork resumed at the site of Akra, discovered on the seashore and below sea level near the village of Nabereznoe in the E 1980s (Kulikov 2007). Parts of the Hel city wall with towers have been traced both above and below sea level along with a number of Rom houses consisting of a courtyard and one or 2 rooms, dated to the 2nd and 3rd Cts AD, have been uncovered. The size of the double-faced foundation walls may suggest 2-storey buildings, which appear not to have had tiled roofs. One house has a primitive wine press. The finds at the site yield few clues as to the date of the foundation, but evidence from the chora indicates a date around 530-520 BC. Occupation on the site seems to have been continuous until the 5th Ct AD. In the chora of Akra 10 unfortified rural sites have been identified. The largest of these was Zavetnoe 5 located 1.5km NW of Akra, which was excavated from 1999 (?epko 2002). The only traces of the early occupation of the site in the L6th-5th Ct BC are more than 50 household pits. Two dug-outs with an associated threshing floor dated to the L4th E3rd Ct BC belong to the latest period of occupation at the site. Nymphaion On the S slope of the city of Nymphaion, excavation of the t?menos (sector M) has continued (Sokolova 2000). Of particular interest is the find of an Ionic propylon at the entrance to the t?menos (Sokolova and Pavlicenko 2002) (Fig. 20a, 20b). The 50-odd architectural fragments found, made of local limestone, were stuccoed with marble dust to resemble marble and painted red, blue and yellow. The structure carried a dedicatory inscription by the agonothetes Theopropides to Leukon I (393-353 or 387-347 BC), who is called archon of Bosporos, Theodosia, all of Sindika and of the Toretai, Dandarioi and Psessoi. From 1994-1998, a Polish-Russian team excavated sector N in the SW part of town (Cistov and Domzalski 2002). A pit with LAr material indicates that the area was used from relatively early on. A large part of the excavated material belongs to the L5th-M4th Ct BC, with many Chian, Thasian and Herakleian amphora fragments. No Hel material was found, but the area came into use again during the Rom period, from when a number of storage pits has produced ample ceramic material. The final, 3rd Ct AD, phase revealed signs of irregular town planning. In 1995 a refuse dump was excavated outside the city wall to the SE with a wide selection of Rom fineware, notably Pontic Sigillata, some of which was subjected to X-ray fluores cence analysis (Domzalski &amp; Zin'ko 2000). Excavation of the city's necropolis has continued uninter rupted (Solov'ev 2003), and the material from the large excavations in the 1970s has been published by Grac (1999). A number of articles concern the spectacular find in 1982 of the graffito of the ship Isis, notably those by Ju.G Vinogradov (1998) and O. H?ckmann (1998). In 1999 a conference on</page><page sequence="30">144 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. /\ 20a. Nymphaion: Ionic propylon at the entrance to the t?menos Nymphaion was held in St Petersburg in commemoration of the 60th anniversary of the expedition (Boriskovskaja et al. 1999). A full bibliography of Nymphaion has appeared (Kunina et al. 1995) with later addenda and corrigenda (ArcheologiaWarsz 46, 89-91; 50,83-86). Much work has been done in the chora of Nymphaion, particularly by V.N. Zin'ko (2003) and a Ukrainian-Russian Polish collaborative project, and an archaeological map of the territory of Nymphaion has been produced (Scholl and Zinko 1999). Survey, geophysical prospection and trial excavations have identified 16 necropoleis and 42 settlements, some of which have been more fully excavated. At Geroevka 2 on the seashore 4km S of Nymphaion (excavated in 1992-1994) 2 dug-outs yielding material of the L5th-L4th Ct BC were found. A small pit in the S part of the excavation revealed the earliest phase of the settlement in the L6th-E5th Ct BC. The dug-outs, the high percentage of handmade pottery present and the burial rites at the site suggest that the site may have been settled at least in part by the indigenous population. After long abandonment, a farmhouse built in the 6th Ct AD was occupied until its sudden destruction in the 8th Ct AD (Butjagin and Solovyov 2001). Generally the most extensive use of the chora occurred in the L4th_E3rd Ct BC An aqueduct, dated to the 4th Ct BC and consisting of ceramic pipes surrounded by stone masonry with stone observation shafts, was discovered 2km W of the town (Scholl and Zin'ko 1999, 107-12) (Fig. 21). i fc'j h h fc-j m loi tinn rn n 11 m i h 11 ii 2500 20b.

Goroncarovskij (2007). To the N, a long underground tunnel, not unlike the ones encountered in Pontos, lead to a water supply outside the walls, and along the NE wall other water installations have been found. In the upper necropolis more than 200 predominantly inhumation graves, both pit and cist graves and chamber tombs, have now been excavated. A clear change is seen from the earlier 1st Ct AD pit graves closer to the city to the 2nd-3rd Ct AD cist graves and chamber tombs further away. Weapons, 'Sarmatian' mirrors and, particularly, the deformation of the skulls suggest that a new ethnic group became predominant around the turn of the 1st and 2nd Cts AD (Gorontcharovskiy 2007, 909-10). Many finds from the Hel period confirm the suggestion that Rom Iluraton was built on an already existing site (Chrsanovskij 2003). A bone object found in tomb 211, with engravings, has been interpreted as a calendar (Moleva, Tul'pe and Chrsanovskij 2004). Tyritake In 2002, excavations at Tyritake, 11km SW of Kerch, were resumed by V.N. Zin'ko (Zin'ko, Ponomarev and Zin'ko 2004), opening a large section in the central part of the city (sector XXVI). This has revealed a Rom residential quarter, which also included storage facilities and a further fish salting installation consisting of 3 vats which functioned in the 3rd-E5th Ct AD. The area was partially built over in the Med period. Other sectors in the city have been re-excavated and preserved. NE of the city a L antique necropolis was excavated (Ermolin 2006). Pantikapaion (Kerch) The results of the last 20 years of excavation on the acropolis at Pantikapaion are summarized by V.P. Tolstikov (2002; 2003). On the W plateau of the first saddle, excavations of the basileia of the Spartokids has been completed (Fig. 22). The complex, built around the M4th Ct BC, covered an area of 1,350m2. The 2-storey building was centred around a rectangular peristyle courtyard Under the basileia, remains of 4 houses of the L5th E4th Ct BC! were uncovered, one of which had a coloured pebble mosaic in the andron. In a well in the courtyard, a large marble head of a goddess was deposited. The excavators have identified her as Athena and dated her to the M4th Ct BC (Tolstikov 2002, fig. 19). A head covering, helmet or polos, was added separately in a different material. The style and technique suggest that she is rather a 2nd Ct BC acrolith. Immediately to the N of the basileia, the foundation (10.5m x 7.4m) and architectural fragments of a Doric temple in antis were found (Svitaseva 1999). The temple was built in the M4th Ct BC, and seemingly survived until destroyed by an earthquake, probably the one in 63 BC. Among the new epigraphic finds is a proxeny decree of Leukon I (Vinogradov, Tolstitov and Selov-Kovedjaev 2002). On a plateau further to the W, another Doric temple in antis (8.4m x 3.8m) was found (Zin'ko 2001). Stamped roof tiles indicate an E3rd Ct BC date for the construction. The interior was covered with painted stucco on which graffiti had been scratched. The temple was apparently destroyed in a fire shortly before the M 1st Ct BC. The rich finds (3rd- 1st Ct BC) include amphorae, table wares, including mouldmade bowls and a lagynos, terracottas (mostly females), 48 coins, notably a gold stater of Mithridates VI, and a small marble head, possibly a portrait of Mithridates VI (Zin'ko 2004, 185). Recently 2 workshops, a terracotta workshop of the 2nd Ct BC and a pottery workshop producing terra sigillata of the 1st 3rd Ct AD, have been excavated (Ermolin, Gecko and Kulikov 2007). On the N slopes of Mt Mithridates, a system of L antique catacombs has been investigated (Zin'ko and Bejlin 2005). The 1st Ct AD Tomb of Demeter, with frescos showing the rape of Persephone and a medallion with the head of Demeter, found in 1895, was restored after serious danger of destruction (Zinko et al. forthcoming). In 1995 a hoard of more than 450 Bosporan copper coins was found by chance (Abramzon et al. 2006, 117-31). Two of the coins were struck in the final year of Bosporan coinage, 341 AD. Interestingly a coin of Kotys I (49-54 AD) was still in circulation around the M4th Ct AD. In light of new evidence, M.Ju. Trejster considers a Rom military presence at Pantikapaion evident (Trejster 1993). Myrmekion Excavations in the small town of Myrmekion, NE of Kerch, were continued by Ju.A. Vinogradov until 1994. A small LAr fort was unearthed on the W part of the site, along with the more substantial EC1 city wall (Vinogradov and Tochtas'ev 1994). Fieldwork was resumed in 1999 in the SW part of the city (sectors S and T) and earlier excavations in the central Sanctuary of Demeter (sector I) were continued. In sector T, 2 fragments of marble inscriptions were found, one mentioning Demeter Thesmophore, the other an early manumission decree mentioning Aspourgos. A set of 74 loomweights had apparently been stored in a wooden box (Butjagin et al. 2004a). In sector I, excavations have clarified the chronology of the sanctuary. The house-like building with an altar erected in the 1st half of the 5th Ct was covered by an ash hill around 400 BC. Around 370 BC another house-like stmcture was built, which again was covered by an ash hill around 300-250 BC (Butjagin 2004). In 2003, a hoard of 99 Kyzikean electrum staters (53 different types) concealed in a bronze jug (Fig. 23) was found in the Sanctuary of Demeter (Butjagin et al. 2004b). The context indicates that the jug was placed in a pit in the comer of the sanctuary no earlier than 375-350 BC, possibly in connection with the ongoing struggle against Herakleia. Another hoard of 722 Pantikapaian copper coins of the 3rd Ct BC was found in sector S in 2002 (Abramzon et al. 2006, 31 37). An exhibition in 2006 at the State Hermitage Museum was devoted to the finds from Myrmekion (catalogue: Butjagin et al. 2006). Porthmion Excavations at Porthmion, directed by M. Vachtina, were resumed in 2002 after an interval of more than 10 years. Investigations have been concentrated on the early phases of the town's existence. Houses with stone foundations and mud brick walls dated to the 2nd half of the 6th Ct BC have been uncovered. So far no dug-outs have been found in Porthmion. From around the turn of the 6th and 5th Cts BC, there are clear signs of widespread destmction. It has lately been possible to locate the town's necropolis 300m to the W. Seven graves belonging to the 3rd-2nd Ct BC have been excavated. Two recently robbed crypts, both consisting of a burial chamber and dromos, contained multiple burials (Vachtina 2005). Northern Kerch Peninsula Many mral settlements of the 4th Ct BC-3rd Ct AD have been investigated along the Azov Sea coast of the Kerch Peninsula by the Northern Crimean Archaeological Expedition since 1993, including General'skoe-Zapadnoe, Artezian (Vinokurov 1998), Pustynnyj Bereg, Zelenyj Mys and Il'icevka, but fuller publication is still awaited for most (summary of results in Maslennikov 1998). A site hierarchy seems to have existed, with larger fortified sites, such as General'skoe-Zapadnoe, functioning as central collecting points for produce.

Two new fish-salting installations at Salacik (excavated in 1987) and Zolotoe (in 1990) have been published (Vinokurov 1994), showing that the manufacture of fish products was not confined to the already known installations at Tyritake and Myrmekion. The 2 new complexes, dated to the 2nd-4th Ct AD, had somewhat larger tanks than the previously known examples. During the last 2 decades, several rural sanctuaries have been identified. A.A. Maslennikov (2007) offers full publication of several of these sites for the first time. At the settlement of Poljanka (see also Maslennikov 2006), the uninhabited room 11 has been interpreted as a heroon. Most remarkable among the finds dated to the M 1st Ct BC is a set of 33 terracottas, including Men, Kybele, Mithras, a Mithras-Attis horseman, a Thracian rider, a Dionysos mask, Aphrodite, an Apis bull and Herakles, indicating a strong foreign and, partie</page><page sequence="33">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 147 23.

In the neighbouring rooms 4 and 11,2 coin hoards were found in 1984 and 1985, and have now been published by Frolova (1998). The first consisted of 70 copper coins, mostly Bosporan but also several from Pontic cities. Coins of Asandros give a tpq for the hoard in the 3rd quarter of the 1st Ct BC, which also dates the destruction of the site. The 2nd hoard consisted of 1,140 copper coins predominantly from Pantikapaion. On the flat summit above General'skoe-Vostocnoe, 2 ritual complexes were excavated. The W one consisted of a small square room (2.5m by 3m) and a larger rectangular room. In the smaller room several terracottas were found together with handmade incense burners along with lamps on tall stems and a small terracotta altar. The complex is dated to the 2nd-E3rd Ct AD, although finds of mouldmade bowls and a bronze arrowhead may indicate earlier use as well. The larger E complex consisted of a row of 5 rectangular shrines with one to 3 rooms, which all have the door opening to the E (Fig. 24). Each has a square or round altar in the centre of the largest room and what would appear to have been benches along the walls. No architectural details or roof tiles have been found. A large collection of mouldmade bowls and glass vessels was found, as well as numerous terracottas and incense burners. Most interesting is a votive relief, probably depicting deities of the Eleusinian circle. The sanctuary was constructed around the M3rd Ct BC. After its destmction, possibly by the earthquake of 63 BC, it was reconstructed and continued functioning until the 3rd Ct AD. Three further sanctuaries at the settlement of Sirenevaja Buchta (lst-3rd Ct AD), at Uscel'e Ved'm (cult debris of the 2nd Ct BC-2nd Ct AD) and at a cave on Mt Sjujurtas (3rd-2nd Ct BC) have been published (Maslennikov 2007). Furthermore, ash hills (zol'niki) in the N Kerch Peninsula and a house sanctuary at General'skoe-Zapadnoe are considered by Maslennikov (2007). A.A. Maslennikov (2003) has discussed the numerous ramparts running across the Kerch Peninsula, both the ones known for centuries and those more recently identified. Using trial trenches and C14 dating, he has been able to date several of the ramparts more precisely. The large wall running from Lake Uzunlar to Kazantip Bay to the N dates to the 3rd Ct BC, with additions made in the 1st or 2nd Ct AD. The so-called Tyritake ramparts actually consist of 3 different sets of defensive structures, only one of which is dated to the Gr period. In addition, there were smaller ramparts enclosing Ak-Burun and the territory of Nymphaion. The chora of the Bosporan Kingdom as a whole and the rural settlements have been discussed by A.A. Maslennikov (1998), SJu. Saprykin (2004a) and V.N. Zin'ko (2007), while T.N. Smekalova and S.L. Smekalov (2006) have used aerial photographs and old maps to identify roads and anc. land-division systems. The plots of land detectable in many parts of the Kerch Peninsula are invariably square and measure 350m x 350m. RUSSIA Northern Maiotis Taganrog Taganrog in the Don delta is the earliest Gr colony in the territory of Russia. It was settled in the L7th or E6th Ct BC. Investigations, which concentrated on the S shore of the river, were initiated in 2004 as a collaboration between the All Russian Community of Surviving Monuments of History and Culture (VOOPIK) in Rostov on Don (A.O. Kozin and P.A. Larenok), the Paedagogical University at the same place (VP. Kopylov) and the Eurasia Abteilung of the DAI (O. Dally and M. Ullrich) (Dally and Larenok 2002; Kopylov et al. 2005; Kopylov and Solov'ev 2005). A series of drillings and exploratory trenches reaching a d. of almost 7m has been carried out by the Geophysical Department of the Institut fur I i7 "??w?,?

EGr pottery is continuously washed from the site to the shore of the Don. To date, more than 20,000 pieces of pottery - of high quality and predominantly EGr - are known. A catalogue of pottery from the site, kept in Taganrog Museum, was published in 1994 (Kopulov and Larenok 1994). Tanais Investigations at Tanais took place during the whole period under review, from 1993 until today, the results of which have been summarized in several articles, as well as in a monograph (Arsen'eva et al. 2007). For more than 10 years, a Russian German expedition investigated the S part of the town (Arsen'eva 1999). From 1993, the German archaeological team conducted excavations in sector XIX, where they extended the area to the N, E and S to explore the Hel and Rom agora (Arsen'eva, Fomasier and Ullrich 2002). From 2002 2005, the central square area was investigated. Two towers have been revealed in the central part of W fortification line. A Russian-Polish archaeological group, directed by T Sholl, continued investigations of the W fortified line (Arsen'eva et al. 2006). The monograph NekropoT Tanaisa. Raskopki 1981 1995 gg. summarized the results of the excavations conducted by the Lower Don Expedition of the Russian Academy of Sciences in the E and W necropoleis of Tanais for 15 years (Arsen'eva, Bezuglov and Tolocko 2001). Excavations of the flat ground necropolis of Tanais were carried out between 2002 and 2004. They covered a wide chronological period - from the Hel to the Migration period. The last phase of the necropolis was dated to the 2nd half of the 5th-1st half of the 6th Ct AD (Arsen'eva, Bezuglov and Tolocko 2005). The first volume of the Pontus Septentrionalis was devoted to the amphora dipinti (B?ttger and Shelov 1998). Elizavetovskoe The fortified settlement, situated in the delta of the River Don 3km NE of the mod. village of Elizavetovskoe, was one of the largest settlements of the N Pontic steppe zone in the EIA, serving as a nodal point in inter-tribal and 'international' trade. From the M4th Ct BC it could be considered as the 'capital' of the Lower Don region and perhaps even of the entire NE Azov area. Excavation of the site and its chora has been carried out since 1954 by the Southern Don Expedition of the Institute of the History of Material Culture (Russian Academy of Sciences, St Petersburg). Four main periods have been established. (1) 3rd-4th quarter of the 6th-5th Ct BC, lasting for about 100 years. During this period the site constituted the winter quarter of one of the nomadic tribes of the Lower Don region. (2) The entire 1st half of the 4th Ct BC. During this time the settlement became the largest trading centre of the NE Pontic region. (3) In the 2nd half of the 4* Ct BC the site became a strongly fortified barbarian site with a separate Gr quarter. (4) The last period was brief, ca. 300-280s/270s BC. During this period an extended Gr settlement was located on the acropolis. The results of the investigations are summarized in the monograph by Marcenko, Zitnikov and Kopylov (2000). The kurgan necropolis of Elizavetovskoe is one of the most fully investigated among the Scythian cemeteries of the N Pontic steppe. Weapons from the burials of the 5th Ct BC have been published by S.Ju. Jangulov (2008). An article by A.N. Kovalenko (2008) analyses funerary complexes of the 2nd half ofthe4thCtBC. Niznegnilovskoe A fortified settlement situated ca. 16km E of Elizavetovskoe was investigated by a Russian-Swiss expedition (Kopylov, Tomasevic-Buck, Ivanov and Kovalenko 2002). The site's necropolis was excavated in 2002 (Prochorova 2004). Taman' Peninsula In 1993 the Taman' Expedition team of the IA RAS published an archaeological map of the Taman' Peninsula based on comprehensive investigations during the period 1931-1985. A detailed chronology of amphorae of the 6th-5th Ct BC was issued (Abramov and Paromov 1993; Paromov 2000) and P.A. Abramov published a compact handbook for the identification of amphora production centres based on analyses of archaeo logical assemblages from the Athenian Agora and N Black Sea centres (Abramov 1993). The role of interdisciplinary research in Cl archaeology has increased considerably in recent years. Worthy of mention is the Russian-French Palaeoecological and Palaeogeographic Programme (1997-2000) with the participation of IA RAS, Moscow State University and the University of Paris 4 conducted with GIS technology. Since 2001, this programme has been running under the direction of Ju.V Gorlov working both on the Taman' Peninsula (Gorlov 2007) and on the E Black Sea littoral (GR Garbuzov, GV. Trebeleva and A.A. Porotov). Considerable attention has been paid to studies of the dynamics of changes in the climate and the Black Sea shoreline, as well as the identifica tion and analysis of traces of the anc. land tenure, etc. In 1998, in order to attract greater attention to the German Russian investigations in N Maiotis, the Eurasia Abteilung of the DAI launched the bilingual publication series Pontus Septentrionalis in German and Russian. To date 3 volumes have been published. Patraeus A.P. Abramov has confined excavations at the town site which may be identified with anc. Patraeus (Paromov 1993; Abramov et al. 2005). In 1993, Ja.M. Paramov published an archaeolog ical topographic plan of the site (Paromov 1993a). V.N. Taskaev and A.G Vasil'ev are conducting annual investigations in the bay near Patraeus. Noteworthy are the remains of an extensive dam embankment and a number of submerged wells and rooms. The results of investigations carried out in 1949, 1961 and 1966 at the rural settlement Kucugury 2, dating to the 6th Ct BC-6th Ct AD, have been published (Bonin 2005). Kepoi Ja.M. Paromov has published an archaeological plan of the kurgan necropolis of Kepoi (Paromov 2003). Close to Kepoi a 6m h. barrow with several burials of the Hel period was excavated in 2002 by A.P. Medvedev and N.I. Sudarev. In 1983, reliefs depicting a battle scene were found N of Kepoi (Savostina 1999; 2001). Phanagoria In Phanagoria and its environs archaeological investigations, as well as remote and geophysical surveys, have continued unin terrupted, but in recent years the scale and intensity have increased considerably. Since 1993, the director of the Phanagoria Expedition has been V.D. Kuznecov. In 1993 a detailed topographical plan of Phanagoria with verified records of all the land plots investigated up to and including 1989 was published (Paromov 1993b). The results of the fieldwork of the late 1980s and the first half of the 90s have been published by</page><page sequence="35">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 149 A.A. Zavojkin (1998; 2004a). The main efforts have been concentrated in the Gorod, i.e. the city, in the area of the upper terrace. In 1995, the Royal Holloway, University of London (C. Morgan) joined the expedition and a publication project with 3 planned volumes was set up as a supplement to the excavation activities. In 2004, the first volume devoted to the Attic fineware pottery of the site was published (Morgan 2004). The most remarkable discoveries were made in 1999-2002 and 2004-2007 in the submerged area of the city. Here, the remains of a pier of the LCI period were revealed. Between the stone blocks used in its construction, a number of building fragments with fine architectural details, fragmentary sculptures and, most importantly, dedicatory building and grave inscriptions were found, along with pottery and coins. Special finds worthy of mention are: a marble stele of Hypsikrates; one of the wives of Mithridates VI Eupator; a dedicatory inscription for the cubicularius Julius Menestratos to the king of Bosporos, Sauromates II; a votive statue of Eros erected by King Aspourgos and dedicated to Aphrodite Ourania, the Lady of Apaturos (Fig. 25); a building inscription of 220 AD (Fig. 26) and a flagstone with a tamga, the family emblem of Sauromates II (Kuznecov 2005; 2006; 2007a; 2007b; 2007c).

Phanagoria: building inscription of AD 220 AD Excavations have continued at the necropolis of Phanagoria during the period under consideration. Several dozens of burials of the 4th and 3rd Ct BC have been excavated at the W necropolis under the direction of T. Savyrina. In 2005, excavations in the E necropolis were resumed under the direction of A.P. Medvedev. Here, at least the same number of graves of varying types and dated to the 5th-3rd Ct BC has been investigated. In 2003, a robbed but fairly well-preserved stone vault of the 4th Ct BC, with a stepped roof, was revealed in the S necropolis in the co-called Avenue of Kurgans. Near Phanagoria a lead plaque with a Gr inscription dated to the 3rd 2nd Ct BC was found accidentally (Saprykin and Maslennikov 2007b). It features a list of 7 male personal names, 5 Gr and 2 barbarian. For a number of years, investigations using geospatial information system (GIS) technologies have been conducted in the vicinity of Phanagoria with the aim of finding traces of the anc. land tenure and land demarcation (Garbuzov 2007). In addition, rescue excavations of kurgans of the 4th Ct BC-2nd Ct AD have been carried out along the route of railway construc tion, as well as excavation at the Cl settlement of Vinogradnoe 7, headed by I.I. Marcenko. Hermonassa (Taman') The site of anc. Hermonassa has been investigated by S.I. Finogenova and E.R. Ustaeva since 1988. During recent years excavations have been conducted in 4 main areas: the Nagorny j (mountainous), SE, N and NE areas. Strata dating from the present back to the 2nd quarter of the 6th Ct BC have been uncovered, and the limits of the city itself have been defined. Remains of a number of dwellings and possibly public and household buildings of various periods, as well as several streets, have been unearthed. In addition, a small extramural habitation block of the 4th-3rd Ct BC has been excavated. Due to the very thick cultural layers of up to 13m, it has so far only been possible to dig down to the bedrock in 3 of the areas. An inscribed grave stele was found in 2003 (Agafonov 2006). A cemetery of the EMed period was investigated on a limited scale by V.N. Ccheidze. Ja.M. Paromov (2002) has investi gated the dimensions and composition of the kurgan burial ground around the town and published a topographical map. Gorgippia (Anapa) The results of the studies of Gorgippia were brought together by E.M. Alekseeva (1997; 2002). During the last decade only small-scale excavations have been conducted, mostly as sporadic rescue investigations carried out by local archaeolo gists. Only in 2006 has a fairly large-scale excavation of 2,000 m2 taken place, which revealed part of the necropolis in the form of 7 burials of the 5th-E4th Ct BC in the centre of the town (A.A. Kolesnikov). The necropolis was covered by urban strata of the 2nd quarter of the 4th-1st third of the 3rd Ct BC, and later by strata dating to the lst-3rd Ct AD, with remains of several dwellings, household buildings, pits and pavements. A burnt stratum dated around 240 AD has been recorded, as well as a rich assemblage of pottery. The new inscriptions found here have been published (Smirnova 2002). The status of Gorgippia within the Bosporos Kingdom has been studied by A.A. Zavojkin (2002). Other Taman' sites In 1996-1997 small-scale excavations were continued at the settlement site near Il'ic, known for its finds from the Cl period (A.A. Zavojkin). Since 1995, rescue excavations of the Tuzla necropolis and underwater surveys near Cape Tuzla and Cape Panagija have been conducted almost without interruption</page><page sequence="36">150 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. under the direction of A.V Kondrasev (Kondrasev 2005; Tsetskhladze and Kondrashev 2001). Slightly W of Patraeus, at Beregovoe IV, excavations of a settlement and a cult complex have been carried out by N.I. Sudarev and A.A. Zavojkin respectively (Zavojkin and Sudarev 2005). It has been established that the settlement area in its earliest phase covered at least 45ha. Remains of mud-brick structures, household pits and a necropolis of the L6th-4th Ct BC have been unearthed. The cult complex, which has also yielded rich and remarkable finds such as terracottas, lamps and votive objects, probably served for the worship of the Eleusinian goddesses (Zavojkin 2004b). Small rescue excavations were conducted by Sudarev's team at the neighbouring site of Kamennaja Batarejka. In 1998 the Azov team of the Taman' Expedition (A.A. Zavojkin and N.I. Sudarev) carried out limited rescue excavations in the area of a cluster of settlements dated to different periods among which were the remains of a settlement of the L6th-lst half of the 4th Ct BC, Priazovskoe 4, situated near Cape Kamennyj of the Taman' Peninsula on the high shore of the Sea of Azov. In cooperation with the DAI (U. Schlotzhauer), in 2006 the State Historical Museum (D.V. Zuravlev) initiated excavations of a settlement at Golubickoe 2 and interdisciplinary surveys were conducted along the coast of the Achtanizovskij Liman, including the Boris-and-Gleb mud volcano. At Golubickoe magnetic surveys revealed the now partly excavated defensive ditch and rampart encircling the site to the E which were presumably constructed in the M5th Ct BC. The settlement itself was founded in the 2nd half of the 6th Ct BC, but was destroyed by a strong fire around the M3rd Ct BC. Finds from the fill of the ditch were fairly numerous and diverse, including bone objects, arrowheads, coins and fragmentary pottery with graffiti. After the fire, the settlement was reoccupied and continued until the turn of the 2nd and 1st Cts BC. Small-scale rescue excavations of burials were carried out by N.I. Sudarev in 2006-2008 near the townsite of Golubickoe situated further to the E along the Azov coast of the Taman' Peninsula. Since 2004, a team of the State Historical Museum headed by G A. Lomtadze has been conducting excavations of a stratified site NW of the mod. village of Achtanizovskaja (Achtanizovskaja 4). A detailed plan of the settlement and its surroundings has been produced. In one of the excavated areas, pottery of the oldest period of the site's occupation (1st half of the 6th Ct BC) was unearthed. Since 2006, the central fortified section of the site has been investigated, with remains of a strong defensive wall of the 2nd-1st Ct BC, dating to the period immediately before the destruction of the settlement. Numerous sites have been investigated, among which are BA kurgan burials near the mod. village of Volna. Among other finds unearthed in this area, remains of iron-smelting workshops are noteworthy. Since 1998, the Bugaz team of the Bosporos Expedition of the Institute of the History of Material Culture, headed by Ju.A. Vinogradov, has practically completed the excavation of the settlement of Artjuscenko 1, dated to the LAr and Cl periods (Vinogradov and Lebedeva 2005; 2007). Another team of the same expedition, under the direction of E.Ja. Rogov and later S.V. Kasaev, has excavated the settlement of Vysesteblievskaja 11, revealing remains from the Hel and Med periods, and the necropolis of Artuscenko 2, dated to the L6th-4th Ct BC. At Vysesteblievskaja 11, a series of Jewish grave stelae is noteworthy. At the necropolis, a number of well-preserved burials with grave goods of the Cl period stands out (Kashaev 2005). Semibratnee After a long interruption, excavations were renewed at this site in 2001 (VA. Goroncarovskij). Remains of a defensive wall of the 5th Ct BC and the area of a t?menos with an altar of the 3rd Ct BC were recovered (Goroncharovsky 2005). A team specialized in geophysical investigations and surveys, and directed by O.V Sarov in 2004 and S.Ju. Vnukov in 2007, joined the investigations. In 2006 and 2007, T.N. Smekalova conducted magnetic surveys of a considerable area in the SW part of the town site. This technique has identified the outlines of the defensive wall with towers, and the orthogonal layout of the residential quarters, as well as separately standing monumental stone buildings (Fig. 27) (Smekalova and Goroncarovskij 2006; Smekalova, Goroncarovskij and Djukov 2007). In 1994, a base fragment of a grey-ware cup with the stamp AFT in a circle was found on the surface, indicating that it functioned either as a ritual or a votive vessel (Novicichin 2006). 27. Semibratnee: aerial photo and magnetic map of the site Northern Caucasus Since 1998 the Gelendzik-Novorossijsk Expedition has been headed by A.A. Malysev, who conducts annual excavations at the Raevskoe settlement, one of the key fortresses on the River Kuban (Malysev 1995; 2000; Malyshev 2007). From 2000 2007 archaeological investigations of the defences of Raevskoe were conducted. A survey in the valley of the River Bedricka, S of Raevskoe, revealed a system of settlements. In addition, investigations of the Krasnobatarejnoe and Borisenkov Liman settlements were initiated. Magnetic surveys at Raevskoe and Krasnobatarejnoe by T.N. Smekalova revealed the defensive walls and a tower with traces of a strong fire (Aleksandrovskij et al. 1999). In collaboration with A.V Dmitriev, A.A. Malysev has conducted surveys and excavations</page><page sequence="37">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 151 of the necorpoleis of various periods in the Cemesskaja Valley and surroundings of Novorossijsk, including the long-lived site and necropolis of Myschako (jointly with A.N. Gej and E.I. Savcenko, 1990-1991, 2000). Myschako is the largest of the Gr-period sites in the area between Anapa and Gelendzik. An expedition of the Novorossijsk Museum (A.V Sislov) has conducted rescue excavations of a Cl and Byz flat grave necropolis near the village of Juznaja Ozerejka. In 2008, surveys and small-scale rescue excavations were carried out by a team of the East Bosporos Expedition at a number of Gr period sites in the region of Gelendzik (N.I. Sudarev and O.D. Cevelev). GEORGIA (Fig. 28) In the first years of the period under discussion, Georgia suffered from civil war and, consequently, shortage of fuel, food and other basic necessities. This affected the archaeolog ical community, so that almost no major excavations or publi cations could be undertaken. The main institution conducting archaeological fieldwork is the Otar Lordkipanidze Centre for Archaeological Research of the Georgian Academy of Sciences, which carries out work in several counties. The Georgian National Museum is the head of a network of museums, which take care of the cultural heritage of Georgia. The current director is D. Lordkipanidze, the former excavator at Dmanissi. Teaching of Cl subjects is the responsibility of Tbilisi State University's Department of Classical Studies, with Prof. R. Gordesiani as its Director. See the institute's homepage (www.greekstudies.caucasus.net) for further information. In general, archaeological fieldwork has followed the lines given in the previous report (Kacharava 1990-1991). Most of the local archaeologists have continued their projects until now. The later 1990s saw several collaborations between Western and Georgian researchers. A notable example is the Pichvnari Project, led by A. Kakhidze (Batumi) in collaboration with M. Vickers (Oxford). The German universities of Halle and T?bingen have conducted excavations at EIA sites in E Georgia (Furtw?ngler and Knau? 1997; Furtw?ngler, Knau? and Motzenb?cker 1998 for Ciskaraant Gora and others; Korfrnann et al. 1999; 2004 for Naomari Gora). From 1998 onwards, new local publications have appeared, mostly written in Georgian, but regularly furnished with short summaries in Western languages. The construction of the Baku-Tbilisi-Ceyhan oil pipeline in 2002-2005 made a series of rescue excavations necessary along its route. The pipeline project offered a substantial amount of money to Georgian archaeology. This and the improved economic situation led to a much needed reconstruction of archaeological museums and sites. An important attempt to write a general survey of the Gr and Rom history of Georgia was made by D. Braund in 1994 (Braund 1994). New periodicals Since 1999, Dziebani - Journal of the Centre for Archaeological Studies has been issued roughly twice a year. This journal, with supplementary volumes, provides the quickest and most complete insight into Georgian archaeolog ical projects and fieldwork. Thus, it has replaced the series PAI (Polevye Archaeologiceskie Issledovanija) from the 1970s and 1980s, covering all PH, antique and Med periods. The articles are written in Georgian, but due to figures and summaries in international languages, Dziebani is a most important working tool. Since 2004, and published completely in English, the Journal of Georgian Archaeology is a supplement to Dziebani. Since 1999, the Department of Classical Studies of the Tbilisi State University has published the international journal PHASIS, accompanied by the journal LOGOS since 2003. In 2000, the Batumi Museum, Batumi being Georgia's most important Black Sea port, released its own series of reports, Batumi Archaeological Museum. The Works. The articles are written in Georgian, with English or Russian summaries. kEshera Black Sea Poti iVani Kobuleti/ Batumi i Gonio i fcPichvn?r ?mbati Izkh?ta V #^ TbilisiXom?i U?ra 28.

Eshera From 2003-2006, excavations at the settlement of Eshera N of Suchumi were carried out by the expeditions of the Abkhazian Institute for Humanities Research (Suchumi) and the State Museum of Oriental Art (Moscow) (Erlich et al. in print). A layer of construction debris dating to the 1st quarter of the 6th Ct BC was found. The pottery contained a number of E Gr vessels including some in Wild Goat Style. Nearby, a L Kolchian necropolis dating from the end of the 5 -1st half of the 4th Ct BC was investigated. Constructions from the Hel period in the E part of the fortified site have been examined. An indigenous settlement on the nearby Verescagin hill was also investigated. Both sites were destroyed by fire in the 1st Ct BC and ceased to exist. Remains of a rich warrior burial dated to the Ar period were discovered SE of Eshera by Kutyscha in 2005. The assemblage contained a very interesting cuirass consisting of a breast-piece made from a hammered bronze sheet and 3,000 oval bronze scales, each with 2 holes. This is the first find of its kind in the region. Together with the cuirass, an iron axe, an akinaks dagger and arrowheads of iron were found. Fragments of 2 E Gr rosette bowls were found in the tomb, suggesting a date in the 1st half of the 6th Ct BC (V.R. Erlich et al. http://www. arcaucasica.ni/index.php3?path=_english/publication_report&amp; source=erlikh_elite_assemblages). Phasis The Gr colony of Phasis was founded probably towards the end of the 7th Ct BC by Milesian colonists. Several missions have tried to find remains of the city, but have failed due to the very complicated maritime and alluvial conditions in the coastal wetland of mod. Poti and the mouth of the River Rioni. The best suggestion for the city's location is still the bank of Lake Paliastomi or somewhere underneath its waters, where ruins of the L antique period have been found, as already reported by D. Kacharava (1990-1991, 79). Pichvnari Excavation in the necropolis of Pichvnari, foremost dated to the 5th-4th Ct BC, has been continued as a joint venture between the Batumi Archaeological Museum and the Ashmolean Museum, University of Oxford. A bilingual publication was issued in 2004 (Vickers and Kakhidze 2004). Following the traditional interpretation, 2 geographically separated parts of the necropolis have been identified as different burial areas for a Kolchian and a Gr community at the site. As the differences between the grave goods are not very strict and the internal structure of the large settlement itself remains practically unknown, this interpretation has met with some criticism. Nevertheless, the documentation of 300 burials from the Cl, Hel and LRom periods offers the best material for social studies so far available in the region. The most recent additional volume to the one cited above refers to the results of 20 years of excavation prior to 1987 (Kakhidze 2007). Unfortunately the text is mostly written in Georgian. Apsaros (Gonio) In a joint Georgian and German project (University of Jena) the Rom fortress of Gonio near Batumi, Apsaros in Cl and Byz times, has been explored and excavated (Plontke-L?ning 2005, 133). The most important outcome of the project is the accurate mapping of the fortress and its surroundings. The site was settled from the 8^-7* Ct BC until Ot times, but certainly had its heyday from the Neronian period onwards, when the castrum was built as part of the E Rom defence system. To date, the main publications of the recent fieldwork are those by A. Geyer and S. Mamuladze (2002); and A. Plontke-L?ning (2005). Vani During the period under report, excavation was carried on at the major Kolchian site of Vani. Several exceptional richly furnished burials excavated earlier witness the administrational and probably religious importance of the site from the 5th Ct BC onwards. In 2004, another spectacular burial, grave 24, was discovered in the settlement of Vani (Kacharava and Kvirkvelia 2008, 175) (Fig. 29). It can be dated to the later 4th Ct BC by a Pantikapaian coin providing a tpq after 330. According to the position of the grave goods and skeletal remains, 5 individuals and a horse can be distinguished. An enormously richly equipped 'lord' was followed by 4 'servants' into the grave. He was clad in a garment adorned with gold appliqu?s and innumerable glass beads. Additionally, he wore a large collection of granulated golden jewellery and bracelets in the Persian style. A silver belt decorated with a symposium scene and an iron spearhead lay near the corpse, as well as a collection of silver, bronze and Gr clay vessels designed for aristocratic banqueting. A Neo-Babylonian seal is a particu larly remarkable object that witnesses the connection of the deceased to the Achaemenid imperial administration. Governmental practices of the Persian Empire were certainly imitated in Kolchis. The precious new finds underline the position of Vani as an independent indigenous centre with strong contacts to the Greeks and even more so with the Persian world. It is important to note that Vani was neither a Gr colony nor part of the Persian Empire. The prosperous period of the 4th Ct BC just predates the transformation of the, until then, wooden settlement into a sanctuary site with impressive stone architecture. 29. Vani: the rich grave 24 dated to the later 4th Ct BC discovered in the settlement in 2004 Atskuri Under the direction of V Licheli, excavations have continued in the complicated site of Atskuri in S Georgia (Licheli 2007, 55). Only graves dating to the 7th-E6th Ct BC and the 4th and 3th Cts have been observed so far. Architectural remains are restricted to the period of the 6^-4* Ct, which corresponds roughly to the Achaemenid period, and occur again in later Hel and Rom times. Most remarkable are a number of grave goods that copy prestigious Persian items in cheaper materials, such as clay copies of an Achaemenid phiale and an ovoid flask originally designed in precious metal, as well as several locally made seal stones with indigenous motives. Obviously, the inhabitants of the upper Kura Valley, which sits at a major connection route between the Black Sea and the Persian province in E Transcaucasia, attempted to use Persian symbols and customs</page><page sequence="39">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 153 at the lowest imaginable level. Nevertheless, they had access to a little Gr bf and bg pottery as well, brought in from the Kolchian coast. Mzkheta In 2001, the remarkable grave of an elderly woman in her 50s was discovered under the foundations of the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mzkheta, the anc. capital of E Georgia. By her signet ring bearing a portrait, title and name she has been identified as a queen. Bestowed in the grave with her were golden jewellery, cosmetic vessels made of jade and a unique, large silver-gilt pencil case. On its front it shows the 9 Muses in high relief and on its back Homer, Menander and Demosthenes decorate a balcony-like pocket in which the golden ink pot was inserted. The flat body of the case, with silver quill pens inside, can be closed by a golden lid with an inscription worked ? jour. The inscription informs us that the object belonged to the kings Ustamos and Eugenios who are otherwise unattested. The burial can be dated roughly to the 3rd-4th Ct AD, even if some objects are certainly older. Unfortunately the grave has not entered international publication yet. Preliminary information is available at www. magticom.ge/magazine/2002-4/2002-4-7.html. Gumbati In 1996, a team from the University of Halle excavated a unique 40m x 40m mud-brick building at Gumbati near Gurjaani in E Georgia. Its characteristic plan and fragments of at least 5 bell-shaped column bases suggest a genuine Achaemenid residence probably built for a minor local governor (Fig. 30). According to the architectural style and the dating of the pottery finds, the small palace was probably constructed at the end of the 5th or the beginning of the 4th Ct BC. Similar and even much larger structures have been discovered at Sari Tepe and Qaradjamirli in Azerbaijan, as well as at Benjamin in Armenia (Knauss 2006, 104). Together with the Achaemenid palaces at Eribouni (Erevan) and Argishtichinili (Artvin), they form the administrative network of the 13th Persian district mentioned by Herodotos (3.93). TURKEY N Turkey still remains one of the least explored parts of the Black Sea area. However, while very few investigations were carried out throughout much of the 20th Ct, things have begun to change over the past 15 years when a number of excavation and survey projects have been initiated. In addition to the coastal cities, a number of inland sites have been included in this report since the area in the Hel and Rom periods clearly formed part of the same political entity. Three important monographs on the Pontic Kingdom and Mithridates VI in particular have appeared (Ballesteros-Pastor 1996; Saprykin 1996d; Erciyas 2006). The first 2 mainly treat the literary sources, while the latter incorporates archaeological material and recent survey results. The bibliography by O. Tekin (1993) includes previous numismatic studies in N Turkey. F. de Callatay's (1997) study of the coinage of Mithridates VI has revealed a clear correlation between the frequency of issues and military activities during the Mithridatic Wars. Callatay (2005) has also made important contributions to the study of the bronze municipal coins of the Pontic cities, adding new types to Imhoof-Blumer's classifica tion and proposing a new dating scheme. Coins of the Gr cities are included in the publications of the British Museum (Price 1993) and the Stancomb Collection (Stancomb 2000), while the Rom coin types appear in the ongoing Roman Provincial Coinage project (online database: http://rpc.ashmus.ox.ac.uk/). A fine, well-illustrated introduction to Rom rule in the provinces of Pontus and Bithynia is offered by C. Marek (2003), who has also made an in-depth study of the cities and their territories (1993). The Bithynian Kingdom is treated by Gabelko (2005). Trapezous (Trabzon) Salvage excavation in the city has revealed architectural elements dated to the 2nd-4th Ct AD: bases, architraves, friezes and a Corinthian capital (Kaya 1999). The most interesting find is an over life-size Hel bronze statue of a young male, identified by the excavator as Hermes. FSK _-.-?-" ~ ^^. ?^-^| 30. Gumbati: reconstruction of the Persian palace</page><page sequence="40">154 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. The area E of Trabzon has been surveyed to record the surviving structural evidence for the Rom and EByz military presence in the area (Crow and Bryer 1997). It was established that the most likely site of Hyssos Limen, visited by Arr?anos, was at Arakh Kalesi. Komana Pontike In 2004, investigations under the direction of D. Burcu Erciyas were begun around the supposed site of Komana Pontike, located at Hamamtepe 9km NE of Tokat. The visible remains on the hill have been mapped, and a geophysical survey has been conducted to determine the extent of buildings not visible on the surface. Surface finds are Byz or later, but investigations of a looter's trench also yielded Rom material. In the vicinity of the hill, Rom necropoleis were identified and a hexagonal pool also dating to the Rom period. The area is also rich in Byz remains; among these 2 basilicas (Erciyas, S?kmen and Kalayci 2007; www.komana.org). A corpus of the Rom coins of Komana has been prepared by M. Amandry and B. R?my (1999). Amaseia (Amasya) Throughout the 1990s, D. French has considered different epigraphical aspects related to Amaseia in his 'Amasian Notes'. Of particular interest is no. 5 (French 1996) concerning the t?menos of Zeus Stratios at Yassi?al. The site was first described by Cumont in 1901, but French offers the first sketch drawing with the location of the 32 inscriptions, mentioning regions and villages, which, according to French, belonged to the territory of Amaseia exclusively. The site has a perimeter wall of 150m di. with an entrance to the NE. In the centre is what appears to be a large 40m x 40m podium that probably held a monumental altar similar to the one seen on the coins of Amaseia. No finds prior to the Rom period were found at the site. At several places around the city, the museum has undertaken rescue excavations of the Rom necropoleis. The most common type is the vaulted chamber tomb, sometimes with frescos, but cist graves occur as well. The associated finds date to the 2nd-4th Ct AD (Eski ?amlar: Y?ce 1995; Uygur: Y?ce and ?zdemir 2000; Kur?unlu: Doganba? 2002). From 2002, R. Fleischer has led a small team investigating the royal tombs above the city. Elevations, plans and sections have been made, and, based on the cuttings in the rock, it has been possible to establish the original appearance of the tombs (Fig. 31). The 5 tombs numbered A-E from right to left had: 31. Amaseia: reconstruction of the earliest of the royal tombs (A) a hexastyle portico with pediment; (B and D) tetrastyle porticos with pediments; (C) a portico without columns and rounded top; and (E) a portico without columns and archivolt at the top. The chronological sequence of the tombs seems to be A, C, B, D and E. Somewhat surprisingly, the architectural development seem to move from a purely Gr style in the 3rd Ct BC to a more local style in the 2nd Ct, when the Pontic Kingdom became increasingly Hellenized (Fleischer forthcoming). Fleischer (2005) has furthermore managed to solve finally the puzzle of the inscriptions on the Mirror Tomb (Aynah Magara) outside Amasya. The 2 inscriptions, the original above the entrance and the one from later use of the tomb below, read: Tr)? | apxHl?P??s and kcci 'Hy?Oeos | Me[v]?v5pou. S. Ireland (2000) has published the extensive collection of coins from the museum in Amasya, which was reopened in 2006 after renovation. Euchaita (Bey?z?) In 2007, a survey project around anc. Euchaita was initiated under the direction of J. Haldon and H. Elton. During the first season a number of spolia, including inscriptions, were recorded in the city, and survey in the vicinity revealed scatters of pottery from the PH to the LRom period. Amisos (Samsun) A history of Amisos, in Turkish with a summary in English, covering also recent archaeological work, was published by S. Atasoy (1997). On the acropolis of Karasamsun, trenches were opened within the military base in the 1990s, revealing further mosaics and pottery from the LCI to LRom period. Undoubtedly the most spectacular find in Amisos is that of a rich undisturbed tomb discovered during road construction in 1995 (Erciyas 2006, 67-115). The tomb chamber, measuring 5m x 5m, was cut into the limestone and had 5 rectangular graves cut into the bedrock along 3 walls. Access to the chamber was through a hole on the E side of the roof, where a retaining wall with a door marked the entrance (Fig. 32). Remains of only 3 skeletons were found, probably interred in wooden chests. The grave goods, datable to the E3rd Ct BC, comprised alabastra, a glass bowl and phiale, an inkwell type lamp and incense burners, but, most remarkable, is the extraor dinarily fine gold jewellery, including a wreath, necklaces, earrings with figures of Eros and Nike, several bracelets and cloth appliqu?s (Fig. 33). Although few have turned up in controlled excavations, Amisos evidently had a large production of terracottas in the Hel period, as shown by the study of L. Summerer (1999). Dionysiac themes and theatrical masks are clearly among the most favoured motifs. This may reflect the use of Dionysos in the propaganda of Mithridates VI, who took the epithet 'Neos Dionysos'. Several extensive surveys and site visits have been carried out in the central Black Sea region around Samsun (briefly presented in Belli 2001 with bibliographies), but the projects focus primarily on the PH period and only offer sporadic comments on the Gr and Rom material. tkiztepe At tkiztepe near Bafra, a tumulus with a dromos and 2 chambers, dated to the 1st half of the 3rd Ct BC, has been excavated. The tomb had been robbed, but a Lysimachean posthumous Alexander gold stater and Hel pottery were recovered. The excavation also revealed LIA pottery similar to that found at Akalan (Bilgi 1999, 27-54).</page><page sequence="41">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE BLACK SEA REGION 1993-2007 155 H J J il ? ? ? 32. Amisos: tomb found in 1995 Sinope (Sinop) In the vicinity of Sinop, several amphora workshops have been excavated. On Boztepe between 1993 and 1997, Y Garlan and the director of the museum, ?. Tathcan, excavated 2 kiln sites at Zeytinlik, recovering hundreds of stamps all belonging to the E3rd Ct BC. In 1996, another kiln, with material of the L3rd and E2nd Ct BC, was revealed at Nisik?y, 3km from the city (Garlan and Tathcan 1998). Following a geophysical survey, excavations at Demirci 14km S of Sinop were conducted from 1994-1997 (Kassab-Tezg?r 1996; Kassab-Tezg?r and Tathcan 1998) and again in 2000 (Kassab-Tezg?r and Dereli 2001), revealing several kilns. Apart from a small workshop active in the later 4th Ct BC, the workshops functioned from the 3rd Ct AD and possibly into the 6th. Rescue excavation in the city has uncovered LRom polychrome mosaics, one of which had a diamond-shaped panel with a female bust labelled TPYOH (http://www.cca.unimelb.edu.au/community/Events/PAPHLA GONIA-PONTUS-abstracts.pdf). In 1996 the Sinop Regional Archaeological Project was initiated under the leadership of O. Doonan (2004). Extensive survey and investigations at Sinop itself were made, and from 1997-1999 intensive survey was carried out in the Demirci Valley, the Karasu Valley and on Boztepe. More than 170 sites dating from the Neo to the Ot period were recorded. The settlement pattern shows a contraction of sites in the coastal area in the IA and Cl period, while the Hel period and particu larly the Rom period are characterized by extensive use of the agricultural lands in the valleys for the cultivation, presumably, of olives. The inscriptions from Sinope have been published by D. French (2004). The most important new addition is a stele with a nearly complete 3 3-line inscription of a treaty between Sinope and the tyrant family of Herakleia, dated 353/352 346/345 BC. Stamped amphorae from Sinope have received considerable interest from scholars, most notably Y. Garlan (2004), N. Conovici (1998) and N. Fedoseev (1999), who propose a novel dating scheme. After several years of renovation, the local museum reopened in 2006. At ?iftlik, 10km S of Sinop, an EByz (4th-5th Ct AD), 3 aisled basilica with geometric mosaics, in danger of being washed away by the sea, was surveyed, excavated, protected and studied from 1993-2000 (Hill 1998). Pompeiopolis (Ta?k?pr?) In 2006, investigations at Pompeiopolis were initiated under the direction of L. Summerer. A topographical map of the plateau of Zimbilh Tepe, NW of the mod. city, was produced, showing that the city extended much further than the LRom fortress. Geomagnetic survey has identified the forum, measuring 80m x 100m with porticos surrounding it. Next to the forum is a building with 2 building phases, possibly a gymnasium and an odeion. To the W, excavations revealed part of a bath with hypocaust and, to the E, part of a villa with mosaics dating to the L4th-E5th Ct AD. Although plenty of stray finds testify to activity in the 1st and 2nd Cts AD, the stratified structures excavated all belong to the L antique period. Three new honorary inscriptions have been found, one for Gn. Claudius Severus, the son-in-law of Marcus Aurelius, and another honouring a member of the Severan dynasty. The last, on a pillar monument inscribed on at least 3 sides, honours a Paphlagoniarch, an office previously unattested. The inscrip tions on the sides seem to be an account of expenditures in connection with a festival (http://www.klass-archaeologie. lmu.de/Pompeiopolis/pom_index_de.html). Hadrianopolis (Eskipazar) Between 1997 and 2001, R. Matthews led extensive and intensive surveys in the ?ankin and Karabuk provinces, with the aim of establishing the long-term settlement patterns. Project Paphlagonia identified about 300 sites, many of them with Gr and Rom material. Particularly, the Rom period had a widespread settlement pattern across the entire landscape, and a clear hierarchy of sites, ranging from small hamlets to large towns such as Hadrianopolis and Antoninopolis, which has been located at Kizillar (Matthews, Pollard and Ramage 1998). At Hadrianopolis an EByz basilica (B), with 6l Ct AD mosaics showing personifications of 4 biblical rivers, was excavated by the museum in 2003. Since 2005, excavations led by E. Lafli have revealed a large LRom bath building and a basilica (A) with well-preserved 6th Ct AD geometric mosaics with depictions of animals in square frames. Two inscriptions give the name of the dedicator. At Kimistene, now identified through inscriptions, 10km to the NE of Hadrianopolis, monuments were recorded. Trenches from illegal excavations around the podium of the Rom temple have revealed Phrygian Grey Ware pottery (http://web.deu. edu.tr/paphlagonia/index.html). 33. Amisos: gold bracelet found in the tomb</page><page sequence="42">156 PIA GULDAGER BILDE ET AL. Tieion In 2006 and 2007, S. Atasoy conducted excavations in the city centre, the necropolis, the theatre and on the acropolis, and surface and geomagnetic surveys have also been carried out. Sherds of black and red figured ceramics were recovered on the acropolis, and in the city centre 2 Rom baths and 3 paved streets were uncovered. Amastris (Amasra) Investigations in Amasra, initiated in the late 1980s, were continued. The Hel foundations of the city wall, consisting of courses of squared blocks of limestone, were identified in several places. Rescue excavation was carried out in a large Rom bath and 2 pools with associated hypocausts were found. In the W harbour 2 sets of quays at different levels were identified, indicating a sea level rise of ca. lm between the Cl and the LByz period. As the Byz quays are at the mod. level, there seem to have been little change since then. Also, an outlet for a water channel was exposed, possibly the one described by Pliny the Younger (Hill 1994). In 1993, 4 marble statues, one of them a cuirassed imperial statue, possibly Hadrian (Fig. 34), the others of local dignitaries, were found during construction work. Herakleia (Eregli) No excavations have been carried out at Herakleia, but 2 monographs on the city have appeared: S. Saprykin (1997), an English translation and adaptation of his book in Russian from 1986; and A. Bittner (1998), which also features a German translation of Memnon and an appendix of the pre-Rom coin types. Furthermore, the anc. remains, predominantly architec tural fragments and stelae, have been catalogued by T. Akkaya (1994). The inscriptions of Herakleia have been published by L. Jonnes (1994), with a prosopography by W Ameling. Surprisingly, no inscriptions seem to have survived prior to the Rom period. The stamped amphorae from Herakleia have been studied by Kac (2003; 2007), who offers a revised chronology. ?i ?&lt;k I N, &gt;v; k.&gt;. i A* 34.
