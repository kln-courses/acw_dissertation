<plain_text><page sequence="1">Tropical rainforests by C C Park London and New York: Routledge, 1992, 188 pp, ?35.00 hardback ISBN 0 415 06238 1 This book provides a concise overview on the ecology, structure and present status of the world's tropical rainforests. The author declares his aims as including an examination of ' why the rainforest is so important, why it is being cleared, what the consequences of this clearance are and what solutions are available '. The book is clearly aimed at undergraduate geography students (although this is not explicitly stated). Students of subjects such as applied biology might find also a good deal of value in its pages. However it is too narrow in its focus to be used as a text-book for most courses in biogeography, yet insufficiently detailed for the real specialist. The book is clearly structured. Chapter one provides a convenient summary on the appearance, structure, classification, distribution and other characteristics of the world's rainforests. This is followed by good chapters on rates of loss (the difficulties of measurement being well discussed) and the causes and processes of clearance. Chapter 4 examines the impacts of this destruction, and chapter 5 includes a number of case studies on forest peoples. Chapter 6 offers a number of possible solutions: protection and conservation, sustainable management, controls on the tropical timber trade and ' debt-for-nature-swaps ' are all mentioned. There are numerous sub-headings, many excellent photos and useful sketch-maps and diagrams. There is an index and good bibliography. The treatment is balanced, neither emotionally ' greenie ' in its posture nor aggressively pro-development. There are, however, a number of small defects. Anthropomorphism occasionally creeps in: trees' soar skyward in search of light '; species ' cope ' with forest conditions. Figure 1.2 mixes non-metric units ('F) with metric (annual precipitation in mm). We read that' Ninety per cent</page><page sequence="2">100 Book reviews of the soils in the Amazon Basin are deficient in nitrogen and phosphorus '. Deficient for what? Not evidently for the diversity of plants that grow there. There are errors: the insect species diversity of the forests is illustrated by comparing that of 1 hectare of Peruvian rainforest with that for ' the whole of Great Britain ': the latter is given as 1430. There are in fact probably nearer 20 times that number. We are told that there are ' disparities between the theoretical and actual distributions of rainforest'. Just how the ' theoretical ' distribution is determined is unclear. There are occasional contradictions. On page 10, the complexity of the rainforests is explained as being due to the fact that ' the main wet tropical regions of the earth have been stable for at least the last 40 million years '. On page 29 the high species diversity is attributed to ' disruptions caused by floods, droughts, natural forest fires and even tectonic activity ' and human interference. There may well be merit in both arguments, but some effort should be made to compare and/or reconcile the ideas. It would be tiresome to continue. Individually each point is trivial but their cumulative effect is annoying. Many biogeography and environmental science students will get a good deal from this book: but they should be cautioned to use it carefully. It is so horrendously expensive that few will be able to afford to purchase copies. Patrick Armstrong University of Western Australia</page></plain_text>
