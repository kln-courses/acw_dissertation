JELLICOE, edd., A ClassifiedBiblio- graphy of the Septuagint, Arbeiten gur Literatur und Geschichte des Hel- lenistischen Judentums VI (E. J. Brill: Leiden, 1973) F1.56,- The appearance of a bibliography is a blessing to scholarship, especially when it is the first one of its kind.1) Henceforth scholars will be able to trace more studies in the areas covered by the bibliography than they could beforehand. These will undoubtedly enrich their knowledge, and they will make subsequent research richer. While this "praise" of bibliographies ap- plies to all areas of O.T. research, or, for that matter, to any research, it refers even more to textual criticism and linguistics. For in these fields all descriptions and discussions depend upon specific knowledge of phenom- ena, MSS and other textual witnesses which cannot be gathered by one scholar, even in a very limited area of research. Therefore, because the textual scholar and the linguist are in need of much technical data, they depend more on bibliographical knowledge than scholars specializing in other areas. LXX research can now proceed in a better way since the majority of studies relevant to the LXX which have been published between 1860 and 1970 are listed and classified in the recently published Classified Bibliography (Cl. Bibl.). Its editors, S. P. BROCK, C. T. FRITSCH and the late S. JELLICOE have placed scholars in great debt by publishing this bibliography which will be of much use to both LXX specialists and scholars dealing with such areas as O.T. exegesis and textual criticism, N.T. exegesis and textual criticism, Patristics, Greek linguistics and Jewish Hellenism. Its preparation must have been a major undertaking which will be appreciated by everyone using its lists of studies covering 201 pages. A cursory reading will also give the reader a good impression of the scope of studies relevant to the LXX. The entries in the Cl. Bibl. are well presented and clearly printed. There is, however, no consistency in such matters as punctuation, capitalization, method of quotation and annotation. The entries are divided into 41 sec- tions which include, among other things: Concordances, editions, survey articles, canon, characteristics and background, particular concepts, lan- guage, translation technique, transliterations, Pseudo-Aristeas, proto-LXX, LXX and MT, LXX and NT, Qumran, Peshitta, Targum, Philo and Jose- phus; Patristica, MSS, textual studies, Hexapla, other Greek translations, individual books [of the LXX] and the versions [of the LXX]. The headings of some of the sections are very specialized, making the Cl. Bibl. especially useful, e.g., anthropomorphism/-pathism (? 13), proper names (? 18), WUTz's theory (? 20), Coptic versions (? 40c), subdivided into: general, selections, Pentateuch, Historical books, Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Wisdom-Ecclesiasticus, Prophetic books. Vetus Testamentum, Vol. XXV, Fac. 4</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS Studies referring to more than one aspect of LXX research are generally listed in one place, while cross-references are added in the relevant other sections. These cross-references are, however, inefficient when they refer to very large sections such as ? 39 (45 pp.) and ? 40 (51 pp.), or when they refer to several sections at a time. Thus, in order to locate studies on Ez. in addition to the ones mentioned in ? 39n (Ez.), one has, in fact, to read a great part of the Cl. Bibl. Moreover, at the beginning of this search one does not know whether such entries will be found at all because there are no cross-references in subsection ? 39n. The cross-references of this sub- section, if any, are incorporated in the ones referring to the whole of ? 39 (45 pp.) and cannot be detached from them.2) The reader will further note that there are hardly any cross-references in ? 40 (versions). Even the LXX specialist will realize that the Cl. Bibl. includes areas of research to which he had not given much attention previously. Thus the "reading" of a bibliography can be an enriching experience. Some of the lesser known areas are: Onomastica (? 18b), inscriptions, amulets (? 35d) and illustrations of the LXX (? 41). A bibliography as extensive as the one under review is bound to contain mistakes and omit relevant information and cross-references. Similarly doubts may be cast on the validity of its classification in certain sections. Since many scholars will make use of the Cl. Bibl., a few criticisms may be in order: Not all scholars will agree with the classification of the Cl. Bibl. because everyone involved in LXX research has his own ideas on the nature and scope of specific areas in this field. Thus we believe that the CI. Bibl. would have been more helpful if in certain instances sections were subdivided, in others combined and in still others expanded. These matters are partly technicalities, but very often our remarks relate to the approach behind the classification. Often an unsatisfactory classification may be the result of the research itself where some of the areas under discussion are not clearly defined. 1. The contents of sections 11-19 are as following: 11. Characteristics and background; 12. Particular concepts; 13. Anthropomorphism/-pathism; 14. Hellenistic exegesis; 15. Language, a. General, b (i) Grammars, (ii) Grammatical studies, c (i) Lexica, (ii) Lexical studies; 16. Translation tech- nique; 17. Divine names; 18, a. Proper names, b. Onomastica; 19. Trans- literations. The boundaries between these individual sections are not al- ways clearly demarcated. Thus there is an overlap between sections 12 (particular concepts) and 15c (ii) (lexical studies). E.g., studies on doxa and psyche are mentioned in both sections. Further, section 12 contains studies of words which are not at all "concepts" and reversely ? 15c (ii) lists studies of words which may easily be defined as "concepts". But, the distinction between LXX words and concepts is actually misleading, as has been shown by J. BARR,3) and the two sections should therefore probably be merged into one section of lexical studies. Not all scholars agree on the nature of such studies, but, for one thing, the dividing line between the different approaches is not necessarily that suggested by ? 12 and 15c (ii) of the Cl. Bibl. It is not clear what is implied by "translation technique", the heading of 804</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS ? 16. This section contains studies on a whole range of topics such as the language of the translation (as in ? 15b (ii)) lexical studies (as in ? 15c (ii)), the equivalence of Hebrew and Greek words, Concordance studies, mul- tiple authorship of LXX books, etc. Indeed, the nature and scope of trans- lation technique needs to be defined better in scholarship. The now separate section on anthropomorphism/-pathism (? 13) should probably have been a subdivision of either the present section on trans- lation technique or of a section on tendentious or theological exegesis (not found in the Cl. Bibl.). The section on Divine names (? 17) is a mixed col- lection of lexical and text-critical studies. This section is very heterogeneous, as are the sections on proper names (? 18a) and transliterations (? 19). In these four instances the general principles of the classification are abandoned since paragraphs which are in the nature of subsections are made into independent sections. According to its name, ? 19 (transliterations) could have been appropriate in its present place-possibly rather as a subsection of "translation technique"-, but it lists mainly studies dealing with Hebrew phonology. Its topic is thus close to section 37c which lists mainly grammatical studies on the transliterations found in the Hexapla's second column. The main criterion for including lexica in ? 15c (i) must have been their relevance to LXX lexicology. Thus several modern lexica are mentioned, together with CASTELL'S Lexicon Heptaglotton (1669), but earlier lexica are omitted. Two of these are listed in the section on Onomastica, ? 18b (why?), viz. the Octateuch-lexicon published by BENEDIKTSSON and DRACHMANN'S study on Cyrill. A selection of other lexica could have been added, certainly Hesychius' lexicon, useful for LXX studies (especially in K. LATTE'S edi- tion). 2. A second segment which lacks clarity and omits some relevant infor- mation is found in sections 36-38: 36. Textual studies, a. General, b. Cor- ruptions, c. Recensions (general), d. Hebraising recensions (other than Hexaplaric), e. Hexaplaric recension, f Lucianic recension, g. Hesychian recension; 37. Hexapla, a. General, b. Hexapla and Tetrapla, c. Second Column; 38. Other Greek translations, a. General, b. Aquila, c. Theodotion, d. Symmachus, e. Quinta, f. Samaritikon, g. Syros, h. Other translations, i. Medieval Greek, j. Graecus Venetus. First of all, the nature of ? 36 (textual studies) is not completely clear. What is meant is probably "inner- Greek studies". However, some of the studies mentioned deal exclusively with the relationship between the LXX and MT (? 36a, b) to which ? 24 is devoted as well. Secondly, the recensions of the LXX should have been treated in a se- parate section, and not as part of the section on textual studies (? 36). The information provided on these recensions is rather unsatisfactory. E.g., the section dealing with the revisions in general (? 36c) could have been much expanded. The Hexaplaric, Lucianic and Hesychian recensions are listed as part of ? 36 and in addition there is a separate section (? 37) on the Hexapla. Furthermore, the other revisions, Aquila, Symmachus and Theodotion, are listed in yet another section, viz. "Other Greek translations" (? 38). It seems to us that the section on Lucian (? 36f) needs to be expanded as well 5I 805</page><page sequence="4">REVIEWS as the section on "Hebraising recensions (other than Hexaplaric)" (? 36d). Moreover, in the latter section the reader needs some guidance which will not necessarily derive from the titles of the studies but from an analysis of their contents. In particular, some information is needed about the names of several recensions which have been discovered by modern scholarship, and about the studies in which these recensions are discussed. Thus one expects here, e.g., D. W. GOODING'S Recensions of the Septuagint Pentateuch which, because of its name, occurs now in ? 36c. Furthermore, the reader looking for studies on the so-called kaige revision will search in vain. The name kaige is not mentioned in any of the headings of a subsection in ? 36- 38, not even in an explanatory note to the section on Theodotion (? 38c). For one thing, BARTHTLEMY'S Les Devanciers d'Aquila, mentioned in ? 36d (Hebraising recensions), has no cross-reference to either Aquila or Theodo- tion. 3. Now a few remarks on sections 25-33 dealing mainly with areas "around" the LXX. The entries on "LXX and NT" in ? 27 are subdivided into a. General, b. Individual books, c. Testimonia. The information pro- vided in ? 27a, b would probably have been more helpful if the entries had been arranged according to somewhat more specific subdivisions such as the O.T. in the N.T., the type of LXX text reflected in the N.T., and studies of N.T. MSS, grammar and lexicology relevant to LXX research. It is true that N.T. studies dealing with the latter two subjects are mentioned in ? 15 (language), but no distinction has been made there between pure LXX studies, studies discussing data from both the LXX and the N.T., N.T. studies discussing also data from the LXX and pure N.T. studies which do not discuss the LXX at all. The latter studies, if included as they are in the Cl. Bibl., should be marked in a special way. Similarly there is room for a subdivision of studies in the sections on the LXX and Qumran (? 25) and "Patristica" (? 31), i.e., the Fathers andthe LXX. In this section some readers might wish to see subsections on types of Patristic exegesis, exegesis of particular texts and words, and the type of LXX text reflected in Patristic works. Further, one bibliography ought to have been mentioned from which much additional information may be had: Bibliographia Patristica, Internationale Patristische Bibliographie (Berlin, 1959-).4) The Catenae, containing mainly Patristic material, are not mentioned as part of ? 31 nor in its vicinity, but as part of ? 35 (Manuscripts). Thus the present classification stresses only the text-critical importance of the Catenae. 4. Several of the misplacements of studies in the sections of the Cl. Bibl. are probably due to often misleading titles, while too little attention is paid to their contents. It seems that the uninitiated reader, especially the student, could often have been guided by a better classification and by the inclusion of a larger number of studies in certain sections. An example of this point is ? 6 ("Significance of the LXX"). This section could have listed or referred to studies on textual criticism, theology, exegesis, inspiration, etc. Instead, one finds merely a list of ten studies in whose title the word "significance" (Bedeutung, etc.) occurs. Similarly, SPERBER's Septuaginta-Probleme is incor- rectly listed as a "survey article" (? 4). However, this monograph deals with the classification of MSS of the LXX, the LXX as a translation, and the LXX variants in the Psalms. 806</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS The choice of the topics covered by the Cl. Bibl. has been determined by the editors on the basis of a thorough knowledge of the scope of LXX scholarship. A few additional (sub)sections may nevertheless be suggested for a revised edition of the Cl. Bibl.: A selection of editions of Patristic commentaries and Catenae; a selection of O.T. commentaries which are of particular importance for LXX research;5) an alphabetical list of LXX words discussed in the literature - this is a major project, but as a modest beginning the studies listed in sections 12 and 15 can be arranged alpha- betically as in several N.T. bibliographies;6) Hebraisms. In the bibliographical references in the Cl. Bibl., "LXX" may stand for either Septuagint, (der) Septuaginta, Septuagintal, Septante, etc. Old Testa- ment, etc., is designated as O.T. N.T. stands once for Testament (MOULTON- MILLIGAN, p. 29). Verse references are written, e.g., as XIX. 18 also when the actual reference is 19, 18. In view of this it is not always advisable to quote titles directly from the Cl. Bibl. Finally, a few corrections and remarks on individual entries.

The present reviewer learned a great deal from its contents, and he hopes that the mere listing and classification of the entries will bring the listed studies to the attention of many scholars and will in this way enrich and advance LXX scholarship.

Part II is still essentially the work of BAUMGARTNER, who died in 1970, and his original collaborators. It had been intended that this part should go as far as the letter 'ayin, but it was decided, after the death of KUTSCHER in 1971, to go no farther than the end of the material for which he had done the necessary work on Post-biblical Hebrew. The present editors, however, have made some additions and other changes, and have prepared a revised list of abbreviations. The form of the second part rightly remains unchanged, and so does its character; and it is unnecessary to repeat here the general description and criticisms that I made in my earlier review. I shall, however, comment on BAUMGARTNER'S treatment of some words, and examine the new table of abbreviations. I Some words that are found in both qere and kethibh forms in the Hebrew Bible are set out in a strange way in Part II. The consonants of the former are printed with the vowels of the latter to give p s .?, "H? , Tpn ,n D1?t, This method of presenting the words is idiosyncratic: it is not found in, for example, the dictionaries of BDB or Gesenius-Buhl, or in the first edition of Koehler-Baumgartner. Even Part I of the third edition does not offer us 7,r or i'lr-and Part II itself draws the line at suggesting that there was a form "Jehovah". It may be granted that the reader of the Hebrew Bible sees a combination of qere vowels and kethibh consonants before him in the text, but he was never meant to read them together as a forma mixta: the intention was that he should read the vowels of the qere with the consonants appropriate to them. It is to be hoped that this un- satisfactory method of printing Hebrew words will be abandoned in Part III. Vetus Testamentum, Vol. XXV, Pac. 4 810</page></plain_text>
