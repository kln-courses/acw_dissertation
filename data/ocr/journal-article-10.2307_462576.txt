<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES LONGENBACH Matthew Arnold and the Modern Apocalypse W E HAVE NO WAY of knowing that this age is one of the worst in the world's history," wrote Robert Frost in a 1935 letter to the Amherst Student. " . . . It is immodest of a man to think of himself as going down before the worst forces ever mobilized by God" (Selected Prose 105). This statement is clearly directed against the Eliot of The Waste Land-or, more important, against the generation of readers who took Eliot's tempting comments in "Ulysses, Order, and Myth" about the "immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary his- tory" as a key for explaining the necessary difficulty of modern literature (177). In recent years, many readers have found it easier to see the high modern- ists' claim of historical necessity as a self-deluding gesture that disguises a personal dilemma or an un- savory moral vision. In The Sense of an Ending Frank Kermode demonstrates that modernist myths of final things too often go hand in hand with moralities of final solutions. Against the totalizing rhetoric of finality he finds in Eliot and Yeats, Ker- mode proposes the pragmatically flexible fictions of Stevens. And though Frost does not play a part in Kermode's argument, Kermode echoes the poet who wondered in "Design" if there could be a totalizing "design of darkness" to "govern in a thing so small" as a spider's entrapment of a moth (Po- etry 302): "It is commonplace to talk about our historical situation as uniquely terrible and in a way privileged, a cardinal point of time. But can it really be so? . . . [I]t would be childish to argue, in a dis- cussion of how people behave under eschatological threat, that nuclear bombs are more real and make one experience more authentic crisis-feelings than armies in the sky" (95).1 Kermode's strategy for exposing the modernist myth of apocalypse is to point out that its rhetoric repeats previous claims for ultimate historical necessity. Frost, in his calculatedly unpretentious way, does the same thing: "Arnold claimed the honor for the age before this. Wordsworth claimed it for the last but one. And so on back through lit- erature" (Selected Prose 105). For both Frost and Kermode, Arnold emerges as the crucial (and there- fore shortsighted) progenitor of the mythology of modern apocalypse. And while Arnold was cer- tainly not the first or only powerful writer to pro- claim that the sky is falling, he did provide us with a rhetoric of finality that we commonly use today, despite the warnings of Frost or Kermode. Arnold helped make the Eliot of "Ulysses, Order, and Myth" possible with, among other texts, his 1863 essay on Heine: Modern times find themselves with an immense system of institutions, established facts, accredited dogmas, cus- toms, rules, which have come to them from times not modern. In this system their life has to be carried forward; yet they have a sense that this system is not of their own creation, that it by no means corresponds exactly with the wants of their actual life. ("Heinrich Heine" 109) One hundred years later, faced with a different set of historical events, Irving Howe explains his mod- ern dilemma in much the same way: "Man is mired-you can take your choice-in the mass, in the machine, in the city, in his loss of faith, in the hopelessness of a life without anterior intention or terminal value" (15). The only difference between Arnold's rhetoric and Howe's is the self-con- sciousness Howe brings to the argument: we may "take our choice" among the now self-evident ver- sions of the modern predicament. Howe is aware that his idea of the modern has a history, but un- like Kermode, he does not question the status of that idea's rhetoric. Although Howe's conception of modernism epitomizes a tacit assumption of many interpreta- tions of twentieth-century literature, most readers have become increasingly aware that this way of ex- plaining modernism will not account for the work of Stevens or Marianne Moore or Virginia Woolf; we have seen what these authors' reputations stand to lose when their work is forced into this idea of the modern. And though Howe's idea owes a great debt to the formulations of Arnold and Eliot, it will not fully account for those writers either-or for Yeats and Tennyson, whose Tower and Idylls offer equally powerful visions of the end. In order to take 844</page><page sequence="2">James Longenbach 845 the warnings proposed by Frost and Kermode as seriously as they deserve to be taken, we must be- come aware of a doubleness that informs the tra- dition of modern apocalypse. Both The Waste Land and "Empedocles on Etna," Arnold's most rigor- ous essay in apocalypse, serve up a rhetoric of fi- nality that makes further exhortations of the modern wasteland possible, but at the same time these texts offer a penetrating indictment of that rhetoric. An account of modernism such as Howe's borrows the rhetoric but ignores the indictment; Kermode offers the indictment but fails to point out that the terms of his account are made possible by the high moderns themselves. The work of previous conceptions of modernism that rely heavily on the myth of apocalypse can be undone by Eliot, Yeats, Arnold, and Tennyson: the tradition contains its own critique.2 To uncover that latent critique, I focus on Ar- nold's "Empedocles on Etna" as a synecdoche for the tradition at large. While many Romantic and post-Romantic works could be substituted, "Em- pedocles" reveals with particular clarity and poi- gnancy the doubleness that informs this tradition. (And like Eliot, Arnold is still too easily dismissed as the lame eulogist for his age.) Before turning to Arnold, however, I examine the ways in which later heralds of the modern apocalypse both appropri- ate Arnold's metaphors and, without recognizing that Arnold's work made theirs possible, claim that the historical pressures of their age superseded his. "Empedocles on Etna" not only prefigures modern- ist fantasies of apocalypse but reveals the danger (and the inevitability) of each generation's new repe- tition of apocalyptic rhetoric. This internalized cri- tique is so stringent that it even exposes a blindness in some postmodern assessments of the modern apocalypse. Like recent readers of textuality, for in- stance, Arnold understands the difference between myths and fictions; he is not convinced, however, that a self-conscious recognition of the fictional or rhetorical status of an argument prevents the argu- ment's political consequences from being acted out in the world. As Kenneth Burke puts it in a discus- sion of I. A. Richards, Arnold shows us that "fic- tions are implicit in our acts" (Permanence 253). In 1936 Stephen Spender published a study of modern literature in which he offered this generali- zation about Eliot, Yeats, Pound, Lawrence, and James: "All these writers seem to me, faced by the destructive element; that is, by the experience of an all-pervading Present, which is a world without be- lief. This situation is accurately described by I. A. Richards, who finds in The Waste Land the expres- sion of the predicament of a generation" (14). Spender explains that the same predicament could be found in Pound's Hugh Selwyn Mauberley, in Yeats's "Second Coming," and in Henry James's "final epistolary gasp at the outbreak of the war" (12-13). Spender's book, The Destructive Element, takes its title from a novel to which he merely alludes in the passage I have just quoted: "In the destructive element immerse," writes Conrad in Lord Jim (131). For Spender, the "destructsive element" is not sim- ply a metaphor but a phrase that names a historical condition experienced by typically modern authors. Yet Spender's use of the phrase conceals a geneal- ogy that leads backward through Richards and Eliot to Matthew Arnold; Spender does not borrow the expression directly from Conrad. Richards, the first critic to treat Eliot's poetry seriously, writes in a 1925 essay, "A Background for Contemporary Poetry" (incorporated into Science and Poetry the following year), that a "sense of desolation, of un- certainty, of futility, of the baselessness of aspira- tions, of the vanity of endeavor, and a thirst for a life-giving water which seems suddenly to have failed, are the signs in consciousness of this neces- sary reorganization of our lives." To this sentence Richards adds a now famous footnote: To those familar with Mr. Eliot's The Waste Land, my in- debtedness to it at this point will be evident. He seems to me by this poem, to have performed two considerable ser- vices for this generation. He has given a perfect emotive description of a state of mind which is probably inevita- ble for a while to all those who most matter. Secondly, by effecting a complete severance between his poetry and all beliefs, and this without any weakening of the poetry, he has realised what might otherwise have remained largely a speculative possibility, and has shown the way to the only solution of these difficulties. "In the destruc- tive element immerse. That is the way." (520) For Richards, Eliot's achievement was to have writ- ten a poem that expressed the plight of a generation. Even though Richards describes this historical con- dition by drawing metaphors of desiccation and destruction from The Waste Land and Lord Jim, he says that this wasteland state of mind preceded the poem and that it was Eliot's triumph to have named it. The title The Waste Land is not mere metaphor to Richards but mimetic truth, and Spender and</page><page sequence="3">846 Matthew Arnold and the Modern Apocalypse Howe, following Richards, take secondhand met- aphors as even surer realities.3 After reading The Waste Land, early interpreters saw the world around them in a new way, and the poem became the place where they lived. Along with many writers before them, they may have felt some of these now characteristically modern emo- tions before they read the poem, but the poem named the emotions, and readers in turn used the poem to name the world. In pointing this out, I do not mean to say that The Waste Land or "The Sec- ond Coming" should be read ahistorically; these works are inextricably linked to, among other historical events, the Great War. The danger here is the radical historicization of a metaphor; it is sim- ply weak historicism to make a privileged claim for one writer's feelings of modern apocalypse without paying attention to his or her debts to previous writers. In pointing out the continuities of apoca- lyptic rhetoric, however, I do not necessarily mean to argue against a conception of history that privi- leges rupture over continuity. My point is that the idea of rupture, discontinuity, or historical ultimacy may itself become an illusory center, offering an- other totalizing account of history rather than sub- verting previous ones. Much of the critical tradition surrounding literary modernism succumbs to this danger by reserving Eliot's or Arnold's metaphors for the exclusive relevance of one historical period. At this point it becomes crucial to see that Eliot was often more aware of these dangers than his readers were. While I have demonstrated that the rhetoric of his interpreters is derived from Eliot himself, Eliot cautioned his followers that their rhetoric repeated Arnold's. When Eliot first responded to Richards's comments on The Waste Land in "A Note on Poetry and Belief" (1927), he said that Richards seemed to be slightly under the sentimental influence of Matthew Arnold, . . . wandering between two worlds, one dead, etc. He speaks as if, up to a certain moment, perhaps about sixty years ago, the world had lain dreaming (per- haps hit by the "snowball of science" of which he speaks) placidly in religious faith, and had then waked suddenly to find itself inadequately clad in an environment which had changed its climate. He speaks, that is, as if people had always believed the same things in the same way. (16) Here the maker of the wasteland metaphor is divest- ing himself of responsibility for the wasteland myth, reemphasizing its figural status. While Richards saw The Waste Land as a mirror for the conditions of the twentieth century, Eliot points out that Richards's argument is prefigured by earlier writers' fantasies of apocalypse. To make this point, Eliot demonstrates that Richards's argument is based on a faulty historicism: the presentation of one period as distinctively modern by virtue of its unprecedented chaos depends on a static vision of history; no previous age, Richards implies, was so wrenched by the violence of change. By foregrounding Richards's dependence on Ar- nold, Eliot performs the same task accomplished by Kermode's comparison of modern and medieval fantasies of apocalypse; one claim for historical ultimacy is revealed as a repetition of a previous claim. Richards was indeed under the sentimental influence of Arnold (sentimental because his read- ing of Arnold radically oversimplifies the Victorian poet in order to highlight the intelligence of the modern poet). His essay "A Background for Con- temporary Poetry" begins with an epigraph ("yet we / Have a worse course to steer") taken from these lines in Arnold's "Stanzas in Memory of the Author of 'Obermann"': But Wordsworth's eyes avert their ken From half of human fate; And Goethe's course few sons of men May think to emulate. For he pursued a lonely road, His eyes on Nature's plan; Neither made man too much a God, Nor God too much a man. Strong was he, with a spirit free From mists, and sane, and clear; Clearer, how much! than ours-yet we Have a worse course to steer. (138)4 The fault line around which Richards's argument is constructed becomes clear when the words Richards cites are read in the context of Arnold's poem. While Richards wants to assert that his mod- ern dilemma is worse than Arnold's, Arnold wants to assert the primacy of his dilemma over Words- worth's and Goethe's. When Richards reprinted his essay in Science and Poetry he deleted the epigraph-unwilling, it would seem, to face the fact that his characterization of his task as a "worse course" than any before it was a repetition of Ar- nold's claim. The efficacy of Richards's argument, as Eliot points out, depends on its having no histor- ical precedent.</page><page sequence="4">James Longenbach 847 Eliot realized that the issue at stake in a discus- sion of The Waste Land is the difficulty of separat- ing the chaos of consciousness from the chaos of culture. In a 1930 essay on Tourneur he provides an analysis of The Revenger's Tragedy that is clearly a misplaced commentary on his own poem: We are apt to expect of youth only a fragmentary view of life; we incline to see youth as exaggerating the impor- tance of its narrow experience and imagining the world as did Chicken Licken. But occasionally the intensity of the vision of its own ecstasies or horrors, combined with a mastery of words and rhythm, may give to a juvenile work a universality which is beyond the author's knowl- edge of life to give, and to which mature men and women can respond. (Selected Essays 166) Eliot knew that his wasteland was not the em- bodiment of a generation's predicament but a young man's interpretation of a narrow range of experience. Lurking within The Waste Land is a voice similar to that of Wallace Stevens's Crispin, who contemplates an apocalyptic vision in "The Comedian as the Letter C" ("a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky") but stops short: "Should he lay by the personal and make / Of his own fate an in- stance of all fate?" (Collected Poems 41).5 Even Yeats, who offers his age its most treasured apoca- lypse in "The Second Coming," similarly questions his own rhetoric in a companion poem, "A Prayer for My Daughter"; there he wonders if the trouble might not be one of consciousness rather than of culture: "Because of the great gloom that is in [his] mind" he has "heard the sea-wind scream" and imagined that "the future years had come" (403). And what is surely Eliot's most popular prophetic statement, the passage on history in "Gerontion," is similarly questioned by an internalized critique. Just before he published his poem, Eliot crossed out the word "nature" and wrote "history"- "Gerontion" originally told us that "[n]ature has many cunning passages, contrived corridors." "Gerontion" is less a blind repetition of apocalyp- tic rhetoric than an analysis of the sensibility that produces such claims. Nature is no more responsi- ble for modern chaos than history is, and the root of the problem may be found in the "dull head among windy spaces" that accounts for nature or history (Complete Poems 21).6 Despite this self-consciousness, Eliot had his own blindness too, because he read Arnold in much the same way that Howe or Richards read The Waste Land, not allowing for anything but a representa- tion of the world's chaos in the poetry. In his 1930 essay "Arnold and Pater" (written when he was working hard to distance himself from The Waste Land), Eliot turned Pater's characterization of Coleridge back on Arnold and Pater themselves: they represent "that inexhaustible discontent, lan- guor, and homesickness . . . the chords of which ring all through our modern literature" (Selected Essays 393).7 Conscious that this sentence de- scribed the author he no longer desired to be as well as it described Arnold, Eliot made Arnold stand for the wasteland sensibility he himself had rejected. To highlight the ironic dimension of his own work, Eliot needed to point to an unambiguous expression of the modern malaise. And his strategy for doing so is precisely that for which he criticizes Richards: the strength of his own rejection of this "modern" condition depends on his presupposition that the rejection has no historical precedent in Arnold. Even as Eliot falls into this trap, however, the work he examines resists and complicates his blind- ness: like "Gerontion," Tennyson's Idylls, Arnold's "Empedocles," and Browning's "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came" make an apocalyptic claim for the age and, at the same time, undermine the epistemological grounds from which that claim is made. Throughout Browning's poem not only is it unclear to what extent the quest through the waste- land is imagined, the quester's task is made all the more arduous by his knowledge that his story has been lived and told before: "To set [his] foot upon a dead man's cheek" (589) is the fear that fills him as he journeys to his own demise, denied even the consolation that such an end is his and his alone. Upon reaching the round, squat tower he hears a noise tolling like a bell-"Names in my ears / Of all the lost adventurers my peers" (592). Tennyson's questers heard the same voices. Although "The Passing of Arthur," the apocalypse of Idylls of the King, necessarily comes last in the final arrange- ment of Tennyson's poem (1885), the bulk of this section was written first and was published as "Morte d'Arthur" in 1842. Coupled with a compan- ion poem called "The Epic" (a Victorian frame for the medieval tale), this earlier version of the end is overtly self-critical: as the knights of the Round Ta- ble lament that "the true old times are dead," the wheezy Victorian gentlemen who listen to the tale lament the "general decay of faith" in their own time: "at home was little left, / And none abroad: there was no anchor, none, / To hold by" (17, 2). By revealing one generation's rhetoric of finality as the</page><page sequence="5">848 Matthew Arnold and the Modern Apocalypse repetition of another's, Tennyson anticipates both Eliot's rebuttal to Richards and Kermode's critique of modernism at large. This argument is worked out even more intri- cately in Arnold's "Empedocles on Etna" (1852). Like Eliot, Arnold sometimes privileges the histor- ical exigencies of his age, but like Eliot's Gerontion, Arnold's Empedocles is a persona trapped in the troubled space between culture and consciousness. And what makes the poem so interesting is that un- like Eliot's persona, Empedocles realizes that the dilemma is his own even as he blames the age; he understands that his claim of historical ultimacy is undermined by a long history of similar claims. To reveal this double argument is to show how Arnold's work complicates not only the apocalyptic rheto- ric of the moderns but also postmodern analyses of it. And to understand this doubleness, we first need to pay attention to the construction of authorial voice in Arnold's poem. On 23 September 1849, the day before he fol- lowed Byron's Manfred on a journey to the Swiss Alps, Arnold wrote this famous letter to Clough: My dearest Clough these are damned times-everything is against one-the height to which knowledge is come, the spread of luxury, our physical enervation, the absence of great natures, the unavoidable contact with millions of small ones, newspapers, cities, light profligate friends, moral desperadoes like Carlyle, our own selves, and the sickening consciousness of our difficulties. (Letters 111) Arnold was at work on "Empedocles" as he wrote these words, and as many readers have no- ticed, the words could easily belong to the Empedo- cles who climbs Mount Etna: according to his friend Pausanias, Empedocles "swells with the swelling evil of this time" (161). Despite our knowl- edge that Empedocles could be a dramatic persona, the fact that Arnold felt compelled to reject "Em- pedocles" (just as Eliot worked to distance himself from The Waste Land) enforces our sense that the character speaks the author's dilemma; both poems have been read more as lyric utterance than as a tan- gle of voices.8 In her discussion of "lyric time" Sharon Cameron differentiates the lyrical mode from the dramatic: Unlike the drama, whose province is conflict, . . . the lyric voice is solitary and generally speaks out of a sin- gle moment in time. . . The heart of the lyric's sense of time might be specified, at least preliminarily, by its propensity to interiorize as ambiguity or outright con- tradiction those conflicts that other mimetic forms conspicuously exteriorize and then allocate to discrete characters who enact them in the manifest pull of oppo- site points of view. (22-23) This distinction operates quite nicely until we are confronted by a poem like Prometheus Unbound, "Empedocles on Etna," or The Waste Land-a dra- matic lyric, a lyrical drama: such a poem does in- deed exteriorize its conflicts by assigning multiple voices to multiple characters, but it also undermines those distinctions with its lyricality, emphasizing the singular (and possibly authorial) voice of the whole. Eliot literalizes this tension in his notes to The Waste Land when he suggests that all the characters in his poem merge in Tiresias; inter- preters of the poem naturally read it as a lyric ut- terance and equate Eliot with his protagonist. Similarly, despite our good sense that "Empedo- cles" is a dramatic poem, we recognize that it is a closet drama, a poem that expresses many of the same emotions we find in Arnold's more unambig- uously lyric poems. The voice of Empedocles does not seem so different from the voice we easily ac- cept as Arnold's in "Switzerland": "We mortal mil- lions live alone" (130). Arnold himself said, "I merely use Empedocles and Obermann as mouth- pieces through which to vent my own opinions" (Tinker and Lowry 287). Yet readers must become aware that whether those opinions issue from the mouth of Arnold or of Empedocles, they do not form one single and coherent voice; the dramatic tension is contained within the lyrical utterance. Consequently, while I believe that "Empedocles" must be read as a conflict between different voices, I also think that the doubleness that creates the es- sential conflict in the poem is found within the voice of Empedocles-not in his dialogue with the other characters; this tension depends not on the ex- clusively dramatic nature of the utterance but on the ambiguous status of the poem as both drama and lyric. The more identifiably lyrical "Switzerland" presents this doubleness in a less radical version than it takes in "Empedocles." In some parts of "Switzerland" Arnold blames the failure of his love affair with Marguerite on a force outside the self: "A God, a God their severance ruled!" (131). But at other points in the poem he blames his inviolable isolation on a force that is nothing but the self:</page><page sequence="6">James Longenbach 849 The heart can bind itself alone And faith may oft be unreturned. Self-swayed our feelings ebb and swell. (127) Throughout "Empedocles on Etna" it is similarly unclear whether the poem's chaos is the product of the self or of the age, whether the coming apoca- lypse is one of consciousness or of culture. In the second act, when Empedocles leaves Callicles and Pausanias behind to climb to the summit of Mount Etna, the voice of Empedocles most clearly matches the voice of the Arnold who told Clough that "these are damned times-everything is against one." But over all the world What suffering is there not seen Of plainness oppressed by cunning, As the well-counselled Zeus oppressed That self-helping son of earth! What anguish of greatness, Railed and hunted from the world, Because its simplicity rebukes This envious, miserable age! (192) In these lines Empedocles blames his despair, as Arnold himself did, on his diminished age. The reference to Prometheus, oppressed by Zeus, is instructive when we recall that in Shelley's poem Prometheus breaks his bonds not by rebelling against his oppressor (an act that validates the op- pression) but through an act of generosity. Em- pedocles can muster no such act, because he does not seem to realize (as does Shelley's Prometheus) that his oppression is the result of his state of mind. Instead, he rejects his political life ("Lie there / My golden circlet / My purple robe") and his poetic life ("And lie thou there / My laurel bough") and de- nies his responsibility for his predicament by blam- ing the stars (192, 194).9 Eliot might have responded to these lines the way he responded to Tourneur's Revenger's Tragedy and his own personal wasteland, but the Shelleyan voice of Swinburne's "Hertha" offers an even more ap- propriate rebuke. Hertha, the spirit of an undif- ferentiated whole out of which individuals were made, chastizes them for creating a deity to whom men and women say, "I am I, thou art thou, / I am low, thou art high." Swinburne's point is that as soon as we conceive of a force outside the self, that force becomes the oppressor, a deity whom we can blame for the self's deficiencies. The "God that ye made," says the voice of Hertha, "thunders in heaven": "Was it hard to be free?" (138, 143-44). Two years after Swinburne published "Hertha" in 1871, Nietzsche provided a name for the self's ail- ment in his essay "On Truth and Lies in a Nonmoral Sense": "anthropomorphic error." Nietzsche stresses that we must see that our conceptual forms ordering the flux of experience are anthropo- morphic projections; they are heuristic fictions, metaphors, not the embodiments of the essence of experience. "What then is truth?" asks Nietzsche. He replies: A moveable host of metaphors, metonymies, and an- thropomorphisms: in short, a sum of human relations which have been poetically and rhetorically intensified, transferred, and embellished, and which, after long us- age, seem to a people to be fixed, canonical, and bind- ing. Truths are illusions which we have forgotten are illusions; they are metaphors that have become worn out and have been drained of sensuous force. (84) In Nietzsche's world of metaphor, truths are merely reified figures of speech, fossil poetry. We are not safe in truth, because we have forgotten that the orders by which we live are human constructions, forms not inherent in the world they govern. To es- cape the anthropomorphic error, says Nietzsche, we must make new metaphors: "The drive toward the formulation of metaphors is the fundamental hu- man drive, which one cannot for a single instant dis- pense with in thought, for one would thereby dispense with man himself" (88-89). These remarks have recently gained great cur- rency as readers have discovered precedent for their own interest in the rhetoricity of all human truths. Arnold himself may serve as another precedent- despite Empedocles's flagrant commitment of the anthropomorphic error. The entire argument of Arnold's St. Paul and Protestantism (1870) is con- cerned with demonstrating that the Puritan tradi- tion has erred in taking Paul's figures of speech literally. Arnold's tough-minded criticism of Scrip- ture and biblical hermeneutics is predicated on the conviction that language cannot possibly embody truth. While most people "who care for religion" desire "the materialism of the Apocalypse," says Arnold, we must become comfortable with the in- stability of figurative language (71). Like Nietzsche, Arnold recognizes that to speak about God or the apocalypse is to commit the anthropomorphic er- ror. Throughout Literature and Dogma (1873) Ar-</page><page sequence="7">850 Matthew Arnold and the Modern Apocalypse nold quotes a phrase from Goethe as a refrain: "Man never knows how anthropomorphic he is, says Goethe; and so man tends always to represent everything under his own figure" (184). All meta- physical statements about a deity (even the use of the word he), Arnold explains in God and the Bi- ble (1875), are necessarily anthropomorphic pro- jections, figures of speech that masquerade as incarnate truths. The origin of the "original figure" is "soon forgotten," and we are left with this skep- tical conclusion: "To such a degree do words make man, who invents them, their sport!" (187, 188). That is precisely the outcome for Empedocles in the second act of Arnold's poem. Immediately af- ter he blames the age and the stars for his predica- ment, he realizes that he has succumbed to the anthropomorphic error: "I alone / Am dead to life and joy, therefore I read / In all things my own dead- ness" (200). With these lines we begin to see the dou- bleness that informs Empedocles's speech: he is completely aware of the faultiness of his tirades against his apparent oppressors; he knows he has mistaken metaphors for truths, consciousness for culture. And what makes this recognition of the an- thropomorphic error so uncanny in "Empedocles" is that when Arnold himself denigrates his age in his letters to Clough, he exhibits none of his persona's chastening self-consciousness. Yet unlike Empedo- cles, Arnold came down from the mountain. As Arnold stages it, Empedocles's suicide is an extraordinarily humanizing act because Empedo- cles himself has already voiced a critique of the state of mind that propels him to end his life. In the first act Pausanias tells us a great deal about Empedo- cles before we hear the philosopher's voice. While Pausanias explains that his master "swells with the swelling evil of this time," Callicles offers a differ- ent version of Empedocles's dilemma. He accuses Pausanias of falling into the anthropomorphic error: "Thou hast some wrong from thine own citizens" and "on that, / Straightway thou fallest to arraign the times, / As if the sky was impious not to fall" (162). Callicles accuses Empedocles of the same error ("'Tis not the times, 'tis not the sophists vex him; / There is some root of suffering in him- self" [163]), but when Empedocles finally speaks for himself he confounds the diagnoses of both Pausanias and Callicles. Empedocles emerges as the most skeptical voice in the drama, offering an ex- planation of the epistemological grounds on which a rejection of the anthropomorphic error is based: Mind is the spell which governs earth and heaven. Man has a mind with which to plan his safety; Know that, and help thyself! (165) This statement introduces the conflict from which the drama of "Empedocles on Etna" gains its power: Empedocles clearly sees his predicament differently from either Pausanias or Callicles. Yet as I have intimated, the more potent conflict lurks within Empedocles's speech itself. Most of act 1 is taken up not with dramatic exchange but with Em- pedocles's long (70 stanzas) lyrical utterance. After the statement that the mind governs heaven and earth, Empedocles hears his words quoted back to him by Pausanias ("Mind is a light which the Gods mock us with"), and the opening stanzas of Em- pedocles's song enhance this contradiction in his thought. Empedocles describes the soul as a mir- ror hung by the gods: Hither and thither spins The wind-borne, mirroring soul, A thousand glimpses wins, and never sees a whole; Looks once, and drives elsewhere, and leaves its vast employ. (167-68) Although he has just chastized Pausanias with a recognition of the anthropomorphic error, Em- pedocles now offers the alternative worldview: the human soul is no lamp but a mirror, an insufficient reflector of gods that are creators rather than cre- ations. Nevertheless, Empedocles still maintains that the cure for this malady is to "[s]ink in thyself! there ask what ails thee, at that shrine!" (170). Yet if the soul is indeed a mirror, with only the barest thread preventing it from shattering, what kind of inner substance can it contain? By the end of his song Empedocles asserts a position opposite from where he began: So, loth to suffer mute, We, peopling the void air, Make Gods to whom to impute The ills we ought to bear; With God and Fate to rail at, suffering easily. (177) In these lines, as in Swinburne's "Hertha," human beings are not mirrors of the gods; rather the gods are mirrors of them-their own creations and the</page><page sequence="8">James Longenbach 851 source of their oppression. In our intent to "attach blame elsewhere" than in our own selves, says Em- pedocles, "we at will invent / Stern Powers who make their care / To embitter human life" (178). Fi- nally, Empedocles explicitly undermines the propo- sition with which he began: deceiving ourselves, we say to the gods we have created, "You only can take in / The world's immense design" (179). The human soul is consequently not a mirror capable of reflect- ing only a tiny fragment of the whole but the source of every fragmentary reflection. Empedocles's song is carefully constructed to defeat its own presuppositions. Yet as we have already seen, the second act of the drama adds an- other irony to the irony of the song, as Empedocles violates his skeptical admonishing of Pausanias, attributing malice to a world he himself has mis- identified as the lamp rather than the mirror. Two other vital contradictions emerge in the second act. While in the long lyric of act 1 Empedocles cautions that "man . . . errs because he dreams / The world does but exist that welfare to bestow" (172), in act 2 he acquiesces to just that danger in a speech cast in Wordsworthian blank verse (lines 235-57). Similarly-and even more potently-the Empedo- cles of act 1 cautions that both our cries of bliss and our cries of anguish are not new: "Others have urged it too- / Our wants have all been felt, our errors made before" (174). This is the lesson Frost would bring to a purveyor of modern apocalypse, yet in act 2 Empedocles falls into the same trap Richards stumbles into when he quotes from "Stanzas in Memory of the Author of 'Obermann"' as a preface to his exploration of modern poetry. "And each succeeding age in which we are born / Will have more peril for us than the last," Empedo- cles says before he plunges into the volcano, aware that he has justified his suicide on intellectually in- defensible grounds (202). Arnold once admitted to his sister that it was im- possible "to make [his] poems square in all their parts" (Unpublished Letters 18). Yet the double ar- gument of "Empedocles on Etna" contributes to the greatness of the poem. That sustained con- tradiction is summed up in a line Empedocles speaks near the beginning of act 2: "He fables, yet speaks truth!" (191). This line occurs, in fact, just before the lines I first quoted, the speech in which Empedocles blames his miserable age for his predicament. In this speech and throughout the second half of the poem, Empedocles is himself fabling to speak truth. Having revealed the paucity of his philosophy, he nevertheless continues to despair; self-consciousness does not save Empedo- cles from self-destruction. Callicles's song about the death of the giant Typho provokes Empedocles's statement about truth and fable. In flagrant opposition to the an- thropomorphic error Empedocles has just exposed, Callicles explains that the volcano's eruptions are the groans of the fallen Typho. Though Empedo- cles realizes that these "rumblings are not Typho's groans" he nevertheless sees that Callicles . . . fables, yet speaks truth! The brave, impetuous heart yields everywhere To the subtle, contriving head. (191) Empedocles also fables to speak truth when he blames the gods for his fate, conscious that he has created the gods himself; when he condemns the age as worse than any previous age, conscious that others have made the same claim before him; when he looks to the world for comfort, conscious that the human predicament begins when we expect na- ture to act beneficently; and finally (and most po- tently) when he throws himself into the volcano in order to merge his soul with the elements, conscious that he has just exposed that kind of pantheism as an anthropomorphic projection. In "Empedocles on Etna" a self-conscious fiction is as potent a killer as is a reified myth.'0 In a sense, Arnold spent the remainder of his career fabling to speak truth. In his 1849 letter to Clough, Arnold offers an apparently unself- conscious condemnation of his modern age, but in "Dover Beach" (1867) he hears the wail of human misery in the ocean's roar and (like his Empedocles) is aware that "Sophocles long ago / Heard it on the iEgvean" (255). Even the anthropomorphic error will be repeated again and again, no matter how often it is exposed: we fable, yet speak truth. Ar- nold's poem presented this lesson with particular power, but as I have suggested, the lesson is not unique. The tradition so fully contains its own cri- tique that one must begin to wonder what a single- minded statement of apocalypse could look like. And yet such apparently single-minded state- ments appear with startling regularity. Irving Howe's well-known essay provides one example. But</page><page sequence="9">852 Matthew Arnold and the Modern Apocalypse even more recently, what leads a promising young poet (Brad Leithauser) to describe a considerable older poet (Anthony Hecht) by invoking a great modern poet in this way: "Even while we are hop- ing that Elizabeth Bishop was wrong in evaluating ours as the 'worse century so far,' . . . hers is a judg- ment that many of us-and perhaps most writers- share" (11)? What compels the novelist Cynthia Ozick to say: "'Things fall apart; the center cannot hold.' That, we used to think, was the whole of Modernism.. . . Now we know better, and also, in a way, worse. Yeats hardly foresaw how our dis- solutions would surpass his own"? And what leads Mark Taylor to make this statement in a discussion of deconstructive philosophy: "In the postmodern era, God is dead; art is exhausted; philosophy is fin- ished; literature is merely preserved. In Yeats's words, 'Things fall apart; the center cannot hold'"? (3). Each of these statements makes a privileged claim for contemporary historical pressures while employing the rhetoric of modernist claims. And two of them invoke the apocalypse of Yeats's "Sec- ond Coming" without any apparent consciousness that even Yeats threw this rhetoric into question. It would appear that postmodern assessments of his- tory are destined to repeat the modernists, just as the modernists repeated Arnold and Tennyson. Be- hind these statements lurks only half of Empedo- cles's intricate credo: "And each succeeding age in which we are born / Will have more peril for us than the last" (202). No one would want to underestimate the horrors perpetrated in this or any other century, but the ten- dency to invoke the end of all such events can be dangerously self-blinding. As Frost suggests, state- ments of this sort can cheer us up; if too easily employed, the rhetoric of ends and ultimacies will help obscure the history of our time. And as Ker- mode suggests, it does not seem coincidental that fantasies of apocalypse led Yeats and Lawrence to sympathize with political programs that threatened to bring that event to pass. Yet I wonder if a differ- entiation between a "fictional" and a "mythic" con- figuration of such fantasies will help stem the repetitious cycle of apocalyptic rhetoric. Both the moderns and the postmoderns owe their sense of discourse as heuristic fiction to the thinkers of the nineteenth century."l We look back to Herder, to Nietzsche, to the Carlyle of SartorResartus; by 1911 Hans Vaihinger could codify and paraphrase their thought in The Philosophy of 'As If" a work that would be translated into English by I. A. Richards's collaborator C. K. Ogden. J. Hillis Miller, a reader who would invoke some of these thinkers as part of his own tradition, has recently offered a brief anal- ysis of "Empedocles on Etna" in which he focuses on the passage concerning fable and truth. In his effort to understand all truths as fables, Miller sees the passage as a microcosm for the entire poem: "In light of what Empedocles says in Act I, his suicide in Act II in order to preserve the last strand of connection between his mind and the four elements can be nothing but an allegory. No man's mind has ever had any kinship whatsoever with nature. Em- pedocles' suicide is therefore only a verbal action" (34-35). Here Miller has (as I think we should) subjected Empedocles's only action in the poem (his suicide) to the very critique Empedocles offers so cogently in his long lyric speech to Pausanias. Yet Miller misses the pathos-and the sterner skep- ticism-of Empedocles's suicide by maintaining that Empedocles's self-consciousness saves him from the devastating implications of his action. To say that the suicide occurs only in language is to maintain that the opposition between fable and truth (or Kermode's opposition of fiction and myth) is stable, utterly reliable, and that the reali- zation that our truths are "merely" fables will ulti- mately save us from our truths. But that is not what "Empedocles" shows us. In a discussion of I. A. Richards's opposition of the "statement" and the "pseudo-statement," Kenneth Burke asks how "pseudo-statements" (or fables or fictions) may be confined to the pages of books; "they must also extend to those informal arts we usually call life, experience, or action." And when that extension takes place, says Burke, "the distinc- tion between acting and play-acting, between real and make-believe, becomes obliterated" (Perma- nence 254-55). 12 Arnold also knew that in a world of action, language cannot save us; consider this passage from Literature and Dogma: The object of religion is conduct; and if a man helps him- self in his conduct by taking an object of hope and presen- timent as if it were an object of certainty, he may even be said to gain thereby an advantage. And yet there is always a drawback to a man's advan- tage in thus treating, when he deals with religion and con- duct, what is extra-belief and not certain as if it were a matter of certainty, and in making it his ground of action. He pays for it. (232) He paysfor it. This phrase, italicized by Arnold, is the ultimate lesson of "Empedocles on Etna."</page><page sequence="10">James Longenbach 853 Empedocles treats what he knows is a fable "as if" it were a truth, and he pays for it when he makes the fable the ground for his final action in the play. Wal- lace Stevens tells us in his "Adagia" that the "final belief is to believe in a fiction, which you know to be a fiction, there being nothing else. The exquisite truth is to know that it is a fiction and that you be- lieve in it willingly" (163). An even sterner Arnold reminds us that to remain aware of the fictional sta- tus of our beliefs is all well and good but that when the time comes for action we will pay for the action whether its ground is a fable or a truth. No matter how many times we caution ourselves against an apocalyptic rhetoric, that rhetoric will reappear over and over again, with and without self- consciousness: our actions are not simply verbal. Kermode maintains that when we read the work of the modernist writers, "we have to make very sub- tle distinctions between the work itself, in which the fictions are properly employed, and obiter dicta in which they are not, being either myths or danger- ous pragmatic assertions" (113). But what happens when the fiction shows itself to be as powerful as the myth? "As if" is a wonderful phrase, one that speaks to our freedom within language; it does not necessarily guarantee our freedom when language leads to action. In his introduction to Robinson's King Jasper, Frost quotes these lines from Robin- son's "Dark Hills"-"As if the last of days / Were fading and all wars were done"-and then empha- sizes, "As if they were. As if, as if!" (Selected Prose 67). The same careful attention to the power of "as if" lies at the center of Frost's own poem of mod- ern apocalypse, "Once by the Pacific": in that poem we could believe that the waves battering the shore really did embody "God's last Put out the Light" if we did not notice that it merely "looked as if a night of dark intent / Was coming," that it merely "looked as if / The shore was lucky in being backed by cliff" (Poetry 250). Even as he speaks of final things, Frost wants the freedom to dwell in the safety of "as if." So does Stevens, who offers his loveliest thoughts on apoc- alypse in "The Auroras of Autumn." Confronted by the terrifying lights in the sky in which "the ser- pent lives," Stevens wonders if by the powers of the imagination we could find "a time of innocence" in which these lights are not a spell of light A saying out of a cloud, but innocence. An innocence of the earth and no false sign Or symbol of malice. That we partake thereof, Lie down like children in this holiness, As if, awake, we lay in the quiet of sleep, As if the innocent mother sang in the dark Of the room and on an accordion, half-heard, Created the time and place in which we breathed . (Collected Poems 418-19) As if, as if, stresses Stevens, unwilling to say that his interpretation of the unnaturally lighted sky as a sign of innocence is any more inevitable than its in- terpretation as a sign of chaos. These lines offer us a freedom that the commonly known Arnold or Eliot, dogmatic and schoolmasterish, never could. But once we see how Arnold himself saw not only the pleasure but the pathos of "as if," then the fail- ure of "Empedocles" becomes something we may carry with us when we pay for our own. University of Rochester Rochester, New York Notes 1 See also Richard Poirier's essays "The Deed of Writing" and "Modernism and Its Difficulties" in The Renewal of Literature (3-66, 95-113). 2 Part of my polemical aim here is to point out that some recent conceptions of modernism, such as Perloff's "Pound/ Stevens: Whose Era?" and Meisel's Myth of the Modern, depend on a dualism that will not hold. Meisel's book is based on a be- lief that "the difference that separates Arnold from Pater also separates Eliot from Joyce, and so produces two divergent lines of High Modernism in English at large" (120). While Pater and Joyce offer texts that are "inquiries into the dynamics of read- erly temporality itself," Arnold and Eliot favor "instead an ahistoricism that refuses to address the questions it raises" (8-9). Meisel is unwilling to see that the dynamics of both sides of this dualism are infected by each other, and he maintains his ar- gument by accepting canonical readings of Arnold and Eliot at face value while subjecting Pater and Joyce to a more rigorous critique. 3 Paul de Man's "Literary History and Literary Modernity" (modified by an insight of Kenneth Burke's) helps explain this cycle of repetition. Focusing on Nietzsche's Use and Abuse of History de Man shows that among "the various antonyms that come to mind as possible opposites for 'modernity'-a variety which is itself symptomatic of the complexity of the term-none is more fruitful than 'history."' He then characterizes modernity not as a historical period but as an antihistorical state of mind,</page><page sequence="11">854 Matthew Arnold and the Modern Apocalypse "a desire to wipe out whatever came earlier, in the hope of reach- ing at last a point that could be called a true present, a point of origin that marks a new departure" (144, 148). In A Grammar of Motives Burke similarly shows that writers often transform the idea of essence into the idea of origin; to find an essence is to establish a beginning (430-40). But in A Rhetoric of Motives Burke goes on to explain (with reference to "Empedocles on Etna") that it is also commonplace to establish an essence by isolating an absolute ending (13-15). De Man maintains that any attempt to establish a point of origin is self-undermining, because that privileged moment is inevitably a repetition of previous writers' efforts to ground themselves. Combining this insight with Burke's comments about writers' needs to establish absolute end- ings, we can see the self-defeating nature of modern writers' con- tinual needs to write the apocalypse. 4 All page numbers after quotations of Arnold's poems refer to the Allotts' edition of The Poems of Matthew Arnold. S Roy Harvey Pearce suggests that "The Comedian as the Let- ter C" could have been written as a response to The Waste Land (424-25). Even though Stevens's poem appeared in Harmonium the year after Eliot's poem was published, however, the passages in "The Comedian" that appear to respond to Eliot's apocalypse are all present in Stevens's first version of the poem, "From the Journal of Crispin," written before The Waste Land was pub- lished. That Stevens's poem appears to offer so pertinent a cri- tique of a poem Stevens could not have known is another example of how fully the tradition of apocalyptic rhetoric con- tains its own critique. 6 Eliot's drafts of "Gerontion" are part of his poetry note- book in the Berg Collection, New York Public Library, Astor, Lenox, and Tilden Foundations. 7Eliot quotes from Pater's essay "Coleridge's Writings," first published in 1866 and reprinted as "Coleridge" in Appreciations. 8 Lionel Trilling was the first powerful critic to suggest that Empedocles is not Arnold's spokesman: " 'Empedocles on Etna' is a philosophical poem and very explicit; but it is also a dramatic poem and its drama lies not so much in the internal struggle of its hero or in its resolution as in its juxtaposition of two kinds of poetry" (82-83). For Trilling, the two poetries are represented by Empedocles (the voice of rationality) and Callicles (the voice of intuition), but I want to suggest that the multiple voices of Empedocles are both more antagonistic and more difficult to distinguish. In addition to Trilling's, three other readings of "Empedocles" established important precedents: in Romantic Image Frank Ker- mode emphasizes that the poem is "designed with extraordinary care, a professional job of architectonics, . . . a system of ten- sions" (13); in The Voices of Matthew Arnold W. Stacy John- son points out that in the long speech of act 1, Empedocles is "stating two apparently contradictory views of man" (109); and in Imaginative Reason Dwight Culler points out that parts of the speech are "not really Empedocles' 'creed' at all" (164). 9 The usefulness of Shelley's Prometheus Unbound in a dis- cussion of "Empedocles" raises the point that Arnold's poem (or Tennyson's Idylls or Eliot's Waste Land) is part of the same Romantic tradition of apocalyptic thought in which M. H. Abrams locates Prometheus Unbound, The Prelude, and Jerusa- lem. After the failure of the goals of the French Revolution, the Romantics proper substituted "an apocalypse of consciousness" for "an apocalypse by revelation or an apocalypse by revolution. . [T]he mind of man possesses the power, by an interior revo- lution, to transform his intellect and imagination, and by so do- ing to perceive the everyday world as a new earth in which he will be thoroughly at home" ("Apocalypse" 250; this brief essay con- tains the essential argument of Abrams's account of Romanti- cism in Natural Supernaturalism). 10 That irony is precisely what made Arnold reject his own poem. When he condemned "Empedocles" in the 1853 preface because "the suffering finds no vent in action" (2), he was really complaining that the poem is not sufficiently dramatic: its iro- nies are unstable since it does not exteriorize its conflicts in clearly opposing points of view; the argument remains lodged in the un- certainty between lyric and drama. "1 In Arnold and God Ruth apRoberts points out: "It is Ar- nold's refusal to systematize, to dogmatize, that makes for the splendidly British-empirical loose ends in his argument, grand inconsistencies that leave room for modern aesthetics. It is hardly to be expected of him that he should exploit his discovery in the- ory and proceed to invent William James, Susanne Langer, Witt- genstein, Logical Positivism, Vaihinger, Stevens, and the Supreme Fiction. But it is from data like Arnold's, and from attitudes like his, that all these have developed" (229). 12 In his essay on Hopkins in The Linguistic Moment Miller responds to Burke's suggestion that "The Wreck of the Deutsch- land" has something to do with the wreck of Hopkins: "The dan- ger in Burke's suggestion . . . [is] the making of literature into no more than a reflection or representation of something psy- chic that precedes it and could exist without it" (247). I think Miller misses the point here, because Burke is talking about the consequences of language in action-not about a simple or vul- gar reduction of literature to psychology.
