I9, pp. 65-73 DAVID O'CONNOR Assistant Professor of Philosophy, Seton Hall University SWINBURNE ON NATURAL EVIL I In his recent book, The Existence of God,1 Richard Swinburne argues that the world as we find it is one that a good and omnipotent God would have good reason to bring about. He does not claim to demonstrate, that is, deductively to prove, that the world is God-made but rather to show that the proposition that God exists and made the world is more likely to be true and hence more reasonable to believe, all things considered, than its negation. He recognizes that in order to sustain this position he has to justify the existence of evil, especially natural evil, or at least to reconcile both the existence and enormous quantity of such evil with the claim that God exists. In fact, however, Swinburne aims beyond mere reconciliation to the point that the existence and nature of the world (even including its evils) confirm the claim that God made it (224). Unlike most other recent contributors to the philosophical literature on God and evil, it is not so much the existence of natural evil that Swinburne regards as 'awkward' for theism as the amount of it. In his words, 'It is not the fact of evil or the kinds of evil which are the real threat to theism; it is the quantity of evil ... This is, I believe, the crux of the problem of evil' (2 I 9). If Swinburne is successful in his explanation of the existence and quantity of natural evil he will have made a major contribution to the justification of theism. That is not in dispute. But, because of the possibility that his explanation might fail, it will be useful for us to know, in advance of our examination of his position, the implications of such a failure. Should Swinburne not succeed in showing that our world, in view of its great quantity of natural evil, is one which a good and omnipotent God would have good reason to make, this would amount to his having failed to show that the world's being the way it is confirms the proposition that God exists. But, of itself, this failure would not suffice to disconfirm the proposition, for it would still be open to Swinburne to argue that, when his versions of the cosmological and teleological arguments are taken into account, the balance of probability continues to favour theism. However, if it could be established that our world is one that a good and omnipotent God would have 1 (Oxford University Press, I979.) Because all references made in this paper are to Swinburne's book I will incorporate them into my text. As it is used in this paper, the word 'God' will be understood to carry all the standard anthropomorphic connotations of traditional theism, i.e. omnipotence, omniscience, perfect goodness and so on. 3 RES I9</page><page sequence="2">66 DAVID O'CONNOR 'overriding reason' (220) not to bring about or to permit, then, in view of his explicit rejection of other possible theistic explanations of natural evil (20I-2), Swinburne's theism would have been shown to be untenable. It is just this point that, against his position, I will argue for here. In regard to natural evil the conclusions that Swinburne argues for are: (i) That the existence of natural evil is logically necessary for human beings to acquire a knowledge of good and evil sufficient for their being able to make moral choices and to become responsible for their own moral development (202-I4). and, as we have seen; (2) That a good and omnipotent God would have good reason to allow or bring about the quantity of-natural evil that exists (220). Swinburne maintains, as I mentioned earlier, that the more important, while at the same time 'awkward,' for theism of these two propositions is the second. Here, in disputing (2) and in going beyond it to argue for God's having compelling reason not to make our world, I will not develop an argument against (i), except to note that, while it may indeed be highly improbable, it is not logically impossible that human beings should become equipped with a knowledge of good and evil another way, say, innately. This is to say that in proposition (i) Swinburne appears to overstate the dependence of moral choice upon experience of natural evil. Before turning to the arguments themselves it may be worthwhile here to tidy away two peripheral points. First of all, neither from the fact that acquaintance with natural evil has a morally educational effect upon us, granting that to be a fact, nor from the further fact that natural evil may be necessary for our moral education, supposing that too to be a fact, would it follow that it is a purpose of natural evil to have this effect. Secondly, in order to avoid a possible source of ambiguity later on, we should note that even if neither natural evil nor the quantity of it which exists are necessary for moral education we cannot, on that basis alone, conclude against theism that an omnipotent God should or would have made a world entirely free of such evil. For instance, it might reasonably be argued that it would interfere intolerably with the smooth running of society for God constantly to intervene to prevent accidents and that, for this reason, a God such as Swinburne describes would not so intervene. And accidents, of course, are natural evils. Hence, in arguing against Swinburne's account of evil, I will maintain that the obligation of a good and omnipotent God, all other things being the same, is greatly to reduce, but not necessarily to eliminate, natural evil.</page><page sequence="3">SWINBURNE ON NATURAL EVIL 67 II Swinburne's arguments for (i) and (2) may be set forth as follows; that an action is morally evil on condition: (3) that somebody, say its perpetrator himself, is responsible for it, (4) that the action have evil consequences or be wrong in itself,1 (5) that its perpetrator freely elects to perform that action, knowing its consequences or nature, (6) that alternative courses of action, less evil in themselves or their consequences than the one selected, are available to him and (7) that the perpetrator knows there to be such alternatives open. On the question of how the evil-doer acquires the knowledge involved in (5) and (7), Swinburne argues: (8) that he gets this knowledge either from experience ofsimilar situations, that is, from prior acquaintance with natural evil, or through his having been told, that is, as an instance of what Swinburne calls 'verbal knowledge' (2 I I). However, even supposing that in a given case the evil-doer does indeed get his knowledge of the evil involved verbally, this would not eliminate the educational role that Swinburne identifies as belonging to natural evil. For, as his argument goes: (g) the verbal knowledge involved would itself, ultimately, be traceable to experience, to somebody's experience of evil in the world. Now (io) there had to have been a first morally evil act (207). Therefore, following (9): (Ii) the moral knowledge involved in this first act would be based, ultimately, upon natural evil. In this way Professor Swinburne concludes that: (i) natural evil is logically necessary for moral knowledge (202). Furthermore: (I2) the more data that are available for any given decision the greater the likelihood of that decision's being well-made and correct. I In general, Swinburne's account of moral value is consequentialist. See his Chapters IO and i I especially. However, his moral theory is not of primary concern here and his point about the dependence of moral choice upon acquaintance with natural evil is neutral as regards moral theories. 3-2</page><page sequence="4">68 DAVID O CONNOR Therefore, (I 3) there is a need for a great amount and variety of natural evil in the world, say the amount which there actually is, to facilitate our having wide experience of evil and hence as great an opportunity as we now have for full moral development (2 I 9-2 I). From this Swinburne concludes that: (2) there is good reason for a creator God to have made a world such as ours, that is, one containing as much natural evil as ours does (220, 224). III Let us begin our examination of Professor Swinburne's argument for (2) by asking whether a good and omnipotent God might have arranged for human beings to acquire the knowledge of good and evil necessary for moral choice in some less painful way, say through his telling them. If so, then, of course, the educational need for natural evil would have been removed. And, if a considerable amount of the natural evil in our world were indeed gratuitous, then, God's making a world containing that unnecessary evil would be incompatible with his perfect goodness. In fact, under such circumstances, a good God would have compelling reason not to bring about a world such as the present one. Let our question here now be: Is that an option available to a good and omnipotent God? As Swinburne sees it, God's providing knowledge of good and evil in this way would 'involve his saying out loud such things as "if you walk near the cliff, you will fall over", or "if you want to kill our neighbour, cyanide is very effective"' (2 II). Of course, a whisper might do just as well but the volume at which the message is communicated is not, I suppose, a major point. God's giving us verbal knowledge of evil, Swinburne argues, would have the following implications and those implications make it impossible: (I4) that God's existence would thereby be known to us, that it would, in effect, be a matter of common knowledge (21I)1 and (I5) that this, given God's omniscience and our knowledge of it, would mean that we would know that our most secret thoughts and actions (presumably, in both cases, the significant ones being evil) are entirely known to God (212). I It does not follow from our hearing a warning voice telling us, whenever we are in danger or contemplating evil, even when that voice is the voice of God, that we should thereby know or even believe the voice to be God's. However, this is not a major point and so let us suppose that to hear the voice is to know it as God's.</page><page sequence="5">SWINBURNE ON NATURAL EVIL 69 In turn this would mean, (i6) that, given our knowledge of God's justice and power, we would expect punishment for each and every such evil, together with our more overt ones, of course (ibid.) and (I 7) that this, in its turn, would rob us of the temptation to do evil (ibid.), thereby (i8) precluding our ever being in situations requiring us to make moral choices, thus robbing us of responsibility for our own destinies (ibid.). Therefore, Swinburne concludes, God, valuing moral responsibility in human beings, could not have arranged for us to acquire our knowledge of good and evil verbally. And so, assuming that the alternative, that is, God's providing us with an environment of challenges, pain and setbacks - our present world with its range of natural evils - is the only way that is compatible with our achieving moral responsibility, it is reasonable to expect God to have brought about a world such as we have. In addition, Professor Swinburne offers the following, separate argument, namely: (i9) that, in knowing God as mentioned in (I4), we would know him to be perfectly good and worshipful and hence we would not have any reason to want to displease him or ever actually to displease him, hence no reason ever to do evil (212). In effect this amounts to a version of the belief that to know what is good is to do what is good, circumstances permitting, and to know what is evil is to avoid that evil. We may call this view Plato's presupposition. But it seems to me false to claim that knowledge of goodness entails virtue. At any rate, and more to the present point, Swinburne's own position on the genuineness of moral evil presupposes our knowingly doing evil, that is, not just that knowledge of goodness is compatible with vice, although that would be sufficient to refute Plato's presupposition, but that vice entails such knowledge. Hence we may discount (i9). However, this argument is not a mainstay of Swinburne's position and so its defeat does not have serious implications. Given that Swinburne's main argument is that (2) is true because no obviously better option is available to a God valuing moral responsibility and recognizing our need to have wide experience in order adequately to decide on the many different sorts of moral questions which are likely to confront us, I will argue for the falsehood of (2) by first showing the viability of the verbal knowledge option that Swinburne dismisses. I will establish this by showing that Swinburne's chain of inference from (I 4) to (I 7) and (i 8) does</page><page sequence="6">70 DAVID O CONNOR not hold. With this done, I will argue that its being available to a good and omnipotent God to bring about a desirable state of affairs - a world of morally responsible people - by a means far less painful that that of making a world full of natural evils, makes it incumbent upon such a God to follow the route of lesser evil and that our finding, in fact, considerable unnecessary evil disconfirms Swinburne's claim that God exists. Let us grant that (I4) leads to (i6), that is, that our knowing God makes us expect (and fear) punishment for our evil doings. However, more than this follows from (I 4). We would know, in knowing God, notjust about future punishments but also, because of God's goodness and justice, that no punishment would ever be excessive and furthermore that God would abide by certain other constraints in punishing us, for instance, that there would be no reprisals against an evil-doer's innocent family and so on. We would know too that God's punishment would never take the form of denying us the enjoyment of our evil acts or the pleasures of their fruits, for that would be to deny us any rational possibility of genuine choice on moral matters, removing as it would all reason or incentive for evil-doing remaining after our loss of hope of escaping punishment. Hence we would know that a rational God who places the high value Swinburne mentions upon moral responsibility would never punish us in these ways. So, taking into account the three factors just mentioned above, we can conclude that (I 7) does not follow from ( I 4), that is, that the conjunction of' I will do this thing, knowing it to be wrong' and 'I know I will be punished for my action' can be affirmed without contradiction. Nor, in actual fact, does it fail to happen that people do things, knowing that they should not, even when they are certain of punishment. For example, not infrequently parents promise to punish a child should he perform a certain act. Let us say, for the sake of maintaining a parent-God analogy here, that the child agrees about the wrongness of the action in question and that he believes his parents' promise to punish him. Yet also, not infrequently, children defy their parents' wishes in such circumstances. However, even if they do not, the parents, by promising punishment, implicitly are acknowledging the child's freedom to choose with regard to the action in question and it is that which really is significant here. Now, to be sure, it is very likely that in many cases people who might have been contemplating doing things which they know they should not do would decide against them, when the certainty of punishment is entered into their calculations. This would result in a reduction of moral evil, but not an elimination of it for, presumably, hard-core evil-doers would still (sometimes at least) choose to carry on as before. This likely reduction of moral evil would stem from no restriction of free choice. On the contrary, it would be due to such choices, made now without the belief that escape from punishment might be possible, that is, due to moral choice based on more complete knowledge</page><page sequence="7">SWINBURNE ON NATURAL EVIL 7I than we have at present.1 So, as there is no coercion in knowledge, neither as a matter of logic nor of actual fact would knowledge of divine punishment eliminate all temptation to do evil and, taken in the context of the present argument, this is to say that (I7) does not follow from (I4) and that (I7) is false. Hence (I8) is also false. Now the net effect of the viability of God's verbal intervention would be: (a) that natural evil would not be needed to play any educational role and so, as Swinburne offers no other defence of it and indeed rejects them, could be eliminated (although, as I remarked earlier, all natural evil would not have to be eliminated by God), (b) that there would still be moral evil in the world, although, presumably, much less than at present. Consequently: (c) a good and omnipotent God, while valuing and providing for our acquisition of moral responsibility no less than Swinburne says, could have made a world with far less evil than is contained in the present one. This is to say that while (I4) does indeed entail (I 5) and (i6) these do not lead to (I7) and (I8) and that Swinburne's argument breaks down there. With the needed inference to (i8) defeated, Swinburne has no premiss from which to conclude that, other and less painful alternative worlds being unavailable to the kind of God described, (2) is true, that is, that the quantity of natural evil in the world is compatible with the goodness and power of God, or that such a God would have good reason for making such a world. But we can claim more than this. From its being available to a good and omnipotent God to facilitate moral responsibility without needing to create a world with all the evils of ours, his obligation would be that of not making our world. That is, given the availability of a world of lesser evil but no less benefit, a God such as Swinburne claims the existence of would have overriding reason to make some such alternative world, supposing it to be his intention to make a world in the first place. (In the next section I will give a more complete picture of an omnipotent and good God's possibilities ' A word about self-interest and moral choice: in the case of a potential evil-doer who decides against a particular evil act because of the punishment to follow, we would say that his reason for avoiding the action was self-interest. But this being so would not necessarily make his decision non-moral, for self-interest is a legitimate moral consideration. At any rate, choices based primarily or even exclusively on avoidance of punishment would make up only a part of the whole class of decisions on moral matters. There would also be those choices of good and against evil made for altruistic reasons, choices which there is no reason whatsoever to suppose, in the event of (I4)'s being true, could be made only for self-interested reasons. But, even if this were the only way of making them, it would not thereby disqualify them or set them beyond the justifying pale of moral theory. In brief: my point in the text that fear of punishment is not an illegitimizing factor in moral decisions neither misuses the word 'moral' nor demands the adop tion of ethical egoism.</page><page sequence="8">72 DAVID O CONNOR for bringing about a world with less evil than the present.) So, given the availability of a less evil world and Swinburne's rejection of other possible theistic explanations of natural evil, there follows, by modus tollens, from the non-existence of any such alternative world, the defeat of his defence of theism. IV In the arguments above I have followed Professor Swinburne's understanding of how transmission from God of verbal knowledge might work. There is, however, another possibility and with it a short-cut to God's creating a world containing the two desiderata at issue here, namely, moral responsibility and minimum evil. The short-cut is simply this; that an omnipotent God could bring it about that each person would be born with the knowledge of good and evil in such a way that, upon desiring something wrong or getting into danger, the appropriate warning or information would come into that person's consciousness. This would obviate the need, on Swinburne's version, for God to warn or enlighten us on a case-by-case basis. Being able to foresee all circumstances, an omniscient and omnipotent God could store in our memories all such information as we would ever need and do so with a success and efficiency never dreamed of by any mere computer programmer. Notice that no determinism is involved here; only information would be stored, not directions on actions to take. Now God could do this in either of two ways: first, by both giving to each person the knowledge in question together with the knowledge that God is the source of this information or, second, by witholding from us the knowledge of the source. In the first case the arguments of the previous section against (I 4)'s leading to ( I8) and thence to (2) apply. In the second case they do not because now proposition (14) and all that is supposed to follow from it is inapplicable. Then we would have a world in which (a) natural evil would not be needed for any educational role ... and so on as before, but in which (b) there would still, probably, be as much moral evil as in the present world. Therefore (c) as above. Now which of the alternative worlds I have described as being available that a good and omnipotent God, intent upon world-making, would be</page><page sequence="9">SWINBURNE ON NATURAL EVIL 73 obliged to choose is not a question at present before us. What does concern us, however, is a point which follows from such a God's having such options, namely, that he would have compelling reason for not making the present world. And, as mentioned earlier, it is in respect of that point that Swinburne's theism is seen to be untenable. v Theistic explanations of natural evil other than Professor Swinburne's might and, of course, have been offered. Alvin Plantinga's proposed assimilation of natural to moral evil by means of an extension of the 'free will defence' is a case in point. It does not follow from the defeat of Swinburne's account that they will suffer a similar fate. But their success or failure is a separate issue which will not be considered here.</page></plain_text>
