<plain_text><page sequence="1">Surfacing Materiality: Wordsworth, Kant and de Man's Epistemologica! Critique of Reading Tom Toremans Abstract: In the 1983 Messenger Lectures, Paul de Man set out to formulate a critique of critical philosophy and Romantic literature as dynamically involved in a post-Romantic predicament that centers around the 'philosophical phantasm' of 'the reconciliation of knowledge with phenomenal, aesthetic experience'. While critical attention has mainly focused on the shift in terminology in de Man's later writings towards linguistic materiality and aesthetic ideology, this article argues that this shift simultaneously implies a radicalisation of de Man's theory and practice of rhetorical reading into an epistemological critique of reading in terms of the incompatibility between cognition and perception, and of the material event and its inevitable reinscription into tropological linguistic models. This shift culminates in de Man's claim, in 'The Resistance to Theory', that all theory necessarily avoids the reading it advocates and contains a necessarily pragmatic moment that reinscribes it into the ideological aberration it attempts to resist. De Man's turn to Kant and Schiller in his later writings thus not only supplements his earlier rhetorical readings of Wordsworth, but also implies a radical revaluation of the act of reading that decisively repositions it towards ideology. How and where one goes on (...) is far from clear, but certainly no longer a matter of syntax and diction. Paul de Man, 'Preface' to The Rhetoric of Romanticism1 The Oxford Literary Review 33. 1 (201 1): 65-82 Edinburgh University Press DOI: 10.3366/olr.20 11.0006 © The Oxford Literary Review www.eupjournals.com/olr</page><page sequence="2">66 Oxford Literary Review 1. If, in The Resistance to Theory',2 Paul de Man defines rhetorical reading as essentially 'a negative process in which the grammatical cognition is undone, at all times, by its rhetorical displacement' (17), perhaps the most difficult challenge emerging from his later writings consists in resisting the temptation to recover rhetorical reading into a systematic negative practice that would somehow compensate for the disarticulation of reading as a cognitive act. In the conclusion of the essay, de Man unequivocally warns against such attempts at recovery. In the first place, de Man indirectly questions the very possibility of rhetorical reading by stating that readings 'that would stay clear of any undue phenomenalisation or of any undue grammatical or performative codification of the text' are 'not necessarily impossible' and are something ťfor which the aims and methods of literary theory should certainly strive'. Moreover, even if 'rhetorical readings (...) are irrefutable' and present 'the most elastic theoretical and dialectical model to end all models', they are also said to be 'defective' and to 'contain within their own defective selves all the other defective models of reading-avoidance' and are thus 'the universal theory of the impossibility of theory'. The 'impossibility of theory' in this phrase envelopes the 'universal theory' produced by rhetorical reading: to the extent 'that they are theory, that is to say teachable, generalizable and highly responsive to systematization, rhetorical readings, like the other kinds, still avoid and resist the reading they advocate.' (19) What emerges from this conclusion is an intricate economy of readability and unreadability that is very much at the centre of de Man's writings after Allegories of Reading (1979). 3 In fact, de Man's unaccomplished critique of aesthetic ideology that dominates his later writings effects an increasingly autocritical turn, centering on the question as to the epistemologica! status of his own rhetorical readings as non-cognitive disarticulating performances. The key terms of this autocritique are ideology, materiality, and the dynamic opposition between reading and reception. When, in 'The Resistance to Theory', literary theory is said 'to come into being (...) when the object of discussion is no longer the meaning or the value but the modalities of production and of reception of meaning and of value prior to their establishment' (7), 'reception' figures as the hermeneutic activity of establishing referential meaning.</page><page sequence="3">Tom Toremans 67 Yet, the Saussurian definition of the relation between the signifier and the signified as ťnot phenomenal but conventional' makes language 'epistemologically highly suspect and volatile', because of its 'considerable freedom from referential constraint', and the place where 'this negative knowledge about the reliability of linguistic utterance is made available' is literature. Rhetorical reading allows for the emergence of this 'literariness' whenever 'this autonomous potential of language can be revealed by analysis'. Literature, foregrounding the 'material, phenomenal aspects of the signifier' entails 'a strong illusion of aesthetic seduction', yet it is precisely the aesthetic function that 'has been, at the very least, suspended'. If literature thus 'involves the voiding, rather than the affirmation, of aesthetic categories' (10) and if it is 'not a priori certain that language functions according to principles which are those (...) of the phenomenal world', then it is 'not a priori certain that literature is a reliable source of information about anything but its own language'. This foregrounding of language as non- referential, non-phenomenal and radically autonomous subsequently generates a definition of ideology in terms of materiality: '[i]t would be unfortunate (...) to confuse the materiality of the signifier with the materiality of what it signifies' and 'what we call ideology is precisely the confusion of linguistic with natural reality, of reference with phenomenalism.' (11) That de Man's critique of aesthetic ideology presents a turn of sorts was already suggested by Andrzej Warminski's remark, in his introduction to the posthumously published volume on Aesthetic Ideology, that the 'definite and determinable specificity' distinguishing de Man's later essays from 'the critical-linguistic analyses in Allegories of Reading (20) consists in their focus on 'the relation of the aesthetic to epistemology.'4 The climax of this 'epistemological turn' occurs in de Man's reading of Kant, which forms the centrepiece of the Messenger Lectures he delivered at Cornell University in 1983. 5 In the first lecture on Baudelaire, the lecture series is said to focus on 'the main tenet and the major crux of all critical philosophies and "Romantic" literatures', defined as 'the continuity of aesthetic with rational judgment' (239), later rephrased as 'the seamless articulation, by way of language, of sensory and aesthetic experience with the intellectual assurance of affirmation' (2 44) and as 'the philosophical phantasm' of 'the reconciliation of knowledge with</page><page sequence="4">68 Oxford Literary Review phenomenal, aesthetic experience' (258). The eventual disarticulation of these continuities, articulations and reconciliations occurs in the emergence in Kant of 'the prosaic materiality of the letter' which 'no degree of obfuscation or ideology can transform (...) into the phenomenal cognition of aesthetic judgment.' ('Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant', 90) My main argument in what follows is that this location of an irreducible materiality at the core of the Kantian aesthetic entails an epistemological critique of reading that substantially supplements de Man's theory and practice of rhetorical reading of the 1970s. This epistemological critique involves de Man's own rhetorical counterreading in an ideologcial condition that is inherent in language and its transformation into an object of cognition. As such, it marks an ťenď of reading, in the sense that it presents both the ultimate aim of de Man's critical-linguistic analyses and their eventual saturation. Indicative of this double end is the observation that de Man's reading of Kant literally refers back to his reading of Wordsworth in 'Wordsworth and the Victorians', an essay probably written in 1979 and first published in The Rhetoric of Romanticism in 1984.6 In fact, de Man's reading of Kant reads as a rigorous continuation of the argument of this self-confessedly ťall too hasty' (92) essay. Not only does the latter provide the figures of the gaze and the (sur)face that will regulate de Man's reading of Kant, it also presents a rhetorical reading of the Wordsworthian sublime that will resurface as a counterexample in his analysis of the Kantian sublime. Between the essays, de Man moves from the 'anthropomorphism which will allow Wordsworth to address (...) the "speaking face" of nature' to Kant's ťflat, third-person world' which is said to leave 'no room for address' ('Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant', 82). What emerges from this progression is a purely material linguistic surface that comes to determine both aesthetic reception and rhetorical reading, while remaining unreadable as radically foreign to both.7 2. The argument of 'Wordsworth and the Victorians' develops as a rhetorical counterreading against the reception of Wordsworth's poetry, which, de Man argues, has since the nineteenth century occurred as a movement from 'ethical as well as aesthetic judgment, at the expense of even the slightest trace of analytic "reading" ' (83) to</page><page sequence="5">Tom Toremans 69 twentieth-century phenomenological close readings. This movement failed to deliver the comfort of historical or cognitive progression, since Victorian and modern critics alike were primarily guided by warding off the threat posed by Wordsworth's language, which appeared to come 'from a region in which the most carefully drawn distinctions between analytic rigor and poetic persuasion are no longer preserved, at no small risk for either.' Trying to state why this is so', de Man continues, 'is to suggest an alternative to the canonical reading which has dominated the interpretation of Wordsworth from Victorian to modern times.' (85) The first part of de Man's argument rehearses the main tenets of Wordsworth's canonical reception. Victorian didacticism addressed the threat inherent in Wordsworth's elusive diction by dénégation, for example in Leslie Stephen's designation of his poetry as protective from 'anxieties that threaten life and reason' (85) and Matthew Arnold's subsequent protest against this moral philosophical celebration, confining Wordsworth to the realm of aesthetic delight. The shift to twentieth-century phenomenological and existential readings occurred as a reformulation of this threat in terms of a self- reflecting consciousness and its triumph over its own undoing, legible in Wordsworth's poetry as 'the absolute refusal to cope with the powers of negation otherwise than by the rigorous acknowledgment of their manifestation, be it as phenomenal, natural event or as affect.' (86) Accordingly, the power of the self-reflecting consciousness was turned into 'the resilience of the Wordsworthian sublime as a power of pure mind.' From this phenomenological perspective, the 'miracle of Wordsworth's figurai diction' resides in its 'refusal to make any concession to notions of sensory experience' (86) and in its intériorisation of 'the totality of the phenomenal world of sky and earth', a double agency whose subliminal affirmation of the 'power of pure mind' hinges on the simultaneous renunciation and recovery of the aesthetic: while Wordsworth's language is marked by a 'matter-of- factness' and 'some of the flattest lines of which the English language is capable' and thus renounces aesthetic ornament, it at the same time recovers the aesthetic as a principle of articulation of language and natural event. If Wordsworth's poetry thus 'recovers the aesthetic in the process of its refusal' (87), the key critical gesture informing his reception is that of inscribing his figurai diction into an aesthetic model</page><page sequence="6">70 Oxford Literary Review of language, in which 'aesthetic' means the articulation of verbal with natural reality so as to secure the former as phenomenal representation of the latter. De Man's rhetorical counterreading subsequently proceeds from the location in Wordsworth's poetry of two incompatible linguistic models and their resistance to integration into such an aesthetic scheme of linguistic representation. Indicative of this resistance is the simultaneous presence in Wordsworth's poetry of lexical units (such as 'hangs') that reveal ťa remarkably consistent pattern' to the extent of providing a 'full-fledged theory of metaphor as suspended meaning, as loss and restoration of the principle of analogy beyond sensory experience' (89), on the one hand, and others (such as 'sense') that elude such a tropological linguistic model and thus verge on meaninglessness on the other. Conditioning the phenomenalisation of the figure in Wordsworth's poetry, then, is the disarticulation of a tropological model of language which is not in itself thematically available, since it is precisely the disruption of reading as a cognitive act based on a congruity between language and sensory perception that is at stake. At the centre of de Man's rhetorical reading is precisely the disarticulation of this congruity, legible in the figure of the 'speaking face'. Quoting Book V of The Prelude , 'my mind hath look'd/ Upon the speaking face of heaven and earth', de Man immediately counters an anthropomorphic reading that would reduce the 'speaking face' to 'the locus of speech, the necessary condition for the existence of articulated language' (89), and instead stages it as a product of figuration ('[m]an (...) has a face only because he partakes of a mode of discourse that is neither entirely natural nor entirely human'). The lines emphatically do not present a dialogue between mind and nature but 'a mute scene of looking, the mind gazing upon a speaking face.' The 'speaking face' thus figures language in a passage that 'designates a prior encounter of which the (...) later exchanges between men are derived' because '[o]ne can speak only because one can look upon a mode of speech which is not quite our own.' Read as a figuration of language, the lines thus rhetorically substitute 'speaking' with 'looking' as irreducibly prior to the former. Staging the opening lines of Book II ('Blessed the infant babe') as 'Wordsworth's essay on the origins of language as poetic language', de Man subsequently dwells on the absence of the 'face' in</page><page sequence="7">Tom Toremans 71 these lines, an absence all the more remarkable because of the emphatic appearance of the 'eye' as the unexpected displacement of the mother's breast: The Babe, Nurs'd in his Mother's arms, the Babe who sleeps Upon his Mother's breast, who, when his soul Claims manifest kindred with an earthly soul, Doth gather passion from his Mother's eye! (90) The exchange of gazes between the child and the mother occurs not as ťa shared awareness of common humanity', but as 'an active verbal deed, a claim of "manifest kindred" which is not given in the nature of things.' (91) 'Face', in other words, is both the necessary condition for language and a product of language, a figure.8 The child's 'gathering passion' from his mother's eye occurs not as a natural event, but as the construction of the figure of the face, which functions as a linguistic performance (a verbal claim) on which all subsequent processes of totalisation are modelled: It is clear that what is being described is the possibility of inscribing the eye, which is nothing by itself, into a larger, total entity, the 'same object' which, in the internal logic of the text, can only be the face, the face as combination of parts which the mind, working like a synecdochal trope, can lay claim to - thus opening the way to a process of totalization which, in the span of a few lines, can grow to encompass everything, ' All objects through all intercourse of sense.' Language originates with the ability of the eye to establish the contour, the borderline, the surface which allows things to exist in the identity of the kinship of their distinction from other things. (91) De Man subsequently juxtaposes two other occurrences of the 'face', in which the totalising power of the second 'is shown at work in a process of endless differentiation correctly called perpetual "logic", of which it is said that it "Could find no surface where its power might sleep".' De Man concludes that</page><page sequence="8">72 Oxford Literary Review [t]he face, which is the power to surface from the sea of infinite distinctions in which we risk to drown, can find no surface. How are we to reconcile the meaning of face, with its promise of sense and of filial preservation, with its fonction as the relentless undoer of its own claims? (92) The question as to the reconciliation of the meaning and the function of Wordsworth's 'face' is a rhetorical one, since it is precisely their radical incompatibility that turns Wordsworth into a paradigmatic post-Romantic text. If Wordsworth's diction depends for its meaningfulness on a tropological model of language, it also allegorically accounts for its own functioning against the aesthetic claims of the trope. Wordsworth's reception occurs as the succession of confrontations with this performative disarticulation of tropological linguistic models and the subsequent defensive evasion of it in aesthetic terms: Victorian as well as contemporary Wordsworth criticism have in fact always responded to linguistic complexities of this kind, and, as is inevitable, they built their defences against them in ethical and aesthetic terms. It would be naïve to believe that we could ever face Wordsworth, a poet of sheer language, outright. But it would be more naïve still to think that we can take shelter from what he knew by means of the very evasions which this knowledge renders impossible. (92) De Man's counterreading thus elicits from Wordsworth's poetry the performative linguistic event of position that, as an act that precedes and eludes metaphorisation, is radically distinct from and incompatible with a tropological linguistic model. While it is all too easy - in fact inevitable - to read this performance erroneously in anthropomorphic terms (as the act of the poet, rather than of language), it is also dangerously naïve to think that the performative is simply the negation of the tropological and allows for a nihilistic reading of Wordsworth's poetry. Instead, the tropological and the performative linguistic models in Wordsworth's poetry stand in a relation of radical incompatibility and cannot possibly be translated into each other.</page><page sequence="9">Tom Toremans 73 What de Man's reading does leave us with, however, is the impossibility of facing 'Wordsworth, a poet of sheer language, outright'. In its programmatic hastiness, this phrase actually anticipates de Man's later reading of Kant, which can be read as a sustained effort to scrutinise this impossibility in epistemological terms. To be sure, 'Wordsworth and the Victorians' does allow this surface to emerge, namely as that which somehow remains 'outside' the passage from trope to performance and that effects the sheerly linguistic conflict in the first place. De Man's rhetorical reading of Wordsworth in terms of the disjunction of language and sensory perception indeed stages Wordsworth's poetry as an allegory, not only of reading as such, but also of a materialisation of language into non-phenomenological surface that resists cognitive recovery and that remains silently posited, as it were, in between its tropological phenomenalisation and the performative disarticulation of this aesthetic gesture. It is the autocritical turn towards this linguistic surface and its resistance to reading that to an important extent drives de Man's reading of the Kantian sublime - as if the mute gaze on 'the face of earth and heaven' is turned towards the surface of language itself. 3. In 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant', his most elaborate reading of Kant,9 de Man locates at the center of the Critique of Judgment 'a deep, perhaps fatal, break or discontinuity', in that it 'depends on a linguistic structure (language as a performative as well as a cognitive system) that is not itself accessible to the powers of transcendental philosophy.' The burden of the essay is to localise more precisely 'where this disruption (...) becomes apparent in the text' - emphatically not 'as an explicit paradox' but as 'the apparently tranquil, because entirely unreflected juxtaposition of incompatibles.' (79) This disarticulation of the continuity between language and transcendental philosophy occurs in the emergence of 'material vision' at the precise moment in the third Critique when one would have expected the emergence of 'a phenomenalised, empirically manifest principle' which would provide the necessary causal link between 'a purely conceptual and an empirically determined discourse' (73) that would ultimately guarantee the architectonic unity of Kant's transcendental philosophy. Instead of providing this empirically manifest principle, however, sublime vision</page><page sequence="10">74 Oxford Literary Review ends up as 'purely material' and 'purely formal' (83) in the concluding section of the 'Analytic of the Sublime': If, then, we call the sight of the starry heaven sublime, we must not place at the foundation of our judgment concepts of worlds inhabited by rational beings and regard the bright points, with which we see the space above us filled, as their suns moving in circles purposively fixed with reference to them; but we must regard it, just as we see it [wie man ihn sieht' , as a distant, all-embracing vault [ein weites Gewölbe ]. Only under such a representation can we range that sublimity that a pure aesthetic judgment ascribes to this object. And in the same way, if we are to call the sight of the ocean sublime, we must not think of it as we ordinarily do, as implying all kinds of knowledge (...)• To find the ocean (...) sublime, we must regard it as poets do [wie die Dichter es tun], merely by what the eye reveals [was der Augenschein zeigt' - if it is at rest, as a clear mirror of water only bounded by the heavens; if it is stormy, as an abyss threatening to overwhelm everything. (80) Indicative of the far-reaching consequences of this passage for the theorisation of reading is that de Man's analysis proceeds by radically differentiating it from his rhetorical reading of the Wordsworthian sublime. Observing that ť[i]t is easier to say what the passage excludes and how it differs from others than to say what it is', de Man enumerates what Kant's architectonic vision is not like, which generates a threefold reference to Wordsworth. Kant's vision, firstly, is not like the nest-robbing episode in The Prelude because the latter still associates the destabilised sky (ťThe sky was not a sky/Of earth, and with what motion moved the clouds!') with shelter whereas Kant's poet who sees the heavens 'does not see in order to shelter himself and 'the link between seeing and dwelling (...) is teleological and therefore absent in pure aesthetic vision' (81-82). Neither is it like the 'sense sublime' of the 'round ocean' of 'Tintern Abbey', because 'Wordsworth's sublime is an instance of (...) the chiasmic transfer of properties between the sensory and the intellectual world that characterizes his figurai diction' and 'no mind is involved in the Kantian vision'. And, thirdly,</page><page sequence="11">Tom Toremans 75 'Kant's architectonic world is not a metamorphosis (...)&gt; nor (...) a trope or a symbol that substitutes for the actual entities' and, consequently, it is 'previous to any understanding, to any exchange or anthropomorphism which will allow Wordsworth to address (...) the "speaking face" of nature.' (82) If Kant's philosophical designation of the materiality of aesthetic vision is thus said to occur before Wordsworth's anthropomorphised face, how should this difference between Wordsworth and Kant be understood? This question forces de Man's argument in 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant' into a final phase that substantially complements the argument of 'Wordsworth and the Victorians'. If Kant's material vision presents ťthe apparently tranquil, because entirely unreflected juxtaposition of incompatibles' (79), the passage in which it emerges itself stands in a relation of incompatibility to another paragraph in the third Critique , namely to the section on the eventual articulation of imagination with reason that would achieve the phenomenal representation of the sublime. The initial terror ( Verwunderung ) generated by the sublime is domesticated into a feeling of tranquil superiority ( Bewunderung ) through the harmonious cooperation between pure reason and the imagination. By means of an avowedly 'uninspired (...) paraphrase' of this articulation as the tragic sacrifice of the imagination to pure reason, de Man observes that this sacrifice presents us with 'a story, a dramatized scene of the mind in action', an anthropomorphisation of the faculties turning the latter into tropes in allegorical scenes of sacrifice that 'are not actually descriptions of mental functions but descriptions of tropological transformations.' What makes this uncontrollable intrusion of the tropological remarkable is that it stands 'almost in juxtaposition to the passage on the material architectonics of vision, (...) with which it is entirely incompatible.' (87) The allegorical tale of the sacrifice of the imagination thus occurs as a reinscription of material vision into a tropological linguistic model that would resuscitate the irreversible materiality of the Kantian architectonic. At the heart of Kant's critical enterprise is located a double designation of the architectonic, in which the first version - the non-teleological, non-tropological, non-Wordsworthian, material 'building' of nature - is offset against the organic definition of the architectonic in the chapter on 'The Architectonics of Pure Reason'</page><page sequence="12">76 Oxford Literary Review (in the first Critique) as 'the unity of miscellaneous cognitions brought together under one idea'. (87) The confrontation of both versions occurs as one between the organic metaphor of the unity of modes of cognition as a body of articulated limbs that grows from the inside in, on the one hand, and the materiality of the sublime vision of the ocean and the heavens, on the other. In the final instance, then, the emergence of material vision in the third Critique marks not only the material disarticulation of sublime nature and its linguistic representation, but also of language itself as an organic and articulated body: ť[t]o the dismemberment of the body corresponds a dismemberment of language, as meaning-producing tropes are replaced by the fragmentation of sentences and propositions into discrete words, or the fragmentation of words into syllables or finally letters.' (89) The dismemberment of language ends in ťthe prosaic materiality of the letter and no degree of obfuscation or ideology can transform this materiality into the phenomenal cognition of aesthetic judgment.' (90) The location of this linguistic materiality prior to ideology and cognitive transformation marks a point of saturation in de Man's critique of reading, beyond which it is impossible to transgress without falling into the trap of reinscribing the material event into aesthetic ideology. At several instances de Man himself hints at this saturation and its epistemological impact on reading. In the first place, the notion of 'materiality' is itself introduced in an emphatically catachrestic mode: 'materiality' is 'the only word that comes to mind', to which de Man adds that 'how this materiality is to be understood in linguistic terms is not, as yet, clearly intelligible.' (82) Linguistic materiality, in other words, radically eludes theoretical recuperation to the extent that it precedes the (dis) articulation of meaning as such and is not linguistically available beyond the singular acts of rhetorical reading that allow it to emerge. Secondly, de Man explicitly introduces this linguistic materiality as supplementing the dynamic between tropological and performative linguistic models in his further differentiation between Wordsworth and Kant. Both in Wordsworth's 'speaking face' and in Kant's allegory of the sacrifice of the imagination, 'we encountered a passage (...) that could be identified as (...) a shift from trope to performance.' Importantly, however, the emergence of the 'material' model involves 'a somewhat different pattern'. (89) The difference between Wordsworth and Kant in this deManian scheme of</page><page sequence="13">Tom Toremans 77 passages is indicative of a shift from imposition to juxtaposition. The Wordsworthian text presented an incisive critique of the tropological model as depending on a violent, performative act of imposition that eludes the anthropomorphic totalisation of tropological substitution. If this incompatibility between two linguistic models left: us with the unattainable surface of Wordsworth's poetic diction, what emerges in Kant is the materiality of this surface, the actual and historical locus of the passage from trope to performance. From imposition to juxtaposition, de Man's emphasis shifts from violent intervention to the tranquil opposition of incompatibles. Preceding the dynamic between phenomenalist and rhetorical reading (or 'reception' and 'reading'), then, Kant's material vision marks a moment of radical arrest of this dynamic: the linguistic materiality emerging from the Kantian aesthetic is poised between the passage from tropological to performative linguistic models as the material surface that is 'passed over' and on which both reading and reception operate without ever recovering it. An alternative formulation of this location of linguistic materiality as prior to the dynamic between trope and performance is suggested by de Man's rephrasing of his reading of Kant in 'Kant and Schiller', the lecture delivered two days after 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant'. Significantly, de Man formulates as the central topic of the previous lecture 'the question of reversibility (...) in the type of models which I have been developing on the basis of texts', which is actually 'the question of historicity'. In his recapitulation of the emergence of materiality in the Kantian aesthetic, de Man rehearses his conclusion of the previous lecture, yet with a marked emphasis on the exact location of history, not in performance itself, but in the materiality it allows to emerge: [T]he linguistic model I am describing, and which is irreversible, is the model of the passage from trope, which is a cognitive model, to the performative, for example. Not the performative in itself - because the performative in itself exists independently of tropes and exists independently of a critical examination or of an epistemological examination of tropes - but the transition, the passage from a conception of language as a system (...) of tropes, that totalizes</page><page sequence="14">78 Oxford Literary Review itself as a series of transformations which can be reduced to tropological systems, and then the fact that you pass from that conception of language to another conception of language in which language is no longer cognitive but in which language is performative. (132) The emergence of a radical and irreducible materiality in Kant prohibits the establishment of a historical or dialectical progression of any kind between the tropological, the performative and the ťmateriaT: just as none of the models can be translated back into the language of cognition, neither of them can account for itself and/or for the other, and it is precisely this failure of accounting that marks the respective shifts from one mode to the other as truly historical. In order to specify further this intricately non-temporal notion of history, de Man rephrases it in terms of a distinction between reversal and relapse. If the epistemology of tropes 'allows for a (. . .) transcendental critical discourse (...) to emerge' and subsequently saturates itself and passes to another linguistic model ('for example - though there are other possibilities - [the] performative'), it presents an irreversible process that will nevertheless end in a reinscription of this disarticulated trope into a cognitive system. Although this is another version of the juxtaposition of linguistic models in 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant', de Man here muses on the difference between the notions of reinscription (recuperation, relapse) and reversal: That relapse, however, is not the same as a reversal. Because this is in its turn open to a critical discourse similar to the one that has taken one from the notion of trope to that of the performative. So it is not a return to the notion of trope and to the notion of cognition; it is equally balanced between both, and equally poised between both, and as such is not a reversal, it's a relapse. (133) The passage from trope to performance does not occur through negation (ť[t]he performative is not a negation of the tropological' (133)) but as a unidirectional movement from one linguistic model to the other. As such it is always already open to a critical discourse that saturates the tropology it aspires to address epistemologicallyģ 'That,'</page><page sequence="15">Tom Toremans 79 de Man affirms, 'is history' and he adds that 'it doesn't allow for any reinscription of history into any kind of cognition'. (134) The actual historical event, in other words, is the emergence of a linguistic materiality in the passage from trope to performance - a materiality that regulates this passage and makes it irreversible, yet that as such also remains unreadable to the extent that it is only available in the passage from reception to reading, while resisting transformation into the object of either. 4. From the Wordsworthian to the Kantian sublime, de Man's critique of aesthetic ideology turns from the rhetorical disarticulation of the congruity between language and natural event to the linguistic materiality that is prior to the establishment of meaning and its performative undoing. What eventually emerges from this progression is a material event that occurs as a radical arrest of the dynamic between phenomenalist reading and rhetorical counterreading, as a moment when this dynamic is frozen into a mute gaze upon a sheerly linguistic surface. In this movement, rhetorical reading is disjoined not only from cognition - which it repetitively undoes as the aspiration of phenomenalist readings - but from sensory perception as such. Both as a phenomenalist and as a rhetorical process, reading acts upon a non-phenomenal, purely formal, sheerly linguistic surface by which it is preceded and that is radically foreign to it to the extent that it is prior to the production and undoing of meaning. While it might be tempting thus to conceive of this materiality as 'pre-ideologicaT, it is only available in and through singular acts of rhetorical reading which, from the moment that they aspire to generalisation and systematicity, inevitably (albeit negatively) participate in aesthetic ideology as an ideology of readability. While linguistic materiality is posited prior to aesthetic ideology, it remains radically unreadable as the purely material object of sensory perception that resists cognitive transformation - the latter starting from the very moment when the most minimal meaning is attributed to this sheerly linguistic surface. De Man's critique of aesthetic ideology thus entails an epistemology of reading which is based on an irreversible disarticulation of the congruity between aesthetics and epistemology, sensory perception and cognition. This end of reading (both in the sense of the aim and the saturation of</page><page sequence="16">80 Oxford Literary Review the rhetorical undoing of reading as a cognitive process) forces de Man's own theoretical argument - which always occurs as a rhetorical reading - into a decisively autocri tical turn as it finds itself confronted with an event that is radically unreadable, yet that regulates the reading it inspires. In this sense, de Man's remark that to the extent that they become theory rhetorical readings 'avoid and resist the reading they advocate' does not present us with an explicit paradox. Instead, in the terms of cPhenomenality and Materiality in Kant', it involves rhetorical reading in a 'tranquil juxtaposition' with linguistic materiality which always functions as the irretrievable surface around which the dynamic between tropological reading and its performative undoing hovers. De Man's critique of aesthetic ideology thus relentlessly returns reading to the mute gaze upon a linguistic surface that simultaneously conditions and resists this reading. In this sense, he has to be faced as a theoretician of sheer language, although it will always be naive to believe that this facing could either bypass singular acts of reading or take shelter from this epistemological unreadability by means of the very evasions which this unreadability renders impossible.

In the remainder of the introduction de Man subtly indicates the dangers of such optimism in a way that anticipates the conclusion of The Resistance to Theory'. 4 Andrzej Warminski, 'Introduction: Allegories of Reference' in Aesthetic Ideology , edited by Andrzej Warminski (Minneapolis, Minnesota University Press, 1996), 1-33 (p. 21). 5 The six Messenger Lectures were: 'Anthropomorphism and Trope in Baudelaire' (published as 'Anthropomorphism and Trope in the Lyric' in The Rhetoric of Romanticism , 239-62), 'Kleist's Über das Marionettentheater (published as 'Aesthetic Formalization: Kleist's Über das Marionettentheater in The Rhetoric of</page><page sequence="17">Tom Toremans 81 Romanticism , 263-90), 'Hegel on the Sublime' (published in Aesthetic Ideology , 105-18), 'Pheno menali ty and Materiality in Kanť (published m Aesthetic Ideology, 70-90), 'Kant and Schiller' (published as edited transcript in Aesthetic Ideology , 129-62) and 'Conclusions' (published as '"Conclusions": Walter Benjamin's "The Task of the Translator'" in The Resistance to Theory , 73-105). For critical commentaries on de Man's critique of aesthetic ideology, see especially the essays included in Material Events. Paul de Man and the Afterlife of Theory , edited by Tom Cohen, Barbara Cohen, J. Hillis Miller and Andrzej Warminski (Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 2001) and Legacies of Paul de Man , edited by Marc Redfield (New York, Fordham University Press, 2007). For a commentary on de Man's critique of aesthetic ideology (and its relation to Derrida) which provides an alternative reading of his analyses of Wordsworth and Kant in terms of irony, see Tom Toremans, 'Disagreement as (Possible) Event: Derrida contre de Man' in Contre Derrida : Countering the Contemporary Critique of Deconstruction, edited by Allison Weiner and Simon Morgan Wortham (New York and London, Continuum, 2007), 82-94. 6 Paul de Man, 'Wordsworth and the Victorians' in The Rhetoric of Romanticism, 83-92. For a close reading of the essay's argument, see Neil Hertz's 'Lurid Figures' (in Reading de Man Reading, edited by Lindsay Waters and Wlad Godzich (Minneapolis, University of Minnesota Press, 1989), 82-104). Hertz characterizes the essay as 'either an intense trial run or a rapid glance over hard-won ground, both sketchier and more abrupt than the other (...) essays in its deployment of similar arguments and figures' (83), and 'as a more developed companion piece to (...) "Shelley Disfigured'" (91). It is interesting in this respect to note de Man's remark in the preface to The Rhetoric of Romanticism that the latter essay is 'the only place where I come close to facing some of these problems about history and fragmentation' and he significantly adds: '[h]ow and where one goes on from there is far from clear, but certainly no longer simply a matter of syntax and diction', (ix) 7 My argument takes its cue from Andrzej Warminski's compelling designation of materiality as radically foreign to the 'system of truth, virtue, and understanding' and its economy of tropological and performative linguistic models in his ' "As the Poets Do It": On the Material Sublime' (in Material Events, 3-31). De Man's rhetorical reading, according to Warminski, can indeed be considered as partly based on the repeated demonstration of the disjunction of tropological and performative linguistic models, yet this systematic passage from trope to performance is always conditioned by the formal materialism emerging from the Kantian sublime, which 'is very explicitly not to be identified with the</page><page sequence="18">82 Oxford Literary Review performative' (25). My argument further develops the consequences of this location of materiality for de Man's epistemologica! critique of reading. 8 On de Man's analysis of the figure of the face, see - apart from Hertz's 'Lurid Figures' - Cynthia Chase's 'Giving a Face to a Name. De Man's Figures' in Decomposing Figures: Rhetorical Readings in the Romantic Tradition (Baltimore and London, Johns Hopkins University Press, 1986), 82-1 12. 9 A shorter version of the argument developed in 'Phenomenality and Materiality in Kant' is provided in the lecture on 'Kant's Materialism', delivered at the MLA convention of 1981 and also included in Aesthetic Ideology (1 19-28). Already in this lecture de Man uses Wordsworth as a counterexample to elucidate Kant's material vision, claiming that 'Kant is as remote as possible from Wordsworth's mind looking "upon the speaking face of earth and heaven" '.
