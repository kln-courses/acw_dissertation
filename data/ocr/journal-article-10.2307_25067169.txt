<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Borderland Colloquy: Altar Q, Copan, Honduras Adam Herring In the mid-eighth century CE, the Maya polity of Copan, Honduras, was the richest urban center in the hill country to the southeast of Guatemala's Motagua River. The shrines, palaces, and burial structures of Copan's royal architectural complex, the Acropolis, rose nearly one hundred and fifty feet off the floor of the Copan river valley. In the dry season of 775-76, the dynasty's sixteenth ruler, K'inich Yax Pasaj Chan Yoaat, "Great Sun, First / Blue-Green Dawn, Sky God" (hereafter Yax Pasaj), enacted rituals marking the renovation and expansion of an ancestral dynastic shrine at the center of the Acropolis.1 Now known as Structure 10L-16 (Structure 16), the building was the burial place and memorial shrine of the ancestral founder of Cop?n's ruling dynasty (Fig. 1). The ritual actions performed before the newly refurbished struc ture included the interment of macaw feathers, obsidian blades, and at least fourteen jaguars in a cache buried be neath the fresh stucco of the plaza floor. A stone monument was set directly above, a table altar worked with bold figurai relief and a lengthy hieroglyphic text.2 This monumental object is now recognized in the literature of Maya studies as Copan Altar Q (Figs. 2-7) .3 Placed as a ritual set piece before Structure 16's monumen tal staircase, Altar Q served quite specific ceremonial func tions associated with this mortuary shrine. Though the mon ument's role in dynastic rituals of ancestor veneration remains uncertain, it seems likely that Altar Q operated as a pedestal for the display of god effigies or ritual offerings, or perhaps as a ritual seat or throne for a living actor. This essay is addressed to the dynastic rhetoric Altar Q embodied rather than its precise ritual function, exploring the visual devices by which Altar Q articulated in its text and image a complex sense of the now and the now past. Altar Q braided the quickening rhetoric of ritual performance with the sculptural language of the monumental relic to fashion a highly partic ular construct of history and viewing experience, reading and bodily encounter. A detailed synchronie analysis of Altar Q and its relation to the cultural life of the late-eighth-century Copanec leadership casts the work in the round, as sculptural, and urbanistic monument, as historiographie schema, and as a benchmark in the cultural landscape of ancient western Honduras. In characterizing Altar Q as a borderland colloquy, I orient my discussion to two poles of interest. The first consists of the place of the Copan Acropolis within the cultural landscape of ancient western Honduras: among the bosses and trading chiefs of lower Mesoamerica's tierra templada, Cop?n's dynasty of "lowland Maya" rulers were actors in a borderland cultural mosaic of negotiated identities and local microhistories of prestige. The ruler of the Copan Acropolis did not stand aloof from the traffic of culture and power along the edges of the lowland Maya sphere; rather, Altar Qwas a product of this traffic. Like so many other monuments placed by the rulers of Copan, Altar Q boasts the challenging anomaly of a work that stated its patrons' alliance with the lowland Maya prac tices of dynastic rulership yet also effected the misprision and redeployment ofthat tradition's visual rhetoric and norms of monumental expression. This slippage of cultural represen tation was a result of Copan's position in the cultural border land: the Honduran uplands. Secondly, to thematize the Copanec leadership's cultural transactions and program matic ambitions within this historical context, I draw from the organizing figurai motif along Altar Q's sides: the collo quy. Altar Q reiterated the proprietary narrowness of the local Copanec dynastic tradition, but it appealed as well to the wider cultural life of council and colloquy along Me soamerica's southern borderlands. The monument's icono graphie preoccupations and its realization of space and place turned on the cultural suggestiveness of conversation and interpersonal exchange; further, as a context and occasion of performative ?lan, the colloquy aptly conveys Altar Q's efforts to set the Copanec leadership in communication with their Honduran clients, their supernatural patrons, and the dynas tic legacy of the monument's site of emplacement. Altar Q: Description, Historiographie Position Altar Q may be described as an ensemble of five carved stones. A block of greenish tuff about three feet (one meter) long on each side constitutes the monument's principal com ponent; the main block's squared, horizontal form is sup ported by four cylindrical stone supports at the monument's corners. An inscription of thirty-six glyph blocks appears in a six-by-six grid across the altar's flat upper surface. This text relates the dedication of the monument in 775-76 CE (De cember 25, 775 to February 27, 776) and cites a set of historical and ritual events that predated and prepared this ritual act. A square frame encloses the inscription, forming the main block's quadrangular contour. On the block's four vertical sides, a figurai frieze runs below the squared upper lip. Together, the block's four sides bear a string of seated figures around the object's entire circumference. These seated males are costumed in turban headdresses, earflares, collars, and pectorals; in their right hands they hold scepters or fanlike implements. On all but Altar Q's west side, these figures are unified in right (north side) or left (east and south side) profile. Each of Altar Q's figures sits on a Maya hieroglyph, as if enthroned on a supporting cushion; here and there, legs casually dangle over a basal glyph. On the remaining side, originally the monument's west and frontal face, two pairs of opposing figures face inward toward each other across a two-glyph text: 6 Caban 10 Mol (June 28, 763 CE). The four supports below the main block also bore carving, now spalled beyond precise recognition (Fig. 8).4 Under the aegis of the Instituto Hondureno de Antropolog?a</page><page sequence="2">1 Structure lOL-16, Copan, seen from the West Court, Copan Acropolis; a cast reproduction of Altar Q is visible before the staircase (photo: author) 2 Altar Q Copan, view to east and south sides.

Altar Q was removed to the Museo de Escultura de Copan in the late 1990s, where it is on view today.5 Few monuments of New World antiquity have been the subject of more sustained interest and reinterpretation than Altar Q. In part, the monument shares this historiographie prominence with the larger Copanec carving tradition. Over the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, monumental sculptures recovered from Copan were among the earliest, most persuasively documented, and most carefully studied of any Maya artworks then extant.6 Indeed, in North America and Europe, scholarly and public awareness of ancient Maya art was largely built around the equation of "Copan" with "ancient Maya." Altar Q received special notice and comment in this literature. Explorer John Lloyd Stephens's accounts of travel to Central American ruins ran into multiple editions in the early 1840s; Stephens remarked that Altar Q presented "as curious a subject of speculation as any monument in Copan."7 The figures on the object's sides attracted special commentary: The figures all have breastplates, and one of the two principal characters holds in his hand an instrument, which may, perhaps, be considered a sceptre. Each of the others holds an object which can be only a subject for speculation and conjecture. It may be a weapon of war,</page><page sequence="3">195 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 3 Altar Q, Copan, west side (photo: author) 4 Altar Q, Copan, detail of west side: K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' (founder) opposite K'inich Yax Pasaj Chan Yoaat (sixteenth ruler of Copan) (photo: author) and, if so, it is the only thing of the kind found repre sented at Copan. In other countries, battle-scenes, war riors, and weapons of war are among the most prominent subjects of sculpture; and from the entire absence of them here there is reason to believe that the people were not warlike, but peaceable, and easily subdued.8 While uncertain of his impressions, Stephens perceived that the object's purposes appeared to defy the martial logic that was otherwise an ordinary component in the artistic reper toire of so many other ancient civilizations. From the time of Stephens's early description, Altar Q like most of the works at Copan, seemed to announce an ancient realm where re</page><page sequence="4">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 10,7 finement trumped militarism, and a highly particular logic of the aesthetic gave little scope for the workaday arts of vio lence. By the end of the nineteenth century, casts of Copan sculpture would be placed in museums alongside vigorously sanguinary reliefs from Assyrian palaces and Greek temples.9 Altar Q and other Copanec works were among the keystones of the soft primitivism of "calendar priests" and pacifist "as tronomer kings" that dominated twentieth-century scholar ship on the ancient Maya from the 1920s onward.10 By the mid-twentieth century, Western observers came to extol the "serenity and dignity" and "emotional magnificence" of Co panec monumental art, recognizing this visual corpus as both fully representative of the larger Maya tradition's finest am bitions and exemplary of its greatest achievements.11 In 1924, Mayanist Herbert Spinden argued that Altar Q's figurai frieze presents "a conference of calendar priests."12 Scholars of the time were able to decipher calendrical pas sages in Maya inscriptions, but little else, and Spinden and his colleagues were keenly aware of the extraordinary intricacies implicit in the Maya calendar. Accordingly, Spinden orga nized his interpretation of Altar Q around the epigraphic facility of his day, arguing that the monument commemo rated a conference held among Maya intellectuals and cos mographers to determine the proper reckoning of time and the calendar. Spinden's reading of Altar Q won broad play in scholarly circles for some decades: Robert Redfield, the Uni versity of Chicago's influential exponent of comparativist archaeological theory, specifically brought forward Copan Altar Qas a totem for the ancient Maya cities' advanced state of civilization, and as an exemplar of civilization more gen erally: "the complex conceptions of the literati," wrote Red field of Altar Q, "now reach far beyond anything of which the rustic could conceive."13 Of the monumental art of Copan, Aldous Huxley wrote, "One feels suddenly at home, on famil iar emotional ground."14 To the present, archaeologists and art historians acknowl edge the visual work produced in the Copan Acropolis as Mesoamerican art in its fullness, "the Classic Maya style."15 In a tradition of archaeological scholarship that judges artistic style as a prime indicator of "the condition of civilization," the monumental art of Copan has helped to accord the Maya a place at the high table of ancient and non-European civi lizations.16 True to the suggestive phrase "Copan Acropolis," the Copanec polity is generally described in archaeological writings as the "Athens of the New World," a "high church" bastion and outpost of Maya civilization among the lesser chieftains of the surrounding Honduran uplands.17 In terms of contemporary archaeological theory of civiliza tion and civilizations, Copan was taken to exemplify a "Great Tradition" sweeping western Honduras's folk traditions be fore it. The city was portrayed as a successfully established outpost of "advanced [lowland] Maya culture," where else where among the lowlands' mountainous peripheries?in highland Chiapas and the low mountains of Belize?the low land Maya culture had attained only "precarious lodgment."18 Their arguments presented Copan 's role in the Honduran uplands as an instance of an advanced nation encountering lesser tribes in the course of territorial expansion.19 In the closing decades of the twentieth century, new hiero glyphic decipherments significantly altered scholarly under 5 Altar Q Copan, detail of west side: fifteenth ruler of Copan (photo: author) standing of Altar Q's thematic preoccupations. Sweeping and conclusive epigraphic and archaeological reinterpretation showed that the inscription on Altar Q's upper surface pro vides an account of the Copan dynasty's founding in the early fifth century CE, as well as rituals of dynastic veneration performed at the altar in the 770s. The monument's inscrip tion, so epigraphic scholarship shows, ties the deeds of Altar Q's eighth-century patron to the founding of the Copanec dynasty in the early fifth century CE by a personage identified as K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo,' "Great Sun, First / Blue-Green Quetzal Macaw" (active ca. 426-27 CE, hereafter Yax K'uk' Mo'). The text first recounts Yax K'uk' Mo's dynastic trans lation to Copan, citing the ceremonies he performed before his departure for the Honduran center and the rituals by which he instituted kingship on his arrival at Copan. The account then shifts forward about three and a half centuries, to events that transpired in the mid-770s. These actions cited in the text include the dedication of Altar Q itself around an important calendrical station that fell in late 775 and rituals of Altar Q's patron, Yax Pasaj, several months later. Scholarly reinterpretation of Altar Q's upper text has been accompanied by reidentification of the seated figures who appear along the main block's sides. Scholarship of the late</page><page sequence="5">298 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 6 Altar Q Copan, oblique view from above onto north side (photo: author) 1970s also revealed that Altar Q's figurai frieze presents the Copan dynasty's sixteen rulers, arranged in their historical sequence.20 The figures across Altar Q read as a kinglist, a dynastic roll anchored at the center of the monument's west face, where the two central figures face one another across a two-glyph text. The date between them was identified as the accession date of Yax Pasaj, Altar Q's patron, in 763 CE. The patron, the sixteenth ruler of Copan, appears to the imme diate right of the inscription, seated on his name glyph. To the left of the short text appears the founder of the Copan dynasty, Yax K'uk' Mo'. The founder is identified by archaic clothing specific to this historical personage and by the basal hieroglyph ajaw, "lord." From Yax K'uk' Mo', the founder and first ruler of the dynasty, the historical sequence of the Copan dynasty works to the left, to the second ruler of Copan, thence around the three successive sides of the monument, counting forward around the monument rulers one through sixteen, in the order of their historical accession to the city's kingship. The visual recitation of Cop?n's kings zippers around the monument, wrapping across its entire circumfer ence, until it comes full circle to Yax Pasaj, sixteenth ruler and patron of Altar Q set face-to-face with the first king of Copan, Yax K'uk' Mo'. Altar Q is not alone among ancient Maya monuments in providing a history of dynastic foundation and a sequence of historical exemplars. Though elliptical, Altar Q's upper text is among the most detailed single hieroglyphic statements of dynastic migration and instauration extant from the ancient Maya area, and it plays an important role in recent scholarly assessments of the lowland Maya dynasties' early history and ancestral ties to the cultures of central Mexico.21 Altar Q's kinglist, meanwhile, ranks among the most complete and succinct of such dynastic lists from the ancient Maya world. Its importance stems partly from the fact that here the thematic and historical elaborations found in other kinglists of the ancient Maya lowlands?those of Palenque are best known to modern scholarship22?are trimmed away, leaving only the programmatic skeleton of sixteen dynastic personages, named and ordered in historical sequence. Only a number of painted ceramic vessels from the north-central Peten and southern Campeche bear such direct tabulations of dynastic lines; these works contain two known sets, one of which provides a fragmentary list of the legendary rulers of the Calakmul dynasty, while the other treats the early historical rulers of Tikal.23 Less burdened with mythological embellish ment than the Palenque dynastic annals, more complete than the lists on the Peten ceramics, Altar Q's statement of dynas tic foundation and thumbnail kinglist have provided archae ologists and art historians an invaluable historical framework for the career of the Copan dynasty and its associated archae ology.24 Indeed, the historical validity of Altar Q's foundation record and kinglist has only been confirmed by recent ar chaeological excavation, thus enabling an earlier scholarly generation's abstract archaeological musings on "the rise of Maya civilization" to be replaced with more historically grounded consideration of the city's "course toward urban life."25 As a result, Altar Q's significance to the study of ancient</page><page sequence="6">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS igg 7 Altar Q Copan, inscription (drawing by David Stuart, from Stuart, "Hieroglyphs and Archaeology at Copan," fig. 3) Copan has come to be defined according to its account of the local dynasty's origins and historical progress. As valuable as these diachronic narratives of cultural history may be to larger archaeological comprehension of the Copanec state hood and the Maya cultural tradition, their totalizing linear trajectories of societal development tend to pass over the very sort of volumetric cultural analysis that this detailed archae ological work might otherwise enable.26 That is, archaeolog ical insistence on the long developmental curve of Maya Kulturgeschichte?leading either to civilization or to the estab lished state?flattens the forms of cultural practice that de termined the Copanec cultural tradition and gave shape to its artworks. Further, as they have played through the literature on Copanec monumental art, the criteria of post-Enlighten ment aesthetic judgment have dissociated scholarly consider ation of this and many other monumental works from their ancient historical and cultural contexts: transplanted from abroad, secure behind the high walls of the Acropolis, Co panec art dominates despite, not in conversation with, local matrices of culture and power in western Honduras. The argument here does not claim that the Copanec leadership or the polity it governed was not the "civilized," "complex," or "state-level" society as it has been cast by modern aesthetic criticism and archaeological scholarship. Rather, the essay works from the premise that the construct of "Classic Copan" has overfamiliarized Copanec monuments as sure signs of a high civilization or state-level society, and in so doing, this scholarship tends to overstate the art's identification with the visual and cultural tradition of the Maya cities of the southern lowlands and to suppress the visual and cultural specificity of works produced in the uplands around Copan. Even as re cent archaeological investigation in the broad area around Copan has prompted substantial revision of older views of the city's role in the region, the inherited criteria of aesthetic 8 Altar Q Copan, support (photo: author) judgment have worked to spare the Copanec visual tradi tion?particularly its carved monuments?similar reassess ment. Geographies of Prestige in Southern Mesoamerica The cultural geography of power in southern Mesoamerica was a salient fact in the history of Copan 's first-millennium dynasts. The earliest, longest-lived, and most active centers of "lowland Maya civilization" lay in the low karstic basins of northern Guatemala (the department of the Peten) and the southern interior of the Yucat?n Peninsula (the state of Campeche) (Fig. 9). Of these cities, Tikal and Calakmul are today the best known in the archaeological literature. By the eighth century, a cultural "interaction sphere" centered in the northern portion of Guatemala constituted a busy re gional neighborhood of independent polities, urban courts, and shared expectations.27 These cities were ruled by divine kings and titled subregnal elites bound by an elaborate cul tural discourse of respect and service, reciprocity and rank. It is a world amply summoned up by Bonampak Sculptured Stone 1 (692 CE), a coronation scene in which seated vassals offer a new king the headband of kingship (Fig. 10) .28 Here as elsewhere in the ancient Maya epigraphic and visual record, the conduct of Maya divine rulership was dependent on bonds of honor and personal obligation, such that the social compact of governance was acted out and commemo rated in ritualized forms of display. Rhetorical acts and cal culated speechifying?the kind of codified social mannerisms and ritualized politesse witnessed in the Bonampak scene? articulated common purpose and eased the barbed friend ships implicit in political hierarchy. Lowland Maya councils and banquets were also occasions in which diplomatic parley bracketed off enemies and delineated delicate shadings of prestige among those who belonged: over and again in the</page><page sequence="7">200 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 rlipififfMff Gulf of Mexico MEXICO Pacific Ocean M^^?m?d^to t ?Mi"1 "' 9 Map of the lowland Maya area and adjacent regions (map by Stephen D. Weaver) art of these cities, kings greet kings, nobles acknowledge royal patrons, and unlikely heirs honor esteemed ancestors. The Bonampak panel obeys a standard lowland Maya composi tional formula that encodes the courtly hierarchy by placing the scene's most powerful figure to the right and set above the assembled company.29 The sense of carefully controlled rhetorical exercise extends to the panel's execution, as well. The carving's serpentine line and counterbalanced composi tion?visual devices probably intended to evoke calligraphic brushwork?embody the linear idiom that was the signature of lowland Maya visual art of the time. Copan's fine temples and thirty-thousand-odd inhabitants were governed by rulers who spoke an ancestor of the mod ern Ch'orti' Mayan language; in speech, rhetoric, and ritual, the Copanec leadership's conduct was little different from those of other dynasties and nobilities across the lowland Maya world.30 At the same time, the lords of Copan ruled what was a curious, distant outlier to the lowland Maya inter action sphere. At latitude 14?51'30"N, longitude 89?9'W and 2,000 feet of elevation, the ancient urban center of Copan stood at a significant geographic remove from the contem porary lowland Maya polities whose ritualism and form of governance the Copanec leadership stridently claimed.31 On the map, Tikal lies about a good one hundred and fifty miles to Copan 's northwest; the two cities might have communi cated via a route that passed about seventy miles down the volcanic seam of Guatemala's Motagua River Valley, across the Gulf of Honduras, and up the coast of Belize, then about</page><page sequence="8">10 Sculptured Stone 1, Bonampak (from Peter Mathews, "Notes on the Dynastic Sequence of Bonampak," pt. 1, fig. 9; by permission) ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 201 seventy miles inland.32 This distance, in turn, made for con siderable topographic dissimilarities: while the dynastic seats of northern Guatemala rose above the swamps and rocky outcroppings of the lowlands' karstic shelf, Copan lay in an upland volcanic region of deciduous and piney forests. Within a morning's walk from the Copan Acropolis, moun tain peaks rise to about 4,200 feet of elevation.33 The geog raphy surrounding Copan afforded easier access to the Gua temalan highlands to the south; travel to the great highland centers covered less than half the distance that the trip to Tikal took. The ways south led into the rich cultural worlds and fat economies of Central America's volcanic high coun try. The various cultures and polities of the ancient Maya highlands are relatively poorly understood today?so much of their archaeological remains lie buried beneath modern settlement and agriculture?but it is clear that their elites led lives sharply distinct from their lowland Maya counterparts. They enjoyed abundant mineral wealth, stunning yields of maize and cacao, as well as strong and enduring ties to the Mesoamerican nobilities of Oaxaca and central Mexico.34 Meanwhile, the broad, wet valleys of western Honduras to the city's immediate north, east, and southeast were ruled by local bosses and trading chiefs, some of whom spoke Mayan languages?people, that is, who were Maya, likely Ch'orti' speakers?others who likely spoke the non-Maya tongues Lenca, Xinca, Jicaque, or Paya.35 Recent archaeological research in the Copan valley and its vicinity has reconfirmed the cultural heterogeneity of the region in which the life and works of the Copanec leadership unfolded, describing a complexity of cultural interaction un foreseen and unaccounted for in earlier scholarship.36 Throughout the first millennium CE, specialists note, "un derneath the imposing monuments to Copan's Maya status? hieroglyphic inscriptions, stelae, structure forms, and the like?[Copan] is a . . . non-Maya, west-central Honduran site."37 This scholarship has revealed that the dynasts of Co pan did not simply displace or re-form the region's local leaderships; rather, the Copanecos engaged in an intricate range of interactions and exchanges with them.38 The palaces of the Copanec leadership hosted, rather than turned away, non-Maya traders and dignitaries from Honduran and Salva doran regions to the east and south.39 There is good evidence that the Copanec rulership incorporated not a few of their region's cultural practices and material goods into their own: the fine plates and cups from which Copan's leaders ate were products of this rich world that lay without the Maya low lands.40 The dynasts of Copan traced the legitimacy of their line to the great capitals of the central Mexican plateau. Monoliths carved in yet another region, the Guatemalan highlands, were ritually set in Copan's ceremonial pre cincts.41 To an important degree, however, the lords of Copan chose to impose the presence of a lowland Maya-style divine kingship in the region, bringing with their rule the ritualism, settlement and living patterns, and administrative means of the southern lowlands' Maya dynasties. But the imposition of a lowland Maya cultural presence here was not total, nor was it a simple step up on the ladder of social and cultural evolution, nor was it insulated from the local cultural system of the Honduran uplands. Rather, recent archaeology sug gests that elites of the Copan valley enacted a more compli cated negotiation of identity, social practice, and power. While the picture remains incomplete, the recent archaeol ogy at Copan reveals something more like the slippery terrain of a cultural borderland than the firm bedrock of lowland Maya identity.</page><page sequence="9">202 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 Patron and Patronazgo at Copan Altar Q's patron, Yax Pasaj, was recognized in his monuments as the sixteenth successor of the Copan dynasty.42 His mother was a noblewoman of the lowland Maya dynasty of Palenque, Chiapas, and these blood ties to the lowland Maya dynasties were emphasized in his inscriptions.43 The ruler lived in a palace complex immediately adjoining the Acropolis's south ern side, where with his extended family and entourage he moved among buildings whose facades declared the antiquity of his ruling charter and identified his power with the heat of the sun.44 Lines of sight from almost anywhere in the valley might converge on the Acropolis, its eye-catching effect en couraged by the smudge rising from pots of incense placed along the complex's platforms and plazas. The smoldering incense burners carried inscriptions that spoke of the deities who fed on their smoke; pedestals supported effigies of Yax Pasaj's gods, supernaturals who were considered something like his "companioning ones [yitajiiy?]" or "guardians [kok noob"]." Baffles in the masonry of the Acropolis's elevated shrines worked valley breezes into a whistling drone.45 In Yax Pasaj's era the valley surrounding the Acropolis's high terraces and whistling temples was already an ancient place. In important respects, social and political hierarchy had long been identified with cultural intrusion and differ ence. Through the first millennium BCE and the early cen turies CE, settlement patterns and artifact assemblages of the valley's more humble residents resembled those of neighbor ing regions of upper Central America to the south and south east. When volcanism disrupted the cultural life of Salvador and adjoining areas in the centuries about 0 CE, it altered life in the Copan pocket as well; further, the general recovery of the Copan valley in the fourth and fifth centuries roughly coincides with the rebound of these regions to the east and south. While the majority of people in the Copan valley and its vicinity shared the living patterns of upper Central Amer ica, their leaders advertised their participation in an economy of prestige and lordship of Mesoamerican peoples to the north.46 During this long span of years, those who had com manded the Copan valley had manifested acute awareness of the region's position on the far periphery of Mesoamerica. By the middle part of the first millennium BCE, the residents of the Copan pocket identified social advantage with Olmec style regalia, ritual goods, and banqueting items, locally pro duced works that cleaved loosely to the visual morphology of lordship and ritual associated with the central Mexican high lands and Mexico's Gulf Coast.47 It is in the first centuries CE that the elites of Copan came to interact with and participate in the cultural world of the lowland Maya dynasties away in the lowlands of northern Guatemala, Belize, and Yucat?n. By the first part of the fifth century CE, the rituals of lowland Maya dynastic kingship drove the center's art and urbanism, and they continued to do so until the first decades of the ninth century. Between the dynasty's founding in 426 and its fall after Yax Pasaj's passing about 820, the Copanec leadership patronized inscribed monuments, dynastic shrines, and formal residential com plexes, all of this patronage bearing clearly enough the stamp of cultural forms of the lowland Maya dynasties of the north ern Pet?n. In particular, Copanec hieroglyphic texts enunci ate dynasty and cosmos with the same patterns of discourse? the same titles of authority, calendrical and astrological reckoning, and ritual deeds?recorded in texts produced among the lowland Maya cities to the northwest. As genera tions of farmers and villagers continued to follow the lifeways of central Honduras, the dynastic monuments of Copan as serted the leadership's identity as divine rulers in the manner of lowland Maya kings; through these works, a local leader ship forged an identity as lowland Maya rulers. The monuments placed by the first kings of the Copan dynasty refer to these leaders as "wise men [its'aat]."48 In the sixteenth century and later, the term "wise man [ah itsat]" was applied to notaries, scribes, and artists.49 In antiquity, its'aat referred to adepts and practitioners of the culture of knowl edge, but in the epigraphic record of the lowland cities, the title generally couches an understanding of literacy and the literate arts within notions encompassing learning, prestige, and lordship. The title's meanings remain only provisionally understood, but the term's significance was bound up in notions of learning, the righteousness of tradition, and the scrupulous observance of ritual obligation. In the scope of the larger corpus of lowland Maya hieroglyphic inscriptions, these first Copanec references to kings as "wise men" occur both extraordinarily early and unusually frequently as a royal title. Elsewhere in the Maya world, the title its'aat comes to prominence in the monuments and small works of the sev enth and eighth centuries, where it is associated with courtly priests and functionaries of nonroyal rank, as well as with supernaturals. The distribution of its use as a royal epithet in lowland Maya dynastic texts suggests that it was favored by royal houses that were upstarts or latecomers: it appears early at Copan but late at the centers Sacul and Seibal; it is also associated with a seventh-century lord of El Tortuguero who was a vocal pretender to the Palenque royal throne.50 This pattern of distribution implies that even as the employment of the its'aat title as a royal epithet proffered an outspoken avowal of lowland Maya dynasty and ritual, it also flagged a dynastic house's complicated relation with the artifice at its disposal. In the polemics of lordship among the Honduran borderlands' neighbors, interlocutors, and strangers, the rhetoric of ritual and comity embodied in the its'aat title inscribed identities as bold as they were uncertain. The outlines of the Copan dynasty's career between the fifth and early ninth centuries CE are legible, even if many of its important details remain obscure. There is partial but persistent evidence that the founding of the Copanec ruling line in 426 CE may have brushed aside and supplanted an existing Copanec dynasty: signs of early occupation lie buried beneath subsequent construction of the mid- to late first millennium, while Copan Stela 35, a fragmentary work of uncertain date, bears likenesses of standing kings executed in a style associated with the northern Peten in the mid-fourth to early fifth century CE.51 Several hieroglyphic inscriptions and visual works recovered from Copan refer briefly to ritu als, actors, and places of the polity's "predynastic" era, that is, before 426 CE. Despite their incompleteness and ambi guity?and for the most part they seem to be retrospective accounts produced after the fifth century?these records and citations allude clearly enough to dynastic activity before the official "foundation" of the long-lived royal line of Copan by Yax K'uk' Mo' in 426. A text on an inscribed peccary skull</page><page sequence="10">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 203 from Copan Burial 1, for instance, cites the performance of a dynastic ritual associated with an important calendar position in the late fourth century (Fig. 32).52 The century and a half subsequent to the founding of the Copan dynasty are but thinly documented in the epigraphic and monumental record. Near-contemporary monuments from southern Belize suggest that Copan's leaders pursued significant interactions with the lords of Nim Li Punit and other royal Maya dynasties of this region.53 Little archaeolog ical evidence exists to indicate that the dynasty's reach ex tended far beyond the valley of Copan, and it seems safe to assume that Copanec polity remained a local power in these years. Copanec monuments produced in this era survive only in fragmentary and broken condition, indicating upheaval in the dynasty's early career?perhaps some catastrophic set back that led to the defacement or despoliation of the early kings' monuments. This discomfiture ends with the accession of the tenth king of the line in 553 CE, for the monumental record once again picks up after that date. Several of the broken early works were reset in august ritual contexts by later rulers, a fact significant to the comprehension of Altar Q's design. Important to an understanding of Altar Qas well is the fact that the monuments surviving from this early era are in most cases all-glyphic works.54 As I argue below, the early all-glyphic monumental fragment is among the later work's important programmatic allusions. The kingship of Copan probably came into its own in the seventh and early eighth centuries, when successive rulers enjoyed long and relatively untroubled reigns.55 In these years Copan 's rulers patronized monuments that articulated the supernatural sanction embodied in their rule and that announced their seat as a center?indeed, as the central point?of cosmic order and universal significance. By the middle decades of the eighth century, Copan's monuments register the Copanec leadership's expansive ambitions, as well as some measure of their consummation. Telling details in these works also betray the dynasty's awareness of the polity's position on the edges of the lowland Maya world. One monument from the first part of the eighth century explicitly charts Copan's distance from the center: the inscription of Copan Stela A (731 CE) describes the dynasties of Calakmul, Tikal, Palenque, and Copan as something like "royal dynas ties of the four quadrants." By including the local dynasty among the great houses of the Peten, Stela A's inscription inserted the Copanec polity into the larger configuration of dynastic prestige and political significance in the Maya low lands. In representing the Copanec rulership as "the royal dynasty of the south," however, the text also situated these leaders at the periphery of this same cultural sphere. Like the employment of the "learned one" title its'aat, the use of this rhetorical trope was another gambit of provincial pretenders and late arrivals.56 A similar citation of "houses of the quad rants" occurs on Seibal Stela 10, carved in 849 CE, as part of an inadvertent description of a shrunken lowland Maya world of decaying political centers. The Copanecos, of course, have no place in this latter inscription, which instead joins the unlikely?because lesser?dynasties of Motul de San Jos? and Seibal to those of Calakmul and Tikal. The Copan dynasty was dealt a blow in the eighth century when in 738 CE the thirteenth dynast of the line, Waxakla juun Ub'aah K'awiil, was captured and sacrificed by nobles in the Motagua Valley center of Quiligua; the lords of Quiligua had been vassals of the rulers of Copan, but after 738 they claimed royal status and embarked on ambitious programs of monumental construction at their seat.57 By Yax Pasaj's ac cession in 763, the Copan dynasty had substantially recov ered, though it now presided over a more crowded, ecologi cally depleted, and politically fractious realm. Archaeological research in the Copan valley and its envi rons has compiled a remarkably detailed picture of the ma terial, economic, and social conditions of Yax Pasaj's era. The Acropolis dominated the valley floor; from it, causeways and palace groups fanned out across the alluvial bottomlands to the northeast and southwest. Settlement on the valley floor now covered the basin's best farmland, leaving the rockier hillsides to be stripped and overfarmed. Topsoil washed down from eroded slopes, silting up against the platforms and in the plazuelas of fine apartments on the valley bottom.58 Indeed, decades of Yax Pasaj's rule saw high-status residences and palace compounds expand to a sprawl across the Copan valley floor.59 The fine structures boasted broad courtyards, houses raised on platforms, and wide benches worked with hieroglyphics commemorating these nobles' ritual deeds.60 These remains document an extravagant ritualism and out spoken insistence on the nobles' political dignity.61 These spaces were sites of fractious social energies, but they also served as the stages for rituals that enacted these nobles' fealty to royal authority. The divine ruler seated in the Acrop olis remained the central pole of these centrifugal and cen tripetal impulses, but only, it seems, by virtue of energetic exercise of diplomacy and the arts of rulership.62 Yax Pasaj's rule was long?upwards of forty-seven years?but his efforts to address the exigencies of a faltering kingship would be the terminal deeds of the Copan dynasty. Carved piers in the shrine of Copan Structure 10L-18 (Structure 18), Yax Pasaj's mortuary shrine, recall this ruler as a warrior; in these carvings he appears with a craggy face and the long spear that was the preferred weapon of lowland Maya nobility (Fig. 11). These representations present him in the guise of the warrior, an aspect assumed in a ceremonial event of 773. Accompanying texts state that he is shown here performing a war dance associated with the rededication of Structure 10L-11 (Structure 11) in that year, one of the first recorded acts of Yax Pasaj's reign. The ritual event was allied with the renovation and expansion of Structure 11, an exist ing structure that was probably the burial shrine of Yax Pasaj's immediate royal predecessor, the fifteenth ruler of Copan.63 In fact, though many inscriptions survive from Yax Pasaj's reign, there are no citations of warfare among them. What the texts associated with this ruler's activities treat are subjects like that in the Structure 18 jambs?ceremonies that put him in ritualized conversation with his various human and super natural constituencies. One of the most evocative likenesses of this sociable ruler is found on a carved deer tibia produced after 803, on which the aged Yax Pasaj appears in the guise of the youthful Maya god of maize, attended by a supernatural female consort (Fig. 12).64 Archaeologists generally agree that Yax Pasaj's reign saw the Copanec leadership operating networks of patronage and gift giving among the various elites of western Honduras.

Others adopted and embraced lowland Maya living patterns, building formal residences around courtyards, participating in a traffic of gifts, goods, and praise that took its bearings from the Copan Acropolis.66 Those lords on the Copan valley floor and out among the Honduran valleys who remained loyal to the leadership of Copan were presented with gifts and welcomed as friends; even powerful renegades?such as those of Quirigu??were accorded the dignity of royal visits.67 The participants in western Honduras's traffic in lowland 12 Carved deer tibia, Copan.

The Hondurans embraced the sociability of lowland Maya nobility that placed them in conversation with the divine ruler and set them in his political service. A few dazzling imports from the lowland Maya world circulated among the Copanecos and their wards, most of these works produced in Belize.68 The local wares?Ulua polychrome and Copador? were fine works that favored the appearance of lowland Maya ceramics, even if they could only roughly approximate their visuality.69 Though their decoration recalls lowland Maya works, the Honduran works did not attempt to emulate the weightless abstraction of lowland Maya surface pattern. Still, the local ceramics that circulated through the ca?adas and muddy plains of western Honduras summoned up the wealth and urbanity of the lowland Maya court ably enough. Circulating among these goods, too, was Yax Pasaj himself. His rituals are recorded at the site of Quirigu? in 810, and he was surely active among the outlying house compounds of the Copan pocket and much further afield.70 The traces of Yax Pasaj's activities as a peripatetic diplomatist are also preserved in several inscribed alabaster vases from western Honduras. One work was recovered in the 1950s from the site of El Abra, a small set of mounds dating to about the eighth century found in the La Florida Valley of western Honduras.71 This work, now in the site museum of El Puente, Honduras, bears only a text that records Yax Pasaj's performance of a dance</page><page sequence="12">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 205 ffc^ 13 Incised alabaster vase, rollout view, western Honduras, late 8th century CE. Private collection (photo: ?Justin Kerr) ritual in 775 CE. Another alabaster bowl that has come to light bears portraits of Yax Pasaj in elaborate costume and an inscription that details a different occasion of ritual dance (Fig. 13).72 A shard of a third inscribed alabaster vessel was excavated in the late 1970s from the ruins of Copan Structure 18's vaulted crypt?almost certainly Yax Pasaj's tomb, sacked in antiquity.73 The centrality of these alabaster vessels to the rhetoric of Copanec kingship is thus assured, as is their circulation among local elites far removed from the Copan Acropolis. In each piece, a hard, fluent line, its channel filled with cinnabar, cuts across the thin vessel walls of milky stone. It is the lowland Maya calligrapher's line?what one scholar aptly calls the "silken thread"?moving across a luminous ground plane.74 The presence of this calligraphic formalism on the vases confirms the Copanecos' acute awareness of the visual idiom of lowland Maya civility and their command of this formalism's technical particulars. Clearly, too, on these gift items that circulated among the notables of western Honduras, the calligraphic silken thread of Maya line stands in as the frontispiece for the political life of comity and councils presided over by the lords of Copan. While this use of line may stand in full accord with con temporary lowland Maya formal norms, in important ways the stone vases across which it coursed were more local forms.75 Alabaster vases were a specialty of northwestern Honduras in these centuries; such Ulua-style vases are decidedly unlike lowland Maya works, for they prefer tight scrolls in low relief and jutting, zoomorphic handles (Fig. 14).76 They tend to be thicker than the king's bowl, though they are of roughly the same dimensions. Indeed, the El Abra and other vases have rough equivalents in form and size among contemporary ceramics (Ulua polychromes) from the same area. The thin walls of Yax Pasaj's bowls, though, draw in light and fairly explode with luminescence in direct sunlight. This is the kind of technical handling generally associated with alabaster ves sels from the Teotihuacan culture of central Mexico. The Honduran lapidary's art and the central Mexican eye for materials are here directed toward the evocation of the low land Maya painted wall surface or gessoed manuscript page: to view these vases in good light is to see the calligrapher's 14 Ul?a-style carved vessel.

One senses that this is how the lowland Maya mise-en-^page or mural inscription should have looked, but never could, be cause of technical limitations of plaster, bark paper, and pigment. They offer instances of cultural insight on the low land Maya visual tradition from the borderlands along which Yax Pasaj moved. Structure 16: The View from the Plaza Floor The kings of Copan thus operated at a critical distance from the lowland wellsprings and capitals of dynastic authority.

The visual tradition patronized by the kings of Copan was preoccupied to mine forms proper to the dynasty's own patronal history rather than meet shift ing expectations set among their lowland Maya dynastic con temporaries. Their visual works were unusually attentive to the full sweep of the Mesoamerican cultural scope?whether fine goods produced close at hand among the uplands of western Honduras and El Salvador, the compelling works produced among highland peoples in the middle distance, or cultural forms visible along the broader cultural horizons of greater Mesoamerica. Over the final, troubled decades of the eighth century, this local rhetorical tradition assumed a re newed sense of urgency. In the landscape of the Copan valley, no building was more central or more prominent than the Copan Acropolis's cen tral temple, Structure 10L-16: the bulky structure rose many feet above the stacked horizontals of the Acropolis's sur rounding plazas and terraces, and its skyscraping promi nence was further accentuated by a crowning two-story shrine (Fig. 15). Though Structure 16 rises from the interwoven architectural fabric of the Acropolis, the building reads as a freestanding mass, its superimposed terraces rising uninter rupted from the East and West Courts.77 Structure 16 prob ably received its final remodeling early in Yax Pasaj's reign: excavations in the West Court have revealed that an Altar Q dedication in 776 CE marked the completion of the archi tectural renovation that produced the final form of Struc ture 16.78 Together with the Acropolis's ancestral monuments, smok ing incense burners, and whistling temple facades, Altar Q was a device that put its patrons into communication with the supernatural. In this role, the monument's programmatic ambitions and formal strategies were determined by the work's location and its symbolic equivalence with that place. Before Structure 16's massive terraces, Altar Q's low cube of stone eased the transition from the scale of experience on the plaza floor to the soaring gigantism of the terraces and platforms that crowd around this sunken space (Fig. 1 ). The tall facade rising behind Altar Q bore outsize masks and other monumental compositions that articulated principles of cosmology and dynasty underpinning the legitimacy of the Copan ruling house. Recent surface excavation and conser vation have recuperated a substantial portion of Structure 16's elaborately carved facade. This work, together with deep excavations beneath the structure, has revealed conclusively that the building served as the burial place and shrine of a fifth-century personage, almost certainly the fifth-century founder of the Copan dynasty, Yax K'uk' Mo'. Further, ar chaeologists have uncovered a complicated stratigraphie his tory of architectural refits and expansions intervening be tween the final structure dedicated in 776 and the early funerary platform at its core; beneath the structure renovated under Yax Pasaj's reign lay a four-hundred-year sequence of individual structures, each one built over an ancestor and in turn buried by a successor.79 Though visually exuberant, the monumental facade that rose behind Altar Q was deeply conservative, having been drawn from what was at the time a long tradition of architec tural decoration and symbolism in lower Mesoamerica and the lowland Maya area. As the effort of architectural recon struction and interpretation led by Barbara Fash, Karl Taube, and Jorge Ramos has revealed, the central stairway of Struc ture 16 supported three successive "blocks" organized verti cally along the centerline of the building's elevation (Figs. 16, 17). Each of these blocks consisted of an elaborate, platform like composition of architectural sculpture inserted into the stairway's ascent of Structure 16. Together, the three blocks formed altarlike stations along the stairway, each of which probably held incense burners or were otherwise the site of ritual actions. Stair Block I, lowest on the facade, presented a colossal face of the central Mexican deity Tlaloc surrounded by human skulls; this imagery of the underworld and sacrifice alluded to the tomb of the founder below the building.80 In Stair Block II, the founder appears in a mirror-cartouche as the solar war deity rising out of the underworld. In Stair Block III?the most enigmatic of the three, and the most esoteric in its symbolism?celestial clouds emerge from a zoomorphic maw to bathe the mythic city of origin in life</page><page sequence="14">16 Structure lOL-16, Copan, Block I (below) and Block II (above).

Together, these three blocks along Structure 16's staircase advertise the sacredness of the tomb inside the building, convey the founder's apotheosis as a solar deity of war, and invoke the mythological landscape in which his burial and resurrection transpired. As did other facade programs at Copan, Structure 16's sculptural program mapped supernatural distance onto the building's monumental face. Rarefied truths and the distant past appeared high on the ornamented facades of Copan 's pyramids, at a significant remove from the plaza floor's base line in the present. Elsewhere among the Acropolis's fine pyramids, the hieroglyphic stairway of Structure 10L-26 re lated Copan 's dynastic history in a text that began on the building's first carved step and read up the staircase. The story recounted in the text moved back from the present into previous generations as the inscription progressed from the first stairway block upward; carved risers bearing the history of Cop?n's kings ascended the building's facade, moving successively upward and away from the mid-eighth century back into the dynasty's past.81 So, too, with Structure 16's program, in which the dynasty's alien founder appeared near the summit of the pyramid, well removed from the mundane world below. Structure 16's tall facade presented Cop?n's dynastic founder as both a local historical eminence and a mytho graphic device of Mesoamerican kingship. While the founder's bones interred deep below offered the index of a local past, his appearance on Structure 16's staircase assumed him into the high-flown mythicohistorical legacy of Me soamerican rulership. Dancing among a constellation of cen tral Mexican symbols on Structure 16's facade, the figure of Yax K'uk' Mo' gestured to the Copan dynasty's ancient source of ruling legitimacy and presented the personage who brought the sanctioning charter of rulership to Copan. Ele vated above the plaza floor, shimmering among the em blemata of sacred rule, the founder was a divinatory appari tion and ritually summoned avatar of kingship. At once visionary and palpably physical, the founder bridged and mediated the worlds of the local and the global, history and timelessness: he embodied an eloquent local representative to the cosmic sphere and a manifestation of transcendent dominion within the local order.</page><page sequence="15">208 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 17 Structure lOL-16, Copan, Block III. Copan, Honduras, Museo de Escultura Maya (photo: author) Altar Q: Sum of Its Parts It was on the plaza before Structure 16 that the parochial met the transcendent, and the timely and the timeless were brought face to face. The palpable presence and physical institution of a mythic past is broadly characteristic of Altar Q's role within Structure 16's thematic program. Indeed, Altar Q may be related to the broad class of monumental imagery that put supernatural beings in human proximity. Standing before Structure 16's sweeping flights of stairs, Altar Q provided the present with its most immediate access to the building's esoteric meanings, a station at which the historical legacy figured as myth above was put into motion as histori cally conscious action on the plaza floor. Altar Q provided an ordered, foursquare locus for such ritual action; this aspect of the monument's significance is most immediately apparent in its square design and its four supports. Mayanists refer to low pedestals or tables as altars, following the vernacular usage of nineteenth-century Central Ameri ca.82 Anachronistic as the term may be, it is certain that in antiquity these stone pedestals and tables did have a ritual function. The ancient Maya commonly placed them before the staircases of monumental structures or before monolithic stone sculptures, and in either case, they appear to have served as stations and furniture for ritual actions associated with the building or the standing monolith. They received offerings or otherwise provided a level platform for rituals associated with the upright sculpture behind; set before the high facades and steep staircases of monumental structures, 18 Stela 26, Tikal, glyph block yB2 (photo: University of Pennsylvania Museum) these works focused ritual actions allied with the often outsize building. The symbolic identification and functional alliance of table altars with monumental architectural structures is relatively common in the Maya epigraphic record. Maya texts cite the close association of buildings and table altars: the inscription of Tikal Stela 26 (before 378 CE), for instance, includes a hieroglyphic collocation that graphically allies a stepped pyr amid temple and a table altar (Fig. 18).m Maya hieroglyphic texts use a set vocabulary of expressions to refer to altars and pedestals; most of these terms continue to frustrate firm phonetic decipherment. Altar Q's dedication text refers to the work with a glyph that may read something like kuch?-? tuun, perhaps reading "support-" or "pedestal-stone" (T174: 530/643 at positions E2, F6).84 At Copan and elsewhere among the lowland Maya cities, the kuch, or "support," ex pression occurs in the dedication texts of altars and other forms of ritual furniture: the inscription of Copan Altar Z (769 CE) includes two forms of the kuch expression, one referring to the object itself as a "support-?-stone" (C2-D2), the other probably a reference to the work's employment as a plinth for god effigies (Gl). At Tikal, a verbal form of the kuch, or "support," expression comes up in texts related to rulers being seated on elaborate palanquins.85 If it is certain that Maya altars received offerings or ritual goods, the particular ritual actions performed at these stones remains wholly unclear. Many pedestals and altar tables may have served as thrones: several altars at Copan bear throne iconography, while a carved monument from the Belizean polity of Nim Li Punit (Stela 1, 741 CE) presents a human protagonist seated on a table altar. Two carved monuments at another Belizean site, Caracol Altars 23 (800 CE) and 22 (810 CE), depict bound captives set on table altars. Other altars at Copan may have played a more symbolic function as thrones, being employed as pedestals for god effigies. In addition to Altar Z, Copan Altar F' bears a text that explicitly identifies the work as a pedestal for a god effigy (k'ohbaah?),86 The long dedication inscription in the Temple of the Inscriptions at Palenque (683 CE) associates a table altar with the ritual display of headdresses and effigies of patron deities.87</page><page sequence="16">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 209 19 Altar 4, El Cayo (drawing by Peter Mathews) One of the most explicit visual depictions of ritual associ ated with an altar table appears across the flat upper surface of an altar from the Usumacinta polity of Yax Niil, today known as the ruins of El Cayo (Fig. 19). This work, El Cayo Altar 4 (731 CE), portrays the work's noble patron, seated before a table altar?Altar 4 itself?scattering grains of in cense. In the carved image, the altar supports a spiky incense burner displaying a skeletal face with jaguar ear and spots, imagery associated with underworld deities and rites of fire starting.88 El Cayo Altar 4 is important in part for the sense it communicates of the altar as the site of an assemblage of offerings and ritual items: the incense burner in turn con tains bundled kindling sticks, probably something like fat wood or ocote, wood strips soaked in pine sap, as well as an arrangement of feathers bunched in a knotted and woven sleeve, all clustered around a swelling cloth bundle. This agglomerative character of ritual performed at the altar?a ritual collecting or assembling of many things at the altar's ritual locus?is confirmed in the dedication texts of several monumental sculptures at Copan, inscriptions in which ritual "bundling events" are recounted in detail.89 The ancient Mayas' understanding of the stone monument as a kind of ritual construction of many gathered goods is further corrob orated by the most common expressions in the epigraphic record that describe ritual events involving altars: scattering (chok), heaping (ts'ap), placing/forming (pat), and seating (chum), terms often accompanied by linguistic affixes that in Classic Mayan writing indicate changes of position or orien tation (-waan). The altar as a locus of a piling on of ritual goods is a constant theme in the programs of iconographie decoration worked into Maya pedestals and table altars. Many monumen tal stone pedestals at Tikal were worked with imagery of ropes or mats; this decoration shows the stone to have been "bun dled" or "wrapped," an action often cited in dedication in 20 Altar 10, Tikal, top surface (drawing from Jones et al., The Monuments and Inscriptions of Tikal: Tikal Report 33a, fig. 34b; courtesy Tikal Project Archives, University of Pennsylvania Museum) scriptions of monumental stone sculpture (k'al, "wrap"). These monuments at Tikal may also carry other embellish ment, such as captives bound to the stone or various kinds of bird feathers draped over the object's surface (Fig. 20) .90 Closer to home, the carved decoration of Copan altars also sought to impart a sense of the object as a compound work, a construction built out of many forms or layers of decora tion. Early or simpler altars have imagery of cloth or mat wrapping around their surface. By Yax Pasaj's era, altars were more elaborate; the decorative program of Copan Altar T (783 CE), for instance, included a caiman skin draped across the stone's top, with legs, head, and tail dangling along the altar's sides. Other altars produced during Yax Pasaj's reign were designed to serve as components for larger, scaffoldlike ritual constructions; Altar G I-III (766 CE), a monumental ensemble of three carved stones, offers one such instance. The iconographie articulation of the altar as a compounded assemblage of objects may also be related to the elaborate foundations sometimes constructed underneath, around, or immediately before the stone shafts of standing monuments. In the eighth century, stelae at Copan were often set atop squared or cruciform foundations; this "substela cribbing" could hold caches and deposits of shell, obsidian, or other ritual goods.91 Sometimes the surfaces of this foundation work were exposed to view and carved with text, such as the square foundation stones surrounding the base of Copan Stela N, which carry a text along their upper surfaces that relates the dedication of the work in 761 CE. To the Maya, these various fictive heaps of goods and more literal monumental assemblages were understood as ritually ordered constructions. Hieroglyphic texts from Copan that cite rituals associated with the dedication of monuments or</page><page sequence="17">210 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 21 Adoratorio, Zapotee (drawing by Javier Urcid, "A Peculiar Stone with Zapotee Hieroglyphic Inscriptions," fig. 2) altars invoke the cosmology of the four-sided Mesoamerican universe and emphasize the monument's obedience to the principle of the foursquare, ritually ordered space. The in scription of Copan Stela A (731 CE) is among the most detailed and explicit enunciations of ritual ordering by fours. Stela A's text?the same one that charted the Copan dynas ty's place along the edges of the lowland Maya world? describes the opening of a supernatural portal, perhaps the cruciform foundation beneath the monument, with a string of linked quadruplets: four deities of the sky, the lords of four prominent dynastic houses (Copan, Tikal, Calakmul, Palenque), and the four cardinal directions. The device was not new to Copanec monuments of the eighth century; the inscription of Copan Stela 6 recounts a royal ritual in 682 at which a company of "four lords, four young ones"?perhaps deities or supernaturals?looked on.92 This ritual pattern of fours ran deep in the Maya and Mesoamerican cultural tradition. Across Mesoamerica, over many centuries, the four-sided figure played a significant role as an ordering principle in pre-Columbian ritual construc tions.93 Most Mesomerican peoples understood the cosmos itself to be four-sided or quincunx in configuration, being defined by the four cardinal directions and a fifth, the center. Such cosmological understanding in turn structured the spaces and scenes of ritual events. Maya tombs might bear directional glyphs on walls corresponding to each of the cardinal directions, as on the walls of R?o Azul Tomb 12, a royal or very elite burial from the fifth century CE. Individual Maya buildings and shrines often had quadripartite floor plans. The earliest known building dedicated by Yax Pasaj, Copan Structure 11, was such a structure, its four central piers worked with mirroring hieroglyphic texts. High above Altar Q Structure 16's surmounting shrine was also orga nized around four piers in a square ground plan.94 At the same time, altars and ritual deposits around ancient Me soamerica asserted the harmony of the ritual locus with the well-ordered cosmos: Zapotee adoratorios of ancient Oaxaca carried direction glyphs along the edges of their four sides (Fig. 21).95 The circular altars placed by the Tenochca Aztec generally bore four personified flints at the quadrant points of the monument's sides, intended to sanctify and "square" the circular form of the solar disks on their top surface.96 Ritual caches across ancient Mesoamerica mapped out or derly cosmic space: the ritual deposits of the Aztec and Maya alike often involved the placement of sacral objects in square arrangements.97 Despite the apparently irregular urban con figurations of most ancient cities of the Maya lowlands, at least some Maya centers seem to have been organized accord ing to cruciform urban plans.98 Deep into the colonial and modern eras, the belief and ceremonial practice of various Maya groups have invoked a four-part schema of ritually ordered space, directionality, and position: Yucatec creation accounts recorded in the sixteenth century describe the world as a squared expanse supported by "four brothers whom God placed, when he created the world, at the four points of it."99 By design, Altar Q was another such foursquare ritual enclosure. The squaring of ritual space was established by the altar table's four stone supports. They presented the monu ment on the plaza floor, the sturdy supports beneath each corner acting something like four table legs or house posts that define and support the realm of human and cosmic order within. In a metaphor analogous to that used by twen tieth-century Tzotzil Maya of Zinacant?n to describe the uni verse itself, Altar Q's supports and main block constituted a kind of "house, or table," supported by four corner posts. As Karl Taube has shown, in the Maya cultural tradition the quadrangular arrangement of the house's corner posts ex pressed the macrocosm of the universe and embodied the sanctioning "center place" of the ritual locus.100 Altar Q's stone legs are today badly spalled, for they also protected the monument's main block from the same de structive process of groundwater transpiration that left them wrecks. Their surfaces betray hints of carving: the carved supports may once have presented imagery of personified, sacred stones, probably supernaturally charged greenstone celts (Fig. 8). The visible hairlines above the foreheads of the masks on Altar Q's supports recall the Maya maize god's full head of hair, which would associate the stones with the vitality of corn. Similar zoomorphic masks are found in the contem porary iconography of Maya thrones, as, for example, the basal motifs in the bench of Copan Structure 18 (ca. 820 CE, Fig. 22).101 Altar Q's supports, like these other masks, an nounced that work's status as a "vital" stone; set as four pillars, they demarcated the monument's space as a foursquare ritual enclosure. Like other ritual diagrams of ancient Mesoamerica, Altar Q</page><page sequence="18">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 211 %&gt;V i^^?^?A 22 Structure lOL-18, Copan, bench support (photo: author) presents a squared microcosm of four sides and a center (Fig. 2). The frieze of seated rulers around the monument's sides?its four sets of four figures?effect the same sense of quadrangular ritual enclosure instituted by the altar's four supports. Altar Q's figurai frieze rounds the square, invoking the language of body performance to define and inscribe the object's place in the world.102 Its gathered circle of men is flipped inside out: the viewer perceives the gathering in fours, such that the seated dynasts on each of Altar Q's sides are viewed frontally, as if from within the precinct they define. Rather than turn their backs on the plaza around them, these figures envelop the space surrounding the altar into their gathering: the viewer sees as if through the monument, to the far side of the circle. By means of this counterintuitive device, Altar Q not only defines a perimeter of figures but also defeats any sense of this circle's self-enclosure. As an ideologically constructed representation of space, then, Altar Q's overall design observed the quadrilateral dic tates of ordered ritual space in Mesoamerica. But more than this, in partitioning the Acropolis's built environment by means of a representation of social space, the work's sides drew from the cultural discourse of council and friendship so central to Yax Pasaj's conduct as ruler of the Copanec king dom. The overriding image of Yax Pasaj as ruler is that found on Altar Q's west side, that of the sociable king at the council mat, not the warrior in the field (Figs. 3, 4). The monuments and inscriptions produced in his era provide an unusually detailed record of the clients and friends with whom Yax Pasaj interacted. There are understated connections that tie him to other dynastic houses of the lowlands. Palenque is particularly important in this regard, for Yax Pasaj's monu ments identify a female noble of Palenque as this ruler's mother, while royal epithets Yax Pasaj bore followed the usage of Palenque's kings.103 Then there is the regard Yax Pasaj's patronage paid to previous Copanec dynasts. As noted above, Yax Pasaj appears to have been responsible for the renovation and expansion of Structure 11, likely the burial shrine of his immediate dynastic forebear, the fifteenth ruler of Copan, an effort that included the construction of a ritual ball court on the south side of the structure; the dedication inscription of this small ball court includes the prominent citation of Yax Pasaj's dynastic predecessor, Waxaklajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, the ruler who was probably responsible for its initial construction.104 The traces of Yax Pasaj's grand strategy of sociability were as evident on Altar Q's foursquare surfaces as they were out among the palaces and residences of the Honduran uplands. Incense burners and pedestal altars found around the Copan pocket bear inscriptions that cite various deities' "seating [chum-\n on the occasion of Yax Pasaj's accession in 763.105 During Yax Pasaj's reign, these and other beings were vari ously feted with the smudge of carved incense burners, they were accorded their own "houses," or their effigies were set on pedestals (Fig. 23).106 In the Acropolis, Yax Pasaj was surrounded with seated forebears, patrons, and guardians, their presence memorialized in the seated forms of Maya aristocrats. Their physical presence assumed a human aspect, and their furniture a human scale: small pedestals and sub stantial?but never towering?altars, diminutive temples in the Acropolis, incense burners the size of large baskets. "Seated" around the spaces of the Acropolis, the ruler's su pernatural patrons and dynastic ancestors assumed the kind of courtly social diagram presented in a late-eighth-century painted drinking vessel from the eastern Peten ruin of Naranjo: here, a quorum of gods is "ordered [ts'akyaj]" in council on the day of world creation in 3114 BCE (Figs. 24, 25).107 The arrangement of dynasts on Altar Q's sides, moreover, enacts a ritual ordering often associated with cosmic order elsewhere in the cultural record of the Maya area. Over the hills to Copan's north, the lords of Quirigu? celebrated their political ascendancy in the mid-eighth century with monu ments that commemorated and symbolically reenacted the seating of gods associated with this creation event.108 Back in</page><page sequence="19">212 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 23 Incense burner, Copan, recovered from the royal residence compound to the immediate south of the Acropolis.

At Copan, this tomb may be the closest analogue to Altar Q's arrangement of dynasts, for these seated ceramic figures spatially enact the same choreography found on Altar Q's sides.109 Colonial Yucatec ritual practice also insisted on ceremonies of nomination and ordering. The ritual nomination as an invocation of cosmic structure operated as what one anthropologist calls an "instrument of spatial trans formation;" on the occasion of important calendar period endings, particularly, councilors were "ordered" at the mat, while the boundary stones of whole districts were ritually counted and so symbolically submitted to cosmic order.110 The building block of Altar Q's aulic spatial diagram is the seated figure. In lowland Maya art of the seventh and eighth centuries, it was a familiar figurai type. Described by special 24 Painted cylinder vase, Naranjo region, Guatemala. Art Institute of Chicago (photo: ?Justin Kerr) ists as the "Maya posture of royal ease," it is the pose of the seated banqueter and the ritualist.111 It forms the basis of Bonampak Sculptured Stone l's coronation scene, in which nuances of pose and gesture of the basic figurai type convey the equipoise of the newly ascended dynast and the loyal attentiveness of his vassals (Fig. 10). Altar Q's composition employs the figurai type to the same end: captioned with the accession date of Yax Pasaj, it offers a mythologized scene of this ruler's coronation attended by the gathering of dynasts. The composition's associations with the rites of royal acces sion are reinforced by the instruments held in the seated kings' raised hands. All sixteen dynasts hold fans of paper (Fig. 5), a material employed in the ancient Maya world as a costume ornament and as fuel in rituals of bloodletting and fire starting.112 The stiff material bunched in their fists makes an unmistakable allusion to the ceremony of "headband tying [k'al huun]"?the fastening of a paper headband around the protagonist's head?that was the signal act of royal investi ture;113 as Karl Taube suggests, the paper fans also gesture to rituals of fire starting that played an important role in dynas tic ceremonies of ancestor veneration.114 Royal accession and remembrance are implicit, too, in the presence beneath the</page><page sequence="20">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 213 25 Rollout view of Fig. 28 (photo: ?Justin Kerr) monument of cached felines?likely, a jaguar for each of the patron's royal precursors.115 Among the best-documented royal accession ceremonies of the pre-Columbian world are those of the Tenochca Aztec of central Mexico; their kings' accessions were accompanied by elaborate ceremonies of oration at which noble retainers and vassals delivered long rounds of ritual speech.116 This kind of rhetorical outpouring and exchange is implicit in the counterbalanced figurai composition and suggestive figurai interactions in Bonampak Sculptured Stone 1 and other contemporary scenes of lowland Maya audience chambers. Altar Q's circuit of attentive, gesturing figures works to de marcate the same discursive space of ritualized speechifying and elevated rhetoric that characterized the royal council and audience hall. Altar Q's composition projects the inter action into space. The ring of isocephalic figures around Altar Q's sides creates a precinct of aulic sociability, a con versation among kings, and the gathered dynasts thus repre sent the social discipline of dynasty, as well as the historical sequence of its local exemplars. Altar Q's sides propose a diachronic progression of Copan 's historical kings but, equally, these kings enact a larger, synchronie figure of the dynasty's historical integrity: the gathering of rulers estab lishes a circular precinct that is the space of dynastic memory. The wrapping of frontal bodies around the monument, fur ther, pulls the space around the work into the privileged orbit of their conference to create an annular precinct of civility, in which gazes and gestures cut across the circular space, as the seated figures' frontal address to the viewer works to incorporate the observer into the charmed locus of dynastic comity. Altar Q's program inscribes a sacred precinct within the broader floor of the West Court by presenting the sociable interaction of otherworldly personages, their en counter living in the moment. They offer the performative evanescence of song and ritual in the king's presence; frozen across the stone, the gathered company figures the timeless integrity of the Copan dynasty. 26 Incense burner lids from Copan Burial 37-4 (photo: ?Justin Kerr) Altar Q's figurai composition gestures to the nuanced de pictions of royal accession and regnal sociability found abroad among the art of the lowland Maya cities, but the overriding reference intended in its seated figures is to ar chaic motifs of southern Mesoamerica. By comparison with seated figures produced in the Maya lowlands, Altar Q's seated dynasts are locked in hieratic stiffness: the Copanecos' backs are straighter, heads more rigid on their necks, their gestures more wooden. This is because Altar Q's seated fig ures pointedly recall precedents from deeper in the visual tradition of southern Mesoamerica.

Private collection (photo: Joe Tagliarini) 28 Plaque, Comit?n (drawing by Chelsea Dacus) centuries or more before Altar Q's dedication. Such relatively wooden seated figures, squat and shorn of linear elegance, may be found on another stone from Bonampak, the "Po" panel, dated by inscription to 521 CE (Fig. 27), as well as on painted and carved ceramic works from the lowlands made around this time and the century before.117 Altar Q's figures similarly sit on name glyphs: Altar Q's ancestral protagonist, the fifth-century personage Yax K'uk' Mo', sits on the same ajaw (lord) hieroglyphic collocation that is often found in the early figurai vignettes (Fig. 4). Indeed, this formulaic, strate gic intermingling of text and image accentuates the use of the seated dynasts as so many redeployed archaic motifs. Further, as do these compositions from the middle of the first millennium CE, Altar Q features the seated figure in a symmetrical configuration of affronted figures. In Me soamerica, this device extended back to the first millennium BCE, to compositions executed in the Olmec style portraying seated pairs of figures caught in sociable gesticulation. A greenstone plaque from the middle or late first millennium BCE incised in the Olmec style recovered in the region of Comit?n, Mexico, bears such a composition (Fig. 28).118 By the first centuries CE, the art of the great centers of highland Guatemala displayed pairs of seated figures, both in monu mental art and on ceramics produced there in the styles of southern Mesoamerica and central Mexico. A fourth- or fifth century painted ceramic recovered from the highland Maya capital of Kaminaljuyu, for instance, depicts conversing gods seated on hieroglyphs associated with water and rain (Fig. 29).119 The motif of the affronted pair recurs in the art of the southern Maya lowlands through the eighth century. In most of these instances, the compositional device is associated with ancestors, as on the upper register of Yaxchil?n Stela 11 (752 CE, Fig. 30), the openwork composition of Piedras Negras Throne 1 (780s CE), or the basal registers of several eighth century stelae placed at El Per?. In all of these cases, the poses and gestures of the ancestral pair are softened and relaxed in the compositional mode of the lowland Maya cities; on Yaxchil?n Stela 11, they appear above the main scene, where their symmetrical disposition offers a calculated foil to the more dynamic, counterbalanced figurai composi tions with which they are juxtaposed. By comparison, Co panec instances of the device's eighth-century use are more literal citations and redeployments of the ancient composi tional formula. A notable application came early in Yax Pasaj's reign, in 775, as a prominent element in the decora tion of the renovated Structure 10L-11: a carved bench panel set within Structure 11?the outer edges of the lip of a single broad bench?included the figures of twenty seated super natural beings gathered at the event of Yax Pasaj's accession in 763 (Fig. 31 ).120 The relevance of the paired-figure motif to Altar Q was made all the more evident by its appearance on important works from early in the Copan dynasty's history. It can be seen in a figurai composition on a carved peccary skull from</page><page sequence="22">29 Painted highland Maya ceramic, Kaminaljuyu (rendering from Kidder et al., Excavations at Kaminaljuyu, fig. 205c; courtesy Carnegie Institution of Washington) ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 215 Copan dated by inscription to 376 CE in which two person ages attend the dedication of a stone monument pictured between them, their hands raised in gestures of conversation (Fig. 32).121 The paired-figure device was also carved in a circular monument of 435, a floor marker from the Motmot Structure (Fig. 33). In this panel, the seated figures of the founder and the second ruler of Copan address each other in the same way that Yax Pasaj sits opposite Yax K'uk' Mo' on the west side of Altar Q (Fig. 4).122 The Motmot marker was an especially significant dynastic relic, for it was cached within an early dynastic structure that preceded Structure 10L-26; even if the marker was inaccessible to patrons of Yax Pasaj's era, the use of the paired-figure motif on this monument signals its powerful associations with the antiquity of the Copan dynasty and the vocabulary of visual expression from the founder's era. Copan Structure 11 's carved bench panel extrapolated the device of the seated pair into a gathering of twenty figures, set ten-opposing-ten across a short inscription at the bench's centerline (Fig. 31). Other monuments carved during Yax Pasaj's reign did the same; these include Altars T and U, which?like Altar Q and the Structure 11 bench, as well as the Motmot marker and peccary skull made before them?com memorate events of royal accession.123 Altar Q considerably expanded the expressiveness of the old compositional device: the arrangement of seated figures in a volumetric spatial diagram seems to have been an invention peculiar to Altar Q. If the affronted pair was not unique to Altar Q neither was the broader Copanec interest in archaic motifs that Altar Q exemplifies particular to Yax Pasaj's reign. The earliest figurai sculptures of Copan and its region had closely emulated the forms of monuments carved at Tikal and its neighbors in the northern Peten; four centuries later, eighth-century works still cleaved to models from the same era.124 In the late seventh century, the lords of Copan found themselves too far from the center of lowland Maya kingship to assay a r??val uation of its ancestral forms; their monuments instead went about a redeployment of these reliquary devices of dynastic pedigree, as the local cultural contacts and material circum stances allowed bracing formal revision of their realization in stone. Altar Q expands the archaic motif of the affronted pair by wrapping the assembled kings around the volumetric form of the stone block and making them doubly legible: the zipper of dynasts ringing Altar Q's circumference is a band of hiero glyphic text no less than it is a figurative frieze. For all the animated gestures and occasional dangling leg of the dynas tic figures, the sense of reading, of textual space, is never absent from the sides of the monument. This, too, is a device drawn from the early art of the Copan dynasty and, beyond it, from the central Mexican visual tradition. On the Motmot panel, the seated kings' feet rest on hieroglyphs (Fig. 33). Inserted into the lower corners of the composition's figura tive fields, these glyphs are compositionally understated, though they provide palpable foot stops for the figures who converse above them. The meaning of these glyphs and their employment here remains uncertain, but they probably de note some place or identity with mythological associations.125 Like the longer text running around Altar Q's sides, these glyphs do not constitute a unified discursive statement; rather, pairs of glyphs relate specifically to the figure with whom they are juxtaposed. The text girding Altar Q's sides thus offers a kind of captioning device, a stuttering succession of identifying hi eroglyphic emblems. As the formula is deployed across the surfaces of Altar Q these caption texts give the appearance of the lowland Maya textual band?a unified ribbon of glyphs running inside a frieze, phonetic complements and all? though they are arguably closer to central Mexican traditions of figurative composition. The long frieze of hieroglyphically captioned figures is itself a Teotihuacanoid compositional motif; compositions featuring long lines of captioned figures or headdresses were common in the art of Teotihuac?n and its dependencies around Mesoamerica. In very rare instances, this compositional formula is found in seventh- and eighth century lowland Maya compositions that sought to invoke the cultural legacy of Teotihuac?n. In the best-known example, Piedras Negras Panel 2 (667 CE), a line of kneeling figures in Teotihuac?n costume is pictured below a string of name captions (Fig. 34).126 Despite the echo of the central Mexican visual formula, Piedras Negras Panel 2 retains the visual order of a lowland Maya composition, with the captioning text removed to glyphic panels and set above a unified pictorial and psychological space within a counterbalanced composi tion. Altar Q not only superimposes figures over hieroglyphs but also, and more important, presents text and image within a single compositional space, a usage derived more directly from the Teotihuac?n visual tradition's tendency to interpo late text and images across single compositional fields. More over, Altar Q's conjoining of figurative and textual composi</page><page sequence="23">216 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 30 Stela 11, Yaxchil?n, rear face (photo: Peabody Museum, Harvard University negative #1PA-IN20492) tion represents a pointed appropriation of ancestral usage. Such devices are found not only on the Motmot floor marker but also on the facade of the mid-fifth-century Margarita Structure buried deep beneath Structure 16, where large Teotihuacanoid glyphs lie beneath the feet of mythological birds (Fig. 35). Seated on their hieroglyphs, Altar Q's dynasts thus recall forms of writing and figurative composition that predated the lowlands' calligraphic preoccupations. The hieroglyphs themselves, substantial with weight and volumetric presence, recall forms from outside the lowland Maya realm. Despite the text's hale lowland Maya phoneticism?these are lowland Maya glyphic compounds on Altar Q's sides?the solid, weight-bearing forms of the dynasts' name tags bear little resemblance to the fluent tracery of contemporary Maya calligraphy. Rather, they work from the logic of the frame line and the bold, simplified iconographie medallions and hieroglyphic emblemata of the Teotihuac?n tradition. Altar Q's design invokes the notion of the glyph's assertive, self contained compositional presence, as do so many Maya hi eroglyphic texts, but in a departure from the lowland Maya calligraphic tradition, the Copanec authors of Altar Q did not break the frame line down into its constituent facture marks or complicate the glyphic outline beyond recognition. In stead, they chose to abandon the two-dimensional field of painting altogether, folding the glyph's hard, flat visual sub stance into the order of three-dimensional figurative illusion ism. Lowland Maya calligraphy invested hieroglyphic form with a palpable physicality of painterly marks; Altar Q's hi eroglyphs eschew such traces of painterly contrivance? brushwork and facture, the surface plane?in order to as sume the physical literalness of the visual representations they caption. While Altar Q's dynastic colloquy summons up the sociability of the lowland Maya gathering, the alliance of text and image on its sides effectively turns away from the calligraphic impulse of Maya visual tradition. Altar Q engages the cultural forms and preoccupations of the lowland Maya visual tradition, but these it repackaged and reconfigured as so many cultural found objects. Migration Narrative/Foundation Stone The four-sided ritual enclosure; the orderly ambit of dynastic civility; the uptake and re-presentation of foundational per sonages and visual motifs: these, too, are the guiding con cerns of Altar Q's upper surface (Figs. 6, 7). Arranged in a six-by-six grid of hieroglyphic blocks, the mathematically squared figure of Altar Q's upper inscription, no less than the quadrangular field in which it is set, restates the altar's larger principle of four-sided symmetry. The narrative that the in scription relates is pegged to principles of symmetry and return. Altar Q's inscription ties the deeds of Altar Q's patron in the 770s to the founding of the Copanec dynasty in the early fifth century by Yax K'uk' Mo'. The inscription first recounts the events allied with Yax K'uk' Mo's dynastic trans lation to Copan, including the performance of ceremonies before his departure for the Honduran center and the rituals by which he instituted kingship on his arrival there. The hieroglyphic account then shifts forward about three and a half centuries later, to events that transpired in the mid-770s. These actions include the dedication of Altar Q itself around an important calendar station that fell in late 775 and rituals of its patron, Yax Pasaj, several months later. In its opening passages, the inscription tells how Yax K'uk'</page><page sequence="24">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 217 31 Structure lOL-ll, Copan, carved bench (left side above, right side below). London, The British Museum (photo: ?Justin Kerr) Mo' performed a ritual scepter-taking event (literally, "he takes a scepter/effigy [k'awiil\") in early September 426 CE.127 In the Maya epigraphic record, acts of scepter taking are commonly associated with accession to kingship, and here, too, the event refers either to Yax K'uk' Mo's assump tion of royal authority or the equally significant translation of dynastic regalia to his person. The text cites the locus of this action with a partially deciphered hieroglyphic expres sion probably indicating something like a "dynastic-origin house/shrine [wi'te'naah]" (B2), a ritual structure associated with dynastic founders and the institution of rulership.128 Three days after the initial event of scepter taking, Yax K'uk' Mo' enacts another ritual at the "dynastic-origin house [wi'te'naah]" (A5).129 Given the close temporal proximity of these two initial rituals in the text, the second event may refer to a ritual of leave-taking performed at the shrine where the first ritual had occurred three days before.130 The next set of events takes place almost eight months later, in February 427.131 Altar Q's text here refers to a compound set of ritual actions. The first action resists decipherment, though it clearly involved a patron deity of rulership, K'awiil Ochk'in Kaloomte', or Overlord of the West (C3-C4), either the being itself or its representation in effigy. In this event, Yax K'uk' Mo' "arrives at and founds [juuliiy ?] " (C5) a place referred to as Uxwitik, "3-?" (D5). A pair of ritual events; an eight-month interim; ceremonies of god veneration and triumphal entry: Mayanist epigraphers are in general agreement that Altar Q's text describes the founder's migration to Copan and the foundation of ruler ship there. The Uxwitik locale, it is now assumed, refers to the site of the Copan Acropolis or some assemblage of an cestral buildings there. It is further agreed that Yax K'uk' Mo's "arrival" almost certainly refers to the founding of the Copan dynasty. This same scholarship amply demonstrates that Yax K'uk' Mo' was no local figure; the inscriptions and visual imagery identified with this figure persistently demon strate an attachment with the center Teotihuac?n, the giant city in a broad valley north of modern Mexico City. Though it remains one of the great archaeological enigmas of ancient Mesoamerica, scholars know that the Teotihuac?n culture was most active in the centuries leading up to 600 CE, and that during these years it was probably the greatest power in all of Mesoamerica. Overall, researchers are careful to point out the elusiveness of the figure's historical identity, for the personage was elevated to near-mythic status in Copanec art and epigraphy produced in the centuries following his death. Still, current scholarship on Yax K'uk' Mo' now overwhelm ingly favors his identification with Teotihuac?n, though the nature of this personage's affiliation with the distant central Mexican center?whether a Mexican prince or a Teotihua c?n-affiliated lord from lower Mesoamerica?remains the subject of debate.132 Altar Q's account of Yax K'uk' Mo's departure from an unknown "dynastic shrine [wi'te'naah]" of distant provenance and his subsequent arrival at Copan indi cates a translation of dynastic authority from his place of origin to the locus of the Copan Acropolis. This narrative of dynastic migration and translation is a common trope in the historiography of ancient Mesoamerica; narrative accounts of dynastic translation figure prominently in the inscriptions of Tikal and Palenque, to name but two important lowland Maya instances, and migration legends are also common among the dynastic annals of Oaxaca and central Mexico.133 Altar Q's text continues with rituals performed by Yax Pasaj, Altar Q's patron, many hundreds of years later. This section of the text opens with an expression that moves action three hundred and forty years (seventeen k'atuuns) forward, to acts surrounding the dedication and sacralization of Altar Q in 775 and 776. The implied anchors for this temporal shift are an epochal calendrical period ending (435 CE, or 9.0.0.0.0 in the Maya Long Count) only a few years after the events surrounding Yax K'uk' Mo's translation to Copan and an important calendrical jubilee (771 CE, or 9.17.0.0.0) celebrated during the reign of Altar Q's patron, Yax Pasaj. While the Maya calendar served as an exceedingly precise record-keeping device, here the terminal calendrical anniversaries, as well as the long span of years between them, are imprecise: Yax K'uk' Mo's deeds fell about nine or ten years before the earlier calendrical ending, Yax Pasaj's about four or five years after its three-hundred-and-fortieth anniver sary. Despite the Maya calendar's capacity for numerological specificity, the interest here is in general analogy rather than precise record keeping.

This interest in allying rulership with time and cosmos stands in full accord with the ceremonial and commemora tive practices of Maya dynastic kingship. Most rituals per formed by Maya kings were commemorative reenactments. This is particularly true of calendrical rites, ceremonies that were among the central acts of lowland Maya kingship, in which kings ritually reordered the universe, reaffirming and reinitiating the movement and cycles of time. These rituals were generally observed at twenty-year (k'atuun) intervals, or some significant multiple or fraction thereof, all in emulation and reenactment of the creation acts of primordial gods.134 Altar Q's dynastic narrative also observes the ordered repeti tion of the calendrical cycle, organizing parallel events of dynastic founding and commemoration according to the same logic of calendar-cycle jubilee events. By invoking the same logic of the timely ritual event, the progression of history, and the timelessness of cyclical return, Altar Q's narrative thus organizes the deeds and history of the Co panec dynasty according to the logic of larger cosmic history. Altar Q's inscription cites two events, five months apart, related to the monument's dedication and its patron's ac tions. First, Altar Qis "dedicated/raised up [ t'ab'ay] " (Fl) on December 25, 775.135 The expression is a passive verbal form employed in Maya texts in contexts of gift giving or the sanctification of gift exchange.136 As a passive form ("was raised up"), the t'ab'- expression glosses over giver and re ceiver, recognizing rather the importance of the object and the significance of its exchange. Implicated in this exchange, of course, are the dynastic founder and the living royal patron. The text cites the monument as "the ?-stone of Yax K'uk' Mo'" (E2-F2), specifically identifying the deceased founder as the possessor of the stone; to do so, the text employs the discursive formula of the "tag," language by which precious or esteemed things (jewels, ornaments, slaves) were assigned to owners.137 Moving on, the text also notes that the dedication of Altar Q occurred not directly by Yax Pasaj's?the living patron's?hand, but "under his aus pices [ukab'jiiy/uchab'jiiy]": "he is the cultivator" (E3). The uchab'jiiy- expression generally appears in Maya texts as a discursive formula that identifies an event's prime mover at the same time that it indicates that actor's removed authori ty.138 Its use here, another passing over of the living patron's agency, further foregrounds the presence of the ancestor. Altar Q's inscription goes on to state that Yax Pasaj "takes a scepter/effigy [k'awiil]" at Altar Q about two months later, in February 776.139 This last event reprises the initial "scepter taking" event performed by Yax K'uk' Mo' in 426. These two parallel ritual actions are the inscription's bookend events, and there is no doubt that the likeness of the founder and the patron was intended as the central organizing conceit of the narrative. Given the founder's abundant iconographie asso ciation with Teotihuac?n elsewhere in the Structure 16 en semble, it stands to reason, first, that the initial ritual cited in Altar Q's text was performed at the central Mexican center itself, and second, that Structure 16 represents a symbolic identification with this temporally and geographically distant center. The text's interest to see attention deflected from the living patron onto the mythohistoric founder at once lessens the role of Yax Pasaj as patronal prime mover, while also projecting his life and works into the founder's realm of mythohistoric narrative. Parallel actions, in turn, suggest analogous places: the like rituals (ch'am k'awiil, "scepter tak ing") performed by founder and patron implicitly equate</page><page sequence="26">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 219 33 Motmot floor marker, Copan (courtesy of Barbara W.

For in identifying Altar Q as belonging to the fifth-century dynastic founder, the in scription symbolically shifts the identity of the very monu ment. The monuments placed at Copan in the decades after the foundation of the dynasty, like the upper surface of Altar Q consisted of little more than dressed slabs covered in columns of "graphically elegant" inscriptions. Like Altar Q's upper surface, they are grids of text set within a square frame.141 Such a work was Stela 24 (485 CE), a fragmentary all-glyphic monument recovered early in 1916 from Copan Group 9, beneath the modern town of Copan Ruinas. An inscribed panel of glyphs bounded within a square frame, Stela 24 was the sort of ancestral monument recalled and mimicked by Altar Q's upper surface (Fig. 36).142 These works commemorated the lives of early dynasts, marking rituals they performed on the occasion of calendrical period endings. They celebrated the first Copanec dynasts by culti vating the rhetorical arts of lowland Maya divine kingship that was at these rulers' disposal?an elaborate system of cosmological ordering made palpable in lived experience of ritual and in the hard surfaces of hieroglyphic visual expres sion. Altar Q's inscription effectively presents the upper por tion of the monument as a reused relic, a monument of Yax K'uk' Mo' transposed in the 770s to the ritual locus before the founder's renovated shrine. Maya altars, we have seen, were constructions of ritually assembled goods. The reuse of early monuments in ritual contexts many years later is well documented in the archae ology of Copan.143 By Yax Pasaj's era, it was a relatively old practice. Here, Stela 24 is again instructive, for it remains one of the earliest documented examples of the employment of existing monuments in secondary ritual contexts.

The lip's superimposition over the seated figures, too, recalls the stack of ritually charged items that went into such an assemblage as Stela 7's cache. Altar Q and the Lowland Maya Tradition To Mayanist archaeologists of the mid-twentieth century, Co p?n's role as a bastion and outpost of the lowland Maya cultural system seemed as natural as the very process of social evolution the Copan Acropolis exemplified, the rise of civili zation itself: "A priest-ruler gazing down from the Copan Acropolis had much in common with, say, a prince-arch bishop of Salzburg contemplating the fast-flowing Salzach from his fortress palace high above it."145 So it seemed to archaeologist J. Eric S. Thompson in 1965. Archaeological research conducted since reveals that the cultural landscape Yax Pasaj saw from his residence at the center of the Copan pocket was no less complex than the folds and hollows along the valley walls. Yet the criteria of aesthetic judgment opera tive in Maya studies still cast Copanec monuments as sure signs of the their leadership's identity as exemplars of civili zation among the chiefs and big men of the Honduran uplands: "There is a formal and 'official' quality to the Classic Maya elite component at Copan. It bespeaks what was, for a time at least, a foreign presence, marking the boundary between the Classic Maya and the Central American cultural systems."146 Here I would agree that Altar Q forged the identity and history of the Copan dynasty as divinely sanc tioned strangers within the cultural landscape of western 37 Stela 7, Copan, substela dedication assemblage (Stela 24 at b) (drawing from Morley, The Inscriptions at Copan, fig. 12; courtesy Carnegie Institution of Washington) Honduras; but like its patrons, the monument?its thematic concerns, its rhetorical strategies, its formal devices?was at home here, and nowhere else, in the interaction sphere of the Maya lowlands. Altar Q and the tradition of monumental visual expression of which it was a part did not stake out the far boundary of high civilization in lower Mesoamerica so much as they offered a borderland in which to pursue the dynasty's transactions with the distant wellsprings of dynastic authority in the Maya lowlands, the highlands of Guatemala, and central Mexico. The level gazes of Altar Q's assembled kings staged the dynasty's integrity but only mirrored the Copanec rulership's complicated diplomatic engagements with their lesser Honduran clients and friends. The long career of the Copan dynasty represented some thing of a sustained cultural experiment, an ambitious de ployment of several Mesoamerican rhetorics of prestige. Its monuments, so it is argued here, arose from, rather than spoke above, the complicated life of culture and rulership in the Honduran uplands. From their borderland capital, these lords of the western Honduran uplands were eager to com mand, consume, and pass along the objects and legacies of the lowland Maya visual tradition. This is a process invoked with forthright literalness in the central gesture on Altar Q's west side, where the dynasty's fifth-century founding for eigner passes a relic?a burning dart or scepter?to the monument's eighth-century patron (Fig. 38).147 In their stew ardship of such reliquary devices of prestige drawn from wide afield in Mesoamerica, and in setting them in communica tion with more local cultural exigencies, the leadership of Copan presided over a "provincial" visual tradition, so many complexly individual products of cultural reallocation.

The works produced here reveal the distance of eighth-century Copan from the lowland Maya cities' cultural milieu, though perhaps their greatest suggestion is the historiographie artificiality of the larger lowland Maya monumental tradition itself.

Notes This research was supported by a National Endowment for the Humanities twelve-month research fellowship for college teachers, as well as research subvention from the Division of Art History, Southern Methodist University. I wish to acknowledge the Instituto Hondureno de Antropolog?a e Historia and thank its administrators and staff in Tegucigalpa and on-site at Copan. I also thank Arq. Ricardo Agurcia Fasquelle and the staff of the Asociaci?n Cop?n for their efforts to promote scholarship on Cop?n and the ancient Maya. I am grateful to The Art Bulletin editor Marc Gotlieb and two anonymous reviewers for their helpful comments. 1. K'inich Yax Pasaj, "Ruler 16," acceded June 28, 763 CE (9.16.12.5.17 in Copan Structure 11 wall texts), died after 820; Altar Q was dedi cated after February 27, 776 (terminal date in Altar Q dedication text 9.17.5.3.4). For the orthography of Classic Mayan expressions read from hieroglyphic texts, I adhere to the style guide presented in George Stuart, A Guide to the Style and Content of the Series, Research Reports on Ancient Maya Writing, special suppl., no. 15 (Washington, D.C.: Center for Maya Research, 1988). The decipherment of Maya hieroglyphic text remains incomplete, and spellings?particularly of logographic signs, long vowels, and certain consonants?will certainly change; I have chosen simplicity over linguistic transparency in follow ing the spelling employed in one of the most recent instances of care ful epigraphic scholarship widely available to a public readership, Si mon Martin and Nikolai Grube, Chronicle of the Maya Kings and Queens (London: Thames and Hudson, 2000). Maya Long Counts and Calen dar Round dates are rendered according to their Julian equivalents. Unless otherwise noted, hieroglyphic translations are my own. 2.

Altar Q's ruined supports have been the subject of glancing commen tary; in 1841, explorer John Lloyd Stephens noted that the altar "stands on four globes"; Stephens, Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan (1841; reprint, Washington, D.C.: Smithsonian Institution Press, 1993), 140-42. By the early twentieth century ar chaeologists noted that Altar Q was raised on four squat, "spherical" legs; Morley, The Inscriptions at Copan, 326-30. 5.

On nineteenth-century museum archaeology in Britain, see Ian Jen kins, Archaeologists and Aesthetes in the Sculpture Galleries of the British Mu seum, 1800-1939 (London: British Museum Press, 1992). The material was among the very first to be brought to the notice of the Anglo American public, by means of John Lloyd Stephens's engaging and superbly illustrated accounts of travel, which were best-sellers from the 1840s on. See Stephens, Incidents of Travel; and Frederick Cather wood, Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America, Chiapas, and Yuca tan (London: Vizetelly Bros., 1844). Later in the century, Cop?n's monuments were among the first to be systematically documented in the exacting and charismatic media of technical drawing, photogra phy, and plaster casts and to be published as a systematized corpus of works. See Maudslay, Biolog?a Centrali-Americana. By the 1880s Copan was the first Maya site to accommodate a large archaeological expedi tion from a North American university. See, for example, G. B. Gor don, Prehistoric Ruins of Copan, Honduras: Memoirs of the Peabody Mu seum of Archaeology and Ethnology 1, no. 1 (1896): 1-48.

Morley, one of the principal archi tects and exponents of the peaceful Maya civilization, cut his teeth among the ruins and monuments of Copan; Morley's early study of this material, The Inscriptions at Copan (1920), was among the earliest sustained scholarly articulations of the "peaceful" Maya civilization.

Copan's distance from the central capitals of the lowland Maya realm was noted early on; to explain the city's outlier status, scholars in voked a particularly Gilded Age logic of nations and territoriality, cen ter and periphery. Several of Maya archaeology's most important early practitioners had cut their teeth in the American Southwest; their thinking bore the imprint of William Henry Holmes's frontier docu mentarianism and Frederick Jackson Turner's sense of "the signifi cance of the frontier in American history." Holmes was instrumental in establishing the abiding concern for the cultural significance of native peoples' artistic and architectural endeavors in Maya studies. Mayanist archaeologists would invoke his work many decades after his death, including Linton Satterthwaite Jr., Piedras Negras Archaeology: Architecture, pt. 1, no. 1, Introduction (Philadelphia: University Museum, 1943), 31.

This aspect of Maya studies' historiography has been pointed out by David Webster, who addressed its implications for scholarly consideration of Copanec archaeology in "Copan as a Classic Maya Center," in Boone and Willey, The Southeast Classic Maya Zone, 5-31. The insight remains to be brought to a consideration of the monu mental arts; indeed, even into the late 1980s, the monumental art of Copan was invoked to stabilize a construct?Copan as a fortress of Classic Maya lowland civilization?then gravely threatened by archaeo logical undermining. 27.

Scholars also note abrupt shifts in the format and style of Copanec monuments over the dynasty's history, particularly in the eighth cen tury. See Schele and Friedel, A Forest of Kings, 337, and D. Stuart, "Hi eroglyphs and Archaeology of Copan," 197. 42. Yax Pasaj is recognized as the sixteenth successor on the architectural inscription of Copan Structure 11, Stela 8, and Altar Q. He was either the last recorded king of the Copanec ruling line or its penultimate exemplar; Copan Altar L (822 CE) may represent the accession of a royal successor to Yax Pasaj, a figure identified as Ukit Took'. The scene's identification as a royal accession is complicated, however, by the fact that accession references on Copanec monuments can refer to rituals of god veneration. 43. Yax Pasaj's mother is prominently noted on Copan Stela 8 and Altar U. Certain epithets used to describe Yax Pasaj in the epigraphic record of Copan employ formulas otherwise familiar from the epi graphic record of Palenque. See Linda Schele, "The Numbered K'atun Titles of Yax Pac," in Copan Note, no. 65 (Copan Ruinas, Hon duras: Copan Mosaics Projects and the Instituto Hondureno de Antropolog?a, 1989). See also D. Stuart, "Hieroglyphs and Archaeol ogy of Copan," 178-81. Certain prominent buildings in the Copan Acropolis appear to have consciously invoked architectural forms oth erwise specific to the distant Chiapanec center of maternal origin; see Karl Taube and Rhonda Taube, "The Palencano Presence at Copan during the Reign of Yax Pasaj," paper presented at the College Art Association Conference, Seattle, 2004. 44. On the royal residential compound, the Cemeterio Group, see E. Wyl lys Andrews, V. and Barbara W. Fash, "Continuity and Change in a Royal Maya Residential Complex at Copan," Ancient Mesoamerica 3 (1992): 63-87. It is also quite likely that a royal residence compound lay beneath the modern town of Copan Ruinas, given the recovery there of monuments and scattered inscriptions from Yax Pasaj's reign. 45.

Fash, Scribes, Warriors, and Kings, 67-71. 48. Instances of the its'aat title are remarkably numerous on the early monuments of Copan and its region. These instances include the Co pan Papagayo step; see William L. Fash et al., "The Hieroglyphic Stair way and Its Ancestors: Investigations of Copan Structure 10L-26," An cient Mesoamerica 3 (1992): 108-12. The Papagayo step inscription includes the its'aat title in a list of royal titles: k'uhul its'aat ch'ajom 'Co pan"-ajaw, "holy wise man, scatterer, Cop?n-dynasty lord." The step seems to refer as well to a pair of gods, the "paddlers," patrons of world creation and monument placement, as "wise ones [its'aat]" The title also appears on another work from the early fifth century, Copan Stela 63, that was cached in the Papagayo Structure of Structure 10L 26. See W. Fash et al., "The Hieroglyphic Stairway and Its Ancestors," 108-12; Stela 63's its'aat expression is unusually complex, for it is con flated with a "Hunahpu deity impersonation phrase;" see Karl Taube, "Tetitla and the Maya Presence at Teotihuac?n," in The Maya and Teotihuac?n: Reinterpreting Early Classic Interaction, ed. Geoffrey Braswell (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2003), 286, fig. 11.8d. Quiligua Stela U (480 CE) and Monument 26 (493 CE) carry inscriptions with the its'aat title; see Matthew Looper, "The Sculpture Programs of Butz'-Tiliw, an Eighth-Century Maya King of Quirigua, Guatemala"</page><page sequence="32">ALTAR Q, COPAN, HONDURAS 225 (PhD diss., University of Texas at Austin, 1995), 35-44; see also idem, Lightning Warrior: Maya Art and Kingship at Quirigua (Austin: University of Texas Press, 2003), 39-50. The its'aat title also occurs on the in scribed inner step of Copan Structure 10L-22 (715 CE), where it re fers either to a ruler of the site or a patron god; see D. Stuart, "Hiero glyphs and Archaeology at Copan," 175. 49. Alfredo Barrera V?squez, Diccionario Maya Cordemex (M?rida: Corde mex, 1980), 110. 50. Ibid., 273. On the epigraphic decipherment of its'aat, see David S. Stuart, "The Maya Artist: An Epigraphic and Iconographie Study" (bachelor's thesis, Princeton University, 1989), 18-22. The list of no ble leaders and "wise men" extends to others as well. By tradition, the rulers of several centers in the southeastern Pet?n bore the epithet among their royal titles, as evidenced by inscriptions on a looted panel from Cancu?n in Cob?n (K3), Sacul Stela 1 (C6-C8), Sacul Stela 9 (G1-G3); on Sacul's monuments, see Karl Herbert Mayer, The Stelae and Inscriptions of Sacul, Guatemala, Mexicon Occasional Publica tions, vol. 1 (Berlin: Von Flemming, 1990). The late kings of Seibal even carried the epithet k'uhul its'aat, "holy learned one" (on Seibal Stelae 1, 6, 7) an honorific that offers an interesting parallelism to the traditional title of kings, k'uhul ahaw, "holy lord" (on Seibal Stela 7, A4, B7). B'alam Ajaw, a seventh-century king of the western low land polity of El Tortuguero, was recorded to have been "seated" as an its'aat in March 680 (Tortuguero Wooden Box, G'-H'); this event fell about seven months after his death, and this ruler's postmortem assumption of the title shows that the its'aat epithet held ritual and supernatural significance. Michael D. Coe first published the wooden box in his article "A Carved Wooden Box from the Classic Maya Civili zation," in Robertson, Primera Mesa Redonda de Palenque, pt. 2, 51-58. Noble warriors also bore the title its'aat; Chak Suuts', "Red Bat," a Palenque noble whose several martial victories over the course of the 720s were recorded on the Palenque Tablet of the Slaves, bore the title its'aat, as shown on a glyph from Temple XVIII; Bodega no. 453 in Linda Schele and Peter Mathews, The Bodega of Palenque, Chiapas, Mexico (Washington, D.C.: Dumbarton Oaks, 1979). An inscribed panel produced at Tonina in 799 embedded the its'aat title within a long string of epithets that run the gamut of kingly legitimacy, de scribing "Ruler 8" of Tonina with an encyclopedic list of appositives: "60-year ruler, wise-man lord, he of nine captives, sun-faced ?-caterpil lar, divine Tonina ruler [ux k'atuun its'aat ajaw, aj b'olon-b'aak k'inich }-Chapat k'uhul "Tonin?"-o/W|."

Viel, "The Early Classic Copan Landscape: A View from the Preclassic," 17 28, and Loa Traxler, "Redesigning Copan: Early Architecture of the Polity Center," 55, in Bell et al., Understanding Early Classic Copan. Wil liam L. Fash also speculates that an earlier dynasty may have had its center at a site in the Copan valley removed from the locus of the Acropolis; Fash, "Dynastic Architectural Programs: Intention and De sign in Classic Maya Buildings at Copan and Other Sites," in Houston, Function and Meaning in Classic Maya Architecture, 226 n. 2.

Clancy, "The Compositions and Con texts of the Classic Stelae at Copan and Quirigua," in Boone and Willey, The Southeast Classic Maya Zone, 196-97. Stela 35's dynastic im agery and style recall monuments carved about or before 9.0.0.0.0 (435 CE) in the Toledo District of Belize, such as Uxbenka Stela 11; see Phil Wanyerka, "The Carved Monuments of Uxbenka, Toledo Dis trict, Belize," Mexicon 18, no. 2 (1996): 31-32. The monument may also be related to other early works, such as the Leyden Plaque; see Barbara W. Fash, "Early Classic Sculptural Development at Copan," in Bell et al., Understanding Early Classic Copan, 253. 52. See the important commentary on these works by David S.

Aoyama notes the trading of Ixtepeque obsidian cores as one of the Copanec leadership's means of firming up alliances, in Ancient Maya State, Urbanism, Exchange, and Craft Spe cialization, 177. This is a model of elite interaction and gift giving now applied more widely in the Maya area: "[Lowland Maya divine kings] created bonds with local leaders by sharing exotic goods and their company with them, thus giving up some of their symbolic capital of difference to create what might be called an imagined regional elite community that would have helped to solidify the political and eco nomic relationships that were central to the polity's existence;" Jason Yaeger, "The Social Construction of Communities in the Classic Maya Countryside: Strategies of Affiliation in Western Belize," in The Archae</page><page sequence="33">226 ART BULLETIN JUNE 2005 VOLUME LXXXVII NUMBER 2 ology of Communities: A New World Perspective, ed.

A version of the expression also appears in the inscription on the sarcophagus cover (glyph 14) of the Palenque Temple of the Inscriptions (683 CE). The similarity in hieroglyphic terminology used to refer to Altar Q and to the Palenque sarcophagus speaks to the two works' symbolic and ritual association with the res urrection and deification of deceased dynasts. 86.

As an animated personifica tion, the device may represent the divinity or a different supernatural property of its stone material. On other forms and employments of the device, see Nikolai Grube and Linda Schele, "Tzuk in the Classic Maya Inscriptions," Texas Notes on Precolumbian Art, Writing, and Culture 14 (September 1991). The tzuk reading remains uncertain, and the sign may have the phonetic value tsu.

Stuart et al., 191. A bench of Temple 11 offered particularly important imagery of seating; see Schele and M. Miller, The Blood of Kings, 124-26. Two dei ties that received special favor appeared on several monuments: one, its name provisionally translated as Yax K'am Lay, was "seated" in 780 in a ritual whose enactment and anniversary would be commemorated on several monuments; another, Yajaw Chan Aj B'aak, was recorded as having been ritually "nurtured" or "suckled" with sacrificial blood by Yax Pasaj's mother, in the manner of rulers in her home city. Yax Pasaj's mother is linked to Yajaw Chan Aj Baak with the uhuntan ("child of mother") expression that is found relating Palenque ruler Ran B'alam to his patron gods in the inscriptions of the Palenque Group of the Cross. On these and other inscriptions relating to god veneration in the Cross Group, see Stephen D. Houston, "Symbolic Sweatbaths of the Maya: Architectural Meaning in the Cross Group at Palenque," Latin American Antiquity 7, no. 2 (1996): 132-51. The Palenque woman appears with Yajaw Chan Aj Baak on Copan Altar U (K4-N1), in whose inscription Yax K'am Lay also figures prominently. The earliest notice of Yax K'am Lay was Linda Schele, "The Brother of Yax Pac," Cop?n Note (Copan Mosaics Projects and the Instituto Hondureno de Antropolog?a, Honduras), no. 20 (1987); see also Schele and Freidel, A Forest of Kings, 331-34. 106.

Karl Taube argues that Altar Q's founder holds a burning dart, an allusion to the founder's fiery immolation and resurrection as a solar being, while the fifteen Copanec dynasts hold paper torches symbolic of their ritual acts of fire starting and the "passing of the torch" of dynasty. See Taube, "Structure 10L-16 and Its Early Classic Anteced ents," 266-68.

The relation of Altar Q's sides to burial iconography is emphasized by William Fash and Karl Taube; see n. 109 above. Altar Q's sides also recall figures placed on the four walls of tombs in the western Maya lowlands, as in the crypt of the Palenque Temple of the Inscriptions (Merle Greene Robertson, The Sculpture of Palenque, vol. 1, The Temple of the Inscriptions [Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1983], 75-89) and at El Tortuguero (Frans Blom, "Las ruinas del Tortuguero," Eth nos, 2nd ser., 1, no. 1 [1923]: 77-78). 116.

On the peccary skull, see Spinden, A Study of Maya Art, 151; Morley, The Inscriptions at Copan, 379-81; and Longyear, Copan Ceramics, 40-41 (Tomb 1). Even if the inscribed peccary skull is a retrospective scene produced in the seventh or eighth century, it posits an unmis takable association of the paired figures with ancestral imagery all the same. 122. On the Motmot floor marker, see W. Fash, "Dynastic Architectural Programs," 227-29. David Stuart has long drawn the parallel between the Motmot floor marker and Altar Q's figurai composition (personal communication with the author, 1995). The carved markers of the Copan ball court also employed the motif of the affronted pair. See Baudez, Maya Sculpture of Cop?n, 158-66. 123. On Copan Altars T and U, affronted divinities appear with inscrip tions that celebrate the anniversary of Yax Pasaj's accession. See Schele and Freidel, A Forest of Kings, 332-34. See also n. 104 above. 124. Flora S. Clancy, "Compositions and Contexts of the Classic Stelae," 196-97. 125. Similar hieroglyphs were also used in eighth-century lowland Maya depictions of ancestors in tombs, such as Piedras Negras Stela 40. The motif of the ancestor holding a glyph is also a common one in the lowland Maya tradition, though as yet underresearched. 126.

This event is recorded with the little-understood taal- expres sion, recently glossed by D. Stuart, "The Beginnings of the Copan Dy nasty," 235, as "he comes from there." 130. A text on Quirigua Zoomorph P also records these early rituals of Yax K'uk' Mo'; on this monument, the text cites the two respective actions as a "scepter taking [ch am]" and a "monument placement [ts'apaj tuun]." See Looper, "The Sculpture Programs of Butz'-Tiliw." 131. Copan Altar Q C1-D5: 5 Ben 11 Muan (8.19.11.0.13, or February 8, 427). 132. Clemency C.

This reading is by David Stuart and Houston, cited in Taube, The Writ ing System of Teotihuac?n, 26. Taube, 45-47, notes the use of the uchab'jiiy/ukab'jiiy expression in dedication inscriptions of stone monu ments to indicate patronal action. 139. Copan Altar Q E6-F6: 5 Kan 13 Pop (9.17.5.3.4, or February 27, 776). 140. For instance, Copan Stela J, the inaugural monument of the thir teenth dynast of Copan, records the patron's accession as a "receiving of Yax K'uk' Mo' [ch'am k'inich Yax K'uk' Mo']" an expression that probably indicates some sort of handling or manipulation of an effigy of the founder by the incoming king. Stela J's text goes on to extrapo late these echoing ceremonies forward and backward in time: the in scription cites period-ending ceremonies in the deep past of a previ ous creation and prophesies rituals set to occur in the distant future. What results is an elaborate reckoning of dynastic bequest, mythologi cal precedent, and prophetic future. On Stela J's complex inscription, see Morley, Inscriptions at Copan, 194-204; J. Eric S.
