The data under discussion pertain to FEV1 and FVC measurements in smoking and in nonsmoking groups of grain-elevator workers in British Columbia and of workers in Vancouver City Hall. Initial observations have now been enriched by longitudinal follow up data on the same groups after three and after six years. It is shown that interesting selection phenomena, favouring "fit" individuals, take place over time, with regard both to lung symptoms and lung functions. Thus cross-sectional and longitudinal studies refer to somewhat different populations. It also appears that longitudinal studies are considerably more sensitive to identifying cumulative lung damage than are corresponding cross-sectional studies. The nonlinearity of the effect of age on lung functions is noted in the longitudinal data in a number of cases, lending support to the hypothesis of association between quadratic age effect and cumulative exposure to lung insults. RESUME On cherche ' interpreter des mesures de fonctions pulmonaires dans les travailleurs industriels. Les donn6es sont des mesures de FEV, (volume d'air maximum expire en une seconde) et de FVC (volume d'air maximum expire en total) provenant de fumeurs et de non-fumeurs travaillant en grain ou dans les bureaux civiques de la Cite de Vancouver. Les donn6es initiales ont 6t6 enrichies par des observations longitudinales sur ces memes groupes apris trois et apris six ans. On peut indiquer un ph6nomene interessant de sel1ection qui favorise les individus en meilleure sant6 pulmonaire. II est donc vraisemblable que les enquetes "en profil" et les enquetes longitudinales se rapportent a des populations plus ou moins diff6rentes. I1 parait aussi que les etudes pulmonaires longitudinales sont bien plus sensibles a la detection de d6t6rioration pulmonaire cumulative. On note que dans le- donn6es longitudinales, l'effet de l'age sur les fonctions pulmonaires est souvent non-lin6aire. Cet effet d'age carre parait etre associd avec une histoire d'exposition a des agents nocifs. 1. INTRODUCTION In a recent paper (Schulzer, Chan-Yeung, and Tan 1982) we described some of the relationships which we observed between standard lung-function measurements (FEV1, FVC) in certain groups of individuals and the commonly considered variables of height and age. These observations were taken on a large number of occupational workers in a variety of industries and working environments in British Columbia.</page><page sequence="2">8 SCHULZER, ENARSON, and CHAN-YEUNG Vol. 13, No. 1 We indicated there that, after suitable linear adjustments for anthropomorphic variations (height), the residual age relationship to these lung-function measurements might reflect exposure effects due to cumulative environmental pollution (industrial fumes or dusts, smoking). In particular, it appeared that a quadratic age effect was present in certain exposure groups, over and above the commonly observed linear age effect in groups of "normal" nonsmoking controls. We pointed out that our conclusions were hampered by the fact that the data were cross-sectional in nature, and that prospective longitudinal studies were needed to verify such findings and to amplify our understanding and inter- pretation of them. We have since gathered longitudinal data over a six-year period on two of the groups considered previously, and we feel that some of the results of our analysis of this new information may be of interest to the reader. 2. DATA Our longitudinal data were obtained on grain-elevator workers on city-hall workers, both of which groups participated in our original cross-sectional study. In the case of the grain workers, the data were first gathered in 1975, then again in 1978, and finally in 1981. In the case of the city-hall workers, the initial data were obtained in 1976, then in 1979, and finally in 1982. The data gathered included medical and occupational questionnaires, spirometry, allergy skin tests, and chest x-ray. The same methodology and staff were used in obtaining all of the information. The worker participation rate was of the order of 92 to 95% throughout. The data gathering followed the description given in Schulzer, Chan-Yeung, and Tan (1982). 3. TERMINOLOGY We define survivors as those individuals who participated in all three time studies for a given group in their respective employment. Nonsurvivors were no longer present at the third study. Survivors are labelled current smokers (CS) when they remained smokers throughout the study period; similarly for nonsmokers (NS). Nonsurvivors are labelled CS or NS according to their smoking status at the initial time study; they are considered only at that time. "Ex-smokers" are not considered here, since they form a highly heterogenous group. Grain workers are often referred to as Gr, city-hall workers as CH. 4. ANALYSIS OF RESULTS Table 1 summarizes some of the relevant sample sizes and means of height-adjusted FEV1s, FVCs, and ages. In all of the analyses which follow, FEVI and FVC have been adjusted linearly for height in the presence of age, specifically for each group, as in Schulzer, Chen-Yeung, and Tan (1982). 4.1. Survivors vs Nonsurvivors. The identification of individuals as survivors after termination of the third time study enables us to return to the initial cross-sectional analyses at the first time study and to look for any specific characteristics of the survivors. To examine the relative levels of the survivors' lung-function measurements, we com- pared them with the expected values based on the initial data for the total group. Thus, the cross-sectional height, age, and (age)2 regression of FEVy and FVC at the initial study on the entire group was used for comparison with observed values of the survivors at the</page><page sequence="3">1985 LUNG-FUNCTION MEASUREMENTS 9 TABLE 1: Data in initial survey.

The frequency of outliers among the survivors' FEVI readings (below the 15th percentile for their height and age or above the 85th percentile) is exhibited in Table 2. Note that surviving grain workers show a significant tendency upward, towards higher lung-function values, seen among current-smoker survivors even at the initial study. No similar trends are found in the CH groups, although the samples are too small to draw firmer conclusions. We also noted a uniformly higher prevalence of chest symptoms (cough, phlegm, wheeze, chest tightness, dyspnea) among the nonsurvivors than among the survivors, particularly among smoking grain workers (e.g. 20% vs. 36% wheeze, 9% vs. 26% chest tightness, respectively in the two groups). There is thus a suggestion of selection towards work survival, favouring the "fit" individuals. Figure 1 illustrates that even the non- smoking CH "controls" seem to undergo a similar selection process. 4.2 Longitudinal Analyses. An important advantage in analyzing longitudinal data is the possibility of referring to the considerably smaller errors between successive observations on the same individuals. In cross-sectional surveys, observational errors, intra- and interindividual errors are com- pounded. A good description of the advantages accrued from longitudinal lung studies is given in Berry (1974). In our case, only three observations, approximately equally spaced, three years apart, were available on each surviving individual. This meant that we might gain a considerable advantage by using the longitudinal data in a height-age linear model over a corresponding cross-sectional model, the one commonly used in current practice. However, to examine nonlinear age effects, ordinary regression methods could yield no error estimate for the purpose of inference (only one parabola may be drawn through three points). Thus, indirect methods had to be employed to examine the (age)2 effects.</page><page sequence="4">10 SCHULZER, ENARSON, and CHAN-YEUNG Vol. 13, No. 1 700 600 " 500- S400 al 4survivors 300 non-survivors UL 200- 100- 0 I I I I I I I I I I 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Age FIGURE 1: Height-adjusted FEV, regressed cross-sectionally (at initial survey) linearly on age, for "survivors" (solid line) and for "nonsurvivors" (broken line) among city-hall nonsmokers.

(a) Linear age effects. A variety of covariance analyses was applied, examining individual effects, height effects, and age effects, and comparing the four groups (Gr/NS, Gr/CS, CH/NS, and CH/CS) in terms of age effects and possible smoking-employment interactions. The exact age at the time of each observation was used. For comparison, similar height-age linear analyses were carried out cross-sectionally on the initial time data on all individuals present initially, as well as on the survivors. Table 3 presents some of the results, including some typical error estimates. These are in close accord with the ones given in Berry (1974). The estimated regression lines obtained cross-sectionally for the survivors only, resembled corresponding longitudinal lines more closely than did the lines based on the entire groups of individuals. However, significance tests on survivor cross-sectional data were anal- ogous to those on the total cross-sectional groups. It may also be noted that the cross- sectional age coefficients tend to be smaller (steeper) than the corresponding longitudinal ones. This phenomenon is described by Glindmeyer et al. (1982). Figure 2 illustrates two of the significantly different FEVI lines, based on the longitudinal data, for CH/NS and Gr/NS respectively. The cross-sectional linear age analysis fails to find a difference between these two groups. (b) Nonlinear age effects We attempted to detect nonlinear effects of age on FEVI and FVC in the longitudinal data in a number of ways. A simple, descriptive parabola can be fitted to such a set of data</page><page sequence="6">12 SCHULZER, ENARSON, and CHAN-YEUNG Vol. 13, No. 1 700 600 x -o 500 () A-' 1 400 300 LU U- 200 100 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Age FIGURE 3: Estimated longitudinal parabola of height-adjusted FEV1 on age in current smoking grain workers: FEV1(ht.-adj.) = 5125.4 + 511.5 x age - 7.35 x (age)2. 700- 600- -0 500 4) 3000- LU 6 years later U- 200- 100 - 0 I I I I I I I I I I 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 Age FIGURE 4: FEV1 (height-adjusted) related linearly to age in current smoking grain workers ("survivors"), initially (solid line) and at the end of the study 6 years later (broken line).

Figure 3 shows such a parabola for FEVls of the Gr/CS group, based on the three observations per individual. The curvature does not appear to be negligible. We gained another indication that age was affecting some of the measurements non- linearly by calculating separate linear-age regressions cross-sectionally on a given survivor group at different time-study points. Such lines should remain the same (or at least parallel) at successive time studies. Instead, we observed increasing steepness with study time in most instances. Figure 4 illustrates this for FEVI in Gr/CS survivors at the initial and final (6 years) time points. The slopes are significantly different (p = 0.008). This suggests a more than linear effect of age. We also examined the rates of FEV, and FVC change per individual over successive time periods. These were significantly related to age in Gr/CS (FEV, p = 0.0001; FVC p = 0.0000), in CH/CS (FEVI p =0.03; FVC p = 0.05), and less so in Gr/NS (FEV, p = 0.06; FVC p = 0.07). No significant relationships to (age)2 were observed in the rates. This gives at least a crude indication that age has a quadratic (but not cubic) effect on FEV, in many instances, in agreement with our initial cross-sectional observations in Schulzer, Chan-Yeung, and Tan (1982). A rough estimate of nonlinearity was further obtained by calculating individual second divided differences in the various groups. Submitting these tentatively to simple z-tests for each of the four groups, the means for the FEV1s were highly significantly negative in Gr/NS and Gr/CS (p = 0.003 and 0.001 respectively), and significantly negative in CH/CS (p = 0.05). FVC second differences showed the same trends, but did not attain statistical significance. 5. DISCUSSION Lung-function data (FEVI, FVC) are usually examined cross-sectionally, adjusted lin- early for height and for age, either on the basis of some standard reference population or directly from the data. We indicated in a previous paper (Schulzer, Chan-Yeung, and Tan 1982) that cross-sectional studies in certain groups of individuals showed a significant quadratic age effect, particularly in certain smoking groups and certain occupational exposure groups, and that this nonlinear departure from the "normal" might have some biological significance as well. We have now been able to follow two occupational groups (grain-elevator and city-hall workers) over a 6-year period, obtaining three successive lung-function measurements on each individual, three years apart. On the strength of these longitudinal observations we note some interesting differences between those individuals who remain at work for at least six years ("survivors") and those who leave sooner. The general conclusion appears to be that survivors tend to have better lung-function measurements for their height and age, as well as fewer chest symptoms, particularly among smoking grain workers. This suggests that selection processes may well be present which result, in fact, in different populations in cross-sectional and in longitudinal studies. Indeed, the progressive withdrawal from the work area of the "less fit" individuals leads to the "fitter" ones dominating the longitudinal picture. However, this same attrition process may also lead to some underrepresentation of the "less fit" individuals in cross-sectional studies, due to the well-known "inspection paradox" (Feller 1966, p. 185). It is therefore likely that many studies tend to underestimate the effects of exposure.</page><page sequence="8">14 SCHULZER, ENARSON, and CHAN-YEUNG Vol. 13, No. 1 We find, however, that longitudinal observations permit a more sensitive analysis of the effects of age (which may be a surrogate for exposure duration) on lung-function mea- surements. In fact, cross-sectional (age-linear) comparisons can only establish a signifi- cantly steeper FEV, age slope in current smoking grain workers than in nonsmokers in that occupation. Longitudinal analysis, on the other hand, shows far more. It separates the four groups investigated, by order of severity of age-effect on FEV1, into CH/NS (least severe), Gr/NS together with CH/CS (more severe but not separable), and Gr/CS (most severe), and in terms of FVC, into CH/NS, Gr/NS with Gr/CS, and CH/CS. Even on a linear basis, partly due to the smaller errors involved in the analyses, more sensitive results can thus be obtained by use of longitudinal data. We also have been able to show a potentiating effect on age between exposure and smoking, beyond their additive effects on the age slope. Further, we find by indirect methods that a quadratic age effect is present longitudinally in some of the groups, taking an increasing toll on lung functions. Such longitudinal nonlinearity has generally not been looked for in other studies, or, when detected, has been "adjusted" away rather than examined (Sparrow et al 1982). The nonlinearity is particu- larly pronounced in grain workers, especially smokers. Some nonlinearity seems to be present also in the current smoker city-hall workers. 6. CONCLUSIONS By comparing cross-sectional with longitudinal lung-function data in smoking and nonsmoking grain-elevator and city-hall workers, we conclude that there are significant differences in the lung health status of individuals who remain on the job and those who leave. In particular, in most cases, the "fit" tend to stay on. This introduces an important selection bias into such studies. Furthermore, we demonstrate that longitudinal studies are more sensitive to age effects in different groups, since they introduce a smaller error (intrapersonal) than the common cross-sectional approaches of similar sample sizes. In particular, longitudinal analysis provides a strong indication that smoking and grain work both seem to be associated with a more rapid rate of lung-function decline with age. Considerably weaker findings can be observed on a cross-sectional basis. A number of analyses on the longitudinal data further suggest that the quadratic age effect suspected by us previously is, indeed, present to a marked degree, in particular in smokers and in grain workers, among the "survivors". Additional time observations are needed. This would permit a more systematic analysis for the quadratic effect of age, allowing an error estimate to be calculated. It would also permit other age-specific examinations of the data. At this point it does appear, however, that a quadratic age effect of significance is present in certain longitudinal data groups, and seems to mirror the effects of cumulative insults to the lungs.
