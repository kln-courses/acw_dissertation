Stuttgart, September 201 1 #1 Late Neolithic inhumations in circular pits in the southern plain of the Upper Rhine - A comparative study based on the anthro- pological evidence from Didenheim / Morschwiller-le-Bas Amelie Sophie Alterauge, Jennifer Karl, Ursula Wittwer-Backofen Freiburg University, Medical Faculty, Physical Anthropology, Freiburg, Germany. amelie.alterauge@googlemail.com We present the results of the anthropological analysis of nine individuals buried in circular pits at Didenheim / Morschwiller-le-Bas, Alsace, France. By combining age and sex determination methods developed and used in Germany and France, we met the requirements of a binational collaboration and lay the foundations for a standardized meta-analysis. We aimed to compare the obtained data with other late Neolithic burial complexes in the southern plain of the Upper Rhine in order to reveal recurrent patterns in the selection of age-based burial combinations. The regional corpus allows us to distinguish between single and multiple burials and - by including our anthropological data - between multiple burials consisting of several subadults or adults being buried with one or more children. The burial position of the skeletons does not only indi- cate the simultaneity of the inhumations but may also attest the social relation between the indi- viduals. It seems that the individuals ' positioning in the pit happened predominantly on purpose and was done with care. However, there are also pits with individuals in disordered positions. Anthropology may shed light on the underlying causes for the skeletal disordered position, be it taphonomic processes or intended burial customs. Due to our analysis, we agree with Jeunesse (2010) that the inhumations in so called silo- pits are a region-specific burial practice that - owing to the absence of cemeteries - was open to all age and sex classes.

The aim of this study is to explore the HLA DQ variability in three populations liv- ing in the same Ecuadorian rain forest environment and subjected to the same environmental stress, mainly O. volvulus. Several researches over the years have indicated the influence of HLA class II alleles in the nematode infections and recently, the presence of a correlation between certain allelic variants of these genes and changes in clinical manifestations of the disease caused by O. volvulus was highlighted in Africans. These evidences have clearly indi- cated that the HLA-D variants may influence the infection by O. volvulus and that they are therefore useful to define a state that may reflect genetic protective immunity or susceptibil- © 201 1 E.

International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts ity. Two HLA class II loci (HLA DQA1 and HLA DQB1) of 263 unrelated individuals from three Ecuadorian populations (Chaci and Tsachilas Indians and African Ecuadorians) have been analyzed. HLA high resolution typing was performed by direct Sequencing (Sequence Based Typing, SBT). Differences in HLA DQ gene frequencies have been observed among the ethnic groups of the Ecuadorian population. The comparison among populations shows the key role of several HLA DQA1 alleles in susceptibility and protection to river blindness. Interestingly, the allele DQA1 *0401 is negatively associated with onchocerciasis among both Chaci and Afroecuadorians, and in spite of two different alleles seem to be linked to disease: HLA DQA1*0102 in Afroecuadorians and HLA DQA 1*0301 in Chaci. These results are compared with a neighbor population, the Tsachilas, for which the incidence of river blind- ness is actually arising because both the presence of the arthropod vector and immigration of infected people from Esmeraldas focus. #3 Sex differences in Body composition of 7-17 years old school- children from Arkhangelsk A. Anisimova, N. Svistunova Institute and Museum of Anthropology, Moscow State University, Moscow, Russia. ania_83@mail.ru Studying of body mass composition is one of the most interesting problems of modern auxo- logy. The aim of the present study is to find out sex differences in fat (FM), muscular (MM) and lean (LM) body mass growth curves in Russian boys (684) and girls (769) 7-17 years old from the city of Arkhangelsk, Russia. Body mass components were evaluated by BIA (a tetra polar multi-frequency system ABC-01 Medass). Also we analyzed total body parameters and percentages of body mass components in body mass. The results show that the growth curves of height and weight have a typical shape. Boys are taller, the differences are significant starting from 14 years. Girls are heavier, the differ- ences are significant starting from 15 years. BMI during this age interval does not show sig- nificant sex differences. Girls have significantly higher FM, starting from 12 years. Boys have significantly higher LM and MM, LM starting from 14 years, MM - at almost all ages. In girls %FM increases during this age interval, while %LM decreases, %MM increases till 12 years, then decreases. In boys %MM increases during the studied age interval, while %FM increases and %LM decreases till 1 1 years, then they change direction. #4 Ethology of the Arts - the Presentation of a New Venture Gerhard Apfelauer, Johanna Forster, Christian Lehmann, Wulf Schiefen- hövel, Christa Siitterlin Max-Planck Institute (Human Ethology) Andechs, Germany. gerhard.apfelauer@web.de Artistic behavior as a universal appearance since earliest human history shifted into the focus of interest within evolutionary sciences of the past two decades. Archaeological evidences of artistic creativity gave reason to speculate about similarities of form and function on common human grounds, while the evolution of cultural diversity remained a subject of argument in the hands of the humanities. There, the argument of human mental autonomy is still defended. To explain artistic evolution and diversity in terms of evolutionary adaptations can be seen as a more recent challenge. To be a good singer and dancer, a convincing storyteller and a skilful painter, must have been of many advantages for early Homo. The argument is well established in evolutionary biology. To elaborate objects or events, which exceed daily purpose by qualities of opulence, accuracy, originality or size, are in the fame of special pow- ers. And to dispose of skills and human resources that aren't restricted to necessities, give evi-</page><page sequence="3">9.

Universal human tendencies to perceive, feel, think and behave, based on phylogenetic adaptations to social and natural environment, are first postulated in our approach. Cultural and historic diversifications on the matrix of which all research for universais has to be exposed, are a further level for explaining adaptive functionality in artistic performance in terms of cultural advancement and change. #5 Statistical comparison of human growth modelling: Bayesian approaches and out-of-sample criteria Christian Aßmann National Educational Panel Study, Otto-Friedrich-Universität Bamberg, Bamberg, Germany. christian.assmann@uni-bamberg.de A large variety of approaches are documented within the empirical literature aiming at a modeling of the human growth curve. Next to approaches based on spline curves, alternative dynamics autoregressive model approaches are at hand. Augmented by measures controlling for individual tempo, these models provide different non nested characterizations of the human growth curve. Since large panel data sets collecting longitudinal data on growth are despite tremendous efforts in field work almost inevitably plagued by missing data, for exam- ple, due to item non response, estimation and model comparison has to consider the develop- ment of appropriate multiple imputation techniques, which allow for valid inferences incor- porating the uncertainty about missing values. Sequential regression modelling is a wide- spread approach to generate multiple imputed data sets. The structure of multiple imputation algorithms is well suited for incorporation in MCMC and thus Bayesian estimation algo- rithms providing the analysis of primary interest. This paper implements two approaches to perform non nested model comparison of alter- native human growth models. Based on the development MCMC estimation methodology, model comparison is based on the marginal likelihood. For calculation of the marginal likeli- hood the approach of Chib (1995) is adapted to cope with missing values in the explaining variables. In addition, model comparison is based on the posterior forecasting approach allowing for comparison of non nested models within a cross validation experiment based on pseudo out-of-sample criteria. The accuracy of both approach for model comparison is assessed within a simulation study. Applying the approaches to several data sets covering dif- ferent periods of human growth development reveals the adequacy of both modeling approaches depending on the given data. #6 Microevolution of mandible in the area of Central Europe during the latest 1200 years using methods of 3D geometric morphometries Šárka Bejdová1, Václav Krajíček1,2, Jana Velemínská1, Martin Horák3, Přemysl Bejda4, Petr Velemínský5 department of Anthropology and Human Genetics , Faculty of Science, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic, department of Software and Computer Science Educa- tion, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic, department of Radiology, Hospital Na Homolce, Prague, Czech Republic, department of Probability and Mathematical Statistics, Faculty of Mathematics and Physics, Charles University in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic, 5National Museum Prague, Prague, Czech Republic. sarka.bejdova@seznam.cz</page><page sequence="4">488 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts The developmental mandible changes are affected by many genetic and exogenous factors, as mechanical stress due to tongue and orofacial muscle activity or compensatory-adaptative mechanisms related to the development of maxilla and temporomandibular joint. The link between chewing cycle kinematics, masticatory performance and mandible shape remains. The primary aim of this study is to assess, understand and explain changes in the shape of the mandible from the early medieval period to the present days in the Slavic Central European area. This study is based on the 3D geometric morphometric analysis of virtual cranial models, which were acquired through the reconstruction of cranial CT images. We have analysed groups of adult individuals from the Great-Moravian Empire (9th century), High Middle Ages (1 1th - 14th century), Modern Age (16th - 18th century) and individuals from contemporary Czech population. In the preliminary part of the study 80 mandibles of the Great-Moravian population from Mikulčice and 26 mandibles of recent population were evaluated. Shape variability of mandi- bles was analysed using principal component analysis. The shape difference between the Great-Moravian population and a recent population was positively tested using the permuta- tion test ( p &lt; 0.0005) and the model of discriminant analysis correctly classified 97.2 % of the mandibles. The sexual dimorphism of Great-Moravian mandible shape using the permutation test was not proved. Studying the components containing the major parts of overall variability we are able to localize areas of significant difference between analysed populations. #7 Ratings of facial attractiveness in relation to real facial features of young males and females Sandra Berzanskyte1, Edgaras Kirvelaitis1, Raminta Bausyte1, Janina Tutkuviene2 faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, 2Dept. of Anatomy, Histology and Anthropology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University. sandra_berzanskyte@yahoo.com Background: Evolutionary theory suggests that "average" faces should be related with high immunocompetence and better reproductive success. It should be important to maintain the stability in population features and avoid marginal deviations. The aim of the study was to test if the individuals with the facial features of the opposite size and shape (big-small, wide- narrow, etc.) attract each other. Material and methods: A questionnaire and anthropometric study of the faces was carried out in 2010-201 1 : in total 55 (23 male, 32 female students of 1 8-23 years of age) without facial anomalies and former operations were investigated. All students filled in the questionnaire compiled according to the standardized atlases of facial features: students chose the most attractive facial features of the opposite sex. Results and conclusions: The ratings of attractive facial features fluctuated significantly in male and female individuals. Unexpectedly, less androgenic male facial features were ranked by females as an attractive very often, while males commonly found mostly attractive those female facial features with expressed feminization (i.e. high upper facial part, big eyes, plump lips). Males and female with the average facial features generally ranked as the most attractive the average facial features of the opposite gender. Males with the smaller facial fea- tures ranked higher females with the larger features respectively, and contrariwise. The simi- lar phenomenon was found for females. In conclusion, our study confirms that marginal in size and shape feature's could be mostly attractive for the individuals with the opposite size and shape of corresponding facial feature.</page><page sequence="5">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 489 #8 Secular trend - selected chest dimensions of Czech children aged 0-3.49 years Pavel Bláha1, Martina Hrušková2, Jarmila Kobzová2 *Dept. of Anthropology and Human Genetics, Faculty of Science, Charles University in Pra- gue, Czech Republic, 2Dept. of Biology, Pedagogical Faculty, University of South Bohemia, České Budějovice, Czech Republic. blaha@natur.cuni.cz In the years 2001-2004, a cross-sectional study of 22 dimensions was carried out to achieve a general overview of the physical status of 0-3.49-year-old Czech children as a separate part of the 6th Nationwide Anthropological Survey of children and adolescents, Czech Republic, 2001 (NAS). The file consists of 3124 children (1579 boys, 1545 girls). The anthropometric data were collected according to a standardized (Martin-Sailer's) method or its modification. We present part of the results - recumbent length (0-1.99 y.), standing height (2.00-3.49 y.), body weight, chest circumference, transverse chest diameter, antero-posterior chest diam- eter, index of antero-posterior and transverse chest diameters and relative growth of somatic dimensions. Comparison of our study and the 6th NAS in recumbent length (0- 1 .99 y.), standing height (2.00-3.49 y.) and body weight didn't show statistically significant differences of the mean values. Therefore our study could offer useful data on contemporary children aged 0-3.49 years of age to paediatricians, anthropologists and the general public for their use either in basic research or in clinical practice. Comparison of our study's results and previous Czech anthropological surveys carried out in the years 1961-64 and 1983-87 could indicate that increases of the mean values in recum- bent length, standing height and body weight are accompanied with decreases of the mean values in chest circumference, transverse and antero-posterior chest diameters. Data were obtained through the financial support of the Ministry of Education, Youth and Sports of Czech republic No. MSM 002 1620843. #9 Leprosy, cemetery usage and the origin of public health measures in Medieval Odense Jesper Boldsen University of Odense, c/o Dept Anatomy, Odense, Denmark. JBoldsen@health.sdu.dk Leprosy was present in Scandinavia as early as in the Roman period and possibly earlier. By the Viking Age (AD 700-1050) and the Early Scandinavian Middle Ages (AD 1050-1300) leprosy was so widespread that it must be assumed that virtually everybody was infected and more than a third of all adults died with clear signs of leprosy in many communities. In the medieval city of Odense four parish and monastic cemeteries have been excavated and the cemetery of the leprosarium (St. Jorgen) has been completely excavated providing a unique material for the study of the development of the leprosy prevalence before during and after the function period of the leprosarium. It appears that leprosy prevalence among the dead was around 17 percent up to the estab- lishment of the St. Jorgen institution in the 1270s. During the first half century after the establishment of this leprosarium approximately 40 percent of all dead adults in Odense was interred in the St. Jorgen cemetery. Obviously, the institutionalization of a large fraction of the people suffering from leprosy contributed to the breaking of the chains of infection resulting in a eradication of the disease from the city. Institutionalization did not contribute to the healing of the sufferers of leprosy but it created an epidemiological regime leading to the disappearance of the disease within</page><page sequence="6">490 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts approximately three generations. Although the measure contained no cure and only minimal care for the diseased, it was a major public health success. #10 Family study shows association between chronotype and poly- morphisms in the human clock gene hPERIOD3 Felix Bredenow, Manuela Dittmar Department of Human Biology, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany Background: Clock genes contribute to the generation of endogenous biological rhythms. Population studies suggest that certain clock gene variants are involved in the development of chronotypes (morning and evening chronotypes), but family studies are still missing. Objec- tive: This study analyzed for the first time whether variants of the clock gene PERIOD3 (hPER3) are linked with chronotypes in families. Subjects and Methods: The chronotypes of 300 adults (100 family-trios) aged 41-72 years (parents) and 20-29 years (children) were determined with the international age-validated Horne-Östberg-questionnaire. DNA was extracted from oral mucosa cells, and three frequent biallelic polymorphisms in the coding region of the hPER3 gene (one minisatellite and two single nucleotide polymorphisms) were genotyped by sequencing. Family-based (100 families) and population-based (100 fathers versus 100 mothers) analyses were performed with transmission disequilibrium tests and chi- square tests, respectively. Results: The family study revealed a significant association between the evening chronotype and allele 5 of the minisatellite (p = 0.037) and between the morning chronotype and allele 4 (p = 0.003). The evening chronotype was further linked with the 5C-haplotype (p = 0.023). This was confirmed by the population study where the 5C-hap- lotype occurred more frequently in evening chronotypes (32 %) than in other chronotypes (14%, p = 0.001). Conclusions: This study demonstrated for the first time an association between the 5C-haplotype and the evening chronotype. This relationship could be due to a weaker activity of the Period protein as a transcription factor. This could result in a deceler- ated endogenous rhythmicity, thereby leading to a prolonged circadian phase which charac- terizes the evening chronotype. #11 The relation between anthropometric measures of the body and back pain of nurses under work-related physical stress Stefanie Brinkmann1, Christiane Schefïler2 ^ree University of Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 2University of Potsdam, Institute of Biochemis- try and Biology, Human Biology, Potsdam, Germany. stefanie-brinkmann@gmx.net Back pain belongs to the most frequent work-related diseases in the European Union, espe- cially among persons working in the health care sector, where the increasing workload leads to an increase in the number of employees concerned. At the same time, overweight is a growing problem in our society. This paper analyzes the link between anthropometric measures and back pain of nurses under work-related physical stress. The study consists of a sample of 47 nurses aged between 24 and 64 years from a German hospital. We study in particular body dimensions, body indexes and body type and also the relation to strength and frequency of back pain and frequency of physical stress. Consistent with the existing literature, back pain is associated with a significantly increased body mass index. For example, subjects with daily or chronic back pain have a significantly higher body mass index (29.11 kg/m2) than those with weekly or annual back pain (23.47 kg/m2) and those with yearly or more seldom back pain (22.67 kg/m2).</page><page sequence="7">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 491 Most importantly, back pain is also associated with differences in other measures that describe the fat distribution, the body type and more or less the frame of the participants. For example, nurses with a leptomorph or with a pyknomorph body type suffer significantly more often from back pain than nurses with a metromorph body type. These results show that it is important to not only deal with the symptoms but to also analyze the causes of back pain. #12 Fracture analysis of historical long bones Nadine Carlichi1, Florian Fischer2, Kristin von Heyking1, Gisela Grupe1 !ЬМи Biocenter, Department Biology I, Anthropology and Human Genetics, Ludwig-Maxi- milians-University of Munich, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany, 2Institute of Legal Medicine of Munich, Germany. n.carlichi@lrz.uni-muenchen.de In the course of archaeological excavations traumatic injuries are often found, especially frac- tures, which can be detected relatively well in human bone. Fractures are defined as a disrup- tion of the continuity of a skeletal element, exceeding the maximum limits of structural elas- ticity under the forces of pressure, tension or bending. The identification of such lesions leads to important information about the interaction of a prehistoric population with warfare, interpersonal violence and other aspects of daily life (Aufderheide &amp; Rodriguez-Martin 1998). Because of a long exposure to the burial environment or through the impact of different forces, e.g.: root prédation, low pH- value or mechanical deformation by the soil, some frac- tures cannot be recognized as such (Wahl 2001). In most published studies, a warlike past often comprises the main focus of interest. Skele- tal series covering fracture types are seldom determined and compared with each other. The object of this study is a comparison between modern clinical data from the Institute for Legal Medicine in Munich and ancient fracture types, to check whether certain fracture patterns are phenomena of recent times or whether fracture types occur intertemporally and irrespective of the prevalent forces. For this, long bones from different medieval, spatiotemporally defined skeletal series at the Bavarian State Collection for Anthropology and Paleoanatomy where trauma are noted were selected. Because most fractures have healed well, a method consisting of morphologi- cal analysis, X-ray and CT-scan is used to make the fracture line visible and to identify the fracture type. #13 Burial site of Weingarten: Reconstruction of possible provenance using the Strontium isotope analysis Janina Deppe1, Marina Vohberger1, Gisela Grupe1,2 department of Biology, Anthropology, Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, Planegg- Martinsried, Germany, 2Anthropologische Staatssammlung, Munich, Germany. Janina.Deppe@web.de Ever since its discovery in 1952, the burial site Weingarten near Ravensburg in southwestern Germany has been of great interest. Because it dates to the early Middle Age (450-720 AD), this site and its former inhabitants are associated with a time of significant cultural change and mobility. Several studies concerning subsistence, diet, relations, clothing, burial prac- tices, and trade have already been conducted. Analysis of stable strontium isotopes is one of the most effective methods for providing information on mobility and provenance of people. Because the method is based on geo- chemical diversity, strontium isotopes in tooth enamel and bone aid both in the reconstruction of childhood origins and identifying residential mobility of people.</page><page sequence="8">492 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts In this study, the first permanent molar was analyzed since it provides an approximate rep- resentation of Sr uptake during the first three years of life. Twenty-two out of a total of 159 pre-selected individuals (13.84%) were discerned as being non-local, which lies above the approximate 10% indicated in palaeodemographic studies. It can therefore be assumed that these persons spent their early childhood in a geologically different area and moved to Weingarten at some later point in time. Comparing the determined values with available data gathered from previous studies, their origin can perhaps be identified as either the Black Forest, Forest of Odes, Bavarian Forest, or the Voges, as these areas lie at a reasonable distance for possible migrants to cover. #14 Ontogenesis of mandibular measurements and their epochal changes Justina Didziapetryte1, Mantas Dargvainis1, Arunas Barkus2 'Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania, department of Anatomy, His- tology and Anthropology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania. Arunas.Barkus@mf.vu.lt Aims: Main aims of this research were to analyze the growth of the mandible in Lithuanian paleo population and compare it with data from modern Lithuanian children. Material and methods: A total of 604 skulls of individuals from 1 to 19 years old were measured. All skulls are from 15th- 19th century's archeological samples. Skulls were measured using stan- dard anthropometrical instruments according to the Martin-Sailer method. Age was esti- mated from ossification of individual bones and tooth eruption. Cephalometric measure- ments from modern Lithuanian children were taken for comparison. Results: Mandibular length (measured from the condylar process to the angle of mandible) grows at constant rate with two relative stabilization periods - one from 2 to 4 years and another from 10 to 12 years, which can be related with changes in dentition. Similar development is also observed analyzing mandibular width (measured between condylar processes and mandibular angles). Development of mandibular height and height of mandibular ramus differs; jumps can be identified in growth of these measurements. The angle of the mandible is the only measure- ment that decreases with age and remains stable after 10 years. Distance between mental foramens grows constantly within age. While comparing the development of the mandible in skulls and modern children the same dynamics were observed, only values of measurements differ due to the contribution of soft tissues in modern children. Conclusions: Stabilization periods and growth jumps related to changes in dental development are identifiable and man- dibular measurements are found to increase at an inconstant rate. Dynamics of changes are similar in paleo and in modern population. #15 Prevalence of sarcopenia among older people with normal health and nutritional state Manuela Dittmar, Kerstin Khalaj-Hedayati Department of Human Biology, Zoological Institute, Christian-Albrechts-University, Kiel, Germany. mdittmar@zoologie .uni-kiel . de Background: Sarcopenia is characterized by loss of skeletal muscle mass being a risk factor for disability in the aged. It has been examined in frail, undernourished, and ill older people. Objective: This study investigated whether sarcopenia also occurs in healthy, well-nourished elders. Subjects and Methods: Subjects were 1 10 Germans (55 males and 55 females), aged 60-83 years. Their body cell mass (BCM) and lean body mass (LBM) were used as indica- tors of muscle mass, determined by tetrapolar bioelectrical impedance analysis. Both mea-</page><page sequence="9">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 493 sures were adjusted to body weight (%BCM, %LBM) and stature squared. The nutritional state was examined with the Mini-Nutritional-Assessment questionnaire. The prevalence of sarcopenia was determined after Janssen et al. (2002), using a reference population of 332 healthy young adults. Results: Sarcopenia was already present in well-nourished healthy elders. Its prevalence depended on the indicator of muscle mass used (%BCM: 22 % males and 20 % females; %LBM: 4 % males and 1 1 % females). BCM adjusted to weight gave a higher prevalence of sarcopenia than BCM adjusted to stature squared. BCM correlated posi- tively with upper arm and calf circumferences (r = 0.64 to 0.82; each, p &lt; 0.001). Conclu- sion: Screening for presence of sarcopenia is already needed in healthy elders for early initi- ating measures against muscle atrophy. We recommend using BCM as a measure of sarcope- nia instead of LBM, because BCM better represents the skeletal muscle mass. The present data and a summary of worldwide literature findings showed that the prevalence of sarcope- nia depends on the indicator of muscle mass used, therefore requiring an international stan- dardization.

However, recent reports suggest that CF is more common in Egypt than previously anticipated [Naguib et al. 2007 (J. Cyst. Fibros. 6 (2): 111)]. Poor weight gain, weight loss, and suboptimal nutritional intake seem to result primarily from reduced energy intake, increased energy loss, and increased energy expendi- ture. To date, no studies have assessed the growth and nutritional intake in CF Egyptian chil- dren. Aim of the work: to study the growth parameters and nutritional intake in a cohort of 20 Egyptian children with confirmed CF compared to 150 age- and sex-matched controls. Methodology: the study cases were recruited from the Pulmonolgy and Hepatology Units of Cairo University Children Hospital, both retrospectively and prospectively, andwere divided into two groups: • Group 1 : consisted of 20 patients aged 1 -5 years (with a mean of 3. 1 5 + 2.06) diagnosed as CF based on: a) Typical clinical and radiologic pulmonary, intestinal and/or hepatobiliary disease. b) Sweat chloride &gt; 60 mmol/Liter using pilocarpine iontophoresis. c) CFTR mutation analysis confirmed the diagnosis in 14 patients. • Group 2: consisted of 150 healthy control children of the same age (3.25 + 1.90) and sex and living under the same socio-economic conditions. For both groups, weight and height were measured and plotted on the Egyptian growth curves [released in 2002 by Diabetes Endocrine Metabolism Pediatric Unit Cairo University Children's Hospital, http://dempuegypt.blogspot.com/. Revised 29-11-2008. Accessed 05- June-2011]. Our results showed that the weight of 45 % (No. = 9) of patients with CF were below the 5th percentile and the remaining 55 % (No. = 11) were within normal for population (Fig. 1).</page><page sequence="10">494 9.

Weight percentile of the study groups. Regarding the height, 16 patients (80 %) with cystic fibrosis were below the 5th percentile for the population, and the remaining 20 % were between the 5th and 10th percentiles (Fig. 2). Assessing the estimated nutritional intake of the study group (by the reported food intake during a typical day over 3 days on 2 successive weeks), we found that 14 patients with cystic fibrosis had low nutritional intake, while it was normal in 5 and could not be assessed in one. All control subjects had normal nutritional intake (Fig. 3). Conclusions: Low nutritional intake and consequently poor growth affecting the height more than the weight is a significant problem in our cohort of Egyptian children with CF. Suboptimal nutrition results primarily from reduced energy intake. Intensive nutritional sup- port to meet the energy demands of children with CF should be done for better growth of these patients. CF does exist in Egyptian children and should be looked into. 50 -fi 45 T 40 -A 35 T * "&lt;5 30 -T « I 15 O aio 20 -T = I ^ "25 15 -т - "50 io Controls Cystic fibrosis Fig. 2.

It aims to show subjective positive change in children in the aftermath of tsunami, which has been named as posttraumatic growth (PTG) (Tedeschiand Callhoun 1995, 2004). Data were collected orally on an individual basis of 175 tsunami-affected children in Tamil Nadu/India. The children gave answers to the Revised Posttraumatic Growth Inventory for Children and the Children's Impact of Event Scale- 13 in order to gain information on their posttraumatic growth and posttraumatic stress symptoms, respectively. The age range was 8 to 17 years and the children were single and double orphans, either living with their biologi- cal parent or in an out-of-home care organisation providing family based care. Results indi- cated that posttraumatic growth is present in children belonging to an Asian culture as 55.5 % of them had an average response of some perceived change four years post-event. Older chil- dren showed significantly higher PTG scores than younger ones, and no sex differences were found. The two groups differed in one subscale of PTG. Posttraumatic stress symptoms and posttraumatic growth were strongly related. In addition, predictors of posttraumatic growth are presented. The results are discussed from an evolutionary perspective taking into consid- eration that the hallmark behaviours of PTSD are all adaptive behaviours to extreme threats which can become pathological, but also can be viewed as the foundation of PTG. #18 Educational Spaces - Anthropological Roots and Cultural Conditions Johanna Forster Institut fur anthropologisch-historische Bildungsforschung, Nürnberg, Germany. forsteijo@aol.com</page><page sequence="12">496 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts Early mornings juvenile Homo sapiens are sent to a place called 'school'. They are kept in school spaces for hours learning and receiving pedagogical support. Regarding the history of Mankind and of human societies 'school' as distinct educational space is a rather young, specific type of ways in which social groups tutor and benefit the offspring. There is a huge variety of forms of educational space reflecting particular cultural condi- tions, and the question is about the adaptive values for the individual learner and the group in respect to a successful incorporation by and transition of the groups' knowledge, compe- tences, and values to the next generation. This ethological-pedagogical analysis focuses on different conceptual models of educa- tional space. It searches for educational settings used in the early history of modern Man, describes educational spaces performed in traditional societies and analyses built school space as classical form in organised education. Results show that there is a basic model used throughout history and across cultures allowing educational settings to be incorporated into daily life surroundings and experiences, with boundaries proving to be highly permeable and conjoined to social rules. The other widespread model, i.e. modern schooling in set buildings, however, clearly separates educa- tional experience from daily life, becoming almost self-referential. Recently, emerging chal- lenges and developments in school education have promoted a process whereby boundaries are once more opened and the educational experience yet again becomes more allied to daily life. Seen from a cultural-ethological perspective, this development can be described as a pro- cess that is returning to the basic model, yet on a far more complex scale, in response to cur- rent cultural challenges.

Nowadays, this view has been challenged by the fact that nobody is viable without this bacterial flora, called the microbiote. In fact, both systems have to be considered altogether, as a complementary supra-organism. In man's gut, there is a mass of at least 100,000 billions of bacteria, weighing over one kilogram, made of several hundreds of different strains. Their genome is one hundred times larger than the human genome itself, and we are starting to understand the interactions between these two sets of genes, considered as a metagenome. The study of this microbiote has very important issues in medicine, especially in nutritional and immunological processes. The contribution of anthropology to this new field is to under- stand how individuals and populations get their microbiote, how they share it through cultural practices and behaviors, and how it is modulated by diet. More generally, it raises the ques- tion, brought by Darwinian medicine, of the coevolution between micro-organisms and our species. The next step, after the bacteria, will be to understand our relations with our internal viruses, the human viróme.</page><page sequence="13">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 497 #20 Misleading signals in cases of ischemic heart disease - a Darwinian view on a maladaptation in highly endangered populations Sebastian Gaus, Stefan Exner Institute of Cell and Neurobiology, Center for Anatomy, Charité - Universitätsmedizin Ber- lin, Berlin, Germany. exner@zedat.fu-berlin.de Pain is a powerful adaptation that calls attention to a disorder of the body. Chest pain or pres- sure can indicate coronary heart disease. Additional transferred pain to the left arm or shoul- der or jaw is well known and has been well documented but poorly explained. If there is no primary chest pain, transferred pain in the arm or jaw alone can easily be misinterpreted with the result of overlooking a dangerous fundamental problem. Such cases seem to be not unusual. Three of them will be presented here. In the following, these examples of transferred pain will be examined on a neuro-anatomical basis as a proximate explanation. However, Darwinian medicine can also be used to investigate aspects of this phenomenon ultimately from an evolutionary biological perspective. Ischemic heart disease is the most common cause of death in many developed countries. It is mainly considered to be a result of lifestyle. Therefore, living conditions that jeopardize a central human oigan on a large scale should simultaneously favour adaptations that minimize such effects. Unambiguous signals from the body can be expected to be among such adaptations. Even though atherosclerosis has been found in ancient Egyptian mummies (Allam et al. 2009), misleading signals still exist to a remarkable extent. At the present stage of evolution, isolated referred pain seems maladaptive in large populations of modern societies highly endangered by their living condi- tions. Literature Allam, A., et al.

The aim of the present work is hence to find out whether there is a correla- tion between anthropometrical data like skeletal robustness, bone strength (measured by quantitative ultrasound [QUS]) and physical activity at present or in the past. For this reason a study was conducted on 76 young men aged 19 to 25 years. The partici- pants answered a questionnaire about their physical activity and wore a pedometer for 7 days. Furthermore Speed of Sound and Broadband Ultrasound Attenuation by QUS as well as anthropometrical data (e.g. height, weight, elbow breadth etc.) were measured. The results show that the bone strength of pyknomorphic types is significant higher than the bone strength of metromorphic or leptomorphic types. In addition, the bone strength is positively correlated with the hours of exercise per week. This means that the physical load caused by sports or by heavy weight has a positive effect on bone strength. In contrast, such a correla- tion could not be found for the skeletal robustness and neither was there a correlation between the skeletal robustness and the bone strength in this sample. Therefore, the external dimensions of bones are not as adaptive to varying surrounding conditions as the inner bone structure.</page><page sequence="14">498 9.

This coffin contained assumedly mortal remains of Queen Editha (910- 946 AD), wife of Otto the Great (912-973 AD). The aim of the multi-disciplinary investiga- tions was to test the hypothesis that the discovered coffin contained the skeletal remains of Queen Editha. The following biographic data were available: sex (female), age at death (36 years) and origin (Wessex, England). Primarily morphological and histological analysis of the skeletal remains took place. Sub- sequently aDNA, carbon and nitrogen isotope and strontium and oxygen isotope analysis were carried out. The application of descriptive morphological and metrical methods pro- vided distinct evidence of a female. A variety of age-determine methods argue for an age at death of 30 to 40 years. The reconstruction of a genetic profile failed because of the disad- vantageous preservation. The results of the carbon and nitrogen analysis mirror high quality nutrition. Strontium isotope ratios of the teeth do not match the local values for Magdeburg, but reflect chalky soils as they are common in southern England. Oxygen isotope analysis that was carried out in Bristol supports the Strontium isotope information. Because molecular genetics analyses were unsuccessful, the matching of the skeletal remains in the lead coffin and the real queen can only be based on circumstantial evidence. Like the numerous additional and independent evidence the results of the anthropological investigations fit into the chain of evidence and consolidate facts that are otherwise improv- able. #23 Somatic structure and sport activity as norms between 18 and 59 years old adults with special view to muscle strength and endurance in different kinds of sport Klaus-Peter Herm Bad Oeynhausen, Germany. ibs.herm@t-online.de After age of 35 years muscle mass don't grow without participation in sports. So the aim is to hold the mobility, the endurance and strength of older people (&gt;55 years). The big step of training is to reduce the loss of muscle mass and to hold the movement and motor function of the elderly. A proposal of norm system for using the somatic development as requirement for sports is shown. According the study there are different ways for holding the performance and muscle mass in endurance, strength training and other training. In the different training forms is different increasing of efficiencies in motor function. The difference of body struc- ture in different age between 18 and 59 years and between sports participating and no sports people is one of the results of the investigation.</page><page sequence="15">9.

Grupe Faculty of Biology, Department I, Biodiversity/Anthropology, Biocenter LMU, Martinsried- Planegg, Germany. The stable Sr isotopie ratio (87Sr/86Sr) in bioarchaeological materials is a useful figure for provenance analyses. Sr isotopie ratios from geological maps are frequently unsuitable for interpretations of archaeometric data, therefore, isotopie maps with data from archaeological strata of sites under investigation are requisite. Sr isotopie mapping of selected regions in Germany, based on the analysis of skeletal remains of residential animals, has been initiated in the frame of the International Sachsensymposion. Here, we investigated whether archaeo- logical wood samples also reflect the local Sr isotopie ratio by analysis of wood samples from the medieval town of Schleswig. The Sr isotopie ratios in the wood were compared to the respective ratios measured in red deer bone from Haithabu, since both sites are located in close proximity to each other. It was the aim of this study to test whether the results obtained from wood samples are significant and reproducible. Isotopie mapping requires the determination of the 87Sr/86Sr ratio in bioavailable stron- tium, which is the isotopie compound absorbed by plants and which finally enters the food chain. The difference of wood as opposed to sympatric vertebrate skeletal samples is that animal bones exhibit an isotopie mixture made up of the signatures of their home range while trees, being essentially immobile, only absorb strontium in one place. Since wood is an entirely different biomaterial, the laboratory procedures had to be adapted accordingly. As a result, it could be shown that the red deer from Haithabu had lived in a place different from that where the wood had grown. With regard to wood or other plant analyses, the atmospheric strontium source has to be taken to account, since it may have a considerable impact on the plant 87Sr/86Sr isotopie ratio. It is essential to assess whether this atmospheric Sr source will enter the food chain or not. #25 Skeletal Lesions of Human Tuberculosis: Changes from the Past into the Antibiotic Era Kara Holloway1, Karl Link2, Frank J. Riihli2, Maciej Henneberg1 biological and Anthropology Research Unit, University of Adelaide, Australia, 2Centre for Evolutionary Medicine (ZEM), Institute of Anatomy, University of Zürich, Switzerland. kara.holloway@adelaide.edu.au Tuberculosis has a long history in human populations and 3-5% of individuals with active disease develop skeletal lesions. Based on paleopathological studies in the Holocene, bone lesions changed from affecting mostly the vertebral column to other parts of the skeleton (Holloway et al. 201 1). The Galler Collection, started in the first half of the 20th century, doc- uments skeletal lesions in diagnosed tuberculosis patients until 1975 (N = 29) (Rühli et al. 2003). It allows observations of changes in tuberculosis manifestations that occurred due to the introduction of antibiotic treatment. The distribution and nature of tuberculosis in the pre- antibiotic era corresponded to observations in recent archaeological materials; the disease was mainly multi-focal and lesions were active at the time of death. Healing of lesions in this period occurred rarely, by fusion of the affected vertebrae. In the post-antibiotic era (1960- 1975), the foci were single and all lesions show evidence of healing by fusion of posterior elements and in a minority by bone deposition. Productive changes are not typical for tuber- culosis and are very rare in archaeological material. In the period 1946-1958, when antibi- otic therapies were just being introduced, the disease affected mostly single foci and skeletal lesions occur in all forms; active at time of death, fusion of affected vertebrae, bone deposi-</page><page sequence="16">500 9.

It follows that healing of vertebral columns by fusion of posterior elements occurs only when mycobacterial infection has been removed from the body. These results may allow diagnosis in skeletal finds. Grant: Mäxi Foundation, Switzerland. Literature Holloway, K.L., Henneberg, R.J., De Barros Lopes, M. &amp; Henneberg, M.

Methods: Forty-one healthy male subjects, aged 15.7 to 19.8 years participated in a study on lower leg length (LLL) growth, body height and weight increments. All subjects were measured and weighed at weekly intervals over a period of one year. Body height was determined by an anthropometer, body weight by conventional scales, and LLL was measured by a hand-held kne- mometer. The state of maturity of the proximal tibial epiphyses was determined by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Skeletal maturity was independently assessed by two radiologists. The growth plates were categorized as being open (category I), centrally but not completely fused (category II), or completely fused (category III). Results: Our findings demonstrate that in these adolescents, final tibial growth is characterized by longitudinal shrinkage. As shown in the MRI, when the proximal tibial growth plates have ftised (i.e., at an age when lower leg growth is commonly believed to have completed), the lower leg of healthy adolescent males begins to shrink with a negative growth rate of-2.4 (SD 2.1) mm/year. Conclusions: Apart from sporadic observations in anorectic girls, longitudinal shrinkage in LLL has not been previously documented. We assume that the final period of growth includes small reductions in bone length, possibly due to stabilization and rearrangements in the formerly growing cartilaginous tissues.

B.Jungklaus@t-online.de The Thirty Years War had already lasted for 18 years when Swedish and Imperial troops clashed south of Wittstock. Following the Swedish victory there, the conflict dragged on for another 12 years. The Battle of Wittstock, with a total of approximately 8000 dead, was one of the bloodiest encounters of the war. The mass grave, discovered in 2007, lay at the centre of the former battlefield and contained the remains of 125 of the combatants. Analysis of the surviving skeletal material has allowed detailed insights into the life and death of the ordinary soldier. The individuals were all male and aged between 17 and 45 years at the time of death, with an average age of 28 years. An international and interdisciplinary group of researchers devoted themselves to the study of the find. Particular attention was paid to the identification and analysis of skeletal trauma. Almost all of the skeletons display perimortem injuries. These include gunshot wounds, wounds caused by blows from melee weapons and comminuted fractures, among other defects. Many also show evidence of multiple trauma and the severity of the injuries attests to the ferocity of the fighting. One juvenile mercenary had received six blows to the head. The wounds, caused by melee weapons, were unhealed. One of the blows had torn off part of the skull and probably resulted in an open cerebrocranial injury. Deformations, con- sistent with injuries caused by melee weapons during the battle, were found on every fourth skull. Gunshot wounds occur with a similar frequency. The evidence comes in the form of musket or pistol balls found with the skeletons and perforating fractures of various bones. One of the dead had obviously been exposed to intense fire: two pistol balls were found within the abdominal cavity and there was a gunshot wound to the right knee. A number of comminuted fractures are indicative of extensive blunt trauma. Three of the mercenaries had large depressed cranial fractures: the skull was flattened at the point of impact and the sur- rounding bone was bent and fractured.

The height hypothesis states that the growth velocity of height reaches a peak one year before menarche, slows down thereafter, and stops within one year after menarche because of the closing epiphyses of long bones. The aim of this study is to describe variation in pattern of pubertal growth in height and its relation to the age at menarche among well-nourished, urban Polish girls.</page><page sequence="18">502 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts Longitudinal growth data from 204 schoolgirls, born in 1980, participants of the Poznaň Growth Study carried out between 1985 and 1998, were analysed to obtain individual growth curves in height and data on age at menarche. Standing height measurements from age five to eighteen were taken semi-annually and growth curves plotted using JPA2 model and AUXAL 3.1 for Windows software. Individual age at menarche was obtained in prospect questionnaire. Statistical computation was run using GLM models and STATISTICA 9. Stat- Soft, Inc. software. It was found that the age at menarche varies from 9.8 to 16.55 years with mean 12.89 years (95 %CI: 12.81; 12.99) and median 12.9 years. Critical points of the mean constant curve were: ages at TO - 8.9 years and PHV -11.8 years with corresponding growth velocity at TO - 5.2 cm/year and at PHV - 7.4 cm/year and attained height 152.6 cm and 167.5 cm at TO and PHV Bivariate regression analyses revealed statistically significant association of age at menarche with biological characteristics of the growth curve, including age, height attained and growth velocity at PHV, and spurt duration (ageTO-agePHV). Height gain at spurt appeared to be inconsistent for the age at menarche. Multiple regression model shown that of all studied biological characteristics of growth spurt in height, the age and growth tempo at PHV remained consistent for the age at menarche. MANOVA revealed that PHV at younger age (10.64 years) and greater growth velocity (7.8 cm/year) was associated with the younger age at menarche (prior to 1 1.9 years) and PHV at 12.33 years and growth velocity of 6.8 cm/ year was associated with the age at menarche older than 13.7 years. It was found that the pat- tern of menarcheal onset in relation to PHV varied considerably. A vast majority of girls started their menses after PHV and the time interval ranged from 0.11 to 3.52 years with mean 1 .4 years. Ten girls of the sample, experienced the onset of their menses prior to the age at PHV, ranging from -0.07 to -2.7 years with mean -0.9 year. Of them, 5 were early and the other average aged at menarche. It should be concluded that the pattern of relationships between growth spurt in height and age at menarche seems to be more complex than the one suggested by the height hypothesis. It seems like comprehensive study on body factors, including skeletal development, growth in height and weight and their gain during puberty as well fat distribution and body composi- tion would be useful for explaining the timing of menarcheal onset and its underlying factors. #29 Is there really a weaker sex? The male disadvantage hypothesis from a bioanthropological point of view Sylvia Kirchengast1, Beda Hartmann2 department of Anthropology, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria, department of Gyne- cology and Obstetrics, LKH Neunkirchen, NÖ, Austria. sy 1 via.kirchengast@univie . ac . at More than 40 years ago the so called "male disadvantage hypothesis" was introduced by Richard Naeye (1971) in order to explain the increased risk of perinatal morbidity and mor- bidity in boys in comparison with girls. Today, the newborn male disadvantage seems to be a well established fact. There is not only a 30 % predominance of male foetuses among early spontaneous, chromosomally normal abortions described, male offspring show also a higher neonatal mortality and more postnatal complications. Furthermore, newborn males show more often depressed Apgar scores and had a higher frequency of respiratory distress syn- drome. Consequently, male foetuses seem to be more vulnerable to an adverse intrauterine environment than female ones. Although male newborns are more vulnerable, several studies indicate that male newborns are heavier and longer and exhibit larger head circumferences than their female counterparts. According to the male disadvantage hypothesis, however, we may hypothesize that maternal stress factors during pregnancy may have an increased adverse effect on foetal growth in males in comparison to females. In the present study we focused on maternal weight status, nicotine consumption and age as important stress factors. According to the male disadvantage hypothesis male foetuses should react more sensitive to maternal</page><page sequence="19">9.

Konstantinou, Z. Tsioli Greek Anthropological Society, University of Athens, Greece. l.konstantinou@ortho-foot.gr The iliosacral joint takes a very important position for the standing and the body movement. It participates often in case of different bone diseases. The clinical results are mostly pain, dysbalance and reactive movement reduction. Four examples are presented chronological classified to different periods. The iliosacral joint of a young woman from the ancient city of Eleusis/Greece shows a medial prominent exostosis, similar for the left and the right pelvis. It can be seen as an early bone reaction in case of sacroiliitis, or as a reactive hyperostosis in place of ligaments. An adult man of the early medieval cemetery of Straubing in Low Bavaria shows a well formed synostosis of the right iliosacral joint. The resulted difference of weight bearing between the left and the right low extremity can be the reason for the intensive degenerative changes of the neighbour joints. A third example of a child skeleton from the ancient Attica is presented here. The differ- ence of the growth between the right and the left pelvis seems unusual. At least the radiological changes of the iliosacral region in case of a young patient with rheumatoid arthritis can be compared to the other three examples. There is a key function of the articulado sacroiliaca for the body movement. Its pathologi- cal changes can be proved in different historical periods. The medical treatment due to pain reduction and movement increasing needs a combina- tion of different disciplines. Literature Konstantinou, L.

The present study compared different measures for assessment of overweightness on 286 Slovenian 20- years old subjects from three different generations. Methods: The percentage of overweight young males and females was determined according to BMI, waist circumference, and per- centage of body fat tissue as determined from triceps skinfold. To classify a subject as over-</page><page sequence="20">504 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts weight, the recommended cut-off points were used: BMI of 25 kg/m2 for both genders, waist circumference of 94 cm for males and 80 cm for females, and body fat content of 23.9 % for males and 29.5 % for females. The results were then compared between the three generations. Results: On a selected sample, BMI did not identify any significant changes in the percent- age of overweight males and females over the last forty years. In contrast, triceps skinfold and waist circumference revealed rising levels of overweight subjects and statistically significant ( p &lt; 0.05) increases in accumulation of both, peripheral and abdominal fat. Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrated that BMI failed to detect increasing levels of overweight- ness. Other methodological approaches, including measurements of triceps skinfold and waist circumference and corresponding determination of obesity levels, detected a rise in overweightness along three generations with higher sensitivity than BMI. We therefore pro- pose that when assessing overweightness, BMI should be complemented by measurements of triceps skinfold (or, even better, several skinfolds) and waist circumference. #32 The method of the valuation of the average tempo of the matu- ration for the population of boys using the structural model Preece-Baines 1 Slawomir Koziel Polska Akademia Nauk Zaklad Antropologii we Wroclawiu, Poland. slawek@antro.pan.wroc.pl Estimation of the median or average age of menarche for the given population of girls based on the status quo information and using a probit method is generally used to the evaluation of the tempo of the maturation. This method has been repeatedly applied to comparisons of sec- ular changes, to intergroup-comparisons of different socio-economical status (SES) and to comparisons of intragroup secular changes. There is a lack of an analogous method to describe the average maturation rate at population level for boys. Due to the fact that growth of boys is generally more ecosensitive, such method would be able to give interesting results. The present study used the structural model of the Preece-Baines 1 to the validation of the age of the peak height velocity (APHV) of adolescent spurt for the given population of boys. APHV is a very good measure of the tempo of maturation, and strongly correlates with other measures of the maturation rate as the bone age at 14 years (r = 0.81) and with the age of menarche in girls (r = 0.81). For this purpose the longitudinal data from the Wroclaw Growth Study (WGS) was used. To individual series of measurements of height of 193 boys the PB model 1 was fitted and the APHV was derived for every individual. Then 3 equally numerous groups of boys were ran- domly selected from this population. The arithmetic mean of APHV was calculated for each subgroup. Next an average height in each age class from 8 to 18 years was calculated for every subgroup separately. Then to the series on weighted means of heights the PB model 1 was fitted and the APHV was derived for each subgroup. Then both APHV were compared for each subgroup. Analogically, entire calculations were repeated for 3 subgroups different in tempo of the maturation assessed by bone age, and designated on the basis of terciles. Results indicated that differences between the average age of PHV, and age of PHV derived from the fitted PB model 1 to average weighed heights did not exceed 50 % of the error of measurement for height for WGS (from 13.59% to 54.36%). It seems that fitting the PB model 1 to series of means height in age classes for given pop- ulation of boys is a good approximation of average tempo of maturation for this population. Adoption of the PB model 1 to cross-sectional data seems to be a complementary method to the probit analysis estimating the average age of menarche in the population of girls.</page><page sequence="21">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 505 #33 Appraisal of a problem: ethical dimensions of evidence-based research on human remains Bettina M. Kreissl Lonfat1, Frank J. Riihli1 Centre for Evolutionary Medicine, Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Switzerland. bettina.kreissllonfat@anatom.uzh.ch While on one side, the exhibition and excavation of human remains is an established ethical topic and biomedical and medical ethics is a field of its own, we propose to broaden the scope of these established discourses for evidence-based research on human remains. From a philosophical viewpoint, the ZEM (Centre for Evolutionary Medicine), as a newly founded research centre, has started to formulate a guideline for its current work with mum- mies and bone material in order to achieve a balanced code of conduct that would protect cur- rent and future research in the field. However, a precise framework - oriented to the actual research projects and protocols - that would allow us to situate our considerations from out- side of the field itself was needed. Based on the basic concepts of consent, harm and bodily integrity the code of conduct, in parts presented at the 7th International Mummy Congress, is intended spark discussions and a new awareness that outside of biomedical or medical ethics a new discourse about handling, use and destruction of human remains needs to be formed which will specify much more definitively the general instruction: 'handle with respect and with dignity'. The instrumenta- lisation of human remains for research such as aDNA extractions or radiological imaging, puts us in front of new problems that deserve answers, not only to secure mummies and human remains for future generations, but also to protect the possibility of research with and on them itself, for generations of researchers to come.

Therefore, it is essential to improve the currently applied age estimation methods constantly. According to the literature, tooth cementům annulation (TCA) is amongst the most precise methods for age estimation. The aim of my dissertation is the application and evaluation of different TCA method approaches on soil-exposed teeth. Additionally to the standard manual counting method, image editing software for manual counting and semi-automated software (Czermak et al. 2006) are applied and evaluated for their practicability for reliable, objective TCA age esti- mation. For the evaluation of the two manual counting methods, inter- and intra-observer errors are of central interest. Trained observers show better age estimation results compared to untrained observers. For the semi-automated software the study concentrates on intra- observer error. Repeated counts prove the reliability of the semi-automated software; how- ever, a general tendency towards continuous underestimation that increases with old age is observable. Further preliminary results show an advantage of the standard manual counting method over the other tested methods. Nonetheless, an average age deviation of ±3.59 of</page><page sequence="22">506 9.

Based on digitally recorded, high resolution data samples, not only conventional morphometric analyses can be performed ret- rospectively at any time using digital measuring tools, but also intrinsic quantities (e.g. geo- desic distances, areas, and proportions) can be computationally derived. Statistical analysis of complex 3D shapes, however, is still a challenge, as it requires dif- ferent shapes being represented in a common coordinate system. This can be achieved by establishing point-to-point correspondences across all shapes, which in fact, should be estab- lished not only for a few manually defined landmarks, but for the entire representation of a shape at any resolution determined by the data sampling process. We introduce statistical shape models (SSMs) for arbitrary large sets of corresponding 3D shapes, sampled at an arbitrary high resolution. SSMs constitute a compact representation of an entire set of different shapes, represented by their average shape as well as any inter-individual variability. SSMs not only allow to recover every originally captured shape, but also to interpo- late within the thus defined shape space, generating new but plausible shape instances that are not contained in the set of acquired shapes, as well as to extrapolate shapes with respect to partic- ular modes of variation. We also introduce tools and algorithms that make SSMs accessible to multivariate statistical analysis, 3D visualization and interactive exploration. We present examples of SSMs for different bony structures (pel vises, mandibles, eye sockets) as well as for faces, addressing questions about normal or abnormal growth patterns, age related changes, gender related differences, et cetera. We are interested in establishing databases for comprehensive anthropometric studies, opening new possibilities in forensic anthropology, biometry, medical diagnostics, surgery planning, and many other fields. #36 Stable Isotopes of Early Holocene goitered gazelle from Early Neolithic Göbekli Tepe (Southeastern Anatolia) - Implications for a seasonal use of the temple complex C.

The oldest excavated building layer is dated to about 9500 ВС, the youngest to about 8000 ВС. In this study, archaeological remains of Early Holocene goitered gazelles (G. subguttu- rosa) from Göbekli Tepe were analyzed with regard to stable carbon and oxygen isotopes and stable strontium isotopes in bone and tooth enamel apatite in order to reconstruct patterns of diet and possible seasonal migrations and to derive seasonal hunting patterns of early PPN hunter-gatherer populations in Southeastern Anatolia. The dietary signal preserved in the ô13C-values revealed a considerable, statistically sig- nificant contribution of C3-plants to the diet of G. subgutturosa which reflects the climatic conditions in the region of Göbekli Tepe during that time. 8180-values served as climate proxies and proved to be useful in the reconstruction of vertebrate habitat preferences and mobility patterns. Also, measurement of strontium isotope ratios served as a technique for characterizing prehistoric mobility and therefore for tracing the place of origin of animals and their seasonal migration. In total, the results implicate seasonal migration of the gazelles. Therefore, seasonal presence of hunter-gatherers at Göbekli Tepe seems to be likely. #37 Ratings of males facial attractiveness and masculinity in relation to phase of females menstrual cycle Laura Lapienyte1, Austeja Vidraite1, Renata Rizgeliene2, Janina Tutku- viene2 'Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania, 2Dept. of Anatomy, Histology and Anthropology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania. lapienyte@gmail.com Background: The "good genes" hypothesis suggests that masculinity, as an honest sign of bio- logical quality, should be of increased attractiveness at the ovulation phase. The aim of our study was to analyze the ratings for attractiveness and masculinity across the menstrual cycle, and to evaluate the correlations between ratings of attractiveness and scores for masculinity of male faces. Material and methods: In total 23 young (20-23 years old) females rated the attractive- ness and masculinity of 100 young (20-30 years old) males by their photos, the 7 point Likert scale was used. The same females rated photos of the same males three times - at the beginning of menstrual cycle, at the middle and at the end of the cycle. The facial anthropometry also was analyzed. Results and conclusions: Generally, during all the phases of menstrual cycle attrac- tiveness ratings for more masculine male faces were higher than for less masculine faces. The mid-cycle average rating of male attractiveness was higher than at the other phases of the cycle. Unexpectedly, ratings of attractiveness of less masculine male faces also were much higher at the middle of menstrual cycle. Ratings for facial masculinity especially decreased at the end of menstrual cycle. In conclusion, our study confirmed the theory that male faces were more attrac- tive for females around the ovulation phase, but the mid-cycle increase in attractiveness score for less masculine male faces was even higher than for masculine faces. Moreover, some very masculine male facial features had no correlation with the ratings of attractiveness. #38 Menarcheal age and body height in Iceland in the last century Andreas Lehmann1, Laufey Tiyggvadóttir2, Christiane Scheffler1, Michael Hermanussen3 University of Potsdam, Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, Human Biology, Potsdam, Germany, department of Medicine, University of Iceland, Reykjavik, Iceland, 3Aschauhof, Altenhof, Germany. dian85@web.de</page><page sequence="24">508 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts In the last centuries many authors described a secular trend in growth for many countries; an increasing in body height and a decreasing in age at menarche. In our study we reanalysed an Iceland dataset; these data included measurements of final body height and menarcheal age from 72947 girls, which were born between 1930 and 1988. In addition to that we integrated economical data (GDP - Gross domestic product) in our analysis. We found a decrease in menarcheal age from 13.86 (SD 1,28) years to 13.32 (SD 1.33) years in this time period, furthermore the final body height increased from 163.77 cm to 166.88 cm. GDP rises over the whole period. There is a strong relationship between mean menarcheal age and body height. The girls with late menarche are tallest within their birth cohorts. Similar results were described by Onland-Moret et al. 2005. Age at menarche usually decreases with increasing GDP (Liestol 1982). However, in the early 1970ies, age at menarche again increased in spite of rising GDP throughout a 10-year period, i.e. for the birth cohorts after 1960. This mysterious event coincided with several severe volcanic eruptions. We speculate that presence of volcanic ashes might have interfered with the developmental tempo of these girls.

Objective: This study aimed at analyzing the applicability of segmental bioelectrical imped- ance analysis (sBIA) for determining segmental MM and FM in older people. Subjects and methods: In 40 men (mean age 68.8 ± 4.9 years) and 32 women (69.3 ± 4.7 years), the MM and FM of arms, legs, and trunk were determined with sBIA (BC-418-MA, Tanita) and com- pared with dual energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Results: In women, sBIA correctly predicted mean MM in arms and legs, except for right arm (+13 %, p &lt; 0.05) and overpre- dicted truncal MM (+14 %,/? &lt; 0.001). In men, by contrast, sBIA correctly predicted truncal MM, but underpredicted it in limbs by -6 to -18 % (p &lt; 0.01). Mean FM was correctly esti- mated in women in trunk and legs, but largely underestimated in arms (-27 to -35 %, p &lt; 0.001). Mean FM of men was correctly determined for arms, but strongly overpredicted in legs (+34 to +37 %,p &lt;0.01) and trunk (+60 %,p &lt; 0.001). Negative and significant correla- tions were observed between the total MM (or FM) and the proportional deviations of sBIA estimates from DXA measures. Conclusions: The sBIA is applicable for determining MM and FM in legs of older women but is not suited for estimating truncal MM in women and truncal FM in men. This possibly reflects sex differences in body build and body fat distribu- tion. The actual equations of the Tanita device should be partly revised.</page><page sequence="25">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 509 #40 Identification of people, past circumstances and cause of death: an active case study focussing on the human remains recovered at an abandoned psychiatric institute cemetery in Hall in Tirol, Austria George McGlynn1, Nadine Carlichi2, Alexander Zanesco3, Oliver Seifert4, Christian Haring4 1 State Collection for Anthropology and Palaeoanatomy, Munich, Germany, 2Dept.

The fortuitous discovery of a small booklet containing the names and dates of death of over 220 psychiatric patients during cleanup work at the Psychiatric Hospital's own archives resulted in a closer investigation of these inhumations. According to the death records, all patients interred at the aforementioned cemetery died during the National Socialist con- trolled WWII period dating between October 1942 and April 1945. Well known negative NS attitudes towards the mentally ill or congenitally disabled combined with the fact that the rate of dying was evidenced to be significantly higher during this period than in the years before quickly led to the hypothesis that patients being treated at the institute were victims of euthana- sia. A decentralized so-called "wild euthanasia" was practiced during these years in Germany and Austria and was characterized by the perfidious method of killing through neglect, starva- tion, and attrition or the continuous administration of low doses of medications which resulted in immobility and subsequently lethal pulmonary complications. A combined effort between anthropologists, archaeologists, historians, psychiatrists and forensic scientists is presently attempting to positively identify each individual based on written records and skeletal and bio- molecular examination. Written hospital records are available and have proven to be an invalu- able aid in the identification process. Details to each patient's physical and mental state of health were documented in the anamnesis conducted by physicians or in descriptions provided by the patient's family and often by the patients themselves. An investigation into physical abuse based on palaeopathological indicators as well as the cause of death will also be carried out, the latter using nitrogen stable isotope analysis of preserved hair or fingernails. #41 Probable malignant tumor cases from medieval cemeteries in Hungary Erika Molnár1, Antonia Marcsik1, Péter Zádori2, Csaba Vandulek2, György Pálfi1 department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary, 2 Kaposvár University, Health Center, Kaposvár, Hungary. molnarerika@hotmail.hu There is a longstanding debate over the antiquity of cancer still going on today (Faltas 201 1). Although the rarity of skeletal malignancies in the paleopathological records seems to con- firm that cancer is more of a 'man-made' disease, improvement of diagnostic tools and large population studies may change this idea. In this study, we present data on the occurrence of malignant bone tumors in 3 medieval anthropological series (2490 individuals) of Hungary dated from the 7- 18th centuries AD. All skeletons were subjected to a careful macroscopic investigation, which was extended in the suspected cases by radiological examination.</page><page sequence="26">510 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts The paleopathological investigation of 4 individuals revealed skeletal lesions highly sug- gestive of skeletal malignancy. According to osteolytic skull lesions the diagnosis of meta- static cancer in two cases (1 mature male and 1 senile female) were strongly suspected. The osteoblastic alterations of the facial bones (senile female) probably suggest some kind of osteosarcoma, however, the diagnosis of osteoblastic metastasis is not included. The severe mandible destructions of a 9-1 1 years old infant are possible consequences of a very aggres- sive malignant tumor. These results, similarly to earlier publications (Molnár 2009) indicate that carcinomas were present in the historic populations of Hungary and the ongoing large population study will hopefully result in new evidence of ancient cancer cases. The support of the Hungarian Scientific Research Found, OTKA NN 78 696 and К 78 555 is greatly acknowledged. Literature Faltas, В.

Detection of nutritional deprivation by isotopie analysis of hair Ferdinand Neuberger, Eilin Jopp, Johannes Wechsler, Klaus Piischel, Matthias Graw, Gisela Grupe LMU München, Department Biologie I, Biodiversität/ Anthropologie, AG Anthropologie und Umweltgeschichte, Planegg-Martinsried, Germany. f.neuberger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de Serial analyses of the stable isotopes С and N in hair are a well-established method to investi- gate the nutritional status of humans. The diagnosis of starvation is an important topic in law assessment; especially in cases of neglect of children and elderly it is essential to determine onset and duration of nutritional deprivation. Increasing ô15N-values indicate the catabolism of bodily protein and are associated with a very low BMI. In contrast, the Ô13C values and BMI were in phase: a decrease in BMI is paralleled by a depletion of 13C and specifies a lack of energy in the diet. But is it possible to differentiate the isotopie signatures of starvation from the isotopie changes due to a stringent fasting cure? Are the isotopie consequences of starvation similar to voluntary fasting? A group of obese patients was tracked during three months of rigorous fasting with a for- mula diet (high protein content). This fasting cure took place under constant medical obser- vation at a Munich hospital. During the period of examination hair sampling and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) were performed periodically. Therefore, the isotopie signature in hair can be compared to the alteration in body composition due to proceeding fasting and decreasing body weight. When the measured isotopie values of starvation and fasting are set in contrast to each other, on the one hand certain similarities are visible in the trend of the Ô15N- values. But on the other hand both Ô13C values show differences, which can help to distinguish between an unintended phase of starvation and a severe voluntary fasting cure. #43 Were children a crucial link in the domestication of the dog? Laura Newell-Morris University of Washington, Dept .of Anthropology, Seattle, WA, USA. lnm@u.washington.edu</page><page sequence="27">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 511 The origin of the dog ( Canis familiaris) from local wolf ( Canis lupus) populations in Eurasia is poorly understood. Fossils indicate that the dog was an established domestic animal in Central Europe about 14,500 years ago, although the finds may be those of an "incipient dog" in early stages of domestication. Less resolved is the question of why humans domesticated the wolf, and several hypotheses attempt to explain why humans domesticated large predatory wolves and why wolves sought proximity to humans. One popular explanation is that wolves were attracted to the food in garbage dumps, with the most successful scavengers being those with the highest tolerance of humans. Humans then engaged in a form of artificial selection overtime, by accept- ing the most tolerant animals into their settlements, recognizing the latters' value as territorial "alarm systems". As is the case with hypotheses about prehistoric human behavior, the focus is on the adult. I propose that children interacting with incipient dogs were an important catalyst in the domestication of the dog. The role of companion animals in optimal child development is well-documented. Children raised with a pet develop greater self-esteem and empathy than those without, i.e., they more effectively interpret the moods, thoughts, and emotions of others, and are more cooperative and sharing. In brief, they become more "socially competent", a trait that would make them the more preferred and reproductively successful mates within expanding populations evolving culturally greater emphasis on social status. In this way a positive feed- back loop was forged between incipient dogs evolving into attentive sensitive readers of human behavior and demographically and culturally evolving human populations. #44 Does human sexual dimorphism influence fracture frequency patterns? Jonna Nielsen ADBOU, University of Southern Denmark. jonnanielsen60@yahoo.dk This study explores the hypothesis that the pattern of gender inequality in a community influ- ences the frequency and patterns of fractures. As it is not possible to read gender relations from skeletons, it is - following several research results - assumed that the level of gender inequality is reflected in sexual dimor- phism. So the study design consists in correlating a measure of sexual dimorphism with mea- sures of frequencies and patterns of skeletal trauma. Approximately 200 individual from two medieval Danish cemeteries have been examined. One hundred individuals (50 females and 50 males) came from the Gray Friar's cemetery in Ribe, Jutland. Another 100 skeletons (50 females and 50 males) came from a similar ceme- tery in the city of Odense on the island of Funen. In Jutland the level of sexual dimorphism is known to be substantially larger than on the island of Funen. Sexual dimorphism was assessed by means of measurements on the pelvis and age corrected (cumulative) fracture frequencies were estimated from the two skeletal samples. In accord with conventional wisdom the level of sexual dimorphism was found to be lower in the Funen than in the Jutland sample. As could be expected older individuals showed higher cumulative fracture frequency. A difference in frequencies was observed but it failed to reach statistical significance. Studies of larger samples will help clarify this. #45 Comparative CT and MR Imaging of Ancient Mummies Lena Öhrström1, Hendrik von Waldburg1, Peter Speier2, Michael Bock3, Frank J.Rühli1 Centre for Evolutionary Medicine, Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Zürich, Swit- zerland, 2Siemens Medical Solutions, Erlangen, Germany, 3German Cancer Research Centre, Heidelberg, Germany. lena@ohrstrom.ch</page><page sequence="28">512 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts Ancient mummies are an important source to study the evolution of disease. To guarantee their completeness, non-invasive investigation methods are desirable. Computed tomography (CT) is currently the gold standard in radiological mummy research. The radiation is highly energetic, however, and can possibly harm already fragmented DNA. Thus, other absolutely non-invasive methods are required. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is operating with electromagnetic fields. In recent decades MRI couldn't be applied in mummified tissue, because of its low water content. Only recently, MRI has been made applicable for ancient mummies using the ultra-short-echo-time (UTE) technique. The aim of the present study was to compare CT and MR images and to evaluate the value of each imaging modality. We acquired CT and MR images from samples of ancient Egyptian mummies (2 hands, 1 head, circa 1300-1500 ВСЕ) and of an entire mummified Peruvian corpse (circa 1100 CE). Anatomical structures were defined in correlative slices in each imaging modality. Signal intensity and signal variance were evaluated using a qualitative scale and then compared. CT images appeared superior to MR images, mainly because of its higher spatial resolution. At the moment MRI should not be seen as a replacing method, but rather as an additional modality. While using MRI new information about the investigated specimen can eventually be gained. MR imaging seems to have great potential, but further research is needed to view its whole capacity. As an outlook, preliminary results by us on using new CT techniques (such as dual-energy CT) will be briefly addressed too.

With regard to the postcranial skeleton it traditionally concerns the overall size and thickness of the bones and the development of muscle attachments. Regarding the cranium robusticity is moreover about the presence and development of superstructures. These are especially well developed and characteristic in many fossil hominids, and they make up much of the founda- tion for the phylogenetic interpretations of hominid evolution. The cranial superstructures were for a greater part lost or diminished during evolution of Homo sapiens that amongst other things is characterized by a gracilization of the skeleton. As such only few recent popu- lations have retained the robust features that characterized the crania of early Homo sapiens. However, the degree of robusticity varies naturally both on a local/regional scale within pop- ulations as well as among populations. Seen from an evolutionary point of view both Mesolithic and Neolithic individuals from the Danish area are to be considered recent. Nevertheless the Neolithic is often described as a period in which a gracilization of the skeleton took place. Especially when compared to the Mesolithic, but also during the "cultural eventful" time, which characterize the Neolithic. The degree of robusticity is influenced by different factors, each complex and partly mutually dependent. Genetics and climate are both likely very important, but other factors such as sub- sistence, patterns of activity and hormonal relationships must also be taken into consider- ation. The present analysis specifically deals with craniofacial robusticity. That is whether some people or groups of people had more robust features than others. By means of various cranial measurements and statistical analyses the purpose is to define what constitutes robusticity, how it is expressed and possibly changes in the Neolithic in the Danish area.</page><page sequence="29">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 513 #47 Association of obesity with sedentary behaviors and play out- door among children Cristina Padez Department of Life Sciences and Research Centre for Anthropology and Health, University of Coimbra, Portugal. cpadez@antrop.uc.pt Childhood obesity is a growing public health problem in Portugal with 30% of children either overweight or obese. Sedentary behaviors such as television viewing is one of the major factors contributing to childhood obesity. This study aims to analyze the association between sedentary behaviors, passive play inside house, outdoor play and children obesity. A cross-sectional study was done in a sample of 1 1 554 children, aged 6.0-1 0.0 y. Weight and height were measured, and parents filled out a questionnaire about family characteristics. Overweight and obesity, using age- and sex-specific body mass index (BMI) cut-off points as defined by IOTF, were used. Data were analyzed using the chi-square test and the multivari- ate logistic regression analysis. We found 21.1 % of overweight and 9.0% of obese children. The prevalence of obesity (including overweight) decreased by time of TV viewing each day: &lt; 2 h: 26.9 %, 2-4 h: 30.2 %, and + 4h: 34.2 %,p &lt; 0.001; decreased by time spent with passive play inside house: &lt; 2h: 32.6 %, 2-4 h: 30.3 %, and + 4h: 27.7 %, p &lt; 0.001 and decreased by active play out- door: &lt; 1 h/day: 37.4%, 2-4 h/day: 30.1 %, &gt; 3 h/day: 26.4%,/? &lt; 0.001. We conclude that TV viewing is positively associated with childhood obesity and either passive play inside house or active play outdoor are both effective ways to decrease childhood obesity. #48 Morphological, paleoradiological and paleomicrobial study of a 10th-12th century Hungarian skull showing severe pathological lesions György Pálil1, Erika Molnár1, Zsolt Bereczki1, Annamária Pòsa1*2, Péter Zádori3, Csaba Vandulek3, Frank Maixner4, Albert Zink4, Ildikó Pap5 department of Biological Anthropology, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary, depart- ment of Genetics, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary, 3Kaposvár University, Health Cen- ter, Kaposvár, Hungary, institute for Mummies and the Iceman, EURAC Research, Bolzano, Italy, department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest, Hun- gary. gypalfi@hotmail.com The subject of our paleopathological study is the skull of an adult female from the 10th- 12th century AD anthropological series of 'Szabolcs-Petöfi utca', stored in the collection of the Department of Anthropology, Hungarian Natural History Museum, Budapest, Hungary (Pap 1981). The calvarium of the incomplete skeleton shows multifocal, purely osteolytical lesions predominantly in both parietal bones. The dimensions of the osteolytic foci are various, from 1 to more than 10 cm. Our preliminary paleopathological study carried out several years ago proved the intra vitam origin of the lesions and a metastatic carcinoma was suggested as a probable diagnosis. In addition to the osteolytic lesions, a healed lesion was observed on the top of the skull vault, in the bregma region, which we interpreted as a symbolic trephination, typical phenomenon in this historical and geographical context. A recent re-examination of this interesting paleopathological case provided some addi- tional information, such as the small inflammatory changes around the borders of the osteo- lytical lesions and also at the endocranial side of the presumed healed trephination. The fact that cranial tuberculosis is frequently associated with this type of inflammatory changes and that multifocal ТВ can perfectly mimic bony metastases pushed us to re-evaluate the interpre- tation of this case. Tuberculosis granulomata - especially in an extrapulmonary process -,</page><page sequence="30">514 9.

Violence against one's children (in most cases the bearers of one's genes) is an evolution- ary paradoxon. In this contribution we investigate evolutionarily predictable motives for par- ents harming their children or even killing them, thereby reducing their own "fitness". Methods: Online study based on available questionnaires and one which was developed by ourselves; n was 1121. Results: Factors correlated with higher than normal parental violence were: - bad economic situation (lack of resources) - few or bad social contacts (lack of support from family and relatives) - reduced chances for the child to be reproductively successful (congenital malformation, chronic disease...) - no or low genetic relatedness between perpetrator and child; 40 persons grew up with step fathers, they were two times more often victims of violence than children without stepfa- ther. In a small group of respondents who were parents themselves, information about their own parental violence was given. Subjective reasons for this behaviour, which is sociopolitically banned in Austria and Germany, were: - stress - violence as educational means (punishment) - violence as reaction to violent child Conclusions: This study found evolutionarily predictable risk factors for violence of parents towards children. Stepfathers are likely to present, statistically, a particular problem, yet real- istic data are hard to obtain because of political correctness considerations. #50 Reliability of simple anthropometric parameters in the predic- tion of visceral fat area Zoltán Pin tér', Linda Móricz1, Katalin Szabó2, Mária Csanádi2, Mátá Linczenbold2, Andor Molnár2, András Szász2, Gábor Kiss2, Kornélia Orbán2, György Pálfi1, Ferenc László2 'Department of Anthropology, Faculty of Science and Informatics, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary, 2Physical Education and Sport Science Institute, Juhász Gyula Teacher Training Faculty, University of Szeged, Szeged, Hungary. pinterster@gmail.com</page><page sequence="31">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 515 Techniques for direct measurement of visceral fat are (VFA), as computed tomography (CT), or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), are costly and time-consuming. Simple anthropomet- ric methods, such as sagittal abdominal diameter, waist circumference or waist-to-hip ratio are less accurate, however, these methods are widely used in clinical or field settings because of practicality (Clasey et al. 1999, Ellis 2000). The study investigated whether visceral fat area can be optimally estimated by a few anthropometric variables. The sample consisted of 97 adults (19 men and 78 women) aged 20-76 years (mean 42.07). Another 73 adults (18 men and 55 women) aged from 19 to 61 years (mean 39.65) were recruited for the cross-validation group. The anthropometric variables examined were decimal age, height, weight, hip width, waist circumference, hip circumference, thigh cir- cumference, sagittal diameter, and subcutaneous fat thickness (SFT) at 6 sites. VFA was determined with a multi-frequency bioimpedance analyzer (model: Biospace InBody 230). Multiple regression analyses were used for the selection of the best independent anthropo- metric variables for the estimation of the VFA. A prediction equation was obtained that used four predictors: sagittal diameter, hip width, decimal age, and subcutaneous fat thickness in the calf area (R = 0.933, R2 = 0.87, SEE = 14.3 cm2). The correlation coefficient and SEE between the observed and predicted values, when applying the prediction equation to the cross-validation group, were 0.948 and 16.5 cm. In a Bland- Altman procedure, systematic error was not found. In conclusion, our findings support that VFA can be estimated with good accuracy by simple anthropometric parameters.

These analyses were based on macromorphological data, but in numer- ous cases molecular biological methods were used as well (Haas 2000). However, due to the development of diagnostic criteria in the field of infectious diseases, new approaches were introduced in the identification of ТВ lesions on the skeleton. In general, former investiga- tions had only considered classical ТВ alterations. The co-existence of some or all atypical lesions of infections and stress indicators has only been recognized lately to refer to the possi- bility of tuberculosis (Maczel 2003). In addition, molecular methods for the detection of mycobacterial aDNA have been also developed in the recent times. Due to these newly recognized symptoms and newly developed methods, systematic revi- sion of the paleopathology of tuberculosis in the Bácsalmás-Òalmás series was inevitable. Primarily, macromorphological methods were used focusing both on classical/advanced stage skeletal ТВ alterations (tuberculous spondylitis, tuberculous arthritis) and atypical/ early-stage ТВ lesions (rib lesions, superficial vertebral changes, endocranial alterations, early-stage spondylodiscitis). In addition, the association of 4 stress factors (long bone peri-</page><page sequence="32">516 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts ostitis, cribra orbitalia, cribra cranii, linear enamel hypoplasia) were also considered. Con- firming the diagnoses based on morphological traits of ТВ, molecular investigation was also carried out to detect mycobacterial aDNA using conventional (silica gel extraction) and newly developed (phenol-chloroform extraction) methods. The aim of this study is to present the results of these examinations. The support of the Hungarian Scientific Research Fund, OTICA К 78555 and NN 78696 is greatly acknowledged.

A lot of movement encourages bone growth, mass and strength especially while growing at an early age. A ten year comparison (data from 1999 and 2009) indicates a significant decrease of skel- etal robustness in 6-12 year-olds (Scheffler 201 1). We hypothesize an association between reduced skeletal robustness and physical inactivity. To date 200 boys and girls aged 6 to 10 years were examined at schools in Brandenburg and Berlin. Anthropometric data were mea- sured, subjects wore a pedometer for 7 days and their parents answered a questionnaire about physical activity and media use. First results suggest a relationship between Frame-index, physical activity measured by pedometer and media use. Children who show a high value of steps exhibit a high skeletal robustness, as well. Furthermore steps, media use and BMI are negatively correlated. Steps are reduced when participants are watching lots of TV and they indicate higher BMI values. According to that we can confirm our theory. Our children need a lot of locomotion to build a robust skeleton. Literature Scheffler, C.

Although different equations for body com-</page><page sequence="33">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 517 position exist, with some of them specifically adapted for use in pregnant women, they may give significantly different results. The aim of the study was therefore to compare various existing methods and evaluate their results. Methods: The measurements approved by the Slovenian Ethics Committee were performed on 22 women volunteers (mean (SD) age = 32 (3) years) in the 30 (3) week of pregnancy. They provided information on their age, height, pre-pregnancy and current mass. Then their skinfolds (triceps, biceps, subscapular, suprail- iac, front-thigh, medial-calf), wrist, and upper arm circumferences were measured. The per- centage of body fat tissue was calculated according to seven different existing equations (Sloan 1962, Durnin &amp; Womersly (triceps, four skinfolds) 1974, Jackson 1985, Deurenberg 1990, Paxton 1998, Hronek 2010). Data were then analyzed with one-way repeated measures ANOVA. Results: The results revealed large differences between estimations of body fat, ranging from 23 (7)% to 37 (5)% on average in the same sample. The most disturbing of all is a large difference between the results obtained by methods, which were developed specifi- cally for pregnant women (Hronek, Paxton). Conclusions: Further research in this field is indispensable to determine the reliability of the existing methods and examine which one is the most representative of the actual body composition in pregnant women.

Andreas_Rott@web.de As a part of a research project financially supported by the DFG, aiming at migration, trade and ecological changes in the Viking age trading centre Haithabu and its medieval successor Schleswig, we investigated migration of people to Schleswig (1 1th - 13th cent. AD). As both Haithabu and Schleswig were known to have been in touch with almost the entire world known at that time, immigrants to both towns are expected. For this reason we measured the 87Sr/86Sr isotope ratios of first permanent molarenamel of 92 individuals to possibly identify if any of them grew up in a place with a different geologi- cal setting than Schleswig. So far, 87Sr/86Sr ratios are indeed variable and at least three indi- viduals should have originated from Northern Scandinavia, most probably from Central Swe- den. Due to the complex ecology of the brackish water system of the Schlei fjord it has not been possible to quantify the use of marine resources at Schleswig by the traditional dietary indicators (N, C) yet. Therefore we tried to solve this issue by using 87Sr/86Sr ratios. Strik- ingly, the majority of isotopie ratios does not exhibit a strong marine dietary signal, indicat- ing a largely terrestrial diet of the inhabitants of Schleswig despite their year round access to the open waters of the Baltic Sea. &gt;</page><page sequence="34">518 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts #55 The Bernese Death Register: Mortality of a Swiss Urban Population in the Early 19th Century Domenic Riittimann, Sandra Lösch Department of Physical Anthropology, Institute of Forensic Science, Bern University, Swit- zerland. domenic.ruettimann@irm.unibe.ch We examined the mortality of the city of Bern, Switzerland, between 1805 and 1815. Thus contributes to the research on demographics and public health of urban populations of prein- dustrial Europe. The key source is a death register that contains information of all deceased, like age, sex and cause of death. This register is one of the earliest compilations of data sets of individuals with this high degree of completeness and consistency. The age structure of the Bernese mortality is reconstructed and compared to contempora- neous and recent demographic data. Special attention is given to stillborn, the cause of death and mortality of newborn babies and infants. Furthermore, the susceptibility of sex and age to certain causes of death is established. Death came in a wide range of guises, mostly as a result of metabolic disorders, illness of the respiratory system, and dysentery. The worst killer of infants is referred to as "gichteren", a local German expression for a disease with spasmodic convulsions which apparently occurs more frequently in boys. Possible identifica- tions of this illness such as infant tetanus or idiopathic infant epilepsy are discussed. In com- parison with European data, Bern's mortality structure is typical for a medium sized town of the early 19th century but with relatively low infant mortality. This is probably due to the establishment of a midwifery school since 1781. This research has an explicit interdisciplinary value for different scientific fields from both the humanities and natural sciences. The data represent the complete age and sex struc- ture of a deceased population. Physical Anthropologists can use these as a reference group for their paleodemographic studies. It is a call to both anthropologists and historians to use resources to better effect through combination of methods and exchange of knowledge. #56 Which does contribute more to the maximum growth gain in stature, sitting height or leg length? Takashi Satake1, Toshie Hirohara1, Komei Hattori2 !Nihon University School of Dentistry at Matsudo, Japan, 2Ibaraki University, Japan. satake.takashi@nihon-u.ac.jp Introduction: Growth in leg length terminates, on average, earlier than growth in sitting height, which continues into late adolescence. Sitting height thus contributes more to the ado- lescent gain in stature than leg length. This paper attempts (1) to confirm which contribute more to the maximum growth gain in stature, the growth gain in sitting height or leg length at the peak height velocity, and (2) to describe variation in contribution of the growth gains in sitting height and leg length to the maximum growth gain in stature, and (3) to examine relationship between individual versus average growth by using longitudinal data. Subjects and Methods: The data are from annual health examination surveys conducted by school health teachers. A longitudinal data set spanning the 1st grade of elementary school through the 3rd grade of high school was extracted from serial surveys. The subjects born from 1980 to 1986 were healthy, adequately nourished Japanese youths. The measurement included were stature, body weight and sitting height. Leg length was estimated as stature minus sit- ting height. The lower segment-upper segment ratio (LUR) was derived as leg length/ sitting height * 100. Yearly growth gains in stature were calculated, and estimated the maximum gain in stature and the age at peak height velocity, and also calculated the growth gains in sitting height and leg length at the age at peak height velocity for each individual, respectively. Results: Cross-sectional analyses showed that the growth gain in leg length contributed more</page><page sequence="35">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 519 to the maximum gain in stature than the growth gain in sitting height. However, longitudinal analysis showed that there were some variations on contribution of the growth gains in sitting height and leg length to the maximum gain in stature. #57 How many skeletons do we need? - An evolutionary approach of the change of skeleton measures in school children in the last decade Christiane Scheffler University of Potsdam, Institute of Biochemistry and Biology, Human Biology, Potsdam, Germany. christiane.scheffler@uni-potsdam.de The reasons and the consequences to public health systems of the world-wide increasing rate of overweight are extensively discussed since a long time. The imbalance between physical activity and nutritional intake were accepted commonly as main reasons of this unhealthy development. Apart from nutrition and genetics, particularly the physical activity is an important factor for developing healthy muscle and skeleton (Cameron &amp; Demerath 2002). An analysis of almost 1400 children aged 6 to 12 years from Brandenburg (Germany) in 2009 shows a significant decrease of Frame-Index, shoulder breadth, and pelvic breadth, but no significance change in height (Scheffler 201 1) compared with a previous study in 1999. An actually running study indicates an association between high values of Frame-Index and high physical activity. Furthermore, our data of young men indicate an association between bone strength measured by ultrasound and weak sport activity. In summary, it seems that the observed reduction of skeletal measures is caused by a reduced daily physical activity in childhood. The reduction of skeletal mass is an expression of phenotypic plasticity of bones and so it is determined in genotypes and develops in the interaction between genotypic and environmental factors. The Frame index shows an increase of phenotypic variance; shoulder and pelvic breadth disarranged to lower values with constant phenotypic variance. The question is whether we need certain skeleton mea- sures to remain healthy in future; without osteoporosis or other muscle and skeleton diseases. The study is partly supported by the Centre of Evolutionary Medicine at University of Zürich. Literature Cameron, N. &amp; Demerath, E.W.

Adaptations before and after Cultural Change Wulf Schiefenhövel Max-Planck-Institute, (Human Ethology), Andechs, Germany. schiefen@orn.mpg.de For the ethnic group of the Eipo, Province of Papua, Indonesia, we have estimated that in 1975 (the "neolithic period") adult men would consume less than V2 g animal protein per kg bodyweight per day. Still, the Eipo men were very muscular and extremely powerful. Women (who were even more impressive with their performances as carriers) and infants were given a "protein niche" (most birds, insects and their larvae etc.). In this very intelligent cultural solution the ones who needed protein most, women and children, were protected from protein deficiency.</page><page sequence="36">520 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts Since the dramatic acculturation around 1980, the Eipo had increasingly more access to the "outside world". Modern foods (mainly rice, oil, fast cooking noodles, canned fish, salts, sweets), are flown in. Body size has increased; obesity is becoming a problem. Even more dramatic is the change in reproduction. Whereas formerly a woman would have a maximum of 7 live births, it is now often 10 and more. This is probably also due to improved nutritional status. It has become a sign of male status to build fishponds and to be a successful fish breeder. The way the Eipo have so far coped with the dramatic change in their lives demon- strates their flexibility and adaptability. In further field studies sets of quantitative data will be collected to corroborate the observations made so far. #59 Huns in Bavaria? Archaeometric analyses of an artificially deformed skull from an early medieval cemetery in Burgwein- ting (Regensburg, Germany) Ramona Schleuder1, Annika Wisnowsky1, Sandra Wilde2, Joachim Bur- ger2, Gisela Grupe1,3, Silvia Codreanu-Windauer4, Michaela Harbeck3 department Biology I, Ludwig-Maximilians-University, Munich, Germany, Department of Anthropology, Johannes Gutenberg-University, Mainz, Germany, 3 State Collection of Anthropology and Palaeoanatomy, Munich, Germany, 4Bavarian State Conservation Office, Regensburg, Germany ramonaschleuder@gmx.de The morphological examination of an early medieval burial site in Burgweinting revealed, one female with an artificially, circularly deformed skull. According to the burial offerings, this cemetery is dated to the end of the 5th century. From this time, intentionally deformed skulls are rather known from nomads of the Eur- asian steppe, while graves with such deformations are rare in Central Europe. This coincides temporally with the invasion of Central Asian nomadic tribes (particularly the Huns) and indicates the strong cultural and fashion-related influence the Huns had on Germanic tribes. Regarding the artificial cranial deformations, it is not sure whether a foreign custom was taken over by Germanic tribes or whether the individuals were members or descendants of Eurasian nomads. With the help of the find of Burgweinting, we exemplarily investigated this question. To identify the possible foreign origin of the female with alleged "Asian" skull deforma- tion, we sequenced the HVRI region of the mitochondrial DNA and additionally typed 33 SNPs of the mitochondrial coding region by parallel tagged amplicon sequencing. In order to put the woman into a wider context, the other individuals found at the burial site will also be included in the analysis. Other methods applied were stable strontium isotope analysis to trace mobility of the individuals and the analysis of stable isotopes of light elements (C, N) to reconstruct dietary patterns. #60 "I feel happy with my body!" - The age-dependent development of body awareness in childhood Annette Schneider, Klaus-Günter Collatz Institute of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany. info@ako-schneider.de Introduction: Body awareness is defined as "the mental estimation of the person's own body, meaning its sensory and motor skills" (Haug- Schnabel 2002). The development of body awareness, based on motor and sensory experiences, starts in early childhood and its different components accordingly rise step by step. Material and methods: 562 children and young adults (6-17 years old) were interviewed with the "FFKB" (Schneider et al. 2007), a ques-</page><page sequence="37">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 521 tionnaire, which examined all the components of body awareness, e.g. physical activities, body perception, body feeling, health estimation, body concepts, family structure, social environment and BMI. Results: Nearly all the participants take part in school sport; however the sports activities in leisure time decrease with age. In addition, complacency with their body shape, positive feelings about their body and satisfaction with their state of health decrease with age. The participants state a connection between body shape and well-being, as well as between body shape and scholastic achievement. Interestingly e.g. headache occur- rence shows an age-dependent rise. Conclusions: Looking at the age-dependent decrease of sports activities combined with an age-dependent increase of negative body estimation it is necessary to search for pedagogical solutions such as on the one hand exciting and varied sports activities and on the other hand manifold possibilities to perceive the body with all kind of senses. This should happen also in school education but without being part of a for- mal grading process. If children feel well with and in their bodies, they will among other ben- efits be more resistant to negative influences such as unhealthy nutrition, alcohol or drugs. Literature Haug-Schnabel, G.

The sex-dependent estimation of the body in childhood Annette Schneider, Klaus-Günter Collatz Institute of Biology, Albert-Ludwigs-University, Freiburg, Germany. info@ako-schneider.de Introduction: The building up of positive body awareness describes an elementary and important part in child development. If a child feels well with and at home in its own body, it will take care of it and will be more resistant against negative influences (Haug-Schnabel 2002). Within a large study about the development of body awareness also the sex-dependent differences were investigated. Methodology: A total of 469 children and young adults (260 boys and 209 girls between the age of 7 and 17 years) participated in the study. They were interviewed with the "FFKB", a questionnaire which allows for an examination of all the components of body awareness (Schneider et al. 2007). Results: Both sexes had a high level of physical activity, but boys estimated their sports abilities much better than girls. Sex- dependent differences appeared in leisure time activities: girls favoured about artistic activi- ties and boys about watching TV or playing videogames. Boys described more often prob- lems with their social environment and wished to have more friends. Girls were less satisfied with their body shape and estimated themselves more often as fat and not pretty. Also girls described the outside and the inside of their bodies much more negative. Sex-dependent dif- ferences also occurred by health estimation and by the appearance of psychosomatic trou- bles: girls more often suffered from a stomach ache and boys from a headache. Conclusions: Sex-dependent differences in the development of body awareness should be realised and taken into consideration by child education, especially by health prevention to promote the children's feeling of well-being.

International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts #62 User Experience Research Inge Schröder, Harm Brandt, Jesko-Alexander Zychski Wissenschaftszentrum Kiel GmbH, Kiel, Germany. ischroeder@wissenschaftszentrumkiel.de Since decades Industrial Anthropology as part of Applied Anthropology analyses the interface between industrially produced products and their users. In the focus are ( 1 ) the delivery of metrical data, which enable those, who develop products, to adjust these to morphological and physiologic conditions of humans, and (2) the ergonomie testing of products. Looking at the product develop- ment cycle, which can be divided into a "what-phase" and a "how-phase", it can be stated that research activities mainly focus on the what-phase. Anthropologists, however, can provide impor- tant input for the what-phase, in particular within the framework of interdisciplinary collabora- tion. Open innovation, user participation, user-driven innovation or human-centred design arejust a few of many terms describing an actual trend, which considers the development of new products to be more than a technology driven process. As there is a lack of specific academic education, the field of user experience research is filled from many different disciplines. In a German-Danish project focussing on user-driven innovation (funded by the EU Interreg 4A programme), research- ers from anthropology, cultural studies, economic informatics, economy and design joined their forces to carry out tangible research and development tasks in cooperation with regional enter- prises. First results are available for different issues such as ( 1 ) the patient's perspective in a hospi- tal, (2) mass customization in a hotel or (3) a milk-based snack for school kids. An important goal of the project is setting up a virtual tool-box, which documents all methods that were applied with respect to different processes, products and context of use. #63 The skeletal remains from the Lichtenstein Cave: reconstruction of a Bronze Age family clan Verena Seidenberg1, Felix Schilz2, Tina Hollerbuhl1, Jenny Schubert1, Mareike Schiel1, Annette Jungk1, Margarethe Becker1, Bernd Herr- mann1, Susanne Hummel1 institute for Zoology and Anthropology, Historical Anthropology and Human Ecology, Uni- versity Göttingen, Göttingen, Germany, Landeskriminalamt Hessen, Department 732, Wies- baden, Germany. vseiden@gwdg.de Introduction/Material: In 1972 the Lichtenstein Cave in the Harz Mountains near Osterode was found containing a large number of human skeletal remains in a dislocated order. Over the last decade the bones were excavated and dated to the Bronze Age. Due to a constant low temperature and a cover with gypsum sinter the overall DNA preservation is exceptionally good. Thus, in a first phase of examination it was possible to reveal a kinship pattern for the majority of the initially identified 40 individuals. Additionally, several genetic markers were analysed to contribute to questions like e.g. the evolution of lactase persistence or the varia- tion of the immunogenetic disposition in context with infectious diseases. Methods: The kin- ship analysis was carried out by genetic fingerprinting and analysis of mitochondrial and y- chromosomal haplotypes. For the determination of the genotype of the other genetic markers mostly RFLP or SBE techniques were used. When the majority of the bones were recovered it became obvious that there are skeletal elements from several additional individuals. Thus morphological and genetic methods were combined to assign the long bones, the hip bones and shoulder girdle to individuals. The first step was a comparison of morphological resem- blance followed by verification using genetic fingerprinting in case of doubt. Results/Out- look: By now the number of individuals counts to 60-70. In the current phase of examination a kinship analysis for the newly identified individuals is performed and the genetic archive shall be completed analyzing these individuals for all before analyzed genetic markers.</page><page sequence="39">9.

The remains are of particular interest because the time period was characterized by social upheaval that resulted from the decline of the Western Roman Empire and the settlement of Bavarian tribes in the area. The burial objects suggest a connection to the Mediterranean region, which in turn raises the question of individual provenience of those buried. Whether they were Roman, local, or originated from elsewhere within the context of the Migration Period remains to be clarified. Isotopes of carbon, nitrogen and oxygen, which are part of the bones' carbonate and collagen, show a regionally specific distribution of isotopie ratios and are examined in this study. Spec- ification of geographic region of the individual's origin or path of migration can be ascer- tained by analysis of stable strontium and oxygen isotope ratios. The time frame combined with the small size of the cemetery suggests a close kinship between the buried, an assumption also shared by the archaeologists involved in this investi- gation. The identification of mitochondrial and Y-chromosomatic haplotypes should shed a light on possible kinship. #65 Experimental human tissue salt mummification and DNA degradation analysis Natallia Shved1, Cordula Haas2, Christina Warinner1, Katja Paulsen1, Christina Papageorgopoulou1, Frank J. Riihli1 Centre for Evolutionary Medicine, Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Zürich, Swit- zerland, institute of Legal Medicine, University of Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland. n.shved@anatom.uzh.ch Mummified human tissues are of foremost interest in forensics and biomolecular archaeol- ogy. The aim of this study was to analyze the degree of post-mortem DNA alterations in dif- ferent tissues in order to improve our knowledge of the level of DNA degradation that occurs during salt mummification. Human lower limbs used in the study were from a female donor's body (approved by Ethics committee). They were amputated ca. 24h post-mortem and mum- mified by an ancient Egyptian-like artificial mummification process with natron, a naturally occurring mixture of sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium sulphate and sodium chloride. At days 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 1 1, 14, 19, 25, 32, 38, 45, 52, 60, 73, 94, 125 and 322 post-mor- tem, skeletal muscle and skin were sampled. The level of nuclear DNA and mitochondrial DNA (nDNA and mtDNA) preservation was assessed by different methods: PCR amplifica- tion of different fragment sizes of the mtDNA and nuDNA, sex and autosomal chromosome genotyping with short tandem repeats (STR)-multiplex system, real-time PCR and sequenc- ing analysis. The study outcome shows a slower rate of skin genomic DNA fragmentation in comparison to muscle and only very minor changes in mtDNA amplification efficiency for both tissues during the experiment. Chromosome genotyping demonstrated stable STR pro- files for the skin and muscles at all investigated time points and incomplete STR profiles for the muscle towards the end of the experiment. We then compared the patterns observed in this modern study to DNA preservation patterns in ancient naturally salt mummified remains.

International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts #66 Body Mass and Body Mass Index estimation in medieval Switzerland Frank Siegmund1, Christina Papageorgopoulou2' 3 Seminar für Ur- und Frühgeschichte, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland, institute of Anthropology, Group of Paleogenetics, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany, 3Archaeological Service Grisons, Chur, Switzerland. papageor@uni-mainz.de Body mass (BM) and furthermore body mass index (BMI) are well-known proxies used in medicine as a diagnostic tool to identify weight problems, health risks, and to assess biologi- cal standards of living within populations. The prediction of body mass (BM) from skeletal material is still challenging, although many studies have indicated that BM can be estimated from human skeletal remains and results have been acquired from early hominines. The pre- sent paper applies BM estimation formulae (Auerbach &amp; Ruff 2004, Grine et al. 1995, McHenry 1992, Ruff et al. 1991) to skeletal populations from Switzerland (5th- 15th с AD; 291 males, 221 females) with the aim to reconstruct the BM and the BMI within a specific geographical and temporal setting. Correlation between the robusticity of the lower limbs in terms of external bone dimensions with BM and BMI were tested. Parameters such as sex and age were considered. The method of Auerbach &amp; Ruff (2004) offered the most reliable results. The mean body weight and the BMI for males was estimated 71.7 kg (s.d. 6.4) and 26.0 (s.d. 2.3), and for females 59.0 kg (s.d. 5.5) and 24.8 (s.d. 2.3), respectively. External bone dimension were highly correlated to body weight in males and females suggesting the strong correlation between biomechanical loading and long bone shape and size. The BMI was slightly increasing from adult to mature and slightly diminishing afterwards. #67 Regional variance in average height of 19-years-old conscripts in Switzerland in 1884-1891 and 2006-2009, and recent over- weight prevalence on district level Kaspar Staub1, Michael Hermanussen2, Ulrich Woitek3, Frank J. Riihli1 Centre for Evolutionary Medicine, Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Zürich, Swit- zerland, 2Aschauhof, Altenhof, Germany, 3 Department of Economics, University of Zurich, Zürich, Switzerland; CESifo, Munich, Germany. kaspar. staub@anatom.uzh. ch Anthropometric data from conscription in Switzerland allows tracing of medium-resolution regional variance in average height since the late 19th century. The Swiss-wide standardized and universal recruitment procedure was implemented in 1875. The group of conscripts is almost identical (80-100%) to the resident Swiss male population at age 19. In 1884-1891 the Swiss Army published the average height of the conscripts down to the level of all districts based on their place of residence. Regional variance in average height can thus be drawn out on maps, identifying regions were the conscripts were markedly small or tall. Explanatory variables like infant mortality rates, birth rates, protein production, migration rates, goitre prevalence or socio-economic indices explain the differences to some extend. If we contrast these data from the late 19th century by the corresponding individual con- scription data from 2006-2009, we see that the regional variance still exists today, even though to a smaller degree, and that the districts with small or tall conscripts switched. Socio- economic indices partially explain differences in the lowlands of Switzerland, but fail to in the alpine regions. In this respect we would like to present a new explanatory approach: today, average height of alpine districts is influenced socially through a target height, indicated by the average height of neighbouring districts within a certain range, and determined by easy or hardly passable roadways and mountain passes.</page><page sequence="41">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 525 The newest conscription data 2006-2009 also include weight measurements, allowing us to identify districts and regions, where BMI values and thus overweight prevalence of the young men are particularly high. We furthermore suggest some explanatory variables (move- ment and nutrition indices) and would thus like to provide new basic information for public health programs in Switzerland.

During the period ca. 270 to 400 a.d. there was massive production of clay-oillamps in the pottery workshop of Kerameikos. Excavations have revealed more than 30.000 fragments of such lamps. On more than half of them we find fingerprints which are very well preserved. In many cases underside the lamp we find also the name of the potter or the pottery workshop. We selected from this material and tabulated valuable data, following modern criminalisti- cal standards and methods, to make up a very important and useable databank. We want to find out a) who has worked here, b) if children were present, c) if women have participated in the production, d) if we can find information about exchange and the trade routes of this production, e) do fingerprints give us information about the anthropological characteristics of a population? We can bring the evidence that children were present during the production, but it is not clear yet if women worked in the production of clay-oillamps. The fact is, we could identify persons well and we found from the three main pattern groups prints which we can compare with corresponding data from literature. #69 Stature estimation from craniometries in archaeological and modern skeletal series of Switzerland Catherine Studer1, 3, Frank Siegmund2, Geraldine d'Eyrames1, Viviane Roth1, Alexandra Wenk1, Christina Papageorgopoulou1'4 1 Archaeological Service Graubünden, Chur, Switzerland, 2Seminar für Ur- und Frühge- schichte, University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland, 3Université de Neuchâtel, Neuchâtel, Swit- zerland, institute of Anthropology, Group of Paleogenetics, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. catherine.studer@unine.ch Stature estimation from skeletal remains is of primary interest to a broad field of disciplines e.g. anthropology, forensics, archaeology. Most stature estimation formulas are only limited applicable on partially preserved skeletal material. The aim of the present study is to investigate the likelihood of estimating stature from cra- niometrie data of 637 skulls found on a Swiss alpine ossuary (Poschiavo, 17th- 19th c. AD.). For this purpose available regression equations for stature estimation from craniometries were applied (e.g. Chiba &amp; Terazawa 1998, Kalia et al. 2008). The regression equations were tested on validation series of completely preserved skeletal material geographically and chro- nologically similar to the population from Poschiavo. The results reflected the mean stature</page><page sequence="42">526 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts of the regression equations reference populations and significantly reduced the intrapopula- tion variability of our validation series. A better approach was developed by systematically selecting similar reference series to the target sample by the sum of Euclidean distances of the cranial measurements. The individual stature is then estimated as a mean based on the ratios between stature and seven cranial measurements of the reference samples. The algo- rithm shows less attraction to the mean of the reference population and plausible intrapopula- tion variability. The algorithm was further tested and compared on a large series of completely preserved skeletons (ca. 1500 individuals) with positive outcomes. The accuracy of stature estimation from craniometries cannot be comparable to those from intact long bones. However, it is feasible in cases of partially preserved skeletal material useful within a bioarchaeological or a medico-legal context. #70 Overweight at the age of 17 years - are we able to predict it from early life events? (The results of Lithuanian longitudinal growth study, 1990-2008) Andrej Suchomlinov, Janina Tutkuviene Department of Anatomy, Histology and Anthropology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius Univer- sity, Vilnius, Lithuania. suchomlinov@yahoo.com Background: Increasing prevalence of obesity among children and adolescents promotes researchers to explore the origin of overweight in children during growth and maturation. The aim of the present study was to establish the prevalence of overweight and obesity in children from birth till the age of 17 years, and to reveal the relationship between BMI at birth, during each subsequent year of age, and at the age of 17 years. Material and methods: In total 1535 personal health records of children born in 1990 in Vilnius city and surrounding regions were analyzed. The main body size indices from birth till the age of 17 years, and the information about family status, pregnancy and delivery were recorded and analyzed. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was established according to the International cut-off points for body mass index (Cole et al. 2000). Results: The prevalence of overweight/obesity between Lithu- anian 17 year old boys and girls was 13.57/2.53 % and 9.38/1.76 %, respectively. Overweight 17 years old boys and girls had higher BMI already at birth, and became overweigh at the age of 8 years. 59% of 17 years old overweigh boys (but not girls) had a positive increment of BMI (adiposity rebound) during the fifth year of life (only 38 % of 17 years old boys with normal BMI had the latter increase). Conclusions: An early adiposity rebound may predict overweight/obesity at 17 years in boys; no aforementioned correlation was obtained in girls, possibly due to the small number of overweight/obese individuals. #71 Age estimation of adults - a new approach Peter Tarp University of Southern Denmark, Odense, Denmark. ptarp@health.sdu.dk Age estimation is a key element in anthropological analysis - in archaeological as in forensic. Therefore it is essential to optimize the existing methods and develop new ones in order to make the age estimation in adults more accurate. The idea of the method originates in cooperation between researchers from Penn State University, USA, Max Planck Institute for Demographic Research, Rostock, Germany, and University of Southern Denmark. Using logistic regression analysis and assuming conditional independence the analysis were built on the ideas of the Rostock Manifesto.</page><page sequence="43">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 527 In order to develop new and more accurate ways to estimate age skeletons from the Bass Collection in Knoxwille, Tennessee, USA and from the Coimbra Skeletal Collection in Por- tugal were analyzed. Age related anatomical characters on the fibula, tibia, femur, pelvis, ver- tebras, and the sternum were examined. Using the new anatomical structures for age estimation more accurate estimates can be obtained. An ongoing project may show that almost every bone in the body contains informa- tion about age at death - we just need to find a way to read the information about it. #72 Second to fourth digit ratio (2D:4D) and length of metacarpal bones: correlations with body size and hand grip strength Ausra Tomkut1, Gabija Tomkut1, Janina Tutkuvien2 'Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania, 2 Dept. of Anatomy, Histology and Anthropology, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania. ausra.tomkute@gmail.com Background: 2D:4D ratio is assumed to be related with the intrauterine level of testosterone. Metacarpal (M) bones had not been investigated in detail. The aim of the study was to investi- gate the second to fourth digit ratio, as well as length and ratio of metacarpal bones, to deter- mine their relationship with the main indices of body size and hand grip strength. Material and methods: In total 15 males and 14 females (20-30 years old) were investigated. The fol- lowing indices of body size and shape were evaluated: height, weight, BMI, circumferences of waist, shoulders and hips. The anthropometry and MRI of the hand was performed: the length of fingers and metacarpal bones was measured. Hand grip strength was evaluated. The analysis of Pearson's correlation between above mentioned indices was performed. Results and conclusions: Length of fingers and metacarpal bones was significantly shorter and strength of the hand was weaker in females than in males. 2D:4D ratio, as well as 2M:4M ratio in females was slightly bigger than in males. Digit ratio in males (but not in females) was negatively related with the height and BMI (the longer fourth finger - the bigger height and BMI). There was no correlation between 2D:4D ratio and the hand grip strength, but it was found a strong correlation between 2M:4M ratio and hand grip strength in males and females. The present study confirms the hypothesis that 2D:4D ratio reflects some andro- genic features, however, metacarpal bones, their length and ratio should be studied in detail. #73 Defining cut-off values for a local strontium isotopie signature - Results for the early medieval graveyard in Wenigumstadt, Lower Franconia Marina Vohberger Biocenter LMU Munich, Department Biology I Anthropology, Planegg-Martinsried, Ger- many. Marina.Vohberger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de Stable strontium isotope analysis is a commonly used method to identify migration events in historic and prehistoric populations. Recent discussions within the scientific community and international literature pinpoint that it is crucial to determine the local bioavailable isotopie signatures in archaeological horizons for each site under study. This is preferably achieved by analyzing bones from residential animals with a small home range. But what to do with an old excavation where no bones of such animals are available? The burial site of Wenigumstadt/Aschaffenburg county, Bavaria, was used from the end of the Migration Period until the middle of the 9th century and represents the development of an early Medieval population growing over approximately 400 years. The question therefore was whether migration events, which were assumed by the archaeologists, could be verified</page><page sequence="44">528 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts by stable strontium isotope analysis. The excavation site is not accessible anymore, so no additional samples could be collected. The example of Wenigumstadt shows that both statistical and geochronological tools can be useful. In a novel approach, the necessary agricultural catchment area for a supply of the resident population, based on paleodemographic data, was estimated to assess possible mixed isotopie ratios. In combination with soil samples from the graves taken during the excavation it was possible to define cut-off values for the local range of 87Sr/86Sr values. #74 X-ray Imaging and the Probability to Damage Ancient Cells: A Monte Carlo based Study Johann Wanek, Frank J. Riihli Centre for Evolutionary Medicine, Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Zürich, Swit- zerland. j ohann. wanek@anatom.uzh.ch Imaging modalities using ionising radiation e.g. the computed tomography (CT) or planar X- ray have reached the gold standard in physical anthropology. The large amount of post-mor- tem-induced DNA damages, the additional fragmentations caused by X-ray imaging may lead to miscoding lesions, which will prevent assessing of ancient DNA sequences. Up until now, less is known about the radio-sensitivity of dry cells in presence of low dose radiation. Previous experimental work was focused on studies using high-dose gamma radia- tion on cells or bacterial plasmids without considering the molecular structure close to the object of interest. Taking into account that metabolic inactive cells possess strongly limited water and oxygen content, we assume that the radio-sensitivity of desiccated cells will decrease significantly. First Monte Carlo (MC) simulations demonstrated that the probability of cell damages depends on the molecular composition of the tissue around the cells. We detected that the rate of X-ray photons hitting shrunken cells decreases and thus leads to an increasing number of unaffected cells. These findings suggest that ancient DNA fragmentation is less affected from X-ray imaging as expected. Such mechanistic and stochastic simulation methods predict the behaviour of low dose radiation in different anthropomorphic phantoms and have become a powerful tool for subse- quent studies at nano-level (e.g. ancient DNA fragmentation). Our results may have an impact of future imaging strategies of both physical anthropology and forensic science.

However, all information has been obtained through the analysis of written sources. To gain a better understanding about the processes that shape human mortality, especially in old ages, precise information about age-at-death derived from biological remains is necessary. Most methods of estimating age from skeletons result in open age intervals, which often start as early as 50 or 60 years of age, and lack accuracy and precision. Calibrated Expert Inference (CEI) solves these methodological problems by combining the knowledge about new - as well as some established - osteological indicators with statistical analysis to derive</page><page sequence="45">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 529 unbiased estimates of age at death. A single age indicator, the so-called "expert age", is pro- cessed statistically to derive an individual's age estimate. By using a non-parametric regres- sion technique, which allows for interval-censored data, there is no need to rely on linearity between the indicator and actual age, nor on homoscedastic error distributions. A maximum- likelihood procedure is used to estimate the population mortality pattern before the individ- ual age is calculated by applying Bayes' Theorem. We will present the osteological indicators that are used to obtain the initial "expert age" and show the first results where CEI has been applied to populations from historical Den- mark. These show that old ages can be identified with precision in skeletal material, and therefore it is possible to draw conclusions about the development of longevity in the past. #76 High incidence of craniosynostosis in a large ossuary collection from Switzerland (17th-19th c. AD) Alexandra Wenk1*, Geraldine D'Eyrames1, Viviane Roth1, Catherine Stu- der1, Christina Papageorgopoulou1' 2 'Archaeological Service Graubünden, Chur, Switzerland, 2 Institute of Anthropology, Group of Paleogenetics, Johannes Gutenberg University, Mainz, Germany. papageor@uni-mainz.de Craniosynostosis is a condition in which some or all of the sutures in the skull of an infant close prematurely (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craniosynostosis - cite_note-pmid 127 11969-1) causing skull deformities and brain growth problems. Craniosynostosis can occur as an isolated defect and less common as part of a syndrome (e.g. Crouzon, Apert). The prevalence of cranio- synostosis is one per 2200 births (Kabbani &amp; Raghuveer 2009). The oldest case is reported in Atapuerca, Spain and dates to 530,000 BP (Gracia et al. 2009). The present study reports a high incidence of craniosynostosis (1.1%) found in an alpine Swiss population. The sample concerns 637 skulls from Poschiavo ossuary ( 1 7 th- 1 9th c. AD). Three cases of anterior plagiocephaly (uni- lateral coronal synostosis), one case of posterior plagiocephaly (unilateral lambdoid synosto- sis), two cases of scaphocephaly (sagittal synostosis) and one case of brachycephaly (bilateral coronal synostosis) were found. Diagnosis was based on macroscopical and radiological exami- nation. The cases were observed at 3 adult men, 3 adult women and a six year-old child. The indi- viduals exhibit skull deformities and they have probably suffered from increased intracranial and intraorbital pressure. Differential diagnosis concerning positional plagiocephaly i.e. flat- tened head without premature synostosis and torticollis i.e. misshapen skull due to tilting of the head to one side is also discussed. Similar cases of craniosynostosis have been reported in geo- graphically close alpine populations (Papageorgopoulou 2008). Regarding the rarity of the con- dition according to clinical data and the few reports on the bioarchaeological record the presen- tation of such cases offers a great insight on the biological history of past populations. #77 Molecular genetic insights into the domestication of sheep Ingrid Wiechmann Ludwig-Maximilians-University of Munich, Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Institute of Palaeoanatomy, Domestication Research and History of Veterinary Medicine, Munich, Ger- many. I.Wiechmann@lrz.uni-muenchen.de Global surveys of mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in domestic sheep (Ovis aries) revealed five distinct mtDNA haplogroups (Meadows et al. 2007). These haplogroups were • designated as haplogroup A - haplogroup E. According to their distribution patterns, haplo- group A is also known as Asian lineage and the haplogroup В as European lineage. Haplo- group С has been identified in domestic sheep from Turkey, from the Caucasus region, from Central Asia and China. More recently, the two additional haplogroups D and E were</page><page sequence="46">530 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts described. Haplogroup D derived from a single mtDNA sequence obtained from a Karachai animal sample from the North Caucasus region. Haplogroup E was detected in two breeds of sheep in modern-day Turkey and Israel (Meadows et al. 2007). Archaeological and archaeozoological data indicate that sheep were first domesticated in the Fertile Crescent about 9.500 years ago. Molecular genetic data support this assumption and suggest that at least three independent sheep domestication events occurred in the Near East. DNA analysis of archaeological sheep remains may contribute to a better understanding of the sheep domestication process in the Fertile Crescent. Unfortunately, several ancient DNA studies indicated poor DNA preservation in skeletal remains from Neolithic sites in the Near East. Therefore it is uncertain if such investigations can make a significant contribution. Literature Meadows, J.R.S., Cemal, I., Karaca, O., Gootwine, E. &amp; Kijas, J.W.

O. Bollnow coined the term "pedagogical atmosphere" (Bollnow 1964, p. 1 1) based on Heideg- ger's "being in the world". (Heidegger 2004 / Orig. 1929/1930) In both cases basic predispositions of human existence in general as well as in pedagogical domains are found in moods as the base of each kind of "being in the world". All "higher" cognitive processes and mental phenomena are deeply influenced and coloured by these moods (Wimmer 201 1). The effects of moods and feelings as "bottom up" processes will be discussed as well as the whole sphere of culturally transmitted "top down" effects as there are symbolic systems, language etc. Education in general can be seen as a process located at the interface between theses "bottom up" and "top down" processes. The main goal of this talk is an integration of philosophical-phenomenological issues (e.g. Schmitz 2009) with actual (e.g. neurobiological) research, related to the question of affective- cognitive interactions. Intended is a deeper and more transdisciplinary view of educational processes - beside actual mainstream paedagogics - as part on integrative anthropology. Literature Bollnow, O.

International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 531 Background: Body composition of females with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) varies considerably. Skeleton peculiarities in women with PCOS have not been studied in detail. The objective of the present study was to investigate skeleton size and proportions in women with PCOS. Material and methods: In total 116 PCOS women (by Rotterdam crite- ria) and 8 1 healthy control women (20-33 y.) were investigated at Vilnius city in 2009-201 1 . All specific hormonal tests were performed. Height, body mass, 10 skeleton measurements, also body mass index (BMI), Frame index (FI) and Metric index (MI) were analyzed. Descriptive statistics and ROC analysis was applied to reveal the best indices for PCOS diag- nose. Results: Height did not differ in PCOS and control females. PCOS women had signifi- cantly higher BMI (27.47 vs. 21.76), wider shoulders, chest, elbows, pelvis, knees and ankles, higher FI and MI (p &lt; 0.01). After the adjustment for body mass, PCOS women pre- sented 0.8 cm wider chest, 0.33 cm wider ankle, 2.8 bigger FI and 0.23 bigger MI, but 0.91 cm more narrow pelvis than controls (p &lt; 0.05). PCOS women had massive skeleton 3 times more frequently than did controls. Pycnomorphic somatotype prevailed in PCOS females (39.7%), though leptomorphic somatotype dominated among controls (85.2%). Area under ROC curve discriminating PCOS for FI was 0.800, for ankle width - 0.791, and for MI - 0.774. Conclusions: PCOS patients had massive skeleton and pycnomorphic somatotype occurs more often in comparison to control females. Frame index, ankle width and metric index showed the best PCOS discriminatory abilities. #80 Body Composition as a Factor in Physical and Motor Develop- ment of Schoolchildren V.D. Son'kin Institute of Developmental Physiology RAE, Russian State University of Physical Education, Sports, Youth and Tourism, Moscow, Russia. sonkin@mail.ru Body composition of a healthy person is an external manifestation of his constitutional fea- tures. The most important property of the body that are directly influenced by his belonging to a particular type of constitution, is the nature and pace of the dynamics of the age of devel- opment. Experimental verification of this provision was carried out in a longitudinal study over 1 1 years of schooling. The study included regular anthropometric measurements of chil- dren, as well as standardized bicycle stress testing using an ergometrie model of Müller-Far- fel' -Son'kin. This allowed us to estimate the dynamics of growth processes, as well as the dynamics of the mechanisms of energy supply of muscle function. These results show that in primary school by the representatives of different body types vary considerably in level of motor development and the structure of energy supply of muscle activity. With the onset of pubertal development rearrangements enters a phase of turbulence, which excludes the possibility of reliable predictions of the nearest dynamics. Laminar flow of the processes of growth and development is restored after 14-15 years. In this leptosomia is most likely to combine with the prevailing development of aerobic capacity, mezosomia is characterized mainly by the development of power-speed capabilities, and brachisomia closely associated with the development of force. In a series of experiments it was shown that in most cases, the effectiveness of physical training aimed at developing of a "leading" ability is higher than in other cases. We call this principle as "towards Nature".</page><page sequence="48">532 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts #81 Amplitude-tempo decomposition of differences between cross-sectional growth references Stef van Buuren1, Michael Hermanussen2 ^ept. of Statistics, TNO Prevention and Health, Leiden, Netherlands, 2Aschauhof, Altenhof, Germany. Stef.vanBuuren@tno.nl Since the first half of the 19th century, data on child and adolescent height and weight have regularly been collected in many European countries. Growth data are available from almost all countries world-wide, and precisely document the continuous secular changes in human growth. The basic cross-sectional incremental pattern of the mean human growth curve in respect to its variation in amplitude and developmental tempo appears amazingly similar, regardless of the historic times, and the geographic origin of the data. Until now however, very few mod- els have developed that address differences in tempo. We present a meta-analysis of 1 86 male and 1 84 female growth studies published since the year 1830. Only those studies were included that reported data on at least the age range 2-18 years. Two PC A analyses were conducted, a conventional PC A addressing amplitude varia- tion, and a PCA on the transposed data addressing tempo variation. The explained variances of the first bi-component are approximately 90 % (of the amplitude variance), and 60 % (of the tempo variance). We illustrate a method to separate the tempo component from the ampli- tude component. The model characterizes each mean curve by just two numbers, one for amplitude and one for tempo. The bi-component model reveals a rigid incremental pattern of amplitude and tempo char- acteristics in cross-sectional height. The method can be used to appropriately describe growth at the population level, and to generate height references even in the absence of full range annual measurements from birth to early adulthood. Such synthetic references can be made by smart and efficient data collection designs. #82 Craniometry and Cephalometrics in the magnetic field with noXrayCeph Thorsten Brandt, Stefan Kopp University Frankfurt/M. Dept. of Orthodontics. Frankfurt/M, Germany. ThorstenBrandt@web.de The new craniometry without X-rays (noXrayCeph) by means of a 92g head cap represents an accurate direct measurement method. The new craniometry is based on a three-dimen- sional registration in a magnetic field. The carbon head cap in combination with a 3-D mag- netic scanner represents a digital presentation and cephalometric analysis technology for orthodontic diagnostics. The aim was to determine the accuracy of the noXrayCeph chepha- lometric device for repeated measurements. Ten patients were measured with the noXray- Ceph device and the reproducibility of the projection to the midsagittal plane was examined by means of 10 repeated measurements of the same patient on different days. The accuracy of noXrayCeph® were analyzed with the U-test according to Mann- Whitney. It was deter- mined that the accurate production of a craniometric/cephalometric drawing with the new magnetic device does not depend on a standard positioning of the patient. The device gener- ates reproducible drawings with different positioning on the patient's head. The error of the mean quartal deviation is &lt; 0.05. I.e. with the noXrayCeph method, projection errors are lim- ited and measuring can directly be controlled on the patient. We concluded that due to the construction of a new midsagittal plane with each measurement, it is possible to take repeated measurements directly on the patient. Statistical approaches of treatment and growth seem to be realized by frequent measurements.</page><page sequence="49">9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts 533 #83 Influence of special training on the ideas maintenance of representations, estimations and behaviour of children of the younger school age connected with a nutrition Alexandra G. Makeeva Institute for Developmental Physiology, Russian Academy of Education, Moscow, Russia. sonkin@mail.ru The aim of the investigation is to evaluate the role of school training by "Good Nutrition Pro- gram" in formation of healthy behavioural style in schoolchildren and their parents. Research in form of face-to-face interviews covered 2 regions of Russian Federation and among them 300 families (2010). The first part was held before children participation in program and sec- ond part - after 9 months of training. The majority of children and parents link nutrition and health in their minds. More than 85 % of parents face the problem of organizing correct healthy nutrition for their child. Among the basic problems - absence at the majority of chil- dren of 7-8 years base ideas about diet, absence of behavioural skills (so, only 45 % of chil- dren eat regularly 4-5 times a day etc.), absence of the positive attitude to useful products - (only 32 % of children love fish, 45 % - vegetables, 43 % dairy products). Participation in the special training program essentially changes knowledge, estimations and behaviour of chil- ien. As a result the quality of their food choices increases. The training program also influ- ences behaviour and estimation of parents - adults notice that the program has helped them to improve a food in the family.

Most methods use shape and size differences of certain skeletal elements that show sex-specific traits. One eye-catching sex attribute is the differing shoulder-hip-ratio. Although mainly caused by specific distribution of muscle and fat, the skeletal frame also plays a role. Therefore, sex-specific metric differences are to be expected. In this study, we tried to find a method to use these metric differences for sexing skeletal individuals. Because of the limited preservation of historic or forensic specimens, we looked for representative proxies with a good chance of preservation. For shoulder breadth, we chose the maximum length of the clavicle (Cl 1). For pelvis breadth, we used the breadth of one Ala ossis sacri (defined as Sc lat). The Sacro-Clavicular-Index (SCI) was defined as Sc lat/Cl 1*100. We examined 202 adult individuals from four archaeological population samples. Of these, 109 had been determined as male by established morphological means, 93 as female. We calcu- lated individual Sacro-Clavicular-Indices, and the means and standard deviations of Cl 1, Sc lat and SCI respectively. T-test results showed a highly significant difference between male and female groups in all four samples. By using the Weighted Boundary Calculation, we determined the mean diagnostic threshold as 30.2. Therefore, individuals with an SCI &lt; 30.2 should be male, those with an SCI &gt; 30.2 female. To test this discriminating value, we took the same measurements from the sex and age-known burials from the St. Johann cemetery in Basel (CH) in a blind study; a sample of 139 individuals yielded 102 reliable SCI values. We took an overlap value of ± 1 .8 points into account (10 % of the mean SCI span); in this range,</page><page sequence="50">534 9. International Congress of the German Society for Anthropology - Abstracts we expect more errors, while towards the extremes the correct sexing should be more certain. We diagnosed 61 individuals as male (SCI &lt; 28.4), 9 as probably male (SCI 28.4-30.2), 1 1 as probably female (SCI 30.3-32.0) and 21 as female (SCI &gt; 32.0). 82 % of the actual male individuals were diagnosed correctly by SCI, as were 100% of the females. As expected, there was a higher rate of error in the SCI range of 28.4 to 32.0; here, only 8 of 20 individuals were sexed correctly, with twice the number of error in males than in females. The method itself, and the empirically won threshold may therefore be considered as useful in sexing unknown skeletons. #85 Nutritional status and blood-pressure in Hungarian children Èva В. Bodzsár, Annamária Zsákai Department of Biological Anthropology; Eötvös Loránd University, Budapest, Hungary. bodzsar@ludens.elte.hu Objectives: In the present study the blood pressure of the subgroups of children with differ- ent nutritional status was compared along chronological age. The main goals were (1) to establish the critical cut-off values of hypertony in childhood and puberty; (2) to compare the blood pressure of the subgroups of children with different nutritional status along chronologi- cal age. Subjects and Methods: The study was carried out between 2003-2006 (Bodzsár &amp; Zsákai 2008). The blood pressure parameters of children (3100 boys and 3300 girls, aged 7- 1 8) were measured by Omron blood pressure device. Nutritional status was assessed by BMI, children were assigned to the nutritional status categories by using the age-dependent cut-off points (Cole et al. 2002). Body components were estimated by the Drinkwater-Ross (1980) four-component anthropometric fractionation method. The rearrangements in total body mass were characterized by the changes taken place in the bone-, muscle- and fat mass com- ponents. Results: Nutritional status was found to have significant influence on blood pres- sure in childhood and adolescence: blood pressure of overweight and obese children was higher than in children with normal nutritional status, while obese children's blood pressure was higher than blood pressure in overweight peers.
