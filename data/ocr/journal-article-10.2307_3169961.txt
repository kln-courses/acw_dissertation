<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHURCH HISTORY (p. 54). While there was some recovery in the 1350s, plague revisited in 1361 and toppled the precarious new balance. Having evaluated the degree of loss, Dohar goes on to assess the capacity of and the techniques used by the hierarchy to deal with the initial chaos and the longer-term issues of repeopling the clergy. To do this he has in the main examined the episcopal registers of the regnant Hereford bishops of the century. He uses the material of the first half of the century to develop a base against which to measure the experience of the second half, the post-plague era. The result is a fairly sterile recitation of data extracted from the registers, none of which is surprising. This is too bad because in many ways this is a very pleasurable book to read. Dohar writes well and those portions of the book where he is synthesizing other materials and establishing the framework for his own study are most felicitous. The two core chapters of the book are those dealing with diocesan and parochial administration after the Black Death and with clerical recruitment and pastoral provision in the same period. The first offers much detail but little analysis; the second, for lack of alternative, presumes at least some post hoc, propter hoc connections. Some bishops clearly did their jobs better than others, but in general Hereford was reasonably well served by them. Clerical recruitment, however, was complicated by being subject to many factors beyond the episcopal reach. Dohar examines the incentive of a man to become a priest, changes in patronage patterns associated with ordination, the seriousness of canonical examination of clerical candidates (and the flexibility that could be entertained here), and the frequency of ordination ceremonies performed by the bishop. He concludes that despite the enor- mous stresses of the post-plague environment, the church leadership held firm to its traditional patterns with few compromises. This may have been its gravest mistake, and Dohar suggests this in a graceful concluding chapter, where he opines that the question of a "decline in the quality of pastoral leadership does not so much revolve around the degree of change in the diocese as much as its resistance to change" (p. 153). Complicated and interwoven religious, economic, and social factors were at work in late-medieval England. Dohar knows this, but the narrow scope of his work fails to give him enough room fully to engage the subject. Case Western Reserve University ANN K. WARREN Cleveland, Ohio Through a Speculum that Shines: Vision and Imagination in Medieval Jewish Mysticism. By ELLIOT R. WOLFSON. Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1994. x + 437 pp. $49.50. The phenomenon of mystical experience in the Jewish tradition is fraught with theological contradictions. How can God, who is never imaged and, in 470</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS the whole tradition of revelation, only "seen" by Moses from the back (Exodus 33:19-23) be encountered in a "vision"? One answer has been to understand Jewish mysticism as a tradition of "auditions" rather than visions, as a purely nonrepresentational form of revelation. Elliot Wolfson's bold and erudite book takes issue with this, arguing that there is a visual aspect, in essence, a mirroring of the human and the divine, at the very heart of the Jewish mystical experience. The phenomenological approach taken in this book is important to the thesis. Wolfson is careful not to reduce Jewish mysticism to the visual phenomena he describes. Instead, he says, each generation of mystics experi- ences the divine in a "contextualized" manner, as "links in a continuous chain of tradition" (p. 53). For Wolfson, Jewish mysticism is inherently cognitive and, insofar as it reflects the coalescence of spirit and matter, symbolic, and thus calls for a hermeneutic framework of interpretation. Little wonder, then, that the texts of three periods of Jewish mystical flowering on which Wolfson bases his analysis are all intricate, difficult, and in large part unknown to the general student of religion, or even of mysticism. Only the most chronologically recent of these movements, the high medieval Spanish and Provencal theosophical kabbalah of which the Zohar is a major work, is generally known to scholars of Christian mysticism. Some selections from this tradition are widely available in English. Through the writings of Gershom Scholem, students of Christianity may also be aware, at least on a secondary basis, of the earliest period discussed by Wolfson, the Merkavah (chariot) or Hekhalot (Palace) mysticism of the early rabbinical period. The intermediary mystical movement, that of the "Haside Ashkenaz," the Ger- man pietists of the twelfth- and thirteenth-century Rhineland, is the least accessible outside ofJudaica circles. The common key to the experience of God in all of these traditions is the interaction of the visionary with the ten sefirot, the manifestations of God. Wolfson's understanding of the sefirot is that they are always, from the earliest period on, described in terms of anthropomorphic imagery. What is most original, even shocking, is that Wolfson argues for the centrality of the phallus in these texts. In Hekhalot mysticism, he discerns a "phallomorphic understanding of vision" leading to the assumption that "the mystic's vision of the Presence does entail an erotic relationship between the seer and the seen," an "overtly sexual quality" of expression (p. 104). Wolfson concludes by describing the historical development of Jewish mysticism as the move from implicit and esoteric to explicit and esoteric phallocentrism (p. 395); in sum, Wolfson claims, "the ejaculated penis is the object of vision" (p. 396). It is hardly surprising that this book has been the subject of controversy in the field of Jewish studies. A book of such striking originality must start a discussion, not end it. Further analysis of the texts studied here will either prove the general applicability or suggest the limits of Wolfson's thesis. The 471</page><page sequence="3">CHURCH HISTORY contours of this argument will be of great interest to students of Christian mysticism. There is, however, one point on which I must express my disappointment with Wolfson's handling of his provocative understanding of Jewish mysti- cism: his complete lack of gender analysis. Wolfson argues that Jewish mysticism is "always the male mystic visually confronting the male deity" (p. 396). He does go on to say that in this system the woman is part of the man and that the feminine is "ontologically reintegrated" into the masculine; nevertheless, the specularity of the visionary experience predicates a homo- erotic bonding between the human and the divine. The contrast to Christian mysticism is startling, since in medieval Christianity women participated fully, even (as Caroline Bynum has helped us to understand) visualizing themselves as the body of Christ. Wolfson's thesis would seem to suggest that the paucity of women mystics in the Jewish tradition is directly related to the impossibility of a woman experiencing specular homoeroticism of the ejacu- lated phallus. The implications of such a suggestion should lead to scholarly studies of many types. University of Pennsylvania E. ANN MATrER Philadephia, Pennsylvania La Certosa di Casotto: Le Fasi Medievali. 2 vols. By SILVIO CHIABERTO. Analecta Cartusiana 60:4. Salzburg, Austria: Institut fur Anglistik und Amerikanis- tik, 1995. xiv + 163 pp.; 148 pp. This work examines the medieval history and archaeology of the northern Italian Carthusian monastery of Casotto. It is in two volumes: the first is the study, and the second presents black-and-white photography of the excava- tions at Casotto and of various other Carthusian monasteries which the author uses to help clarify the site at Casotto in the Middle Ages. As the author notes, there are very few cartulary documents remaining which speak of the monastery in the period covered, and in addition, the excavations at the monastery have provided almost no information for the period he covers. The author rather employs a methodology of examining the architecture of other Carthusian monasteries of the period, particularly the monastery of Pesio which was founded by the monastery of Casotto, and the documents which speak of the structure of the monasteries and of the life of the monks in them. He attempts to apply this information analogically in retrospect to the monastery of Casotto. In doing this he frequently states his positions hesitatingly, employing the Italian subjunctive to make many of his statements about the monastery. This is the weakness of the work. It is a very limited study of a regional, historical, and archaeological monument of which almost no concrete information remains. The author speculates on the date of foundation, on the movement of the location of the monastery, on the 472</page></plain_text>
