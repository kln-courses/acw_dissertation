<plain_text><page sequence="1">BJHS, 1993, 26, 469-83 Gender and the historiography of science LUDMILLA JORDANOVA- The production of big pictures is arguably the most significant sign of the intellectual maturity of a field. It suggests both that the field's broad contours, refined over several generations of scholarship, enjoy the approval of practitioners, and that audiences exist with an interest in or need for overviews. The situation is somewhat more complicated in the history of science, since the existence of big historical pictures precedes that of a well- defined scholarly field by about two centuries. Broadly conceived histories of science and medicine were being written in the eighteenth century, when such an all-encompassing vision was central to the claims about the progress of knowledge upon which Enlightenment ideologues set such store. The Plato to Nato style histories, characteristic of the earlier twentieth century, were written largely by isolated pioneers, and while these were used in teaching as the field was becoming professionalized, recent scholars have preferred to concentrate on a monographic style of research. Despite the existence of the series started by Wiley, and now published by Cambridge University Press, it is only in the last ten years or so that more conscious attempts have been made to generate a big-picture literature informed by new scholarship.' It is noteworthy that most of this is addressed to students and general readers, although there is no logical reason why it should not tackle major theoretical issues of concern to scholars. My point about maturity still holds, then, since as a designated discipline the history of science is rather new; it is still feeling out its relationship with cognate disciplines. Big-picture histories have an important role to play in these explorations since they make findings and ideas widely available and thereby offer material through which ambitious interpretations can be debated, modified and transformed. * Department of History, Vanbrugh College, University of York, York YO1 5DD.

Readers should note that this article does not attempt to offer a survey of the literature on gender. 1 Examples of eighteenth-century survey histories are William Black, An Historical Sketch of Medicine and Surgery, from their Origin to the Present Time; and of the Principal Authors, Discoveries, Improvements, Imperfections and Errors, London, 1782, and Adam Smith, 'The principles which lead and direct philosophical enquiries; illustrated by the history of astronomy', in Adam Smith.

Many kinds of big picture are possible, and the routes to them are the same in the history of science as in other historical fields. There are, broadly speaking, three well-established routes: taking a long chronological sweep, using a broad geographical span, and tracing high abstractions. The appeal of extended chronologies for historians hardly requires special examination. They enable us to write about long periods during which shifts happened only slowly and in piecemeal fashion, to point to times of accelerated or sluggish change in the context of a larger narrative, to highlight momentous developments. I sense that this path has gone out of fashion and that few professional historians are willing to take on periods longer than a century. None the less, we all employ ideas that only make sense in terms of such long sweeps, of which 'modern' is among the most interesting and treacherous. In both teaching and research we require ways of visualizing the general differences between one era and another.2 Tacitly, then, historians operate with big chronological pictures all the time, even if they are reluctant to commit themselves to their precise content in print. The second route involves geographical breadth, whether at tegional, national and/or continental levels. Although it is possible to draw examples from a variety of places, regardless of where they come from, this does not produce a big picture but a medley. More promising is a rigorous, self-consciously comparative apprdach, in which areas are selected to be studied together that have both similarities and differences. Multiple points of comparison thereby emerge, while a comparative approach cuts down the sense of isolation that can result from a single case study.3 The history of science is uniquely well placed to develop comparative perspectives, given both the self-conscious universalism and internationalism of most forms of natural knowledge and the power of local factors to shape their manifestations. Very little work of this kind has so far been attempted, and what there is has been inspired more by sociological than by historical methods.4 In the absence of a range of satisfactory models, it is not yet clear exactly which topics in the history of science will be best suited to comparative treatment, or which units and levels of comparison will be most appropriate. It is vital to keep an open mind on this question; although it is often assumed that nations are the most suitable, other possibilities need to be considered; the ones selected will depend on the historical problem in question, with which they need to fit. Comparative methodologies are, I believe, central to the use of 2 On 'modern', see Marshall Berman, All That is Solid Melts into Air: The Experience of Modernity, London, 1983; Raymond Williams, Keywords: A Vocabulary of Culture and Society, London, 1983 (revised edition), 208-9; Anthony Smith, The Concept of Social Change: A Critique of the Functionalist Theory of Social Change, London, 1973; Nicholas Xenos, Scarcity and Modernity, London and New York, 1989.

Gender concerns the relationship between two elements that are simultaneously akin and distinct; since each makes sense only in the context of the other, the term itself implies comparison. Furthermore, like all major themes, its historical characteristics can be delineated more precisely if more than one case is considered. The third route uses abstract ideas as the organizing principle of historical research. Two distinct kinds of ideas can function in this way. The first are concepts, such as class, gender and modernity, which are part of the analytical vocabulary of the twentieth century. The second are important concepts from and in the past, such as nature, and the great chain of being.5 Here the 'bigness' derives from the generality of the ideas, from their having a more than local significance, from their being dense enough to carry varied, even contradictory concerns. The history of ideas is perhaps less fashionable than it used to be, but its alliance with the history of science is an honourable one of long standing. Some of the problems associated with an ideas-led approach will be mentioned below. Intellectual fashions certainly affect the selection of contemporary concepts as explanatory tools. Currently notions like 'the self' and 'the subject' are in vogue, only a few years ago it was 'state' and 'hegemony', the popularity of 'ideology' waxes and wanes, as does that of 'class'. The terms 'sexuality' and 'patriarchy', appeal to some precisely because they evoke so directly a sense of a big picture. This sense is made possible by the frameworks, both political and theoretical, which give individual terms their energy and significance. Far from being alternatives, these three routes can be combined in various ways and could well be used together. Seductive as they may be as ways of doing big history, it is vital to understand their weaknesses. For instance, long chronological sweeps and studies of abstractions cannot take for granted the stability of their object of study. Studies of ' science' and of scientific disciplines are particularly vulnerable here. For example, writing a big history of biology is a problematic undertaking. What counts as biology in the centuries before the term existed? What criteria should be used as sort mechanisms? How are the meanings of biology to be charted in different periods, institutions and regions to ensure minimal stability ?6 Whilst all historical problems are to a degree arbitrarily defined, some kinds of arbitrariness are more damaging than others. In the history of science, anachronistic assumptions about the organization of natural knowledge remain a problem, and they distract attention away from the processes whereby major fields are named and formed as such. Sometimes this has far-reaching historiographical effects. The relations between biology and medicine are a case in point. For the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, it is impossible to draw rigid lines between them. This is partly but not exclusively because medicine was a recognized way of earning a living and obtaining a training and so could be combined easily with other scientific activities - an attractive prospect to those without independent means. Yet historians often write as if biology and 5 Arthur Lovejoy, The Great Chain of Being: A Study of the History of an Idea, New York, 1960, and Essays in the History of Ideas, New York, 1960; Clarence Glacken, Traces on the Rhodian Shore: Nature and Culture in Western Thought from Ancient Times to the End of the Eighteenth Century, Berkeley, 1967; George Boas, Vox Populi: Essays in the History of an Idea, Baltimore, 1969. 6 Garland Allen, Life Science in the Twentieth Century, London and New York, 1979; William Coleman, Biology in the Nineteenth Century: Problems of Form, Function, and Transformation, London and New York, 1971 and Nordenskiold, op. cit. (1).</page><page sequence="4">472 Ludmilla Jordanova medicine were quite separate, both intellectually and socially, and hence distinct historiographical approaches grow up, the result of projecting backwards common- sensical disciplinary divisions. This is not to deny that there are valuable distinctions to be made by historians of this period, between, for example, medicine and natural history. At the same time, these fields remained blurred, indeed they were so in different ways with respect to education, theories, practices and organizations, which also varied with local circumstances. Insights about such a complex situation can only emerge with any sharpness if the processes by which terms, such as natural history and medicine, are clarified become historical phenomena, to be studied in their own right. This is because they are the tip of a social and cultural iceberg, and provide important clues about its composition and formation.' A second weakness of traditional big picture history is the kind of generality involved. The three routes I have outlined tend to have difficulty placing local phenomena. In the search for generality, the local is marginalized. The very term 'local' evokes associations with what is parochial and anecdotal, but it need not be so. If we believe with Clifford Geertz that 'the shapes of knowledge are always ineluctably local, indivisible from their instruments and encasements', then local studies are not just a source of useful examples for big-picture projects, but are central to their conceptual frameworks.8 Big pictures that deny this are only superficially generous in their scope. They also run the risks of decontextualization, of lifting salient, and often atypical examples out of the settings that produced them and gave them meaning, and juxtaposing them to other examples similarly yanked from their home environment. In order to explore the role that gender can play in the history of science, I will suggest a somewhat different approach to big pictures, one that retains some of the strengths of the three approaches already mentioned. Satisfying big pictures come from a rich sense of context, from an appreciation of how science, in its broadest senses, inhabits and is produced by its milieux. 'Context' involves more than descriptions of relevant institutions and professional groupings, plus biographies, although these are indeed part of it; I am asking for more than 'background', that notorious term of relegation. The need is for a notion of context that has real analytical bite.9 The goal is a better grasp of socially salient features, that is, of features that can both be convincingly linked to, say, gender and used to explain its manifestations. Inevitably, what counts as socially salient is a matter of debate. It follows that focused case studies, of regions, groups, themes and so on, will be central to this sort of big picture, as will sophisticated comparative methods to bring them together and analyse them. These approaches can be applied most obviously to geographical areas, and also to themes such as class formation and gender, to institutions, to fields of knowledge, to events, such as revolutions, to discrete periods of time. To put 7 Robert Westman, 'The astronomer's role in the sixteenth century: a preliminary study', History of Science (1980), 18, 105-47 and James Weisheipl, 'The nature, scope, and classification of the sciences', in Science in the Middle Ages (ed. D. Lindberg), Chicago, 1978, 461-82 consider the issue of discipline formation; another approach is via histories of science: Rachel Laudan, 'Histories of the sciences and their uses: a review to 1913', History of Science (1993), 31, 1-34. 8 Clifford Geertz, Local Knowledge: Further Essays in Interpretative Anthropology, New York, 1983, 4. 9 See the relatively new journal Science in Context and James Secord's review of it in Isis (1990), 81, 289-90.</page><page sequence="5">Gender and the historiography of science 473 it this way is to evoke the practices of those historians of science who have been most successful in demonstrating the social-cum-cultural nature of science.10 Yet, since these have been developed largely in the context of specific case studies, they have not yet been thoroughly integrated into a survey literature that reaches beginning undergraduates and general readers. Perhaps this is because they represent two different historical modes, which do not sit easily together; it is vital that the conceptual issues implicit in this absence of fit are thought through. Although it might appear at first sight that gender is a theme that slots easily into the conventional surveys, its potential can only be realized if it is treated comparatively and contextually. It is a theme of the right kind of generality for producing big pictures - its scope is sufficiently generous, its significance sufficiently great. Using the concept of gender is one aspect of a larger intellectual approach, a form of comparative social and cultural history. Gender is important because it is a fundamental category, that is, it expresses something of general importance to people and to the ways in which they experience and understand themselves and their world. The fact that the word 'gender' has been used in its present sense only for a relatively short period of time, and that its formal linguistic properties vary markedly from one language to another, does not lessen its broad analytical significance.11 While it is now common to liken gender to race and class, scholars are becoming increasingly aware of the need for more deft explorations of vocabularies of social difference, for an understanding of their histories and of their explanatory properties. To treat them simply as alternative social sort devices results in a mechanistic history. Furthermore, it is possible to argue that gender is of particular significance, both for the general understanding of Western cultures and for the history of science. There is a huge amount of evidence to suggest the central role that gender plays in socialization, in mechanisms of control, in organizing both behaviour and ideas, in representing powerful abstract notions. Beneath gender lie many sets of binary pairs. Its social centrality is possible because it resonates with the dualistic framework that underlies Western traditions, and because it encompasses two elements that have assumed the status of natural distinctions; they are deemed to have been underwritten by empirical observations and endowed with authority by virtue of their rootedness in nature. The separations between spirit and matter, and between mind and body have a particular relevance to gender; many pairs of masculine and feminine characters are related to them, although some ally femininity with the material side, others with the mental. Much early feminist work in the history of science and of medicine was dedicated to unmasking the processes whereby differences between the sexes were naturalized, and to claiming that such differences were made up to serve non-scientific, that is political ends.'2 Special attention was paid to the marked asymmetry beneath gender, evident in the way women 10 E.g.

Since feminist research has also been concerned with women as practitioners of science, it is essential to distinguish writings concerned with gender from those that reclaim forgotten women scientists and restore their lost voices.13 These are distinct projects, intellectually, politically and emotionally. Of course, there are situations where, by their very presence, female practitioners challenge the status quo and/or take issue with gendered scientific assumptions and practices. But this does not necessarily occur, and has to be established case by case. Gender may have many attributes, but ease of definition is not one of them. Gender is emphatically not another way of talking about women, nor is it a topic or subject area; it is an analytical category. It has this in common with terms that express forms of social difference - age, caste, clan, tribe - that it is simultaneously a way of ordering experience, a system of representation, and a metaphor for particular kinds of relationships. The way historians use the term is, of course, historically specific, being a product of the scholarly interests that have burgeoned since the 1960s in sexuality and in feminism. Gender, then, is a concept that expresses a widespread and highly complex phenomenon: the representation of the multiple relationships between masculine and feminine. By this token, gender is not about men and women, about entities, but about constellations of attributes associated with two (naturalized) forms of humanity. It cannot be stressed too often that diverse types of attributes are involved, expressing a variety of relations between masculine and feminine, and this is because gender is indeed everywhere and possesses the capacity to represent so many ideas. There can be no doubt that gender is quite exceptionally deep- rooted psychically speaking, which makes it an important area for historians, but also one that is something of a minefield. The claim that gender is a, perhaps the, fundamental differentiator between people requires some unpacking. Human societies organize and classify their members according to general concepts, which, taken together, constitute their cosmology. What is usually called 'sex' is important in such processes, and, although this has something to do with anatomy, it is far from being fully determined by it. Societies exist that have 'hermaphroditic', asexual and suprasexual roles, that do not believe organs determine social role. Sexual differences are important not because they are physiologically 'real', but because they relate to processes of paramount social significance - production and reproduction. I am deliberately casting this claim in general terms in order to point up the kinship between history and the disciplines - above all anthropology and sociology - that of the Experts' Advice to Women, London, 1979; Lorna Duffin, 'The conspicuous consumptive', in The Nineteenth-Century Woman Her Cultural and Physical World (ed. S. Delamont and L. Duffin), London, 1978, 26-56. 13 Margaret Rossiter, Women Scientists in America: Struggles and Strategies to 1940, Baltimore, 1982; Pnina Abir-Am and Dorinda Outram (eds.), Uneasy Careers and Intimate Lives: Women in Science, 1789-1979, New Brunswick and London, 1987; G. Kass-Simon and Patricia Farnes (eds.), Women of Science: Righting the Record, Bloomington and Indianapolis, 1990. In The Mind Has No Sex? Women in the Origins of Modern Science, Cambridge, Mass., 1989, Londa Schiebinger has attempted to bring together the study of women practitioners and changing ideas of sexual difference.</page><page sequence="7">Gender and the historiography of science 475 offer more abstract accounts of societies in general.14 In doing so, concepts are required that draw attention to their common features, such as gender and reproduction. These concepts have histories, which the history of science is uniquely well-suited to uncover, at the same time as they have analytical value for us. Their histories as concepts are inseparable from the general histories of the societies that deploy them. We can note that, in general, children are assigned to socially-forged categories, such as male and female, and that their identities are formed around these categories, without in any way lessening the importance of the particular mechanisms and settings involved. This statement concerns what is sometimes called 'sex roles', a general term for phenomena that vary markedly from one setting to another. To understand how sex roles work in a given context is to have understood something of that society's history. 'Gender' is the term that scholars of many disciplines employ to analyse all this - the feelings and experiences that get inside people, the processes whereby they do so, and the associated ways of ordering the world. Having a general discourse on these matters certainly assists in the comparative project already mentioned, and it permits a more sophisticated interdisciplinary analysis, since findings and insights can move between fields. Furthermore, it alerts us to how widespread the phenomena are, which in turn suggests the level and nature of appropriate explanations. I have suggested that in Western traditions what are taken to be the differences between men and women should be seen as natural bases upon which diverse attributes associated with masculine and feminine have been elaborated. Scientific and medical traditions have been central to the processes of naturalization involved, but gendered characteristics have pervaded all aspects of social life. How have they done so ? In order to respond to this question, it is necessary to examine the role of metaphor, and to employ the idea of representation. As Ivan Illich put it: 'gender bespeaks a complementarity that is enigmatic and asymmetrical. Only metaphor can reach it. '15 Gendered metaphors work through the reciprocal movements of attributes between persons and non-persons. Masculine and feminine characteristics have been linked in this way with occupations, skills, talents, virtues and vices, places and objects, colours, textures and shapes, powers, activities and so on. Metaphorical associations of this kind possess their own logics. For instance, the common associations between woman and nature, have led on the one hand to a wide range of maternal connotations - nurturance, protection, benignity - and on the other to a set of sexual ones - wildness, insatiability, danger. These can co-exist, not just in the same societies, but in the same people. They can also be felt as polar opposites.

Oscillations and reversals occur all the time. The association between femininity and the passions (rather than reason) has generated a rich, and enduring metaphorical vein. Feminist writers of the eighteenth century sought to associate women, through feminine properties, with reason, and hence sought also to make plausible the idea that metaphors of arbitrary power carried a masculine freight."6 Natural knowledge deploys and generates such metaphors. It is a fundamental tenet of the historiography I am outlining, that gendered discourses should not be given the status of descriptions, but of constructions, in order to draw attention to their fabricated quality, and to the importance of laying bare the processes whereby they were made. While it is generally assumed that these are either in the realm of the conscious or that their status is in this respect indeterminate, this is an arbitrary, and intellectually limited, position. The kind of phenomenon gender is suggests that its unconscious aspects are important and that attempts should be made to analyse these with the most effective tools available.17 Those who study the visual arts have placed particular emphasis on the notion of representation, in order to draw attention to precisely the constructed status of images. 'Images' can encompass far more than pictures, just as the concept of representation has a place in disciplines other than art history and film studies. While historians of science have a sophisticated social constructionist literature on which to draw, they could also derive a great deal from writings on representation. Personification is a particularly fruitful area, not just because it links abstractions to gender, and more especially to female forms, but because some of the most important modern symbols, such as those associated with nations, vividly reveal the complexities of the gender-politics nexus.18 To say that gender is about forms of representation is not to evoke a disembodied world of images and ideas. On the contrary, it is precisely because masculine and feminine are embodied in so many ways that masculinity and femininity become, through social and cultural practice, integral to customary ways of thinking, feeling and acting. Gender has two aspects. First, it can be used to sum up the facet of societies I have just discussed. Second, it can be used to analyse that facet. So far as is known, all societies talk about the way human beings reproduce, and, more broadly, about gender. These discourses may have something in common, but the content of gender is highly variable. None the less, over several centuries, Western European societies developed ideas about gender that have proved remarkably tenacious, even as other ones shifted. We are the direct heirs of such complex traditions, which, indeed, have shaped the intellectual tools now in use. The single term, 'gender' is thus doing at least four conceptual jobs, which, although 16 'Sophia', Woman Not Inferior to Man, London, 1739, and Mary Wollstonecraft, A Vindication of the Rights of Woman, London, 1792 are well-known examples. 17 Evelyn Fox Keller, Reflections on Gender and Science, New Haven and London, 1985, part 2, and 'From secrets of life to secrets of death', in Body/Politics: Women and the Discourses of Science (ed.

It is, first, a term for the frameworks available in the past to organize sexual difference. Natural knowledge played an important role in constructing and changing these frameworks, and was itself moulded by them. By extension, gender, secondly, refers to the framework currently in existence, which has shaped us. Gender is, thirdly, a term of analysis that enables the structures of cultures in general to be understood; more specifically, it enables social scientists to compare very different societies, to probe the degree to which shared ways of constructing sexual difference exist in time and place. Finally, it is a modern concept that helps scholars in general to explain past phenomena. Historians of science will be most concerned with the first and fourth usages. These distinctions, which are somewhat arbitrary, none the less serve some valuable purposes. The most important of these is reminding scholars of the need for a critical distance between gender-then and gender-now. If this is not done, scholarly reaction is likely to be angry, even hostile to past ways of imagining gender. Thus, some historians of science and medicine have construed the dichotomies around masculine and feminine as directly oppressive to women, it is as if they blame them for creating societies that think differently about gender from our own. They appear to think of ideas as having a self-evident power, and of gendered pairs as dispensable once unmasked. If some illnesses, such as hysteria and chlorosis, were associated more with women than with men, more than labelling was involved.19 If differences between male and female bodies were elaborated to suit existing preconceptions, their plausibility still needs explanation. Historians of science and medicine are well qualified to take on the difficult job of explaining precisely how ideas acquire power, how gender and its associated binaries are compelling. To do justice to this task involves a measure of detachment from the past, hence the value of trying to keep gender-then and gender-now apart, and of recognizing their distinct, yet complementary conceptual roles. Most Western scholars, especially English-speaking ones, have been socialized into an essentialist way of thinking that focuses on the intrinsic properties of objects. It is a way of thinking that is, to put the claim in its mildest form, profoundly akin to traditions of scientific thought. Our habits of mind resist alternative approaches, often caricatured as imprecise, neglectful of the 'real' world, overly abstract, not to say abstruse. It is hard to acknowledge the historical reality of phenomena that cannot, or rather, should not, be reified. Class is the example par excellence of this issue. E. P. Thompson's claim that class is not a thing but a relationship is often cited. It led him to develop a rich historical methodology in which he sought out instances where the nature of class relationships became clearly visible, generally because of marked shifts in economic and legal relations, registered at an experiential level, and then subjected them to close scrutiny.20 Gender can 19 Ilza Veith, Hysteria: The History of a Disease, Chicago, 1965; Elaine Showalter, The Female Malady: Women, Madness and English Culture, 1830-1980, London, 1987; Karl Figlio, 'Chlorosis and chronic disease in 19th-century Britain: the social constitution of somatic illness in a capitalist society', in Women and Health: The Politics of Sex in Medicine (ed.

It does not disappear when invisible to historians, but starting a historical study with cases where it assumes a more vivid manifestation is an effective heuristic device. Thus, the 'problem' of male hysteria, the advent of the speculum and the obstetric forceps, and the viciousness of eighteenth-century debates about midwifery are all instances where issues came forcefully to the surface, permitting historians a particularly clear insight into gender relations.2' In relation to both class and gender, their traces permeate a society, which means an abundance of material, themes of sufficient breadth and depth to generate big pictures, and a fund of unstable moments through which their complexities and multi-facetedness can be exposed. Historical relationships and processes, chosen by virtue of their links to a major theme, are used in this approach as vehicles to capture human complexity. The goal is generating alternatives to traditional historiographies that construe motivation in terms of interests, causality in terms of economic, or some other, determinism, and that privilege things and events over relationships and processes. In short, traditional historiographies carry a strong component of scientism, to which historians of science are especially sensitive. Recent research on gender has helped to expose such scientism, and it has further insights to offer the field precisely because scientific knowledge itself is quite centrally about gender. Two distinct propositions are contained in the claim that scientific knowledge is about gender. The first is that forms of knowing are dense with gendered assumptions. If nature is likened to a woman, then the production of natural knowledge can be construed sexually, for example, as the penetration of mysterious secrets which she needs to be coaxed, or coerced, into giving up. Francis Bacon has become the figure most cited on this point; indeed, a more general claim is sometimes made that his position is indicative of a change in the gendering of natural knowledge that was integral to the scientific revolution.22 Or it is possible to imagine that nature has a feminine voice, to be listened to, as Claude Bernard did.23 If the acquisition of knowledge is a heroic quest, then the seeker, using currently available tropes of heroism, has powerful masculine models with which to identify, through which all aspects of the quest are thought. Although it has sometimes been treated in a rather crude, ahistorical manner, this proposition has been the cornerstone for much significant work. The second proposition is that the content of natural knowledge mediates gender relations by virtue of its goal to explain nature; I shall consider it briefly here. For centuries 'science' has addressed the nature of social difference and has tried to 21 Mark Micale, 'Hysteria male/hysteria female: reflections on comparative gender construction in nineteenth- century France and Britain', in Science and Sensibility: Gender and Scientific Enquiry 1780-1945 (ed.

In other words, categories of putatively natural distinctions between persons, and, of other analogous 'sets', are at the heart of science and medicine. Not all such distinctions hinge on a dualistic framework, but many do. So that whereas for many centuries age has been understood in terms of stages of life, often seven, and some social categories, such as classes and estates, go in threes, there are a striking number both of paired distinctions and of other dichotomies with which they are associated. In both English and Scottish law of the eighteenth century, for instance, we find husband and wife, master and servant, parent and child. Given the diversity of peoples in the world, the persistence of the polarity black and white is notable.24 So too is the more recent classification of people by sexual orientation, making the apparent firmness of a line between heterosexual and homosexual as contradictory to what is 'known' as that between black and white. And this immediately alerts us to the fact that the distinction is doing a good deal of other work. Yet none of these are quite as pervasive, insinuating and imaginatively rich as male and female, although all these oppositions are allied with others in which social distinctions are implicit rather than explicit - head and hand, mind and body, reason and emotion, nerve and muscle. Recently scholars in the history of philosophy and of political thought, for example, have examined the ways in which dualistic thinking has structured modes of thought for centuries. The gendered pair public/private, for example, has a long history, which is gradually being unravelled.25 Scholars have insisted upon the complexity of binaries, and especially of male and female.26 These can be treated hierarchically (the female is an imperfect male), as polar opposites (female is passive, male is active), as complementaries (female nurtures while male hunts) or as two points on a continuum (both have the same hormones in different proportions). And, once models of masculine/feminine are in place they can be widely applied. Gendered pairs determined the ways in which the reproduction of animals and plants was understood, sometimes with quite misleading results, they provided languages for alchemy, chemistry and the study of electricity. They are most obviously central to the life sciences, medicine, the human and social sciences. It is worth noting that some of the sciences in which, by virtue of their subject matter, gender is most important, have been seriously neglected by historians; the pre-eminent example is embryology, and the point applies to most of the scientific fields that have sought to explain reproduction.27 The solution would not, however, be to study embryology from the Greeks to the present day, for that would be to use as an organizing theme an exceptionally anachronistic 24 Winthrop Jordan, White over Black: American Attitudes Toward the Negro 1550-1812, Baltimore, 1969. 25 Jean Elshtain, Public Man, Private Woman: Women in Social and Political Thought, Oxford, 1981, and Meditations on Modern Political Thought: Masculine/Feminine Themes from Luther to Arendt, New York, 1986; Susan Okin, Women in Western Political Thought, Princeton, 1979; Henrietta Moore, Feminism and Anthropology, Cambridge, 1988, ch. 2; Genevieve Lloyd, The Man of Reason: 'Male' and 'Female' in Western Philosophy, London, 1984, especially ch. 5. 26 Ian Maclean, The Renaissance Notion of Women, Cambridge, 1980; and the works cited in note 25. 27 On embryology see Elizabeth Gasking, Investigations into Generation 1651-1828, Baltimore, 1966; Shirley Roe, Matter, Life, and Generation: Eighteenth-century Embryology and the Haller-Wolff Debate, Cambridge, 1981; T.

Rather a history of 'embryology' that took gender seriously would start by asking how a given society conceptualized and visualized conception, gestation, birth, growth, sexual maturation and so on. Clearly several such conceptualizations can co-exist, including within scientific and medical communities. The goal is to understand the ones claiming scientific status within the canons of their time in the context both of the others and of prevailing practices. If achieved, the result would be a big-picture history, which encompassed the societies studied. In Western scientific traditions, accounts of reproduction provided definitions of male and female, worked through assumptions about appropriate masculine and feminine behaviour, and sometimes elaborated specific stances on issues such as the age of marriage, control of marriage partners, management of birth, child-rearing, inheritance rights, abortion, prostitution and so on. Thus practices, and other forms of discourse, in this case around the family, were integral to the formation, use and alteration of concepts, in this case around theories of reproduction. The key concepts in the sciences of reproduction, deriving their meaning from the quotidian processes in which those who deployed them participated, touched far-reaching and emotive social preoccupations. The elaborate construction of meanings around body parts is revealing here. It is now well known, for example, that the breast was used in the second half of the eighteenth century as an icon of femininity, as a vehicle for discussing responsible reproductive behaviour, and as an object in nature, and thereby everyday life, natural knowledge, and moral-cum-aesthetic judgements were strategically blurred. The metonymic status of the breast in this period, was enjoyed by the ovary and the uterus in the nineteenth century.28 The absence of male equivalents is striking. Unravelling all this cannot be achieved without gender as a tool, that is, without gender-now to help us appreciate gender-then. Research that has been done on telegony, on nineteenth-century gynaecology, and on midwifery suggest just how rewarding this strategy can be.29 Historians of science might want to do more than study scientific areas where reproduction was the explicit object of investigation. As Marilyn Strathern's anthropo- logical work has revealed, reproduction is a paradigm - it stands as a model for social relations.30 The precise attributes of 'reproduction', and hence the kind of model it is, depend on the society and period in question. In the second half of the eighteenth century in Britain, for example, one way in which reproduction was conceptualized was as the production of commodities, and thereby as subject to the laws of supply and demand. Adam Smith was perfectly explicit on this point.31 The consequences of this 28 Ludmilla Jordanova, 'Naturalizing the family: literature and the bio-medical sciences in the late eighteenth century', in L.

His assertions about natural laws of population are well known although they are rarely placed in the context of late eighteenth-century thinking about reproduction.32 The consequences for economics/ political economy were equally significant if labour processes were considered 'natural' in strict analogy with making babies. It is certainly not coincidental that in this period naturalistic accounts of the division of labour and of social differentiation, rooted them in what were treated as primitive, that is original, sexual distinctions.33 Thus a good deal hangs here upon precisely how reproduction - nature's production - is conceptualized. It is easy to demonstrate for the twentieth century, with its widespread demographic consciousness, that reproduction, the paradigmatic productive process, was central to matters such as abortion, fertility and birth control, pharmacology and the pharmaceutical industry, medical technology and welfare programmes, to mention only the most obvious areas. Since these matters concerned political liberties, national productivity and legal rights, they have reached far and deep into modern societies.34 Such concerns have been more intense at some historical moments, and among some groups, than others. One instance of this, in early political economy, has already been mentioned; there, the direct links between production and reproduction were made exceptionally, and systematically, explicit in a novel way. To say this is not to talk only of ideas, for the writings of political economists bore a complex, dialectical relationship to practice, their own and other people's. Indeed the division of labour is a particularly interesting example of this point, since it was rooted on the one hand in naturalistic accounts of relations between the sexes and on the other in the daily life of households and institutions. No suggestion is being made here of direct, one-to-one links between reproduction (in theory and practice) and the division of labour (in theory and practice), since the relationships involved are highly mediated. Accounts of 'natural' relations, which chime with lived experience, make some social practices and cherished assumptions so acceptable and obvious that to doubt them is profoundly counter-intuitive. In a nutshell, this is what happens with gender. Because rooted in our conceptions of the natural, certain practices and modes of thought are validated, others are not. Thus, when the pioneer of scientific management, F. W. Taylor, grasped for a way of conveying to his readers that very stupid workmen could be made into efficient, productive, disciplined workers, he compared them, unfavourably, to intelligent gorillas. This statement remains incomprehensible outside the context of contemporaries' concepts of race, class, gender and evolutionary hierarchies. Haraway's writings suggest that primates have functioned in the twentieth century as 32 Malthus, An Essay on the Principle of Population, Harmondsworth, 1970. 33 Starting at least with Hobbes' Leviathan, political theorists, including political economists, turned to supposedly natural and original situations and used the relations between men and women that they imagined to have obtained there as models, both positive and negative, often treating them as naturalized legitimations of social relations more generally: Elshtain, op. cit. (25) and Okin, op. cit. (25). 34 Anna Davin, 'Imperialism and Motherhood', History Workshop Journal (1978), 5, 9-65; Jane Lewis, The Politics of Motherhood, London, 1980; Ann Oakely, The Captured Womb: A History of the Medical Care of Pregnant Women, Oxford, 1984; Naomi Pfeffer, The Stork and the Syringe, Cambridge, 1993. 20 BJH 26</page><page sequence="14">482 Ludmilla Jordanova central vehicles for the naturalization of social relations.35 Taylor analysed the division of labour as a fact of nature, but a nature maleable enough to be moulded by engineers. Historians have to find out what makes this possible, intellectually, socially, emotionally; concepts like gender provide valued assistance. I have argued that gender cannot be seen in isolation from larger historiographical issues, many of which pertain to history writing in general and not just to the history of science. Gender, then, is but one term in our conceptual armoury, which needs to be stocked up with a range of concepts of this kind; to get the most out of such concepts, their history, their use in related disciplines, and their explanatory potential need to be understood and critically assessed. Gender does not, I have insisted, describe social groups, and it is certainly not to be seen as an indirect way of talking about women. By contrast, it is about the dynamics between the sexes, as these are experienced, explained and represented. It manifests itself in innumerable ways, at material, ideological and symbolic levels. It is not a biological given, but a cultural product, and hence is not inherent in objects but assigned to them through social and cultural practices. As embodiments of such practices, the natural and bio-medical sciences fully participate in the forging of gender, and are themselves informed by it. As fields with a privileged relationship to nature, they play a major role in explaining and disseminating gender as a naturalized category. There are respects in which gender resembles other categories of social difference that derive their authority from nature, such as race and class. Like them, it is simultaneously a socially constitutive phenomenon and an analytical tool. It is unlike them in being even more pervasive temporally, geographically and psychically than they are. Gender is most likely to be of value to historians of science as part of a broader set of commitments - to context, to culture, to comparative methods, to social constructionism, to change as a plurality of rhythms. It can contribute to big pictures that do not depend on conspicuous grandiosity, but on their ability to evoke the complex patterns of human existence in a coherent manner. This coherence is made possible through the use of themes, such as gender, of wide scope. In effect this is to argue for a particular kind of big picture into which the local, the rooted, the fully contextualized accounts of science have been integrated. It follows that many facets of history would thereby be linked together - material life and ideology, conscious and unconscious lives, individual and collective phenomena, spiritual and economic experiences. And, while gender is but one piece in the jigsaw, its special relationship to science and medicine makes it a powerful instrument of historiographical reappraisal.36 35 Frederick Winslow Taylor, Principles of Scientific Management, New York and London, 1911, 40, cited in Ludmilla Jordanova, Sexual Visions: Images of Gender in Science and Medicine between the Eighteenth and Twentieth Centuries, Hemel Hempstead, 1989, 118; Donna Haraway, Primate Visions: Gender, Race and Nature in the World of Modern Science, New York and London, 1989, and Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature, London, 1991. 36 In addition to works already cited, the following journals are relevant: Gender and History; Genders; Journal of Gender Studies; Gender and Society, as are the following books: Mary Poovey, Uneven Developments: The Ideological Work of Gender in Mid-Victorian England, Chicago, 1988; Thomas Laqueur, Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud, Cambridge, Mass., 1990; Elaine Showalter, Sexual Anarchy: Gender and Culture at the Fin de Siecle, London, 1991; Judith Walkowitz, City of Dreadful Delight: Narratives of Sexual</page><page sequence="15">Gender and the historiography of science 483 Finally, I must confess my scepticism on two points, not so much about gender as about big pictures. Perhaps the notion of picture is misleading. Pictures are two-dimensional and flat - the historiography I have discussed should provide a more three-dimensional view of the past, that is, a view that is contoured rather than flat. And, perhaps big is not the right adjective. This implies brute size, whereas historians strive for imaginative reach, for a generosity of spirit that enables them both to enter into and interpret worlds very different from their own. In place of huge physical dimensions, we would have subtle, sympathetic understanding. In other words, might not the idea of a big picture itself be somewhat gendered? Gender, then, may well prove to be a powerful tool for opening up a more critical awareness of our own forms of being and knowing, as well as for interpreting the past.
