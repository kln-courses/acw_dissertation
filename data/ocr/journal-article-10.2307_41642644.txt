<plain_text><page sequence="1">Guy Tal An &gt;Enlightened&lt; View of Witches Melancholy and Delusionary Experience in Goya's Spell* On 27 June 1798 the Duke and Duchess of Osuna purchased from Francisco Goya (prob- ably by commission) a series of six cabinet pic- tures incorporating the subject of witchcraft to decorate their suburban villa, La Alameda, near Madrid.1 By this time the controversy about the existence of witches had virtually been resolved: most inquisitors and philosophers had refuted their reality, and prosecutions of alleged witches had dramatically declined.2 It would therefore be reasonable to assume that Goya's witchcraft scenes were conceived and received as pure fic- tion.3 Indeed, art historians have variously deem- ed the series »imaginary,«4 »humorous,«5 »frivo- lous,«6 »entertainingly terrifying«7 and a »satire on the senses.«8 My intention in this essay is not to challenge this notion but to explore another facet in Goya's series relating to the contempor- ary incredulity in witchcraft. Because the six pic- tures in Goyas series, much like the plates in his Caprichos album of about the same time, are not united by a single story or cohesive meaning, it • seems reasonable to examine each picture sepa- rately. This essay focuses on the picture often called The Spell (fig. 1). Though in the eighteenth century belief in the reality of witches was deemed utterly absurd, the existence of widespread scepticism by no means eliminated the need for restating the false nature of witchcraft through a compelling rationaliza- tion. For example, Voltaire, in the entry »goat- sorcery« in his Dictionnaire philosophique , did not merely denounce the witchcraft phenome- non as an »abominable chimera«; he also rationa- lized its existence by using a contemporary psy- cho-medical explanation that diagnosed alleged witches as insane.9 As I will show, Goya partici- pated in the psycho-medical discourses of the * I would like to thank Mitchell Merback for his careful reading and useful suggestions. i For the series and the payment records, see Pierre Gas- sier and Juliet Wilson, The Life and Complete Work of Francisco Goya , New York 1971, 164, cat. nos 659-64; Juliet Wilson-Bareau and Manuela B.

Basically, it has propelled two antithetical answers: a visual image reinforces the veracity of witches on the premise that »seeing is believing« or, alternatively, dis- suades such belief by virtue of its fanciful content.

My path of analysis does not guarantee a single, clear-cut »solution« for The Spell. A scene of witchcraft has all the prerequisites for incomprehensibility and ambiguity. Inconsistent and fluid, the witchcraft domain involves flexi- ble and transformable substances, deceptions, phantasmal visions and delusions - all of which obscure the clarity of the image, the confidence in sight, the chronology of events and the mechanism and purpose of the depicted magic. For these reasons and because, as I will argue, The Spell is devoid of a fixed narrative and inde- pendent of verbal commentary, the scene resists any straightforward reading. Rather, it oscillates on the spectrum between corporeal reality and delusion. Sowing the seeds of its polarized read- ing, Janis Tomlinson evocatively argues that the victim's nightshirt denotes that »he has been transported in his sleep«; yet »whether this is only a bad dream or a factual encounter with the supernatural remains unresolved.«10 Andrew Schulz explores further the fantastic and the real in Goya's art of that time by showing how, in the Caprichos , these two poles instigate tension between two aspects of vision - observation and fantasy.11 Corroborating Tomlinson and Schulz, my investigation elaborates this ambiguity by examining the veracity of sight in The Spell. I will propose that the witches in the scene can be reckoned as either real or a figment of imagina- tion. Those invited to La Alameda, the intended audience for Goya's witchcraft series, would cer- tainly have been keen on the intellectual experi- ence of deciphering pictures with multiple levels of meaning. At La Alameda, the duchess hosted tertulias , or salons, where musical and theatrical performances took place as well as intellectual discussions on diverse topics. These were led by such prominent figures of the Spanish Enlight- enment as the poet Tomás de Iriarte, the social satirist Ramón de la Cruz, the humanist Gaspar Melchor de Jovellanos, the playwright and poet Leandro Fernández de Moratín and Goya him- self. The extensive library of the duke and duchess - 6,500 volumes, including treatises on magic and witchcraft - backed up these erudite conversations.12 Although the records of pay- ment to the artist fail to identify the specific room in which the witchcraft pictures were intended to be housed, their literary and scholar- ly subject matter in all likelihood slated them for placement in the library or some other public space in the mansion.13 We can readily imagine the tertulia guests engaging in lively conversation, brainstorming and debating the potential meaning of these cap- tivating pictures. Each of the enlightened view- ers, granted interpretive license, could have gene- rated ideas based on his distinctive area of knowl- edge. Goya, a frequent visitor to the Alameda estate, where his patrons reserved a special house for him, must occasionally have joined these conversations and served as a reliable guide to his own creations. Perhaps he pointed out contem- poraneous ideas and interpretive methods to aid in deciphering the paintings: their ambiguities, déjà dit que plus de cent mille prétendus sorciers ont été executes à mort en Europe.

Although the two alternative ways of interpreting The Spell presented here were not necessarily premeditated by Goya, they would have been potentially available to its in- tended audience and encouraged by virtue of the ambiguities built into its semantic structure. The imagined scenario of such a rendezvous, along with the absence of a textual source and the ever thorny task of interpreting a witchcraft scene, prompts the premise that Goya's witchcraft series presents an intellectual challenge for the &gt;enlightened&lt; viewer and encourages a multiplici- ty of readings. Decoding Body Language The Spell offers a haunting spectacle. In a deso- late place, under a murky sky populated with flapping owls and bats, five gruesome witches cast a spell on a cowering victim. Four of the witches, dressed in black and holding magic appurtenances, are assembled in a semicircle, while an anthropomorphic assistant descends on them, head first, from above. This horrific super- natural attack climaxes in the foreground with a fifth witch, clad in yellow, approaching mena- cingly and stretching out her hands toward the terrified figure cowering before her. He - or she, for gender is indeterminable - sports a night- shirt, and his apprehension is evidenced by the head tilted sideways, the staring eyes and the tightly intertwined fingers. With his bright attire, dramatic illumination by an oil lamp, proximity to the picture plane, direct facing towards the viewer and telling body language, it is this figure that commands our attention. The Spell , like the entire series, has been sub- jected to an iconographie analysis that hinges on textual references and yields clear-cut meanings. Two pictures in the series, The Devil's Lamp and Don Juan and the Statue of the Commandant , illustrate episodes from two early eighteenth- century plays by Antonio de Zamora.14 For the rest, Edith Heiman has proposed the accounts of confessions in the 1610 auto-da- fé in Logroño as key sources. These records, she argues, would have been accessible to Goya through his friend, the aforementioned playwright Moratin, who had annotated the Logroño inquisitorial trial record from 1797 until its publication in 18 12. 15 Frank Heckes has read The Spell through a par- ticular confession recorded in the Logroño accounts: A certain Graciana de Barrenechea, identified by Heckes as the yellow-clad witch, is taking revenge upon her rival witch, Marijuan de Odia, the kneeling victim. Assisted by the Devil (the figure descending from the sky) and other witches, Graciana awakens Marijuan at night - hence the nightshirt - and poisons her.16 This literary approach has been endorsed by another scholar, who has asserted that in Goya's witch- craft series »literary sources weigh more [...] than the intellectual debate on the subject.«17 But 14 Gassier/Wilson (as note 1), cat. nos 663-64; Nord- strom (as note 12), 154-58. 1 5 Goya was in close contact with Moratin especially in 1796-97.

At the same time, eighteenth-century theater manuals recommend- ed that actors learn body rhetoric from painting and sculpture: Dene Barnett, The Art of Gesture: The Practices and Principles of 18th Century Acting, Hei- delberg 1987, 122-26. 3 6 Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 75. Band/ 2012</page><page sequence="5">it would be worth considering whether the opposite might be the case. To begin with, Goya's explicit reliance on theatrical episodes in two pictures from the series does not necessarily imply that the entire series rested upon specific texts; it may indicate rather that only these two scenes rely on a fixed, identifiable narrative, while the other scenes entail different ways of being read. As for reading the series through the Logroño trial record, this proposal falls short on grounds of accessibility: Most viewers would not have been familiar with either the accounts of a long-forgotten trial or Moratin's annotation, which would have been published only in 1812. If the Logroño confessions did play a role in Goya's conception of the scene, they were at best only a point of departure.18 As an alternative I would like to propose that we construe The Spell as a generic scene, un- restricted by any particular text or event, and that we privilege semiotics over iconography as a working methodology. Literary scholar Karen Newman defines the practice of witchcraft as »a semiotic activity that depends on acts of reading, systems of differences«; accordingly, our under- standing of witches is »a process of labeling, of reading and interpreting signs.«19 Still, the task of sign decoding is not an easy one, for an image of witchcraft refers to a set of practices with which no one is familiar, a set of codes without a stabile set of referents. Hoping to grasp the mechanism of magical procedure in Goya's Spell , the behold- er would perhaps first scrutinize the witches in order to decipher their activities. Sooner or later, however, he or she would realize that magic's aims and processes (its appurtenances, activities, language and gestures) are all impenetrable and indecipherable. What can be deciphered, however, is the response of the victim. Here, body language holds the key to understanding the scene. Since Goya's series was viewed in conjunction with the plays performed in the tertulia , the theatrical subject matter in two pictures of the series and the performative mode of representa- tion in the other scenes seem appropriate. In The Spell , theatricality is evident in the narrow stage, the frontal stance of the actors, the flat, »paint- ed« backdrop and the artificial illumination of an oil lamp that spotlights the confrontation between adversary and victim.20 Another theatrical con- stituent is the body rhetoric. Goya's recognition of hand gestures as a useful means of visual com- munication in art abides by the advice of his pre- decessors. Both Leon Battista Alberti and Leo- nardo da Vinci, whose writings were available in Spanish by the end of the eighteenth century, recommended that artists study the gestures of orators, mutes and monks bound to silence as a means of animating their figures with gestures that would articulate their inner emotion.21 Goya's interest in gestures, however, went beyond his recognition of their effectiveness in art. He was obliged to use them in his daily life as well, since a severe illness in 1792 had left him deaf. This misfortune arguably made his concern with gestural language more telling.22 The wide range of gestures through which Goya transmitted expressive ideas includes ges- tures that are recast to convey several things.23 While this polysemy may be a critical downside 22 His familiarity with sign language is evidenced by his drawing of a struggling couple entitled with the gesture of victory (Gassier/Wilson [as note 1], cat. no. 1446) and, even more patently, by his systematic copy of gestures signifying the alphabet from two instruc- tional books, one written by the sixteenth-century monk Pedro Ponce de Leon and the other by Goya's contemporary Lorenzo Hervás y Panduro. See Bar- bara Kornmeier, »Ydioma universal« - Goyas Taub- stummenalphabet im Kontext seines Geniekonzepts, in: Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte LXI, 1998, 1-1 7. Sign language had an acute weight on his life, as his letter from 22 March 1798 to King Carlos IV testifies: »For the last six years I have been greatly indisposed, especially having lost my hearing to the extent that I am unable to understand anything without the use of sign language.« A few days later, on 27 March, Goya movingly writes to his friend, Martin Zapater, that he appreciated the efforts of Jovellanos, who »learned to speak with his hands, and stopped eating to talk with me.« Sarah Symmons, Goya: A Life in Letters , Lon- don 2004, 252-53. 23 On the role of gestures in Goya oeuvre, see Martin Warnke, Goyas Gesten, in: Goya &gt;Alle werden fallen&lt; , Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 75. Band/ 201 2 37</page><page sequence="6">in the sphere of non-verbal communication, in the visual arts it provides a challenge to the culti- vated beholder to determine the pertinent mean- ing of a gesture in accord with the depicted event. Consider the victims intertwined fingers in The Spell . With this same gesture a man mourns the deceased in plate 9 of the Caprichos , a Spaniard pleads for mercy or perhaps admits his defeat in The Third of May 1808 , the Virgin accepts her fate in The Annunciation and Saint Peter fervent- ly repents in one of Goyas last paintings.24 While the meaning of intertwined fingers in each of these examples is relatively clear, decoding its role in The Spell is a more complex task. The victims threatening situation may encourage associating this gesture with its traditional meaning of pray- ing. Alternatively, Roberto Alcalá Flecha, relying on gestural instructions of eighteenth-century theater manuals, reads this gesture in The Spell as an expression of desolation and anguish. Accord- ing to Flecha, the victim's gesture complements the physiognomy of fear and despair evident in the wrinkled brow, the half-open mouth with down-turned corners and the wide-open eyes.25 Given the terrifying situation, contemporary spectators would surely straightforwardly have read horror in his body language. Nevertheless, the intertwined fingers might equally have struck spectators as a sign of a quite different mental condition: melancholy. Folke Nordström, in his Goya , Saturn and Melancholy , has already associated the witchcraft series with melancholy.26 But while his association is based on the pictures' gloomy atmosphere, I would argue that in The Spell , melancholy plays a far more compelling role. Melancholy, a mental and physical state that differs considerably from sim- ple sadness, affords the scene novel meanings because it is deeply entrenched in early modern witchcraft discourse. Before delving into these issues, I would like first to establish the victim's gesture as one signifying melancholy. Modern scholarship, primarily the seminal Saturn and Melancholy by Raymond Klibansky, Erwin Panofsky and Fritz Saxl, has underscored the time-honoured pose of the head resting on the hand as the gesture most often identified with melancholy in early modern Europe.27 Intertwin- ed fingers, though a less-studied gesture by com- parison, was by the end of the eighteenth century well established as a code for melancholy in thea- ter manuals, instructional treatises of sign lan- guage and works of art throughout Europe. The German philosopher and theater director Johann Jakob Engel, in his manual of gestures for actors, Ideen zu einer Mimik {Ideas on gesture , Berlin 1785-86), underpins the versatility of the inter- twined-fingers gesture: »To insert the fingers between each other, the hands being upon the lap« (the very pose of the protagonist in The Spelt) is »the expression of those who plead, sub- mit, and resign themselves up with supplication ed.

The title and concept of Gilbert Adison's Chironomia of 1806 (which includes the intertwined fingers) is considera- bly inspired by Bulwer's treatise. See John Bulwer, 3 8 Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 7 5 .

His Chirologia: or the Natural Lan- guage of the Hand and Chironomia: or the Art of Manual Rhetoric , published in 1644, was an influential treatise throughout the Continent well into the eighteenth century.29 Each gesture is explained in a commentary that outlines its meaning and demonstrates its applications by cit- ing from past literature, and each is illustrated by the novel device of a chirogrammatic plate, a fea- ture that surely captivated artists. In the entry »Tristi tia animi signo,« or »I show mental anguish,« Bulwer defines the intertwined-fingers gesture as »the sluggish expression [of those] who are fallen into a melancholy muse« (fig. 2). 30 Bulwer and Engel had by no means invented the coding of this gesture as melancholy. In a late sixteenth-century series entitled The Four Tempe- raments , designed by the Flemish artist Maarten de Vos and engraved by Raphael Sadeler, the Melancholic tableau features a naked woman rol- ling her eyes aloft and intertwining the fingers of her raised arms (fig. 3). Her gesture signifies the multifaceted condition of Melancholy, which inflicts the wide range of symptoms listed in the text appended below the image: violence, anxiety, fatigue, and so on. This print is exceptional among representations of melancholy, and yet it attests to the standardization of the intertwined fingers as a visual signifier of melancholy. Goya may neither have known of Sadeler s print nor read the treatises of Bulwer or Engel.

Band/2012 39</page><page sequence="8">the gesture as a signifier of melancholy was some- thing close to common knowledge in his time. Cause and Effect: Witches Generating Melancholy or Vice Versa ? The first interpretive possibility I am proposing maintains the standard reading of Goya's Spell as an attack of witches on a hapless victim. In this reading, melancholy is a disease inflicted on the victim by the witches' maleficia . Robert Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy (1621) refers to such supernatural power in the section »Of Witches and Magicians, how they cause Melancholy.« The practitioners of magic collaboratively inflict melancholy by applying an array of methods: »The means by which they work are usually charms, images [...] constellations, knots, amu- lets, words, philters, etc., which generally make the parties affected [by] melancholy.«31 In The Spell , the magic operation, too, entails various types of apparatus and routine: the witch on the left signals with one hand and holds an oil lamp in the other; the hag next to her sticks pins into a manikin; the third sorceress recites incantations from a book of magic that she reads by the light of a candle; and a fiendish figure on the far right crams sacrificed infants into a basket. I want to question this earlier description of The Spell as &gt;witches cast a spell on their cowering victim&lt; by way of an alternative interpretation. I am proposing that despite their corporeal appear- ance, the witches are a projection of the cowering man's imagination. This understanding necessi- tates reversing the intuitive reading of the scene's chronological sequence. The narrative construct- ed by the beholder is now activated not by the witches, who cast a spell on the cowering figure or afflict him with melancholy, but by the cower- ing figure's delusional melancholic mind, signal- ed by his gesture, which generates an apparition of witches. By the end of the eighteenth century, melan- choly was a complex physiological state encom- passing multiple symptoms, and it could designate forms of malaise with severe symptoms.32 Since the pictorial vocabulary of melancholy does not distinguish between the different types of symp- toms, it becomes the beholder's task to determine the symptom best matching the scene's context. It is my contention then that the melancholic symp- tom most suited to the scene in The Spell is a delusionary mind. In eighteenth-century medical discourse delusion was underlined as the prime symptom oï the disease of melancholy. For exam- ple, Richard Mead, an eminent English medical authority celebrated abroad, wrote in Medical Precepts and Cautions (175 1) that for one to suf- fer from melancholia was »to be sad and dejected, to be daily terrified with vain imaginations; to fancy hobgoblins haunting him.«33 Richard Bax- ter strengthened the connection between melan- 3 1 Robert Burton, The Anatomy of Melancholy (London 1613), ed.

The fear and desolation in the victim's face are, according to contemporary phy- sicians, the two major traits of melancholy.

This rea- soning was promulgated by sceptics and by the defenders of witches in the prevalent debate about the witchcraft phenomenon. Two main theories that evolved in the sixteenth century rationalized the witches' supernatural powers as mere delusions that afflicted their diseased minds. The supernatural explanation held by the Dutch physician Johann Weyer (1515-88) claim- ed that the melancholic illness, which predomi- nantly afflicted women, so weakened them that the devil consequently entered their minds and led them into delusion. The natural explanation of the English author Reginald Scott (c. 1538 - 99) deviated from Weyer's theory by eliminating the devil from the process.35 Unsurprisingly, eighteenth-century physicians and philosophers advocated the latter 's explanation and buttressed it with contemporary psychological notions and medical theories.36 Goya's horror story turns out to be a subject of enlightened medical reasoning. At least two frequent participants in the Alameda tertulia could have informed Goya and the other guests of this explanation. The first, Moratin, was aware of the sceptical responses to the Logroño trials. In a critical analysis of the trial accounts, the humanist Pedro de Valencia argued that witch- craft could be real but could also stem from visions caused by melancholy or sickness of the mind and inflicted by the devil.37 The inquisitor Alonso de Salazar Frias, one of the judges who presided over the Logroño trials but objected to the proceedings of the other judges (he was later commissioned by the Supreme Tribunal of the Inquisition to further investigate witchcraft), concluded that the majority of the acts of the purported witches were utterly imaginary.38 The second potentially informative guest was the sceptical Jovellanos, whose portrait Goya paint- ed at about the same time as he worked the witchcraft series, in 1798. In a comment dated August 1798, Jovellanos praised a certain eight- eenth-century satirical work for its »excellent ideas for banishing pointless belief in witches, spells, spirits, diviners, etc.«39 His library - as well as that of the Osunas - included the infa- mous Malleus maleficarum (Hammer of the witches, i486), which states that »many ima- ginary appearances happen in many people [suf- fering] from a disease caused by an excess of black bile [ex morbo melando olico'«^° Goya's visual amalgamation of the melanchol- ic's intertwined fingers and his dysfunctional imagination is not unique, as three images com- parable to The Spell can show. The first is a Brit- ish satirical print by George Murgatroyd Wood- ward, John Bull Troubled with the Blue Devils (fig. 4). This print complements Reva Wolf's study on Goya's influence from contemporary British satirical prints, notably in the visual vo- cabulary of body rhetoric.41 Woodward's print is Magic in Enlightenment Europe , ed.

London, British Museum dated 1799, a year after Goya finished the witch- craft series; yet it is instructive as an example of the pictorial semiotics of delusion employed in the last decade of the eighteenth century. The eponymous figure, the stereotypical British man, is »troubled with the blue devils&lt;, a syno- nym for melancholy, and consequently imagines devilish creatures that represent a variety of taxes to which he is subject. His intertwined fin- gers signify melancholy, the cause of his halluci- nations.42 The second related image is an engraved copy of a design by the Netherlandish artist Jacques de Gheyn II, The Preparation for the Witches' Sabbath , c. 1610 (fig. 5). Despite its early date the print is significant, for the delusionary melan- cholic already features here in a scene of witch- craft. Goya might even have been familiar with de Gheyn's print, just as he knew and drew on engravings of David Teniers the Younger's witchcraft paintings.43 Claudia Swan, contextual- izirig this image with contemporary texts on demonology and theories about the delusions of melancholic witches, deduces that although de Gheyn's witches could have been gauged as fan- tastical, devoid of an accompanying text the image remains »entirely open to a variety of readings.«44 A hitherto overlooked feature corroborates her inclination that the scene is fiction. The engraving focuses on a trio of witches who dexterously per- form magic. Noticeably, one of them differs from her colleagues (fig. 6). While the seated witch concocts a magic potion in a bowl and the bent over witch in the middle performs magic with a wand in her hand and a book at her feet, the witch on the left observes them passively. That she is respectably clothed further sets her apart from her naked colleagues. In fact, her small step forward suggests that she has just arrived, perhaps from the distant village. By looking at her and pointing back at the village, the second 42 Fiona Haslam, From Hogarth to Rowlandson: Medi- cine in Art in Eighteenth-Century Britain , Liverpool 1996, 166, recognizes John Bulls melancholic condi- tion but ignores his hand gesture. In another print by Woodward, The Monkish Vision of 1797 (illustrated in Terry Castle, The Female Thermometer: Eight- eenth-Century Culture and the Invention of the Un- canny , New York/Oxford 1995, 176), the piousness of a contented, plump monk, sitting with sprawled legs, begets a reverie of his base desires. An ethereal apparition of forbidden wine and alluring women emerges behind his back. While his intertwined- fingers gesture in all likelihood signals meditative praying rather than melancholy, the combination of that gesture and a visible manifestation of delirium might have stirred Goya to pursue this connection. 43 Jane P.

London, British Museum witch seems to be referencing the origins of this third witch. The latter's body rhetoric provides a reason for her alienation: her intertwined fingers denote that she is afflicted by the disease of melancholy. Her joining a witches' sect in a fan- ciful setting seems, therefore, to occur only in her hallucinations.45 The third image comparable to The Spell is a work by Goya himself, designed around the same time he was occupied with the witchcraft series. It has already been acknowledged that some constituent parts of the Caprichos aquatint etchings are encountered in the witchcraft series, and their reception overlapped as well.

In particular The Spell , besides some motifs readily traced to the Caprichos plates,47 is conceptually linked to the famous forty-third plate, entitled The Sleep of Reason Produces Monsters ( El sueño de la razón produce monstruos ) (fig. 7).

The Spell condenses the dreamer and the dreamed witches into one scene. But it is to the preparatory drawing for Goya's Sleep of Reason , designed in 1797 and originally cast as the first plate of the Sueños (Dreams) series (fig. 8), that The Spell is more intimately connected.

See also Wilson-Bareau/ Marqués (as note 1), 213-14. Interestingly, the witch- craft series might have been referred as &gt;seis caprichos raros&lt;, six strange caprices, in their exhibition at the Academy of San Fernando in 1799: Gassier/Wilson (as note 1), 164. 44 Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 75.

Miscellaneous images are project- ed into the open space around his head - gro- tesque faces, two self-portraits, two donkeys and a dog. The ray-like strokes emanating from his head create an expressive screen for the imagina- tive content. Though such a screen is absent from The Spell (a significant omission to be discussed later), the two scenes are nevertheless compar- able on several levels. The spatial relation be- tween the cowering victim and the group of witches is similar to that between the sleeping artist and the stream of fantasy. Both protagonists are bent over in despair, with intertwined fingers. They occupy the foreground, their backs turned to the grotesque delirium of the pictures middle ground, while wheeling nocturnal fowl create a daunting backdrop. True, the anticipated audi- ence of the witchcraft series, unacquainted with this preparatory drawing, would not have been able to make this comparison. But the composi- tional analogies speak clearly to the possibility that Goya initially conceived The Spell as a dreamlike tableau in which the witches are a fig- ment of the melancholic's imagination.49 Vision and Delusion In addition to the protagonist's melancholy gesture, the potential reading of The Spell as a double-levelled reality is evoked by its associa- tion with the imagery of visionary experience. The victim s stance, in particular, employs con- ventions from the repository of visionary imag- ery associated with saints.50 Compare him, for instance, to the apostle at the lower right of El 9.

In his letter of 1792 to his friend Martin Zapater, Goya grumbles about his fears of ghosts and witches summoned by his bad humor and admits that only the cure his aunt Loren- za taught him, to &gt;put my hand below my navel&lt;, had ceased his irrational thoughts altogether (quoted in Victor I. Stoichita and Anna Maria Coderch, Goya: The Last Carnival , London 1999, 182-83). This assumption recalls the observation in André Malraux, Saturn: An Essay on Goya , London 1957, 123, that Goya »does not so much pity the victims as feel that he is one of them.« On some preparatory drawings of the Caprichos Goya inscribed »sueño de brujas,« ambiguously referring to either the witches' dream or the artists dream of witches. From this view The Spell becomes a self-reflexive painting, conversing on the artistic process of painting witches out of imagi- nation. 50 Victor I.

The intertwined-fingers gesture (not assum- ed by El Greco's saint) is a devotional sign com- mon in visionary pictures. Its connotation in The Spell with religious rituals is reinforced by the perversion of two other Christian gestures: the bending hag's outstretched arms in the guise of blessing or healing and the &gt;benediction&lt; of the witch on the left. Goya transformed theophany into demonic illusion in other works of that time, notably in his Caprichos. In plate 52, What a tailor can do! {¡Lo que puede un sastre!) (fig. 10), Goya par- odied the familiar composition of visionary pic- tures, applied, for instance, in his Appearance of the Virgin of the Pillar to Saint James the Greats1 A woman with clasped hands assumes a wor- shipful pose in front of a scarecrow made from a monk's habit and a truncated tree. Although she is looking at the arboreal monk with open eyes, her pose indicates that her sight is defective. The commentary on the plate in the Prado manuscript clarifies the situation: »How often a ridiculous creature is transformed suddenly into a ghost that is nothing and looks like a lot. That is what the skill of a tailor can do and the stupidity of those who judge things by their appearances.«52 The devotee and the vision of the arboreal monk in the Capricho plate parallel the hallucinating vic- tim and the witches in The Spell.

In The Sleep of Reason and The Spell , as well as in Woodwards Monkish Vision (see note 42), the imaginative content is situated behind the back of the dreamers head. This configuration endures a theory explained by the Oxford philosopher Robert Fludd in his Utriusque Cosmi [...] historia (The history of this world and the other) of 1617-19. He marks the faculty of imagination in the forehead, the spot of its alleged location, by the &gt;Oculus Imaginationis&lt;. This inner eye of the imagination engenders diverse images and radiates them to the space beyond the back of the head. See Marina Warner, The Structure of the Imagi- nation, in: Structure: In Science and Art , ed. Wendy Pulían and Harshad Bhadeshia, Cambridge 2000, 165-70. 54 This perversion of Christianity is apparent in two other paintings of Goya's series.

Band/ 2012</page><page sequence="15">verted sight echoes the assertion on apparitions of an eighteenth-century French writer, that mel- ancholies have »eyes without sight [...] they see everything except what is in front of them.«53 Unlike What a tailor can do /, however, the perversion of visionary experience in The Spell not only parodies religious seeing but also underpins the understanding of witchcraft as a heresy built on perverse, inverted versions of Catholic rituals.54 From this perspective emerges another pathological category of the victim's con- dition called »religious melancholy«. Developed in Burton's Anatomy of Melancholy and perpe- tuated with some modifications throughout the eighteenth century, »religious melancholy« was a mental derangement that engendered unusual religious preoccupations or »superstitions« - the term for deviant religious views of false pro- phecy and illusions.55 The protagonist in The Spell is a religious melancholic in a twofold sense: his credulous belief in witchcraft and his false illusions. Blurred Boundaries Despite the cues of a double-levelled reality in The Spell - the melancholic gesture, the confla- tion with visionary imagery and the nightshirt - the spatial division between the corporeal and the fantastic remains incoherent, for there is no clear demarcation between the two realms. Wood- ward, for instance, enclosed the devils imagined by John Bull within a cloud, a conventional way of differentiating dreams, visions and other indi- rect representations from the reality occupied by the visionary individual.56 The omission of any means of differentiation in The Spell , by contrast, brings the invisible witches fully into a visible reality. Their human appearance and proportions (so distinct from Woodward's fantastic imps), and their solid stance on the ground behind their victim, reinforce their physical presence in the space. Fred Licht noticed this deficiency in Goya's Colossus (c. 1812-16; Prado) and con- cluded, »Goya himself seems to be helpless in the face of his visions, for he cannot convey them to us intelligibly or by means of conventional com- positional schemes.«57 To claim that Goya was incapable of merging fact and fiction coherently in one picture is inherently misguiding. Goya, in fact, was fully able to separate the imaginary from the real. We have already seen how, in the first version of The Sleep of Reason (fig. 8), he adeptly drew rays emanating from the sleeper's head, on which he projected the imaginary content. In his Appear- ance of the Virgin of the Pillar to Saint James the Great he utilized the long-established picto- rial convention of the cloud to differentiate hea- venly phenomena and physical reality. And in The Devil's Lamp (fig. 11) Goya, conceivably inspired by the novel technique of phantasma- goria, highlighted the illusionary nature of the horses by painting them as blurred and glowing on a dark background.58 Despite his acquain- tance with a variety of methods to convey visions, Goya refrained from employing one in The Spell. op's mitra , a clear debasement of the church authori- ties. The entire spectacle was compared to the Resur- rection of Christ; Robert Hughes, Goya , New York 2003, 155. According to Heckes, &gt;Goya&lt; (as note 16), 200, the central composition of the Witches * Sabbath resembles Rembrandt's Christ Healing the Sick (»The Hundred Gilder Print«).

The yellow-clad witch is unified with him by one source of light (their bright clothes accen- tuate their union), which separates the two from the other witches, who wear black and stand in the dark. The light that unifies the two dilutes their existing on two different levels of reality. The yellow-clad witch seems to break from the dim world of fantasy and invade the real world, or at least the mind of the cowering victim. The same effect is achieved in The Sleep of Reason (fig. 7). An enormous owl with extended wings (comparable to the witch's outstretched arms) menacingly approaches the sleeper and is merged with him by means of the glaring light, while the rest of the fowl are cast into shadow. The lack of division between physical reality and fantasy in The Spell is significant. Oblivious to the fact that he is hallucinating, the melanchol- ic perceives the ghoulish host of witches as real; hence, by blurring the boundaries between the two, Goya effectively conveys the actual experi- ence of the delusional. The difficulty melanchol- ies have in distinguishing illusion from reality was elucidated in contemporary demonological discourse. The scholar Pierre Bayle, responding in Réponse aux questions d'un provincial (An- swer to the questions of a provincial, 1703) to the pan-European phenomenon of witchcraft, im- plores the reader »not to accuse of fraud those who protest that phantoms have appeared to them,« because they cannot distinguish between imagination and true sight, as happens to the dreamer during sleep or to the insane: »The im- agination [...] will be stronger than sight, and will paint its objects as if they were present, in such a way that although a person may be awake he will believe that one sees a thing which is not present to the eyes, but only to the internal sen- ses. Consider a bit what happens in our dreams. The most reasonable heads become extravagant while sleeping, and create chimeras more bizarre than those of the madmen whom one shuts up in the asylums. [...] The same thing will happen in much the same way to those who are not asleep, if by the effect of some fear, or of some great internal emotion, the acts of the imagination have more force than those of sight, hearing, etc.«6° The confusion between hallucination and dream also reverberates in medical texts, which explain that the »[melancholic's] sleeps and his wakings are so much the same, that he knows not how to distinguish them, and many times when he dreams, he believes he is broad awake and sees visions.«61 Echoing this ambivalence, the victim's delusionary experience in The Spell is at one and the same time a nightmarish dream (reinforced by the nocturnal setting and his nightshirt) and a melancholic delirium (indicated by his intertwin- ed fingers and staring wakefulness). Goya's strategy consists in defeating the expectation that there should be a visual device to help us recognize the divide. He does not wreathe his phantasmagorical figures in clouds or vaporous mists; he employs no flashing lights, no shifts in scale. The victim's psychic disturb- ance - projected whole and undivided into the theatrical space of the picture, as a spectacle for our consideration - seems to constitute the image. The absence of a mediating sign such as a cloud to differentiate between the two realms reinforces the victim's inability to distinguish between the observed and the imaginary. This impediment reduces the immediate intelligibility of The Spell , but it also invites the beholder to experience the protagonist's confusion. We are forced to ask ourselves: Are the witches material 59 Barbara Maria Stafford, From »Brilliant Ideas« to »Fitful Thoughts«: Conjecturing the Unseen in Late Eighteenth-Century Art, in: Zeitschrift für Kunstge- schichte XLVIII, 1985, 329-63 (quotation from 354). 4 8 Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte 7 5 .

A semiotic role similar to this inscribed »footnote« is assumed by the cowering victim in The Spell.

Reliance on the body's signs in diagnosing psychopathologi- cal behavior began at the turn of the century, when the French psychiatrist Philippe Pinel codified, in Traité médico-philosophique sur l'a- liénation mentale , ou la manie (Medico-philo- sophical treatise on mental alienation or mania, Paris 1801), a set of physiognomic and corporeal characters as a means of diagnosing mental ill- ness.63 The Viennese psychiatrist Max Leidesdorf embraced this method in his Lehrbuch der psy- chischen Krankheiten (Textbook of psychiatric illnesses, Erlangen 1865). This treatise includes five engraved portraits based on photographs of insane inmates in the asylum at Hall.64 One of them, identified in a short passage as a 3 8 -year- old German who became insane after losing his child, is shown with intertwined fingers (fig. 12). The accompanying title dispels any ambiguity re- garding the meaning of his gesture: »Melancholy with fearful delusions« (Melancholie mit angst- vollen Wahnvorstellungen). While the inter- twined fingers codify the inmate's melancholy, his »fearful delusions« are signified by his oblique gaze. He is distracted from the reality in front of him and fixated on an imaginary world that re- sides in a space beyond representation. Leides- dorf's inmate confirms the meaning of the gesture and gaze of Goya's victim, yet the use of body language in the two tableaux is essentially dif- ferent. In The Spell the body rhetoric reflects an artist's rendering of the conventional signs of the melancholic; the engraved photo purports to record the actual, impulsive behavior of a person afflicted with mental illness. 63 Sander L.
