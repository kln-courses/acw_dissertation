<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON THE LOGICAL POSITIVISM OF THE VIENNESE CIRCLE A IERICAN attention has already, upon several occasions, been LX. directed by adequate expositions to the new positivist move- ment centering in Vienna and Berlin. In offering the following peripheral comments, my purpose is rather to mention some minor additional aspects, and then in re-surveying the fundamental points from an American's parting perspective after a short period of study at Vienna, to present another more critical point of view. A union of the Viennese positivist tradition rooted in Ernst Mach, Boltzmann, and Brentano, with the new mathematical logic that has developed through Frege, Peano, Russell, Whitehead, and Wittgenstein, occurs in the recent writings of the members of the</page><page sequence="2">122 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Viennese Circle. Among the more prominent names to be mentioned are those of lMloritz Schlick, Rudolf Carnap, Hans Hahn, Friedrich Waismann, Otto Neurath, and Hans Reichenbach of Berlin. Al- though essentially the same as in expressed viewpoints of the indi- vidual members, the philosophy of the "Wiener Kreis" is unique in that it was formulated for the first time in a concise joint mani- festo 1 (containing a complete bibliography) published by the Mach Society in Vienna to signalize Professor Schlick's return from Cali- fornia. It is from this fundamental comprehensive source that I shall generally draw my material for analysis. Perhaps the most outstanding feature of the new movement is the rehabilitation of the positivist repudiation of metaphysics by adopt- ing the Logicist position of Russell and Wittgenstein. The total viewpoint thus develops into a fundamental rejection of all Ration- alism as well as all metaphysics, of reason as an instrument for obtaining real "content." It is based on a conception of mathe- matics, logic, and of all rational processes as purely tautological, as processes merely of rearrangement of empirical content. The role of logic is seen as never inductive, since knowledge is only gained empirically. The conclusion of a syllogism expresses only what is already contained in the premises or less. For example, the knowl- edge that Cassius is mortal is no more than re-expression of the actual knowledge (or less) that all men are mortal, and that Cassius is a man. Further, "There is onlly empirical knowledge which rests upon the directly given. With this the boundaries for the content of legitimate science are drawn. " 2 A thing is real in so far as it orders itself into the total structure of our experience, and a statement is worth only what is yielded in its verification. This same total viewpoint has been elsewhere3- formulated as stating that in accordance with the Wittgenstein view of language as pure structure, the propositions of empirical science are held to express only the formal structure and not the content of experience. Knowledge is thus defined as the communication of structure by means of symbols (language). It merely "expresses the form and points to the content." The point which I wish to make here in criticism is that knowl- edge is precisely form which is content. The foregoing logicist attitude would be significant only if there were no structure in ex- perience itself, that is, no real relationships, which are expressed in 1 Wissenschaftliche Weltauffassung der Wiener Kreis.

If subjective structure creations parallel and express objective structure then they are actually 'content" and are really inductive. Furthermore, if such purely structural creations are seen as not simultaneously real, the definition of knowledge as the communica- tion of structure leaves a theoretical distinction between the real and the known. Such a definite distinction is in itself not only pure metaphysics, but is an acceptance of sophism not admissible in philosophy seeking cognition. Thus the definition of language and knowledge as pure structure is either unimportant or inadmissible. Despite all minimizing, logical and mathematical operations do create new relationship forms (conclusions) based on the known, directly empirical nature of their component entities or facts. As we shall see, the value of these relationship forms can not fairly be underestimated. We can not thus say that by dealing with and creating "structure" we can not obtain "content" unless we can show that one is not the other, and tnat one is of inferior value. Dis- crediting the actual function of mind in this way along with his- torical rationalism is hardly feasible. In general, this logical-positivist effort to bifurcate cognition into two discrete factors-the formal or rational and the empirical, seems to me to embody a thoroughly erroneous view of their actual im- manence in experience itself. I can not understand the meaning of "form" as opposed to "content," or why "form" itself is not "content." (Especially since the Viennese themselves repudiate the concept of Substance.) To attempt in addition a comparative evaluation of these artificially divorced factors (reason and expe- rience) is futile, since form is an essential product of both. For the function of mind within immediate experience itself is actually so integral that to eliminate it would leave us not with content but with chaos. If we discard the mentally formed aspects, we should have experience without relationships or uniformities or coherence. Empirical relationships do not occur between objects and experience, but between objects in experience and in memory. For example, in order to determine whether one apple is a deeper red than another, whether two lines are parallel, whether a velocity has increased, we compare two observations, one previously experienced and still in memory, with a second one being made at the time of judgment. Furthermore, the relationships themselves (causation, etc.), as distinguished from the related object, are results of purely mental pereeption. If we eliminate the creation of mental patterns of relationship within the actual process of experience itself, only chaotic sense impressions are left. It is only through these mental</page><page sequence="4">124 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY form creations, which are at the same time true as objective relation- ships, that we can penetrate and surmount the atomistic incidents of experience to discover the greater functional relationships and pat- terns of operation-the truer "content." Without these, we lack the most primary requisites of science, such as knowledge of direc- tion or of similarity or of dissimilarity. Because they are mental functions in experience itself, it is natural that relations are dealt with by the formal sciences (logic and mathematics), but in so far as they deal in empirically valid terms, they create real relationships which are no more "tautological" or less valuable than the rela- tionships obtained in immediate mental-physical experience. To me this whole situation of mathematical logic repudiating rationalism, and finally defining knowledge as "form" divorced from "content," embodies a rather strange paradox. For it is only since the development of the "new " logic by mathematicians that logic has come to embody purely abstract operations and to forsake its original nature as essentially linked&amp;with experience. As I under- stand it, logic has hitherto been an axiomatic science which worked with basic abstracted generalizations from experience. For example, the law of the excluded middle, as well as other basic Aristotelian axioms, are merely general expressions of simple empirical truths. Logic was a kind of simplification, but no more, of the empirical resolution of problems, in which general empirical truths were taken for granted and used as abstract axioms instead of being verified each time. That is, logical forms were essentially empirical forms. Mathematics, on the other hand, departed much sooner from consciously empirical territory and has become more a science of independently abstract entities. Especially in the last century, with the opening of the realm of "transfinite " numbers by George Cantor, and the influence of Russell, a movement culminating in Hilberti' metamathematics and in metalogic has carried mathematical thought into the dizziest regions of pure abstraction. With the effort of the logicist school, led by Whitehead and Russell, to translate and fuse mathematical theory with logic, much of this actually pure-form creation as a characteristic of mathematics has come to be asso- ciated with logic as well, and to tinge the concept of all rational activity. With this tendency developing from their midst, it is indeed easy to see how the logical-positivists came to stress the emptiness of tortuous, objectively meaningless rationalism. Nevertheless, the posi- tion that they have adopted seems to be unsoundly extreme--i.e., to repudiate all mental form-creations as "empty re-arrangements," to distinguish between "form" and "content." As we have seen, the legitimate relationship patterns created by mind are equally</page><page sequence="5">LOGICAL POSITIVISM OF THE VIENNESE CIRCLE 125 valuable with experience in so far as they equal the patterns which mind obtains in experiencing. The point is only that for "content" we must confine logical operations to reality, and as we deal in real characteristics, obtain real relationships. Other efforts, from the Viennese standpoint, to elevate simple "pure" experience above philosophic questions and before the men- tal element, also fail under analysis. For example, an object is con- sidered real simply when it "orders itself " into the total structure of our experience. In the first place, it is a question not of "ordering itself," but of a mental classification according to mental class (relationship) patterns. Thus, for example, we distinguish between normal expe- rience and dream experience by setting all the eccentricities of the latter aside in a separate class of our experience. This so-called " setting aside" of irregularities in empirical concepts is scientifically not admissible however, unless based on a rejection or re-valuation of the discordant experiences themselves-as e.g., a rejection of dream experience as "not real." (For otherwise they would have to be treated as necessary modifications or alterations of our idea of certain facts of experience.) In other words, the question of the reality of new experience here precedes, rather than follows, its orderability into the total structure of our experience. If science had actually accepted things as real solely on their orderability in previous knowledge, new and isolated empirical com- plications or contradictions of accepted belief would never have been admitted to cause progress beyond the most naively simple theory. What this viewpoint does not take into account, is the fact that evaluation of an experience as real requires some judgment upon the mode or circumstances of the experience itself. We have seen that this must precede orderability in dealing with dream experience; such is the fact within scientific experience as well. All acceptance of new and complicating experimental data is based on evaluating the mode of experience (the whole method of experimental observa- tion) as a criterion of reality overbalancing the disorder which the given fact constitutes in our total experience. The incidental verbal- istic argument that we can order dream experience (or other ex- perience) aside without any judgment as to its reality, contradicts the more expressive fact and meaning of excluding such expe- riences as determinants of our activity directed toward reality. Thus in this sense, again, simple positivist acceptance of sense ex- perience as beyond philosophic question, must give way to critical subjective criteria more important than the mere fact of given sense-experience itself. The strayings of historical metaphysics are traceable to their</page><page sequence="6">126 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY unanalyzed and erroneous ideas of basic terms and natural phenom- ena (especially, for example, of Causation) rather than the validity of rational forms as real relationships given correct component con- cepts. As in the case of transcendental mathematics, divorce of rational relationships from reality occurs only in accordance with a divorce from real component terms. We have seen that mentally obtained relationships are not only fully as significant as sense data, but are an essential immanent part of immediate experience, and thus a comparative evaluation is impossible. A second general portion of the Viennese viewpoint is the more purely logical aspect as combined with the foregoing positivist standpoint. All metaphysics is repudiated as legitimate science and is relegated to the more innocuous realms of expression-as "art." Thus, to practise philosophy is solely to clarify the laws and con- cepts of science by logical analysis. The instrument for this is the "new" logic, that is, Russellian logic as opposed to Aristotelian-scholastic. In its dependence on grammatical syntax, which may vary from logical syntax, and in its lack of precision, Aristotelian logic is seen as totally inadequate. On the other hand, with the new symbolic mode of expression, with newly developed relational logic, and with the theory of variable functions which enables an escape from the purely predicative nature of the old logic, the new mathematical logic since Frege gives the hitherto lacking sharpness of deductive processes. In Russell 's Theory of Types is seen the conquest of the problem of antinomies. Mathematics is viewed as a branch of logic and both as mutually translatable and as purely tautological. From this general basic attitude, the practical activities of the Viennese Circle, led chiefly by Professor Carnap, have been con- centrated in logic on the construction of the "Constitution System" of concepts. This is a structural system of all concepts intended to serve as the criterion of legitimacy in philosophic argumentation. In it, every scientific concept must find its fundamental position in accordance with its deduction from other concepts, and finally, from the empirically given. The best idea of the general nature of this system which is being evolved, is perhaps given in Carnap's Der logische Aufbau der Welt (Benary, Berlin, 1928). Wre have already discussed the meaning of the tautological view of logic and mathematics. As to the further standpoint, while in thorough agreement as to the merits of symbolic logic, I feel that it should be remembered that many statements are still highly con- troversial within mathematical logic itself. The effort of the logicist school to translate mathematics wholly into logic has not yet been</page><page sequence="7">LOGICAL POSITIVISM OF THE VIENNESE CIRCLE 127 carried through with complete success, and the problem left by Rus- sell's own sacrifice of his Principle of Reducibility after Wittgen- stein's critique, leaves a certain incompleteness and inadequacy in the Theory of Types. The theory of a logical system in which all legitimate concepts must find their place in their plane of derivation from the given, sets up a not untenable means of judging concepts by their derivation. It is argued that this synthetic logic is the real groundwork under- lying all modes of logical expression, as it is, for example, common to all languages, and thus is in itself, the only one known or possible. lIt seems to me, nevertheless, that the question of whether several systematic versions of the same logical truths might not be built up from different starting points, ought not to be so easily dismissed. Furthermore, the reason for the constancy of the logic under- lying the various languages, is the universal constancy in the nature of the simple experience expressed by these varying symbols. Words in every language express in different symbols the same experiences, which represent static constant functions. That is, "Light," in English represents the same simply experienced phenomenon and functional relationships that "Licht" represents in German, and "lumiTere" in French. Thus, for naive experience, logical relations, which represent perceived real relations, are universally constant. The point here is that, as this constancy of relations and functions gives way to probability in scientific experience (quantum physics), an extremely rigid logical constancy becomes less adapted to deal with and represent physical reality. The idea of constant functions or a single closed system of axioms in logic, depends on the existence of these same characteristics in all experience, which is thrown into scientific doubt by the indeterminacy of quantum physics. We deal in physics apparently not (as a hypothetical example) with constant "light," but with something that may or may not preserve its char- acteristics, in other words, with varying functions. The point here is specifically that this fact mak-es necessary not merely logical con- cepts which are variables, but also variable systems of axioms. Thus such a single closed criterion system of "all scientific concepts'" (even if at all possible) would meet with much difficulty and con- troversy in application to descriptions of all spheres of reality- so much as to blur decidedly its dogmatic value as a simple final criterion. I wish here in no way to minimize the superb achievements of relational and symbolic logic, and I see the Viennese desire to utilize them as most praiseworthy. It is only their exclusive emphasis upon this single dogmatic criterion that inclines me to mention the above indications that mathematical logic is in itself not yet a</page><page sequence="8">128 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY magic panacea. Limited as we are by the meagerness of our per- ceptive weapons, it seems an unnecessarily over-confident move to impoverish them still further by wholesale repudiations and by lim- itation to a single system of "all scientific concepts." The formulae of logic itself serve only in many instances to present a question for judgment by sheer, unmechanized, "totality" perception, as in the reductio ad absurdum. In the still not completely mastered realm of antinomies we can remember Zeno in the very recent past as a proof of the real value of extra-logical judgments, despite all the apparent efficacy of formal criteria. For such reasons, those who do not subscribe completely to the Viennese views will in practice retain other criteria of the legitimacy of concepts (as perhaps the Viennese themselves do). But in any case, the recognizedly fertile field for operation in this direction makes the logical-positivism activity one of undoubted value. In addition to their work on the Constitution System, the mem- bers of the Viennese Circle have adopted a positive programme of activity within the special fields. For brief example, in geometry, work is on axiomatics and the further separation of physical and mathematical geometry along the general lines begun by Poineare, Duhem, and Helmholtz. In physics work is on hypotheses and the elimination of outmoded anthropomorphic concepts (such as that of Substance, which is seen as supplanted by modern field and atomic theories); and on the translation of Causation's "necessary connec- tion" character into the empirically comprehensible idea of a con- ditional relationship. In biology such theories as Vitalism and Driesch's Entelechies are repudiated as not reducible to the em- pirically given. In the social sciences an attitude rooted generally in IHume, Comte, Bentham, Marx, and Spencer, is maintained, in general opposed to all metaphysical and mystical theories of social development. This intimate and positive relationship to the special sciences is a result of one of the fundamental aspects of the logical-positivism movement, the one which seeks to break down the isolation of the various fields of scientific research. Their aim is to bring the result of research workers in the special fields together for the mutual benefits of comparison and stimulation, and to fuse the whole into a single coherent natural view. This activity is carried on thus far chiefly in Die Erkenutnis, formerly the philosophic review An- nalen der Philosophie, which is now edited by Professor Carnap, and Professor Reichenbach of Berlin. That this general effort of Viennese positivism is an extremely praiseworthy step in an obviously necessary direction for philosophy is an almost needless comment. In connection with this programme,</page><page sequence="9">BOOK REVIEWS 129 however, there are certain indications of a point of view to which exception may be taken. Contained in its hostility towards all meta- physics and its repudiation of metaphysical problems as meaning- less groupings of words (Scheinprobleme) is a tendency towards superficiality in scope. Repudiation of the content of classical meta- physics can not be construed as necessary repudiation of the role it sought to fill. Such "metaphysical" questions as contain (imply) legitimate critique upon experience as real cognition (e.g., as brought up by Poincare, and Einstein and Dingler in Germany) must be retained and dealt with, if philosophy is to retain its essen- tial nature as a quest for the truest and most objective physical orientation. There can be no philosophic disregard of an answer wherever there is possibility of real question, whatever its relation to an arbitrary or mechanical criterion of legitimacy. If I may attempt a final summary, the foregoing points at issue with "logical positivism" might be grouped under the following headings: (1) The fact that "structure" constitutes or is equivalent to "content" vitiates any significance of describing rational form creations as tautologies, in a limitative or depreciative sense. (2) Orderability of an experience into the total structure of previous experience is not what determines its reality. (3) The possibility or practical feasibility of a single, final criterion system of all scien- tific (legitimate) concepts is highly questionable. (4) Philosophy must retain all real questions, even the "metaphysical" effort to understand, evaluate, and orientate the process of immediate sense experience itself-despite all catchword general repudiations. In conclusion I wish to say that the foregoing critical survey of the new "logical positivism" is in no sense polemic, but is mnotivated especially by a desire to stimulate further discussion, thought, and progress in the same direction. Criticism has not been directed toward the generally admirable goals of the movement, but rather toward certain elements of intolerance and superficiality within it, based chiefly perhaps on a too optimistic evaluation of the present stage of symbolic logic and of naivete toward simple experience.
