<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LEVITICAL 'ABODA By JACOB MILGROM, University of California, Berkeley ? i. The Error. The substantive ;7rrir and its verb 7inv occur some 40 and 2o times, respectively, in connection with the duties of the Levites. Modern dictionaries and translations in- variably render them as "service" and "to serve." 1 This translation, I submit, is at best misleading and, where Le- vitic ;7rn5 is involved, totally wrong. The Levites of the Priestly source do not officiate at rites; they do not even assist in them. Moreover, the Tabernacle, the outer altar and their respective utensils are forbidden to them at pain of death (Num. xviii 3). Only when the Tabernacle is in transit may the sacred objects be handled by one Levitic clan, and then only after they have been covered by the priests (Num. iv x5ff.) . ? z. Definitions. P invests the Levites with the responsibility of innnw (guard duty) over the Tabernacle both in camp and on the march; 2 ri-mv introduces us to their second major responsibility: moving the Tabernacle.3 However, this term betrays other nuances which must be meticulously defined.

One can determine which meaning of rirzv the text has in mind by looking for a description of the job in each context. For example, if 1,r1= means the job of dismantling and reassembling the Tabernacle (definition 3a) it is because for the Levites in question only this aspect of Tabernacle removal involves their physical labor. ? 3. General Removal. That nrz57 means basically "physical labor" (definition I) requires no verification. We turn instead to the second usage of Levitic virm5, moving the Tabernacle. Our locus classicus is Num. viii 25 f: "At the age of 50 they shall be discharged irznzi xnsn (from the work force) X'i rn5 1=57 (and shall labor no more). They shall assist their brothers nhnw nnvb (in keeping guard over) the Tent of Meeting rT=7 i' 1=7'1 (but they shall perform no labor)." Here n-rZ cannot refer to the Levites' general duties for (Num. XVI 9). Ibn Ezra, alone among the exegetes, correctly identifies this function as the assistance rendered by the Levites to the Israelites in the preparation of their sacrifices. The layman must pass through a Levitic watchpost in bringing his sacrifice to "the entrance of the Tent of Meeting" (see Milgrom, Studies, ? I2). It then becomes the responsi- bility of the Levites to keep him under guard lest he encroach upon sancta (ibid., ?? 9-15, 49). It is only natural to expect that his Levitic "escort" will also provide him assistance with the non-cultic, prepara- tory acts, e.g., slaughtering, flaying, washing, which normally are performed by the layman (cf. Lev. I 5, 6, 9). This prescription to pro- vide aid to the worshipper, given in vague form and only here in the Pentateuch, becomes of major magnitude in undisputably post-exilic texts. It is clearly the peg upon which Ezekiel fastens his demand that the responsibility for ritual slaughter be transferred from laymen to Levites (Ezek. XLIV iI; cf. XLVI 24). According to the Chronicler, Levites were co-opted for flaying (2 Chr. XXIX 34; XXXV II) as well as slaughtering (2 Chr. XXX 17), but, as these cited verses indi- cate, only under emergency conditions.

That the starting age for 1n75t7 is set for 30 (other texts give 25 or 2o), 4 iS further indication that its conscription age corresponds to the span of man's maximum physical power. As the textual loci of fl"r57, adduced below, will demonstrate, there can be no doubt that ;miZ17 must refer to the job assigned the Levites to move the Tabernacle and its appurtenances during Israel's wanderings in the Wilderness.5 The Tabernacle's prefabricated, mobile parts must be dismantled, transported and reassembled from station to station. ? 4. The Cornponents. These three components of Taber- nacle removal are expressly stated in the first passage on the work of the Levites: "They shall transport (nzr') the Taber- nacle and all its furnishings ... the Levites shall take it down (1vr"n) . .. the Levites shall set it up (1vzvj)" (Num. I 50 f.). We now turn to Num. chs. 3 and 4 where the term v'rmv is introduced, and we notice that it stands for all or a portion of the Levites's removal tasks (definitions 2 and 3). That rnrm means removal is immediately apparent from its absence in the enumeration of the priests' duties: they have guard duty (imiVzh) but no i-rTtv (Num. III 38). Surely, this cannot mean that the priests perform no cultic acts!6 The only conclusion must be that M'7=r7, at least in this pericope, refers exclusively to the task of moving the Tabernacle. ? 5. Nun. ch. IV. Our major focus, however, is upon ch. 4 where the greatest clustering of v'r-v is found. Indeed, all three definitions are present, especially no. 3: ;17t57 as a subdivision of Tabernacle removal. Where ',rrz7 stands 4 See Num. IV 3, 23 et al.; Num. VIII 24 f.; i Chr.

All these passages are included in the composite of all the Levitic ;trm passages, (? I3) to which the reader is referred. However, a word on the linguistic structure is in order. The apposition of mnr-nr5v is expressed by three different idioms. It can take the simple form, e.g., lnt 757 Innrr 75 w"8 tr "according to his packing and porterage" (Num. IV 49 cf. vs. I9). The compound also appears: xv*1 -rzwx ... mzw net "These are the tasks of ... as to packing and porterage" (Num. IV 24, cf. vss. 27, 3I), where the first nrrmw is a general term for physical labor and the second, distinct from porterage, refers to specific work of dismantling and replacing the heavy curtains and planks. Lastly there is the most complex passage: -7rin 5Mta X= ninr=i ;rr ni7rV -72w5 RNn 5: (Num. IV 47). Once it is recognized that wr:57 (absolute) and Xwn7 are in complementary apposition, we have no difficulty in rendering the passage, as follows: "all who were summoned to do the packing work and porterage work for the Tent of Meeting." Why all this verbiage? Are we dealing with pleonastic inexactness or the contrary, technical precision ? The answer is clear as soon as it is recognized that this complementary apposition of Xwn - 6rmw occurs only in Gershonite and Merarite passages or in summaries which include them (Num. IV 94, 27, 3I, 47, 49). For the simple, uncontestable fact remains that these two clans have no porterage (Mn) duties at all. The planks and curtains assigned them are carried by ox-cart.7 Loading and unloading them is the extent of their removal toils so that the term ,n:57, in their case, is reserved exclusively to their labors to make and break camp. ? 6. Clain Distinctions. Two more passages help clinch the case.

IV 2I-27a), we read: "You shall make them responsible ni;tw',z (for guarding) all t3mon (their porterage)" (vs. 27b).8 The word ,vrzv which, as noted, proliferates throughout the chapter, is missing here and vinon;' stands in its place. No longer is it a puzzle: the furnishings, carried by carts, require no labor (T167=), only safeguarding (nnwon). 9 Moreover, the Merarite role in Taber- nacle transport is called nton nnnrn "the guarding of their porterage" (vss. 3I, 32). Once againn'rr ;vis missing. The reason is clear: no physical labor is involved.10 8 The LXX reads 21h.Wh= &gt; 2117=1 as in vs. 32 and is accepted by most modern commentators. The emendation is not only unnecessary but wrong. The obvious purpose of listing objects by name is for taking in- ventory. This would be essential for the numerous attachments of the Ta- bernacle planks and pillars e. g. sockets, pegs, bars, cords-all under Mera- rite charge (Num. IV 30 f.). The Gershonites, on the other hand, had only the Tabernacle curtains as their removal duty, few in number and largein size; their loss or misplacement would be inconceivable. Moreover, the text itself militates against the emendation. Just as theMerarites' objects are borne by cart and need only guarding during their transport, so the Gershonites' objects. Therefore, the expression St7 Zn;2VZ, given twice for the Merarites (IV 31, 32), is needed at least once for the Gershonites! 9 The concluding verse (vs. 28) is most likely wrongly punctuated by the Massorites. The ethnaltca should be moved to W1WV'7M1 giving a parallel structure to the Merarites (vs. 33). We should expect the task of removal as well as guard duty to be under Ithamar's jurisdiction for both clans. 10 Num. IV 32b translates, "You shall list by name the ob- jects of their porterage watch." M. HARAN, "The Priestly Image of the Tabernacle," HUCA (I965), 222 n. 72, deduces from his recon- struction of Tabernacle taboos that 27=7Z in Num. ch. III (vss. 25, 3I, 36) cannot refer to the Tabernacle at rest but only in transit. His reasoning is correct for it is now corroborated by the text itself: (i) Thrice we find in ch. III that 273W7 precedes the enumerated objects and is concluded by 1I7IV 7DN1 (for the use of 7, see n. I4). Since it has been shown that the latter refers to removal so must the former (see further ? 7). (2) True, in the description of the priests' responsib- ility (vs. 38), the camp is clearly at rest and not in motion. However, as noted, the word Vl78: itself is missing in vs. 38. Moreover, as Haran has argued (ibid.), the exclusive use of participles in vs. 38, e.g., 1'2f7 (comp. 12fln vsS. 23, 29), points to the ongoing priestly role in the camp and not just on the march. (3) Finally, in ch. IV where the tasks of the labor force are minutely defined, the same objects referred to in ch, III as f18V7=7Z are now expanded to R?Z3 nnrwr.</page><page sequence="6">LEVITICAL 'ABODA-MILGROM 137 The passages dealing with the Kohathites provide final confirmation for my contention. It seems to have been over- looked that vrr= for the Kohathites is precisely the opposite of the V*rmv of their brother clans. Whereas the Tabernacle's planks and curtains are transported on oxcarts, leaving the Gershonites and Merarites no porterage duties, the sacred objects-the specific charge of the Kohathites-rnust be carried by shoulder. And contrariwise, whereas the brother clans concentrate upon dismantling and reassembling, the Kohathites must have this work done for them by priests (Num. IV 4-I5).11 It is therefore to be expected that Kohathite 1112W rather than being the complement of Mt, should be- come its synonym. This is precisely what is found: their labor is their porterage. Let us note the following: In regard to the princes' gifts of draught carts and oxen, Moses is told: "Accept these from them V*r57 Mn 15 (to transport) 12 the Tent of Meeting and give them to the Levites according to their respective tasks.... But to the Kohathites he did not give any; since theirs was trnpn7 nrnn (the transport of the sacred objects), rMw (their porterage was by shoulder" (Num. VII 5, 9). 31rT7=, here, admits of no other meaning than "transport." The equation of vn*r = transport, for the Koha- thites is, moreover, expressly stated by the text. The Kohathite duties are framed by these words: "This is mnr (the transport obligation) of the Kohathites relating to the Tent of Meeting: ... These things are xVi7 (the porterage) of the Kohathites relating to the Tent of Meeting" (Num. IV 4, I5b). Clearly tnrm here is a synonym for wn. Furthermore, in the long section itemizing the labor of the Kohathites (Num. IV I-20), the sacred objects are never called their ninr, as is the case 11 "Aaron is 'most sacred' (2 Chr. XXIII I3) and the Ark is 'most sacred' and they do not harm each other. The Kohathites, however, are not 'most sacred' and are harmed by the Ark and all the interior objects which are 'most sacred' " (Num. R. I9). These distinctions are further analyzed by Haran, ibid. 12 That the oxen and carts perform M1217 is, of course, another proof that the term can only mean transport.</page><page sequence="7">I38 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW with the furnishings assigned the Gershonites and Merarites (cf. above), but only their xrz. So indeed should it be: the brother clans have only to guard their objects during trans- port but the Kohathites are charged with their porterage. Thus, the premise of all the Kohathite passages is consistently the same: their 8s73 is their VnIn. ? 7. The Censuses. Finally we turn to the census of Num. IV. That only physically qualified males are numbered is underscored by the sevenfold statement that the census was limited to age 30-50: thrice in the introductions (vss. 2, 23, 30), thrice in the sums (vss. 35, 39, 43) and once in the grand total (vs. 47). The last is our complex-structured. fnl-r clause, already discussed (? 5), on which one more observation is in order. For having grasped P's terminology of Levitic wrrv - labor, in general, and removal, in particular-we can penetrate to the intent of the verse and see that it could not have been expressed in any other way. It sums up the physical work assigned all the Levite clans as: rnrrz nrvw "removal work" (Gershonites and Merarites) and xz'7 nrrr "porterage work" (Kohathites). An unexpected boon resulting from our analysis of Levitic rrrv is new insight into the literary structure of the two cenisuses of Num. chs. III and IV.13 Having seen that ch. IV stresses fl8r5V, the physical labor assigned to the Levites, we can now account for the different formulation used in the first Levitic census, Num. III 14-39. The framework for each clan reads: nnlTs 5 I fl?n; (111 25 f., 3I, 36, cf. 38).14 13 Once and for all, the view that Num.IV is a doublet of Num. III 14-39 (e.g., G. von Rad, Die Priesterschrift im Hexateuch [BWANT, 65, I934] 89-93) must be abandoned. Indeed, once M12W, n1tWVZ and :lNp are properly translated, many hoary "cruxes" disappear, e.g., IV 5-i6 is no "Einschub," IV I7-20 is not a "Nachtrag" alluding to a Kohathite "Untergang," XVIII 3b does not contradict I 50, etc. (despite Gunneweg, Leviten und Priester (FRLA NT), I965, I5I, I80 f., I98 ff., and see K. M6hlenbrink, "Die levitischen tberlieferungen des Alten Testaments," ZAW [I934], 52, N.F. II: I84-23i, esp. 224 f., upon whose analysis of Num. IV Gunneweg relies). 14 The equation 7:l == 5:1 has yet to be demonstrated. My view is</page><page sequence="8">LEVITICAL cABODARMILGROM 139 Thus, priorities are switched: nninz is no longer the after- thought it was in ch. IV (Num. IV 27, 28, 3I, 15 32), but the main subject and the main word, outnumbering the occurren- ces of VT5V 7 to 3. The reason for the stress on nrmwn is that guard duty has no age qualification. All Levites counted must serve, not only the elderly (so explicitly, Num. VIII 25 f.) but in theory, even the very young, age one month and up.16 Indeed, it seems that from P's viewpoint, all but infants per- form some guard duty or are in training for it. In any event, since many more Levites are involved in guard duty (acc. to the census nearly two-thirds) than in actual labor, nnnz receives the main stress in the full Levitic census of Num. III. Moreover, of the two major Levitic roles, guarding and re- moval, there can be no doubt which is the more important: the labor force is activated only when the camp is on the move, but guard duty is a perpetual responsibility. Indeed, when the Levites are apportioned their share of the Midianite spoils, twice the text emphasizes that they are pwttrm ntizw ntw (Num. XXXI 30, 47). Thus, the Levites are rewarded specifi- cally for their service as Tabernacle guards. ? 8. Recapitulation. Levitic 7lraw has been found to mean the physical labor of Tabernacle removal. With guard duty (Vnwnv) it constitutes the main work assigned to the Levites by the Priestly source."7 The term imzv in Num. ch. IV can also refer to the specific labors designated to the Levite clans, that the lamed is clearly not a preposition but a conjunctive with emphatic force, best rendered by "including." Provisionally, see Joiuon's Grammaire de L'Hdbre' Biblique (I965), ? I25 I,I, 2. The possibility that the lamed is a pure emphatic particle should not be discounted, see P. Haupt, quoted by G-K-C, 143, e and n. 39. 15 Even here 2VWt1 is preceded by V7T:37 in the previous verse. See the Composite, ? I3, ad loc. 16 According to A. Ehrlich, Randglossen (on Exod. XXX I2), the vocabulary of the two censuses points to another distinction: IM1 is used in the counting of the able-bodied males (Exod. XXX 12; Num. I 2; IV I, 2I; XXVI i) but not in the census for the entire people (Num. III I5, 40). This leads him to render ?XZ7- as " der Kern." 17 See above n. 3 for a qualified third.</page><page sequence="9">I40 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW either as a complement to or a synonym of porterage (Nw?z). In the case of Gershonite and Merarite clans who have no porterage, their r,785 refers to their laborious task of dis- mantling and reassembling the Tabernacle complex. The Kohathites, on the other hand, are exempt from the latter, but are exclusively engaged in the transport of the sacred ob- jects by shoulder. The common denominator of all these usages is that ;rfl5 will refer to that aspect of the Levites' work which requires heavy labor. ? 9. Num. IV igb and the LXX. The inevitable "fly in the ointment" will not elude us here. Concerning the Kohathites we read: "assign them Imn bXl inrvr 7.." If, as we have claimed, the Kohathite labor consisted solely of porter- age then the mwn should suffice, and n67=7 would be super- fluous. The LXX, however, unambiguously translates one term for the two; it seems that Inrvr7 757 was not in the translator's Hebrew text. Moreover, it is simple to account for the gloss; the copyist's eye or memory fastened upon the chapter's concluding verse where the same formulation occurs (IV 49). Q.E.D. ? Not at all. As S. Daniel observes,18 the Septuagint renders tan here by vociapop&amp; a rare word, one never again used for 87:. We, therefore, have no right to conclude that the translators had before them a Hebrew text which omitted inzvr 5. The likelihood is that their Vorlage was the same as our Massoretic text, and what the LXX has bequeathed us is not translation but interpretation. The Alexandrians may have been as sensitive as we to the difficulties involved in assigning the Kohathites additional rrnv. Their solution was to regard the compound Inn 5w wnv bw as a hendiadys, the equivalent perhaps of Mt;' nlz57 (vs. 47) which we inter- preted earlier as the Kohathite share of the Tabernacle labors. Indeed since Kohathite ;rn6 is identical with xrn, the use of 18 Recherches sur le vocabulaire du culte dans le Septante (Paris I966), 76-87.</page><page sequence="10">LEVITICAL 'ABODA-MILGROM I4I hendiadys is semantically as well as grammatically possible,"9 and the Septuagint reading points the way.20 ? Io. Post-Conquest inzv, The instances of Levitic ;ir7=7 still awaiting discussion are Num. VIII ii, I5, I9, 22; XVI 9; XVIII 4, 6, 21, 23, 3I. In all these passages the specific Levitic tasks are no longer being identified and itemized as in chs. III and IV, and therefore rflti7 will invariably mean "physical labor" (definition i) or "removal" (definition 2), in general. Whatever comment need be made on individual verses in this group is reserved for The Composite, ? I3. Num. ch. XVIII, however, is singularly rich in new ideas and enig- mas and merits extended treatment. The first two verses (XVIII, 4,6) present no particular difficulty ;21 Num. XVIII 2I, 23, 3I do. Their problem is not primarily philological but historical. Involved is a new time setting. Here and here alone, P projects Levitic rr:57 into the future. Henceforth, in the post-conquest period, Levites will receive tithes in return for their rrnv. As to the make-up of their future mnv this text and, indeed, all of P is silent, and we are left to our own deductions. However, the newly won understanding of 19 fl717 can be a synonym for MM (see Num. III 3I; VII 9). 20 I would be remiss to neglect the importance of the Septuagint which, to my knowledge, is the only version that does not uniformly render T77:7 by "service" but resorts frequently to "work." The stems, respectively, are XsxZ'oq- and gpyov and are thoroughly investigated by S. Daniel, ibid. Interestingly enough, she concludes that the former stem is the general term whereas the latter refers to specific labors. However, other distinctions implied by the stems (e.g., loftiness versus menial, etc.) are not borne out by this study (e.g., n. 49 on Num. XVI 9). Nonetheless, the acknowledgment by the LXX that Levitic MI72Y has a primary meaning of physical labor is significant. Perhaps we should also not sell short the Targums, which invariably render jn1'103 ("cult") since the latter's etymology is the root "to work" just as Hebrew rI7r5I. 1l7 as "labor" is certainly attested, e.g., T. Ezek. XXXIX i8. Thus, the possibility exists that the Ara- maic translators were aware of T2fl7 as labor, but since 7Ml11 can mean "work" or "cult" we can never be sure. 21 If W17n27 and flVMt are both blithely translated as "Dienst" (see inter alia von Rad, Op. cit., I13-I6), Num. XVIII 1-7 turns out a mess. See our discussion, ? I3, nn. 50-54. T0</page><page sequence="11">142 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW the term M"7=17 comes to aid. The possible solutions are nar- rowed down to two. The first and most obvious is that with Israel's wanderings terminated, the need for a movable sanctuary has also ended. Only guard duty is left as the major Levitic office.22 Indeed, it is for their service in protecting the sanctuary against the incursions of the unauthorized that they are awarded dues of annual tithes.23 If this solution is 22 nV's is a function of XVIV, e.g., I 50b II I 53b; XVIII 2a I XVIII 3a; VIII 26. That the XVWn has guarding functions, see Exod. XXXIII i i (E): " lX't7nl, Joshua the son of Nun, ' 73, would not stir out of the tent." For the possibility that 'IM is a soldier in Ugaritic and Egypt- ian, see C. H. Gordon, UT, Glossary, no. i666. Whatever the original meaning of 3VnW (most likely "serve") its biblical contexts betray multiple meanings to cover multiple his- torically developed institutions. Thus priests "officiate" (in which case the direct object is rarely used) whereas Levites "guard" the Tabernacle and "assist" the laity and the priesthood (the direct ob- ject being always used). In any case, the usual translation "minister" (e.g., Eerdmans, "The Composition of Numbers," OTS [I949], 122 f.) distorts as it restricts the meaning. 23 I cannot accept Y. Kaufmann's thesis, Toledot ha-Emuna ha- Yisraelit, I (1938), 154-157 (Heb.) [abridg.-trans. by M. Greenberg, The Religion of Israel (I960), I90 f.], that the Levitic tithe of Numbers, in contrast to the tithe demanded by Deuteronomy, is voluntary: (i) the key verbs are 'l1Z'f3 (XVIII 21, 24, 26) and W1jpn1 (vsS. 26, 28). The Levites are not dependent upon the philantrophic whim of the land- owner, but they may seize that which has been assigned to them, i.e., I/I0 of each yearly crop. That 11l11fl means "take possession" is well attested (e.g., in P alone: for property, Lev. XXV 36, Num. III 47; XXXI 30; marriage, Lev. XX 14, 17, 21; XXI 13, I4). (2) The tithe is "given" in reward for work, VTU'57 (XVIII 21, 31). Just as the latter is perennial and unceasing, so must be the former. Moreover, the tithe is called '1Z7 (vs. 31), which in VT:157 contexts can only mean "wages" (e.g., Gen. XXX 28 f.; Deut. XV i8; Ezek. XXIX i8, etc.). (3) A logical consideration: Since no other emoluments but the tithes are assigned the Levites, on what does P expect them to live once the manna ceases ? (4) Even the priestly tithe of Lev. XXVII 30, I suspect, is yearly and compulsory and the text should translate "Every tenth of the land (yield)." Moreover, the cattle which "pass under the shep- herd's staff" (vs. 32) are not for purposes of tithe but for daily inventory when they exit from and return to their pens. Its rendering, therefore, should be: "Every tenth of the herd and the flock-of whatever passes under the shepherd's staff-shall be holy to the Lord." Thus, I submit, "for the tithes set aside by the Israelites as a contri- bution to the Lord" (Num. XVIII 24) clearly implies that originally,</page><page sequence="12">LEVITICAL 'ABODA-MILGROM I43 correct then mnv will have assumed a fourth meaning: it would now be restricted to guard duty, a synonym for nzntwn, a usage it did not have before. However, a second solution is possible: Levitic ;VTz! continues unchanged in the Promised Land. As is well known, P does not project beyond the conquest and immediate settle- ment. It says nothing about the replacement of the Taber- nacle by some permanent structure or about the selection of its permanent site. Rather than assume with the critics that P takes both structure and site for granted, let us follow the simpler reading of the the text that P does not regard the conquest as the terminus ad quem for the Tabernacle24 and by the same token, it assumes that the Tabernacle will con- tinue to function qua Tabernacle, as a portable, mobile shrine. Is there any evidence for this view in Scripture? The answer is strongly in the affirmative. ? ii. Samutel. The text of 2 Sam. VII 6 f. (= I Chr. XVII 5 f.),25 generally conceded as historically reliable, relates of contemporary opposition to the building of Jerusalem's Temple on the grounds that Israel's God had heretofore neither dwelt in a Temple nor requested one. Rather, "I continued to move the tithes accrued "to the Lord" i.e., the priests, in keeping with Lev. XXVII 30 ff., and as the priestly dues (fl?:1n) continue to do (see XVIII 8, 12, 19, 26, 28, 28, 29). Num. XVIII 21 ff., then, is a later develop- ment than Lev. XXVII 30 ff. Dues originally assigned to the priest- hood are now transferred to the Levites in compensation for their labors at the sanctuary. This transfer, however, only applies to the land tithe; the animal tithe is forgotten and it never crops up in legislation again. 24 Here I follow Haran, "Shilo and Jerusalem,"JBL (i962), 8i :14-24, but differ with his reading of 2 Sam. VII, as the discussion will show. 25 E.g., M. Noth in "David and Israel in 2 Sam. VII," The Laws in the Pentateuch and Other Studies (i966), 250-59 (trans. by Ap-Thomas; reprinted from Me'langes Bibliques rediges en l'honneur de Andr lRobert, 1957, 122-30) holds that 2 Sam. VII is a unity (except for a few later accretions) and is pre-Solomonic. M. Tsevat, "The Steadfast House: What Was David Promised in 2 Sam. VII:I3b-i6," HUCA (I963), 34: 7 1-82 generally agrees except for vss. I3b-I6, attributed to Soloinonic times.

All the time I moved about among the Israelites. . ."126 Not only does this text state unequivocally that before David the deity resided in a Tabernacle-type structure but that it functioned as one: it "moved about."27 26 " expresses forcibly the idea of continuance," S. R. Driver, Notes on the Hebrew Text of the Books of Samuel (2d ed., 1913), ad loc. I take IDVn.t '?XZ as a hediadys. According to P, the tent and taber- nacle are, respectively, the outer and inner cover of the sanctuary (Exod. XL i9); the Z is instrumental. '?lZ' 12 '?:: Chronicles reads "among Israel," but the Samuel text is preferable. 27 The hithpaclel of 1'?t means "to move about." With God as the subject, its clearest exemplar is in the Eden story: "The sound of the Lord God moving about (1'?,71nr) among the trees of the garden" (Gen. III 8 [J]). This notion of God's mobility is fundamental to the Deuteronomist, e.g., "Since the Lord your God moves about (J'1fl7MX) in your camp to protect you" (Deut. XXIII I5). The presence of God is not confined to the sanctuary. (It is only God's name which is "tabernacled" in the central sanctuary.) Nor it is attached to the Ark, for as the end of the above cited verse expressly states: "let your camp be holy; let Him not find anything unseemly among you and turn away from you." Thus, in D, the presence of God moves about the people, unbound by the sanctuary or its sancta. For P, however, God's presence is co-extensive with His Tabernacle; once He leaves it, it is destroyed. Actually P and D are not far apart; both aver that holiness within the Israelite society is the sine qua non for God's protecting presence. In my forthcoming study of impurities I aim to demonstrate that according to P's theology, sin/impurity within the community registers upon the sanctuary, and when a critical point is reached, God must leave. P's concept is the more anthropomorphic and pagan and is closer to the form of God's indwelling presupposed by Samuel VII 6 f.; "I continued to move about in a Tabernacle-Tent." Another instance of J''nW provides the closest analogue to Samuel: t:=11 ... 13=1nn "=Vn nnl31 (Lev. XXVI iif.). If, as in the rest of P, J5= is God's earthly abode, then it is the means by which God's presence is felt throughout the land. Indeed, since this verse is part of P(H)'s projection into post-conquest conditions, it may envisage a circuit-riding Tabernacle in the settled land. In any event, it should be clear that the image of the Tabernacle in Samuel corresponds in language and concept with Lev.XXVI and not with any other source, and is another indication that the opponents of the Jerusalem Temple, as reflected in 2 Samuel VII, based themselves on a Tabernacle-centered theology, precisely as we find in P. (I am grateful to M. Greenberg for pointing out that my interpretation of 171nt3 is supported by A. E. Speiser, "The Durative Hithpa'el: A tan-Form," JAOS [I955], 75:52-55 [= Oriental and Biblical Studies, ed. J. J. Finkel- stein and M. Greenberg, I967, 506-I4]).</page><page sequence="14">LEVITICAL cABODA-MILGROM I45 According to this ancient tradition, then, the Tabernacle was a viable, operative institution in the settled land.28 True, the testimony of X Sam. VII has been discredited by the flat contradiction of i Sam. I-III which speaks of a Temple at Shilo within which the Ark was enshrined. The contradiction, I submit, is more apparent than real. P's own history ends with the Tabernacle settled in Shilo at the end of Joshua's days (Josh. XVIII I). Moreover, there are traditions from other hands which place the Ark in Gilgal (Josh. III f.), Shechem (Josh. VIII 30 ff.), Bethel (Jud. XX 97 f.), Shilo (i Sam. I-III) and in Israel's war camp against the Philistines (i Sam. IV-VII) and the Ammonites (z Sam. XI II).29 That the Ark was sheltered in a tent and that, concomitantly, the tent contained other cultic paraphernalia are assumptions in keeping with extra-biblical evidence, particularly the qubba of pre-Islamic nomads, and I would agree wholeheartedly with de Vaux's conclusion "we ought not to separate the Ark and the Tent, ... the Priestly description of the desert sanctu- ary... did preserve an authentic tradition."30 If, then, the Ark was always enshrined in a Tabernacle- 28 This thesis find support in Ps. LXXVIII 28, "He let them (the birds) fall in the midst of His camp, all round His Tabernacle." (For the singular meaning of fl&gt;p3 see Ps. XLIII 3; LXXXIV 2; CXXXII 5, 7 [ I I:1j7]; Job XVIII 21 [ 11 j317]; XXXIX 6 [ I Iu]; Ug. texts [Gordon] I28:JII:I9; 2 Aqht: V: 32 f.; and see Grammar ? I3.I7). The psalmist it will be noted, uses P's concept of the Tabernacle in the center of the camp, and yet by all accounts this psalm is old!

See also the discussion of the Taber- nacle Psalms in V. W. Rabe, The Temple as Tabernacle (Harvard Univ. dissertation, i963), 2o-62, esp. on Ps.

McHugh (I96I), 302; idem, "Arche d'Al- liance et Tente de R6union," M6morial A. Gelin (I96I), 55-70. For the latest summary on the origin of the Ark, see H. Davies, "The Ark of the Covenant," ASTI (i966-67), 5:30-47. He concurs that the Ark goes back to the Wilderness sojourn, but deducing it from a reconstructed JE (Exod. XXXIII 5b-7) is highly questionable.</page><page sequence="15">I46 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Tent, it is easy to account for the existence of a tradition that full Levitic W57i, as known in the Wilderness, persisted in Canaan until the destruction of Shilo. This tradition would resolve the crux of Shilo for it would allow for the side by side coexistence of both Temple and Tabernacle, the latter re- served for war emergencies as well as for peacetime circuits among the people.3' It would account for David's housing the Ark in a tent when he brought it to Jerusalem, not that he could not find it an adequate house but that he was returning to the living Wilderness tradition, suspended only two gene- rations earlier with the destruction of Shilo.2 It would explain P's silence about the site of the Tabernacle and its replace- ment by a Temple, because P knew that the roving Taber- nacle was the authentic tradition until vitiated by Nathan's prophecy to David.33 31 It might throw light on the apparent "movable" center of Israel's early Federation: Gilgal, Shechem, Shilo, Bethel. Thus, Israel might gather at any hallowed spot and the Ark and its Tabernacle be brought there. Would this be the meaning of "in every place where I cause my name to be mentioned I will come to you and bless you" (Exod. XX 24b) ? 32 So F. M. Cross, "The Priestly Tabernacle." BA (I947), IO:45-68 (reprinted in The Biblical Archaeologist Reader, I, 2OI-28), followed by V. W. Rabe, op. cit. The major support for the alleged lateness of P's Tabernacle has been the assumption that the Tabernacle's orna- mentation and design were inspired by Solomon's Temple. (See most recently M. Haran, "Shilo and Jerusalem" JBL [i962], 8i :14-I7, 23 f.). Cross' hypothesis eliminates this prop. There is no reason to doubt that the Tabernacle was better constructed and more lavishly decorated than its desert predecessor. It is, furthermore, more logical to assume that P's Tabernacle was the very last structure by that name-the only one for which a blueprint may have survived. Indeed, the reverse case is more likely true, that Solomon's Temple was modelled after the Tabernacle. For further cogent arguments see J. H. Scott, The Pattern of the Tabernacle (Univ. of Penn. dissertation on microfilm, I1965). Also, note the startling resemblances of the dimensions of the Arad sanctuary and altar to their Tabernacle counter- parts; see Aharoni, "Arad: Its Inscriptions and Temple," BA, (I968), 25, and Milgrom, Studies, n. I66. 33 T. E. Fretheim's challenging article, "The Priestly Document: Anti-Temple ?" VT (July, I968), I8 :3I3-29 was noticed too late to be assimilated into the body of this study. He accepts the thesis of M,</page><page sequence="16">LEVITICAL 'ABODA-MILGROM I47 ? I2. Chronicles. Finally, is it not by this tradition that we can explain how the Chronicler interpreted the P source be- fore him? Twice he informs us that the porterage work of the Levites ceased only with the construction of Jerusalem's Noth, The History of Israel (i958), 9I, that the Ark had no permanent resting place but was "set up in one place for a more or less prolonged period of time and this place formed the central place of worship." Only whereas Noth ascribes the Ark's mobility to the fear lest it "should become the object of a local cult after the manner of the Cannanites" (ibid., 94), Fretheim sees the motivation, as I do, in P's ideological rejection of a fixed temple. I differ with Fretheim, however, in his chronological assumptions and, hence, in the conlcusions he derives from them. For example, since he presumes a post-586 date for the composition as well as editing of P, he is forced to scrounge for evidence of opposition to the building of the second Temple. His results are meager and uncompelling. Jeremiah can only be made over into an antagonist to the institution of the Temple, per se, by declaring spurious all contradictory verses in his book (e.g., III I7; XIV 2I; XVII I2; XXXIII i8-22). Moreover, that Jeremiah did not foresee the rebuilding of the Temple is no great conundrum. All his restoration prophecies are directed to the exiles of 72I and 597; none date after 586 (not even in chs. XXX-XXXI). Therefore, whenever Jeremiah speaks of ingathering, the Temple is still standing! As for Isa. LXVI i f., the opposition is not directed to the Tertple but to its devotees. (By Fretheim's logic, since sacrifice is condemned in vs. 3, are we to suppose that the prophet projected a non-sacrificial cult? And what of vs. 6, not to speak of vss. i8b, 20, 2I, 23 which predicate the Temple and its ritual ?) The objections to the Temple in both Jeremiah and Isaiah are nothing more than variations on a ubiquitous prophetic theme: rite without ethics is worthless. (E.g., see J. Muilenberg's discussion, Isaiah. Chs. 40-66 [Interpreter's Bible, i956], V, 758-60]. It is also significant that M. Noth, who also posits opposition to the second Temple, can cite as his only proof the Samaritan schism! (See "Jerusalem and the Israelite Tradition," The Lazws in the Pentateuch and Other Studies [i966], I43 [trans. Ap- Thomas; reprinted from OTS (ig5o), 8:28-46]. Moreover, M. Haran, Between ri'shon5t and hadash5t, i963, 94-6 (Heb.) plausibly suggests that the Temple is not even built, and the prophet is consoling those who have tried and failed. Furthermore, the post-exilic era is uniquely distinguished by its attempt to harmonize conflicting legal and cultic traditions, especially those in P and D. (For the best analysis to date, see Y. Kaufmann, op. cit., IV, 324-53). This means that the laws of P were regarded as God's word as much as the already promulgated laws of D. If P were intended as a blueprint for the second Temple, is it, then, conceivable that such essential sancta as the anointment oil, the altar of wood and</page><page sequence="17">I48 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Temple (I Chr. XXIII 25 f.; 2 Chr. XXXV 3).34 In other words the Chronicler assumes that until the time of David, Levitic nrt5 continued to include duties of transport.35 Thus, for P, the post-conquest cult would continue the same, with only one slight difference. In the Wilderness, the Ark moved with the people; in the settlement, it moved among metal, the Urim and Tummim, and, above all, the Ark with its attendant hcapod&amp;et and cherubim, would have been omitted from the rebuilt Temple with nary a midrashic explanation in our post-exilic texts? The dating of the cultic materials of P (again, their composition, not their compilation and redaction) must be sought in pre-exilic times, but to demonstrate this, a separate study will be required. 34 M. Haran, "The Disappearance of the Ark," IEJ (I963), I3:52 f., is surely correct in believing that 2 Chr. XXXV 3 is unhistorical. In- deed, it is to be seen as a midrash on Num. VII 9 where Inn= RtD I IRV In= but where three changes have been introduced: (a) Ark porterage, a Kohathite function, is ascribed to all Levites; (b) ;1571 is reinterpreted as cult service as elsewhere in Chronicles (e.g., i Chr. XXIII 28. For the translation of Num. VI 7 see ad loc. ? I3, and see Milgrom, Studies, ? 73, for a similar midrash in Nehemiah); (c) the Levites are a consecrated class (tVT71Uj) contra to (P (see 2 Chr. XXIII 6). However, I agree with Rudolph ad loc., versus Haran, that this verse does not imply that the Ark was transported (in cultic processions) during the period of the First Temple, since it would contradict the Chronicler's own assertion that Ark porterage ceased in David's time (i Chr. XXIII 26. On the negative evidence of Ps. CXXXII, see now D. R. Hillers CBQ [I968], 30:48-55). Moreover, tln, as recognized by A. Ehrlich, op. cit. ad loc., can mean "leave" (e.g., Hos. IV 5), and the sense of 2 Chr. XXXV 3, with Rudolph (also cited by Haran, ibid., nn. I2, i5), is that ever since the erection of the Temple the Levites have veen relieved of their Ark-carrying role and are therefore free to assume new cultic responsibilities. Indeed, in Josiah's time, according to the Chronicler, they permanently replace the laity as ritual slaugh- terers of the Pesach (2 Chr. XXXV 6, ii). 35 When the reorganization of the cult took place and the Levites were assigned new duties (i Chr. XXIII 27-32). Of course, the Chronic- ler's Tabernacle theory leads to fanciful reconstruction: the Ark was brought to Jerusalem but the Tabernacle and bronze altar remained at Gibeon (2 Chr. I 3-6; also I Chr. XVI 39 f., XXI 29); an angel prevented David from worshipping at Gibeon (i Chr. XXI 30), but the theophany at Araunah's altar (i Chr. XXI 26) led David to declare the latter as the future site of the Temple (2 Chr. XXII i). In my opi- nion, it was the memory of a functioning Tabernacle in the pre-Shilo period that led to the natural, if forced, variant tradition that the Tabernacle continued to operate iuntil $olormon's Temple,</page><page sequence="18">LEVITICAL 'ABODA-MILGROM I49 them. In either case, it remained in their midst. The innr of the Levites made this possible. ? I3. Composite of Levitic rrzv, The results of this study are best summarized through a composite of all the passages of Levitic rTn5 in translation. Parentheses are used for the identification of pronouns and comment is reserved for the notes. The category of tnrn- in each passage (see definitions, ? 2) is indicated by the following superlinear sigla: G - physical labor, in general (definition i); R total removal labor (definition 2); Rda = the dismantling-assembling division of removal, rendered for convenience "packing" (definition 3a); Rt = transport division of removal (definition 3b). Num. III 7 They (the Levites) shall perform guard duty for him (Aaron) and for the whole community before the Tent of Meeting in doing 36 the work G of the Tabernacle. Num. III 8 They (the Levites) shall guard all the furnishings of the Tent of Meeting-a guard duty on bahalf of the Israelites-in doing the workG of the Tabernacle. 37 Num. III 25 f.

Both vss. 7 and 8 are necessary for spelling out the total guard duty incumbent upon the Levites, i.e., when the camp is at rest (vs. 7) and in transit (vs. 8). The latter is made certain by 8aoc referring to the sancta, which the Levites guarded during the march (Nurn. III 25, 3I, 36 and see ? 7) but which only priests were allowed to guard in camp (Nurn. XVII 5). The Levitic guard duty when the camp was at rest took place around the Tabernacle complex (Num. I 53). For this very reason, 71=7 in this verse (but not in vs. 7) might well refer to re- moval labor (R). It would definitely be the case if the first 57= 3t27ll 7:17 tnV (vs. 7b) could be proven a dittography of the second (vs. 8b), but the evidence of the textual manuscripts and versions is negative. 38: =relating to, in connection with, for.

This view alone can explain the need for purificatory rites accompanying the induction service of the Levites. For guard duty (1117=7Z) performed around and at a distance from the Tabernacle complex would require no purification since no contact with sancta is entailed; removal operations (MV*r57), on the other hand, being the sole Levitic function calling for the direct handling of sancta, would require purificatory aspergings and sacrifices. Moreover, the induction ceremony is limited only to mature Levites, for one of the purifications reads: "pass a razor over their whole bodies" (vs. 7). But phsysical maturity is a requirement for removal work and not for guard duty (see ?? 3, 7). Furthermore, nnnw;: also is for the purpose of "removing wrath" (e.g., I 53), yet it is missing in vs. ig. Hence we have another indication that 718257 of Num. ch. VIII refers strictly to removal.

IV, removal labor and census for physically able Levites; ch. VII, work tools are provided; ch. VIII, work force is inducted; VIII 23-26, work force is retired. For the impact of this view on the enigmatic '17WV z! lW (vs. I9), see Milgrom, Studies, ?? 27-30. 49 See n. 3 for the meaning of the last phrase. This verse by itself gives the lie to the accepted notion that P's Levites are menial ser- vants and that t,17 is a euphemism for janitorial functions. To the contrary, since Levites have no access to the Tabernacle, its upkeep is not their responsibility, but is a chore for the priests! And we have seen that 111f57 as the guarding and moving of the sancta is considered by P the highest privilege, as the bestowal of God's consummate grace. Ezekiel's denigration of the Levites is sui generis; it finds no echo in post-exilic sources and is a problem to itself. #17T:I still means "removal duties" (R) and excludes guarding since the latter is not encompassed by the term 71X Only removal gave the Levites access to sancta; guarding, on the other hand, took place outside the sacred area and at the entrance where laymen could gather but were warned away from sancta (XVIII 3). ; comprising removal and guarding, may be found in ch.

III 7 (see n. 37). However, the context is different. It deals solely with the assembled and functioning Tabernacle and the need to prevent encroachment upon the sacred objects (vs. 3) and upon the officiating priests (vs. 4b). For further discussion, see Milgrom, Stutdies, ?? I3-I5 and Table C. 52 That fl77 here is Levitic work, in toto, and comprises guarding as well as removal, is indicated by the following verse (vs. 7). It is clear that priestly duties (vs. 7, see below) are contrasted with Levitic 71157V (vs. 6). Just as the former includes guarding (7a), so the latter. Vs. 7 presents us with the only mention in all of P of priestly ;1M7. Its problem is twofold: it looks textually corrupt and ideologically indefensible. M 27 1nI22 flt nn 2V 111=1. The commentaries admit the difficulties. Some follow the LXX, Saim, and Syr. which read ;1flV 13'72171, but the emendation says nothing and f1l327 is attached to nothing. (Ehrlich, Ranidglosser, ad loc., retains the consonan- tal text reading 1311i57WI but the words after 711rit are left dangling). E. A. Speiser, "Unrecognized Dedication," IEJ (I963), I3:69-73, breaks out of this impasse by interpreting m11317 as "dedication" rather than previously held "gift," and he renders: the Levites "given (13111) in dedication (;l?;) to the Lord. You (the priests), on the other hand, along with your sons, shall take care (11?=W3) to perform (n32Ub71) your duties in all matters pertaining to the altar and what is inside the curtain. I have made (11N) your priesthood a service of dedication (;lVD lt 7)." Speiser's is a giant step forward but he has not cleared the woods: (i) The proposed hendiadys N1Vl:1M 11Zt=11, 8 words apart, is grammatically awkward. Moreover, it is nonsense. The priesthood has no V718:5 "inside the curtain" (see Milgrom, Studies, ? 2 Table B). 0132Vf1 must therefore be detached from 021111. (2) ;1mntD 11:572 "service of dedication" is also troublesome. Nowhere is the priesthood called a or its ranks 1311. Moreover, the root Jil as Speiser himself observes, connotes subordination. Priests, however, are never assigned ("subordinated"), rather assigned to them are Levites (Num. III 9; VIII i6, I9; XVIII 6; i Chr. VI 33) and emolu- ments (e.g., Num. XVIII 8, ii, I2, I9). A tempting solution-but requiring radical amputation--is to delete the entire crux; these words are indeed missing in the parallel verse, Num. III io. (The LXX, to the contrary, puts them in, but the changed vocabulary reveals the hand of a glossator, see S. Daniel,</page><page sequence="23">154 THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Num.

The pur- pose of the gloss would be simple: not to contrast with the Levites' iTllln (dedication) of the previous verse (so Speiser), but to anticipate the priests' 71131t (gifts) in the following section (vss. 8-20); the priests are rewarded for incurring mortal danger in their V7711 (note vs. ib- same term 0:41NIZ) just as the Levites are rewarded for their hazardous i1'=W (XVIII 2 f., 2I-23). Thus we revert to il?lD as "gift." AT's render- ing "lucrative service" (following Ehrlich Randlossen II, I78) is not, as Speiser contends, "hardly an edifying picture of high religious function" (op. cit., p. 70), but justifiable compensation for the risk of life. In my view, the Massoretic division and vocalization are correct: UlVf1=1 contrasts with 1Innrw just as Levitic ; (e.g., III 3I, 36); one verse (albeit abstruse) actually terminates with the verbal form 11=1 (see IV 26). Did the priests also have ;1=W, physical labor ? Indeed they did: to dismantle and cover the sancta when camp was broken and to reassemble them when camp was made (Num. IV 5-15). Moreover the meaning of ;1flV in ch. XVIII expands to embrace guard duty as well (n. 54, below). Thus ;Illlt 1171 could imply that the total labor of the priesthood in guarding (117=11) and removal (13111"1) will be rewarded. Interestingly, as Prof. S. Lieber- man has pointed out to me, Nachmanides, ad loc., converges upon a similar interpretation of 7131?Z. The possibility must be left open, however--to judge by the readings of the Versions-that Ml1=1 may be a gloss. The following words 23n:;1:: 3Nt 1 2N Ullt 17:V would be a further gloss announcing the priestly gifts in return for their 3 For T1T = see Job X I7b; XIV I4b; lslm hlpt "to pay a reward" in Phoenician, see "Coronation of Athens," I. 7, H.

(2) Above all, XVIII 22 is the awaited reply to XVII 28, i.e., the people's fear of approaching is now assuaged.
