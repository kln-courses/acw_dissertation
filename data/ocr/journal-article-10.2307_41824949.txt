<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Great Depression and the Prints of Blanche Grambs James Wechsler This article is the igg6 winner of the Reba and Dave Williams Prìze for an outstanding contribution on American printmaking Avoided for generations by most historians of American art, during the past decade and a half Social Realism of the 1930s has been increasingly recognized as a significant and complex movement. While certain artists, such as Philip Evergood, Ben Shahn and Raphael Soyer, have been singled out for their contributions, many artists worthy of scholarly attention have been overlooked. This becomes espe- cially apparent when one examines printmaking of the 1930s. During the first years of the Great Depression, the print's inherent ability to communicate to a mass audience attracted scores of socially engaged artists. Through the extensive printmaking units of the Works Progress Administration's Federal Art Project (WPA/FAP) during the second half of the decade, the interest in printmaking grew to what can be termed (with little exaggeration) a renaissance. One artist whose graphic work vigorously con- tributed to the renewed vitality of the medium during the 1930s is Blanche Mary Grambs (fig. 235). Although Grambs was active as a printmaker for only six years, during her brief career she produced some of the most indelible expressions of the Great Depression. Born in Beijing, China, in 1916 to American par- ents, Grambs was raised in Tian-Jing (formerly Tin- Sin), a small city divided into quarters that were each occupied by different Western business interests, embassies and soldiers. She recalled a sense of alien- ation growing up in the foreign enclave where the European population did not associate with the PRINT QUARTERLY, XIII, 1 996, 4</page><page sequence="2">BLANCHE GRAMBS 377 235.

Her interest in art emerged at the age of thirteen, when she began participating in an informal sketch group arranged by adults in the community. During the next four years Grambs spent her free time drawing portraits of the peasants who lived in the Chinese section of the city. Her facility with pastel caught the attention of ama- teur artist Pearl Eastham, who encouraged Grambs to apply to the Art Students League in New York. Anxious to leave China, Grambs was overjoyed when she was accepted to the League with a full scholarship for the 1934 academic year. In March 1934, when seventeen-year old Grambs arrived in New York, the city was boiling with radical activity. Grambs recalled, 'I was so sheltered. I didn't know anything about anything. I knew that things were not right in the world but I didn't know why'.3 The lecturing and arguing of soapbox orators in Columbus Circle near her residential hotel spoke to the ill-defined and internalized social awareness that she developed growing up in Tian-Jing. However, where her sensitivity to societal evils generated anxiety in her youth, as a young woman in New York these emotions were supplanted by unambiguous outrage and a passionate conviction that activists 'could do something about it'.4 In the spring of 1934 Grambs entered an art world that was buzzing with ideas concerning art and social commitment. A year earlier, in April 1933, the Mexican muralist Diego Rivera was dismissed by his patrons, the Rockefeller family, for refusing to remove a portrait of Lenin from the Man At The Crossroads mural in the RCA building at Rockefeller Center, New Yor¡£. The incident sparked a storm of protest from artists, writers and critics, the echo of which loudly resounded in a divisive cultural debate.5 Fuel was added to the fire in February 1934, when Rivera's unfinished mural was destroyed. These events prompted the Communist artists Hugo Geliert and Harry Gotdieb, members of the John Reed Club's New York chapter, to organize the Artists' Committee of Action. A precursor of the Artists' Union, the Artists' Committee of Action was founded to pressure Mayor Fiorello La Guardia into providing artists with a municipal art gallery that would free them from the disempowering patronage and gallery system. Geliert and Gottlieb had honed their methods of activism during the previous decade, and in the early 1930s they found a substantial contingent of more recently radicalized artists willing to join them in the streets on picket lines and at rallies. The Art Students League became a hub of revolutionary activity for young artists. As a newcomer, Grambs had few preconceived notions about whom to study with at the League. Having grown up in Tian-Jing, she was completely unfamiliar with the Western canon of artists, and New York's museums and art galleries gave her a crash course in modern art. Finding herself increasingly drawn to the confrontational work of Käthe Kollwitz, José Clemente Orozco and George Grosz, she studied these artists, making frequent trips to the art room and the print collection of the New York Public Library. When Grambs learned that Grosz was teaching at the League, she was anxious to work with the creator of the biting Ecce Homo drawings, which she had recendy seen reproduced in a book at the library. However, like many other young radicals at the League, she was frustrated to find that the disillusioned German refugee was not interested in disseminating the issues that characterized his earlier, insurgent work. Grambs was equally uninspired by the well-known American artists Kenneth Hays Miller, Thomas Hart Benton and John Steuart Curry, all of whom were uncon- cerned with the revolutionary themes that Grambs became passionate about exploring. But, in Harry Sternberg's printmaking class, Grambs found a milieu of enthusiastic radicals, such as Winifred Milius, Mary Annand, Irving Marantz, Julian Alberts, Rita Albers, Riva Helfond and Ida Abelman, as well as Deyo Jacobs (who would die fighting for the Loyalists in Spain as part of the Lincoln Brigade), Will Bar net (who was also the printer for the class), and Hugh 'Lefty' Miller, whom Grambs would later marry. i.

Of course I knew nothing about it. I was told they were red bandits. I called them Hong Hu- zfii (red beards).6 Only a few years older than most of his students, Sternberg was an energetic, approachable and inter- ested instructor. His class was run like an open atelier, where students were invited to experiment with differ- ent media and to freely pursue their interests. Yet Sternberg's fiery commitment to printmaking as a rev- olutionary medium was contagious. He declared: No other medium has the adaptability of the print, which can be produced rapidly and inexpensively in large quantities, and can be widely distributed at low cost. The chief drag upon the development of the immense possibilities ready to hand in the print field today is the cult of rare prints. The fancy jargon of print connoisseur ship is no more than a pretentious front for speculation with an artificially limited product.7 Like Robert Henri and the artists of the Ash Can school of the previous generation, Sternberg advo- cated depictions of raw life, encouraging his students to expose the grimmest realities of the Depression. Following Sternberg's advice, Grambs took her sketchbook and explored the city, focussing on the plight of the underclasses. Her first print, Sweat Shop (1934; fig. 236), depicts a pieceworker stooped and submissive as if imprisoned in the oppressive setting. The oversized window at her right, obstructed by a menacing network of crooked girders, affords no access to the outside and no escape from drudgery. The rigid, geometrically divided space in Dock Workers (1935; fig. 237) similarly confines the uncomfortably huddled mass of longshoremen who rush into the shadowy, fortress-like structure. A pleas- ant fragment of dáylit harbour, almost a caricature of the picturesque, contrasts sharply with the dismal countenance of the working men. The dynamic, tri- angular composition and repetitive, aggressively sim- plified, forms of their caps, shoulders, arms and backs are clearly informed by the work of Orozco, whom Grambs admired above all the Mexican muralists.8 In an extremely short time, through prints such as Sweat Shop and Dock Workers , Grambs became familiar with the medium of lithography. As she began to experiment with the technical possibilities of working on the stone, her prints became bolder and her com- positions more advanced. Almost overnight, she made a significant leap from very competent, anecdotal illustrations of the urban scene to a body of work the intensity of which is matched by few artists working at that time. Hands (1935; fig. 238), a haunting and exquisitely ren- dered tusche and crayon lithograph, is a study in frailty that functions on multiple levels. Emerging from the passages of dense black shadow, the subject's long, graceful, ghostly white fingers loosely grip a crutch. Transcending mere poignancy, the print draws an analogy between idle hands, physical handicap and the crippled economy. No Work (1935), Depression (1935) and No Hope (1936; figs. 239-41) are significantly less subde, their titles seeming to imply a gloomy equation. The severe diagonals in No Work activate the composi- tion so that the broken windows of the derelict build- ing, the deserted street and shadowy sidewalk form a vortex around the unemployed worker. Where the space in No Work has been energized, Grambs employed different expressive means in No Hope. The dormant smokestacks behind the oppressive iron gate and the heavy black atmosphere that immobilizes the resigned and dissipated figures, imbue this print with a palpable mood of stagnation. All of the prints discussed up to this point were printed at the League by Will Barnet. For a brief period in 1935, after Grambs left the League and before the FAP got underway, she turned to George Miller &amp; Sons, a well-known lithography studio located on 14th Street near the studio she shared with 'Lefty'. Printed by master lithographer George Miller in his trademark, delicately nuanced, silvery tonalities, Depression is none the less, an unflinching, relendessly disturbing image. Set against an impenetrable brick wall, the figure is depicted at the point of emotional 6. Interview of 15 May 1995. 7.

While Grambs was unable to afford a trip to Mexico during this period, she became familiar with Orozco's work through repro- ductions in Alma Reed's seminal 1932 monograph on the artist. In 1936 Grambs and a number of other students at the League made what she called a 'pilgrimage' to Dartmouth University in New Hampshire to see Orozco's 1932-33 frescoes in the Fisher Ames Baker Memorial Library.</page><page sequence="6">BLANCHE GRAMBS 381 237.

His shaved head, thinning frame, and body language of utter resignation owe an obvious formal debt to the work of Van Gogh and Munch, who, in the late nineteenth century, pioneered the depiction of such high-keyed expressions of psychological turmoil. However, unlike the work of those artists who explored emotional states through highly personalized visual statements, Grambs's work shares a closer affinity to the prints of Kollwitz. As Kollwitz did in many of her most powerful works, Grambs locates the cause of the figure's angst not in subjective, romantic notions of the human condition, rather in the Marxist concept of oppression and class struggle. The cause of the figure's spiritual depression is the economic depression, a peri- odic crisis inevitable under capitalism, in which, The Communist Manifesto asserts, society suddenly finds itself put back into a state of momentary barbarism; it appears as if a famine, a universal war of devastation [has] cut off the supply of every means of subsistence; industry and com- merce seem to be destroyed.9 Since her arrival in New York, Grambs had become 9.

She was filled with optimism about having 'just discovered this absolutely wonderful thing called Communism' that could correct the problems that plagued society.10 Although she was not a member of the Communist Party during this period, Grambs took classes in Marxist economics at the New Workers School on 14th Street, attended Communist Party ral- lies, helped design floats for May Day parades, and became involved with the Workers Film and Photo League, an Agit-Prop organization sponsored by the Communist Party.11 For many trying to make sense of the Depression, Marxism offered a ray of hope. The Depression could be seen as the darkest hour before the dawn of a new, cooperative society. Grambs's introduction to the Communist move- ment came at a significant historical moment. It was the beginning of the Popular Front, a short-lived period of unique cooperation between various factions of the revolutionary Left. More significantly, however, through the support of the New Deal art projects, it was a period of cooperation between artists of the Left and the Federal Government.12 Through the FAP, art became an integral part of the New Deal's objective of treating the intangible symptoms of a demoralized nation. Visions of adversity by artists during the Depression participated in New Deal discourse, giving visual form to what President Roosevelt called the 10.

'I had great hopes for the future', Grambs notes, 'we all did at that time, we felt that there was a goal to work for'.14 Like most of her comrades at the League, Grambs became involved with the Artists' Union, serving in 1935 on the Union's membership committee. Since the Union actively encouraged all artists to unite 'in breaking down the isolation of the artist and in broad- ening his consciousness with respect to his social sta- tus',15 the requirements for membership were far from stringent. Grambs recalled, 'anyone who could draw a straight line ... or a crooked line' was readily admit- ted.16 Shortly after the Union was established, the WPA/FAP began its programme of employing artists. Much more farsighted than its short-lived precursor, the Public Works of Art Project (PWAP), which pri- marily selected more established artists, the FAP was explicitly orientated away from a creative hierarchy. Like the Artists' Union, the FAP endeavoured to 'assiduously avoid the imposition of preconceived ideas of what is best', basing this conviction on the New Deal ideology that, 'in a democracy all artists should have an opportunity to work and do their best and that the ultimate judgment as to the permanent value must be left to posterity.17 Grambs heard about the FAP at the League, through the printmaker Barbara Stavenitz, a monitor in the Sternberg class whose husband, Alexander Stavenitz, also a printmaker, was a supervisor on the FAP's Graphic Division. The FAP's salary of $23.86 per week provided enough income for Grambs and 'Lefty' (who was also on the project), to maintain their 14th Street studio.18 More important, since her schol- arship to the League (which was extended through the 1:935 term) had just been completed, and she could not afford to patronize regularly the workshops of estab- lished master printers, the Project gave her the oppor- tunity to continue devoting herself entirely to printmaking. In fact, artists employed by the Graphic Division of the Project were required to produce prints regularly. 'You would bring in a sketch to be okayed to the office and then they would either give you a plate or deliver a stone to your studio . . . you would do the drawing and they'd come pick it up', Grambs recalls.19 In exchange for this unrestricted access to print- making facilities and $23.86 per week, the prints pro- duced by the FAP artists became the property of the Federal Government. The editions were small, usually under 30 impressions, of which the artist was allowed to keep three. Because the FAP was operated with Federal tax funds, the benefits of the programme had to be made available to the entire country. Therefore, the works of art were allocated to tax- supported institutions such as libraries, schools and hospitals, or they were selected for exhibitions at FAP Art Centers. For the following ten months the FAP operated at full capacity, while the Artists' Union continued to grow, opening regional chapters across the country. Then, in November 1936 the first in a wave of budget cuts caused the dismissal of 3,923 workers from the New York City Federal Theatre Project, Federal Music Project, Federal Writers Project and Federal Art Project. This announcement by Lieut.-Col. Brehon B. Sommervell, the New York City WPA administrator, was met by a highly organized, newly empowered coalition of artists who were ready and willing to 'show the authorities that they are not to be kicked around at will'.20 On i December 1936 the Artists' Union took action, forcibly occupying the FAP headquarters on the eighth floor of 6 East 39th Street. When the police arrived they found the tenacious artists/ strikers 13. Franklin Roosevelt, Inauguration Speech, 4 March 1933, in F. L.

According to Grambs, 'When the cops got there they didn't know what to do with this big bunch of artists. Everybody locked arms and started to chant and that got to the police. They immediately started tearing everybody apart.'21 The scene quickly degraded into a violent mêlée. The fol- lowing day The New York Times reported: As men and women were hauled out of the throng and along the floor to the elevators, scores kicked, punched, clawed, spat at and even bit the police- men. Some of the women fought back more fiercely than the men. The police used their night sticks and fists freely on all who resisted, and even gave severe beatings to several.22 Among the injured were the artists Philip Reisman, Philip Evergood and Helen West Heller, as well as Police Sergeant William J. Greeley, who 'reported that his left thumb was bitten in the struggle'.23 Although Grambs emerged unscathed, she was one of the 219 artists who were arrested en masse and spent the night in jail. Whether to protect themselves from repercus- sions that could have compromised their positions on the Project, or simply in the spirit of non-cooperation, the artists each gave false names to the police. As the painter Joseph Solman humorously recounted: When we arrived at the 17th precinct, James Lechay led the long line of prisoners. 'Your name!' bellowed an officer, pad and pencil in hand. 'Jim Picasso' came the firm response. That was a sufficient cue. Cezanne, Da Vinci, and Peter Breughel followed. What an ego-satisfying game it was and with what relish everyone participated.24 Grambs, however, modestly chose to give the name of her grandmother, Loretta Kessler. The prank caused such confusion during the arraignment that the Artists' Union's attorneys Martin Popper and Vito Marcantonio had little trouble in having the 219 released with suspended sentences.25 The 219 incident set the stage for events of the following year. In 1937 there were massive cuts in Government funding for the arts projects that engen- dered an intense reaction from artists, dancers, actors and writers. Looking towards the organizational bat- tles being waged on the industrial front, unionized artists modelled their agitational activities on the tac- tics of organized labour. Beginning in late 1936, and particularly during the spring and summer of 1937, artists' strikes and skirmishes with the authorities shared headlines dominated by America's bitterest industrial struggles. The techniques of insurgency employed by the Artists' Union, such as sit-down strikes, picket lines and slowdowns, mirror events that took place on the industrial front. Throughout 1937 clashes between workers attempting to organize through the Congress of Industrial Organizations (CIO) and the police (and eventually the National Guard) regularly turned violent. The bloody and pro- longed steel, railroad and mine strikes in seven Midwestern states became so bitter that on 22 June I937, President Roosevelt personally sent a telegram to the management of the Youngstown Sheet and Tube Co., requesting that the following morning, 'in the promotion of public safety', they not open their plant, which had continued to operate during the strike with non-union labour.26 Unionized artists, who had 'discovered their identity with the working class as a whole',27 did not consider themselves removed from labour's fight, but integrally tied to it. Many artists such as Harry Gottlieb, Elizabeth Olds, Michael J. Gallagher and Dox Thrash made prints inspired by the heavily industrialized regions of Pennsylvania. In November 1935 Harry Sternberg applied for a John Simon Guggenheim fellowship to visit, live in and study the major industries and agriculture of the United States (Steel, Coal, Trans- portation, Wheat, Corn, Livestock, Lumbering, Cotton). To produce a series of portfolios in etching and lithography on these subjects from the angle of 'Man and Production.' To organize all this infor- mation for future painting of murals.28 Sternberg received glowing recommendations from 21. Interview of 15 May 1995. 22.

His application was rewarded with a $2,000 fellowship to pursue the project for six months. In addition, Henry Allen Moe of the Guggenheim Foundation wrote letters of introduction to the Presidents and General Supervisors of numerous coal- mining companies and steel mills in Pennsylvania, requesting permission for Sternberg to sketch in their mines and mills, while at the same time, reassuring them that 'Sternberg is no long-haired artist, but is a sensible practical and able young man'.29 During the summer months of 1936, Sternberg invited his former pupils - Grambs, 'Lefty', Riva Helfond and Helfond's fiancé, the sculptor Bill Barrett - to join him on some of these trips to the coal and steel regions. Since Barrett had worked in the coal mines of Lanceford, Pennsylvania, he was able to arrange lodgings for the New York artists in the home of a mining family.30 Grambs was profoundly affected by the poverty of the mining family, the soot-covered desolation of the company town, and, especially, by her descents into the deep tunnels of the anthracite mine. She found the tactility of aquatint more suitable than lithography for expressing the diffused light from the smoke of per- petually burning coalpit fires on the outskirts of town, and the gritty blackness of the subterranean mines. With her seminal print Miner's Head (1937; fig. 242) Grambs pushed the boundaries of the medium to an extreme degree, intensifying the rough, coarsely etched surface of the plate with a variety of scraping tools. As David Kiehl has observed: her crusty, heavily etched layers of aquatint echo the deadly dust-laden environment of the mine .... In this portrait she has captured the twin spectres of a miner's life, potential death underground and the searing pain of black-lung disease.31 In this print, the subject's hollow, sunken cheeks, clenched jaw and haunting 'thousand yard stare' accentuate the perilous conditions that miners were compelled to endure. Since wages for their dangerous occupation guaranteed a severely inadequate living standard, the average miner found himself trapped in a perpetual cycle, with no hope of ever improving his lot.32 In Going into the Mines (1937; fig. 243), Grambs comments on this bleak situation through the contin- uous succession of dispirited, faceless workers who march like troops of walking wounded into the tomb- like mineshaft. According to Harry Sternberg, not only were miners faced each day with the hazards of their trade and with the difficulties that accompany poverty, but also, in the service of their employers, they added to their own hardship. Sternberg noted that in an effort to obtain every ounce of profit from some of the older mines, coal companies would order the systematic removal of the columns of coal that were left unmined as structural support in the tunnels. 'It seems profoundly significant', he wrote, 'that the miners blasting out the supporting coal pillars far underground, are often destroying the foundations of their homes above them'.33 Indeed, in Grambs's print Workers' Homes, Lanceford, Pennsylvania (1937; fig. 244) the undulating culm-banked streets seem to engulf the row of clapboard shacks, while the coal-breaker's dis- tinctive form looms in the background. For Grambs, as well as the other artists visiting Lanceford, the coal- breaker's deafening rumbles and massive, physical presence epitomized their experience of the town. In Coal Breaker (1938; fig. 245), the sharp-angled silhouette of the elevated, coal car tracks stand out in dynamic, geometric counterpoint to the sweeping contours of the slagheaps in the foreground. Unlike the Precision- ist artists who drew so much inspiration from the in- dustrial landscape, through Grambs's eyes, 'machine- age' structures are significantly unglorified. Their 'pure' forms are interrupted by expressive, gestural marks. Different from the streamlined factories of Howard Cook, Jolan Gross-Be ttelheim and Louis Lozowick, 29. Henry Allen Moe to E. W.

Like a grotesque, anthropomorphic deity, it dominates the composition, overshadowing the profusion of cruci- fix gravestones, churches and ramshackle houses in the diminutive company town. By documenting the appalling environment of the mines underground and the mining and mill-towns above, Grambs contributed to organized labour's struggle for change. In the spring of 1939 Grambs and 'Lefty' were mar- ried and sailed for France, where 'Lefty' believed they could live much more cheaply than in America. However, Grambs had become quite attached to Manhattan, and had strong misgivings about leaving the city where her art had developed so rapidly: 'it was really terrible for me because I felt I had put my roots down in New York ... it was very much of a wrench for me to go'.34 The couple spent that summer in Brittany, then travelled to Paris, arriving there in September, just as war was declared. After the har- rowing experience of finding one border crossing after another closed, they eventually managed to escape as part of the last official group to leave France. Back in New York, Grambs found the art world had changed. Although the FAP would officially continue to exist until 1943, its scope had been diminished when funding for it was transferred from the Federal level to the State level in 1939. Subsequently, she went to work as a fashion illustrator for Woman's Day magazine, sup- porting herself while 'Lefty' went into the army. Although he survived active duty, the War and the couple's ill-fated trip to Europe put a severe strain on their relationship. Shortly after he returned from war, 'Lefty' and Grambs were divorced. During the ensu- ing years, Grambs continued to make her living as an artist, illustrating over 30 children's books. In 1952 she married James Aronson, a journalist, scholar and the co-founder of the National Guardian. The two remained together, living on Manhattan's Lower East Side until Aronson's death in 1988. Although Grambs did not continue to make prints after she left the FAP, she continued to make art and continued to remain extremely active politically. But, it was only during the 1930s that her art and her com- mitment to social change meshed so seamlessly. Her work contributes immeasurably to our understanding of American printmaking during the 1930s, a period in which hundreds of artists collectively blurred the boundaries between art and politics. Her prints embody the struggle and hope that characterized the attitude of a substantial number of artists at that time. Yet, although Grambs drew inspiration from a partic- ular set of social and economic conditions, her work also expresses ideas and emotions that extend beyond a specific place and time. Out of the Great Depression she created something universal and lasting. 34. Interview of 15 May 1995. Appendix Checklist of the Prints 1934 1.

These cards list every print received by the WPA/FAP headquarters in Washington, D.C., for exhibition and allocation purposes from projects all over the country. According to these cards, Grambs produced a total of 25 prints for the WPA/FAP. The Cahill number may refer to the order in which the prints were received.</page><page sequence="18">BLANCHE GRAMBS 393 244.

Burlesque Lithograph 362 X 321 mm Although this print was dated by the artist as 1938, it does not appear on the Cahill list. It is a WPA/FAP print that was never sent to Washington, D.C., for allocation, or it was done in 1938 inde- pendent of the WPA/FAP, or it was made at the ASL before the artist joined the project. (information courtesy of Mary Ryan Gallery, New York) 43.

Mary , c. 1938 Medium not known Dimensions not known Published by the WPA/FAP NYC (Cahill no. 18) 46. Miners Going to Work , c. 1938 (also called Miners) Etching with aquatint, edition approximately 25 250 X 375 mm Published by the WPA/FAP NYC (Cahill no. 19) Two prints with this title appear on the allocation card (see Going into the Mines , 1937). This version is most likely the print called Miners in the collections listed below. Although, technically and stylistically, this print relates to Grambs's work, the artist has no recollection of making it and has stated that it was not done by her. While signa- tures appear on the impressions of this print in New York, they are not in Grambs's hand. She has suggested that it may be by her then partner, 'Lefty' Miller. (collections of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York; The New York Public Library) 1939 47. Girl (also called Negro Girl, and Head) Etching with aquatint printed in brown and green, edition approx- imately 25 300 X 389 mm Published by the WPA/FAP NYC (Cahill no. 23) (collections of the New York Public Library; the Newark Museum, New Jersey) 48. Girl with Blue Hair Lithograph printed in blue and brown, edition approximately 25 455 x 33° mm Published by the WPA/FAP NYC (Cahill no. 25) Like Miners Going to Work, c. 1938, the artist has no recollection of making this print and has stated that it was not done by her. Although signatures appear on several impressions of this print in the collections listed below, the ones I have seen in New York and Newark are not in Grambs's hand. File proofs in the Newark Museum and the University of Michigan are dated August 1939, a time when Grambs was in Paris. If Girl with Blue Hair is by Grambs, it is possible that she did the drawing on the stones just before she left the project and never saw the edition.
