<plain_text><page sequence="1">Doctoral Dissertations in Art History (see next page) This compilation is arranged under two headings: dissertations completed since 1960, and dissertations in progress, some of which will have been completed during the current academic year. The editor has solicited this information from the graduate schools in art history in the United States which are known to us. Nearly all on our list have responded, but there are a few important omissions (no- tably UC-Berkeley) which we expect to publish when received. Also there are some new Ph.D. programs: Penn State, established a year ago; U. of Oregon, starting September, 1968. Dissertation subjects at these newly or- ganised graduate departments will be listed in the ART JOURNAL when received. We hope to be able to add similar lists from Canada and from Europe.</page><page sequence="2">Doctoral Dissertations UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES, Department of Art Dissertations completed since 1960 Donald Strong "Leonardo da Vinci on the Eye" Ruth Mellinkoff "The Iconography of the Horns of Moses" David Metzger "Studies in the Discourses of Sir Joshua Reynolds" Shirley Hopps "A Study of Fifteenth Century Netherlandish Triptychs" Adele Holcomb "J.
