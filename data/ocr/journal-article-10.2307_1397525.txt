Full tides and publication details of works cited in the present article are given in the "Bibliography."-Editor's note. SINCE HU SHIN M (1891- ) published his epoch- making Outline of the History of Chinese Philosophy' in 1919-in which he overthrew many traditions, presented many new theories, and offered many original interpretations-many problems about dates, authenticity of texts, meanings of terms and concepts, and interrelationships of philosophical systems in China have been under lively discussion among Western as well as Chinese scholars. Many questions still remain unanswered. The more outstanding and more controversial of these questions, whether settled or nor, are given below in bare outline: (1) The division of the history of Chinese philosophy into periods. Almost every modern historian of Chinese philosophy has his own peri- odization. Only two need be considered here, Hu Shih and Fung Yu-lan, Z% i M (1895- ). Strangely enough, Hu Shih, the intellectual rebel, has chosen to follow the usual pattern of three periods as applied to Chinese history in general, namely, the ancient period from the earliest times to Han Fei Tzii P -T (d. 233 B.C.), the middle period from the Han Dynasty (202 B.C.--A.D. 220) to the Northern Sung (960-1126), and the recent period from the Southern Sung (1127-1279) to our own times.2 This is virtually the same as the common periodization accepted by Chinese his- torians, although the more usual breaks are 221 B.C. and A.D. 960.

' Outline, pp. 6-8. 157</page><page sequence="2">158 WING-TSIT CHAN Yu-lan, however, divides the history of Chinese philosophy into two periods, that of "the philosophers" and that of "the Classics." The first period, from the earliest times to Huai-nan Tzii f -A -T (d. 122 B.C.), he says, is charac- terized by freedom of thought and variety of systems, while the second period, from Tung Chung-shu 2 f f (179-104 B.C.) to the twentieth century, is characterized by the supremacy of Confucianism and the reliance of philosophers on the Classics both for terminology and for thought.3 He further explains that this difference is due to the fact that in ancient times there were radical changes in society and economy which produced freedom and variety of thought, whereas such transformations did not take place in the period of the Classics.' Because of the unusual position he gives to the Classics in the history of Chinese philosophy, Fung has included a long dis- cussion of Liao P'ing At (1852-1932) at the end of his History.' In so doing he has the distinction of being the only writer who has brought Liao P'ing into the history of Chinese philosophy; no one else thinks of doing so, because it is extremely difficult to see what relation Liao can have with Chinese philosophy at all, although he is important in relation to the tradi- tion of the Classics. As to the division into two periods, while the theory is still accepted by many students, it is untenable. Few historians will agree with Fung that there have been no radical changes in Chinese history during the last two thousand years. How can Fung, on his theory, explain the emergence of the peculiarly Chinese schools of Buddhism, of Neo-Moism, which he has so brilliantly reconstructed, and of Neo-Confucianism, unless new social and economic forces were at work? How sound his interpretation of Chinese history is can be seen from his theory that Chinese philosophy, literature, and art were products of the Chinese agrarian economy and that both Taoism and Confucianism expressed the aspirations and inspirations of farmers (as contrasted with Greek philosophy which is the product of a maritime economy).' He also says that ancient Chinese scholars were usually landlords,? whereas the fact is that Confucius (551-479 B.C.), Lao Tz7i (b. 570 B.C.?), Chuang Tza (between 399 and 29 B.C.), Mo Tzi (fl. 479-438 B.C.), and Mencius (371-289 B.C.) are not known to have owned any land. As to reliance on the Classics, it is true that, in the case of Neo- Taoists, Hsiang Hsiu [ i A (1st half of 3rd century) and Kuo Hsiang 9 V 3A History of Chinese Philosophy (Princeton: Princecon University Press), Vol. I (new ed., 1952), p. 17; VoL 11 (1953), p. 2.

A.D. 312) developed their ideas in their commentaries on the Chuang Tzi, but their ideas are original and far different from those of the Lao Tzui (Tao-ti ching) and the Chuang Tzi. As Fung himself has pointed out, the idea of non-being (wu) a in early Taoism meant having no name, whereas to the Neo-Taoists it is literally non-being.8 In Neo-Confucianism, the most important ancient texts used are the Four Books, which, strictly speaking, are not Classics. When Chu Hsi * X (1130-1200) annotated them, he commented on them, not as classical texts but as vehicles to express his philosophy of Li A (Principle, Reason, Law), a concept hardly men- tioned in the Four Books. Any student of modern Chinese philosophy is familiar with the famous declaration of Lu Hsiang-shan ~ UIL (1139- 1192) that "the Six Classics are my footnotes."' Lu, like Chu, used the Classics to elaborate his own philosophy rather than as its basis. Any periodization is only a convention. But the division into three periods as followed by Hu does not prejudice one's interpretation of Chinese philoso- phy, whereas Fung's scheme certainly does. (2) Has China a "modern" philosophy? Fung's division of the history of Chinese philosophy is intimately con- nected with his belief that China has had no "modern" philosophy. To him the criterion of modern Western philosophy is direct observation of reality and the use of new terminology. These have been absent in Chinese philoso- phy until our own times. Thus, he says, China had no modern philosophy until the twentieth century. Hu, on the other hand, contends that Chinese thought in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries was marked by a critical spirit, an inductive method, and an insistence on objective evidence. It was a period of intellectual renaissance. Thus, at least tacitly, he implies that the modern spirit was evident well before the twentieth century.'0 (3) The origin of the philosophical schools. In 1917 Hu rejected the traditional theory that the ancient Chinese phi- losophies originated in governmental offices, that is, Confucianism in the ministry of education, Moism in the office of the Guardians of Temples, and so forth." This theory, first propounded by Liu Hsin 2 4t (ca.46 B.C.-A.D. 23) in his History of the Former Han Dynasty, has been accepted through- 'Ibid., pp. 220-221. *Hsiang-sban ch'ian-chi ~ ,IJ -_ ("Complete Works of Lu Hsiang-shan"), 1934 ed., chap. 34, p.

Hu opposed the theory on four grounds. In the first place, accounts of Chinese thought before Liu Hsin, such as those in the Huai-nan TzA, the Hsiin Tzi, and the Chuang Tzi, do not hold such a theory. Second, it is absurd to say that philosophical systems grew out of governmental minis- tries. For example, in temple worship the emphasis was laid on sacrificing to one's deceased parents, whereas Moism preached universal love and re- fused to make any distinction between one's own parents and other people's parents. How, then, could Moism have originated in the office of the Guard- ians of Temples? Third, the classification of the schools in the History of the Former Han Dynasty is inconsistent because, for example, Kuan Tzii -- (d.645 B.c.?) the Legalist is included in the Taoist school. Fourth, it is nonsense to say that the* Taoist school originated in the ministry of official historians simply because Lao Tzii is believed to have been a custodian of documents. According to this reasoning, Confucianism should have origi- nated in the ministry of food because Confucius was once a keeper of grains.'2 Hu's own theory is that philosophies developed when individual thinkers sought to solve social problems. Since Hu's denunciation, Liu Hsin's theory has been generally abandoned. Fung, however, has revived Liu's theory and revised it. According to Fung, when feudalism began to disintegrate during the fifth and sixth centuries B.C., the officers of the governmental depart- ments lost their positions and scattered throughout the country. They turned to the teaching of their special branches of knowledge to make a living and thus gave rise to the different philosophical systems. Therefore, he con- cluded, the Taoist school had its origin in the hermits, the School of Names in the debaters, the Legalist school in the "men of methods" (of govern- ment), and so forth." The drawback to the theory is that members of the School of Names were not the only debaters in ancient China, nor were the Legalists the only men of methods. The Moists developed an elaborate system of argumentation. Most schools had their own methods of govern- ment. (4) The explanation of "ju" 1?. The term "ju" has long been used as a synonym for Confucianists. In an- cient China it meant the literati in general instead of Confucianists in particu- lar. But why the term "ju"? In his long and learned essay "Shuo ju" 1 14 ' Outline, appendix, pp. 1-6. 2 Short History, pp. 36-37; History, Vol. I, pp. xxxi-xxxiv. ' In Hu Shih lun-hsieh chin-chu a 3 M ~?~ 4:f ("Recent Sinological Treatises by Hu Shih"), First Series (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1935), pp. 3-81.</page><page sequence="5">BASIC PROBLEMS IN THE STUDY OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHY 161 Hu Shih conclusively proves that it means weakness, and refers to people in ancient China who wore antiquated-style garments and whose expression indicated meekness. These people, according to him, were descendants of the Yin Shang Dynasty (ca.1401-ca.1028 B.C.), who retained their ancient garment and practiced traditional rites, including the custom of three-year mourning. As descendants of a conquered people, they were suppressed and despised. But because of their religious heritage they were able to make a living by advising on and performing religious rites. Confucius, being a native of Lu, which was originally a part of Yin, belonged to this group of "weak" people. But two things made him an outstanding and different ju. One was the fact that at his time there was a prophecy that a True King would arise every five hundred years, and, according to Mencius, Confucius was regarded as such a True King. This naturally strengthened Confucius' strong sense of social responsibility. The other fact was that Confucius was a farsighted person who realized that the ancient Yin heritage had to be modified to suit the new culture of the Chou period in which he lived. The result was that he became a ju not of the weak but of the strong, and his school represented a new type of ju, firm, active, and progressive. Thus, Con- fucius was not the founder of the ju school, as Chinese historians have held, but he revived an old tradition, injected new blood into it, and raised it to new heights.5 The remarkable thing about Hu's theory is not only that it is completely new and convincing but that it is built on literary evidence from sources known long and well to Chinese scholars. The historical and linguistic questions involved cannot be considered here. Generally speaking, the theory has been accepted in its basic features. Fung differs from Hu in saying that the ju were government officials who lost their positions as feudalism began to disintegrate and had to earn their livelihood in the way Hu has described."' Following the same line of thought but emphasizing his own ideology of class struggle, Kuo Mo-jo 1f~ ~i (1893- ) claims that as the slaves re- belled, the nobility collapsed, degenerated, became "weak," and made a living in a non-productive manner."1 Creel thinks that the ju were called "weak- lings" in a derisive sense, because they were not warlike." Fung's theory is 'Ibid., pp. 9-10, 16-17, 19-22, 26-27, 33, 37, 42, 52, 66, 76, 80.

Both Kuo and Creel offer an unnecessarily narrow explanation. (5) Lao Tzi and the LAO TzUi (TAo-TiE CHING). The question of Lao Tzii's historicity, identification, and dates, and the questions of the authenticity and date of the Lao Tzu are to a large extent identical. No other problem of ancient Chinese philosophy has aroused so many debates among so many scholars. Almost every Chinese writer on history, religion, or philosophy has something to say, with Hu and Fung again representing the two opposite camps. The philological, historical, and philosophical problems are so complicated that a long article would be re- quired merely to state the case."9 Lao Tzii's historicity is no longer ques- tioned, and his authorship of much of the Lao Tzui is generally granted. The chief question is that of the date of the book. Scholars rejecting the tradi- tional date of the sixth century B.C. have offered four types of arguments. The first is historical. Fung, for example, asserts that before Confucius no one wrote in a private capacity, and, therefore, the Lao Tzi, a private work, must have been later than Confucius. This is, of course, begging the question.20 The second type of argument is literary. Fung says that the form is not that of question and answer, and, therefore, the work must have been later than the Analects of Confucius. Furthermore, he says, the Lao Tzi is not of "simple and clear Canon style," and, therefore, must belong to the Period of the Contending States (403-221 B.C.).21 As Hu has pointed out, early works quoted in the Analects are not in the form of question and an- swer, thus disproving the theory that this form must be later than the Analects. Besides, most of the Analects is not in this form.2 The argument about the Canon style is again begging the question, aside from the fact that the Analects has much of this so-called Canon style, whatever Fung may mean by the term."2 Ku Chieh-kang B~Mi (1893- ) and Liang Ch'i-ch'ao A 4 8 (1873-1929) have asserted that terms like jen i t- (love and righteousness) belonged to later periods. Hu's answer is that "For discussions on the date of Lao Tzii, see Homer H. Dubs, "The Date and Circumstances of the Philosopher Lao-dz," Journal of the American Oriental Society, 61, No. 4 (December, 1941), 215-221; Derk Bodde's remarks, ibid., 62, No. I (March, 1942), 8-13; Dubs's reply, ibid., 62, No. 4 (December, 1942), 300-304; Bodde's further remarks, ibid., 64, No. I (March, 1944), 24-27.

"lHe used the term "simple and clear Canon style," probably thinking of the Moist Canons or proverbs.</page><page sequence="7">BASIC PROBLEMS IN THE STUDY OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHY 163 some such terms are found in early works, including the Analects. One may readily admit, however, that parts of the Lao Tzi are spurious, but no ancient work is free from later interpolation, addition, or corruption. The third type of argument centers around ideas, and is used extensively by Ku, Liang, Ch'ien Mu 0 0 (1894--), as well as others. They claim that the Lao Tzui shows the influence of the Analects, and, therefore, that the philosophy of the Lao Tz4 "should be" later than that of the Analects. Hu just as readily claims the opposite of this. Liang Ch'i-ch'ao contends that ideas in the Lao Tzz are "too radical" for the Spring and Autumn Period (722-481 B.C.). In reply, Hu mentions equally radical ideas in works generally accepted as belonging to that period.2" Hsii Ti-shan N~f Li (1893-1941) cites self-iontradictions in the Lao Tzi as proof of its un- reliability.25 Such contradictions are undeniable, but they are found in most ancient works. At any rate, they are irrelevant to the question of dates. The fourth type of argument pertains to collateral evidence. Ku Chieh-kang says that quotations from the Lao Tzi' in ancient works did not mention the title of the book and, therefore, the book must be late. The argument is weak because the so-called quotations are not actual quotations. Furthermore, there is no reason why the title of a work has to be mentioned along with a quotation from it before the quotation is considered to have come from it. Mencius quoted Confucius without mentioning the title Analects. No one doubts the pre-Mencian date of the Analects on that score. The argument that quotations of Lao Tzi in such works as the Chuang Tzu and the Han Fei Tzt do not agree with the Lao Tzu is not conclusive because they may represent different versions or lost parts. Neither is the argument convincing that Confucius never mentioned Lao Tzii. Mencius never mentioned Hsiin Tzii, and yet no one questions the fact that they were contemporaneous. As can readily be seen, the arguments favoring a later date are mostly speculative, and yet they have been so effective that most students still regard as final the view that the Lao Tza belonged to the fourth century B.C. or thereabouts. In fact, Fung wrote his History on that basis and built much of his reputation on it. The sentiment became so strong that any scholar upholding the traditional date was labeled conservative if not reactionary. The interesting thing is that speculation knows no limit. And so, Fung has recently moved the date even later, that is, later than Hui Shih A ~ (fl. 350-260 B.C.) and Kung-sun Lung ^.?  (fl. 284-259) (Fung's dates) instead of before, as he formerly believed. His reason is that the Lao Tzi "Hu Shih lun-hsfieh chin-chu, p. 13 3. ~Hsfi, Tao-chiao shib r ("History of the Taoist Religion") (Shanghai: Commercial Press, 1934), pp. 24-25.</page><page sequence="8">164 WING-TSIT CHAN discusses the "Nameless," and "it would seem that men should first have become conscious of the existence of names themselves," as Hui Shih and Kung-sun Lung certainly did.2 On this reasoning, he should have dated the Lao Tzi even later than Hsiin Tzii (fl. 298-238 B.c.) because the Lao Tzfi advocates wu-wei . . (inaction, non-artificiality) whereas Hsiin Tzii advo- cated wei f (artificiality, acquired training), the two terms being inter- changeable. In spite of Fung's persistence, the novelty of the theory is wear- ing out. There is now the tendency to go back to the earlier date of the sixth century B.C. (6) The dates of the BOOK OF CHANGES, the "Yang Chlu" chapter, the GREAT LEARNING, and the DOCTRINE OF THE MEAN. While Hu's position with reference to the Lao Tzii remains strong, his position with regard to the Book of Changes and the "Yang Chu" chapter in the Lieh Tzz is very weak. He is almost alone in insisting on the tradi- tional belief that Confucius was the author of the "Ten Appendices" in the Book of Changes. Other scholars, including Fung, ascribe them to later writers, probably of the Former Han Dynasty (202 B.C.-A.D. 9)."2 Likewise, few scholars side with Hu in upholding the traditional theory that the "Yang Chu" chapter embodies the teachings of Yang Chu 4 9 (440-360 B.C.?).28 However, Hu and Fung more or less agree on the late date of the Great Learning and the Doctrine of the Mean. Hu puts them in the fourth century B.C., "before Mencius and Hsiin Tzii."29 Fung places them about a century later.30 Hughes agrees with Hu on the date of the fourth century B.C. for the Great Learning but retains the traditional date of the fifth cen- tury B.C. for the Doctrine of the Mean.31 We need not go into the historical and literary arguments pro and con. But two significant points should be noted. One is that most scholars are agreed that the Great Learning is two or three hundred years later than the traditional date of the fifth century B.c. The other is that the Doctrine of the Mean is also considered later than the fifth century B.c., but there is a tendency to return to the traditional earlier date. (7) Confucius as a reformer. Since Fung dates the Lao Tzi~ after Confucius, he considers Confucius China's first philosopher and the first to write in a private capacity. As shown I Short History, p. 94.

Hughes, The Great Learning and The Mean-in-Action (New York: Dutton, 1943), pp. 99, 101.</page><page sequence="9">BASIC PROBLEMS IN THE STUDY OF CHINESE PHILOSOPHY 165 above, these assertions are not defensible. However, Fung has correctly appraised Confucius' position in Chinese history by pointing out that he was the first person to use the Six Disciplines (Book of Poetry, Book of History, Book of Changes, Book of Propriety, Spring and Autumn Annal, and Book of Music) to teach the common people,32 the first man in China to make teaching his profession and make education popular, the man who started the custom of traveling with students over many states to offer advice to rulers, the first to make a living only by teaching and not as a farmer, artisan, merchant, or official,33 the man who inaugurated, or at least developed, a class of gentlemen who were capable of only two kinds of activities, that of holding governmental office and that of teaching.34 In thus establishing Confucius' significant position in Chinese history, Fung has made an im- portant contribution. Hu's discovery of Confucius as a new type of ju has already been noted. To Fu Ssii-nien Z I IgFi (1896-1950), Confucius represents "the dawn of humanism." As Fu has shown, Confucius continued the ancient reverence for Heaven but at the same time laid increasing em- phasis on human motivation and human activities. He accentuated the transi- tion of the concept of Heaven as an anthropomorphic Lord to that of the Supreme Being or Reality in the sense of omnipresence and all-inclusiveness. And he modified the old belief in Fate as predeterminism to mean "waiting for the Mandate of Heaven," that is, as Mencius put it, "To await by culti- vating one's personal character is the way to fulfill the Mandate of Heaven."" In short, Confucius established the balance between Heaven and man.3" In the West, Creel has stirred up many critical comments, because in his Confucius, The Man and The Myth, he describes Confucius as a vigorous reformer and an arch democrat. The widespread criticism is not justified. Creel is not blind to the facts that "Confucius never directly denounced feudalism," that he "never for a moment suggested putting the government into the hands of the masses," that "he never stated the doctrine of the right of revolution as bluntly as Mencius did," that in the Confucian political program "good government still depended upon the ruler," and that in the Confucian system there was neither the "machinery by which it could com- pel the employment of the most capable" in the government nor an "effective way in which the whole people could influence the government."37 But since Confucius advocated "training in the art of government without regard " History, VoL I, p. 47. p Ibid., p. 50. 3* Ibid., p. 52. 5 Book of Mencius, Bk.

Although the radical divergence of the two Ch'?ng brothers (Ch'tng Hao -1., 1032-1085, and Ch'&amp;ng I f , 1033-1107), is well known, Fung is usually credited with being the one to have made a clear distinction be- tween them. This he has done, first, by regarding the two as having "initi- ated" two opposite schools and, second, by distinguishing them as the School of Mind (hsin-hsiieh , ) and the School of Principles (li-hsiieh 9 ), respectively.39 Some writers have objected on the ground that the two terms have been used by Neo-Confucianists interchangeably, that Chan Jo-shui 9~ Z-7k (1466-1560) definitely said that the study of t'ien-li X (natural principles) was hsin-hsiieh (the study of mind),"o and that Lu Hsiang-shan, the first great philosopher of the School of Mind, used the term "li-hsiieh" (the study of principles) '4 but he never once used hsin-hsiieh as a title. However, granting all this, there is no harm in making clear the distinction to bring out the parallel development of the Rationalistic and Idealistic Neo-Confucian movements. Besides these major controversies, arguments have raged around many lesser topics also, for example, the interpretation of chih in Kung-sun Lung (whether it means "marks" as insisted on by Hu or universals as understood by Fung), the question of who the Neo-Moists were (whether ascetics, pacifists, slaves, etc.), the relative importance of Tai Tung-yiian 9 WTM (1723-1777) (very important to Hu but not even mentioned in Fung's A Short History of Chinese Philosophy), and so forth. These ques- tions--and others-have not been settled; nor can they be settled without much further research. aIibid., pp. 152, 154, 168. 3 Short History, p. 281; History, VoL II, p. 500.
