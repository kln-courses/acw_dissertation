<plain_text><page sequence="1">67 FUNERARY EQUIPMENT FROM AGONA-SWEDRU, WINNEBAH DISTRICT; GOLD COAST. By CAPT. R. P. WILD, Inspector of Mines, Gold Coast. DUE credit must be given to Mr. D. N. Walker of the Gold Coast Political Service and Mr. L. J. Packham of the Department of Agriculture for their initiative in exploring an interesting site containing relics of a funerary character, thereby preserving some valuable anthropological specimens. The thanks of the writer must also be extended to Air. Walker for his efforts in collecting the information required to compile this account. At Mr. Walker's invitation the writer was able to pay a visit on 25th December, 1932, to the scene of the discoveries, which is situated in the Government residential area at Agona-Swedrul some fifteen miles north of Winnebah in the Gold Coast. During the process of levelling operations for the purpose of making a tennis court on top of a ridge, which had recently been cleared of forest, a great quantity of potsherds and many complete pottery objects were recovered from a depth varying from 9 to 12 inches. The ridge itself is narrow, about 200 yards wide, and flat topped. On one side, the south eastern, it slopes away more steeply towards the Agona-Swedru and Winnebah road. In the opposite direction Government bungalows have been erected, the intervening ground being retained for the tennis court. The soil in which the pots lay buried is composed for the most part of a black, loose loam, and in the absence of specific tests is presumed to be mixed with charcoal and ash. Some quartz grit is also present. So loose is the nature of the soil, that digging operations were being carried out with the aid of an ordinary gardener's fork. Beneath this top layer so prolific of pottery, at a depth of twelve inches there occurs a substratum of fine angular quartz grit which is entirely barren. Trenches had been dug across the tennis court for drainage at a depth of three feet, but after the first twelve inches no pottery was exposed. Pits put down elsewhere in the vicinity disclosed the same situation. At the bottom of these excavations the quartz grit had become more compact and difficult to dig. It was quite obviously undisturbed. This quartz is the residue, resulting from the disintegration in situ of an acid pegmatite or some granitic rock. It is probable that the other products formed by the decomposition 'Gold Coast Survey. Field Sheet 56. Scale 1: 62500.</page><page sequence="2">68 CAPT. R. P. WILD-Funerary Equipment from of the pegmatite were transported and deposited near Agona-Swedru to form a bed of clay, which local tradition claims to be the source from which the material was obtained for making the pottery. Though the boundaries of the area containing the pottery were not ascertained, more than one acre of ground had been tested and proved to be so prolific that the fork was bound to strike some fragment or complete object at each thrust, and yet no skeletal remains had been disclosed in spite of the statement of some non-local Africans that this place was a cemetery. The paucity of stone implements was also notable, one celt, one hammer and one hand-hammer being the only finds of this description so far. Beads are also remarkable for their absence, but in view of the lack of bones this is not astonishing. One piece of bone, probably human, was found by the writer in the quartz grit in a pit some seventy- five feet in a southerly direction from the southern end of the tennis court, but no pot. After a brief examination of the site, it soon became evident that the area in question was not a cemetery or burial ground. The state of the pottery objects, some of which are fairly recent and certainly less than a century old, does not permit sufficient time to allow for the dissolution of bones even under tropical conditions. Inquiries instituted locally by Mr. Walker among the Agona people elicited the fact that there was no burying in this particular area, but that the cemetery or " Samanpow " was situated in the vicinity of the present rest house, that is some 1,300 feet in a north- easterly direction from " the place of pots ". The evidence therefore points definitely to the existence at this particular spot, of an "Asensie " or place of pots, which is distinguished from the buLrial ground by the fact that no inhumation takes place in the former. (Mr. Walker informs me that in the Agona district the " Asensie " is known as the " Gsiebia ".) The " Asensie " or place of pots is described by R. S. Rattrayl in his " Religion and Art in Ashanti ". As the ceremonies connected with it are no longer practised by the Agona, a kindred tribe to the Ashanti, and also for the sake of accuracy, an extract taken verbatim from Rattray's work will best convey the real significance of this place. Whilst referring to the funeral rites of ordinary individuals in Ashanti, and after stating that a sheep is killed in front of the Sora2 hut with appropriate words, Rattray goes on to say that " Some of the meat of the sacrifice is cooked on the spot, and other food prepared in the utensils that had been placed at the Sora hut. A pot is now produced, the " Abusua kuruwa," i.e., the family pot. The pot generally has a lid or cover which has been fashioned to represent the dead; it has frequently also red and white and black stripes. All the blood relations of the deceased now shave their heads; this hair is placed in the pot. About sundown some of the women of the clan take the whole of the utensils from the Sora hut, the food and the " family pot " containing the hair, together with the remaining 'Rattray, R. S.

Here the mortar is set down, the cooking stones are set in position, the cooking pot placed upon them, with the strainer on top, and the " family pot " set down beside them. After a short speech informing the deceased that his funeral rites have finished, the mourners return to the Sora hut where the remainder of the villagers are awaiting them. The use of pots for ceremonial purposes in connection with the sacred grove at Santemanso in Ashanti described by Rattray1 may also be mentioned here. In this case a sacrifice is made to the spirits of the ancestors of the Ashanti men and women, " who came up from the ground at that spot ", i.e., the grove. Another interesting reference to the placing of pots for offerings to the spirits of the dead, apart from the graves, is given by Reindorf.2 In this case the account is of importance because it refers to a certain Nyako Ako, King (sic) of Agona, the country whose chief town is now Agona-Swedru, within a short distance of which these pottery objects, the subject of this article, were found. Reindorf states, " It is customary also before the funeral ceremony to make figures or statues of the deceased, either of clay or wood, which are placed under a shed outside the town and honoured by daily mea,t- offerings. But these meals are devoured by mice and lizards. Nyako objected to thus placing the statue of his mother and the meals on the road (? bushtrack); he said " Spirits are like winds, and therefore the spirit of my mother can enjoy the meal anywhere else than on the roads." He accordingly ordered wooden pegs to be fixed in a large silk-cotton- tree near the town, by means of which the tree could be ascended and the statue and meals placed on top of the tree. A sentry was appointed to stand by on top of the tree and cry to travellers passing by, " Wouldn't you look at the statue of Nyako Ako's mother ? " Hence when children are cross and trouble their mothers by crying, the mothers usually tell them " Mayest thou weep on and die, even if thou couldst do me once the honour of placing my statue and meal on a silk-cotton-tree." According to Reindorf it would appear that this incident occurred a short time previous to the year 1700. A further example which has been provided by a native of Enchi (Mr. Walker's boy), a tribe whose country is bordered by the French Ivory Coast, may be quoted as taken down. " I have seen those faces and figures (see Plate) at Dokabo, two miles from Tanosu, but they are large sized figures like people and show women conceiving. They are on an island in the Tano River and people say that long ago some people slept there on that piece of land before the river came, and when the River Tano did come the people were sleeping and were covered over, so all the people be stone (? pot). Now, if I go there I put threepence down and plenty of threepences are there. 'Rattray, R. S. " Ashanti." Ch. X. Oxford at the Clarendon Press. 1923. 2Reindorf, C. C.

WILD-Funerary Equipment from There is a big house like this bungalow (District Commissioner's bungalow, Agona- Swedru) too and plenty of stone people live inside." Is this a memorial to the people drowned in a sudden flood ? It will thus be seen that this cult is widely distributed. Some 130 miles separate Agona from Enchi in the West, whilst the Brong country of Northern Ashanti whence Dr. Rattray obtained his information is more than 150 miles to the North-west of Agona. The history of Agona-Swedru and its vicinity is obscure and the various native accounts tend to complicate matters. It appears, however, that this site was on a boundary line, a bone of contention in any case between the various tribes, and in consequence the ownership, or more properly the occupants, were continually changing during the vicissitudes of tribal wars. The evidence points definitely to a series of occupations by the Gomoa, the Agona, the Fanti and the Awutu (Obutu in Fanti) peoples, whoever were the strongest. At present the predominant tribe is the Agona, who permitted the Colonial Government to acquire recently that portion, where the pottery is found, for the purpose of making a residential area. The Gomoa are still living within two miles of the bungalows and even in 1932 made trouble with their hereditary foe, the Agona. It is more probable, however, that the earliest known occupants were the Awutu, the likelihood of which is borne out by the following statement partly transposed from the words of the present Odefey (sub-chief) of Awutu and his elders. "In the olden days the Senya, Winnebah, Awutu were all one (people), their land extended to Swedru. When the Agona 'pestered' the Gomoa, the latter called for aid from the Awutu, and the Awutu. including the royal (sic) household, stayed on the Government hill at Swedru. The Nos. 1 and 2 companies stayed at Asifo. The Gyasel defended the royal household. Our forefathers smoked long pipes, but the young men smoked short pipes2. Our ancestors never permitted scars on the face, but inter-marriage brought other tribes' customs. The Agona buried their dead with them on Government Hill. The Awutu, people also buried there, but the busts are of Agona origin and put there after the Awutu left." From the above account an interesting situation appears to have arisen. Not only did inter-marriage with an exchange of customs take place between the two tribes, but the dead of both were buried in the same cemetery, a practice which, according to one informant, was extended in the case of chiefs by erecting " shrines " in their honour, even when the chiefs were of the opposing party. The Awutu claim that they came via the sea from Benin, which is to the East (Awutu means " salt "), and having penetrated as far as Nsawam subsequently settled at Senya 1" G-yase Hene."-One of the more important officials in attendance at the court of a paramount chief, commanding the retainers and servants, Gyasefo. 2The Omanhene of Bekwai, Ashanti, has two pipes with stems over three feet in length.

They further claim that they arrived in the country before the Agona and the Gomoa. According to recent investigations the modern Awutu does not deal in pots and heads-at least this is the case with the Senya Awutu-but his ancestors did. From another source, possibly Gomoa, but this is uncertain, it is gathered that more thanl 300 years ago the inhabitants of Agona-Swedru were living where the Government has built bungalows for the Commissioner and European officials. Long before the war between the Fanti and Agona, the inhabitants moved to the present town and used their former place of residence as a cemetery (Asamanpow)l . During that time the cemeteries were groves which were not to be cultivated. The inhabitants continued burying there until the land was recently acquired by Government, about 1920. The place where the Government has made the rest-house is called Esuabirdu. It was the general meeting place where they met to discuss important matters. The fact that the Government was able to take over this land and develop it as a residential area suggests that the Agona had no very pious feelings towards the spirits of the dead which were buried there ; on the contrary it shows that some previous tribe, in all probability the Awutu, were the real spiritual possessors of the sacred areas. During the course of these investigations some interesting details concerning the customs of the natives of this part of the Gold Coast were obtained. The old village of Swedru, known as Efutu-Obir (Awutu-Obir)2, was on the present residential area. " Obir " is probably derived from the Awutu word, " Obire ", which means fetish and is also applied to the dead. The Gomoa fought with the Agona and forced the Agona to leave the village. This fight appears to have arisen because a certain Odikro (sub-chief), Kwow Tutu, had killed a man in the presence of the Omanhene (paramount chief) of Agona, Nyarko Kweku. Kwow Tutu according to local tradition had succeeded his brother, Entwi, who was a nephew of the first Odikro, Asumankuma. Apparently the Gomoa were not able to follow the Agona to the new village, which was across the river Akura, because they were unable to swim. In Efuto-Obir there were 77 quarters and the proper burial ground, Asamanpow, was to the left of the rest house. There was no burying on the residential area, i.e., the Asensie. The heads are an indication that an elderly (important) person had died and were made to resemble both sexes. A certain woman in Bobikuma, a neighbouring village, used to make these heads. She was called Sekyiwa and died about four years ago (1928). She was supposed to possess supernatural powers. She used to take some water in a brass pan and invoke the spirit of the deceased, which appeared in the water. The Swedru people marked their faces, but had no special marks, except in the 'Given by Mr. Walker as Asamanpow; Dr. Rattray writes Samanpow. Probably the A is elided by some Gold Coast tribes. 20ne rendering of Efutu is " mixed people ".</page><page sequence="6">72 CAPT. R. P. WILD-Funerary Equipment from case of slaves who were marked differently. From the great quantity of pottery scattered about this site only the more perfect specimens were selected, except in certain cases where it was thought desirable to illustrate some variety in design or decoration. With few exceptions the pottery is badly fired, the figurines especially so ; these are also distinctly crude. The paste was fairly fine, in no way comparable to the coarse red ware found associated with stone celts of pre-Akan origin and probably aboriginal. Further the latter was more highly decorated. The presence of mica in the pottery is very evident; this feature points to a pegmatitic or granitic source for the origin of the clay. There is very little coarse grit; whether the potters washed the clay before modelling or the clay was particularly free from grit has not been ascertained. Nearly all the objects are coated with the carbonaceous deposit, so characteristic of recent Gold Coast pottery, which is produced by a dense smoky fire subsequently to the real firing. There are however a very few which are red-brown in colour and harder in texture. The crudity of the heads suggests a slackening in the devotional duties of the people rather than a degeneracy in their art, which can achieve on occasions far better results than those illustrated here. The first head (Plate XII, a) is specially crude and gives the impression that any object approaching the semblance of the human form would suffice. The rendering of the hair in the second and third figures is similar to that which may be found on some Ashanti brass weights. The ringed neck motif may have been derived from the East, namely Benin, where high choked coral collars are so distinctive a feature of its famous bronze castings. This motif has also been adopted in the case of the tazza and vase (Plate XIII, a). In view of the statement that the Awutu came from Benin it is not too fantastic to attribute its employment to their influence. Another notable feature of these heads is the variety of the facial marks, which supports the probability that they are marks of adornment and not tribal. Under the right eye of No. 2, Plate XII, a, there appears a mark which among the Ashanti is known as the " cock's foot " and by them is considered to be a mark of adornment. Unfortunately the bases of the necks are all broken and it is impossible to say whether they terminated in a plain base, or were attached to the lid of the " Abusua kuruwa " or "family pot " as described by Rattray.1 From the method of arranging the hair of No. 1, it is considered that a female is intended. These small heads are called Otepo by the Awutu and Amaga by the Ewe. Plate XII, b, illustrates two jugs which appear to have European affinities. They recall to mind the " tiger-ware " jug of the middle 16th century. In view of the fact that an English metal ewer2 of the 14th century and a punch bowl of 1764 were obtained during 'See footnote2 on page 68. 2British Museum Quarterly :-Vol. VIII. No. 1. P. 52. 1933.</page><page sequence="7">Agona-Swedru, Winnebah District; Gold Coast. 73 the last Ashanti warl, this suggestion becomes almost a probability. The impressed circles may be an attempt to reproduce the mottlings of the tiger-ware. Again the "knop," though useless here, points to a derivation from a metal vessel of similar shape with a lid and of European provenance. The following dimensions may be of interest, but must be taken as only approximate owing to the irregularity of shape :-the height of No. 1, Plate XII, b, is 7 inches, diameter of rim 31 inches, diameter at shoulder 57 inches; of No. 2, Plate XII, b, height 6 inches, diameter of rim 31 inches, diameter at shoulder 53 inches. Plate XIII, a, shows what may be termed for convenience (1) a tazza, (2) a vase with ringed neck treatment. The lopsided character of the bowl of the tazza is obvious. Its height, base to rim, varies from 5 inches to 52 inches, and the diameter of the rim is approximately 6 inches. The vase has a rounded base, a height of 51 inches, and a rim diameter of 41 inches. Plate XIV, a, portrays three food pots. This type of vessel has been observed in use some eight years ago containing food' in a coffin at Obuasi in Ashanti. The average dimensions are as follows:- (1) Inside rim diameter-II inches. Height--1I inches. (2) ,, ,, ,, 3i inches. ,, 3 inches. (3) ,, ,, ,, 3j inches. ,, 37 inches. On Plate XIV, b, two dishes and a dish with a broken pedestal or shallow tazza are reproduced. Nos. 2 and 3 have rounded bases. They are entirely devoid of ornamentation. No. 1, the tazza, has an average inside rim diameter of 61 inches, No. 2, 6 inches, and No. 3, 4 inches. The rim in No. 3 is 3 inch wide. The ladles, Plate XIV, c, do not call for much comment, only No. 1 showing any decoration. The forked handle in No. 2 is of interest, as it is the only one found so far with this development. These ladles were employed for the purpose of serving the sacrifice or offering not only to the spirits of the dead but also to those persons who attended the ceremony and who partook of the food provided. Two handles and a pipe are illustrated on Plate XIV, d. The handles have been broken off some dish or bowl. Unfortunately no complete object furnished with these handles was discovered up to the date when these objects were collected. The pipe bowl represents some difficulty, as the writer knows of two of this shape which were discovered in Ashanti; one was discovered in 1925, together with an ancient pot, at a depth of 15 feet in an alluvial deposit, whilst the other was turned up at a depth of some 4 feet during the excavation for the foundations for the extension of the Kumasi Post Office. This type of pipe-bowl differs considerably from those made in modern times by the Ashanti, who produced elaborate bowls with highly decorative and in some instances anthropomorphic designs.2 From their shape and the conditions under which they were found they have Cf. also the bronze ewer of the time of Richard II, figured in the Mediaeval Guide.-B.M. 2Rattray, R.

If this was so, then the presence of this pipe points to a survival from an earlier culture, of which there is ample evidence in the Gold Coast. The present state of our knowledge of the pre-history of this region prevents any definite statement being made. Figure 1 probably portrays the most important specimen from this area. It was badly broken but the fragments collected were sufficient to enable a good reconstruction FIG. 1.-PEDESTAL BOWL FROM AGONA-SWEDRU, GOLD COAST. drawing to be made by Miss F. Tomkins, of Cheltenham, to whom the writer is greatly indebted. In appearance the object resembles an elaborate tazza, a dish or bowlsupported on a central pedestal, from near the base of which spring four curved members which extend to the rim. The crudeness of the modelling is well brought out in the reproduction. This design has not been recorded hitherto from the Gold Coast or Ashanti. The decora- tion is confined to a simple ribbed moulding, which is continued along the outward faces of the four curved supports. From the data collected in the vicinity of Agona- Swedru, it appears that this particular design indicates the death in war of an Awutu, and before being placed in position on the surface of the ground it was covered with white</page><page sequence="9">Agona-Swedru, Winnebah District; Gold Coast. 75 clay. Other pottery utensils found include plates, covers, a water bottle with a broken neck (Kuruwa ?), and a fragment with some holes' in it which may be part of an incense burner or a strainer.2 The largest fragment discovered was the base of some pedestalled object, which was 9- inches in diameter and varied in thickness from 14 inches to 2 inches. It may be as well to mention here that there is a custom prevailing among certain sections of the Gold Coast people, which requires the widow to break any pottery articles which she may have used during the funerary rites; it is therefore quite conceivable that the enforcement of this rule may account for the great quantity of sherds which occur at the " Asensie " of Agona-Swedru. *The pottery described in this article has been presented to the Department of Oriental Antiquities and of Ethnography at the British Museum.
