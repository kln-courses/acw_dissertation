<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE KIVA, Vol. 52, No. 4, 1987 DRESS AND ADORNMENT OF THE PUEBLO INDIANS MATILDA COXE STEVENSON Bureau of American Ethnology Smithsonian Institution Edited by RICHARD V. N. AHLSTROM and NANCY J. PAREZO Dress has always been an important feature with all people, as shown by tradition and through excavations of graves and other depositories for objects associated with the dead. Ancient peoples, like those of today, look to the decorative as well as to the practical side of clothing. While the dress of more enlightened people bears little or no significance further than utility and the artistic, that of aboriginal peoples is governed by certain set rules, from the arranging of the hair to the moccasins on the feet; and from primitive dress and utensils have sprung the arts and crafts of civilization. The people of the chase learned to dress hides, making some beautifully white and pliable. They learned to color them red and black with vegetable dyes, and they learned to decorate these skins in commemoration of great battles and feats of the victor and in symbols of their beliefs. Here may be found the origin of painting, which has grown and grown, developing into the work of the great master painters. Had there never been paintings such as referred to, would there have been a Raphael or Murillo? Skins were made into daily wearing apparel for men and women and also into ceremonial robes and other religious paraphernalia. Deer skins were too warm to be worn with comfort in the southern climate, and so the people of the south separated bark into strips, which they fashioned into deep fringes, that served for skirts, the remainder of the body being bare. It was discovered that the inner bark of trees and the leaves of plants could be separated and so prepared that they could be twisted and made into threads and woven into nets and cloth. Existence of prehistoric textiles woven, braided, and netted of feathers, cotton, milkweed, yucca, and other fibers, hair, and wool, especially that of the buffalo, from the Atlantic to the Pacific, is attested by examples that have been found widespread in fragments in the once populated but now deserted mounds and villages. In addition, the early explorers of the country found the natives using netting and cloth of various textures. The writer does not attempt to cover the field of textiles employed by the aborigines of the United States but merely to touch upon the materials, both ancient and modern, as found in the different sections of the country to show 275</page><page sequence="2">276 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON how generally these fabrics were produced and in use. Though much has been written regarding the textile art of the North American Indian, the information is very scattered. [Editors note: The following portion of the manuscript, not included in this printing, is a region-by-region survey of the "textile art" of Indian peoples of the United States and adjacent areas of Canada. Next comes a section titled "Pueblo Tribes," which begins with two subsections- also omitted here-on archaeological objects ("Description of Textile Remains") and ethnohistoric evidence ("Development of Dress and Adornment"). The third subsection, "Pueblo Dress," begins the material presented below.] PUEBLO DRESS At the time the writer first visited the Pueblo country in 1879 as a guest of Mr. Stevenson's expedition to Zuni, the manufacture of cotton embroidered ceremonial blankets, dance kilts and sashes of the same material, white cotton blankets with red and blue borders, worn principally by women, women's black diagonal cloth dresses and wraps of same, and women's belts was a great industry among the Hopi Indians. The trading of these articles to all the Pueblo tribes from Taos to Isleta dates so far back there there is no knowledge handed down of the timn when the Hopi goods were first introduced among the other Pueblos. The Zuni, too, although perhaps their trading was not to be mentioned in comparison with that of the Hopi, carried the women's dresses, wraps, and belts to Taos and the other villages. Though the Santa Clara and San Ildefonso Indians insist that the only weaving ever done by their people is that which one or two of their men have recently attempted after being instructed by other pueblos, Mr. Hodge of the Bureau of American Ethnology found evidence in the floor of a kiva in the ruins at El Rito de los Frijoles, the home of these people, that a loom had been in use there. And although the people of Taos also claim that they never made textiles, they too may have been weavers, but the writer is inclined to the belief as expressed by the Taos Indians. The Laguna and Acoma did make blankets to some extent- and pehaps the Pecos, Sia, Jemez, and other Pueblos were adept in weaving, long ago. The Tesuque claimed in 1879 that the dresses that were elaborately embroidered in dark blue and red were of native weaving and embroidery. The Zuni were great weavers of cotton, milkweed (Acerates angustifolia), yucca, and other fibrous plants in their day, making use of the inner bark of red cedar and other barks for decorating the fabrics. They also wove the wool of buffalo and other animals. (The weaving of strips of rabbit skins into robes was an industry among the Hopi and Zuni Indians and perhaps other Pueblos, but there have not been any of these blankets made since Zuni was visited in 1879, to the writer's knowledge, though these robes were in common use at that time,</page><page sequence="3">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 277 Figure 1.

The Zuni did not invent dyes to any extent until the introduction of sheep by the Spaniards; then it was that they wove their symbols in their blankets. They were, however, quite willing to trade their turquoise (turquoise mines being accessible to the Zuni) to the Hopi for ceremonial blankets, kilts, and sashes and later to trade for the elaborate Navaho blanket. They clung, however, to the weaving of dresses, wraps, belts, the white, red, and blue bordered ceremonial blanket, men's shirts, breech cloths, and kilts. Whenever a Zuni matron or maiden appeared in a Hopi dress or wrap, or in the red and blue bordered blanket of the Hopi, it evidenced that she could afford to attire herself in an imported garment, and to the present time, the Zuni woman is careful to expose the white line drawn midway across her Hopi blanket wrap (the weaver always marks his blanket with this line upon its completion)--just as a civilized woman exposes the markings on her India shawl. The statements of the Spanish invaders regarding Pueblo dress cannot be accepted without question. The writer doubts if the women ever wore garments reaching to the ground, as has been stated. Had such garments been in vogue, the deerskins that are wrapped round and round the legs would have been much in the way, and there is every evidence that this particular style of wrapping the legs is remote and has the same effect to diminish the size of the feet as the operating and bandaging done by the Chinese. She is positive that the Pueblo women did not go in a state of nakedness as claimed by some Spanish explorers, as this would have been in direct contradiction to their philosophy. HAIR DRESSING The Hopi maidens at the present time arrange their hair in wheel fashion either side of the head (Figure 1). Matrons separate their hair across the head down the back and wrap it with yarn on either side of the head and to the fore part, so that the hair hangs in front instead of back of the.shoulders. In both cases the forehead is exposed. The Zuni style of hair dressing is altogether different, and there is no distinguishing style between the hair of the young child and that of the old woman. The hair is parted in a sort of oval at the back of the head (the apex being at the crown), and a portion of the front hair hangs forward to the line between the lips and is brought to one side with the fingers. However, the eyes are always covered in the dance. Figure 2 gives a clear illustration of the hair put aside. The Zuni say a woman's face should not be gazed upon by men, and so the hair serves the purpose of the oriental veil, and the remainder falls at the sides, and the back hair is done up in a cue and wrapped with a woven garter. The Pueblo women do up one another's hair, and the women are the hairdressers to the men, except rarely when a groom shows the bride marked attention by doing her hair. The Zuni declare that they never wore the hair in a</page><page sequence="5">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 279 Figure 2.

(In 1880 the writer observed a number of Taos girls with their hair done up in the Hopi fashion; the girls also had a disk of vermilion painted on each cheek.) The Tewa, Sia, and other Pueblo women cut the hair across the eyes; a portion of the hair falls either side of the head, and the remainder is done up in a cue or bow at the back of the head. The Zuni men cut the hair across the eyes, the hair falls to the neck at the sides, and the remainder is made into a bow wrapped with a green and red garter. (A Zuni man never wears a cue as some of the other Pueblo men do, and women never wear their hair in a bow.) A banda wrapped Turkish fashion around the head or a kerchief keeps the hair back from the face. While the Taos and Tewa Indians usually wear their hair parted over the head and done in two rolls or plats more or less elaborately ornamented with strips of skins, ribbons, or yarn, they must always go back to the original style of bangs and bow at the back of the head, during the autochthonic ceremonials [that is, kiva ceremonies]. The head band is never used in these ceremonies. The conservative Indian seldom cuts his hair more than to trim it. The mask of a man having short hair at his death is not buried with him, and therefore he is debarred from joining in the dances with the gods. While some of the returned students are satisfied to have their hair remain short, many of them let the hair grow and thereby keep the good will of their elders. ORIGINAL DAILY DRESS The original daily dress of the Pueblo men, according to the statement of aged men and women made to the writer in 1879, was long leggings of buckskin; an overlegging reaching up to the knee formed of a straight piece of skin wrapped around the leg and held on by a woven garter below the knee; deerskin moccasins; a shirt of deerskin, or of native woven cotton, wool, or fiber; woven breech cloths of cotton or wool; and a woven garter, usually cotton, to wrap the back of the hair. The shirt sleeve was left open in the morning from the wrist up and afterwards tacked together a portion of the way. The woman's dress consisted of one piece sewed together at the ends and worn over the right shoulder and under the left arm, an opening being left for the arm, and the ends falling over the arm (Figure 2); this blanket was usually cotton or fiber. (The writer has never been able to learn that the Zuni women ever wore their blankets fastened on their left shoulder [from earlier in MS].) (The Zuni claim that the embroidered designs on their cotton fabrics were made with thread of the inner bark of trees before they had dyes. The early Spanish records tell of men of Cibola weaving an embroidered garment resembling a napkin.) The Zuni have no record of the women having buckskin dresses,</page><page sequence="7">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 281 though no doubt skins were made use of before the invention of weaving, which invention must date back for centuries. The dress was held into the waist by a long cotton belt wound round and round. The ancient style of Pueblo woman's dress never changed in shape after the introduction of woven cotton garments. They wore the same moccasin and legging that are in style at Zuni at the present day. Adornments included beads fashioned from sea shells, secured on the Pacific Coast or by trading, made into small disks (the smaller and thinner the more valuable were the beads); disk and cylindrical beads of black stone, which were highly prized; coral from Mexico; and disks and beads of turquoise from the mines in New Mexico. (The more northern Pueblo tribes were dependent upon the mines now known as Los Cerillos and at present owned by The Tiffany Co., but the Zuni had in addition turquoise mines to the southwest of them--which mines are seldom visited at the present time, so fearful are the Zuni that they will become known to the white man.) Irregular pieces of turquoise were also attached to the necklace-the larger the piece the more prized. The disk shaped beads were used for earrings, being strung and the string doubled; the lower end held one, two, or three red stones greatly prized by these Indians. (These stones are no longer secured, and the projections from the homey oyster, or bits of shell artificially colored red, are used in the modem necklaces, but they have never been observed on the earrings.) The writer secured one turquoise bead of fine color, cylindrical in shape, and 34 inches in length from a ruin near Zuni, and a light green stone bead about the same size as the blue from a sacred spring in the Zuni country. A string of saucer-shaped shell beads from a sacred spring near Zuni Salt Lake, 65 miles south of Zuni, was the prized possession of a Zuni rain priest. The Zuni have copper near them, but the present generation, at least, knows nothing of this. When a Zuni Indian discovered copper in his country some years since, the writer was taken into his confidence, and she had specimens examined by Dr. Merrill of the U.S. National Museum. He pronounced the ore to be of very high grade. The Zuni declare that metal working came to them from the Spaniards, and there is certainly no evidence that these people worked in copper or silver previous to the Conquest. A new era dawned upon the Pueblos with the introduction of sheep by the Spaniards. They invented dyes and wove elaborate designs in men's blankets. The cotton dresses of the women were supplanted by others woven of wool. While the Hopi retained their way of weaving designs to form the border of the woolen dress, the Zuni exercised their skill with the needle and embroidered their dresses and wool kilts top and bottom (Figure 2); wool belts of color took the place of the cotton belt woven by the women (Figure 3a and b). Both the Zuni and Hopi added a border on both ends of the small cotton ceremonial blankets usually worn by the women, and they embellished the larger cotton</page><page sequence="8">282 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON a c b Figure 3.

They also learned the use of the knitting needle from the Spaniards. Silversmiths sprung up who imitated the Spanish workers, and with their crude forges, bellows, crucibles, and dyes they fashioned beads, buttons, crescents, crosses, bangles, finger rings, and other ornaments. ZUNI DRESS IN 1879 In 1879 the Pueblo men were wearing loose cotton trousers and cotton or calico shirts (which had long since supplanted the native dress), which fell over the trousers, and were frequently confined at the waist by a leather belt strung with silver medallions of native workmanship (Figure 5). Some of the men who were more fond of dress added a ruffle to the bottom of the shirt. The trousers were made of two straight pieces of unbleached cotton (white cotton being reserved for ceremonial purposes) slit on the outer side at the bottom for some ten inches (Figure 6). These straight pieces could not be closed at the top, and the breech cloth protected the person. The shirt sleeves were also minus a gusset</page><page sequence="9">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 283 Figure 4.

A footless stocking knit of native blue yam was worn, as well as a buckskin moccasin with rawhide sole. The moccasin reached a little above the ankle and fastened on the outer side with one or more silver buttons--the foot being first wrapped in old cloth in cold weather. The moccasins were brown, red, or black; occasionally they were uncolored. A simple legging of buckskin colored to match the moccasin was wrapped around the leg, reaching to the knee; the outer side was lined with silver buttons, by those able to bear the expense, and held on by a red garter bordered with green and designs of white, fringed at the ends. This garter was tied on the outside of the leg just below the knee, and the fringed ends fell. The hair was done up in a bow at the back of the head and wrapped with a red garter. The hair at the sides fell to the neck, and that in front was banged across the face. The bangs were held back from the face by a silk band wrapped Turkish fashion about the head, or a silk handkerchief that was folded. The ornaments consisted of silver hoop earrings and necklaces of corals and white shell beads, turquoises, ar other stones. The greater the wealth, the greater display of necklaces. Quite frequently a leather bow wristlet or- namented with silver was seen on the wrist. A blanket completed the daily costume. The style, when out of doors, was to almost cover the face with the blanket that wrapped around the head as well as body and limbs. (While many possessed the much envied Navaho blanket, others wore the native Pueblo striped blanket. A few had American blankets of red, blue, or black, obtained from the traders). Undressed sheepskin with the wool inside was made into shoes for cold and stormy weather, the Indians being careful not to expose their moccasins to rain, mud, or snow. The summer costume of the older men frequently consisted of the breech cloth and a shirt. The full dress consisted of buckskin knee pants lined on the outer side with silver buttons, leggings of the same, ornamented with silver buttons, and native blue woven shirt. The women wore a white or unbleached cotton garment made of two widths of cotton, the seam on one side being sewed complete while on the other it was left open for a short distance from the top ends, the top being fastened together. The right arm passed through the opening, the garment passing under the left arm, falling below the knees. A second garment was of calico, high necked and long sleeved. The sleeves were full, and the neck and wrist were finished with a straight band and buttoned with a silver button. The outer dress worn over this combination shirt and skirt was of native diagonal cloth in black, bordered top and bottom in dark blue with few exceptions. The sides were joined with red yam (Figure 2). Red was introduced in the embroidery of the dresses of the Acoma, Laguna, and Tesuque women. The Zuni embroidered their dresses as of old, in dark blue. In contrast, the borders of the Hopi women's dresses were woven in. The dresses are woven in a single piece, each corner being finished with a tassel. The seam is on the right side, and, as in the</page><page sequence="12">286 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON white undergarment, an opening is left for the arm. Several inches are sewed together on the top of the blanket, which allows a dropping shoulder or arm piece with tassels, on the right side. The left side of the garment passes under the left arm. A belt of native manufacture (Figure 3a), three or four yards long, and fringed, one end having a much deeper fringe than the other, was wrapped around the waist, the woman being careful to draw the belt tightly, fastening it at the left side with a tuck-in, allowing the long fringe to hang. In summer the feet and legs were often bare. The poorer class of elderly women occasionally appeared in the white undergarment in warm weather, leaving the neck and arms exposed. The moccasins and leggings represented a whole deerskin; the larger the legging wrappings the more elegant the moccasins. The women also wore the footless stocking, and they also had knit shoes reaching above the ankles, which were worn for undress in cold weather. A necklace of silver beads with a crescent pendant symbolizing the world, bangles, and a silver ring or two was the only jewelry worn by the women except when dressed for ceremonials. The hair was woven as previously described, and with a twirl of the finger the woman or girl would place the hair behind the ear,making a rough part on the side of the head. The cue was wrapped with a red garter. A straight piece of calico or cotton was tied lengthwise at the upper ends in front and fell over the shoulders, and a fancy shawl or piece of silk covered the cotton piece on special occasions. A Pueblo woman or child would no sooner appear without this piece-except in certain ceremonials-than a civilized woman would leave off her dress. In cold weather or on formal occasions a mantle of diagonal cloth embroidered on the sides and worn over the head completed the Zuni woman's dress. The little boys and girls over five or six years dressed exactly like their elders, including the arrangement of the hair, except for the silver ornaments- though the girls were sometimes the happy possessors of a string of silver beads. The younger children were usually provided with a little calico shirt and moccasins for the winter, going entirely nude in the warm weather. The little tots often had moccasins at an early age before there was any thought of them wearing other clothing in summer. The infant was wrapped in a piece of cloth and strapped to the cradle. The infant's arms were close to its sides, but the cloth always separated the arms from the body, so as to prevent chaffing. The Zuni men were doing all the knitting and most, if not all, sewing with the needle in 1879, and to the present time women have not used knitting needles. Both men and women, after the latter began the use of the sewing needle, sewed away from instead of toward themselves. The women made a fine plaiting of double calico to adorn the neck and wristband of their shirts, which were fastened at the neck and wrists with native silver buttons. The next step toward development in dress was the introduction of gussets in the trousers and shirt sleeves. Then came the universal wearing of the</page><page sequence="13">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 287 Figure 6. Zuni man in everyday dress of 1879. [standing next to an eagle cage.

No. 2832.] commercial shirt whenever a man could save the means to purchase one; a little later the vest and trousers came into favor, though for a period of some years many adhered to the loose cotton trousers, and even four years ago they were to be seen on a few of the older men. The present sun priest of Zuni, who has filled that office for many years, and other rain priests, still wear the cotton trousers. The Navajo are such close neighbors of the Pueblos, some of them at least, and their arts and crafts so allied that a few remarks upon the dress of these Indians will not be amiss. These people wore the dress of the Pueblo, except that the woman's dress was bordered top and bottom in bayeta, was of two pieces instead of one and caught on both shoulders, and was longer. Also, their silver jewelry was more elaborate, no doubt because the Navajo were and are the greatest native silversmiths in the Southwest, having learned this craft, as they did blanket weaving, from the Pueblos.</page><page sequence="14">288 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON Figure 7.

No. 87-5566.] CEREMONIAL DRESS AND ADORNMENT OF THE PUEBLOS The ceremonial dress of the Pueblos consists of a white cotton blanket embroidered top and bottom in black, green, and yellow, symbolizing but- terflies, rain clouds, and the faces of the rain-makers; white cotton kilts embroidered at either end in the same colors; sashes of wool or cotton embroidered at the ends in green, red, and black with fringe, and usually with a band of red flannel crossing the top of the fringe; white cotton sashes, more of a beading than a weave, with long knotted fringe, the knots being filled in with corn husks symbolizing the fructification of the earth (Figure 7a); white cotton blankets bordered top and bottom with a woven band in red and blue wool; buckskin kilts decorated in sun and moon symbols and snakes, with the fringe of the same usually tipped with conical bits of tin; cotton stockings in open-work design, introduced by Mexicans; white commercial cotton shirts;</page><page sequence="15">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 289 black woven wool shirts of native manufacture formerly in everyday use; moccasins of a fancy design, colored in blue-green, with anklets embroidered in black and white porcupine quills, or in colored yams; white buckskin leggings extending from the thigh to the ankle, fringed on the outside, formerly in everyday use; and a black woven breech cloth, sometimes embroidered at the ends, sufficiently wide to form a sort of kilt that is pulled through the belt string. The women wear the ordinary black woven dress--embroidered in blue with the long, red, woven belt wrapped round and round their waist-much more frequently than they wear the white embroidered blanket. A white cotton blanket bordered in red and blue is fastened at the upper corners and falls over the shoulders (Figure 4). They wear white, dressed deerskin moccasins, each one composed of a half of a large skin, which is wrapped around the leg to the knee forming a huge legging (Figure 2); the soles are black and highly polished. The women as well as the men wear white embroidered blankets and sashes. Men representing certain goddesses have their hair parted over the head and done up on the sides over small forms of board made for the purpose. (This style of hair dressing may be a survival of the wheel as worn by the Hopi maidens.) These bows are wrapped with yam. The face is covered with a mask. Buckskin armlets colored blue-green with banded turkey feathers attached by buckskin thongs are worn by many personators of anthropic gods. Spruce twigs adorn the waist, arms, wrists, and ankles and also the base of masks, and are often carried in the hands of the dancers. Feathers, especially the fluffy eagle feather, and parrot plumes form an important adjunct to ceremonial costumes. Rattles of gourd with pebbles introduced are carried in the hand of the dancer and tortoise shells with deer toes attached are worn at the back of the right leg below the knee by personators of anthropic gods. The Zuni have an infinite variety of masks, one of the most elaborate being that worn by the Shalako. The Hopi rank next to the Zuni, the Sia next, in elaborate masks. The Keres people also have many masks. The people of Taos and Isleta declare that they have no masks. The band of Laguna who are living at Isleta, having separated from the people some years ago because of the progressive element, continue their ceremonies wearing masks, undisturbed in the kivas of the Isleta. Adornment Elaborate necklaces of white shell beads in disk form, many of them as thin as paper, strung with blue and green turquoises, corals, and red stones are worn. This necklace is known as the k6hakwa (white shell) mother of the Sun father and is specially sacred to the pueblos who are so fortunate as to possess them. According to Zuni record the perfect blue and green turquoise are male, the off-color female (Stevenson 1904:58). But few of these rare old necklaces are seen at the present time except in the Zuni ceremonials, when certain fetishes</page><page sequence="16">290 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON are hidden from view by wrappings of these treasures, and men and women are adorned with them. (These necklaces and earrings are the property of the men, descending from father to elder son, who may wear them at any time, but they are worn by women only when taking part in ceremonials.) The entire breast is sometimes covered with these beads, the display depending upon the number of necklaces in the possession of the family of the dancer and his intimates. Two red homey oyster shells (Spondylus calcifer Lam.) set in turquoise and worn pendant to the necklaces by personators of certain of the Council of Gods were in the possession of the Zuni from early times until the writer secured one of these for the U.S. National Museum. The Hopi in 1882 had a considerable number of these necklaces, the Queres [Keres] had some, but there are few if any among the other Pueblos. The Zuni have a few strings of archaic white and black stone beads that are highly valued. A rare necklace of saucer-shaped shells, discovered in a sacred spring some 50 miles south of Zuni and formerly in the possession of the high priest of Zuni, now belongs to Dr. Sofie Nordoff-Jung, and through her courtesy the writer has been allowed to illustrate this rare specimen. [Editor's note: Stevenson's figure was not located; the necklace does, however, appear with other pieces of jewelry in a photograph, Negative No. 87-5565, Smith- sonian Institution.] The Zuni also wear many native silver and coral necklaces; the older coral beads were secured from Mexico, the modem through the American traders. (Since the introduction by traders of the celluloid imitation coral beads, the Indians will not purchase coral before testing its genuineness by burning beads, the white ashes proving them to be coral.) The Zuni earrings are composed of a double string or loop of turquoise beads, which are disk-shaped, bored through the center, and tipped with several bits of red or pink stones. They are worn in the ears only for ceremonials; at other times they are attached pendant to the necklaces. The Hopi men wear similar earrings, but those of the women are turquoises set in wood tablets with pifion gum. A bit of abalone shell is sometimes seen as the centerpiece of the mosaic. These too are worn only on ceremonial occasions. It is usual for the other Pueblo women to wear the Zuni style of earrings. A certain dried berry and black and white grains of corn are strung and worn over the shoulder and across the breast. Shell Bead Making The process of bead making is tedious; shells are broken into bits, and each piece is rubbed on a stone slab until it is of the desired thinness. The more delicate the bead the more valuable it is. (The work of the present time is far inferior to the old. The present beads could not be passed for the old to those familiar with this work.) After each bit is passed through the rubbing process, it</page><page sequence="17">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 291 is laid to one side until there are enough pieces for a string of beads; then the boring is begun. As each stone is pierced, it is usually slipped on a string for safe keeping until the boring is completed. Then the irregular pieces are rubbed separately on the stone, to form them into symmetrical disks less than one-eighth of an inch in diameter. From four to six strings form a necklace. The beads never reach within a finger's length to the end of the string, which is made at the present time of ravelings of bleached or unbleached cotton twisted into a substantial cord. Making of modem beads from olivette and clam shells is quite an industry with the Zuni, who sell the necklaces much doctored, not only to tourists but to their Indian neighbors for good sums. The Navaho are the best patrons for the modem necklaces, as they were for the older beads, frequently getting possession of the latter by questionable means. They secure the necklaces at any price, and the Zuni are known to be close bargainers, feeling genuine pride in wearing them until the whiskey craze takes possession, when a string of modern beads for which the owner would ask three or four ponies goes for a drink of whiskey. Silver Ornaments Silver ornaments were introduced after the Spaniards brought coin into the country. Beads, finger rings, and bangles, which were the first articles made of silver, are especially in view in ceremonials, though they are to be seen at other times. The silver necklaces are for women and girls, but men frequently wear them. After a time the beads were interspersed with small Latin crosses, and a double cross tipped with the "sacred heart" formed a pendant to the chain. This style of ornament was a favorite in Mexico, and there are still fine specimens to be seen there. The crescent as the world symbol was introduced later. The silver squash blossom was a more recent achievement in the sil- versmith's art. Plain convex buttons of various sizes have been in use for many years, but the fluted button made of United States coin (quarters, half dollars, and dollars) beaten and chiseled was the handy work of the Navaho in the late seventies. Leather bow wristlets are ornamented with silver, and leather belts for men are strung with heavy, elaborate silver medallions; bridles are often quite covered with silver. The first setting of turquoise in silver occurred about 1880 done by a Navaho, in a ring, which he presented to the writer. Later on the crescents were set with turquoise. The Navaho became much interested in the setting of stones, and the Zuni followed after them. Both tribes have produced most interesting specimens, the Navaho, however, excelling the Zuni in originality of design. [A figure not located] shows the first brooch with pin and clasp made by the Navaho. A beautiful specimen of a silver comb made by the Navaho silversmith without any design other than an inspection of the teeth of a commercial comb is in the National Museum. The furnace, bellows, crucibles,</page><page sequence="18">292 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON dies - in fact everything pertaining to the workshop of the silversmith- were of home manufacture in 1879, except the old Mexican blow pipes and carpenters files and hammers. Coin is cut into bits and melted in pottery crucibles and run into a mold, the form depending upon what is to be made. For a bangle the silver is formed into a slender rod that is hammered into shape and decorated with a file after patterns made by the silversmith; each style of button has its particular mold. The Mexican dollar, owing to its purity, is employed by the silversmith in preference to the silver dollar of the United States. The Navaho were the first to doctor the silver with a white metal introduced by traders, and the Zuni were not slow to follow. A heavy copper wire introduced by American traders was worked to some extent by the Navaho, but it never found favor with the Zuni. MANUFACTURE OF FABRICS Cotton It will be noticed in the foregoing pages [not included here] that the Spanish accounts of cotton growing among the Pueblo people are quite contradictory, one writer declaring that much cotton was grown in the Tusayan district, while others declare that these people had but little cotton. The writer must draw her conclusions from the statements of the Pueblos themselves. When the writer first visited the Southwest in 1879, the Hopi were the only Pueblos raising cotton, and they did not raise it to any considerable extent, but at that time had sufficient for making their bridal robes and other blankets and sashes, and also a surplus for trading to other Pueblo tribes. But commercial cotton yam had crept in even at this early day, and they were weaving some of their sacred blankets of it. These blankets have been made from time immemo- rial by the Zuni and Hopi Indians, but some years since the Zuni relinquished this art almost entirely to the Hopi, as they gave up their blanket weaving of elaborate design to the Navaho. This cotton blanket is always presented to the Hopi bride by her husband; it is woven by the father of the groom, provided he is a priest. Otherwise, the father employs a priest to make the blanket. This weaving is always done in the kiva (estufa). A year after the marriage, or after the birth of the first child, the woman returns the blanket to the father-in-law, who embroiders it. (The embroidery stitch of the Pueblos is always a long stitch on the outside of the fabric with a short one on the under side. Each stitch is taken with great precision.) Then it is again given to the woman, who, however, does not wear the blanket herself, unless in some special ceremony, but the husband makes use of it in ceremonials associated with anthropic [that is anthropomorphic] worship. At her death, the blanket is buried with her. These blankets were also made for exportation, and, like all other woven fabrics made</page><page sequence="19">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 293 by the Hopi, were traded to all Pueblos from Taos in the far north of New Mexico to Isleta in the south to be worn in their most sacred ceremonies. The writer observed the preparing of cotton for the loom at the Hopi village of Shimopavi in 1882. This ceremony, which is strictly religious, must be performed with many prayers. A piece of white commercial cotton cloth was spread upon the floor in the chamber of the high priest (head rain priest) and a disk-shaped bed of sand was laid upon the cotton cloth (Figure 7b). Several men headed by the high priest took seats around the sand bed and immediately began to pray. (If possible the high priest is always present upon this important occasion.) In a short time two men appeared bringing a dressed deerskin with a painting of the sun in the center, the disk being about 24 inches in diameter. The face of the sun shield was as usual blue-green, having three parallelograms in black denoting eyes and mouth. This disk was encircled with yellow, blue- green, red, and black, the first three colors denoting the sun's rays, the black symbolizing the path of the rain clouds around the world. Parallel lines in the four colors extended out from the painting at four points equally distant; each group of lines was tipped with a white fluff eagle plume. The painting was gently deposited upon the sand bed, where it remained while a long prayer was offered by the high priest and was responded to by the others in tones too low to be heard by the writer. After the prayer, each one seated around the painting sprinkled it with sacred meal and, drawing his hand to his mouth, inhaled the sacred breath from the living god, as it were, for the sun father was supposed to be present in spirit in the shield. The painting was again sprinkled with sacred meal, when it was gently lifted and returned to its resting place by the men who brought it. The process of manipulating the cotton then began. A white cloth contain- ing cotton pods was deposited by the sand bed, and each man of the circle began picking the cotton and placing it on the bed. The picked cotton (Figure 7c) was patted with a willowy rod, some two and a half feet in length, with five fingers or prongs wrapped securely to it. Great care has to be observed in the patting of the cotton, for the slightest carelessness will cause it to fly. The process is most fatiguing, owing to the peculiar motion of the arm. The better part of a day was required to prepare but a small quantity of cotton for the spindle. Then the spinning began. The process was the same as the spinning of wool; a spindle provided with a whorl was employed. Mr. Stevenson secured specimens employed in the process, which were deposited in the U.S. National Museum. Figure 7 is from a photograph of the same enclosed in glass. As noted earlier, the knots at the top of the fringe in the sash (Figure 7a) are filled in with balls of corn husks symbolic of bountiful crops. The Zuni practice the same process as the Hopi in preparing cotton for spinning, except that they do not observe any ceremony further than to pray much of the time that they are separating the cotton.</page><page sequence="20">294 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON The original spindle of the Pueblos was made of white cedar and had no whorl. Its length was from the tip of the thumb to the tip of the middle finger with the fingers extended, and the five fingers crosswise. This stick was manipulated with the hand, it being caught with the four fingers on the far side and the thumb on the near side, the hand being over the stick. The stick was revolved back and forth with the right hand, while the cotton bands or ropes were managed with the left hand. (The writer secured a primitive spindie with a quantity of thread upon it [Figure 7d?].) The Zuni declare that their principal fabric for dress was cotton before the introduction of sheep by the Spaniards, and since that time they gradually gave up the weaving of cotton into garments, preferring to purchase from the Hopi. The Zuni say that they brought two kinds of cotton seeds--those of the larger pod, Gossypium hirsutum or G. mexicanum, and those of the smaller pod, hdwdtse/i or milkweed, Acerates angustifolia) from the undermost world, and planted the seeds wherever they located on their journey from the northwest until they left Hdintli' pTn kta, but they failed to carry the seed of the larger cot- ton on leaving that place. They had a quantity of the cotton and the seeds of hdfiatseki, however, which they planted over the landof their present abode. When the cotton they took from Hiintli' pin kva gave out, they were forced to depend upon the Hopi Indians for this particular kind of cotton, which was much easier to spin than the hdwatseki. Care was taken to gather only the well-developed pods of the h"dwatseki. It must be not be too young, neither must it be too old. Should the cotton of the milkweed be old and dry, just a little water is sprinkled over it. The cotton is separated with the fingers into fluffs and deposited on a blanket. When a sufficient quantity is gathered the cotton is whipped with several very delicate rods (Figure 7d) until it becomes comparatively easy to handle for the spindle. A quantity is manipulated and pulled into strips that are added as the spinning proceeds. A good substantial cloth closely resembling if not identical in appearance to the genuine cotton was manufactured from this pod. The milkweed is spun and made into cord at the present time, on the primitive spindles, by the dshiwanni (rain priests) to be used in preparing their plume offerings. An excellent cloth was made from the leaves of Yucca baccata. The new central leaves were gathered, each leaf was folded into a piece some four inches long, and the fold was tied with a ribbon of the leaf. The folds were placed in a pot of boiling water and allowed to boil for some time; two spoonfuls of wood ashes were sprinkled into the water. The folds were removed from the pot and placed on a basket. When it had cooked, boys and girls pealed off the skin of the leaves, and beginning at the end of a pealed leaf it was chewed, being gradually taken into the mouth as the chewing proceeded. The leaf was taken from the mouth after it had all been chewed, the opposite end of the leaf was taken into the mouth, and the operation was repeated. Each leaf was chewed a long time,</page><page sequence="21">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 295 after which the fibers were separated, straightened, and laid on the floor beside the workers. Good sized bunches of the fiber thread were tied together in the middle and hung up in the storage room to dry. Before spinning, the fibers were soaked in cold water until softened, when they were rubbed between the hands and then straightened out with the fingers and pulled into a fluffy mass, which was spun and woven like cotton. When only cords were desired, the fibers were twisted into a single strand, which was doubled and twisted by rubbing the cord on the right knee with the right hand. When the cord was completed, it was chewed for a while to whiten it, after which it was put into a bowl of corn meal and well rubbed with the meal; then it was taken into the hands with a quantity of the meal and received an additional rubbing with the meal between the hands. This process changed the cord from yellow to white. These cords are made at the present time by the dishiwanni for preparing certain plume offerings. Specimens of cloth of great fineness of texture and artistic design in ground work of cotton, milkweed, or finely prepared fiber interwoven with bark of dark shades, or colored in blue, red, yellow, and black show that the Pueblos or their progenitors were adepts in factile art long before the Navaho attempted weaving (unless the Navaho and Pueblos come from a common stock), for as the writer has previously stated, there is no evidence of these Indians having woven blankets until after the introduction of sheep by the Spaniards. Also, the records of the Zuni show quite conclusively that they made the "Navajo Blanket" in elaborate designs before the Navaho aspired to the art, and they were contented to trade for the Zuni blanket or acquire it without consent of the owner- until they became fired with the desire to have blankets of the brilliant red of the bayeta (an all wool cloth with long nap, made into skirts by Spanish women). Then the Navaho took possession of the Pueblo art of weaving and of their symbols, improving upon the Zuni blanket by the introduction of the bayeta, for the Zuni red was a dull mahogany. The bayeta was raveled, and the wool, which is as fine as split zephyrs, was respun, usually two threads being spun into one. (A New York firm that furnished supplies to Indian traders told the writer in 1881 that the demand for bayeta had become so great that they had induced an English factor to manufacture the cloth, with the understanding they would take annually so many hundreds of pieces.) The bayeta must be combined with other colors in order to beautify the blanket with symbols, and so the Navaho became color makers. It is probable that they also stole [adopted] the art of dyeing from the Pueblos, though their processes, if not always somewhat different from that of the Zuni, had become so when Dr. Matthews and Dr. Pepper observed the Navaho dyeing. Wool Preparation of Wool for the Loom. The writer gives the preparation of wool, which is subjected to a number of processes to prepare it for the loom, in tabulated form. They are as follows:</page><page sequence="22">296 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON 1. Shearing sheep, Kandlu dwuyashea 2. Washing the wool, Uwe ukoshoya 3. Drying the wool, Uw e woryaoye 4.

Yarn hung up to dry, chitonn piyaye (yarn hung up) 13. Coloring yarn, chitonnJ adhoya 14. Drying the colored yam 15. Rolling the yam into balls. Shearing. The sheep are herded in the spring and autumn in corrals near the village. Here they are thrown to the ground, their feet are tied, and the shearing is begun. While the women take no part in the shearing, they carry much of the wool to their homes, depositing it in heaps on the floor. The cleaner white wool is separated from that which is more full of foreign matter, though it is all filthy enough. The gray is usually deposited in a separate heap from the black. Washing the Wool. The Zuni are particular to wash not only the white wool but the gray and the black before carding it. The writer, who has observed the preparation of wool for the card during many years among these people, has never known the Zuni to fail to wash the wool before carding. Though such work is usually done by the women, men also handle the wool from the shearing to the completed blanket. The root of yucca (Yucca glauca Nutt.) is pounded on a flat stone to free it from the bark, and after the bark is removed the root receives additional pounding; it is then whipped in cold water in a large pottery bowl until the suds stand high above the rim. The wool is put into the bowl and carefully patted and squeezed. It is often necessary for the wool to be passed through several bowls of yucca suds, before it is sufficiently cleansed. After the wool has been washed, it is thoroughly rinsed. While the more careful weavers use only cold water for washing the wool, depending entirely upon their hands for the manipulating (they say that rubbing the wool on stone renders it harsh), others, less ambitious for more perfect work, adopt the less tedious plan of washing the wool in hot water with the aid of a stone slab. When wool is to be cleansed in this manner, a good size smooth stone is selected and placed at a slight angle by resting one end of it upon another stone. The slab is then washed with hot water.</page><page sequence="23">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 297 Figure 8. Careless manner of washing wool. [Photograph by Matilda Coxe Stevenson. Courtesy of NAA, SI, Neg. No. 87-7005.] Suds of yucca root are made with cold water (yucca suds are never prepared with hot water), and hot water is added when the wool is put into the bowl, and after a slight washing it is removed to the slab and the suds gradually poured over it during the rubbing of the wool on the stone (Figure 8). At times a small quantity of wool is separated from the mass and rubbed between the hands. Drying the Wool. The wool is collected in basket trays and then carefully spread on stones that are high from the ground and that have been cleansed for the purpose, or on cloths spread on the roof, so that it may be as far as possible from the surface dust, and dried in the sun. Picking the Wool. After the wool is dry it is carefully picked over and deposited in a fluffy mass upon a cloth on the floor. The wool is now ready for carding. Carding the Wool. The ordinary commercial card is used. A card was probably introduced among the Pueblo early in the seventeenth century by the Spaniards. As each lot of wool is removed from the card, it is carefully folded lengthwise with the two hands and deposited on a cloth to the left of the carder, the folds pointing outward from the carder. The folds are thus stacked with great precision. Making the Wool into Strips. A pat or fold of the wool is manipulated with the fingers until it becomes extended into a strip. As each strip is formed, another pat or fold is jointed to it. When the wool has been passed through this process, more delicate manipulation is necessary. Pulling the Wool into Ropes. The long strip is further worked into an untwisted rope, about half an inch thick. (The Zuni and Navaho weave many</page><page sequence="24">298 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON Figure 9. Washing hank of yarn. [Photograph by Matilda Coxe Steven- son. Courtesy of NAA, SI, Neg. No. 87-7006.] blankets of this unspun wool, and they are most effective.) The wool is now ready for spinning. Spinning the Yarn. A primitive whorl composed of a slender stick run through a disk of wood or stone (the stone disk is rarely seen at the present time) is still in use. (The whorl is thla tone - thla, rod, and tone, put on, in reference to the disk attached to the spindle. It will be remembered that the original spindle had no whorl. The archaic name for this spindle is thlip nakia, making thread.) The wool rope is wound upon the distaff and spun. The Zuni have no set position for the spindle whorl. A corn cob is frequently run over the yarn during the spinning to straighten it. The yarn is often passed through a second spinning to render it stronger and, at the same time, finer. Making Yarn into Balls. The yarn is wound into a ball as it is taken from the spindle. Hanking Yarn. The yarn is wound from a ball that lies on the floor, by wrapping it around the elbow and hand between thumb and index finger, thumb pointing toward the face. Washing Yarn in Yucca Suds. The hank of yarn is then washed in a bowl of yucca suds, carefully rinsed, and then held stretched between the two hands while the water is shaken from it (Figure 9). Yarn hung Up to Dry. The hanks of yam are hung up indoors to dry, for it must be protected, from this time on through the dyeing, from the eyes of pregnant women, in order that the dyeing may be a success. (The yarn shown in Figure 10 was removed from the house and hung up outside to be photographed.</page><page sequence="25">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 299 Figure 10. Preparing yarn for drying (a) and yarn drying (b) [on door frame. Note pieces of wood used to weigh down yarn so that it will not crinkle (b). Note also the daily costumes described in the text. Photo- graph by Matilda Coxe Stevenson. Courtesy of NAA, SI, Neg. No. 87-7007.] It was carefully guarded that it might not be observed by a pregnant woman.) When dry this yarn is ready for coloring. A stone is placed in the loop of yarn to keep it free from crinkles. Dyeing Wool In 1904, the writer, realizing that the Zuni native dyes were fast becoming a lost art, determined to secure the full compliment of their colors ere it was too late. When the writer made known her desire to secure hanks of yarn of the various native colors, a number of Indians offered to do the work, but when she insisted that the dyeing be done at her camp, they protested that they could do much better work and would be less interrupted in their own homes. Innumera- ble ruses were offered to do the dyeing in their houses, and threats were made that it would not be done at all if it had to be accomplished away from the home. A little patience and perseverance on the part of the writer brought the men and women to her camp, the clouds of discontent disappeared, and they had a merrymaking time for some days. Not only the workers were present but numbers of their relatives and intimates, and the midday meal was much enjoyed amid jokes and laughter. Those whom the writer engaged to illustrate the native process of preparing wool were made to understand that nothing of foreign introduction, with the</page><page sequence="26">300 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON exception of the card and indigo dye, would be tolerated. The storage rooms were therefore overhauled for the dyeing pots, in which nothing but dyes and the yarns to be colored had ever been deposited. The dye pots of the Zuni are held only less sacred than their religious ceremonial vessels. Not an atom of grease has ever touched one of them. Yellow Dye. The first color produced was yellow. The dyeing pot was balanced on stones in the corner fireplace in the large room of the house that the writer occupied. The pot was more than half filled with water, and as soon as the water became a hot quanity of ha' kha (psilostrophe tagelina) blossoms, which had been freshly gathered by a male relative of the woman who was to do the dyeing, was added, and soon after a hank of white yarn was put into the pot and kept under the surface of the water by the constant use of a slender stick, the object being to keep the yarn well mixed with the blossoms. After boiling 30 minutes a portion of the water and flowers were dipped from the pot and emptied into a bowl, and yarn was deposited in the bowl and allowed to soak while the dyer gradually sprinkled mdtsa (salt sand, alunogen, native alum), which served as the mordant, into the pot, stirring slowly as effervescence occurred from the introduction of the alunogen. After a sufficient quantity of the alunogen had been added, the yarn was put into the simmering pot. Great care was observed that the dye did not boil too hard. The stick was constantly used to keep the blossoms well mixed with the hank of yarn. Three and a half hours were required to perfect the yellow dye, and during that time the contents of the pot were emptied three times and fresh water and flowers were put into the pot, alunogen being added as described. The yam was removed from the dye several times during the process, squeezed and held to the light to see if it had acquired the desired color. When the yarn was removed for the last time from the pot, it was squeezed and laid loosely on a flat surface to dry. Should it be hung up, the lower end of the hank would be a darker shade than the upper. When sufficiently dry to prevent the color running, the hank was hung up indoors to dry (for the reason previously given), and a stone was placed in the loop for the purpose of removing the crinkles from the yarn. (The hank of yarn as shown in Figure 10 was hung outside the house to be photographed, while great care was observed that it should not be seen by a pregnant woman.) Flowers of hatsothli ko (Chrysothamnus graveoleus, rabbit weed, the plant employed by the Navaho and Hopi for dyeing yellow) is also used by the Zuni, but the ha'ko ha is greatly preferred as giving a finer color. The writer had T6chi, a Hopi Indian married to a Zuni woman and a man renowned as a dyer and weaver, color a hank of yarn yellow. He employed the rabbit weed and failed to produce the color secured from Psilostrophe tagelina. Blue Dye. Indigo is used exclusively for dyeing blue, though the Zuni have a native plant that was employed before the introduction of indigo. (The Zuni</page><page sequence="27">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 301 claim that they brought the plant from which they procured their blue dye from the undermost world and planted it near Kothluwalaw&amp;a and at Hiintli' pin kta, but that this dye was supplanted by indigo after its introduction by the Spaniards. Illustrations show that the ancestors of the present Pueblos possessed a native dye, if archaeologists are not wrong in their conclusions that the ruins of the Southwest are of considerable age [passage moved from earlier in MS].) A good size piece of indigo tied in a cotton cloth was put into a vase of urine, which had stood four days, and the hank of white yarn was immersed and a stone weight placed upon the yarn. The yarn was examined and turned in the dye each day for eight days, when it was removed from the vase and found to be the desired color. Dark Blue. To produce dark blue, the lighter shade is put into a pot of black dye and boiled for a short time. T6chi, the Hopi Indian, dyed a hank of blue yarn, observing the process as described except that he added a small quantity of alunogen and a pinch of juniper ashes. Green Dye. The yarn was dyed yellow as described, with flowers of Psilostrophe tagelina, then intensely blue water was made with indigo held in the hand and rubbed with the fingers in cold water. The yarn, which was thoroughly squeezed on removing it from the yellow dye, was put into the cold blue water. After a short time it was removed from the pot and examined, but as the color was not satisfactory, it was returned to the pot of yellow dye, which was still over the fire, and allowed to remain 10 minutes, when it was squeezed and manipulated in the blue water for 20 minutes. After squeezing the shade was found to be satisfactory. Green Dye by T6chi. A quantity of hatsothli ko (Chrysothamnus graveo- leus) blossoms was put into a pot of cold water, and after the pot had boiled for an hour the water was strained from the flowers through a piece of coarse cloth, the pot was washed, the strained dye water was returned to the pot, and fresh hatsothli ko blossoms were added. The process of staining the dye-water and adding fresh blossoms was repeated three times. A quantity of the blossoms was put into a bowl of hot water and sprinkled with alunogen, which had been heated in a tin can and whipped with a slender stick until the contents of the bowl were a frothy mass of a bright yellow color. This mixture was emptied into the large pot of dye and stirred briskly for a few minutes, when an additional quantity of blossoms and alunogen, prepared as described in the bowl, were added to the pot and the whole stirred until the contents of the pot assumed the color of the mixture from the bowl. As soon as the dye began boiling after the last addition of blossoms and alunogen, the hank of blue yarn was thrust into the dye and kept under by a tablet of wood. The dye was repeatedly dipped with a bowl and emptied back into the pot for fifteen minutes, when it was left</page><page sequence="28">302 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON undisturbed to boil for fifteen minutes. The yarn was then removed, squeezed, and examined and found to be the desired shade. The hank was hung up to dry, and consequently the color was unevenly distributed. Red Dye. The only native red yarn known to the Zuni was a mahogany color. The Zuni have no record of ever having dyed yarn with any of the colors employed for buckskin. (Referring to the Navaho dyes for wool, Dr. Matthews [1884:377] says the reddish dye is made of the bark of Alnus incana var. virescens (Watson) and the bark of the root of Cerocarpus parvifolius, the mordant being juniper ashes.) The writer found great difficulty in securing the red dye. It was only after seven attempts by as many aged women that success was attained. The successful process was as follows. A hank of white yarn was soaked three days in mdtsa, alunogen (native alum) water, just enough to cover the yarn, which was spread out in the bowl, with a small quantity ofaluwe, carbonate of calcium (native lime). The yarn was delicately pulled each day to test its elasticity. After the third day the yarn was removed from the alum water and washed through six bowls of light suds of yucca, for the purpose of cleansing it of the alunogen, the tongue being used as a test. The yarn, which was then a greenish white, was ready for the dye. A quantity of mo'thlanna hawe (although hawe denotes leaves, the broken stems of the plant were also used) was put into a pot of boiling water. When the water had been reduced to one-fourth by boiling, the plant was removed and the yarn put into the pot and allowed to boil one hour. Then it was removed and well squeezed, and the contents of the pot were emptied. Fresh water was put over the fire, and when boiling, fresh leaves and stems of mo'thlanna hawe were put into the pot; while the plant was boiling the hank of yarn was washed in cold water and well squeezed and laid to one side until the dye was ready and the plant removed from the pot, when the yarn was immersed in the dye and again boiled for an hour. The process described was repeated three times. The third time several pinches of alunogen dissolved in three cups of cold water was poured into the pot and stirred until effervescence occurred, when the yarn was put into the pot without the plant having been removed. Again the yarn was removed, the contents of the pot emptied, and the pot washed and filled with fresh water and returned to the fire. When boiling, kia' inaitu (water seeds, Coreopsis car- daminifolia) blossoms were packed into the water. (The kra' inaitu blossoms were collected 20 miles from Zuni, a man repeating his journey seven times for as many sackfuls of the flowers, which are gathered by running the spread fingers through the blossoms into a sack. A sackful of blossoms were consumed at each of the seven dyeings.) Then sufficient alunogen dissolved in water to act as a mordant was poured into the pot and the yarn put in without the blossoms having been removed. This process was repeated three times. Each time the</page><page sequence="29">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 303 yarn was removed from the pot, it was washed in cold water and thoroughly squeezed. The pot was also washed each time before putting in the fresh water, blossoms, and alunogen. After the third boiling in the kha' inaitu blossoms, the yarn was thoroughly washed in cold water, well squeezed, and returned to the pot of dye, which had been removed from the fire, where it remained over night. The following morning the yarn, which was found to be the genuine and coveted red, was taken from the dye, squeezed, and laid on a flat surface to dry, care being observed to place the yarn where it could not be seen through the window by a pregnant woman. The deformed little creature who succeeded in producing the red dye from the formula she had acquired by many hours of thought as to what her grandmother had used to make the red dye was congratulated and praised by all who had been present through the days of tedious effort. The sweet expression became more and more attractive as the praises were heaped upon her until the light of her countenance obliterated the deformity of the body. This little woman is holding a hank of yarn in Figure 10. There was no thought of envy on the part of those who had made the effort and failed. It would not be characteristic of the Zuni to exhibit or even feel resentment toward one more successful than himself, and in this case the delight of the recovery of the lost knowledge of producing the red dye was paramount in the hearts of all present. Not that they would wish to leave off the new process for the old, but the wish of the writer had been gratified and she would carry to Washington an example of the dye so valued by those who had long since passed away. White Dye. While much of the yarn employed in Zuni weaving is used in the natural color, when a good clear white is desired the yarn is put into a mixture of kechipa and warm, not hot, water. Kechipa refers to a sandy clay containing gypsum. According to the report by Mr. Tassin [assistant mineral- ogist at the U.S. National Museum], "The white when fresh, probably had its whiteness materially increased by being rubbed with a lime ash or a gypsum wash, as a large amount of calcium is present in the ash of the fabric. " The yarn is patted in the mixture until thoroughly saturated, when it is removed and spread on a flat surface to dry. Wool from black sheep, which is a reddish or brown black, is employed in its natural state only for coarser weaving. The natural color is often used unspun, simply pulled into strands after carding, for coarse blankets and is frequently artistically combined into the unspun natural gray and white. Black Dye. A quantity of kosehawe (Rhus trilobata) was put into a pot of boiling water, and after the plant had boiled half an hour, powdered kiaitoshi (water wet), a clay found in a cave over which water falls (shale of clay containing sulphate of iron, aluminum, and magnesium) was added as a mordant and to produce an intense black. The yarn was then put into the pot and</page><page sequence="30">304 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON allowed to boil an hour and a half. It was then removed and squeezed and was found to be a glossy black. The better the quality of iron vitriol, the finer the black. Gray Yarn. A beautiful gray yarn is produced by carefully washing natural gray wool. Native dyeing is so tedious compared with the Diamond Dye formula that it is not surprising to those familiar with the process that the beautiful vegetable dyes have been supplanted by the obnoxious aniline colors so universally introduced by the white traders among the Pueblos and Navaho. [A description of "Navaho Dyeing, " inserted "that the difference between Zuni and Navaho dyeing may be observed," is omitted from this printing. The section consists primarily of a long quotation from Washington Matthews (1884:376-377). According to Stevenson, "the Navaho have practically ceased using their native dyes since Dr. Matthews wrote upon the subject. "] Coloring of Buckskin Coloring Bucksin Black. Kosehawe (Rhus trilobata Nutt.) leaves were put into a pot of cold water and boiled; after the water had boiled, the stems of the plant were added until the water was a rusty yellow or muddy color. After 30 minutes a quantity of the water was dipped from the pot, while the remainder of the dye was left to boil. That taken from the pot was cooled by dipping it with a gourd and pouring it back into a large bowl a number of times. When sufficiently cool, the buckskin was delicately manipulated in the bowl of dye, which was warm but not hot. (As the man was about to dip the skin into the bowl the first time, his sister-in-law arrested his hand and his wife, who was present though had not been observed by the man, came forward and expectorated upon the skin that the child soon to be born might not be black like the dyed skin.) After washing the buckskin by dipping it in and taking it out of the bowl of dye for several minutes, it was squeezed carefully, the water was thrown from the bowl, and a new supply of the dye for the pot was put into the bowl and the buckskin washed in it. The skin was kept somewhat longer in the second bowl of dye. It was squeezed as before, the bowl emptied, and a fresh supply of boiling dye from the pot put into the bowl. Two good dips with all the fingers of powdered kiaitoshi, native iron vitriol, was put into about three pints of the dye. (The iron vitriol usually dissolves readily in the hot dye but occasionally grinding is necessary.) The dye in the bowl was then sufficiently cooled by the process heretofore described, after which the skin was put into the dye and manipulated and wrung. This process was repeated with a fresh supply of the dye from the pot and iron vitriol. Again the skin was thoroughly worked in the dye and wrung, but as it was not satisfactory, about double the quantity of the iron vitriol was added to a fresh supply of the dye from the pot. The skin was worked thoroughly in the third bowl of dye, and when removed, it was</page><page sequence="31">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 305 squeezed with both hands instead of being wrung. The process was repeated a fourth time with the same quantity of the iron vitriol as was employed the third time; there was constant dipping and squeezing and examining of the skin. A fifth time the skin was returned to the dye where it remained three minutes, and when examined, it was not altogether satisfactory, owing to the inferior quality of the iron vitriol, and it was returned for the sixth time to the dye, after three pinches of the iron had been added. Finally after three minutes in the dye the skin became a fine black and was squeezed and pulled and stretched and laid in the shade to dry. Some three hours were consumed in the dyeing of the black skin. After it was dry it was pulled and stretched to soften it, and then buried beneath the earth to further soften it. When it was removed it was again pulled and stretched. Coloring Buckskin Red. Bark of the root of asi thlakwimowe (pl.; thlak- wimonm, sing.; asi, hand, so named from the hand-shaped leaf, Holodiscus dumosus (Nutt.) is broken into bits by pounding pieces of the bark two and three inches long on a stone slab to which is added bits of tsuya awantsitsi ndkta kwirhunnJ, (humingbird great sucking root bark, Castillia). These two roots are put into a perfectly clean pot of cold water. Pots for dyeing buckskins are as carefully guarded from grease as those for wool. The contents boil slowly for two hours. A portion is taken from the pot with a gourd dipper and emptied into a large bowl and dipped and returned to the bowl until sufficiently cooled; it was still quite warm when the skin was put in. The skin was thoroughly washed in the dye, then removed, and the bowl emptied and a fresh supply of dye was put into the bowl. The skin was returned to the dye and again thoroughly washed. (Skins are sometimes superficially colored by one chewing the dye roots and expectorating upon the skin and rubbing it with the hands.) Then it was squeezed and pulled and spread on the floor, the stones of the floor having been cleansed before the skin was placed upon it. A fresh supply of dye was put into the bowl and pot, along with a quantity of iKhinakia sikwane' (Alnus incana orAlnus tenuifolia Nutt.) bark, which was first broken into bits and ground by one of the women present on a large grinding stone. Luwe (ashes) made of homawe (juniper) twigs, ignited over fire then held blazing over a bowl that received the ashes, were delicately sprinkled over a portion of the skin. A corncob was dipped into the dye and rubbed over that portion which contained the ashes. This process was employed over the entire skin and was repeated until the color was satisfactory, when the skin was pulled, stretched, and laid out to dry. When dry, it was again pulled, stretched, and buried beneath the sandy soil, where it was left for hours to soften. When it was removed from the earth, it was again pulled and stretched until as soft as desired. The more pulling and stretching the finer the skin. It is almost impossible to secure skins of native colors at the present time owing to the use of Diamond Dyes.</page><page sequence="32">306 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON Weaving Every Zuni house in 1879 was provided with an arrangement to support the loom, and but few if any at the present time have abandoned the loom, for many coarse blankets of native wool colored with Diamond Dyes are made, and they still weave the diagonal cloth gown and wraps. While the Navaho do most of their weaving out of doors, the Zuni always weave their blankets in the house at the permanent place prepared for them. While it is usual for the Zuni women to weave, the men also do this work. In 1879 a Zuni boy 12 years of age, becoming jealous of the writer's praise of Navaho blankets, made a double saddle blanket to show her that the Zuni made quite as good blankets as the Navaho. The child had no pattern before him, and it was his first attempt at weaving. The specimen is of high order of work. The Komosona, director of the mythologic fraternity of Zuni, made a blanket of elaborate design in 1884 for the writer that she would know that the Zuni had not forgotten how to weave beautiful blankets. The Zuni found it more profitable to trade for blankets than to make them; besides, the Zuni, like more civilized people, are always pleased to show that they are able to purchase articles of foreign manufacture, and the Hopi and Navaho always sell out their stock when on a trading trip to Zuni. The Zuni never had a design before them for weaving. "They carry the design in their hearts, and their hearts tell them the right way. " (The writer has observed in the past years many Navaho weavers, and there was never a design employed.) In a Zuni loom there are four hooks or pegs an equal distance apart, the whole being sufficiently wide for the lower rod of the loom. A heavy flattened log of the proper length is set in the earth floor. If hooks are used, slender branches of green white cedar are heated in the fire and when sufficiently pliable the ends are bent to form close hooks. These hooks are driven deep into the log so as to insure permanence, and also to keep them out of the way. If the floor is slabbed with stone, the hooks are either driven between the slabs, or cavities sufficiently large for the hooks are made in the stone. The usual way is to select the place for the hooks directly beneath a beam of the roof, and if the slabs are in the way they are removed, then the hooks or pegs are driven into a log previously set, and the slabs replaced, so as not to interfere with the hooks. Buckskin thongs or hair rope are securely fastened to the hooks or pegs, where they remain permanently, ready to serve for attaching the lower portion of the loom. The old name, pilawe (pi, from pili, cotton), is retained for loom, though the Zuni weave but little cotton at the present time. Four poles or rods (pathikTatanne, sing.; paChikiatawe, pl.) are securely attached with buckskin thongs or cord forming a frame the size of the blanket to be woven. This frame is supported close to the floor.</page><page sequence="33">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 307 Figure 11. Zuni Wewha weaving belt. The picture was made during Wewha's visit to Washington. The dress is a sacred cotton embroidered blanket and inappropriate for the occasion, but it does illustrate how this blanket is sometimes worn. [Wewha, one of Stevenson's Zuni infor- mants, was posing as a model for a diorama at the National Museum, SI. Photograph by SI staff photographer, 1886. Courtesy of NAA, SI, Neg. No. 2261c.] Doctor Matthews's description of Navaho weaving is with few exceptions so exactly as the writer would describe the craft as practiced by the Zuni and other Pueblos that she quotes the eminent author as far as his description applies to the Zuni or Pueblo weaving. An ordinary Navaho blanket loom illustrated by Dr. Matthews (1884:Figure 42) is the same as that used by the Zuni. [Stevenson intended to quote pages 379 through 391 of Matthews's "Navajo Weavers" (1884), with the addition of Zuni names for weaving equipment and a few details of how Zunis set up and use the loom. This material is not included here, except for the following.] Once the loom is in place, it may or may not be disturbed before the completion of the blanket. It depends on whether the weaver desires to reverse the ends of the loom after completing about half of the blanket, or to loosen the rope that attaches the loom to the rafter and lower the loom and take a sort of tuck in the blanket. The lower portion of the tuck is wrapped over the lower rod to which it is securely sewed at the end of lap and the loose fold of the blanket</page><page sequence="34">308 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON beneath is wrapped with a piece of cloth to prevent being soiled. The impression made by the sewing is evident in all new blankets woven in this manner. In either case, the last few rows of the blanket are put in with a bone, commercial steel, or tin needle, but this is so dexterously managed that no difference between the work of the kwinine (shuttle) and the needle is perceptible. (Tin needles came into use several years after the writer's visit to Zuni and when most of the bone needles had departed for the National Museum. Tin cans thrown out by campers are now used for the tin needles.) The diagonal dresses of the women are usually woven from both ends. The white ceremonial blanket with red and blue borders which is diagonal is reversed after a border is made. The second border is then made, and the weaving is continued as close as possible to the other border when the blanket is filled in with the needle! The miha, or white embroidered sacred blanket, a sort of mummy cloth, may be reversed or not at the will of the weaver. Originally the miha and the diagonal white blanket were pure white. It was not until the introduction of sheep by the Spaniards that the Zuni and Hopi embroidered the ceremonial blankets. According to Matthews (1884:390-391), The only marked difference that I have observed between the mechanical appliances of the Navaho weaver and those of her Pueblo neighbor is to be seen in the belt loom. The Zufii woman lays out her warp, not as a continuous thread around two beams, but as several disunited threads. She attaches one end of these to a fixed object, usually a rafter in her dwelling, and the other to the belt she wears around her body [Figure 10]. She has a set of wooden healds [heddles] by which she actuates the alternate threads of the warp. Instead of using the slender stick of the Navajos to elevate the threads of the warp in forming her figures, she lifts these threads with her fingers. This is an easy matter with her style of loom; but it would be a very difficult task with that of the Navajos. .... The Zufii women weave all their long, narrow webs according to the same system; but Mr. Bandelier has informed me that the Indians of the Pueblo of Cochiti make the narrow garters and hair-bands after the manner of the Zufiis, and the broad belts after the manner of the Navajos. Pueblo Knitting Knitting was introduced among the Pueblos by the Spaniards. The Pueblos all declare that they knew nothing about knitting until the art was brought by the Spaniards, and there is certainly no evidence of knitting having been practiced by these Indians previous to the Conquest. Though the Zuni are most skillful in this craft, and though they knit a legging or footless stocking and a shoe reaching to the ankle, they never make a complete stocking. Both sexes and all ages wear tke iulthlawe (knit leggings), and the process of making these is as follows. A small ball of yarn the size of an egg is rolled from a large one, and the small ball is held between the knees while the larger one rests on the floor. The yarn connecting the two balls is taken about three-fourths of a yard from the small ball and passed in knitting loop over two steel knitting needles. (Five</page><page sequence="35">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 309 needles are used in making leggings.) The operating needle is held clamped between the third and small finger; the ends rest on the third finger. The yarn is first brought around and over the top of the thumb of the left hand then over the index finger, while it is held some three fingers off in the right hand. The yarn attached to the needles and that comes from the large ball is pulled through the loop made by bringing the yarn from the small ball around the fingers as described, and this loop is put onto the needle. The Zuni also knew how to knit an open-work cotton legging, but this work has not been done for a long time. There is, however, still a supply of these leggings on hand. They are worn only upon ceremonial occasions by personators of special anthropic gods. The writer has not observed the knitting of the shoes worn by women and children. SUMMARY In the preceding pages, the writer has aimed to embrace all the characteris- tic styles of dress and adornment of the Pueblo Indians, touching upon other North American tribes for comparison. She has shown that the Indians of the United States had developed a taste in prehistoric times for something more than to merely cover their persons and to protect themselves from cold. The crude undressed skins of animals as first worn by man, in time, were scraped and tanned to a soft pliable leather. Skins thus prepared were an incentive for elaboration to the more creative minds, and these skins became the books, and upon the broad leaves were written the history and religion of peoples. Artists became adept with the awl and needle as well as the brush, and the skins were elaborately decorated with wampum, porcupine quills, the bark of ferns, grasses, and, in more modern times, commercial beads. It remained for the more northern Indians to expand their art upon skins, while the southern Pueblo people developed in another way. They also became adept in the dressing of skins, which were quite universally worn by both sexes, if the statements by the Spanish invaders are to be credited, but their taste did not lead them into decorating those skins to any extent with the brush or with beads or grasses. Being sedentary with well constructed houses, they also constucted permanent places of worship, and they expressed their religion on tablets of wood and in stone carvings instead of using skins for this purpose. Buffalo robes were in great favor with the Pueblo tribes, as they were with all other Indians of the United States, for in the few sections where the buffalo did not roam the robes were carried in trade. The Pueblos also made their shields and masks of buffalo hide, and these of course were decorated with the brush. The climate of the south, however, was such that the dresses of skins must be displaced by something lighter in weight for some months during the year, and skirts of bark took the place of deer skins. These did not, however, altogether fill the requirements of the sedentary Indians either in the Southeast or Southwest, and these children of long ago invented spinning and weaving. It</page><page sequence="36">310 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON will probably never be known to whom the honor is due for the invention of weaving in the United States, for products of the loom are found scattered over a large area. Was it an invention of one people and adopted through intercourse by others, or was spinning an independent invention of many peoples of North America? Wherever the craft may have originated, the nameless inventors must live in history as introducing new eras in the the unknown world of North America. The great inventors of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries stand as brilliant stars in the firmament of civilization. These men developed in the environment of an atmosphere of great learning and high civilization. Wonder- ful strides have been accomplished in weaving in all civilized centuries, but the invention of the loom came from the children of the Stone Age; the loom was created in the midst of chaos, and it has developed through centuries of enlightenment. Was not the mind that conceived the loom and formed it in the darkness of the world as much a mastermind in invention as that which improves upon the mind work of another? And more marvelous still are the fine and beautiful fabrics produced by the primitive spindle and loom, a loom that produced not only plain, but diagonal cloth with borders in geometrical designs. Think of the invention of the preparation of Yucca baccata leaf fiber, which must be submitted not only to the microscope, but to chemical analyses, to an understanding that it is not cotton. Think of the spinning and weaving of milkweed into cloth. Civilized man has failed so far in his efforts to secure a desirable fabric from this plant. Dr. Leyster H. Dewey, Botanist-in-Charge of Fiber Plants, U.S. Agricultural Department states, [source not indicated] "Many attempts have been made to spin the milkweed fiber, and I believe that specimens which were said to be rather beautiful in appearance have been exhibited at expositions, but they are without any commercial value. " Seed of the milkweed has been found in the cliff and other ruins; the finest specimens seen by the writer were collected by Mr. George H. Pepper, formerly of the Museum of Natural History, N.Y. These seeds were Asclepias involucrata (Engelm.) Those secured by the writer were Asclepias incarnate, the same as the Zuni use at the present time. The women must have girdles to hold in their gowns, and the belt loom was invented. The earliest weaving of belts and of bands for wrapping the hair may have been done on looms such as the Navaho use at the present time, but the slats or healds as employed by the Pueblo weavers have been in use for a long period, and the writer questions the statement of the late Dr. Otis Mason that the Zuni and Hopi belt looms are of foreign origin. It will be observed that Dr. Tassin's report on specimens of fabrics found in ruins [not in this printing] mentions but one pure wool specimen. Most of them are purely vegetable; a few specimens, while essentially vegetable, contain hair, wool, or feathers. The writer is inclined to the belief that the wool</page><page sequence="37">Dress and Adornment of the Pueblo Indians 311 specimen is of recent origin. It was not classified, and Dr. G. B. Gordon [of the free Museum of Science and Art, University of Pennsylvania] was unable to give any information concerning [the provenance of] this specimen. There is no evidence that the Pueblos dyed buffalo wool or that of other native animals, and there was no variety in the color of cotton goods. The art of dyeing to any extent came into use after the introduction of sheep by the Spaniards. The Zuni developed the art of blanket weaving in color and elaborate designs to a high degree. After the Navaho possessed themselves of herds of sheep and became great weavers taking possession of the Zuni art, however, the Zuni found it of greater advantage to themselves to give their time to cultivating their land and their herds. Thus, they confined themselves to the making of the plainer blanket and traded their turquoise shell beadZuni employed the com- mercial wool only for belt and garter weaving.) Similarly, they ceased almost entirely to make the cotton ceremonial blanket and sash, depending upon the Hopi for these articles. Even the women's everyday dresses, wraps, and belts to some extent were purchased from the Hopi. This was largely due to the pride felt by a woman or maiden who could display the fact that she possessed the means of procuring dress of foreign manufacture. The desire for imported material, combined with the labor of weaving, is causing the Zuni and the other Pueblos to gradually leave off their picturesque dress for gowns of calico and other materials. In 1879 the writer found the Navaho women wearing, for everyday dress, full calico skirts falling below the knees--some reached to the ankles- with a loose calico sack reaching just below the waist. They always wear their blanket dress on state occasions. It was not until 1904 that the Zuni maidens fashioned calico and other material after their woven dresses, and some were wearing full calico skirts like the Navaho women. The Rio Grande Pueblos adopted this style earlier, and at the present time the picturesque native Pueblo dress is worn only to ceremonials and upon state occasions, at which times the Indian is quite sure to go back to at least some of his native customs in dress. With such Pueblos who do no weaving the native woven dress is fast becoming a thing of the past. The Hopi, however, still occasionally reach as far north as the Tewa tribes with their wares, but the prices are high compared with the charge for goods at the shops, and the younger women are quite as well satisfied with velveteen or silk skirts of one color with a deep border of a brilliant contrasting color. The Taos Indians are the most conservative of all the Pueblos, the Santo Domingo ranking next. The Taos men are not permitted to wear trousers, but must adhere to the long leggings that are attached with a string to a band around the waist; a breech cloth, which extends in many cases, especially in full dress, to the ground, is also supported by the string. The loins are wrapped with a blanket. A commercial shirt is allowed for everyday wear, but buckskin shirts are donned for all great occasions. The feet are covered only with moccasins,</page><page sequence="38">312 MATILDA COXE STEVENSON and no coat or hat is allowed. (No improvement in house structure within the Pueblo walls is permitted. Not a pane of glass is allowed in a wall.) It is quite different with the women, who may wear any material that their taste suggests. These people have a few old native wool dresses of Hopi and Zuni manufacture, which the women wear in their secret ceremonials, but for all plaza dances the modern dress is worn. Silk or gauze squares bordered with bands of ribbon and edged with lace, falling over the shoulders and down the back, have taken the place of the pretty white cotton ceremonial blanket bordered in red and blue, except with the Hopi and Zuni, who cling to their native dress for ceremonies and great occasions. Deer skins are still in use for women's moccasins and leggings. More commonly, however, a boot top with a buckskin thong through the top to hold it up and attached to the moccasin has taken the place of the legging that is wrapped in layers round and round the leg. The Zuni have not discarded the original leggings, which are also often seen in the ceremonial of those who have adopted the boot for everyday use. The Indian school girls are clad in blue and white check ginghams and the boys in khaki or overalls. The elastic tread of the Indian in his moccasins or bare feet is supplanted by the unyielding leather shoe, the innate graciousness of the untutored Indian is destroyed by his European education made necessary to compete with his present environment. The picturesque Pueblo dress is fading from view as the Pueblos themselves, with their arts and crafts, will in time be swept away in the amalgamation of the races. The charm that lent color and grace to the deserts of the Southwest will be no more. The gems that may now be gathered will disappear forever with the passing of the aged men and women of the Pueblo tribes. Let all men with brains and hearts come to the rescue while it is yet time, to those who could with the proper means complete the records of the "Vanishing Race."
