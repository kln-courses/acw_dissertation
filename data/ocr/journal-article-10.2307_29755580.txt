<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Archaeological Reconnaissance in the Helmand Valley, South Afghanistan This article reports briefly the results of a surface survey of archaeological sites in part of the Helmand Valley in the summer of 1966 0). The river flows from the K?h-i B?b? in the Hindu Kush southwest, west and finally north to debouch into the seasonal h?m?ns of the inland-draining basin of Seistan, whose main water supply it is (2). Seistan is the south? ernmost of the great inland-draining basins of Central Asia, and at the same time one of the few fertile areas between Mesopotamia and the Indus plain, while the Helmand is the largest river between the Tigris and the Indus. Seistan becomes historically important in the 4th and 3rd millennia B.C., with a cop? per- and bronze-using culture sited between and related to those of Baluchistan and the plain of Qandah?r (3). From Achaemenian times it was effectively an eastern province of Iran, although often autonomous in name or actuality, and figures prominently in the early myth history of the Achaemenid dynasty and the Zoroastrian religion (4). It was famous for the fertility promoted by the irrigation system based on the Helmand, and a route centre through which Alexander passed on his way to India, and Crateros on the return journey. There are (*) I am most grateful to the Royal Afghan Government, who gave permission for the survey to be undertaken, and to the staff of the Kabul Museum, especially the Director, Mr A A. Mota medi, Dr Rauf Wardak, and Mr A. Marefi who accompanied the expedition in the field. That the project took on concrete form is due to the encouragement of Sir Mortimer Wheeler and Prof. Grahame Clark, and its gestation was advanced by the advice and assistance of Dr Raymond Allchin, Dr Bridget Allchin, Mr David Bivar, Miss Beatrice de Cardi, Dr Louis Dupree and Mr David Stronach. The members of the expedition were graduates and undergraduates of the University of Cambrid? ge, and it was sponsored by the British Academy, Royal Geographical Society, Royal Central Asian Society, British Institute of Persian Studies, Ge? rald Averay Wainwright Near Eastern Archaeo? logy Fund of Oxford University, Crowther-Beynon Fund and Worts Fund of Cambridge University, Gilchrist Educational Trust, the Sunday Times and Messrs Hodder &amp; Stoughton Ltd.

Archaeological work in Seistan has been t etarded by the modern frontier which divides it and perpetuates its traditional status as a borderland. Stein carried out a reconnaissance and a number of sondages on the Iranian side in 1916 which located prehistoric sites in the Helmand delta (6). In 1925 Herzfeld excavated the fire-temple on K?h-i Hw?ga (7). The Italian Archaeological Mission in Iran has excavated the Achaemenian site at Dahan-i Gul? m?n, thought to be the contemporary provincial capital (8), and most recently the prehis? toric urban site of Sahr-i Sohta first located by Stein (9). In Afghan Seistan the French delegation carried out a reconnaissance in 1936 (10), mainly of Islamic sites, during which Ghirshman sondaged one of the mounds of Nad-i "Ali i11); this site has since been re-excavated by the University Museum of Pennsylva? nia (12). In 1949 Fairservis carried out a reconnaissance which discovered prehistoric sites in the Gard?n Reg in the south of the basi n (33). The plain of Qandah?r has seen rather more excavation, at the prehistoric sites of Mun digak (14) and Deh Moras! G?ndai (15), the cave of Samsir Gar (16) and the Ghaznavid ruins of Laskari B?z?r (17), but the valley of the Helmand River between the latter site and the Seistan basin had never been archaeo logically explored in spite of its obvious poten? tial as a trade route and an area for settlement. The object of the 1966 expedition was to locate, map and sample sites in this part of the valley, from Qalca-i Bust at the confluence of the Helmand and Argand?b downstream to Bandar-i Kam?l Han where the river emerges into the basin of Seistan. The intended scope of the survey was curtailed by illness, and the work actually carried out comprised a single traverse of the left bank of the Helmand over the full length of this sector, to assess the areas of greatest archaeological potential, followed by more detailed survey of one of these areas.

This choice was based on three factors: the large number of sites noted on the first traverse, recent development by the Helmand Valley Authority that had provided two bridges, motorable tracks and a petrol supply at Bost, and the danger that further development would present to a number of sites. The survey was carried out in two vehicles, although animal transport would have been more useful in the canal-choked flood-plain. Some items of equipment were adapted for reconnaissance work: a 10-metre cloth scale which allowed photographs of whole sites to be taken from a distance and also allowed site dimensions to be measured directly from pho? tographs; and a transportable photographic tower erected on the roof of a vehicle which gave a camera height of 7 m. for high-angle and high-level work. Each site was plotted on the map (18), photographed whole from a distance and in more detail if necessary, and its surface occupation debris sampled. The sample was taken by a variant on the method suggested by Alcock (19). A random collection of sherds from all parts of the site was assembled and examined. Badly eroded sherds were discarded, then body sherds lacking decoration or other potential information content were separated out and only a proportion kept; no sherd was discarded if its fabric, temper or firing ap? peared at all unusual ? most of the discarded material was plain red ware. No attempt was made to increase the proportion of decorated sherds in the sample except by this negative method. Each site was given a label bearing a site number and its name if known (table 1). 45 sites were sampled (20), some being divisions of complex sites where settlement drift was suspected. Sites were of three types: cmounds5, tepe/damb, and ruined build? ings, although the latter two were sometimes found together. cMounds') are low eminences covered with a scatter of occupation debris, having the appearance of small tepe but repre? senting a former general level of the land surface which has been preserved by a coating of debris from the deflation which has lowered the surrounding ground level (21). On such sites all occupation material is on the surface. Recent work at Sahr-i Sohta has however shown that many apparent cmound!&gt; sites may in fact be true tepe, but that only excavation can accurately resolve the question (22). Tepe/damb are mounds formed by the collapse of successive layers of mud-brick (18) The quarter-inch Survey of India was used; a set of the new American 1:50,000 sheets prepared from air photographs was obtained in Kabul but was found &gt;to be so deficient in informa? tion as to be of little use. (19) L. Alcock, ?A Technique for Surface Collecting ?, Antiquity, June 1951, pp. 75-6. (20) At one site, the Early Islamic fort of M?dar-i P?ds?h, the sherd collection was inad? vertently left on the site, which is therefore un? numbered and does not feature in the pottery analysis. (21) Stein, op. cit., 1928, pp. 908, 934, 949-50: Huntington, op. cit., pp. 305-8. (22) Tosi, op. cit., 1968, p. 16. 440</page><page sequence="5">buildings (23). They are larger and higher than the cmounds!) and are often river by erosion gullies which expose the levels of mud-brick debris. Wind and water erosion have ac? cumulated a surface scatter of occupation debris, but the latest phases of occupation are usually the best represented since the early levels are protected by the later. Ruined buildings are usually not earlier than the Islamic period, although some date back to Sassanian times. Those standing on flat ground are most susceptible to wind ero? sion, and on many sites the east-west walls have been completely removed by the action of the b?d-i sad-o-bist r?z, the cwind of 120 days5 which blows from the northwest from May until September (fig. 10). Several of the large tepe are crowned with a ring of Islamic fortifications. The pottery from ruined buildings is in much better condition than that from open sites, due partly to its more recent date and partly to the protection from erosion afforded by the walls. This may result in a higher proportion of glazed and painted wares from such sites, and also means that many fewer sherds have to be discarded because of poor con? dition. On many open sites, especially cmounds5, a large proportion of the collection had been affected by wind erosion and by impregnation with salts as a result of saline efflo? rescence from the soil (24). Impregnation had damaged the painted decoration on the few such sherds found, and it is possible that on many sherds former painted decoration has now vanished. This would result in undersampling of such material, with serious reper? cussions in the diagnosis of prehistoric occupation, which is largely dependent on painted pottery, and in estimating the relative importance of painted wares in the Islamic period. Glazed decoration was also affected, in some cases the design and even the colour of the decoration being destroyed. A few sites were covered with thick tussocks of grass. The pottery collections from such sites were very small, seemingly because the ground surface has been protected from erosion and surface sherds have not accumulated, and also because it is difficult to collect sherds among this vegetation, and not necessarily from any paucity of occupation debris at the site (25). The degree of protection from erosion is clearly related to the size and condition of the pottery sample, and also its constitution, and makes any assessment of a site by surface collection alone difficult. The expedition did not have permission to dig trial pits, but this (23) R. Pumpelly, Explorations in Turkestan; Prehistoric Civilisations of Anau {Carnegie Institu? tion of Washington Publication, 73), 1908, pp. 220-1, claims that the kurgans of the Merv oasis were all deliberately constructed mounds of adobe walls and mud fill. Some of the Helmand sites could be of this type, if such exists: Site 25 has drystone walling visible in the eroded face of the mound and is certainly a built site, but is equally certainly not prehistoric. (24) In the more humid atmosphere in which those sherds brought back to England have been kept they have continued to grow a thin coating of saline crystals for more than eighteen months. (25) This phenomenon occurs in other parts of the world, e.g. M.D. Coe, ? La Victoria: An Early Site on the Pacific Coast of Guatemala ?, Papers of the Peabody Museum, Harvard Univer? sity, LIII, 1961, p. 24. 441</page><page sequence="6">would seem to be the only sensible method of estimating the archaeological potential of sites in this area. The total sample retained from the 45 sites was 1473 sherds, an average of 33 but with a site sample ranging from 1 to 86 sherds; this is far too little for quantitative statis? tical work, but qualitative methods may still be used. The ceramics were of a varied and distinctive nature suitable for analysis by the type-variety method (26), but the size of the present sample was insufficient for its use. The amount of plain wares in the sample was too small for any valid classification of new types to appear, although types already known could be identified. In classification a number of criteria were first considered, relating to the three main characteristics of pottery, the fabric, form and surface treatment. Main features of the fabric are colour, temper and firing. Analysis by colour produced three groups: red (1207 sherds), black (82 sherds) and buff (141 sherds). The buff wares were of a clay which was clearly specially obtained or processed and might well form a valid group in the material, but many of the red and black wares differed only in firing, with many other shared traits, so division on a colour basis did not seem likely to be useful. Classification by temper or firing was no use, since most of the material was tem perless, and the only notable feature of the firing was its competence ? even large vessels with walls 3 cm. thick lacked any trace of a dark core. Division on the basis of vessel form was rejected because of the small size of the sample and its large proportion of body sherds, although this method was subsequently used to isolate identifiable plainware types. The classification was therefore carried out on the basis of surface treatment. The material was divided into two groups, one in which the surface of the clay had been altered by addition or manipulation and one in which it had not. Provision of a slip was taken as the minimum qualification for entry into the former class; the possibility of some vessels being only partially slipped was considered unlikely to cause large-scale errors. The second group, termed cplain wares5 was further divided into two classes, of buff ware and a red -? black continuum. The first group, termed cdecorated wares5 was further divided by technique of decora? tion and whether it involved addition to or manipulation of the surface. Slipped sherds lacking further ornament were classed as light- red- or dark-slipped, and four sherds with an orange slip on buff fabric were also noted. Nine painted sherds were noted; all were in entirely different fabrics and styles and they were not considered as a group. The principal method of surface manipulation was by incision, including combing, slashing, jabbing, and punctation; other methods included ribbing and marking with cord, textile and basket, the latter two represented by a single sherd each, and ring-burnishing. (26) R.E. Smith, G.R. Willey, J.C Gifford, ? The Type-Variety Concept as a Basis for the Analysis of Maya Pottery ?, American Antiquity, XXV, 1960, pp. 330-40. 442</page><page sequence="7">Mould-made pottery was classed as relief-moulded or recessed-moulded and glazed wares as plain or ornamented. Examination of the fabric and form of the sherds within each of the groups set up on the basis of decoration showed considerable homogeneity except in the group of dark slipped sherds, and with this exception the groups were used as the basis of further ana? lysis. Some sherds combined two or three types of decoration and were accordingly in? cluded in more than one class, but this merely served to emphasize the affinity of those classes in the analysis. The groups of decorated pottery set up were: red-slipped, light-slipped, ring-bur? nished, ribbed, jabbed rows, incised cordons, incised parallel lines, straight combing, wavy combing, incised loops, incised complex designs, punctate-filled incised panels, cord-marked, plain-glazed, ornamented-glazed, relief-moulded, recess-moulded. To these 17 groups were added four extracted from the plain wares: the buff sherds, which exhibited little internal variation, and groups of Achaemenian, Hellenistic and Par? thian sherds identified by fabric and form (27). These last four groups were obviously se? lected on different criteria from the other seventeen, but the criteria were no less discrimi? nating and all the groups have therefore been given equal status. The division of the material has therefore resulted in 21 groups (28), each defined by a Character5 on the basis of which that group is homogeneous (table 2). Outside this grouping remain the unidentified plain ware sherds of the red -? black continuum, the disparate collections of painted and dark-slipped sherds, the four orange-slipped sherds and the single textile and basket-marked sherds. These were omitted from the analysis but except for the first are included in the tabulation of sites and characters, as are two sherds of a soft dark ware with faint incised or impressed decoration in a ctriglyph5 pattern (figs. 4, 17). The unidentified plain ware sherds number about 500, or a third of the total sample. Some 200 of these are rim sherds and might later prove identifiable, the re? mainder, 20 percent of the total sample, must be considered useless with present methods of classification. Each of the 21 groups set up was considered as an unweighted character in a matrix which was analysed to show the association between the characters in their occurrence over the 45 sites. No measure of weighting required could be calculated for characters defined by such diverse means, and anomalies caused by lack of weighting tend to cancel out. The analysis was based on the deduction that most sites were occupied for a relatively short part of the time span represented by the total sample, since no one site possessed more than 50 per cent of the groups and no one group was present on more than 60 per cent of the sites; therefore a high degree of association between groups would indicate (27) By Mr David Stronach. (28) The constitution of these groups is des? cribed in detail in the Appendix. 443</page><page sequence="8">probable contemporaneity and a high degree of association between sites on the basis of groups shared would indicate probable simultaneous occupation. In the analysis the number of sherds of a group present on any one site was ignored, as was the total number of sherds in the group, since the sample size was too small for the information to be of any value. Each character was scored for each site on a pres? ence/absence basis. Certain assumptions are implicit in this use of matrix analysis: the 45 sites are re? garded as a statistical population and the 21 characters as a set of attributes of that popu? lation. The sites form a polythetic assemblage in that each of them possesses several of the characters but none possesses all the characters; they do not form a polythetic assem? blage in the strict sense used by Sokal and Sneath (29) in that some of the characters are not possessed by ? large numbers ? of the sites and that some sites do not possess ? large numbers ? of the characters. The number of characters is much too small for what Sokal and Sneath would consider a reliable analysis, since they recommend a minimum of 40 and if possible 60 characters, but this analysis may still provide one or two useful indications of affinity among the various characters and sites. Certain of the characters as used have proved to be multistate characters which could be subdivided to enlarge the total, for ex? ample ribbed ware. The similarity of distribution of the 21 characters over the 45 sites was calculated; characters were sorted in pairs over all sites and the associations entered first as a raw total, which was converted to a percentage of the maximum possible association by use of a simple correlation coefficient. The matrix was sorted and is shown as a diagram indicat? ing percentage correlations in two orders, from 100 -? 70 per cent and from 70 -* 50 percent (fig. 3). In this form the diagram shows two main clusters, one of characters iden? tified as Islamic and the other of characters identified as pre-Islamic, together with a smaller cluster with associations which may be intermediate or ambiguous. The mul? tistate character of ribbed pottery is obvious; the wide distribution of decorated glazed wares is surprising, presumably a function of their nature as trade goods rather than local products. A notable feature of the diagram is the lack of association between pre-Islamic and Islamic types, below 30 per cent, but their mutual association with the smaller inter? mediate cluster. This cluster contains most of the groups peculiar to the Helmand valley and suggests that most of them are local wares of the post-Hellenistic and pre-Islamic period of the Kushans and Sassanians. The implication is of a fair degree of local cultural independence, and also of a steady settlement drift to new sites between the Achaemenian period and the Islamic. The light-slipped group may well be another multistate character, with some of its sherds perhaps related to the prehistoric wares from Mundigak and Deh Morasi G?ndai. Some results of the analysis correspond well with the known stratigraphic sequences, for (2S) R. Sokal, P. Sneath, Principles of Numerical Taxonomy, Kansas City, 1963. 444</page><page sequence="9">example the early florescence and long subsequent life of ring-burnishing, but the danger of relying on information from a sample this small is shown by the low correlation be? tween the buff ware and relief-moulded groups, which may in some cases have formed the plain and decorated parts of the same vessel. Another surprising feature is the lack of as? sociation between Achaemenian, Hellenistic and Parthian pottery, since all are associated with ring-burnished ware; this is probably an accidental function of the small sample. Most of the 21 groups were of pottery types already known from sites elsewhere in south Asia, and the seriated sequence which resulted from the analysis (fig. 4) fits in well with the stratified sequences known from adjacent areas. The one sherd of prehistoric painted ware is of a type common at Mundigak before period IV, 1 and indicates that set? tlement or at least penetration had reached as far downstream as the area of Darwes?n (fig. 16), but the prehistoric material may have been seriously under-represented in this sample be? cause of erosion of diagnostic pottery on the surface or superimposition of later levels pre? venting its appearance. After this there is an apparent hiatus in the occupation of this part of the valley until the Achaemenian period. Pottery of this phase is still sparsely distributed, but occupation increases in the Hellenistic-Kushan period, with contacts from India to Soghdiana reflected in the ceramics. Most of the local pottery types were placed by analysis in the late Kushan and Sassanian periods, although both form and decoration continue from the earlier phase. Islamic pottery was most common in the sample, with Ghaznavid wares best repre? sented. Many of these presumably came from the nearby factories at Laskari B?z?r. Al? most every site with an Islamic occupation yielded small numbers of sherds of Samarkand trade wares of the lOth-llth cent. A.D., and one sherd appears to be a local imitation of Chiin ware of the Chinese Sung Dynasty (960-1279 A.D.). The mould-made wares were of local manufacture, as is shown by the presence of mould fragments in the sample. A few Timurid and modern sherds were found. Conclusion The reconnaissance succeeded in its principal objective, the confirmation of postulated extensive ancient settlement in the Helmand valley between the Qandah?r plain and the Seistan basin, but failed in its subsidiary aim of investigating the role of the valley as a tiade route and centre of early settlement in the prehistoric period. Evidence of penetra? tion at this time was found, and subsequent excavations at Sahr-i Sohta suggest that it was the route along which lapis lazuli was brought from Badakhshan in the 3rd millennium to Seistan (30). Examination and analysis of the pottery sample has been carried far enough to indicate the extent of occupation in the valley from Achaemenian times on, but the (30) Tosi, op. cit., 1968, p. 59. 445</page><page sequence="10">Characters 123456789 1 2 3 4 5 X X X X 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 XX X XX xxxxxx eXXXXX X XX XXX X X X xxxxx XX X 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 X uXXXX is XX X 16 17 18 X 19 20 21 22 23 24 X X X XX X X XX X X X X XXX xxxx X X xxxx X X X XXXXX X 25 XX XX 26 XXXX 27 X 28 XXXX 29 X X X X XX XX X X XXXX XXXXX X XX X XXXXX XX X XX X 30 31 X 32 X X 33 XX 3* X X 35 X 36 X X 37X XXX XXX 3sX XX 39 X 40 XXX X 41 X 42 XXXX X 43 X 44 XX ? , 45 XX X X No. of sites possessing character: 8 10 20 16 28 3 5 12 11 XX xxxx X X XX XX X xxxx X X X X X X X X X X XX X X XX X X X X X XX XX XXX XX X X XXX X X XX XXX X X X X X X XX X XXX X xxxxxxxxxx XX X X 25 11 10 16 6 13 6 2 12 12 20 Fig. 2 - Distribution of pottery groups over sites.</page><page sequence="11">1 2 3 ? 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 K 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 1X XOO OO O 2 XXXX OO O O 3XXXXXXXOOOOOOO o a oxxxoox ooo 5 oxxoxxxxoxooxxxxxxxxo 6 XOXX O X o 7 XXX xo o sooxoox o o o 9 O O XOO o 10 OOOX OXXO o o 11 ooooo ooxxxxxoo o 12 ooo oxx o o o 13 O.

The seriated pottery sequence may be compared with the stratified sequences known from sites in Ba? luchistan, Seistan, the Qandah?r plain and Central Asia, and will serve locally until early stratified sites there are excavated, while the distribution of sites of successive periods could be investigated by locational analysis to give some idea of the internal structure of the settlement pattern of the valley through time. This survey has shown little more than the existence of considerable archaeological potential in the Helmand valley, the investiga? tion of which by further exploration, excavation and environmental study would do much to increase our knowledge and understanding of the evolution of culture in the Indo-Ira nian borderlands.

The assignation of numbers to the characters was made after sorting of the matrix. 1 - Achaemenian. This grouping includes both material classed as Achaemenian by Mr David Stronach and similar material classed as probably Achaemenian by myself. There are 22 sherds, all oxidized in firing to a hard red. The fabric contains small white mineral inclusions and averages 4.5 mm. in thickness. Some sherds have a red slip slightly deeper in colour than the fabric, and some have dark parallel burnished lines. The only vessel types present are small bowls and perhaps a small flask. 2 - Hellenistic (fig. 18). This group of 25 sherds also includes material classed both by Mr Stronach and myself, and is in some cases separated from group 3 only because of the recognizable rim form. The devolved forms which I have added to this class may well be early Kushan rather than truly Hellenistic. Fabrics are hard, fired grey, brownish-pink or red; the latter is more likely Kushan. The small white mineral inclusions found in the Achae? menian wares are still found, but the fabric is thicker, averaging from 5 to 7 mm. The brownish wares have a brown slip and the red wares a dark or red slip. Decoration includes ring-burnishing, stamped and incised palmettes and olive sprays on the red ware. Vessel forms include ? tulip bowls ? like those from Ch?rsada (31), fishplates similar to those from Ai Hanum, flasks, small bowls and a lid. The grey wares are much like those from Be? gr?m I. 3 - Ring-burnished (fig. 11). The class contains 88 sherds, all of a thin (3.5-5 mm.) hard and well fired red fabric without temper and lacking the small mineral inclusions of the earlier (31) M. Wheeler, Ch?rsada: a Metropolis of the North-West Frontier, London, 1962, fig. 19, no. 96; fig. 21, no. 120. 451</page><page sequence="26">wares. It varies in shade from brownish-pink to brick red, and the self-slip similarly ranges from brown through plum-red to a bright orange-red. Decoration is in the form of burnished lines made with a pointed tool, which are usually parallel and horizontal on the body but which near the rim may overlap each other at all angles or turn into a scribbled design of running loops or spirals. Vertical burnished strokes are found on the neck of a flask. Vessel types include stemmed and footed goblets, shallow and deep bowls, flasks and small hole-mouthed jars. The goblets have simple tapering direct rims, the bowls have them rolled outwards, built-up and beaded, but with the components clearly defined by sharp angles giving a metallic cfeeP to the ware. Ring-burnishing appears on some of the group 2 sherds, which are therefore probably Hellenistic forms surviving into the Kushan period. The technique first appears in the Late Kushan level 2 at Samsir Gar, dated from ca. 100-300 A.D. Some of the rim types found in this level parallel those from Begr?m I-III, showing the survival of Hellenistic forms. Ring-burnished wares increase in Samsir Gar 3, a Kushano-Sassanian level, which accords with Stein's identification of the ware as Sassanian from its association with frescoes at Gaga-Sahr or the K?h-i Hw?ga in Sei stan (32). It continues in reduced quantity into Samsir Gar 4, the Early Islamic level and dies out in the first century or two of the Islamic era. 4 - Red-slipped. There are 42 sherds in this class, which in many respects appears to be the same ware as group 3, but lacking the burnishing. The fabric is thicker, from 5-8 mm., lacking inclusions and fired from yellowish pink to brick red. The slip varies from plum to bright red and is the only decoration. Vessel types are bowls and pot-lids, the bowl rims rolled out with an internal bead to engage with the lid. The matrix analysis shows this class to have flourished at the same time as group 3, though it died out earlier, and it appears to have been made by the same potters as a heavier domestic ware than the fine ring-burnished vessels. A red-slipped ware is found in Samsir Gar 2 with a bisque paste, but this is probably due to the colour of clay deposits in that area, which were later much in favour for decorated wares under the Ghaznavids. 5 - Ribbed Ware (fig. 11). With 178 sherds this is the largest class of decorated wares, and it may be possible to subdivide it by variants of rib spacing and formation. The fabric varies in thickness from 5-11 mm., in colour from pink to dark red, and in slip from cream to dark. It is tempered with scattered small grits. Some sherds are complex-fired to give a dark outer surface. Decoration is in the form of parallel horizontal ribbing with curved or flat rib crests and trough bottoms, with the crests spaced from 6-11 mm. apart. Identifiable vessel types are bowls and large jars, but most of the group are body sherds and may partner some of the rim types in the plain red ware. Ribbed ware seems to have functioned as the common domestic ware of this part of the world; Stein remarked upon (32) Stein, op. tit., 1928, p. 910, note 4. 452</page><page sequence="27">its abundance and ubiquity in Iranian Seistan compared with other areas. In the matrix analysis it is shown to be associated with every other type, and it occurs on more sites (28) than any other character. Its dating is therefore uncertain; Stein assumed that it was Sas sanian from its occurrence at Gaga-Sahr, but Fairservis dates its occurrence in the Quetta Valley from the late 1st cent. B.C. to the 8th cent. A.D. (33). 6 - Parthian. Only 5 sherds have been ascribed to this group, two by Mr Stronach and three by myself. Some may be Kushan versions of Parthian wares. The sherds average 6 fnm. in thickness and are fired red, with a little light slip round the rim. All the sherds are of one type of bowl with its rim built up on the inside to form a flat surface. 7 - Jabbed Rows (fig. 11). This group contains only 8 sherds, red and from 6-9 mm. thick. One sherd has a light slip and another was incompletely fired. Decoration consists of a single horizontal row of holes, deep or shallow, jabbed in the soft clay by a pointed tool. On one pot at least this was a reed. Vessel forms include bowls and jars, and the ware was domestic rather than fineware. In the matrix analysis the ware is associated with groups 3,4 and 5 and would therefore appear to be a local type of domestic ware of the Kushan period. 8 - Cordoned Ware (fig. 11). There are 16 sherds in the group, all of a thick fabric (13-23 mm.) which in spite of its bulk is fired a uniform brick red. Most of the sherds have a light slip, and light-slipped wares of group 11 may well come from the undecorated parts of such vessels if the variation in thickness can be countenanced. Decoration consists of a horizon? tally applied band of clay which has been marked by a series of slashes, thumb-jabs or other impressions, sometimes giving the impression of a twisted rope. Some have paired rows of incisions giving a herringbone effect. One sherd lacks the applied cordon, and has merely a herringbone design on the vessel wall, and another has had the clay forced up by thumb-jabbing to form a pseudo-cordon. The only certain vessel form is a large hole mouthed jar with a simple rim thickened on the outside by an applied strip of clay. The ware is probably Kushan to Early Islamic. 9 - Plain-glazed Wares. There are 18 sherds in this group, all of a pinkish-buff fabric 5-9 mm. thick with a light slip on the unglazed surface. Most of the vessels were bowls, with a plain blue glaze on the inside extending a short way over the rim, and one sherd was of a flask, blue-glazed with annular decoration round the short neck. Rim forms were simple. All these sherds seem to be post-Mongol, probably Timurid (34). Their associa? tions in the matrix are scattered. (33) W.A. Fairservis Jr, Excavations in the Quetta Valley, West Pakistan (Anthropological Papers of the American Museum of Natural His? tory, XLV, 2), 1956, pp. 340, 348. (34) J.C. Gardin, Ceramiques de Bactres (MDAFA, XV), Paris, 1957, asserts that this or a similar type is late 12th cent, at Laskari B?z?r, citing Lashkari-Bazar, II (MDAFA, XVIII), Paris, 1963, chap. 4 ser. XIV-3. 453</page><page sequence="28">10 - Cord Marked (fig. 13). There are only 5 sherds in this group, all of a dirty pink fabric with small inclusions, without slip and from 9-16 mm. thick. Decoration is by parallel impressions of a twisted string or cord, evenly spaced or paired. Three of the impressions show a 2-ply S-twist, with Z-spun elements visible in two cases and deducible in the third; one shows a 2-ply Z-twist of S-spun elements. The sherd from Site 6 shows three different cords: a 4-ply S-twist made up of two 2-ply cords run together, with Z-twisted elements; a 2-ply S-twist of Z-twist elements; a 2-ply S-twist of indeterminate structure. All three impressions are probably from the same cord, double-twisted in the first case and lightly applied in the third. All are body sherds from large vessels of indeterminate type. In the matrix they are associated with the earlier wares, and are probably a local Kushan type. 11 - Light-slipped. This class contains only those light-slipped sherds (73) which lack other decoration; many of the cordoned sherds and those with other incised ornament also have a light slip. The fabric is a well-fired brick red, from 12-29 mm. thick, and the sherds are on the whole from large storage jars. The associations in the matrix are as might be expected mainly with the incised-decorated wares, and then with the early wares rather than the Islamic. This suggests that a light-slipped domestic ware existed from the Kushan to the Early Islamic period, after which it was supplanted by pottery made of buff clay which did not need a light slip. Light-slipped wares are found in the prehistoric period at Mun digak and Deh Moras! G?ndai, but it is almost impossible to tell whether any of the material in the present collection is of this date; the only hope of doing so would be by direct comparison of specimens, and the material from these excavations is largely in Kabul, New York and Paris. Our comparative collection from Mundigak contained one sherd of the ware. 12 - Incised Parallel Lines (fig. 11). There are 21 sherds in this group, all of a red fabric 6-7 mm. thick, some with a light slip. Decoration is by parallel horizontal incised lines, evenly spaced at an average of 6 mm. apart. Some resemble the flatter ribbed wares, especially a collection from Site 8 which is probably a microlocal variant of the ribbed type. There are no obvious associations in the matrix, but those that are there combined with rela? tionships to other types suggest a Late Kushan ? Sassanian ? Early Islamic date. 13 - Straight-combing (fig. 11). The lines are made by a toothed comb dragged along the surface, and the straight lines are often found on the same sherd as wavy-combed lines. The fabric is buff-orange to red, from 5-10 mm. thick, and often has a light slip. The associa? tions in the matrix suggest an Islamic date, as they do for the wavy combing. 14 - Incised Loops (fig. 11). There are 20 sherds in this class, of a buff to red fabric 6-14 mm. thick and often with a light slip. Decoration is a single horizontal wavy loop traced with a pointed tool or reed. Most of the sherds are from large bowls or jars. Associations in the matrix are mainly with Islamic wares, but are slightly earlier than the wavy combed deco 454</page><page sequence="29">ration which may derive from the loop pattern. The design is probably Parthian or Sas sanian to Early Islamic in currency. 15 - Incised Complex Designs (fig. 11). There are 8 sherds in this group, 7 of which are in a similar style, and one from Site 4 which appears to be much earlier. The main group are of red, brown or overtired black fabric 6-12 mm. thick, and are decorated with incised saltires, cables, zigzags and lozenges. The designs are unrelated to the Islamic ornament although Dr M. Tosi identifies them as such and the pottery may be that of the Central Asian nomads who came into Afghanistan around the beginning of the Islamic period, such as the Ephthalites (35). Association in the matrix with Islamic wares is not incompatible with this. 16 - Wavy-combing (fig. 11). This group has already been mentioned under group 13. There are 27 sherds in the group, of a pink or buff fabric about 10 mm. thick which may have a light slip. Decoration is by combing of a horizontal wavy loop on the wet clay, with a comb of 8-10 teeth. Most of the sherds are from large bowls and are associated with rolled-over rims with pinched arcading underneath. The associations in the matrix are almost exactly the same as those of group 13, as might be expected, and the ware is firmly dated as Early Islamic. The occurrence of sherds of both pink and buff fabric indicates the change in fashion to use of a buff clay. 17 - Recess-moulding (fig. 14). Mould-made ware in which the design is impressed into the clay so that at first glance it looks like excision or deep stamping. Part of such a mould was found on Site 43. The fabric is a buff clay about 10 mm. thick. This fabric and thick? ness are found in groups 18-20 also, and the consistent increase of about 3 mm. in vessel walls over the redwares may denote slightly more difficulty in working the clay. 6 sherds. 18 - Punctuate-?led Incised Panels (fig. 12). There are 10 sherds in this class all from two sites (3 and 43). They are all of buff fabric 8-9 mm. thick, with a greenish tinge. They are not mould-made, and the greenish clay may be a more workable variety of the buff. Decoration consists of panels outlined by incised lines and filled with myriad punctuations made by jabbing an 8-toothed comb lightly at the clay. They are a local ware of the Ghaz navid period (10th-llth cent. A. D.). 19 - Plain Buff Ware. This class of 60 sherds is the only consistent group of plainwares which could be selected on fabric colour alone. Undoubtedly many of the sherds are the plain parts of vessels whose decorated parts are in groups 17 and 20, and others are plain but contemporary vessels. (35) I am grateful to Dr R. Allchin for this suggestion. 455</page><page sequence="30">20 - Relief-moulding (fig. 15). The fabric is buff as in groups 17-19. The decoration con? sists of complicated designs built up of repeated motifs, each motif in itself complex; most of the motifs are lozenge-shaped or circular, and were carved on the end of a tool which was used to stamp them into the wet clay of the mould in the desired arrangement. The wares are largely Ghaznavid, though they probably persist down to the Mongol invasion. 21 - Ornamented-glazed. A class of 48 sherds with red or buff fabric, ranging from 5-25 mm. thick, mainly from bowls glazed on the inside with an overlap over the rim. They are generally the best dating material for Islamic sites; about two thirds of the Hel mand Valley sample are of identifiable types, and one third of local variants which cannot at present be dated. The most numerous type is Samarkand Ware in black on white with tomato-red spots, of which there are 9 sherds. One sherd from Site 34 has a cradiate flower5 design and a pearly lustre which appear to imitate Ch?n wares of the Sung dynasty (960-1279 A.D.) of China. The best classification for the glazed wares is that used by Gardin for the material recovered by Hackin in Seistan (or that from Laskari B?z?r; but this publica? tion was not available to me when the analysis was being carried out). The following sites have material in those groups: Group A (Samanid-Ghaznavid; 10th-11th cent.): (i) 3, 11, 17, 18, 20, 24?, 37, 41, 44 (ii) 15, 22, 37. Group B (Ghorid and Kwarasmian; late 12th early 13th cent.): (i) 26 (ii) 6, 15 (iii) 16, 21, 22, 28, 37, 43. Undivided: 22, 43. Group C (Timurid; 15th cent.): (ii) 6, 13?, 34?. 16 sherds were not classifiable. Non-homogeneous Groups: (i) Dark-slipped Wares. 39 sherds. Surprisingly this group also lacks site or type orientation. (ii) Painted Wares. 9 sherds. Three appear to be Islamic matt-painted ware. One sherd has ? trickle ? decoration similar to Soghdian wares of the 2nd-4th cent. A.D. A sherd from Site 1 has parallel red stripes on a light sandy fabric; another has a painted design of a type found at Mundigak before period IV, 1 and at Keci Beg and Bampur IV (36). It is the only sherd of prehistoric painted ware found by the expedition. (36) Beatrice de Cardi, personal communication 1967. 456</page><page sequence="31">Small Groups not Included in Analysis: (i) Orange Slip. 4 sherds. Buff fabric. Apparently from small bowls of the Early Islamic period. The ware is the last phase of a development which began in Kushan times with red-slipped wares of group 4 type and continued through the red-slipped buff wares of Samsir Gar 2 and 3 into the Sassanian period. (ii) Textile Print. 1 sherd. Pink fabric 9 mm. thick with many medium-sized grits. The outside of the sherd is smoothed; the inside has the imprint of a textile of loose lXl weave with warps 10/cm. and wefts 13/cm. of a thinner yarn. The vessel was made by filling the textile bag with sand and plastering the outside with clay. From Site 7. (iii) Basket Print. 1 sherd. Buff fabric with a grey surface and the imprint of a basket of simple weave on the inside. The vessel was made in the same way as the textile-lined one except that sand filling may have been unnecessary. APPENDIX II Petroglyphs in Southern Afghanistan This note records a number of rock-engravings discovered in the course of the archaeo? logical reconnaissance in the valley of the Helmand River in 1966. They are on the walls of a man-made cave cut into the sandstone bluffs bounding the eastern side of the flood plain a few kilometres from the village of Safar, some 40 km. downstream from Darwes?n. The cave is about halfway up the rock-face, some 6 m. from the ground, and consists of an outer terrace 5 m. wide and 2 m. deep with an inner chamber reached through a narrow doorway. The marks left by the tools used in excavating the cave are still visible. The engravings are all on the walls of the terrace, which are about 2 m. high, arranged haphazardly without any discernible relationship between them. They include: 1. A gazelle or ibex, 9 cm. long and 7 cm. high, facing to the right (fig. 19). The body is represented by a single thick line, the tail by a vertical stroke. Both horns, swept back, and all four legs are shown, with the feet represented by circular de? pressions. 2. A similar creature, also facing right, 7.5 cm. long and 6 cm. high. The legs are more widely spaced and the feet are not marked. There is a chip out of the rock where the tail should be, and one horn has been removed by a later cup-mark. 3. The outline of a right hand, 12 cm. high, with palm down and part of the forearm 457</page><page sequence="32">attached (fig. 20). This part, 6 cm. long, is divided into eight small rectangles, which could be interpreted as representing the bones of the wrist. 4. A left hand, palm down, with pointed fingers (fig. 21). On the palm is a circle con? taining a cross, and the hand is crossed by a number of lightly-incised lines including what seems to be an upward-pointing arrow between the first and second fingers. There is no evidence as to whether any of these additions are coeval with the hand engraving. 5. A left hand, 20 cm. high, very crudely incised and crossed by a number of lightly scratched lines (fig. 22). 6. A vaguely ^anthropomorphic5 figure 27.5 cm. high, consisting of an inverted CT5 with a triangular projection from each side of the shaft (fig. 24). These are asymmetrical, each containing a circular depression, and are superimposed on an earlier rectilinear grid pattern. 7. A number of deeply cut lines connected by a series of short light strokes suggests a crudely drawn animal, if anything. The lines cover an area of 16 cm. by 10 cm. o 8. An elaborate pattern of rough concentric circles cut by several horizontal lines, and subsequently partially eroded by later markings (fig. 23). A cup-mark is superimposed on the design, and just above it and to the left is a vertical line of cup-marks and bored holes. 9. On another part of the wall are three irregular but roughly vertical lines of bored holes with several others scattered between around them (fig. 25). There are 24 holes alto? gether. These engravings fall into two groups, of linear designs and of cup-marks and bored holes, singly or in groups. Where superimposition occurs the second group is always the later, though by how long it is impossible to say. Of the linear designs only the gazelles or ibex (Nos. 1 and 2) have published parallels elsewhere. These animals are more likely to be gazelles: the curve of the horns is similar, and wild gazelle are still to be found in the area, in the Dast-i Margo adjoining the far side of the valley. The engravings have some stylistic similarities with those reported by Trous dale (37) from the Hindu Kush and an allegedly 2nd millennium B.C. engraving from Tan galy in Soviet Kazakhstan (38). The former, which Trousdale considers to be of recent date from their freshness, show two ibex, with the legs and horns shown individually and the feet marked by circular depressions, and with the body shown by a thick straight line, (37) W. Trousdale, ?Rock-Engravings from the Tang-i Tizao in Central Afghanistan?, EW, XV, 1965, pp. 201-10; p. 206 has a full bibliogra phy of previous publications on Asian petroglyphs. (38) ILN, Sept. 30, 1967, pp. 24 f., fig. 2. 458</page><page sequence="33">although here with a suggestion of volume. The Tangaly engraving also has the legs and horns shown individually and the feet marked by circular depressions, but the body and head are blocked in solidly. Neither of the dates assigned to these engravings is at all certain; those from the Helmand valley may perhaps be placed a little more closely. The cave appears to be an abandoned Buddhist hermitage from its plan, which is similar to several of the Haz?r-Sum caves near Haib?k (39); Mizuno dates these to the end of the Buddhist period or the begin? ning of the Islamic. The plan is less like those of the Rl-H?na caves near Jelalabad, which are of the early Buddhist period. Since southern Afghanistan was early conquered by the Arabs the abandonment of this cave by the Buddhists probably took place by the mid 7th cent. A.D., and its original excavation probably took place not long before. The engravings were therefore made during the last thirteen hundred years. Whether any of the designs have significance, and if so of what kind, we do not know. No analysis of technique or style seems possible or worthwhile: one is a matter of simple incision, the other palpably absent. Norman Hammond (39) S.
