<plain_text><page sequence="1">Giorgio Vasari Florence by ERIKA LANGMUIR it is difficult to imagine a more fitting cel ebration of the quincentenary ofVasari's birth than the exhibition Vasari, gli Uffizi e il Duca, currently on view on the piano nobile of his architectural masterpiece, the Galleria degli Uffizi, Florence (to 30th October). Boldly didactic, it illustrates the whole career of 'lit tle Giorgio from Arezzo' (Fig.83), the policies of his patron, Duke, later Grand-Duke, Cosi mo I de' Medici, the personalities and politics of the latter's court, the governing institutions of Florence before and during his reign, the changes he and Vasari brought about in the urban fabric of Florence, their taste for the Antique, the aims, financing and organisation of the Uffizi's building site, the difficulties encountered, the materials, techniques and instruments used, the role of tradition and innovation in the design, and the edifice's reception and mutations through the cen turies. The catalogue, handsomely produced and avoiding over-reliance on architectural jargon, will be of interest to any Italian-read ing lover of Florence and should remain a resource for scholars and students alike.1 Per haps most importantly, the exhibition sets a new standard for how architectural history is discussed and displayed, emphasising the anthropomorphic nature of this primary art of design, offspring of the union between patron — the 'father' - and architect - the 'mother',2 /#• , CI.

They share the stage with a large supporting cast, including Vasari's opponent Pierfrancesco Riccio, Cosimo's former tutor and all-powerful counsellor, portrayed by Giovanni Battista Naldini (cat. no.II.2). Riccio (1501—64) formed an exclusive 'sect' of Florentine artists to serve the Duke, among them Bronzino, Pontormo and Bandinelli, and more or less tacitly opposed the employment of Vasari. Then there are Vasari's fellow artists at Cosimo's court; his learned friend and advisor Vincenzo Borghini, painted by Vale rio Marucelli (no.III.2). Borghini (1515-80), Benedictine monk and Prior of the Foundling Hospital, collaborated with Vasari on the iconography of the decoration of the Palazzo Vecchio and advised Vasari on the Vite. Final ly there are the military engineer Bernardo Puccini, who in 1561 became the building site's Master of Works (and in contrast to the architect favoured payment by piece-work rather than by the day), and the carpenters, stonemasons and anonymous contadini rec ruited as unskilled labour. Imaginative use is made of sophisticated audio-visual technology in support of the story told by the artefacts on display. Most spectacular are the projections on the long walls of the room leading to Section IX recre ating, with sound effects and quotations, the various phases of demolition and construction on the site, from 1560, when the works began, through to their (provisional) comple tion in 1580, after the deaths of both Cosimo and Vasari. Three-dimensional models clarify Vasari's innovative methods of construction, such as his use of brick arches hidden behind the stone architrave to distribute weight onto the columns. To vary the rhythm and quality of viewing, excellent use is also made of the actual architecture through which the exhi bition unfolds — as for example in Section X, the Empty Room, reconstructing the proportions and materials of a typical inner space as conceived by Vasari and the Duke. Nowhere is this tactic more dramatic than in the loggia overlooking the Arno, where there 82.

As the name indicates, the Uffizi did not originate as an art gallery — that was created in 1581 under Cosimo's heir, Francesco I, when Vasari's open loggia on the second floor was glassed in. Part of Cosimo's daring yet subde strategy for consolidating his absolute rule, the building was designed to house under one roof institutions most of which had had a role in governing Republi can Florence. The location — adjacent to the Palazzo della Signoria, usurped by the Duke in 1540 for use as his own official residence, and looking across the Arno towards Palazzo Pitti, acquired by him as private property in 1549 — would make visible the dominion of Cosimo over these institutions, 'reformed' but not abolished; the uniformity of the building's frontage would symbolise the absence of hierarchical distinctions among them, their equality under his authority. In 1565, on the occasion of the marriage of Cosimo's heir, Francesco, with Joanna of Austria, the Corridoio Vasariano was super imposed on the evolving structure, neigh bouring streets, buildings and the Ponte Vecchio, physically linking the Palazzi Vec chio and Pitti and creating a privileged space from which the Duke could observe his sub jects. Thirteen organisations were compelled by Cosimo to relinquish their existing head quarters and finance the new construction: five of the most important Florentine guilds plus the tribunal of the Mercanzia which adjudicated commercial controversies arising from their activities, and a more variegated group of seven magistratures. While the quarters of these institutions conformed to a unitary model, their differing functions required different amounts of space (see nos.VII.1-3). This is where Vasari's pragmatism as an architect came into play. The facades fronting the elongated courtyard are formed from the repetition of a three bay module, reproduced schematically by Vasari's nephew (Fig.81), and the entrances under the barrel-vaulted portico are each marked by a portal and two flanking windows — but this uniformity is deceptive, for the interior spaces, quasi-independent of the facades, vary in size and remain flexible (see no.VII.i). Indeed, they have changed perimeters and functions many times over the centuries, and partly for this reason attention has focused on Vasari's remarkable designs for the exteriors. Following the example of his hero and friend Michelangelo, Vasari created a totally new type of edifice, combining elements of 700 OCTOBER 201 I • CLIII • THE BURLINGTON MAGAZINE</page><page sequence="3">EXHIBITIONS Florentine tradition with others inspired by, or borrowed from, sources 'antiquely mod ern and modernly antique'.4 The striking contrast of white intonaco with grey pietra serena had been introduced by Brunelleschi and Michelangelo; Roman aqueducts and modern buildings in Rome and Venice, themselves indebted to the Antique, fur nished other models (see pp.214—29). Cosimo himself prescribed the Doric order, as 'safer and sturdier than the others' (p. 110). From an emblem of absolute Medici rule (Fig. 8 2), the UfEzi quickly and lastingly became identified with Florence itself (pp.292-309). Transcending its original functions, threat ened by war, flood, the ravages of time and the assault of visiting millions, the progeny of Cosimo and Vasari has long survived its parents. This exhibition beautifully succeeds in illuminating its patron-father's aims, and above all the talents and the courage of its architect-mother. 1 Catalogue: Vasari, gli Uffizi e il Duca.
