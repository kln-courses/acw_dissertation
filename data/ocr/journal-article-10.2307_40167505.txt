<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BIRDS AND THE BEASTS WERE THERE. By Margaret Millar. New York: Random House, 1967. 241 pp. $5.95. A writer of mystery stories has successfully applied her talents to an appre- ciation of natural history - particularly birds, and a few mammals. It all began</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 75 when a brown towhee was observed attacking its image mirrored in the chrome hubcap of an automobile. The prompt acceptance of a tentative offering of para- keet seed by a towhee and a pair of linnets sparked a diversion that shortly grew into a major activity. The Millar home in a wooded canyon near Santa Barbara, California, eventually became a gathering place for both resident and migrating wild birds in astonishing number and diversity. Learning that nearly 400 kinds of birds occur in that vicinity, Mrs. Millar resolved to make the acquaintance of all of them. Field guides and binoculars were purchased; bird baths, seed hoppers, hummingbird feeders, and foodstuffs in countless varieties were promptly acquired ("Hang the expense," said the proprietor of a pet shop!) and installed on lawn and terrace in strategic places visible from a picture window. And, to the mild amazement of an indulgent husband, a field class in bird study provided by the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History induced extra-early rising and soon brought rewarding contacts and new friends, both avian and human. The varied assemblages of birds accepting the Millars' hospitality and the author's experiences in seeking out less conspicuous kinds of birds in their particu- lar habitats are described with wit and charm; occasional subtle quips and puns brighten the pages. Although wild birds properly receive the most attention, others are not neglected. For example, the story of "Morgan, the pig-headed pigeon," who assumed the role of faithful watchdog but created problems, is told in engaging detail. When describing the behavior of animals for the general reader, it is sometimes difficult to avoid anthropomorphic interpretations. Mrs. Millar handles this problem with restraint; she sees her wild creatures responding to stimuli as wild creatures, and resists the temptation to humanize them unduly, although there are spots where the line is close. Wherever research in natural history was necessary in the preparation of this book, it has been done with care; only a lint-picking zoologist would find fault with the author's ornithology. In her strictures on scientific collecting, Mrs. Millar seems to this reader a bit too severe. Shotgun-ornithology is now practically obsolete in North America, its purpose largely fulfilled; but in special cases it may still be necessary and desirable. We are of course deeply concerned with the preservation of live birds, but dead birds have helped to give us the information on which our modern concepts are based. Our present day bird watchers, sincerely dedicated to the preservation of wildlife in general, are constantly dependant upon the colored drawings of field guides, prepared by artists to whom the bird in the hand - the "very dead bird" in the museum, put there by a collector - is indispensable. The late Louis Agassiz Fuertes, who still has no peer as a delineator of the living bird, used a shotgun when necessary. Basic environmental factors of far-reaching significance should be the major concern of those of us who wish to preserve at least a modicum of North America's once-rich vertebrate fauna. In the last three chapters there is a vivid and suspenseful account of the great Coyote Fire in the autumn of 1964, and its frightful and poignant impact on the region, the vegetation, the wildlife, and the Millars themselves.</page><page sequence="3">76 ARIZONA and the WEST The book has an index of the common names of the birds mentioned. Readers who would attempt to emulate the Millars' success, in part by means of selected plantings, might hope to find in the index the names of trees and shrubs known to have intrinsic attractiveness for birds. And this to publishers: some readers who want to use an index are frustrated and infuriated with page numbers at the inner margins, close to the spine. Howard K.
