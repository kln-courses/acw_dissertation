SHOPTAUGH Louisiana State University AGOOD STATEMENT of general or ultimate objectives of science- teaching is given by the Committee on the Teaching of Science of the Na- tional Society for the Study of Educa- tion in Part I of its Thirty-first Year- book: It [the Committee] recognizes the objec- tives of science teaching to be the functional understanding of the major generalizations of science and the development of associated scientific attitudes.! However, the statement needs some amplification if the beginning teacher is to develop "a functional under- standing." The Thirty-first Yearbook lists various major generalizations of science and, of course, indicates what is meant by "scientific attitudes." This yearbook, along with the So- ciety's Forty-sixth Yearbook," gives in several hundred pages excellent ampli- fication. But the majority of elementary- 1 A Program for Teaching Science, p. 57.

They are teaching other sub- jects in a crowded schedule, and the science work seems to them to be of less importance than reading, arith- metic, and other "basic" subjects. They fail to realize that a student learns to read best by having a desire to learn something through reading, that is, by reading to learn; that a student learns arithmetic, for ex- ample, best by having real problems of his own that he wants to solve. When science is properly taught, arith- metical problems continually emerge and the student's desire to get the correct answer to his own questions creates in him such a disturbed equi- librium that it would be difficult to keep him from reading, provided, of course, that reading materials pertain- ing to science and within his range of ability are available. Science, properly taught, will deal with the child as a whole personality, intellectual and social, and will stimulate him gen- erally in all fields of endeavor both in school and out of school. Getting children to read about science is only a small part of science-teaching. 467</page><page sequence="2">468 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL [April SCIENCE: A WAY OF LIVING The place of science in the elemen- tary school should be so well planned and learning so well directed that sci- ence will function with the child as a way of living, as a mode of interpret- ing the world, and as a way of reacting to the environment. Science, there- fore, is not just small content material to be learned but results in large out- comes which may be emerging con- stantly in one's life as a result of the interaction of the individual with his environment in an age of science. So conceived, science is not simply a col- lection of facts about the various forces, materials, and phenomena of nature; it is a method of behavior. Science in the elementary school should be divorced from all forms of anthropomorphism, sentimentalism, superstition, animism, emotionalism, prejudice, and unfounded opinion. The child should be encouraged to question the reliability of all sources of information. Checking the- reliability of all written and oral reports must have precedence over all other ques- tions or problems. It is not enough in the education of children to see that prejudices and other unscientific ele- ments are eradicated from the in- struction; children should be made clearly aware that these elements are unreliable. They should come to recognize that scientific methodology is one of the greatest discoveries of mankind and to appreciate the im- portance of basing their behavior and responsibility to society upon truth, in so far as truth is obtainable, rather than upon emotion and prejudice. Learning content is a means, not an end. It attaches meaning to the ex- periences of life and is valuable only in so far as it meets the needs of the child and society. Learning content is also necessary to achieve certain social objectives. In the teaching of science, it is im- portant to provide children with op- portunity to grow in appreciation and understanding of the basic scientific concepts of modern life. The children should be allowed to have experiences which will help them to gain increas- ing understanding of, and control over, these concepts. In a sense, a scientific concept is never mastered or completed at any level of childhood or adulthood. Still, it can become a part of the whole learning process. It can give enrichment to experiences; it takes what otherwise might be casual and unimportant experiences, both within and outside the classroom, and integrates them into a total picture or pattern. This pattern is not a temporary or artificial one, for it is based on the very nature of the universe, as far as the child is able to understand it. Therefore, children may continue through life to integrate learning ac- cording to these same general pat- terns and to interpret new experiences in their light. Each experience be- comes a part of a larger configuration, a pattern, a perspective, and a key to the interpretation of man's problem of utilizing nature and natural forces for his own welfare. Emphasis should be on interpretative experiences con- tributing to growth in understanding</page><page sequence="3">1952] TEACHING SCIENCE IN ELEMENTARY SCHOOL 469 of concepts which have had profound influence upon modern thought and activities and upon the development of better citizenship. Therefore stress should be placed upon action rather than upon the mere learning of facts. TEACHING SCIENTIFIC CONCEPTS The principle of proceeding slowly in teaching should be constantly ob- served. Children must have time to live with an idea. Progress in under- standing will not come from an ac- cumulation of ideas but through their gradual unfolding in the minds of the children. Children will teach themselves to a great extent if allowed to proceed un- hurriedly and uninterruptedly when occupied with materials that are real. They need to have opportunity to play with what is before them, to try it in various combinations and under various circumstances, to show one another what they find, and to co- operate in discovering new meanings. They should be able to explore and reach conclusions, even if the conclu- sions are wrong and must be corrected. Their thoughts should have time to wander to appreciations and meanings which a cursory glance would not find. It is important that children have a good feeling toward the content and the problems of a given area as they move on to new problems. In science, a topic can never be mastered or finished, for there is always something more to be learned. The children should not have the feeling that the subject has been exhausted and that they will have no further problems in that area. Rather, they should have an active realization that a wide range of scientific problems remains for study in their later education, many of which can be studied for their social significance or developed into hobbies. The interest engendered in the prob- lems should remain active for a long time, possibly a lifetime, reviving with current events and new developments in the classroom, community, or world at large. INTEGRATED STUDIES An integrated program of studies is needed in the school. Too many separate categories in the lower grades are not conducive to social activity and normal growth. Many separate subjects probably tend to disperse rather than to integrate activity, and to arrest rather than stimulate chil- dren's natural development. Happily, the trend today is distinctly toward organizing instruction in the form of activity units. Because such a large part of the active interests of children involves exploring the natural and scientifically explained environment, elementary science should be one of the chief subjects in such an integrated pro- gram. It is generally conceded that the purposes of science-teaching in the elementary school can best be realized by the unit method. In the large work unit, the teacher can make provisions for differences in needs, interests, and abilities. The term "unit of work" is used to designate the various experi- ences and activities that grow out of, center in, and contribute to, a chosen</page><page sequence="4">470 THE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL JOURNAL area of learning. It involves reading, questioning, problem-solving; collect- ing and organizing pertinent informa- tion; experimenting, constructing, drawing conclusions from data col- lected; presenting facts dramatically; and interpreting them by pictures, graphs, and music. The experiences in- volved are dynamic, each leading on and out to other experiences. New information is gained, and new in- sights, viewpoints, and possibilities open up continually as the experiences develop. The experiences are educa- tive and result in the acquisition of useful information and the develop- ment of desirable skills, attitudes, and appreciations. When a unit of work is properly conducted, the children gain skill in democratic living through being given the opportunity to assume responsibil- ity for participating, planning, execut- ing, and evaluating learning activities. They have experiences in making choices, taking turns, assuming re- sponsibilities, working in small groups, and giving and accepting suggestions. Attention is given to courtesy, sports- manship, and control. The right of each child to express himself is ac- centuated. Each is encouraged to feel responsible for contributions. Praise is given for critical thinking, good judg- ment, and consideration of others. Emphasis centers upon the child's own activities, not only upon his search for information and enlighten- ment, but also upon his efforts to plan an enterprise and to evaluate the sig- nificance of his work. A vast amount of information is obtained through this procedure, far more than usually results from the memorization-recitation type of teaching. More important, however, is the fact that this information, being obtained as a result of purpose- ful activities, is meaningful to the child and becomes an integral part of his nature. Such essential social atti- tudes as co-operation, wholehearted participation, social mindedness, and resourcefulness are developed through a variety of activities based upon the child's interests, abilities, and felt needs. These are the attitudes and interests that are essential for success- ful day-to-day living and for the uncertain future.</page></plain_text>
