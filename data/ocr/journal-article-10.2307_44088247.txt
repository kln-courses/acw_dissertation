<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT CIRCUMCISION IN THE LIGHT OF THE PRIESTLY ' ôt ETIOLOGIES * Circumcision is one of the most ancient rites known to man and still practiced today. It was and is found in many parts of the world - in West Asia, Africa, the Americas, and Oceania. Yet until modern times the rite has engendered little theoretical speculation about its meaning. Few of the peoples practicing it offer any explanation of its origins or rationale for its practice. Thus modern scholars are unable to offer a definite explanation of the pur- pose (or purposes) of this rite. Among the suggestions offered by scholars starting with Herodotus (n 37) and Philo (De spec. Leg. i 2-11) are the following: hygiene, preparation for sexual life, obvia- tion of peril from sexual relations, test of endurance, tribal mark, sacrifice, sanctification of the generative faculties, social distinction, to increase sexual pleasure, to limit sexual pleasure, to facilitate reincarnation, mark of subjection, initiation 1. The explanations of the meaning of circumcision for ancient Israel have been almost as numerous, for the sources of information (mainly Gen., xvii; Ex., iv, 24 f.; Josh., v, 2-9) offer little aid in this regard. * I wish to thank Prof. Menahem H aran tor reading and criticizing this study.

FOX The most important of these sources is the priestly etiology of cir- cumcision, Gen.j xvii, 1-14. Here alone are we given any explanation of the meaning of circumcision; we are told that circumcision is an *ôt berît , a "sign of the covenant" (vs. 11). But how is it a sign of the covenant? For whom is it a sign - God, Israel, or foreign peoples? What is the function of this sign? What does it signify, and what does it accomplish? The meaning of this phrase is far less transparent than scholars often appear to think. Circumcision in P has been interpreted in many ways. Von Rad says that "... circumcision is only the act of appropriation, of witness to the revelation of God's salvation, and the sign of its acceptance" (pp. 195 f.). Procksch tells us that "dies Zeichen ist das Organ, in das die mi gefasst ist, wie das Wasser bei der Taufe, ohne das sie gar nicht wirklich wäre" (p. 519). For Skinner circumcision is "an external mark of the invisible bond which united every Jew to Yahweh." Skinner, like many if not most commentators following Wellhausen2, explains that the great importance P attaches to cir- cumcision is a product of the exile experience, when the suspension of the cult gave fresh emphasis to rites that can be observed by the individual, and further, that there was need for the circumcision to distinguish Jews from their heathen neighbors (pp. 296 ff.). Accor- ding to J. Licht3, *ôt berît means a symbolic act which contains a sort of proof of the making of the covenant, i.e., proof that the cir- cumcised individual is included in the congregation of men to whom the laws and rights apply. Thus circumcision serves as a means of uniting the special covenantal society. Heinisch says that "die Be- schneidung sollte die Israeliten immer aufs neue in die Pflicht erinnern, die sie durch den Bund mit Gott diesen gegenüber auf sich genommen hatten..." (p. 239). This is but a sampling of opinions. The great variety of interpreta- tions alone indicates the difficulty in understanding the concept. But few commentators offer any systematic argumentation for their interpretations. Most seem to consider the phrase "sign of the cove- nant" self-explanatory. This study is an attempt to approach systematically the meaning of this "sign of the covenant" in the context of the priestly yot - etiologies. We are not concerned with the "original", "real", meaning of circumcision so much as with the meaning given it in P. Our purpose dictates the plan of this study, which is a progressive narrowing- * J. Wellhausen, Prolegomena, New York, 1885 (1961), p. 341. 8 J.

While each part prepares the way for the next, I consider the first two parts as goals in themselves, for there is need for both a fresh look at the word 'ôt and a fuller study of P's 'óť-etiologies. Some of my statements will be better understood if I explain that I accept Kaufmann's relative dating of P as preceding D. 4 But I do not think that my conclusions are dependent upon this hypothesis, and I have tried to avoid basing arguments on any hypothesis of the relative dating of D and P. On the other hand, the conclusions them- selves may afford some evidence on behalf of an early dating for P, because it is improbable that such a deliberate and systematic attempt as P's to eliminate the magical and mythical significance of certain cultic and natural phenomena would have been necessary in the postexilic period. The process in P that I will describe is carried further in D. That is not to say that there is a linear development from P to D, but that this process, so manifest and important in D, is present, but to a lesser degree, in P. I. - THE MEANINGS OF 'Ôt. The most comprehensive examination of the meaning and functions of the 'ôt is that of C.A. Keller, Das Wort OTH als "Offenbarungs- zeichen Gottes" (Basel, 1946), and our investigation of this word must begin with a consideration of this work, which has been the basis for most subsequent studies of the 'ôt. Keller's study proceeds from the question : "Welches ist der Ort im Leben und Denken der Israeli- ten, an welchem der Begriff oth seinen Ursprung hat ?," or : "Welches ist die Lebenssphäre, aus der er, seiner Eigenart nach, stammt?" (p. 6). This starting question is misleading. First of all, it assumes that 4 Y. Kaufmann, Toledot Ha-Emunah Ha-Yisraelit , I, Tel Aviv, 1954, pp. 23-220; in the abridged translation of M. Greenberg, The Religion of Israel , Chicago, 1960: chap. v. See also M. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy and the Deuteronomio School , Oxford, 1972, pp. 179-243. Weinfeld argues that the concern for demythologization and secularization is much greater in D than in the earlier sources - including P. M. Haran has shown the antiquity of the cultic conceptions and traditions of P which, while in part Utopian, evidence an antiquity greater than that of D. The Tabernacle legend goes back to Shilo, which is to say that the priestly tradition had a pre-Jerusalemite origin (M. Haran, Shilo and Jerusalem , in JBL , LXXXI, 1962, pp. 14 ft.), and the phenomenology of the cult described in P evinces high antiquity (Idem, The complex of ritual acts perfonned inside the Tabernacle , in Scripta H ierosolymitanay VIII, 1961, pp. 272 ff.). The Ark, of central importance in P, was probably removed by Manasseh and never restored (Idem, The disappearance of the Ark , in IEJ , XIII, 1963, pp. 46 ft.). See also Idem, Priests and priesthood , in Ency. Judaica , XIII, col. 1069 ff.</page><page sequence="4">560 MICHAEL V. FOX there is a place in the life and thought of ancient Israel in which this "concept" originated. But *ot is a word, not a concept, until it is applied to an area of thought. It does not come from a "sphere of life", but is applied to certain realities or ideas in a sphere of life - or spheres of life. It is true that certain technical words are created in specific areas of human activity, but it is misleading to start with the presupposition that a certain word, especially one with as broad a usage as 5oi, was created in one such area of activity. Far more fre- quently - and this is certainly the case with *ôt - a word in common usage is applied to certain concepts in various areas of thought and activity, and only then may we say that the word expresses a cer- tain concept. The assumption that we must work back to a single, common Sitz for all usages of the word (except later developments in which the original meaning of the word "degenerates") prejudicially forces one to find a single Sitz in the socio-religious sphere of life for the various uses of the word. Having assumed that he will find a single Sitz for this "concept", Keller proceeds to show that *ôt is usually associated in some way with God or a god and concludes that yôt is originally a "religious" concept, whose true function is within the realm of intercourse bet- ween God and man (p. 14). In particular, *ôt is originally and essen- tially an oracle or revelation sign by which God makes his will known to his people (p. 114, i.a.). Other writers have dealt with this conclu- sion 6 and have shown that *ôt is a term, not essentially "religious", that may be applied in many spheres of life and thought, including revelation. N.H. Tur-Sinai6 has tried to prove a thesis similar to Keller's: that *ât is a miraculous sign from God. Now this is indeed one of the meanings of • ot , but it should not be imposed on all occurrences of the word nor should it be assumed that this is the essential and original meaning just because it is the most frequent. It is true that most 'âtõt in the Bible have a "religious" context, i.e., are in some way directly or indirectly associated with God, but this may be due to the fact that most of the Bible has a religious context, so that there are simply more opportunities to speak of signs with a religious func- tion than of signs with a secular function. *ot is no more essentially religious than dãbãr , which also may be applied to divine relevation. The proper procedure in investigating the semantic range of a 6 W. Zimmerli, in TZ, V, 1949, pp. 374 ft. ; Rengstorf, in TWNT VII, pp. 207 fT. ; Helfmeyer, in TWAT 1/2, col. 184 f. • N. H. Tur-Sinai, Ha-LaSon veHa-Sefer, III, Jerusalem, 1955, pp. 121 flf.</page><page sequence="5">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 561 word is to analyze the various ways it functions in specific contexts. This range of functions constitutes the meaning of the word. Any sense common to the various usages is a lexical abstraction and should not be identified with an original meaning nor associated with a Sitz im Leben . Now Keller does offer a categorization of the meanings of *ot - after having reached a conclusion about the essential, original meaning of the "concept". His categorization is as follows (pp. 49 ff.): 1. Prophetic symbolic actions; e.g., Ezek ., iv, 1-3. 2. An everyday circumstance, insignificant in itself, which is given greater significance by being designated in advance as an *ot. There is no inner correspondence between the sign and its meaning; e.g., I Sam ., xiv, 8-10. 3. Events foretold by the prophet on behalf of Yahweh which are designated as &gt; ôtôt ; e.g., I Sam., x. 4. Future events foretold and designated as *ôtôt , but directly by Yahewh, without prophetic mediation; e.g., Ex., in, 12. 5. Heavenly signs, e.g., stars and the rainbow, not amazing in themselves, but regarded in antiquity as a means of divine revelation. 6. Cultic practice or apparatus; e.g., circumcision, Sabbath, altar cover, the altar in Egypt (Is., xix, 19 f.). 7. An event of the Salvation History or an object reminiscent thereof; e.g., the twelve stones from the Jordan (Josh., iv, 6). 8. A mark of shame and godlessness; e.g., Beut., xxviii, 46, Ezek., xiv, 8. 9. Field-signs (Num., n, 2, Ps., lxxiv, 4), which are supposedly symbols of divinity and thereby say something about the nature of the god. This categorization lacks an organizing principle. Some signs are categorized in accordance with who announces them ( 3, 4), others by their location ( 5), others by their meaning for Israelite historio- graphy ( 7), others by virtue of their negative valuation ( 8), others by virtue of their being what they are, i.e., by no distinct ordering principle ( 9). Furthermore, Keller'r categorization lacks distinctness of compartmentalization. If some signs are included in group 6 by virtue of their cultic function, why not put the twelve stones from the Jordan and the field-signs there as well? Is not the altar and Massebah in Egypt (Is., xix, 19 f.) also an event foretold by the prophet on behalf of Yahweh ( 3)? Now such categorizations of the uses of a word are not to be judged true or false. The categorization is not inherent in the material itself, but is our way of understanding and ordering phenomena. The cri- terion for the validity of such categorizations is not their truth, but their heuristic utility. The utility of this type of analysis is determined by its clarity, consistency, and distinctness of compartmentalization. REVUE BIBLIQUE 36</page><page sequence="6">562 MICHAEL Y. FOX Perfect consistency and distinctness of compartmentalization are perhaps impossible to attain, but this is the desideratum. In order to achieve greater utility in a semantic analysis, it is necessary to select an ordering principle that can apply to all the uses of the word in question. A satisfactory starting definition of 'oř, which would seem to cover all uses of the word, is given by I DB (article "Sign"): "A mark, symbol, or portent, serving to convey a particular idea or meaning." This definition correctly emphasizes the function of the sign - to convey a particular idea or meaning. That is to say, a sign's purpose is to affect in some way cognition or emotion. Thus our division into categories should proceed by analyzing this function, viz., the ways in which the signs serve to convey meaning. This criterion gives us three main categories: (1) proof signs (2) symbol signs, and (3) cognition signs (subdivided into identity signs and mnemonic signs). I believe that these meanings are well compart- mentalized, though the possibility of varying interpretations of the verses in question may cause uncertainty as to which category the particular *ot belongs in. 1. Proof signs, whose purpose is to convirá. ; the onlooker of the truth of a certain proposition which might be in doubt. Some proof signs convince by virtue of their miraculous nature, e.g., the events of the Exodus and the reversing of the sundial (Is., xxxviii, 7 f.). For other proof signs, the persuasive factor lies in the prediction of the occurrence. The death of Eli's two sons in one day (I Sam,., n, 34) is not in itself miraculous, but the fact that it has been predicted beforehand will prove the veracity of the rest of Samuel's prophecy on the House of Eli. Likewise the Philistines' words, *'come up to us" (I Sam., xiv, 10), are a proof sign that God will give the Philistines into the hands of Jonathan's band because of the improbability that in the natural course of events the Philistines would say precisely the words arbitrarily chosen in advance by Jonathan. In most cases, proof signs obtain their compelling nature by virtue of their improb- ability - they [involve occurrences that could not be expected in the normal course of events. Only in Job, xxi, 29 does the persua- siveness seem to consist in the fact of firsthand experience alone. 2. Symbol signs, which stand for or represent something else by virtue of resemblance or conventional association. (We are using "symbol" in a limited sense.) Most of the symbol signs in the Bible represent something else by virtue of resemblance. They do not prove that the represented event will occur, but serve to make that event vivid to the consciousness by translating it into actions. In other</page><page sequence="7">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 563 words, these signs are a statement translated into representative actions 7. So that there will be no doubt as to their meaning, they are followed by a verbalization of the statement. Thus Ezekiel's model siege of Jerusalem ( Ezek ., iv) resembles and so represents the coming actual siege of Jerusalem. 3. Cognition signs, whose purpose is to awaken knowledge of something in the observer. They are not intended to prove a proposi- tion, nor do they function as a representational "translation" of a verbal statement. Cognition signs may be subdivided into two closely related subcategories, identity signs and mnemonic signs. They are closely related, for a sign can serve to awaken memory of identity. a. Identity signs mark something as belonging to a certain cate- gory. The scarlet cord in Josh ., n, 12 is not proof that the Israelites will spare Rahab's family, but rather serves to identify Rahab's house as the one to be spared. Cain's sign marks him as one under the spe- cial protection of God (Gen., iv, 15). Its purpose is to make Cain tabu, but it functions by identifying him. The banners in the Israelite camp identify the various families (Num., n, 2). b. Mnemonic signs bring to consciousness something already known (which may or may not have been forgotten). Mnemonic signs are distinguished from identity signs in two ways: first, they do not simply indicate identity (x is y), and second, they renew cognizance but do not create it. An identity sign such as the scarlet thread in- stills new knowledge: it shows the conquering Israelites that this par- ticular house is protected - something they could not know in advance. Likewise, Cain's sign communicates knowledge new to the observer - the fact that this particular man is in the class of the divinely protec- ted. But a mnemonic sign, even when this is not stated explicitly, restores to the awareness of the observer something he could know otherwise and in fact could be expected to have known in the past. Thus the rainbow reminds God of his covenantal promise not to destroy the world by flood again. The rainbow neither imparts new knowledge by identifying something as belonging to a certain class, nor does it in itself symbolize the non-destruction of the world, nor does it even serve as evidence that God will not again bring a des- troying flood (this is the usual interpretation), for it is explicitly stat- 7 G. Fohrer, Die symbolischen Handlungen der Propheten , Zürich, 1953, shows how sym- bolic acts were transferred from the realm of magic to the realm of communication (chap. iv). He argues that the prophets regarded their symbolic actions as effective in bringing about the symbolized events, because they are expressions of God's will and derive their efficacy from his power (pp. 114 ff.).</page><page sequence="8">564 MICHAEL V. FOX ed that it is God who observes this sign (Gen., ix, 16), and evidence is not intended to convince the one who makes a statement, but the one who hears it. A mnemonic sign is a zikkãrôn, a reminder (see below, p. 28 f.). We may now proceed to classify the various occurrences of ' ôt in accordance with this categorization, leaving Gen., xvii out of consi- deration for the time being. Again I would stress that individual cases are open to varying interpretations, and this could affect the classi- fication of the specific occurrences, but it would not alter the basic semantic categorization of the meanings of the word 'ôt. In the following I will also comment on the functions of the various signs in their contexts. These comments are in the realm of exegesis, not semantics. By this I mean, for example, that it does not change the meaning of the word ' ôt if it is God who announces it rather than the prophet, or if it is God who is reminded rather than man. 1. Proof signs. a. Proof by means of the miraculous nature of the event designated as sign: The 'ôtôt ûmôpHîm 8 in Egypt and the Exodus were intended as proof of God's power and presence in history. This proof was directed both at Egypt (cf. Ex., viii, 18; vii, 3-5) and - more impor- tantly - at Israel (cf. Num., xiv, 11 and Deuteronomy's emphasis that the signs were performed "before our eyes", Deut., vi, 22, i.a.). These signs are supposed to induce knowledge (Ex., viii, 18; vii, 3-5) and belief (Num., xiv, 11). In this group belong Ex., vii, 3; viii, 19; X, 1,2; Num., xiv, 11, 22; Deut., iv, 34; vi, 22; vii, 19; xi, 3; xxvi, 8; xxix, 2; xxxiv, 11; Josh., xxiv, 17; Jer., xxxii, 20 (includes signs "in Israel and in man"); xxxii, 21; Ps., lxxviii, 43; cv, 27®; cxxxv, 9; Neh., ix, 10. Closely related to this group is Ps., lxv, 9, where the reference is to God's wondrous acts in general. A similar use is Is., lv, 13, where God's restoration of Israel and the revitalization of nature are to stand as eternal proof of God's glory and power. Is., lxvi, 19 is rather obscure, but it seems to be related to the use • môpët is apparently synonymous with 'oí. It is used most frequently in deuteronomio material, where it means "wonder." The phrase is translated in Daniel (vi, 28 ; iii, 32 f.) as âtîn w*timhin, showing that môpêt is understood as "wonder," but this is not its only mean- ing. In Is., xx, 3 it is a symbol sign, as in Is., viii, 18. That is its sense in Ezek., xii, 6, 11 and apparently also in Zsech ., m, 8 (Mitchell). Ezek., xxiv, 24, 27 are unclear. It may be that its original meaning was "wonder" (no satisfactory etymology has been offered) and that it developed a wider semantic range by association with 'oí. • Note the phrase dibrê iuVôtôt: the signs "speak," i. e., communicate - not only amaze; cf. also Ex., iv, 8 f.</page><page sequence="9">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 565 in Is., lv, 13. Some of the foreign peoples will see God's glory, mani- fest in his miraculous redemption of Israel and judgment of the nations (vs. 18). God will place an &gt;ôt (1 Q Is. A : yôtôt) among the survivors of the judgment and send them to report to peoples who have not known God's glory. Here the events of the redemption are not in themselves *ôtôt, because the survivors cannot actually take the events with them, but as firsthand witnesses they will, in a sense bear these events with them and testify to God's power among the peoples, to whom they are sent. Alternatively, the *ôt here may be a separate wonder, not made explicit, that will persuade the nations of God's power (Duhm), cf. li, 4-6. This passage is linked with xlv, 20-25, where the survivors of the judgment are invited to participate in salvation, for they have witnessed the amazing events that were predicted long ago (Westermann). The wonders that Moses is to perform at the beginning of his mis- sion in Egypt are intended to prove that God has sent him and thus bring the people to believe in him (Ex., iv, 8, 9, 17, 28, 30). Gideon asks for proof - an *ôt - that it is God who is speaking to him ( Judg ., vi, 17). The proof sign given Hezekiah is also of miraculous nature, but it has the added force of prediction (II Kings, xx, 8, 9; Is., xxxviii, 7, 22). In Ps., lxxxvi, 17 it seems that the psalmist is asking for a wondrous sign that would convince his enemies that God is with him. b. Proof by means of prediction : I Sam., ii, 34; x, 7, 9; xiv, 10 discussed above, belong to this class. To this we may add II Kings, xix, 29 (= Is., xxxvii, 30); Jer., xliv, 29; Is., vii, 11 and vii, 14. (However one may interpret the sign of the 'alma, it appears to be basically a prediction of a future event.) The altar and massebah in Egypt (Is., xix, 19 f.) may belong here. The question is whether the force of this sign lies in its having been foretold by Isaiah, or in its serving by itself as a reminder to the Egyptian exiles of God's saving power, in which case it is a mne- monic sign. According to Deut., xxviii, 46, the fulfilled curses will stand for all times as proof of God's righteous intervention and judgment (cf. Driver). Tribulations in and of themselves could not prove this; they serve as evidence because they were stated in advance, at the time of the giving of the covenant. The signs of the false prophet in Deut., xiii, 2, 3 are also predictive signs, as is shown by vs. 3 : "... and that sign or portent (môpêt) which he told to you comes to pass ( û-bâ*)."</page><page sequence="10">566 MICHAEL V. FOX Ex., m, 12 is difficult because the sign ("when you bring the people forth from Egypt you will worship God on this mountain") will come about after the need for it is over, for it is intended to prove to Moses that "it is I who have sent you". It may be that the original sign is now missing from the text (von Rad), but as the text stands this 'ôt is a sort of predictive proof. Ps., lxxiv, 9 is also unclear. But it seems that the clause "there is no longer any prophet" gives the reason for the statement "we have not seen our signs". This means that the ' ôtôt in question are prophetic predictive proof signs. The commun- ity wants a sign proving that things will take a turn for the better. In Job, xxi, 29, Job is arguing that the wicked do not suffer the consequences of their deeds, and tells his companions not to deny the ' ôtôt of the wayfarers. These 'ôtôt must be the firsthand testimony of the experienced travellers that the wicked are spared punishment. Here the 'ôt is testimony rather than actual proof. 2. Symbol signs. Acts of prophetic symbolism are 'ôtôt, thus Is., xx, 3 and Ezek., iv, 3. Certainly other prophetic acts which are not called 'ôtôt could have been so designated, e.g., I Sam., xv, 27 f.; II Kings, xiii, 15-19; Jer., xxvii, 2-12. A person or nation can be an 'ôt in that ¡his condition resembles and represents a certain situation; e.g., Ezek., xiv, 8 (Ie' ôt welim šālim where m* šālim defines what kind of an 'ôt they will be - a symbol sign that serves as a watchword). Isaiah (Is., viii, 18) says that he and his children are 'ôtôt and môpetîm in Israel from Yahweh. Now the importance of Isaiah's children in his prophecy lies in their significative names, Shear-Yashub (vii, 3) and Maher-Shalal-Hash-Baz (viii, 3 f.). Isaiah's name too (yiSa'yahû, "Yahweh is salvation") is significant in this prophecy10. Thus he and his sons are signs in that their names bear a symbolic resemblance to certain situations prophesied by Isaiah. Harder to place are Is., xliv, 25, which refers to the 'ôtôt of soothsayers (reading D"na = bārā for DH3, see the commenta- ries) and Jer., x, 2, which refers to the signs of the heavens, where the intention is apparently to divination signs. It is difficult to place this usage in our categorization because it is derived from a system of thought alien to Israel. Divination signs may be considered symbol signs because they are events or things that represent something else, but not by virtue of resemblance, but by convention. It is decided for 10 See Kaiser's comments on Js., viii, 16-18; xii, 3-6.</page><page sequence="11">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 567 various reasons (primarily observations of the supposed congruence between the signs and certain types of events) that a certain astro- nomical occurrence represents a certain future event in the human world, so that the astronomical occurrence communicates informa- tion by symbolically representing a type of event. These differ from proof signs based on prediction in that the proof signs are evidence for a proposition one is obliged to believe in the present, while these divination signs simply give information about the future which would be otherwise unobtainable. Prophets use proof signs to demon- strate something they themselves know, whereas divination signs give the prophet knowledge. In Israelite thought these signs are transferred to the realm of identity signs (Gen., i, 14). 3. Cognition signs. a. Identity signs. Gen., iv, 15; Num., ii, 2, and Josh., n, 12 have been discussed above (p. 7). We may add Gen., i, 14, according to which the heavenly luminaries are to serve l&amp;ôtôt ú-l^mó^ádím, "as signs of the fixed time-periods" (cf. Speiser). These signs do not create the mô^&amp;dim, but merely identify them. Ps ., lxxiv, 4 seems to refer to military banners (Kraus) and so belongs here. The blood of the pascal lamb (Ex., xii, 13) identifies the houses of the Israelites (see below, p. 18). b. Mnemonic signs. Ex., xiii, 9, "And it [sc. the eating of mazzot] shall be for you for a sign upon your hands and a reminder [ zikkãrôn ] between your eyes (so that the law [tôrâ] of Yahweh may be in your mouth) that Yah- weh brought you forth from Egypt with a strong hand," and Ex., xiii, 16, "And it [sc. the dedication of the firstborn] shall be for a sign [&gt;&amp;] upon your hands and for frontlets [tôtãpôt] between your eyes, that the Lord brought you forth with a strong hand from Egypt." These verses, or parts of them, have been variously ascribed to J, E u, Rp, and Rd. For our purposes it is sufficient to identify them as JE, but the words l*ma'an tihye tôrat YHWH bepíkã (vs. 9) are an editorai addition 12. They are missing in vs. 16 and they disturb the 11 Suggested by M. Haran, The Passover sacrifice , in SVTt XXIII, 1972, p. 105. 1S Carpenter and Harford, The Hexateuch , London, 1900, take xiii, 2-16 as J with various additions. They regard xiii, 9a as the addition of Rp and vs. 16 as the addition of a later Rö, but 9a cannot be distinguished from 16. Their main evidence for Rp in 9 is the expression tôrat YHWH , which occurs nowhere else in the Hexateuch.

FOX syntax : "that Yahweh brought you forth from Egypt" is a natural continuation of 9a" (thus in 16), but is incongruent as a continuation of "so that the law of Yahweh may be in your mouth," whether ki means "that" or "because." Underlying JE's statement is a reference to actual apotropaic devices18. But JE is hardly advising the use of actual apotropaic devices here14. JE is saying that the rites in question should function as mnemonic signs ('ôt/ /zikkãrôn) remind- ing Israel that God redeemed them from Egypt with a strong hand. JE opens this section (xiii, 3-16) with a command to remember this day because on it God brought Israel out of bondage "with a strong hand," and appends, as it were, the command to avoid eating leaven as the consequence of the command to remember the day: "no leaven- ed bread shall be eaten" (vs. 3). After the injunction concerning the eating of mazzot he instructs Israel to tell future generations of God's mighty saving acts in Egypt (vs. 8). The didactic importance of the dedication of the first-born as preserving the awareness of Yah- weh's "strong hand" is stressed in vs. 14. These &gt;ôtôt are not proof signs because in their specific contexts they do not serve as evidence of God's power, but as reminders thereof. D is apparently dependent on JE's usage in Deut ., vi, 8 and xi, 18, where &gt;ôt is used in the sense of mnemonic sign, but with a difference : in D the words of the Torah themselves have the mnemonic function. For Deuteronomy, as for wisdom literature, memory - which is indis- tinguishable from learning in ancient pedagogy - is a goal in itself. The twelve stones from the Jordan are to serve as a sign in the midst of Israel reminding all generations that God split the Jordan before the Ark (Josh., iv, 6 f.). Vs. 7b (in the third person) explains the function of the ' ôt prescribed (in the second person plural) in 6-7a. The rainbow (Gen., ix, 12, 13, 17) is explicitly a mnemonic sign (cf. vss. 15 f.). The altar-covering made out of the censers of Korach's band (Num., xvii, 3) is designated as a zikkãrôn, a reminder (vs. 5) to outsiders of the danger of approaching the altar. While it is not stated explicitly, Aaron's rod (Num., xvii, 25) also serves as a remind- er that Yahweh has given the Aaronides a special position (vs. 20). mistie phraseology (II Kings , x, 31). The words Dma'an tihye tôrat YHWH bepíkã are there fore more likely a deuteronomistic addition. The deuteronomist is concerned with the importance of the people speaking the words of God's Torah (Deut., vi, 7; xi, 19). u Cf. E. Speiser, Pãlil and Congeners : a sampling of apotropaic symbols, in Assyriological Studies, XVI, 1965, pp. 391-393. 14 The tautology that Weinfeld (Deuteronomy, pp. 301 f.) finds in xiii, 9 if "sign" and "reminder" are to be taken figuratively - "you will always keep it in mind so that the teach- ing of the Lord may be in your mouth" - is present only in the verse as it stands with the , addition in 9*3.</page><page sequence="13">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 569 Reading 7e'oi for lesisit in Num., xv, 39 (see below, p. 22 f.), we find another clear mnemonic sign, the fringe on the garment, which is intended to remind one of God's commandments. Thus all the 'oíoí in P (with the exception of Ex., vii, 3, which is using an old formula) are cognition signs: the luminaries, the rainbow, the blood of the pascal lamb, the Sabbath, the family standards, the fringe, the altar cover, and Aaron's rod. We will turn now to an inves- tigation of the meaning of these signs in P. The circumcision too, as we shall see below, is a cognition sign - in particular, a mnemonic sign. II. - THE 'di-ETioLOGiEs in P. The concentration of P's 'oidi in the category of cognition signs is not accidental. The ' ôtôt in P are part of a definite schema of consider- able significance for the understanding of his theology. B. Long 15 has analyzed the form of the priestly 'oí schema and identified it as significative etiology. According to Long, only Gen., ix, 13; xvii, 11; Ex., xxxi, 13, 17 and Num., xvii, 3 "bring together conceptually a specific object designated as &gt;ôt and the quality of timeless permanence. Only these passages now pertain to etiology." 16 Long says that two other passages, Ex., xii, 13 and Num., xvi), 25, have a similar pat- tern, but these lack the quality of timeless permanence and so do not belong in the schema. In fact, however, as we shall see, Ex., xii, 13 does have the quality of "timeless permanence" and is quite in line with this etiological schema, and Num., xvii, 25 is at least tangen- tially related to it. Long finds the necessary qualities also in Ex., xiii, 9, 16 and Josh., iv, 6, but investigates them separately as part of a "mixed-form," the question-answer schema 17. Ex., xiii, 9, 16 are indeed different formally from the P 'oí schema. In addition to the factor mentioned by Long, they lack the type of purpose clause pre- sent in the other priestly 'ôí-etiologies (except for Gen., xvii, see below, Part III). But insofar as these verses interpret an existing rite as a mnemonic sign they bear a significant resemblance to P's 'di- etiologies and may be forerunners of them. These passages, together with Josh., iv, 6 f., will be discussed after the investigation of the priestly 'di-etiologies. 15 B.

FOX Long offers the following analysis of the structure of P's 'ôt schema: 1. Identification of an object or rite. 2. Designation as an *ôt (hãyâ le'ôt or *ât hV). 3. Meaning of the ' ôt (what it symbolizes, memorializes, recalls) 18. This is not incorrect, but it is incomplete. I believe it is possible to offer a more precise analysis of the schema which will show more clearly the meaning of these etiologies and the purpose of the priestly writer. Our investigation will lead to the conclusion that in the priestly ^¿-etiologies the y6t is a permanent sign whose purpose is to stir up cognition, with the result that a covenant, a promise, or a command- ment is maintained by God or man. These etiologies do not just explain the origin of current phenomena; they are rather concerned with explaining the present meaning of the phenomena by historical reference. A.

This section contains several repetitions which led von Rad to regard it as a conflation of two recensions, A : IIa, 13, 16 f., and B : 9 f., llb, 12, 14 f. 20 But repetitions in P cannot be taken as prima facie evidence for separate recensions. The priestly writer hardly has an aversion to repetitions, but on the contrary, uses them fre- quently and skillfully 21. In Gen., i, 27, for example, there is at least a two-fold, perhaps a three-fold, repetition, together with an incon- gruency in grammatical number (von Rad, Genesis, explains the repe- tition as a purposeful stylistic device "). Further examples of stylis- tic repetition : Gen., ii, 2 f.; vii, 14-16; ix, 5; xxiii, 17-20; xlix, 29 f., 32; Ex., xii, 18-20, and throughout Lev., xxv, 8-55. In none of these passages, except for Gen., ii, 2 f., 28 does von Rad separate strands on the basis of the repetition. For Gen., ix, 8-17, McEvenue has shown the presence of deliberate formal structures, which leave little doubt of the integrity of the passage24. The question of two possible recensions in P may be raised for most of the passages to be considered in this section, but the arguments raised above against 19 Cf. P. P. Joüon. Grammaire .

E. McEvenue, Narrative Style , pp. 72 ff.</page><page sequence="16">572 MICHAEL V. FOX the theory are applicable elsewhere as well: repetition is insufficient evidence for the existence of parallel recensions, and the presence of carefully wrought formal structures points to authorship rather than editorship (2). The verb zãkôr plays an important role in the 'oi-etiologies. It often means more than just "remember" in the sense of mental recol- lection and is frequently best translated "maintain." zãkôr 'et yôm haHabbãt (Ex., xx, 8) means iãmôr 'et yôm haHabbãt (Deut., v, 12). God's promise to remember the covenant of the forefathers (Lev., xxvi, 45) certainly means that he will maintain it, as the dative of advantage shows *. The fact that zkr usually, if not always, implies action as well as memory was one of the factors that led Pedersen to the conclusion that action was inseparably bound to thought in Hebrew mentality27. B. Childs too finds an integral connection between memory and action in the root zkr, but places the relationship on the level of semantics, not psychology28. In fact, English "remember" has a similar semantic range. When one "remembers" his wife's birthday he does more than just think about it. To be "remembered" in a will means more than being thought about when the will is drawn up. We can determine the precise meaning of "remember" - and zkr - only within its context. W. Schottroff29 has examined the precise nuancing of zkr in its various contexts. For our purposes here we may quote his significant conclusion that "tätig, nicht bloss gedanklich ist der mit zkr ausgesprochene Bezug, wenn das Verbum das Beachten eines Gebots, die Wahrung eines Vertragsverhältnisses, den Erweis von gemeinschaftsgemässer Verbundenheit ausdrückt30. It should be stres- 33 See S. E. McEvenue, Narrative Style , passim. See further the detailed criticism' and refutation of von Rad's thesis by P.

However this is not invariably so. In Ex., ii, 24 f., for example, wayyizkòr *élõhím *et berîtô cannot mean that God maintained his covenant (yiqtol with waw conversivo never expresses future tense), for he has not yet begun to carry out his promise. Also, Im* zkr in 24 seems to be equivalent to Ph - - - j/cř4 in 25. Likewise in Ex., vi, 5 zkr b'rit means simply remember, without implying activity.</page><page sequence="17">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 573 sed that zkr in Gen., ix, 15 f. designates true recollection, not just thought on a present circumstance. That is to say, the plain meaning of the text is that God is not thinking of his promise when it starts to rain, but when he sees the rainbow it reminds him of his past pro- mise, and this memory results directly in the maintenance of his vow. For God, no shadow falls between the thought and the reality. (3). Let us stress what is explicit in the text but often passed over by the commentators: the purpose of the rainbow is to remind God, not man, of the covenant. (4). The rainbow is an ' ôt berü. This is not a sign identifying the covenant, nor is it even meant to prove the existence of the covenant (though man may secondarily interpret it as such a testimony). The genitival construction of 'ôt berît does not indicate that the sign belongs to the covenant. The 'ôt is a sign recalling the covenant and may be more precisely translated as a "reminder of the covenant." The phrase is an objective construct, i.e., the genitive is in a sense the semantic direct object of the nomen regens. (A noun that signifies activity may take a semantic direct object in the genitive, e.g., yir'at 'êlõhim, hämas ' ãhikã , 'êmat melek , cf. Gesenius- Kautsch § 128A.) (5). Further formal characteristics present here and in most of P's 'ot-etiologies are the expressions used to identify the 'ôt: wehãyetâ ( wehãyâ) le'ôt "to serve as a sign," and zô't 'ôt (habberit). (6). As has long been recognized, the rainbow motif goes back to the idea that the rainbow is God's war-bow ( qašti , "my bow"), just as the lightning is his arrows, and the appearance of the rainbow after the storm means that God has hung up his bow and is no longer hostile31. P is taking an old - pre-Israelite - motif and removing it from its mythic context by interpreting it as an 'ôt, thus fitting it into his own theology and view of history. (7). This passage is etiological in that it explains the origin and significance of a currently existing fact on the basis of an event in the past. (8). The 'ôt is not an end in itself. Its ultimate purpose is the main- tenance of God's covenant with mankind. (9). The rainhow is a permanent sign. Having been established once and for all by Yahweh, it now and forever operates independently in the service of the covenant 32. 31 See, i.a., Gunkel and Skinner, ad loc. 32 Thus Keller, Das Wort OTH , p. 132.</page><page sequence="18">574 MICHAEL V.

Long does not include this passage in the 'df-etiologies because it supposedly lacks the element of "timeless permanence." But this is a true etiology, and it does contain the element of timeless perma- nence, for the blood-rite, together with the other rites of the Passover night, is intended for all generations (vs. 14). The offering of the first Passover is a model for the rite that is to be performed in all genera- tions, both in P (vss. 14, 17) and J (vss. 24-27). Ex., xii, 42 (P) states that this first "night of vigil for Yahweh" shall be the model for the night of vigil "for all the children of Israel throughout their genera- tions." 83 (2). The blood is [a cognition sign, in particular an identity sign, which functions by affecting God's consciousness, not man's. M M.

The purpose of the cognition is action, the maintenance of the promise to spare Israel the punishment inflicted upon Egypt. (4). This passage too uses the formula wehãyâ l&amp;ôt in identifying the sign. (5). J (vss. 22-23) reflects the same concept of the function of the blood-sign (vs. 14), but does not identify the blood as an &gt;ôt. (6). The blood rite itself belongs originally to the realm of magic. It was probably an apotropaic device meant to protect a house against inimical demons or divinities (the mašhít?)M. The identity of the maihU as a distinct being belonging to the superhuman realm is clear in J (vs. 23) : "and he will not allow the maïhit to enter your houses to smite." In P the difficult phrasing in 13b&lt;x may reflect a deliberate attempt to obscure the independent demonic character of the maihît while preserving the old terminology associated with this rite. (P never mentions angelic or intermediary beings, though they seem to be alluded to in Gen ., i, 26; the belief in them was present in the older traditions that P is remolding.) In Ex., xii, 13 P is using an ancient concept, but for him it no longer belongs to the realm of magic, but to theology. Instead of functioning automatically to ward of! demons - i.e., as magic - the blood serves as a cognition sign that affects Yahweh's will. C. The Sabbath. Ex., xxxi, 12-17. 12.

Remarks : (1). Remark (1) to passage A (p. 15 f.) applies here as well: the doublets do not provide sufficient reason to separate the section into two strands85. There are formal indications of different tradition- layers in this passage, but these layers are virtually impossible to separate. It is hard to determine whether we have here secondary expansions (particularly in vss. 15 f.) or material from earlier legal traditions taken up by the priestly writer. One gets the impression that P is taking up earlier legal material (belonging to the priestly school) and incorporating it into his '¿¿-etiology schema. At any rate, even if the repetitious elaboration of the Sabbath law is removed we have the basic structure of the '¿¿-etiology (a-b-c), together with a closing recapitulation (a') such as we have seen already in Gen., ix, 17. The section can be treated as a single unit, for the expansion - if there was one - did not disturb the basic structure of the etiology. (2). The Sabbath is a cognition sign for Israel. It is in fact a mne- monic sign, although the word zkr is not used. The Sabbath recalls to Israel each week something that is not new knowledge - that it is Yahweh who sanctifies them. Yahweh's sanctification of Israel means that he has set them aside as his special nation, for whom he will be their God God informed them of this sanctification in his covenant with Abraham (Gen., xvii, 7). It is not an identity sign (contrary to Noth), for there is no hint that the Sabbath is supposed to inform others that Israel is God's people. It is not a symbol sign, for it does not resemble or stand for another event. (It does resemble God's first Sabbath, but symbol signs always inform by representing a future event in the human sphere ; in a sense God's Sabbath was the 85 G. von Rad, Priesterschrift, pp. 62 f!., divides as follows: A = xxxi, 12, 13b, 14; B = xxxi, 13a, 15-17. 88 Note that Ezekiel can rephrase lãdalat ki ani Y HW H meqaddešām (Ezech., xx, 12, as lâda'at ki 'ani Y HW H 'êlõhêkem (xx, 20), and cf. Lev., xx, 26.</page><page sequence="21">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 577 symbol for Israel's Sabbath.) It is not a proof sign, for in itself it has no persuasive force to convince the observer of anything. The usual translation of vs. 17 implies that the Sabbath is a proof sign: "It is a sign for ever between me and the people of Israel that in six days the Lord made heaven and earth, and on the seventh day he rested, and was refreshed" (RSV). But why would knowledge of that fact be an end in itself? At any rate, it was never a matter of doubt that would require evidence. Rather, the ki in vs. 17 is causal: the Sabbath is an eternal sign (*ot hi* le&lt;ôlãm) because God built it into the world as a part of nature (like the rainbow). (3). Thus the Sabbath too has the element of timeless permanence characteristic of most of P's signs (see vss. 14, 16, 17). Like the rain- bow and the pascal blood it was established once and for all and now has independent power to recall an important fact. (4). Just how the Sabbath can be traced back to pre-Israelite thought is still an open question37, but it was hardly created ex nihilo. The Sabbath was, of course, an established practice long before P. In the minor Book of the Covenant, cessation from labor on the seventh day is commanded (Ex., xxxiv, 21), but without any motivating reason. In Ex., xx, 11, a priestly expansion motivates the Sabbath command with a reference to God's first Sabbath but does not explain the pur- pose of the Sabbath for man. D (Deut., v, 15) uses a historical motiva- tion that is obviously secondary. In Ex., xxxi, 12-17, P is doing for the Sabbath essentially the same thing he did for the rainbow and the pascal blood: he is offering an etiological explanation for an existing fact or rite by interpreting it as a cognition sign. He may be attempting to eliminate any traces of magic and taboo that still clung to the Sabbath. This is speculation. The attempts to connect the Sabbath with the Babylonian šapattu or the "evil days" that fell at seven-day intervals in the month have not been persuasive, yet it must be admitted that the Sabbath bears some resemblance to both. God's resting on the seventh day is remi- niscent of the šapattu as the day of the "quieting of (the god's) heart". Like the "evil days", in which the king must cease from certain acti- vities, the Sabbath is a day of cessation from labor, and like it the Sabbath was structured on seven-day cycles (though independent of 37 See R. de Vaux, Ancient Israel , New York, 1961, pp. 475 ff. and bibliography ; also H.-J. Kraus, Worship in Israel, Oxford, 1966, pp. 78 IT. ; J. and H. Lewy, The origin of the week and the oldest West Asiatic calendar, in HUCA, XVII, 1942/43, pp. 1 ff. ; N.-E. A.

REVUE BIBLIQUE 37</page><page sequence="22">578 MICHAEL V. FOX the month). At the least we can say that a similar concept underlies both the Sabbath and these special days in Babylonia - the concept of sacred time, according to which certain days have a special charac- ter and may be holy. The Sabbath is a day that belongs to God (šabbāt lYHWH * élõhékã, Ex ., xx, 10; Deut., v, 14), like the sabbatical year (Leif., xxv, 2). The division of time into cycles of seven may have mythical or magical significance38. (5). There is a difference between this etiology and the other '¿¿-etiologies in P : it was not given at the time when the sign in question originated. So instead of saying that the Sabbath "shall be for a sign" (wehãyetâ le'ôt), the text says: "for it is a sign" (ki &gt;ôt hV). According to Long, this shows a slight modification of form : instead of the Sabbath being designated as a sign, its "sign-ness" is being cited in a motive clause as a reason for obeying the law 39. This modification, he says, comes about because the dominant interest here is in the prescription. I think, however, that the interest in the prescription is no less significant in the cases of the circumcision, pascal blood, and the altar-covering. The real reason for this choice of for- mula is that the Sabbath is already existent at the time when it is being designated as an yot, so that a formula with deictic force is more suitable. Of all P's signs the Sabbath alone was created when there were no men to be informed of it. Note further that the second time the formula occurs (vs. 17), it is not in a motive clause. D. fringe. Num., xv, 37-40. 37. Yahweh said to Moses: 38. "Speak to the children of Israel and tell them to make a fringe on the corners of their garments throughout their generations, and to put a cord of blue on the fringe on the corners. 39.

There are two justifications for this emendation. First, the text as it stands contains a bald tautology - you shall make a fringe, put a cord of blue on it, and it shall be as a fringe. What is the point of saying that x (even x with something on it) shall be as x, or x shall serve as x? Second, this section fits perfectly into the contentual and formal pattern of the '¿¿-etiologies, and at this place in an '¿¿-etiology we expect the phrase wehãyâ Ze'¿¿. We will proceed to analyse this unit on the basis of this emendation. While this unit can strengthen our case by offering another possible example with all the formal and contentual characteristics that we have found to belong to the '¿¿-etiologies, it will not change any of the basic conclusions, so that this assumption is not essential to the general argument.

Remarks : (1). P is commanding the wearing of an actual physical symbol on the garments - a fringe with blue cords. In Ex ., xiii, 9, 16, as in Deut., vi, 8; xi, 18, the practice of using certain physical (probably apotro- paic) devices is converted into a figurative usage, whereby something besides the token serves as a mnemonic device. Here the token itself is a memory sign. Whereas JE and D seem to be offering a substitute for the physical tokens - eating of mazzot, dedication of firstborn, God's words - P is maintaining the visible token, but explaining it as a mnemonic sign. The use of tassels, gedilîm , is prescribed by D (Deut., xxii, 12), but there their meaning or function is not explained. (2). The §i§it was no doubt an ancient apotropaic device, like the blood on the doorpost The operative factor was probably the blue cord on the §i§it (cf. the blue cord on the priest's turban, Ex., xxviii, 41 See the commentaries to Numbers , esp.

And they shall make them into hammered sheets as plating for the altar - for since they have used them for offering before Yahweh they have become holy. And they shall be as a sign for the children of Israel" - 4. (Then Eleazar the priest took the copper fire pans which those who had been burnt had used for offering and hammered them into plating for the altar) - 5.

Yahweh said to Moses: "Put Aaron's rod back before the Testimony, to be kept as a sign [lemismeret le&gt;ôt] for the rebels, that their complaining against me may cease [read wHikel , cf. LXX, Peshitta], lest they die." 26. And Moses did this; just as Yahweh had commanded him, so he did.

Remarks : (1). This bit of narrative is not, as it stands, explicitly etiological, for it does not explain an existing fact by its origin. Yet it is probable that the verse is implicitly etiological. It is likely that Aaron's rod was a secondary cultic appurtenance which was present at some stage of the Jerusalem cult but did not have the status of the cult objects divinely ordained in the Tabernacle plan and so was legitimatized by an etiological narrative. The Nehustan had a similar status, see II Kings , xviii, 4; Num., xxi, 8 f. The term lemišmeret indicates that the rod had some degree of permanence and was not meant only for the time of Korach's rebellion. The omer of manna (Ex., xvi, 32 f.), which was also to be kept before the Testimony (lipne YHWH lemišmeret, i.e., before the Ark) seems to have had a similar status, and there it is specifically stated that the object is to be kept "through- out your generations". bene meri in Num,, xvii, 25 refers to Israel in general, cf.

The rod in question may have been at first a divine rod of the sort known from Near Eastern mythology. Gods are commonly repre- sented as carrying rods as symbols of rule and power. Moses' rod, while removed from the mythic sphere, is still divine - "the rod of God" (Ex., iv, 20; xvii, 9). The stories of Aaron's rod are develop- ments of the same motif - they are ultimately the same rod, as is noted in Exodus Rabbah, Bešallah , xxvii, 9. In Egypt and Phoenicia the rods of the gods were kept in sanctuaries 45. The priestly story in Num., xvii, 16-26 is an attempt to eliminate whatever mythological or magical significance the rod still possessed by converting it into a mnemonic sign Summary : the form and content of the priestly Mi-etiologies. The Mi-etiology schema in P has four basic elements : Introduction : Announcement of a covenant or presentation of a command. (A promise for God is the equivalent of a command for man; both designate an action that should be performed.) a. Identification of the Mi by the formulae z&lt;?t &gt; ot , wehãyâ ZeMi, or Mi hV. (In Num., xvii, 25, which is not a complete Mi-etiology, ZeMi is subordinated to hāšēb' this is elliptical for hãSêb 'et mattëh * ahãrôn... wehãyâ Ie* ôt.) b. Function of the Mi: cognition, either by identifying something or reminding one of something. rãyô often used to indicate perception. c. Purpose of the Mi: action, i.e., fulfillment of promise or command, not necessarily the one presented in the introduction. These elements, especially a, may be repeated for the sake of elaboration or emphasis. In all cases P is taking an ancient phenomenon which had its own significance and converting it into a cognition sign. In the case of the rainbow, the pascal blood, the fringe, the rod of Aaron, and possi- bly the Sabbath, we see a process of demythologization: the priestly writer seeks to raise the theological level of these phenomena by bring- ing them from the realm of myth and magic to the realm of psycho- logy. The process of demythologization is manifest throughout the priestly code. Cosmogony is stripped of mythological elements and 45 See S. Loewenstamm, Ency. MiqraVt , IV, col. 826-832; H. Bonnet, Reallexikon der ägyptischen Religions geschickte, Berlin, 1952, pp. 254-256. 44 A similar concern with eliminating the mythical significance of this rod is present in Num., xx, 1-13, which sees the reliance on the rod instead of on a word spoken in accor- dance with God's command as showing a lack of faith; see S. Loewenstamm, Mot Moshe , in Tarbiz, XXVII, 1957/58, pp. 144 ft.</page><page sequence="27">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 583 made into creation through divine fiat. The luminaries lose all super- natural significance and become passive time-markers. God's rod is still effective, but its importance is reduced and it is considered a sign of small faith that Moses feels he must rely on it (Num., xx, see above, n. 46). The priestly writer is worried that the people might attribute independent power, which is to say, magical power, to the rod. He also eliminates all direct references to angels, lest one think that there are superhuman powers independent of Yahweh. This tendency is not due to one writer, of course, but was charac- teristic of the priestly school, which transmitted the traditions and documents that were developed into the priestly document. Nor was the tendency restricted to the priestly school, although it is less prominent and developed in JE. (It is more extensive and thorough- going in D 47.) Now P did not arrive at a purely abstract, non-anthropomorphic and non-anthropopathic theology, totally devoid of mythical rem- nants. God's rod is still effective (Num., xx, 11; Ex., vii, 9 ff., 19; viii, 12 f.). P does preserve traces of a belief in intermediary beings (Gen., i, 26; Ex., xii, 13). The whole cultic phenomenology of P may fairly be called primitive: God has a human form (Gen., i, 27; v, 1; ix, 6). The "glory (kãbôd) of Yahweh" is conceived in corporeal, not abstract, terms (Ex., xxiv, 17 J48. He dwells in the deep recesses of his house, seated on the cherubim, with the ark as his footstool 4#. He is ministered to by his servants the priests, who provide him with food, drink, incense, and light; all this is done in Yahweh's presence, lipnê YHWH M. It is doubtful that the priestly writer himself believes these conceptions in a strictly literal sense. He is transmitting im- agery that is part of the pre-Israelite cultic heritage, which has long since lost its literal meaning61. It is unlikely that the lofty deity presented else where in P - in the Creation Story, for example - was thought to need food and drink. Yet the meaning of the ancient rites cannot have been totally lost to the priests who performed them day by day. It is clear that for P Yahweh in some sense actually dwells in the Tabernacle, cf. Ex., xxv, 8; xxix, 45; xl, 34-38; Num., ix, 15 f. Perhaps the priests felt that they were ministering to God, while not thinking that God actually ate, drank and smelled their offerings. 47 Cf. Weinfeld, Deuteronomy , Part II. 48 Idem, ibid., pp. 199 ff. 49 M. Harán, The Ark and the Cherubim , in IE J. IX, 1959, pp. 30-38, 89-94. 60 Idem, The complex of ritual acts, in Scripta H ie rosoly mitana . VIII. 1961. dd. 272 ft. " Idem, ibid.t pp. 292, 296, 298.</page><page sequence="28">584 MICHAEL V. FOX Thus while the original significance of the rites was not retained with full literal force, the original purpose was. God may not actually eat the offerings, but they have the same purpose as if he did - to win his favor, his rã§ôn. Thus P shows a dialectic between primitive carry-overs and inter- pretation on a more sophisticated level. P could hardly eliminate the rainbow, the pascal blood, the fringes, the rod, etc., and he recognized that they had supernatural significance. But he is pushing away from that supernatural significance in the direction of naturalistic inter- pretation. By "naturalistic" I do not mean that these phenomena are removed from the sphere of religion - that is obviously not the case. I mean that P makes these phenomena function in a naturalistic way - by influencing the cognition, and thus the will, of God and man. This is in contrast to magical functioning, which means the manipulation of self-operating forces in the realm of the metadivine, which are independent of, and in fact superior to, divinity52. Yet this naturalistic interpretation did not result in abstract theology. The rainbow and the pascal blood are cognition signs for God. The plain meaning of the text is that God needs such signs. He is not omniscient in a medieval philosophical sense. These observations lead us to an understanding of the relation between the 'otot and the zikrõnôt in P. zikkãrôn is used in two main senses : in the passive sense of memo- randum, something remembered, and in the active sense of a remind- er 52 P uses the word only in the latter sense. The following cultic phenomena are called zikrõnôt: the breastplate {Ex., xxviii, 29), the onyx stones {Ex., xxviii, 12), atonement money (Ex., xxx, 16), gold booty (Num., xxxi, 54), the "cereal offering of jealousy" (Num., v, 18), the blowing of trumpets (Num., x, 9 f; cf. Lev., xxiii, 24), the altar cover (Num., xvii, 5), and Passover day (Ex., xii, 14). The full formula designating something as a zikkãrôn is zikkãrôn libné yisrāyēl lipnê Y HW H (Num., xxxi, 54; see Ex., xxviii, 29; xxviii, 12; xxx, 16; Num., x, 10 for variants of the full formula). In Ex., xxviii, 12; xxxix, 7 the object is called simply zikkãrôn libné yisrãyêl, but it is clear that it is not Israel that is to be reminded, but God. libné yisrāyēl is a dative of advantage. The function of a zikkãrôn is stated clearly in Num., x, 9 : w^nizkartem lipnê YHWH, "and M See Kaufmann's analysis of the nature of magic and its place in pagan religion, Tole - dot , I, pp. 350-358 (English edit., pp. 40-42). On zikkãrôn in P see B. Childs, Memory , pp. 66 IT.; W. Schottroff, " Gedenken , pp. 299 ff.</page><page sequence="29">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 585 you will be remembered before Yahweh". All of P's zikrõnôt are reminders for God, with the exception of Num., xvii, 5 and Ex., xii, 14. "The zikkãrôn stimulates God's memory and his acts of memory are synonymous with his acts of intervention. The zikkãrôn also stimulates Israel's memory, which produces participation in the sacred order" 64. Thus it is clear that reminders to God are of great importance in P. Since memory and action are closely linked for God, these remind- ers serve to actualize God's grace in the life of the community. "If we try to find in the cultic vocabulary of the Old Testament a general formula answering to the significance of the cult for Israel, we can say that the cult brings Israel to the remembrance of Yahweh" M. This general formula describes the way in which P infuses new mean- ing into the ancient paraphenalia of the cult. The zikkãrôn (like the '¿¿) is a major device used in this reinterpretation, for it converts rites that were once considered as possessing magical potency into devices whose efficacy consists in affecting divine cognition. Remark : Non-priestly '¿¿-etiologies. JE contains two '¿¿-etiologies, Ex., xiii, 9 and 16 (see above, p. 11 f.), both within the context of a question-answer schema. Here we have (a) the identification of the '¿¿ and (b) the function - memory. But the memory is an end in itself. The sign reminds Israel of God's redemptive power, but does not have the purpose of leading to a specific action, such as the fulfillment of a command. Deut ., vi, 8 and, xi, 18 are derived from the '¿¿-etiology found in JE but are no longer true etiologies. If we press the logic of these verses, we find that the reminder and that which is remembered are the same - God's words. The '¿¿ does not point beyond itself to some other event or fact, as it must in an etiology, but is an end in itself. D is not concerned with providing an etiology for God's words - that would hardly make sense. His point is simply that God's words should remain continually in one's awareness. He has drawn upon the form of the '¿¿-etiology of Ex., xiii, 9, 16, but his meaning derives from the metaphorical use of ornaments in wisdom exhortations, where the pupil is told to keep the father's instruction with him always, attached to him like ornaments (or apotropaic amulets), cf. Prov., vi, 20-22: "My son, keep your father's commandments and forsake 64 B. Childs, Memory , p. 68. But the purpose of reminding Israel of the sacred order is less significant than Childs implies.

Bind them upon your heart continually; tie them about your neck, etc." also Prov., iii, 3; iv, 9; vii, 3 s6. Josh., iv, 6 f. is an 'of-etiology similar to Ex., xiii, 9 and 16. Here, as there, a certain cultic phenomenon is given a place in a question-answer schema and is meant to remind succeeding genera- tions of a historical fact. As in Ex., xiii, 9, 16, the 'ot has no purpose beyond its mnemonic function. The etiology in Josh., iv, 6 f. prob- ably belongs to J.

When Abram was 99 years old Yahweh67 appeared to Abram and said to him, "I am El Shaddai. Walk in my ways and be blameless. 2. I will establish my covenant between me and you: I will make you exceed- ingly numerous." 3. Then Abram threw himself on his face, and God spoke to him as follows: 4. "As for me, my covenant is with you: You shall be the father of a multi- tude of nations. 5. And you shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I am making you the father of a multitude of nations. 6. And I will make you exceedingly fertile, and make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you. 7. I am establishing my covenant between me and you and your seed after you throughout their generations, as an everlasting covenant to be God for you and your seed after you. 8. And I will give to you and your seed after you the land of your sojourning - all the land of Canaan - as an everlasting possession, and I will be God for them." 9. And God said to Abraham, "As for you, you shall keep my covenant, you and your seed after you throughout their generations. 10. This is my covenant that you shall keep between me and you and your seed after you: Every male among you shall be circumcised. 11. You shall circumcise the flesh of your foreskin, and that shall be for a sign of the covenant [wekãyâ Ze&gt; ôt bertt ] between me and you. * For a comparison of the amulets or ornaments in Deuteronomy with those in Proverbs see Weinfeld, Deuteronomy , pp. 299 ff. But, contrary to Weinfeld, the signs and fofapot are metaphors in Ex., xiii, 9, 16 no less than in Deuteronomy, see above, pp. 11 f. 47 The name Yahweh in vs. 1 is usually attributed to a redactor or copyist (thus Carpen- ter-Harford, Skinner, etc.). But it may be that P can use the name Yahweh even before Ex., vi when speaking in his own voice (and thereby not violating his theory of the revela- tion of the name only in the time of Moses). If so, P is taking care to tell us that the El Shaddai associated with the ancient covenant was none other than Yahweh.</page><page sequence="31">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 587 12.

Purpose of the *ôt: missing. Preliminary remarks: (1). Circumcision is called both a covenant (zfft bariti, vs. 10) and a sign of the covenant (*ôt ber% vs. 11). This dual representation is not the result of vagueness of thought (contrary to Gunkel and Skin- ner). The designation of circumcision as a covenant is a synecdoche 48 On the basis of varying grammatical number, von Rad ( Priesterschrift , pp. 20 ff.) finds an earlier layer, vss. 9-12», 13b (plural, except for zar'âkd 'ahdrèkã), expanded by detailed prescriptions, 12M3» (singular), and perhaps 14. (It is interesting that he does not use the doublet criterion to separate 9 from 10», 10b from 11», and 10» from llb; the doublet criterion is often capricious.) In fact, however, the whole legal section (9-14) is essentially plural, except for 13», himmôl yimmôl y*lid bêttkã ûmiqnat kaspekã. Since the phrase zar'dkd 'ahdrèkã (10») occurs in the plural section, it cannot be used as a criterion for distinguishing the singular section (12b). Because of the legal nature of this etiology, which presents prescriptions incumbent upon all generations, it is formulated in the plural and is in effect addressed to the people of Israel, zar'dkâ * ahdrèkã must remain in the singular because it refers to the seed of one man. Vs. 13» is the only other singular formulation, and this may be a quote from an earlier legal tradition, although we cannot use the criterion of grammatical number with rigidity (cf. Gen., xxxiv, 15, where the formula is in the plural.) Vs. 14, in the third singular, is not to be identified formally with the second singular usage in 13», for it is in no way in tension with the second plural usage. It is a generalized casuistic usage which may be addressed to a group as well as to an individual. There may indeed be different tradition layers in the prescriptions, but it is unlikely that we can identify them by purely formal criteria. But it seems quite certain that one hand - P - is responsible for the chapter in its present form. Again McEvenue offers a description, for the most part convincing, of the formal structures present in this chapter, whose elaborateness and pre- cision indicate that the present form is the product of individual authorship (McEvenue, Narrative Style , pp. 169 ff.).</page><page sequence="32">588 MICHAEL V. FOX for covenantal obligation, this aspect of berît being indicated by the clause yašer tUmeru (vs. 10). The sentence may be translated "this is the aspect of my covenant that you shall keep." The stress on you , in contrast to me (God), is evident in vs. 9, where we'atta is emphasized by being placed in frontal extraposition, corresponding to yânî in vs. 4 59. (2). 'ôt berît (vs. 11) is to be understood here as in ix, 12: a reminder of the covenant (Skinner), see above, p. 17 60. (3). The element of timeless permanence, essential to the ^-etio- logies, is emphasized here in almost every verse. The circumcision is a permanent, eternal sign, irradicable and irreversible, both in the life of the individual and in the course of the generations. (4). The convenantal promises in the introduction are introduced syndetically with finite verbs: w^arbe *ôt*kã bimyõd meõd (vs. 2), wehãyítã le*ab hãmôn gôyim (vs. 4, 5-6 are an elaboration of this promise), as well as asyndetically, with an infinitive: lihyôt lekã lë lõhím (vs. 7 ; this is not a purpose or final clause, but a nominal clause explicating berit lôlãm). Compare the syndetic introduction of the covenant promise in Gen ., ix, llaßb. This is to say that the syndetic clauses in xvii, 2b, 4b-6, and also 8, are not promises additional to the covenant ("I will establish my covenant with you and increase you, etc."), but define its content. So this covenant contains three pro- mises: that Abram will have great posterity, that Yahweh (El Shaddai) will be his God, and that he will inherit the Land. To whom do these promises pertain? The promise of the land and the promise of a special relation between Yahweh and Abraham's descendants can pertain only to Isaac and his descendants. The first promise, however, includes Ishmael and the sons of Ketura : 2b. I will make you exceedingly numerous... 4b. You shall be the father of a multitude of nations. 5. And you shall no longer be called Abram, but your name shall be Abraham, for I am making you the father of a multitude of nations. 6. And I will make you exceedingly fertile, and make nations of you, and kings shall come forth from you. Vss. 2-6 by themselves can only be a promise applying to all the Abrahamie tribes, who, according to the tradition, are circumcised. 59 In Ex., xxxi, 16, the Sabbath is not actually called a covenant. Rather, berit • olām is an adverbial accusative describing the manner in which the Sabbath is to be kept, cf. Lev., xxiv, 8. •° Thus J. J. P. Valeton, Bedeutung und Stellung des Wortes fl'HD im Priestercodex , in ZAW, XII, 1892, p. 9.</page><page sequence="33">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 589 The commentators have understood the section in this way, and Abraham himself thought the promise belonged to Ishmael, for in vss. 15-27 God has to correct his mistaken impression. This understand- ing is correct for the section 2-6 in itself, but not for the section as it stands in P. That is to say, P took over an ancient tradition of a promise of great posterity for all the Abrahamie tribes but reinter- preted its range of application. In the following section, vss. 15-27, P reinterprets the ancient tradition by correcting Abraham's (and the reader's) misapprehen- sion. Note first of all that this section reflects the structure of the first section (the introduction, vss. 1-8) - literally reflects it, for the structure of this section exactly reverses the order of the first, giving us a "palistrophe." 61 The palistrophic structure suggests that the second section is a comment on the first, and this is clear from the content. The promise that Abraham thought related to Ishmael actually belongs - much to Abraham's surprise - to an unborn son, Isaac. With him, not with Ishmael, will God establish his covenant. Vss. 15f. deliberately transfer the blessing of 4b, 5b, 6b from Ishmael to Isaac. Ishmael gets his blessing only as an afterthought (vs. 20), as a result of Abraham's request, not as part of the covenant estab- lished in the first part of the chapter. (From Ishmael, however, will come nesVîm , not mHãkím.) Vs. 21 stresses that the promise belongs to Isaac: "But I will establish my covenant with Isaac, whom Sarah will bear you this time next year." Only then does the vision that began in xvii, 1 come to an end. So the tradition-history of Gen., xvii may be outlined as follows: a. An ancient posterity-promise (oracle?) by El Shaddai62 common to the Abrahamie tribes, or at least applied to all the Abrahamie tribes. Vss. 2-6 can be interpreted in no other way. This tradition is not present in JE, but it can hardly be P's invention, for P has little interest in foreign nations. The connection of the promise of posterity with circumcision belongs to this oldest stage. For several of the tribes given Abrahamie lineage there is evidence of the practice of circumcision, namely Edom, Amon, and Moab, and "all the desert dwellers that cut the corners of their hair" (Jer., ix, 24 f.) The latter are associated with Tema and Dedan (Jer., xxv, 23) and Kedar (Jer., xlix, 28, 32). Tema and Kedar are Ishmaelite tribes (Gen., xxv, 13 f.), łl McEvenue, Narrative Style , p. 158. For the definition of palistrophe see ibid., p. 29. M "El Shaddai*' belongs to the religious traditions of the religio-ethnic group of "Hebrews'* (sons of Eber), of which Israel was a part, see M. H aran, The religion of the patriarchs , in ASTI , IV, 1965, p. 42.</page><page sequence="34">590 MICHAEL V. FOX and Dedan was descended from Abraham through Keturah (Gen., xxv, 3). Ex., iv, 24 ff. seems to testify to the practice among the Midianites b. P took over this old tradition of circumcision among the Abraham- ie tribes and incorporated it in his Abrahamie covenant, but in so doing deliberately and explicitly permutated its original significance, so that it now applied only to Israel. The old formula that encapsul- ates the promise, whose apothegmatic character suggests that it was originally oracular, was of some importance for P, even after it lost its original meaning. The formula appears with slight variations in Gen., xvii, 16; xxviii, 3; xxxv, 11 and xlviii, 4. The best evidence that this formula was an ancient, independent tradition and not simply written for the sake of the context is Gen., xxxv, 11: "And God said to him [Jacob]: 'I am El Shaddai. Be fertile and increase; A nation, yea an assembly of nations, shall descend from you, and kings shall issue from your loins.' " At most two nations descended from Jacob M, but the formula clearly envisions many more. And P would hardly consider the division of the Israelite kingdom and the multiplication of kings it resulted in as a blessing. c. Associated with the transference of the promise from the Abra- hamie tribes in general to Israel is the transference of circumcision from age thirteen years to age eight days. As we will see later, it is probable that circumcision was originally a fertility rite associated with puberty and marriage (there was not much separation between them in ancient tribal societies). Gen., xvii (rather than Ex., iv, 24 ff.) may be in part an etiology for the transference of the rite from puberty to birth. d. P joined to the promise of posterity two other ancient promises, the Land and Yahweh's Godship for Israel. The promise of the Land is less ancient than the promise of Godship, for the promise of a special relationship with Yahweh is an antedating of the substance of the Sinai covenant65. The promise of the Land belongs originally to the patriarchal religion, where it assured the seminomadic tribes driving toward the civilized territory that they would achieve their goal66. These two traditions were, of course, united long before P, and they •® See. Idem. ibid.. pp. 42 f. and note 48. •4 Gôy is a nation - a political designation - not a kinship group, cf. E.

The promise of progeny is probably more ancient than the other two promises, for in its orig- inal form the posterity promise applied to all the Abrahamie tribes, whereas the promises of the Land and Yahweh's Godship belong only to the traditions of the sons of Jacob. Whatever the order of development, the posterity promise is clear- ly the most prominent one in this chapter. It is the first promise to be given - the other two are appended - and it takes up five verses, as against two for the other two promises. Progeny is the focus of concern in Gen., xvii, even though it is not the most important ele- ment elsewhere in P. In Ex., n, 24-25, God remembers his covenant with the fathers and takes cognizance of Israel's situation. The aspects of the covenant relevant here can only be the promises that Yahweh will be Israel's God and will give them the Land, because they have already greatly increased. When God addresses Moses in Ex., vi, 2 ff., he says that he has remembered his covenant with the fathers to give them the Land. To do this, he will bring Israel out of Egypt and be their God (vs. 7). The following narrative tells how these prom- ises were fulfilled. If P decided to give such importance to the pro- geny promise in Gen., xvii, that can only be because of the special connection between that promise and the duty prescribed as the aspect of the covenant incumbent upon Israel. We have already suggested the possibility that one etiological aspect of P's reinterpretation of the progeny promise may be the transference of circumcision from puberty to birth. This would fit in with his larger purpose of reinterpreting circumcision and elim- inating its magical function. This purpose is accomplished above all by interpreting circumcision as an 'ôt, the exact significance of which we will now consider. First we must consider the original significance of circumcision. This is very difficult to do, because nowhere do we find the original significance stated explicitly, and also because in the course of time additional meanings were added to it. But there are indications that circumcision was originally and essentially a fertility device associat- ed with puberty and marriage. The first indicator that circumcision is essentially a fertility device (and not, say, a tribal mark) is the fact that among the tribes through- out the world that practice circumcision it is with few exceptions performed in adolescence or just before marriage67. It is often a prere- •' ERE, III, p. 662.</page><page sequence="36">592 MICHAEL V. FOX quisite for marriage. While it is doubtful that one explanation can cover all the varieties of this worldwide custom, it is fair to assume that fertility is one of the basic motives, if not the basic motive. The other explanations, such as that circumcision is a tribal mark, test of endurance, or sacrifice, do not explain why the rite is performed on the penis. The evidence from Egypt, where the practice was most ancient but not universal, is sparse and often obscure, and there is little that would indicate its purpose there. It is of some significance that in inscriptions from the Middle Kingdom there is mention of boys of whom "the foreskin is not yet severed", indicating that circumcision was regularly practiced at puberty M. It is likely that in Egypt too circumcision was primarily a puberty rite that was only secondarily associated with ritual purity 69. The practice of circumcision was (and is) nearly universal among the Semitic peoples (with the exception of the Babylonians and Assy- rians), and may well go back to the common Semitic stock. The use of a flint knife (Ex., iv, 25; Josh., v, 2) indicates that the rite originat- ed in the Stone Age. But there is no way of determining its original significance among the non-Israelite Semites. There is, however, evidence that among the ancient Israelites the practice was associated with marriage. Whatever the meaning of the obscure passage in Ex., iv, 24-26, it is significant that Zipporah designates the vicariously circumcised Moses as a hãtan dãmim for her, and that she used this term "with respect to circumcision" (lammulõt). Circumcision and marriage are thus etymologically associated in the Arabic hatana "to circum- cise" and hatuna "to become akin to someone through one's wife", and in Hebrew hãtan dãmim (said with respect to circumcision) and hãtãn "son-in-law", hôtën "father-in-law", and hãtunnâ "marriage, wedding", and the denominatives (see BDB). The problem in Ex., iv, 24 ff. may be that Moses was uncircumcised and so illicitly married, •8 See the survey in ERE, III, pp. 670 ft.; Bonnet, Reallexikon , pp. 109 ff; also J. Sasson, Circumcision in the Ancient Near East , in JBL , LXXXV, 1966, pp. 473-476. •• Thus Bonnet, ibid. In Israel too circumcision came secondarily to be associated with purity and its lack with impurity (cf. Is., lii, 1). Generally, however, the negative conno- tation of non-circumcision is not specifically a'matter of impurity, but a more general feel- ing of aversion toward the foreign. From this feeling comes the use of "uncircumcised" as a term of contempt (e.g., Judg., xv, 18; I Sam., xvii, 26, 36; II Sam., i, 20; Ezek., xxxii, passim). Non-circumcision further comes to signify a flaw or impediment (Lev., xxvi, 41; Ex., vi, 12, 30; Jer., vi, 10, etc.). The * orlâ of a tree (Lev., xix, 23-25) may be a derivation of this usage. Conversely, circumcision takes, on metaphorically the sense of removing an imped- iment (Deut., X, 16; xxx, 6; Jer., iv, 4).</page><page sequence="37">THE SIGN OF THE COVENANT 593 for which reason Yahweh sought to kill him, but Zipporah saved him by circumcising their son and touching Moses' genitals ("feet") with the foreskin, thus vicariously circumcising him. But since the son seems out of place in the story, which concerns the danger to Moses, he may have been brought in secondarily, for it was considered offensive to say that Moses was uncircumcised and that his wife cir- cumcised him (see Noth, ad loc.). In Gen., xxxiv we learn that circumcision was an essential prere- quisite for marriage into the tribe (vss. 14 ff.). This does not, of course, exclude the possibility of child circumcision, but it does associate circumcision specifically with marriage. Josh., v, 2-9 too is evidence for circumcision at puberty or adult- hood, precisely because of the rather heavy-handed redactional effort to disguise this fact and harmonize the rite with child circum- cision. The original story consisted of vss. 2 f., 8 f. Vss. 4-7 are an extensive redactional excursis (mainly deuteronomistic, with some signs of a priestly redaction, cf. Gray, Noth) explaining why the Israel- ites were not yet circumcised. These verses differ considerably in LXX. íâb and Unit in vs. 2 are a clumsy effort at harmonization, for they make it appear that Joshua is to circumcise the Israelites once again (Noth) 70. This heavy redaction is understandable only on the assumption that the redactors are trying to adapt to their own concep- tions a tradition that conflicted with them, namely, the etiological tradition of an adult or adolescent circumcision rite associated with Gilgal 71. If in Israel, as in most other places, circumcision was originally a puberty or marriage rite, we may surmise that here too circumcision was preparation for the most important aspect of this turn in the life cycle - reproduction. This connection significantly appears in Gen., xvii, where circumcision is the human expression of God's covenant with Abraham, the major and original part of which is the promise of great posterity. 70 This is so even if we accept the LXX reading Ub, "sit down" and refer (even though this seems rather far-fetched) to the Old Kingdom relief which shows a squatting man performing circumcision (Hertzberg). That does not eliminate the difficulty of Unit . (LXX simply omits the word, but this certainly seems to be a case where the lectio difficilior is to be preferred, for it would be impossible to explain how the word appeared in MT.) J. Sasson ( Circumcision , in JBL , LXXXV, 1966, p. 474) suggests that in Josh., v the Israelites are indeed circumcized a "second" time by having their foreskins completely removed, whereas previously they were circumcized according to the Egyptian method, which was supposedly only a dorsal incision on the foreskin. However, nowhere do we find a prescription of a pro- per technique or a concern for a certain method of circumcision, such as we would expect to find if this were an issue. 71 See B. Stade, Der ' Hügel der Vorhäute *, in ZAW, VI, 1886, pp. 132 ff. REVUE BIBLIQUE 38</page><page sequence="38">594 MICHAEL V. FOX How did this fertility device work? Th. Ploss suggested that cir- cumcision was essentially a medical operation intended to prevent phimosis and thus ensure the greatest number of offspring72. But most cases of phimosis could be cured by circumcision of the individual sufferer, if the peoples practicing circumcision were really conscious of its medical value. Furthermore, if circumcision were primarily preventative medicine, it would most suitably be performed in the neonatal phase, which is rarely the case outside Israel. Nor is there evidence that it was intended to influence the will or win the favor of deity by being, for example, a sacrifice to the goddess of fertility designed to win her favor in the production of offspring73. Circum- cision was rarely associated with a specific deity or deities. What's more, circumcision is rarely associated with distinctly religious cere- monies, this being known only among the Jews, the New Caledonians, the Fijians and possibly the Totonacs 74. Furthermore, virtually nowhere outside Israel is there any attempt to explain the origin of circumcision or give it a rationale. The very vagueness and anonym- ity surrounding circumcision suggest that circumcision belongs to the realm of magic, the attempt to compel the nameless Power that is above and behind deity as well as man. In Gen., xvii we get one of the few glimpses into the nature and function of circumcision, yet this too is not clear and explicit, for reasons we will see shortly. In Gen., xvii, P is once again reinter- preting an old rite with a view of removing its magical overtones. He does this by designating the rite as an *ôt, but here alone of all the priestly 'oż-etiologies he does not tell us the function and purpose of the *6t, but only identifies it at length. Why does P's precise and strict schema fail him here? Even in Num., xvii, 25, which is not a complete etiology, he gives element c (the purpose, viz. action), although he omits b (cognition), which is at any rate obvious. Else- where all three etiological elements, identification, function, and purpose, are stated explicitly. There must be something in the function and purpose of this particular *ot that made him avoid stating these elements. Here we may use an argument ex silentio, justified because P is so carefully not silent with regard to these elements in the other *ot- etiologies. I suggest that circumcision is a cognition sign - like the 78 Th. Ploss, Das Kind , Berlin, 1882, p. 364; Idem, Geschichtliches und Ethnologisches über Knabenbeschneidungt Leipzig, 1885. 78 Contrary to G. A.

P understandably felt it incongruous to express elements b and c in full, to say, for example: "When I see it I will remember the everlasting covenant between me and you and I will make you increase exceedingly." In plain language that means that God will see the Israelite's circumcised penis during or before sexual congress and will remember to keep his covenant by making the union a fruitful one. P is led to this interpretation by his having fit the rite of cir- cumcision into his ^-etiology schema, but he understandably finds it inappropriate to give the schema in full. No other understanding of the function of this yot can explain why here alone he avoids giving the whole schema. The schema has attained independent force. Orig- inally the means of expressing an interpretation of some phenome- non, it becomes an independent agent dictating the interpretation. Let us consider the other possible interpretations of this *ot. It is not a proof sign, because it has no inner persuasive force, and there is no hint that it is supposed to convince anyone of anything; if that were so, the narrator would have to say what is to be proved, and there is no reason why he would not say it. Nor is it a symbol sign, for it does not convey knowledge by some inner resemblance to that which is to be known. It is not an identity sign designating one as belonging to the covenanted people, for first of all no one would see it. (There is no point in referring the custom to a time when people went naked, for that custom is certainly not relevant for P, and even in earliest times Israelites did not go naked.) Anyway it would not be of much use in distinguishing the Israelites from their neighbors, because many of them were also circumcised. And Ishmael, who as P takes pains to emphasize is not part of the covenant, is also circum- cised. For practical purposes circumcision could at most distinguish the Israelites from the Philistines, who are not an issue for P. However, it is true that circumcision can secondarily effect a heightening of tribal consciousness and can be used, as in Hellenistic and Roman times, to identify a member of the people, if someone is intent upon doing so. The circumcision is an *ôt berit in the sense that it is a reminder of the covenant, like the rainbow. Like the rainbow, it is a reminder to God, not man, and as we have seen, P believes in the need for remind- ers to God. We cannot suppose that it is a reminder to the Israelites to fulfill some duty, because this covenant requires nothing of Israel other than circumcision, and circumcision Cannot be a reminder of itself. If the purpose of circumcision is to remind man to perform some</page><page sequence="40">596 MICHAEL V. FOX action, the reader could have no idea what is meant, since nothing of the sort is hinted at in this chapter. But he could understand what is alluded to if the purpose of circumcision is fertility, because that is the main subject of the introduction. (But, in fact, the effec- tiveness of circumcision as a fertility device would not be dependent on the Israelite's comprehension of its meaning, so the writer would not be obliged to make it explicit.) And circumcision can ensure progeny only by influencing God's will. The covenant in Gen., xvii is not conditional - it will not be cancelled because of Israel's behavior - but it does have a condition, namely that the individual Israelite do his part to aid God in fulfilling his part, in the same way that he must aid God by the pascal blood. If he neglects this duty he will naturally be cut off from the covenantal blessing (xvii, 14), just as he would naturally suffer the consequences of his neglect if he failed to daub the doorpost with blood, without any juridical action, divine or human, being necessary to effect the punishment. In Gen., xvii P is doing what we have seen him do in the other ^-etiologies. He is eliminating the magical or mythic significance of an ancient phenomenon by converting it into a cognition sign. He may be carrying this conversion further by moving circumcision from puberty or marriage to birth, thus telling us that there is no direct connection between circumcision and fertility, but only an indi- rect connection through the mediation of God's covenant. Of course his logic is not unassailable. A modern might argue that if God needs a cognition sign he is not truly omniscient, and if he is not omniscient how can he see this sign in the usual circumstances in which coitus is performed? But there is no reason to assume that God's powers of sight and knowledge could not extend to such cir- cumstances, and at any rate P is not always strictly logical in his explanations of the function of the 'ôtôt. The rainbow could not really function in the way it is said to, because it appears after the storm has ended. In fact the slight incongruities in the logic of P's interpretations of the signs shows that he is not creating them for the sake of the context. He is taking already existent phenomena and not totally eliminating their original meaning, but rather permuting that meaning by fitting it into his 'oi-schema. Such a combination cannot result in perfect consistency. Michael V. Fox.</page></plain_text>
