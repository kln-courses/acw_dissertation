<plain_text><page sequence="1">ONTOLOGY CHARLES TAYLOR THE questions traditionally known as ontological have sometimes been summed up in the deceptively simple interrogative: "What is there?" But this formulation is notoriously misleading, because it suggests that we are already quite clear as to what "Being" is, i.e. as to what we mean when we say of something, that it exists. And this is not always so. Moreover, when we make statements like, "Time exists", "redness exists", it is almost never so. Statements of this kind, of course, are very uncommon. We could imagine a situa- tion in which they could have a use, but only a rhetorical use. We would be hard put to say how to go about answering them or debating them. But this confusion seems to arise from our temptation to treat time, universals, etc., like some strange kind of particulars inhabiting the world along with tables, chairs, seas and mountains. As long as we try to do this, we are deeply perplexed by the problem of what "time" and "red" stand for. But, as we now know, underlying all this is a poverty of insight into the logic of our language. Once we have overcome the belief that all substantives stand for some kind of particulars, the problem disappears; we no longer have to invent "third realms" or "objectives" or remake language over in the image of a calculus. The ghosts go back into their cupboards. There is, therefore, no problem of ontology here. The problem was one simply of understanding correctly the logical roles of the different terms of our language. Once we have understood them correctly, there is no more point debating whether "time exists" or "whiteness exists". We know that the answer to these questions is a simple "yes", if by these strange and strained locutions we mean simply to ask whether "time" and "white" are intelligible in their normal employment. And what else could we mean by them? The "Platonic" entities were really ghosts, and they behaved as such from the begin- ning. They couldn't even be mistaken for real concrete objects, they seemed to glide over and through tables, chairs, houses, fields, etc., but they had a kind of disquieting presence which demanded some recognition. Now we see that it was just the shadows cast by our language for particulars which took us in. This pseudo-problem of ontology was posed for us, in a sense, by our language. This was, of course, not always made explicit in the discussions of the problem, but these discussions can be understood, and perhaps most clearly, if we look at them from this point of view. The question was: To what entities are we committed by the I25</page><page sequence="2">P H I L 0 S 0 P H Y fact that we speak the language that we do? Of what are we (logi- cally) forced to recognize the existence, on pain of convicting our language of meaninglessness, which would be an absurdity? The pseudo-problem of ontology arose from using this undiscriminative portmanteau word "entity", or, we might say, of interpreting the "what" of the second question as a simple demand for enumeration, as though we already were clear as to what "exists" meant. But there is another problem, a real one, which does arise if we give this question a different interpretation. We shall perhaps be able to outline this kind of question most clearly by studying three examples, one couched in language whose credentials we never think of examining, another in language whose ontological commitments are flatly rejected by some and affirmed by others, and a third in language we all have to accept as meaningful but which, nevertheless, raises problems for us. As the first example we might take the statement: "The children are sleeping." In the unlikely event that someone did not understand what we mean by "sleeping", we could explain this by pointing to the children, by imitation, by talking of unconsciousness, of not answering when spoken to, etc. And usually we should not have to go any further, if we even had to go this far. But suppose, per impos- sibile, that our questioner wanted to call into question the use of the concept sleeping, not just this use, but all uses. He might do this on the grounds that he could not see that there was any distinction between sleeping and waking. This is a very fanciful example but it can serve to show us that we would have to move to a different level of argument. All previous explanation was in terms that assumed this distinction as given, so we tried to explain "sleeping" in terms of the distinction between waking and not waking. Even our "osten- sive" definition was meant to draw our interlocutor's attention to this distinction. We point to the children, and say: "See, that is sleeping; we are awake and they are asleep." In other words, all our explanations assume that human beings are the kind of beings that can be characterized as awake or asleep. Now this assumption is so evident that we would never think of calling it into question. And almost no one has; perhaps only a certain number of Hindu philosophers can be considered to have done so. But if we had to reply to questioning of this type, it is clear that we couldn't go on giving our original explanations over again. Something different is being asked for. It is difficult to think of exactly what we would reply at this point. But perhaps, given our faith in science and scientific language, we might look for the justi- fication of our talking in this way to physiology, and once we had spelled out the physiological criteria for the distinction, we would be satisfied that no further doubts could be entertained on this i26</page><page sequence="3">ONTOLOGY score. This might of course raise other ontological questions, but we shall come back to these later. The above example was somewhat of a fantasy, because no one would think of questioning the credentials of the predicate "is sleeping". But we might now look at an example at the other end of the scale, i.e. a statement whose terms many would question in this way: "The children are in a state of grace." This, too, could be explained to someone who didn't understand what was being said by the use of terms like sin, repentance, atonement, or by referring the questioner to the Epistles of St. Paul. But this kind of explana- tion would often not be to the point. When they ask what this state- ment means, people are often implicitly calling into question the whole stratum of language in which both statement and explana- tion are couched. They are asking to be shown cause why they should admit that these concepts have a use at all. Are human beings the kind of beings of whom we can say meaningfully that they are in a state of sin or in a state of grace? This question is ontological. Let us now look at the third example: "The children are insolent." This raises a problem that it is difficult to ignore. We are asked what we mean by this statement. We answer by pointing to, or describing the kind of behaviour-in this case that part of the actual behaviour of the children-which we classify as insolent: they stick out their tongues, chant uncomplimentary remarks, etc. Usually, again, this will be enough to clear up any questions. But not those of a philo- sophical questioner. For "insolent" carries implications which are not clarified simply by describing the behaviour that we characterize as insolent, that is not unless the terms in which we describe this behaviour also carry these implications. Our philosophical inter- locutor may be questioning these implications and hence the right we have to use this kind of language in the first place. Objections of this kind raise questions which cannot properly be called "ontological". For they challenge the assumptions about the world which would justify us in using these predicates, and which, therefore, their use presupposes.' In using "presupposes", we do not mean that the truth of statements couched in these terms entails the truth of the assumptions, but rather that the statements couldn't have a truth value at all, if the assumptions were not true. But it is clear that we cannot come to grips with questions of this kind by asking simply: "What is there?" For the philosophical objector is not just asking us to subtract from our universe some "entities" about whose nature we are agreed. We come much closer to the point if I Cf. Introduction to Logical Theory, Ch. 6, III, 7. This sense of "presuppose" is closely related to that used by Mr. Strawson in this section, although not identical with it. I27</page><page sequence="4">P H I L O S O P H Y we say that he is almost always challenging our account of the nature or "manner of being" of things whose existence we would both affirm. This interpretation is confirmed when we notice that ontological questions, as in the examples above, also arise in con- nection with concepts in their use as predicates, and not simply in connection with substantive expressions. Ontological questions are not, however, always the result of whimsical objections to ordinary concepts as in the first example. Some of them are in a sense unavoidable, i.e. they are posed for us by certain dilemmas which arise out of the use of our language; when, e.g. two different kinds of particular, one incompatible with the other, seem to have equal right to occupy the same logical space, or when we seem to be able to say two or more incompatible things about a given particular. The lest of this section will be concerned with an attempt to out- line two such problems, and the next will be taken up with a few tentative suggestions for how to deal with them. The third example above can be used to illustrate a problem of this sort, which has been the subject of much dispute among philo- sophers. "The children are insolent" can be explained by "The children are engaging in such and such behaviour" only if the behaviour terms used here are understood to qualify something different from, say, the operations of machines, natural processes, or even the behaviour of some animals. We sometimes express this difference clumsily by saying that something "more" is involved in human behaviour. This is also a dangerous mode of expression, as has been pointed out, e.g. by Professor Ryle.' We can perhaps say that the difference is that the behaviour has a sense, a "meaning"; we sometimes speak also of a purpose. In calling the children insolent we are saying that they are indulging in behaviour which has the same meaning for them as for us, i.e. that they are behaving in this way wilfully. But there is a danger of misunderstanding here again, we are not adding something "more" to their behaviour, something called "meaning". It is not behaviour plus. Rather, and the usual sense of the word "behaviour" carries this force, we are talking about the kind of thing which has meaning, and this is one of the points that differentiated it from natural processes and events. All this, is, in a sense, hidden behind the statement that the children are insolent, and the explanation of this in terms of their behaviour. We can make ourselves understood in explanations of this type, precisely because we can hit on pieces of behaviour which have this meaning for those who are questioning us. They can recognize it as insolent behaviour. But what does not come out in this kind of explanation is the ontological commitments of this area I Concept of Mind. I28</page><page sequence="5">ONTOLOGY of our discourse, i.e. what there must be for statements couched in it to have a truth-value, in this case behaviour by sentient beings, differing from movements of material objects or natural processes, in being endowed with a meaning. Not to admit such behaviour is to hold that this discourse is not literally meaningful. In order to avoid long locutions, we might simply refer to this kind of behaviour as "behaviour" tout-court. Now it is clear that almost no one will want to refuse to admit that we can talk meaning- fully of behaviour. But a problem does seem to arise when we wish to make clear how it differs from, and is related to, e.g. events and processes in nature. Again, this problem is in some sense unavoid- able, because we seem forced to recognize that it also consists of events and processes in nature. The children are, after all, also material objects, and their sticking out the tongues, and chanting of rude melodies are also events in the world just as a stone's rolling, or a leaf's falling, are. The problem in its most general form concerns the relations between the two strata of our language, that we use to talk about material objects, including of course human beings in so far as we speak of them as material objects-we might call this M-language-and that we use to talk about persons (and some animals) and their behaviour, or P-language. Thus "red", "six foot high", "fell on to the pavement", and "impermeable", are examples of M-predicates, and "insolent", "taking a walk", "intelligent", "answering to his name", are examples of P-predicates. This prob- lem is an ontological one in that it concerns the relations between the kind of things we are talking about in these two languages. One disastrous way of solving this problem has been to say that whereas M-language can be used to describe only one kind of event, an external one, P-language is used to describe two events at once, external and internal. Thus P-statements are often really con- junctions. This theory is a natural extension of the view, mentioned above, that behaviour is somehow a natural process, plus one thing "more". This "more" is here construed as being an internal process which accompanies the external one. This theory, of course, assumes that the only publicly perceptible events are those which M-language speaks of. But, as Professor Ryle has shown, this "inner man" theory breaks down because, the internal events being imperceptible to all but myself, I could never be taught how to speak about them by others. I would have to invent a kind of "private" language, a vocabulary of private terms, to speak about my own behaviour. Now a private language is a patent absurdity, not only for the obvious factual reason that we all have learnt the language we speak, including our P-language, from our parents or those who brought us up, but also for the quasi-logical reason that our language is used for meaningful communication, a possibility that is excluded I I29</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY by the theory that we all develop our own P-language inside our- selves. This is a quasi-logical reason, because although it may be a contingent fact that we can talk about ourselves and each other and the world, to each other in language, it is a necessary fact, once we have this language, that it be meaningful, and it is a precondition of its being meaningful that the P-predicates of this language have the same meaning when ascribed to oneself as they have when ascribed to others. A means of communication cannot be both meaningful and unintelligible. The proponents of the "inner man" theory tried to get around this objection by saying that we infer the sense or purpose of a person's behaviour by inference from the external act to the internal act. But this argument reposed on an illegitimate generalization. The "inference" could only be made if the link could be established in certain privileged instances without a need for inference. We do in fact infer sometimes what a person is thinking, what his attitude or mood is by watching his behaviour. But this is only possible because we have in fact privileged instances. And this is exactly what is denied by the "inner man" theory. If we did not have privi- leged instances we could never be able to classify pieces of behaviour in the first place. The question would arise, how do we ever learn to characterize a given piece of behaviour as insolent, or as exhibiting boredom or pain? The answer that I have the "privileged instances" in my own case will not do. I do not imitate someone's angry expres- sion in front of a mirror before I can decide that he is angry. I do not witness a large part of my own behaviour, e.g. my facial expres- sions, at all. I am still ignorant of what I look like when enraged, as I was ignorant of the sound of my voice until I heard it on a tape- recorder. The explanation that I infer from my own case assumes, as acquired from the start, what it sets out to explain the acquisition of. I see the anger in your face and know it for anger, and also as the same emotion I underwent yesterday. In order to be able to use our P-predicates meaningfully at all, we must sometimes be able to see that they apply. But this refutation does not dissolve the initial problem. It poses it again, but in a way which brings out more clearly the ontological presuppositions of our P-language, i.e. that our behaviour or talk, cannot be construed as dealing with natural processes or events, or natural processes and events plus something "more", but that it presupposes a different kind of thing, or event, heterogeneous to the kind of thing or event spoken of in M-language. And this is at the root of our ontological problem. It might, however, be objected that the "more" can be construed in such a way as to escape the above argument, that the supposed ontological problem is not a real one. It might be argued that our I30</page><page sequence="7">ONTOLOGY P-language can be construed not as presupposing an odd kind of event, heterogeneous to those described in M-language, but rather as talking about the same kind of event in concepts of a different logical type. This is one possible interpretation of the thesis of Professor Ryle in his Concept of Mind. I Professor Ryle interprets the statements of our P-language not as categoricals but as "mongrel-categoricals". These are statements lying logically between the categorical and the hypothetical. They are categoricals and also "partially satisfied open hypothetical state- ments". They describe events, but also in the same logical breath, as it were, tell us that the event satisfies partially an open hypo- thetical statement. Thus the P-statement "he boasted from vanity", for example, is to be construed: "he boasted on meeting the stranger and his doing so satisfies the lawlike proposition that whenever he finds a chance of securing the admiration and envy of others, he does whatever he thinks will produce this admiration or envy."' But it is difficult to see how we could ever understand the state- ment "he boasted from vanity" as a mongrel-categorical, if we had not already understood it or used it on other occasions as a simple categorical. For the difference between "he boasted from vanity" and, say, "he boasted from insolence", cannot in all cases simply lie in the difference between the open hypothetical statements that each incorporates, and that the events in question are held to have partially satisfied. It is true that, if we were in doubt as to which of these two statements we should use to talk about a given event, we should look to the behaviour of the person in question on other like occasions in order to decide. But we should have to know what we were looking for; we should have to be able to distinguish a vain action from an insolent action in order to carry on this research. In other words, we should have to witness the kind of thing which we would describe by the simple categorical: "He did x from vanity." We come once again to the conclusion of the discussion above on the "inner man" theory: in order to be able to use our P-predicates meaningfully at all, we must sometimes be able simply to see that they apply. And we return to the ontological presuppositions of our P-language, viz. that the "behaviour" it talks about, is a different kind of thing to the events our M-language describes, and the dif- ference lies inter alia in the fact that the former, and the former only, can be qualified as "insolent", "clever", and so on in exactly the same way as the latter can be qualified as "slow", "barely visible", and so on, i.e. in simple categorical statements. The trouble with the thesis of Professor Ryle, or at least with this I P. 33. For another possible interpretation, see below, pp. I40-I41 I Op. cit., p. 89. I3I</page><page sequence="8">P H I L O S O P H Y interpretation of his thesis, is that it seems to share some of the same presuppositions as the theory of the "Ghost-in-the-Machine", i.e. that what we see when we witness the behaviour of someone is properly describable only in M-language, but this implies that P-statements are simply M-statements "plus", and this is what starts the wild goose chase of which both the "Ghost-in-the-Machine" and the "inference-licences" are the rival but illusory results. Thus, in discussing the P-predicate "skilful"' Professor Ryle says: The spectators applaud the skill of a clown, "but what they applaud is not some extra hidden performance in his head. It is his visible per- formance that they admire".' The dilemma posed here, of course, can be expressed in the question: how can the spectators applaud the clown's skill if they do not witness it? The intellectualist answer, that the skill is an "inner act" which the spectators infer from the "visible performance" will not do, as Professor Ryle points out. A skill is clearly "not an act". But neither is it something to which the predicates "witnessable"-"unwitnessable" do not apply. The point is that the skill exercised in the performance can be recorded by the camera. For the clown's performance is skilful, just as his motley is red, white and black. The error arises from a misunderstanding of what is meant by the "visible performance". This is misconstrued as the kind of event describable only in M-language. Thus it is con- cluded that the P-predicates "skilful" cannot really be ascribed to it, and thus either must be ascribed to another "inner" act (intellec- tualism), or else is really a word of a different logical type. But all our talk of "skilful", "unskilful", "clumsy", and so on would make no sense if clowns' tumblings weren't the kind of thing which can be skilful, just as their clothes are ragged, and their noses red. The confusion here is analogous to another confusion in the theory of science, which might cast some light on it. The language of, say, Newtonian science, grew out of our ordinary M-language, but it is not always seen that its ontological presuppositions have been altered in the process. This seems to be at the root of some of the problems of metaphysics in science. Thus, in the context of modem science, "explanation" might be taken to mean "bringing under a law".3 A given event is explained when it is shown that it conforms to a certain recognized "uni- formity of nature", or when a certain uniformity is discovered to which it conforms. Now this theory is certainly very plausible, and, at the least, we can say that it brings to the fore very important aspects of scientific practice, but it is clear that it does very little to make clear the concept "explain" as this is used in ordinary language I Op. cit., P. 33. 2 The italics are mine. 3 Cf. "What is explanation?" (in Essays in Conceptual Analysis), by John Hospers. 132</page><page sequence="9">ONTOLOGY (I am still speaking, of course, of the concept "explain why" that Hospers is discussing). For in ordinary language "explain" has some- thing of the force "give the cause for". The confusion between the two kinds of explanation has done much to breed metaphysics in science. "Everyday explanation",' as we might call it, often consists in the statement of a causal con- nection. Now this causal connection, unlike the "constant conjunc- tion" of which Hume spoke, deals with single instances, and the statement that A causes B may contain no reference explicit or implicit to a class of events. "B happened because A" may not be stating a law or a deductive conclusion of which one of the premises is a law. We can see this when we speak of the avalanche sweeping the house away, the bullet causing his death, and his death bringing me to a realization of my own guilt. "Cause" also embodies "power". That A caused B, implies in a sense that A forced B into existence, or, as we often say, "made" B happen. That Jones was knocked unconscious by the much smaller Smith, astonishes us, because we didn't think Smith had the strength to do it. "Cause" has also frequently some implication of "purpose", but this is not general. Another striking thing about this concept is that it freely crosses the boundary between the human and the non-human; it cuts right across the distinction above, between P-language and M-language. "My unforgiving attitude was the cause of his death, which made her very unhappy." This concept of "cause" is of course understood by human beings largely because they can manipulate their own environment and themselves be affected by it. But it would be false to say that we attribute human powers to things, and indulge in "animism". This latter accusation is the result of a total misunderstanding of the difference between everyday and scientific explanation. Causal relations hold between the particulars, the things and events spoken of in our everyday language. This is a kind of cor- rolary of their application to singular instances as mentioned above. By contrast, the "constant conjunctions" or "uniformities of nature" with which scientific laws deal, hold between, one might almost say, abstracted aspects of these things and events. The partic- ular spoken of in a statement of causal relation has a certain smell, a certain look, and so on. But the things and events spoken about in laws have only those characteristics which can be evalued by num- bers. This purification of ordinary language which results in scientific language, is in a sense a step in the direction of mathematics. What I Of course "everyday" explanation often borrows a great deal from natural science, but even so, the explanations have frequently a different sense in their "everyday" context. See below. I33</page><page sequence="10">P H I L O S O P H Y is peculiar to one instance is no longer relevant, we are now speaking of classes. But this language is still empirical. The most famous example of a scientific concept which is neither the particular of ordinary language nor the symbol of the mathe- matical system is the Newtonian "body". This entity is not really in the same "world" as chairs, tables, houses, and so on, but nor is it in a class with the Euclidian point, line and plane. It is clear that causal relation on one hand, and law-like uni- formities on the other, hold between quite different kinds of thing. This results from the fact that scientific language is a "purged" language. This purge has been tremendously useful in extending our knowledge of, and power to change our environment, one might say that it has been necessary for this progress, although it is diffi- cult to be dogmatic because another purge might have done as well, for all we know. But we can say that scientific language has made possible a knowledge about our world which goes way beyond what we can understand by "analogy" with our own behaviour, i.e. basically the kind of thing we describe in statements of causal relation. But the sense of this progress is obscured if we do not understand that there has been a purge-if we try to as- similate what we have learnt from, say, Newton, to the kind of thing that our everyday un-Newtonian speech describes as "A made B happen". The ontological "gap" that arises can be seen if we try to examine how a new language stratum is taught. The theory that teaching language requires a foundation of "ostensive definition", after which the superstructure can be built by definition or logical equiva- lences, must be cast aside. The use of the concept of (Newtonian) "body" can neither be taught by ostension nor by the giving of equivalents. We can teach colour words to someone who has none, e.g. by showing him two cubes, similar in all respects except that one is black and the other white. But this procedure will not work if we want to explain to him how to understand the word "body" as used in Newton's laws. We can perhaps teach him this by verbal ex- planations, i.e. by "lopping off" all the respects in which we do not want him to consider the material objects around him. This could be done in slightly misleading fashion by saying that a "body" has no colour, no smell and so on for all the "secondary" qualities. But if he took this literally, he would be perplexed, as philosophers were perplexed for centuries. But after all, we do manage to learn these new languages. We just pick them up, as a baby picks up language in the first place, but in neither one case nor the other, do we have the phenomenon of "pure" ostension. The baby and the student both learn terms which have both a referential and a classifying job. The phenomenon of "pure" ostension only exists, if I34</page><page sequence="11">ONTOLOGY at all, within a given language stratum of which the learner is already master, when he asks, e.g. "What is a tramcar?" Thus, some of the problems of the philosophy of science, as well as some of those of the philosophy of mind arise from a failure to recognize ontological "gaps". In trying to treat the laws of science like ordinary language statements, we fell into the metaphysical trap laid for us by the notion of "cause". Periodic purges are carried out to eradicate this and related notions, and they are characterized with such prejoratives as "occult forces", "otiose hypotheses", and "metaphysical entities", but the way is paved for their return as long as no distinction is made between the. two languages, and return they did. Similarly in the philosophy of mind, as long as P-language was treated as a sort of M-language, it was inevitable that extra entities should be invented, like "Souls", "Minds", "Transcendental Egos", and so on, so that P-language could have something to talk about. After all M-language had sticks, stones, chairs and mountains, so what was the objection to leaving P-language in peace with Minds? But this was ridiculous because this extra entity was not visible, tangible, countable, in short all the things that the entities about which M-language spoke are supposed to be. And so, like "cause" in physics, it was periodically thrown out, but this result was absurd, because P-language ceased to make any sense. As long as no dis- tinction was made between the two languages the way was paved for its return. Professor Ryle is right in attributing the responsibility for this problem in large part to Descartes.' But the hare was not started in the place that Professor Ryle indicates. Descartes said certainly that a person had both a body and a mind, but this was simply an incidental error. The original error is to be found in the thesis that the body is to be spoken of as a kind of machine. Once this is accepted, the soul has to be invented to avoid absurdity. II The solution of some philosophical problems requires that we recognize not only the distinctions in the logic of the different terms I Of course Descartes was never guilty of the crass "Cartesianism" that is so justly pilloried in Concept of Mind. Mind and body were not separate, but were in "intimate union". But the manner of their union remained obscure for philosophy. "It is in life and ordinary conversation and in abstaining from meditation and from the study of those things that exercise the imagination, that one learns to understand the union of soul and body" (Letter to Elizabeth, 28th June, i643). The philosophical question to which vulgar Cartesianism is one answer remained. I35</page><page sequence="12">P H I L O S O P H Y we use, but also the distinctions between the ontological presupposi- tions of different strata of our language. But these problems, unlike those dealt with simply by a clarification of the "logic of language", are not simply "dissolved". For some strata of our language are, in a sense, in conflict with others, i.e. they presuppose a "world" in which the things and happenings we speak about in the other strata cannot find a place. And once we have made the distinction between these strata, and the aporias based on their confusion disappear, the problem of their relation to each other remains. Our ontological commitments clash. The concepts of, e.g. biology, physiology, psychology and psy- chiatry raise problems of this kind when we try to relate them to ordinary language and to each other. We might be tempted to ask: how can we ever understand these languages, if we can't draw the logical relations of one of them to the other or of any of them to ordinary language? Are not these concepts "metaphysical" in the sense that, if one takes one's stand in any one language, the others can be shown to have no sense. This after all was the procedure of the Logical Positivists, although they were never quite sure whether to anchor their artillery in the solid cement of physical theory, or to immure themselves behind a wall of sense-data. The latter proved to be a smoke screen rather than a fortified position, but those entrenched in the former positions had no difficulty in reducing to ashes all statements outside of their charmed circle. Similarly, if one takes one's stand in ordinary language, that of physical theory can- not be given an interpretation, and nor can, e.g. the statements of Freud. But there is no justification for this civil war. For we can and do learn to use all these languages. We learn them just as we learn our first language. The idea that learning language involves an ostensive "leap", after which the higher concepts are explained by the giving of logical equivalences, is radically false. Pure "ostensive definitions" can only be given to someone already familiar with the language stratum in question. When one is trying to "enter" a new language stratum, straining to understand what the psychologist or the physicist is talking about, ostension does no good, or at least is not sufficient. I can point to the table and say "molecules", or to the child and say "Oedipus stage", but this will do no good unless my interlocutor already has some idea of what kind of thing I'm talking about, i.e. has an idea of the ontology of the language stratum in which these terms figure. He must not only know, as Wittgenstein points out, "the post at which the word is stationed",' but he must also know the army in which it serves. If I point to the table and say "brown", and he takes this to mean what I mean by "table", he I Philosophical Investigations. I36</page><page sequence="13">ONTOLOGY makes one kind of mistake, but if I say "molecules", and he takes this to mean "table", the error is of a different kind. Tables can be brown, but molecules cannot. And so we have to know something of the language stratum to understand its individual concepts. But, at the same time, we can- not explain the language stratum, except in terms of these individual concepts. Molecules are not just parts of the table which we refer to in everyday speech. We return to the problem mentioned in the first section, that all explanations of concepts or statements of a given language stratum are in terms which share the same onto- logical presuppositions. We are, in a sense, locked out of a new language, the circle is closed, and we cannot find a gap by which to enter. But we do manage somehow to get inside. We do so by the same kind of non-logical leap by which we first entered the universe of speech of our parents. The child just "catches on" to a new aptitude or the point of a joke. The discontinuities in our language occasioned by the ontological gaps require that we make "leaps" of this kind later in life, as well, but in the later cases as in the first, we leave no logical footprints by which we can trace our progress in a series of logical relations. We might say that we learn to see the world in a new light, to look at it from a new point of view. In modem civili- zation we accomplish many of these leaps early and easily, but some are still very difficult. Thus schoolroom physics raises no problems but psychiatry often baffles us. When we turn to reflect on the progress we have made, we some- times have an experience somewhat similar to double vision. The world of physics and the world of everyday, the psyche of psycho- analysts and the mind of ordinary speech, these parts and others will not converge into single images. Our logical focus is askew. The problems that arise are philosophers' questions, but the experience of perplexity is not confined to philosophers. In particular, it is philosophers who take this as the starting point of metaphysical systems, but they are not alone in giving credence to them. We can always relieve the pressure of puzzlement by a kind of temporary cultural retreat, which we all operate at some time or other. For our ordinary language in a restricted sense of the word has no ontological gaps. By "ordinary language" in this context, is meant what our speech has in common with primitive languages, i.e. language before the introduction of the most rudimentary science.' I Of course, primitive languages differ among themselves as to ontology, and in particular the "primitive" part of our language is deeply impregnated with the ontology of physical sciences. But it is the internal homogeneity of our speech at a certain low level of sophistication which is under discussion here. I37</page><page sequence="14">P H I L O S O P H Y At this level there is no conflict between M-language and P-language, partly because we are not looking on the former as a kind of rough and clumsy version of the language of science. Thus, e.g. unsophisti- cated M-language is often impregnated with "animism", although this characterization misses the point, because, as Comte and the Positivists failed to realize, the primitive is not propounding a false scientific theory, he is not propounding a scientific theory at all, he is not talking in the language stratum of any science. His language is, in a sense, below the level of consciousness at which science can begin. Certain questions have not yet been asked. Thus many concepts straddle the boundary between M- and P-language, includ- ing, for instance, the notion of "cause", as discussed above.' But this description still misses the point, for the distinction between M- and P-language has no point at this level. All attempts to describe the mental furniture of the primitive come up against the obstacle that our second-order language in which the description is made belongs itself to a higher level of sophistication. We have to have recourse to an imaginative "phenomenological" description, or else confine ourselves to saying what the "world" of the primitive is not. With these reservations, however, we can say that primitive speech and our corresponding everyday speech does not make the ontological distinction between person and thing. The language for things has not been purged of its "anthropomorphic" implications, and correspondingly that for persons does not yet speak of "con- sciousness". When we reflect on our language, we do so with the intellectual tools of an advanced civilization, and we cannot help but pose our- selves ontological problems, but we can live unreflectingly in the "world" of the primitive. Most people are forced to do so most of the time, if for no other reason, at least to earn their living. Fortu- nately, or unfortunately, philosophers earn theirs by not living at this level. The problems are posed by the advance of science, or at least by a greater awareness of the nature of the world around us. Once we begin to talk about nature in terms that are not animistic, we begin to wonder about persons, for they, after all, are parts of nature, are material objects also, But we want to say that they are something "more" as well, and we are already on the point of inventing the "Mind". Then we wish to make our material-object language more rigorous again, and so we try to talk of the world around us in terms of measurements. But then our conception of the intersensorial unity of the object changes radically. For space measured by sight and touch is not immediately commensurable with aural or olfactory space. Of the latter, the first can be talked about in terms of pitch I p. I33. I38</page><page sequence="15">ONTOLOGY and loudness, the second, in terms of density, and so on. All these quantitative distinctions couldn't be thrown together into a mixed bag of calculations. Besides it is extremely difficult to make actual (i.e. numerical) measurements of sounds and smells. Some common ground had to be found. Of course the qualities perceptible to one sense only (secondary qualities) were the first to be sloughed off because any measurements made of them couldn't be used for calculations together with those of size and weight; (they reappeared of course as "particles" emitted from things, affecting our senses in diverse ways). And primary qualities were not long in following them. In this way other gaps appeared between P-language and the purified M-language. The new-model material-object did not seem to be the kind of thing of which we could say "I see it" or "I hear it". The problem of perception arose. We have ceased to say that some particular language is the "real" way to talk about things. But we have not really answered the ques- tions raised by the introduction of new language strata in doing so. We are still perplexed when we try to understand the relations between what we talk about in one stratum and what we talk about in others. In a sense, the questions we ask in this domain are unanswerable. But they are not, for all that, imaginary questions. We might now make clear what we mean by "unanswerable", and hence the status of so-called "metaphysical" statements about ontology. Let us take for instance the problem of the relation between P-language and M-language. This has been the subject of much philosophizing in the past few centuries. In particular much of what has been called materialism and idealism has arisen in part from a search for the "real" language in which to talk about man, or from a choice and justification of one of the existing languages as the "real" language. In our day this problem is still debated in some form or another, e.g. by Professor Ryle and by M. Merleau-Ponty. It is generally agreed that one cannot just entrench oneself in one language stratum and reject the ontology of all others, as did, e.g. the Logical Posi- tivists and some neo-Kantians, e.g. Alain and Lachieze-Rey, but beyond that there is not much agreement as to method. Professor Ryle has tried to draw the logical relations of P-statements to M-statements, while Merleau-Ponty is trying to find a new scientific language which will embody the ordinary language ontology of persons. For our ordinary (primitive) language predicates of one particular both M-predicates and P-predicates,i and this particular, the I Strawson's lectures on "Individuals". I39</page><page sequence="16">P H I L 0 S 0 P H Y "person", is thus neither the "body" of M-language nor the "mind" of the intellectualist theory. Merleau-Ponty attacks the language of science, e.g. psychology, physiology, because it does not have place in its ontology for persons. It therefore explains phenomena we would describe with ordinary statements in a language modelled on M-language. But the problem is that this is really at once an unfair and a fruitless attack-unfair because the different languages of physiology, psychology, etc., have achieved their rigour precisely by the exclusion of P-language, fruitless because they must continue to exclude P-language if they are to remain scientific languages, i.e. usable for experimentation in the sciences to which they belong. The problem is that the only language in which the unity between P- and M-language obtains is precisely our "primitive" language. The cultural advance made possible by the development of and purification of M-language, and the M- model languages of psycho- logy and psychiatry, can only be achieved at the expense of a separa- tion from this primitive ontology. We cannot return to the primal unity of body and soul without really returning to it, and refusing to say anything more sophisticated than what can be said in ordinary language. The "pre-objective world" cannot contain the language of science in its universe of discourse. Conversely, we cannot "explain" our P-language statements in scientific terms without losing the ontology of persons. The result of trying the impossible must therefore be one of two things. Either we explain our P-statements, in a mixture of scien- tific terminology and P-language used in a poetic way. But then we have just invented a new language stratum, which adds to the con- fusion, particularly since its terms are also the terms of other strata, i.e. say, ordinary language and psychology; or else we end up with tame paraphrases of P-statements in other ordinary language P-statements. The first is the path taken by Merleau-Ponty. Thus he speaks of the body "understanding" a movement,' or of our "exis- tence", "constituting" the world. But this language can only be understood if it is not taken "literally", i.e. in the ordinary sense that the words have in their original language stratum. A language of this kind can be illuminating, and can give us many new insights, as Merleau-Ponty's does, but it cannot replace the languages of psychology or physiology. If no one of these latter is the "real" language, of which all others are but clumsy approximations, the former cannot claim this title either. The other path, is, perhaps, that taken by Professor Ryle, or rather of a possible interpretation of his thesis in the Concept of Mind.!2 For some of the paraphrases or explanation of P-statements I M. M.-P.-Phdnomdnologie de la Perception, e.g. p. i6i. 2 For another interpretation, see above, pp. I30 et seq. I40</page><page sequence="17">ONTOLOGY offered by Professor Ryle, are themselves couched in P-language. Thus, in the example quoted above,' "he boasted from vanity", the "law-like proposition" cited in the explanation was stated with the aid of such words as "admiration", "envy", "he thinks". Similarly, heeding what one is doing, is explained in such terms as "being in a mood or a frame of mind".2 It might be said that such terms are meant to be eliminated in favour of explicit M-language concepts, as is implied on several occasions.3 But if we reject this possibility, we are left with a series of paraphrases of P-statements in other P-statements. These are a kind of testimony to the limits of lan- guage, and as such are meant to show what we cannot say in the way of an explanation of P-statements. This discussion has been meant to show what we mean by the statement that ontological questions are "unanswerable". We might sum up the foregoing paragraphs in this way: no-one can say "Man is. . .'" in a philosophical tone of voice, and finish up with anything but a platitude or a bit of nonsense. But this is over simple. The nonsense in question is only nonsense from the standpoint of ordinary language or the languages of science. It is itself part of a language stratum of its own, which we can learn, as we have the others, and it may enable us to see and understand things about human beings that we wouldn't otherwise. But when we stand back for a moment, we can see the contingency of this language. There may be others which will teach us more. Our metaphysical craving for the real language remains unsatiated.
