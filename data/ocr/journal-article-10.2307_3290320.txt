This book is an important and stimulating contribution to the history of Greek philosophy. Caird's book began, apart from brief references to Heraclitus and Xenophanes, with Plato, "the first philosopher who distinctly grasped the idea that lies at the root of all religion." ' Professor Hack traces the conception of 1 Cf. Edward Caird, The Evolution of Theology in the Greek Philosophers: Glasgow, James Maclehose and Sons (1904), 58.

He follows Cornford in the view that Thales was no scientific rationalist but a legitimate heir to the myth-making propensities of the poets - a view that did not commend itself to Burnet. It is true that these philosophers were seeking for certainty, for something permanent, for a single principle that might be invoked to explain all phenomena. They also had a tendency to exalt any new insight into nature or mathematics or logic into a universal truth. Such truths some of them proclaimed with all the enthusiasm of prophets in possession of the one salvation for mankind. Heraclitus deposited his scriptures in the temple of Artemis to await an understanding reader; Pythagoras founded a sect to be the repository of his wisdom; Empedocles sought the plaudits of the multitude. Plato also was a salvationist; but with Aristotle begins the retreat of philosophy to the lecture room and the bedchamber. Hack has reason to deplore the "servitude to science" (p. 154) that he notes in present-day philosophy. When Plato succeeded in formulating in one system all the great problems of philosophy, he reduced thought very largely to a technique. Decadence followed as surely as it did the sculptural triumph of Phidias. The predecessors of Plato were pioneers, explorers rather than organizers, the producers of such sudden winds of doctrine as in our day we see in the fields of psychology and education. That is why they can be made so interesting in a study like this, which is full of meat and abounds in pithy statements that command assent, e.g. the following (p. 21): "Philosophers, like the frog in the fable, have invariably ruined their ideas when they have blown them up into a system." The author has shirked nothing in the baffling task of reconstructing the thought of these philos- ophers from the meager and uncertain fragments that we possess. In some cases he rejects current emendations of the texts. He</page><page sequence="3">BOOK RE VIEWS 623 often finds the explanation of apparently positive doctrines in the fact that they negate the views of rival philosophers. He perhaps goes too far in his insistence on the subordination of scientific curiosity to the demands of a unified system. The Ionians at least were men of affairs, and the map that Anaximander made seems to have no very obvious connection with his theology. In the absence of a scientific terminology philosophers had to use the words that they found at hand. If air or fire or the atom was given attributes of God, that was an inevitable feature of the attempt to expel divinity, which in any system tamen usque recur- ret. So in the post-Einstein system of the universe Jeans finds divinity in the mathematical regularity of events, while Edding- ton, completely disagreeing on this point, finds a place for God in the element of unpredictability in the behavior of electrons. Per- haps the gods that Hack finds in each Greek system are sometimes only his interpretation. He concludes with the moral that philosophers should submit to the discipline of the history of philosophy, which is much more rigorous than the discipline of the physical sciences. There is abundant evidence that the writer has himself submitted to this discipline, for his treatment is concise, definite, and independent. He has presented a unified exposition of early Greek philosophy that is an excellent guide among the diversity of elements through which knowledge of it must come. It is well to emphasize the unity, since the diversity is only too apparent. L. A. Post HAVERIORD COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
