Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion. xii + 290 pp., fron- tis., illus., bibl., index. New York/Oxford: Ox- ford University Press, 1993. $17.95 (paper). In the first chapter of Faces in the Clouds, Stew- art Guthrie distinguishes three types of human- istic theories of religion: religion as wish fulfill- ment, as social glue, and as a primitive science. The first two theories are inadequate, as religions may in fact fuel anxiety and social divisiveness. Hence, in Guthrie's view religion is not a matter of emotion, morality, or social function; rather, religions are to be understood as attempts to in- terpret the world. Guthrie, then, sees religion as a cognitive enterprise, like science and the ex- ercise of common sense, although more deeply dependent upon anthropomorphisms than these. The next five chapters are not about religion but about the tendency to "anthropomorphize"- to see faces in the clouds, for example, or pun- ishments in accidents, or purpose behind illness (p. viii). Animism and anthropomorphism, both of which "credit our environment with more or- ganization and more organisms than it has" (p. 39), are not accidental mistakes but effective strategies for dealing with uncertainty in percep- tion. They focus on that which-if correct-mat- ters most to the perceiver; for example, Guthrie examines at some length explanations that see comfort or familiarity as the source of anthro- pomorphism, but such alternatives are unsatis- factory. He discusses at some length too the arts and the history of the sciences (e.g., "attraction") and of philosophy. Although philosophers and scientists have repeatedly sought to expel an- thropomorphism (consider Bacon's criticisms of the idols of the tribe), it keeps cropping up in their writings. Religions anthropomorphize in at- tributing human characteristics to gods or to na- ture. Theologians have objected to this human habit because it threatens the transcendence at- tributed to God or may undermine belief in the objective existence of a god. Guthrie offers an interesting and energetically defended antidote to the common understanding of religion as, pri- marily, noncognitive. Anyone with an interest in the history of an- thropology, religious studies, or the philosophy of religion will, in particular, find this book worth reading. And as the history of science is also the history of the way science became a dis- tinct enterprise, well demarcated from religion and from other enterprises, the historian of sci- ence may also benefit from this book, especially from its discussion of the various ways in which religion is understood. By emphasizing percep- tion and cognition as common ground, Guthrie locates religion far closer to science than do many others who emphasize emotion or moral- ity. WILLEM B. DREES Mark Stoll. Protestantism, Capitalism, and Na- ture in America. xii + 276 pp., bibl. index. Al- buquerque: University of New Mexico Press, 1997. $40 (cloth); $19.96 (paper). In his essay "The Historical Roots of Our Eco- logic Crisis" (1967), Lynn White, jr., argued that Christian dogma was in large part responsible for the sorry ecological mess that we humans have made of the Western world. Christianity, unlike ancient paganism, for example, posited the man/ nature dualism, insisting that humans dominate and exploit the natural world for their own ends. The instrumental assumptions at the root of Christian theology, goes the argument, were used as the pretext for the rank exploitation of nature. In his new book Mark Stoll offers a rather different perspective on the role of religion in our conversation with nature. Evangelical Prot- estantism, he claims, played a key role in in- spiring capitalist domination of nature, to be sure. But it also emerged as a critical force in shaping the worldview and actions of those in- volved in efforts to conserve nature. "It is a cu- rious fact of American history," writes Stoll, "that the people who dominated the early, for- mative years of both capitalism and environ- mentalism grew up with the same cultural and religious values" (p. ix). Ultimately, he con- cludes, the pursuit of money and concern for ecology both have their roots in the Protestant tradition. Stoll provides a set of short biographies fo- cusing on the role of religion, nature, and capi- talism in the lives of such figures as Anne Brad- street, Cotton Mather, Benjamin Franklin, and Ralph Waldo Emerson, proceeding sequentially through time to the present and ending with James Watt and Dave Foreman (of Earth First!). His goal is to tease out for readers the strain of evangelical Protestantism that informed the 142</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 91: 1 (2000) ideas and behaviors of America's cultural elite and business leaders, to show that even such ruthless capitalists as Frederick Billings and John D. Rockefeller were driven to conserve the natural world because of an overriding belief in Christian theology. Reading this book is like taking a time ma- chine back to the days when intellectual history of the most traditional sort dominated the pro- fession. With the possible exception of Dave Foreman, who merits a mere two and one-half pages, virtually all the figures discussed in the book are people well known to historians. Many of the stories, whether of Franklin's kite exper- iments or the battle between John Muir and Gif- ford Pinchot over the Hetch Hetchy Valley, have been told many times before. In short, this book is a very conventional work that employs the rather tired methods of the old intellectual his- tory. That the Protestant background of the nation's most prominent intellectual, political, and busi- ness leaders influenced their views on both na- ture and capitalism is hardly surprising. Perhaps if Stoll had looked at some of the central figures in the environmental justice movement or eco- feminism and explored their religious views and attitudes toward nature he would have found a richer story to tell here. As it is, however, we are left in the end with such platitudes as "Capital- ism and environmentalism are in each other's grip, which sometimes tightens in contention or relaxes in embrace but never loosens" (p. 198). A less exclusively top-down approach, one shaped by greater theoretical rigor regarding the meaning of capitalism-Stoll is content to un- derstand it merely as "an entrepreneurial spirit" (p. x)-would have resulted in a far more inter- esting book. TED STEINBERG Mary Poovey. A History of the Modern Fact: Problems of Knowledge in the Sciences of Wealth and Society. xxvi + 420 pp., frontis., illus., bibl., index. Chicago: University of Chi- cago Press, 1998. $49, ?39.25 (cloth); $17, ?13.50 (paper). In this book Mary Poovey mines territory re- cently opened up by such historians of science as Lorraine Daston, Steven Shapin, and Ted Por- ter. Her central contentions are that sometime during the period spanning the late sixteenth to the early nineteenth century a new epistemic category, "the modem fact," came to replace the older Aristotelian fact as a preferred foundation for knowledge claims; that the central feature of the modem fact, which is usually but not always expressed in numerical terms, is that it is often viewed simultaneously as transparent and theory independent and as given meaning by virtue of its role in an inductive argument that functions to support or attack some theory; that its emer- gence can best be understood in terms of its use as a rhetorical strategy that empowered those relatively low in the traditional status hierarchy; that the production and control of modem facts is central to the development of notions of ex- pertise and professionalism; and that the rhetor- ical importance of the modem fact can be seen particularly well in connection with the British sciences of wealth and society. Along the way she constantly reminds us of the ongoing tension between those who argue that facts are more ap- propriately characterized as discovered and those who insist that they are constructed. There is little doubt in my mind that by the mid-nineteenth century many scientists and phi- losophers of science both in Britain and on the Continent were using and explicitly defending concepts that map very closely on to Poovey's "modem fact." The question is whether Poovey's story illuminates the emergence and increasing importance of this epistemic category in a compelling way. I think that it does so mag- nificently, although, as she willingly admits, there may be other equally compelling stories that could be told (I could imagine one focused on French medicine, terminating in Auguste Comte, for example, rather than one focused on British political economy, terminating with John Stuart Mill and John McCulloch). One particularly absorbing section is Poovey's examination of the rhetorical role of early double-entry bookkeeping in establishing an assurance (whether well founded or not) of honesty and expertise among merchants, a func- tion that carried over into public debates regard- ing trade and then into other domains of dis- course in the seventeenth century. I am bothered by the claims that Hume "abandoned experimen- tal philosophy" before 1757 (p. 170) and that he first confronted the problem of induction in his essay "Of the Standard of Taste." And I find it odd that Poovey insists on using the term "pro- topsychology" to characterize Scottish associa- tionism simply because its practitioners sought to understand human motivations primarily to develop a theory of government rather than to understand individual psychopathology, for when David Hartley coined the term "psychol- ogy" he was engaged in exactly the same moral philosophical enterprise.
