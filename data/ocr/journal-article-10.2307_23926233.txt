<plain_text><page sequence="1">Literature &amp; Theology, Vol. 14. No. 1, March 2000 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD Spyridoula Athanasopoulou-Kypriou Abstract In this study, taking exception to both the theological and atheistic interpretations of Samuel Beckett's work and focusing on his trilogy and his play Waiting for Godot, I first attempt to explore in what sense and to what extent he is an atheist and explain why he uses negative language when referring to a supposed divinity. In the second part, my intention is to dis cuss how the heroes' metaphysical quest functions in his works as well as to interpret the author's lyrical and mystical moments. Finally, my main argument is that Beckett wants to overcome any metaphysical quest. Speaking about Samuel Beckett and the problem of God is speaking about an ambiguity. For, on the one hand he uses Biblical and religious allusions, with which he is familiar, and on the other he reduces God, the divine, and religion in general to the level of the ludicrous.1 This double attitude towards his religious heritage has caused much confusion and debate among the critics who attempt to analyse his stance towards the problem of God and many opposed interpretations of his work have appeared. Thus, there are critics who stress Beckett's negative attitude towards religion and others who claim that Beckett has a positive attitude towards God. However, any effort to read Beckett's work as totally negative towards metaphysics or as anti-Christian is marked by (i) an over-reliance on Beckett's satiric tone towards religion; (2) a tendency to read one's own philosophical ideas into his works; (3) a tendency to criticize a piece of art from a religious perspective without recognizing the autonomy of art; (4) a failure to recognize that Beckett's intention may be to free people from any kind of metaphysical discourse, either theistic or atheistic; and (5) a failure to recognize the tender, lyrical and even mystical tone of some passages of his work. On the other hand, taking into consideration and overestimating the mystical and optimistic passages as well as the Biblical allusions that can be found in Beckett's work, some other critics argue for Beckett's positive attitude towards Christian belief and religion in general.3 Any attempt to read Beckett's works as Christianly orthodox or as having a totally positive attitude towards metaphysics is characterized by (1) an over-reliance on a prevalence of Christian imagery and © Oxford University Press 2000</page><page sequence="2">SPYRIDOULA ATHANASOPOULOU-KYPRIOU 35 symbolism; (2) the making of unfounded assumptions; and (3) a failure to recognize irony or, in some cases, a feeling of disgust. Given that, on the one hand, Beckett shows clearly his opposition to God and, on the other, there are some mystical and optimistic moments in his work, it is quite arbitrary to jump to the conclusion that he has either a totally positive or a completely negative attitude towards the divine. Thus, instead of considering Beckett's work as either positive or negative towards God, some other critics try to explain Beckett's double attitude towards the divine by assigning to him the active intention of coming up with a truer vision of deity.4 Any such attempt, theologically upbuilding though it may be, is marked by (1) a failure to recog nize that Beckett's main concern is with the human situation and not with the nature of theological understanding; (2) a tendency to interpret instances of blasphemy or irony as a healthy criticism of Christian religion from within; (3) an over-reliance on the negative language used; (4) a tendency to consider him a theologian who rejects any anthropomorphic God and argues for a more acceptable version of the divine; (5) a failure to see that the anthropo morphic God appears to be the only one referred to by the heroes and that there is no alternative offered in lieu of what is being satirized; and (6) a failure to realize that Beckett's intention may be to free people from any metaphysical quest. While those critics who argue either for Beckett's positive or negative attitude towards the problem of God fail to tie isolated facts together, the critics who suggest that Beckett wants to introduce a more acceptable vision of God are actually reading their own theological ideas into his works. Although the latter succeed in bringing contradictory facts together and offer an explana tion of Beckett's double attitude towards God, this explanation is biased in favour of their religious beliefs. Reading Beckett as a religious thinker who wants to introduce a more acceptable vision of the divine, does not do justice to his free spirit. For he does not seem interested in constructing a new totality, but rather in deconstructing all kinds of closed systems, all sorts of certainties. In this study, taking exception to the theological interpretations of his work and focusing on his trilogy and his play Waiting for Godot, I first attempt to explore in what sense and to what extent he is an atheist and explain why he uses negative language when referring to a supposed divinity. In the second part, my intention is to explain how the heroes' metaphysical quests function in Beckett's works as well as to interpret his lyrical and mystical moments. Finally, I suggest that Beckett wants to overcome any metaphysical quest. At this point it must be said that my reading of Beckett's work is only one among many possible others and is subject to the same problems of interpreta tion, especially the problem of reading my own ideas into his works. In this respect, my reading is only an attempt to draw attention to some problems dramatized by Beckett and can by no means be absorbed into a fully elaborated</page><page sequence="3">36 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD theory. Besides, let us not forget that for Beckett 'the key word' in his plays is 'perhaps'. 5 BECKETT AS AN ANTI-THEIST Trying to explore Beckett's atheism is tantamount to regarding him as an atheist.6 Yet, nowhere does he state that he disbelieves in God or that God does not exist.7 His mistrust of God is not ontological but epistemological. That is, he opposes the belief in God not because he is an avowed atheist but because he cannot know whether God exists or not.8 Besides, as we will see in the following, he is actually arguing against closed and dogmatic propositions, be they theistic, atheistic, philosophical or scientific. Therefore, it is preferable to speak of Beckett's anti-theism. By using the prefix 'anti' instead of 'a', my intention is to emphasize his criticism of, and antithesis to, belief in the exist ence of a single personal God, who is the creator of, and supreme authority, in the universe. Indeed, his opposition to the personal God of theism, who is at once active in the created world and separate from it, is so radical that he chooses very strong and often negative language to express it. In The Unnamable, he points out the danger of reducing the deity to the level of the human beings. As he puts it sarcastically: The rascal, he's getting humanised, he's going to lose if he doesn't watch out, if he doesn't take care, and with what could he take care, with what could he form the faintest conception of the condition they are decoying him into, ... (T, 363) Beckett refuses to see God as part of the cosmic reality, as a being among other beings who is knowable and is placed in a world, be it sensory or suprasensory. In The Unnamable he says clearly: The mistake they make of course is to speak of him as if he really existed, in a specific place, whereas the whole thing is no more than a project for the moment. But let them blunder on to the end of their folly, then they can go into the question again, taking care not to compromise themselves by the use of terms, if not of notions, accessible to the understanding. (T,375) A god, made in the image of people and according to their needs, is not a real god but only a projection of a weak and scared human intellect. The author points out that everything, including the concept of God, is human invention and says: '... I invented it all, in hope it would console me, help me to go on, allow me to think of myself as somewhere on a road,... All lies.' (T,316) Beckett's extensive use of negative language when speaking of the unknown makes some critics assume that he rejects natural theology and, like the negative theologians, argues for the otherness of God. For instance, Buning explores the</page><page sequence="4">SPYRIDOULA ATHANASOPOULOU-KYPRIOU 37 parallels between Beckett's works and the works of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite and Meister Eckhart and implies that there can be a significant relation between the 'haunting emphasis on nothing and notness in the trilogy' and the thirty-five negative attributes of God or Godhead, including the not namable, found in the Mystical Theology of Pseudo-Dionysius.9 However, trying to link Beckett's use of negative language with an active intention to argue for apophatic theology and its understanding of the divine, illuminating though as it may be, is arbitrary. For not every apophatic discourse can be considered theological. It is only if it argues, in one way or another, in favour of a transcendent deity that it can be characterized theological. In other words, theology, no matter how 'apophatic' it may be, seems to reserve a certain type of hyperessentiality, a being beyond Being. According to negative theology, God may be unknown, ineffable, beyond being, nameless, hidden, absent or even non-existent, in the sense that God does not exist as cosmic and finite beings do, but at the same time God is. Pseudo-Dionysius puts it this way: 'So this is what we say. The Cause of all is not inexistent, lifeless, speechless, mindless.'10 Therefore, when a theologian argues that God is beyond being, he/she does not deny God's beingness but she/he refuses to use cosmic predicates when referring to the divine. Negative theology has not come to negate God but only God's perceptible attributes. And by refusing to apply to God the terms of speech and thought, by arguing against God's being perceptible, conceptual and known, the theologians want to ascend from the perceptible to the intelligible and return to the transcendent God. Otherwise, if every apophatic discourse that resembles apophatic theology is speech of God, then God would be the truth of all negativity and therefore even of atheism. In Beckett's case, the writer may use negative language but his discourse is not theological. For, in his works, he never distinguishes between the available and personal God of theism and the completely distant and unknown God of apophatic theology. Although he criticizes and opposes the available God of theism, he does not argue in favour of another God, and does not preserve a certain type of hyperessentiality. In this respect, although Barge admits that 'in work after work, Beckett not only caricatures but has his heroes reject and curse the God concocted of human words and reflecting human evil', she points out correctly that 'the problem is that this anthropomorphic God appears to be the only one referred to by the heroes or the narrators throughout .1 &gt; 11 the canon . Yet, if Beckett does not argue either for a new understanding of the divine or for the apophatic theology and its negative language, then why is he using apophatic language to speak of the unknown? In my judgment, he uses nega tive language in so far as he wants to show the ineffectiveness of predicative language when referring to the unknown. Although negative language is a language and thus positive, it is the only way to show the weaknesses of</page><page sequence="5">38 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD language when speaking positively of an ineffable deity. In other words, he is using negative language only as a vehicle to criticize or even satirize theism in so far as theism speaks positively of God's attributes and tries to prove God's existence. For example, in The Unnamahle, he seems to argue against God's names and attributes when he refuses to name the unknown and unnamable. As he says: ... it's the fault of the pronouns, there is no name for me, no pronoun for me, all the trouble comes from that, that, it's a pronoun too, it isn't that either, I'm not that either, ... (T,4o8) Similarly, by using negative language, he attacks the ontological argument for God's existence. While, in terms of this argument, God, as the greater than can be conceived, must be thought of as existing, for Beckett existence does not necessarily depend on conceivability. Beckett puts it this way: Feeling nothing, knowing nothing, he exists nevertheless, but not for himself, for others, others conceive him and say, Worm is, since we conceive him, as if there could be no being but being conceived, if only by the beer. (T,349) Consequendy, arguments that seem to derive from the discourse of apophatic theology become the means by which Beckett shows the inconsistencies of theistic belief. Nevertheless, using negative language and arguments that have similarities with those of apophatic theology is only one way of expressing his anti-theistic feelings. For satire, parody, and radical irony are also used in order to suggest that any theistic belief is untrustworthy. In Waiting for Godot, in his bitter monologue, Lucky refers to God's controversial and incompatible attributes and says ironically: Given the existence ... of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard quaquaquaqua outside time without extension Who from the heights of divine apathia divine athambia divine aphasia loves us dearly with some exceptions for reasons unknown ... (WG,42) Beckett chooses also the supreme sacrament of the Christian faith, the Eucharist, to ridicule it. In Molloy, Moran is very much concerned with the effectiveness of the Eucharist if taken on top of beer, however light. (7',97) In the follow ing pages of the novel, Beckett's parody of the Eucharist is even more radical, especially when his hero takes the sacred feast but realizes no benefit from doing so. As his hero confesses: The host, it is only fair to say, was lying heavy on my stomach. And as I made my way home I felt like one who, having swallowed a pain-killer, is first astonished, then indignant, on obtaining no relief. (T, 102)</page><page sequence="6">SPYRIDOULA ATHANASOPOULOU-KYPRIOU 39 By comparing the host with a pain-killer, Beckett implies that religion is people's last resort. Tired of a painful life, people find in religion a kind of consolation. Having tried everything, or at least that is what they think, they pray to God for help and salvation. People's piety grows 'warm in times of crisis'. (T,2io) Nonetheless, although there is, undoubtedly, an abiding criticism and satire of theism as well as of Christianity, Beckett is not an avowed anti-Christian who tries to relieve himself of his anti-Christian feelings in his works. If he uses the Bible and the Christian imagery to ridicule religion, he does so because he is perfectly familiar with Christianity and therefore he can use effective examples taken from this tradition to criticize theism in general. Besides, he opposes not only theism and religion but also all those philosophies, be they sacred or secular, that start from the idea that human thought can reduce the totality of the universe to a complete, unified and coherent system. While religion, with its theistic world-view, is one way of answering human questions and of putting things in an order, science and philosophy are other ways of giving meaning to an absurd life. In so far as science and philosophy introduce a closed and coherent system and argue for eternal truths, they do not differ from religion and thus provoke Beckett's satire. In other words, he ridicules and opposes any culturally established authority, be it religious or secular, that tries to interpret the universal chaos and the human tragic condition. According to Theodor Adorno, Beckett's work is 'a parody of the philosophy' as well as 'a parody of forms'. What Beckett refuses to deal with is interpretation.13 Besides, Beckett himself points out that the supposed direct relation between the human mind and reality has broken. As he puts it: The crisis started with the end of the seventeenth century, after Galileo. The eighteenth century has been called the century of reason, le siècle de la raison. I've never understood that; they're all mad, ils sont tous fous, ils déraisonnent! They give reason a responsibility which it simply can't bear, it's too weak. The Encyclopedists wanted to know everything ... But that direct relation between the self and — as the Italians say - lo scibile, the knowable, was already broken.14 Taking into account his general mistrust of the traditional understanding of reason, when I argue for Beckett's anti-theism, I regard it as part of his general opposition to any closed philosophical or scientific system that searches for or claims that it has already found the eternal truths. In Waiting for Godot both protagonists are suspicious of any complete and coherent system, be it secular or religious, for as they say 'nothing is certain'. (IT'G, 14,53) In this respect, Beckett is as much of an anti-theist as of an anti-philosopher whose oeuvre is a transmutation of his unconventional and liberating ideas into art.15 Following his general opposition to secular and religious metaphysical systems, that argue for universal principles and order, Beckett presents a picture</page><page sequence="7">40 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD of a disintegrating world that has lost its certainties, traditional values and revelations of divine purpose. When it is no longer possible to accept a divine horizon or a metaphysical point of reference, life must be faced in its ultimate, stark reality, in the reality of nothingness. In his works, the writer dramatizes the Democritian proposition that 'nothing is more real than nothing' and presents the human tragic condition. Yet, his heroes are not tragic. For the tragic hero, although he/she suffers and loses his/her struggle against the absolute, his/her downfall is a confirmation and recognition of the absolute. Beckett's heroes are rather grotesque. The grotesque figure, although he/she loses the struggle against the absolute, her/his downfall means mockery of the absolute and its desecration. In the world of grotesque, mockery is directed not only at the tormentor, but also at the victim, who believed in the tormentor's justice, raising him/her to the level of the absolute. While in 'tragedy' the absolute remains authoritative and justified, for 'tragedy' is always followed by catharsis, in the realm of the grotesque, the absolute cannot be justified or be blamed, for it is a trap set by people themselves into which they have fallen. In terms of Beckett, human tragic condition can be understood as the lack of tragedy. For, in his works, human pain is purposeless since there is no absolute, no god(s) to justify it, like in the ancient Greek tragedies or in the Biblical stories. Therefore, in a godless world, the tragedy of human existence consists of the awareness that life will always be a farce and never a meaningful tragedy where suffering can be redeemed by an absolute force. Indeed, Beckett's world is the world of the farce and the grotesque where there is no harmony, no order and nothing on people's horizon. In Endgame, Clov realizes the modern metaphysical emptiness and asks a rhetorical question: 'What in God's name would there be on the horizon?' (E,26) Nothing. All Beckett sees on the horizon is nothing. The writer is like the mad friend of Hamm who was shown all the world's illusory loveliness but he could only see the world's ashes. (E, 32) Finally, in a meaningless world people 'stink' no matter how hard they try to keep themselves 'clean'. As Beckett says in Premier Amour: 'Ils ont beau se laver, les vivants, beau se parfumer, ils puent.' (PA,g) Beckett's heroes seem to be haunted by the consciousness that their life is tied up with death. As the nar rator admits, in Malone Dies: 'I am being given, if I may venture the expression, birth to into death, such is my impression.' (T,285) For the Irish writer, in life, 'the end is in the beginning', (£,44) in other words, a coffin is laying next to every cradle. Yet if there are no god(s), no absolute to give meaning to this moment between the cradle and the grave, people will have to live in despair. Thus, the problem to be discussed is what Beckett suggests that people should do in order to face successfully their metaphysical emptiness and their tragic condition.</page><page sequence="8">SPYRIDOULA ATHANASOPOULOU-KYPRIOU 41 BECKETT BEYOND ANY METAPHYSICAL QUEST In work after work Beckett dramatizes people's metaphysical emptiness after the concepts of God and the transcendent have lost their effectiveness. Wherever his heroes look they face nothingness. However, living in a meaningless world where the concept of God has proven untrustworthy, does not mean that human beings do not need a point of reference, that is, someone or something to believe in, and something that can provide them with valid principles. Universal chaos needs to be explained. People seek answers. In Endgame, Hamm says: 'Ah the creatures, the creatures, everything has to be explained to them.' (jE,32) Human curiosity rests behind the scientific and philosophical theories. And where these theories cannot be applied there is always the concept of the divine revela tion that can offer explanations. People need to construct totalities and invent the concept of God. It is human, all too human. As the narrator puts in The Unnamahle : 'So they build up hypotheses that collapse on top of one another, it's human, a lobster couldn't do it.' (T,375) In Beckett's works, people seem to be like 'strangers' in an absurd world and seek their lost 'homeland', the place or rather the situation where everything is familiar to them and where certainties give meaning to their life. As he puts it in Mahne Dies: Yes, there is no good pretending, it is hard to leave everything. The horror-worn eyes linger abject on all they have beseeched so long,... (T278) Aware of people's metaphysical emptiness, Beckett adopts a nostalgic tone to speak of their lost 'homeland' and their illusion that someone or something will come to save them. This illusion is presented as the eternal feature of the human imagination to assimilate the unutterable dimensions of life. In his works, the protagonists either take refuge in the traditional values and concepts of the transcendent or try to construct new totalities, new points of reference. In this respect, the critics who argue for Beckett's totally negative attitude towards the concept of God and metaphysics in general overlook his interest in people's hope for 'salvation' and fail to explain why his heroes search for a horizon. For instance, in Mahne Dies we read a lyrical and mystical passage. The narrator seeks the person—and if we use allegory this person can be interpreted as the 'old God'—who used to protect him and says tenderly: What I sought when I struggled out of my hole, then aloft through the stinging air towards an inaccessible boon, was the rapture of vertigo, the letting go, the fall, the gulf, the relapse to darkness, to nothingness, to earnestness, to home, to him waiting for me always, who needed me and whom I needed, who took me in his arms and told me to stay with him always, who gave me his place and watched over me, who suffered every time I left him, whom I have often made suffer and seldom contented, whom I have never seen. (T, 195)</page><page sequence="9">42 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD Similarly, in the French version of the play Waiting for Godot, Vladimir speaks of Godot's arrival and says optimistically17: Ce soir on couchera peut-être chez lui, au chaud, au sec, le ventre plein, sur la paille. Ça vaut la peine qu'on attende. Non? (EAG,25) These optimistic or even mystical passages, far from being evidence for Beckett's positive attitude towards the transcendent, show people's constant search for some meaning in a godless and purposeless universe. When Beckett adopts a lyrical tone to speak of the unknown, he does so not because he wants to justify any belief in it, as Baldwin implies in her book,18 but because he knows that people still need the ineffable to be their horizon. Beckett is quite sensitive to people's insecurity and realizes that they want something to depend on, though, as we will see, he does not justify this attitude. That is why even when he does not refer to any traditional concept of the divine or any 'old God', he presents his heroes as seeking an absolute or a saviour to be their new point of orientation. In his works, there is always someone or something missing, someone or something wanting. In Watt it is Mr Knott, in Molloy Youdi, in The Unnamahle Worm, in Waiting for Godot Godot, and right from the beginning of Endgame a light becomes the point of the heroes' orientation. At this point, the problem to be discussed is why Beckett is haunted by this metaphysical quest. Is it because he argues for the traditional understanding of metaphysics that he dramatizes people's metaphysical hope, as the critics who stress Beckett's positive attitude towards metaphysics claim? Or is it rather because he wants to come up with a truer vision of the divine that, on the one hand, he criticizes theism and, on the other, he transmutes people's metaphysical quest into art? Different though these propositions may seem, they argue for one and the same thing, that is, for the fact that Beckett justifies people's meta physical quest and therefore is haunted by it. Based on his interest in people's existential anxiety and metaphysical quest, critics like Baldwin, Butler and Terrien read Beckett as a metaphysician who tries to construct a new vision of religion, God and metaphysics in general. In terms of their interpretations, the Irish writer stands in the realm of metaphysics, for he has not abandoned the concept of the transcendent and is still waiting for the unknown to reveal itself. Nevertheless, if we read his works from a different perspective, we may realize that Beckett is haunted by metaphysics because people are haunted by it. The optimistic, tender and mystical passages which can be found in his works may be understood as part of his presentation of people's desperate search for a point of reference. Beckett dramatizes people's metaphysical quest in so far as this dramatization serves his method of challenging metaphysics. That is to say, that he presents people's metaphysical quest in such a way that the reader or the audience can recognize the vanity of metaphysical hope.</page><page sequence="10">SPYRIDOULA ATHANASOPOULOU-KYPRIOU 43 One comes across this method in revisiting Waiting for Godot, the play that emphasizes the human tragic condition as well as people's waiting for something or someone to 'save' them. For, on the one hand, the play speaks of and stresses people's hope for 'salvation' and, on the other, it seems to deconstruct it by satirizing it and by showing the absurdity of waiting for an external force to help. Instead of arguing for metaphysics, the play's intention is to go beyond any hope and free people from any metaphysical quest, be it secular or religious. Before I go any further with the interpretation of the function of people's metaphysical quest in the play, I should first analyse the title Waiting for Godot—French title En Attendant Godot—which is very revealing. The title consists of two parts, namely, of a present participle and its object. Waiting—in French En Attendant—is the participle and Godot its object. Although the participle seems to be inclusive, in the sense that its subject is not defined and thus anyone can be its subject, later on in the play, Beckett refers to the subject of waiting. Yet, although in the English version of the play he uses the personal pronoun 'we' to define who is waiting for Godot, in the French version the writer chooses the impersonal 'on to speak of the subject of waiting. In this French impersonal form, expectation is thrust upon actor and audience alike. However, even when the personal pronoun 'we' is used, it is not clear if it includes the readers and the audience or if it simply refers to the heroes of the play. This ambiguity of the subject of waiting may imply and speak of human expectations in general and not only of the heroes' act of waiting. Similarly, the object of waiting is very unclear. Although a name, that is, Godot is used as the object of people's expectations, we do not know who Godot is. For in his play, the writer does not give a clue as to who or what Godot is.20 Despite the attempts that have been made to define Godot's identity, the only thing we know for sure about him/her/it is what Vladimir and Estragon think of him/her/it and what the messengers of Godot tell us about him/her/ it.21 But why trust Godot's messengers? How do we know that the boys are telling the truth? And even more, why depend on Vladimir's and Estragon's conception of Godot? What if the heroes are deceived by their own expectations and needs and thus invent the idea of Godot? What if Godot is a human construction that exists only in the constructor's mind? If we take into account how unfounded the information about Godot is, we realize that we know nothing about Godot except for how he/she/it functions in the play. In fact it is Godot's role in the play that gives evidence of Beckett's criticism and rejection of any metaphysical quest and hope. Indeed, the figure of Godot is used as that which keeps people in existence and offers the purpose of life. As Estragon reveals: 'We always find something, eh, Didi, to give us the impression that we exist?' (WG,69) Godot is the ineffable and unknowable 'that represents hope in an age when there is no hope'.22 Yet Godot is not only unknowable and absent but he/she/it may not even exist, for Godot is</page><page sequence="11">44 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD whatever people want him/her/it to be as long as Godot justifies their life as waiting. In Beckett's works, people are afraid of accepting their metaphysical emptiness and of going on with their life. As the narrator admits in The Unnamahle: Unfortunately I am afraid, as always, of going on. For to go on means going from here, means finding me, losing me, vanishing and beginning again,... (7,304) Therefore, people are still waiting for some help to be offered by an external force. If there is nothing out there they create the goal for which the waiting then seems to be justifiable. Anders characterizes the behaviour of Vladimir and Estragon by saying that their guiding principle seems to be: 'We are wait ing, therefore there must be something we are waiting for.'23 In other words, it is because people cannot move on that they create the concept of Godot so as to have something to wait for. Yet if people's behaviour generates its own goal then it is a classical case of petitio principii and, as Rolf Breuer says, in this case 'the solution is the problem'.24 In terms of Beckett, since people wait for that which they hope for, that which they hope for never appears in the play, for it is only the projection of the human needs. Moreover, the writer suggests that Godot will never come by emphasizing that Godot has not appeared in the two acts of the play. As Worton points out, Beckett, who is fascinated by mathematics, knows that in mathem atical theory the passage from o to 1 marks a major and real change of state, and that the passage from 1 to 2 implies the possibility of infinity. In this respect two acts are enough to suggest that since Godot has not arrived in these two acts, he/she/it may never come. Furthermore, although the title of the play refers to the act of waiting, the play argues for the act of going on. For, as I have already argued, Beckett's method is to present what he wants to challenge and then deconstruct it by showing its weaknesses and its futility. Indeed, in Waiting for Godot, the two tramps are waiting. In the meantime, nothing good happens. The protagonists cannot find anything to eat, their relationship does not develop, their metaphysical empti ness does not disappear and nobody seems to come to their help. As Estragon says: 'Nothing happens, nobody comes, nobody goes, it's awful!' (WG,41) While waiting for something, people fail to achieve their subjectivity and explore their ego. In The Unnamable the narrator speaks of the time he spent searching for something and says: When I think, that is to say, no, let it stand, when I think of the time I've wasted with these bran-dips, beginning with Murphy, who wasn't even the first, when I had me, on the premises, within easy reach, ... (T,394)</page><page sequence="12">SPYRIDOULA ATHANASOPOULOU-KYPRIOU 45 Similarly, while waiting, people loose their moral consciousness. Absorbed by the act of waiting they forget their responsibilities for the rest of humankind. As Hamm puts it in Endgame: ... All those I might have helped. (Pause.) Helped! (Pause.) Saved. (Pause.) Saved! (Pause.) The place was crawling with them!... Get out of here and love one another! Lick your neighbour as yourself! (£,44) People wait. In the meantime, they are trapped by their hope for salvation and they cannot change their situation. In Waiting for Godot, Estragon admits that 'they all change. Only we can't.' (WG,48) Waiting for a 'saviour' to arrive prevents people from taking the responsibility of moving on and of overcoming their tragic situation. That is why, in Molloy, the narrator considers hope to be 'hellish'. (T,i34) Hope is hellish in so far as it is a pretext for not facing the reality and for putting off the time that people must decide for themselves. If people admit the folly of their hope, they will find themselves in hell. For they would then have to be more serious about their situation and their behaviour. Hope that is expressed by waiting is a very convenient habit. 'But habit is a great deadener.' (WG,91) In Beckett's works, there are many allusions to an escape from the hellish hope. In Waiting for Godot, both acts end with the heroes' unsuccessful effort to move on. In the first act it is Estragon who takes the initiative and asks: Estragon: Well? Shall we go? Vladimir: Yes, let's go. ( IPG,94) In the second act it is Vladimir who suggests that they should go and receives the same positive response. However, in both cases the heroes do not move. Analogously, in Endgame Hamm suggests that they should go from there. But Clov reminds him that 'God forbid!' (E,28) Thus, although people have started realizing the vanity of any metaphysical quest and hope, and try to escape from them, the powerful routine of waiting and the traditional metaphysical systems plunge them back into the passivity of illusion and keep them from 'reaching the painful but fruitful awareness of the full reality of being'. Given his negative presentation of the consequences of people's waiting and the allusions to an escape from the routine of expecting, Beckett argues for people's responsible decision to leave behind all certainties and move on with their life without clinging to any metaphysical hope. Unlike Combs who implies that Beckett opposes people's impulse to go on and that in Waiting for Godot the writer justifies people's waiting for something or someone to come and save them,27 I suggest that Beckett is deeply concerned with and emphasizes</page><page sequence="13">46 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD people's potentiality for going on. While in his plays there are only allusions of his concern with moving on, in The Unnamahle Beckett is very clear when he says: '...you must go on, that's all I know ...' (T,4i8) Although it is difficult to abandon the traditional metaphysical systems and live without a point of reference, the recognition of the illusoriness and absurdity of ready-made solutions and prefabricated meanings, far from ending in despair, is the starting point of a new kind of consciousness, which faces the mystery and terror of the human condition in the exhilaration of a new-founded freedom.28 In the final sentence of The Unnamahle the narrator realizes the difficulty of going on but is determined to continue his fife. Thus he says: ... it will be the silence, where I am, I don't know, I'll never know, in the silence you don't know, you must go on, I can't go on, I'll go on. (T,4i8) In terms of Beckett, people cannot know if there are universal principles or a suprasensory world and a transcendent deity. Thus, he suggests that if nothing is certain it is futile to search for metaphysical truths or wait for a saviour to help us or even construct totalities to explain the universal chaos. The universe is absurd. Nothing can change its absurdity. People must accept it and move on in silence. As Hamm says at the end of Endgame: Since that's the way we're playing it... (he unfolds handkerchief) ... let's play it that way ... (he unfolds)... and speak no more about it... (hefinishes unfolding)... speak no more. (E, 52) Searching for rules and coherent principles in an absurd universe where there may be no closed systems and no metaphysical truth, is not the sign of a superior peace of mind but rather an indication of people's resignation and weakness. According to Beckett, it is by realizing that any metaphysical quest is doomed to failure that peace of mind enters in the human soul. As the narrator puts it in Molloy. For to know nothing is nothing, not to want to know anything likewise, but to be beyond knowing anything, to know you are beyond knowing anything, that is when peace enters in, to the soul of the incurious seeker. (T,64) To sum up, in terms of the Irish writer, the dignity of human beings lies in their ability to face reality in all its senselessness, to accept it freely, without fear, without clinging to illusions, without waiting for anything, to laugh at it and go on. As the narrator says in The Unnamable: the essential is never to arrive anywhere, never to be anywhere, neither where Mahood is nor where Worm is, nor where I am, it little matten thanks to what</page><page sequence="14">SPYRIDOULA ATHANASOPOULOU-KYPRIOU 47 dispensation. The essential is to go on squirming forever at the end of the line, as long as there are waters and banks and ravening in heaven a sporting God to plague his creature, per pro his chosen shits. (T,34i) CONCLUSION In the opening line of my paper I suggested that speaking about Samuel Beckett and the problem of God is speaking about an ambiguity. Yet what we con sider to be an ambiguity does not necessarily mean that it is one. For Beckett's double stance towards God and metaphysics in general can be reconsidered and reinterpreted in such a way that his attitude will no longer be regarded as double. Indeed, Beckett's intention seems to be only one, that is, to free people from any metaphysical hope and quest, be they secular or religious. His method of liberating people from metaphysics or, rather, of suggesting that they should abandon any metaphysical hope and quest is twofold. That is, on the one hand, he opposes and criticizes theism and traditional metaphysics by satirizing and ridiculing them, and, on the other, he deconstructs any future hope and quest by presenting them in such a way that they are proven not only untrustworthy and ineffective but also dangerous for human dignity and freedom. At the end of the 19th century, Nietzsche spoke of the ineffectiveness and untrustworthiness of traditional metaphysics and argued against the concept of God and its substitutes. In the 20th century, Beckett renders what Nietzsche says in The Gay Science into art. That is to say, that the Irish writer argues not only against God and the traditional metaphysics, but also against anything that might replace the 'dead God' or the 'dead metaphysics'. In a Nietzschean context, Beckett fights the 'tremendous' shadow of God that is still haunting people's life. That is probably why, in Waiting for Godot, Beckett chooses the name Godot and not the word God to speak of and challenge what people wait for. In his play, Godot stands as the 'shadow of God', for Godot is a weakened form of God and can thus refer to both the divine and to whatever might substitute the traditional concept of God. Admittedly, one could argue that I stress Beckett's negative attitude towards God. This is true to the extent that I emphasize Beckett's opposition to every metaphysical system, be it theistic or secular. Nevertheless, his mistrust of God and metaphysics is not ontological but epistemological. That is to say, that he is not an avowed atheist or nihilist, but rather an agnostic who suggests that people cannot know whether life has a meaning or not and whether God exists or not. Unlike the critics who argue for either Beckett's positive or negative attitude towards metaphysics, I suggest that he wants, in fact, to overcome this dilemma. In his works, he neither rejects nor justifies metaphysics. Similarly, he neither</page><page sequence="15">48 SAMUEL BECKETT BEYOND THE PROBLEM OF GOD denies nor accepts the existence of God, for the problem of God's existence simply exceeds the limits of human knowledge. In this respect, Beckett is not really interested in discussing the credibility of the concept of God and of metaphysics, and therefore his active intention is not to come up with a truer vision of the divine or a better understanding of metaphysics. His abiding concern is rather with people's metaphysical anguish and emptiness after God and traditional metaphysics have lost their effectiveness. In work after work, he dramatizes the human tragic condition after people have lost their metaphysical horizon and suggests that no matter how hard they seek eternal truths and values, their efforts are doomed to failure for the problem rests in the nature of their quest. In other words, in so far as people are searching for truths and are waiting for an external force to help them, they do not face up to anxiety and despair and therefore anxiety, metaphysical emptiness and despair cannot be overcome. It is thus only by going beyond metaphysical quest, by challenging all certainties and traditional values, by accepting reality in all its absurdity, and by moving on with their lives, that people can allow peace, dignity and freedom to enter in their souls. For Beckett, it is by believing in nothing and by waiting for nothing that people can sputter out 'a last prayer, the true prayer at last, the one that asks for nothing'. (T,278) Yet, if nothing is certain, if people should accept their life in all its absurdity without hoping for anything and without believing in anything, how can they move on? If human life is meaningless or if people do not know whether life has a purpose or not, is it by going on with their life or is it rather by dying that peace, dignity and freedom enters in people's souls? What is this then that may make people want to live? What made Beckett write his works? Beckett's work is characterized by a contradiction. On the one hand, he does not reserve any kind of hyperessentiality or a being beyond Being and tries to overcome metaphysical quest and, on the other, his entire oeuvre is a recognition of the significance of a horizon in human life. However, in terms of Beckett, this horizon does not seem to be transcendent, but rather reduced to the level of moral consciousness and responsibility towards humanity. It is his concern with ethics—which I only imply in this paper—that opens up new horizons for the theological interpretations of his work. For what could be of more significance for theology than Hamm's proposition in Endgame which invites us to get out of here, love one another and lick our neighbour as ourselves.

Jacqueline Hoefer, 'Watt' in Martin Esslin (ed.), A Collection of Critical Essays, pp. 62-76. And more recently Sylvie Debevec Henning views Murphy as an instance of a 'carnivalesque irony' and claims that the novel 'does not so much embody a specific philosophy as satirize what is perhaps the dominant strain of the Western tradition: a general faith in the reality, or possibility, of ultimate identity or totality'. Quoted in Murphy, 'Beckett and the philosophers', p. 225. Theodor Adomo, 'Trying to understand Endgame', tr. Michael T. Jones, New German Critique 26 (1982), pp. 121 —122. Quoted in Murphy, 'Beckett and the philosophen', p. 233. By suggesting that Beckett is an anti philosopher, 1 do not mean that he cannot be influenced by philosophy but that he opposes the closed philosophical systems. Besides, any attempt to reject the traditional philosophy is a different philosophical stance and is thus standing in the light of philosophy. ' Jan Kott, Shakespeare our Contemporary, trans.

Farrell Lee says, also, referring to the grotesque: 'The grotesque embodies quite a different reality, not the empirical reality of order and logic, but the reality of chaos and irrationality.' G.

In the English translation of the play— done by Beckett himself—the writer omits this passage. Baldwin, Samuel Beckett's Real Silence. Lance St John Butler in his book Samuel Beckett and the Meaning of Being: A Study in Ontological Parable (London: Macmillan Press, 1984), pp. 196-197, 188 says that 'Beckett is trying to go beyond the normal Christianity, beyond a world-view based on belief and beyond mere "metaphysics"' so that 'there is always left open the possibility of some profounder view of religion'. Progressively Beckett 'takes his eyes off the world and tries to confront the Absolute'. Baldwin asserts that 'if one goes through these works with the fine-toothed comb of pedantry, one sees that the object of satire is never the transcendent nor the mystical intuition of the transcendent'. Baldwin, 'The theme of the pilgrim,' p. 220. Additionally, Terrien claims that 'Beckett wams the people of the Book, bothjews and Christians, against the graven images and the molten gods of presump tion, superiority, and possessiveness. By indirection, Waiting for Godot defines at once the insecurity of existing and the certitude of living in faith.' Terrien, 'A theological look at Waitingfor Godot', p. 153. When Alan Schneider asked Beckett who or what was meant by Godot, he received the answer: 'If I knew, I would have said so in the play.' Quoted in Esslin, p. 44. See Melvin J.
