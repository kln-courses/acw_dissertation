<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEWS AND VIEWS Proceedings of the 1998 International Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter Barbara Fields Bernstein and Brian Muldoon The 1998 International Buddhist-Christian Theological Encounter, the continua- tion of the Cobb-Abe group, met in Indianapolis, Indiana, from May 1 to 3, 1998. Following the reading of a statement from Prof. Masao Abe in which he stated his regret at not being able to attend this important gathering and his hope that the encounter would begin to address the global crises facing humankind today, John Cobb provided a brief history of the encounter for the new participants. FIRST PAPER: BUDDHISM AND ECOLOGICAL ETHICS, BY CHATSUMARN KABILSINGH Prof. Kabilsingh began the morning discussion by focusing on the Buddhist doc- trine of dependent origination, which reveals the interconnectedness of all life, as the starting place for fashioning a response to the environmental crisis. Suggesting that the inner and outer worlds are necessarily related ("As the king is, so are the sun and the moon"), she recommended adopting certain monastic practices to create a more harmonious relationship with nature. This provoked a discussion about the need for concrete action in addressing the behaviors not so much of individuals as of institu- tions. Institutions are uniquely human, embodying human imperfection even as they shape who we are. Noting that both traditions tended to focus on individual awakening or redemption, the question was asked how the principles of individual enlightenment or salvation could be applied to a community or institution. Further, there needs to be some practical balance between the two traditions' extreme views of civilization, one of which places it in the heart of the forest (the East) and the other that finds it in the marbled city (the West). This balance, which must restore the tree of life to the heart of the city, will require a new model of institutions as liv- ing organisms rather than lifeless monoliths or random encounters. The balance of the morning's discussion addressed the relationship between community and insti- tutions and the "eschatological hope" of both Christianity and Buddhism. Chatsumarn concluded the session by highlighting the principle of interrelationship as the common ground between Christianity and Buddhism.

The observation that ethics must be based on empirical data led to an explo- ration of the relationship of the relative (concrete reality that can be described) and the absolute (that which cannot be described, but may or may not be expressed through that which is particular) levels of truth. Interdependence, in the Buddhist model, includes an appreciation of the particularity of each thing while also recog- nizing the sameness of all. Speakers agreed that we must think both relatively and absolutely (although a new way of applying language to these concepts is needed). Meaningful environmental ethics must be grounded in the sacramental, in scien- tific particularity as perceived through the heart of the aesthete in intimate rela- tionship with the natural world. But how could we move from these theoretical reflections into a closer encounter with that world? Stephanie Kaza would provide the needed vehicle in her comprehensive overview of the environmental crisis in the next session. THIRD PAPER: OVERCOMING THE GRIP OF CONSUMERISM, BY STEPHANIE KAZA It is fair to say that Kaza's paper catalyzed provocative directions for thought during the three-day encounter, both because it provided the factual data from which an ethical discussion might proceed and because it focused the conversation on the role of consumerism in the environmental crisis. Prof. Kaza provided a telling compari- son of consumerism and liberation practice as paths to self-realization and fulfill- ment, showing how the twelve links of dependent origination are integral to both paths. Breaking the grip of consumerism requires breaking any one of these links, like an addiction. This generated a spirited discussion about the relationship between enlightenment-whether "sudden" or otherwise-and consumerism and the rela- tionship between consumerism and the more fundamental human tendency toward the acceptance of suffering over practices that promote liberation. While education was obviously critical for a solution, there was agreement that the problem is much larger than any individual. The global economy creates the conditions of consum- erism and must be met with a global response. Though daunting, we were reminded of powerful movements such as civil rights, feminism, and the current campaign against tobacco as examples of success at this level. FOURTH PAPER: "ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL GOD," BY GORDON KAUFMAN As if in response to Stephanie Kazas invitation to theologians to step into the twelve- linked environmental fray, Gordon Kaufman's paper provided a direct critique of 194</page><page sequence="3">NEWS AND VIEWS Christian anthropomorphism and its tendency to exalt humanity above the rest of creation and thereby justify its harmful exploitation of nature. Kaufman's recon- structed God as "serendipitous creativity" and his "bio-historical humanity" were then explored as a way to keep mankind within nature and in relation to a divine "otherness" susceptible to the essential "I-Thou" relationship. It was observed that this might be a way to reconcile the traditional rift between theology and technol- ogy, supporting a vision of a living universe in place of earlier mechanistic models. Both this notion of historicity and the Buddhist notion of the eternal return were seen by some as opportunities to act in the present moment, to achieve the conver- sion needed to alleviate the crisis, although this crisis emerged over time and not simply in the moment. FURTHER RESPONSE: TO KABILSINGH, BUDDHISM AND ECOLOGICAL ETHICS Searching for common ethical ground between Buddhism and Christianity, this ses- sion began with Rosemary Radford Ruether's exploration of the mind-body split and ways to heal it through the insights of ecofeminist theologian Ivone Gebara's "dialectic of interrelationality." This was followed by a discussion of the nature of nature. Buddhism regards nature as positive, both as a stimulus to enlightenment in some traditions and as an expression of suchness, while the Judeo-Christian notion of the original paradise has internal contradictions. Both traditions share a "green monasticism" ethic that includes "living naturally," embodied in Buddhist principles of sila and reflected in St. Francis' "Canticle of Brother Sun." But, it was observed, the crisis was not created by monks-it was created by businesses, who must bear responsibility for resolving it. FURTHER RESPONSE: TO MCFAGUE, "SELF AND NATURE IN CHRISTIANITY (AND BUDDHISM)" Sung-Bae Parks response to Sallie McFague stimulated an energized debate about the relationship between enlightenment and action and between the absolute realm of "mom" (where everything is just fine) and the relative "mom-chit" world (where people are dying of starvation). Park crisply observed that enlightenment is the essential requirement for facing the environmental crisis effectively. But, it was asked, is personal enlightenment enough? Where does the prophetic dimension come from? One cannot appreciate the needs of the suffering world without a "transformed awareness" that moves us beyond ordinary self-centered love into love of one's neighbor. Sulak Sivaraksa criticized the Buddhist world for focusing too much on personal transformation and providing too little in the way of a detailed strategy for resisting structural violence. The old traditions are inadequate; there must be a way to create more skillful means for operating in the relative world. Christians who think that "God will take care of it" are also missing the boat. What is needed, said Judith Simmer-Brown, is the "coolness" that comes with enlighten-</page><page sequence="4">NEWS AND VIEWS ment to enable us to take on the particularity of the relative world so that we are not overwhelmed by the challenge. FURTHER RESPONSE: TO KAZA, "OVERCOMING THE GRIP OF CONSUMERISM Marjorie Suchocki's response immediately took up the question of how the religious community might best respond to Kaza's challenge, with the suggestion being that seminaries provide an excellent context for spreading the gospel of ecological ethics. This led to a discussion about the models of education that are now being employed to stimulate activists to confront suffering rather than escape it-which is the pur- pose of traditional education. Again, the need to bring these values into the work- place as well as the university was stressed so that structural violence can be treated at the source. But there is a danger that the university might abandon its long tra- dition of scholarship and critical thinking in order to address pressing social justice issues. Nevertheless, at least in Europe, the churches retain the prophetic voice and speak out critically on social issues without losing their commitment to the intel- lectual life. But there needs to be a kind of fierceness to the educational campaign when it comes to consumerism, drawing on, in the case of Buddhism, the protec- tive side of Zen rather than quietistic traditions. There is a collision coming between consumerism and both traditions, and the ugly realities of life must be confronted if we are to make a difference. FURTHER RESPONSE: TO KAUFMAN, ECOLOGICAL CONSCIOUSNESS AND THE SYMBOL GOD A powerful synthesis occurred during the final session of the encounter. The ques- tion Kaufman raised at the inception of the meeting was: How does Buddhism rec- oncile the need to accept reality "as it is" yet be committed to changing the socio- cultural reality? Further, and again, how does the change of individuals lead to social change? Sulak Sivaraksa turned to Buddhism's identification of ignorance as the source of bondage, both personal and social. To overcome this, ignorance of social institutions must be defeated, as well as ignorance about the nature of reality. So far, however, Buddhism has lacked a philosophical framework for understanding the objective (biohistorical) world, and must create a nonindividualistic analysis that supports action in the world. The doctrine of dependent origination should be extended, for example, to egos of all sizes-including corporations. By understand- ing the historical causes (mergers, etc.), the links can be deconstructed. Nevertheless, there was a sense that neither Christianity nor Buddhism provides an adequate framework for a theology designed to effect global redemption or liberation. The categorical problem of ecological disaster is a new level of challenge, requiring the transformation of demonic social structures and not merely individual hearts. Shu- bert Ogden then suggested that a modification of the Four Noble Truths was in order: that there are two kinds of suffering, transcendental and categorical (contex- 196</page><page sequence="5">NEWS AND VIEWS tually occasioned) suffering; that the cause of transcendental suffering is ignorance about my nature, while the cause of categorical suffering is empirical ignorance about facts; and that suffering ceases by awareness of my true nature in the case of transcendental suffering or of facts in the case of categorical suffering. A theology that focuses on the nature of ultimate reality can therefore be extended to a theol- ogy of the natural (biohistorical) world. The question of how Christian notions of salvation might be extended to the salvation of the world was not, however, reached.</page></plain_text>
