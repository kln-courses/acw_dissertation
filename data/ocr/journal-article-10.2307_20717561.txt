<plain_text><page sequence="1">HEIDEGGER, NIETZSCHE, AND THE ORIGINS OF NIHILISM Daniel W. Conway Introduction Martin Heidegger's 1940 lectures on Nietzsche contain the most important and influential philosophical discussion of the problem of nihilism.1 In the course of these lectures, Heidegger examines the notes for Nietzsche's ill-fated Hauptwerk and deftly reconstructs the account of European nihilism that Nietzsche was attempting to articulate. In the process of this reconstruction, of course, Heidegger also offers his own observations on the problem of nihilism, and eventually incorporates Nietzsche's (salvageable) insights into his own familiar meta-narrative. According to Heidegger, Nietzsche's inchoate account of nihilism stops short of a fundamental insight that Heidegger himself supplies: the history of nihilism is coterminous with the history of metaphysics. Nietzsche's 'blind spot' is attributable to his own complicated - but undeniable - role in the history of metaphysics. At least as portrayed by Heidegger, Nietzsche is simultaneously the greatest critic of metaphysics and its 'last' practitioner. Inextricably ensnared in the tradition of Western metaphysics, Nietzsche was unable finally to confront 'the essence (Wesen) of nihilism'.2 Heidegger's lectures on Nietzsche provide a masterful account of the history and development of European nihilism. Yet Heidegger's idiosyncratic preoccupation with Nietzsche's 11</page><page sequence="2">unpublished writings ultimately distracts him from the latter's investigation into the origin of nihilism. Heidegger fully appreciates the need to determine the logic of nihilism and to account for the provenance of those fragile values whose devaluation we currently experience. His strategy, to locate the origin of nihilism within metaphysics itself, is both attractive and faithful to Nietzsche's notebooks. Yet Heidegger never adequately explains the weakness for metaphysics that engages the logic of nihilism. Metaphysical values are inherently unstable, but why are human agents drawn so ineluctably to them? To what human need or deficiency do metaphysical values provide a response? Heidegger's characterisation of nihilism, as an epoch in the history of Being in which 'Nothing befalls Being itself'3, effectively identifies the 'metaphysical urge' as a human weakness for which no human cure or corrective exists. So long as Being reveals itself only in its concealment, human agents can do little but cultivate an attitude of resolute Gelassenheit. Heidegger's meta-narrative of the origin of nihilism thus renders meaningless any political deliberations designed to overcome or meliorate the cultural decadence associated with nihilism.4 Even a critical engagement with nihilism becomes problematic, for 'nihilism' is one name for the current Gift of Being; any criticism on our part would necessarily trade upon the subjectivism that is constitutive of nihilism. Until Being reveals itself in a new aspect, any prescriptive or meliorative measures would remain implicated in the nihilism they purport to 12</page><page sequence="3">challenge. As Heidegger told reporters in an eponymous interview, Nur noch ein Gott kann uns retten.* Nietzsche's naturalistic account of the origin of nihilism is problematic in its own right, as Heidegger ascertained, but it (ostensibly) preserves the possibility of a political response to the ills of modernity. His anthropological focus on the evolution of consciousness marks a deliberate turn away from the supernatural ism and subjectivism that have long impeded the progress of philosophical investigation. By conceiving of nihilism in purely naturalistic terms, Nietzsche salvages the philosophical project of critique and enables us to envision the possibility of change. Although the meliorative measures Nietzsche himself prescribes are unlikely to be implemented, his account of the origin of nihilism prepares modernity to survive the twilight of the idols. I. The Logic of Nihilism Nietzsche promised the readers of the Genealogy of Morals that he would deliver an essay 'On the History of European Nihilism'; it will be contained in a work in progress: The Will to Power: Attempt at a Revaluation of All Values (SM 111:27).' In 1888, however, Nietzsche abandoned the proposed Hauptwerk to which this citation alludes; he was either unable or unwilling to collect his notes on nihilism and deliver the promised essay. Any reconstruction of his account of nihilism thus involves a tenuous exegetical project, for one must rely extensively on these problematic, unpolished notes from the Nachlass. Here, of 13</page><page sequence="4">course, Heidegger serves as a capable guide, directing our attention to the notes most useful to this end. We should begin by determining what Nietzsche intended his diagnosis of 'European nihilism' to convey: who, or what, is this 'uncanniest of all guests' that 'stands at the door'?7 Whereas contemporary scholars use the term 'nihilism' rather loosely, to denote virtually any manifestation of cultural disarray, Nietzsche apparently intends something more precise. He alternately refers to nihilism as a psychological state (WTP 12) and a physiological condition, both of which are marked by exhaustion, pervasive pessimism, a dissipation of will, and an unprecedented erethism. We might say, then, that in these notebook entries Nietzsche equates nihilism with the experience of decay; we should therefore take quite seriously his frequent references to nihilism as a 'sickness' or 'disease'. By locating nihilism within human experience, Nietzsche effectively announces his intention to account for it in purely material or naturalistic terms. Having identified nihilism with the experience of physiological decadence, Nietzsche immediately cautions us not to mistake this experience for its cause. In a note from 1888, which echoes several others from that year, Nietzsche writes, Basic insight regarding the nature of decadence: its supposed causes are its consequences (HIE 41, cf. 42 45). He maintains that ...it is an error to consider 'social distress' or 'physiological degeneration' or, worse, corruption, as 14</page><page sequence="5">the cause of nihilism (WTP 1). He consequently ridicules the idea that we might combat nihilism simply by easing the discomfort that attends this experience of devaluation: ...the supposed remedies of degeneration are also mere palliatives against some of its effects: the 'cured' are merely one type of the degenerate (WTP 42, cf. XI 2:11). As Nietzsche reveals in an early prospectus for his ill-fated Hauptwerkf the experience of decay marks only the 'point of departure' for his investigation into nihilism (WTP 1). He consequently probes further, in order to determine the genuine cause of the physiological condition that he associates with this experience of decay. Nietzsche thus focuses on the physiological experience of decay not simply as an isolated historical event, but also as the most recent stage of development in a more complex logical process. His notes explicitly warn against divorcing the experience of decadence from the logical process it completes. These notebook entries thus confirm that Nietzsche employs the term 'nihilism' ambiguously, to refer both to the experience of decadence specific to contemporary Western Europe, and to the larger logical process of which this experience marks the most recent stage of development. He therefore speaks of a peculiarly European nihilism and of various eastern varieties,* as well as of the logic that informs them all. Nietzsche's tendency to shift unannounced from an historical perspective on nihilism to a logical perspective (and vice versa) explains many of the 15</page><page sequence="6">confusions that beset his notes on nihilism. Throughout my discussion, I will therefore distinguish (as Nietzsche did not) between the historical experience of nihilism and the logic of nihilism, where the former denotes the latest stage of development of the latter. Only if we view our current experience of physiological decay as the latest stage in a larger logical process can we hope to determine its cause.10 In a famous note from 1886, Nietzsche considers the general logical process to which all such historically specific experiences conform: What does nihilism mean? That the highest values devaluate themselves. The aim is lacking; 'why?' finds no answer fWTP 2).11 Nietzsche's response to his own query reveals several important aspects of the logic of nihilism. First of all, he neither asks, nor explains, what nihilism is; he is concerned instead to discern what it means for us. Heidegger's concern with the essence (Wesen) of nihilism thus misrepresents Nietzsche's interests, and constitutes a significant deviation from Nietzsche's own strategy. Heidegger rightly concludes that 'Nietzsche cannot think the essence of nihilism'," but then Nietzsche's interest lay elsewhere, in determining the meaning of nihilism. As we have already seen, the experience of nihilism points to a physiological/psychological condition of extreme depression and pronounced exhaustion. That we are currently in this condition means that our highest values, which were hitherto responsible for warding off this condition, have devaluated themselves, thereby forfeiting their narcotic value. 16</page><page sequence="7">Second, the historical devaluation of these values is neither arbitrary nor accidental; they devalue themselves.13 In an 1886 prospectus for his proposed Hauptwerk. Nietzsche describes nihilism as 'the necessary consequence of our valuations thus far'.X4 Two years later, in what he once intended as the Prologue to his Hauptwerkr Nietzsche confirms that 'nihilism represents the ultimate logical conclusion of our great values and ideals'." These notes thus recapitulate Nietzsche's characterisation of 'the law of life' in the Genealogy: All great things bring about their own destruction through an act of self-overcoming (Selbstaufhebung) (StL 111:27). The necessity of the devaluation of our highest values is therefore ensured by an (as yet) unspecified aspect of their internal logic. These notes thus suggest that the logic of nihilism governs not only the historical development of our highest values, but their origin as well.*' Third, the meaning of nihilism comprises the devaluation only of our highest {oberst) values. Oberst connotes not only a cardinal sense of authority, but a 'spatial' one as well - as if our 'highest' values were also those most distant from us. To explain why our highest values are also our most insubstantial, Nietzsche scrutinises their blighted birth. He blames philosophers for ? confusing the last and the first. They place that which comes at the end - unfortunately! for it ought not to come at alii - namely, the 'highest concepts'...in the beginning, as the beginning.. .Moral: whatever is of the first rank must be causa sui. Origin out of something else is considered an objection, a questioning of value. All the highest (obersten) values are of the first 17</page><page sequence="8">rank...and therefore must be causa sui (TI 3:4). Nietzsche thus attributes our current alienation from our highest values to a fundamental (and perhaps wilful) confusion concerning their origin. Humankind once believed its highest values to have originated causa sui, innocent of history or genealogy, but we now see them as expressions of specific, historically contingent human interests. Once revealed to be all-too-human in origin, these values forfeit their oberst status and take their place beside all other 'merely' human values. Designed originally to redeem the human condition, our highest values now stand in need of redemption.17 Although all values are subject to historical devaluation, only the devaluation of our highest values, which supposedly originated causa sui, engages the logic of nihilism. As a consequence, only the devaluation of our highest values occasions the experience of nihilism. The devaluation of 'lesser' values, whose human origin was never disputed, need not partake of the logic of nihilism. By restricting the logic of nihilism exclusively to the devaluation of our oberst values, Nietzsche establishes the logical possibility that the experience of nihilism can possibly be avoided, mitigated or perhaps overcome. Heidegger, of course, acknowledges no interesting distinction between kinds or ranks of value. According to Heidegger, Nietzsche's emphasis on value derives from his identification of Being with will to power, an identification that 'does not let Being be Being', and marks the 'consummation of nihilism'.18 18</page><page sequence="9">Nietzsche failed to think himself free of subjectivism, and thus failed in his alleged attempt to overcome metaphysics. II. Heidegger's Interpretation These notes thus confirm that Nietzsche's discussion of the experience of nihilism was to have served primarily as a point of departure for an investigation into the origin of those oberst values whose devaluation occasions this experience. In a note from 1888 Nietzsche explicitly links the experience of nihilism to the origin of our oberst values: Now that the shabby origin of these values is becoming clear, the universe seems to have lost value, seems ' meaningless '. * In order to reconstruct the logic of nihilism, we must therefore investigate the 'shabby origin' of our oberst values: why does the human origin of these values constitute an objection to them? Toward this end, Heidegger' s interpretation makes great progress. The centrepiece of his account is a close reading of a note from 1887-88, entitled 'Decline of Cosmological Values', in which Nietzsche characterises nihilism as a 'psychological state' (WTP 12). As Heidegger points out, this note describes three psychological moments of nihilism, all of which attribute the devaluation of the world of Being to an original overestimation of the value of Becoming.20 But why do we invest such faith in these fragile values? At this point, I believe, Heidegger exhausts his value to us as a guide through the labyrinth of Nietzsche's thought, for here his own 19</page><page sequence="10">agenda, which requires him to figure Nietzsche as 'the last metaphysician', crowds out his interpretative project. Translating Nietzsche into the Procrustean categories of his own philosophical project, Heidegger locates the origin of nihilism in the irreducibly subjectivistic act of positing values, whereby Being is degraded to the level of a value posited by the will to power. The history of nihilism is therefore coterminous with the history of metaphysics, which reaches its final stage of development in Nietzsche's doctrine of the will to power: Because thinking in terms of values is grounded in the metaphysics of will to power, Nietzsche's interpretation of nihilism as the event of the devaluing of all values is a metaphysical interpretation, and that in the sense of the metaphysics of the will to power.21 According to Heidegger, Nietzsche proposes an essentially subjectivistic solution to the problem of nihilism - a 'revaluation of all values' - and therefore remains a residually metaphysical thinker, albeit the 'last' of this breed: 'even Nietzsche's own experience of nihilism, i.e., that it is the devaluing of the highest values, is after all a nihilistic one'.22 Heidegger's charge of residual subjectivism, although justifiably levelled against all philosophers (himself included), is somewhat misplaced here. In his attempt to incorporate Nietzsche's account of nihilism into his own, Heidegger ignores Nietzsche's attempt to offer a purely naturalistic explanation of the origin of nihilism. According to Heidegger, for example, Yet for Nietzsche nihilism is not in any way simply a 20</page><page sequence="11">phenomenon of decay; rather nihilism is, as the fundamental event of Western history, simultaneously and above all the intrinsic law of that history_Nietzsche thinks nihilism as the 'inner logic' of Western history.23 While there is certainly some truth in this characterisation, it is obscured by Heidegger's attempt to appropriate Nietzsche's thinking on nihilism as the logical completion of Western metaphysics. Heidegger too views nihilism as the 'inner logic' of the Western tradition, but claims for himself a 'privileged' standpoint that he attains as a result of Nietzsche's instructive failure. Heidegger sees what Nietzsche apparently did not - namely, that Nietzsche's reliance on the will to power as the principle of revaluation completes (rather than confounds) the 'inner logic' of the Western tradition. Heidegger thus concludes that 'Nietzsche never recognised the essence of nihilism, just as no metaphysics before him ever did'.24 Rather than address the anthropological account of the origin of nihilism that informs Nietzsche's published writings, Heidegger dredges the notebooks to fashion a dubious pastiche of ?bermensch, will to power and revaluation of values. Projecting this contrived reading onto Nietzsche, Heidegger announces that Despite all his overturnings and revaluings of metaphysics, Nietzsche remains in the unbroken line of the metaphysical tradition when he calls that which is established and made fast in the will to power for its own preservation purely and simply Being, or what is in being, or truth.25 It is not entirely fair to say that Heidegger overlooks Nietzsche's turn to naturalism, "for he constructs his own account of nihilism in large part to avoid the residual subjectivism of 21</page><page sequence="12">Nietzsche's alleged campaign to overcome metaphysics. But Heidegger apparently does overlook (or discount) Nietzsche's acknowledgment of his own continued situation within the metaphysical tradition against which he raged. Nietzsche did not succeed in 'thinking the essence of nihilism', but it is not clear that he viewed such a goal as historically viable, much less that he was blind to his 'failure'. Heidegger often suggests that Nietzsche's underestimation of the thrall of metaphysics consigns him to the unwanted role of 'last metaphysician'. But it is difficult to resist the suspicion that Heidegger wilfully places Nietzsche in this role - for example, by concentrating on those writings that prove most pliable in this regard - while reserving another role for himself. Nietzsche's turn to naturalism is precipitated, I believe, by his understanding of modernity as an age illuminated only by the 'twilight of the idols', an age in which metaphysics is both indefensible and indispensable. Nietzsche is consigned by his crepuscular destiny to a continued reliance on metaphysics, even as he shatters the reigning metaphysical idols of the day. Although he does not entirely escape the snares of subjectivism, he nowhere claims to have done so; in fact, he candidly refers on occasion to his rich metaphysical heritage, as well as to the ineliminable metaphysical currents resident in his thought. Heidegger's alternative strategy, to link the destinies of nihilism and metaphysics, leads him to advance a meta-narrative that encourages the attribution to Being of supernatural 22</page><page sequence="13">properties and powers. In the twilight of the idols, we cannot help but invest Being with anthropomorphic, messianic properties; if his Spiegel interview is any indication, even Heidegger himself was not immune to this investment. From Nietzsche's perspective, a significant disadvantage of Heidegger's account of nihilism is its tendency to discourage political activity while we meditatively await a new Gift of Being. Because it so readily lends itself to supernatural or metaphysical interpretations, Heidegger's account of the origin of nihilism potentially exacerbates the experience of European nihilism. Heidegger's attempt to 'set aside' metaphysics dangerously underestimates the need of modernity for the sort of redemptive meta-narrative that he unwittingly supplies. If Nietzsche anticipated Heidegger's general line of criticism, then his turn to naturalism perhaps indicates that he not only considered the alternative approach to metaphysics that Heidegger's later philosophy attempts to implement, but rejected this approach as well. III. Nietzsche's Naturalistic Account of the Origin of Nihilism In order to provide a fuller account of the logic of nihilism, we must turn now to Nietzsche's writings from the period 1886-88. This period undeniably comprises 'a time of utter lucidity and keen insight',26 but, unlike Heidegger, I will focus on Nietzsche's published works, which contain an implicit account of nihilism that we can reconstruct with some confidence. I hope to show that we need not invest in Nietzsche's unpublished notes the degree of credence that Heidegger recommends.27 Upon 23</page><page sequence="14">comparing this published account of nihilism with the notes that Heidegger gamely attempts to piece together, one sees that Nietzsche wisely suspended his plans for the envisioned Hauptwerk. On two occasions in the 1887 Toward a Genealogy of Morals. Nietzsche refers to nihilism in terms of a culturally-specific experience, describing his historical situation as verging upon a 'European Buddhism' (?M P:5), and noting that we have grown 'weary of man' (&lt;SM 1:12). But Nietzsche is also concerned in the Genealogy to discern the logic of nihilism. On two occasions, he associates nihilism with a 'will to nothingness' (?M 11:24, 111:14) that he identifies as the source of our current experience of nihilism. In order to link these two moments of nihilism - the will to nothingness and the advent of a European Buddhism - Nietzsche develops a naturalistic account of the evolution of the human species. The aim of Nietzsche's philosophical anthropology is 'to translate man back into nature' (??? 230), i.e., to view the human as a type of animal, and to account for this animal in purely naturalistic terms. The Genealogy thus charts the evolution within civilisation of the human animal. The key to Nietzsche's philosophical anthropology lies in his naturalistic account of human agency. Against the backdrop of Nietzsche's naturalism, we should now consider one of the most decisive, and troubling, claims of the Genealogy: the basic fact (die Grundthatsache) of the human will (is) its horror vacui: it needs a goal (Ziel) - and it 24</page><page sequence="15">would rather will nothingness than not will (das Nichts wollen, als nicht wollen) (SM 111:1). Strictly speaking, for Nietzsche, there is no will, but only willing.3* Nietzsche understands the will not as a metaphysical agency, but as the phenomenal experience of efficacity that attends a certain threshold level of affective investment. As he remarks in the Genealogy. 'Every animal - therefore la bete philosophe, too - instinctively strives for an optimum of favourable conditions under which it can expend all its strength and achieve its maximal feeling of power' (fiM 111:7). In order to sustain a level of affective investment commensurate with willing, human animals require goals to focus, channel and enhance their affective engagement with the world. In the pursuit of these goals, we experience ourselves as causally efficient, i.e., as powerful.** Nietzsche therefore employs the term 'goal' in a strictly functional sense, to refer to any end whose pursuit can be 'justified' in an interpretative context that excites a vital level of affective investment and thus engages the will.30 At the conclusion of Essay III, Nietzsche resumes his account of the horror vacui of the will, explaining that, Apart from the ascetic ideal, man, the human animal, had no meaning so far. His existence on earth contained no goal; 'why man at all?' - was a question without an answer; the will for man and earth was lacking; behind every great human destiny there sounded as a refrain a yet greater 'in vain! (Umsonst/)'31 This is precisely what the ascetic ideal means: that something was lacking, that man was surrounded by a fearful void - he did not know how to justify, to account for, to affirm himself; he suffered from the problem' of his meaning. He also suffered otherwise, he was in the main a sickly animal: but his problem was not suffering itself, but 25</page><page sequence="16">that there was no answer to the crying question, 'why do I suffer'? (?M 111:28)" The horror vacui of the human will thus originates in the conviction that the suffering endemic to human existence requires a justification, lest this suffering, if meaningless, constitute a mortal objection to life itself. The only justification provided thus far issues from the ascetic ideal, which establishes self-denial as the goal of life. But whence this preoccupation with a justification of suffering? Whence this Silenian refrain that negates all human destinies? Nietzsche's explicit concern with the justification of suffering suggests the implicit centrality of death: only against the expanded horizon of mortality does suffering count as an objection to life. The argument of the Genealogy thus suggests that an unprecedented confrontation with death is the source of the 'in vain!' that crumbles all human destinies and excites the horror vacui of the will. This confrontation with death triggers the concern - heretofore unknown - that a justification of life predicated exclusively on values of human origin would be transient and inadequate, if possible at all. Strictly speaking, of course, death alone is not capable of exciting the horror vacui of the will. The origin of nihilism lies rather in the human animal's consciousness of its own mortality. In a remarkable insight that adumbrates Heidegger's own masterful discussion of death in Being and Time. Nietzsche traces the horror vacui of the will to the human animal's consciousness of its own mortality. 26</page><page sequence="17">Nietzsche first refers to the horror vacui of the human will in Essay III of the Genealogy r but the context of that reference evidently presupposes the reader's familiarity with the concept. In order to appreciate Nietzsche's account of the horror vacui, we must revert to Essay II of the Genealogy, in which Nietzsche speculates upon the origin of the bad conscience (schlechtes Gewissen). 'The basic fact of the human will' refers, I believe, to the distinguishing mark of the evolving human animal, and thus links the horror vacui to Nietzsche's anthropological account of the origin of the bad conscience: I regard the bad conscience as the serious illness that man was bound to contract under the stress of the most fundamental change he ever experienced - that change which occurred when he found himself finally enclosed within the walls of society and of peace...thus began the gravest and uncanniest illness, from which humanity has not yet recovered, man's suffering of man, of himself - the result of a forcible sundering from his animal past, as it were a leap and plunge into new surroundings and conditions of existence, a declaration of war against the old instincts upon which his strength, joy, and terribleness had rested hitherto (?M 11:16, emphasis added). As a conseguence of this unprecedented renunciation of instinct, these hominid creatures were obliged to entrust the internal regulation and maintenance of their natural organisms - tasks hitherto discharged efficiently and quietly by the instincts - to a newly-developed organ ill-suited to preside over the natural economy of life: (These semi-animals) were reduced to thinking, inferring, reckoning, co-ordinating cause and effect, these unfortunate creatures; they were reduced to their 'consciousness', their weakest and most fallible organ! (GM 11:16). Responding to the exigencies of civilized society, human animals 27</page><page sequence="18">were forced to acquire 'souls', i.e., psychological arenas in which they could vent against themselves all anti-social instincts. The 'bad conscience', Nietzsche's term for the physiological condition that attends the 'internalisation of man (Verinnerlichung des Menschen)', is therefore the price human animals pay for relying on consciousness as an organ of internal regulation. We can think of the horror vacui of the will as a particular expression or by-product of the bad conscience. The anthropological focus of the Genealogy is shared by Nietzsche's other works from the period 1886-88, especially Twilight of the Idols, Book v of The gay Science, and Ths. Antichrist(ian&gt;. Nietzsche's writings from this period evince his interest in two (relatively) new themes of investigation: the problem of nihilism and the evolution of consciousness.93 As I have suggested, these two interests are not only related, but continuous. Taken collectively, these writings articulate a naturalistic explanation of the origin and development of human consciousness, and thus link the horror vacui of the will to the 'existential' suffering of the bad conscience. I suggest that we think of the former as a particular expression of the latter: whereas the bad conscience represents the opportunity cost of relying on consciousness, the horror vacui is linked specifically to the consciousness of one's mortality. As the basis of his foray into philosophical anthropology, Nietzsche hypothesises that consciousness must play for the human animal the role that the instincts play for natural animals: the 28</page><page sequence="19">regulation of the economy of life. Nature regulates the micro economy of other animals, and thus its own macro-economy, by means of instincts. But the human animal has strayed from its instinctual heritage - an apostasy unique in the animal kingdom - and has consequently acquired a mediated relation to nature. The human animal consequently regulates the economy of its natural organism by negotiating between an immediate relation that it has forcibly renounced and a mediated relation that it knows to be inefficient (and painful). Within this space, the human animal confronts its body as both self and other, and must compensate for its apostasy from nature by relying on the newly-developed organ of consciousness to determine a healthy level and degree of affective expenditure. Nietzsche intends his naturalistic account of consciousness to contribute to a larger attack on subjectivism. By consistently referring to consciousness as an organ, Nietzsche resists the tendency (which he associates with humanism) to confer upon consciousness a supernatural status.34 The perceived 'imperfection' of consciousness therefore obtains only in relation to the task of regulating the natural economy of the organism. In comparison to the instincts, consciousness presides over an economically inefficient animal organism: The development of consciousness, the 'spirit', is for us nothing less than the symptom of a relative imperfection of the organism; it means trying, groping, blundering - an exertion which uses up an unnecessary amount of nervous energy (A? 14). Nietzsche's turn to naturalism requires that he advance only an immanent critique of consciousness, as a regulatory organ 29</page><page sequence="20">deficient on its own terms: 'relatively speaking, man is the most bungled of all the animals, the sickliest, and not one has strayed more dangerously from its instincts. But for all that, he is of course the most Interesting' (A? 14)- in no event does Nietzsche criticize consciousness simply in and of itself, and he certainly does not recommend any sort of romantic retreat from our reliance on consciousness. Only the human animal requires a justification of life, and Nietzsche attributes this need to the relative imperfection of consciousness as a regulatory organ. As conscious beings, for whom formerly instinctual issues of regulation have entered consciousness, human animals acquire a 'second nature', whereby they naturally seek a justification of life itself, for which, strictly speaking, no justification is possible. This requirement, Nietzsche believes, places an additional strain on the natural economy of the human animal. Because 'consciousness does not really belong to man's individual existence but rather to his social or herd nature' (?S 354), the only experiences that enter consciousness (and thus the only experiences that contribute to the formulation of our goals) are those that reflect our common 'herd' nature. As the realm of consciousness expands and we become more reliant on it, our capacity for individual expression diminishes. Nietzsche claims that in 'the most conscious Europeans', consciousness has become a 'disease' (?? 354). Given the imperfect development of consciousness thus far, human 30</page><page sequence="21">beings cannot help but ask for a justification that only the ascetic ideal can provide.35 The ascetic ideal regulates the affective life of the human animal by re-directing inward the path of ressentiment, thus obviating a potentially mortal expenditure of affect. Not coincidentally, the justification of suffering provided by the ascetic ideal tallies neatly with the anti-instinctual demands of a peaceful society. The ascetic ideal gives man meaning, and thus quiets the horror vacui of the human will, by claiming that human animals deserve the pain of their mortal existence: 'man...must seek (the cause of his suffering) in himself, in some guilt, in a piece of the past, he must understand his suffering as a punishment'' (?H 111:28). By pronouncing humankind guilty, the ascetic ideal encourages human animals to blame themselves for their bad conscience, and thus to engage themselves affectively in the destruction of their own affective lives. As a consequence of our guilt, the values we posit are as fragile and ephemeral - as 'shabby' - as we ourselves. In order to engender meaning for our mortal existence, we naturally appeal to values that ostensibly transcend or circumvent it, values that we would like to believe originate causa sui. The horror vacui of the will thus presides over (and temporarily masks) the 'shabby origin' of our oberst values. Unable otherwise to secure meaning for their lives, human animals revere these oberst values, in the hope of justifying their suffering, and thus quieting their noisy souls. The human animal consequently labours in the service of the goal of self-perfection, understood 31</page><page sequence="22">in ascetic terms as self-abnegation. The intercession of the ascetic ideal thus provides an interpretative context in which the suffering of our mortal existence is justified, albeit as a punishment that we deserve. The 'will was saved' thereby - but at what cost? As we have seen, Nietzsche interprets the pain of the bad conscience as the ineliminable, non-negotiable price we pay for relying on consciousness as an organ of internal regulation. Nietzsche views guilt as an interpretation of the bad conscience that justifies 'existential' suffering, but only at the expense of further, surplus suffering; we blame ourselves for deserving the pain of the bad conscience. As a consequence of the transmission of guilt via the institutions of Western civilisation, the only goals available to' us capable of sustaining the will and empowering us as agents require our participation in the destruction of our own affective lives. Nietzsche thus argues that, if necessary, human animals will invest themselves affectively in their own self-destruction, for even this goal is preferable to no goal at all. The 'last will of man', the will to nothingness, is engaged when the sole remaining goal capable of exciting a vital level of affective investment is that of self-annihilation: the will never to will again. In order to achieve a level of affective investment commensurate with willing, human animals would rather will their own annihilation than concede that human suffering admits of no justification. The only perceived alternative, not 32</page><page sequence="23">willing, disinterestedly detaching oneself from the world, is tantamount to a cessation of life. If the human animal is to survive its transition from instinct to consciousness, this horror vacui must subside to the extent that the will to nothingness is no longer perceived as the sole available option. Nietzsche's complicated opposition to the ascetic ideal becomes somewhat clearer in light of his naturalistic account of the origin of nihilism. Having presided over the transition thus far from instinct to consciousness, the ascetic ideal has exhausted its usefulness for the human animal. The ascetic ideal in its present form constitutes a potentially mortal threat to the human animal, and a fortiori to the further evolution of consciousness as a regulatory organ. Nietzsche thus exposes the ascetic ideal, the original saviour of the will, as the source of the will to nothingness. Under the aegis of the ascetic ideal, the human animal would rather will its own destruction than admit that its suffering is meaningless. If I am right in linking the horror vacui of the will to the bad conscience, then we can think of the horror vacui as the most obvious sign or manifestation of the relative imperfection of consciousness. Our reliance on consciousness requires us to pursue goals, in order to sustain a threshold level of affective investment. Our need for enduring goals leads us 'naturally' to embrace the ascetic ideal, which enshrines as our goal the destruction of our affective life. Overtaxed by this internecine affective strife, the economy of the soul ultimately exhausts 33</page><page sequence="24">itself, yielding to the 'last will of man', the will to nothingness. IV. Nietzsche's Account of the Origin of Nihilism: An Outline Having reconstructed the logic of nihilism, and located its origin in a relative imperfection of consciousness, I will now review Nietzsche's account of nihilism as a logical process of which the decadence of contemporary Western Europe represents the most recent stage of development. We will see that this explanation of the origin of nihilism underwrites Nietzsche's characterisation of modernity as a period of attenuated transition. 1) In the transition to civil society, the human animal renounces its instincts, entrusting to consciousness the regulative function naturally discharged by the instincts. Formerly unconscious issues of maintenance and sustenance, e.g., the appropriate level and degree of affective investment, now become conscious for the human animal. 2) Now conscious of its mortality, the human animal begins to question the value of all human destinies, of the meaning of life itself: why should we endure the suffering endemic to human existence if death erases all that we have accomplished? The human animal was unable to justify its suffering because it could not affirm its own mortality, its own 'sickliness'. 3) Its horror vacui now engaged, the human animal welcomes any 34</page><page sequence="25">goal that might justify human suffering and thus enable the will. 4) The ascetic ideal offers meaning by identifying humankind itself as the agent responsible for its suffering. As a means of redeeming their suffering and guilt, human animals adopt the goal of self-perfection via self-abnegation. Humankind can now affirm its existence, but only through the mediation of metaphysical contrivances that invest in human suffering (only) an instrumental value. The ascetic ideal is therefore inherently metaphysical, creating a 'true world' in relation to which the natural world is deemed inferior (though derivatively valuable). 5) Buoyed' by the promise of redemption, as embodied in the constellation of oberst values supplied by the ascetic ideal, the human animal diligently pursues the goal of self-perfection* Compounding the suffering known as the 'bad conscience', the ascetic ideal urges them to justify their suffering by blaming themselves for it. 6) These oberst values gradually devaluate themselves as their 'shabby' human origin becomes apparent. The artificially inflated values provided by the ascetic ideal consequently deflate themselves and no longer promise to redeem the ephemerality and transience of the human condition. 7) The experience of nihilism as a psychological state: we no 35</page><page sequence="26">longer accept self-denial as a goal that redeems our mortality and justifies our existence. Yet we remain convinced nonetheless that we stand in need of some such redemption. Centuries of ascetic self-denial have induced a condition of physiological exhaustion, psychological depression, and an unprecedented erethism. 8) Bereft of alternatives, we embrace the ascetic ideal in its purest, skeletal form: 'the last will of mankind', the will to nothingness. At this point, our maximal experience of power derives from our affective engagement in our own annihilation. We will never to will again. Conclusion Nietzsche's naturalistic account of the origin of nihilism serves as the basis for his diagnosis of the plight of modernity. Nietzsche believes that our crepuscular destiny consigns us to a dangerous and unstable position of transition: although we have sufficient 'daylight' to see through the corrupt idols from which we have heretofore drawn enduring meaning and spiritual sustenance, our 'vision' is sufficiently occluded to prohibit us from disavowing all belief in these idols. As a consequence, we must continue to rely upon values that we know to be devalued and bankrupt, and to pursue goals we know to be pointless. We can neither trust nor abandon the false idols of modernity, though we can disastrously convince ourselves otherwise. This is the plight of philosophy in the twilight of the idols, and Nietzsche acknowledges this plight as his own. 36</page><page sequence="27">In the end, Heidegger fails to appreciate the self-referential implications of Nietzsche's diagnosis of modernity. Heidegger misunderstands Nietzsche's famous pronouncement of the 'death of God', an event that symbolically marks the advent of the twilight of the idols.** More precisely, Heidegger arrogates to himself an insight that properly and originally belongs to Nietzsche, who already knows that his anthropological account of nihilism is irreducibly subjectivistic. In short, Nietzsche anticipates Heidegger's critique of his philosophy, referring to himself on several occasions as a metaphysician, and thereby distinguishing himself from the 'philosophers of the future' who might someday overcome metaphysics altogether. Although God is dead, Nietzsche still craves the redemption that only a god could provide. Nietzsche's characterisation of modernity allows for the possibility both of a critical engagement with nihilism and of directed political countermeasures. 'The bad conscience is an illness', Nietzsche explains, 'but an illness as pregnancy is an illness' (sn II:19). The metaphor of pregnancy strikes two hopeful chords - for 'child' and 'mother', respectively. First of all, Nietzsche suggests that European nihilism is a temporary, transitional condition." If the human animal can survive its protracted transition to civilised society, then it may one day 'give birth' to a creature confidently reliant on consciousness as a regulatory organ. Second, although Nietzsche and his fellow free spirits can do nothing to ease the pain endemic to the bad conscience, they can perhaps eliminate the surplus suffering engendered by an ascetic interpretation of the bad conscience.3* 37</page><page sequence="28">Nietzsche's naturalistic account of the origin of nihilism makes great strides toward this end, for he forcefully shows that no one is responsible for the pain of the bad conscience; it is simply the price we pay for becoming 'interesting animals', 'pregnant with a future'. Nietzsche's naturalistic account of nihilism thus encourages us to avoid an ascetic moralisation of the suffering that attends the bad conscience. In a formula of affirmation he associates with Dionysus, Nietzsche proposes that 'the pangs of the woman giving birth hallow all pain; all becoming and growing - all that guarantees a future - involves pain' (II, 10:4). The 'revalution of values' that Nietzsche envisions can be conceived along the lines of a re-organisation of cultural resources designed to ensure the survival of the human animal. Notwithstanding Heidegger's baffling campaign to saddle Nietzsche with Zarathustra's redemptive teaching of the ?bermensch (which Nietzsche himself offers up for ridicule),3* Nietzsche proffers no plan for overcoming either metaphysics or nihilism. Cognizant that modernity probably lacks the resources for any such undertaking, and that he at any rate is too decadent to execute it, he presents himself instead as paving the way for the 'philosophers of the future', whose legislations will presumably break the stranglehold of nihilism. Nietzsche's task in the interim is to ensure the survival of the human animal as it perfects its reliance on consciousness as a regulatory organ. Toward this end, he mounts a tireless campaign 38</page><page sequence="29">against all purveyors of guilt (including himself) and bolsters the resolve of his readers with tales of Zarathustra, an exemplary survivor and transitional figure. As Heidegger (or his followers) might point out, Nietzsche's survival strategies are hopelessly subjectivistic, and thus reinforce the nihilism he ostensibly aims to combat. Of course, the same can be said for Heidegger's own attempts to orchestrate a 'turning' of human destiny through 'preparatory thinking'.40 But Nietzsche and his fellow free spirits cannot abide by the raptures of Gelassenheit while Heidegger and his fellow poets decipher the intimations of Being. At least from Nietzsche's residually subjectivistic perspective, there is too much at stake. 39</page><page sequence="30">NOTES I presented an earlier version of this paper to the Society for Philosophy and Existential Philosophy. My thanks to an anonymous referee for instructive comments and criticisms. 1. For his 1943 essay 'The Word of Nietzsche: God is Dead', Heidegger drew heavily on the Nietzsche lectures delivered in Freiburg between 1936-40. See William Lovitt's translation and edition of The_Question_Concerning Technology and other Essays. (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1977), p. x. My occasional emendations of Lovitt's translation refer to the text of 'Nietzsches Wort "Gott ist tot"' in Holzwege (Frankfurt/M: Vittorio Klostermann, 1950). 2. Lovitt, p.61. 3. Lovitt, p.41. 4. Luc Ferry contends that 'if it is Being that "acts" through us, if under these conditions it behooves us "to do nothing, merely to wait" and to adopt the pure and simple attitude of "releasement" (Gelassenheit), any ethical view of the world, every form of criticism should vanish. It would be pointless, then, to clutter up the marketplace with books denouncing the ravages of technology, the horrors of totalitarianism, or "the banality of evil", because for someone thinking philosophically, "coherence", however conceived, cannot be a vain word.'

David F. Krell (San Francisco, Harper &amp; Row, 1982), pp.52-57. According to Heidegger, 'Nietzsche thinks nihilism as the "inner logic" of Western 40</page><page sequence="31">history' (Lovitt, p.67). 10. Heidegger dissolves this ambiguity by claiming that 'Nietzsche understands nihilism as an ongoing historical event', thus privileging the logic of nihilism (Lovitt, p.66). 11. Nietzsche asks a similar question in Essay III of the Genealogy: Was bedeuten asketische Ideale? Nietzsche's interest in the meaning of nihilism thus links this note thematically to the third Essay of the GenealogyP which is devoted to the meaning of the ascetic ideal. Later in the Genealogyf he explains his hermeneutic focus: It is my purpose here to bring to light, not what this (ascetic) ideal has done, but simply what it means; what it indicates; what lies hidden behind it, beneath it, within it; of what it is the provisional, indistinct expression, overlaid with question marks and misunderstandings (?M 111:23). 12. Lovitt, p.93. 13. In The Birth of Tragedy. Nietzsche portrayed the devaluation of the tragic worldview as both a consequence of its 'death struggle' with Socratic optimism and as a 'suicide'. He confusedly blamed Socrates and Euripides for impelling the 'death-leap' of tragedy despite his recognition that they were unable to affect tragedy otherwise. In the account of nihilism under consideration, however, Nietzsche suggests that rival configurations of value (e.g. Socratism) function not as causes of devaluation, but as historical catalysts of devaluation that exploit the internal logic of these doomed values. 14. K?W VIII2; 2(100), s.107. 15. K?W VIII2; 11(411) ?4, s.432. 16. As Heidegger points out, 'The very positing of these values in the world is already nihilism'. Krell, p.44. 17.

Lovitt, p.84. 26. Krell, p.13. 27. While explaining why we must concentrate on Nietzsche's notebooks rather than on his published works, Heidegger describes 'the two final years 1887 and 1888' as 'a time of utter lucidity and keen insight' (Krell, p.13). One wonders why the published works of this period are not of greater value to Heidegger. As I hope to establish, Nietzsche's published books from this period contain a much more interesting and defensible account of nihilism. 28. Cf. ffiCE 715. 29. In a passage that is rarely taken seriously, but which perhaps makes more sense in light of our current context, Nietzsche asks, '"What is good"? Everything that heightens the feeling of power in man, the will to power, power itself...What is happiness? The feeling that power is growing, that resistance is overcome' (&amp;? 2). 30. In ?M 111:23, Nietzsche refers to 'goals' and 'ideals' interchangeably; thus a new goal would be equivalent to an alternative to the ascetic ideal. 31. The refrain 'in vain!' occurs frequently in Nietzsche's notes concerning nihilism; cf. WTP 24, 113 B. 32. This passage recalls the notebook entry in which Nietzsche explains the meaning of nihilism: 'the aim is lacking; "why?" finds no answer' (WTP 2). This question of the meaning of the ascetic ideal perhaps replaces or subsumes the question of the meaning of nihilism pursued in the notebooks. 33. Nietzsche's interest in these themes is precipitated by a fundamental revolution in his thought, as announced in the retrospective prefaces of 1886. 34. For Nietzsche's attempt to resist humanism, see also fi?? 230. 35. CF. Kant: 'Human knowledge has this peculiar fate that in one species of its knowledge it is burdened by questions, which, as prescribed by the very nature of reason itself, it is not able to ignore, but which, as transcending all its power, it is also not able to answer'. Critique of Pure Reason A vii, Kemp Smith translation. 42</page><page sequence="33">36. It is perhaps noteworthy that Heidegger's case against Nietzsche relies heavily on two texts in which Nietzsche does not speak in his own voice: QS. 125 ('The Madman') and Zarathustra's teaching of the ?bermensch. The urgency of Heidegger's own agenda perhaps prohibited a careful attention to the dramatic structure of these texts. 37. Cf. WSR, 13 38. Arthur Danto has drawn a helpful distinction between 'extensional suffering and intensional suffering, where the latter consists of an interpretation of the former'. Arthur Danto, 'Some Remarks on The Genealogy of Morals, in Reading Nietzsche, eds Robert C. Solomon and Kathleen M. Higgins (New York, Oxford University Press, 1988), p.21. Although Nietzsche can do nothing to reduce the level of extensional suffering in the world, and in any event exhibits no inclination to do so, he can perhaps eliminate some degree of intensional suffering by providing an alternative, non-moral interpretation of extensional suffering. 39. Heidegger's unexpected turn to Zarathustra (Lovitt, pp.96 100) is difficult to explain. He studiously avoids Nietzsche's published writings, including those from 1887 88 - 'a time of utter lucidity and keen insight' - but attempts to seal his case by attributing to Nietzsche Zarathustra's dubious teaching of the ?bermensch. Michael Zimmerman has persuasively shown that Heidegger read Nietzsche (and particularly the ?bermensch) in terms of Ernst Junger's dystopian predictions about the future. Heidegger's_confrontation with Modernity (Bioomington, Indiana University Press, 1990), Chapter 11, especially pp.182-190. 40. Heidegger explains that 'What matters to preparatory thinking is to light up that space within which Being itself might again be able to take man, with respect to his essence, into a primal relationship' (Lovitt, p.55). 43</page></plain_text>
