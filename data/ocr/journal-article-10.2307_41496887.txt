BERNBECK Abstract: As archaeologists we are accustomed to classifying and categorizing the material remains of past groups. We tend , however ; to devote relatively little thought to the background and implications of our practices of categorization. In this paper ; we address three elements of classification: the ways in which archaeologists classify objects recovered in the context offieldwork, the classifications used by people in the past, and the relationship between these sets of categories. We use the example of our excavations at the Halaf - period site ofFistikli Höyük in Southeastern Turkey to illustrate how we came to think differently about our own set of archaeological categories as well as the ways in which Halaf inhabitants of the site may have categorized their world. Résumé: En tant qu'archéologues, nous sommes habitués à classifier et à cataloguer les vestiges matériels des sociétés passées. Cependant, nous nous consacrons peu aux fondements et aux implications de ces pratiques de catégorisation. Cet article analyse les trois éléments suivants : la manière selon laquelle les archéologues classent les objets issus des fouilles, les classifications opé- rées par les peuples anciens, et le rapport entre ces deux ensembles de catégorisation. Nos travaux à Fistikli Höyük, un site de la période de Halaf dans le Sud-Est de la Turquie, illustrent comment nous avons été amenés à conceptualiser différemment notre méthode de classification des vestiges archéologiques, et la manière selon laquelle les habitants halafiens de ce village ont ordonné leur monde. Keywords: Categories; Classification; Halaf; Fistikli Höyük. Mots-clés : Catégories ; Classification ; Halaf ; Fistikli Höyük. Whenever we approach the study of archaeological materi- als, we immediately begin to classify our finds into different categories. This is perhaps most obvious when our work cen- ters around a site or region that is under researched; in better known cases the process often becomes routine. In this paper, we draw attention to some of the wider con- sequences of the ways in which we typically classify material culture, whether fixed installations and architecture or col- lections of objects. We first discuss the relational character of classificatory processes and their specific forms as a way to approach "archaeo-logical" categorizations. We then consider a case from our excavations at the early 6th millennium ВСЕ Halaf site of Fistikli Höyük in Southeastern Turkey. Neither traditional ways of dealing with archaeological materials nor their insertion into standard narratives about the Halaf period do justice to the findings from Fistikli Höyük. We argue instead for the need to be critically attentive to the historicity and cul- tural specificity of both past and present categorizations. In conclusion, we outline the consequences of these findings for an archaeology that seeks to be reflexive on the categorical level by recognizing in praxi not only the historicity of the past but of our own work. We dedicate these reflections to G. Dollfus, whose meticu- lous research on the Early Prehistory of the Susiana Plain has served as an inspiration to us both. Her astute observations and comprehensive publications will remain a cornerstone of the archaeology of Southwestern Iran for many years to come.

BERNBECK THE ROLE OF CATEGORIES IN ARCHAEOLOGICAL DISCOURSE We propose to approach categorization from a science studies perspective, that is, we look at archaeological practices of classifying as deeply "cultural" activities that are rarely questioned by their practitioners.1 Archaeological discourse takes many shapes, from the basic catalogue that centers on verbal descriptions or illustrations of objects listed as "pot- tery," "libation vessel," "stone mace," etc.,2 to arguments derived from the analysis of this material, to complex meta- discourses (for example, discussions of the origins of socio- economic inequality) that is only indirectly connected to such descriptive labor. If we as archaeologists wish to be reflexive about the kinds of categories they use and the ways they produce them, we need to take into account three sets of relations that structure archaeological discourse: - present archaeological categories are set in relation to a past material world; - categories were also created by people in the past, in a relationship to what they perceived as their real world; - (present) archaeological categorizations stand in relation to those of past peoples. In our view, it is crucial for archaeologists to become aware of the consequences that result from the incongruity of the cat- egories we develop with those of the world we research. In case of such incompatibilities, we need to perform a difficult thought process that involves merging our categories, to "ambiguate"3 our own knowledge and interpretive predispositions. As archaeologists in the field, we are regularly confronted with a large number of objects which we deal with in highly routinized ways. We find ourselves in a tension between the need for rapid classification during excavations and a sense that we are dealing with material remains that constitute a woefully underdetermined resource for the interpretation of contingent past actions. The most basic distinction is between old and new. This differentiation is by no means as simple or trivial as it may at first appear. An old zambileh from a Syrian village, a card- board box with the imprint of a brand of Iraqi cigarettes that no longer exists, or the château at Susa can all be viewed as objects or structures that contain an aura of the antique, rather than merely as tools for processing or storing "truly" old objects and features. On a purely phenomenological level, means and objects of archaeological production blend together, with little difference between the possible uses of an ancient container and a more recent one. However, we are habituated into prac- tices that enhance the chronological boundary between old and new and thereby submerge the potential to blur these distinc- tions. Objects from the last hundred years are considered means of labor in a momentary present, part of a material world that is there to facilitate the goals of archaeology. This present is necessarily a fictionalized one, as it extracts a slice of time and declares it distinct from the past. The objects of archaeological studies, the goals of our work, are conceptualized as an equally fictionalized state of "pastness" in which all material remains from a site or region are treated similarly, whether they date to 8000 ВСЕ or 200 CE.4 N. Abu el-Haj has produced a lucid, science studies- based approach to archaeological research in Israel, in which she shows the mutually reinforcing relationship between an archaeological discourse driven by a desire for past national grandeur and archaeological praxis: "the earth has to be carved up in particular ways in order for the objects of archaeology to become visible."5 The "particular ways" to which she refers are monumentality, architecture, and a landscape that is able to convey a religious aura to visitors. Specific techniques of carving up also necessitate a particular set of tools and embod- ied practices. Together they are likely to reconfirm the main parameters of prevailing interpretive discourses. Abu el-Haj argues that there is a correlation between a search for monu- mentality and what one could call monumental tools, such as machinery for mechanical soil removal, big picks, or shovels. They all require a specific way of using one's body in explor- ing the ground, and they produce fundamentally different hab- its of labor than the uses of trowels and dentists' tools. Such embodied excavation practices have, in turn, an influence on what is found and what is overlooked and hence on discursive constructions of the past. 1. There have, of course, been debates about classification in archaeology. They mostly focus on the scientific, objectivist character of this practice rather than on its cultural aspects. Perhaps best known in the English language literature is the Ford-Spaulding debate (FORD, 1952 and 1954; SPAULDING, 1953 and 1954). These discussions typically flare up for a period of time, after which classificatory work continues with little explicit reflection on how or why it is performed. Examples of science studies approaches to archaeology can be found in EDGEWORTH, 2006. 2. BERNBECK, in press. 3. BATTAGLIA, 1997. 4. On the level of objects, this is what J. Fabian (1983) calls a "denial of coevalness." Ancient things exist in the present, not just as past objects or as fetishized elements of an "object biography" (e.g., HOLTORF, 2002; MESKELL, 2004). The sharp divide of objects "then" and "now" has con- sequences for our reconstructions of the past that need further elucida- tion. 5. Abu el-Haj, 2001: 131. Paléorient, vol. 36.1, p. 37-47 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2010</page><page sequence="3">An Archaeology of Categorization and Categories in Archaeology 39 This is not the only form of categorization that is practiced "at the trowel's edge." Features, their boundaries, and their absences are all continually defined in the process of excavat- ing. Objects such as bones, pottery sherds, and lithics may be categorized as mass finds and set apart from metal objects, cuneiform tablets, or figurines that are typically described individually. As M. Shanks and R. McGuire argue, excavation practices have been streamlined in an almost industrial way, in order to save time during the processing and interpretation of finds.6 Digitalization and "drop-down" menus in databases with an a priori fixed set of options have only enhanced this tendency. "Re-cognition" by sorting of artifacts and features into ready-made, abstract categories replaces "inquiry," a search for that which may yet be unknown. The imbalance that results from archaeological practices geared toward finding what is similar to what has already been found rather than the different and unexpected subjectivizes us into a professional attitude of taking into account what we already know and dis- counting the unexpected.7 Archaeological contexts do not fit into neat classificatory boxes; they only do so through the establishment of documen- tary routines. Historical contingency is usually at the losing end: the institutional apparatus of a university, cultural heri- tage office, or funding agency requires production of a past that is accountable and recognizable, one that is based on an explicit and easily duplicated system of classification. Classifi- catory operations depend on a complex mix of sensually based observations, functional assumptions, and discursive routines. For example, a principal axis of archaeological categorization rests on types of materials, such as bone, stone, and metal, which can be further subdivided into chert and basalt, bronze and iron. Ordering artifacts according to functional assump- tions is often subordinated to sensually based classifications. This logic is most evident in the classification of "small finds." Traditional site publications tend to divide them by material {e.g., metal objects, baked clay items) rather than by assumed function. There are important exceptions, however, such as tablets or sculpture, where the presumed function is thought to be of primary relevance. The implications of dif- ferent hierarchies of classification remain largely unexplored, as well as the category of "small finds" itself, which is used only in some archaeological traditions, especially European ones. On a different level, the concept of contextuality - prop- agated as a core notion of archaeological knowledge pro- duction8 - has led to a strict separation into movable versus immovable materiality. Architecture, tannurs, wall paintings, and terrazzo floors are categorized as features, whereas pot- tery, metal pins, flint blades, and clay tablets are treated as mobile finds. This division is based on the intuitive assump- tion that some things were moved around in the past, whereas others were constructed to serve as a sort of material back- ground to social life.9 Making such a division may be thought of as reproducing a categorization of past materiality that corresponds to past people's realities. But its element of arbi- trariness becomes evident when we take into account that archaeologists themselves have not always conceptualized the movable/immovable divide in the same way. The Berlin Per- gamon Museum is an extreme example of what results when excavators understand "(re)movability" as having virtually no limits.10 A. Leroi-Gourhan's excavations at Pincevent, with its focus on the method of décapage , is situated at the opposite end of the spectrum, where even the smallest piece of lithic debitage becomes a temporarily "immovable" part of a feature, in this case a use-surface at a site.11 These examples of divisions between present means and past objects of archaeological labor, between discourse and practices, between routinized excavation practices and the unexpected, between movable and immovable things provide the deep structure for all further archaeological sorting and Sinnproduktion ("production of meaning"). Most discourses on typological theory that try to objectivize cognitive pro- cesses of classification by rendering them explicit, quantified, and thus potentially falsifiable12 do not touch these deeper structures. In addition, these discussions consider irrelevant the ways in which people in the past categorized their world or at least consider them subsidiary to the goals of an analyti- cal, archaeological classification. The idea that archaeologi- cal categorizations are cultural practices and not scientifically objective processes seems obvious, but this "obviousness" is itself a factor that tends to suppress reflexivity. 6.

BERNBECK THE RELATIONALITY OF CATEGORIZATION IN ARCHAEOLOGY Archaeology produces its object - past ways of life - through practices of categorization. People in the past, how- ever, lived with and in their own categorizing practices. Any attempt to conduct an archaeology that is more than a time- space grid of past materials and installations must somehow seek to include internal, subjective positions in the past.13 We cannot, however, approach past categorizations as if they were a stable object of research. Instead, people always merged and dissected their world according to their specific subjectivities, which were in turn bound up in traditions as well as in histori- cally contingent change. On the whole, archaeological research tends toward devel- oping ever smaller categories with which to reconstruct the past. This tendency is based on the general recognition that our means of unraveling the past are crude at best. Our clas- sifications likely represent much coarser categorizations than those of their producers and users. But present/past differences are not a simple matter of "granularity." Rather, our catego- ries also run the risk of being incongruent with past classifica- tions, by cutting up the world in ways that do not represent the interests of people in the past. An archaeology that even remotely attempts to approach understandings of past ways of life is not dependent on a complete recovery of past categoriza- tions. However, a condition sine qua non is that the categories mobilized for an interpretation do not run counter to those of the past. Otherwise, we fall prey to what P. Bourdieu calls a scholastic fallacy.14 THE HALAF PERIOD AND RESEARCH AT FISTIKLI HÖYÜK We turn now to a discussion of the Halaf period to illustrate some of these issues of categorization. Like most archaeologi- cally defined entities, the Halaf period is generally characterized by a list of diagnostic attributes that are themselves comprised of categories of objects and features. These include specific pottery shapes (e.g., "cream bowls") and painted motifs (e.g., "bucrania") as well as the round buildings dubbed tholoi and seals that usually bear geometric designs. The same material is sometimes further divided regionally or chronologically; for example, the "dancing ladies" motif on painted pottery typifies a transitional Halaf phase, the so-called "violin-case" version of bucrania the Late Halaf period, and polychrome decoration the late sub-periods in eastern Halaf regions. These kinds of distinctions have a number of implications for the forms of archaeological classification. "Halaf' is defined as a distinct, neatly bounded "period" (or "culture," "society," "tradition"), characterized by certain constant features, or it may be divided into distinct sub-periods and/or regions, each of which is also defined by its own set of diagnostic attributes. Within each of these entities, material culture - and its associated practices and activities - is presumed to be static, with a sudden shift when one crosses a temporal or spatial boundary.15 Archaeological discourse in recent years has moved toward a greater recognition of the artificiality of these kinds of constructs,16 in which life in the past is perceived as largely static, punctuated by the occasional change in material culture (first and foremost in pottery styles, but preferably accompa- nied by simultaneous changes in other forms of material cul- ture). Nonetheless, that recognition has led to little change in actual practices of categorizing archaeological materials. The effect is to perpetuate an understanding of the past in which the actions of past people do not really matter. Changes between temporally and spatially bounded entities appear to fall from the sky, and people in the past are supposed to have perceived their world fundamentally similarly to archaeologists in the present. To explore the implications of these simplifications more concretely, we turn to our project at Fistikli Höyük. EXCAVATION AND PRACTICES OF CATEGORIZATION AT FISTIKLI HÖYÜK From 1998 to 2000 we conducted excavations at the small Early Halaf-period site of Fistikli Höyük in the Euphrates Val- ley of Southeastern Turkey, under the auspices of the Carchem- ish Dam salvage project.17 In addition to our knowledge of Halaf materials from the published literature, our previous work on Halaf levels at Kazane Höyük, approximately 80 km to 13. This leads immediately to the problem that we cannot assume a single viewpoint or subject within any specific past context. We may have become used to thinking about identities, such as those of gender, age, or class, but we do not necessarily think through the implications of these variable subject positions for practices of archaeological classification. 14.

To use R. Koselleck's terms,21 our horizon of expectations, built as it was on prior practical experience at another site, was overly narrow. Activities were pre-structured by a daily routine of excavations at the site in the morning, a "shaping of earth" and discovery of various contexts from which we retrieved objects that we were able to recognize based on previous excavations. In the afternoon, these pre-recognized categories were arranged into smaller classes of items, be they pottery wares, shapes and decorations, lithic debitage and tools, or other objects. Gradu- ally, however, we began to realize that we were not recognizing entire classes of items that were crucial for an understanding of past people's lives at Fistikli Höyük. Interestingly, this recog- nition occurred principally on the excavation rather than in the afternoon sessions in which we recorded artifacts. In Kazane we had recovered sherds that were worked into a round shape and that appeared to come in a series of relatively standardized sizes. We dubbed these jetons as an indication of their possible mnemonic functions.22 We were on the look- out for similar artifacts at Fistikli Höyük, and indeed "worked sherds" is a relatively standard category of small finds in many Halaf reports.23 Not surprisingly, we quickly identified sherd jetons at Fistikli Höyük. What we did not immediately rec- ognize were the far more numerous "stone" examples, also present in consistent sizes and shapes. What prevented us from recognizing these as artifacts - until one day several exam- ples of a very consistent size were recovered from a single excavated locus - was the fact that they were unworked disk- shaped pebbles, no different from others that can still be col- lected today along the Euphrates River banks. In conventional archaeological parlance, they are "ecofacts" and are thereby relegated to a status distinct from the artifacts to which we normally devote our primary attention. As a result they are usually excluded from the classifiable archaeological universe and therefore discarded. Nonetheless, as S.K. Costello has argued in her work, ceramic and stone jetons both appear to have been used as a form of memory tool in Halaf times.24 The widespread, albeit often underreported, occurrence of ceramic jetons at other Halaf period sites now leads us to suppose that stone jetons may have been present at other sites as well, likely including Kazane, but not recognized as such and therefore simply discarded as "naturally occurring" pebbles of no par- ticular archaeological relevance. Stone jetons were not the only objects that we did not immediately identify. Pieces of relatively soft calcareous stone, derived from the limestone bluffs at a short distance to the east of the site, were initially discarded as another form of "natu- ral" material. We did not realize at first that this material was extraneous to the underlying sterile soil of the natural small rise on which the Fistikli Höyük settlement was founded. We were therefore not able to ask why the Halaf period inhabit- ants had transported these objects to the site. This state of non- perception prevailed until the day when one of the excavators noticed that one of the larger flat pieces was not only round but apparently had been chipped into that shape. Once we looked more closely, it became apparent that there were many differ- ent shapes, sizes, and kinds of calcareous artifacts, from the round, disc-shaped examples that we dubbed "plates" to a vari- ety of other, mostly irregular shapes. In hindsight, we think that most of the calcareous stones should have been treated like a chert industry. The entire collection could have been analyzed in the fashion of a chaîne opératoire with a multiple- stage reduction sequence. Instead, we only collected the more standardized forms that showed clear evidence of having been worked. These are mainly disk-shaped "plates" that occur in a variety of sizes and not infrequently bear traces of heating on one or both surfaces; in at least one case, they were found in close association with a fire installation.25 In addition to objects made using a subtractive technology, there were also a number of fragile pieces shaped out of calcareous paste.26 As we became more critical of our own a priori catego- ries, our general horizon of expectations about the differ- ence between collectible "artifacts" and a sort of background 18. Bernbeck et al ., 1999. 19. At Kazane Höyük we had also developed recording sheets prior to the start of excavations. These were based on archaeological work we had conducted on sites of other time periods in Iraq and Jordan as well as on published Halaf excavation reports. 20.

EGER). material noise began to change, and we started finding a vari- ety of other kinds of naturally occurring stones that must have been introduced to the site by the Fistikli Höyük inhabitants. Unmodified river stones in a variety of colors and shapes and often bearing no signs of usewear were brought to the site, perhaps because of their aesthetic qualities rather than for any utilitarian purpose.27 Among those qualities certain colors but especially also degrees of luminosity seem to have been important in selecting particular stones.28 The ancient inhabit- ants also collected pieces of conglomerate, probably from the river as well. A systematic sampling of bits of burnt clay recov- ered from dry and wet screening showed that not only could tokens be identified but also impressions of textiles and numer- ous other fragments that belonged to larger, unreconstructible shapes.29 All of these examples point to ways in which our stan- dard, taken-for-granted categorizations of material remains served to reproduce an existing way of thinking about the past and exclude other possibilities. Once we began to reflect on the potentiality that Halaf inhabitants of Fistikli Höyük 27. Bernbeck et al ., 2003: 61. 28. JOB, 2009. 29. Cf. Gleba in : Bernbeck et al ., 2003: 57-59. may have chosen to bring back to their village certain kinds of stones because of their pleasing shapes, colors, or textures, that they may have preferred to rework broken items into new ones (ceramic jetons) and to use locally ubiquitous - but to an archaeological mind unconventional - materials (soft calcare- ous stone) for a variety of tools and objects, or even make use of the fragments they had collected without further reshaping, we came to see the world of the Fistikli Höyük villagers in new ways. HALAF CATEGORIES Rather than discrete spheres of production, consumption, and disposal or strict divisions between culture and nature, not to speak of the specific archaeological categories we had devised, Halaf residents may have categorized their world in ways quite different from our own. We cannot, of course, know with any degree of specificity what kinds of classifications Halaf people living at Fistikli Höyük created. Categorization is both a discursive, continuously renegotiated process and one that works on the level of practical consciousness, where rou- tinized actions are manifested materially. Our sources for the Halaf period only allow us access to the latter. Nonetheless, by Paléorient, vol. 36.1, p. 37-47 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2010</page><page sequence="7">An Archaeology of Categorization and Categories in Archaeology 43 trying to shed some of the blinkers that predispose us to per- ceive material remains in pre-structured categories deriving from our own world, we can open the door to some of the pos- sible differences between their forms of classification and ours. We discuss here two possibilities, diachronic and synchronic ambiguation, based on reflections on our work at Fistikh Höyiik. The first of these refers to materials that cross the boundar- ies - those that we are accustomed to setting - in a diachronic fashion. Pots are not always only containers; their broken pieces might be turned into jetons, scrapers with chipped edges, spin- dle whorls or pendants.30 Suitable size pieces of locally avail- able calcareous stone were chipped into plate-like objects, some of which might later turn into door sockets. Old, worn grinding stones became foundation stones for a new building.31 In each of these cases processes of recycling and reuse turned specific objects into very different kinds of things, thereby reducing the need to acquire entirely new materials or produce new items specifically for the purpose. In these cases, static archaeologi- cal categories (e.g., pottery vessel, jeton, door socket) fail to capture the "biographies" of these objects and the implications of their changing forms for procurement, production and use as well as for a worldview that may have classified these mate- rials quite differently.32 Another form of diachronic change that cross-cuts (our) boundaries is evident at the level of the site as a whole. As discussed in greater detail by R. Bernbeck, the natural rise that later became the Halaf settlement of Fistikh Höyiik was first used by a small group of people who camped there, probably briefly, while carrying out other activities.33 Subsequently, a storage building was constructed, probably to hold crops cul- tivated on the rich river floodplain or other materials collected in the vicinity, as well as an earthen embankment that may have protected the building from floodwaters. Shortly there- after the site seems to have been deemed suitable for more substantial settlement, and the first residential buildings were constructed along with additional storage buildings. A genera- tion or two later, the site began to be abandoned as gradually as it was initially settled. The settlement history of Fistikh Höyük can be understood as part of a cyclical pattern forming Fig. 2 - Photograph of one of the sherds with the " bird-person " (Unit D, Locus 100). Scale is in cm (photograph by S. POLLOCK). a component of a "multi-sited community."34 This entire sequence - of initial use of the site, longer-term settlement, growth, and abandonment - seems to have taken place over the course of little more than a century, suggesting that mobil- ity and change were an integral part of residents' lives.35 In such a case, the classical form of settlement pattern analysis that categorizes sites by size and "periods" in which they were occupied reduces a complex web of mobilities to a static struc- ture corresponding to an unrealistically rigid "archaeo-logic" of time-space dynamics. A second way in which inhabitants at Fistikh Höyük "ambiguated" boundaries is synchronic. In contrast to our ten- dency to sharply segregate nature from culture, for example in the distinction between ecofacts (nature) and artifacts (culture), the Halaf inhabitants of Fistikh Höyük seem rather to have blurred this division. Aesthetically pleasing river pebbles were collected for no apparent utilitarian purpose and brought to the site in substantial numbers, where they remained unmodified in their "natural" form. They were nonetheless the products of a culturally influenced process of selection; a large proportion of memory tools, or mnemonic devices also consisted of care- fully chosen but unworked river stones. A subset of the river pebbles exhibits traces of having been used in a spontaneous and expedient way. Their use can often be discerned by trying 30. BERNBECK et al., 2003: 51-52 and 65-67. 31. Ibid., 2003: 64; FEKETE, 2010. 32. The notion of "object biographies" (KOPYTOFF, 1986) may also miss the point, because it assumes that the original product forms its essence. For instance, a pottery vessel is somehow present in the sherd jeton, as both are presumed to belong together; one is a transmutation of the other. An interpretation in the vein of an object biography is equivalent to univer- salizing a specific kind of essentialism. 33. BERNBECK, 2008b. 34. Ibid., 2008b. 35.

BERNBECK out how they would fit in one's hand and then searching for traces of pecking, rubbing or hammering. Figurai representations on vessels show a merging of humans and animals. Two sherds, likely from the same ves- sel, include painted images of anthropomorphic figures with bird-like feathered arms; above one of them, a design may rep- resent the claws of a bird (figs. 1-2). When confronted with such images, we may typically think of persons dressed up to represent birds, but it is quite possible that for Halafians they were rather "bird-persons," a different kind of being that tran- scended or "ambiguated" the boundary between human and bird. If so, the "bird-people" would not have been perceived like actors in a theater, human subjects in a temporarily differ- ent guise. Rather, perceptions of them would have been akin to metamorphosis, a change in substance that also adds new kinds of agency to such subjects. Another case of Halafian ambiguity is evident in the mul- tiple forms of bucrania on painted pottery. They vary from quite naturalistic representations to highly stylized examples. M. Mallowan's original attempt to seriate these representations by assuming a standard art historically based tendency from naturalistic to abstract is in need of revision.36 It does not seem that there is a clear chronological tendency that would sup- port his argument. It is likely even wrong to assume a simple relation of representation where real bulls' horns serve as the "original" and bucrania as their representation. The designs may just be a floating series of graphic manifestations without a stable referent, producing a relation that M. Foucault referred to as "similitude." If so, the strict boundaries between form and content, so typical for the representational world of semio- sis, would also have been fuzzy. Another synchronous blurring of boundaries is evident in the relative absence of distinction between trash and materials in contexts of use. Indoor surfaces were kept largely free of arti- facts, ash, or other matter. However, at Fistikli Höyük as at most Halaf period sites, middens or other designated areas for the dis- posal of trash are rare. Instead, rubbish was commonly left to accumulate on outdoor surfaces that continued to be used for a variety of activities.37 Apparently the strict separation we tend to make between garbage and usable things was perceived differ- ently in Halaf times. On the other hand, Fistikli Höyük contains a location for some material that was apparently considered to be garbage, in the form of a midden on the western edge of the site. Our analyses are not yet complete, and at present we can- not identify the differences between the "garbage" on surfaces and that in the midden. Here we are faced not with a relation of "ambiguation," in which categories used in the past represent a merging of ours, but rather its opposite, a differentiation in the past compared to our analytical apparatus in the present. The practice of painting pottery also exhibits a different set of relationships between finished product and the process of production than that which is evident in many other Late Neo- lithic painted pottery traditions. As A.G. Castro Gessner illus- trates in her detailed analysis of painted pottery from Fistikli Höyük, similar motifs were executed in a remarkably varied set of ways, with differences in the order of brushstrokes, the way vessels were held while being painted, and in the con- sistency of angles and line widths.38 The structure of painted designs is far less consistent on Halaf pots than on vessels of the earlier Samarran or later Ubaid assemblages.39 These find- ings suggest that the organization and structuring of pottery painting as well as the processes of learning to paint pots were quite open and flexible in Halaf times in contrast to some other pottery traditions.40 The production of lithics exhibits a general habitus, that of an expedient, spontaneous production for specific uses, that is similar to that of the calcareous chipped items. M.T. Starzmann calls this a situational technology that does not involve much planning and that leads to a well developed capacity to adjust to starkly varying contexts of action.41 Finally, we might return to the history of settlement at Fistikli Höyük. As archaeologists who excavated at that site, our perspective is centered on that particular settlement, the people who lived there, and the things they made, used, and left behind. They themselves, however, had a larger field of interaction, from other members of their multi-sited commu- nity42 to people in neighboring communities as well as those in more distant locations with whom they had infrequent or perhaps only indirect contact. By drawing on a single slice of those webs of interactions, in the form of a single site, we end up with a much more restricted view of the social life of the inhabitants of Fistikli Höyük than people at the time experienced.43 In summary, we might say that Halaf period Fistikli Höyük exhibited a deeply "ambiguating" way of life. Rather than clear boundaries between types of material, periods of stasis and change, nature and culture, or form and content, we can infer 36. MALLOWAN and ROSE, 1935: 154-163. 37.

These reflections push us to reconsider archaeological classifications and the ways in which they shape, constrain, and enable our understanding of the past. CONCLUSION None of us can do without categories and classifications. In writing this paper we bump up continuously against the problem of using the term "Halaf" as if it corresponded to a distinct, definable whole, whereas it has, as does any archaeo- logical tradition, fluid and fuzzy borders at best. The problem is that as archaeologists we write history by "first" classifying objects and "then" synthesizing the results of (often quanti- fied) categories by setting them in relation to each other as (immutable) assemblages. Working in this way leads to a vicious circle that "dehistori- cizes" the praxis of archaeology itself: we "find things," rather than "exploring lifeworlds." When we produce routines for organizing the past into predefined categories, we also uninten- tionally reduce our horizon of expectations about what we may find in the future. "Exploration" characterizes an open archae- ological praxis, "finding" a closed one. As archaeologists, we find ourselves situated between these poles of exploration and finding, but in an increasingly instrumentalized professional culture, we are constantly pushed toward the latter side. This leads to an archaeological habitus that reconfirms rather than questions already defined categories. In the process, our own horizon of expectations decreases even further, and archaeol- ogy risks devolving into a routinized industry. Procedures of excavation and analysis become more and more immutable. We forget that this attempt to reduce awareness of our situatedness within the contingencies of history restricts our abilities to dis- cover past historical contingency as well. Only by recognizing the likelihood that past and present worlds are incompatible and by exploring this possibility "at the trowel's edge" can we escape the danger of restricting past social dynamics through misguided attempts to streamline our work. The consequences for an archaeology that investigates the "dark ages"44 between the Neolithic and urban "revolu- tions" are potentially wide-ranging. The Childean narrative and periodization of successive static stages, which still frame our understanding of the Prehistory of Western Asia, have led to attempts to classify not just material remains, but whole "cultures" in terms of political stages, such as simple or com- plex chiefdoms and/or economic categories. But even within the Halaf period, we might expect locally and/or regionally specific ways of perceiving the world and therefore of acting within it. The metaphor of a complex web of dialects may prove a useful stimulus to our archaeological imagination in this regard. The Halafian tradition at Fistikli Höyük hints strongly at high levels of spontaneity, flexibility and ambiguity. These conditions of life, apparent in the material record, likely cre- ated local Halafian subjectivities that displayed a capacity for improvisation unknown to us and a greater tolerance for unpre- dictability. Only with further studies of a similar kind that aim at investigating locally specific processes of subjectivation can we come closer to writing a social history of the Halaf period.
