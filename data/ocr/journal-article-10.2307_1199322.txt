<plain_text><page sequence="1">IF GOD WERE ETERNAL LAURENCE J. LAFLEUR T HE modern world has been much concerned, too much concerned, with avoiding the pit of anthropomorphism. From the weakness of the primitive tendency to pic- ture God as a human being, neither better nor worse, nor much cleverer nor much stronger than men, we have turned to the idea of God as perfection, a Deity who is related to all men, to all living things, and to the whole universe in its infinite extent and duration. That this evolution in our theological conceptions represents an improvement is not to be denied, yet there are dangers even in the modern interpretation: The swing from anthropomorphism may perhaps go too far if it makes us so in- terpret God that he is no longer a living being nor of significance to man. When God becomes nature, becomes a principle such as the principle of gravitation, he loses all religious significance and there is no reason whatsoever why we should use the word "God" rather than such a word as "gravity" to describe him. And, similarly, qualitative extension of God's nature may reach a point where practical meaning disappears. I In particular the significance of God is in danger of being lost when he is described as eternal; eternal, that is, in the sense of the word which differentiates it from mere persistence. In this sense the past and future are supposed to be coexistent for God with the present, so that the infinite extension of past, present, and future appears to God as the present appears to man. Not that God is in the present, any more than he is in the past or future. He is not, in fact, in time at all; he must be pic- tured as standing outside of time and contemplating its whole duration just as man might contemplate the finite spacial ex- 382</page><page sequence="2">IF GOD WERE ETERNAL tension of a yardstick, each end being coexistent with the mid- dle. Such a view obviously implies that God does not act tem- porally-in fact, that he must do nothing at all-a view which may also be supported by the argument that if God is perfect there is no reason why he should change. In any case, if God is to act at all he must do so in another dimension than those open to human action. We must grant God, in his contemplation of our four-dimensional space-time universe, an extra dimension in which to create universes and perform any other acts appro- priate to God. The relationships of such a God to man are so limited as to indicate the theologically unsatisfactory nature of the doctrine. Its limitations, however, are more easily pointed out by analogy than directly. Let us, therefore, postpone the consideration of our relations with a superhuman being and treat instead the relations of a fictitious infrahuman being to ourselves. Here is a wooden cube. The upper surface of it is an object which we shall call "Flatland," a universe in which two-dimensional ob- jects live. The shapes of these objects are round and square and triangular; some of them may even be pictured as points; but none of them have thickness. If a Flatland creature moves, his position after the motion would be represented by the same plane with the flat creature in a new position. Thus, by super- imposing each succeeding state of Flatland upon the earlier state, we achieve a three-dimensional object-this cube in fact -which represents not merely the existence of Flatland at any moment but the whole temporal history of Flatland. If we take, for example, a grain in the wood as representing a Flatlander, this being comes into existence at the base of the cube, continues to exist until the top, and between those two points may wave to and fro, and grow larger or smaller, as the position and size of the grain varies from bottom to top. The vertical dimension of the cube is thus Flatland time and may be measured by us in inches, so that the life of Flatland is six inches just as its spacial dimensions are six inches in each of the two spacial directions. 383</page><page sequence="3">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION To a Flatlander, of course, the vertical dimension would appear so different from the other two that he would measure along that dimension in different terms from those used otherwise. He might, for example, measure horizontal distance in inches but vertical distance in minutes. The top of the cube is obvi- ously the date of the destruction of Flatland, while its base is the date of its creation. Thus the wooden cube before us, though an unchanging object, represents a world of change and, though it exists as an instantaneous presentation in our time, has a du- ration of six inches in Flatland time. As the three-dimensional object is to be fixed and unchanging, we may say, for greater precision, that the universe of Flatland is this cube existing at this particular time, say twelve noon, May I, I940. Now in this analogy certain rather startling facts are evi- dent. First of all, no event in Flatland can affect us. An event in Flatland, that is, a change to the Flatlander, would be repre- sented by an angle in the direction of the grain of the wood at a point, say, four inches from the base of the cube. A more start- ling event is the complete destruction of Flatland at six inches from the base. But the peculiarities of an instantaneous cube mean nothing to us and could not be seen by us did not the cube endure in our time. The discontinuity in the instantaneous grain is not an event that occurs in our lives, though of course the discovery of the characteristics of the persistent cube may be such an event. If we suppose that the Flatlander, in ap- proaching the top of the cube, attains some premonition of im- pending doom, that premonition cannot affect human beings, cannot arouse our sympathies. Furthermore, if it did arouse our sympathy, there is nothing that we could do about it; for anything that we could do is an event in our time, not in Flat- land time: When Flatland comes into existence at twelve noon on May i, it is already out of existence. So if we decided to pro- long the life of Flatlanders by extending the cube upwards, we could only do it at the now present, that is, at some date later than May I; and in so extending the cube we would create a new 384</page><page sequence="4">IF GOD WERE ETERNAL Flatland, a longer Flatland, but a Flatland that has no connec- tion with that of noon on the first day of May. In virtue of our ability to construct three-dimensional objects, we are indeed creators of many Flatlands, but we are able to change none of them. It is interesting to consider that a Flatlander might argue that since every upper point is caused by a lower point, and all events are ultimately caused by the base, the base itself must have as a cause something still lower, which the Flatlander must picture, of course, as an entity below the base of the cube on noon May i and not as an entity existing in April. If, fur- thermore, we grant to the Flatlander the ability to see human beings and recognize them as super-Flatlanders, they would see no motion, but merely a frozen image of our position at noon precisely. To the Flatlander possessing this vision, human feet would be interpreted as the cause of human knees, human necks the cause of human heads, and the possibility of our acting by motion in our time would be beyond the Flatlander's powers of conception. Now let us follow through the analogy. If similarly there ex- ists an eternal God who conceives the whole universe as one present, then nothing that we do can influence God. God has always been aware of every event in this universe, so that no event is new to God, no earthly event an event in the divine life. Human prayer is necessarily ineffectual, since God has al- ways known of it and has already created the universe of which that prayer is part. Similarly God cannot influence us: he can no more change our future than our past, since the creation of both was simultaneous to God. At the time our past existed, our future was entirely definite and changelessly established in the mind of God. God could, of course, assuming that he has an extra dimension of temporal activity, create a new universe in which the faults of the present one are avoided, but that would be a wholly different universe and of no importance to us. If we argue that God created the universe, our conclusion 385</page><page sequence="5">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION may be correct in some abstract sense, but is wholly wrong if it is assumed that God existed before us in our time. God no more existed before human beings than do human beings exist below this cube. As human beings are related to the cube in a dimen- sion wholly unknown to the Flatlanders, so an eternal God would be related to this universe only in a dimension wholly un- known to us. And finally, if we could see God, we would picture the God of 900o causing or being prior to the God of I940, whereas to the eternal God these two states would be parts of the same entity, having no more sequential order than human feet and knees have. II In order further to clarify the relationship to us of a being outside the time of our universe, let us consider our relationship with Shakespeare's play, Romeo and Juliet; or, rather, let us consider in particular the relationship of Romeo to Shakespeare. Romeo is a romantically inclined person with a full apprecia- tion of the desirable things of life and with considerable aware- ness of the possibilities of evil. He is acutely concerned with the task of obtaining the one and avoiding the other. Yet what- ever straits he may be in, whatever heartache he encounter, he cannot pray to Shakespeare to turn aside the fate in store for him, cannot refuse to act as Shakespeare determined, cannot rebel against Shakespeare. Of course we do know one or two literary works where the characters are made to do these things: Unamuno and Pirandello have each written stories where the characters are given a fictitious independence of the author. But in each case the relationship between character and author de- scribed is one within the story, not outside of it: "Unamuno" becomes a character in the story by Unamuno and is to be clear- ly distinguished from the latter; the character called "the Au- thor" is never the author. But even if Romeo were able to appeal to Shakespeare, Shakespeare would be unable to answer Romeo's plea. The story of Romeo and Juliet is complete; it exists as a whole. And 386</page><page sequence="6">IF GOD WERE ETERNAL whereas we might have a revision of the story, for presentation to children, in which Romeo and Juliet did not die, but success- fully eluded the restraints of the situation to live happily ever after, such a revision would be a new story, not the escape of the old characters from an impending doom. Romeo no doubt be- lieves in a world of human beings, of which he is a member, and that he was born some time around the year 1285 in the Italian city of Verona. He might conclude that his world was created by a superhuman individual whom he might call, for conven- ience, Shakespeare, and would conclude that Shakespeare must have created his Veronese world sometime prior to the year 1285. The real Shakespeare, of course, was not living at that time, and did not compose Romeo and Juliet until approximate- ly I591. The whole time sequence in which Romeo lives, from I285 to I303, is a fictitious time created by Shakespeare, al- though in imitation of a chronological sequence in real time. Shakespeare had no existence in that fictitious sequence; and therefore, in Romeo's time, Shakespeare did not exist before I285, or after I303, or contemporaneously with Romeo. Shake- speare's life is in a different sequence altogether. Similarly, God, like Shakespeare, may have made many stories, each one a universe. But, if he made this one in his qual- ity of eternal being he made the whole time sequence discover- able in this universe-whether it is finite or infinite-and he created the future as well as the past, as directly as the past, and as fully determined as the past. Hence the conclusions we de- rive concerning the relations of Romeo to Shakespeare apply to those between man and an eternal God. We could not commu- nicate with a God of this type or affect him in any way; he could not alter the conditions of our being or affect our "futures"; and we must conclude that the eternal God did not exist in our past, does not exist in our present, and will not exist in our future. Now I do not wish to argue that an eternal God could not possibly exist in connection with our universe, but I do main- tain that such a God will have comparatively little intellectual 387</page><page sequence="7">THE JOURNAL OF RELIGION significance and no religious significance whatsoever. In order to have a God toward whom some religious feeling is appropriate, whose existence would have some bearing upon human emo- tions and human behavior, we must have a God whose nature is sufficiently limited that he comes, to some extent at least, with- in our field of comprehension, so that interaction between God and man is possible. This means that a theologically adequate God cannot be eternal in the special sense of that term here used. God in any case would be pictured as undying, as existing infinitely in future time and probably as existing infinitely in past time. But for him as well as for us, past must be differenti- ated from present and present from future. God may be granted a complete knowledge of the present, he may be omnipresent and omniscient within the field of existing things. He may be granted, as well, a complete knowledge of the past. But God's knowledge of the present must be to some extent unlike God's knowledge of the past, since God must be granted the ability to act in the present in any way conceivable but not to act in the past in any way in which such action did not actually take place. Furthermore, both past and present must be completely differentiated from the future. God must be ignorant of the future; not absolutely ignorant of course, since he would have a knowledge of all causes producing the future with the possible exception of human free will and would be able to express the probability of future events in a very complete way. But such knowledge is not knowledge of actualities; it is of things that might still be changed by the alteration of God's will if not of man's. It is like a law to which the signature is lacking, a dic- tate to which the fiat has not been set. Such an everlasting God, as distinct from the eternal, is to some extent within the comprehension of human beings. Con- ceiving of God as within the dimension of time, in somewhat the same sense as human beings are, makes unnecessary our ascrib- ing to him the disabilities of incomprehensibility and temporal impotence. It is possible on this scheme for man to comprehend 388</page><page sequence="8">IF GOD WERE ETERNAL 389 not merely God's interaction with man but any action whatso- ever on the part of God. For the everlasting but not eternal God is changing, not fixed, and therefore may be an active cause within the temporal series of events or in the future history of a human soul. In conclusion we may mention a rather curious inference from the temporal nature of the Deity. Omnipotence and omnis- cience cannot be unconditionally ascribed to God. God's pow- er, whatever other limitations it may or may not have, cannot extend to the past, while God's knowledge cannot extend to the future. Omniscience and omnipotence exist, therefore, with- in temporally distinct fields.</page></plain_text>
