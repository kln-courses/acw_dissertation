<plain_text><page sequence="1">34 THE ART WORLD October 1916 POST-ILLUSIONISM AND ART IN THE INSANE By THEO. B. HYSLOP, M.D., C.M.; F.R.S.Ed. (Late Senior Physician Bethlehem Royal Hospital) Reprint from the "Nineteenth Century and After " OF late we have both seen and heard so much of post-impressionism in art, and there appears to be so much doubt in the public mind as to the real meaning and significance of the works which have been ex hibited and heralded as indicating the approach of a new era in art, that the time seems opportune to discuss the subject of post-illusionism as met with in degeneracy and in the insane. It would be regarded as presumption and as be yond the legitimate province of the writer were he to attempt to criticise the artistic efforts of those who are not in asylums, so the following article will be confined to the consideration of what he has observed with regard to art and degeneration in asylum prac tise. Indeed, the only criticism with regard to post impressionism now offered is quoted from an insane person who informed the writer that, in his opinion, only half of the post-impressionistic pictures re cently exhibited were worthy of Bedlam, the remain der being, to his subtle perception, but evidences of shamming degeneration or malingering. THE IMPORTANCE OF BEING IN EARNEST The insane artist is usually in dead earnest, and beyond what is prompted by his morbid rise in self consciousness, intense egomania, and a desire to ex press or reflect the workings of his disordered mind, there is, as a general rule, no other or ulterior motive to tempt him to distort or misinterpret the evidence of his senses-i. e., he does not seek to deceive the critic or the public; and, although he may be an ego maniac, his artistic efforts are mostly for art's sake alone, and they merely reflect the character of his own imaginings. In dealing with the work of an insane artist the positive manifestations of sensory or motor defects displayed therein do not demand our study as much as does the something, caused by disease, which pre vents the artist from being able to recognize and correct such defects-i. e., our attention is apt to be arrested by faulty delineation, erroneous perspective, and perverted coloring, but these form only positive symptoms of decadence, and they do not give us in all cases the measure of the negative lesion which may be due to disease. This holds good not only for the insane artist but also for his critic; and, as we shall see presently, both the insane artist and the borderland critic have certain characteristics which are peculiar to them. Degenerates often turn their unhealthy impulses towards art, and not only do they sometimes attain to an extraordinary degree of prominence but they may also be followed by enthusiastic admirers who herald them as creators of new eras in art. The insane depict in line and color their interpretations of nature, and portray the reflections of their minds, as best they are able. Their efforts are usually not only genuine but there is also no wilful suppression of skill in technique, which, were it otherwise, would brand them as impostors. They do not themselves pose as prophets of new eras, and so long as they are in asylums and recognized as insane, both they and their works are harmless, inasmuch as they do not make any impression on the unprotected borderland dwellers from whose ranks they otherwise might enroll a large following. An art exhibition in an asylum excites as many cries of admiration as of pity, for here we find much to praise and profit by. Seldom is the artistic in stinct or technique so far deteriorated as to leave no sense of beauty in line or color, and, as a point of diagnosis, it is to be noted that, where no feature of beauty or workmanship exists in the work of one who is known to have formerly possessed both artis tic instinct and skill in technique, the defective character of such work is due either to gross cerebral degeneration (such as we find in general paralysis of the insane or in organic dementia) or to impos ture. As a matter of interest, the writer may state that he has never seen such an instance or wilful imposture in art by an insane artist. Degeneracy in art sometimes takes a fairly definite course. A genius who is also a degenerate may in fluence the trend of art. His imitators, with their more limited capacities, form a sub-species, and they in their turn transmit in a continuously increasing degree the peculiarities and abnormalities which be come ultimately merely evidences of gaps in develop ment, malformations, or infirmities. The artistic works of lunatics, however, do not always bear evidence of degeneration. The ideas of the paranoiac (or deluded person) may be gro tesque and fanciful, but the artistic merits shown in his works may be great. Except in conditions of progressive paralytic dementia and of gross cerebral degeneration the evidences of deterioration may be merely manifestations of disordered thought and imagination. All merit is neither obscured nor lost. When, however, no artistic merit is observable to the fully qualified normal critic, it usually means that there never has been any development of the artistic faculty, that the faculty has been lost through dis ease, or that there has been wilful imposture. In some forms of progressive mental and physical degeneration (dementia and general paralysis of the insane) there is usually a retrogression or impair ment of the highest evolved and latest acquirements. This impairment extends gradually back until the degenerative process affects even the most stable of the bodily and mental functions. In general paral ysis the musician loses his power over his fingers, the linguist forgets the languages he has latest acquired, the elocutionist blurs his phrases, and the expert fails in the technique of his handicraft. In artists suffering from general paralysis there is a retrogression, both sensory and motor, of the artis tic faculty. Sensation and perception of color, form, and perspective become impaired. There is also loss of the tactile and of the so-called muscular senses so essential to the proper co-ordination of movement. Not only do they suffer from tremors, but also from failure to co-ordinate the various groups of muscular activities. Hence the executive mechanism becomes</page><page sequence="2">October 1916 THE ART WORLD 35 defective, faulty, and impotent. This gradual retro gression of the mental and physical functions re sults ultimately in a pathological return to the crude and rudimentary conditions of barbarism. In sculpture, as portrayed by the paralytic in his early stages of degeneration, the work may be sen suously charming and excellently executed, and the perfection of its form may cover even what may be suggestively pornographic or even immoral. It may be attractive or repellent according to the mental bent of the critic. When, however, the work is prompted by ideas which are repugnant to good taste, and depicted in all its ugliness by a technique devoid of all artistic merit, and stripped of all evi dences of those finer co-ordinations and adjustments acquired through education and practise, then the predilection in its favor of any critic is open to the charge of dishonesty or degeneracy. The intellectually beautiful, consisting as it does of representations, concepts and judgments, with an accompanying tone of feeling elaborated in the sub conscious, stands above the merely sensuously beau tiful about which there can be but little scope for the higher processes of mentation. Insane esthetics grow enthusiastic over their own creations, which, to the sane, are absurd or even repulsive. The in sane sometimes take glory in the attention they ex cite, and there appears to be no limit to their eccen tricities. So long as they are confined in asylums, however, they do not rank as cranks or charlatans, but as degenerates. They do not voluntarily shun the true and the natural as being incompatible with art. It is by reason of their disease that they ignore all contemporary ideals as to what is beautiful, sig nificant, and worthy to be portrayed, and it is thus that free play is given to the workings of their defective minds, and whereby they evolve their ab surd crudities, stupid distortions of natural objects, and obscure nebulous productions which, being merely reflections of their own diseased brains, bear no resemblance to anything known to the normal senses or intellect. POST-ILLUSIONISM The distorted representations of objects, or par tial displacements of external facts, are known tech nically as "illusions." Their psycho-pathological sig nificance is great, and they may arise in consequence of the fallacy of expectant attention (whereby the image of the expected becomes superimposed on that of the real) through toxic affection of the brain cells (as in alcoholic post-prandial illusionism) or as the result of faulty memory (paramnesia, distorted memory, whereby post-illusionism or false post-im pressionism becomes manifest). Post-maniacal il lusionism is almost invariably distorted, and the faulty representations bear little significance except as manifestations of disease. One psychological (and aesthetical) fact to be noted is that, no matter how whimsical, absurd, perverted, or unreal in its nature or relations an illusion of the senses may be, it can never be constructed from data other than those derived primarily from reality. The trouble does not lie with the varied aspects of nature, which feed the mind through the special senses, but with the dis eased mind which fails to digest the sensory pabulum so derived. Nature itself frequently endeavors to treat such mental dyspeptics by its appeal for a simpler diet, and a taste for the perception of objects devoid of all condiments and the numerous unessen tial attributes of perception acquired by convention ality and civilization. This craving for what is crude and elementary is nevertheless significant of a return to the primitive conditions of children, and sometimes betrays an atavistic trend towards bar barism. Certain of the insane exemplify this tend ency in a marked degree. They lose not only their finer perception of linear dimensions, relative pro portions and planes in perspective, shades of light and effects of atmosphere, but also the power of giving adequate expression to what is actually per ceived. Thus the pathological process underlying reversion to a primitive type of simulation -of bar baric art is frequently characteristic of brain degen eration. The works themselves reveal nature as reflected from distorted mirrors: the mirrors being but the psychical equivalents in consciousness of the morbid activities within the perceptive centers of the brain. Many insane artists do not see nature as do the sane. The soul peeps from its dwelling-place devoid of all the conventionalities and harmonies of line and color, and to the normal individual the result is disconcerting and incongruous. Were it not that the condition is pathological, and that disease pre vents these unfortunates from recognizing things as they really are, we should be tempted to lose our sense of toleration and say to them in parliamentary language "enough of this tomfoolery." The artistic efforts of the insane, even when ata vistic, almost invariably betray some indications either of something lost or of something to be gained-i. e., there is some trace of beauty or of technique left, like the mast to show the wreck. Failure to find any such trace indicates either that the cerebral and mental devolution of the artist is well-nigh complete, or that there is a background of ignorance or deceit. As cerebral degeneration progresses, the artistic representations become so negative in quality that for any person other than the artist himself they have no meaning and arouse no feelings other than those of pity. The works themselves have neither pictorial nor symbolic value, and their defections can be counterbalanced only by the hidden meanings in the minds of the insane artists themselves. Sometimes the works are, in their defective draw ing and awkward stiffness, reminiscent of the old masters; but be it said to the credit of the insane, there is seldom any conscious or voluntary withhold ing of the skill they may have previously acquired. It is, as has been said of the old masters and some modern impressionists, the contrast between the first babbling of a thriving infant and the stammering of a mentally enfeebled gray-beard. This retrogres sion to first beginnings, and the affectation of sim plicity is frequently seen in degenerates, and it has been described by Nordau as "painted driveling or echolalia of the brush." ANALYSTS AND SYNTHESISTS When rightly prescribed, catharsis, purging, or purification of a system may be beneficial; but the love of wholesale depletion or destruction of the products of evolution, without -regard to their</page><page sequence="3">36' THE ART WORLD October 1916 significance in the trend of life, society, and art, is merely evidence of wanton stupidity. When an artist reduces a composite whole to its component parts he becomes, not a synthesist, but an analyst. He leaves the reconstructive process to the imagi nation of the critic. He represents light, not in its composite form as perceived by the normal eye, but as dots, blobs, lines and squares of primary colors, leaving the task of synthesis to the imagination of others. Women take their clothing to pieces with the ob ject of reconstructing the various articles to suit the fashions of the moment. The insane, on the other hand, merely destroy: they do not reconstruct. So it is with some of the degenerate artists who divest themselves of all their acquirements, but are in capable, by reason of disease, of reconstructing a work of any artistic merit. It is easier to destroy than to construct, and the process of dissolution proceeds along the lines of least resistance. The degenerate may be a genius, and he often is one; but seldom does he open up new paths which lead to true higher development. That hysterics and neurasthenics sometimes swear by him, and imitate his extravagances, goes for little. Glaring colors and extravagant forms have great attractions for hysterical persons. Charcot's reseaches into the visual derangements in degeneration and hysteria furnish us with an intelligible explanation of what Nordau terms "impressionists," "stipplers," "Mosa ists," "papilloteurs," "roaring colorists," and dyers in grey and faded tints. Their efforts are genuine results of physical disease. Nystagmus (or quiver ing of the eyeball) is responsible for a want of firm ness in outline, and affections of the retina for dis torted zigzag lines and for defects in the perception of color. There may be a predilection for neutral tones or for glaring primaries; this predilection being due to the abnormal condition of the nerves and not to any observable aspect of nature. The psychologist, however, is not in any way deceived by the glaring crudities of those artists who-disowning all factors other than sensations present their works in the form of gross lines or blobs of primary colors. Acting on their knowledge of the complementary qualities of red, blue, and yellow, they present them, not as they perceive them in combination, but as primary reds, blues, and yellows. They utilize their knowledge gained through science to hoodwink themselves into the belief that by representing the ultimate and crude elements of color it becomes easy for others to recombine them into a composite whole. This is known to be a fallacy psychologically, and such pseudo-art productions, instead of reflecting the realities of the external world, reflect but the pseudo-scientific mental conceptions of the artists. This post-illusionistic resorting to a symbolic sug gestion of what is merely known to consciousness is false, and the symbols are as frequently like their objects as the symbol H20 is like water to the visual sense. SYMBOLISM AND MYSTICISM IN ART Symbolism is rife in the insane, who undoubtedly do perceive mysterious relations between colors and the sensations of the other senses. So-called second ary sensations, however, although occurring in great variety, are never theatrically displayed for the benefit of the public. Sane critics would liken such efforts to those of the decadent Gautier, or of Baudelaire who died of general paralysis of the insane. Symbolism in insane art is sometimes in vested with a high significance by the artists them selves. Fortunately, however, both they and the public are protected from the vapid and sickly senti mentalism of the borderland critics; i. e., those critics who, in order to arouse curiosity, make a noise with something new and sensational, and, by pandering to the gaping uncritical attitude of the presumably sane, endeavor to raise a market for the disposal of commodities of palpably fictitious value. Many lunatics are mystics and imagine they per ceive unusual relations amongst phenomena. They see signs of mysteries, and they regard ordinary external phenomena as but symbols of something beyond. Their earlier impressions become blurred and indistinct through disordered brain action. Faulty memory and the superposition of distorted former imaginings give to present objective facts a sense of mystery. Thus, a blue color will arouse associations of many things of blue, such as the sea, the sky, a flower, etc., which become merged into the primary percept of blueness and invest it with other meanings or associations. It is, of course, well-nigh impossible to follow the suggestions aroused in the insane mind by a primary impres sion. The consciousness is befooled and wrecked by will-o'-the-wisps and inexplicable relations be tween things. Things are seen as through a mist and without recognizable form, and both the insane artist and his degenerate critic forge chaotic mean ingless jargon to express what is seen or felt. The pseudo-depth of the mystic is all obscurity. Out lines of objects become obliterated, and everything which has no meaning becomes profound. The step from mysticism to ecstasy is short, and, with failure to suppress the wanderings from the real to the imaginary, there are produced for the onlookers such manifestations of imbecility as can find ade quate expression only in pseudo-art, pseudo-music, so-called literature, or in the ravings of the insane. The indifferently interpreted, blurred and nebu lous, sensory impressions of early general paralysis are sometimes suggestive, not of a renaissance of medieval feeling or of post-impressionism, but of a return to primitive barbarism. Inside asylums such a renaissance deludes neither the patients nor their attendants; nor does it provide an excuse for esthetic snobs to found a fashion meriting little else than laughter, wrath, or contempt. The works, although pitiable in themselves, are sources of self-congratulation to the artists, who boast freely as to their merits and hidden meanings. They estimate their value according to their own supersensuous imaginings rather than to any mastery of form or beauty of color. The clumsier the technique, the deeper its meaning. Faulty drawing, deficient color, and general artistic inca pacity stamp such works as pre-Adamite, eccentric or insane. In maniacal states there is inability to fix the attention for long. The impressions of the external world as derived through the defectively operating senses become still more distorted by disordered consciousness. Hence the faulty representation of</page><page sequence="4">October 1916 THE ART WORLD 37 external realities and the exhibition of what are manifestly illusions. When faulty memory is brought into play, the distortions become even more manifest, and the vagaries of .the post-illusionists find therein their full expression. The conscious state of a person receiving impressions in the domain of one sense only has been termed "impressionism." The im pressionist pretends to see before him merely masses of color and light in varying qualities and degrees of intensity. In disease, purely optical perceptions may occur without any activity of the highest cen ters of ideation. This is also one of the first steps towards atavism. The concept is absent, and nothing remains but a simple sense stimulation. The unde veloped or mystically confused thought which exists in savages is fully exemplified in the childish or crazy atavistic anthropomorphism and symbolism so prevalent among degenerates. A predilection for coarseness in line or color is symptomatic of degen eration, and obsessional explosions of obscenities, so characteristic of some forms of mental decay, show themselves as "coprographia"- i. e., pertaining to lust, filth, or obscenity. Most paranoiacs (deluded persons), who, as a rule, do not suffer from disorders of their physical or co-ordinate mechanism, present in their artistic works manifestations of genuine and fertile talent. In spite of the evident craziness of their ideas, their technique is usually too skilful to appeal to gaping simpletons as mysteries and revelations of genius. Their critics find in their works but little scope for the employment of words of empty sound and devoid of meaning. Asylums do not harbor such puppets, nor do their inmates in their intellectual darkness become the devotees of the snobs of fashion. The egomaniac has but little sympathy with, or capacity to adapt himself to, nature and humanity. His perverted instincts render him anti-social even in matters of art. Real lunatics do not form a league of minds, for the simple reason that they are con cerned only with their own individual states and experiences. Some feel a passionate predilection for all that is hideous and evil, others are all for good. EGOMANIACS IN ART The crude, barbarous splendor of the insane artist's productions is, as we have seen, often due to optical illusions. Egomaniacs sometimes become decadent, and surprise us by the increasing barbar ity of their taste and technique. They banish from their horizon all that is natural and surround them selves by all that is artificial. Sometimes their perceptive powers are wholly inaccessible to the beauties of nature, or they suffer from a mania for contradiction of, or revolt from, the realities of things. The egomaniac regards himself as the super man; whereas he is often merely a plagiarist or para site of the lowest grade of atavism. He sometimes becomes a post-illusionist, and subordinates his high est nervous centers and consciousness to the percep tive centers and instinct. Sensations are perceived by him, but they go no further. The primary im pressions are reflected in their distorted state. The beautiful things in nature have for him no exist ence. He himself is the creator of all that is wonder ful and good, and the reflections from his turbid mind are, to his own way of thinking, examples of art for art's sake. BORDERLAND IMITATORS, CRITICS,, AND MALINGERERS AND THEIR EFFECTS ON SOCIETY Borderland dwellers, DegWnre's Sup6rieurs, or Mattoids, comprise the hosts of those who follow, what they are foolishly told to believe to be, new eras in art. The insane person differs from the border land dweller in that his insanity prevents him from adapting himself to, or following, any new fashion in art. They have this in common, however, their revolutionary effects on art may be not only pathetic, as evidences of ignorance and absurdity, but they may also be genuine. One point to be noticed is that borderland dwellers alone are inspired by the dis eased ideas of the insane. As is the case with hypnotism, Christian Science, and many other crazes, neither the sane nor the insane is afflected by them. The founder and his disciples may be sincere; but, sooner or later, the participants of the new doctrine form a rabble of incompetent imitators who lack initiative, and quacks who- abuse their membership by reason of their greed for money or fame. These latter follow merely the dictates of their pockets and easily prey upon a too gullible public. Sincere originators have ever been followed by dishonest intriguers, who invent beauties where none exist. None of these movements herald really new eras, being merely attempts to destroy or suppress the advances and acquirements of the age and en deavors to hark back to the past when the aesthetic sense and skill in technique were but ill-developed. The insane, however, are emancipated from tra ditional discipline: they have, in fact, a contempt for traditional views of custom. , Hence their de parture from many of the ideals in art which for thousands of years have become gradually matured and more or less fully established. This departure being neither foolery nor knavery, but merely de generacy, there gathers round it no concourse of gaping imbeciles greedily seeking for revelations. In asylum practise, neither mysticism, symbolism, nor any other "ism" finds a foothold for advance ment, and inasmuch as lunatics are free from sordid motives they are harmless in their ignorance and segregated in their snobbishness. They do not found so-called intellectual or aesthetic movements and by futile babbling and twaddle seek to propagate what may be, as a matter of fact, nothing else than idiocy or humbug. To the borderland critic who is ignorant of dis ease and its symptoms the works of degenerates are sometimes more than mere sources of amusement; they may serve to provide inspiration for his own unbalanced judgment. They are seldom deliberate swindlers who play up as quacks for the ultimate gain of money. The truly insane critic is usually definite and significant in his language, and he seldom seeks toI dover his ignorance by volubility in the use of obscure and purposeless words. Such being the case, there is no scope for the promotion of bubble-company swindles in asylums, and there is never any danger of leading the public by the nose. The pseudo-artist is common in asylums and has aspirations which he is unable to justify; whereas pseudo-art is almost invariably the product of im</page><page sequence="5">38 THE ART WORLD October 1916 posture-i. e., in asylums pseudo-artists are numer ous, but pseudo-art is rare. In the former, their performance is quite unequal to their desire; whereas, in the latter, the works are usually prod ucts of deceit. The unbounded egoism of lunatics also prevents them from discovering in the works of others beauties in what are evidently the lowest and most repulsive things. That the works of insane artists may be crude, absurd, or vile matters little, so long as they exert no corrupting influence on society, and so long as society fully appreciates their pathological signifi cance. Unfortunately, however, some creations which emanate from degenerates are revered by the borderland critic, blindly admired by the equally borderland public, and their real nature is not ade quately dealt with by the correcting influence of the sane. Moreover, the insane critic is honest in his criti cisms, and views the works of his insane comrades of the brush with an honest and fearless eye and judges them from his own mental standpoint. Seldom or never does he conform to the artist's interpretations of nature, and, although he may recognize the artist as being an imbecile or dement, his courage seldom fails him in giving expression to his real convictions. This is characteristic of the insane, who know no fear, who have no convention ality or esthetic fashion to conform to, and who have no axe to grind. Undoubtedly their intense egotism prevents them from perceiving their own shallowness and incompetence, and in asylums indi vidualism pertains as in no other community. Sel dom it is that the truly insane-those who have passed the borderland and have become certifiable lunatics-imitate each other in art. Rather do we find imitative tendencies in those who are technically and legally neither sane or insane--i. e., in that enormous class which comprises the "borderland." This rabble of hysterics, neurasthenics, weaklings and degenerates have nothing of their own to say, but, by means of a superficial and easily acquired dexterity, they imitate and falsify the feeling of masters in all branches of art, and not only do they injure true art but they also tend to vitiate good taste among the majority of mankind. Among this class are also to be found vast num bers of incompetent critics who, for reasons best known to themselves, welcome these bunglers of the brush and encourage-although inimical to society-abuses of true art which are in reality but instances of mean childishness and demoralization. To the physician who has devoted himself to the special study of nervous and mental maladies there is seldom any difficulty in recognizing at a glance the manifestations of shamming degeneracy or of malingering. That there should be malingerers in art is, nevertheless, a question open to discussion. That malingering in art should occur in true degen eracy, apart from hysterical simulation, would ap pear improbable, and certain it is that in asylum practise there is but little evidence in favor of such a supposition. In malingering post-illusionism there is usually some evidence of higher mental activity, as shown by the artists' knowledge of the theory of color vision, a knowledge of which they freely avail themselves in order to falsify the objective realities before them. Stigmata of degeneration are not confined merely to artists and their works. Critics who fall into raptures and exhibit vehement emotions over works which are manifestly ridiculous and degrading are themselves either imposters or degenerates. Ex cessive emotionalism is a mental stigma of degen eration, and Max Nordau's criticisms apply very aptly to some critics whose own excitabilities ap pear to them to be marks of superiority. They be lieve themselves to be possessed by a peculiar spir itual insight lacking in other mortals, and they are fain to despise the vulgar herd for the dulness and narrowness of their minds. "The unhappy creature," says Nordau, "does not suspect that he is conceited about a disease and boasting of a derangement of the mind; and certain silly critics when, through fear of being pronounced deficient in comprehension, they make desperate efforts to share the emotions of a degenerate in re gard to some insipid or ridiculous production, or when they praise in exaggerated expressions the beauties which the degenerate asserts he finds therein, are unconsciously simulating one of the stigmata of semi-insanity." THE REMEDY The insane art critic never asks himself "what sort of a bad joke is this?-what does this artist want me to believe." Morbid aberrations may serve as casual factors in the production of what is sensual, ugly, and loath some in art, and without doubt the artists may have been quite genuine and sincere in their efforts; but, inasmuch as our asylums do not give shelter to all perpetrators of such mockeries or travesties of good taste and morality, it is difficult to suggest a remedy or means whereby they can be suppressed. The insane art critic who scribbles incoherent nonsense for his fellow-sufferers is simply to be pitied and treated as an honest imbecile and not to be punished as a rogue. If he sees hidden meanings in mystically blurred and scarcely recognizable ob jects, the misfortune, and not the fault, is his, and for what to us may be abominable, ignoble, or laugh able he may have some subtle sympathy or affection. The borderland critics, however, must ever run the risk of being classed with rogues or degen erates. How best to treat then is another matter. From motives of humanity, we are prompted to aid in the survival of those who are biologically unfit; but, with regard to the encouragement, or even toleration, of degenerate art, there may be, with justice, quite another opinion.
