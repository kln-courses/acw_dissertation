<plain_text><page sequence="1">Review of Aegean Prehistory VI: The Palatial Bronze Age of the Southern and Central Greek Mainland CYNTHIA W. SHELMERDINE Dedicated to John Chadwick and William A. McDonald INTRODUCTION This review of Aegean prehistory focuses on the Late Bronze Age in southern and central Greece, with emphasis on current scholarly views about My- cenaean culture in the palatial age.* Much of the evidence on which these views depend has emerged or been reassessed during the last two decades. In * My thanks to Fred Kleiner and Tracey Cullen for in- viting me to contribute to this series in AJA, and for their editorial help. I owe a particular debt to J.L. Davis, who set the standard and showed the way in the first review of this series (AJA 96 [1992] 699-756), and to J.B. Rutter for his coverage of the prepalatial Greek mainland (AJA 97 [1993] 745-97). This review is dedicated to two pioneers with whom I was privileged to work: John Chadwick in textual matters, and William A. McDonald on the archae- ological side. Many colleagues have been generous in their response to pleas for information, permissions, and/or advice: Vas- silis Aravantinos, Paul Astr6m,John Bennet, Emmett Ben- nett, Pierre Carlier, Eric Cline, Fred Cooper, Michael Cos- mopoulos, Jack Davis, Peter Day, Katie Demakopoulou, Oliver Dickinson, Elizabeth French, Robin Hdigg, Halford Haskell, Spiros lakovides, John Killen, Eleni Konsolaki- Yannopoulou, Peter Kuniholm, Albert Leonard, Christo- pher Mee, Jose Melena, Penelope Mountjoy, Mike Nelson, Jean-Pierre Olivier, Ruth Palmer, Ingo Pini, Cemal Pulak, David Reese, Curtis Runnels, Jerry Rutter, Kim Shelton, Carol Thomas, Gisela Walberg, Peter Warren, Berit Wells, Malcolm Wiener,Jim Wright, and Eberhard Zangger. I am also grateful to those who provided technical and editori- al help and general encouragement: John Bennet, Kate Bracher, Jack Davis, Elaine Godwin, Sebastian Heath, Jan Jackson,Jane Okrasinski, Pamela Russell,Jerry Rutter, Susan Shelmerdine, and Chris Williams. Despite the best efforts of all these people, this review does not claim to be a com- prehensive treatment of all aspects of LH III Greece. As usual in such cases, the choice of topics included is idio- syncratic, but I hope others too will find them important and interesting.

The geographical scope (fig. 1) coincides with that of Rutter's review in AJA on the prepalatial Bronze Age.' The northern limit of coverage extends from the Gulf of Arta in the west to the mouth of the Sper- cheios River in the east. Below this line the entire mainland is included, and the immediately surround- ing islands except for Euboea. The chronological fo- cus is the high point of Mycenaean culture during the 14th and 13th centuries B.C., defined in ceramic terms as the Late Helladic (LH) IIIA and LH IIIB periods. Any analysis of the Mycenaean states would be incomplete, however, without consideration of their rise and fall. Recent debate on the emergence of statehood has included essential developments during the Early Mycenaean period, LH I-II.

Even with some flexibility in its chronological lim- its, this review covers a shorter time period than most of the others in this series. By way of compensation, an extra dimension is highlighted: the use of textual evidence. Our ability to read Mycenaean Greek in- creases the range of questions we can ask about the period, and the Linear B tablets raise special prob- lems of their own. In combination with archaeolog- ical discoveries, these texts also contribute to research on a variety of cultural issues such as religion and economic administration. The material to be ad- dressed is thus quite diverse, and is better suited to a thematic approach than to a strict chronological or geographical organization. This review is there- fore arranged under the following headings: chronol- ogy, work at palatial centers and other sites, regional surveys and settlement patterns, technological ad- vances, ceramic studies, development of Mycenaean states, new inscriptions, economic and political ad- ministration, religion, and destructions. The publication of Hope Simpson and Dickinson's Gazetteer in 1979 is the starting point for the review of fieldwork.2 Since then it has been possible to keep abreast of archaeological activity in Greece through the invaluable yearly reviews in Archaeolog- ical Reports and the "Chronique des fouilles" in the Bulletin de correspondance hellenique. Bibliographical access to developments in Linear B studies has been more difficult during the same period. The listings of books, articles, and reviews in Nestor include tex- tual as well as archaeological contributions,3 but the summary publication Studies in Mycenaean Inscriptions and Dialect was in hiatus from 1978 until its resur- rection in 1995.4 Until very recently, new work on the Bronze Age has not been much summarized, as- sessed, or synthesized.5 A welcome change is now evident, with the appearance of comprehensive studies of Bronze Age Crete and mainland Greece as well as analytical bibliographies of Mycenaean society.6 These publications, and the "Review of Ae- gean Prehistory" series itself, document how much has happened in this field in two decades. CHRONOLOGY Late Helladic IIIA-B chronology, both relative and absolute, is more straightforward than that of pre- ceding phases of the Bronze Age. Nonetheless, it is affected by several recent developments, and some points remain in dispute. The alternative chronol- ogies of the Late Bronze Age are given in table 1.7 Ceramic synchronisms still play a role in the debate 2 Gazetteer, with information through 1977.

Deger-Jalkotzy. It includes the Dark Ages and Homer as well as the Late Bronze Age. Its coverage of textual matters is quite broad; archaeological studies are included if they pertain to society and kingship. B. Feuer, Mycenaean Civilization: A Research Guide (Research Guides to Ancient Civilizations 5, New York 1996) offers a brief intro- duction to Mycenaean civilization and an annotated bib- liography organized by topic.

Manning, The Absolute Chronology of the Aegean Early Bronze Age. Archaeol- ogy, Radiocarbon and History (Sheffield 1995) 217-29; and S.W. Manning and B. Weninger, "A Light in the Dark: Archae- ological Wiggle Matching and the Absolute Chronology of the Close of the Aegean Late Bronze Age," Antiquity 66 (1992) 636-63. Manning and Weninger report the end of LH IIIC as 1125/1065/1060, but the reasoning behind the earliest figure, derived from A. Snodgrass, The Dark Age of Greece: An Archaeological Survey of the Eleventh to the Eighth Centuries B.C. (Edinburgh 1971) 122-23, is not now consid- ered feasible.

In the last decade, how- ever, the focus has been on radiocarbon and den- drochronological data, both of which have been refined in accuracy and augmented by new samples. An important recent discovery is a dramatic growth anomaly in Anatolian trees, which may bear on the much-debated absolute date of the Minoan eruption of the island of Thera." That debate is crucial for our understanding of the Early Mycenaean period, but it has only indirect consequences for LH III.9 The point of transition between LH II and LH IIIAl will of course depend on which chronology is fol- lowed, but the two necessarily converge in LH IIIA. The dates listed above do need one modification, in the length of LH IIIA2. There is widespread agree- ment that this period lasted longer than 30-40 years."' The traditional cutoff date of ca. 1340/1330 accommodated the view that Mycenaean pottery from Tell el-Amarna in Egypt includes two stirrup jar fragments with LH IIIB features. The Egyptian court abandoned Amarna in year 3 of Tutankha- mun, who according to the currently favored mid- dle chronology reigned from 1336 to 1327 B.C. A case has been made, however, that both jars can be dated to LH IIIA2." Support for an even later end to LH IIIA2 comes from the shipwreck being exca- vated off the coast of Turkey at Uluburun. A small log from the wreck that was firewood or dunnage, and was cut not long before the ship sank, has a last ring of 1316 B.C.'2 The Mycenaean pottery on board is all compatible with a date in LH IIIA2 except for one jug, still being restored and studied, that may The proposed modifications for LH IIIA-IIIB are explained infra. Warren and Hankey provide a good summary of the ceramic and 14C data as of 1988. Proponents of a low or short Aegean chronology rely chiefly on proposed synchro- nisms between the Aegean and Egypt in dating the erup- tion on Thera to the later 16th century B.C. The high or long chronology rests primarily on scientific evidence (tree- rings, ice cores, and 14C dates) that documents a "frost event" in 1628 B.C. Supporters draw the inference that the eruption of Thera caused this event. 8 P.I. Kuniholm et al., "Anatolian Tree Rings and the Ab- solute Chronology of the Eastern Mediterranean, 2220-718 B.C.," Nature 381 (27June 1996) 780-83; an update on the number of trees observed is reported by Kuniholm, "'Aegean Dendrochronology Project December 1996 Progress Re- port" (unpublished), a newsletter circulated by the project director. The growth spike occurs at and just following rel- ative ring/year 854 of 54 trees from the site of Porsuk in south-central Anatolia. The radiocarbon date range is com- patible with linking this event to the 1628/1627 B.C. event observed in dendrochronologies of Europe and the United States. A second event 470 years later also links up plaus- ibly with an anomaly seen in Europe; together the two would anchor a formerly floating 1,503-year dendrochrono- logical sequence from Anatolia. The Aegean chronology is tied in by the further inference that the Minoan erup- tion of Thera caused the growth event of 1628 B.C. -' Davis 736 with n. 160; Manning (supra n. 7) 30-31, 200-29; M.

The distinction rests on the relationship between height and diameter, which can- not be determined in this case from the amount preserved. The lozenge FM 73 is primarily a LH IIIB motif, which appears in LH IIIA2 chiefly as an accessory: E.B. French, "Late Helladic IIIA 2 Pottery from Mycenae," BSA 60 (1965) 181, 190. As for Hankey no. 8, French (personal commu- nication) reports Mountjoy's view that it may be FS 166 (LH IIIA2-IIIB) rather than FS 182 (LH IIIB). 12 Kuniholm et al. (supra n. 8) 782; C.

With an absolute date for the shipwreck in or shortly after 1316 B.C., it would ap- pear that LH IIIA2 must continue almost to the end of the 14th century B.C. Furthermore, if one vessel really belongs to the following phase, the transition to LH IIIB (a process, after all, not a moment) is be- ginning at about that time. One other chronological issue needs only brief mention. A recent attempt to lower the dates of the Dark Ages would bring the conventional second- millennium chronology down by 250 years, with the Egyptian 18th Dynasty beginningjust after 1300 B.C. and ending just after 1050 B.C.4" This radical redat- ing draws attention to some valid difficulties with the conventional chronology for the Dark Ages. As far as the Late Bronze Age is concerned, though, the attempt flies in the face of sound scientific evi- dence and has met with significant criticism.15 The present framework for continued refinement and debate on Aegean chronology is still confined to the alternatives presented in table 1. WORK AT PALATIAL CENTERS AND OTHER SITES Palaces and Citadels In the past 20 years exploration has been renewed or continued at most of the known Mycenaean pa- latial centers and citadels.16 The result is a better understanding of the nature of such sites and of their history, especially during LH IIIB. Many cemeteries and isolated tombs have also been excavated, but much less attention has been paid to smaller settle- ments. This section summarizes recent work at pa- latial and other settlements, but discoveries at many of the sites receive further attention below in the relevant thematic sections. Mycenae. The site of Mycenae is now under the general supervision of George Mylonas's successor, Spyros lakovides, who has conducted some explor- ations inside the citadel, in the vicinity of the Lion Gate and in the northwest corner of the acropolis.'7 There is still an active British presence here as well, directed by Elizabeth French. Activity during the 1980s and 1990s at this well-explored site has chiefly involved study and publication, rather than new ex- cavations. The latest joint Greek-British effort is a survey project that began in 1991, and will soon be published by the Archaeological Society of Ath- ens.'8 This is not a regional survey, and no syste- matic collection of material was attempted. Rather, like the earlier Knossos survey,'" it was designed to locate, identify, and map all visible remains through- out the settlement of Mycenae- an area of about 32 ha-after more than a century of exploration. The effort is especially valuable in the case of struc- tures whose location or identity had been forgotten over time, as for a number of chamber tombs ex- cavated in the 1880s and 1890s by Tsountas. Most of Tsountas's tomb groups have now been reiden- tified, and over half of the individual tombs have been matched to their old excavation numbers."2 The project has also retraced the network of roads '1 Rutter has retracted the statement cited by Kuniholm et al. (supra n. 8) 782 that the wreck certainly contains LH IIIB pottery, but the possibility remains for the jug mentioned here: C. Pulak, personal communication, and Pulak (supra n. 12). There is nothing inconsistent with a late 14th-century end to LH IIIA2 in the unpublished report by Kuniholm (supra n. 8) of a date of 1353 B.C. for wood (without bark) in the upper Hittite level at Magat H6yuik. The wood is from a building that contains a Mycenaean stirrup jar and flask, both of which appear to date to the transition be- tween LH IIIA and IIIB (personal communication, Elizabeth French). The wood dates construction of the building to soon after 1353 B.C., while the pots belong to the time of its destruction. 14 P. James et al., Centuries of Darkness (London 1991).

A possible change in the list of palatial centers is worth men- tioning, though it falls outside of the review area. The Kas- tro site at Volos (Gazetteer H1) had previously been iden- tified as Iolkos, on the strength of two successive large buildings. Recent excavation has revealed an extensive Myce- naean settlement at Dimini: AR 1991-1992, 39; AR 1992-1993, 47; AR 1994-1995, 35-36. Though to date only a street and private houses have been found, the excava- tors have proposed that Dimini is a better candidate for Iolkos. Presumably future work will strengthen or weaken this possibility. 17 Above and east of the Lion Gate, building N and rooms I-IX: G.E. Mylonas and S.

The first group consists of three LH IIIB houses, of modest domestic char- acter.22 Panayia House I, built first, was destroyed shortly before the end of LH IIIB1. The cause was apparently an earthquake: a woman's body was found in a doorway, her skull crushed, buried by the de- struction debris. The same earthquake damaged House II, a somewhat later construction with a more elaborate plan. It was then partially repaired and reoccupied for a time before succumbing to a fire. House III, a small building belatedly squeezed be- tween Houses I and II, continued in use well after House I, at least, was abandoned. The Oil Merchant group of houses has a very different character. These four houses were con- structed early in LH IIIB (first the West House, then in sequence the House of Shields, the House of the Oil Merchant, and the House of Sphinxes), and all were destroyed by fire near the middle of the period. Tournavitou provides a full account of the houses themselves and the materials found in them.23 Whatever other purposes these houses may have served, they were at least repositories for oil and worked ivories, and probably for perishable com- modities as well. This is suggested by the presence of Linear B tablets, which deal, among other issues, with the collection of spices (Ge series), disburse- ments of wool (Oe), and maintenance of male and female personnel (Au).24 These topics are character- istic of palatial concerns elsewhere, and Tournavi- tou is right, in my view, to regard these buildings as an integral part of the palace administration. Excavations of the South House and Cult Center (Citadel House area) during the 1960s are being presented in a series of fascicles, the first of which summarizes the work year by year and briefly de- scribes the LH IIIB2 remains.25 In addition to these publication projects, a new museum has been con- structed below and north of the citadel. The galler- ies should be ready by the end of 1997; they will house 21 A.

Tiryns. The history of Tiryns has been greatly clar- ified, in large part through the work of the late Klaus Kilian.26 The LH IIIA and earlier remains are discussed below. LH IIIB1 saw rebuilding on the upper citadel, and walls of mudbrick on stone foun- dations were added around the Lower Citadel (Un- terburg). A conflagration at the end of LH IIIB1 necessitated another rebuilding in LH IIIB2. At this point Cyclopean stone fortifications were extended around the entire citadel. At the end of LH IIIB2 the site was destroyed, according to Kilian, by an earthquake.7 The Lower Citadel was rebuilt and occupied into the Submycenaean period, ca. 1065/ 1060-1020/1000 B.C.28 This area was a long- standing part of the Tiryns settlement, consisting of domestic buildings and some cult structures as well, of both LH IIIB2 and LH IIIC date. In addi- tion, a series of casements (38 at present count) pro- vided additional space for storage and offerings. Both the west and east sides have been partially ex- cavated. Meticulous attention to stratigraphy in the Lower Citadel has also led to the refinement of ce- ramic phases from LH IIIA2 Late through LH IIIC (see below). Around the hill lay a Lower Town that was inhab- ited from the Early Helladic period through LH IIIC Late. It expanded greatly in LH IIIB or IIIC; in LH IIIC Early-Middle (the 12th and early 11th centu- ries B.C.) it covered 24.5 ha.2'- Kilian thought that the town was smaller in LH IIIB. Recent geophysical and soil studies, however, suggest a different view."3 It is now clear that the Manessi River near the site changed its course in late LH IIIB-early IIIC. A nat- ural shift from the south to the north side of the citadel deposited as much as 4 m of alluvium, bury- ing much of the Lower Town east and north of the citadel under flash flood deposits. The inhabitants subsequently diverted the river well to the south by constructing a dam and canal, so that houses could be built in the former streambed. It is likely that the Lower Town was at least as large in LH IIIB as in LH IIIC, even though much of it is obscured by sed- iment.I1 The same investigations also show that the coastline was only about 300 m southwest of Tiryns in the Early Bronze Age, ca. 2500 B.C., but receded to ca. 1 km from the citadel during EH II, where it remained throughout the Bronze Age.32 Midea. Work at the citadel of Midea in the Argo- lid resumed as a Greek-Swedish project in 1983, under the direction of K. Demakopoulou with the collaboration of P. Astr6m.: The Swedish team has been working in the area of the East Gate and on the lower terraces, and the Greek team in the area of the West Gate. All three areas suffered a burning destruction late in LH 11IB2, and large fallen blocks and collapsed walls suggest that the cause was an earthquake. Foundation trenches for the citadel wall near the East Gate and on a lower terrace contained LH IIIB2 pottery, showing that at least some sections of the wall were constructed during that phase. A 26 S. Iakovides, "Das Werk Klaus Kilians," AM 108 (1993) 9-27 provides a good summary of Kilian's work at the site. Reports by K.

A complex of six rooms abutting the citadel wall inside the West Gate served as workshops and store- rooms. Among the finds were remains of foodstuffs such as figs, olive stones, shellfish, small animal bones, and grain. Evidence of workshop activity includes grinding stones and pestles, a steatite jewelry mold, pieces of fluorite and mother-of-pearl, and a bronze knife of leather-working type.34 Pottery in the de- struction level is generally of typical LH IIIB2 vari- eties, with good parallels from Mycenae and Tiryns, but with a few features conventionally assigned to early LH IIIC. This mixture defines a transitional LH IIIB2/IIIC Early phase recently identified by Mountjoy (see below).35 The lower terraces of the citadel have also been the focus of attention, especially in areas M and N. Both produced stratified deposits of LH IIIB and LH IIIC below Roman occupation layers, as well as earlier material. Sherds in a foundation trench for the citadel wall in area M confirm a LH IIIB2 con- struction date for that section, matching findings from the upper gate areas. A large (14 x 7.5 m) mega- ron complex is emerging in area N (fig. 3), but few details have yet been published.36 It had long been assumed that a megaron had stood on the summit of the hill, as at other Mycenaean palaces, although no architectural traces of such a building were ever found. The off-center and less prominent position of the newly discovered structure is thus of interest. The megaron at Midea has two LH IIIB floor levels. Five buttresses against the south wall are an unusual feature, with a parallel in the LH 111B2 "mansion" at the Menelaion.7 The excavator suggests that they may have been intended to protect against earth- quakes. In this they were unsuccessful, for a tilted 34 Demakopoulou et al. 1994 (supra n. 33) fig. 36 (fluo- rite), fig. 37 (jewelry mold). 35 Demakopoulou 1995 (supra n. 33) 155; Demakopou- lou, forthcoming (supra n. 33). 36 Demakopoulou et al. 1994 (supra n. 33) 41, fig. 65; Walberg, World Wide Web (supra n. 33).

Pylos. In 1990, members of the project Minnesota Archaeological Researches in the Western Pelopon- nese (MARWP) began work at the palatial site of Ano Englianos under the direction of EA. Cooper, with M.C. Nelson as field director.4' With a view to pre- paring a complete site plan of the architectural re- mains, the project members are removing backfill, clearing walls and floors down to the lowest course of stone or the lowest level reached by the original excavators. A state plan of the Main Building is in progress (fig. 4). Remains uncovered to date reveal some discrepancies from the older published plans in a number of areas. For example, the excavator of Pylos, Carl Blegen, restored a door between outer propylon 1 and room 7 of the Archive Complex, in a wall that had been destroyed by post-Mycenaean robbing. Recently it has been suggested that access to the Archive Complex was more likely to have been from the interior of the palace, from inner propy- lon 2 to room 8.42 Work in this area during 1995 has brought to light some confirmation of this sugges- tion: a stone found under the plaster floor of inner propylon 2 is in a suitable place to have been a footer under the threshold of such a door.43 Stratigraphical investigations by the Minnesota team also indicate a more complex relative chronol- ogy for the site. The sequence of construction is now clear for the northeastern side of the palace. Five building phases, beginning in the MH period, pre- date construction of the Main Building and the Wine Magazine, which Blegen dated to the beginning of LH IIIB. Subsequently (phase 7), courts 42 and 47 were created by the construction of a rubble wall. A branch of the water channel to the east was diverted to run parallel to the northeast wall of court 47, and the corridor between the two (ramp 91) was then paved with plaster. The Northeast Workshop is a still later construction (phase 8), for its southwest wall rests on the edge of the water channel. Phase 9 rep- resents post-Mycenaean (Dark Age) habitation of the site, for which there is increasing evidence.44 In addition to this work on the site itself, the vi- cinity of the palace was intensively surveyed by mem- bers of the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project in order to determine the size of the settlement. Ar- tifact densities indicate that habitation extended for about 1 km along the Englianos Ridge and covered its full width (ca. 200-300 m), so that the area of the town was between 20 and 30 ha.43 Geophysical ex- ploration by the project has also produced some wel- come surprises. Chief among them is a substantial subsurface lineament, detected by magnetometry and electric resistivity, on the steep northwestern side of the Epano Englianos ridge. In computer models the upper boundary of the source causing the anom- aly has been determined to be 1.0-1.5 m below the surface. The lineament is 60 m in length and 2.0- 2.7 m wide.

Port basin southwest of the palace at Pylos. (Courtesy E. Zangger) the hill, it is conjectured to be a substantial terrace or fortification wall, perhaps marking the limit of the Late Bronze Age settlement in this direction.46 If confirmed, this discovery would solve the long- standing puzzle of why Pylos, alone among Late Bronze Age palatial centers, seemed to be unwalled. Blegen failed to find traces of such a wall despite extensive test excavations, but he looked only in the immediate vicinity of the palace, while the distance between the westernmost corner of the palace and this anomaly is between 50 and 110 m. Landscape and soil analysis in the Pylos area has also resulted in the identification, just inland from the west coast near Romanou, of a man-made rect- angular basin that is interpreted as a protected port for the Palace of Nestor (fig. 5).47 The sediments in cores taken from the basin contained marine organ- isms, showing that it was once linked to the sea. In- land of the basin, and separated from it by a bed- rock knoll, was a lake also apparently constructed by Mycenaean engineers. They diverted the Selas River from its natural course southward to the Os- managa Lagoon, cutting a channel through the bed- rock knoll so that the river would flow through the basin and prevent its outlet to the sea from clogging with sand. Most of the sediment carried by the river would be trapped in the lake. Thus, a relatively clear stream was directed through the basin, and the re- mainder kept its original course to the lagoon. Cores from the lagoon, dated by radiocarbon, show that the deposition rate of riverine sediment there di- minished ca. 1400 B.C., confirming the date at which the diversion was effected. It was reduced even further ca. 1200 B.C. The best explanation is that when the Mycenaean palace was destroyed and care- ful control of the area ceased, all of the current sim- ply took the shorter route to the sea through the basin--a course it has followed ever since.

Thebes. The considerable obstacle of a thriving modern town obscures the full plan of Mycenaean Thebes, but limited probes in various locations con- tinue to show that the site was an important center during LH III.49 The old debate over the existence of one or two palaces seems to have been resolved in favor of two successive structures on the acropolis, and the site was fortified at least from LH IIIA. Sev- eral important groups of Mycenaean remains have been excavated since the publication of the Gazetteer. An ivory workshop was found on the M. Loukos plot across Pelopidou Street from the so-called Arsenal, destroyed at the end of LH IIIB1.50 Two more exca- vations have unearthed important groups of in- scribed Linear B documents (discussed infra). Gla. Spyros lakovides has summarized the pres- ent state of research at Gla in several recent and forth- coming publications.5' The huge acropolis was con- structed at the end of LH IIIA2, and occupied into LH IIIB2.52 Its 3-km circuit of fortification walls surrounded an area of 20 ha, but architectural re- mains are confined to a 2-ha enclosure on the high- est part of the site. The northern building consists of two wings, of similar size and construction. They are two-storied, and are made up mostly of two- and three-room units bordered by corridors. The build- ing is sometimes referred to as palatial, and the large units at each free corner as megaron-like. Neither unit shows traces of a hearth or columns, however, and the one in the northwest corner has an uncanonical polythyron between rooms 2 and 3. The southern building complex includes long, nar- row storerooms oriented north-south, with a total area of 2,500 m2. Finds include storage jars and a quantity of grain. Iakovides estimates the storage capacity of these rooms to be at least 2,000 tons.53 It appears that the construction of Gla was connected with the Mycenaean system of dikes and canals that controlled drainage of the Copaic Basin, and made up to 20,000 ha available for cultivation.54 As Iako- vides suggests, the site may have housed overseers for the area, and also provided storage space for the resulting crops.55 Other Settlements Only the more important settlement work receives attention here.56 On the hill of Tsoungiza at Nemea 48J.C.

Methana is another area with Mycenaean settlement remains, but the only details so far published concern a Mycenaean sanctuary at Ayios Konstantinos (see below). The ridgetop settle- ment of Nichoria sported a megaron in LH IIIA1, and it may therefore have been an independent center of power at that time. During LH IIIA2-IIIB it is an ordinary town, like Tsoungiza the largest in its area.59 Simple houses are the norm, some lined up along a street in area III. A new tholos was constructed at the site in LH IIIA2, with prestigious grave goods like jewelry, sealstones, and a matched set of bronze vessels. These signs of wealth and some shared ves- sel types of unusual form show that Nichoria profited from its association with Pylos. Furthermore, its geographical position above the southwest corner of the Messenian valley (fig. 6), along a natural route across the peninsula, fits the profile of one partic- ular lookout site mentioned in the Pylos tablets. Ad- ditional points of similarity are the bronze-working establishment that operated here in LH IIIB and the suitability of the site's location for flax production. Nichoria can thus be identified with some confidence 57J.C.

Betancourt and R. Laffineur eds., Ti~vrl: Craftsmen, Craftswomen and Crafts- manship in the Aegean Bronze Age (Aegaeum 16, Liege 1997). In addition to architecture, a large deposit (over 20,000 sherds) of early LH IIIB1 pottery was found in a rubbish pit near a building of the same date. P.

The sug- gestion has been made that it was a local capital and the port for Thebes, perhaps even the Mycenaean Aulis.62 An excellent summary of the Mycenaean re- mains at Delphi is now available, along with com- ments on the region, and on cult remains.63 The site itself has traces of occupation from LH I, and the LH IIIB-early IIIC periods are especially well rep- resented ceramically. The only Mycenaean architec- tural feature uncovered since 1978 is a terrace wall under the cella of the Temple of Apollo, which may have served also as a fortification wall.64 REGIONAL SURVEYS AND SETTLEMENT PATTERNS Over the last quarter-century, there has been a sub- stantial change in the study of Mycenaean settle- ment. As is clear from the preceding section, this change is not much reflected in excavations, which have continued to concentrate mainly on palaces and tombs. The Nemea Valley Archaeological Project is one of the few projects to follow the model of the Minnesota Messenia Project at Nichoria in explor- ing an ordinary habitation site (Tsoungiza) and its environs. The real innovation is a broadening of per- spective from single sites to regional settlement pat- terns. Closely tied to this change is the coming of age of intensive survey as a productive archaeolog- ical tactic. It is a tribute to Carl Blegen, one of the great pioneers of Mycenaean archaeology, that he realized the need for survey work of this kind as early as 1941.65 The seed Blegen planted took some time to flour- ish: the broadening of interest from the Mycenaean king to his subjects, and from the center to its sur- roundings, did not occur until the 1960s and 1970s, beginning with the pioneering extensive survey proj- ect known as the Minnesota Messenia Expedition.66 The broad-brush approach of extensive survey has been overshadowed by intensive survey, where se- lected areas are covered at a level of detail designed to insure that no significant archaeological material goes unnoticed. Rutter has provided a thorough re- view of the way in which intensive survey has devel- oped during the last two decades, with references to a number of recent and current projects.67 Com- ments here are therefore restricted to an update on recent results and their particular relevance to the political geography of the Late Bronze Age. It is ap- propriate to keep in mind recent warnings about the variability of goals and methods in different sur- vey projects, and the difficulties inherent in inter- preting ceramic and other data.68 Nevertheless, the final reports so far published explain clearly their approach to such issues as site definition, functional types, and settlement hierarchy. Survey data can be especially useful for compar- ing site densities in different regions. Table 2 shows the numbers of Early, Middle, and Late Bronze Age sites found by nine recent intensive survey projects, and densities per 10 km2 to facilitate comparisons among the different project areas and periods.69 In the following discussion the emphasis is on the Late Helladic settlement patterns, with some comparison to the Middle Helladic period. The fluctuation of the number of sites in differ- ent regions from the Early to the Late Helladic period has interesting historical implications. Particularly noticeable is a striking increase from MH Early- 6 C.W. Shelmerdine, "Nichoria in Context: A Major Town in the Pylos Kingdom," AJA 85 (1981) 319-25. 61 M.B.

For useful comparison among regions it is necessary to go beyond numbers of dots on a map, and to consider several other factors. When within the LH period are sites founded or abandoned? Where are the new sites in relation to earlier ones? Are they habitations or other types? Do sites that continue from MH to LH grow or decline in size, or do they continue unchanged? How do such changes relate to developments in the political land- scape? A thorough inquiry goes beyond the scope of this review, but some observations can be made for survey areas for which sufficient information is available. The northeastern Peloponnese has been the fo- cus of a number of recent studies.7" Members of the Southern Argolid Exploration Project surveyed the southern end of the Akte peninsula, south of the Ad- heres mountain range.7' The 44-km2 area intensively surveyed shows a dramatic increase from five MH habitation sites to 27 in the LH period. All of the LH sites are habitations except C1 and C3 (quarries; possible habitations).72 LH III remains are most abundant, but the growth begins in the Shaft Grave period (MH III-LH I).7: Increased population and intensified land use correlate with a wide dispersal of sites across the landscape and a settlement hier- archy of "villages and smaller satellites."74 The same pattern of development was observed in the Nemea Valley area, where the number of sites increases substantially, beginning in the Shaft Grave period. This trend continues through the Early Myce- naean period to LH IIIA1.75/ These new sites tend to be fairly large, and are evenly distributed through- out the study area. The onset of this period of growth coincides with the new prosperity of Mycenae in LH I.

As is well known, there is an em- barrassment of important Mycenaean citadels in the Argolid, especially during LH IIIB when Mideajoins Mycenae and Tiryns as a fortified acropolis with a megaron complex.76 In the Nemea Valley, Tsoungiza is the only site to exhibit substantial growth at this time. A recent study by Dabney also suggests that its expansion was due to the economic development stimulated by Mycenae, and that its ability to acquire finely decorated pottery depended on its integration into the kingdom of Mycenae.77 Indeed, with more than one center perhaps competing for dominance of the Argive plain, Mycenae may have been able to increase its power by reaching north into the Nemea Valley.7w It still remains unclear, however, whether Mycenae, Tiryns, and Midea each controlled a sepa- rate state. The status of Midea is especially uncer- tain; the megaron complex is suggestive of power, but to date no tablets have been found there. A few inscribed nodules attest to an administrative pres- ence (see below), but if the inhabitants of the site did not generate their own tablets, Midea could have been a literate outpost of one of the other two centers. The Methana peninsula also exhibits growth but to a lesser extent.79 Of four possible MH habitations only MS10 is certain, and it is sizeable, covering 1.1 ha. All continue into LH, with a particular increase in site size in LH III, when both MS67 and MS124 grow to over 1 ha. Only one new site is founded in LH IIIA, albeit an important one: excavations at Ayios Konstantinos (MS13) have revealed a shrine complex as well as part of the settlement.80 All of these sites are on or near the coast, and two (MS10, MS67) are described as typical Mycenaean acropolis sites. The picture corresponds to that in the southern Argo- lid, with growth in both size and numbers of sites in the Early Mycenaean period, and the strongest presence in LH III. In other areas settlement patterns do not follow the trend just described. The Laconia Survey has lo- cated a large number of chiefly small rural sites in central Laconia, in a 70-km2 area extending from the Eurotas River on the west to the village of Chrys- apha on the east, and from the Menelaion north- ward to the site of Palaiogoulas.81 The few that show signs of Middle and Late Bronze Age occupation are located in the southern part of the survey area. The Middle Bronze Age is much better represented there, with 11 inhabited sites. Of these, four were abandoned by the end of that period, and one by the end of LH II. Six MH sites were inhabited into LH IIIB, although two of them (R291, S478) seem diminished in LH III from their earlier extent.82 Only three LH III sites surveyed have no MH-LH II remains. The small hamlet of Melathria is one of these, inhabited from LH IIIA1 to IIIB2.8" This gen- eral stability over time is interesting, given an ap- parent break in occupation of the Menelaion itself during LH IIIA2-B1.84 Monumental buildings exist at the Menelaion in the Early Mycenaean period, and again in LH IIIB2, making it the likeliest can- didate yet known in Laconia to have been a center of power. The LH IIIA2-B1 hiatus is rather surpris- ing, as is the fact that it had no apparent effect on settlement in the surrounding area. Exploration in the survey area continues in the form of the Laconia Rural Sites Project."5 Twenty single-period sites of different periods were inves- tigated in 1993-1994 to determine their form and function. The project includes geophysical prospec- tion and soil studies, as well as analysis of artifacts 76 A building "sur plan de megaron" has also been re- ported on the east side of the Aspis at Argos by G.

This multifaceted approach is exemplary, and the concentration on rural sites addresses a gap in current knowledge.86 Work by the Pylos Regional Archaeological Proj- ect reveals yet another pattern of settlement in west- ern Messenia.87 Intensive field-walking covered ap- proximately 40 km2 within a larger area extending from just north of modern Koryphasion northward to just beyond Gargaliani, and from the coast east- ward across the Aigaleon mountain range to the mod- ern village of Maryeli. Eleven sites showed signs of MH occupation. Eight of these were inhabited into LH IIIB, while three were apparently abandoned after LH II/early IIIA.X8 It may be that no new sites were founded in LH, though at three places earlier (MH) occupation is uncertain. Analysis of the data is still in progress, but some points are already clear. The MH period is better represented in Messenia than elsewhere, and there is no upsurge in the number of sites in the Early Mycenaean period. The time of greatest change in the region is not the Shaft Grave period, but the beginning ofLH III, which is marked, not by the founding of new sites as in the Argolid and the Nemea Valley, but by the abandonment of earlier ones. It is hard to avoid the inference that this trend is connected with the rising power of the Pylian center. Furthermore, two of the abandoned sites (A2 and Li) lie in valleys just east of the Aiga- leon range, which probably formed the provincial boundary of the Pylos kingdom.89 Border zones tend to be more heavily occupied during periods when there is no strong central power. When the center is strong, people leave the liminal zones, and it may be that people moved out of these remote valleys and closer to the center of power in LH IIIA (probably LH IIIA2), as Pylos annexed the area be- yond Aigaleon.9o Several other observations support this inference. Tholos tombs proliferate in Messenia during the Early Mycenaean period, suggesting the presence of rival elites, but fewer tholoi are in use in LH IIIA2-IIIB, when they are limited to Pylos itself and to sites with probable administrative links to the center, like Nichoria.91 The megaron there goes out of use after LH IIIA1, and a tholos is constructed in LH IIIA2; both developments may indicate the time when local autonomy ended and Nichoria be- came part of the Pylos kingdom, as the power of the latter expanded to include the Messenian valley.'' It is not yet possible to make definitive statements about the Cambridge/Bradford project in southern Boeotia. Analysis to date, however, indicates no ma- jor drop in settlement during the MH period and no major expansion thereafter. At most sites all three phases of the Bronze Age are represented.9" It is to be hoped that when all the results are in, survey data from this area will contribute to the analysis of po- litical history as they have done in the northeastern Peloponnese and Messenia. For the moment, the boundaries of the Theban kingdom are still unclear in most directions, though the appearance of the place-names Karystos, Amarynthos, and now Eleon on tablets from Thebes suggests that it controlled the southern half of Euboea-and therefore pre- sumably the intervening territory of southeastern Boeotia.-4 Worth noting in this connection is the set- 86 Cherry (supra n. 68) 97. 87 "Chronique" 1993, 795-96; "Chronique" 1994, 715-17; AR 1992-1993, 31-32; AR 1993-1994, 30; AR 1994-1995, 25; J.L.

Some recent assessments make extravagant claims about survey work: one commentator perceives a threat that practicalities will force a shift from ex- cavation to survey, while another goes so far as to call the development of regional studies a Kuhnian paradigm shift.95 However, the detailed results now appearing in survey publications indicate the advan- tages and limitations of this technique more fairly than either its most enthusiastic supporters or its strongest detractors. Surface survey is not a substi- tute for excavation, but it offers a regional perspec- tive that excavation cannot give. The preceding analy- sis illustrates how diachronic survey data can clarify the history of an area, and how regional compari- son, even at a fairly basic level, can reveal meaning- ful synchronic variations.96 TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES In 1941, when Blegen discussed the value of sur- vey archaeology, he also predicted quite correctly that "we shall come more and more to rely on pure science for help in solving many of the problems that face us."'97 Scientific contributions to archaeo- logical projects have indeed become essential both in fieldwork and in the subsequent analysis of data. Some new kinds of tools and techniques are listed here, and examples of their impact on Late Bronze Age studies are discussed in the relevant sections of this review. Among new hardware, the Global Po- sitioning System (GPS), developed for military use, has been enthusiastically adopted by some as a means of pinpointing sites and other features. On the ground, advances in surveying equipment like total stations greatly ease the process of mapping sites and surveying architectural remains.98 Geophysical prospection is also a valuable complement to sur- face exploration, whether or not excavation is to fol- low (as we have seen in the detection of the probable wall at Pylos). Landscape and soil studies have also proven invaluable,99 and have contributed greatly to our understanding of Mycenaean engineering: two Late Bronze Age examples are described above, per- taining to Tiryns and Pylos. Ceramic study of the Late Bronze Age too has been greatly enhanced by advances in provenience analysis, combining petrog- raphy and chemical spectrography, and in the analy- sis of organic residue (see below). Finally, a word should be said about computer ap- plications in archaeology. Computer Aided Drafting/ Design (CAD) software transforms the coordinates of surveyed points into a three-dimensional recon- struction of a structure or a topographical site map..'0 An even more powerful tool for expressing data in terms of spatial relationships is the Geo- graphical Information System (GIS), which allows spatial data to be stored, manipulated, mapped, and visualized on a computer in two or three dimen- has a potential rival to the northwest in Orchomenos, where a complex of three alleged "megaron units" has a LH IIIA2 and a LH IIIB stage: Gazetteer G 1; AR 1984-1985, 31; and T.

This work has important consequences for the study of intra- and extra-Aegean trade. For ex- ample, Cretan stirrup jars at mainland sites are a well-known phenomenon.104 Haskell's study, how- ever, adds several refinements. Petrographic analysis of stirrup jars from Thebes and Mycenae has shown that, in addition to west Cretan vessels, some jars previously thought to have been produced locally originated in central Crete.'05 Most, indeed, are in a south-central Cretan fabric, newly distinguished by petrographic analysis and also prevalent at Knos- sos. Both sites contain examples of fabrics that were previously considered Knossian, occurring in quan- tity at Knossos and other sites in the Aegean and beyond. But these same fabrics also appear at other Cretan sites such as Malia,o06 and further recent work on Crete has shown that at least some of these fabrics have their origin in the south-central part of the island. Among the project's future plans is analysis of the organic residue preserved on the clay of such stirrup jars. Thesejars are known to be con- tainers for olive oil, but the further investigation should confirm whether this oil came in different grades, whether it was plain or perfumed, and whether the jars carried any other commodities. Other ongoing efforts also pertain to the move- ment of pottery in international trade. One contri- bution is the cataloguing of corpora of Aegean pot- tery found outside Greece; the most recent study covers Syria-Palestine."17 Another is the study by Nicolle Hirschfeld of Aegean and Canaanite vessels with incised and painted signs.10s The majority of marked Mycenaean vessels are LH IIIA-B stirrup and piriformjars, with the signs incised after firing. The markings are in the Cypriot system, and such vessels from the Argolid may have been marked there but intended for export. Traditional pottery studies have not been entirely displaced, and they continue to prove valuable in their own right.'09 P. Mountjoy has provided an up- date of Furumark's monumental classification for decorated pottery, as well as a more general intro- duction to Mycenaean pottery.11"0 The stratigraphy at Tiryns has led to an extensive refinement of phases there from LH IIIA2 Late through LH IIIC. Early, Middle, Developed, and Late phases have been dis- tinguished within LH IIIB, and Early, Developed, Ad- vanced, and Late phases for LH IIIC."111 The LH IIIB phases have been described and correlated with stan- dard definitions of LH IIIB 1 and LH IIIB2, and with the pottery groups from Mycenae on which these are traditionally based. Within each phase, variants of shapes and motifs are further labeled Fading, Floruit, or Innovative, based on their percentages within each LH IIIA and IIIB phase. It remains to be seen how far such fine distinctions can be applied elsewhere, but the phases themselves do have par- allels at other sites. LH IIIBI Early includes features of both LH IIIA2 and LH IIIB1 as those phases are conventionally defined. Such a transitional phase has also been recognized at other sites (e.g., Nichoria and Korakou),"2 and correlated with the latest LH 104 E.

Another trend in ceramic studies has been the increasing awareness of variations from site to site and region to region in the palatial period."16 For example, some LH 111B2 features like Group B deep bowls are much less common in Messenia and La- conia than in the Argolid. The LH 11IB2 and early LH IIIC periods are well represented at Delphi, and exhibit some typical Argolid features, but again with local peculiarities.117 DEVELOPMENT OF MYCENAEAN STATES One of the important questions occupying schol- ars of Mycenaean Greece in the last decade concerns the transformation of scattered enclaves of power, characteristic of the Middle Helladic period, into the centralized states of LH IIIA-B."" The political entities of the Early Mycenaean period are best clas- sified as chiefdoms, wherein chiefs wielding inher- ited power coordinated economic, social, and reli- gious activities, and maintained authority through ritual and the display of prestige goods and symbols of power."9 The later states exhibit a much higher degree of political and social complexity. The tablets suggest a fairly elaborate official hierarchy, and dem- onstrate the high degree to which economic control is essential to political power (see below). As Wright notes, the essential difference between a chiefdom and a state is that in the latter offices are "abstracted, formally defined and independent of the individual who fills them."'21o It is widely believed that it took the Mycenaeans all of LH I-II to achieve this level of social, economic, and political development. Con- ventional measures of statehood include the defini- tion of an administrative center through the construc- tion of a palatial building complex, the development of writing, and the establishment of state institutions such as a state religion. Additional criteria such as complexity of social ranking- best reflected archaeo- logically in burials-- and trade in prestige goods can characterize chiefdoms as well as states, but they too are useful indicators of the development that took place in Greece from Early Mycenaean times to LH III.

SHELMERDINE [AJA 101 may be a useful way to organize information and to indicate current thinking on Mycenaean states and their development. Construction of an Administrative Building Complex The strict architectural definition of a Mycenaean palace is a large ashlar construction centered on a megaron unit: a rectangular room with four columns surrounding a hearth, its long walls extending to form a porch and a vestibule.'21 Extant traces show that such building complexes existed from LH IIIA at most of the centers that are important in LH IIIB: Mycenae, Tiryns, Pylos, and perhaps Thebes.'22 Sug- gestions of still earlier palaces at these sites remain unproven, mainly because later construction has obliterated all or most of the architecture that might have existed. Wace demonstrated the existence of a structure on the Mycenae hilltop in LH I-II, adapted to the contours of the terrain, but there is nothing to show whether it included a megaron.123 The earliest identifiable megaron unit at Tiryns, sit- uated under the later main megaron (rooms V-VII), dates to LH IIIA1.124 The subsidiary megaron (rooms XXI-XXII) also had a predecessor in early LH IIIA, and the first fortifications also appear in this phase, at the south end of the acropolis. At Py- los, several phases of walls and stucco flooring under- lie the extant LH IIIB palace (notably in rooms 7, 55-57), with similar orientation and poros facade. These are probably part of an earlier palace pre- sumed to date to LH IIIA, although there is little or no ceramic evidence. 25 There is as yet no con- firmation that still earlier structures at the site were palatial.126 The chronology of Thebes is especially difficult, and the architectural remnants sparse. No canonical megaron unit is yet attested, but there do seem to have been two successive structures on the acropolis. The earlier palace, the House of Kadmos, may go back to LH II.127 If so, and if it were truly a megaron, it would stand out as the earliest exam- ple on the mainland. The site was fortified at least from LH IIIA.128 As just noted, the nature of Early Mycenaean struc- tures at later palace sites is not clear from the exist- ing architectural traces. Some possibilities are sug- gested, however, by evidence from contemporary nonpalatial sites whose architecture was not obscured by later construction.129 After all, the Early Myce- naean chiefs who occupied the known palatial cen- ters were the winners in the competition among lo- cal powers to extend their authority over a wider area. At other sites, less successful rivals also left be- 121 The word megaron -with or without mitigating quo- tation marks -is variously and loosely applied to rectan- gular buildings of many different places and periods. It would be better to restrict it to the definition given here, if it is to be used at all: cf. P. Darcque, "Pour l'abandon du terme 'megaron'," in Darcque and Treuil (supra n. 49) 21-31. 122 R.L.N.

LH IIIA pottery predominates in debris cov- ering the earlier wall in room 7, though there are a few possibly earlier pieces, and some sherds ofLH IIIB. About the material from under rooms 55-57, which had been badly disturbed before excavation, Blegen et al. 36 could report only that "we felt that we were dealing with wares of Mycenaean III A." 126 The Minnesota Pylos Project has reported walls forming "a megaron-like plan" beside the Wine Magazine (rooms 104-105): AR 1992-1993, 33, phase 3; Cooper and Swain (supra n. 41).

In many cases there are features that prefigure those of the canonical Mycenaean megaron complex, but none meets the strict definition. The earliest example is a likely MH prototype of the megaron unit in house D at Asine, which had a rectangular room and porch, but no hearth or column bases.130 Several prominent Early Mycenaean buildings also have rooms that approx- imate megaron units. The LH II mansion I at the Menelaion in Laconia is usually the first building to be suggested in such a context.'31 Building F at Krisa in Phocis is earlier, however, constructed in LH I.132 At Kakovatos in Elis a LH II building in- cludes a large room with two preserved column bases.'"1 None of these structures achieves the ca- nonical form of the later palaces. Even unit IV-4A at Nichoria, which is confined in date to LH IIIA1 and thus contemporary with the earliest true mega- ron at Tiryns, has only one anteroom (not a true porch and vestibule) and only two column bases at either end of a hearth.134 The true Mycenaean pal- ace, then, is a product of long evolution, as may also be true of its Minoan counterpart.'35 Though we can identify early megaron complexes and their pre- decessors, the point at which such a structure be- gins to represent palatial authority remains a differ- ent and challenging question. Development of Writing A process of selection and adaptation is visible in the derivation of the Linear B script from Minoan Linear A.136 There is a considerable overlap in the sign repertories of the two scripts: only about 16 of the 89 Linear B syllabograms have no Linear A pre- decessor. However, the syllabograms are generally simplified and regularized, many new ideograms were added and most of the Minoan ones abandoned, and a different fractional system was adopted. The Mycenaean tendency to impose their own style on what they borrowed is as clear in their writing sys- tem as it is in their art. Palaima has recently argued on palaeographical grounds that LH IIA/LM IB was the most likely time for the adaptation, but a stone with incised Linear B syllabograms has been reported from a late MH context at Kafkania, 7 km north of Olympia.'37 No numbers or logograms appear on this isolated find, however, and it shows at best an early stage of Mycenaean writing, not the kind of written administration seen later. Like the altered syllabary, restriction of writing to administrative use in the Mycenaean palatial era is another change from Minoan practice. Minoan inscriptions appear on a variety of artifacts of different materials, and in a variety of contexts. At the same time, their adminis- trative uses appear to be limited. By contrast, Linear B inscriptions are found only on clay, either painted on transport jars or incised on tablets, labels, and sealings at major centers, but the range of their uses within the administrative sphere is extensive. As far as is known, the first clear use of Linear B writing for administrative purposes was on Crete. The Room of the Chariot Tablets at Knossos, con- taining a cache of Linear B tablets, is currently under- stood to date to LM II.13 The Mycenaean adminis- tration that these early documents reveal is not much different from that seen in the later Knossian doc- uments. We know nothing comparable on the main- land until the end of LH IIIB1, in the Ug tablets and the Wu nodules from Thebes, and the tablets from 130 Barber (supra n. 122) 20-21, fig. 10; 0.

These certainly predate the main archive of late LH IIIB, and their distinc- tive palaeography suggests that they may belong to LH IIIA.139 Complexity of Social Ranking Tomb types, grave goods, and tomb placement can all differentiate elite from nonelite members of a society. For the Early Mycenaean period, tombs are much better attested than settlement material. Ex- cavation priorities are part of the reason, but it is also true that elite burials are often highly visible in the archaeological landscape, and in LH I-I there are many of these. The prime example is the tholos tomb. It used to be tempting to assume that these must be "royal" graves, but their early proliferation and their tendency to occur in pairs or triplets mil- itate against this view. At Mycenae itself they first appear only in LH IIA, but in Messenia the earliest are contemporary with the Mycenae Shaft Graves in MH III-LH I.140 The Early Mycenaean tholos is now understood to be a symbol of elite status, and thus certainly a precursor to statehood, but not an indicator that it begins this early.141 The nature of the power wielded by the elite members of Early Mycenaean societies is impossible to discern, but wealthy burials are sufficiently numerous and widely dispersed to suggest that the reach of each center was quite limited. Another notable feature during this period is the diversity of tomb types and burial customs. Cists and pits coexist with chamber tombs and even at times with tholoi, and Dickinson has warned against the equation of cist tombs with a poorer element of society.142 On a regional basis the tholoi themselves are common in Messenia but vir- tually unknown in Boeotia, while for chamber tombs the reverse is true. In LH IIIA2-IIIB, by contrast, some standardiza- tion of tomb types can be seen, and the number of large tholoi in use drops significantly. They are con- centrated at palatial centers, chiefly in Messenia and the Argolid, though small ones are built on a regional basis, especially in peripheral areas.143 These phe- nomena can very plausibly be linked with the rise in power of the Mycenaean states.144 The general de- cline in large tholoi coincides with increasingly elab- orate architecture in the form of palatial complexes, suggesting a shift in how the elite chose to invest their human and material resources.'45 At the same time, the distribution of these large tombs suggests that the ruling class annexed the tholos tomb as a symbol of power. This does not mean simply that tholoi may at last have become truly royal tombs. The construction of a tholos at Nichoria in LH IIIA2, for example, could be directly associated with its as- similation into the Pylian state. As the site lost its position as an independent center, the status of its leaders may have risen by virtue of their relation- ship to the central administration, and a tholos may 139 Thebes Ug series: J.

It further means that the society is orga- nized enough to control mechanisms for acquiring such goods, and producing objects to offer in ex- change. The imported riches in the Shaft Graves at Mycenae are the first signs of such items reaching Mycenaean Greece, but it is likely that at this stage Minoans, not Mycenaeans, were responsible for Ae- gean access to them. Throughout the Early Myce- naean period very few Aegean objects found abroad are demonstrably mainland products. Crete had the dominant Aegean role in foreign trade, and for mainland Greece itself the Minoan connection was clearly the most significant. Relevant here is the model of secondary state formation, in which a less highly organized society is stimulated to further de- velopment by contact with a more advanced state. In particular, a chief's special access to external pres- tige goods demonstrates and thereby reinforces his superiority to, and authority over, those whom he rules. Wright shows that this model applies well to the contact between mainland Greece and Crete, which is demonstrated by the contents of the Shaft Graves.147 A special link has been posited between Mycenae and the Cretan palace sites, particularly Knossos, but funerary wealth and Cretan contact go hand in hand in Messenia at the same time.'14 In any case, Minoan artistic influence is clear, and for much of the Early Mycenaean period it is difficult to distinguish Minoan from Mycenaean work. Never- theless, for assessing the impact of this relationship on emerging Mycenaean states, this long-standing difficulty is not crucial: the fact of close contact is the point.149 In LH IIB/LM II, however, recognizable Mycenaean artifacts and styles are seen in Crete, mainland burial practices are adopted in the Cre- tan "Warrior Graves," especially in the Knossos area, and Mycenaean administrators are keeping records in Greek at the Palace of Minos itself.15s There is a marked difference between this contin- uum of growth in external contacts, chiefly with Crete, and what we know of Aegean trade in LH IIIA2-LH IIIB. Bronze Age exchange systems have recently received much attention. They took a vari- ety of forms, and only aspects directly relevant to Myce- naean Greek states are summarized here.'" The Mycenaean presence abroad becomes far more ex- tensive than before, by the measures of pottery traded and actual outposts, and signs of Minoan presence simultaneously diminish. Imports from the East show the same shift in the balance of Aegean power: they are much more common in Crete than mainland Greece until LH IIIA2, at which time the situation 146 This discussion does not include burial rituals, which are much the same in different kinds of tombs: Dick- inson (supra n. 6) 228.

Two different views of Mycenaean relations with Europe are presented by J. Bouzek, The Aegean, Ana- tolia and Europe: Cultural Interrelations in the Second Millen- nium B.C. (Prague 1985), who believes the Mycenaeans re- lied on northern sources for such raw materials as amber, and by A.E Harding, The Mycenaeans and Europe (London 1984), who argues that direct contact was minimal; see also B.P.

SHELMERDINE [AJA 101 is reversed.152 More important, the foreign goods found in Greece in LH IIIA-B include royal artifacts, suggesting the possibility of exchange between rul- ers. Nine of the 14 objects from the Aegean inscribed with the cartouche of Amenhotep III or his wife Queen Tiy were found at Mycenae.'53 Most are heir- looms in LH IIIB contexts, but this pharaoh's reign overlaps with LH IIIA1-2, and the presence of ar- tifacts with the royal cartouche may suggest contact with Mycenae at the highest diplomatic level. Sim- ilarly, the cache of lapis lazuli cylinder seals discov- ered in a LH IIIB context in Thebes has been inter- preted by one scholar as a gift from the king Tukulti-Ninurta I of Assyria.'54 The Linear B tablets occasionally refer to textiles (Knossos) and perfumed oil (Pylos) as ke-se-nu-wija Ixenwial. The root suggests a connection with the Clas- sical Greek Svoq, "host, guest, stranger," and thus with the world of hospitality and formal gift ex- change. 55 The term seems to characterize a type or quality of the product; the oil in question (Fr 1231) is actually designated for a goddess. Nor do the tablets contain any direct evidence for extra-kingdom trade, an omission that continues to surprise and to attract various explanations. They do, however, contain hints of foreign contacts.156 Mainland states may not have controlled all of Mycenaean trade with Canaanites, Egyptians, and others, but they did organize the pro- duction of goods for export, not all of them visible in the archaeological record. They also retained the Semitic names of the spices, gold, and ivory they re- ceived, among other commodities, in return. A num- ber of ethnics in the tablets also reflect associations with other lands. Sometimes these appear to be men's names: mi-sa-ra-jo IMisraiosl (Knossos), "Egyptian"; ai- ku-pi-tijo lAiguptiosl (Knossos), "Memphite"; ku-pi-rijo IKupriosl (Knossos, Pylos; also adjectival), and pos- sibly a-ra-sijo IAlagiosl (Knossos, Mycenae), "Cypriot." Some of the dependent textile workers at Pylos (A- series) are groups of women designated by foreign ethnics: a-si-wi-ja I a-*64-ja IAswiail, "Asians," ki-ni-dija IKnidiail, "Knidians," mi-ra-ti-ja IMilaitiail, "Milesians," and ze-pu2-ra3 IZephyrail, "Halikarnassians" (cf. Strabo 14.2.16). These references raise the interesting pos- sibility that Pylos was able to conscript groups of for- eigners into full-time service.'57 Apart from these few textual points, however, the chief evidence for a Mycenaean role in Aegean trade remains the Mycenaean pottery found abroad, especially in Cyprus, Syria-Palestine, Egypt, and Italy.'58 152 E.H. Cline, Sailing the Wine-Dark Sea: International Trade and the Late Bronze Age Aegean (BAR-IS 591, Oxford 1994) 9-10. Cline generally contrasts LH IIIA with LH IIIB, but on pp. xvii, 10-11, and in personal communication he ac- knowledges his belief that the shift takes place in LH IIIA2. 15 E.H. Cline, "Amenhotep III and the Aegean: A Re- assessment of Egypto-Aegean Relations in the 14th Cen- tury B.C.," Orientalia 56 (1987) 1-36; Cline, "An Unpublished Amenhotep III Faience Plaque from Mycenae,"JAOS 110 (1990) 200-12; Cline (supra n. 152) 39 (further references in catalogue); and Cline, "Contact and Trade or Coloniza- tion: Egypt and the Aegean in the 14th-13th Centuries B.C.," Minos 25-26 (1990-1991) 7-36. Also important in as- sessing the relations of this pharaoh with the Aegean is the list of place-names on a statue base from Kom el-Hetan: Cline (supra n. 152) 38-39 (further references in catalogue). 154 E. Porada, "The Cylinder Seals Found at Thebes in Boeotia,' AfO 28 (1981) 1-70, 77, esp. 68-70, 77. Others dis- pute this claim; discussion in Cline (supra n. 152) 25-26 (further references in catalogue). Our appreciation of the way in which Mycenaean Greece was regarded by other political leaders is greatly affected by whether it or any part of it was the entity known as Ahhijawa. On this issue, which falls outside the scope of the present review, see W.-D. Niemeier's forthcoming "Review of Aegean Prehistory VIII" in AJA on the Mycenaeans in Anatolia. 155 The only two certain imports among pottery in the Pylos palace are small stirrup jars, from the perfumed oil storeroom room 32, which appear similar in fabric and quality of decoration to Argolid pottery: Blegen and Raw- son (supra n. 125) 407-408 nos. 411-12, with the explicit suggestion that no. 411 is an Argolid import. 156 Cline (supra n. 152) 128-31 offers a list of "Linear B references to Egypt and the Near East." This heading is misleading; it is actually a list of words in the tablets for which a specific foreign origin can be suggested. Not all the suggestions are equally attractive to a Linear B scholar, and not all imply direct or indirect contact with the place in question. 157 On the status of the female textile workers, see J. Chadwick, "The Women of Pylos," in Studies Bennett 43-95; also among those listed are women from Lemnos (ra-mi- nija), and possibly Khios (ki-si-wi-ja). The masculine forms of"Asian" and "Halikarnassian" also appear: ze-pu2-ro is the name of a Pylian tailor who holds land on Ea 56, while the name a-si-wijola-*64jo, "Aswios," recurs more than once each at Pylos, Knossos, and Mycenae. 158 Also of critical importance to an understanding of Aegean trade are the excavated shipwrecks. That off Point Iria in the Argolid dates to the end of the LH IIIB period, with Cypriot (LC IIIIIIA), Minoan (LM IIIB), and Myce- naean (LH IIIB2) pottery: C. Pennas, Y. Vichos, and Y. Lolos, "Point Iria Wreck 1992," Enalia Annual 1992:4 (1996) 4-5; Pennas, Vichos, and Lolos, "Point Iria Wreck 1993," Enalia Annual 1992:4 (1996) 6-31. On the earlier Uluburun wreck in southern Turkey, see G. Bass, "Evidence of Trade from Bronze Age Shipwrecks," in Gale (supra n. 151) 69-82, and Pulak (supra n. 12), with further bibliography. It ap- pears to have sunk while traveling westward, yet it contains some Mycenaean pottery and swords in addition to large quantities of Cypriot pottery and metal ingots, and Syro- Palestinian amphoras. The combination suggests a generally circular trade route in the eastern Mediterranean, show- ing equal favor to a number of clients.</page><page sequence="27">1997] THE PALATIAL BRONZE AGE 563 Religion and Other State Institutions Relations between Crete and mainland Greece in LH I-II have already been mentioned in the sec- tions above on trade and the development of writ- ing. Several scholars have suggested that the Myce- naeans were equally receptive to Minoan ideas and beliefs. Many institutions of the later states- written administration, religious rituals, perhaps even the Mycenaean form of kingship itself- may reflect the influence of Minoan concepts and prac- tices. However, there is no reason to think in terms of wholesale adoption. The process of reasoned se- lection and adaptation already observed applies equally well to the world of ideas, and the transfor- mation of Middle Helladic chiefdoms into Late Mycenaean polities resulted in a new and distinc- tive culture. Religion has been the most productive area of scrutiny, because Minoan influence there takes a tangible form in iconography (see be- low).'59 Social institutions are harder to discern, but Wright has proposed that a wine-drinking rit- ual was adapted from Crete by the Mycenaeans.160 The ceremony is most clearly depicted in the LM IIIA Campstool Fresco from Knossos, where one man holds a Mycenaean goblet and another a stem restored as a Minoan chalice.61 These are two of the three gold vessel shapes offered to deities on the later Pylos tablet Tn 316, and the fresco itself is similar to the banquet scene depicted in the Py- los megaron. It should be noted, though, that all of the evidence for this ritual belongs to the Mycena- ean period,162 so its Minoan origin is still specula- tion. The chalice itself is a Minoan shape in stone, and its presence in the Shaft Graves demonstrates the Mycenaeans' early interest in it, but there is no evidence from the Cretan Neopalatial period con- cerning the way in which it was used.163 Recent discussions of Minoan influence on main- land religion are also relevant to the institution of kingship, since the Mycenaean king played an im- portant role in religious affairs (see below). Palaima has offered the idea that the later Greek skiptron, or staff of office, goes back to Mycenaean times, and is derived from Crete along with the ideology of the wanax, or king.164 So little evidence exists about Mi- noan rulers that this idea is difficult to evaluate, espe- cially since what we know of later mainland kings presumably represents a substantial transformation into Mycenaean form.'65 It does seem likely, as Wright observes, that Minoan influence on evolving Mycenaean institutions and ideology set the Myce- naean elites apart from the rest of their society.1'" The process of development, however, served equally to distinguish them from their Cretan neighbors. NEW INSCRIPTIONS Recent work at palatial centers has brought to light a number of inscriptions. Those from Tiryns, Thebes (except those from Pelopidou Street), and Mycenae are now conveniently brought together in a single publication, and so do not need a full de- scription here.167 The 24 examples from Tiryns are extremely fragmentary, but the topics are familiar: lists of men, wheels and armor, animals, and land. A number of these come from a LH IIIB2 context in a building with religious significance in the Lower Citadel, but their contents are routinely administra- tive. Ef 2 and Ef 3, from the southeastern part of the Upper Citadel, are land-tenure tablets: one re- fers to ke-ke-me[-na land, a class of landholding also known at Pylos, and the other gives an amount of land in terms of the amount of seed-grain that would be needed to sow it, a convention also known at Py- 159 Rutter 793; C.

This discovery suggests that administrative sys- tems operated in generally similar ways from king- dom to kingdom, though differences in details can be observed as well.168 Published in the same volume is an important cache of 56 sealings at Thebes that comes from a small room in a house on Oidipodos Street.169 The sealings belong to the earlier of two destruction lev- els, with a reported ceramic date near the end of LH IIIB1. The subject of the inscriptions is a variety of animals and other foodstuffs sent to the palace from outlying areas, probably for a state banquet. Still more recently, excavations from 1993 to 1996 under Pelopidou Street have unearthed some 250 tablets, dramatically increasing the number of texts from Thebes.170 The new location, approximately 200 m2 in area, is very near the "Arsenal" site where the Ug tablets had previously been found (fig. 8). The tablets are not in situ, but they are associated with a pavement, in a destruction level reported to date to the second half of the 13th century B.C. The texts deal chiefly with rations, especially wine, figs, and grain. These are given to both men and women, but divine offerings are also attested. The tablets are still undergoing restoration and study, but pre- liminary reports show that they have the capacity to advance our knowledge in several ways, from further attestation and better transliteration of rare syllabograms, to some possible new theonyms and occupational terms. Especially interesting for geo- graphical relations is the term ra-ke-da-mo-ni-jo-u-jo ILakedaimonios huiosl, "son of Lakedaimon," along with three attestations of the ethnic ra-ke-da-mi-ni-jo. A Lake- daimonian connection, even if confined to the pres- ence at Thebes of individuals from that area, raises the issue of interstate relations in an interesting way. Two more tablets were found in 1994 during further exploration of the Arsenal area. The longer docu- ment, TH 149, lists quantities of grain and olives against various names. At least two of these are place- names in the dative-locative: Thebes itself, and e-re- o-ni, thought to represent Eleon, a Boeotian place- name attested in Homer and later authors. Three inscribed sealings now confirm the status of Midea as an administrative center of some kind, though no tablets have yet been found there.

The third fragment, which includes ideograms for honey and unguent, probably goes with previously known Un fragments to comprise a tablet listing banquet sup- plies. Such documents are understood to have spe- cial political and religious importance, so it is espe- cially interesting that the word wanax appears here in the dative (for further discussion, see below). The painted signs and sign groups occasionally found on pottery-usually coarse stirrup jars- belong in a different category from these adminis- trative documents. Ceramic fragments with painted signs are known from Tiryns, Mycenae, Eleusis, Thebes, Gla, and now Midea.173 This new find, MI Z 4, is one of many storage stirrup jars from the LH IIIB2 floor level of room VI in the West Gate area.

SHELMERDINE [AJA 101 ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL ADMINISTRATION Much can be inferred about economic and polit- ical matters from the Linear B tablets, but it is nec- essary to remember that these are concerned exclu- sively with palatial affairs. The tablets existed as an aide-memoire for the central administration, and they say nothing explicit about any activities not un- der its control. A further limiting factor is that the tablets we possess refer to a single year-the last before the destruction that baked and preserved them. Scholars must generalize from these tablets to develop any picture of Mycenaean economy in LH IIIB, without clear knowledge of how represen- tative they are of the 13th century B.C. as a whole. Political Organization The Linear B tablets contain a number of titles with clear political significance. The relative hier- archical position of a few officials has been known since before the publication of the second edition of Ventris and Chadwick's Documents in Mycenaean Greek, but the status of others remains uncertain. As usual, most of our information from the main- land comes from the Pylos archive, but we have noth- ing to suggest that other kingdoms were organized differently. The paramount figure is the wanax, and second in importance is the ra-wa-ke-ta Ilawagetiisl, "leader of the people." Among the figures at a lower level are the qa-si-re-u Igwasileusl (see below), the e-qe- ta Ihekwetasl, "companion" (presumably of the king), the te-re-ta Itelestasl, "officials," and the ko-re-te Ikoretirl and po-ro-ko-re-te Iprokorit-rl, "mayor" and "vice-mayor" of the 16 major economic districts of the kingdom. Beyond this much remains uncertain. In particular, despite much fruitful debate over the last 20 years, there is not a single official about whose functions all are in complete agreement. Discussion has fo- cused principally on the first three figures listed above. The wanax presents less difficulty than the others, yet the extent even of his responsibilities is not fully understood: we cannot with certainty demonstrate for him a judicial or a military role, or that of an international statesman."75 He seems, however, to have had a presiding role in religious affairs (infra), and the designation of certain craftsmen as "royal" suggests either that they served his personal or pro- fessional requirements, or that he had particularly direct authority over one branch of the palatial workforce."76 In addition, he makes an official ap- pointment on Pylos tablet Ta 711, and few would deny that he has secular as well as religious authority.177 Debate on the status and responsibilities of other officials is still less conclusive, even when the title is transparently Greek, like qa-si-re-u Igwasileusl (cf. Classical Greek Poats6q) or ra-wa-ke-ta Ilawagetaisl (cf. Classical Greek kayCTaq, from hadq + ,yo0). On the Pylos Jn tablets three gwasileis act as overseers of working groups of bronzesmiths. Most of the groups in this series do not have an overseer, and it is not clear why only three are thus provided."17 More frequently attested is the derivative qa-si-re- wi-ja Igwasileial. Three such groups, designated by the name of the man responsible for them, receive ra- tions on Pylos tablet Fn 50 (cf. also Fn 867.3). For Carlier, the presence of religious personnel on both tablets is significant, suggesting that gwasileis played a role in religious affairs.179 Nonreligious recipients are listed as well, however, so the inference seems unwarranted. As for the lawagetas, it has been tra- ditional to view him as second in power to the king, and a military leader. The first point has not been challenged, but some scholars have recently pointed out, rightly I believe, that there is no necessary con- nection of this official to military matters.18" The larger political questions of importance are what kind of polity the Mycenaean state was, and how directly it was controlled by the king and his palace officials. In this context "political" control is hardly separable from economic control, and one must turn to the realm of economic administration for the partial answers reached to date. In general, 175 For an even more pessimistic view of our ability to interpret this and other titles, see J.T. Hooker, "Titles and Functions in the Pylian State," in Studies Chadwick 257-67. On the wanax, see P. Carlier, La royaut? en Grece avant Alex- andre (Strasbourg 1984) pt. 1, esp. 44-101; several papers in Palaima, forthcoming (supra n. 119) and in Rehak. 176 Carlier (supra n. 175) 63-72 prefers the first alter- native. 177 As Hooker (supra n. 175) 258-59 and others have noted, it is not possible to prove that the term wanax always refers to a single individual, or even that it always refers to a human rather than a divine lord. Each student of the tablets must develop a personal view; my own is that wanax always does signify the king. Another question is whether or not the man e-ke-ra2-wo IEnkhelidw6nl is the wanax of Py- los at the time of the tablets. For a recent argument in sup- port of this view, see Palaima, in Rehak (supra n. 119) 129-35, passim. 178 P. Carlier, "Qa-si-re-u et qa-si-re-wi-ja," in Politeia 355-64; Carlier (supra n. 175) 108-16. 179 Carlier (supra n. 178) 359, 360-61, 364; Carlier does bring other evidence to bear also, but none of it seems conclusive. 180 Carlier (supra n. 175) 106-107; Hooker (supra n. 175) 262.</page><page sequence="31">1997] THE PALATIAL BRONZE AGE 567 there is a growing trend toward acknowledging that the authority of state officials is not absolute, and that considerable activity went on, at least in the Py- los kingdom where records are most plentiful, in- dependent of palatial control.181 Economic Administration The economic themes reflected in the tablets are, generally speaking, limited to agricultural produc- tion, taxation, industries (the manufacture and dis- tribution of goods, chiefly goods of high economic status), and personnel. To a greater or lesser degree, all these topics are better understood today than they were 20 years ago, and together they form a fairly coherent picture of Mycenaean administration. There is widespread agreement that the Mycenaean palatial sites were redistributive centers, taking in a variety of commodities from their dependencies, storing them centrally, and allocating them (or prod- ucts made from them) again within the kingdom. The tablets document each stage: the collection of goods, the allocation of resources to dependent work- ers, and the distribution of a variety of commodi- ties. Redistributive economies may be primarily al- truistic, pooling needed or desirable goods and services to ensure widespread access to them, or the motive may be rather to mobilize such resources up- ward to the elite. In the case of the Mycenaeans both impulses may have been at work, though the Linear B evidence is slanted toward concerns of the central elite, so that we observe only the economic activity that it dominates.182 The complex, even inconsistent, details hinted at in the texts are a further deterrent to understanding. A redistributive economy is nor- mally viewed as an alternative to a market economy, in which the relative values of different commodi- ties make market exchange possible. Yet the Myce- naean equivalent of Classical Greek ipiaoaOt, "buy," is used at Knossos with reference to human beings.183 There are also a few cases where the value of one commodity is expressed in terms of others in what appear to be payment records: cloth is val- ued in terms of wheat and figs (Pylos Un 1322), and alum in terms of several commodities (Pylos An 35, Un 443.1).184 Thus, it does not appear that staples and prestige goods were handled in completely sep- arate exchange systems, as happens in some cul- tures.'85 Nevertheless, the overall picture is clear: the palace was the focal point of a redistributive sys- tem, mobilizing both goods and services. It exercised minimal control over the production of staple goods, though it acquired these selectively for such uses as ration payments to workers and suppliers. By con- trast, it did directly oversee the production of par- ticular agricultural resources, such as flax for the linen industry, and over the industrial processes themselves. Animal husbandry and agricultural production. Records of livestock indicate that the palace con- trolled large flocks and herds. The prominence of records pertaining to sheep at Knossos is due to the importance of the wool industry there, and listings of thousands of animals (more than 19,200 on Dn 1088 alone) are without parallel on the mainland. The Pylos archive also records extensive holdings of sheep and goats, and refers as well to other im- portant animals like oxen.'8is6 Much of the direct written evidence for agricultural production con- cerns grapevines, figs, olives, and grain, particularly one variety of wheat.'87 A recent study by Palmer has clarified both the place of wine in the economy, and documents relating to the assessment of vines and the collection and distribution of the finished prod- uct.188 The bulk of our information comes from Pylos, but the meager evidence from Knossos and Mycenae is consistent with it. Palmer shows that wine was a high-status item, stored perhaps at outlying centers as well as in the Wine Magazine (rooms 104- 181 For good discussions of the issue, with further ref- erences, seeJ.

Even if only some of the storage jars in room 105 contained wine, the sealings found in the building (four of 50 inscribed with the wine ideogram) mark deliveries by those who owned the seals. Wine also figures along with other high-status commodities like meat and honey in lists of elite ban- queting supplies and offerings to the gods. Among documents related to agriculture, landholding rec- ords are particularly numerous at Pylos (E- series), and they indicate a close reciprocal relationship be- tween land tenure and obligations on the part of the holders to provide agricultural produce or ser- vices. So much is clear, but debate continues on the precise nature of the various kinds of plots themselves, and of the obligations associated with them.'89 Taxation. The tablets record the flow of selected staple goods into the palace through taxes on the production of various commodities. The bulk of our information comes from Pylos, where the Ma series records assessments, collections and deficits of hides, honey, locally made cloth, and other goods not se- curely identified. A consensus has emerged that these collections were organized from the top down: that is, an overall assessment was levied on each of the two provinces into which the kingdom was divided, and the tax burden then distributed among regional subsections of these provinces.190 Halstead stresses the decentralized nature of this system, and the dis- interest of the administration in the production of the commodities taxed.'19 He includes in this char- acterization the assessment records of flax (N- series), but here the level of detail is much greater than in the regular tax records of the Ma series. The fore- casts of flax contributions in the Na records refer to individual towns, not whole districts, and Nn 831 goes into detail about the obligations of specific in- dividuals in one such town.192 This greater degree of interest is at variance with the Ma series, and it is appropriate for an industry under direct palatial control. Industries. Several recent studies have clarified the industrial activities supervised by the central ad- ministration. These chiefly involved bronze-working and the production of prestige goods like perfumed oil and fine textiles. The control of most industries appears highly centralized, and most operate in a redistributive fashion referred to as the ta-ra-sija Italasial, or "allotment" system (cf. Classical Greek TaaaoJia, "an amount [of wool] weighed out and al- located for processing"). Under this system the pal- ace brought in the necessary raw materials for an industry and allocated them to craftsmen. The term ta-ra-sija appears at Pylos in theJn series, which lists bronzesmiths with and without an allotment of bronze, and at other sites in records of textiles (Knos- sos, Mycenae) and chariot wheels (Knossos).193 The only extant bronze collection record (Jn 829) seems to be a tax document, recording contributions of bronze from almost the same districts named in the Ma series. Archaeological evidence that the palace redistributed lump bronze to smiths around the king- dom comes from Nichoria. If the identification with ti-mi-to-a-ke-e is correct, Nichoria is one of the places with palatial smiths in residence. A LH IIIB2 smithy there, contemporary with the Pylos tablets, shows evidence of remelting and reworking of bronze, rather than the smelting of copper and its alloying with tin.194 In the oil industry raw materials are similarly dis- tributed to perfumers on several tablets from the Archives Complex at Pylos.195 These tablets shed some light on the manufacturing process, which re- sembles that described in later Greek recipes.

These tablets describe the oil both by variants of the oil ideogram and by adjectives like pa-ko-we Isphakowenl, "sage-scented"; wo-do-we Iwordowenl, "rose- scented"; and e-ti-we lertiwenl, "henna-dyed." The ma- jority were found in room 23, one of two oil store- rooms behind the megaron. Large storage jars set into benches along the walls contained oil, as is clear from residue found in and around them and from the intensity of the fire in this area at the time of the destruction.'96 Twelve twists of clay also pre- served by the fire show that tablets were actually fash- ioned and written here.197 Other perfume tablets come from room 32, a well-finished storeroom, and from a location upstairs, above room 38. The Fr tab- lets together constitute a scribal department con- cerned with the perfumed oil industry."98 Many of the entries are allocations, most of a religious char- acter, but there are also disbursements to "attendants" who may well be secular, while still other tablets are inventory records. Several scribes wrote the tablets concerned; each handled a specific variant of the oil ideogram, and for the most part each is repre- sented in only one room. The notable exception is Hand 2, who has a greater range of responsibilities, and whose tablets appear in all three storerooms. He also wrote a transaction of oil within the depart- ment, Fr 1184, which was found in the Archives Com- plex. Thus, he seems to have been the head of this administrative department, in which other scribes had very specific assignments, so that each could be readily held accountable for the oil on which he reported. The textile industry is equally central to the Myce- naean economy, and tablets referring to it were found at Thebes and Mycenae as well as Knossos and Py- los. The Cretan sheep and wool texts have received the most attention, particularly from John Killen, who has also made some comparative observations about the Pylian industry.'9 It is interesting that production is centralized here to a greater degree than at Knossos. Specialized personnel are located at a small number of places, chiefly Pylos itself, and there are small outlying groups of less-specialized workers, one of them at the probable capital of the Further Province, Leuktron. The textile records from Thebes and most of those from Mycenae concern wool that has been delivered to the center, and is being disbursed for further treatment.20z At each site the relevant tablets were found in buildings that apparently served as clearinghouses for wool. Like the Wine Magazine at Pylos, these central collection and storage points complement the ample textual evidence for the redistributive system at work. What happened to the goods produced by these industries? In Halstead's view, the tablets are much less informative about the disbursement of finished products than about the previous stages of the in- dustries,201 but actually, plenty of textual evidence exists for the use of these products within the king- dom. The Pylos Fr records of the disbursement of perfumed oil have already been mentioned, and Jn 829 earmarks collected bronze for the manufac- ture of spearpoints and arrowheads. These weapons are presumably for local use, like the chariots being manufactured and repaired in the Northeast Work- shop.202 On three texts associated with this workshop, the term e-qe-sijol-ja is applied to wheels (as it is else- where to cloth). The adjective derives from the term e-qe-ta Ihekwettisl, "companion (of the king)," and may designate elite goods of a kind belonging to or suit- able for such officials. Halstead is correct, however, in that there is al- most no textual evidence for the deployment of such prestige goods outside the kingdom.203 Yet perfume 196 Blegen and Rawson (supra n. 125) 135-36. 197 Blegen and Rawson (supra n. 125) 137, fig. 267 nos. 1-7. 198 The term was introduced by J.-P. Olivier, Les scribes de Cnossos (Incunabula graeca 17, Rome 1967) 8, 125, to char- acterize a group of tablets linked by findspot, scribal hand, and content to form an office; a department is a group of related offices. 19 J.T.

Chadwick, The Thebes Tablets II (Minos Suppl. 4, Salamanca 1975) published the Theban records; two recent studies that include the Mycenae ma- terial are Varias Garcia (supra n. 24) and Tournavitou (supra n. 23). C.W. Shelmerdine, "Workshops and Record Keep- ing in the Mycenaean World," in Betancourt and Laffineur (supra n. 58) considers the material from each site in re- lation to its archaeological context, which in each case is interpreted as a clearinghouse rather than a workshop. On the general topic of prehistoric textiles, E.J.W. Barber, Prehistoric Textiles: The Development of Cloth in the Neolithic and Bronze Ages, with Special Reference to the Aegean (Prince- ton 1991) is an invaluable resource for future studies. 201 Halstead, in PCPS (supra n. 181) 62. 202 The most recent study of the Northeast Workshop, with references to earlier works, is R. Schon, "Chariot Man- ufacture and the Organization of Industry at Pylos," in Betancourt and Laffineur (supra n. 58). 203 The Mycenaeans' own written evidence is discussed briefly above. Foreign textual evidence, apart from the Kom el-Hetan statue base (supra n. 153), depends largely on the equation of Mycenaean Greece with Ahhijawa (supra n. 154). Killen 264 outlines the few possible tablet refer- ences to external transactions.</page><page sequence="34">570 CYNTHIA W. SHELMERDINE [AJA 101 was clearly an important trade item: the stirrup jars that functioned as oil containers are tangible signs of this commodity, and they are heavily represented among Mycenaean pottery found abroad. It is as- sumed that textiles too were offered in trade, in re- turn for the metals, spices, ivory, and other raw materials that the Mycenaeans were interested in importing.204 Indeed, the reticence of the tablets is so much at variance with the archaeological evidence that it has tempted some to assume that records of foreign exchange were kept on leather or some other material that perished in the very fires that preserved the tablets.205 It is worth noting that the largest ex- tant archive - that from Pylos - dates to the very end of LH IIIB when trade was dramatically reduced from its heyday of LH IIIA2-B1. Even under this circum- stance, however, the production of elite goods re- mained, on present archival evidence, a high priority. Most of the people who worked in these industries were fully dependent on the palace for their up- keep.206 In some cases the records of their support are extant: for instance, the Pylos Ab series records food rations allocated to textile workers and their children, and the Pylos Fn series lists rations given to other personnel. The tablets also provide a few hints, however, that some work may have been done by more independent workers, who received goods in return for their services.207 Such indications sup- port a growing awareness that, although our written evidence is limited to palace business, a wider eco- nomic sphere existed in the Mycenaean world that the palaces did not control.208 RELIGION A fair amount of textual, iconographical, and ar- tifactual evidence can be cited for Mycenaean reli- gion, but it has always been difficult to interpret,209 in part because the various sources point in differ- ent directions. Linear B texts link the Late Bronze Age to later Greek religion, recording a similar pan- theon and range of offerings. Iconography, on the other hand, particularly in Early Mycenaean glyptic art, echoes the symbols of Minoan religion -without, however, indicating whether the beliefs behind them were also adopted on the mainland. Until recently, little attention was paid to the third source of evi- dence: archaeological remains of cult sites and ar- tifacts. New finds and new interpretations have im- proved this situation in the 1980s and 1990s, so that more can now be said about where the Mycenaeans worshipped, and a little about the forms their rit- uals may have taken. These topics are addressed here; for information about the gods themselves, older bibliographical sources are still valid.210 Cult Places Cult environments range from separate shrines at palatial and other urban sites to simple open-air settings, and it has been proposed that rituals also took place in the megaron itself. Some see in this diversity a distinction between official and popular, or urban and rural, religion; others interpret it as a continuum from the humblest expressions of piety up to elaborate celebrations at the center of state power. We begin with public or urban shrines at pa- latial and other sites, where it is easiest to identify the trappings of cult.211 The two shrine complexes most often discussed are the cult center at Mycenae and the sanctuary at Phylakopi on Melos. Though the latter site lies outside mainland Greece, it is use- ful for purposes of analogy since the installation and its contents conform closely to those on the mainland.212 204 Halstead, in PCPS (supra n. 181) 63 on exports. 205Shelmerdine (supra n. 195) 139-41.

Cult center. (Photo C.W. Shelmerdine) Mycenae. Most of the complex at Mycenae was built and used only in LH IIIB.213 Though the Tsountas House shrine may have been built in LH IIIA2, the Temple, the Room with the Fresco, and the Megaron all postdate the construction of the South House in mature LH IIIB1.214 Some alter- ations were made to the area in LH IIIB2, perhaps after an earthquake, and a final destruction took place at the end of that period. A brief summary of the most significant remains may serve to intro- duce most of the tangible elements of Mycenaean cult. The Tsountas House shrine lies on the upper of three terraces (fig. 10).215 A bolster-shaped altar in front of a bench belongs to the first of two phases. The altar has a hollow extension on the western side; a runnel leads from it to ajar in the floor, suggesting that it was used for libations.216 A miniature kylix and a flat dish (FS 322) also belong to this phase. The Temple lies in the center of the complex, and is entered from the south. A low dais occupies the middle of the main room, and at the back is a series of stepped benches or platforms. These apparently served as altars, in the sense of offering places, for a clay tripod offering table was found at the north- east corner of the bench, next to a large female idol embedded in the bench. These were the only finds from the room, but a cache of large clay human and snake figurines was found in a small sealed room up a flight of stairs, andjoining fragments came from a triangular area behind the main room. Drinking vessels and bowls were also found in the building. The building containing the Room with the Fresco lies west of the Temple. The fresco in question dec- orated the southern part of the east wall of the room (fig. 11). In front of it was a platform of clay and rubble; a Minoan-style painting of horns of conse- cration above a row of circles decorates the top of its north face. The upper surface of the platform at the west end forms a ledge shaped into three shal- 213 W.D.

Ash in the discs suggests that this platform too functioned as an altar.217 The lower register of the fresco beside this altar depicts a female, prob- ably divine, and an animal restored as a griffin. Above the altar the upper register depicts two females, also thought to represent deities, in an architectural set- ting. They wear long robes of different types; one holds a sword and the other a staff, and between them hover two small human silhouettes.218 In the center of the room is a large elliptical hearth, and a bench runs along the south side. A number of objects were found in the fill of the bench, including kylikes, cups and cooking pots, worked ivories, and a faience plaque of Amenophis III. The adjacent room 32 may have been a shrine or a related storage area.219 The former interpretation is supported by the discovery of a terracotta figurine, probably a divine image, on a dais in the southwestern corner. In front of it was a pile of glass paste beads. However, the room also contained storage debris such as worked and un- worked ivory fragments, and a variety of pottery. The variety in orientation and contents of these three buildings suggests that they served different deities, but there is a certain consistency in the cult installations themselves. The main rooms all contain a low central raised area. That in the Room with the Fresco was a hearth, while the dais in the Temple and the altar in the Tsountas House shrine show no trace of burning, and both have been tied to liba- tions.220 Another common feature is one or more benches or platforms, where offerings were placed. Large figures and small figurines are the most com- mon offerings found in religious locales.221 The ex- amples from Mycenae are all large enough to be 217 Taylour 1969 (supra n. 213) 94; P.

The large (50-60 cm tall) "grotesques," hollow human figures of both female and ambiguous gender, probably de- pict celebrants rather than deities.222 Two smaller (ca. 30 cm tall) female figurines found with them are carefully shaped and finely painted. These figurines and the similar example from room 32 could represent goddesses. The third type found at Mycenae consists of the snake figures from the Temple. Tiryns. Several cult areas were identified at Tiryns in addition to the megaron: the earliest date to LH IIIB2.22" Three deposits in the Upper Citadel are little more than concentrations of figurines. At the north end of the colonnaded court above the east- ern galleries, human and animal figurines were found with a few other artifacts.224 More diverse is a group of material thought to come from pits 10 and 17 of the Geometric bothros, south of court XXX.225 In addition to Psi-figurines, this cache contains two ani- mal rhyta, a miniature throne, and a figurine per- haps depicting a person on a bed. Most extensive is a deposit from the so-called epichosis-complex, in the southern part of the palace quarters. This ma- terial included several rhyta, five models of thrones, 56 female figurines, and 126 miniature vessels.226 The installations in the Lower Citadel are better preserved. Casement room 7 in the fortification wall was a LH IIIB2 cult room, as is clear from debris accumulated outside in the courtyard- more than 239 Psi-figurines, two larger figures (30 + cm), sev- eral representations of thrones and chariots, and two animal rhyta.27 Building VI nearby seems to date from the same period. It contained an altar and ani- mal rhyta in room 123, and Kilian therefore inter- preted it as the house of the priestess of the cult practiced in room 7. However, Linear B tablets were found in a pit at the end of the corridor in building VI; they are thought to have fallen from a room above room 130, which connects to building VI on the east.228 Among the subjects are lists of personnel and chariot wheels, and the complex is clearly part of the palace administration. A cult building also stood in the Lower Citadel during the post-palatial era. R 117 was a small one-room structure built in LH IIIC Early against the interior of the fortification wall. This simple building had a bench at the rear and a column in the center of the room, as well as three columns outside the entrance. R 110 was sub- sequently built, without columns, directly above the ruins of R 117 in LH IIIC Developed; the two-room structure R 10a in turn replaced R 110. At this point a hearth occupied the center of the main room. In each phase the building had a bench at the back, on which clay figures were found. These portray a known type of female deity with upraised arms; head- dresses are preserved in some cases, as well as applied and painted jewelry and other painted decoration. Other cult paraphernalia include rhyta, miniature and regular-sized vessels, and animal bones in ash layers. Pylos. The small room 93 northeast of the Main Building at Pylos has been interpreted as a shrine.229 Plowing had obliterated the floor level and only a few artifacts were found in the room. Among the chance finds is a miniature kylix. Essential to the identifica- tion of this room as a shrine is a stuccoed block a few meters to the southeast in court 92, which the excavators thought was an altar.231 Phylakopi. The sanctuary at Phylakopi also con- sists of more than one building; the West Shrine was built during LH IIIA2, and the small East Shrine was added in LH IIIB.23' The sanctuary continued as before in LH IIIC. Bench altars in both shrines hold small human and animal figurines and chariot groups, as well as large wheelmade bovids and hu- man figures. Of the human figures, the elaborately shaped and decorated "Lady of Phylakopi" is unique at this site.232 Other figures are clearly delineated as male or female, down to their genitalia. There 222 A.

Konsolaki) is some duplication of types in the two shrines, but within the West Shrine the genders are separated: male figures are associated with the northwest altar, and female figures with those in the northeast and southwest corners. The range of figures and figurines is closer to that at Tiryns than to the assemblage from Mycenae. The Lady of Phylakopi, though rather large (45 cm tall), resembles the three finer figurines from Mycenae and their counterparts from Tiryns, but no parallels exist here for the "grotesques" from Myce- nae. Phylakopi is unique in having clearly male idols, but some figurines from the newly discovered shrine at Ayios Konstantinos on Methana are interpreted as male (see below). Other indoor cult areas. A few other sites have cult places, all with features similar to those just de- scribed. House shrines are reported at both Asine and Berbati. The shrine in Asine House G dates to LH IIIC. Pottery, female figurines, and a larger head (the "Lord ofAsine," now understood as female) were found near a bench in the corner near the entrance at the north end of the room, which also contained two centrally placed column bases. A thick layer of ash and bones extended from near the bench along the east long wall.233 A deliberately broken jug was fixed upside down at the east end of the bench, sug- gesting that libations were offered there. Two rooms in the Potter's Quarter at Berbati also had bench al- tars in LH IIIB.234 In room A, a broken amphora and a clay spoon were found on the bench, and a Psi-figurine in the fill above. Room B, a subsequent construction, has the more interesting installation: a channel formed by two rows of stones, with part of a large kylix wedged under smaller blocking stones at one end. In addition, a separate room to the north (room C) features a pictorial krater fixed in the floor, its bottom pierced. The work at Ayios Konstantinos on Methana is too recent to have been much discussed in print yet, and I only highlight here a few salient features of the shrine (fig. 12).235 All of the finds in this build- ing complex date to LH IIIA-B; the pottery includes 233 R.

The main room A, oriented east-west, features a stepped bench in the northwest corner, a platform along the south wall, and a hearth in the southeast corner. Near the south- west corner a broken jar neck on the floor may have been a receptacle for libations; a rhyton, cup, and dipper were found with it. About 150 figurines were associated with the bench in the northwest part of the room. Many are bovids, but a number of rare types are also present, including chariot groups, hel- meted riders on horseback, and people driving and riding oxen (fig. 13). The human figures are pre- sumed from their activities to be male. The absence of female figurines, apart from one Psi-type with a hollow stem, is notable. Finally, a LH IIIA2 Early deposit at Tsoungiza may be mentioned here (fig. 14).236 It is a dump below the crown of the hill, with which no architectural remains are associated, but the contents are thought to have come from a structure higher up. The lower half of a figure was found here, along with numer- ous human and animal figurines, including two rep- resentations of breadmakers. Additional finds in- clude a limited range of pottery, chiefly kylikes and bowls, and animal bones. Outdoor cult areas. Traces occasionally remain of ritual activity conducted in the open air. The only certain Mycenaean cult installations predating LH III are those at the later site of the sanctuary of Apollo Maleatas at Epidauros.237 The Early Mycenaean re- mains have been described by Rutter.238 In LH IIIA-B the large Early Mycenaean open-air altar ter- race on the hilltop continues in use, with an exten- sion to the east.

Among the other LH III offerings were large and small bovid figures, Psi- and Phi-figurines, and small horse figurines, includ- ing one from a chariot group. Only a few meters away from the altar terrace is a settlement with three lay- ers of Mycenaean habitation (above two of EH date). Thus, despite its lofty location on Mt. Kynortion, this installation is not a remote peak sanctuary of Mi- noan type. Two more open-air cult places of the palatial period are known, both in the vicinity of Tiryns. One site is a surface deposit found near a chapel of Ayia Triada near Klenies, and the other is a cave on Profitis Elias near Ayios Adrianos.239 The Klenies deposit comprises 123 Phi-figurines of middle LH IIIB style, three animal figurines, an animal rhyton, and pot- tery, including some deliberately broken drinking vessels. A naked male figurine was originally re- ported, but is now lost. The Profitis Elias cave lies near a LH IIIB building on the hilltop. No figurines were found there, but cookpots, a cup, and kylikes (some broken) lay on the floor and on a natural rock bench. A more elaborate outdoor cult area is also attested in the late LH IIIB or IIIC period at Amyk- lai, with finds similar to those from earlier indoor shrines and from Epidauros, including many female and animal figurines and some figures.240 The LH III iconographical evidence for the ap- pearance of cult areas consists of a number of fresco fragments depicting shrine facades.241 Several ele- ments recalling Minoan shrine features appear on 239 Kilian, in Haigg and Nordquist (supra n. 223) 185-93, with references. Finds of figurines and rhyta at Delphi sug- gest the existence of a cult place, probably of the outdoor type, but none has been located: Muiller (supra n. 63) 475-86.

The last two designs recur on the side of the bench by the fresco in room 31 at Mycenae (see above, fig. 11). Two of the Pylos facades are crowned by pairs of ani- mals, 1 A 2 by sphinxes and 2 A 2 by lions. The Linear B tablets use several words for shrine, and make ref- erence to particular cult places in the Pylos area, but no information is offered about their layout or contents.242 Cult Practices Certain ritual practices can be deduced from the layout and contents of cult places: the offering of figurines/figures and other objects, libations, and ani- mal sacrifices. Frescoes and Linear B texts reinforce the archaeological evidence, and extend the range of information beyond it, particularly on ritual pro- cessions and ritual feasting. The most widely attested practice is the offering of various objects, particu- larly animal and human figures and figurines. Not all of the large anthropomorphic figures represent deities. To date, the "grotesques" from Mycenae are unique, and seem to represent worshippers. The hands, in various positions, are thought to have held either actual offerings, such as jewelry, or clay rep- licas of them.243 Some of the other figures from var- ious sites, more finely shaped and decorated, may also stand for human celebrants. One type, however, certainly depicts the goddess with upraised arms, and it is easy enough to picture such an image draped with or holding offerings. These figures clearly overlap in function with the more common small figurines, which were some- times placed on benches in the same way, often in the same shrines. Comparison of their distributions, however, shows that the figurines had a wider range of uses.244 Figurines (human and animal) appear in tombs as funerary offerings, and were also deposited near hearths and doorways, where they perhaps served an apotropaic function.245 They are the only offerings, apart from cookpots and drinking vessels, in the simplest cult places like Berbati, Klenies, and the Profitis Elias cave. It has been argued that this restricted ritual assemblage represents a popular level of cult, as opposed to official cult places where figures and figurines appear together, along with ani- mal figures and figurines, small clay models of fur- niture, rhyta, and miniature and full-sized vessels.246 If the range of offerings is the basis for such a dis- tinction, location is not: official cult attributes occur both at palatial sites (Mycenae, Tiryns) and elsewhere (Phylakopi, Asine),247 both indoors and outdoors (Epidauros), both during the palatial period and afterward (Tiryns, Phylakopi, Amyklai). Some frescoes show offerings of various kinds be- ing carried in procession. Objects depicted include flowers (Thebes, Pylos), vessels of metal, stone, and clay (Mycenae, Tiryns, Thebes), boxes or pyxides (Mycenae, Tiryns), trays (Pylos), a necklace (Myce- nae), and a frame or table (Pylos).248 Figures or figurines have also recently been identified in pro- cession frescoes from Mycenae and Tiryns. After the procession, such offerings might have been placed on a bench in a shrine, though the figurine of a cel- ebrant actually embedded in a bench in the Temple 18-19 no. 24, pl. 1.1; 137-38 no. 194, pl.

The range of terms is strik- ing: ije-ro Ihieronl, "temple" (Knossos, Pylos); wo-(i-)ko Iwoikosl and *do I*do(n)/, "house" (Knossos, Pylos, Thebes); *e-do Ihedosi, "seat" (Pylos). 243 One of the figures from Mycenae is shown actually holding an ax-hammer, and French long ago suggested that others may have held necklaces: Taylour 1970 (supra n. 213) 277; French (supra n. 221) 173; Moore (supra n. 222); and Hagg (supra n. 217). 244 In my view, French (supra n. 221) 173 is right to in- sist that figurines take their function from their context, not the other way around. On figurines, see also E.B. French, "The Development of Mycenaean Figurines," BSA 66 (1971) 101-87. 245 Kilian (supra n. 5) 148, fig. 16. 246 On official and popular cults, see R.

Wright (supra n. 236) 72-73 prefers to view the various manifestations of Mycenaean religion as a con- tinuum rather than a series of levels. 247 In addition to the sites discussed here, there is a head from Nichoria, probably to be associated with a LH IIIB2 building: H.

SHELMERDINE [AJA 101 at Mycenae shows that not all idols were carried in processions.249 Among the vessels carried in the frescoes are two that from their yellow color appear to be made of gold.250 Highly relevant, therefore, is Pylos tablet Tn 316, which itemizes donations of a gold vessel and a man to several gods, and a gold vessel and a woman to goddesses. It was once sug- gested, well before the cumulative archaeological and iconographical evidence for the offering of figures and figurines was as substantial as it is now, that the "people" were actually figurines.25' The verb used, however, is i~y0, not (qpwo, so they should be led and not carried as figurines would be. The conventional view is preferable, that the men and women referred to are real people, marked for sacrifice or for a life of service to a deity, or simply detailed to carry the vessels. Another notable offering mentioned in the tablets is perfumed oil. The majority of Fr tab- lets from Pylos list disbursements of perfume to deities and sanctuaries, and for two festivals, one of which takes place at pa-ki-ja-na and is associated with Poseidon.252 In only one case (Fr 1225) is the purpose of the oil stated: it was to serve as ointment for clothing.253 The procession frescoes and the tablets bring us into the Mycenaean palace proper, and to the high- est level of official cult- that associated with the pa- latial elite, and in particular the wanax. Indeed, the presentation of offerings has been directly linked to the megaron itself, and so have the two other rit- uals detectable in the archaeological record, libation and animal sacrifice. In addition to the rhyta discov- ered at a number of cult places, permanent instal- lations discussed above at Mycenae (Tsountas House shrine), Asine, and Berbati clearly point to the pour- ing of libations.254 In the porch of the megaron at Mycenae an alabaster slab beside a low rounded al- tar has a shallow oval depression that Hagg suggests may also have been for this purpose.255 This evi- dence gives a meaningful context to the two round depressions, joined by a channel, in the floor next to the cutting for a throne in the Pylos megaron. This arrangement has long been tied to libations, and the relevance of a painting of a stone jug on the dado immediately above has recently been observed.256 HSigg believes that tripod offering tables may have been receptacles for libations, and that kylikes, like rhyta, were used as libation vessels.57 Significant for his argument is a pair of miniature kylikes found lying on an offering table in the Pylos megaron.258 Both miniature and standard kylikes are common in cult contexts; indeed, drinking vessels and bowls are the only offerings besides figurines found in the humblest shrines. Hagg also associates libations with animal sacrifice, which is clearly attested by the ac- cumulation of animal bones in ash layers at Asine, Phylakopi, and Epidauros.259 While the slaughtering of animals may represent 249 Kilian, in Higg and Marinatos (supra n. 223) 49.

Similarly, the kylix may be used for libations, but it is also the Myce- naean drinking vessel par excellence. A growing body of evidence suggests that communal feasting was an important feature of Mycenaean culture, and it may thus be only a question of terminology whether one views animal bones in ash layers, and kylikes in cult settings, as evidence for sacrifice and libations or for ritual meals.260 In addition to the accumulations of animal bones already mentioned, others have been directly tied to such feasts. One example comes from LH IIIC levels of the Tiryns Lower Citadel, where animal bones were found in the courtyard outside the cult building.261 Another is the LH IIIA2 deposit at Tsoungiza, where the discard pattern of animal bones is consistent with feasting.262 This archaeological evidence is significantly aug- mented by references to banquet supplies in the Linear B texts. The liquid component of the ban- quet may be discernible in the gold vessels brought to deities on Tn 316, the Pylos tablet mentioned above. The three shapes listed are the conical cup, the gob- let or kylix, and the chalice. The last two were asso- ciated even in the Early Mycenaean period with rit- ual drinking, and appear in the LM IIIA Campstool Fresco from Knossos, which has been interpreted as a ceremonial drinking scene. The 56 inscribed sealings found at Thebes in 1982 document animals (sheep, goats, pigs, and oxen) and two other food- stuffs coming into the palace. It has been demon- strated that the types and numbers of the animals, and some of the terminology, are remarkably sim- ilar to those on Pylos tablets Un 2 and Un 138, which list animals and various other edibles.263 It is very likely that the commodities listed are ingredients for a state banquet: the heading of Un 2 reveals the kind of occasion that would prompt such a feast. It refers to a special ceremony at pa-kija-na, which the king either undergoes or presides over.264 Pa-ki- ja-na is an important Pylian sanctuary, and the pro- posed interpretation of its name as Isphagianal, "place of slaughter," takes on new relevance in the light of evidence for the slaughter and ritual consumption of animals.265 A recent find from Pylos further links such banquets to the king. A fragment unearthed from Blegen's dump in 1995 has been associated with several fragmentary tablets of the Un series, all pre- viously known. If the joins prove correct, the result- ing tablet, while still incomplete, includes the word wanax in the dative, above a list of commodities, in- cluding wheat and barley, an ox, honey, unguent, and figs. It is hard to see here anything but another list of banquet supplies. Killen has identified similar lists at Knossos, so it appears that ceremonial banquets were a widespread Mycenaean phenomenon.266 One occasion mentioned in writing is the Pylos ceremony involving the king, and in many societies such meals are mechanisms whereby a chief can assert and en- hance his authority by rewarding his dependents. It may have served this purpose in Bronze Age Greece, but the ceremony on Un 2 takes place at a sanctuary, and most of the archaeological evidence comes from nonpalatial and religious sites. It is safe to say that such occasions always had a ritual di- mension, even though it is not always possible to dis- tinguish purely religious feasts from those that also served a political purpose. An illustration of just such a ceremonial feast ap- pears on the northeast wall of the Pylos megaron, the culmination of the procession with a bull in ves- tibule 5.267 At the right-hand end of the wall, the fa- mous bard with a lyre entertains at least two pairs of men seated at tables, while nearer the throne is a bull either standing or, in a more recent reconstruc- tion, recumbent and actually trussed for sacrifice. The setting by the throne suggests that the king him- self presides over the kind of event depicted, if in- 261 B. Bergquist, "The Archaeology of Sacrifice: Minoan- Mycenaean versus Greek.

However, the cumu- lative testimony of this painting, the miniature ky- likes and an offering table near the hearth, and a libation channel beside the throne offers strong support to the view that the megaron was yet an- other locus of ritual activity.269 The importance of the bull as a high-status victim is borne out by textual references other than its appearance on banquet lists.270 DESTRUCTIONS The destructions and abandonments that Myce- naean sites suffered at about the end ofLH IIIB con- tinue to fascinate. We now possess somewhat more information about these events and their aftermath than was available in 1978, but new data have not much changed the basis for debate. The search for explanations has continued too, but it must be said that the field is not much nearer consensus about either the immediate or the more remote cause(s) responsible for the end of the palaces. The remarks offered here are not an exhaustive review of the prob- lem, but a brief attempt to assess the more recent information and interpretations. The historical sequence of construction and de- struction at palatial centers in LH IIIB-C has already been touched on above. The first signs of widespread damage appear in the middle of LH IIIB, with de- structions in the citadel at Tiryns, in the Oil Mer- chant group and Panayia Houses I and II outside the walls at Mycenae, and at Gla (perhaps in LH 11B2). The sequence of events at Thebes is not cer- tain, but a destruction at the end of LH IIIB1 is ap- parent at some locations, with Linear B tablets pre- served by fire. Fortification walls are substantially extended at Mycenae and Tiryns in the aftermath of the destructions there. At Midea the wall was built in sections, and several foundation trenches have now been excavated. Sections examined in the East Gate area and lower terraces were built in LH IIIB2, ac- cording to ceramic evidence. A foundation trench in the West Gate area contains LH IIIB1 pottery but no certain LH IIIB2 sherds; the construction date suggested for this section is near the middle of the 13th century B.C., pointing to the latter part of LH IIIB1. The first half of this phase is also reported as the date of the fortification wall at Athens, but Wright has recently argued that the original plan was later modified. Subsequent alterations are made at Mycenae and Athens near the very end of LH IIIB, to ensure access to water from within the walls.271 How closely were these redoubled efforts at for- tification building connected with the destructions that immediately preceded them? The disasters at Tiryns and Mycenae have been attributed to earth- quakes.272 Yet the building of massive Cyclopean walls is not a useful response to the threat of earth- quake: it is a clear indicator that human enemies threatened the palatial centers in the Argolid, and perhaps at Athens. Other signs point in the same direction. Within the citadel at Mycenae further con- struction efforts include workshops and storage areas, notably the House of Columns and the Artists' Workshop in the east wing of the palace. Most of the cult center, which includes workshops and stor- age rooms, also postdates the mature LH IIIB1 South House. At Pylos, nothing is yet known of the puta- tive fortification/terrace wall now indicated by geo- physical prospection, but a number of alterations to the original plan restricted access to the Main Building and altered its character. The most obvious change was the walling in of courts 42 and 47, pre- venting entry through gateway 41. Room 27 and cor- ridor 18 were added to the storage facilities, and room 32 was converted to a storeroom. Finally, the North- east Workshop was a very late addition to the overall 268 Rehak (supra n. 256) 109-12 argues from icono- graphic associations of seated figures and griffins that the "throne" was in fact the seat of a priestess or queen, not a king. 269 As often suggested: see Hiller (supra n. 242) 117-19; Kilian (supra n. 246) 17; and HMigg, in Politeia (supra n. 246) 389-90. 270 Palaima (supra n. 186).

The ceramic links on which the argument is based, however, do not force this conclusion, and it has not met with universal approval. Tiryns: lakovides 1983 (supra) 3-13, 19. Thebes: supra n. 139.

The extramural settlement itself con- tinued in LH IIIB2, as it did at Tiryns, though at both sites houses were also built within the citadel. The real change was directly connected to the cen- tral administration. An increased centralization of resources and personnel sends the same message as the building of new and massive fortifications: Mycenaean officials perceived a very human threat, from quarters as yet unknown. The Pylos tablets reflect only the administrative situation at the end of LH IIIB, not its evolution, but they do demonstrate a highly centralized bureaucracy at that time.274 It is against this background that the disasters that struck the greater Mycenaean world at the end of LH IIIB must be considered. Most of these were already well documented by 1978.275 Since then evi- dence has become clearer for destructions at Midea and Thebes, and the abandonment without destruc- tion of Nichoria and Tsoungiza.276 The relative date of many of these events is only now emerging as the newly recognized transitional phase LH IIIB2/IIIC Early. The latest pottery in destruction levels at Ti- ryns, Midea, and in the Citadel House area at Myce- nae belongs to this phase, as does the latest Mycenae- an material at Nichoria. The destruction date of Pylos is a matter of renewed debate, but there too the LH IIIB/IIIC transition still seems most likely.277 The im- pact of these destructions on settlement patterns was not uniform. In Messenia, the dramatic depopula- tion previously documented is reflected in a dearth of LH IIIC pottery among surface finds of the Pylos Regional Archaeological Project.7" Many sites in other regions also went out of use, but habitation continued at the citadels of Mycenae, Tiryns, Midea, and Athens, and at other sites like Argos, Korakou, and Chalandritsa and Derveni in Achaea.279 Chain- 273J.C.

The assemblages in courts 42 and 47- stirrup jars, broken and discarded kylikes, and coarse kitchen ware-indicate that these courts were added to serve mundane purposes, possibly including the manufac- ture of perfumed oil (Shelmerdine [supra n. 195] 59-62). 274 Shelmerdine (supra n. 273); P. de Fidio, "Fattori di crisi nella Messenia della tarda Etai del Bronzo," in Studies Chadwick 127-36. 2" Sites destroyed: Argolid: Mycenae, Tiryns, Midea, and Iria; Laconia: Menelaion; Messenia: Pylos; Achaea: Tei- chos Dymaion; Boeotia and Phocis: Thebes, Orchomenos, and Krisa.

Two groups of Linear B tablets, certainly part of the palatial bureaucracy, clearly belong to a LH IIIB2 context. The Of tablets from the cor- ner of Epaminondas and Metaxas Streets were found with LH IIIB2 pottery including coated deep bowls: T. Spyro- poulos andJ. Chadwick, The Thebes Tablets II (Minos Suppl. 4, Salamanca 1975), contra Symeonoglou (supra n. 49) 48, 291. This is also the date of the new finds under Pelopidou Street: Aravantinos et al.

(supra n. 57) 638, 641. 77 There is proportionally very little decorated pottery from the Pylos palace, most of it anomalous. The motifs on a few vessels, including the five distinctive pithoid jars of shape 53, look early (LH IIIA2-IIIB1), while some deep bowls with debased and sloppy designs would be more at home in LH IIIC than in LH IIIB. On the strength of this handful of pots, M. Popham, "Pylos: Reflections on the Date of Its Destruction and on Its Iron Age Reoccupation," OJA 10 (1991) 315-24 argued for a destruction in LH IIIB1 and a later reoccupation. Unfortunately he takes no account of the other 90+ % of the palace pottery, which is un- painted. The high proportion of unpainted ware, its range of shapes, and its profiles are all entirely typical of LH IIB2, and militate against an earlier destruction date. Popham's suggestion that the exterior wall of courts 42-47 might be Geometric has now been conclusively disproven, since the wall predates the construction of the Northeast Workshop (supra n. 273). As he and others have suggested, however, a postpalatial reoccupation now seems certain (supra n. 44); future work by the Minnesota project will, it is hoped, clarify its date.

Musti ed., Le origini dei Greci: Dori e mondo egeo (Rome 1985) 73-95 propose that Tiryns was a refuge center in LH IIIC.

SHELMERDINE [AJA 101 ber tombs at Thebes are the only evidence so far of a LH IIIC presence there. Only a few other places stand out as more prominent in this period than in LH IIIB: the fortified settlement of Teichos Dymaion in Achaea, Asine in the Argolid, Panakton in Boeotia, Elateia in Phokis, and cemeteries at Perati in Attica, Palaiokastro in Arcadia, and on Kephallenia.280 At the sites where settlement continues, a considerable degree of continuity is evident: of the new elements associated with LH IIIC, handmade burnished pot- tery and the Naue II type sword are first attested in LH IIIB before the destructions, while in burial cus- toms the change to cremation and the use of cist graves does not occur until the middle of LH IIIC.281 The significant change from LH IIIB to LH IIIC is the demise of palatial administration. Though life went on at Mycenae and Tiryns, the megaron units went out of use. At Midea, the megaron itself was remodeled and converted to other uses, while Pylos was abandoned, at least for a while. Fortunately for students of ancient Greek, the end of Mycenaean bureaucracy meant the end of literacy, leaving the Greeks of the mainland free to adapt a more ser- viceable script in due course. What caused these events of the LH IIIB/C tran- sition is a question that may never receive a clear answer. The theories proposed have all fallen into one of three categories: foreign attack, internal strife, or natural disaster, and discussion continues along these three lines.282 Those who favor natural causes now think in terms of earthquake rather than a change of climate.283 The Greek excavators of Myce- nae have favored this explanation for the destruc- tions there, though their British colleagues have not agreed. Kilian not only attributed all the LH IIIB destructions at Tiryns to earthquake, but extended this theory beyond the Argolid to the entire Pelo- ponnese, specifically Pylos and the Menelaion. There is no good evidence to justify including the last two sites, but convincing signs of earthquake damage have been observed at Midea. Even if earthquakes are accepted as the immediate cause of damage at some sites, however, much remains unexplained. Why are their effects noticeable only at palatial centers (and not all of those)? Why, in their wake, were the megaron units at Mycenae and Tiryns not rebuilt, though plenty of construction took place in other parts of those sites?

Above all, this is not the disaster for which the Mycenaeans had been preparing. However intriguing the mystery of the demise of the Mycenaeans, an equally inter- esting question is what threat they perceived. The heavy fortifications of LH IIIB2 and protected ac- cess to water (Mycenae, Tiryns, Athens), the increas- ing restrictions on circulation (Pylos), and the ad- dition of workshop and storage areas within the walls (Mycenae, Tiryns) or close to the megaron unit (Py- los) all suggest that an attack was anticipated. Thus, the theory that Mycenaean Greece suc- cumbed to raids or invasions by foreigners also has its adherents.284 In addition to citing the archaeo- logical evidence of preparations, some have at- tempted to discern signs of an imminent attack in the Linear B tablets from Pylos.285 The arguments put forward focus on activities that may have been prompted by an emergency. Chief among them are the following: 1) the o-ka tablets in the An series de- tail watchers guarding the coast at various points; 2) bronzesmiths in theJn series are given small allo- cations or none at all, while "temple bronze" is col- lected, suggesting a shortage at the center; 3) vari- ous craftsmen are exempted from taxes; and 4) the sloppy execution of Tn 316, recording human offer- ings to deities, suggests urgent appeasement. In fact there is no reason to view any of these phenomena as extraordinary, or to connect them with the fall of Pylos. The arguments that an immediate crisis can be inferred from the tablets have not convinced those who work with the archive on a regular basis, and several refutations have been offered.286 If an assault on the Mycenaean world was a re- ality, two groups are most often proposed as the cul- prits. One is the Sea Peoples, a band of mercenaries or pirates who, according to Egyptian sources, caused a great deal of damage in Egypt, the Levant, Cyprus, and Anatolia in the late 13th-early 12th century B.C.287 There is, however, no archaeological evidence that these pirates attacked the Greek mainland; nor do the Aegean islands suffer destructions at this time.288 The other candidates are invaders from the north. The old view that these could be equated with the Dorians of Greek tradition has given way to a scenario of raiding, followed by the gradual infiltra- tion of West Greek speakers over the course of a cen- tury or more. At issue in recent discussions has been the difficulty of tying new customs and artifact types to the time of the destructions; as noted above, some first appear in LH IIIB, and others not until the mid- dle of LH IIIC.289 Another approach to the problem has been to fo- cus on why the Mycenaeans were vulnerable, and why the setbacks of the LH IIIB/C transition had precisely the kind and degree of impact that they did. Accord- ing to this line of reasoning, Mycenaean administra- tion had been in trouble for a long time. The highly centralized control of industries and resources doc- umented by the tablets, and their preoccupation with detail, along with the construction of workshop and storage areas in the immediate vicinity of the mega- ron, all reflect a response to economic decline rather than to any immediate threat.2'I A "systems collapse" of this kind could have involved competition for in- creasingly scarce resources of various kinds, from depleted agricultural supplies to metals and other imported commodities. Some have even attributed attacks on palatial centers to local uprisings or inter- kingdom warfare resulting from this competition, rather than to foreign incursions. An economic de- cline does not explain everything that took place dur- ing the latter half of LH IIIB, from the building of 2 4 R.

'29 The most recent proposal attributing the destruc- tions to hostile action has the merit of seeking to explain how it succeeded rather than simply who was responsible. Drews (supra n. 284) argues that raids by the Sea Peoples on the kingdoms of the eastern Mediterranean succeeded because of a new type of warfare, which favored infantry over chariots. Specifically, he sees evidence of this shift in military tactics in the advent of the Naue II slashing sword, and other changes in weaponry and armor, during the 13th and early 12th centuries B.C. His arguments for the change in tactics are well made and interesting, though his general thesis leaves open some essential questions, and is perhaps too monolithic. Early reviews have been mixed: those by D. Haggis in AJP 116 (1995) 321-24 and N.V. Sekunda in CR 45 (1995) 119-21 are a study in contrasts. 290 Betancourt (supra n. 275); de Fidio (supra n. 274); Shelmerdine (supra n. 273).</page><page sequence="48">584 CYNTHIA W.

Most useful about the notion of systems collapse, however, is that it takes into account the fact that it was the top level of Mycenaean society that suffered most directly. The key elements lost in the disasters were the trappings of those in power: the megaron proper, the enrich- ing contact with other cultures, the elaborate admin- istrative system, and, with nothing to record, the art of writing. Thus, any plausible scenario for the tran- sition to LH IIIC must take into account the architec- tural modifications following LH IIIBI, the destruc- tions and abandonments at the LH IIIB/C transition itself, the end of palatial administration, and also the continuity of normal Mycenaean life at a lower level, with no immediate change either in material goods such as ceramics or in practices such as reli- gion. It is improbable that all these phenomena, at all sites, could have had a single cause. Indeed, many now agree that a combination of factors must have been at work, and that the collapse of the Mycenae- an states required both a process of decline and a precipitating event or events.291 A LOOK BACK AND FORWARD Writing this review has brought an appreciation of the great progress made over the past 20 years in the disciplines that contribute to the study of Late Bronze Age Greece. At the same time, some avenues for future work are emerging. The position of the Mycenaean Greek dialect remains as ambiguous as ever, but Linear B studies have continued to refine our understanding of specific issues like land ten- ure, taxation, and industrial production, the general outlines of which were in many cases already clear by 1978. A newer development has been an advance in the study of institutions. The wanax himself has been one focus of attention, in conjunction with an interest in the formation of Mycenaean states. An- other has been the industrial operations of the palaces, and the kinds of activities that took place in specific areas. Here textual and archaeological studies have necessarily gone hand in hand, and this sort of interdisciplinary approach will continue to be of great value. Of all topics that the tablets cover, the greatest progress can be seen in the field of Myce- naean religion. The discovery of new texts has been partly responsible. Most of the strides, however, have come from new archaeological discoveries, and these are only beginning to be integrated with textual in- formation. A good example is the practice of cere- monial banquets described above. Excavators have reported suggestive caches of pottery and/or bones, while tablet experts have found written evidence for such feasts, but the two kinds of evidence have not yet been thoroughly discussed together. Further indications of the importance of inter- disciplinary research have come from the sciences. In particular, the combination of geophysical explora- tion and soil studies with intensive survey has already begun to generate new questions that can be asked about the evolution of individual settlements, before or in lieu of excavation. This is an area of great po- tential for future research, as is the larger issue of regional settlement patterns. In terms of excavation itself, archaeologists interested in the palatial period have continued to concentrate on the major centers, and on cemeteries. New questions have been asked and answered about the palatial sites themselves, re- garding the size of the towns and the territories that they controlled. There is still a shortage of knowl- edge about ordinary settlements, however, which can only be filled by a willingness to forgo material re- wards and explore some of the many smaller hab- itation sites that surveys have identified. In addition to the value of such knowledge for its own sake, it can also shed light on the organization of the Myce- naean states. The cases of Nichoria and Tsoungiza have shown how a combination of survey, excavation, and textual study can clarify the relationship between a satellite and the center. Further work along these lines could greatly improve our understanding of economic geography in Mycenaean Greece, the man- ner and degree to which different centers controlled their territories, and the consequences of expand- ing authority (and subsequently the end of that au- thority) for land use and settlement. The painstaking analysis of artifacts remains es- sential to the successful study of these and other the- matic problems, notably foreign trade. Categories like shell and bone, metalwork and glyptic art, and even frescoes receive little or no coverage in this re- view, but all continue to receive scholarly attention, and all must form part of any consideration of Myce- naean culture. Assimilating and organizing the pro- liferation of published objects will pose an increas- ing challenge in the future. Rapid advances in computer resources can be of great assistance, mak- ing it possible to assemble searchable illustrated databases of all sorts, from grave goods to Myce- naean pottery found abroad to assemblages from 291 Dickinson (supra n. 6) 307-308.</page><page sequence="49">1997] THE PALATIAL BRONZE AGE 585 specific excavations and surveys. Those wishing, for instance, to develop arguments about the growth of states based on metal finds in tombs, or about the rise of infantry tactics based on numbers of differ- ent weapon types, must have comprehensive and re- liable figures on which to depend.292 So must those who wish to evaluate such arguments. It would be extremely useful if this kind of detailed information were computerized and made widely available. At the same time, students of Late Bronze Age Greece must continue to strike a graceful balance between the analysis of specific artifact types and assemblages and the contemplation of broad theoretical prob- lems. Only in this way will the achievements described above in bringing Mycenaean culture into focus be matched by the gains of the next 20 years. DEPARTMENT OF CLASSICS UNIVERSITY OF TEXAS AT AUSTIN AUSTIN, TEXAS 78712 CWSHELM@MAIL.UTEXAS.EDU 29'2Jim Wright's forceful advocacy of databases (per- sonal communication) has prompted me to include the point here. Leonard (supra n. 107) is an example of a use- ful database now in existence. Argument based on metal finds in tombs: Wright (supra n. 118). Argument based on changes in weapon types: Drews (supra n. 284), esp. 180-208. Of course computer access is not available to everyone. It is, however, less expensive both to "publish" and to "buy" a computer database than to publish or to buy a book. Furthermore, towns and institutions worldwide that lack both computers and libraries are perhaps more likely in the future to acquire the former.</page></plain_text>
