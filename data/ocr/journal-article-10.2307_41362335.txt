<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE APPRECIATION OF GREEK ART By Charles Seltman, m.a., Director of the Greek Exhibition , 1946, Royal Academy of Arts. In the year 1882 a stout volume was pub- lished by the Cambridge University Press entitled " Ancient Marbles in Great Britain," its author being the learned Adolph Michaelis, Professor of Classical Archaeology in the University of Strasbourg ; its translator the late Mr. Fennell, Fellow of Jesus College, Cambridge. I cannot do better than quote a few lines from the Introduction to this work in the translator's own elegant language. " No other country in Europe can at this day boast of such a wealth of private collec- tions of antique works of art as England, which in this particular recalls the Rome of the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Great is the number of town houses and palaces, still greater the number of country seats, in which the noble and the rich treasure up, by the side of incomparable masterpieces of modern painting, considerable collections of antique works of art, especially of sculpture. So numerous are they, that few have any notion of this abundance of treasures, and perhaps no one individual enjoys a really comprehensive knowledge of them. What- ever has once reached the region of this Enchanted Island has remained there as it were spellbound." The last sentence is at the present day not entirely true, for some treasures have left Britain since 1882, though fortunately not many of them. For seven months I have worked on the structure and composition of the Exhibition of Greek Art now to be seen at the Royal Academy of Arts at Burlington House, and I have grown ever more amazed that so much of such beauty is to be found in England. The material contents of the great collections about which Adolph Michaelis wrote have rarely remained constant. Changes have occurred ; there has been a marked shift of emphasis. It is as the result of reflecting on this that I have taken as my topic to-day the Appreciation of Greek Art. It is not my purpose to tell in detail of the taste for Greek Art in the seventeenth century which appeared in the collections of Henry Prince of Wales, King Charles I, and Thomas Howard, Earl of Arundel, Earl Marshal of England ; nor of the marbles and other antiques assembled in the eighteenth century by the great families and still conserved - many of them - at Wilton, Chatsworth, Castle Ashby, Woburn Abbey, Doughty House, Petworth and elsewhere. Rather I want to talk about the change which has taken place in the appreciation of Greek Art within the last sixty years, for the change in taste is both remarkable and worthy of commendation. This change of taste can be studied in three sources : first, in the work of the learned Michaelis, supported by views of such late Victorian savants as Professor Ernest Gardner ; second, in Mrs. Arthur Strong's magnificent catalogue of the exhibi- tion of Greek Art held by the Burlington Fine Arts Club in 1903 ; and third, in the present exhibition in the Royal Academy. Two of the outstanding loans are referred to in both of the earlier sources and are now to be seen at the Royal Academy. They are the Chatsworth bronze head of Apollo and the Petworth marble head of Aphrodite. The Chatsworth head receives a passing mention from Michaelis, who writes as follows : "In the library a bronze head, somewhat above life-size, apparently of Apollo . . . the bronze is of unusual thick- ness, and has a beautiful bluish patina. Late y somewhat heavy workmanship ." (The italics are mine.) Mrs. Strong, writing in 1903, was much more aware of its superb virtue and did not stint her praise. For her it is " this magnificent example of the ars statuaria of the Greeks." Most of us at the present day are prepared, I think, to regard this as one of the three finest bronzes in the world. The art critic of The Times on February 15th writes of it as 'a work of great nobility which nevertheless seems to hover on the edge of too complete and therefore arid generalisation." If his implied criticism be justified it is because we have here the head only of a great cult statue of more than mortal size. If the nearly con- temporary head of Apollo by the Master of Olympia is looked at apart from the body a similar criticism might be made ; but when the head is seen on the body we are aware that there is no aridity, but only majesty. Now the interesting question arising from all this is : " Why was the excellent Michaelis so blind to the merits of this glorious</page><page sequence="2">April 12, 1946 THE APPRECIATION OF GREEK ART 325 head ? " Michaelis is fairly typical of his generation and his view finds a counterpart in the taste of his younger contemporary, Ernest Gardner, who dismissed the work of that mighty sculptor, the Master of Olympia, as full of shortcomings and glaring mistakes of execution. Part of these sculptures are even condemned as " almost puerile or barbaric in their uncouth shape and appear- ance." It is still with profound shock that we read such statements as these. We are staggered as much by the note of intolerance as by the blank aesthetic ignorance of such a judgment. Next take the Petworth head of Aphrodite and see how the balance of appreciation has swung pendulum-like from one extreme to another. Let us begin with the most recent statement - -again The Times critic writing on February 15 th. " There is the Petworth head, which may be by Praxiteles himself ; it is an astonishingly complete statement, with a marvellous grasp of the whole volume of the head." I am prepared to say that I admire her intensely ; further, that I believe her to be by the same hand as the celebrated Hermes in Olympia. This amounts to my saying that she is, for me at least, a work of Praxiteles. Shown as she now is, with the ugly Romanizing turned stand hidden by a box, I have been converted to an admiration for that sculptor's mind both by her beauty and by the perspicacity of an archaeological colleague. Mrs. Chittenden, to whom I refer, has drawn my attention to a passage in Diodorus Siculus concerning Praxiteles, where it is remarked that this sculptor with consummate artistry portrayed the passions of the soul. Such a description would be apt both for the Hermes at Olympia and for the Petworth head ; yet in the earlier nineteen-thirties other views prevailed, and one critic did refer to " the carnal corruption of Praxiteles." Turn back to 1903 and the pendulum has swung once more to favour Aphrodite, for Mrs. Strong in the Burlington Fine Arts catalogue wrote : " This superb head, which has once more become justly famous, offers striking analogies to the Hermes of Olympia attributed to Praxiteles ... it is safe, there- fore, to conjecture that the same artist made both the Hermes and the Aphrodite." Lastly, let us see what comment Adolph Michaelis can offer us about this head. Almost at the very end of his account of the Petworth House marbles he sets : ' ' Head of Aphrodite, replica of the head of the Medici statue, but of greater softness and roundness and also larger in its proportions." It would be hard to parallel this curt laconic indifference to one of the greatest treasures of England. In fine, the present attitude adopted towards the Chatsworth Apollo is due to a greater knowledge of ancient art and its history ; the present attitude taken to the Petworth Aphrodite is due to a more sympathetic tolerance among critics and students of ancient art. How has this tolerance come into being ? It certainly exists, and its presence among the public of our day was strongly impressed on me not long ago in the National Gallery when I observed the same public deriving obvious pleasure from the work of Peter Paul Rubens in the upper galleries and from the work of Paul Klee in the basement. There may well be a number of different explanations to account for the presence among the British public of this tolerance to which I have referred. In what follows I am about to offer what appears to me one possible explanation for its existence. I do not claim it as the one or only explanation, but I hope that it deserves consideration. Perhaps I can best express my views by commenting on certain dogmas concerning the fine arts which were until recently widely held and which I believe- indeed hope - are passing away. The most important of these dogmas was the theory of Growth and Decay. It was not so long ago customary to assume a definite process of growth and decay in Ancient Art. Pliny assumed it. Part of his account of ancient sculpture (based at second hand on the work of an earlier writer called Xenocrates of Sicyon) implies a steady development of merit up to the year 296 B.c., when, says Pliny, " Art stopped." " It began again," he declares, "in 156 b.c." In fact, art for him seemed to have grown like a human being from childhood to maturity, to have fallen into a coma for one hundred and forty years, then to have recovered and con- tinued in vigorous life. He anthropo- morphised art history, and in another place even foretold its end when he wrote of painting as " a dying art." Greeks before the Hellenistic Age held no such view of continuous development in art, for such a notion is part of the concept of human Progress - with a capital P- - foreign to earlier Greek thought. If you are descended from Piltdown man or from the simple savage</page><page sequence="3">326 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April 12, I946' of Lucretius, you think you are on the up- grade and Progressing. Not so if you are of the seed of Herakles or Ion and you believe the Golden Age is behind you. Once upon a time the anthropomorphising of art history combining with modern adulation of Progress was apt to dominate men's conceptions, and so they thought of the archaic Greek period as a kind of child- hood, of the early fifth century as an adolescence, of the later fifth and fourth centuries as the full vigour, and of the Hellenistic period as the ageing of an art, which passed into presumed paralysis with the advent of Byzantinism. It was simple, this theory of Growth and Decay ; but it is not a theoiy which readily fits in with the ascertained facts of history ; it is not a phenomenon observable in another and parallel foim of expression, literature. Homer cannot be described as more childish than Aeschylus, but as a different kind of poet ; Plato is not called a riper stylist than Thucydides, but a different kind of writer with a different theme ; St. Paul's letters are not mcie decadent than Cicero's, merely different. For the literature of the ancient world this Growth and Decay Formula will not work. Are we justified in applying it to Fine Art ? " Well " you may say, " why worry if people have this haimless illusion about Growth and Decay ? " But it happens not to be so harmless, because it implies another doctrine. Implicit in the formula is the dogma that earlier Greek artists must have been striving all the while to attain a naturalism, to achieve a life-like imitation that was beyond their powers. Yet, reverting to literary comparison, it is not generally claimed that in dramatic presentation Aeschylus, to take an example, was struggling to be as true to life as Menander ; or Shake- speare as true to life as Shaw. It is even conceivable- rather probable - that Aeschylus would have disapproved of the New Comedy, and Shakespeare of Shaw. Is it not perhaps equally mistaken to suppose that the sculptor who made the Giant from Sunium was trying hard to make an exact imitation of a man, but failing ? Did he give his giant an ear like some strange shell, and a wig like half a beehive because he was too immature and helpless to be able to carve stone into a semblance of a human ear and head of hair ? Was he more stupid than the palaeolithic cave-man of Altamira ? Or was it not rather because he loved formality and enjoyed pattern ? If he could have been confronted suddenly with the Praxitelean Hermes I believe he would not have ham- mered his own handiwork to pieces in despair. It is rather probable that the sixth century Greek would have been partly mystified, partly annoyed, not by his own production, but by the hubris of a man who made an imitation of something that the gods, could obviously make better in the original. When first I propounded this theory to- rny pupils in Cambridge I sometimes wondered if I was putting it too forcibly, until I discovered that it had the independent support of the most eminent Continental authority on ancient art. In 1927, long before the Nazis imposed their charlatanism upon Fine Art, Gerhard Rodenwaldt wrote as- follows (. Die Kunst der Antike , p. 33) : - " The view has been abandoned that the merit of a work of art depends on its fidelity to nature, and that the development of art consists in a steadily growing capacity for imitation. When the primitive or archaic artist shows a departure from nature he does not do so from inadequacy of vision or incompetence of hand, but because the sub- conscious inclination within himself and his^ age demands a kind of ' inner truth ' or form, which is not necessarily evident in nature." The early artist, says Rodenwaldt, is inclined to this inevitably, " not from any lack of ability to imitate had he wished to, but from a positive craving for form and expression. There is something that drives all genuine and unaffected primitive art away from the copying of nature." It is evident that in the earlier periods Greek sculpture, drawing, drama and poetry were executed under absolute authority of opinion imposed by the particular conven- tions of their day. The themes which art handled had a certain detachment from every- day life, for they were usually superhuman or heroic themes. And even on a lower plane, even when the poet treated of field labour or of love, when the sculptor made a marble girl for dedication to Athena, when the vase-painter drew the olive yard, these themes had to be deliberately limited within fixed conventions. The conventions of an age, the themes ,. the interests and fashions of a period change to those of another. Thought, literature, architecture and the plastic arts likewise change y but they do not rise and mature, nor decline and fall. Let such anthropomorphic jargon be consigned to limbo.</page><page sequence="4">April 12, 1946 THE APPRECIATION OF GREEK ART 3^7' And here I would say, almost in paren- thesis, that the change of interest from formalism in the sixth century to repre- sentationalism in the fifth and fourth cen- turies in art as well as in literature is curiously paralleled by a sincere belief in the power of the gods during the sixth century contrasted with a growing humanism and agnosticism in the fifth. There may be some connection ; I do no more than suggest it. At any rate, because past critics of Greek art failed to note the simple fact of change , because they substituted for it the Plinian nonsense about growth and decline, all sorts of confusions and prejudices used to arise. People with an honest preference for Par- thenonic art would apologise for the formality of the sixth century ; people with an honest love of the sixth century would sneer at the imitativeness of Hellenistic art : as though the admirer of Herodotus should apologise for Homer because he did not write prose history ; as though the disciple of Aeschylus should sneer at Polybius because he did not em- ploy the organic concrete grandeur of tragedy. In fact, what we most require in art criticism is that kind of sympathetic tolerance which I have already mentioned, for it will contribute to a juster appraisal and appre- ciation of all art, especially the Greek, with its infinite shades and forms. A public -which is being regaled, as ours is at the present time, with so many and various forms of art is probably being unconsciously trained to acquire this excellent approach. As long ago as 1931, when I was in the United States, I was made aware that this Idnd of training was being given in many- large cities of America before our people here were getting as much variety in artistic experience. I also observed then that a fairly consistent attack was being directed against objects of Greek art in America from certain quarters, mainly, of course, from Germany. Such attacks if successful could have seriously warped the American appre- ciation of Greek art, and without a doubt some such motive prompted these attacks. Great Transatlantic collections acquired, mainly between the two wars, such masterpieces as the Minoan gold and ivory goddess, the gold and ivory girl bull-leaper, the Boston counter- part of the Ludovisi " throne," the Cypselid gold bowl, the Cesnola statues, and the New "York Kouros. In almost every case some egregious German scholarling was found to dip a poison pen and write " Forgery." Jealousy was, of course, the motive, and I dare not claim that we here have been entirely guiltless of such folly. For long ago, in the Elgin marble controversy of 1806, Payne Knight set a very bad example when he declared the Parthenon sculptures to be not forgeries, but (almost worse) Roman copies of the Hadrianic Age, pronouncing ex cathedra his interdict before ever he had set eyes on a single marble. If a few mis- guided scholars were determined to mislead the public by facile and unreflecting con- demnation they might cause as much harm to the appreciation of the art of the ancient world as was caused in the beginning of the last century. However, since similar attempts have done no great harm in America, we may venture to hope that they could not hurt us either. Therefore I make no apology for professing a certain confidence in the judgment of the public and in its ability to appraise and appreciate the many and strangely varied forms of the Art of Greece. I began by quoting from Adolph Michaelis in 1882 ; I cannot do better than end by quoting Eric Newton, writing in The Sunday Times of February 17th, 1946, about the current exhibition : " Here are the foundations of the whole of European humanism. If they look a little too serene and effortless, that is partly because the emphasis of the exhibition is on the mature rather than the archaic, and partly because we, in our groping, transitional age, are abashed by so triumphant and so un- troubled a solution of artistic problems. No civilisation ever achieved such balance and dignity, such certainty of what it was aiming at, as the Golden Age in Greece. If we are occasionally bored by it, the fault lies in our own jealous mistrust of certainties." On the motion of Squadron Leader C. S. Goode, a vote of thanks was accorded to Mr. Seltman, and the meeting terminated.</page><page sequence="5">April 12, 1946 THE APPRECIATION OF GREEK ART 315 Fig. i. - Marble female figure ; 3000 to 2500 b.c. from Paros , in the National Museum , Athens Fig. 2. - Marble youth ; about 600 b.c., in the Metropolitan Museum , New York</page><page sequence="6">JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April 12, IQ46 Fig. 3. - The head of Apollo, over life size ; bronze from Chatsworth (by the courtesy of the Duke 0} Devonshire )</page><page sequence="7">kpril 12, 1946 THE APPRECIATION OF GREEK ART 317 Fig. 4. - Head of Apollo, over life size ; marble from the Temple of Zeus in Olympia</page><page sequence="8">^l8 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April 12, 1 946 Fig. 5. - Head of the Hermes of Praxiteles ; marble , in Olympia</page><page sequence="9">April 12, 1946 THE APPRECIATION OF GREEK ART 319 Fig. 6. - Head of Aphrodite , or Phryne , by Praxiteles ; marble from Petworth House (by the courtesy of Lord Leconfield)</page><page sequence="10">320 JOURNAL OF THE ROYAL SOCIETY OF ARTS April 12, I946 Fig. 7. - Torso of Apollo Sauroktonos, school of Praxiteles ; marble from the Fitzwilliam Museum , Cambridge</page><page sequence="11">April 12, 1946 THF APPRECIATION OF GREEK ART ]2 Fig. 8. - Youthful Aphrodite, part of feet, vase and drapery restored .
