<plain_text><page sequence="1">MENIE GREGOIRE A FINAL WORD ABOUT LOVE ν exuality is not a problem. It is a fundamental datum of every living being, man, woman, or animal. Each of us must live with his own sexuality, and no one is exempt from it, whatever he may think. It is a problem only in proportion as it is inhibited or disturbed. If it were experienced without conflict with social or spiritual forces, this sym posium would present itself as a hymn to the most powerful, the most divine of nature's forces, the only one which, at the meeting-point of spirit and matter, achieves that much-sought miracle of the unity of being. Sexuality is also very probably a constant factor in human existence. Since it plays such an important role both in the world and in life, it could hardly be something new, and no doubt perversions themselves are as perennial as instincts. If sexuality seems to be marking the twentieth century with its stamp, it is certainly not that man has changed, but simply that he has a different consciousness of sex, and has given it a place of its own in his scale of values. Let us, therefore, try to study how sexuality appears to us. But to say "us" so intellectually already is to be guilty of a mistake. It seems quite impossible that a woman, a sexual being par excellence, should have a consciousness of this force similar to that of a man. The position in which nature places us confers on this reality, which defies expression and comparison, if not a totally different color, at least a different shading. Let us say then, more precisely, that a woman will attempt to study what this central element of being represents for our contemporaries; and let us keep in mind that what is rightly called "sexuality" in this symposium, almost inevitably takes the name and the face of love, when it is truly placed in the feminine context. A New Religion The twentieth century, searching for a liberty which would reach not only the spirit but the body, has rediscovered that the flesh has an un tainted value for the civilized person, and that so-called animal ties have kept a real meaning for man. This discovery seems to have released, as a reaction to centuries of false "spiritualization," an explosion of joy that is both healthy and childish.</page><page sequence="2">But from the scientific basis in which this discovery had its begin ning, the public at large has, obviously, retained only one part: the re discovery of the "libido" and the revelation of its importance. The role of "sublimation," so essential for all the psychoanalytical schools, has remained the private knowledge of the specialists. If one reflects that Freud managed to put a voluntary end to his sexual life at forty years of age, one may sufficiently gauge the difference between his doctrine and what the world has made of it. It is a fact that this doctrine, like the spiritualization of love that Socrates describes at the end of the Symposium, goes over the heads of contemporaries, leaving them only a vague impression of something sa cred. Present-day novels and films show this quasi-religious attitude quite well. A movie like The Lovers by Louis Malle proclaims that sex, in its most instinctive form, most carefully freed of any spiritual contact, has become the way of salvation. If Lady Chatterley's Lover was able to cause a scandal at its appearance, it is now only a part of a large current and solidly hemmed in by more categorical prophets, among whom we may count Miller and Nabokov. Certainly, it has been a long time—at least in France—since a man could feel himself a man without a well established (even notorious) record of sexual power. What is new is that today it is a question of a new religion; that in the public mind, there can be no health, and there fore no sanctity, without a sexuality that is not only developed, adult, normal, but even more, well supplied and as little sublimated as possible. Skipping over everything with which the West has enhanced love dur ing a thousand years of culture, or to which Greece and the Buddhist Orient had attempted to direct sex, rejecting even the refinements of a poetic wisdom which Ovid's charm had spread over it, the twentieth century returns to the sources, to instinct pure and primitive, such as it is imagined to be. The nobility of sex seems, for many contemporaries, to reside in its purely material integrity. This is surely the reason for that scorn which today puts virginity and continence in the same category as impotence, and which is one of the special characteristics of our time. This disdain, moreover, is mixed with fear: the man or woman who seldom indulges in sex, like those who are sexually inadequate, must be depraved or sick, condemned sooner or later to some neurosis; they are pitiful creatures who could never be trusted, because their vision of the world is false at its founda tion. Here the Freudian interpretation comes through, along with its consequences, ending in that sort of obsession of which Claude Mauriac's Dinner Party is one of the most perfect illustrations. The other novelty of the twentieth century is that the women are in cluded in the rite. If in the nineteenth century, the male had come to boast of his condition, the female would have been dishonored by such an attitude. Only kept women, in the literature of the epoch, had the MENIE GRÉGOIRE 259</page><page sequence="3">effrontery to believe that they had their rights to the pleasures of the flesh. Only the most fantastic sublimation was admissible for the others. Today, a woman learns sooner or later that her equilibrium and her coming of age are conditioned by her sexual flowering. She not only knows of its existence, but its value. She demands it, which is as healthy as it is perfectly justified. But—and there is where the "new religion" intervenes—the prophets demand it at any price. The desertion of the child, by the heroine of The Lovers, is no less symbolic than the systematic vilification of the partners in Rochefort's Warrior's Sleep. As for the "cheat" she dies as soon as she puts anything into love besides an available bed! Nothing seems capable of being balanced against this "good" which conditions all others. No spiritual context is necessary for the operation of the balancing virtues of pleasure; it is not a question of happiness, but of placing a total value on the individual in terms of the body. And there we have the true novelty of the twentieth century: it is sex—and no longer love—which is the object of religion. The Stendhalian passion or that of Tristan are something like accessories for a dance. None of them could withstand that popularized psychoanalysis, spread wholesale through the U.S. press, the regular diet of millions of Amer icans! This "faith" is a wave from the depths which would rejuvenate the old world, defend a humanity that has become weighed down, oppressed by the weight of the spirit. It is a return to instinct as an interior governor; and whatever it may cost a woman to admit it, it seems right today that we are not discussing love but sexuality. So much for the "prophets," those who from generation to generation crudely proclaim successive springtimes of humanity. For the rest of the herd, content to attend modestly to their own development, sexuality, which formerly was shameful or unknown, has become one of the central points of being, where internal balance and dialectic stand revealed, the touchstone of the personal edifice. By it we measure the truth of our happiness or our anguish. We find in it the test of, if not the key to, our adaptation to the world. Men and women of our epoch have recognized more or less confusedly that life lies in this knotting together of all the forces of nature. Now, if there is a common faith in the midst of this terribly divided twentieth century, it is indeed faith in life, to such a degree that many Christians, following in the wake of Teilhard de Chardin, no longer reach God without passing through it. We will leave to others the problem of judging whether the world is impoverished or enriched by the promise of a new humanism. We will try instead to study the forces of opposition against which the new religion puts itself: first, women, who from time immemorial, indeed from the beginning, have been the strength of society, and cannot, with out conflict, rally to the exaltation of this anti-social force which is sexuality; then, the Christian religion, which incarnates the spirit, and 260 CROSS CURRENTS SPRING 1964</page><page sequence="4">is confronted with very old and difficult problems presented under a new light. Feminine Consciousness and Unconsciousness To say what sexuality is for a woman would be simple if one knew what a woman is. The most honest definition which can be offered is that woman today is the conditioned being par excellence, conditioned in the Pavlovian sense, in her essential reflexes. Not content with being conditioned by nature, which subjects her to the species, woman has for centuries found herself enslaved to the egois tical ignorance of man, and in a world of immemorial religious terrors, tied down by her own ignorance. Where does this conditioning begin, where does it end? Simone de Beauvoir racked her rather remarkable brain over this question. Even feminine sexuality seemed to the first psychoanalysts the "dark continent,"1 and in the midst of the twentieth century, this dark con tinent undoubtedly weighs heavily on the ideas of the period. We must therefore start out on a real exploration. May we be pardoned in advance for the curious things that we may encounter. Tied to the service of the species, feminine sexuality differs essentially from man's: man is free, instantly released. He belongs to himself, he is absolute act, and the unfailing self-possession of his body is the great est astonishment for woman. For her, there is never any true self possession, never a moment which does not belong, if not to eternity, at least to that passage of time which, for agnostics, strongly resembles it. Her body is, by definition, a fetter. It is made to break loose from, to change, to become deformed; it assaults her balance, her life, her strength, and her freedom. The so-called sexual liberty of women, advocated by non-conformists seems to us a mockery. No amount of precaution, self-interest, or intrigue ever really reassures the primitive and collective being which slumbers in the depths of every woman, no matter how emancipated she may be. Unless they are virgins or continent, their life is a constantly recur ring tide of emotional storms and calms like the rhythm of the ocean. For those who pay the price of endless precautions, pleasure is never free, but constitutes a threat to be overcome. Not even age can still this great cosmic fear, totally devoid of logic. Numerous doctors tell this same story which is not an isolated example, and is more convincing than any explanation. An old man stranded in 1 From Marie Bonaparte to Karen Horney, through Hélène Deutsch, the list is not long of those who have tried to understand it clearly; and always by this infringe ment of the psychiatric bias, sole breach in the wall of mysteries which surrounds it. (Note also that the theme of the recent International Psychiatric Congress was "Femi nine Sexuality.'') MENIE GRÉGOIRE 261</page><page sequence="5">their office, embarrassed, hesitant, finally blurts out: "Doctor, you are going to see my wife shortly. Couldn't you take the opportunity to reason with her a little? . . . It's been ten years since she went through the menopause. She still doesn't want me to approach her, she is so afraid that I will make her pregnant." Logic, reason, good sense, noth ing seems to count in the matter of feminine sexuality against this deep sense of belonging to the species from which woman never feels herself protected. Nothing but a vast confidence in a worthwhile partner breaks the hold of this sort of "collective consciousness." Who would dare estimate the number of women made frigid by terror of pregnancy? There too, medical confidences open up chasms. Frigidity seems to be the stigma of advancing age, the secret of the majority of unbalanced women. Even today—whatever the novelists and movie makers say about it—a woman almost never makes love for pure pleas ure, but rather at the time when her sexuality, more powerful than man's, breaks the barriers of instinctive self-preservation. She does not say it, or does not know it, because before, desire takes over, while during, everything disappears, and after, pride plays its role. And men go away free and ignorant as babes in the woods. A woman has lived the sacred instant and remains touched by the miracle. A second element, no less essential, seems to disurb the "purity" of sex for woman and to militate for the spirit: the choice of a man and the gift which is made to him are rarely without link to the maternal gift. It is well known that the homeliest man is not the one with the least chance of being chosen. On the contrary, a marriage proposal from a widower, an invalid, or someone who can say he has suffered, produces a flood of spontaneous devotion, which has nothing perverse about it; they give rise to an appeal for a personal gift, in direct rela tion to feminine sexuality. And if, on their side, the most repulsive women are not left waiting, especially in the country where they are most sought after, it is for an opposite reason: they flatter the need to dominate which is rarely missing in masculine sexuality. In order to have more chance of winning, the man eliminates the competition. (Bad logic, moreover, since the woman who is chosen loses any inferiority complex!) The old formulas—"the woman gives herself," the man "takes her"— have a meaning. This gift which a woman makes of her person increases her partner's value in her own eyes, creates a proprietary link. And in this instinct is already sublimated, prolonged in a duration which is not the masculine now. That is why, for any normal woman (that is, one who conforms to the dominant feminine image), sexual relations with out love have no meaning. A third element causes the eruption of the spirit: the woman's sexual fulfillment is directly linked to the attention which the man accords to her. She does not take, she receives, and receives only what he is willing 262 CROSS CURRENTS SPRING 1964</page><page sequence="6">to give her, strictly to the degree that she meets with generosity, altruism—that is, no longer simply sex, but love. For basic frigidity sets up no mechanical obstacle to sexual relations. It can even pass unnoticed or be denied. But the sexual flowering of a woman can only occur with the man in an already spiritualized context. Rape often prevents it permanently. Without attention from her partner, the civilized woman does not awaken sexually, remains frustrated, and sinks into that secret balance of recriminations, rejections, and hatreds, in which her relations with others, if not with herself, are swallowed up. There, no doubt, is one of the major reasons for that importance which women have always conferred on affectivity; not because of false delicacy, as has often been said, but in terms of instinctive self defense. For them the gift of being attractive is the promise and the condition of happiness. That is also why all through the ages women have imposed love on men, with all its refinements. If they have not invented love, they at least codified its rules at the time of the Courts and Judgments of Love of the Countess of Champagne. No doubt the fourth spiritual element has not been enough dis cussed either, that is, the depth of a woman's carnal link. It is a per sonal invasion, a total attachment which finds its source, not in litera ture, but in the possession to which her whole being has consented, consciously and unconsciously. Perhaps she also finds it in the seed or the fruit of the other which she will be able to shelter. These same things do not exist for men. Only feminine sexuality brings together, without any possibility of divorce, sentiments, the gift of the soul and bodily joy. As soon as this equilibrium is disturbed, even in marriage, it generates uneasiness and a sense of moral sanction. Besides, for most women love is the only great adventure. War, ambitions, discoveries are men's temptations. Only love breaks the dull mediocrity of most of their existences. This is why it seems that, contrary to men, few normal women can manage two simultaneous adventures without feeling dis turbed; even a transitory affair always seems to have a "marriage" aspect, complete in the here-and-now. If, for many men, sexuality can be a simple instrument of pleasure, this is impossible for women who have arrived at a certain degree of civilization. It brings an enrichment, a way of knowing, a balance, a deepening of relationships with others, and an integrated vision of life and the world; the majority of women are no more ready today than yesterday to see these things scorned by those men so childish as not to have discovered them on their own. There is no merit for women in this; nature, self-interest, society, everything pushes them to it. If men are astonished occasionally to feel women encroaching or grasp ing, it is because there is a specifically feminine instinct which men do not know: the attachment to the male who makes life, in every sense of the term. MENIE GRÉGOIRE 263</page><page sequence="7">There remains a last distinctive element of feminine sexuality which stands in opposition to the new "religion" but whose psychological con sequences are much sadder. Even though the taboos of the nineteenth century are theoretically dead, a great confusion survives them, to say nothing of a silence and a mystery which are far from being breached as generally as is believed. In simple terms, a large number of women are still strangely ignorant. Everything, in our world, teaches men to be men. We live in a male civilization where male rights and virtues are chiefly honored. But nothing teaches women to be women, not even their own kind. No ar chetype is recognized, no model is admitted, nor is there freedom of ex pression in discussion among women. What is a woman? It would be interesting to know how many moth ers who are bringing up daughters would be in a position to furnish an answer. The sex education of women remains hampered, shackled by reminders of bourgeois decency, religious fears, and even the unconquer able shame of mothers who remain children. We have spoken of woman's respect for love, but, to be honest, their fear of sex must be admitted too. The preceding generation seems to have suffered from a massive frigidity, made up of inconceivable ig norance, fear, and submissiveness. What could such mothers teach? What image of woman and marriage could these subservient women offer? Adult women of the first half of the twentieth century have heard, more often than one might believe, that girls ran away from their wedding nights in dismay, and were sent back perforce to accept their "conjugal duty." Some more enlightened mothers dared to say (this is an actual quotation): "It may happen that your body will trouble you one day. If it becomes too burdensome, then appease it, for it should not keep you from living; but women like ourselves do not behave like that un less they cannot do otherwise." The others said nothing, raising their daughters on lies and pretenses. Our generation understands vaguely that the world needs happy wom en for its very equilibrium. But the instinct for life which impels women toward happiness is very largely impeded by primitive fears and still fresh images of mutilated and sacred maternal archetypes.2 The veil of shame which for centuries was thrown over everything which has to do with this function of the body and the soul, has surely caused more harm to humanity than many wars and cataclysms. To forbid a woman to be lucidly interested in what is one of her most in timate means of expression and knowledge, to limit her judgment and her education in this domain, by prudery, shame, and a false under standing of virtue, has no doubt been nothing but a flight before the 2 To the recent question put by the I.F.O.P.: "Are women satisfied by physical love in marriage," 22% replied that they were disappointed and 15% indifferent, which gives 37% on record as dissatisfied. 264 CROSS CURRENTS SPRING 1964</page><page sequence="8">revelation of the sacred, the dread of possible excess. Every interior door opens on other doors and it is often fear which keeps the first ones closed. The Christian Conscience Along with women, who are the guardians of society, Christianity and religions in general—are opposed to the triumph of sex. The relations of Catholicism with physiology have nearly always ranged between open conflict and a delicate equilibrium. They have con tinually fluctuated between cold war and armed peace, at the risk of heresies and law-suits. With respect to sexuality, the attitude of French Catholics, which is not necessarily that of pure dogma, reflects a long history, complicated by perhaps unnecessary misunderstandings. Christianity is the religion of love. "Much will be forgiven her be cause she has loved much" was said, not of a consecrated virgin, but of a notorious sinner. How and by what unforeseen route has such an ac crediting of human love ended in this dramatization of the flesh, com mon to the heirs of the French nineteenth century? We make no pre tense of studying it here. We would like, rather, to survey this attitude, its stiffening, and the conflicts it brings about for the contemporary world. There is no doubt that Christianity has a tendency to distinguish the virtues of the flesh from those of the spirit and to prefer the latter. Its role is to turn man towards God. But, relying on a phrase of St. Paul, addressed to a handful of apostles quite like our missionaries ("It is bet ter for a man that he should not marry"), one came improperly to con sider the flesh "the sin" par excellence, and even the original sin. Woman has become the enemy, the serpent's ally, even "the vice of man," ac cording to the horrible expression of a contemporary theologian. The word "love" itself, where the body asserts its spontaneity, has caused so much fear that it has become necessary to invent "charity" for one's neighbor, which becomes too often a forced and carefully controlled love. Recently, taboos have been multiplied to the point where great pains have been taken, because of a primary concern for procreation, to make detailed regulations regarding the couple's relations. All through the Christian centuries, no model of woman or of com plete manhood was presented to Christians, although they are com manded to "increase and multiply," as was said at the beginning of Gen esis. Virgins, men and women, religious child martyrs, and some peni tential widows have been—and still are being—canonized. The supreme model offered to wives and mothers is the Virgin Mary, who was not a wife according to the flesh, and was a mother by a miracle. To be a wife, the Christian woman must create her role. Finally, every Catholic is required to affirm that in the scale of values, MENIE GRÉGOIRE 265</page><page sequence="9">virginity and chastity are superior to love, although for someone search ing for a humanism this will be no small problem. In an age of warriors, surely, it was easy to confuse "superior" and "heroic," and this opened the door to a thousand misunderstandings. Above all, Jansenism came to open its poisoned flowers in the hard soul of the French, leaving indelible traces in spite of a three-hundred-year old condemnation. The common ideal has thus become chastity even in marriage. How should we be astonished to see, after that, the dif ficult sexual initiation of Christians, and their large numbers in psy chiatric offices, brought there by an unconquerable restraint in the face of life's very essence? Because of having wanted to love the other world too much, many of them have forgotten to love this one, poor compa nion marked on the forehead with a criminal's brand. They have been ashamed of it, and when they speak of sex and love, continue to draw the veils of abstractions or of mysticism over the realities of being. This latent hardness towards the flesh seems to increase. One remem bers those medieval abbeys where they constructed a wing to rear the illegitimate offspring of the monks, who, sanctified by penance, did not call the gesture of the Curé of Uruffe contradictory. Man came before the abstraction of goodness: man was to be saved. The horror of sexual sin and the fear it caused became, before long, generalized. It appears that we are witnessing now a redressing of the balance in the face of the new "religion," or a gesture of retreat before the appearance of a new "anti-Christ," events which belong in the order of history much more than in that of faith. But it may also be asked if this hardening of attitude was not exag gerated by a kind of "betrayal" by the clergy who, after making a vow of chastity, have unconsciously projected on the world their own diffi culties, their obsession in the face of inhuman problems. One may also imagine a more subtle explanation: a confusion between the nature of relations between man and God, and those of humans among themselves. The God-Man is the Spouse of the Mother-Church. By this anthropomorphic bias, the carnal link between humans, espe cially if it is not sanctified, is the betrayal of the supreme Bridegroom, or of the Spouse, the Father or the Mother... This is a personal and sacrilegious betrayal, with a dramatic intensity which cannot be com pared in intensity with any other type of sin, even should the latter be more serious. This alone can explain the assimilation of sex to "stain." For in Christianity, there is first pardon ("Felix culpa" says the liturgy), the integration of sin, that is, of a rule of nature, that waster of treasures, and of unfinished, interrupted and sacrificed efforts. If there is a great impulse to sublimation, one also finds that "Just one" who sins seven times a day, and is pardoned seventy times seven times, who realizes himself only gropingly, reaching the good through a thousand evils. But 266 CROSS CURRENTS SPRING 1964</page><page sequence="10">it is in regard to the first aspect of the doctrine that Christian forces are massing today, mobilized against the nearest enemy. The two patterns offered a Christian—marriage and virginity (both consecrated and non-consecrated), show some uneasiness in confronting the world's evolution. The last in the list of the sacraments, marriage —which is nothing but indissoluble monogamy—barely escapes the vicis situdes of the last century only to fall into those of our own. Out of St. Paul's phrase, "Women, obey your husbands," a morality that was badly lived and badly taught for a long time extracted one of the most subtle perversions of love: that of the sado-masochistic couple, where a male ex ercising complete rule over a woman who was deprived of any right of refusal, reduced love to a horrible confusion of good and evil, which could even become vice. For love is a school of learning where Chris tians who ought to be scholars have not always been present. It is a human school, which is not that of submission and annihilation before God, but of the equal gift in truth, where those who have become versed find much more than happiness: ecstasy. (On this point more over, the French have become vigorously perceptive. L'Anneau d'or, the journal of Christian marriage, and the works of Father Carré, have de veloped a healthier approach.) The present problem of Christian marriage, however, concerns noth ing less than its fundamental meaning. Has the discovery of overpopu lation and its anguished appeals created a sudden panic? Whatever the case may be, the present positions on the "ends of marriage" have re cently hardened. The condemnation of Doms, for whom the mutual realization of the man and woman was essential, seems to have solidified the doctrine. It may be asked if, for the hierarchy, procreation is not at present a sufficiently absolute "good" to be the very basis and mean ing of sexuality. In this way a terrible conflict would be opened, not only with the growing progress of demography, but with new knowl edge which no longer confines sexuality to the prolongation of a func tion. Christians themselves wonder if it is not part of the greatness of man to have known how to draw something more out of sexuality than that. These same Christians, finally, are faced with a major problem in the primacy of virginity. No one could doubt, certainly, that consecrated virginity is something else than a frustration or a submission to old taboos. Thoughtful men have always been able to recognize the value of the sacrifice which is a sublimation for superior goals, gift of man to God, but they also know that no sacrifice is of value if it seems to rest on the disdain of what it offers. Every ethic must begin by render ing homage to the grandeur and the nobility of what is to be re nounced. Only after this judgment of positive value can the "struggle of Jacob with the angel" be begun. (It was after the angel had admitted his angelic name that Jacob was able to triumph) Pope Pius XII, in his MENIE GRÉGOIRE 267</page><page sequence="11">encyclical Sacra Virginitas, recalls this clearly: "The virtue of chas tity does not impose on us an insensibility to the sting of concupiscence, but its subordination to reason and the law of grace." A certain type of literature and certain types of Christian teachings have not insisted enough on this point, so that those who would praise the virtues of the flesh are left handicapped. Certain regrettable confusions have taken place that must be courage ously denounced if the eminently noble meaning of Christian doctrine is to be restored. This cannot be accomplished by the disdain of phys ical love or by the negation of sexuality; to urge the "saints" to re nounce their sexuality can only bring a triumph over the flesh on its own terrain, by governing the senses. What should be proved is that there are not two loves, one for God and one for men, two vital forces, one which sustains the body and one which lifts the soul, but only one, which in certain of its manifestations is called sexuality, but goes con siderably beyond it. The effort of the saint can be nothing other than to turn himself completely towards heaven, body and soul ("Continence is worth only as much as the love which sustains it," said Lanza del Vasto.) The work of the mystics is to encounter God in their body, sus tained by a sexuality to which they refuse any other object. They have been explicit enough on this point to confound any prudishness. Bet ter than a renunciation, it is the substitution of objectives, an attempt which Socrates had already pursued, when he extolled "the fecundity of the soul, as even greater than that of the body." Of this eternal les son, essential for our time, Christianity is the heir, and brightens it with a new light. But we go nowhere without our body, not even to our death. It is our necessary avenue of communication. To vilify it by dis dain, to cover it with mud so as to condemn it as dirty, is to mutilate it and to unleash destructive mechanisms which will overtake us and deliver us to the hateful forces of wounded instinct. Christianity assumes what all the human visions have sensed: the ne cessity of asceticism, making it possible for a person to reserve the essential energy which would be wasted in pleasure. It has always been known that debauchery takes away happiness. Christians add that as ceticism leads to God; but they ought to announce more loudly that human love in its total form gives equal witness of Him. Virginity, therefore, could only be an exceptional supernatural ideal, not a humanism offered to all. Those who traditionally undertake "di rection" know well enough what moral risks it includes, and how many saints' lives have spoken of alarming flagellations, disciplines, and beds of cinders. They know that nothing in us escapes the grasp of sexuality, that everything reflects its unrest and its claims. But they also know that in its adult form nothing is better linked to charity, nothing better in spires the disdain of any happiness which is not shared, than the total love of a man and a woman. 268 CROSS CURRENTS SPRING 1964</page><page sequence="12">One is easily taken for immoral when one seems to argue for the vir tue of happiness, when one considers it right that human beings should be fulfilled, as our century strives after it. But surely this century is not more immoral than those which have denied these virtues. As for us, we remember with Mounier that "the ultimate goal we are aiming for is not happiness... but man's spiritual expansion." But it is possible that a certain form of happiness, one which consists in the total realization of the person, may be its prerequisite. For it has burst upon us, men and women of the twentieth century, that sexuality is a part of our culture, that the knowledge of the body, its mastery and development, are as essential as that of the spirit.
