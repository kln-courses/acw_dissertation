<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERBERT DAVID RIX. Martin Luther: The Man and the Image. New York: Irvington. 1983. Pp. vii, 332. It is perhaps inevitable that, among the many pub- lications marking the 500th anniversary of Martin Luther's birth, at least one would not be eulogistic or ecumenical in spirit. Herbert David Rix's unflatter- ing portrayal of Luther, so out of step with the times, will probably be dismissed outright or re- garded with suspicion and hostility by most scholars. Many are the reasons they may offer for their opposition to the book. Its author is not a trained expert either in the field of Reformation history and theology or in contemporary psychoanalytic theory. Although he claims to have read widely in the secondary literature, his bibliographical notes and references do not confirm this. His text is also marred by many errors in printing, translating, factual information, and interpretation-indeed, this book bears the marks of a vanity press publica- tion. Disdain for the sanitized image of a heroic Luther proffered by cult biographers has led Rix to concentrate his attention on an examination of the less attractive aspects of the reformer's character and on the psychological bases of his doctrines. If the tools of his inquiry are provided by psychoanal- ysis, its tone seems to echo the polemics of Johann Dobeneck (Cochlaeus), Heinrich Denifle, and Hart- mann Grisar. Rix revels in pointing out contradic- tions in Luther's doctrinal positions and weaknesses in his character. If many historians doubt the valid- ity of any psychoanalysis of a person who died so long ago, their skepticism may only be heightened when the conclusion is that Luther's theology need not be taken seriously, since it is the product of neurosis. These objections are not as devastating as they may first seem. Through concentrated effort, Rix has gained a respectable familiarity not only with current psychoanalytic concepts but also with many</page><page sequence="2">436 Reviews of Books of the relevant documents in the extensive corpus of Luther's writings. His lack of sympathy for the reformer has not led him into any major distortions or deliberate falsifications of the historical record, nor are the errors he makes such as to vitiate his insights into Luther's character. According to Rix, Luther suffered from psycho- logical disorders. Prudently basing his analysis on the documentable symptoms of the reformer's mid- dle and later life, Rix says little about his youth, only that Luther probably failed to form an affectionate bond with his mother, which led him to seek in his adult years neurotic emotional ties with others, and that as a youth he experienced an extreme fear of damnation manifested in his reaction of terror to a painting of Christ the Judge. To escape this fear Luther sought religious solu- tions. The promise of eternal life for those who left all to follow Christ led him to embrace monasticism, by which he hoped to escape the wrath of an overly demanding and punishing God for whom he had only hateful and blasphemous thoughts. His efforts to appease this anthropomorphic God by perform- ing good works out of duty not love proved a failure. His next theological solution was the "theol- ogy of the cross." Peace for the sinner was to be found in humbly accepting the mysterious will of a hidden God and in embracing divine punishments with love. When this theology also failed to control his pathological anxiety, Luther developed, by a nonrational emotional process, a new psychological technique to meet his deeper needs-the doctrine of justification by faith alone. By accepting as his own the satisfaction Christ made for his sins, Luther was relieved of his need to placate a wrathful God. This solution to his own anxieties Luther now propa- gated as a scripturally based norm for all Christians (p. 156). Rix shows how Luther was forced either to give peculiar interpretations to texts or to avoid whole sections of the Scripture to protect this inter- pretation. Thus, the unconscious test of truth was whether a particular position contributed to his psychic requirements. His theology was "an assem- bly of defensive contrivances clothed in theological terminology" (p. 88). It appealed especially to a variety of fellow neurotics. Any attacks on this theology were perceived as threats to his defenses against the fear of damnation and hence provoked venomous personal counterattacks. Under the pressure of prosecution for heresy, Luther's neurotic defenses crumbled. He retreated from reality, regressing to infantile impulses, fanta- sies, and fears. To control these anxieties he devel- oped the typical psychotic symptoms of the manic- depressive and adopted the defense mechanisms of diverting his attention to more pleasurable experi- ences (companionship, food, drink, and sex), of consciously and unconsciously misrepresenting oth- ers' positions and accounts of what happened, of engagirng in delusions of grandeur and of persecu- tion (his favorite persecutors were a wrathful God, Satan, Moses of the Decalogue, and, especially, the pope), and of resorting to immature, vulgar wise- cracks. After a major anxiety attack in 1527, brought on by his fear of recanting his doctrine to escape a violent death, Luther stabilized in a para- noid condition characterized by curses at his arch- enemy in Rome, denunciations of Jews, despotic behavior, and displays of megalomania. This reconstruction of Luther's psychological de- velopment is plausible in terms of psychoanalytic theory and consistent with much of the historical record. Because the data are so fragmentary regard- ing his youth, Rix's analysis stops short of explaining the deeper sources of Luther's intense fear of dam- nation. He has thus avoided the pitfalls of Erik H. Erikson's study of Luther's youthful identity crisis (Young Man Luther [1958]), which was based on scanty and unreliable earlier evidence. By using additional materials and adopting more recent psy- choanalytical concepts, Rix goes beyond the psychi- atric monograph of Paul J. Reiter (Martin Luthers Umwelt, Charakter und Psychose [1937-41]). Had Rix read widely in contemporary Protestant and Catho- lic scholarship, he would have given more weight to Luther's scriptural arguments, would not have mis- understood his teachings on good works, the hidden God, and enslaved will, and would have recognized Luther's many achievements. Although Rix criti- cizes Denifle for being "ill-tempered" (p. 4) in his attacks on Luther, he himself also engages in sarcas- tic and uncalled-for denunciations of the reformer. Nonetheless, Rix ultimately absolves the reformer of responsibility, because Luther lacked judgment and moral freedom owing to his psychic disorders. It is a pity Rix's insights into Luther's character were not offered free of polemics. NELSON H. MINNICH Catholic University of America</page></plain_text>
