<plain_text><page sequence="1">Das Ende der mechanistischen Physik. PHILPp F&amp;a&amp; (Ei- heitswissenschaft, Heft 5.) Wien: Gerold &amp; Co. 1935. 35 pp. 2 M. The title of Professor Frank's essay is a bit of irony. For he has written a devastating commentary on the contemporary tend- ency to find in the recent trends of physics justifications for spir- itualistic and anthropomorphic philosophies of nature. The author rejects the claim that modern physics, unlike nine- teenth-century science, is mathematical rather than mechanical, and that therefore the findings of the former support the belief in a spiritual being. He shows that both modern and classic physics employ mathematical formula having speciable connections with observable features in the world, and that one is no more evidence for spiritualism than the other. Again, the argument from the "break-down" of causality is exhibited as offering no comfort to the holists, for physics today is just as hostile to entelechies and other guiding angels as was the physics of our fathers. Nor are those who preach free-will in the name of the latest formula of the scientists helped much by the statistical interpretation of scientific laws. Most of the proffered evidence is really irrelevant to the question of free-will, and at best all that the argument shows is that a purely introspective psychology is too vague for enabling causal statements to be made within it. And finally, Professor Frank shows that the claim that modern physics is totalistic and no longer atomistic is both false and misleading. Anti-metaphysical physi- cists urged long ago that the Newtonian conception of what is an isolated physical system is inadequate. What these men wished to substitute for that conception, and what in fact modern science does profess, is a system of physics more comprehensive than the classic one but formulated in no less anti-organismic terms than the latter. Professor Frank's conclusion is that the "end of mechanistic physics" means nothing more than the fact that according to present evidence the laws of the microscopic features of physical phenomena are not deducible from the laws of the macroscopic ones. He views all the talk about the new more humanistic physics as consequences of attempting to translate the findings of physics into the special</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 613 language of some special branch of science. And he believes that none of the extravagances of present-day philosophers and philos- ophizing scientists would be possible if they employed a satisfactory universal language, into which all significant statements may be translated without loss of logical content.
