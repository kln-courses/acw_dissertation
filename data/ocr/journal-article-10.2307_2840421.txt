L The illustrations show two sculptured stones, of which one was found this year on Eyam Moor, near the stone circle. The other came from Great Hucklow, a place three miles away on the same plateau, and it is now in the Weston Park Museum, Sheffield. Another stone, not illustrated, bears cup marks with channels. There are a number of stones near by with cup marks, and these are also found on one of the stones of the circle. There had been a cup and ring stone 600 yards away, but it has disappeared. The first stone also bears two cup marks near the summit, but its principal interest is in two articles of deer-horn very realistically represented. There are some more artificial markings on the stone, but they are lightly incised and are probably indecipherable. The upper horn represents a pick or hoe such as was found at the base of inegaliths at Stonehenge, and is of frequent occurrence in Grimes Graves. The lower one is the whole of a first year's antler of the red deer, and. in my opinion represents a plough or harrow. These designs have never been discovered before, but the nearest approacb to them is in the sculptured stones of the French dolmens. Under the covering * Tausi is the Persian word for peacock.

These articles have been shown by M. Le Rouzic to be agricultural implements, and to be an emblem of the goddess of fertility. In the tomb of Chamhouti, who was an intendant of the Royal do- - ~~~mains in Egypt of the XVIII .2f 7- - .' dynasty, there are scenes show- ing men breaking Ii, e.~~e~4&amp;oia -' (~4; up the ground with hoes, followed by a man sowing seed, with a harrow following after. In the figure EYAM MOOR. at Saint Sernin in the Aveyron, the goddess has an anthropomorphic form, but in that at Castlenau this has almost disappeared, and is replaced by these two articles. This proves that our stone with two designs is equivalent to an idol of the goddess. The reason that our plough is not a handled celt is that there is no flint in our country, and, besides, the red deer horn seem to have been the standard imple- ment for digging. The other stone bears seven horseshoe curves. The portion to the left is broken off, and I am afraid that the fragments are now lost. The design was not GREAT HUCKLOW. meant to be a complete ellipse. It is seen that the lines finish before reaching the edge of the stone. In the centre there is a slightly raised boss. The design is similar to the sculptured signs in the allee couverte at Gavr'inis and at New Grange in Ireland. [ 36 ]</page><page sequence="3">March, 1921.] MAN. [Nos. 21-22. My suggestion is that this is also the equivalent of an idol of the goddess, The figure at Saint Sernin wears a necklace. Everything about her is symbolical. and I think that the necklace is the sun symbol of concentric circles. Being a necklace, it has a little swag, and the reason that it is only half a sign is simply that the statues, of which there are many, are only carved in front. At New Grange, however, there are two of these designs carved as complete ellipses, and on the back of this stone there are two more sculptures which so strongly support my theory that I think they prove it. There is a ridge upon which stands a boss, which may be taken as a head, and surrounding it are two well-made engravings in elliptical form which fall down at each side of the ridge. It will be remembered that the front of the stone also has a boss. The other design has the same idea, but is incomplete. When the necklace was engraved on other stones, either the front part only or complete, people recognised it as a sign of the goddess of fertility. Neither of these symbols has ever before been found in Britain. They prove that the cult of the goddess of fertility or earth spirit extended from France to the Peak of Derbyshire. These plateaux ST. SERNIN, AVEYRON were populous in the neolithic and bronze ages. This stone was given to the Sheffield Literary and Philosophical Society in 1824. It was figured by Geo. Tate, F.S.A., in his Sculptured Rocks of Northumber- land in 1865, and by Sir J. Y. Simpson in his Archaic Sculpturings, in 1867. When Sheffield formed a public museum, the stone, with other objects, was handed over, but its label had been lost, and it has lain for 48 vears, out of doors, unrecognised. I am indebted to Mr. A. Leslie Armstrong, M.C., F.S.A. (Scot.), for the photographs, the line drawings, and for much general assistance in the research. G. A. GARFITT.</page></plain_text>
