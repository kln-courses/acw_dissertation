<plain_text><page sequence="1">Introduction The Maracaibo Basin lies in the extreme northwest- ern part of Venezuela and covers an area of ap- proximately 61,450 sq. km. The limits of the basin are roughly defined by two branches of the Andes: the Sierra de Perija on the west, and the Merida Andes on the south and east. These are separated from one another by the Tachira Depression. The basin is filled with Quaternary alluvial deposits, l which gently dip toward the center, occupied at present by Lake Maracaibo. This lake is a body of fresh water to the south, grading toward brackish water to the north, where it connects with the Gulf of Venezuela and the open Caribbean Sea through the strait of Maracaibo and El Tablazo Bay (FIG. 1). Irregular topography surrounds the lake. On the east and southeast, the coastal plain between the lake and the bordering mountains is relatively narrow (20 to 50 km.), as compared with the western and southern coastal plain (40 to 120 km.). Rainfall in the south is more than sufficient to support dense selva (rain forest) and major streams, but it gradually decreases as one goes north and rivers become fewer and more intermit- tent so that a smooth transition from tropical rain forest through semideciduous forest to dry scrub land is found. Mangrove swamps are present around main 1.

Elsewhere vegetation is generally low and xerophytic and most beaches are barren, except for palm trees that grow along the northern shore of the lake. Climatically, the Lake Maracaibo Basin lies between the arid coastal belt which characterizes the northern coast of South America,2 and which includes the northern lake and Maracaibo Strait; and the humid tropical area which in- cludes the southern lake and the Andean and Perija foothills. The main winds are the northeasterly Trade Winds which, in the Lake Maracaibo Basin, turn to a more southerly direction.3 From the above summary of the environment it can be inferred that the Maracaibo Basin offered rich lacustrian, marine, and fluvial resources as well as workable agricultural land to provide enough food for the numerous prehispanic communities of the region. During this century, oil exploitation has become very important, and this activity has contributed con- siderably to an altering of the environment. Wildlife has decreased, the lake is being increasingly polluted, and the vegetation has diminished or disappeared in such areas as the eastern lake shore of the Distrito Bolivar where the oil companies operate. But prior to the oil 2.

Lagunillas: A New Archeological Phase for the Lake Maracaibo Basin, Venezuela Erika Wagner Kay Tarble de Ruiz Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones CientiElcas, Caracas, Venezuela This paper describes and compares the newly established archeological Lagunillas phase for the Lake Maracaibo Basin in northwestern Venezuela. Lagunillas is characterized by subsistence based on corn, by pile dwellings, and by complex pottery emphasizing plastic decorative techniques. A set of radiocar- bon dates places Lagunillas into Period II (1000 B.C.-300 A.C.) of the regional chronology. Although it shares some traits with other western Venezuelan pottery traditions, Lagunillas also shows northern Colombian, Ecuadorian, and, indirectly, Amazonian influences.</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1.

The lake contains numerous migrating species, semi-freshwater and true freshwater species ranging from small crustaceae to large Elsh.4 The Maracaibo Basin was not only attrac- tive for agriculture, fishing, and hunting, but the lake, the rivers, and the Caribbean Sea must also have fa- cilitated navigation, favoring contacts through migra- tion and/or trade with distant areas. Land travel was not difElcult either: the Tachira Depression provided easy contact with the Venezuelan and Colombian Plains (Llanos); northeastern Colombia could be reached via the Guajira Peninsula, and, to the east, the Lara region was easily accessible, and from there the Llanos and the central Caribbean Coast could be reached. Although in recent years some archeological work has been conducted in the area, systematic surveys and excavations are badly needed. The western shore is completely unknown, and prior to our survey the only reported site from the eastern shore was Hato Nuevo, located some 120 km. south of Maracaibo which yield- ed Tocuyanoid and Spanish potteryS raising problems of cultural and chronological afElliation. Until recently, the best known area was the Guajira Peninsula which contains two important sites: Rancho Peludo6 and La Pitia7 (FIG. 1). Unfortunately, Rancho Peludo, initially excavated by Cruxent and Rouse and later by Gallagher, has not been fully analyzed. It has yielded the oldest date for manioc cultivation (2680 + 90 B.C.; Y-1108-11)8 and is of great importance for students concerned with the origins of tropical agriculture. The pottery belongs to the Dabajuroid tradition, which became widespread through the Maracaibo Basin dur- ing the protohistoric Period IV (1000-1500 A.C.) of the regional chronology. La Pitia is an early ceramic shellmound, characterized by a variety of pottery types and complex burials accompanied by votive objects. The Hokomo phase represents the major occupation of 4.

(Y-855).9 This phase shares many traits with the west- ern Venezuelan early ceramic Tocuyanoid tradition and with Colombia's "First Painted Horizon.''l° The southern region of Lake Maracaibo has been in- vestigated by Sanoja and his associates. The following phases have so far been established in that area: Zan- cudo, Onia, El Guamo, Cano Grande and El Danto (FIG. 1). The pottery is characterized by incision, punctation, modeling, and monochrome and bichrome painting. The people of these phases exploited a riparian environment with maize and manioc cultiva- tion. The most detailed information is available for the Zancudo phase, which yielded a C-14 date of 864 A.C. (P 953).11 According to Sanoja the southern region of Lake Maracaibo shows cultural relationships with other western Venezuelan phases such as Miquimu, Chiguara 9. Gallagher, op.cit.

In 1972, we began to work along the eastern lake shore in the Bachaquero-Lagunillas region (FIG. 1). Bachaquero is a large habitation and burial site which yielded Dabajuroid pottery characterized by fabric im- pression, modeling, and painting. Urn burials are com- mon. The material is currently being analyzed. Lagun- illas produced a large quantity of elaborate pottery, emphasizing plastic decoration, which differs complete- ly from the Dabajuroid tradition and from Zancudo and related phases from the southern region of Lake Maracaibo and which has enabled us to establish a new phase for the Maracaibo Basin. The Lagunillas site is located approximately 2 km. west of the modern lake shore on recently drained lake bottom. The site was covered by water until 1939 when the companies operating in the area built a dike to ob- tain additional land for the oil camps. The oil wells and the building of a road and a canal that cut through the site have considerably altered its original landscape. Although today vegetation is totally lacking, before oil exploitation began, there existed mangrove vegetation</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 2, 1975 109 which is typical of sea and lagoon shores and brackish water swamps. The presence of pollen of Rhizophora, Chenopodiaceae and Amaranthaceae, obtained from the cultural layer of the site and identified by Estela DiGiacomo (personal communication), is evidence of the type of vegetation present during the occupation of the area by the people of the Lagunillas phase. The Lagunillas phase pottery, damp when excavated, was associated with burned charcoal, mangrove roots, and, where preservation was adequate, with fragments of burned wooden poles, suggesting that the prehispanic community probably lived in pile dwellings. The cultural material consisted of a layer 20-25 cm. thick and was found 15 cm. below the present surface in those trenches excavated in the undisturbed area of the site. Some trenches dug next to the road yielded pottery at a depth of 1.30-1.50 m. since approximately one meter of recent fill had to be removed before reaching the original surface. Figure 2 shows the stratigraphic profile of Trench 1A, dug in the undisturbed area of the site. The cultural material was found at a depth of 0.15 to 0.40 m. Between 0.25 and 0.40 m. we encountered a layer of burned charcoal, which could represent the remains of burned wooden poles. This suggests to us that the pile dwellings associated with the Lagunillas phase pottery were destroyed by a fire during the oc- cupation of the site. The modern town of Lagunillas, located next to the lake shore, was until recently also a town of pile dwellings. It was completely destroyed by fire several times, most recently about 1940. Near-by, and associated with wooden stilts protrud- ing 0.50 m. above the ground, we collected badly erod- ed pottery fragments and a few stone axes from the sur- face which differ greatly from the Lagunillas phase pottery. This material could belong to a more recent protohistoric pile dwelling population, probably representing fishing groups that were encountered by the first European explorers. Maps of the early 18th century show an Indian town of pile dwellings at Lagunillas. And even today, acculturated survivors of pile dwelling, indigenous Paraujano groups are found living on the Sinamaica Lagoon (FIG. 1), north of Maracaibo. The Lagunillas Phase Pottery A total of 23,435 sherds were obtained from Lagunillas: of these, 3,402 (14.51So) are decorated. The pottery is highly weathered and fragmentary. The sherds were damp and had to be dried before they could be handled to avoid crumbling. The continuous damag- ing action of water on the surface explains why so few traces of polish, slip, and painting have been preserved. It is, of course, impossible to estimate what percentage of the assemblage had originally been surface treated in the above-mentioned manners. There is a wide range of forms, sizes, plastic decorative techniques, and design elements which contributes to the overall impression that they were produced by very sophisticated artisans. The sherds of the Lagunillas phase are relatively thin (average 5 mm.) although the thickness varies from 2 mm. for microvessels to 10 mm. for some bases. There is evidence of coiling for vessels and a combination of coiling and modeling for figurines. The temper consists of crushed rock and mineral fragments: quartz, quartz- ite, quartz mica schist, microcline, plagioclase, feldspar sandstone, muscovite, epidote, zoisite, and phyllite. Temper is abundant and the fragments measure from submicroscopic to approximately 2 mm. Sherds are somewhat gritty and very friable. On unslipped sherds, the temper is visible, particularly on the darker ones where the white particles show up. There are some air pockets and holes where large bits of temper have been dislodged or weathered out. A few pieces are very porous. Most sherds are well smoothed and some show evidence of scraping. Polishing is found, especially on those sherds with white slip. Hardness ranges from 2 to 3 on Moh's scale. According to the Munsell Soil Color Chart, colors vary from white (75 YR 8/1), very pale brown (10 YR 8/3), pale brown (10 YR 6/3), grey (10 YR 5/1), to brown (5 YR 5/2). Some traces of cream, white, brown and black slip, and of black paint on white slip can still be discerned (FIGS. 3a, b; 6h; 7a). Colors often vary on the same sherd due to poor firing techniques or surface erosion. Most sherds were not ful- ly oxidized in the firing process as evidenced by the grey core commonly found. Very few complete vessels were excavated. On the basis of 16 rim and four inflection types, the following forms could be reconstructed: plates, simple bowls, flanged bowls, carinated bowls, globular jars, rounded and vertical-walled ollas, and bottles. A few micro- vessels (FIG. 6f, i), effigy bowls (FIG. 8a, b), boatshaped bowls and rectangular, box-shaped vessels (FIG. 6h) were also found. Figure 3 illustrates all the reconstructed vessel shapes from Lagunillas. Coarser paste and cruder or nonexistent decoration is characteristic of utilitarian ware such as ollas, bottles, and many simple bowls, which could have been used for the storage, transporta- tion or preparation of foods and liquids. Rim diameters range from 2 cm. on bottles to 42 cm. on large ollas. Rims are plain or externally thickened and rounded. Generally, bases are simple, but leg supports are also found. Hollow pear-shaped legs containing pellets which make them rattle extend up to or beyond the rim of type "D" bowls (FIGS. 3; 6k). Other legs vary from low and solid to conical or tubular, some with modeled feet, many of these belonging to zoomorphic or</page><page sequence="6">s; .

A New A rcheological Phase for the Lake Maracaibo Basin/ Wagner and Rulz anthropomorphic figurines (FIGS. 6j, 1, m; 7c, h, j, k; 8b, c). The only type of handles found are semicircular appen- dages attached horizontally near the rim (FIG. 4b), and only two examples of vertical strap handles found on open bowls of type "D" vessels (FIG. 4c). Atypical pieces include two complete and several fragments of drum-shaped objects with concave per- forated tops and flattened perforated bottoms which could have been clay rattles (FIG. 6b); and a small tetrapod vessel which could have been used as an in- cense burner (FIG. 6c). No clay griddles for baking manioc were excavated and the lack of annular and leg- ring bases, which are typical of western Venezuelan pottery, is noteworthy. Excellent craftsmanship is evidenced on the anthro- pomorphic figurines. Hollow, triangular heads with finely modeled facial features are characteristic of the collection (FIG. 7b, d, f, g). The head and legs are disproportionately large, the latter being bulbous with incised lines below the knees suggesting leg bands (FIG. 7h). The female sex of the standing figurine found in Lagunillas is indicated by mammalary lugs and incision (FIG. 7c). A hollow, complete figurine which differs from the others excavated, consists of a large head attached to a rounded body with a flattened bottom. No legs are depicted and the arms are executed in low relief, with hands clasped near the center. Two holes on either side of the neck could have served for suspension (FIG. 7j). Badly fragmented zoomorphic figurines (FIG. 8c), one possibly a turtle, are also found (FIG. 8r). Nearly 15 percent of the sherds have plastic decora- tion consisting of broad and fine incision, applique, ex- cision, modeling, and various combinations of these techniques. The decoration is generally restricted to the upper portion of the external wall and to the flanges, although there are jars on which the entire surface, in- cluding the bottom, is decorated (FIG. 6a, al). There is only one plate with decoration on the internal surface below the rim. Due to the fragmentary state of the sherds, we have had difficulty determining the types of symmetry used, but there are examples of mirror- reflection symmetry (FIG. 5f, j) and translation (FIG. 6O) 12 The overall impression, however, is that many of the designs are asymmetrical. Bands are usually set off by incised lines above and below the decorated field (FIG. 5p), or they simply occupy the space between the rim and the inflection. Broad line incision is by far the most popular decorative technique: curvilinear (30.36&lt;Yo) (FIG. 4a, i, j, l, m, p), rectilinear (26.91&lt;Yo) (FIG. 4d, e, g, h, k,), followed by applique (30.12&lt;Yo) (FIG. 5a - j), modeling (6.31&lt;Yo) (FIGS. 5k- m; 8), fine line incision (2.32&lt;Yo) (FIG. 3n, o, q) and excision (1.56&lt;Yo) (FIG. 5n - p). The most common decorative elements consist of: applique nub- bins with punctated center (FIG. 5e), arches (FIGS. 4O; 5j), scrolls, and serpentines executed in applique strips or incision (FIGS. 4p; 5g); and background fill of hatching (FIG. 5r), punctation (FIG. 5k), chevrons (FIG. 5s), and cane impression (FIG. 5q). Anthropomorphic and zoomorphic lugs such as snakes (FIG. 8g), birds (FIG. 8q), frogs (FIG. 8m), monkeys (FIG. 8d), crocodiles (FIG. 8n, o), and unidentifiables are found on flanges of type "C" vessels, incorporated in the lip of rims of type "D" vessels, or adhering to the bodies of jars (FIG. 8m). Other less common elements include notched applique strips (FIG. Si), button-like lugs (FIG. 5k), and crosshatching (FIG. 4d). 12. Anna O.

Sb, c; 8g), being the most common zoomorphic element. The snake head is used interchangeably with the punctated lug in applique scrolls, suggesting that the scroll may be a simplified symbol for the serpent. The predominance of curvilinear decoration with an emphasis on meandering lines and applique strips gives further support to this possibility. Associated Artifacts Associated artifacts are rare. We excavated several manos (grinding stones) and fragments of metates (mill- ing stones) which suggest that agriculture was based on corn rather than on manioc. Additional stone objects consist of a few hammerstones, axes and polishers made of sandstone, phyllite and granite. We also obtained fragments of fossil wood, which could have been used accidentally, but they show no traces of workmanship and are therefore hard to classify meaningfully. Or- namental artifacts consist of one small, polished bird- shaped stone pendant (FIG. 7m). It is 3.5 cm. Iong, with a biconically drilled hole in the head, made of steatite. Additional non-utilitarian stone objects are a small, 1.5 cm. Iong chert bead (FIG. 7,1), and three small, elongated, perforated pendants, made of serpentinite. They range from 3 to 4.5 cm. in length (FIG. 7n, o). A well made polished chert micro-ax, which measures 4.2 cm. in length and is 0.6 cm. thick, does not seem to be utilitarian and could have been used ceremonially. The only organic materials preserved are charcoal, fragments of burned wooden poles, and mangrove roots. Other sites from tropical America, where preser- vation, though poor, is better than in Lagunillas, have not yielded such perishable items as artifacts made of wood, feathers, seeds and fibers, which characterize the material culture of the modern aboriginal population of tropical America. No faunal remains were excavated. This again could be explained in terms of poor preser- vation conditions or that the evidence was destroyed by fire. The same accounts for the absence of human skeletal remains. Alternatively, the dead could have been cremated or buried elsewhere, on higher, drier locations, for example, near the Andean piedmont. It is of course impossible, under such conditions, to estimate the area or the population of the prehispanic communi- ty of Lagunillas. Chronology On the basis of stylistic features we originally es- timated a chronological position for the Lagunillas phase ranging between 200 B.C. and 600 A.C. Several charcoal, peat, vegetal and wood samples were pro- cessed by the University of Texas and Groningen laboratories. Table 1 lists the dates obtained. Samples Tx-1948 to Tx-1951 and GrN-7111 which consisted of charcoal or soil mixed with charcoal are associated with the cultural material of the Lagunillas phase. These dates range between 480 and 210 B.C. and are slightly older than the expected dates. They fall into Period II (1000 B.C. to 300 A.C.) of the regional chronology.l3 They can be correlated with the oldest polychrome pottery traditions so far established for Venezuela: Tocuyanoid, Osoid, and Pitioid and which share some traits with Lagunillas. Tocuyano yielded a date of 295 B.C. (M-257).14 The Cano del Oso complex from the Hato de la Calzada site provided dates that range between 920 B.C. and 650 A.C.lS and La Pitia supplied a single date of 10 B.C. (Y-855).16 The only older dates for western Venezuelan pottery come from Rancho Peludo, but belong to a different tradition characterized by crude pottery with few decorative techniques and by bitter manioc griddles. Samples Tx-1945 to 1947 are more recent but are not associated with the cultural material from the Lagunillas phase. The same is true for samples GrN- 7109 to 7112 which are much older. It is hard to evaluate the dates not associated with the cultural material, especially the wood fragments which are too recent. This is the case of samples Tx-1945 and Tx-1947, which could indicate intrusion or that they belong to a more recent group of pile dwellings at the site for which no cultural material has been found. Comparisons and Conclusions The Lagunillas phase pottery differs greatly from the material so far found in the Maracaibo Basin, except for La Pitia with which it shares some traits. Unlike most western Venezuelan pottery traditions, Lagunillas lacks tall perforated annular bases, horizontal rod handles, burials in shaft graves or urns, and possibly polychrome painting which characterizes Tocuyano, Cano del Oso, La Pitia, and Santa Ana (FIG. 1). Typical western Venezuelan traits present in Lagunillas are manos and metates indicating that corn was the staple, and multilegged vessels, plain rims, and ollas and jars were basic vessel shapes. On the other hand, non- western Venezuelan elements in Lagunillas consist of new vessel shapes such as box-shaped vessels and clay rattles, as well as a variety and complexity of plastic decorative techniques which are more reminiscent of 13.

Radiocar- bon dates for Lagunillas, Zulia, Venezuela. Ana share bulbous and peg legs with rattling pellets, lugs, modeled-incised decoration, modeled zoomorphic adornos, effigy bowls, boat shaped vessels, anthropo- morphic figurines seated on stools and the snake motif. Both phases lack handles. Lagunillas does not possess the richly combined painting with modeling; however, the paint may not have been preserved. In view of these resemblances we believe that both phases originated from a common source and that Santa Ana can be placed into Period II of the regional chronology. The long time span for Santa Ana (Period II to V, 1000 B.C. to 500 A.C.), originally postulated by Cruxent and Rouse,22 is no longer justified. Lagunillas shares the following traits with Tocuyano and La Pitia: hollow bulbous legs that extend up the side of the vessel almost to the rim, and curvilinear broad line incision. A few hollow rims, typical of Tocuyano, were found in Lagunillas. Both phases are characterized by the presence of bowls and jars and the absence of handles. The modeled snake motif is also shared by Tocuyano and Lagunillas, but Tocuyano combines the serpent with a human face whereas in La- gunillas the snake is not combined with other biomor- phic features. La Pitia and Lagunillas share female figurines, a trait that links both phases with northern Colombia. La Pitia does not present occasional cluster- 22. Cruxent and Rouse, op.cit. (in note 5) 145. Ecuadorian, Colombian, and Amazonian traditions. Within Venezuela, the closest similarities can be found with Santa Ana and Tocuyano, to a lesser degree with Cano del Oso, and indirectly with the Barrancoid tradi- tion. Outside of Venezuela, Lagunillas shows simi- larities with such northern Colombian phases as those belonging to the 66First Painted Horizon,''l' Malambo,l8 Tairona,l9 and some of the materials belonging to the Crespoid series.20 Although Bischof has worked out a tentative chronology for northern Colombia,2l absolute dates for many of these phases are still lacking, a fact which renders difElcult valid comparisons. The closest similarities can be found with Santa Ana, a unique phase in western Venezuela because it com- bines western Venezuelan Tocuyanoid traits and eastern Venezuelan Barrancoid traits.

A New A rcheological Phase for the Lake Maracaibo Basin/ Wagner and Rulz ing of punctation found in Tocuyano and Lagunillas. Finally, the coffee bean eye is present at Tocuyano and Lagunillas, but absent in La Pitia. One distinctive vessel shape in Lagunillas, a two bodied bi-convex vessel resembles the Cano del Oso phase from the La Betania site (FIG. 1),23 but differs from the latter in that the upper segment of the body is less prominent in Lagunillas (FIG. 3,o). The main similarities with Colombia are the an- thropomorphic figurines which resemble closely those from the Horno phase of Reichel-Dolmatoffbs "First Painted Horizon."24 Malambo, a Barrancoid site located on a lagoon of the lower Magdalena river (FIG. 1) shares with Lagunillas boat shaped vessels, a com- bination of modeling and incision and zoomorphic lugs and appendages; the main difference is that the sub- sistence at Malambo was based on manioc cultivation. Lagunillas shares anthropomorphic figurines seated on stools and zoomorphic tetrapod effigy bowls with the Tairona tradition. Plastic decoration, especially appli- que nubbins with a punctated center, resemble some phases of Bischof's Crespoid series, especially the Cienaga de Santa Marta, and the labial flange with zoomorphic adornos can be compared with Tierra Alta from the Sinu River basin.25 Although Lagunillas shares several traits with other South American pottery traditions, it is a distinctive style which cannot be derived from a single source. It seems to be the product of western Venezuelan, northern Colombian, and Amazonian influences to which local elements were incorporated. For example, such features as the presence of broad line incision, the scroll motif, and carinated vessels relate Lagunillas to the Barrancoid tradition in its broadest sense, i.e., as this concept has been used by Lathrap.26 But since so many non-Barrancoid features are also found such as figurines seated on stools, bulbous and peg legs and the cultivation of corn which point to western Venezuela and northern Colombia, we could state that a clear Barrancoid, Tocuyanoid or Crespoid derivation is no longer evident. The Lagunillas dates are certainly too recent to be relevant to the history of pottery origins and dispersals in northern South America, but the presence of such elements as open bowls with wavy rims, flanges with zoomorphic adornos, scrolls executed in applique strips or incision which end in an applique nubbin with a 23.

And such elements as zoned punctation on closed and carinated bowls and jars and parallel horizontal lines along the rim of rounded ollas suggests the presence of an early incised horizon extending per- haps from Ecuador to the Colombian coast and to Venezuela. Lagunillas is the first site of pile dwellings of Period II located in the Maracaibo Basin, but additional work remains to be done to work out in more detail the com- plex archeology of the Lake Maracaibo Basin. We are in great need of additional sites where preservation is better and which will enable us to work out other aspects of the area's prehistory. Acknowledgments. Preliminary results of our Lagunillas archeological project were presented at the 39th Annual Meeting of the Society for American Archaeology, Washington, D.C., May, 1974 and at the XXIX Annual Convention of the Asociacion Venezolana para el Avance de la Ciencia (AsoVAC), Maracaibo, October 1974. Several institutions and persons were helpful dur- ing the various stages of this research: we are grateful to all. Compania Shell de Venezuela provided accom- modations in the field and prepared the thin sections of the pottery. Estela DiGiacomo analyzed the pol- len samples. The University of Texas Radiocarbon Laboratory kindly dated samples Tx- 1 945 to 1 951. Carlos Quintero drew Figures 1 to 3 and Henry Blanco photographed Figures 4 to 8. Carlos Schubert and Alberta Zucchi provided helpful comments and the former also analyzed the thin sections. Finally, Hans H. and Judy Krause, Barbara Rivas, Billie Dupre, Lilliam Arvelo and Silvia Maldonado were excellent collab- orators during the initial stages of this research. Erika Wagner, Investigador Asociado Titular at the Department of A nthropology, Instituto Venezolano de Investigaciones Cientificas (I VIC), received her Ph. D. in Anthropology at Yale University in 1965. Herfield work has been in Venezuela, concentrating on the A ndean sec- tion of the country. More recently, she started research in the Lake Maracaibo Basin. Her main interest is the prehistory of the "Intermediate A rea.
