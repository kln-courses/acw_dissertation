<plain_text><page sequence="1">Daimon Parallels the Holy Phren in Empedocles* SHIRLEY M. DARCUS H ow the physical and religious views of Empedocles are related has long been a controversial question.' His two poems, On Nature and The Purifications, suggest that the cycles undergone by daimon and elements are similar, but how daimon is related to Love, Strife, and the four elements or to the god, mysteriously called a "Holy Phren" in B 134 (Diels-Kranz), remains a problem. B 134, in my view, contains a clue to the unity of Empedocles' thought. This fragment describes the way in which the god's phrontides bring about the world-order and also gives characteristics of the god which daimon will be seen to parallel. Empedocles says in B 134: * First I express my appreciation to the Canada Council for the Research Grant that allowed me to work on this paper in Oxford. I thank also Professors L. E. Woodbury and R. D. Sullivan for their critical comments. Responsibility for views expressed here remains my own. 1 (a) Some scholars assume that the poems are mutually incompatible or at least quite distinct works.

This fragment, which I place in the poem On Nature,2 can be rendered: The god "is not furnished with a human head on his body nor from his back do two branches spring; (he has) no feet, no swift knees, no hairy genitals: but he is only a holy and unutterable phren, darting through the whole cosmos with his swift phrontides". Like Xenophanes (21 B 11-16, B 23), Empedocles denies that the god resembles a human being, at least in shape. Certain anthropomorphic features are inappro- priate for the god but a phren and phrontides, which men possess too, are not. Still, the god differs from men in that he is said not to have, but to be, a Holy Phren. The god is now identified with a psychic en- tity of a kind found within man. Phren, it seems, rather than the other psychic entities (nous, thumos, ker, kardie, psyche, foi example) provides the best model of the god's activity. Phren also, in my opinion, reveals his shape.3 First, phren as shape. In a recent article I treat B 25 of Xenophanes, his one fragment where phren occurs: "But apart from toil he shakes 2 Which work the fragment belongs to is in question. Diels-Kranz (followed by several modern editors) assigns it to The Purifications mainly because of its theological content. There is, however, good reason to suppose that it comes from On Nature. Tzetzes, quoting the lines, says that they are "from the third book of the Physika" (Chil. 7.522). Though the exact number of books in the physical poem is disputed, Tzetzes' comment makes it likely that B 134 (and B 131-133) belongs at the end of that poem. The theological content does not argue against this placement, since On Nature makes several references to gods (B 3, B 21, B 23, B 28, B 31). See a fuller treatment of this problem in Bignone (note 1) 477, 631-39, and also C. H. Kahn, "Religion and Natural Philosophy in Empedocles' Doctrine of the Soul" in Essays in A ncient Greek Philosophy, ed. by J. Anton and G. Kustas (Albany, N.Y. 1971) 5, 23 n. 8; G. Zuntz, "De Empedoclis Librorum Numero Coniectura", Mnemosyne 18 ser. 4 (1965) 365 and Zuntz (note 1) 211-18. These all believe that B 134 belongs in the poem On Nature. See also N. van der Ben, The Proem of Empedocles' Peri Physios (Amsterdam 1975) 11-16, 68-71. 3 References to phren in the Presocratics are few. Phren is found first in B 25 of Xenophanes. Empedocles speaks once of the god as a phren (B 134) and refers six times to man's phren (these passages will be discussed later). After Empedocles, Democritus twice mentions the phren of man (68 B 125 and B 129). 176</page><page sequence="3">panta by the phren of his noos (v6ou ppevL)". Regarding the phrase noou phreni, the article suggests that phren describes by implication the shape of the god.4 The present paper presents a summary of phren in earlier writers which is discussed more fully there.6 Phrenes are not the diaphragm nor the lungs but are psychic entities located gener- ally in the chest region. They apparently have a shape that is en- compassing or round. These phrenes frequently serve as the location of other psychic entities and also of emotional, volitional, and in- tellectual activities. Xenophanes, I believe, assumes that the world (panta) is contained in the spherical phren of the god. Within this phren the god's noos is also found. The god sets panta in motion by the instrument of his phren that belongs to his noos (noou phreni, B 25). He is not identified with his phren, as is Empedocles' god, but surrounds his phren as an apeiron entity (B 28). The full picture of Xenophanes' god is that of a deity manifesting himself in an apeiron entity, surrounding his phren that contains both panta and the noos by which he directs the activity of the world. Empedocles, in my opinion, offers a somewhat similar picture of his deity: the god is a round or spherical phren, encompassing the cosmos6 and darting through it with his phrontides. Unlike Xenophanes, how- ever, whose god has a phren and also surrounds this phren as an apeiron entity, Empedocles' god is only a phren. Empedocles has been suf- ficiently influenced by Parmenides to reject the existence of an apeiron entity in addition to the sphere (- the phren) where Being is found.7 Empedocles sees Being in a diversified way (made up of Love, Strife, and the four elements) but its composite shape is similar ' For bibliography on phren see my article "Noos Precedes Phren in Lyric Poetry" to appear in L'Antiquitd classique (1977) note 1.

Empedocles uses the term apeiron to describe the sphere of Love (B 28: see below); he does not use it to indicate a divine substance beyond the world enclosing it. T6 wav has become 'r&amp; 7&amp;vTox for Empedocles, but there can be nothing in addition to the sphere of Being. There is the phren Vouivov (B 134), holding its phronti- des (whose identity will be discussed below) and the cosmos (made up of the four elements). Empedocles' god was a phren and possessed the attributes of a phren: both activity and shape. In writers earlier than Empedocles phrenes act not only as the location of but also partakers in emotional, volitional, and intellectual functions.8 When used with verbs indicating intellectual activity, phrenes usuaRly act as a means or location.9 Unlike nous, which serves primarily as an inner organ of sight that grasps the reality of a situation,'0 phrenes deliberate. In Homer, Hesiod, and the lyric poets phrenes apparently deliberate about what the noos intuitively sees. Phrenes thus consider possibilities of action that may be opposite in nature. Phrenes do not immediately grasp what is the best course of action but search for it. Phrenes are in no way limited to intellectual activity but experience various emotions. Joy, desire, courage, eagerness, anger, pain, grief, and pity: all these phrenes feel."' Love, too, which functions so pre- dominantly in Empedocles' fragments,'2 seizes and harasses phrenes.13 Diversity of function, therefore, is characteristic of phrenes. They can experience opposing thoughts and feelings. 8 See notes 4 and 5. * For a full discussion of these passages see also my article, "Noos Precedes Phren in Lyric Poetry" (note 4). 10 See K. von Fritz, "NOYE and NOEIN in the Homeric Poems", CP 38 (1943) 79-93 and "NOYE, NOEIN and their Derivatives in Pre-Socratic Philosophy (Excluding Anaxagoras)", CP 40 (1945) 223-42 and CP 41 (1946) 12-34 and Darcus, "Noos Precedes Phren" (note 4), note 1 (for bibliography).

(B 133.1-3) Phrenes are important as a seat of man's wisdom (B 15.1). Learning makes phrenes greater (B 17.14). Man must take precautions to prevent his phren from being deceived (B 23.9-10). It is hard to establish belief within man's phren (B 114.2-3), but evidence from the senses most quickly brings conviction (B 133.1-3). These passages suggest that phren in man functioned to grasp the views Empedocles presents in his poems. Phren draws information from the senses. Man, however, must be cautious: phren can be deceived. Since he describes his god as a phren, Empedocles must have thought that the activity of phren in man was of great importance. Nonetheless he does not deny that nous is also active in man. He says that the sum total of reality is outside the grasp of nous (B 2.8). Men devour one another because their nous fails to recognise what they are doing (B 136.2). Empedocles urges Pausanias not to sit with dazed eyes but to gaze on Love with his nous (B 17.21). He also calls the "blood around the heart" noema (B 105.3) and says that all things have phronesis and a share in noema (B 110.10).14 With its intuitive vision 14 Noein occurs twice in Empedocles. The senses prove a T6poc voiamt and should all be treated equally (B 3.12). Pausanias must noein in which way each thing is clear (B 3.13). The verb apparently indicates the activity by which man gains a clear grasp of the truth. It is significant that Parmenides uses noein to in- dicate the grasp of truth that nous can have (28 B 2.2, B 3, B 6.1, B 8.8, B 8.34, B 8.36) but speaks of phronein in B 16.3 when referring to noema that may be a mixture of truth and falsehood. 179</page><page sequence="6">nous can apparently see what phren cannot. But the task of weighing evidence and increasing wisdom falls chiefly to phren. Part of nous' function may be to grasp the significance of phren itself in man and especially the nature of the Divine Phren. In Empedocles the mentions of man's phren refer primarily to its intellectual function. This aspect predominates also in two of the three references to the verb phronein, whose root is connected to that of phren. Phronein is said to depend on the makeup of the individual (B 107.2, B 108). In the third reference (B 17.23), however, Empe- docles suggests that the activity of phronein has a wider significance, including emotion and feeling, here specifically love :15 n' CPLXO Cp povCOuat xoc'L &amp;psLLaX &amp;pyac 'eo5at ... "By which they experience loving thoughts (feelings) and complete peaceful works".16 Phren in writers earlier than Empedocles is often a seat of emotion (see above, page 178). Empedocles too probably thought that phren experienced feeling. The conception of phren found in writers before Empedocles, differing strongly from nous, suggests why he chose phren to describe his god. In Parmenides nous, its function noein, and its expression noema figure prominently.11 Parmenides rejects the evidence of doxa and trusts instead nous and its intuitive grasp of reality. Nous "sees" Being and its characteristics. Even though nous depends on the mixture of light and dark in man (28 B 16),18 it can perceive the light, 15 Cf. instances in early writers where phronein similarly has this extended significance: II. 7.70, 12.67, 16.373; Od. 18.232; Pindar, Pyth. 8.82 (phronein kaka); II. 5.116; Od. 6.313, 7.75 (phronein phila); II. 6.162, 4.219; Od. 1.43 (phronein agatha); Hesiod, Theogony 989 (phronein atala); Pindar, Nem. 4.95 (phronein malaka). 16 A. A. Long (note 1) 267 suggests an even more general sense for phronein in Empedocles: "consciousness". 17 Nous: 28 B 4.1, B 6.6, B,16.2. Noein: 28 B 2.2, B 3, B 6.1, B 8.8, B 8.34, B 8.36.

Where nous is mentioned in Empe- docles, it has the function of inner vision and can apparently grasp reality, just as in Parmenides. Empedocles, however, views the uni- verse differently. He does not wish to reject entirely plurality or change, though one stage of his world cycle strongly resembles Par- menides' Being. Empedocles seeks an explanation of the universe in the function, not of nous, but of phren, a psychic entity that expe- riences opposing feelings and thoughts. Empedocles says that the Holy Phren "darts through the cosmos with its swift phrontides" (B 134). Phrontis does not occur frequently in writers before Empedocles but where it does it has a range of functions that includes "thought", "care", and "worry". The passages where phrontis appears are as follows.19 Semonides says that the healthy man has no "phrontis of sickness" (29.9 D = West, Simonides 8.9). In Theognis phrontides that "weep for soul and life" take hold of men (729-30). Pindar refers to men who, by striving too hard, fail to achieve what they devise with their phrontis (Pyth. 2.90-92). Elsewhere he mentions taking "phrontis of wrestling" (Nem. 10.22). Bacchylides wonders "with what phrontides" Minos greeted Theseus as he returned from the sea (17.120). Frag. Adespota 995 (Page) says that phrontis drives men in different directions. Two passages of Pindar illustrate the emotional element of phrontis. He speaks of the joy of victory submitting the nous to "most sweet phrontides" (01.1.17-19). He also says that loves (gpwre) of different things bite the phrenes: when a man achieves his desires, he should hold the "alluring phrontis besides his foot" (Pyth. 10.59-62). Here phrontis is apparently the object of a man's love.20 Among the Presocratics Xenophanes first mentions phrontis: ~&amp;Ji5 8' e7cTk' t aL xocl X eO XOVr' ?VLOXU-TO 3Xj=pL'Co,v,req 4txv ?pown'a' otXv' 'EXXOc(a8 y.- (B 8.1-2) "I In Homer and Hesiod phrontis is used only as a proper name: II. 17.40; Od. 3.282; Hesiod, frag. 255 (Merkelbach-West). 'O Phrontis occurs also in Pindar fr. 24 (Snell) where the context is not clear. In fragment 182 (Snell) of Pindar and Bacchylides 26.15 the intellectual function of phrontis seems predominant. 181</page><page sequence="8">Phrontis may refer to his thought, feelings, or concerns.21 Besides B 134, Empedocles mentions phrontis one other time:22 El yap i(p)[.pEow gvcxkv 'tvo;, &amp;[LPpoTe MoiU3, 1TepX,ekpqeXocq &lt;Oa eoL&gt; Ala ypowr8og CXeLV ... (B 131.1-2) Here phrontis may be the thought and also the care of the goddess. The Divine Phren darts wuith phrontides. I suggest that these phron- tides are Love and Strife. Earlier writers show that the word had emotional content. Phren too in earlier writers loves; it can also be a location of hate.23 In my view phren for Empedocles encompasses and contains the cosmos which is made up of four elements. Love and Strife, i.e., the god's phrontides, move these elements. Thus the god, by his phrontides, brings about the formation of the world-order. All activities in the universe are manifestations of one or both phrontides. Because the god has two phrontides and because he darts with these phrontides in varying pattern, the universe goes through a four-stage cycle. The Holy Phren, which is the god, is the matrix of the universe that changes from one to many. The world cycle, involving the four stages of Complete Love, Increasing Strife, Complete Strife, and Increasing Love, takes place, I believe, within the Holy Phren.24 This world cycle may involve a double cosmogony and zoogony25 or, perhaps more likely (and the OL For a treatment of phrontis in Xenophanes B 8 see: T.

There is simply a "round sphere re- joicing in its circular stillness" (B 27).28 This sphere lacks anthropo- morphic features (B 29). It is apeiron (B 28). No longer does the god manifest himself as an apeiron entity surrounding the universe. Now in Empedocles the sphere, containing the universe, is itself called apeiron, the adjective indicating spherical shape. 26 Scholars accepting this view are: J.

What then of Strife who is equal to Love (B 17.18-19, 27-29)? The sphere of Love, in my opinion, is one of the forms and stages of the Holy Phren's activity. In this stage of Complete Love, the Phren is expressing one phrontis predominantly, Love. Strife is driven to the very edge of the sphere, i.e., the phren (B 35.9-11, B 36). When the phrontis, Strife, moves to the circumference, Love apparently spreads fully through the four elements and stills them. All elements are perfectly blended (B 27) and at rest. There is no motion, change, or difference; the sphere is both continuous and homogeneous (B 28, B 29). In Empedocles' view, this sphere of Love may be the ideal state of the universe but it cannot continue. The Divine Phren expresses two phrontides, not one alone, and these together cause the movement and rearrangement of the four elements. At a moment determined by the oath existing between Love and Strife (B 30), Phren begins to express more Strife than Love; necessity in the universe causes this change.

Strife and Love, in my view, act on the elements within the Phren, which itself varies in shape as it expresses in dif- ferent measure its phrontides, Love and Strife. After the stage of Complete Love, Strife becomes the predominant phrontis. It spreads through the universe and Love withdraws to the very centre of the atpop&amp;xtyR (B 35.4). Strife gradually separates out the elements from the homogeneous mass formed by Love until each element is isolated by itself. The fragments do not say what shape the completely separated elements have but some interpreters suggest that they may be ranged in four concentric spheres.34 My view is that the elements, however they are arranged, are held within the Divine Phren, which at this time remains roughly spherical. As Love increases again (B 35), the elements, separated and distin- guished by Strife, are ready to form first the physical world, then all living creatures. Love moves from its place in the centre of the =po- p&amp;Xty4, gradually pushing Strife back to the circumference (B 35. 11-12). The Phren continues to dart with two phrontides until it again expresses mostly Love. The Holy Phren then is the matrix for the formation of the world- order. The four elements apparently form the limbs (melea, guia) of the god (B 27 a, B 30, B 31, B 35.11). The god darts (xoarxtaaco)35 with his phrontides; the elements run (Hw: B 17.34-35, B 21.13-14, B 26. 3-4) through one another, drawing their motion from the god's phrontides. Empedocles' vision is of a living deity whose phrontides, acting on his limbs, manifest him sometimes as one homogeneous sphere, at other times as a multiple being. Is there some relationship between this Holy Phren of On Nature and the daimon of The Purifications? If so, Empedocles' thought has I3 See Barnes (note 1) 23 and P. J. Bicknell, "The Shape of the Cosmos in Empedocles", PP 23 (1968) 118-19. Guthrie (note 1) 186, 190-91, says that the universe is approximately spherical or egg-shaped. O'Brien (note 7) 127-45, assumes that Love and Strife maintain "very roughly the shapes of respectively a solid and a hollow sphere throughout the cycle" (129). 8' Millerd (note 25) 56; Bignone (note 1) 223; Frenkian (note 30) 54-55; Kirk and Raven (note 25) 346; Bollack I (note 6 or 26) 169; Guthrie (note 1) 177; O'Brien (note 7) 146-55. 85 Kcxxtaac, is found first in Empedocles B 134.5 and B 100.7.

First, then, what is daimon (B 115.5 and B 59.1)?36 The word comes from the root *dai-, meaning "to apportion". In writers earlier than Empedocles, daimon is usually a divine being, inferior to theoi and responsible for assigning man his lot.37 Empedocles uses the term to describe the divine being who has fallen from the company of the gods and is forced to undergo purifi- cation through transmigration. In man daimon is an active force work- ing within to shape his life. Daimones are apparently different from the &amp;ot 8o0tXactcVe men- tioned in the physical poem (B 21.12, B 28.8), from the gods who are the source of inspiration (B 3.1, B 23.11), from the gods who deter- mine the fall of daimones (B 115.1) and about whom men should have a true account (B 131.4, B 132.2).Y8 Although Empedocles describes himself as a %c6q &amp;[?3po'os (B 112.4) and says that those men who are about to escape the cycle of rebirth become "&amp;eo( highest in honour" (B 146.3), he refers in both these instances to the purified daimon who is about to rejoin the gods. Daimon remains, then, distinct from theos. Empedocles' choice of the word daimon is not arbitrary: it de- notes a being capable of enjoying the company of theoi yet less than they, since it can fall from their company. Man's daimon is distinct from his life-principle and thought. Em- pedocles uses psyche (B 138) and thumos (B 128.10, B 137.6) to indicate man's life-principle.39 The "blood around his heart" (B 105) is man's thought. Daimon, however, determines how long the elements composing the body can perform their various functions. A person lives as long as his daimon is present; on death daimon migrates elsewhere.

" See a full discussion of daimon in writers earlier than Empedocles in Darcus (note 36). 'S In B 31 the theos, according to the view presented in this paper, is the Holy Phren. In B 128.3 Empedocles speaks in terms of anthropomorphic gods, em- phasizing the role of Cypris. Daimon is distinct from the Holy Phren and anthropomorphic gods. "9 Thumos is also the seat of grief (B 145.2). 186</page><page sequence="13">In On Nature Empedocles reduces the universe to six basic compo- nents, Love, Strife, and the four elements. Daimon poses a dilemma: is it made of some or all these components or is it an entity separate from these? First, then, is daimon composed of one or more of the four elements?40 This is unlikely since the elements violently reject and hate daimon (B 115.9-14). For daimon flesh, made of the four elements, is an "alien garment" (B 126). The four elements do not foim daimon but are the setting of its exile. What is daimon's relation to Love and Strife? One interpretation is that daimon is a particle of Love.4' According to this view, when daimon puts its trust in Strife, it becomes contaminated with Strife and only when it rids itself of this Strife does it become again pure Love and return to union with Love itself. This interpretation violates principles of Parmenides that Empe- docles was careful to respect.42 As Parmenides had shown in the Way of Doxa, if multiplicity were to exist, there had to be two principles, each with its distinctive nature. One principle could never become two opposite principles. Love alone, therefore, could not account for a world of plurality; Strife too had to exist. If daimon were a particle of Love, it could never put its trust in Strife since Love cannot hate.43 Daimon therefore must be an entity that can both love and hate. It is not simply contaminated with Strife during its exile but is always capable of hate, even in its state of bliss. Daimon is not composed of Love, Strife, or the four elements but is a separate entity, divine in nature, that expresses Love and Strife. Such, in my opinion, is the fallen deity described in B 115.5. Daimon gives man the ability to love and to hate. For Empedocles these two powers in large measure determine man's behaviour just as Love and Strife in the Holy Phren determine the behaviour of the universe. Empedocles believes that man should focus on his impulses to love and to hate that exist within him and should choose love. 4' This is the view of Barnes (note 1) 22. Kahn in his "Retractationes" in Essays in Greek Philosophy (note 2) 37-38, suggests that daimon may have an elemental nature similar to the sphere of Love when all elements are perfectly blended. "1 See Cornford (note 30) 563-69; H. S. Long (note 1) 156-57; Kirk and Raven (note 25) 359; O'Brien (note 7) 325-36; Kahn (note 2) 14-22, 38. Guthrie (note 1) 261-63, believes that daimon is a particle of the Divine Phren (see above note 30) whose influence on the world is Love. It seems that in Guthrie's view daimon's nature too was to express love. "' See above note 7. 68 Note that in B 109 man sees Love by Love, Hate by Hate. 187</page><page sequence="14">Daimon is mentioned also in the physical poem in B 59: ausa 7z1 xO _ .?L40V aIyCVo 8(tFLOVL 8CA11L6V, ITMUTOC re T? .L7TC aXOV 067r auVexupacv gxxatn, 6.XCTC 7CpOq~ vCOL 7ZO?XM%&amp; -L7Ve CXY~ ykvovro. This fragment has been interpreted in different ways. Usually one daimon is identified with Love, the other with Strife.44 Another view suggests that each daimon is one of the four elements which Empe- docles elsewhere (B 6) describes as divinities.45 A third view assumes that daimon, being identical with daimon in The Purifications, is a particle of Love.46 My view is that daimon in B 59 is an entity which both loves and hates, just as in B 115. The Divine Phren, by loving and hating, creates the universe. Daimon apparently draws its power to love and hate from this god, sharing some of his velocity and force. Empedocles refers to the movement of daimones. They wander (&amp;XSvBaaL: B 115.6) and mingle with one another (B 59.1). The activity of daimon, as it loves and hates within the various living creatures into which it migrates, partly explains why the world-order follows its changing pattern. In B 59 then Empedocles describes the result of one daimon, able to love and hate, meeting with another, which also loves and hates. Each daimon is a bearer of powers whose inter- action causes the formation (as described in B 59) or disintegration of different objects. Daimon functions as an agent of the Divine Phren which is loving and hating. Daimon has characteristics parallel to those of the Divine Phren. [1] Daimon expresses love, love and hate, or hate alone. So too the god. [2] Daimon undergoes a cycle within living creatures because it chooses to hate as well as to love. The god, by expressing love and hate, brings about the world-order. [3] Daimon's cycle resembles the cycle of four stages that takes place in the Holy Phren.47 Daimon first completely loves, then hates and loves, and gradually comes to love completely again. Likewise the god. First daimon is among the gods; 34 J.

This stage corresponds to the sphere of Love in the Holy Phren (B 27-B 29). The fall of daimon (B 115, B 136, B 137) parallels the break-up of the sphere of Love (B 26, B 30, B 31). The exile of daimon corresponds to the stages of Increasing Strife, Complete Strife, and Increasing Love (B 17, B 21, B 26, B 38, B 57-62). The return of daimon to the gods (B 146, B 147) parallels the return of the world to the sphere of Love again (B 35). Daimon acts like the Holy Phren.48 When a world such as we know it exists, daimones of men are loving and hating just like the Holy Phren. If man's daimon begins to love, it will finally escape the cycle of rebirth. When the Holy Phren begins to express mostly Love, the world will return to the sphere. The daimonic cycle apparently takes place within the physical cycle. It is clear that daimones do not fall from the company of the gods when the universe is in the stage of Complete Love since matter is then all blended into one homogeneous sphere. Daimones move among the four elements during the stages of Increasing Strife, Complete Strife, and Increasing Love. Each daimon must wander for 30,000 seasons until it learns to choose love, not hate. Daimones likely escape during Increasing Love since they migrate through living creatures (formed during Increasing Love) to achieve purifica- tion. Not all daimones return at the same time to the gods though by the stage of Complete Love all have apparently been purified. Daimon functions within the framework of the Divine Phren and its cycle. It is not determined by the movements of Love, Strife, and the elements, but acts like the Divine Phren that controls all these. Its pattern of loving and hating follows that of the Divine Phren. There- fore it fits well into the physical cycle, even though each daimon individually chooses Strife at some point in time, falls from the company of the gods into the realm of the four elements, and makes its specific progress. Both the daimonic and physical cycles have the 48 It is possible that daimon acts in the phren of man just as the god's nature is a phren. Empedocles does not state explicitly where daimon is located in man but it may have been around or within the phren. Pindar, at any rate, speaks of the daimon surrounding his phrenes (Pyth. 3.108). Phren usuaUy seems a seat of wisdom (B 15.1, B 17.14, B 23.9, B 114.3, B 133.3) but it may love and hate too (in B 17.23 men A?Dx cppoviOuaL). Empedocles finds the truth about the uni- verse in Love and Strife (Hate). These functions are associated primarily with daimon but perhaps also with phren, as in the case of the god. 189</page><page sequence="16">same cause: the Holy Phren expresses two phrontides, Love and Strife, and daimon, these same feelings. The state of purification for each may be Love but both are subject to necessity (B 26.2, B 30, B 115.2, B 116). Time will never be free of Love and Strife (B 16) nor will daimones, although they escape for a time, be forever secure against putting their trust in Strife. The explanation of the universe is found in the varied pattern that the god, the Holy Phren, follows in express- ing its phrontides. The explanation for man's religious nature and progress is found in his daimon that loves and hates. Daimon parallels the Holy Phren. This is the source of unity in the two poems of Em- pedocles.
