<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Success and Failure in Mahler’s Sonata Recapitulations seth monahan This study brings Hepokoski and Darcy’s formal/dramatic categories of recapitulatory “success” and  “failure” to bear on Mahler’s canon of symphonic sonatas. Prior to the Seventh Symphony, Mahler  linked expression and formal process with striking regularity: early- or middle-period sonatas ending  affirmatively tended to feature properly functioning recapitulations, while sonatas ending tragically  showed themselves incapable of such tonal resolution. Just as strikingly, the pattern changes in the  composer’s late maturity: after 1905, Mahler seems less inclined to dramatize the tonic/non-tonic  tensions that motivated his earlier works.
