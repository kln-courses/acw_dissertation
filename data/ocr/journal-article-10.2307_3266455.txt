<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews range of problems (literary-critical, semantical, and conceptual) posed by the texts he treats, as well as his interaction with a wide body of relevant secondary literature, lead Schulz-Rauch to highly nuanced conclusions about how the two prophets use a given theme or motif. His final proposals to account for the Hosea-Jeremiah relationship are appropriately cautious and sober. Given these features, Schulz-Rauch's study might well serve as a model for further such (re-)investigations, that is, of additional points of con- tact between Hosea and Jeremiah (e.g., kingship or the image of God) or other prophetic "pairs" (e.g., Jeremiah and Ezekiel). What difficulties I had with this work concerned more its mode of presentation than its content or conclusions. To this nonnative reader, Schulz-Rauch's German sen- tences appear especially long and convoluted. The movement of thought among the var- ious subsections of the three core chapters is sometimes difficult to follow. His use of italics for emphasis also seems overworked; sentences so printed appear on virtually every page. Outright errors are few. I did, however, note two such: the prominent femi- nist exegete Gale Yee is referred to with a masculine possessive adjective (!) on p. 14, while on p. 207 the reference should be to 2 rather than 1 Kgs 8:20. In any case, I hope that Schulz-Rauch's monograph will enjoy a "shelf-life" compa- rable to that which GroB's work has had among scholars. Christopher T. Begg, Catholic University of America, Washington, DC 20064 Metaphorisches Reden von G-tt im Hoseabuch, by Birgitte Seifert. FRLANT 166. Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1996. Pp. 285. N.P. Seifert's study of metaphorical language concerning the deity in the book of Hosea is a work of critical biblical scholarship that is written with an eye to the concerns with metaphor in the fields of systematic and practical theology. She begins with Aristotle's classic definition of metaphor: "Metaphor is the transference of a truly different mean- ing to a word, from genre to individual form, or from individual form to genre, or from one individual form to another, or through analogy." Various impulses from philosophy, linguistics, literary criticism, and theology, however, have raised questions concerning the classical definition of metaphor. The focus of metaphor can no longer be limited to individual words, but larger linguistic expressions and the contexts in which they occur must be considered as language by nature is polyvalent or capable of communicating a variety of meanings and images depending upon the conditions in which it is expressed and understood. Seifert maintains that metaphor is basically a semantic phenomenon in which the meanings of "spoken" words are not fixed, but stand in question. Her survey of research in the field of"metaphorology" points to several important developments. H. Weinrich demonstrates that individual words appear in both a syntagmatic and a paradigmatic order in which they interact as "word fields" to produce an "image field." C. Stoffer- Heibel focuses on the performance of communication in which semantic innovation occurs, rendering the classical concept of brief analogy meaningless. Whereas Aristotle emphasizes the metaphorical reference to "objective" truth, P. Ricoeur portrays metaphor in relation to hypothetical truth or perspective. I. A. Richards points to metaphor as a fundamental principle of speech, and M. Black notes the interactive char- 527</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Biblical Literature acter of the elements of metaphor in utterances. E. Jiingel points to metaphor as an occurrence or assertion of truth. Based upon this survey, Seifert asserts that thought is fundamentally metaphorical and that consequently there is a basic metaphorical structure to speech that requires critical reflection. Insofar as metaphor derives its power of expression by bringing two spheres of reality together, metaphorical theory provides a basis for investigating the means by which G-d is understood and articulated in theology. This points to her con- cern with allegory, which returns to the basic approach by which the Christian church has traditionally interpreted scripture. For Seifert, metaphorical human speech about G-d constitutes a form of revelation that expresses a new coming of G-d. This raises problems, especially as allegory was used so extensively in Christian exegesis to change the meaning or interpretation of biblical texts from reference to the historical reality of the nation Israel (or Judah) to a concern with the much later reality of the Christian church. In such a system, texts may no longer mean what they claim to mean, but are read in relation to something different. Metaphorical expression both grants power to scripture to speak to new contexts and qualifies scripture in that it transfers meaning and thereby undermines its truth claims. Furthermore, metaphorical expression relies heav- ily upon anthropomorphism so that the (human) body or form of Jesus is employed to present an image of and truth claims about G-d. But this raises questions concerning the use of metaphorical speech about G-d. If metaphor and analogy are legitimate means to speak about G-d in the Bible, why are some anthropomorphic or natural images appro- priate for the rendering of G-d in either Jewish or Christian thought whereas others are considered inappropriate or pagan? Islam later recognized this problem and attempted to dispense with such anthropomorphisms completely, but it was never entirely success- ful in doing so. Despite these theoretical reservations, Seifert's application of metaphorical theory to the exegesis of Hosea offers many insights into the textual representation of G-d. She chooses an interactive model by which to track the portrayal of G-d in relation to Israel that stresses four major themes: betrayed love; continuous care; threatened corruption; and incomprehensible mercy. Nevertheless, her work raises some very challenging the- ological questions. Seifert's discussion of betrayed love points to various texts in which the marriage relationship between Israel and YHWH appears, as well as the overarching theme of har- lotry. She employs traditional literary-, text-, and redaction-critical tools to identify and establish texts that portray Israel as the "wife" who betrays the love of YHWH the "hus- band." Overall, the metaphors studied here are well known, but it is interesting that she points to the implications of this metaphor for feminist theology only by asserting that such metaphors clearly discriminate against women. It is here that she fails to grasp an important communicative element in the presentation of Hosea as text. Only YHWH (and Hosea) speak in this text; Israel/the wife does not. One might ask whether it is actu- ally Israel or YHWH who has betrayed the relationship in this text. Does YHWH accuse Israel of betrayal in order to mask his own abandonment of the covenant or inability to protect Israel when faced with an Assyrian threat? Such a question undoubtedly occurred to many in Israel during Hosea's time, but they do not speak in this text. Seifert accepts the truth claims of her texts as they are presented to her, but she is not able to step outside of her texts sufficiently so that she might question them critically. 528</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews Such questions must stand in the forefront theologically in relation to the theme of "threatened corruption/destruction." For example, YHWH is the "moth" who brings destruction upon Israel (Hos 5:12), and she correctly notes that G-d becomes question- able insofar as G-d seems not to value the divine attributes of sovereignty and indispens- ability. She notes that YHWH's betrayed love makes the misfortunes of Israel's corruption/ destruction even more bitter, i.e., Israel had its chance but squandered it. Although such a lesson is tied to concrete historical events, she claims that it is relevant to future generations. But once again the truth claims of the text come into question as one must ask whether it was Israel or YHWH who squandered the opportunity. The book of Hosea asserts that Israel sinned, but is this really the case? Or is this assertion simply a proposal to explain either real or impending disaster? Her discussion of continuous care is especially insightful insofar as it portrays YHWH as loving parent in Hos 11:1-7. Verse 4 has been a longstanding crux, particularly in regard to the statement that YHWH will be as those who "raise the yoke (sb) upon their cheeks," generally understood as YHWH'S act of freeing the people of Israel. Seifert points to the reading bI, "suckling babe" (see BHS notes), and by means of a thorough philological discussion points to the imagery of YHWH as a mother who breastfeeds her infant. Some of her discussion is speculative, but she recovers an image that may well have stood in an earlier form of the prophet's discourse, and points to YHWH as mother as well as father and as healer/sustainer as well as judge in Hosea. Her discussion of incomprehensible mercy thereby become comprehensible. If YHWH is mother, how can "he" give up "his" babes? Indeed, Hosea employs the analogy of some very human images in an attempt to convey the reality of a very non-human G-d. In sum, Seifert's study points to both the richness and limits of the metaphorical portrayal of G-d in the book of Hosea. Marvin A. Sweeney, Claremont School of Theology and Claremont Graduate University, Claremont, CA 91711 The True Israel: Uses of the Names Jew, Hebrew, and Israel in Ancient Jewish and Early Christian Literature, by Graham Harvey. AGJU 35. Leiden/New York/Cologne: Brill, 1996. Pp. xviii + 303. $106.50. In studying ancient Jewish identity-a topic of increasing scholarly interest-some attention will naturally fall on Jewish self-designation, on the hypothesis that names can bear multiple and subtle connotations. Moreover, in noting the variety of names employed, it is natural to enquire into the pattern of their usage and to ask if each carries different freight. Given the range and complexity of ancient Jewish literature, such might be a large enough task in itself, but in this monograph (based on a Ph.D. disserta- tion from the University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, England) Graham Harvey also seeks to survey the habits of early Christian literature, where one might expect the painful process of separation from Judaism to affect the use of these appellations in significant ways. The result is a highly ambitious project, valuable in its goals, its range, and its col- lection of data, but analytically superficial and disappointing in its tendency to force on the evidence somewhat over-generalized conclusions.
