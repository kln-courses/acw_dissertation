<plain_text><page sequence="1">FILM * ROBERT W. WAGNER THE CASE FOR CHILDREN'S FILMS A "children's film," according to the rules of the International Film Festival of Edinburgh, is one "... . which has not had a general commercial release to adult audiences and which, by a signed decla- ration of the producing company, is intended primarily for exhi- bition to special audiences of children." This concept excludes the instructional film, even though designed for a specific age or grade level, since the emphasis is on entertainment rather than education. It also excludes the "family type" film, since children are considered a "special audience." It implies that there must be special films for children, just as we have books for children, children's theaters, children's recordings, and children's radio and television programs. Communist-controlled countries have placed a priority on the production of films whose target audience is young people. At the Children's Film Festival in Bombay, in 1955, Russia showed 5 features and 21 short subjects for children; Czechoslovakia, 6; East Germany, 2; China, 1. It is reported that 100 puppet and cartoon films for children are being produced in special studios in Moscow each year. Not only are these films being used to indoctrinate, but also as devices by which to study child psychology, since production and research on how to make these films more effective are going on hand in hand. In Great Britain, too, special entertainment films for children have been produced. Here the film industry itself, rather than the government, has taken the initiative. The J. Arthur Rank Organization first sponsored the production of special films for Robert W.

In 1951, the Children's Film Foundation, with a grant from the British Film Production Fund, carried on the work under the leadership of Mary Field. Films produced by the Foundation, although they may be rented by schools, are shown primarily in Saturday morning children's cinema clubs or children's matinees. More than one-third of the British theaters open their doors to these cinema clubs, which have an estimated weekly attendance of 1,000,000 children. The pro- gram, arranged by the theater managers themselves, may include, in addition to a production of the British Film Foundation, one or two short subjects, a cartoon, an installment of a serial, or possibly a feature film booked from a list selected by the British Board of Film Censors as especially suitable for children. In the United States, major studios have never produced films specifically for children. Contrary to popular opinion, Disney's work has always been directed to the general audience. Gilbert Seldes has characterized Disney's characters as "partly Aesop with a touch of La Fontaine, perhaps, but they were never children's book animals."' Like the weekly television series, Disneyland, whose audience is 80 percent adult, Pinocchio, Rob Roy, Cinderella, Alice in Wonderland, Tom Sawyer, Treasure Island, Snowo White, Peter Pan, and other feature films although taken from "children's classics," were produced for family audiences. The same is true of UPA's engaging television cartoon show, Gerald McBoing Boing, which appears to be simple enough for children, yet sophisticated enough for adults, for whom, according to UPA's executive director, Stephen Bosustow, these films are intended. The producers of the American entertainment film, perhaps more than any other production group in the world, are adept at creating films attractive to the widest possible audience-an audi- ence which, in fact, in the U.S.A., is actually composed mainly of young people. The western, certain types of comedy, and the cartoon film have, in theme and treatment, aokind of universal appeal to "the young in heart of all ages." The National Children's Film Library, established by the Motion Picture Association of America, has collected more than 60 such films, and operates under a philosophy clearly stated in its report to UNESCO in 1950: "In the opinion of the National Children's Film Library Committee, it is not desirable that special films be produced for 'Seldes, Gilbert.

On purely theoretical grounds it is not true that children need special pictures in the same way they need special toys and special books. Much faulty thinking arises from this loose analogy between books and motion pictures. "Because books must be read, there is a need for simply- written books for children under twelve. Children's books are needed because lack of vocabulary and of experience that lends meanings to words interposes an insuperable barrier between the child and the story. "In the motion pictures, no such barriers exist. The child experiences the story content directly through his senses. He lives the story vicariously." The report states that most "children's literature" was not really written for children at all, but is composed of fairy tales, fantasies, and folklore passed on from adults to adults, and goes on to say: "After all, the child does not live in a 'special' world. He lives in an adult world, and from the age of eight on, he is accustoming himself to living in that world. "When pictures are deliberately drained of adult back- grounds and implications, the world they create is an unreal one. It is narrowed, emasculated, and distorted by oversimpli- fication. Thus, to the American child it does not ring true. "We emphasize the word, 'American,' for our children have already had wide experience with non-juvenile films. Pictures made especially for them are not popular and are considered dull by the children themselves. Inescapably an air of con- decension characterizes films-and books-made especially for children. "Top writers, producers, directors, and actors can create films with the necessary integrity, honesty, and simplicity needed for children. But a book or a film with these qualities possess the same appeal for adults! "In our experience with regard to films, there is a definite area in which the tastes of adults and children happily coincide. Such films appeal to the universal audience-the young in heart of all ages. These are the subjects which we believe to be the most desirable for the entertainment and incidental education of our children through recreation." The premise of the National Children's Film Library poses a number of obvious assumptions: 1. That there is no difference between the perception of a child and that of the adult.</page><page sequence="4">FILM 479 2. That, unlike words, pictures automatically overcome barriers to understanding. 3. That all children over eight years of age are alike and presumably need to be thrown, sink or swim, into a realistic, adult world. 4. That films being produced by Hollywood accurately represent that realistic, adult world. 5. That American children in particular, having seen a lot of adult films, can assimilate other adult film experiences faster than children of other lands. 6. If special films were produced for American children, they would find such films inescapably dull, unrealistic, and distasteful. Space does not permit a complete analysis of the position of the Children's Film Library. However, certainly an important reason for Hollywood's reluctance to produce films for children is not a philosophical one at all. It is the realistic one that we can have entertainment films which are deliberately aimed at a specific, limited audience only when it becomes economically practical to make such films. Producers of the teaching film-Encyclopaedia Britannica, McGraw-Hill, Coronet, and others-have learned, through long, hard experience, to cope with the difficult problems of producing and marketing non-theatrical films for specific levels of childhood. But the impetus for the production of entertainment films for children has gained whatever momentum it has in the United States because of a need for material for children's television programs which, in turn, have been stimulated by the realization on the part of national advertisers of the potential of the child market. The Mickey Mouse Club, for example, is a daily, hour-long vehicle for advertising soft drinks, vitamin tablets, adhesive tape, and, of course, Disney's own films, his Mickey Mouse Magazine, the Disneyland Amusement Park, and other Disney products and enter- prises. But it has also resulted in the development of new cartoon films, a children's newsreel, and occasional children's documentary subjects, sometimes narrated by one of the "Mouseketeers"-mem- bers of a kind of sophisticated "Our Gang." Perhaps, in the long run, the small, independent producer may be better situated economically and methodologically to make films for children than the major producer in Hollywood. The successful Picture Book Parade films which appeared on Captain Kangaroo (CBS-TV), for example, were produced by a very small production unit, with a minimum of technical gadgetry.</page><page sequence="5">480 AUDIO-VISUAL COMMUNICATION REVIEW Described as "iconographic" to distinguish them from conven- tional cell-animation, these films are simply, as Morton Schindel, the producer, describes them, "a combination of fluid camera action upon pictures, illustrative music, sensitive reading of the text, and suggestive sound effects." The art work is taken directly from favorite children's books including Millions of Cats, The Story about Ping, Hercules, Stone Soup, The Red Carpet, Andy and the Lion, Make Way for Ducklings, and others.2 And while they were used on television to entertain, and to help sell cough drops, candy bars, and a brand of children's shoes, they brought to the younger age groups an experience designed specifically for children. Can the adult perceive as the child? Can he duplicate, in con- tent and form, the true level of understanding involved ? Are adults, as Lewis Carroll rhymed to his youthful listener, "but older children, dear, who fret to find our bedtime near?" Or is the making of a child's book or film the process of picturing the reminiscences of old men and women who can only recall a child's world as it was? If the truth could be known, we would probably find that many audio-visual materials designed for children are little more than exercises in adult memory and, as Santayana put it, "a man's memory may almost become the art of continually varying and misrepresenting his past according to his interests in the present." We have much to learn about how children see. We do know that there is such a thing as "film illiteracy," and that a picture, even though ordinarily more readily understood than a word, is nevertheless still a symbol which must be "read." We know, too, that children's appreciation and understanding of pictures shift with age. Just as Wolfe and Fiske's studies of children's comic reading show that Bugs Bunny, Porky Pig, and other anthropomorphic characters are replaced in popularity by adventure stories after about age 12 and by "true" comics and classics after that, so the child's motion picture preferences also shift.4 A recent survey of picture preferences of 5500 British school children showed that those under six years of age preferred child- like, imaginative conceptions while those over six showed a marked preference for the factual. But there was also some suggestion of 2 Available from Weston Woods Studios, Westport, Connecticut. Most are ten minutes, sound. Sale price: $50, black and white; $100, color. SPeters, J. M. L.

A small sample of American and Chinese students included in the survey responded somewhat differently than the British group.5 Mary Field's studies of children's film preferences show that children from 7 to 12 years of age wanted to identify themselves with other children on the screen, and that the "good guys" have to win out over the "bad guys" until adolescence, when this outcome becomes somewhat less important. Field also notes that children's films are conceived differently in Europe, where they are mainly considered to be the puppet, cartoon, fairy story type, and in the United States, where they might also include westerns and fantastic adventure films.0 It might be added that these differences in con- ception are also affected by differences in the sociological and economic nature of the film industries of Europe and America. In short, the concept varies in different cultures, and what a children's film is depends upon what adults in those cultures think it should be. Adult conventions in technique or the "grammar of the film," for example, are also questionable in films for children. The use of optical effects such as fades, dissolves, wipes, and the like, is probably not justified because they may be neither noticed nor understood at the elementary level. The length of such films, the rate of development, the use of sound effects, music, and other ele- ments in children's entertainment films might well conform to findings already noticed in the field of educational film production. Experiments at Edinburgh during 1955-56 indicated that child commentators command attention not given to adult voices on film, that color attracts but of itself does not hold attention, and that children do not like to see other children misbehaving on the screen. Perhaps, in the production of children's films we have left out the principal ingredient-children themselves. Some attempts have been made to get children to picture their own world on motion picture film. Here and there, in the case of children's workshop films made in England, for example, we find films being made by children themselves. In experimental films made at the University of California at Los Angeles, professional film makers have encouraged children to supply the art work from which such films might be made. At Weston Woods Studios chil- dren are participating in production as critics and narrators, and are as much a part of the studio as the camera itself. SBethers, Ray.

Perhaps, instead of relying solely on existing children's literature as a source for children's films, we might let children make up and record their own stories, letting them draw or paint the pictures to go with their recorded text. The use of child narra- tors and child actors is becoming more common. Children talking to children must certainly be one of the signif- icant ways in which learning takes place. Children talking to chil- dren on film might be the most accurate reflection of the child's world-a world of the low-angle, a vivid, simplified world free of adult sophistry. Such films need not be unrealistic, dull, or unimaginative. Such presentations might not only improve the child's appreciation of adult films, but also might teach adults some- thing important about how to communicate with young people across the inevitable barrier of age. By bringing the child "into the picture," by becoming con- cerned with entertainment films for specific age levels, we might bring more uncensored pleasure to children and more insight to adults.</page></plain_text>
