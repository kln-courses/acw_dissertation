<plain_text><page sequence="1">News and Notes Archaeological zone of Dos Pilas occupied by waves of squatters GUATEMALA CITY (Prensa Libre/IDEAH). On February 24,1997,40 families of landless settlers invaded the archaeo logical reserve of Dos Pilas, Guatemala, eut down the forest within the zone, and built houses for themselves. The area cleared for milpas represents the destruction of a considerable portion of the Dos Pilas National Park. The settlers are families from the Alta Verapaz. On March 19, 1997, the National Council for Protected Areas (Consejo Nacional de Areas Protegidas, CONAP) reported the arrivai of 19 additional families in the Dos Pilas Reserve. According to CONAP and the Instituto de Antropología e Historia (IDAEH), houses have been built on the Great Plaza. Dos Pilas was the last small spot of virgin forest in the Petexbatun région of the Peten. Ongoing looting and destruction of archaeological sites in the Petexbatun as well as the total deforestation have led to a drastic decrease in tourism in the région. There is no word as yet as to what action, if any, the government plans to take to restore the zone's integrity and to protect this ecologically fragile région against further abuse. Structure 1 at El Tabasqueño falls victim to hurricanes AUGSBURG (Stephan Merk/A. Benavides). One of the best known, but rarely visited. Maya structures in the Chenes région, Structure 1, also known as the Temple-Palace, at the archaeological site of El Tabasqueño, has been partially de stroyed by forces of nature. According to information pro vided to mexicon in Nov. 1996 by Antonio Benavides, the building was severely damaged in November 1995 by two hurricanes, Opal and Roxanna. The Maya ruins of Tabasqueño were discovered and pho tographed precisely one Century earlier, in May 1895, by the K\ % Mi JA 1 Fig. 1.

Tabasquefio is a large, but mostly ruinous, site situated some 6 km north of the town of Dzibalchen, in the Mexican State of Campeche. Structure 1 is a partially fallen, but still impressive, two-storey stone structure of a large range-type building oriented east-west, that looks north and stands on a high natural hill. On top of the first storey is a well-known small temple in pure Chenes style with a beautifully worked façade showing a monster-mouth mask surrounding the door way on the north side and flanked by serpents and stacked Chac masks. This building had remained in very good condi tion since the time of its discovery. It once consisted of two rooms, one behind the other, but with no Connecting doorway. The room looking south collapsed long ago and only a few remains are visible today. Prior to the destruction caused by Opal and Roxanna, Antonio Benavides of the Centro Regional Campeche of the Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) had Consolidated and partially restored this extraordi nary building (Fig. 1). In the wake of the hurricanes, a large section of the north room was destroyed. The east section of the room, including the doorway, has totally collapsed at the front (Fig. 2). The back wall is not so badly damaged and a larger section has survived, as has most of the roofcomb. Ten of the several capstones are still in situ. Also collapsed is the large stucco figure in the medial moulding on the west side of the north front of Structure 1. Maya drawings and graffiti at Pasion del Cristo II, Campeche GRAZ (Karl H. Mayer).

Hellmuth and Jack Sulack, guided by Juan de la Cruz Briseño and a man from 20 de Noviembre, visited this ruin in the spring of 1991, where they took photographs, but none of these have been published yet. In January of 1996 the Mexican archaeologist Antonio Benavides Castillo visited this ruin and prepared notes and sketches. In order to distinguish between the two ruin groups which are approximately 600 m apart, the first group which had inscribed stelae will be designated Pasion del Cristo I, the second one with the wall décorations is Pasion del Cristo II, and the building with the three rooms is named Structure 1. There are drawings in black pigment and graffiti in all three rooms, but the most important images are located on a dividing wall between the central and north room, which is covered with a fine stucco coat. The dividing wall on the east side of the two rooms is more than 1.5 m high and 57 cm wide. On its south side there is a total of nine designs: one is incised and a graffito, designated as Graffito 1, and the remainder is obviously executed with a charcoal stick and designated Drawings 1 through 8. Graffito 1 is 30 cm high and 20 cm wide and represents a standing anthropomorphic figure in side view, tumed to the right (Fig. 1). The figure wears a textile shirt, a complex headdress with a possible reptile-head element, and a round earplug. Christian Prager, who has created line drawings of the Pasión del Cristo II images from photographs and has analyzed the figures, suggests that this female personage be identified as the Goddess O of the Postclassic Maya códices. Drawing 1 measures 6.5 cm in height and 7.5 cm in width and represents a human head in profile, turned to the right. Drawing 2 is 3.5 cm high and 26 cm Fig. 1. Graffito 1, Goddess O.

Later research revealed that this Maya sites was not a new discovery, but had already been visited in 1938 in the course of a Carnegie Institution of Washington expédition. The ruin, which was given no ñame at the time, is located about 500 m from the ruins of Pasion del Cristo, and was described as "a building formed of a single Chamber flanked at either end by a transverse room. The latter project only beyond one side of the central Chamber. Excavations had been made in the north talus exposing an opening in the wall; its west margin is in line with the west end wall of the central Chamber" (Karl Ruppert and John H. Denison, Jr., "Archaeo logical Reconnaissance in Campeche, Quintana Roo, and Peten." Carnegie Institution of Washington, Publication 543, Washington, D.C., p. 85). This is the complete description of this ruin and no drawings or photographs, and no mention of the images on the walls, were published. The only published reference to the wall designs is by Andrea Stone in her recent book, "Images from the Underworld: Naj Tunich and the Tradition of Maya Cave Painting" (University of Texas Press, Austin, 1995, p. 83): "Figures in the style of the Madrid Codex also occur in the Rio Bec area.

Of chronological importance is the fact that archaeological exca vations at Pasión del Cristo I have brought to light ceramic sherds of the types Idolos Modelled: Variety Unspecified (ca. 1200-1300 AD) and Cehac-Hunacti Composite: Variety Un specified (ca. 1300-1450 AD), types dating from the Middle Postclassic to the Protohistoric Period.

Discovered in 1990, Balamku is now being studied and excavated by archae ologists of the Mexican Instituto Nacional de Antropología e Historia (INAH) under the direction of Ramón Carrasco. Spread over some 10 acres, the site consists of three principal architectural groups. Structure I was built atop an Early Classic palace structure whose façade is adorned with a beautifully modelled and painted stucco frieze depicting the Maya underworld. In front of Structure V, which divides the main plaza, are ten stelae in Rio Bec style. East of the Great Plaza are a large acrópolis and a ballcourt. Just west of the ballcourt, figures of sacrificial victims have been carved into the bedrock. This past winter, the remains of a woman, covered in rubber or resin, were discovered deep within Structure XV. Fig. 3. Drawing 7, God B and rattlesnake.

Mr. Ignacio Pichardo Pagaza, Am bassador of Mexico to the Netherlands, announced the honour on behalf ofMexican President Zedillo in February 1997. Van Zantwijk is well-known in Mesoamerican studies for his important work on Tarascan culture and, to an even greater extent, for his considerable contributions to an understanding of Nahua civilization from Toltec times to the présent day. His fieldwork on Milpa Alta (Momochco Malacachtepec) and his interprétations of the Aztec worldview (as in his "The Aztec Arrangement") have become classics. He has also striven tirelessly to promote an accurate public understanding of the nature of Mesoamerican civilization through his numerous non-technical writings. We extend to him our congratulations.</page></plain_text>
