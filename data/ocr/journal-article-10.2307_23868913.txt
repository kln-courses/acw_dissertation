<plain_text><page sequence="1">Redford, Donald Β.: Akhenaten: The Heretic King. pp. XXVI + 295, II lustrated. Princeton University Press, Princeton N.J. 1984. A new profile of King Akhenaten (Amenophis IV), one of the last kings of the 18th Dynasty. Professor Redford's volume is a reassessment of this controversial monarch that he préfacés with an introduction summarizing the work of the Akhenaten Project with which the author himself has been directly associated, the aim of which was to reconstitute the vignettes, tableaux and hieroglyphic inscriptions from the salvaged talatat (building blocks) of Akhena ten's razed temples at Karnak. Divided into four parts, the first consisting of three chapters, forming a prologue to the main theme, sketching Akhenaten's Eighteenth Dynasty for bears, the Thutmosids whose conquests raised Egypt to the status of an impe rial power giving glimpses of the social changes the foregoing brought, including an unprecedented prosperity and an influx of foreigners. The third chapter dealing with the reign of Amenophis III when these territorial acquisitions were Consolidated and an epoch of international diplomacy initiated, Redford describes the functioning of the court, the army and the bureaucratie adminis tration and the rôles the king and his State entourage had in these activities. Amenophis III at his accession married Tiy, a commoner of Syrian extraction and though other consorts followed, it was the younger of the two maies of Tiy's six children, the elder having died young, who succeeded his father. It is to this monarch, Amenophis IV (Akhenaten) that the following two parts consisting of eight chapters constituting the main portion of the volume are devoted. It commences with a portraiture of the young king (chapter IV) to whom many have accorded a period of co-regency with Amenophis III but this is unsubstantiated since the formative years of Akhenaten are undelineated on the monuments of his predecessor. Neither do the vignettes appertaining to the first five years of his reign for which a hiatus existed until the reconstitution of the talatat, support any inference of this kind, sustaining only a building programme initiated at his accession and a Jubilee taking place in his third régnai year. Redford describes the recovery of the talatat and the stages of intensive work by those associated with the Akhenaten Project. Before matching the talatat yielded coherent résulte however, archaeological investigations were necessary and in chapters five and six, the location and excavation of the vestiges of Akhenaten's édifices are recapitulated. Though four structures are known to have been constructed, the Gm-(t) -p-itn commemorating the King's Jubilee detailed in chapter VII, the Rwd-mnw</page><page sequence="2">234 Besprechungen and Tni-mnw and Hwt-bnbn apparently denoting some connection with Helio polis, only the first and last have been identified. The reassembled vignettes are not confined to cultic or cérémonial implications but also exhibit those of a domestic import and in the last, Nefertity is featured with exceptional promi nence even to the exclusion of the King. Redford suggests it indicates Akhena ten's consort's political importance, reputed with little foundation as the daughter of Ay, but affirmed by the former as being of unknown antécédents. The scenes have a further importance since a progressive appearance of three princesses exemplifies the chronological succession of the four édifices, and reflect also the évolution of his cultic doctrines. The epithet, the „King's bodily daughter" challenges the pathological interprétation of Akhenaton's peculiar physical characteristics exhibiting a distinctive elongation of the head and pendulous paunch, deemed an endocrine disorder resulting in eunuchoidism. A form of hydrocephaly has also been diagnosed, and the same trait of an elon gated head is discernible in the monumental représentation of the princesses, for instance the Ashmolean Fresco and two busts in the Cairo and Berlin Museums respectively (E. J. Dingwall, London 1931). In the final chapter of part two (VIII), the abandonment of Thebes and the establishment of Akhenaten (Teil el Amarna), the centre of government during the remainder of the King's reign, are sketched. The third section comprising chapters IX and X examining Akhenaten's spiritual cultic philosophy, is prefaced by a short summary of the cult of Amun, an amalgam of earlier sun cults that in Amenophis ffl's time had expanded into a powerful hierarchy. Redford in absence of Akhenaten's earlier antécédents is not able to offer any premise as to what motivated the king to spurn the royal cult, though it is probable that political inadequacy may have had some share in his thinking that made him create an image suitable to his mode of thought. Declaring the older gods were no longer operative and redundant, he substi tuted the entire structure of Egyptian theogony for a single deity though one derived from it, that of Aten (Disk). The latter, a manifestation of Re Harakhty, was derived from the ancient Heliopolitan cultus and first represent ed as a falcon-headed male (plates 4.4. 4.5.) but as the King's iconoclasm developed, all forms of anthropomorphic représentation were expunged and Aten became transformed into a figurative rayed dise. As Redford emphasizes all that remained was a deity whose concepts were, to quote, transcendence, creativity and cosmic regulating, symbolizing the absolute. As it is remarked, for Akhenaten, Aten was an abstract deity mirroring the sun-disc, the hyposta sis of divine kingship. Consisting of five chapters, the fourth and final part is a précis of the last part of Akhenaton's reign and the notables of his court. The King is featured as vaccillating and prone to sycophancy and his indecisiveness is exemplified in the Teil el Amarna Tablets. He provided Queen Nefertity however, with three additional daughters, but his consort seems to have fallen into disfavour as another woman Kiye makes a brief appearance. Both were apparently sup planted by Meritaten, the King's eldest daughter who became Mistress of her father's household and spouse of Smenkhkare, reputed brother of Tutan khamun. The reigns of the last and the remaining pharaohs of the 18th Dyna sty, Ay and Horemheb who eradicated Akhenaten's monotheism, razing his sun temples, the talatat of which were scattered throughout Egypt, are described in chapters XII, XIII, XIV.</page><page sequence="3">Afrikanistik 235 Even in death Akhenaten has remained an enigma. The controversy concern ing the mummified body thought to have been his, but more likely Smenkhka re's is well known and briefly discussed by Redford on page 189. One may speculate on Akhenaten's funerary obsequies. Was there a hymn retaining some vestige of an Afterlife akin to the Heliopolitan doctrine of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties stripped of its anthropomorphic implications, envisaging he would be assimilated with the Sun-Disk, an apotheosis with his Father, a totalitarian deity ? Redford visualizes the latter, an embodiment of a celestial power who claimed universal truth and submission. Redford's volume is a clear concise composition concerning the events of the last part of the Eighteenth Dynasty and clarifies many obscure features, particularly the Theban interlude of Akhenaten's reign. Spéculative interpréta tions are reduced to a minimum. He provides a comprehensive factual picture as far as the constraints of knowledge permit, largely augmented by the Akhe naten Project, of a monarch who though he discarded the mythology of his time has become the subject of a modem one. The volume has many monochrome and line illustrations and Princeton University Press is to be congratulated on its excellent présentation. L.M. Young (Hove)</page></plain_text>
