THE FORELIFE OF IDEAS AND THE AFTERLIFE OF TEXTS by Harry Fox University of Toronto Dept. of Near Eastern Studies 4 Bancroft Ave. Toronto. Ont. M5S-1A1 CANADA Summary Ideas in antiquity rarely arise in splendid isolation. Even if this were the case, these ideas have reached us only because of their continuing influence on subsequent generations. When dealing with as early a canonical work as the book of the prophet Zechariah, one is not hard put to find evidence for both. Zechariah's depiction of the Tabernacles festival is shared by Isaiah and possibly even by the final redactors of Leviticus. Moreover, once established as a text, Zechariah's ideas, despite recent disclaimers, find expression in Targumic literature, the New Testament and Judaism of Late Antiquity. Sommaire Il est rare, dans l'Antiquité, que les idées naissent dans un splendide isolement. Même quand c'est le cas, ces idées ne nous atteignent que parce qu'elles n'ont cessé d'influencer les générations suivantes. Il n'est pas difficile de prouver ces deux affirmations quand on étudie un livre canonique aussi récent que Zacharie. La description que fait le prophète Zacharie de la fête des Tentes rejoint celle d'Isaïe, voire celle des derniers rédacteurs du Lévitique. Ajoutons - quoi qu'en pensent des auteurs récents - que les idées de Zacharie, une fois le texte établi, retrouveront leur</page><page sequence="2">THE FORELIFE OF IDEAS AND THE AFTERLIFE OF TEXTS 521 expression dans la littérature targumique, le Nouveau Testament et le judaïsme de l'Antiquité tardive. In a thorough, state of the art essay 1 Jeffrey L. Rubenstein argues against Konrad R. Schaefer 2 and others 3 concerning the eschatological nature of the festival of Sukkot in Second Temple Times despite agreeing with Schaefer that such a link was made by the prophet Zechariah. For Rubenstein Zech. 14 is the first and only such Jewish link. Aside from Christian sources, Zech. 14 is the only Second Temple indication of such eschatological interpreta- tions of Sukkot and its motifs and symbols, which had otherwise "a thoroughly thisworldly focus" 4. This focus was on rain, fertility and God as master of this bounty through observance of the law. There is no doubt that Rubenstein is correct concerning the "this worldly" origins of the festival; however, he is not convincing concerning the almost total lack of eschatological connections of this holiday in Second Temple times. The festival of Sukkot had totally agrarian origins as a celebration of the harvest 5 (Ex. 23, 16. 34, 22), but is already divorced from such origins in the book of Leviticus (23, 43), in which the festival is connected to the redemptive act of the Exodus from Egypt. This connection accompanies the festival from the beginning of the Second Temple period onward, as is evident from the failure to mention the agricultural elements in Numbers (29, 12-39) and the formulation in the book of Ezra (3, 4) with its allusion to Numbers. In Ezra the festival is renewed at the second Exodus from Babylon in commemoration of the first Exodus from Egypt as written in the teachings of Moses. 1 Jeffrey L.

(8, 17). All that is required to make the redemptive festival eschatological is an ideology that sees the present or some future time as the end time. This clearly happens in Zech. (14, 1), but not only there. Elsewhere 6 I traced the text history of the expression "the joy of the place of drawing" (Mishnah Sukkah 5:5) (simhat beit ha-shoava) back to an analogous expression in Isa. 12, 3a, "and you will draw water with joy". The expression in Isaiah may provide the earliest evidence for the water libation ceremony at Sukkot; but even if it did not, the Second Temple water libation ceremony clearly connected itself to this verse, which saw the drawing of the water as symbolic of the drawing of the Holy Spirit from "the springs of salvation" (Isa. 12, 3b). That is, the verbal connection to Isaiah provides a redemptive link of this ceremony to the central symbol of the festival (see also Neh 8, 16). The entire chapter in Isaiah 12, 1-6 is eschatological. It is Isaiah 12:3 in symbolic discourse which is alluded to by Jesus in John 7. Hence the redemptive powers of the waters drawn in the course of nature had been transferred to the redemptive powers of the Holy Spirit for the eschatologically thirsty. That the redemptive idea was available to the returning exiles in the central temple festival is not only clearly established textually, it also makes good sense. The exiles' own experience provided these feelings, and their own time must have been understood, by some at least, as the eschaton itself. This is quite clear in Zechariah, Malachi and Haggai, as well as Nehemiah 9-10. Small wonder that it is this very topos of redemption that is again referred to in connection with Sukkot, at the Hasmonean victory related in the opening of 2 Macc. (1, 18-36), with its specific reference to Nehemiah. That is, the third redemption, of the Hasmoneans, is referred back to the second redemption, which in turn refers back to the first 7. Their time too must have been experienced as the ultimate redemptive moment, the eschaton itself8. 6 See H. Fox, "The Joy of the Place of Drawing" Tarbiz 55 (1986), 173-216 esp. pp. 198, 203-207. There I further relate Isa. 12 to themes and verbal tallies in Hallei Psalms 114-118. 7 See Rubenstein p. 189 who refers to 2 Macc. 10:5-8 but hardly mentions the more charged reference in the first chapter (Rubenstein p. 166 n. 18). 8 See Fox, "The Joy...". Appendix 4 pp. 213-216 where this notion is discussed in reference to the Hasmonean victory which was celebrated as the festival of fight and</page><page sequence="4">THE FORELIFE OF IDEAS AND THE AFTERLIFE OF TEXTS 523 The constancy of this theme of the joyous celebrations of this redemptive experience allowed even as unreliable a source as that quoted by Plutarch 9 to be impressed with a revelry that required no sleep, when great light by fire was brought to the darkness of night, spent in song and dance. Evidence for this joy is provided not only in the much maligned reliability of rabbinic sources such as Mishnah Sukkah 5, 1-4, Tosephta Sukkah Chapter 4, but also by Plutarch, as mentioned above, and by Philo (in Flaccus 122) 10. Moreover Philo emphasizes precisely the same Bacchic comparison in his description of song and dance among the Therapeutae in an all night festival (not specified) "as if it were a Bacchic rite" (On the Contemplative Life , 83-88). The revelry also is ultimately hinted at in the name of the holiday, hehag , "the holiday", but quite literally, "the circumambulatory dancing" n. These sources demonstr- ate that Plutarch proves more reliable than Rubenstein would have it 12. More than the psychology of religious behaviour, or verbal tallies, attest to the Second Temple origins of the redemptive and eschatol- ogical ideas of the festival of Sukkot as the template for such texts as Zechariah and possibly Isaiah. These texts also have afterlives. Not only were they influenced by sources and their own contempo- rary times, but were also eventually canonized in the form of their books as holy writ probably by the Hasmonean Period (2 Macc . 2, 13-14, Sirach prologue to Greek translation) and certainly by the end of the Second Temple (Mishnah Yadaim 3, 5). This means that if the eschatological link to Sukkot and its festivals had for whatever reason not yet been made by the time of Zechariah or Isaiah, it surely was available as an idea in the important canonical (re)new(ed) dedication of the Temple. I claim that this notion was also committed to liturgical expression in the prayer of the eighteen benedictions. 9 See Rubenstein p. 171 nn. 46-47. 10 See Fox, 'The Joy..." p. 206 n. 206. Rubenstein only mentions the source en passant (p. 106 n. 20). 11 See Rubenstein p. 187 n. 115 who cites the relevant sources but fails to understand the literal semantic significance. 12 Cf. Rubenstein p. 172 n. 48. Plutarch specifically mentions "a festival that is a sort of 'Procession of Branches' or Thyrsus Procession' in which they enter the temple each carrying a thyrsus. What they do after entering we do not know, but it is probable that the rite is a Bacchic revelry..." What Plutarch defines is the preliminary to the hag and this is precisely what rabbinic sources continue to describe in detail, including the efforts made to keep men and women apart during the revelries in the outer court of the Temple.</page><page sequence="5">524 HARRY FOX works of the Jews from then onward. Even if the work of these prophets were not immediately and universally siezed upon as holy, they were surely preserved by groups influential enough in Second Temple times to eventually have them canonized. To such groups, the eschatological ideas of Zechariah (and Isaiah) were not only available, they must have been important enough for them to continue to preserve these writings. For example, the reading from the prophets (see Mishnah Megillah Chapter 4) which accompanies the first day of the scriptural readings for the festival of Sukkot is in fact from Zechariah 14. Public readings of scripture are, of course, known from as early as the end of the First Temple period and they continued in the Second Temple period and beyond. Therefore not only is there necessary evidence for these ideas in Second Temple times related to Sukkot, but the ideas are established as sufficient to influence its symbols everafter. Small wonder, then, that if the central motifs of pilgrimage and water libation already had redemptive and eschatological importance in Second Temple times, we find other central symbols of the holiday juxtaposed to such themes - in the coins of the great revolt and of the later Bar Cochba rebellion, or even later as decorations for synagogue mosaics depicting the façade of the destroyed Temple 13. The redemptive theme of the sukkot (booths) themselves, as reflection of the clouds of glory, is not only available in early tannatic sources dating to the early Second Century but is probably a motif already used by Isaiah 4, 5-6: "The Lord will create over the whole shrine and meeting place of Mount Zion cloud by day and smoke with a glow of flaming fire by night. Indeed over all the glory shall hang a canopy, which shall serve as a pavilion [Hebrew Sukkah ] for shade from heat by day and as a shelter for protection against drenching rain" 14. And if one is still reluctant 13 Rubenstein discusses all of these separately as if there is no common theme uniting the symbols. Hence he is unable to see matrices of motifs of symbolic significance, topoU created by repetition. The importance of the location, currency and visibility of the symbols is obvious. They serve às constant reminders of the unfolding of events in highly charged time fraught with danger and anticipation. They are thus far removed from frivolous decorations, even if used as such by some on different occasions. To argue as Rubenstein (p. 179) does that in these contexts we have nothing more than "general symbols of nature and fertility" still fails to address why this and not that. One can readily think of dozens of better candidates for symbols of nature and fertility than the imported non-native citron. 14 See J. L. Rubenstein, "The Symbolism of the Sukkah", Judaism (Fall, 1994), p. 373 n. 8. Rubenstein sees "clouds of glory" as essentially an image of rabbinic</page><page sequence="6">THE FORELIFE OF IDEAS AND THE AFTERLIFE OF TEXTS 525 to see the Sukkot connections in Isaiah as explicit, this was not the case for his translators. The Targum is yet more explicit, adding matlat ananei ("clouds") to the Hebrew sukkah. This comes after the addition in the previous verse of yeqar (glory) to the word "clouds", connecting this to the shekhinah. Given such a semantic field it would seem appropriate to interpret the "drenching rain" as connected to the eschatological rain of Zechariah 14, enhancing this motif with Sukkot and its water symbolism. The antiquity of the notion of the clouds of glory as connected to the Sukkah motif can be seen from its text history in the Targumic traditions. The Septuagint, Samaritan Targum and the Peshitta all translate Lev. 23, 43 literally. Targum Onkelos however, translates "in booths" as "booths of clouds". This is expanded in Targum ps. Jon. as "booths of clouds of glory" and further expanded by Targum Neophiti as "in clouds of glory my divine presence in the form of booths". The relative dating of the various Targumic traditions can be ascertained from an analysis of these Targumic expansions 15. To show that an idea does not exist, Rubenstein has rigorously checked all the points relating to Sukkot for Second Temple times, studying each point in splendid isolation from all other points and dismissing each in turn as unrelated to redemptive and eschatological ideas, with the singular exception of Zechariah 14 16. Needless to say the method has proven very risky. Rubenstein did not examine all the points possible - a task beyond human scholarship 17. For example, he did not relate to the redemptive theme in Leviticus followed through in later Second Temple scripture. Nor did he attend to Isaiah and its verbal inspiration (or reflection) of the central theme of the Sukkot festival, nor to the particular revelry of the festival itself. This in itself should not surprise us as no scholar can think of everything. More significant and difficult is that he did not imagine Zechariah as part of a Zeitgeist emerging from ideas shared by others (eg. Isaiah), with an afterlife of influence which reaches down to our own days. literature, see p. 385 n. 23. As I see the clouds as connected to the sacrificial smoke and the incense offering, the image is surely earlier. 15 See H. Fox, "As if with a finger : The text history of an expression avoiding anthropomorphism", Tarbiz 49 (1980), pp. 283-284 for a similar example dating the various targumic expansions. 16 Cf. Tosefta Sukkah Chapter 3 where the eschatological rain of Zechariah 14 is connected to the river that is to flow from the temple in Ezekiel 47. 17 Cf. Mark 14, 62 and Matthew 26, 64 for the significance of Clouds of Heaven as eschatological signs in Second Temple times.</page></plain_text>
