This review consists of an ethnographic analysis of the principal com ponents of environmental discourses as well as a discussion of the approaches employed to analyze them. These include linguistic dis courses (ecolinguistics, ecocritical linguistics, discourse analysis) as well as approaches developed within other disciplines (anthropology, literary studies, philosophy, and psychology). Over the years, the structural properties of environmental dis courses have developed into a distinct discourse category. It remains unclear to what extent the numerous environmental discourses and metadiscourses significandy contribute to improving the health of the natural environment. 451</page><page sequence="2">Environmental discourse: the linguistic devices articulating arguments about the relationship between humans and their environment. INTRODUCTION Discourses about the contemporary environ ment, and the economic and political pro cesses that impact upon it, are by no means of concern solely to environmental anthropolo gists. Such is the reach and depth of disquiet and anxiety about the environmental future in both Northern and Southern hemispheres; it seems unlikely that the concerns of local and regional populations will not surface, at some point or other, during most anthropologists' periods in the field. At the same time, such is the linguistic complexity of environmen tal discourses that the need to marry anthro pological perspectives with those prominent in other disciplines appears distinctly press ing. In recent years, we have spent consider able time as a linguist-anthropologist tag team unpacking the natural discourses with which people make sense of a unique island envi ronment off the east coast of Australia. Con vinced of the merits of pooling the strengths of our disciplines and taking the ethnogra phy of speaking in new directions, we have more recently turned our attention to the competing and contentious discourses fo cused on environmental crisis at the global level. Our main problem is the sheer quantity of environmental discourses, which has vastly increased in recent decades in response to worldwide awareness of the global environ mental crisis, and which is produced from numerous disciplinary and linguistic back grounds. Anthropology, linguistics, philos ophy, sociology, and other disciplines now address the question of how environmental discourses work. A blurring of disciplinary boundaries is paralleled by a blurring between discourse and metadiscourse. In our terms, discourse refers to specific ways of talking about particular environments and their fu tures. Metadiscourse refers to practices of the orizing, which categorize issues to establish their significance. DEFINITIONS We define environmental discourse as com prising the linguistic devices articulating ar guments about the relationship between hu mans and the natural environment, but we restrict the definition further. Language has always been used to explore this relationship. But until recently most discourse took place in the belief that a largely self-regulating nature could be taken for granted. The new discourse differs in that its principal focus is the endan germent of nature and the human species in a global context. The ambiguity of the terms environment and nature is central to understanding this global discourse. Environment in essence is an anthropocentric notion: "The term has in creasingly come to mean a nature tangibly important only to human health and liveli hood" (Hochman 1997, p. 82). Rowe (1989, p. 123) and Fill (1993) criticize the vagueness of the term, and Howard includes it among his "weasel words" (1978, pp. 81-84). As exam ples, he cites U.S. game parks, where "visitors can see bears not, as we used to say in our old fashioned way, in natural surroundings, but in the environmental habitat," and aerosol cans, which "kill most household germs on 'envi ronmental' surfaces." Williams (1983) calls nature "perhaps the most complex word in the language"; its meaning is far removed from the technical notion of "entities and processes uninterfered with by human agency" (p. 219). In a study of "naturalness" as it is applied to Australian ecosystems, Taylor (1990) concludes that "failure to recognize that naturalness is a cul turally constructed concept, rather than a uni versal one, has produced... inconsistency and ambiguity in the terminology used for these assessments" (p. 411). Jagtenberg (1994) says "we are confronting both ecological decline and an explosion of discourses about nature" (p. 14). However, this explosion is evidence not for some direct 4$8 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="3">influence of environmental factors on lan guage, but rather for the emergence of risk society (Beck 1992) and technologies such as nuclear power, which no insurance companies dare touch. We interpret environmental dis course as an attempt by risk society members to make sense of the global changes that af fect them (Spaargen et al. 2000). Another task is to explore how the study of environmental discourse can make contributions to environ mental understanding. Our key questions are as follows: Are there any salient properties of envi ronmental discourse? Which linguistic approaches are most suited to analyzing them? What contribution can the previous points make to environmental sustain ability? CLASSIFICATION To reduce the polyphony of environmen tal voices to the common denominator of "political discourse" (Leuthold 1999, p. 5) seems too simplistic. Harr? et al. (1999) dis tinguish between scientific, moral, economic, and aesthetic macro discourse. Clear distinc tions exist between such micro discourses as green economic policies (Gerbig 2000), green consumerism (Elkington et al. 1988), and green advertising (M?hlh?usler 1996, Luke 1997). Herndl &amp; Brown (1996) sep arate pretheoretical classifications into eth nocentric, ecocentric, and anthropocentric discourse. Dryzek (1997) adds a political discourse with four subcategories: problem solving, survivalism, sustainability, and green radicalism. Such pretheoretical taxonomies are indica tive of a nascent field of inquiry. We ap proach the salient features of environmental discourse in terms of an ethnography of speak ing (Hymes 1972) such that the ethnography of communication lends itself to organizing large bodies of observation; the result is eric rather than emic, and therefore facilitates comparative study; the main level of analysis has been the event, a unit well provided for by the ethnography of communication; and an ethnographic approach highlights areas that have received insufficient attention. SPEECH COMPONENTS IN DISCOURSE ABOUT ENVIRONMENTAL EVENTS Participants Hymes observes (1972), "[T]he common dyadic model of speaker-hearer specifies sometimes too many, sometimes too few, sometimes the wrong participants" (p. 59) and advocates a distinction between addresser, sender, hearer, and addressee. These distinc tions are relevant to understanding global en vironmental discourses. The addresser. Addressers are the source of a message, and a number of analysts have shown that speaking on behalf of the Earth ("vicarious advocacy" in Harr? et al. 1999, p. 182) is a salient feature of environmen tal discourses. It entails assigning intelligence "to nonhuman entities such as ecosystems" (Dryzek 1997, p. 17) or a personified god dess such as Gaia (Lovelock 1979). Earlier black and white categorization between two addresser groups, environmentalists and de velopers, persists in more recent discourses, but others (Killingsworth &amp; Palmer 1992) of fer more complex classifications. Addressers have been classified in terms of their key metaphors (Dryzek 1997) or dom inant behaviors: ecofreaks, tree-huggers, fer ais, greenies, NIMBY (not in my backyard), and NIABY (not in anybody's backyard) (see M?hlh?usler 2003). Dryzek (1997) empha sizes the discourses of principal "agents" such as survivalists, prometheans, democratic prag matista, and green rationals, whereas Jamison www.annualreviews.org Environmental Discourses 459</page><page sequence="4">(2001) distinguishes activists, academics, and practitioners. Increasing the number of addressers would seem timely; environmental discourses are no longer dominated by a small coterie of West ern professionals. But addressers have also changed over time from concerned individu als (Carson 1962, Ehrlich 1969) to national and international organizations. Collective addressers fall into two main categories: those concerned with management and govern ment, and those focused on moral and aes -* thetic aspects of the environment. Big business has succeeded in repackaging its ideology by promoting green consumerism (Alexander 2002, Doyle 1991, Beder 1997, Gerbig 2000, Stauber &amp; Rampton 1995). This is often green tokenism, but the actions of ethical enterprises differ markedly from traditional big business. Governments have become the most powerful producers of environmental messages. Transnational bodies such as the European Union, World Bank, and UNESCO increasingly broadcast environmental messages. Alongside powerful organizations such as Greenpeace, World Wildlife Fund, and the Sierra Club, we find concerned groups of scientists, the Club of Rome (Meadows et al. 1972), and green political parties. The idea that there is a genuine global dis course remains problematic. Jamison (2001) comments that in the 1970s such a discourse appeared to "transcend the ideological dis putes and other sources of division, like class, race, gender, and national identity" (p. 1) but comes to the conclusion that national identity defines discourse communities. The notion of global discourse also sits uneasily with incom patible value systems in intercultural settings. Jones (1994) details the incommensurability of Maori and Pakeha languages in environ mental debates. Marnham (1981) observes, "African opinion would be hostile to every assumption" upon which an expatriate no tion of "game parks" is based (p. 8). "Wilder ness" is particularly problematic, as Burnett &amp; Kamuyu wa Kang'ethe (1994) have illustrated for east African languages. Richards (1992) highlights the problems with "wildlife con servation" (p. 1) in Sierra Leone. Genske &amp; Hess-L?ttich (2002) underscore intercultural eco-semiotic problems between developing and developed nations; similar conclusions can be found in M?hlh?usler (2003). Rhetor ical claims about globalization have resulted in a hyperbolic emphasis on integration and interdependence, which undervalues the per sistence of national and local forces. Speaker. The mainstreaming of environ mentalism has resulted in a disjunction be tween the roles of addresser and speaker. The media are important speakers, and their role has attracted considerable attention (Dyer &amp; Dyer 1990, Gerbig2000, Hansen 1996, Rissel &amp; Douglas 1993). A survey of the media's role in sustaining environmental discourse is given in M?hlh?usler (2003). Speakers who represent large organiza tions can be found on all sides of the environ mental debate. CEOs and professional envi ronmental communicators, speakers for large corporations, spokespersons representing or ganizations such as Greenpeace, and green politicians increasingly speak with the voice of their party rather than as individuals. Hearer. Hymes (1972) subscribes to a mech anistic metaphor of messages being sent and received that equates hearers and addressees with passive recipients. In reality, environ mental meanings emerge in active or inter active discourses between all players. We do not develop this criticism but note that a mechanistic view of communication is shared by numerous producers of environmental messages. One design feature of human language is that it is broadcast and that an uttered mes sage can be heard by all and sundry. In the West, environmental discourses are heard all the time as the media untiringly churn out stories about environmental disasters. 460 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="5">The concept of risk society implies a lack of certainty on all sides (Caplan 2000). Hearers are exposed to messages they do not completely understand even when "ecoliter ate" and numerous conflicting messages are encountered. This concept suggests a classi fication of hearers into those who are eco literate or earthliterate (Verhagen 2000) and those who ignore or filter out messages, or suffer from ecofatigue. Corporate discourses about the environ ment are capable of manipulating even the ecoliterate. Ehrlich &amp; Ehrlich (1996) have drawn attention to the practice of brown lash, which minimizes the severity of environ mental problems; Brosius (1999) explains how greenwashing by public relations firms man ufactures "uncertainty about environmental threats" (p. 28). The ability of hearers to filter out infor mation depends on whether they are directly affected by environmental issues. Farrell &amp; Goodnight (1998) observe that during dis asters a rhetorical crisis occurs where "audi ences struggle to understand information, set criteria for policy evaluation, and locate vi able options for action.... [T]he crisis does not so much invite discourse as defy it" (p. 76). In the wake of Three Mile Island, peo ple simply fled. In other disaster situations such as Bhopal (Fortun 2001) or Exxon Valdez (Browning &amp; Shetler 1992), hearers' reactions were influenced by patchy understanding and an inability to act rationally in the face of con flicting messages. Addressee. Addressees are members of tar get audiences. Given the economic and ideo logical importance of green discourse, identi fying target audiences is a central task of en vironmental rhetoric. Environmentalists tend to assume their message alone will appeal to the commonsense of those waiting to be en lightened. But their lack of attention to the question of how to target particular audi ences has rendered them less effective than expected. Penman (1994) has drawn attention to their failure to acknowledge limited envi ronmental awareness. Businesses and politicians have adopted more sophisticated strategies. Public opinion surveys (Luke 1993, pp. 165-66) increasingly shape the agenda of corporations and politi cal parties, and the appeal of environmental messages has become important in election eering and market research on green con sumer behavior (Elkington et al. 1988, Lenz 2003, M?hlh?usler 2000). Limited consumer interest slows down the production of envi ronmentally friendly vehicles and green tele vision programs. Ends The gap between goals and outcomes is par ticularly noticeable in the area of environ mental policy-making, in which policies are a substitute for, rather than a means of, achiev ing desired outcomes (Schiewer 2002, Strang 2004). Goals/Purpose. Much environmental dis course elaborates the theme that human ac tions are detrimental to the survival of hu manity. Each speech act warns that it is in the interest of the individual to desist from such activities. Waddell (1998) argues that the ultimate purpose is "the preservation of fu ture choice" (p. xiii). Changes in individual behavior or government policy range from single topic (do not chop down more trees in the parkland) to generalist ones (save the planet/world). "Proper conduct of the relation between society and nature" (Rutherford 1994, p. 40) has grown in importance, and it is to be achieved by government control and manipu lation of environmental awareness. Neuwirth (2002) details the rhetorical strategies used by the Austrian government and the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in support of nuclear power and in downplaying the risk of launching plutonium-laden spacecraft. Schultz (2001) analyzes the linguistic devices www.annualreviews.org Environmental Discourses 461</page><page sequence="6">(euphemism, vagueness, hyperbole) em ployed by big government and large corpo rations to control public opinion. One important discourse goal is to locate the speaker on the high moral ground, for example, in promoting vegetarianism (Marko 2000): Tb what extent vegetarianism is any better for animals than animal husbandry re mains unclear, and it goes hand in hand with habitat destruction, use of pesticides, and high storage costs. Harr? et al. (1999) have used narratology to explore the general principles of taking the moral high ground: The narra tives of opposing groups (e.g., supporters and opponents of nuclear energy) are structurally identical; the only difference lies in the roles assigned (hero, helper, innocent bystander). In spite of widely held views on the cen trality of discourse in constructing reality, discourse often seems to postpone action. Talk about the plight of the River Murray in Australia, for instance, is not matched by comparable action; as we are running out of water, we are also running out of time. Adam (1997) comments on the difficulties humans experience when calibrating time. Environ mental consequences of human actions can occur with a time lag varying between mil liseconds and millennia. Humans typically perceive consequences that occur a few hours, at most a few years, after the event. Outcomes. Bruner &amp; Oelschlaeger (1994) emphasize the relative lack of consequen tial change in environmental discourses com pared with those of antienvironmentalists who "have been effective in accomplishing their objectives at least in part, because of their abil ity to articulate persuasive rationales through slogans, myths and narratives" (p. xviii). This contrast in degree of linguistic adaptation was anticipated by earlier writers who commented on the way environmental rhetoric leaves a re ality gap "because it uses old language to de rive the terms of a new condition" (Segal 1991, p. 3). Continued exposure to more alarm ing facts about topics such as global warm ing does not lead to enhanced alertness but rather to "an atmosphere of fading interest" (Killingsworth &amp; Palmer 1992, p. 270). The new discourse about the environment comprises the greening of the language of in dustrial societies, the proliferation of new lex ical resources, the emergence of green word formation, and green metaphors becoming root cultural ones. Green language height ens peoples' awareness of environmental is sues. As Hajer (1995) notes, "the discursive power of ecological modernization manifests itself in the degree to which its implicit future scenarios permeate through society and ac tors reconceptualize their interests and recog nize new opportunities and new trouble spots" (p. 261). Act Sequences In Hymes's (1972) model, act sequences are concerned with the form messages conven tionally take as well as their semantic content. The model separates formal from semantic properties, a separation difficult to uphold in discourse analysis. We nevertheless try to sep arate form and content, noting first that the intensity of environmental discourses is char acterized by peaks (Rio, Kyoto) and troughs. Ecolinguists argue that the contours of Western languages are increasingly at odds with the contours of their speakers' environ ments. According to Halliday (2001), modern Western languages are the outcome of past developments and their grammars are memo ries of past experience: Their layers reflect our past as hunter gatherers through to modern bureaucratic modes of existence. This mem ory of the past influences how we perceive the world today, although what seemed functional in the past is now no longer so. The notion that bigger is better (in English we typically find conjuncts where bigger comes first, as in "all creatures great and small") is deeply en trenched in most languages, but in the current crisis such "growthism" is dysfunctional. Forms of speech. The greening of mod ern languages manifests in the changing 462 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="7">Biocultural diversity: implies that the well-being of languages is a prerequisite for the well-being of natural species norms for using lexical items. Lexical innova tions in English combine deliberate creation of terminology with spontaneously evolv ing terms. There has been a proliferation of specialist dictionaries for environmen tal words (surveyed in M?hlh?usler 2003), which reveal substantial changes in everyday language. Formally, most new lexical items are (a) morphologically complex, (b) built predomi nantly from Latin and Greek roots, (c) of lim ited transparency, or (d) misleading. The fact that major Western languages have in excess of 100,000 words for environmental matters does not mean that many of them enter into everyday discourse. Where specialist commu nities have redefined popular words such as "trash," "garbage," or "rubbish," miscommu nication is frequently the result. Like other unpleasant phenomena, envi ronmental degradation has promoted the use of euphemisms which either replace existing terms?"to harvest" rather than "to hunt," "landfill" rather than "rubbish dump," "to cull" rather than "to kill"?or take the form of formalized collocation, as in "sustain able development" or "green business." The trends outlined in English are paralleled else where. Stork (1998) has documented the environmental lexicon of French, whereas Trampe (2001) takes on the German lexicon of agribusiness. Message content. Lanthier &amp; Olivier (1999) observed that "the environmentalist discourse originates in the environmental and human disasters provoked by technology" (p. 67). These origins can be traced back to debates about deforestation, drought, and water shortages following the economic and cultural conquest of the earth by European colonizers (Grove 1992). The impact of mining, overgrazing, and overuse of forests has been discussed by Weigl (2004). The fol lowing areas have been identified by Trampe (2001, p. 233): pollution and waste problems, habitat destruction, species extinction, and nuclear energy. New topics are constantly added, bearing out S apir 's (1912) observation as to the social dimension of all discourses about nature. In the discourses about animal extinction, a small number of charismatic species (whales, seals, wolves, tigers, koalas, pandas, and dingoes) prevail (Knight 2000), biologically equal or more important species (scavengers, dung beedes, weevils, or wasps) rarely feature, nor do equally endangered domestic subspecies (Penman 1994). Brosius (1999) discussed the criticism that Euro-American discourses often ignore the plight of inhabitants of developing nations and pointed out that "environmental dis courses are changing in response to critiques of elitism, to charges that they ignore social justice issues, to accusations that they are a form of neo-colonialism" (p. 282). The emer gence of discourses of biocultural diversity (Maffi 2001) illustrates this change. Tone or Key The key of a message on one hand is a product of choices made in the domains of language form, content, and channel; on the other hand it impacts on the norms of interpretation and interaction. Although the terms key and tone are used interchangeably, our preference is for the latter. Tone. Different macro discourses about the environment vary with respect to tone, al though most are distincdy serious. In Kahn's (2001) summary, "Scientific discourses about the environment have been criticized for their 'cold, dry-as-dust objectivity, their an tiseptic gaze on death and indignity, their consistent use of the passive voice to avoid the appearance of responsibility'" (p. 242). Killingsworth &amp; Palmer (1992) observe that the attempt by scientists to write in a neutral detached tone is undermined by "anthropo morphizing the effect of scientific language" and their use of a "ideological kind of lan guage for nonteleological concepts" (p. 114). Halliday &amp; Martin (1993) criticize scientific discourse similarly: It constructs a reality that www.annualreviews.org Environmental Discourses 463</page><page sequence="8">is "fixed and determinate, in which objects predominate and processes seem merely to define and classify them" (p. 20). However, this register gives scientific discourse its au thoritative tone. Whereas Myerson &amp; Rydin (1996) have drawn attention to the frequent use of irony in environmental discourse, others have characterized it as irrational and emo tional (Schiewer 2002) and as hysterical (Killingsworth &amp; Palmer 1992). Harr? et al. (1999) note that often "there is a coupling of terms such as 'global warming' and the 'rise of sea level' in disaster stories, such as the sce narios in which 'densely populated low-lying areas are flooded,' which in their view justi fies characterizing such discourses as 'apoca lyptic'" (p. 68). INSTRUMENTALITIES Environmental discourse involves both nu merous channels and numerous speech forms. With increasing global involvement by more participants, further greening of communica tion can be anticipated. A range of studies ad dresses the production of environmental mes sages, but these studies are not matched by a similar concern with perception. Channels/Media The emergence of environmental discourses coincides with the proliferation of new me dia and their globalization. A brief survey by M?hlh?usler (2003, Ch. 11) reveals that envi ronmental discourse is fully embedded in this global multimedia structure. One exception is Phillips, who illustrates (2000) how six couples try to cope discursively with the proliferation of ecological risks. He maintains, "People's sense of responsibility is limited by being constituted within dis course, which constructs political action be yond a limited amount of political consump tion as belonging to a separate realm to which they have access only via mass media" (pp. 171-207). Environmental discourse in the main stream and alternative press has received some attention. Dyer &amp; Young (1990) and Doyle &amp; Kellow (1995) provide accounts of the media treatment of environmental is sues in Australia, including coverage of a northern Australian World Heritage Site, the Daintree Forest. They explain (Doyle &amp; Kellow 1995) that once the researcher leaves the realm of major newspapers and en ters the arena of small rural ones, antien vironmental bias appears well-entrenched. All papers created and perpetuated stereo types; sympathetic portrayal of green is sues by the media became widespread only recently. In a critical review of Times special edi tion (2 February 1989) on "The Planet of the Year, Our Endangered Earth," Grossman (1989) comments on the language therein, which perpetuates the myth that the envi ronmental crisis is caused by the recklessness, carelessness, sloppy handling, and profligacy of individuals. It did not include the deliberate decisions of governments and corporations, nor that of criminal organizations, which con tinue to exacerbate the crisis. In the realm of television and video, the imperative of newsworthiness is even more pronounced. As Delli et al. (1994, p. 79) have pointed out, most environmen tal degradation, unlike much less frequent eco-catastrophe, is an ongoing and slowly changing process and is therefore low on the scale of newsworthiness. Specially nominated days provide the media with an opportunity to compress slow-moving events into a fast moving story. The green calendar is full of days focusing on particular issues or inviting particular actions, such as "Buy Nothing Day" or "Clean Up Australia Day." Public percep tions of major "crises" in American domestic life do little more than occasionally heighten public interest to alleviate boredom (Downs 1972, p. 89). The main problem with such media coverage is that it articulates the view that sufficient information is known about 464 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="9">environmental problems for successful ame liorative measures to be undertaken. Noth ing could be further from the truth, but the ideological impact is understandably substantial. One principled linguistic limitation of en vironmental media is that the subject matter is immensely complex and that most language is ill suited to expressing the connectivity be tween relevant factors. This kind of discrete linguistic restriction accounts for the radical simplification of environmental information by stereotyping, accumulating ill-digested information on the Internet, and portraying complex information in new ways. Jagtenberg &amp; McKie (1997) and McKie (2000) have developed the notion of media scape or media ecology to examine the complex feedback relations between messages and audiences. They note considerable differences between public and private media. Eco-advocacy texts emerge primarily from public television, whereas commercial networks generate few texts of that type. These divergences and discrepancies reflect the limited appeal of environmental reporting compared with light entertainment and bear out that television is not an effective medium of mass education (Vivanco 2002). McKie (2000) adds that the anthropocentric properties of human languages are reinforced by unconscious and deliberate selection. Forms of Speech The forms of speech component refers to the dialect, accent, and variety used in speech events, all of which have received little attention. Environmental discourses are predomi nantly in English and other major West ern languages. As environmental concerns are most prominent among the middle classes, standard varieties of the language are the norm. Such circumstances are com pounded by the fact that standard writ ten forms are used in print and electronic media. Protest movements attempt to em ploy nonstandard forms of speaking as a kind of antilanguage against the establish ment. The protest against the proposed nu clear power station at Whyl was voiced in Alamannic, the shared vernacular of Swiss, German, and French citizens affected by the development. Genre Environmental discourses employ traditional genres such as narrative, myth, and sermon and add new ones such as Environment Im pact Assessments. Rose (2004) states, "it may be that narrative is the method through which the reason of connectivity will find its most powerful voice" (p. 6). Killingsworth et al. (1992) share this "hope for a generally acces sible narrative, the story of how human action reconciles conflicting demands and the search for a good life" (p. 21). Narratives are employed because of their important role in creating sense, reducing complex phenomena to accessible texts, and maximizing on their rhetorical force. Harr? et al. (1999) focus on the first aspect, nar ratives as frameworks, "for our attempt to come to terms with the nature and conditions of our existence" (p. 20). This idea of nar rative includes folk tales, fairy stories, nov els, and insider autobiographies (Kelly 1984). Harr? et al. (1999) note the importance of the Bildungsroman, a novel reflecting the three German meanings of Bildung: "formation, education and creation" (p. 72): It is con cerned with the development of the protag onist's mind in the passage to maturity, for example, Lovelock's (1979) earnest biologist who realizes too late the consequences of his meddling with nature. Similar narratives are discussed by Bowerbank (1999). Cronon (1992) argues that narratives im pose a single vision of reality when the complexity of issues facilitates the produc tion of several possibilities. Harr? et al. (1999) show how the same formal narrato logical structures are used in constructing a range of stories about the environment. www.annualreviews.org Environmental Discourses 465</page><page sequence="10">NORMS Factors that militate against normative consensus in environ mental discourse include its novelty, its global nature, and the constant changes in issues, ideologies, and participants. Agreed norms take time to develop. One can observe the grad ual emergence of norms within regional and wider commu nities, but the presence of environmentalist and antienviron mentalist discourses limits emergence of shared norms. At the global level, there is little chance of norms developing from be low: Contact between participants is insufficient. National and regional norms (Hajer 1995) for different European countries remain because they take place in widely different languages that favor different perspectives on the environment. Bruner &amp; Oelschlager (1994) argue, "Anti environmentalists play to the established cul tural narrative that 'Man' is over nature, that nature is nothing more than an ecomachine which we technologically manipulate, and that a good society is one which totally fulfils itself through market preferences" (p. 383). Nature writing is another established genre that continues to inspire environmen tal discourse. This genre precedes all oth ers, although, as Raglan (1991) observes, en vironmental thought is underrepresented in the Western canon, despite writers such as Thoreau, Rousseau, or the German Roman tics having been influential. Early nature writ ers are nevertheless attacked as dangerous sentimentalists by others (Weissman 1996). We note that their modern equivalents have become semantically bleached and trivialized when Suzuki's or Attenborough's television series become items of popular culture. Environmental history has emerged as an important genre over recent years, ranging from large-scale surveys such as Crosby's (1986) account of the biological consequences of European colonization, through to more focused accounts of the histories of commodi ties such as sugar, coffee, cod, or the history of landscapes (Worster 1990, Cronon 1996). Although normative expectations can be imposed by those who define the global agenda, such as the Western educated and elite organizers of the 1992 Earth Summit (Harr? et al. 1999, pp. 12-17), when a global message was whisked around the world from Rio (Conca &amp; Dabelko 1998) and comprised "a fusion of local discourses into one media event" (Harr? et al. 1999), no genuine norms resulted: "[A]s yet, it is far from the expression of a unified voice" (p. 20). Norms of Interaction The validity of environmental discourses de pends on their accreditation as defined by as sumptions about commonsense and shared metaphors. As Carbaugh (1992) has illus trated, outsiders have difficulty in making their voice heard. Western experts pronounc ing on environmental matters in the develop ing world are at times accused of being neo imperialists and eco-missionaries (Agarwal &amp; Narain 1991). For their part, Western ex perts frequendy ignore the proposition that scientific knowledge can be culture bound and provincial. Interaction on environmental matters is characteristically defined by two opposing models of communication. The model used in scientific, economic, and political discourse is the conduit metaphor (Reddy 1979) of mes sages generated by experts being passed on to the unenlightened. But the assumption of pas sive hearers is an inadequate view of commu nication and yields undesirable consequences. Environmentalists also subscribe to this model, but there are some within their ranks who instead aim to generate genuine col laboration and recognize that input never equals intake in human communication. In such models, knowledge-flow from the de veloping to the developed world is called for (Peet&amp; Watts 1996). Norms of Inteqiretation The title of Taylor &amp; Buttel's (1992) paper "How Do We Know that We Have Global Environmental Problems?" suggests that the 466 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="11">Greenspeaking: replacing or postponing environmental action by just speaking about it in "green" language Ecolinguistics: a branch of linguistics that integrates the study of language with its cultural and natural environment central problem is one of making sense of complex, conflicting information. One key problem again is accreditation, that is "on relations obtaining between what is said or written and the circumstances in which it is being produced and/or interpreted" (Harris 2001, p. 154). Alexander (2000) writes, "Part of the problem of changing people's behavior regarding environmental and ecological issues is appreciating that differing social, economic and political forces employ language and dis course in persuasive terms in different ways" (p. 186). One reason for the lack of common inter pretive norms is the different time perspec tives of different communities (Harr? et al. 1999). The proportion of the world's pop ulation who do not think ahead for more than a few days at a time is large and grow ing, whereas those who understand the conse quences of events in the distant future remain a small minority. As Posner (1990) summa rizes, "Given that this generation has created technologies and technological problems that will be around for very long periods of time (e.g., nuclear waste, genetically engineered species), what will be the code, message and medium necessary to alert future generations to potential dangers?" (pp. 7-8). The norms governing environmental dis course again draw heavily on those emanating from powerful institutions in society. Thus, the view in the West that one can trust sci entists more than politicians also holds for green discourses and is one of the princi pal reasons why "greenspeaking" draws ex tensively on scientific language. The green ing of business and the emergence of green consumers pose additional problems of inter pretation. Almost all products offered for sale now have environmental claims attached to them, which makes informed decision making increasingly difficult. Interpretation is hugely problematic when it comes to complex dis asters such as Three Mile Island, Chernobyl, or Bhopal. Farrell &amp; Goodnight (1998) de tail the insufficiency of official and private dis courses to make sense of them and conclude that "no one understood all that was going on" (p. 76). SURVEY: ANALYTICAL APPROACHES TO ENVIRONMENTAL DISCOURSES Environmental discourse concerns the rela tionship between language and the world. M?hlh?usler (2003, p. 2) highlights four dif ferent linguistic approaches to this relation ship: Language is for cognition: It exists in a social and environmental vacuum (Chomsky). Language is constructed by the world (Marr). The world is constructed by language (structuralism, poststructuralism). Language is interconnected with the world: It both constructs and is con structed by it (ecolinguistics). These approaches recognize that what one can know about the global environment is in extricably linked with language inasmuch as knowledge is dependent on effability. We be gin with language because one can use lan guage about all effable aspects of the world; but the converse is not the case. There is discourse about the environment, but no en vironment about discourse. The first per spective (Chomsky's independence hypothe sis) takes the position that language is a neutral tool or that all human languages (potentially or actually) have the same capacity for talking about the environment. But both Saussurian structuralists and Chomskyan generativists disconnect language from external influences. This disconnection has been labeled "limiting the arbitrary" by Joseph (2000), who offers an incisive critique of modern linguistics, as does the ecolinguist Finke (2002). The inability of modern linguists to address environmental discourses is com pounded by their largest unit of analysis being a single sentence. Moreover, the meaning of sentences has been established with reference www.annualreviews.org Environmental Discourses 46-]</page><page sequence="12">Ecology of language: the study of interactions between any given language and its cultural and political environment to internal sense relations, not external refer ents. The view that languages are constructed by the external physical or social world has not been popular in mainstream linguistics, but it continues to be argued in connection with language origins. Saussurian structuralism was in part a reac tion against a historical approach to language, which sought to explore how linguistic dif ferences could be explained in terms of dif ferent environmental factors. The marginal ization of onomatopoeia (Nuckolls 1999) and iconicity of signs further widened the gap be tween language and the world. When lan guage change was considered, its explanation remained restricted to internal factors such as system organization, reanalysis, or faulty transmission. External actors in language change were considered by the "ecology of language" ap proach pioneered by Haugen (1972), who fo cused on the deliberative man-made polit ical ecologies in which languages compete with one another. Haugen defined language ecology as "the study of interactions between any given language and its environment" (p. 336), but he restricted this to the cultural and political environment while also empha sizing the survival of the fittest. This some what skewed perspective was followed by sev eral European scholars (surveyed by Fill 2003 and M?hlh?usler 2003). Contemporary eco linguists have modified Haugen by emphasiz ing the cooperative principle in ecology and the value of linguistic diversity. More effective approaches emerged in other disciplines or in the still-marginalized critical linguistics (Fairclough 1992), integra tional linguistics (Harris 1981, Toolan 1996), and ecolinguistics (Fill 2003, M?hlh?usler 2003). Critical linguistics and critical dis course linguistics are based on the post structuralist notion that perceptions of the environment are discursively constructed. Ecolinguistics can be traced back to the 1980s when a group of linguists asked whether the looming environment crisis was due in part to language. Early writers such as Fill (1993) drew on the experience of language and gender studies because the linguistic den igration of women is, in many languages, ac companied by a denigration of nonhuman life forms (Leach 1968, Tansley 1991, Dunayer 2001). One issue that drew much attention was the development of a new lexicon for talking about environmental matters. M?hlh?usler (1983) in a review of Landy (1979) proposed that this new language is characterized by three problems: semantic vagueness: e.g., terms like pol lution, progress, and pest. semantic underdifferentation: e.g., growing, which can refer to natural growth, man-made growth, arithmetic growth, exponential growth, etc. misleading encoding: e.g., zero-growth (which fails to recognize what is be ing added), labor saving (which does not say whose labor is being saved), and fertilizers (which can render soil unproductive). M?hlh?usler (1983) detected a widespread unease among environmentalists who be came aware of their linguistic limitations. Alternative discourse approaches such as Johnson (1991) and Jung (1996) became avail able in due course, whereas an address by Halliday in 1990 (published 2001) brought the nonecological nature of many languages to the attention of applied linguists. His pro posal combined a detailed critique of lexical and grammatical categories of contemporary English in an attempt to correlate different types of grammar with different stages in cul tural and technological development. Empha sis was given to the role of nominalization, transitivity, and countability of nominal ex pressions in distorting the fit between the con tours of language and the contours of the en vironment (Martin 1986, Goatly 2001, Fill 2003). The Whorfian notion that lexicon and grammar of individual languages are the root causes of our environmental crisis is a 468 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="13">Ecocritical analysis: studies how the dynamics of social processes such as racism, sexism, or speciesism shape discourses and perceptions of ecological matters recurrent theme (surveyed by M?hlh?usler 1998). It has promoted the search for eco logically more adequate ways of speaking in non-Western cultures and has suggested ways in which an ecologically correct biocentric language can be developed. The first kind of suggestion, surveyed by Little (1999), ranges from romanticizing tribal languages consid ered to have privileged environmental insight to selectively mining them for traditional eco logical knowledge. That environmental language was a new area for language planning was suggested by Halliday in 1990; others have taken up the challenge. Stibbe (2004) surveys studies on environmental verbal hygiene and con cludes that tinkering with language is unlikely to produce "a consistent and effective over all discourse for expressing ecological issues" (p. 4). However, in view of widespread eco fatigue, a robust discourse about speciesism, growthism, and other linguistic shortcom ings could drive the wider adoption of envi ronmental discourse. An examination of how different meanings of "sustainable develop ment" prevent intelligent discourse about the subject (Alexander 2000, Redclift 1987) cer tainly seems worthwhile, likewise with the ter minology applied to charismatic species (Lee 1988, Peace 2005). Two principal resources for ecocritical analysis are rhetorical studies and critical anal ysis. Several publications deal with rhetoric (Killingsworth &amp; Palmer 1992; Herndl &amp; Brown 1996; Muir &amp; Veenendall 1996; Myerson &amp; Rydin 1996; Waddell 1998; Harr? et al. 1999). Waddell (1998) has argued that environmental discourse must be cognitively plausible, evoke sentiment, and relate to most people. He implies the rhetorical study of current discourse rarely meets these criteria. Segal (1991) argues that "all arguments rep resent themselves as arguments for environ mental protection. The absence of a clearly identifiable opposition means we encounter gestures in support for the environment, even from those who would despoil it" (p. 2). The result is a blurring of boundaries and the appropriation of "ecospeak" (Killingsworth &amp; Palmer 1992) and "greenspeak" (Harr? et al. 1999) by antienvironmentalists. The new rhetoric is one of appropriation and manipu lation by big business and government. "We perceive, in the increasing greening of English and other Western languages, a kind of lin guistic Ersatzhandlung, with the very real dan ger of talk replacing or postponing action" (Harr? et al. 1999, p. ix). A common focus in rhetorical studies is that environmental discourse involves a multi tude of voices, a "new hybrid discourse" (Rojas 2001, p. 8) involving a "Babel of discourse communities" (Killingsworth &amp; Palmer 1992, p. 21). METAPHOR STUDIES Given the limitations on environmental un derstanding, it comes as no surprise that scholars pay a great deal of attention to metaphor. Myerson &amp; Rydin (1996) and Harr? et al. (1999) devote a chapter to it. It is most commonly analyzed from the per spective of Lakoff &amp; Johnson (1980). Root metaphors are used either as convenient pa rameters for distinguishing different types of environmental discourses (Drysek 1997) or as targets for criticism. Bullis (1992) for exam ple attacks mechanistic metaphors as "having oudived their usefulness" (p. 347) and criti cizes metaphors such as eco-defense and eco warrior for constructing confrontation "as a means of achieving peace and harmony" (p. 352). The centrality of medical metaphors in the construction of environmental awareness has been emphasized by Stratford (1994) and Lanthier &amp; Olivier (1999). A concern for health is shared across a wide range of ideo logical positions. Metaphors of healing or pre ventive medicine are widely employed, but the main interest lies in showing how metaphors can fudge discursive differences. Mills (1982) identifies three core metaphors by which Western societies have lived for the past 1000 years: nature www.annualreviews.org Environmental Discourses 469</page><page sequence="14">as a book written by God (Middle Ages); nature as a reflection of the human body (Renaissance); and nature as a machine, first a clock, then a steam engine, and most recently a (bio)computer (the present). Ecofeminists have drawn attention to the root metaphor of rape (Schaffer 1988) in expressions such as "opening up virgin territory" or "penetrating the land." Two principal reasons for the proliferation of metaphor are the novelty of the subject matter, which brings into being new heuris tic possibilities, and the conflicting agendas of those who use environmental discourse. As Harris (2001) observes, "There is a fundamen tal division about the role of language, which can surface in all kinds of ways. At its sharpest, it emerges in where you draw the line between sense and nonsense_For some people, un doubtedly, the claim trees have rights is non sense, or at least utterly confused" (pp. 155 56). D?ring (2002, 2004) illustrates that the metaphors by which certain groups live are important factors in influencing people's en vironmental actions. The use of metaphor in greenwashing has been described by several analysts and surveyed by M?hlh?usler (2003, Ch. 10). Farrell &amp; Goodnight (1998) have looked at the use of metaphors in relation to Three Mile Island, and Liebert (2001) simi larly compares the emergence of the money equals-water metaphor in the construction of nineteenth-century public water systems. A recent trend looks at the total commod ification of nature. M?hlh?usler &amp; Peace's (2001) analysis of the language of eco tourism has highlighted the metaphorical tendency to anthropomorphize animals and to portray na ture as a battlefield where the nonhuman com batants are in a permanent struggle for sur vival. Marko (2002) observes that although the sexuality of whales and their rearing practices are talked about in zoological terms, discourse about their communicative and social abilities is couched in anthropomorphic metaphor (see also Peace 2005). That disassociation is em ployed when animals are exploited or hunted is a common theme, as in the case of baby seals versus seal pups (Martin 1986, Lee 1988). Waddell (1998) comments on synecdoche (the part stands for the whole), and this de serves more scrutiny, as charismatic creatures typically stand for "nature" while endangered species are talked about as "miners' canaries" (p. xvi). That metonymy (being next to makes something similar to) plays an important role in naturalizing nonnatural practices and products has been shown for environmental advertising (M?hlh?usler 1999). Character istically, such advertisements visually locate products or trademarks in unspoiled nature. CRITICAL DISCOURSE ANALYSIS (ECOCRITICISM) AND CULTURAL STUDIES What unites the varied contributions to eco criticism is the objective of creating awareness of the cultural roots of the environmental cri sis and the hope that such discourses will result in action. There is also an emphasis among ecocritics on connectivity, as Estok (2001) explains: "Ecocriticism at its best seeks un derstanding about the ways that dynamics of subjugation, persecution, and tyranny are mu tually reinforcing, the ways that racism, sex ism, homophobia, speciesism and so on are, to use Ania Loomba's term, interlocking" (p. 9). Ecological discourse has featured promi nently in green cultural studies with its em phasis on popular culture and the mechanisms that define common sense, as illustrated by a special issue of the Australian Journal of Com munication (1994). Contributions range from analysis of media stories (Lucas 1994) and films (McKie 1994) to governmental appro priation of environmental discourse. Other objects of analysis are listed on a resource site at Warbaugh State University (http://www. wsu.edu/~amerstu/ce/ce.html accessed 10 October 2004). One recurrent theme of green cultural studies is the limited efficacy of environ mental discourse and the call for more active involvement in the environment. 470 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="15">Penman (1994) shows how the discursive practices of environmentalists and farmers have enabled her to become a better farmer, an experience shared by Trampe (2001). THE BIOCULTURAL DIVERSITY APPROACH Concern for the loss of biodiversity can be traced back to Carson (1962), but it has only recendy become a topic of ecolinguistics. The equally dramatic disappearance of cultural and linguistic diversity is also a more recent focus for attention. That the two phenomena are causally connected was argued independendy by Harmon (1996), M?hlh?usler (1995), and Thompson (1994). M?hlh?usler (1995) ar gued that life in a particular human environ ment is dependent on people's ability to talk about it. Maffi's (2001) edited volume con tains several programmatic, empirical studies suggestive of interdependencies between lan guage knowledge and environmental manage ment. Given that 96% of languages are spoken by 4% of the world's population, almost three quarters of which are endangered or highly endangered, further acceleration of environ mental degradation is probable. The biocultural diversity approach con siders a wider range of parameters than is common to discourse analysis, but its find ings are tentative. One attempt to limit the range is M?hlh?usler 's (1996) study of young languages among small populations on small islands such as Norfolk Island and Pitcairn Is land. Preliminary findings suggest unnamed life forms have a considerably greater chance of becoming extinct than do named ones. The converging environmental and linguis tic crises and their causes have been examined by Harmon (2002). In the domain of language planning (e.g., Liddicoat &amp; Bryant 2000), arguments in favor of biocultural diversity have become main stream in a short period. The assimilationist and rationalist approach has recendy begun to give way to ecological language planning, which favors maximum linguistic diversity. The relations between linguistic diversity and biological diversity are now being discussed by major bodies such as UNESCO. May (2003) detailed the scepticism among those linguists and language planners who question the link and argued that speakers must be free to choose to abandon their language in favor of global culture. The concept of free choice is not problematized by these advocates. CONCLUSIONS When considering the relationship between discourse and the environment, one can start either at the linguistic end and explore how linguistic devices are employed in talking about the environment or at the environ mental end and ask to what extent languages are shaped by environmental correlates. Our choice was motivated by the fact that the bulk of the literature surveyed here starts at the language end. The first question of our survey concerned the salient properties of environmental dis courses. We noted there is a tendency to equate the notion of environment with what sustains hu man life and what pleases humans. Most discourses are anthropocentric. most discourses are focused on local concerns and issues covering no more than a human life span. there are discursive attempts to global ize environmental discourse, but this is a small part of the totality of possible ones. One further salient property is widespread uncertainty under conditions of risk society, which leads to a greater use of narratives and rhetoric than in many other discourse genres. As environmental discourses are con cerned with the everyday, so they are be coming institutionalized and bureaucratized, the more so as discourse analysis becomes part of environmental management programs being promulgated by big business or big government. www.annualreviews.org Environmental Discourses 4JI</page><page sequence="16">The most noticeable feature of green dis course is lexical choice. In addition to new descriptive expressions, many loaded terms are currently available for rhetorical purposes. Euphemisms, buzz words, weasel words, and emotive terms are prolific; their translation equivalents are beginning to spread, although European and American ones remain promi nent. One of the outcomes of the greening of linguistics is the emergence of a new ap plied linguistics, which, according to Halliday (2001), may not hold the key to solving envi ronmental problems. But it is assuredly im perative for us to write instructions for the use of the key. The emergence of environmental dis course in the 1980s coincided with the dis integration of a single paradigm of modern linguistics. Practitioners of new approaches to linguistics began to ask new questions and em ploy new analytic methods. The emergence of ecolinguistics was likely inevitable, as has been exploration of the interconnectedness of lan guage endangerment and biocultural diversity more recently. Our final question concerned the contri bution environmental discourses can make to environmental sustainability. We concur with Waddell (1998), who comments on the role of language in revitalizing the public at large and underlines the need to discover language "for both experts and generalists alike" (p. xv). Language may not be the key, and focusing on the nature of the linguistic code to produce an ecofriendly dialect is unlikely to prove suc cessful. Renaming the vulgar names for life forms in the English language of the eigh teenth century and replacing them with scien tific ones did little to improve Britain's natural environment (Thomas 1983). What is impor tant rather is to recognize the importance of multiple perspectives, dynamic dialects (Door &amp; Bang 1996), and the inevitability of change. This requires adopting Halliday's instructions to be critically aware of the instrument of lan guage and its uses. Green approaches to dis course can promote awareness that the lan guage one uses privileges certain perceptions and actions and that expressing matters differ endy will privilege others. The view that per fection is not in any single entity, but requires a diversity of expressions (Harmon 2002), is one of the central insights of ecological think ing and ecological approaches to language. SUMMARY POINTS 1. The study of environmental discourse requires a number of approaches. It is neces sarily an interdisciplinary exercise. 2. The study of environmental discourses is typically carried out by scholars who have agendas other than merely describing such discourses. As a consequence, there is a blurring between discourse and metadiscourse. 3. The vastness of the topic requires a descriptive framework that can accommodate a maximum number of properties of environmental discourses. An ethnography of communication approach was chosen for this reason. 4. The study of environmental discourses is a relatively recent phenomenon dating from the late 1980s. Most studies challenge the mainstream view of language as found in structuralist and generative linguistics. 4J2 M?hlh?usler Peace</page><page sequence="17">FUTURE ISSUES TO BE RESOLVED 1. It remains to be established how precisely and to what extent discursive practices impact on the natural environment. One particular problem is that human discourses selectively focus on only a small subset of environmental phenomena. 2. It is not clear to what extent the anthropocentrism of human languages can be over come by deliberate acts of language planning. 3. The efficacy of environmental discourse for resolving the global environmental crisis remains ill understood. LITERATURE CITED Adam B. 1997. Running out of time: global crisis and human engagement.
