<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOURCES OF THE GIDEON STORIES BY C. F. WHITLEY Bangor (Wales) It has long been recognised by Old Testament students that the book of Judges is a work of composite material. Up to about a generation ago it was usual for commentators to ascribe this material to definite literary sources and to claim, moreover, that such sources were the continuation of those found in the Pentateuch 1). Within recent years however there has been a considerable reaction to this approach to the book. With the exception of a few scholars such as EISSFELDT, PFEIFFER and HOLSCHER 2) there has been a tendency to reject the documentary source hypothesis and to regard the work as a compilation from traditions, or 'complexes' of traditions, of varying origins. Thus, commenting on the source analysis of Judges Aage BENTZEN wrote: '.. the hypothesis of a separation-not of "documents", but-of different strata of traditions, belonging to different "schools" of story tellers is not unjustified. But to take the step forward to attribute such strata to J and E .. I cannot find certain' 3). Similarly Martin NOTH refers to the 'Uberlieferungs- komplexe' which he claims formed the basis of the Deuteronomic edition of Judges and is also of the opinion that 'Aus der literarischen Analyse ergibt sich nicht das Durchlaufen einer gleichen Zahl von vordeuterononlistischen "Quellen"' 4). While however NOTH could speak of the 'literarischer Vorgeschichte' (ibid.) which he thinks is embodied in the complexes of tradition, representatives of the Traditions-geschichtliche Schule contend that the materials used by the Deuteronomist were in the nature of oral traditions rather than of literary compositions 5). 1) E.g., G.

F. WHITLEY We will here confine our remarks to the Gideon stories, and having noted briefly some of the more conflicting elements they exhibit will proceed to give some consideration to the question as to whether they derive from oral or written sources. Commentators who have subjected the text of these stories to a detailed analysis have drawn attention to the many inconsistencies and difficulties inherent in them 1). While various analyses have been made and reconstructions proposed it is clear that at least two different traditions relating to Gideon underlie the biblical material. One tradition of his call is embodied in vi 11-24. While threshing corn secretly in the winepress Gideon experiences a theophany in which he receives a commission from Yahweh to 'save Israel from the hand of Midian' (verse 14). Certain manifestations of the divine power follow (vs. 20-22) and after the vision Gideon builds an altar at Ophrah which he calls 'Yahweh Shalom'. Another account of Gideon's call appears in vi 25-32, 36-40. Here he is commanded to throw down his father's altar of Baal and to build an altar to the God of Israel, despite the statement in verse 24 that he has already done so. It is significant that verses 25-32 emphasize the destruction of the heathen altar and it is therefore probable that this account of Gideon's actions is to be connected with verses 7-10 which attribute Israel's afflictions to her associations with the gods of the Amorites. Again while vi 34 depicts Gideon as a local warrior of Abiezer who leads his clan in resisting Midianite invasions, vi 35 and vii 23 represent him as a national leader defying the enemy at the head of a number of Israelite tribes. It is also probable that it is against the background of Gideon's activity as a local hero that we are to interpret the anger of the Ephraimites on his initiative in engaging the enemy (viii 1-2). His slaughter of Zebah and Zalmunna is likewise but the culmination of a private feud with these chiefs (viii 18-20). Moreover, whatever historicity attaches to the story that on the eve of battle Gideon reduced his men to 300 (vii 2-7) it is clear that verses 16-22 represent a confusion of two traditions regarding the strategy employed in surprising and routing the invaders. Thus while verses 19-20 mention the use of trumpets, jars and torches against the enemy, verses 18 and 22 imply that trumpets alone were used. These considerations prompt us to ask whether such variants and 1) E.g., MOORE, op. cit., pp. 173-237; BURNEY, op. cit., pp. 176-266; H6LSCHER, op. cit., pp. 354-357. 158</page><page sequence="3">THE SOURCES OF THE GIDEON STORIES inconsistencies which characterise the Gideon stories derive from written documents or oral sources of tradition. Before attempting to suggest an answer to this question it will be helpful to note that the differing characteristics and presuppositions of these stories are expressive of the thought and outlook associated with definite sources recognisable elsewhere in the Old Testament and especially in the narratives of the Pentateuch. Thus in the narrative of Judges vi 11-24 which describes the theophany connected with Gideon's call Yahweh appears to him through his messenger ('xKt). Similarly it is through his messenger (j'xK) that Yahweh communicates with Hagar in Genesis xvi 7f., a passage assigned to the J document. In Judges vi 11 we read that 'the messengers of Yahweh came and sat under the oak which was in Oprah', while in Genesis xviii 1, another passage regarded as J, we are told that Yahweh appeared unto Abraham 'by the oaks of Mamre'. Again as Genesis xviii 6-8 (J) represents Abraham providing food which is eaten by Yahweh's messengers so in Judges vi 18-21 we read that the meal which Gideon prepares for his angelic visitor is consumed by fire. In Exodus xxxiii 20 (J) Yahweh is represented as saying, 'Man shall not see me and live', while for this reason Gideon laments that he has 'seen the messenger of Yahweh face to face' (Jud. vi 22). Such parallels as exist between Pentateuchal passages assigned to the J document and Judges vi 11-24 are not however confined to a simi- larity of theological concept. Definite phraseological parallels may also be discerned as the following extracts in Hebrew shew: (i) (Jud. vi 17) ... tfn K-K ... * '1,a In ,niKn -rn r¥K Ilnn (a) (Gen. xviii 3 = J) ... .ltn Kr-"K l' ya In n,xrs K3-=K ,'nTK '"lPi (b) (Ex. xxxiv 9 = J) .... 'tr . "r l 't In nK'r K3-K R "InN (c) It will be noticed that phrases almost identical with b and c also occur in Exodus xxxiii 12, 13, 17 which is regarded as J material 1). (ii) (Jud. vi 12) .... mn jR5r , 5R nK,I (a) (Ex. iii 2 = J) .... r'K r1n 1Rt? Kri (b) 1) The appearance of the phrase 'If I have found favour in the sight of ..' in Esther v 8 and vii 3 shews that it became to be used as a form of petition to a king in later times. 159</page><page sequence="4">C. F. WHITLEY It may of course be observed that Gen. xxii 11 is an example in which 'malak Yahweh' is used in an E context. In this verse however there is a significant theological difference in the use of the expression. The malak calls 'out of heaven' thus avoiding the anthropomorphism of J where he appears directly to men. In Judges vi 14, for example, the malak is Yahweh himself- 'And Yahweh turned towards him'. While the thought and phraseology characteristic of the J docu- ment in the Pentateuch may be discerned in Judges vi 11-24 other passages in the same chapter which seem to constitute a second account of Gideon's call reflect all the characteristics associated with what is known as the E document and outlook. Thus in verses 25-26 Gideon is ordered to break down the altar of Baal and the Asherah and then to build an altar to God. As we have seen, the antecedent of these verses is not to be found in verses 11-24 but rather in verses 7-10 where a prophet appears and rebukes the Israelites for their association with 'the gods of the Amorites'. This same hostility towards the Amorites as a Canaanite people is evident throughout Exodus xxiii 20-23 which, apart from a few minor additions, is commonly attributed to E 1). Of course NOTH and others regard Judges vi 7-10 as Deuteronomic 2). It is true that similarities in respect of vocabulary obtain between the latter part of verse 8 (rans-nr-r , nm wS, sw ,' rznn Sn¥sn7n 'im) and certain passages in Deuteronomy (e.g., Dt. vii 8, viii 14). The phrase is however equally reminiscent of Exodus xx 2 (T,nN;n i tt p'5; rn'; "3m Zna,T=1-n=r1 l='13~t yr t) which is regarded as an E passage. Mention of the deliverance from Egypt is also to be found in Joshua xxiv 6 (E) apart from references in Amos (iii 1), Hosea (xi 1, xii 9) and Micah (vi 4). While therefore it might be argued that the passage (Jud. vi 7-10) in its present form bears the impress of Deuteronomic editing it none the less represents the thought and echoes the phrase- ology of an earlier time 3). Moreover if this were originally a Deuteron- 1) Cf. OESTERLEY and ROBINSON, An Introd. to the Books of the Old Test. p. 37. Of course Amorite as a designation of the people whom the Israelites conquered also appears in Deuteronomy (e.g., i 20, 27). The term Canaanite is however also used (xi 30); and these terms also appear in conjunction with Hittite, Periiite and Hivite in other places in that book (e.g., vii 1; xx 17). It is doubtful therefore if Amorite has any special significance in Deuteronomy. Its appearance there is perhaps due to the terminological influence of E on D. Amos, a prophet who worked in the north, also appears to have used the term Amorite (ii 9). 2) See NOTH, op. cit., Seite 51. 3) D seems to refer to the tradition of the deliverance from Egypt chiefly 160</page><page sequence="5">THE SOURCES OF THE GIDEON STORIES omic passage the writer would scarcely forego the opportunity of developing a theme consistent with his own peculiar tenets. It rather appears that the compiler here abbreviated the contents of the prophetic address in favour of the account of Gideon's call which immediately follows. It has been suggested that verses 36-40 of chapter vi belong to the second account of Gideon's call. The fact however that the divine being is referred to throughout these verses as v;l"q indicates that they derive from an E source. It is very likely that the passage (Jud. viii 22-23) in which Gideon declines the kingship offered by the men of Israel is also of E proven- ance, although probably originally derived from a tradition which reflects the teaching of the northern prophet Hosea. It can scarcely be argued that Judges viii 23 is the work of the Deuteronomist, for this writer does not in principle condemn kingship. King Josiah is represented as implementing the regulations of Deuteronomy (2 Kgs xxiii 1-20) and is judged and praised accordingly (2 Kgs xxiii 25). Hezekiah is subjected to the same test and is similarly commended for obeying the 'commandments which Yahweh com- manded Moses' (2 Kgs xviii 6). On the other hand kings who were thought to have disregarded the presuppositions of Deuteronomy are judged unfavourably (e.g., 1 Kgs xii 25-33, xiv 16, 2 Kgs xxi 1-12). Again 1 Samuel xii 14-15, a passage which has obvious affinities with Deuteronomy (e.g., Dt. xxviii 15f.), states that if the Israelites and even 'the king that reigneth over them' would observe the command- ments of God they would merit His favour, but if they were to disobey His law both they and their king would suffer in consequence (cf. also 1 Sam. xii 24-25). The Deuteronomist does not therefore seem to oppose the institution of monarchy. Hosea however had witnessed some of the most evil consequences of monarchical rule (Hos. vii 7, viii 4). His active ministry lay within the period 746-735 1); and during the years which immediately followed the reign of Jeroboam II (786-746) conspiracy and bloodshed were the means by which Israelite rulers ascended the throne. Zechariah, the son of Jeroboam, was only reigning for six months when he was over- thrown by Shallum (2 Kgs xv 8-10) who however only retained his office for a mere month before being assassinated by Menahem (2 Kgs xv 13-14). This assassin was guilty of the most inhuman with the object of illustrating Yahweh's 'mighty hand', e.g., Dt. iv 34, xi 2, xxvi 8; xxxiv 12. 1) W. F. ALBRIGHT, The Biblical Period, 1952, p. 39. Vetus Testamentum VII II 161</page><page sequence="6">C. F. WHITLEY crimes during the decade or so of his rule (2 Kgs xv 16-17) while his son Pekahiah was slain by Pekah after two years of disastrous government (2 Kgs xv 23-25). Thus within the space of a decade 1) no less than five kings of evil character ruled over Israel. Such conduct was particularly repulsive to Hosea who with his exalted sense of mercy and justice was naturally as critical of the monarchical insti- tution as he was of the religious and social order of his day. It is therefore probable that the unfavourable estimate of the monarchy which we find in certain Old Testament passages derives ultimately from Hosea 2) and that it was transmitted through the northern histor- ian E and his successors whose views some scholars designate as E 2 3). This view became associated to a greater or less degree with the E school of thought; and as a standpoint unfavourable to the monarchy is likewise evident in 1 Samuel (viii 7, x 9, xii 12, 17) it is likely that E (or E 2) material is also present in that book 4). It is evident then that some material of the Gideon stories is homogeneous with certain material which occurs throughout other parts of the Old Testament. It could of course be remarked with some cogency that this would hold good irrespective of whether the sources behind such material were written or oral. The difficulties encountered in attempting to decide whether a narrative is compiled from written or oral sources must be frankly admitted, although adherents of the traditio-historical school claim that two criteria may be employed. Thus according to Eduard NIELSEN 'a monotonous style, recurrent expressions, a fluent, paratactic style, a certain rhythm and euphony' are some of the characteristics of a narrative which has been handed down orally 5). On the other hand 'errors of the copyist, words read wrong, or interchanged, sentences omitted through dittography' 6) are the distinguishing marks of a narrative dependent on an earlier written stratum. This last criterion however 1) ALBRIGHT, op. cit., Chronological Appendix (p. 66). 2) Cf. MOORE, op. cit., pp. 229-230; BURNEY, op. cit., pp. xlv-vi, 183-4; C. R.

Thus while such criteria may be suggestive they cannot be regarded as infallible canons of source analysis, nor indeed is it always possible to employ them. While however it is doubtful if any decisive criteria may be employed in the field of Old Testament source analysis, the phenomenon of a series of narratives drawn from different books yet manifesting marked similarities of thought and language is suggestive of the view that such narratives derive from written rather than oral sources. The advocates of traditio-historical criticism attach considerable importance to the place of oral tradition in the life of the ancient Israelite 1). 'It is' writes NIELSEN 'a world from which his life draws nourishment; he lives in, its strengdhened in it, and it gives him a goal for his exertions' 2). If therefore tradition was so dominant a force in Old Testament times we should expect that the collector or editor who compiled the Xariant traditions would himself be influenced by them in respect of vocabularly and style. In the present text of the Gideon stories however there is an obvious difference between the style and vocabulary of the actual stories and the pre- fatory and concluding remarks attached to them (e.g., Jud. vi 1-2, viii 33-35). This would scarcely be the case if the collector or editor were moving in an environment in which tradition exercised a predominantly formative function. Such differences of thought, style and vocabulary would however naturally arise if the compiler were dealing with stories which had undergone literary fixation a century or so earlier. It has of course always been assumed by the literary critics that long periods of oral tradition lay behind the documents known as J and E 3), while P, the latest document to receive literary form, is thought to embody some of the earliest material. According to the proponents of traditio-historical criticism the change from oral to written literature 'occurred for Judah, presumably towards the end of the seventh century or at the beginning of the sixth, for northern 1) Cf. NIELSEN, op. cit., pp. 13 and 37. 2) Op. cit., p. 51. 3) Cf. S. R. DRIVER, Introd. to the Lit. of the Old Test. 1892, p. 110; R. H.

But it will be remem- bered that the literary critics have maintained that though J was probably composed in the ninth century, the northern document E was only written in about 750, while these two documents were combined into one narrative (JE) in about 650 or later 2). Accordingly it would seem that there is no great gulf fixed between the presup- positions of the literary and traditio-historical critic. It may be said however in conclusion that while the evidence suggests that the major items of the Gideon stories, as presented in our text, are derived from written sources it is possible that certain passages (e.g., vii 12, 23) which cannot with any certainty be attributed to a definite source may owe their origin to units of oral tradition which were current when the material was compiled. It may thus be that oral tradition exercised some influence in the final compilation of existing material and recognition of this possibility may lead to fruitful results in the source analysis of Old Testament narratives. 1) NIELSEN, op. cit., pp. 60-61. 2) Cf.
