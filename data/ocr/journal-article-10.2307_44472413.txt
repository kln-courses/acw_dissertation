Warren, Ml ABSTRACT An experimental program to characterize the impact response of a standard 3-ply high penetration resistance (HPR) windshield was conducted using a specially designed linear impactor test facility (l).* Parameters varied included the location and angle of impact, impactor mass and velocity, windshield bonding system, and windshield integrity (whether it was pre-cracked) . Specific findings included the following: • The magnitude of the initial spike in the force- time history is a function of the inertia of the windshield mass localized around the impact site. • The windshield bond has no effect on this initial force spike and thus cannot be used to alter or control it. • Minor pre-cracking of the windshield has no effect on the impact event. • The impact severity decreases as the rake angle (mounting angle with respect to the vertical) increases. • The location of the initial impact site has only a minor effect on the impact severity. • The coefficient for the ploughing component of head-windshield friction is approximately 1 independent of the test conditions. SIXTY TO 70% (2,3) OF INJURY producing accidents involve frontal impacts. With head- windshield contact occurring in an estimated 45% of such accidents (3), injuries related to windshield * Numbers in parentheses designate references at end of paper. impact have been found to contribute significantly - at least 6 to 11% (2,4) - to overall occupant harm. Supplemental inflatable restraints in combination with lap-shoulder belts would effectively eliminate head-windshield impact but only in their application envelop (5-7). For the present, this is principally the driver side for single collision frontal impacts at greater than 19.3 km/h. Thus, for the foreseeable future, the windshield will continue to play a significant role during frontal crashes in absorbing the occupant's pre-impact energy. Unfortunately, very little detailed information has been published in the open literature on the mechanical response of an HPR windshield to head impact (10,12,14,17-21). Qualification testing of windshields by standard ball (USA) (8) or head form (Europe) (9) drop tests is designed principally to measure the penetration resistance of the glazing and not provide detailed information on the windshield response. Recognizing this, researchers have developed more sophisticated drop test facilities (10,11) capable of providing HIC values and force-deflection traces though their applicability is limited primarily to normal drop conditions. An example of an acceleration-time trace appears in Fig. 1. It exhibits basic features common to all such traces - an initial high peak of short span/duration followed by a substantially broader plateau or bell shaped region of reduced magnitude. The former is frequently attributed to the inertial properties of the glass, the latter to the progressive breaking of glass/stretching of the PVB plastic interlayer as the windshield continues to deform. Full scale sled testing with either cadavers or sophisticated anthropomorphic test devices such as the Hybrid II and Hybrid III (13,14) dummies has been used, though primarily during the validation of new windshield technologies, to investigate the adequacy of 'real world' impact performance. Unfortunately, the complexity and variability inherent in such full scale tests have made them inefficient as tools for isolating and studying responses of individual components such as the 1729</page><page sequence="2">400 r 300 - 200 - IMPACT I 100 HIC 0 1 MS PER DIVISION --&gt; Fig. 1 Windshield acceleration - time trace 22 lb (10 kg) ball; drop height = 20 ft. (6.1 m). windshield. In response to this need, several component level head impact test devices have been developed and used in attempts to better quantify the head-windshield impact event (15-17). These have involved either free flight (15,16) or constrained trajectory (17) headforms. Unfortunately, limitations of both approaches as implemented (1) have lessened their abilities to characterize in detail the mechanical response of the windshield over the duration of the impact event. Complementing data from such windshield impact studies is information gained in fundamental studies of glass breakage (12,18,19). In fact, the latter studies have contributed significantly to the present understanding of windshield impact response as detailed, for example, in the 1965 SAE paper by Widman (10). This present understanding unfortunately is far short of that needed to formulate windshield impact models that are sufficiently detailed to be of use either in vehicle design studies or as inputs to occupant crash simulation programs such as MVMA-2D and CAL-3D. This need for a better understanding of windshield impact response led us to develop the windshield impact test facility and software described in Ref. (1). The remainder of the present report documents the successful use of this facility to characterize the impact response of a typical widely used 3-ply HPR windshield construction. TEST FACILITY AND PROCEDURE Impact tests of standard 2.29-0.76-2.29 mm 3-ply HPR A-body windshields were conducted losing the test facility shown in Fig. 2a. Test windshields differed from those standardly available to the consumer only in that they were all from a single carefully monitored production run. These windshields were bonded to a reinforced frame cut from an intermediate vehicle (B-pillar forward past the cowl) with the same polysulfide adhesive that is standardly used in sled tests. This sectioned 'body in white' was rigidly attached to a bedplate to minimize any movement of the windshield frame during impact tests. Pivot points and multiple attachment holes were built into the frame support structure to permit testing at arbitrary frame angles (with respect to the vertical) and arbitrary impact sites. The impactor was aligned parallel to the longitudinal axis of the test buck so that all tests simulated full frontal impacts. This impactor, which is shown in more detail in Fig. 2b, was designed and made specifically for this test program. It is an adjustable mass, bungee driven device, constrained to travel in a straight line, and instrumented to provide displacement, acceleration, and force (three components) time histories. The front end of the impactor is a rigid head form, shaped to the outside dimensions (minus nose) of the Hybrid III dummy, and mounted so that it is free to pivot in the A-P direction (about a point near what would be the mounting position of the triaxial accelerometer in the Hybrid III headform). Small elastic cords attached to the top and bottom of the headform provide an effective neck moment within the corridor specified for the Hybrid III dummy. The impactor was always positioned so that the large bungee cords which impart energy to it would be fully relaxed during the entire impact event. Further details of the construction and operation of the impact test facility may be found in Ref. (1). Fig. 2a Windshield impact test facility. Fig. 2b Windshield impactor. 1730</page><page sequence="3">Before moving on to discuss the procedures that were used to analyze the data generated with this impact test facility, it is important to reiterate the philosophy guiding its design because of the limits that this design philosophy places on the generality of the conclusions that are drawn. The impactor was designed with the specific intent of isolating and characterizing the response of the windshield during head-windshield impact. This design philosophy differs from that used in developing most existing full scale and component impact facilities where the focus was on trying (though frequently with limited success) to faithfully reproduce the global head-windshield impact event rather than on trying to isolate the contribution of just the windshield. Because of this basic difference in design philosophy, there are three aspects of the head- windshield impact event that are not reproduced by the impact test facility used in the current study. First, the desire to isolate the force-deflection characteristic (compliance) of the "stiff" windshield dictated the use of an essentially rigid impactor. This ruled out the use of the standard, flexible Hybrid III headform which would have produced a force-deflection characteristic that was more a measure of the compliance of the headform itself, not the windshield. Second, the trajectory of the impactor had to be repeatable without variation and suited for straight-forward conversion of force and acceleration traces into normal and tangential components with respect to the windshield. To satisfy these requirements while at the same time trying to maintain the basic features of head- windshield interaction, we chose an impactor that was constrained to travel in a straight line along its axis and that contained a headform that could rotate in the A-P direction. A preliminary series of tests showed that this configuration did indeed reproduce the general time histories of both windshield crack pattern development and impactor acceleration that are seen in sled tests (1). Third and finally, while we can vary the mass of our impactor between tests, its design prevents us from varying its mass during the course of an individual event. In contrast to this, in full scale sled tests the effective mass of the Hybrid III headform continuously varies due to loading by the upper torso (10,17). Our choice of a starting mass of 10 kg for this impactor meant that it more closely simulates the effective mass of the Hybrid III headform during the latter stages of the impact event (10). (This is a consensus opinion put forward by SAE in the mid-1960's based on the best information available at that time (10).) However, for those event parameters that are a function of just the impact energy, mass-velocity scaling of our impactor data permits close simulation of the initial stages of impact during which the effective weight of the Hybrid III headform is near its real mass of 4.5 kg. DATA PROCESSING AND ANALYSIS PROCEDURES Primary transducers used to obtain information about the impact event are indicated on the schematic in Fig. 3. These included a triaxial piezo-electric force transducer mounted behind the headform pivot point, a displacement measuring optical encoder mounted on the top of the impactor rod, and a uniaxial accelerometer attached to its trailing end. High speed electronically recorded 'films' (Spin Physics SP-2000 Motion Analysis System) and standard videotape recordings provided additional documentation of the dynamic aspects of the impact event. The axis system used in this study (Fig. 3) was chosen to facilitate data manipulation in this specific application. The z-axis lies along the axis of the impactor, positive being towards the windshield; the x-axis is in the vertical direction, positive being upwards; and the y-axis lies in the horizontal plane being essentially parallel to the undeformed windshield surface. (It is important to note that this coordinate system differs from that adopted by SAE (22) and care should be taken by those used to working with the SAE system when interpreting the intermediate x, y, and z results reported in this paper.) The transducers were positioned so as to directly provide time histories of Fx', Fy, and Fz - the three components of force in the impactor rod anterior to the headform pivot point, Az - the axial acceleration of the rod, and Dz - the axial displacement of the impactor. In addition, data reduction software built into the test controller provided time histories of Vz - impactor axial velocity - and Az through two successive differentiations of Dz, and of Vz and Dz through two successive integrations of Az. Each of the five primary transducer signals - Fx, Fy, Fz, Az, and Dz - as well as one of the representations for Vz were digitally sampled at the rate of 8000 hertz.

In terms of individual parameters, over thirty different quantities are automatically calculated for each impact test. A sample output listing appears in Table I. In Table I and throughout this paper the units used are G's for acceleration, N (lbf) for force, kg (lbs) for mass (weight), joules (inch- pounds) for energy, cm (inches) for length, km/h (miles per hour) for velocity, and milliseconds for 1731</page><page sequence="4">time. Note that at the time this study was performed there was no time interval limit on the HIC calculation in the routines that were used. As an aid in interpreting these variables, consider the free body diagram of the impactor in Fig. 4.

Letting m1, m2, and m3 be, respectively, the portions of the mass of the impactor behind the triaxial force cell, between the triaxial force cell and the headform pivot point, and from the headform pivot point forward, then M, the total mass of the impactor is just M = ml + m2 + m3 (1) The equations of motion for each of these three 'rigid body' segments in the z direction are just mļ®z1 = - Fz (2) m2*Z2 = Fz - FPz (3) and m3*Z3 = FPz * Fwz (4) In these expressions, ix (=AJ, z2, and z^ are, respectively, the z components of acceleration of mass portions m1, m», and m3; Fpz is the z component of force in the rod at the pivot point; and Fwz is the net z component of the distributed force between the impactor headform and windshield. Similar sets of equations can be written for the x and y directions. In addition to these equations of motion, the following constraints are imposed on the impactor response due to the specifics of its design: X1 =X2 =*1 =^2 =^3 = 0 (5) Assuming additionally (though to good approximation) that the rod and headform are rigid bodies, that the pivot point is frictionless, and that rotational acceleration of the headform has a negligible effect on the components of headform - windshield force,* Eqs. (1-5) can be manipulated to * Sample calculations performed in Ref. (1) demonstrate that this latter assumption, that rotational acceleration of the impactor headform has a negligible effect on the components of headform-windshield force, is valid as it introduces an error typically in the range of 1 to 2% but in no case greater than 5% of the true value. 1732</page><page sequence="5">obtain the following simplified expressions for the three components of headform- windshield force (l): Fwz = (M/mjFz (6) Fwx = Fx (7) Fwy = Fy (8) With this as background, the specific algorithms that were developed to calculate the output parameters in Table I will now be discussed. As indicated, time traces of Fz, Fx, Fy, Az, Vz, and Dz were converted into digital records at the data center, these digital records serving as the starting point for our data analysis. Several important measures of occupant harm - HIC, SI, and 3-ms peak acceleration - are based on the resultant acceleration denoted by Axyz. However, the impactor used in the present study was constrained to travel along its axis. Thus only the component of acceleration along this axis has any meaning in a real sense in terms of rigid body mechanics since only in this direction can there be any displacement. Lacking a true resultant acceleration we thus could not calculate these traditional measures of occupant harm using standard formulae. Still desiring to present our results in a format that would be meaningful to those in the safety community, we adopted an alternative approach of calculating values for these measures using force based 'effective' values for the Ax and Ay components of acceleration. These effective Ax and Ay components were obtained by dividing the measured x and y components of force by what were judged to be the effective head masses in these two directions. The resulting expressions for Ax and Ay took the following forms: Ax = Fx/10 (9) Ay = Fy/4.5 (10) Note that these expressions assume effective head masses of 10 kg (22 lbs) in the vertical direction and 4.5 kg (10 lbs) in the lateral direction, respectively. The effective resultant acceleration, Axyzp on which effective values for HIC, SI, and 3-ms peak acceleration were based was then calculated using the following expression: AxyZj = (Ax2 + Ay2 -h Az2)1/2 (11) Equivalent expressions were also developed for effective acceleration components based on an assumed effective head mass of 4.5 kg (10 lbs) in both the x (vertical) and z directions. Given these algorithms, other symbols in Table I and the quantities that they represent are: Fx/lO*M/4.5 the effective x component of acceleration assuming a 4.5 kg (10 lb) effective head mass in the vertical direction; Az#M/4.5 the effective z component of acceleration assuming a 4.5 kg (10 lb) effective head mass in the fore-aft direction, this being the case at the beginning of the impact event in Hybrid III sled tests; Fz/m^M/4.5 a force based measure of the effective z component of acceleration assuming a 4.5 kg (10 lb) effective head mass in this direction; Int. Vz the impactor velocity obtained by a single integration of Az; Int. Dz the impactor axial displacement obtained by a double integration of Az; Energy the time integral of the product Fz*Dz; n and t the components of force (Fn, Ft) and displacement (Dn, Dt) that are normal and parallel, respectively, to the original undeformed plane of the windshield surface; Axyz2 the resultant acceleration based on an effective 4.5 kg (10 lb) head mass, that is calculated using Ax*M/4.5, Ay, and Az*M/4.5; Axyz3 the resultant acceleration calculated using Ax, Ay, and Fz/m^M/4.5; Fxyz the resultant force acting on the windshield calculated using Fwx, Fwy, and Fwz; HICp HIC2, effective values of the Head Injury and HIC3 Criterion (23) calculated using, respectively, Axyzp Axyz2, and Axyz3; and Sip SL, effective values of the Gadd and SIg Severity Index (24) calculated using, respectively, AxyZp Axyz2, and Axyzg. In the discussion to follow, HICp HIC2, SL, SI2, and 3 ms peak values of Axyzx and Axyz2 will be termed acceleration based measures since the formulae on which they are based utilize the accelerometer signal Az. HIC3, SI3, and the 3-ms peak value of Axyz3 will be termed force based measures since the formulae on which they are based employ force based measures for all three effective components of acceleration. TEST RESULTS: DISCUSSION The following parameters were considered in this study of the impact response of 3-ply HPR windshields: impactor mass and velocity, location of initial impact, windshield installation angle, whether or not the windshield was pre-cracked, whether or 1733</page><page sequence="6">not the windshield was bonded into the vehicle frame, and whether or not the headform at the front of the impactor was free to rotate in the A-P direction during the impact event. In all there were 13 different parameter configurations considered in the test program. Parameter values for each of these test cases (configurations) are summarized in Table II. The term "Barrier Site" in Table II refers to impacts at the same location on the windshield as observed in standard barrier tests of intermediate vehicles with unrestrained dummies in the right-front seating position. Table III contains a summary of the different approaches to data analysis that were utilized in this study. Also indicated are the types of information that each of these approaches has contributed to the characterization of windshield impact response. The primary use of values of discrete output quantities such as HIC from a single test is as indicators of windshield to windshield variability. Case average values of discrete output quantities such as HIC serve as indicators of the average impact response to be expected of a windshield for a particular event parameter configuration. These case average discrete data values and their associated standard deviations also provide an estimate of the statistically reasonable variability to be expected in windshield impact response for a given parameter configuration and help quantify the effect of changing test parameters such as installation angle. Functional dependencies of case average values on impactor velocity and W/S installation angle provide a means for estimating the change in impact "severity" that would accompany a change in either of these two parameters. The functional dependency on velocity also provides a means for those using occupant crash dynamic simulations to introduce rate dependent- effects. Data traces from single tests serve as indicators of the actual variability in windshield impact response to be expected in the field. They also can serve to identify serious problems such as bond loss around the perimeter or significant laminate tearing prior to their occurring in the field. Case average data traces provide a rapid means of determining and identifying the specific nature of any significant effects that a particular test parameter can have on windshield impact response. In addition, case average traces of Fn vs. Dn and Ft/Fn vs. Dn are primary descriptors of windshield impact response. These are suitable with only minor modification for direct use in most occupant crash dynamics simulation programs. The organizational framework in Table III will now be followed in presenting and discussing the findings of this study.

Ideally, if there were no error or variability introduced by the test and measurement process and no variability in the impact response of the type of item being tested, one impact test would suffice for each parameter configuration. An initial test series did in fact show that the impact test device used in this program (l) introduces little variability in the test results. However, differences were observed in the measured values from 'identical' tests with this facility of supposedly 'identical' windshields - an example of such differences can be seen in the partial data records appearing in Table IV. Such differences, therefore, clearly indicated variability in W/S impact response and thus the need for running multiple rather than single tests for each parameter configuration. This is consistent with findings of earlier studies of windshield impact (12-14) in which multiple tests were always found to be necessary to characterize the response. Thus output values from a single impact test were used in the current study only to identify any unusual circumstances such as a bond failure or failure of a transducer that might have dramatically altered the output record of the impact event. DISCRETE VALUES: CASE AVERAGE DATA VALUES - The high degree of repeatability in test conditions provided by the impact facility used in this experiment left the windshield itself as the major source of the variability in the test results. Because the measured variability is therefore a very real characteristic of windshield response, it can be expected to exist to the same degree in the field. The potential effect of such variability on occupant safety should be a consideration in those cases where this variability can be quantified. Thus multiple 'identical' tests were necessary in this study not only to determine the average performance and how this changes with event parameters but also to quantify the variability inherent in windshield response in general. The first step in the statistical analysis of the test data involved grouping tests by their parameter configuration. The data sets from the 70 tests were arranged into thirteen groups according to the parameter settings listed in Table II. As an example of one such group, a partial listing of some of the discrete values from each of the five tests of unbonded windshields appears in Table V. Data for each of the five tests occupies a different horizontal row. Test numbers are listed in the first column on the left. Each of the remaining columns contain the five recorded/ calculated values for the output quantity listed at its head with the average value and standard deviation appearing at the bottom. As previously indicated, it is these average values rather than those from an individual test that are felt to best characterize the windshield response for the test configuration; the accompanying values of standard deviation provide a measure of the variability to be expected in the response of an individual windshield. The Appendix contains a listing of the average values and standard deviations for 28 of the discrete test outputs for each of the 13 test configurations. Taking first a broad global look at these results, certain general observations can be made. First, in terms of average values, many of the discrete parameters vary substantially between test configurations indicating that many of the test parameters that were considered do indeed have an effect on the windshield impact response. Secondly, values for standard deviation were in general only a small percentage of the corresponding average values. Only in rare instances did they exceed 30 percent. Specific observations can be made on the significance of between case differences. These observations are based on the following special form of the Student's t test (25): Ve .1 ■ (i/=na+nb .1 ) + (nb~l)ff^) / („a+nb-2) ) }X/2 (15) 1735</page><page sequence="8">TABLE IV Partial Data Records Illustrating Windshield Variability (Accelerations in G's, forces in N) 20.3 km/h, Bonded, 15.7 kg Uass, Flex Head Test Fz Ax (Fx/10) Ay (Fy/4.5) Az Ax*U/4.5 Az*U/4.5 Fz/ml*U/4.5 9 1675 -11.28 6.613 17.49 -39.13 60.7 44.88 10 1734 -11.5 4.215 18.58 -39.91 64.49 46.46 11 1838 -11.62 6.803 23.34 -40.32 81 49.25 22 1381 -11.61 3.121 18.08 -40.27 62.72 36.99 23 1985 -13.28 4.305 21.41 -46.1 74.31 53.17 48 1839 -14.15 3.733 25 -52.18 90.34 48.72 24.6 km/h, Bonded, Locked Head Test Fz Ax (Fx/10) Ay (Fy/4.5) Az Ax*M/4.5 Az*U/4.5 Fz/ml*M/4.5 16 1148 -10.19 3.295 22.63 -22.93 50.92 35.38 27 2177 -11.33 3.992 38.42 -27.95 94.83 64.95 28 1360 -11.46 3.655 28.59 -28.28 70.56 40.6 29 1088 -11.76 3.533 26.13 -29.03 64.48 32.47 47 1980 -10.41 3.963 40.78 -25.69 100.6 59.08 TABLE V Partial Listing of Discrete Data Values for Unbonded Windshields 24.5 km/h, no Bond, 10 kg Uass, Flex Head Test Fz Ax (Fx/10) Ay (Fy/4.5) Az HICI HIC2 HIC3 Fn 14 1970 -8.74 3.176 -34.58 7.71 54.3 10.54 1934 19 2094 -16.86 3.214 35.78 18.18 128.5 17.88 1991 33 2363 -16.30 3.592 33.40 17.37 155.2 16.74 2196 39 2292 -16.55 3.586 38.96 17.13 153.0 17.84 2135 46 2109 -16.15 2.999 33.71 11.53 103.2 16.08 1940 Av. 2166 -14.92 3.31 21.45 14.38 118.9 15.82 2039 Std. 142 3.10 0.24 28.09 4.09 37.4 2.72 107' Dev. 1736</page><page sequence="9">If tcalc * Sable . . then Ya=Yb to that level I/, . level .

This form of the Student's t test was applied to the average discrete output values from different test configurations to identify any statistically significant effects that the different test conditions had on windshield impact response. The results summarized in Table VI include the more important of the statistically significant changes in output parameter values that were identified in this manner.

Looking first at force components, there are no significant differences in any of the 3-ms peak values though both the peak tangential component and peak resultant are significantly changed. In terms of other measures, both components of windshield displacement are seen to increase with velocity. Additionally, the traditional safety measures, HIC and SI, differ at the 95% confidence level except those that are exclusively based on force (HIC^ and SI3). Considering these findings in total, the increases in absorbed energy, HIC, and SI would thus appear to be due primarily to the increased windshield displacement (and increased event time) and not to any overall increase in force levels. This is substantiated by a comparison of the average Fxyz vs. t and Fn vs. Dn (Fig. 27) traces for the two test configurations. Consider next the effect of changing the impactor mass and velocity while maintaining the same pre-impact impactor energy. Significant effects of such a specialized change in impactor momentum are indicated in the second column of Table VI which contains a comparison of test configurations 1 and 3. Most of the discrete outputs are seen to be significantly affected in this case. Notable exceptions are the two components of windshield displacement, Dn and Dt, implying a direct relationship between the impactor energy and the maximum windshield deformation. This is further evidence supporting the contention that the force levels developed by the windshield after the initial 'inertial spike' are much more dependent on the extent of deformation than on the deformation rate. The significant effects of changing the windshield installation angle (angle with respect to the vertical) while maintaining the same impact location are indicated in the third column of Table VI where the results of a comparison of test configurations 1 (58°) and 5 (28°) are displayed. All discrete output quantities except the instantaneous peak value of Ft are seen to be significantly affected by this change. Referring to the Appendix, comparison of the actual average data values for these two test configurations further reveals that the values of all of the discrete output quantities increase with decreasing installation angle. In terms of head injuries, these results indicate that the impact severity increases its the windshield installation or rake angle decreases, that is, as the windshield plane more closely approaches vertical. (The effect that this parameter might have on neck injuries could be evaluated using either occupant simulation models or full scale sled and barrier tests.) The effects of varying the location of the impact site on the discrete output quantities are displayed in the fourth column of Table VI. This column contains a comparison of test configurations 1 and 7 which differed only in the vertical location of the impact site (Table II). '.Statistically significant differences are indicated in the instantaneous peak force values, in several of the instantaneous peak acceleration measures, and in HIC2 and all values of SI. The complete data records in the Appendix show that there is, however, no consistent trend in these differences. The force based quantities decrease as the impact site is shifted downward to the vertical middle of the windshield while the acceleration based measures increase. Looking at the actual numbers for these two configurations, one sees that a major reason for this apparent inconsistency is that none of these significant differences is greater than 20% and that most are in the range from 10-15%, i.e., most are rather small. The implication of these findings is thus that for a given pre-impact velocity, the location of the initial impact has only a small effect on occupant harm. Put differently, it is impossible to hit just the windshield and still be close enough to its edge for there to be more than a 20% change in any of the measures of occupant harm. The effects of varying the installation angle, this time for the vertical middle impact site, are found in the comparison of test configurations 7 and 8 in column 5 of Table VI. By changing the installation angle from 58 to 0 degrees (vertical), all recorded force outputs, both displacement components, the force based measures of peak resultant acceleration, and all HIC and SI measures are all significantly changed. Some of these changes are to be expected, of course, since all of the off-axis components are essentially zero for the 90 degree impact case (0 degree installation angle). The remainder are consistent with the previous finding (column 3 of Table VI) that a decrease in installation angle increases the severity of the impact in terms of potential occupant harm. The effect of the windshield bond was quantified by comparing the average discrete output values for test configurations 1 and 2, these corresponding, respectively, to bonded and freely supported (no bond) conditions. The statistically significant effects identified in this comparison appear in column 6 of Table VI. Except for the 3 ms peak value of Fn, there are no statistically significant effects in terms of discrete peak force values. The principle differences are seen to be in Axyz2 and Axyz^ whose changes actually are relatively small, being (from the Appendix) -11 and +7.3%, respectively, and in all of the HIC and SI measures. These latter six differences are considerably larger all lying in a narrow band from -74 to -83%. These findings indicate that the windshield bond has no significant effect on the initial peak values in the windshield force-deflection and force-time traces, i.e., that the initial peaks are not produced by global bending of the windshield. (This is confirmed by the average response traces that appear in Fig. 25 as will be discussed at a latter point in this paper.) Since the initial peak values are not altered by the absence of .the bond, it is suggested that they are due to localized bending stresses resulting from windshield inertia. Specifically, it is suggested that they result from the acceleration of that portion of the windshield 1738</page><page sequence="11">mass that is localized around the initial impact site. This finding coupled with that from the study of impact location are consistent with the explanation that the time periods involved are so short that the boundary /mounting system can have little effect on the initial portion of the impact event. The considerable differences in HIC and SI values result from the fact that in the case of no bond, forces between impactor and windshield drop to zero once the windshield has been accelerated to the speed of the impactor. There is no prolonged ploughing of headform through windshield lasting until the end of the impact event as is the case when the windshield is firmly bonded to the vehicle frame. The effects of allowing the impactor to rotate in the A-P direction with a neck moment in the Hybrid III corridor are isolated when the data obtained using test configurations 1 and 4 are compared (column 7 of Table VI). Whether or not the impactor was free to rotate had a significant effect not only on the instantaneous peak values of force and acceleration, but also on the first and third measures of both HIC and SI. Comparison of the actual data values that are given in the Appendix for these two test configurations indicates an inconsistency in trends - some values increase while others decrease with the change in configurations. Furthermore, as discussed in Ref. (l), windshield crack patterns and global deformation shapes differed between the two cases, those produced when the impactor was free to rotate more closely matching sled test results. This lack of consistency emphasizes that by restricting headform rotation fundamental changes are made in the nature of the impact event and it becomes much less representative of real world impacts. Impactors that do not allow for head rotation thus cannot be expected to reliably predict the in-field response of the windshield to head impact. The effect of windshield pre-cracking on the discrete data determined for the impact event can be inferred from the comparisons of test configurations 1 and 11, 1 and 12, and 11 and 12 appearing, respectively, in the final three columns of Table VI. The comparison of configurations 1 and 11 indicates that, even when hitting the windshield at a site that has already been previously impacted with sufficient energy to produce a radial star crack pattern, only instantaneous peak values of acceleration and resultant force are changed (decreased). There are no significant changes in either 3 ms peak values or in any of the measures of HIC and SI. If the energy of the pre-impact was increased to the point that a first fold pie-shaped crack pattern was initially produced, the decreases in the instantaneous peak values of both Ft and Fxyz associated with the second impact are seen to reach the 95% significance level. Still there are no significant differences in any of either the 3 ms or HIC and SI values. This is in spite of the fact that there is a statistically significant decrease in the values of both Ft and Fxyz and the peak acceleration measures between test configurations 11 and 12 (column 10). Thus pre-cracking of the windshield, even if severe and exactly centered at the impact site, can at most affect the instantaneous peak force and acceleration values. The random cracks produced by stone impingement or frame distortion are not expected to have any measurable effect on any of these impact measures. The only exception to this is the potential for significant deterioration in the 'safety net' function of the windshield due to propagation of moisture through any cracks in the glass plies into the PVB interlayer. Finally, it is to be noted that the fact that the instantaneous peak values of force and acceleration are reduced progressively by the presence of just radial and then radial plus first fold shaped crack patterns is supporting evidence for the inertial dependence of the initial spikes in the force and acceleration time traces. This follows from the fact that less windshield mass is initially accelerated as one goes progressively from a new windshield through windshields with first radial and then pie- wedge shaped pre- impact crack patterns. DISCRETE VALUES: FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY OF CASE AVERAGE VALUES ON V - Test configurations 9, 10, 13, and 1 differed only in terms of the pre-impact velocities of the impactor which were, respectively, 4.3, 5.8, 18.2, and 24.8 km/h. Thus, regression analyses could be performed on the average results from each of these four test configurations to determine the functional dependency (if any) of each of the discrete output quantities on the pre- impact impactor velocity. Power regression analyses were performed for each discrete output value since all should be zero for zero impact velocity. Table VII contains a listing of the power regression relationships for 17 of the more important discrete output parameters as well as the correlation coefficients 7 in each case. The smallest of the correlation coefficients is the value .917 for Axyz2, and there are only three of the 17 values that are less than .95. Such numbers indicate a consistently good fit of the data and are strong evidence that all of the different discrete output parameters are dependent on the pre-impact impactor velocity. Figures 5-7 contain plots of power regression relationships superimposed on the actual test average discrete data values. These illustrate respectively, worst case (7=. 917), average case (7=. 961), and best case (7=. 997) fits of different discrete output parameter data by power regression relationships. They provide a visual reference for the overall 'goodness of fit' for the range of power regression relationships in Table VII. Besides these general observations two comments seem appropriate on the specific nature of the velocity dependencies indicated in Table VII. First, the power regression relationships relating all of the HIC and SI measures to velocity all have exponents in excess of 1. They range from 1.44 to 1.99 with corresponding values for the two parameters tracking each other quite closely. Second, the only additional output parameters exhibiting greater than a linear dependence on 1739</page><page sequence="12">velocity are Dn and Dt the two components of windshield deformation.

DISCRETE VALUES: FUNCTIONAL DEPENDENCY OF CASE AVERAGE HIC AND SI ON Wā/8 INSTALLATION ANGLE - Data obtained using test configurations 1 (58°), 5 (28°), and 8 (0°) was used to estimate the functional dependencies of HIC and SI on W/S installation angle. Figure 8 contains plots of the power regression relationships that were found between HIC and SI and the windshield installation angle a, both relationships having a regression coefficient of 0.998. It is to be noted that the quantities plotted are average HIC and SI values calculated using the following expressions: HICav = (HIC1 + HIC2 + HIC3)/3 (16) SĪAV = (si, + si2 + sy/3 This format was chosen since, as was previously indicated, configuration 8 differed not 1740</page><page sequence="13">only in impact angle but also in impact location (center vs. barrier site). These expressions are thus considered only approximate and subject to possible future revision. Any such revision most probably will be minor, however, given the earlier finding (documented in this report) that the impact site has only a small effect on most output parameters. 600 -- 400 * « aqj X ^ hicav = Hic.t/ Ay X X ^ Ay ' T * »»a 200 -• X 0 1 1 1 H' 0 20 40 60 80 INSTALLATION ANGLE a o 600 400 SIAV = 18.1.

DATA TRACES: FROM A SINGLE TEST - Twenty-four different data traces were standardly produced for each impact test. These consisted of plots of 20 different output parameters as a function of time and plots of four different parameters as a function of components of windshield displacement. The quantities plotted along with their functional dependencies are tabulated in Table VIII. An example of a single test data trace appears in Fig. 9 which contains a plot of Fxyz vs. t for test number 26 which was conducted with test configuration 1. Fig. 9 Fxyz vs. t.

This is illustrated in Fig. 10 which contains plots of Fn vs. Dn for seven tests that were conducted using configuration 1. As previously indicated, because of the high degree of repeatability provided by the impact test facility, it was felt that such differences in the output traces were indicative of the actual variability in windshield impact response to be expected in the field. Such individual traces were thus never used to represent the expected average response of the windshield. Rather, their principal uses were to get a gauge on the range and types of differences to be expected between individual windshields as well as to identify when there was an unusual occurrence such as laminate tearing or bond failure that dramatically altered the impact event. Fig. 10 Fn vs. Dn for individual windshield impact tests conducted with test configuration 1. 1741</page><page sequence="14">DATA TRACES: CASE AVERAGE VALUES - The variability inherent in windshield response as indicated by differences in such single event-single parameter data traces led us, as previously indicated, to adopt a statistical approach for characterizing the expected in-field performance. Case average data traces formed the starting point for this statistical characterization. These were created for each output parameter by computing point-by-point the average value of the individual values from all of the tests that were conducted with a particular test configuration. In all, there were 312 of such case average traces that could be computed, one for each of the 24 parameters in Table VIII for each of the 13 test configurations. Of these, force-displacement plots command the greatest interest since this is the format used for incorporating windshield impact response in most occupant simulation models. Figures 11-22 contain plots of test configuration average values of Fn vs. Dn and of Ft/Fn vs. Dn for the six basic test configurations 1, 3, 5, 7, 10, and 13. Note that each plot contains not only the average trace (made up of instantaneous case average values) but also curves representing + and -1 standard deviation from the average. The shaded band in each case thus spans the response of approximately 2/3 of all windshields tested. It gives a concise representation of the variability to be expected in the performance of actual windshields in the field. By using all three curves shown in each figure in an occupant simulation model, one can thus get a more complete picture of the fleet-wide effect that the windshield will have on occupant kinematics in the vehicle configuration being modeled. Two general observations will be made about windshield impact response based on a study of the individual case average traces. The first concerns the case average plots of Ft/Fn versus Dn, six of which appear in Figs. 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, and 22. Inspection of these plots for all thirteen test configurations reveals that, except for small differences in the first half inch of windshield deformation, the case average value of Ft/Fn is approximately 1 independent of both the test configuration and the magnitude of windshield deformation. The second general observation is based on the data appearing in Table IX which lists two different sets of values for each of the different HIC and SI measures for five representative test configurations. The three different measures of each of these quantities are given in order for each case as one proceeds down a vertical column. Members of the first set, which are denoted as case average values, were determined by taking the average of the individual values of the corresponding HIC and SI measures for the impact tests conducted using a common test configuration. The numbers in parentheses are the associated values of standard deviation. Members of the second set, which are denoted as average trace values, were calculated using the case TABLE II HIC and SI Values for Selected Test Configurations Average Test Case Average Values Trace Values Configuration HIC SI HIC SI 1 66.8 (7.55) 73.0 (4.37) 61.2 64.0 529.7 (91.4) 579.2 (81.0) 484.1 506.1 92.0 (15.1) 114.8 (20.8) 79.6 93.9 3 40.6 (3.30) 42.8 (2.97) 38.3 39.7 918.6 (135.) 969.3 (128.) 862.6 896.7 166.6 (31.0) 198.7 (32.4) 144.1 176.1 5 83.7 (14.9) 98.3 (14.5) 81.9 92.4 757.5 (134.) 889.8 (130.) 741.0 837.3 303.5 (37.1) 354.2 (33.9) 286.2 321.4 7 72.2 (3.10) 78.2 (3.12) 71.5 75.5 649.0 (28.6) 704.2 (28.6) 642.8 680.0 77.9 (8.33) 91.4 (8.93) 73.2 84.3 10 10.1 (1.28) 10.8 (1.35) 9.8 10.4 89.4 (11.4) 95.6 (11.9) 86.7 92.1 9.1 (0.28) 9.7 (0.40) 7.7 7.8 1742</page><page sequence="15">average traces of resultant acceleration. Inspection of these two sets of numbers demonstrates that while case average values of the HIC and SI measures are in general higher than the corresponding average trace values, the two sets of numbers are in general consistent and are sufficiently close together to make it a moot point as to which set really gives a more accurate representation of the average occupant harm. Detailed information on the effects of input parameters such as windshield installation angle can also be obtained by superimposing the case average traces for different test configurations. At an earlier point in this report, the Student's t test was used to determine the statistical significance of differences in the case average values of discrete output parameters. The Student's t test was also adopted, though in a slightly less rigorous sense, for the analysis of case average traces. In adopting the Student's t, it was noted with the aid of the Appendix and Table VI that, in general, two case average values of a discrete output parameter are significantly different at the 95% level when the difference between them is greater than the sum of their standard deviations. Thus two case average data traces would, in general, be significantly different at this level at all points where their shaded bands do not overlap, i.e. where their average curves are farther apart than the sum of their standard deviations.

Examples of superimposed pairs of case average traces appear in Figures 23-27. All provide additional evidence in support of the significant parameter effects that were previously- identified. Figure 23 offers a comparison of case average Fxyz vs. t plots for configurations 1 and 6, new versus lightly pre-impacted windshields. The only portion of the time histories with a significant difference, i.e. where the two case 'envelopes' do not overlap, is the initial 'inertial' spike. Thus, in concurrence with previously presented data, the only effect that windshield pre-cracking can have, and this being only in the case of extensive pre- cracking at the exact impact site, is a decrease in the initial 'inertial' spike. Fig. 23 Case average Fxyz vs. t traces for test configurations 1 and 6 (new vs. pre- impacted windshields). 1744</page><page sequence="17">Case average plots of Fxyz versus time are superimposed in Fig. 24 for impact tests conducted with 58 degree (normal) and 28 degree installation angles, test configurations 1 and 5, respectively. The response envelopes for these two cases are seen to be significantly different over the majority of the impact event, and differ in a manner supportive of the conclusion that the impact severity increases as the rake angle decreases. Fig. 24 Case average Fxyz vs. t traces for test configurations 'l and 5 (58 vs. 28 degree installation angles). The effect of the windshield bond is illustrated by the differences in the case average Fxyz vs. t plots for bond and no bond test configurations (1 and 2, respectively) appearing in Fig. 25. The windshield bond has no effect on the initial force spike and is seen to exhibit a continuously significant effect only after approximately 12 ms have elapsed. Fig. 25 Case average Fxyz vs. t traces for test configurations 1 and 2 (bond vs. no bond) . Case average plots of Fxyz versus time for impacts at barrier test and vertical middle windshield locations are superimposed in Fig. 26. This comparison of the test response envelopes for configurations 1 and 7, respectively, reveals no gaps between the two envelopes, i.e. no significant differences. This is further evidence supporting the contention that the impact site can have at most only a minor effect on the severity of the impact event. Fig. 26 Case average Fxyz vs. t traces for test configurations 1 and 7 (barrier test vs. vertical middle impact site). Finally, Fig. 27 displays case average traces of Fn versus Dn for tests conducted at 24.8 and 18.2 km/h, these corresponding to test configurations 1 and 13, respectively. The pre-impact speed of the impactor is seen to have a significant effect on two major aspects of the impact event force trace, the height of the initial 'inertial' spike and the ultimate extent of the windshield deformation both increasing with increasing speed. Fig. 27 Case average Fn vs. Dn traces for test configurations 1 and 13 (15.4 vs. 11.3 mph (24.8 vs. 18.2 km/h) pre-impact velocity). CONCLUSIONS In general, this study demonstrated that an impactor constrained to travel in a straight line with a headform free to rotate in the A-P (anterior-posterior) direction can be used to reproduce (and thus study) many of the significant aspects of head-windshield interaction. Concerning specific findings, the following general statements about the impact response of 3-ply H PR windshields are supported by the data obtained in this study: • The magnitude of the initial spike in the force-time history is a function of the inertia of the windshield mass localized around the impact site. • The windshield bond has no effect on this initial force spike and thus cannot be used to alter /control it. 1745</page><page sequence="18">• Minor pre-cracking of the windshield has no effect on the impact event. • The impact severity decreases as the installation angle increases. • The location of the initial impact site has only a minor effect on the impact severity. • The coefficient for the ploughing component of head-windshield friction is approximately 1 independent of the test conditions. • In general, as impact velocity increases, the peak force, penetration depth, HIC, and SI all increase. Specific dependencies of output parameters on impactor velocity are listed in Table VII. • The value of HIC calculated using the case average acceleration-time history is close to the average of the HIC values calculated from the individual tests comprising that case. A roadmap for finding additional results/conclusions that may be of particular interest to a specific reader is provided in Tables II and III. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS I would like to thank J. R.
