<plain_text><page sequence="1">Images from Shanxi of Tejaprabha's Paradise] Marilyn Gridley University of Missouri at Kansas City 1 he Buddha of Blazing Light (S: Tejaprahba; C: Chishengguang), holding a golden wheel and seated on a splendid sumem throne, is the focus of a paradise scene, the grand mural of the Chinese Temple Room in the Nelson Atkins Museum of Art (Fig. i).The Sun, the Moon, the Five Planets and four other "luminaries," all in anthropomorphic form, join with a multitude of deities in an assembly that lit erally outshines that of any other Buddha. He is named the Buddha of Blazing Light because his pores emit flaming light.2 The Nelson-Atkins Museum acquired the mural in 1932; it had been painted for the main hall of Guangshengsi Xiasi in Hongdong xian, southern Shanxi Province. Three other murals from that temple are in the United States: one, at the Metropolitan Museum in New York, is also from the main hall, and two murals from the front hall of the Lower Monastery are now in the University of Pennsylvania Museum in Philadelphia. Studies of these murals from Guangshengsi, as part of a larger group ofYuan- and Ming dynasty murals in North America, have answered many questions about their dates, provenance, basic iconography, and style.3 What circumstances, though, would have prompted Guangshengsi to commission such a grand mural of Tejaprabha? He is a relatively rare subject in extant Buddhist art, and research into his nature and function is also relatively rare. In the Tejaprabha sutra translated by Amoghavajra in the eighth century, S?kyamuni preaches to the space-travelling beings, the nine seizers (luminaries), the twenty-eight moon mansions, the twelve solar deities, and all the other sages; in the course of his sermon he advises kings and ministers whose realms are threatened to chant the Tejaprabha dh?ranX, thereby nullifying the threat. Tejaprabha is able not only to nullify calamities but to transfer them to enemies: "If Mars is causing calamities at state borders or causing obstacles, vehemently chant this dhdranl sutra. Calamities will be transferred to disobedient kings and rebellious people."4 In another, slightly longer, Tejaprabha sutra translated in the Tang, "practice of the rites described therein is recommended for 'all monarchs, their great ministers and dependents, and the common people as a whole, who may suffer the oppression of the sun, moon, five planets, R?hu, Ketu, comets (or other portents) and malign stars.'"5 Earthquakes are a real and ever-present threat in China. In premodern times, they were linked to astrological phe nomena.6 A major earthquake struck the Guangshengsi area in 1303, and a stele commemorating extensive repairs on the Mingyingwang Hall in the Water God Temple (Shuishen Miao) at Guangshengsi Xiasi records that "everything was destroyed."

Mingyingwang Hall, is Daoist; the eastern compound, enclosing the main and front halls, is Buddhist (Fig. 2). Many scholars have been inclined to date the Buddhist main hall and its murals after 1303, assuming that the painting of Tejaprabha was an apotropaic offering and invocation designed to avert further natural disasters. A recently published study makes a solid case, however, that stylistically the murals of the main hall predate the 1303 quake.7 If that is so, what inspired the commission? A fortuitous discovery in the famous S?kyamuni Pagoda (Fig. j) at Fogongsi in Ying xian, northern Shanxi, may point to the answer. In 1974, in a vertical cavity inside a clay sculpture of S?kyamuni (Fig. 4) on the fourth floor of the eleventh-century S?kyamuni Pagoda,8 a preservation team discovered a magnificent hand-colored woodblock print of the Tejaprabha Buddha Subduing the Nine Luminaries (Fig. 5).9The choice of position for this print has provided new awareness of and insights into other powers of Tejaprabha that made him an apt icon for Guangshengsi Xiasi in the last decades of the thirteenth century In this article I will first examine the print s his 8 Fig. 3.

Although the print is only a small fraction of the size of the mural, in composition the two scenes are alike.10 In the center is Tejaprabha, holding a golden wheel and sit ting on a lotus throne surrounded by deities. The print shows the Nine Luminaries in anthropomorphic form: at viewers right of the Buddha, the Sun Bodhisattva, Mercury, and Jupiter, at viewer's left, the Moon Bodhisattva, Venus, and Mars. Centered in front of the Buddha's throne are Saturn on viewer's right and a crowned female opposite, possibly Dimu, the Earth Mother.11 Flanking these two are the dark stars: Luohou (S: R?hu), the Demon of Eclipses, at lower right, and Jidu (S: Ketu), the personification of comets, at lower left.12 The upper</page><page sequence="3">Fig. 4.

Fragments of two more zodiac signs flank each side of the title cartouche. The upper part of the print, including the upper part of the cartouche, is missing, but in the upper right and left corners swirls of clouds contained at least three standing figures each. In the mural two more Luminaries (Ziqi, who personifies the superfluous vapors of Jupiter, and Yuebo, personification of the superfluous vapors of Saturn), join the Nine.13 In the print the arrangement is clear, but the mural requires diagramming, because the Luminaries and many other regal attendants are attired in so lavish a display of finery as to nearly obscure all but Tejaprabha (Fig. 6). As in the print, the Sun Bodhisattva is to viewer s right of the Buddha, and the Moon to viewer's left; each seated with one leg pendent. In the mural they are slightly smaller than the Buddha but much larger than the rest of the assembly. The five planets have been relegated to the upper left cor Fig. 5.

Ziqi holds his "jade tablet of office," and Yuebo raises his sword16 in salute to the Buddha. The same theme is depicted in print and mural, but far more elaborately in the latter. This difference is partly owing to the mural's much greater size, but also reflects its later date. The print's technique and paper indicate that it was made in Beijing about the year 1000.17 The purpose of placing this print of Tejaprabha Subduing the Nine Luminaries inside a sculpture of S?kyamuni in the pagoda was, I believe, twofold: to assist in the apotheosis of the Liao emperor Xingzong (r. 1031 1055), and to insure the protection of a major cache of s?tras that the monks had placed in the sculpture with the print. The historical circumstances and the symbolism of the print's placement support these assertions. Preservation teams discovered the invaluable cache of s?tras in 1974 in a large cavity in a wooden "central pillar" (C: zhong zhu) inside the torso of the fourth-floor S?kyamuni (Fig. 7).18 At the position of the heart was a concavity (ao cao)19 especially designed to hold a lotus shaped silver box containing a set of seven treasures20 and precious relics.21 Below it were Liao s?tras, paintings, and prints.22 The print of Tejaprabha lay in the chest area. The materials in the vertical cavity were neatly organized and had lain undisturbed since the central pillar was wrapped with cord to seal and preserve the cache.23 Most of the sculptures in the pagoda date from the end of the eleventh century, that is, some decades after 1056, when the pagoda was commissioned.24 But because the sculptural m?ndala in the vertical central core of the pago 10 da fits perfectly into the spaces reserved for it on the five main floors, the patrons must have conceived the m?ndala at the same time as the pagoda and as an integral part of it (Fig 8).25 In the central core of the pagoda, here occupied by the sculptural scheme, one more commonly finds the "heart" pillar that runs from the top to the bottom; besides joining heaven and earth, the pillar also represents Vairocana, and has a multitude of other symbolic func tions.26 At the S?kyamuni Pagoda, the symbolism of the sculptural m?ndala corresponds in many respects to that of the heart pillar. On the first, second, and fourth floors is S?kyamuni, on the third, the Buddhas of the Four Directions, and on the fifth, Vairocana. In the pillars of many pagodas, cavities filled with treasures are sited most often at the base (digong), at the midpoint (zhonggong), and at the top below the mast (tiangong). Pagodas vary enor mously in the number and location of the heart pillar cav ities, but at the S?kyamuni Pagoda, the cavity in the fourth-floor S?kyamuni Buddha is at the heart of the heart of the pagoda; this position is comparable to a zhonggong, a "central palace." Why the Liao chose to put an image of Tejaprabha Subduing the Nine Luminaries into this most sacred spot of the pagoda is doubtless related to a celestial event of August 1054, the "giant stellar explosion," recorded by Liao and Song astronomers, that resulted in the formation known as the Crab Nebula.27 Immediately following the notice of this "guest star," the Qidan guozhi records the death of Liao Emperor Xingzong and states that the "star" portended his death.28 In discussing why the Liao built this pagoda in 1056, Nancy Steinhardt observes that Emperor Xingzong was raised in Ying xian, the home of his foster mother, and suggests that his son and successor, Daozong (r.1055-1101), ordered the pagoda constructed there to commemorate his father the year after his death. Steinhardt also explores the symbolic equivalence between the S?kyamuni images in the pagoda and the emperor Xingzong.29 On the fifth floor of the pagoda, Vairocana is the central image.

S?kyamuni and Vairocana is explicit, and the identification of Xingzong with Vairocana is implicit.30 As the Buddha who subdues the Luminaries,Tejaprabha also can manifest his power over (or in) such phenomena as the 1054 super nova. The image of Tejaprabha literally links the superno va and Xingzong together in the heart of the pagoda. Of all the Buddhas, Tejaprabha is probably the one most easily equated with the person and power of an emperor, because the golden wheel that he holds signifies that he is the Golden-Wheel Cakravartin,31 ruler of the four conti nents which extend in the four cardinal directions around the Buddhist World Mountain, Mt. Meru.32 A pagoda, fur thermore, is a symbol of Mt. Meru and all its cosmic power. The symbols here of correspondences between the state and the cosmos, between the emperor and the Buddhas S?kyamuni, Vairocana, the Buddhas of the Four Directions and ultimately Tejaprabha could hardly be more specific. If symbolic imagery can be effective, the apotheosis of Xingzong was virtually assured. What of the second purpose in including the Buddha of Blazing Light in the sculptural m?ndala?the purpose of protecting the major cache of s?tras found with the print? The pagoda is a powerful emblem of stability by virtue of its mast, which pierces the dome and the umbrellas and symbolizes the vajra spike with which Indra fixed the World Mountain at the beginning of the world.33 What better protection against earthquakes, the ultimate in instability? Even better than a pagoda would be a pagoda with Tejaprabha?averter of calamities?at its core. Better yet to include Ma?jusr?, guardian of all Mah?y?na doc trine, at his side. In Tejaprabha s?tras Ma?jusr? "plays a fun damental role as interlocutor and revealer."34 Ma?jusr? appears three times in the sculptural scheme in the central core of the pagoda. On the fourth floor35 Ma?jusr? mounted on his lion together with Samantabhadra on his elephant attend and protect the S?kyamuni; until 1974 they likewise protected S?kyamuni's sacred deposit: the print of the Buddha of Blazing Light and the treasure of scriptures. Ma?jusr? also attends the S?kyamuni on the second floor and is one of the Eight Great Bodhisattvas36 who encircle the Vairocana on the fifth floor. This fifth-floor Ma?jusr? has its hair done up in five knots, symbolizing the five kinds of wisdom possessed by Ma?jusr?. The five-knot coiffure is a link to the five 11</page><page sequence="6">peaks of Wutaishan, legendary locus of Ma?jusr?'s paradise and cult center and pilgrimage site for the worship of the bodhisattva.37 That famous site lies just south of Ying xian. Tejaprabha s link to Ma?jusr? and Wutaishan is per haps best known from another of the rare representations ofTejaprabha in Chinese art. He appears on the wall of the entryway to Dunhuang Cave 61, which is famous for its tenth-century mural depicting the temples and terrain of Wutaishan. Guangshengsi is south of Wutaishan, in southern Shanxis temple-rich Fen River valley. In the Maitreya Hall of Guangshengsi Shangsi, the Eighth-Route Army in 1933 discovered the famous Jin Tripitaka, which Khubilai Khan (r. 1260-1294) presented to the temple.38 Those hoping to protect the temple and the s?tras from earthquakes, like their counterparts in Ying xian, might be expected to invoke the stabilizing powers ofTejaprabha. Patrons of Guangshengsi Xiasi invoked him twice. Not only did his assembly grace the main hall, but he also is the subject of one of the front hall murals. Although the recorded earthquake of 1303 may well have postdated the Tejaprabha mural in the main hall, it was quite probably a major factor in the choice ofTejaprabha for the front hall. Having proved his efficacy when the main hall withstood the quake,39 Tejaprabha was a logical choice for the front hall when it was reconstructed in the late fifteenth centu ry.40 The high quality and opulence of the two murals from the main hall (now in the Nelson-Atkins Museum and the Metropolitan Museum of Art) suggest that a major event inspired their commission. In the history of the monastery during the thirteenth century, Khubilais gift of the Tripitaka certainly qualifies as such an event. The 1319 stele recording repairs on the Mingyingwang Hall records also that "a portrait of the emperor [Shizu, Khubilai s posthu mous name]..., and the s?tra(s) given by the emperor all [were] placed here in order to prepare a fitting place to invoke long years for the emperor and the nation."41 The Tripitaka was donated, then, between 1260 and 1294, dur ing Khubilai s reign. Dubbed the Zhaocheng version (after the city of Zhaocheng, which is forty // northwest of Guangshengsi), the Jin Tripitaka is of inestimable importance and has just been published in 106 volumes. Its survival at Guangshengsi is further evidence that the 1303 earth quake did not wreak total destruction. Laurence Sickman wrote in 1937, "The earthquake could not have been so severe as described?destroying everything. As a matter of fact the s?tras 'given by the emperor' are undoubtedly the ones [just discovered] at the temple... ,"42 Not only could Tejaprahba protect the s?tras; as the Golden-Wheel Cakravartin, the ruler of the four continents which lie in the four cardinal directions around Mt. Meru, he could be 12 equated with, as well as honor and exalt the emperor, Khubilai Khan. Two of the Luminaries in the mural, Ziqi and Yuebo, aid particularly in understanding the full import of the monastery's choice of Tejaprabha to honor and exalt Khubilai. Soper notes that in an important iconographie cartoon of 1164, Ziqi is a "typical Chinese courtier grasp ing his jade tablet of office" and that Yuebo also appears more Chinese than the "ominous, demon-like" dark stars, Luohou and Jidu. Soper concludes that "the contrast rein forces the probability that the two newcomers were Chinese in origin and as much Taoist as Buddhist."43 The original Nine Luminaries themselves appear far more often in Daoist contexts than in Buddhist,44 and Wai-kam Ho has advised that in any analysis of the painting its Daoist content must be considered of paramount impor tance.45 Daoist deities in attendance on a Buddha are especially appropriate at Guangshengsi, where the Xiasi (Lower Monastery) includes a Daoist compound. The Huo mountains and spring form a beautiful setting for the monastery, where Mingyingwang, the deity enshrined in the main hall of the Daoist compound, "may best be con sidered as the benign spirit of both the mountain and the spring."46 Judging from an inscription at the site, Laurence Sickman concluded that the deity "is looked upon as a form of the Dragon King" and that the four sculptured attendants on his shrine and in the wall paintings of him there "may represent the Four Dragon Kings of the four seas which encompass the earth." 47 Such an iconograph ie scheme is a fitting complement to the Tejaprabha as ruler of the four continents. The restored (post-1303 quake) Mingyingwang Hall dates at least from 1316, the earliest date found in inscriptions there. The hall's icono graphie scheme could well have been inspired by the choice of Tejaprabha for the Buddhist main hall. Or, assuming that the restoration kept to the iconographie program of the destroyed original, the latter may have fig ured in the choice ofTejaprabha for the Buddhist hall. But what has all this emphasis on Daoism in a Buddhist context to do with honoring Khubilai on the occasion of his gift of the Tripitaka to the monastery? In 1258, during Khubilai's rise to power, there occurred an event impor tant for interpretation of the Daoist context and content of the mural. Although not enthroned until 1260, Khubilai had been gaining power from 1251, when his brother M?ngke took the throne. In 1258 Khubilai, at the behest of M?ngke, presided over a Buddhist/Daoist disputa tion,48 which Khubilai convened in an effort to defuse a "religious conflict between Buddhists and Daoists that had escalated into pitched battles and the destruction of tem ples and monasteries."49 Two deities (Tejaprabha and Ziqi) in the mural can be linked specifically to that disputation and its outcome. Ziqi</page><page sequence="7">is a portent of the appearance of emperors, sages, or treas ure. When Laozi was travelling west, for instance, the guard at the gate saw Ziqi floating above just before Laozi s arrival, riding on a green ox, on his way west.50 In the 1258 disputation Laozi s journey to the west was crucial to the Daoists' argument that Daoism was the superior reli gion. They contended that Buddha was simply Laozi who had journeyed to India, transformed himself into the Buddha, and preached Buddhism. Buddhism was, they argued, "simply a vulgarized form of Taoism that Laotzu developed in order to appeal to the less sophisticated peo ple of India."51 The Tibetan Buddhist monk 'Phags-pa lama (1235 1280) distinguished himself at the disputation by discred iting the Daoist texts relating Laozi's trip to India. Khubilai decided in favor of the Buddhists; still, he did not therefore proscribe Daoism, but continued to seek Daoists' advice and support.52 In this mural exalting Khubilai, then, Ziqi would be especially meaningful, for he not only portended the appearance of an emperor but was a champion of the Daoist cause. Immediately on becom ing emperor, Khubilai appointed the Tibetan monk 'Phags-pa lama supreme chief of the Buddhist clergy.53 'Phags-pa lama, in return, "identified Khubilai with Ma?jusr? and also portrayed him as the Universal Cakravartin."54 Tejaprabha, the Cakravartin holding the Golden Wheel, "the ideal king who rules the world with the wheel (cakra) which he spontaneously obtains at the time of enthronement,"55 was the perfect figure for exalt ing Khubilai at Guangshengsi. Because of Ma?ju?ri s importance in the Tejaprabha s?tras and because 'Phags-pa lama identified Khubilai with Ma?jusr?, one would expect Ma?jusr? to be included in the iconographie scheme of the main hall of the Lower Monastery. He may be present in the companion mural (now at the Metropolitan). The identity of the Buddha in that mural is a matter of continuing debate.56 Six Buddhas hover above the main Buddha. It is uncertain whether the main Buddha is S?kyamuni as one of the Seven Buddhas of the Past or Bhaisajyaguru as one of the Seven Buddhas of Healing.57 The discovery of the Tejaprabha print inside the S?kyamuni at the S?kyamuni Pagoda heightens the possibil ity that the companion mural from the main hall represents S?kyamuni, flanked by his accustomed attendants Ma?jusr? and Samantabhadra. Another monument from the Liao period, the Seven Buddha Hall of 1020 at Fengguosi,Yi xian, Liaoning, also lends weight to the possibility that the Guangshengsi Xiasi main hall's companion mural shows S?kyamuni as one of the Seven Buddhas of the Past. Recent scholarship has presented a good case that the Seven Buddha theme in the Liao hall honored the reigning Liao emperor Shengzong (r. 982-1031), and likened him to S?kyamuni.58 The Seven Buddhas of the Past would func tion well in the Guangshengsi Xiasi main hall to glorify Khubilai through time as well as space. And if the mural depicts the Seven Buddhas of the Past, then the main figure must be S?kyamuni, and in that case the attendants flanking the main figure are almost certain to be Ma?jusr? and Samantabhadra. CONCLUSION Study of the historical context and function of the Tejaprabha print found inside the fourth-floor S?kyamuni sculpture at the S?kyamuni Pagoda has increased our understanding of the powers and purpose ofTejaprabha Buddha. There he was entrusted with protecting the treas ury of s?tras secreted within the sculpture in a cavity that corresponds physically to a pagoda's "central palace." Ma?jusr? s major role in the Tejaprabha s?tras and in pro tecting the Mah?y?na doctrines, the three images of Ma?jusr? in the pagoda's sculptural m?ndala, and the spe cific iconography of the five-knot coiffure on two of those images, all serve to underscore the proximity of this pago da and this image of Tejaprahba to Ma?jusr? 's mountain paradise and cult center at Wutaishan in Shanxi. That Tejaprabha was also placed in the pagoda to insure the apotheosis of the Liao emperor Xingzong is strongly sug gested by the chronology of events: the supernova of 1054, the death of Xingzong in 1055, and Daozong's conception of the 1056 pagoda as a monument to his father. As at the pagoda, Tejaprabha at the Guangshengsi suc ceeded in protecting a major treasury of scriptures entrusted to his care, the Jin Tripitaka. As at the pagoda, Tejaprabha as the Golden-Wheel Cakravartin was invoked as the spiritual counterpart to the emperor, this time to honor and exalt Khubilai Khan. The Luminaries under score the Daoist presence at Guangshengsi and the out come of the 1258 disputation. The deity who reigns supreme in this mural, however, is Buddha Tejaprabha, the Golden-Wheel Cakravartin and subduer of Daoist deities, the heavenly counterpart of Khubilai Khan. Examination of images ofTejaprabha in Shanxi has illu minated much about the historical context and meaning of two major monuments, one dating from the eleventh century and one from the thirteenth. The Buddha of Blazing Light is not likely to disappoint those who con tinue to explore the symbolism of his paradise. 13</page><page sequence="8">Characters ao cao \Hj&gt;ft Chishengguang j^St^t Daozong iS.^ digong J&amp;lT Dimu It-* Dunhuang ^:it en ci ??

Two more prints of Tejaprabha's paradise were found in the core of a pagoda in Ningxia.

H</page><page sequence="9">19- This terminology is highly connotative. Cao, literally "trough," describes a space enclosed by pillars; here the cao lies within the "cen tral pillar." For analysis of the term cao, see Steinhardt, Liao Architecture, pp. 71-73. According to Steinhardt, ucao construction [is] the only ground plan employed in Liao religious architecture." 20. Contents of the seven-treasure sets are somewhat variable, but usually include precious metals and jewels. See William E. Soothill and Lewis Hodous, A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms (London: Kegan Paul,Trench,Trubner, 1937), p. 12.The seven treasures in the Muta lotus box are objects made of amber, gold, bronze, silver, crystal, wood, and clay. See Ying xian muta Liaodai mizang, p. 19 and cpl. 19. 21. Contents of the vertical cavity in the central pillar were undis turbed, but the ao cao had been damaged and the contents removed. In 1966 the silver box with the seven treasures inside was found under the third-floor Buddha. Because the box fit perfectly into the ao cao, the preservation team determined that it came from there. See "Valuable Cultural Relics," p. 2. 22. This cache is the first evidence that the Liao engaged in the prac tice of depositing s?tras and relics into sculptures (Muta mizang, p. 19). Authors of the monograph believe the deposits were deliberately arranged to emphasize the relics as a symbol of the heart, and the s?tras and commentary as symbols of the other organs (p. 20). In the tenth-cen tury Seiry?ji Buddha, the organs were represented by cloth replicas; it may be too facile to assert on the basis of position alone that these s?tras were meant to symbolize organs, but they were clearly sacred deposits. 23. The latest dated scrolls and the evidence of Carbon 14 tests indi cate that the contents were sealed up in the last years of the Liao dynasty, about ino-ii25.The deposits in the horizontal cavity in the knees were more miscellaneous and less carefully arranged, suggesting that they had been put there hurriedly, perhaps as Ying xian was being sacked (Muta mizang, p. 20). 24.

A Chinese appellation for Tejaprabha is Jinlun foding, "Golden Wheel Essence Body."

It is actually a nine-storied pagoda because four mezzanine lev els separate the five main floors (see Steinhardt, "Liao," p. 13). See also Snodgrass, Symbolism of the Stupa, p. 242, for an analysis of the corre spondence between nine-storied pagodas and the Nine Luminaries. 36. Different groups of eight are named in various s?tras. Manjusri is among the eight depicted on the base of the stone s?tra pillar dated to 1044 from the digong of the North Pagoda at Chaoyang, Liaoning (Chaoyang beita kaogu kancha dui, "Liaoning Chaoyang beita tiangong digong qingli jianbao" ["Brief Report on the Clearing Up of the Tiangong and Digong of the North Pagoda, Chaoyang County, Liaoning"], Wenwu [July 1992], p.18, fig. 41). 37. The five-knot coiffure is rare in Chinese images of Manjusri but not surprising in an image so close to Wutaishan. In an early photo graph, the second-floor Ma?jus'ri wore the identical coiffure: knotted at front, crown, back, and both sides.

Without access to the Chinese text, one might suppose that the emper or for whom "long years" are invoked is Renzong, not Shizu. Renzong, however, is nowhere else mentioned; furthermore, Shizu is the only emperor specifically referred to in this passage, and the only referent for the phrase "the s?tra given by the emperor" (en ci, "imperially bestowed"). 42 Sickman also comments here that "one of the halls, at least, at the Upper Temple, appears to be of Sung or Chin date" ("Wall-Paintings," P- 59). 43.

Aschwin Lippe, "Buddha and the Holy Multitude," Metropolitan Museum Bulletin, vol. 23 (May 1965), pp. 334-36, tentatively identifies the Buddha as Maitreya. Anning Jing argues for an identification of the Buddha as Bhaisajyaguru in "The Yuan Buddhist Mural of the Paradise of Bhaisajyaguru," Metropolitan Museum Journal, vol. 26 (1991), pp. 148 55. For a useful summary of the iconographies Lippe and Jing propose, see Baldwin, pp. 247-50. 57. In Indian temple contexts, the Seven Buddhas of the Past are linked with planetary deities in purpose and position. Stephen Markel notes that the Seven Buddhas of the Past appear as protectors on the lintels of Kushan- and Gupta-period temples. He believes that in that role the Buddhas were an artistic precedent for and "analogous to the later representations of the planetary deities" on the lintels.
