<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. By HENRY FIELD AND EUGENE PROSTOV INTRODUCTION T HIS report supplements four previous articles on this subject, two by the writers' and one each by E. Golomshtok2 and A. Zolotarev,3 which have appeared in the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. In addition to our articles in this journal, we have published other brief summaries4 of archaeological research within the territory of the Soviet Union. The material treated here is arranged under the following geographic headings: Georgia, Abkhazia, Daghestan, North Caucasus, Ukraine, European Russia, Turkestan, and Siberia. Maps of archaeological sites in Transcaucasia, Ukraine, and Turkestan were published in our 1936 report in the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, and a map of Central Asia showing the sites in the Uzbek, Tadzhik, Kirghiz, and Turkoman S.S.R's appeared in the cited article published in Ars Islamica. These maps were drawn at Field Museum by Richard A. Martin. Soviet literature in the libraries of Field Museum of Natural History and the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago was examined by Eugene Prostov, who selected passages for inclusion and supervised the transliterations and the spelling of place names. Important contributions by A. M. Tallgren,5 Eugene Golomshtok,6 and G. Bonch-Osmolovsky and V. Gromov7 have also appeared in English. 1 Henry Field and Eugene Prostov, Recent Archaeological Investigations in the Soviet Union (Vol. 38, pp. 260-90, 1936); Archaeology in the Soviet Union (Vol. 39, pp. 457-90, 1937). 2 E.

ABKHAZIA9 From 1934-1936 the Abkhazian Expedition'o of IAE, cooperating with AbNIIK (S. N. Zamiatnin, leader), located forty Paleolithic sites within twenty-five kilometers of the coast, thirty-three of the sites being between Tuapse and Ingur. Twenty-three stations contained typologically Mous- terian implements. The ten Acheulean, Clactonian, and Levalloisian sites are the oldest yet discovered in the U.S.S.R. Correlations of these alluvial deposits were made with the sea terraces so that relative chronological sequences could be established on the basis of geological data, typology, patina, degree of wear, mineralogical analyses, etc. Two caves near Adler yielded a cultural sequence from Mousterian to Mesolithic. Three groups of sites were identified: pre-Mousterian (10), Mousterian (23), and Upper Paleolithic (9). The oldest group was not found below the 80-100 meter terrace (IV). The Mousterian implements were usually associated with the 35-40 meter terrace (III). The primitive settlements represented by these sites were located near rivers. The Upper Paleolithic sites are associated with the crests and platforms of the eroded terrace. The general topography differed little from that of the present day. Pre-Mousterian sites. At Kolkhida, near Novye Gagry, surface finds occurred 180 meters above sea level but in the lower horizon. At Kiurdere, near Psyrtskhi (formerly Novyi Afon) on the left bank of the Shitskuara River, homogeneous implements were collected on the surface of the same terrace as at Kolkhida and also in the diluvium. The lower IAshtukh village, three kilometers north of Sukhum, was located on the 80-100 meter terrace (IV). This site was the first Paleolithic station discovered in Ab- khazia.

In Sukhum some rolled implements carried down by the Suk- humka River were collected. Similar isolated finds were made in the modern alluvium of the Sukhumka River and in the Ostroumovskoe gorge near IAshtukh. Byrts Mountain, southeast of IAshtukh, yielded rolled flints on a platform near the peak. On the summit of Gvard Mountain a homo- geneous group of flints of the oldest IAshtukh type was found. On Apiancha Mountain, east of Sukhum near Tsebelda, there were isolated rolled flints in the saddle-shaped hollow between the twin peaks. At Otap, 500 meters from the famous Achkytyzga cave, Lower and Upper Paleolithic flints were collected near a mosque, the former type being very rolled and deeply patinated. At Gali an Acheulean hand-axe from Terrace III was reutilized as a Mousterian nucleus. At Chuburiskhindzhi, on the road to Satandzhio Mountain, in a ditch associated with the preserved portion of Terrace V, a coup-de-poing was found among shiny, deeply patinated, rolled flints. The majority of the implements from these ten sites were crude, broad, massive flakes, of roughly triangular or quandrangular outline, from dis- coidal nuclei. Secondary retouching of flakes and nuclei occurred. Hand- axes were found at Kiurdere, IAshtukh, Gvard, Otap, Gali, and Chuburi- skhindzhi. Comparison with the Mousterian sites of Il'skaia on the Kuban River, of Ochemchiri in Georgia, and of the Crimea revealed that the earliest series of implements from IAshtukh is considerably older." Closest analogies to these coups-de-poing may be seen in the Acheulean types from Clacton and Barnfield Pit in England. Mousterian sites. At Kelasuri implements similar to those from Il'skaia and from Crimean caves were discovered on a platform of Terrace III and in the diluvium of Terrace IV. A perforator, a scraper, and a retouched triangular flake were among implements found at Bogoveshty on Terrace III of.the Pshap River and on the slope of Terrace IV. Near Anastasievka on the right bank of the Kodor River a relatively large series was collected on the surface of Terrace III. Some archaic flints of IAshtukh type and patina were also found. Along the edge of Terrace III, one kilometer from Ochemchiri, points, scrapers, thin triangular laminae with retouched striking platforms, and discoidal nuclei were discovered in stream beds or in situ. The flint was dark red with a yellow-brown patina. These imple- ments and those from Kelasuri established the typological similarity n Pre-Mousterian implements, although also flaked from discoidal nuclei, differ from those of the Mousterian culture in that the former have larger flakes, a very broad striking platform, and dark-red or brown, instead of light, patina. Secondary retouches are rare and are accomplished by means of crude pressure-flaking.</page><page sequence="5">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. 657 between this station, that of II'skaia, and those of the Crimea.

An abundance of nuclei also occurred in Imeretia and in the Crimea. The hand-axes, forming a relatively small percentage of the specimens, were of both advanced and primitive types (fig. 3). At IAshtukh, in addition to hand-axes (fig. 1), there were crude hacking implements with one cutting edge, made from a flint block by rough flaking and retouched with second- ary flaking (fig. 2).

Solov'ev,16 of AbNIIK, discovered several "Eolithic" sites, the most important being near Andreevskoe and Neldorf (Neudorff). At Andreevskoe ashes, charcoal, and numerous wooden implements were found in a stratum of peat. Awls, pins, and other pointed toools predomi- nated. The largest implements included hoes, some of which had braided thongs of vegetable fibers near the pointed end. The same cultural layer yielded animal bones and unretouched flint and limestone implements of "Eolithic" type. From geological evidence this site was attributed to the Mindel glaciation. Many wooden implements, typologically akin to those from Andreev- skoe, were discovered in the neighborhood of Neidorf near Sukhum. No stone implements were found. The tools were well preserved in a stratum of interglacial peat, overlain with thick moraine deposits. Near Tsebelda, human remains, associated with typologically Upper Paleolithic implements, were excavated. Lower Paleolithic tools occurred in a site near Sukhum. DAGHESTAN'I Near the Sulak River a GAIMK Expedition (A. A. Jessen,17 leader) examined many tumuli in the mountains. A site near Tad Shob Mountain was covered with sherds of crude handmade pottery attributed to a period prior to the fifth century A.D.

NORTH CAUCASUS18 1. The Manych Expedition (M. I. Artamonov, leader) excavated three tumuli on the left bank of the Manych River near Khutor Veselogo, in the Rostov-on-Don District. Five Bronze Age and Scytho-Sarmatian burials were uncovered in one tumulus. The principal burial lay in a pit, the upper part of which was filled with reeds, forming a roof over the grave. The skeleton was oriented with its head toward the west and had its legs bent backward. Near the pelvis was a ram's skull and near the sides of the head two metallic half rings. The second tumulus, of lesser size, held eight burials, one containing a dorsally extended skeleton oriented with its head toward the west. Grave furniture included an iron dagger and knife; a filigree bronze buckle with the effigy of a camel; round iron buckles; a pottery brazier containing coals; and two more pottery vessels, one of which was of black lacquered ware attributed to the third century B.C. A Bronze Age burial of the catacomb type included eight skeletons with legs flexed and bearing traces of red ocher. One of the children's skeletons had a pectoral necklace of bone beads and cylinders. At the head and at the feet of the two juvenile skeletons the bones of a calf were found. The third tumulus, the smallest of the group, contained ten burials. One of the Bronze Age burials contained a skeleton with an artificially 18 Among important publications must be included Tretil mezhdunarodny* kongress po iranskomu iskusstvu i arkheologii: Katalog mezhdunarodnol vystazki pamiatnikov iranskogo iskusstva i arkheologii (Vol. 1, Leningrad, Gosudarstvennyl Ermitazh, 1935, 616 pp.). This cata- logue was published as a result of the Third International Congress of Iranian Art and Archae- ology held in Leningrad during 1935. The following Caucasian objects are described: grave inventories from Koban and Kumbulta; treasures from Dzhvari, Mekhchis-Tsikhe, and Kaz- bek; grave inventories from Vornak, Redkin Lager', Archadzor, Toprakh Kale, Armavir, Khalkaberd, and Khodzhali; tumuli of Ul', Kelermes, Malkop, Bol'shaia Tsarskaia, Elizave- tinskaia, and Anapa; burial grounds of Kzyl Vank, Tazakend, IAlollu-Tepe, Nakhichevan, and Elizavetinskaia; treasure from Migulinskaia and Bori; architectural fragments from Garki; gold ornaments from Ashnak; grave inventories from Kamunta, Mtskhet, and Rutkha; an- tiquities from Baku, Svanetia, and Daghestan; carved stones from Kubachi; frescoes and pot- tery from Ani; and many objects of indefinite provenance.</page><page sequence="10">662 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 deformed skull.19 This is the third example of artificial cranial deformation seen in the Bronze Age sites in Manych. 2. The North Caucasian Expedition of IIMK (M. I. Artamonov, leader) conducted a large campaign of archaeological excavations in the eastern part of the North Caucasus, in the Chechen territory, and in Daghestan. The iterinerary of the expedition was as follows: Groznyl, Vedeno, Kharachol, Andi, Botlikh, Khunzakh, Khodzhan-Makhi. The vicinity of Buinaksk (formerly Temir Khan Shura) was also investigated. The majority of the monuments belonged to the pre-Moslem Middle Ages. Most typical were burials in stone boxes with walls of smaller stones and covered by slate slabs. The inventory was fairly poor, consisting of pottery, a few ornaments, beads, necklaces, rings, and bracelets. Similar burial grounds were found near Orta-Kolo, Shadroda, and Nakitl'. Christ- ian antiquities were also discovered in this area. An ancient church sur- rounded by the ruins of a settlement was found near Datun and another near Khunzakh. Earlier monuments were relatively scarce. A Bronze Age burial ground was discovered on a mountain crossing near Gagatl'. The flexed burials in stone boxes were enclosed in cromlechs. The inventory included oblong temple rings of bronze wire. Among the most interesting monuments were the ancient sepulchers near Kharachol, in the Checheno-Ingush A.S.S.R., and the sanctuary near Karata, in Daghestan. The sepulchers may be dated at the end of the Bronze Age, the beginning of the first millennium B.C. Twenty-two burials were opened at Kharachol. All the skeletons were in slate or sandstone boxes' and were flexed. Pottery, copper bracelets, large temple rings, and beads and pendants of copper, antimony, and paste were excavated. The second burial ground, near Isti-Su, belongs to the middle of the first millennium B.C. and has many traits in common with burials of the Scythian steppes and the mountainous areas of the Caucasus. The skeletons, either flexed or dorsally extended, were accompanied by pottery, iron spear points and knives, and ornaments. Of particular interest were a large copper buckle with engraved images of dogs and several copper fibulae of Koban type. 19 On September 24, 1934, in the Ossetian Museum at Ordzhonikidze, formerly Vladi- kavkaz, I measured nineteen deformed skulls from a site near Nal'chik. According to A. Kharuzin artificial cranial deformation was practised among certain families in restricted areas of Transcaucasia during the tenth century B.C., after invasions from Central Asia. According to one authority these skulls from Nal'chik were found in eleventh or twelfth century tombs (H.F.).</page><page sequence="11">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. 663 The sanctuary in the Kulatl' area near Karata probably belongs to the same period. Here, at the summit of the mountain, a cartographic expedi- tion found a bronze human figurine and a bronze effigy of a goat. Arta- monov excavated at the spot where these bronzes were found and unearthed an iron trident and another bronze human figurine. These figurines, both male, were totally different in treatment from similar objects discovered in the Caucasus. A bronze female effigy was found on a mountain peak sanctuary near Sogratl' in Daghestan. Small-scale excavations were con- ducted at the group of tumuli near Alkhan Kala on the Sundzha River. A large gorodischche yielding inventory of the first centuries A.D. had been discovered here in 1936. The group of tumuli nearby was also at- tributed to the same period. In order to discover the chronological relation- ship of the two sites the 1937 expedition studied five low tumuli containing narrow burial pits, each with an opening leading into a mortuary chamber. The chambers were fairly large and very carefully finished; in some cases they had vaulted ceilings reminiscent of Gothic architecture. Each burial had been robbed in ancient times, but there were small flat pieces of gold pierced for sewing on textiles, gold beads, gold pendants set with colored stones, cut carnelian beads of excellent workmanship, a paste Egyptian scarab, bronze fibulae, and pottery. These objects may be attributed to the second or third century A.D., completely corresponding with the dating of the gorodishche. A burial ground near KaranaI village in Daghestan was found to belong to the fifth or sixth century A.D. Three subterranean stone vaults, one of which contained a human skeleton accompanied by two complete skeletons of horses, were unearthed. Near Duba IUrt on the Argun River eight catacomb burials were excavated. Each catacomb contained from two to six burials. The inven- tory consisted of beads, pendants, bracelets, mirrors, rings, elaborate belt sets, and iron axes, knives, and pottery. This burial ground has many traits in common with the other catacombs of the North Caucasus and belongs to the latest period of their existence (ninth and tenth centu- ries A.D.). The expedition also explored the vicinity of Derbent, particularly Dagh Bary ("Mountain Wall"), which extends west from the citadel of Derbent toward the Kara Surt range. The ancient fortifications of Derbent were studied, and the presence of six distinct building techniques belonging to different historical periods was noted. It was discovered that "Mountain Wall" consisted for the most part of separate square forts, with towers on their four corners at points offering the least natural resistance to the advance of the invaders. These forts, as well as the long walls cutting across the valleys, were built</page><page sequence="12">664 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 40, 1938 with the same type of masonry as the most ancient part of the fortifications of Derbent. 3. A second North Caucasian expedition (E. I. Krupnov, of IIMK, leader) from the Historical Museum, distinct from the North Caucasian Expedition of IIMK, operated in Northern Ossetia and in the Ingush area. Excavations were begun in the Upper Rutkha burial ground near Kernbul'ta, which heretofore had been known mainly as a monument of the early Middle Ages (fifth and sixth centuries A.D.). Many bronze objects and pottery of the Koban culture (first millennium B.C.) came to light. Nine massive ornamented bronze bracelets and a belt buckle of Koban type were unearthed. At the same site a robbed burial, the inventory of which included a Koban pin and belt buckle and sixteen Scythian three-finned arrows of the fifth or fourth century B.C., was uncovered. 4. During 1937 the Il'skaia Expedition of IIMK (V. A. Gorodtsov, leader) worked in the Kuban area. Excavations were completed at the site of a communal eating platform, where animal carcasses had been dismem- bered and the flesh cooked on a stone hearth. Many shattered bones of some extremely young mammoths and the bones of a gigantic deer and of Cervus elaphus, Bos bonasus, Equus sp., Hyaena sp., etc. were found. The remains of small birds and fragments of wood were also excavated. The few flint implements and flakes included several typical Solutrean forms. Bone implements, including a large pickaxe fragment, were discovered. In 1936 a dolomite ring used on a digging stick was found. These finds indicate that the inhabitants gathered plants with edible roots. A Magdalenian horizon, contemporaneous with the diluvial deposits of the last Wiirm glaciation, yielded a hearth, the shattered bones of animals, and stone implements including typical Magdalenian laminated flint and jasper and microlithic discoidal scrapers. These late Paleolithic forms were associated with extremely primitive types of dolomite burins, similar to those from Mousterian deposits. 5. The GAIMK Metals Commission, organized by A. A. Jessen,20 reported that two foci of ancient gold production in the North Caucasus21 were discovered on the basis of archaeological and historical evidence in Northern Ossetia and in the upper course of the Belaia and Laba Rivers. 20 A.

UKRAINE 1. During 1937 the Kostenki Borshevo Expedition (P. P. Efimenko, leader) continued excavations at two Paleolithic sites in the Gremiachinski' region of the Voronezh Oblast. On the Telman Collective Farm a semi- dugout (5.5 meters in diameter and 0.5-0.7 meters deep) contained bones, flint and bone tools, ashes, and charcoal. Bones of Elephas primigenius filled one pit. Laurel-leaf spear points and implements manufactured from broad laminae and flakes were reminiscent of Mousterian scrapers. Efi- menko therefore considered Telman the oldest Upper Paleolithic site in the Kostenki-Borshevo region. The presence of typologically Solutrean implements changes the prevailing idea of the absence of Solutrean sites in eastern Europe. This is the first typically Solutrean deposit found in the U.S.S.R. Similar sites occur in southern France and in Spain. The second site, known since 1927 as Kostenki IV (Aleksandrovskaia), is attributed to the Lower Magdalenian period. Under a thick stratum of black loess-like soil three separate dwellings, the largest measuring 14.5 by 6.0 meters, were excavated. In each house were found three or four hearth pits, located equidistantly in a straight line through the long axis. These dwellings differ from those at Telman in being built above the ground; they are typical for a later stage of the Paleolithic period. 2. The Desna Expedition (M. V. Voevodskii, leader) worked near Novgorod-Seversk and in the Voronezh Oblast at the Upper Magdalenian site of Chulatovo II, which yielded three hearths, ateliers for the manu- facturing of flint and stone tools, and accumulations of finished implements, blanks, and chips. In 1936 at Novgorod-Seversk large stone implements known as gigantoliths22 were excavated. During 1937 Upper Paleolithic implements were found with bones of Elephas primigenius, Alopex sp., Dicrostonyx sp., etc. Excavations were also continued in 1937 at Pushkari I, attributed to the end of the Aurignacian or the beginning of the Solutrean Period. Points, burins, scrapers, and mammoth bones were unearthed. Seven new sites were located near Pushkari. 3. The Tripolje23 expedition (T. S. Passek, leader) continued work in 22 Cf. gigantoliths found by Karel Absolon at Ondratitz, Moravia, and now in the Mor- avske Zemske Museum, Briinn (Brfio). 23 See B. L.

During 1937 thirteen Tripolje platforms, or dwellings, were excavated, bringing the total to twenty-four. Twenty-one of the dwellings formed a circle, facing toward its center. The remaining three were outside the circle. In the large plat- forms (up to 120 square meters in area) where the remains of pis6 struc- tures with rectangular floor plans. Owing to the good preservation of the platforms excavated during the 1937 campaign, it was possible to deter- mine accurately the building methods used in constructing a Tripolje dwelling and its parts-clay floor, ovens, walls, dais on the inside, partition, entrance, etc. Many bone and horn artifacts were unearthed in the course of the 1937 excavations, together with flint knives, scrapers, arrowheads, and pottery sherds. A few clay figurines were also found. In the center of the settlement between the dwellings several incinerated burials in urns, dated in the early Scythian period, were unearthed. The monuments of the Tripolje culture belong to the Eneolithic period and characterize the settled agrarian population. 4. Excavations at Nikopol (B. N. Grakov, leader) were sponsored by the Lomonosov Museum. Three small tumuli containing catacomb burials with inventories typical of Scythian tombs of the fourth and third centuries B.C. were completely excavated. One large tumulus (3.75 meters high, 44 meters in diameter) was partially excavated. The mortuary customs indicate a funeral feast, suggestive of the literary tradition regarding Scythian funerals. The small tumuli represented the ordinary burials of nomadic Scyths. The cross section of a large tumulus disclosed a triple structure-three cones concentrically placed, one inside the other. The innermost (the most ancient) and the intermediate cone contained flexed, dorsally extended skeletons with raised knees, surrounded by quantities of red ocher. Burials of a much later date, containing some slightly flexed and some straight skeletons, were found near the surface. On the shore of the Dnieper opposite Nikopol the dune areas of Vod- ianskie Kuchugury and Kamenskie Kuchugury were explored. These areas were inhabited from the Neolithic period until the time of the Zaporozhe Cossacks (sixteenth to eighteenth century). Most numerous and important were the finds of the Bronze Age and of the Scythian period. The remains of a fourth or fifth century graveyard were also located on the upper part of the Vodianskie Kuchugury dune. 24 For recent work at Kiev see Sovietland, p. 38, March, 1938.</page><page sequence="15">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. 667 EUROPEAN RUSSIAM 1. The Karelian Expedition (V. I. Ravdonikas, leader) continued excavation of the only Neolithic burial ground in the forest belt of the northeastern part of the U.S.S.R., on Olenil Island, Lake Onega, where one hundred burials were opened during 1937. The skeletons, interred in shallow graves, were thickly covered with bright red ocher. Among objects found were implements of flint, slate (schist), sandstone, bone, and horn and pendants and sets of ornaments made from the teeth of wild animals (canines of Ursus sp., incisors of Alces sp. and Castor sp., etc.). Important examples of primitive art included human effigies and an elk's head, carved from bone and horn. Studying the Neolithic cultures of this forest belt A. L. Briusov ex- cavated beside the Modlena River and along the western shore of Lake Charonskoe (Vozha) in the Charozerskil region of the Vologda district. Numerous sites between the lower course of the Modlena and its confluent, the Eloma River, belonging to various periods from the second millennium B.C. down to the early Iron Age, were excavated. The cultural strata were located partly in the sand dunes on the shore of Lake Charon- skoe and partly in the lower strata of peat beds near Pogostischche. The earliest pottery ("pit-and-comb") belonged to the early Neolithic period. In the later sites smooth and "net-ornamented" vessels appeared. 2. From 1932-1934 excavations by A. Artsikhovskil and B. Rybakov at Slavna,26 near Novgorod, revealed cultural levels of three periods: seventeenth to twentieth century, fourteenth to seventeenth century, and tenth to fourteenth century. The upper level contained three stages of timber wood in excellent condition. In the middle stratum appeared a complete twelfth century izba, the workshop of a shoemaker. Inside it were found numerous fragments of leather and shoes and evidence of tanning, skin dressing, and hemp oil extraction. The chronicles of Novgorod mention that a rampart was leveled at this spot in the year 1335. In the lower stratum the objects unearthed were characteristic of ancient Russia. Among the more important were colored glass bracelets of the eleventh or twelfth century, cramp irons for use on ice, a thirteenth 25 See Eugene A.

In 'the Barvikha gorodishche,27 twenty-five kilometers west of Moscow, the following finds were made: several iron buckles, of a type well known from eastern Finnish burials and attributed by V. V. Holmsten to the period between the third and seventh centuries of our era; gilded glass beads, supposedly imported from the Greek colonies on the Black Sea; a small, pyramidal bronze bell, of "Gothic style" and of a type known from the Mezhigorod treasure near Kiev (fourth or fifth century); and four groups of pottery. The pottery is classified as follows: Group A. Handmade, imperfectly fired, cylindrical jars, made of a mixture of clay and gravel and decorated with string and other stamp orna- ments. Group B. Handmade, "net ornamented," dark gray, medium-fired jars, with impressions of coarse cloth, a pinched design, and openings on the neck. This pottery is typical for the lower level of gorodishche's, of Diakovo culture. Group C. Smooth, medium-fired, undecorated, bomb-shaped pots, with an admixture of coarse sand in the slip. Group D. Wheel-made, well-fired, black, polished, undecorated ware, typical for the higher levels of the Diakovo culture. Bones of domestic animals included those of Equus, Bos, Sus, Ovis, and Canis; of wild animals, Alces and Ursus. 4. The Western Volga Expedition (P. P. Efimenko,28 leader) examined the culturally homogeneous cemeteries in the central part of the Oka River and at Kuzminskoe, Borkhovo, Shatrishchi, and Gaverdovskoe in Riazan territory. Efimenko classifies the findings in the following chrono- logical sequence: Stage A. The period from the end of the first to the beginning of the third century A.D. is represented in the earliest burials of Koshibaevo, Sergachi, and Shatrishchi. Inventory of Sarmatian type, known from Kuban tumuli, and occasional finds associated with the P'ianobor culture of the Kama River are present. Stage B. The third and fourth centuries are represented at Koshibaevo, 27 L. A. Evtiukhova, Barvikhinskoe Gorodishche (Sovetskaia Arkheologiia, No. 111, 1937, pp. 113-25). 28 P. P.

Imported articles, such as belt-buckles and fibulah, are typical. Stage C. The fifth century is characterized by massive, sometimes silver, cruciform fibulae and women's ornaments of a distinct type. Stage D. For the sixth and the first half of the seventh century, bracelets, armlets, and pectoral ornaments are typical. For the first time objects of "Gothic" origin are found in sites of this period; these are mostly fibula with anthropomorphic and animal effigies and belt and bridle sets orna- mented with geometric designs. 5. The Upper Volga Expedition (P. N. Tret'iakov, leader) continued the work begun in 1933. At the mouth of the Nerl' River near Skniatino a large Epipaleolithic site yielded many cultural objects. Also near Skniatino a gorodishche attributed to the first centuries of the Christian era was excavated. A second gorodishche contained a lower stratum, with inventories dated at the middle and the second half of the first millennium B.C. An- other site near the mouth of the Medveditsa River, attributed to the first part of the Christian era, yielded a rich inventory and remains of ancient fauna. A gorodishche of the same period was investigated above the mouth of the river. Excavation begun in 1935 on a gorodishche near Gorodishche village in the neighborhood of Kaliazin was continued. This site had been inhabited between the middle of the first millennium B.C. and the third or fourth century A.D. Animal bones and bone artifacts were well preserved. Another gorodishche, with a thin cultural stratum, was excavated near Dereven'ka, above Uglich. Fifteen eleventh to twelfth century tumuli in a burial group near the mouth of the Grekhov Ruchel above Uglich were studied. At the present time all archaeological monuments along the Volga between Kalinin and Yaroslavl have been recorded and examined. 6. During 1930, under the direction of E. Goriunova,29 the cemeteries of Choibulak and Aksarkino, near Ioshkar-Ola in the Mari A.S.S.R., were excavated. These two cemeteries date from the seventeenth or possibly the beginning of the eighteenth century. A female grave contained the head- dress of a young girl in the form of a topknot made of cylindrical, hollow bronze tubes laced around her hair; ornamented flat buckles; silver and bronze bracelets with geometric incised ornaments; and rings with small oval and rhombic escutcheons. This type of ring was found throughout the Volga region during the Bulgar epoch.30 In the male burials the objects 29 E. Goriunova, Sovetskaia Arkheologiia, Vol. 3, 1937, p. 177. ao L.

In a belt were a knife, a tinder box, and a metal buckle. 7. Near Balanovo, in the Chuvash A.S.S.R., O. N. Bader continued excavations at a rich Bronze Age burial ground near Karabar. In period and culture this site is very similar to burials of the so-called Fat'ianovo culture and proves that the latter extended farther east than previous evidence indicated. During 1937 Bader discovered fifty tombs, bringing the total to eighty- seven. The graves were constructed with subterranean chambers, which were not filled in the course of the burials. The position of the male and of the female skeletons was different. Single burials predominated, but some of the burials contained three, four, or five skeletons. Bronze objects, particularly ornaments, were numerous, owing to the proximity of mineral sources. There were many wedge-shaped flint axes. A hundred round- bottomed pots, many miniature vessels, and a toy (a rattle) were excavated. Wooden objects, such as combs, were also found. 8. The Kama3' Expedition (N. A. Prokoshev, leader) operated in three sections. (a) The Levshino section continued excavations begun in 1936 on a Neolithic site at the northern extremity of Lake Griaznoe near the mouth of the Chusovaia River. The remains of four dwellings of semi-dugout type were studied. One or two hearths built at the bottom of each dwelling were encircled with round stone hammers, pickaxes, flint arrowheads, scrapers, and knives. The site is attributed to the first half of the second millen- nium B.C. Excavations at the Kontsegorskoe settlement were completed. The objects found were of the Anan'ino period (end of the first millennium B.C.) A dwelling similar to the long houses of the American Indians was excavated. Interesting finds included anthropomorphic clay figurines. The inhabitants, who practised agriculture, animal husbandry, hunting, and fishing, were also acquainted with metallurgy and with fiber work. al According to A. Zbrueva (Sovetskaia Arkheologiia, Vol. 3, 1937, p. 54), the first domes- ticated animal in the Kama region was the dog, the bones of which were excavated in Neolithic and Bronze Age deposits in the forest zone of western European Russia. In deposits repre- senting the end of the Bronze Age the horse, large and small horned cattle, and the pig were found. The pig had been domesticated in this region, whereas all the other animals appear to have moved northward from the forest zone of western European Russia, where they had already been domesticated at the beginning of the Bronze Age. Zbrueva presents the theory of the possible taming of the reindeer at the end of the Neolithic period, suggested by the number of bones found and by the discovery in the peat bog of Gorbounovo of a bone sledge- beam, which indicates the existence of draft animals.</page><page sequence="19">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. 671 Several other sites were explored and a thousand flint implements col- lected from Levshino and other Neolithic sites. (b) The Chusovaia section completed the excavation, begun in 1932, of a sacrificial shrine in Kamnia Dyrovatogo ("the Cave of the Pierced Stone"), near Pashki. There were 4000 arrowheads, of stone, bone, copper, and iron. Of particular interest were the bone arrowheads with flint inserts. Two pierced silver coins were also found. It was discovered that the accumulation of arrowheads resulted from the shooting of arrows from the shores of the river. The ancient hunters starting on their trips sacrificed arrows by shooting them into the cave. Occasionally coins were tied to the arrows. Bichki cave yielded numerous bones of elk, roe, reindeer, and other animals. Two metal-working molds, silver and bronze pendants of the seventh or eighth century, needles, and awls were found. (c) The Upper Kama section continued excavation of the Rodanovo gorodishche, in the Chermoz region of Sverdlovsk. A dwelling with brick stoves and storage pits was unearthed. The lower stratum was attributed to the ninth or tenth century A.D.; the upper, to the tenth or eleventh century. Among the finds were a carved bone spoon, decorated with heads of animals, and smelting molds, including a form for coining Kufic dirhems. TURKESTAN" The purpose of the GAIMK Expedition, consisting of B. A. Latynin,"3 A. P. Mantsevich, and T. G. Obaldueva, was to record and study the monuments of antiquity in the Naryn Valley threatened by flooding in connection with the building of a hydroelectric station. A large portion of the flooding will occur in the Kyzyl-IAr steppe on the left bank of the river, now sparsely populated by nomadic Kirghiz. An IAE expedition in 1933 disclosed that this almost uninhabited area was once populated by settled tribes possessed of an ancient culture, which had grown out of an agricultural economy based on artificial irrigation. The entire steppe was found to be covered by groups of medium (40-50 meters in circumference, 6 meters high) and small (10-20 meters in circumference, 0.5-2.0 meters high) tumuli, appearing in three's or four's, each group not farther apart than 300-500 meters. The ruins consisted of mud-brick structures con- 32 A report by the authors on archaeological investigations in Central Asia from 1917- 1937, based on data supplied by M. V. Voevodskil and A. I.

Oblong stone handmills with well-worn working surfaces were often found. Of particular interest on the Kyzyl-IAr steppe were the remains of the irrigation structures. A mud-brick rampart containing several tepe's, probably the remains of auxiliary fortifications, crossed the steppe from the foothills to the river. The rampart separated the steppe into two por- tions. The extent of the ancient irrigated area, later abandoned with the development of direct irrigation from the Naryn River, was mapped. A later stage of culture was represented by the remains on the right bank of the river. Gorodishche No. 1, attributed to the seventh or eighth century A.D., consisted of an extensive rectangular enclosure surrounded by unbaked brick ramparts and was situated on a prominence above the flood area of the right bank, opposite Uch-Kurgan tumulus. The walls (5.5 meters high) were badly obliterated; the ruins of cone-shaped towers remained on the outer side of the rampart, at intervals of fifty meters. An artificial hill, which formed the citadel of the fortification, was 14 meters high. The walls rested upon a stratum (0.3 meters thick) of boulders of the type still used as the foundation for unbaked brick houses in the native villages. The obliterated tepe's within the enclosure indicated that this settlement was built on top of a more ancient site. Gorodishche No. 2 stood one kilometer farther downstream. The pottery types suggest that it belonged to an earlier period than Gorodishche No. 1. Like the latter, it was located on a prominence above the flood area of the river. The ramparts did not include towers. Work was continued on the left bank of the Naryn River at the place where the presence of ancient monuments was first discovered in 1930. This area, which until recent times was largely unirrigated and unculti- vated, was covered by groups of small and medium sized tepe's, a few of which, however, reached an altitude of 15-20 meters. The pottery types of this area are identical with those of Kyzyl-IAr tepe's, suggesting similar cultural development and possible contemporaneity. Two rectangular gorodishche's near Katta-Mugal' village were associ- ated with large tepe's (18-20 meters high). The gorodishche's consisted of mud-brick ramparts which enclosed the hill and, juxtaposing one of the walls, served as a citadel. The pottery of the two was identical and was the same in the enclosure and on the slope of the tepe. It was without a doubt contemporaneous with the typical pottery from the small and medium- sized tepe's of the foothill steppes on both banks of the Naryn River. Two small excavations were made in a medium-sized tepe in which a</page><page sequence="21">AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST, N.

Charred beams buried in the remains of the baked-clay roof indicated that the building had been destroyed by fire. Three vessels were handmade and constructed of a spiral ribbon of clay and retained at their bottoms the usual layer of coarse- grained sand. In form, and probably in purpose, these large storage pots were similar to the modern vessels (khuma) used in Ferghana. The remain- der of the pottery was wheel-made. The rim often had a complicated profile with marked projection. Loess containing very fine sand was used. The firing produced yellow, orange, and orange-red pottery, sharp at the fracture and sonorous. Most of the vessels were stamnos-like pitchers without handles, of medium (25-30 centimeters) and great (40-60 centi- meters) height, with egg-shaped bodies, broad, flat bottoms, and low, everted rims on rather narrow necks. The rims were sometimes pierced with four suspension holes. The surface of these pots was smoothed and sometimes covered with thick orange-red paint. In general the paint was found only on the neck and shoulders of the pots or in two or three broad horizontal bands around the body.34 Small cups (15-25 centimeters in diameter) of excellent finish and faced with red-orange paint inside and out were very frequent. Their bottoms were flat or rounded; the walls were slightly convex, with a sharp separation line between the body and the wide, flaring, straight or slightly concave rim. There were several variants of these drinking vessels, ranging from flat to conical. Approximately a third of the vessels were ornamented, most com- monly by a motif containing angles and spiral whorls made by means of rubbing off the paint before firing, so that the designs were formed by lighter lines of underlying clay. The ornamental areas and spaces between parallel belts were characteristically shaded (hatched); the spaces between the belts were filled with small wavy or zigzag lines surrounding the ele- ments of the ornament. The wavy lines were also used in the grooves of vessels having ruffled walls. Other types of pottery objects included spindle-whorls, some of which were obviously made from broken handles of flat lids belonging to large vessels. Several such lids were found. No metallic objects were discovered at this site. An elongated, arti- ficially flattened boulder was accompanied by two smaller stones, one of which bore traces of prolonged use as a striking implement. A portion of a flat handmill made from a granite boulder, typical for this cultural stage, was also uncovered. 34 On some pots the paint facing was black, owing sometimes to firing conditions but gen- erally to the composition of the facing.</page><page sequence="24">674 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 40, 1938 The vegetable remains imbedded in the mud bricks of the buildings were found to be barley and wheat(?) straw. The lower layer of the tepe yielded samples of a totally different type of pottery, which was also discovered in the Khakulabad gorodishche exca- vated later. Irrigation canals appear to have been of the spring torrent type. Fur- ther study may disclose the heads of these early canals in the foothill areas of the Uch-Kurgan steppe. Ancient handmade pottery was found in the large rectangular gorodishche with towered ramparts near Ellatan, two kilometers east of Khakulabad. The pottery was porous and grayish, with traces of an admixture of vegetable matter, burned in the course of the firing. The surface was covered with a thin, polished, lilac-red wash, with a network of fine cracks. Some specimens retained bands of brownish-red paint. In general characteristics this pottery most closely approached Anau I ware. In the Ferghana area four cultural strata were identified. The lowest, represented by the finds of archaic pottery in the lower level of the Naryn Collective Farm tepe and in the Ellatan gorodishche, parallels the corre- sponding levels at Anau and some of the archaic strata in Iran, which in- dicated the existence of early stages of agriculture and animal husbandry. The second stratum, represented by the majority of the tepe's of the eastern part of the Ferghana Valley; was characterized by well-developed agricul- ture, the result of artificial irrigation depending for its water on the spring overflow of the mountain rivulets and streams. Animal husbandry was also developed, on a small scale; the osteological materials from this stratum contained the bones of Bos taurus, Equus caballus, Capra hircus, and Ovis aries. The bones of the smaller animals predominated. From the 1930 finds of the same period in the earlier strata of the Kul' tepe tumulus, near Khakulabad, a mandibular fragment of Sus (?scrofa) was unearthed. In the third stratum belong large rectangular gorodishche's surrounded by mud-brick walls with towers. Here also belong, no doubt, the upper strata of the larger tepe's of the preceding period, utilized in this period as sites for the fortified feudal castles of local princes (dekhkan's). The fourth stratum represents the period of the Arab conquest and the spread of Islam, which must be connected with the first appearance of the glazed pottery in this region. This period is best represented by the lower layer of the ruins of Akhsa, the ancient capital of Ferghana, on the steep banks of the Amu near Shakhan settlement, twenty kilometers southwest of Naman- gan. Glazed pottery predominated here in the upper levels but was also found in the lower strata, in combination with the inventories of the pre-</page><page sequence="25">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. 675 ceding stage. The period is well known from the written sources describing the struggles of the local feudal lords with the centralizing tendencies of the Khalifate. The uppermost stratum may be attributed to the seventh or eighth century A.D. While Chinese and classical sources are occasionally useful and analogies between inventories of corresponding periods may often be drawn, a sufficient basis for dating the earlier periods is still lacking. Tentatively the third stage may be dated in the first half of the first millennium of the present era; the second stage, in the beginning of the first, and possibly the end of the second, millennium B.C.; and the first stage, in the second, possibly the end of the third, millennium B.C. SIBERIAM 1. In 1929 S. V. Kiselev38 conducted excavations at Bystraia, near Minusinsk, and near Ust'-Syda and Syda. In 1931 excavations were made near Ust'-Erba, in the Khakassk A.S.S.R., and in 1932 at Tess, near Mt. Il'inskaia. At Ust'-Erba animal bones, common in other Karasuk burials, were not found. The pottery was spherical, round bottomed, and covered with a gray slip. The neck was decorated with horizontal incised lines and the body with triangles and rhombs formed by incised cross-hatching. As a result of these excavations the monuments of Karasuk may be subdivided into three chronological groups, the most ancient of which seems to be connected with tombs of Ust'-Erba, which contained the most highly de- veloped geometric ornamentation of pottery. The grave furniture of these tombs presents affinities with that of burials of the Andronovo type. An- other important result of the excavations was the discovery of both Karasuk and Tagar elements in burials at Bystraia and on the outskirts of the village of Tess. 2. The Mal'ta Expedition of IIMK (M. Gerasimov, leader) continued work on the Belaia River. The stratigraphical sequence began with the - D. N. Lev, of IAE, in a letter dated April 4,1938, writes: "In 1937 I studied the very rich archaeological materials in the Irkutsk Museum preparatory to publishing a book on the production of iron in the pre-Baikal region during the seventh and tenth centuries. In this work I shall refute the opinion generally expressed in the literature that they were unable, in ancient times, to melt iron but worked it only in the soft state. I have in my possession frag- ments of cast iron not of Chinese origin, as shown by chemical analysis. You also have speci- mens of cast iron in Field Museum of Natural History, but my own impression is that they are phosphoric. My own samples have but an insignificant phosphorus content." Thomas T. Read, of the School of Mines, Columbia University, is making chemical analyses of samples of cast iron from Field Museum specimens. 36 S. V.

The lowest cul- tural stratum at the site explored contained the ruins from a late so-called Badaian (Badalskaia) stage of the Siberian Paleolithic period. In the exca- vated area, covering seventy square meters, the remains of seven fire-plat- forms, surrounded by scattered bones and flint implements, were found. The finds included large typologically Mousterian scrapers, nuclei, small scrapers, flat bone harpoons, and bones showing traces of having been worked by stone implements. The remains of characteristic forest fauna, including bones of Cervus elaphus, roe, wolf, and beaver, were present. The principal work of this expedition was conducted at the Paleolithic site of Mal'ta, near Irkutsk. A large dwelling of the semi-dugout type was uncovered. Among the finds were an effigy of a flying bird and an orna- mented lamina of mammoth ivory. Trial trenches revealed the area of the site to be 500 square meters. 3. The Angara Expedition of IIMK (A. P. Okladnikov, leader) exca- vated the Neolithic site of Buret', where the discovery of a very interesting figurine, in costume similar to that of the modern Arctic population, at- tracted attention. In 1937 forty trial pits showed that this site is as large as that at Mal'ta. 4. M. I. Artamonov reports further that the remains of three ancient dwellings and bones of mammoth, reindeer, and wild horse were discovered at Buret'. Near Nizhniaia Buret', on the Angara River, three Eneolithic burials were discovered. The rich inventories included bronze bracelets, ornaments, and bone and stone implements. In the scapula and in a costa of one skeleton were lodged flint arrowheads. An archaeological survey of the entire valley of the Angara River was also completed. One hundred and thirty unrecorded monuments, including settlements, burials, and six sites of petroglyphs were discovered. Among important results of this survey were: (a) The discovery of a new, characteristic type of monument, dated at the beginning of the present era and represented by settlements and burials, one of which contained bronze objects, including an unusual form of arrow- head, bone objects, especially the laminae for bows, and pottery. (b) The investigation of Neolithic burials with exceptionally rich in- ventory, including primitive sculpture (a figurine of a two-headed elk and stone fishes), the remains of a peculiar type of bow set with bone laminae, nephrite axes, and bracelets. (c) The discovery of new petroglyphs, including drawings of people on skis, of elks, and of shamans, and symbolic signs.</page><page sequence="27">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. 677 5. During the past twenty years archaeologists from Moscow, Lenin- grad, Oirot-Tura, and Bilsk have worked in the valleys of the Altai region. Since 1924 the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnology (IAE), Lenin- grad, has examined, under the direction of M. Griaznov, numerous monu- ments in this area, including sepulchers of the first nomads, who may have been contemporaneous with the Scythians of the Black Sea region. During the Scythian epoch the pack horse, a new means of transportation, became an important factor in nomadic life. The large, well-constructed stone tombs preserved both skeletons and grave furniture to a remarkable degree. In 1927 at Chikhe, on the river Ursul, Griaznov found two artificially mum- mified skeletons, which recall Herodotus' account of Scythian mummifica- tion of their kings. Sculptured ornaments in bark and in wood covered with gilt, Chinese lacquers, colored and gilded horn sculptures, and 500 garments, many decorated with gold or gilt, were excavated. 6. In October 1937, on the frozen shore of Siberia opposite Alaska, the remains of a mammoth were found,"3 the second of its kind to be discovered in that region. The trunk measured 9 feet, and the hair was 3 inches in length. The body was intact with the exception of the head, one leg, and part of the trunk, which had been eaten by wild animals. Plans were made to excavate this specimen for shipment to Leningrad to include it in the superb collection of mammoth remains in the Zoological Museum. At Pazyryk, on the river Yan-Ulagan, are five large stone kurgans, one of which was excavated by Griaznov38 in 1929. Although robbed shortly after interment had taken place, the tomb contained well-preserved objects, including wooden beams with a resinous odor. The skin, hair, muscles, and intestines of ten stallions were preserved. The intestines still contained un- digested food. Objects of leather, fur, wool, fabrics, and wood were found. An elaborate wooden cage formed the central chamber of the tomb, while outside lay the ten stallions, which formed the funeral cortege. The walls of the central chamber were covered with black felt, decorated with stylized images. A series of red and blue tiger heads had been appliqued. Borders were festooned with blue, yellow, or bright red. The floor and ceil- ing had originally been covered with felt. Among the most important objects in the tomb were the saddles, bridles, and trappings of the horses. The bridles were richly ornamented with cedar plaques or small carved leather figures.

S., 40, 1938 were of silver or were covered with gold leaf. The cheeks of the bit were sometimes decorated with running stags or mountain sheep. The saddles, covered with multicolored felt and ornamented saddle-cloths, were entirely different from those of modern type. They are the most primitive saddles yet discovered. Although there appears to be a stylistic resemblance between artistic creations of the region from the Danube eastward to Beipine, Piandj, and Kama, the so-called Scytho-Siberian style is not homogeneous and orig- inated in different places. Animal figures from Hungary differ from those of the Volga and of the Dnieper River region and from those of Ordos. The figures from the Altai are unlike those from the Yenissei, and those of western Siberia and those of the Kama region are dissimilar. The Pazyryk craftsmen developed their own artistic style, original but not isolated. Griaznov quotes N. Marr in stating that the reindeer was the first saddle animal and that the horse was domesticated much later. The Pazyryk excavations seemed to confirm this hypothesis,39 for even the dead were buried with a saddled reindeer, that is, a horse disguised as a reindeer. Griaznov attributes the burials at Pazyryk to the fourth or third century before our era. The horses were of Mongol type, that is similar to modern horses of the Asiatic steppes. Each horse bore a property mark, consisting of varying numbers of incisions in the right or left ear. Griaznov suggests that the ten horses belonged to different owners and were sacrificed as mortuary gifts. The Hermitage Museum in Leningrad, which houses the Pazyryk finds, is preparing for publication a detailed report on this important site. 39 Evidence obtained by the Field Museum-Oxford University Joint Expedition to Kish, Iraq, in 1928 points to the domestication of Equide and Cervidce in Mesopotamia about five thousand years ago. In "Y" cemetery two animals were found between the shafts of a four- wheeled chariot. Their teeth were identified as belonging to horses by Wolfgang Amschler, of the Institute of Animal Husbandry, Vienna. In the same cemetery copper rein rings sur- mounted by figurines of an equid, a stag, and birds were found. The stag had a long, heavy rope passing through its muzzle and attached to the right foreleg, indicating, according to Laufer's suggestion (Field Museum News, Vol. 1, No. 3, p. 1) that members of the Cervidce may have been captured alive and tamed by the Sumerians. Edwin H. Colbert (American Anthropologist, Vol. 38, No. 4, 1936, pp. 605-608) calls attention to the "rather strong resem- blances between the figurine [of the stag described] discovered at Kish and the Pleistocene giraffe, Sivatherium," suggesting not only that Sivatheria may have existed as late as early historical times but that they may also have been domesticated. The figurine of the Equus was also identified by Amschler as representing a horse. Teeth of Equus onager, Bos, Capra, Ovis, and Canis were found in the same cemetery (H.F.).</page><page sequence="29">FIELD AND PROSTOV] ARCHAEOLOGY IN THE U.S.S.R. 679 SUMMARY This report gives in brief some recent results obtained by numerous expeditions throughout the Soviet Union.
