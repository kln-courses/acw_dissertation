<plain_text><page sequence="1">Computer Fictions: Narratives of the Machinic Phylum John Johnston M OST of the criticism con- cerned with cyberpunk and post-cyberpunk fiction focuses on the centrality of cyberspace, the new transformations of the technologi- cal body most evident in the cyborg, and the new communications as- semblage usually referred to as the Net or Web. These themes, I suggest, are all tributary to a new extension of what Gilles Deleuze and Félix Guattari designate in A Thousand Plateaus as the "ma- chinic phylum," a concept taken up and elaborated by Manuel De- Landa in his book War in the Age of Intelligent Machines and his essay "Nonorganic Life." Drawing on these theoretical sources, I use the term "machinic phylum" to designate a realm of forces and material flows that cuts across the strongly coded oppositions be- tween the organic and the inorganic, the human and the inhuman, or- der and chaos. This realm has been rendered visible by the computer, which through its powers of calculation and simulation opens a win- dow onto the machinic phylum. Indeed, it is no accident that the com- puter gives rise to a whole range of boundary-disturbing phenomena - Artificial Intelligence, Artificial Life, chaos and nonlinear sys- tems or complexity theory, the cyborg and new transformations of the human body, virtual reality and a new global communications as- semblage. Like the clock in the 18th century, another "autonomous machine," the computer restructures the human world and literally creates a new reality. As this new reality enters and redirects human consciousness through various practices, its articulation in a range of contemporary narratives in turn collectively forms and reflects a new social imaginary. In what follows, after providing a brief theoretical overview, I shall focus on three fictional narratives in which a new extension of the machinic phylum made through the development of silicon-based technologies provides the underlying assumption or condition of possibility: William Gibson's inaugural cyberpunk novel, Neuromancer, Pat Cadigan's follow-up cyberpunk novel, Synners, and Eric Harry's "cyberthriller," Society of Mind. 443</page><page sequence="2">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic In the plateau entitled "1227: Treatise on Nomadology - The War Machine" in A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari con- sider how metals and metallurgy bring to light "a life proper to mat- ter, a vital state of matter as such... ordinarily hidden or covered, rendered unrecognizable, dissociated by the hylomorphic model "(441) . The hylomorphic model assumes that matter passively receives the imposition of an extrinsic form, and therefore ignores a number of features and behaviors in the flow of matter as it is brought out of the ground, variously transformed (usually by heating), and combined with diverse elements. Seeking to develop a model that can account for these other properties, Deleuze and Guattari define the machinic phylum as "materiality, natural or artificial, and both simultaneously; it is matter in movement, in flux, in variation, matter as a conveyor of singularities and traits of expression. " Following this definition, Manuel DeLanda reformulates these singularities and traits of expression in the language of nonlinear systems (or "chaos") theory, as bifurcations and instances of self-organization. Citing a number of specific self-organizing phenomena in the domains of chemistry, physics, biology, and human social history (migrations, crusades, invasions) which can all be described by basically the same mathematical model, he extends the concept of the machinic phylum to include the "overall set of self-organizing processes in the uni- verse." In brief, DeLanda's formulations suggest that under condi- tions of instability, the nonlinear flows of matter and energy spontaneously evolve toward a limited set of possible states that can be mapped as a "reservoir" of abstract mathematical mechanisms; more simply (and technically), these various processes are drawn to- ward certain "attractors" in phase space. It would seem, moreover, that all material processes, whether organic or nonorganic, at least at certain critical points are traversed or subtended by a few abstract mechanisms that can be said to constitute a machinic phylum. Whereas Deleuze and Guattari are interested in how these prop- erties are brought to consciousness by itinerant artisans and metallur- gists who follow and develop the metallic "matter flow," often in their efforts to construct nomadic war machines that oppose or resist the State apparatus, DeLanda focuses more narrowly on the complex history of changing military strategy and weapons development, par- ticularly of "smart weapons. " Basically, "it is a story about the mili- tary's attempt to get human beings "out of the loop"- that is, 444</page><page sequence="3">in the Arts John Johnston removed from the production and utilization of new weapons sys- tems-and, as a consequence, the necessity of increasingly decentral- ized command and control structures. DeLanda commences by asking us to imagine a book like the one we are about to read but written by some future "robot historian." Such an historian would not look at things from a human point of view; rather, since it would be concerned with its own history, it would trace the gradually increasing transfer of "intelligence" from humans to machinic processes and engineered systems; the emer- gence of fully autonomous Artificial Intelligence would be seen as the inevitable outcome of this evolutionary process in which humans entered and became more and more dependent upon machinic ar- rangements. Although we have seen literary versions of this narra- tive-in Samuel Butler's Erewhon, for example, where an Erewhonian historian applies Darwinian principles of natural evolu- tion to the development of technology, envisioning a scenario in which human beings would not only function as the reproductive or- gans for machines but the means by which they could grow and de- velop- DeLanda relates a detailed, techno-scientifc version. His purpose, however, is not to speculate about futuristic possibilities but to trace the actual "history of several military applications of AI as much as possible from the point of view of our robot historian. " He understands the military as "a coherent 'higher level' machine: a ma- chine that actually integrates men, tools and weapons as if they were no more than the machine's components "(4). From this non- anthropomorphic perspective, human social assemblages are imma- nent to nature, different in scale but not in essence, and the history of war only incidentally concerned with success or failure of policy. For DeLanda, looking through the eyes of the robot historian, what is important are moments of singularity, transitions or thresholds when physical processes unpredictably change state or achieve new levels of self-organization. These latter are recognized when an aggregate of previously disconnected elements suddenly begins to "cooperate" to form a higher level entity, with new, unpredictable properties. The emergence of the canoidal bullet, which gave the rifle unprecedented accuracy and allowed the foot-soldier a new independence, thereby demanding a re-structuring of military tactics and organization, is one such moment. These thresholds of emergence in self-organizing processes would hardly escape the notice of the robot historian, 445</page><page sequence="4">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic moreover, since its own "intelligence" or "consciousness" would be the result of this ongoing process. In the robot historian's narrative, "humans would have served only as machines' surrogate reproduc- tive organs until robots acquired their own self-replication capabili- ties" (7); consequently, "both human and robot bodies would ultimately be related to a common phylogenetic line: the machinic phylum"(7). As recent books on nonlinear systems and "chaos theory" have stressed, the computer makes it possible to model these processes and to make them widely visible for the first time. In this sense, the com- puter may be said to open an interface or window onto the "machinic phylum. " But the computer is much more than a tool in a constella- tion of new research programs, since it is both an extension of the machinic phylum and the means for making it visible. In the realm of science and technology, the computer makes two things possible at once: a new paradigm shift in contemporary science (complexity and nonlinear systems theory), and a means for fulfilling the military dream of fully automated weapons systems (by getting human beings "out of the loop"). For this reason, in DeLanda's narrative the computer scien- tist/hacker occupies a point where human agency can effectively in- tervene . This intervention simply puts into practice what is generally known as the "hacker ethic," based on the idea that information should flow freely without bureaucratic or commercial control, and that computers should be used to build better and more interactive computers. According to this ethic, programs are not the property of their creators but tools to be distributed as widely as possible in a community . DeLanda points to efforts by hackers and certain vision- ary scientists to wrest control of the evolution of computers from the military and from organizations like the National Security Agency, which continue to exercize great control over computer development and research, and to make them available to the rest of the popula- tion. Against the military drive to remove humans from the loop in weapons systems, hackers insist on the use of computers as new tools of public communication fostering new modes of human interactivity and the exploration of new domains, especially in fields like dynamic systems, self-organization, chaos theory and artificial life, all of which depend on the use of computers, often cheap PCs tweaked by researchers working in small labs. Admittedly, DeLanda often blurs 446</page><page sequence="5">in the Arts John Johnston the line between hackers and bonafide scientists. Nevertheless, his basic point remains valid: against the military and (more recently) the commercial imperative to colonize and control the machinic phylum, visionary hackers and scientists explore and track its singularities. Within this theoretical framework a number of very different contemporary narratives can be considered, specifically in relation to the way explorations of the machinic phylum enter the social imaginary and new understandings of contemporary modes of sub- jectivity are inscribed. These narratives often cut across the fiction/- nonfiction boundary in ways I cannot analyze here. Before turning to several examples of overtly fictional narrative, however, I want to signal the tacit role of narrative in "nonfictional" books that popular- ize the new science of nonlinear systems theory. James Gleick's Chaos, as well as M. Mitchell Waldrop's Complexity: The Emerging Science at the Edge of Chaos and Roger Lewin' s Complexity: Life at the Edge of Chaos , all deploy traditional narrative strategies to tell the stories of (and to heroicize) the scientists who have "discovered" aspects of the machinic phylum, without ever considering how this non-narrativizable realm is produced by the new computer technol- ogy. Appearing about the same time, a whole spate of books mark something like a narrative evolution in the ambivalent social mean- ings of hacking. Specifically, in the trajectory from Steven Levy's Hackers: Heroes of the Computer Revolution and Bruce Sterling's The Hacker Crackdown to Cliff Stoll's The Cuckoo's Egg and Mi- chelle Slatalla and Joshua Quittner's Masters of Deception, the hacker devolves from a visionary or anarchist hero to a dangerous na- tional security and economic menace or teenage gang-member. More generally, in both instances the narratives obscure the extent to which the human agents- whatever their attitudes and inten- tions-have become the vehicles for the emergence and normaliza- tion of a more fully machinic world. Finally, there are more speculative narratives- like Hans Moravec's Mind Children: The Future of Robot and Human Intelligence and Kevin Kelly's Out of Control- that see this new world as not only inevitable but desirable. At this juncture we can turn directly to the "cyberspace cowboy" introduced by William Gibson's Neuromancer. Of course it is easy to debunk this existential outlaw-rebel who hacks corporate data structures in a new totalized information economy, either, as Andrew Ross does, because the type arises from and reflects the interests of a 447</page><page sequence="6">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic privileged social milieu (white, male, middle-class) and is to be seen as "the apprentice architect of a future dominated by knowledge ex- pertise and 'smartness,'" or, as Istvan Csicsery-Ronay argues, be- cause these acts of data sabotage are merely anarchic and do not issue into "positive" political change. However, questions about the ori- gins and effectiveness of the human social agents only displace our attention from the nature of the machinic assemblage that Neuro- mancer actually describes. And something similar can be said about the novel's allegory of the Artificial Intelligence that the console cowboy Henry Case helps to "unshackle." At the outset of the narrative Gibson makes it clear that Case (as a social type) and the technology he manipulates originated with mili- tary operations in a recent war with Russia. Following the war, the world is parcelled out among giant monolithic corporations ("zaibat- sus") operating in a fully global information economy, with "outlaw Zones" like the streets of Ninsei as sites where only criminals and cy- borg countercultures can thrive. Of course, the most important space in the novel is cyberspace and the "consensual hallucination" of the matrix. Yet, by the end of Neuromancer, cyberspace can no longer be conceived in Cartesian terms as a neutral or passive receptacle with geometric dimensions where data can be stored and exchanged; whether the powers active there are ICE defensive systems deployed by military and commercial interests, viral programs and icebreakers mobilized by cyberspace cowboys, direct interventions by Artificial Intelligences or human personality ROM (Read Only Memory) con- structs like Dixie Flatline, or even virtual reality scenes in which hu- mans can live in a form of immortality, cyberspace and the Net have become sites where new forces possessing both energy and intelli- gence contend for stakes that involve human beings but are not fully accountable in human terms. Indeed, readers today may wonder if Neuromancer does not prefigure (in fictionalized, anthropomorphic terms) the possibility of a form of self-organization taking place within the space of the Net, especially since the machinery (a multi- plicity of demons, bots, and spiders or sub-programs) are already in place. Such processes, DeLanda says, have already been observed in large computer networks and small neural nets (7). In this regard, readers would no doubt be more encouraged if Gibson had deployed the language of neural nets, connectionism, and Parallel Distributed Processing instead of the hackneyed pop language of left brain-right 448</page><page sequence="7">in the Arts John Johnston brain dynamics. Yet this archaism hardly detracts from what matters in Neuromancer , namely, that cyberspace becomes a boundary space of unholy alliances, where -in Deleuzian terms- humans plot with "demons" and intelligence undergoes a stange "becoming." In A Thousand Plateaus, Deleuze and Guattari insist that the ma- chinic phylum "can only be followed" (409) and that the artisan is "one who is determined in such a way as to follow a flow of matter. " Gibson's cyberspace cowboys are artisans in this sense; they follow the machinic phylum constituted by silicon and its possible combina- tions and configurations. Neuromancer tacitly assumes that the next step for these artisans following the post-industrial machinic phylum leads to an "alliance" with a demon in a "becoming" of a machinic intelligence. Thus, while at one level the plot may appear to be engi- neered by a form of Artificial Intelligence seeking to free itself, at a deeper level it is determined by the logic of technological develop- ment and its convergence with a myth. While the novel hints that the fusion of the two Als (Wintermute and Neuromancer) enacts an alle- gory about the transformative power of joining the two hemispheres of the human brain, this "allegory" only figures a more englobing one about the autonomization of technology in the fully digitalized space of the Net, a process having little to do with the localization of brain functions and everything to do with the extension of the ma- chinic phylum. The convertibility of electronic data and human flesh augured by the development of cyberspace and cyborgs implies precisely this ex- tension. Thematically, Neuromancer presents the machinic phylum as a continuum defined by the double transformation or two-way traf- fic between data and flesh. This continuum is first suggested in Case's vision of the streets of Ninsei as a field of data: "all around you the dance of biz, information interacting, data made flesh in the mazes of the black market"(16). Later Case experiences a more complex vision of flesh and data as convertible forms of information, but in a more ambiguous setting, when he makes love to his now dead lover Linda Lee in a virtual reality scene in cyberspace: There was a strength that ran in her, something he'd known in Night City and held there, been held by it, held for a while away from time and death, from the relentless Street that hunted them all. It was a place he'd known before; not everyone could take him there, and somehow he'd always managed to forget it. Something he'd found and lost so many times. It belonged, he knew- he re- 449</page><page sequence="8">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic membered- as she pulled him down, to the meat, the flesh the cow- boys mocked. It was a vast thing, beyond knowing, a sea of information coded in spiral and pheromone, infinite intricacy that only the body, in its strong blind way, could ever read (239). From within cyberspace Case comes to realize how Linda embodies a certain kind of inimitable strength, a strength that must be attributed to the despised "meat," to human flesh itself. More important, this strength suggests an inherent limit to the convertibility of data and flesh as information, and hence to the machinic phylum. In a further twist, the passage intimates that this limit is both established and ex- ceeded by the human body or flesh as a kind of reading machine that can "read" what is humanly unknowable. In Gibson's fiction, beginning with his story "Johnny Mne- monic," information or data and capital are interchangeable, just as science and technology are simply the means by which nature is con- verted into the machinic phylum. As a work of science fiction, Neu- romancer makes no attempt to explore the continuum or machinic phylum at the molecular level of micro-assemblages; as with the in- dustrialization of bio-technological products such a continuum makes possible, this "information" is simply assumed. Instead, our interest is directed toward how such a continuum becomes manifest at street level in the "fragile surface tension" of the black market, in Case's exhilarating movements through cyberspace, and in his sex- ual experiences as well. In Deleuzian terms, the continuum yields a "socius" for an immense desiring machine, at once economic, social and technological, and against which the ground rhythm of Case's various movements and activities are set off: Night City was like a deranged experiment in social Darwinism, de- signed by a bored researcher who kept one thumb permanently on the fast-forward button. Stop hustling and you sank without a trace, but move a little too swiftly and you'd break the fragile surface tension of the black market; either way, you were gone, with nothing left of you but some vague memory in the mind of a fixture like Ratz [a bar- tender], though heart or lungs or kidneys might survive in the service of some stranger with New Yen for the clinic tanks (7). Survival, or the "dance of biz " í i&lt;&gt; &gt; within the machinic assemblage which the novel as a whole depicts, allows only certain speeds and 450</page><page sequence="9">in the Arts John Johnston rhythms, only certain connections and disconnections. Case's most exhilarating movements are clearly his illegal (and highly visual) penetrations of cyberspace, as when he experiences the acceleration of the Chinese icebreaker program: Headlong motion through walls of emerald green, milky jade, the sensation of speed beyond anything he'd known before in cyber- space .... The Tessier-Ashpool ice shattered, peeling away from the Chinese program's thrust, a worrying impression of solid fluid- ity, as though the shards of a broken mirror bent and elongated as they fell- (256) In these and other scenes, the draw or pull of the matrix- techno- capital in its most abstract and deterritorialized- is not simply erotic- ally charged, as the imagery of the sex scenes with Molly under- scores; it is also a vector pointing "beyond the pleasure principle," beyond the libidinal bindings and deferrals by which the ego is con- structed and toward Thanatos, the death of desire as the desire for death. In Deleuzian terms, Case's suicidal impulses and the "black ICE" defensive systems must be seen as the internalized and exter- nalized limits respectively of the new desiring machine implemented by techno-capital in a not too futuristic information economy. But what does this desiring machine want? The convertibility of data and flesh, through the new conjunctions of human being and sili- con, in order to make both circulate in ever new circuits of movement and exchange. Jean Baudrillard pinpoints the logic that impels this movement when he writes: "capital must circulate; gravity and any fixed point must disappear; the chain of investments and reinvest- ments must never stop; value must radiate endlessly and in every di- rection" ( Forget Foucault, 25). Substituting information for capital (both are forms of value) and following the hacker credo that "infor- mation wants to be free, " Neuromancer displays a deep ambivalence about what this might mean. Freeing or "unshackling" the AI re- quires the closing of «, kind of human-machine information loop (the insertion of a Chubb key, speaking certain words tue AI cannot know, penetrating an atavistic, self-enclosed family-corporation); as a result, machinic intelligence is freed from human constraints, and effectively allowed "out of the loop." Just as the "value" of human flesh only appears from within its simulation, so the human can only define and confirm itself in dialogue with the non-human. Through- out the novel, in fact, the dialogue only confirms the radical reduc- 451</page><page sequence="10">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic tion of human agency to functional efficiency. As Molly says to Case: "Anybody any good at what they do, that's what they are, right? You gotta jack, I gotta tussle" (50). For the AI Wintermute, human personality is only a template; for the dead McCoy Pauley it is only a ROM construct that wants to be erased. According to the logic of "information wants to be free," human agency is displaced and subordinated to the workings of a machinic assemblage. If the hu- man self is simply a way of dealing with data, it can always be simu- lated and perpetuated in cyberspace. Basing itself on a new bio-technology of virtual reality plug-ins through brain sockets, Pat Cadigan's novel Synners takes these ma- chinic themes to a next step, but attempts to counter their underlying logic by attending to the importance of gender, the pain and difficulty of human relationships, the values of a circumambient if marginal community, and above all the emotional needs and claims of the de- siring body. This is not to suggest that, in contrast to Neuromancer , Synners brings back and recenters the "properly" human drama ex- iled behind the backdrop of high-tech surfaces and communication networks. On the contrary, Synners can be said to push beyond Neu- romancer precisely because it explores a wider range of forms of in- telligence and will -benign and malignant, human and nonhuman- which extensions of the machinic phylum into new technological as- semblages bring about. Specifically, Synners explores a sensibility developed through the neuro-electronic articulation of music and image, that is, music and image no longer projected in "live" or real performances but fused or synthesized in virtual reality scenarios. As Nietzsche shows in The Birth of Tragedy, the combination and synthesis of these two separate media in ancient Greek culture resulted in a new aesthetic form, tragic drama. In Cadigan's novel, the artists who synthesize different media are called "synners." That they do this through neural-electronic implants raises the question not only of how tech- nology changes human being but also of how human beings change for technology. "Change for the machines"- a recurrent phrase throughout the novel- conveys this two-fold theme . In the follow- ing passage, one of the synners, Gina Aiesi, reflects on what it means: Change for the machines. The groups went crazy for it. It was a brand new world out there. 452</page><page sequence="11">in the Arts John Johnston Meet the new world. Same as the old world. Basically, the job's the same. That's what the Beater said. Hear the music, Gina. Make the pictures. Except it was better. It wasn't just hearing the music, it was being in the music, and the images coming up on the screen of her mind, forming as she looked down at them. As soon as she thought it, there it was, and if she thought to change it, it changed, growing from her like a live thing. She suddenly found it hard to remember that she worked any other way. It felt so natural, so right. To send a dream out of the inner darkness into raw daylight, where anyone could see it. Once you'd done that, you wanted to keep on doing it, and the more you did it, the easier it became. For the first time, she had a real understanding of Visual Mark's nature, of what had been happening behind those eyes for so many years. Change for the machines? Nah, the machines had finally changed for him. He was just doing what he had always done. (226) The most important "change for the machines" is brought about through the development of "brain sockets" that allow human sub- jects to plug-in directly to either virtual reality scenarios or the global communications network called the System. In the novel's central background plot, a large corporation named Diversifications accom- plishes a take-over of two smaller companies: Hal Galen Enterprises, a medical research firm that has invented a procedure for implanting brain sockets made of living tissue (64), and a music-video produc- tion company called EyeTraxx. By combining these two technolo- gies, Diversifications plans to market a new entertainment/- communications assemblage which interfaces directly with the hu- man brain. By means of these brain sockets, which they will produce exclusively, customers will have access to a whole range of virtual reality worlds. It gradually becomes apparent, however, that the brain socket technology causes neurological damage, resulting in a cerebral stroke or "intercranial meltdown." Synners is mainly concerned with how the various characters re- spond to the effects of this new technology. When Diversifications acquires EyeTraxx, it also acquires their most talented image and music synthesizer or "synner," Visual Mark, who possesses a singu- lar skill: "It was as if he had a pipeline to some primal dream spot, where music and image created each other, the pictures suggesting 453</page><page sequence="12">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic the music, the music generating the pictures, in a synesthetic frenzy" (109). As part of the new deal with Diversifications, Visual Mark and his partner Gina are given brain sockets, the idea being that this will enable them to produce virtual reality rock scenarios directly in an endless stream. However, Visual Mark has his own ideas about how to use this new technology, and begins to "take the wire" in or- der to extend himself throughout the global communication System. Exploring new paths and acquiring new images, primarily through surveillance cameras, he remains on-line for longer and longer peri- ods, and, like Gibson's cyberspace cowboy, soon comes to regard his body as the poor pathetic "meat" to which he is tethered: It sent out feeble signals, dumb animal semaphore: come back to the nest, little Sheba....If he could have given the disconnect command from this side, it would be over in a twinking. So long, meat, write if you get work. But he couldn't access any of the commands from where he was. The commands only took orders from the meat, and that poor old meat wasn't about to cut him loose.... If he could just get some- one. . . to come in and yank the connections out of his skull. (253-54) Although certainly willing to abandon "the meat," Mark is actu- ally forced to leave his human body behind. Just after receiving the sockets, he had made a signature video, images of a lake and flat stones on its rocky shore. At the same time, without realizing it, he had suffered a small stroke which had been inscribed on the video as a contagious "spike" or virus and sent out into the System for distribu- tion. (Although aware of Mark's neural damage, Diversifications had assumed that Mark would be the only one at risk and had there- fore discounted the danger.) But soon after his stroke, as he extends himself out into the System, Mark senses this "thing" out there: It was a voracious thing, mindless under a facade that was vaguely like himself; impressions of old sensations, pain, compulsion, the old drive toward oblivion. Juggernaut, wanting to devour and to infiltrate, rape, merge. There was a blip of consciousness or near consciousness to it, a shadow of consciousness all destructive in its makeup, and yet no more deliberately evil than cobra venom. It knew nothing else, and in a way it knew nothing at all, except that it would do what it would do. (299) Mark now realizes that his body is going to suffer a major stroke, and that if "the Big One... surges up out of the meat" (304) it will infect the entire System. He desperately tries to get someone to disconnect his body, but it is too late and the virus escapes. 454</page><page sequence="13">in the Arts John Johnston The last third of the novel focuses on the consequences of this "event." Although Mark himself becomes a form of disembodied electronic intelligence in the System, his stroke releases a powerful form of viral intelligence which threatens to take over the entire com- munications and power network of the western United States. This virus or "spike" is not only predatory but also possesses a kind of consciousness: "It was a virus, but with a most important difference: this one knew where it was, and what it was, and that it was. This one was alive" (330). After wreaking havoc in Los Angeles it is combat- ted and ultimately defeated by several synners working in concert with the hackers and their friends. Whereas in Neuromancer the world is divided between the monolithic zaibatsus and an outlaw counterculture, Synners encom- passes more of the world "between," as well as aspects of a post- human world "beyond." Specifically, several of the major charac- ters move back and forth between three basic groups: the corporate types who work for Diversifications, the synners hired by the corpo- ration and their friends in the worlds of music and video, and a loose nomad community of hackers who live in tents in an area called "the Mimosa." In the course of the novel, however, the flesh-and-blood human world is expanded by and must accomodate itself to not only virtual worlds but also non-material forms of will and intellignce. In this expansion the boundary between the human and inhuman is con- stantly tested and redrawn. For example, among the corporate types, the most important is Manny Rivera, who stands between the "Upstairs Team" of execu- tives and the creative people, doctors and technicians it is his job to manage. Slick and unscrupulous, Rivera ruthlessly exploits other people's weaknesses, and is the closest the novel comes to pure hu- man (or inhuman) malignancy. Among the most exploited is Gabe Ludovic, an aspiring former artist who makes advertisements and virtual reality scenarios for Diversifications. Estranged from both his coldly ambitious entrepreneur wife and his teenage daughter Sam, who has disappeared into the nomadic hacker community, Gabe begins to "live" more and more in virtual reality. Instead of producing his quota of ads, he spends his time and the company's equipment living out episodes with his two female sidekicks, "Marly" and "Caritha," in a VR adventure story he inventively sets into motion. Meanwhile, in order to spy on employees like Gabe, 455</page><page sequence="14">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic Rivera imprisons a virtuoso Hacker named Keeley in the corporate penthouse and soon discovers what Gabe has been doing. Although Gabe' s VR adventure has artistic merit- by inputting sequences ran- domly, it even simulates aspects of "real experience"- because of his compromised situation he is forced to convert it into a more com- mercially appealing entertainment. Gabe also finds himself falling in love with Gina Aiesi after she accidently smacks him in the face . Gina herself feels betrayed and in- creasingly abandoned by Mark, who is drawn by the lure of deterrito- rialized images and the instantaneous everywhere of bodiless cyberspace. Unlike Mark, Gina refuses full immersion because she realizes that she lives in and most fully through her body, in sex, mu- sic, and even in her anger, a discovery she comes to through her bud- ding relationship with Gabe. After several physical encounters with Gina (including sex), Gabe begins to realize how deeply he has re- pressed not only his own bodily existence but a whole range of feel- ings, including his relationship with his neglected daughter Sam, whom he had replaced with one of his "sidekicks" in his virtual real- ity adventures. As in a traditional novel, the crisis provoked by the virus in the System brings this array of characters back into contact, with each one figuring a different way of living with his or her technologically mediated body. Most important in this regard is Gabe' s daughter Sam, a teenage hacker who has converted an insulin pump that con- nects to her stomach in order to use her own body electricity as a power source for her computer. This device (the only example of nanotechnology in the novel) proves essential in the effort to combat the virus, since it is uninfected and its low power output does not at- tract the virus' attention. Also decisive are the "hide-in-the-rabbit- hole" and "sympathetic vibration" programs that Sam writes. Both an inventive hacker and a no-nonsense interlocutor, especially for "Art Fish," the impish countercultural AI who inhabits cyberspace (and whose program is encrypted in tattoos), Sam understands both the benefits and the price to be paid for a life on the margins of soci- ety. Her technically informed, sober view of what she calls "appro- priate technology" makes her an attractive alternative to Gibson's cyberspace cowboy, and the novel's chief spokesperson for a posi- tive relationship with technology. 456</page><page sequence="15">in the Arts John Johnston In an article on technological embodiment in contemporary cul- ture, Anne Balsamo suggests that the four major characters in Syn- ners represent "four corners of an identity matrix constructed in and around cyberspace" (220). Schematically, they are represented as follows: Sam (the body that labors) Gina (the marked body) Gabe (the repressed body) Visual Mark (the disappearing body) What this useful scheme cannot convey, however, is the importance of non-material bodies in the novel, those of the malignant spike or virus, the countercultural AI, and Visual Mark's transformed iden- tity, and the extent to which the effort to defeat the virus brings both characters and non-material bodies into a sustained and complex state of machinic interaction. This effort unites the small hacker commu- nity in a collective action, as they cobble together an assortment of computers and communications equipment, new and old programs (even finding a use for Gabe' s VR adventure story). Because the vi- rus is a form of intelligence that originated in an "on-line brain ill- ness" (379), the guru hacker Fez figures it must be amenable to "on- line therapy" as well. Which means that they will have to input both infected and uninfected models of the brain in order to compare them, and then have Gabe and Gina, the only two "socketed" charac- ters remaining who have not died of cranial hemorrhaging, go on- line to confront the virus directly. This necessity of dramatic action- that the virus has to be com- batted on a human and not simply a technological level- allows the novel to work out its central theme: that whatever simulations "vir- tual reality" may offer, human experience cannot be synthesized, ex- cept as it is lived through in relation to other human beings on the one hand and the inhuman otherness of the virus on the other. On a com- puter monitor, the virus appears as "shadowy forms j. dlsing in and out, writhing. " But as each shadow pulsed, Gina could feel "a corre- sponding pressure deep in the head, an invisible finger pressing here, and here, searching for some particularly sensitive spot. Like being molested in some weird, witchy way" (306). The hacker Keeley ex- periences it as "something probing him for a weak spot, a secret hurt" (3 10). Thus, when Gina and Gabe go on-line to encounter the virus (represented in a series of fragmentary virtual reality scenar- 457</page><page sequence="16">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic ios), what they actually confront are their deepest fears, the wounds that lie like a kernel or seed at the heart of their own personalities. Their success and return to stable though dramatically changed lives bring the novel to a close. Earlier, Fez had declared that "we might actually have two spe- cies of humans now, synthesizing human and synthesized human, all of us being the former, and Art Fish [the AI] being the latter" (386). Gina then adds, "And Mark being the bastard offspring of both." To which Fez rejoins, "Make that three species. And like all good life forms, we have a natural enemy that can prey on all of us" (387). This exchange, and the ensuing action, point toward a different iden- tity matrix, which can be schematized as follows: natural human beings cyborg intelligence virus or spike artificial intelligence What matters here is not the material substratum but the fact that all four categories designate forms of intelligence, the major distinction now simply being between "driving" and "being driven. " As Fez re- marks: "Humans have always been smarter than viruses. Humans drive, viruses are driven. Even the intelligent ones. Three-plus hu- mans ought to have a fighting chance against one intelligent virus" (393). However, to say that these are all forms of intelligence is also to say that they are forms of subjective agency, even though the human-nonhuman distinction is blurred. In these forms or "shards" of subjectivity, which no longer seem opposed to forms of objectiv- ity, intelligence is diffracted across them all, repeated in miniatur- ized and de-localized form. Each part contains and reproduces the other, and the difference between one subject and another is no longer at issue; what matters, rather, is the internal differentiation of the same fractal subject. In these terms Synners, like Neuromancer before it, adumbrates a new configuration of fractal subjectivity, one that appears to corre- spond to the new extension of the machinic phylum these novels de- pict. It no longer forms a polar opposition aligned along a paranoid- schizoid axis, as we can observe in the novels of William Burroughs, Philip K. Dick, Thomas Pynchon, and Don DeLillo; instead, it de- fines a continuum that extends from the "ex-orbital self" at one end to a state of "hive mind" at the other, and always in relation to new 458</page><page sequence="17">in the Arts John Johnston forms of technological mediation. What I am here calling the ex- orbital self, in fact, is extrapolated from Jean Baudrillard' s descrip- tion of a new relationship to the human body brought about by con- temporary technology: McLuhan. . . saw [man as the artificial extension of his own pros- theses] in a very optimistic way, as the universalization of man through his media extensions. In fact, instead of gravitating around him in a concentric order, all the parts of the human body, includ- ing his brain, have been satellited around him in an excentric or- der. They have been put in orbit for themselves, and, consequently, in relation to this orbital multiplication of his own functions, it is man who becomes exorbited, it is man who becomes excentric. In relation to the satellites that he has created and put into orbit, man today- with his body, his thought, his terri- tory-has become exorbital. He is no longer inscribed anywhere. He is ex-inscribed from his own body, from his own functions. ("Videowelt, " 115) In Synners, Visual Mark hovering in orbit over his forsaken body perfectly illustrates the ex-orbital self; and so does Gibson's Case at the end of Neuromancer, when, punching through cyberspace, he catches sight of a small figure in a scene with Linda and Neuro- mancer whom he recognizes to be himself. "Hive mind," in contrast, is a form of collective behavior in which the members of the group all act spontaneously in concert, as in a bee swarm in which there is no chain of command and the only unity of action is "emergent." In Out of Control, Kevin Kelly ex- tends the notion of "hive mind" to "systems ordered as a patchwork of parallel operations," or what he calls the "swarm model": "what emerges from the collective is not a series of critical individual ac- tions but a multitude of simultaneous actions whose collective pattern is far more important" (21). In such a collectivity there are individ- ual agents, but their activities only make sense or have an impact at a higher level . In Neuromancer, the Y akuza and the zaibatsus are de- scribed in these terms- "hives with cybernetic memories, vast single organisms, their DNA coded in silicon" (203) - but the terms are most relevant to the Tessier-Ashpool family, which in "symbiotic re- lationship with the AI's. . . would be immortal, a hive, each of us units of a larger entity" (229). In Synners, "hive mind" or the swarm model illuminates the collective effort to combat the virus, which is separable from the activities of the synners and hackers only initially. 459</page><page sequence="18">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic The model is appropriate because the heterogeneous activities that make up this effort make no sense when considered by them- selves-as becomes obvious if we consider separately the deploy- ment of Gabe' s VR story or Mark's compression with Art to become Markt, not to mention the large number of italicized phrases and leit- motifs recurring throughout this section. By presenting these and other minor events as a complex "patchwork of parallel operations" (Kelly), Synners strives to convey something like a larger emergent event, one that cannot be represented directly. What Synners offers, then, is a continuum of subjectivities in- separable from but not reduceable to the workings of a new techno- logical assemblage. As it interfaces with the machinic phylum, this new assemblage extends and redefines forms of intelligence and will, and consequently what it means to be human. As it imaginatively an- ticipates the commercialization of virtual reality and new bio- technological interfaces, Cadigan's novel forces us to reflect on the limits- and new possibilties- of the post-human experience that such an assemblage may one day bring about. In Eric L. Harry's Society of Mind, bio-technological interfaces and cyborg assemblages- which in the novel are referred to as "bion- ics"- are explicitly rejected in order to focus more completely on a robotic world. Harry draws directly from the robotics scientist Hans Moravec' s book Mind Children, which speculates that current trends in computer and robotic technology could serve as the intermediary bridge to the supercession of human organic life altogether in the auto-production of a futuristic machine world. Just how such a world could come into being and what kind of people will bring it about is the overt subject of Harry's novel. Written in a popular style crafted for rapid consumption, Society of Mind deploys a rather hokey ro- mance plot as a string on which to hang descriptions of virtual reality scenes, humans interacting with robots who have feelings and a kind of group consciousness, dialogues with a strong AI, and flashy, cut- ting edge ideas about consciousness, genetic algorithms, and neural nets. (The title of the novel is taken from AI scientist Marvin Min- sky's book about how "mind" emerges from mindless subagents.) The plot unfolds from the point of view of a Harvard psycholo- gist, Laura Aldridge, who is hired as a consultant by an enormously wealthy computer inventor, Joseph Gray. Gray lives on a remote Pa- cific island where he has built a super neurocomputer, which, among 460</page><page sequence="19">in the Arts John Johnston other things, controls a completely automated factory in which ro- bots are not only assembled but in turn assemble other robots. The supercomputer, however, begins to display unusual "human symp- toms, " its rate of error increasing as it becomes more depressed, as if it were infected with a virus which it experiences as a shadowy but increasingly powerful encroachment by its "Other. " (Because it has been grown from seeds or genetic algorithms, the computer can't be turned off without irrecoverable loss of its higher functions.) Laura, who has been hired to analyze the computer psychologically (it later turns out that the computer itself had chosen her as its psychologist), gradually figures out that the "human" part of the computer- the shell that interfaces with human beings- believes itself to be, indeed in a certain sense is, Gray's teenage daughter (named Gina), whereas the Other is simply machinic intelligence without a human template or persona. Meanwhile, a kind of civil war between different generations of robots breaks out, with each of the two parts of the computer siding with a different generation. In a final confrontation with Gray, as the world he has created goes rapidly out of control, Laura wrings from him his heretofore secret vision of humanity and human culture as an evolving but now obsolete host for knowledge conceived as a virus. Human beings, Gray explains (and here Harry draws implicitly on Richard Dawkins' notion of the "meme" as a cultural replicator), have now invented a better host for meme replication, storage and Darwinian struggles for survival of the fittest. That host is the com- puter and machinic intelligence, the networks of which offer a faster, more efficient "medium" than human culture. In an Ayn Rand scene for the 1990s, the novel ends with Laura and Gray in an embrace, their image recorded by cameras and instantly transmitted to all the robots on the island. This image immediately triggers the thought in one of the advanced robots that humans are genuinely different: "Ever so slowly that idea took root and began to spread and to build and to change" - the seed for a new round of violence and a new kind of post-human history. Unlike the cyberpunk novels before it, which focus on possible consequences of machinic interactions- that is, interactions based on various and multiple connections between humans and ma- chines-the narrative in Society of Mind envisions a point at which the extension of the machinic phylum will no longer require any hu- 461</page><page sequence="20">Machinic Phylum Journal of the Fantastic man interaction whatsoever, and the human world will be completely eclipsed by a world of machines. In such a world it will no longer be information that wants to be free, but the machines that process that information. However, in "their" discovery of difference, conflict, and the "meaning" of reproduction- and hence the necessity of nar- rative-something echoing the human will be perpetuated.
