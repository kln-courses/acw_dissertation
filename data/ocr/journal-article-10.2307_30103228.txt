<plain_text><page sequence="1">CYCLADIC FIGURINES AND THEIR DERIVATIVES IN CRETE WITH the publication of Dr. Renfrew's most valuable study of the development and chrono- logy of the Early Cycladic figurines' it is now possible for us to study both the distribution and the influence of these figurines in the regions bordering the Aegean-in the Troad, Dodecanese, northern Greece, the Peloponnese, and Crete. This paper is concerned with Cycladic figurines in Crete, and with the influence which the Cycladic figures had upon the development of the indigenous Cretan types. It begins with a brief description of the Neolithic figurines of Crete, and proceeds to a discussion of Cycladic and indigenous types, and an examination of three types which appear to be hybrids, peculiar to the island. The concluding section discusses the significance of the Cycladic figurines and their derivatives in Crete as evidence for cultural contact in the Aegean Early Bronze Age. Early Minoan figurines as a whole have received relatively little attention from Aegean prehistorians,2 although their value as indicators of cultural contact has at times been over-emphasized. A brief discussion of the main types of figurines found in Early Minoan Crete has been published by me elsewhere.3 Most of these types are discussed here in greater detail, but two groups-male and female figurines with hands raised to the breasts-are omitted from the discussion since they have no bearing on the problem of figurines of Cycladic derivation. Due to the comparatively small numbers of figurines involved, and the extreme scarcity of examples from closely dated contexts, the present study must be, essentially, a typological one, although an attempt is made to fix the chronological position of all the figurine types discussed. NEOLITHIC FIGURINES IN CRETE Our knowledge of the Neolithic figurines of Crete is based almost entirely on the figurines found in the excavations at Knossos. Surprisingly, perhaps, stone figurines are relatively common in the Early Neolithic period at Knossos and the earliest examples are all standing figures. I C.

Squatting figures with a rounded base, emphasized breasts, and stumps to represent the arms and head first appear at the end of Early Neolithic I but are more numerous in E.N. II and continue in use into the Late Neolithic period. These are of clay and again represent figures with arms raised to the breast, as one example from Knossos clearly indicates.6 There is just a chance that this type could have survived into, or been copied in, the Early Bronze Age; for a clay figurine of this type found at Mallia (FIG. I, 5) was in red unburnished clay, decorated with two chevrons and one diagonal line in black paint.7 Painted decoration of this sort is unknown in Crete before the Early Bronze Age; unfortunately the Mallia figurine was without context. Whether or not the standing figurine re-emerges during the Cretan Late Neolithic is uncertain. Evans published four stone figurines from Crete which he believed to be of Late Neolithic date, although all four were without known context.8 In addition four or five other stone figurines of similar type were found at Knossos but never published,9 and one of these (Ucko, cat. no. 57) is known to have come from the Neolithic deposits. All these figurines appear to belong to the widespread Aegean 'fat lady' class, which includes both seated and standing figures.Io Renfrew regards these as essentially a Middle Neolithic type which continued into the Late Neolithic," and certainly it is difficult to separate them completely from the standing Early Neolithic figurines, both in Crete and on the Greek mainland. Weinberg has rightly emphasized that the Neolithic figurines of Crete are in a different tradition to those of mainland Greece and the Cyclades.I2 The differences are not only of type but also of material, for whilst in Crete stone figurines are common in E.N. I and gradually give way to clay ones, elsewhere in the Aegean the reverse is true. In this respect it might be said that developments in the rest of the Aegean were anticipated in Crete, and it is interesting to note that the schematic clay figurines of E.N. II already approximate to the form of the 'violin' idols of the Grotta-Pelos culture. At present, however, there is nothing to connect the Cretan and Aegean figurine traditions in the Neolithic period, but for the two 'fat ladies' purchased by Evans and mentioned above. If, as Evans supposed, these are of Late Neolithic date, then we might see them as products of the same process that produced the sub-Neolithic chalices, horned vases, Trapeza ware, and red-ochre decorated vases, all of which have Aegean (and mainly Troadic) affinities. CYCLADIC FIGURINES IN CRETE Renfrew's discussion of the Cycladic figurines fell into two major parts, the first dealing with figurines of the Grotta-Pelos culture and the second with folded-arm figurines (FAF) and their derivatives, and we may take these categories as the basis for our discussion of the Cretan finds of Cycladic figurines. 4 Evans, fig. 63, 15; fig. 62, 8, Io, 12. s I have in mind the many examples from Nea Niko- medeia, Tsangli, Elateia, and other sites in Thessaly and Phocis. 6 Evans, fig. 64, 33.

Schematic Figurines (FIG. 8, 1--4) Of the five flat, schematic figurine types ('Brettidolen') found in the Cyclades, only one is found in Crete and that very rarely. This is the Pebble form (Renfrew type ID), which in the Cyclades occurs also in Neolithic levels. The only certain examples from Crete are two from the</page><page sequence="4">60 KEITH BRANIGAN cave burials at Pyrgos, although two broken pebbles found in the cave at Arkhalokhori may also have been examples of the type. Both of these deposits were predominantly E.M. I, and are from sites in the region along the north coast of Crete between Iraklion and the Gulf of Mirabello which I have previously referred to as the 'Cycladic province' of Early Bronze Age Crete.13 Both the chronological and geographical position of the Minoan 'pebble figurines' is thus what we might expect.

In addition to types IA-E, Renfrew also mentions the spade-like schematic figurines from Paros, also found in a grave of the Grotta-Pelos culture.14 These are of some importance, scarce though they may be, since a single example occurs in Crete in the Ay. Onouphrios deposit and provides us with the earliest datable figurine in this important collection. I have presumed to continue Renfrew's classification and label the 'spade figurines' as type IF. IF I. Ay. Onouphrios. E.M. I-L.M. Pictographs, fig. 126 (FIG. I, 4). There are a number of other schematic figurines in the Aegean which Renfrew briefly considered, although they occur sporadically or not at all in the Cycladic islands. Of these, the Troy I type is represented in Crete by a rather elongated variant which I suggest we might call the Lebena type. Two examples were found at Lebena, one in an E.M. I level and another in an E.M. II deposit, whilst a third was found in the Ay. Onouphrios deposit; the fourth was found in a seemingly L.M. context at Zakro. The nearest Trojan parallels are found not in Troy I, where the type is short and squat, but rather in Troy III and IV where elongated examples are more numerous.'5 Thus this particular variant probably occurs in Crete earlier than in Troy itself, and the Lebena type could perhaps be entirely indigenous to the island. Two squat figurines nearer to the Troy I type were found in the cave at Trapeza, in a mixed sub-Neolithic to M.M. I context, but even these are not true Troy I figurines since they are not Brettidolen but are carved in the round. They almost certainly belong with the earlier material in the deposit. Lebena I.

The two Troy I varieties could both be entirely indigenous to the island, but both their dating and their contexts suggest that they are based on Cycladic or Aegean proto- types. The cave deposit at Trapeza produced many artefacts with Aegean affinities, and in particular a whole group of bone figurines derived from the FAFs (to be discussed below). 13 Branigan 225-6. 14 Renfrew 8 n. 31. s' e.g. Troy ii, pl. 48, 34-318; pl.

Onouphrios deposit (FAFs, imported Cycladic pyxides). In other words, these figurines occur in deposits which show strong Cycladic and Aegean influences and contacts. Furthermore, where these figurines can be dated they occur in E.M. I and II when Aegean influences in Crete are at their strongest and these figurine types are in use in the Aegean. In other words, from the beginning of the Early Bronze Age, the Minoans both adopted and adapted Cycladic and Aegean figurine types. IV. Folded-Arm Figurines: The Koumasa Type No figurines of Renfrew's types II and III (Plastiras and Louros respectively) have yet been discovered in Crete, but this is hardly surprising since they form small and comparatively specialized groups within the Cyclades. Renfrew's type IV, on the other hand, is as well represented in Crete as its widespread distribution throughout the Aegean suggests it might be.16 However, with Renfrew's recognition of the distinctive Koumasa variety, we can now see that the number of imported figurines of this type is very small indeed, and that even allowing for what may be Cretan copies of varieties originating in the Cyclades, the number of type IV figurines other than those of the Koumasa group does not exceed a dozen.17 Of these we might perhaps recognize three as belonging to Renfrew's group IVF (Spedos), although only the superb example from Koumasa (IVF 27) can be identified with certainty as an import from the Cyclades. A head and a headless body from the Ay. Onouphrios deposit are probably of Spedos type, although in the case of the head we cannot be certain, and the headless body reveals most of the individual features of the Spedos type and yet is by no means a typical example of it. One example of the Dokathismata type was identified by Renfrew amongst the group of figurines from Tekes (IVB 13). The figurine in question fits happily enough into the type group, but the remarkably short body, in contrast to the length of the neck and legs, reveals a very clear affinity to the indigenous Koumasa FAF variety, and suggests that this figurine from Tekes was made in Crete. The remaining, mostly fragmentary, FAFs from Crete (other than those of Koumasa type) cannot with certainty be ascribed to any particular type; it may well be that several of them are hybrid figurines combining the features of the Koumasa and various Cycladic varieties.

To students of the Minoan Early Bronze Age, Renfrew's recognition of a distinctive Cretan variety of the FAF, the Koumasa type, is of particular interest and importance. Its appearance 16 Metallurgy, pl. 12. 17 Renfrew 19 n. 65. 8S The date of the material in the Tekes deposit is diffi- cult to ascertain, but the metal daggers are probably not earlier than E.M. III and could be as late as M.M. I-II (see K. Branigan, Copper and Bronze Working in Early Bronze Age Crete (Lund, 1968) 15-17).</page><page sequence="6">62 KEITH BRANIGAN should not altogether surprise us, for we have already seen that both the schematic figurines and the FAFs were adopted and modified in Crete from the beginning of the Early Bronze Age. The Koumasa type, however, represents a relatively standardized approach to the modification of the Cycladic figurines, and is notable both for its restricted distribution-confined to Crete- and its relative abundance. Renfrew listed sixteen examples, to which I can add two more, so that it is far commoner in the island than any other variety of FAF. Furthermore, one of the two additions to Renfrew's list is a torso from the Platevolas cave in the far west of the island, so that the distribution of the type now extends from Khania to Siteia, and from Lebena to Pyrgos. The wide distribution of the type and its standardized form might perhaps argue for a late date for it, since in E.M. I and II there were distinctive regional variations of culture which one imagines would have made the development of a standardized type throughout the island unlikely.19 Nevertheless, the Platevolas figurine was found in association with E.M. I burnished pottery and Vasiliki ware of E.M. II, so that the type seems to have originated before the begin- ning of E.M. III. Confirmation of this might be sought in two of the figurines of this type found at Lebena (IVE 12 and 13) both of which were discovered in association with E.M. II pottery. Alexiou, however, claims that no E.M. III pottery occurs at Lebena, so that the E.M. II pottery here could, perhaps, be contemporary with E.M. III at Gournia and elsewhere in the east of the island.20 Even though Zoes has demonstrated that E.M. III pottery does occur in southern Crete,21 it is there in relatively small quantities, and some E.M. II pottery styles and types may have continued in use alongside the new white-on-dark pottery. That some of the Koumasa figurines are of E.M. III date is suggested perhaps by their appearance in the Tekes group, for which an E.M. III-M.M. IA date seems most likely. On the other hand, the original context and associations of this group are uncertain, and too much reliance cannot be placed on the evidence they provide. The contexts of two other examples of the Koumasa type may, however, be of some help in establishing the type's chronology. The small figurine from Pyrgos (IVE 7) was found in E.M. I and E.M. III associations, and it is most unlikely that the Koumasa variety developed as early as E.M. I! One of the figurines from Koumasa was found in the small rectangular enclosure T'. The other objects recorded from this enclosure are a knife, a razor, three imported silver daggers, and two kernoi, all of which may be safely ascribed to a date not earlier than E.M. III.zz Those Koumasa FAFs found in contexts for which a reasonably narrow dating range can be established therefore suggest that the type was first developed during E.M. II, when trade within the Aegean grew rapidly;23 but they continued in use, and very probably in production, during E.M. III. The origins of the Koumasa type remain obscure. Typologically the Koumasa group are nearest perhaps to the Dokathismata type, but since the best dated examples of the latter are the two from grave 14 at Dokathismata itself, probably belonging to an advanced and late phase of the Keros-Syros culture, it seems that the two types probably appeared at about the same time as one another. The Dokathismata type figurine from Tekes mentioned above demonstrates that the two types certainly overlapped chronologically. One imagines that the Kea and Chalandriani types (IVD and IVC respectively) must belong to the same phase of typological development, since they too are rather flat figurines with angular shoulders. If this is correct, then the remain- ing varieties which may have been ancestral to these developed types are the Spedos and Kapsala 19 See Foundations, chapters 2, 8, Io. 20 S.

Of these, the Spedos type is the more likely to have been ancestral to the four 'flat' figurine types, if only because it had a much wider distribution than the Kapsala type. There are, however, one or two typological features of the Spedos group which also suggest it is more closely related to the Koumasa, Dokathismata, Kea, and Chalandriani types than is the Kapsala variety. These features may be summarized as follows: a head which is often at its broadest at the crown, shoulders which are wider than the hips, rounded breasts, and occasional representation of the pubic triangle by incisions. These are features common to all four of the 'flat' figurine types but not found at all on the Kapsala variety. Even if one feels reasonably satisfied that the Koumasa type was an indigenous Cretan develop- ment from the Spedos variety, which was apparently imported and perhaps copied in the island, it is still difficult to understand the process by which such a standardized type appeared throughout the island with so few transitional figurines to document the development. There are the Dokathismata figurine from Tekes, with its Koumasa type body, and the rather flat Spedos figurine from the Ay. Onouphrios deposit, but these are the only hybrid or transitional types yet published. The Tekes assemblage contained two rudely carved figurines which Ren- frew suggests were contemporary copies of the Koumasa type.24 One could argue that they are transitional figurines, typologically situated between the standardized Koumasa type and the rather less standardized Ay. Onouphrios type, which Renfrew has already suggested may have been influential in the development of the Koumasa variety of FAF.25 This is a particularly interesting suggestion in relation to at least one of the Tekes 'copies', for it shares with the Ay. Onouphrios figurines a comparatively long neck, a head with the mouth indicated, and a rounded, not too angular body. Whether or not we might take the Tekes 'copies' as early examples of the Koumasa type is difficult to decide, and must certainly be considered in the light of our discussions of the Ay. Onouphrios type below. For the moment we may point to one immediate objection to the hypothesis, namely the figurines and daggers associated with the two Tekes figurines, all of which were developed types suggestive of a date in E.M.

Figurines related to the FAF This small and rather varied group is represented in Crete by the seated figurine from Tekes and should perhaps include the rather crude 'twins' from the same deposit, which Renfrew actually catalogues under type IVE (i o). There is little that can be said about either of these pieces, except to note that neither the seated variety nor the double-figurine type has been found outside the Cyclades except in the Tekes deposit.26 Like the silver bangles and pendants from the circular tomb at Krasi, these two figurines might therefore be regarded as particularly clear manifestations of the Cycladic 'province' in northern Crete.27 24 Renfrew 22-3. 25 Renfrew 20. 26 Renfrew 14. 27 Branigan 226.</page><page sequence="8">64 KEITH BRANIGAN V I.

Phylakopi I type Although the schematic figurines of Lebena type bear some resemblance to Renfrew's type VI (Apeiranthos) figurines, no true examples of type VI have yet been found in Crete. This may be because the Minoans had already developed analogous indigenous types which were adopted throughout the island (see below, the Porti, Giophrakia, and Ay. Triadha types). Equally the Phylakopi I type (VII) is unrepresented in Crete but for a single, broken example from Platanos. Nevertheless this is a most interesting find, since the group is in any case a small one, represented at present by a handful of figurines from the eponymous settlement and from Ay. Irini (Kea).2s It is one of the figurines from Kea, K 3.Io7, that provides the closest parallel to the example from Platanos. It seems likely that the Platanos figurine is an actual import from the Cyclades, probably from Melos itself, and the appearance of M.M. IA sherds in Phylakopi II might, perhaps, suggest the period in which the figurine was transported to Crete. Its context at Platanos was equivocal; it was found 'in the earth of tholos A'29 which probably means it was in the covering mound of the tomb, and therefore cannot be confidently dated.30 Phylakopi VII 6.

The FAFs and schematic figurines of Phylakopi type show that the influence exerted in Crete by Cycladic figurine types in Early Bronze I continued and grew during Early Bronze II and III. Just as the Troy I type was produced in a modified Minoan form, so the FAFs were manu- factured in at least one distinctive variety peculiar to Crete. This, the Koumasa type, is a rela- tively schematic variety of the FAF with little attempt to model in the round. One is tempted to place its origin in the north of Crete where Cycladic influences seem strongest in E.M. I and II, but there are several reasons why the Mesara may more confidently be claimed as the region of origin. The rapid development of a standardized type is most likely to have taken place within a region with a distinctive and uniform culture such as only the Mesara and its environs had in E.M. II. It is unlikely that a type developed in the north or east in E.M. II would have been so readily adopted in the south, which at this time was both economically and technologically in advance of the rest of the island.3~ In addition, it is only in the Mesara that we find the two types of figurine which we have tentatively suggested were ancestral to the Koumasa variety, namely the Ay. Onouphrios and Spedos figurines. We may be able to speak of this hypothetical ancestry with more confidence after we have discussed the indigenous Cretan figurine types which include the Ay. Onouphrios group. INDIGENOUS CRETAN FIGURINE TYPES There are five types of Early Bronze Age anthropomorphic figurines found in Crete which are both indigenous to the island and relevant to our discussion. Each of these types I have named after the site which has produced the most characteristic example(s) of the type. 28 Renfrew 24. 29 VTM 122. 30 If Xanthoudides refers to the earth inside the tomb, then the figurine would have come from the upper stratum (the lower produced no figurines) and would date either from E.M. IIB or (more probably) from E.M. III to M.M. IB/IIA. 3" Foundations 204.</page><page sequence="9">CYCLADIC FIGURINES AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 65 The Pyrgos Type (FIG. I, 8) The Pyrgos type is an indigenous Cretan variety of the Brettidolen common in the earlier part of the Aegean Early Bronze Age. It is little more than a developed pebble figurine, for it is formed of a flat pebble or egg-shaped piece of stone, at the broad end of which is a rounded hump, presumably representative of the head. Only four examples are at present known from Crete, all found in the burial deposit at Pyrgos. Unlike the great majority of Aegean Brettidolen, these four figurines were made of slate rather than marble. Their origins appear to lie amongst the Aegean pebble figurines, found in Neolithic levels in the Cyclades;32 and it is probably significant that from the same deposit at Pyrgos came two pebble figurines. A Cretan prototype might conceivably be recognized in the notched pebble figurine from the latest Neolithic levels at Knossos.33 Like the majority of the other Aegean Brettidolen, the Pyrgos figurines may con- fidently be dated to Early Bronze I, although the Pyrgos deposit contained a few items which might date in Early Bronze III.

Though the type is distinctive, the figurines within the group reveal a remarkable variety of detail. The type is characterized by broad, short bodies, tiny legs which are sometimes reduced to a mere notch in the base of the body, and narrow necks supporting a small head which is more often round than spade-shaped. Shoulders vary between the sharply angular (AO I) and the very rounded (AO 4), whilst the head may carry a mouth, a mouth and nose, or no features at all. One of the five extant examples has breasts (AO 4), another shows rolls of fat on the stomach (AO 3), and a third carries the suggestion of folded arms (AO I). The four figurines from the Ay. Onouphrios deposit cannot be dated more closely than Minoan Bronze Age, but the fifth example of the type, from Lebena tomb II, came from a deposit not later than E.M. II. This particular example, with only a small notch to represent the legs and with sloping, rounded shoulders, is of the kind most closely paralleled outside Crete. A complete figurine of somewhat similar type was found in Troy VIIa, but Blegen is surely right in recognizing this (and three celts from the same deposit) as chance survivals-from the Early Bronze Age.34 A fragmentary figurine from Troy III looks as though it may have been a figurine of similar type; and if this is a correct interpretation, it would provide us with a parallel for the Ay. Onouphrios type during the Early Bronze II period.3s Intermittent contact with the Troad throughout the E.M. period is docu- mented by a number of finds from both Crete and Troy,36 and to some extent by the Aegean figurine types we have already discussed above. There is no reason to think, however, that the Ay. Onouphrios type was introduced to Crete from elsewhere in the Aegean. Its origins are admittedly obscure, but one can argue a Cretan origin more plausibly than any other, particularly in view of the type's absence elsewhere in the 32 See above, n. 12. 33 Ucko, fig.

The short, dumpy legs and broad, short bodies are suggestive of a derivation from the standing 'fat ladies' of ? Late Neolithic date, several of which have been found in Crete, mainly in the excavations at Knossos. Two other figurines from Knossos, both of white marble (as are all five of the Ay. Onouphrios type), are of particular interest as possible prototypes of the Ay. Onouphrios figurines. One of these, unknown except from some unpublished drawings by Evans, is clearly derived from the 'fat ladies' themselves,37 retaining short, steatopygous legs. The arms have disappeared, however, and in place of the head and torso there is simply a projection which narrows rapidly from the waist upwards. The legs are very short indeed, and separated from one another only by a small notch at the base. The second figurine from Knossos38 is reputedly of sub-Neolithic date, although whether this was the date which Evans ascribed to it or whether it was actually found in a sub-Neolithic deposit is uncertain. This is an altogether slimmer figurine than the first, but again there is no torso, the legs giving way to a lengthy, narrowing neck. This figurine, like the Ay. Onouphrios type, is almost flat, and it is significant that unlike the majority of the Aegean 'fat ladies', about half of those from Crete are steatopygous only when viewed from front or rear; from the side they are seen to be almost flat. We might thus conjecture that in the Late Neolithic period there were two trends developing amongst the 'fat lady' figurines. One trend was towards a type where the torso and legs were absorbed into a single entity, from which projected a somewhat lengthy and narrowing neck. The other was towards figurines which, whilst not falling into the category of Brettidolen, were nevertheless very flat representations of the human body. Both of these trends would help towards the development of the Ay. Onouphrios type. One feature of the Ay. Onouphrios figurines which cannot easily be traced to an origin in the Neolithic 'fat ladies' is the small but quite distinct head perched on top of the neck. One could perhaps seek the derivation of this feature amongst either the Louros or Plastiras figurines of the Grotta-Pelos culture; but the closest parallels are undoubtedly found amongst the small hybrid Drios B type,39 not only to the small Ay. Onouphrios head with facial features other than the nose delineated, but also to the short body and tiny legs of the Cretan figurines. A relationship of some kind would seem to exist between the Ay. Onouphrios and Drios B types, and the chronological position of the latter would probably suit such a conclusion. Typologically, the Drios B figurines should come at the very end of Early Bronze I in the Cyclades.4o The Ay. Onouphrios type is typologically a little later, and the E.M. II context of the example from Lebena seems to confirm this. There certainly seems to be a chronological overlap between the Ay. Onouphrios type and the FAFs, since AO I appears to imitate the arms folded across the waist, and the body of AO 3 is closely comparable in shape to the figurines of the Koumasa variety. In addition this figurine also carries many rolls of fat on its stomach, as in the Kea variety of FAF, and a suggestion of arms folded across the waist. Nevertheless, these features seem to be additions made to an already established type, so that it appears likely that the Ay. Onouphrios type was developed before the FAF became popular in Crete. This is what the close typological relationship between the Drios B and Ay. Onouphrios types would lead us to expect. If we are right in these assumptions, then we may reasonably claim that the short, dumpy form of the Koumasa variety owes something to the Ay. Onouphrios type, as Renfrew has previously suggested.4I Equally, the hypothesis that the two 'contemporary imitations' from Tekes are in fact representative of the formative period of the Koumasa variety is also strengthened, since we have earlier pointed out the relationship which exists between them and the Ay.

ILN (6 August 1960) fig. 8, right. The Porti Type (FIG. I, 9) The Porti type is an extremely schematic form in which a featureless head surmounts an equally featureless torso. The head is sometimes separated from the torso by a short neck (e.g. Porti 7, Io) but more often is found sunk into the shoulders (e.g. Porti 2, 8, 9). The torso has parallel or nearly parallel sides and comes to a blunt or occasionally (e.g. Porti Io) rounded base. Head and torso are usually of about the same width as each other. In section there is a con- siderable variety of form. Some figurines are elliptical in section (e.g. Porti 5, 6, 9) whilst others are oval and almost round (e.g. Porti I, 2, 4, 8). The figurine purchased at Palaikastro (Porti 7) is unique in having an almost square section. None of the ten extant examples of the type can be closely dated by context or associations. Two of them were purchased (7, 9), and all but one of the remainder were found in associations of E.M. I-M.M. I. The exception is a single example from Pyrgos found in an E.M. I and E.M. III context. Like the other figurines in this deposit (ID I, 2; Pyrgos 1-4), this example is of slate, and in view of the small quantity of E.M. III material present, it is altogether more likely that this figurine, like the others of slate, belongs with the mass of the funerary deposit, datable to E.M. I. There are very few parallels to the Porti type outside Crete. In the Cyclades the nearest approach to the Porti figurines are Renfrew's type VI (Apeiranthos).43 In the Troad, some of the elongated Troy I type figurines approach the shape (but not section form) of the Porti type.44 The origin of the type ultimately lies, one imagines, amongst the pebble figurines, but it is difficult to point to any examples which might belong to the transitional phase of development. One stone figurine reputedly from Neolithic levels at Knossos has a superficial resemblance to the Porti type, but both the markings on the lower half of the figure (indicating that this half represents the legs alone) and the abrupt and broken end to the top half (indicating that a third element, the head, once existed) show that the similarities are misleading.4s At present the only plausible prototypes for the Porti figurines are the figurines of Pyrgos type, themselves descended, it appears, from the pebble figurines.

Like that type, it has a featureless head and a torso which may be elliptical, oval, or almost rounded in section; the head is either sunk into the shoulders, or surmounts a short neck. The features which distinguish the Giophrakia from the Porti type are the shape of the torso, which narrows from the shoulders to end in a slightly rounded point at the base; the shoulders themselves, which are much more sharply defined than are the shoulders of the Porti figurines; and the much smaller head, which is always considerable narrower than the shoulders. One example, Giophrakia 7, is unique in indicating the position of the arms, which are raised to meet between the breasts; this figurine is therefore only tentatively ascribed to the Giophrakia type. This is unfortunate, since Giophrakia 7 is one of the two figurines for which a reasonably narrow date may be proposed, having come from the outer burials of the Ay. Triadha necro- polis which date to M.M. I. That the type was in use in M.M. I is fortunately confirmed by the second example found in a closely datable context, from the eponymous site. The deposit at Giophrakia seems to be a homogenous deposit of M.M. I. None of the other examples of the type can be dated more closely than E.M. I-M.M. I. There is an obvious typological relationship between the Porti and Giophrakia types, and since neither type has any satisfactory parallels outside Crete, there is every reason to think that the relationship between the two is a generic one also. The two types could have developed inde- pendently of each other from a common ancestral type (possibly the pebble and Pyrgos figurines), but it is more probable that the Porti type preceded the Giophrakia type and was ancestral to it. The latter is a more evolved type and, as we shall see, it has a clear relationship to another group of E.M. III/M.M. I figurines, so that its main period of production and usage is probably to be placed in E.M. III/M.M. I, as the two figurines found in M.M. I contexts have already suggested. The Porti type on the other hand can hardly have made its initial appearance later than the end of E.M. I if it is to be related to the pebble and Pyrgos figurines, and the single example from Pyrgos is suggestive of an E.M. I date for the earliest examples. That there was a considerable overlap of the periods during which the two types were in use is likely. One imagines, for example, that the two Giophrakia figurines from Trapeza (5, 6), made of rock crystal and limestone respectively, were probably contemporaries of the three Porti figurines found in the same deposit (4-6), two of which were made of these same materials.

I, 6) At present only two certain, and one possible, examples of this type are known. Although appearing to represent only the head and torso, it is quite distinct from both the Porti and</page><page sequence="13">CYCLADIC FIGURINES AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 69 Giophrakia types. The head is rather angular, featureless, and attached to the body by a distinct neck. Short, stumpy arms project from the shoulders, and below the arms the body narrows to the waist, at which point the representation ceases. These figurines are almost Brettidolen, having flat neck and torso, but a head which is inclined slightly backwards. On Mallia I small rounded breasts are marked in relief. The figurine found at Mallia was found in a deposit of M.M. III-L.M. I, and what appears to be a second, very battered, example was found in later excavations in the Middle and Late Minoan houses. On the basis of these two finds one can clearly argue that this is a Late Bronze Age type, and even the third example of the type, found in the Ay. Onouphrios deposit, could be as late in date. However, all eight of the other figurines from the Ay. Onouphrios deposit have been found to belong to the period E.M. I.-E.M. II, and it would be odd if this ninth figurine from the deposit, made of white marble like its eight companions, should be a full millennium later. Indeed, the use of white marble for all three figurines listed below is sugges- tive of an Early Bronze Age date, since marble was rarely used for figurines after M.M. I. Furthermore we shall see later that marble was most commonly used for figurines in Crete in E.M. I-II, and that even in E.M. III and M.M. I it is relatively rare. Though the origins of the type cannot be accurately determined, it seems to be related to the numerous Cretan squatting figures with stumpy arms, and also perhaps to the Ay. Onouphrios type, where we see the same tendency to minimize or obliterate the legs. Typologically, the Mallia type would seem to belong to E.M. I-II. The only close Aegean parallels for the type, from Troy, are equally suggestive of a date in E.M. I-II, since fragments of what appear to be two very similar figures were found in Troy I.46 The late contexts of the two figurines from Mallia should not be allowed to mislead us; Renfrew has pointed to similarly late contexts for a large number of FAFs and smaller numbers of schematic figurines of Early Bronze Age type at Ay.

As with schematic figurines and FAFs, an examination of the indigenous types reveals that they were developed principally during E.M. I and II. Like so much Early Minoan material, these figurines reveal the imagination and inventiveness of their makers, and it is probably for this reason that it is so difficult to trace the origin of these types. The same factors may perhaps explain the relatively large number of types and the relatively small number of figurines within each type. The Mallia, Ay. Onouphrios, and Pyrgos types are all represented by five or fewer examples, in each case discovered on only one or two sites. The Porti and Giophrakia types, on the other hand, seem to have found wider acceptance, and this is reflected not so much in their numbers as in their distribution. To date they have occurred at nine sites evenly spread over the north, south, and east of the island. In distribution, therefore, they are almost a match for the FAFs of Cycladic derivation; but in purely numerical terms they never seem to have been as popular as were the FAFs, and we must bear in mind that, between them, the Porti and Giophrakia types had a considerably longer period of production than did the FAFs.

CRETAN FIGURINE TYPES DERIVATIVE FROM THE FAFs There are three figurine types found in Crete which appear to be derivatives of the Cycladic FAFs. None of the types is represented by many examples, and each type has a very limited geographical distribution. All are small, even by comparison with the relatively small Koumasa variety of FAF. The Trapeza Type (FIG. I, 12) In the cave at Trapeza were found six bone figurines of identical type, which Pendlebury recognized as deriving from the Cycladic FAFs,48 a suggestion recently supported by Caskey.49 A seventh example was found, much earlier, in the large tholos at Ay. Triadha. All seven have a spade-shaped head which sometimes carries an indication of the mouth and always has a ridge running vertically down the centre of the face. There is scarcely any neck, but the shoulders are well-defined and angular. The arms are folded (right over left) across the waist, so that the torso and arms together present a square form above the waist. Four of the figurines from Trapeza have no feet, but the remaining two examples have short feet which project forwards. In all cases, the legs are broad and show little taper towards the ankles, so that the sides of the figurines run almost parallel from shoulder to foot. None of the figurines can be closely dated from their context. All six examples from Trapeza were found in pockets or deposits containing a mixture of sub-Neolithic to M.M. I material, whilst the Ay. Triadha figurine was in the mixed E.M. I-M.M. I deposit in the tholos. For fixing the approximate date of these figurines we are therefore dependent on establishing as precisely as possible the relationship between them and the FAFs. The relationship between the Trapeza type and the FAFs as a whole is reasonably clear. If one glances at Renfrew's list of the characteristic features of the FAFs,50 one finds that a good many of them are characteristic too of the Trapeza type. There is one variety of the FAF, however, which seems to stand in a particularly close relationship to the Trapeza variety: that is the Chalandriani variety, Renfrew's IVC, of which much of his descriptions5 could be applied to the Trapeza type with equal accuracy. A square body, angular shoulders, broad legs, and a spade-shaped head are common to both groups of figurines, and do not coincide on any other variety of the FAF. But there are closer and more significant parallels than these. It is rarely that the FAFs have the mouth depicted on the head; yet some examples of the Chalandriani variety show a mouth, as do three of the Trapeza figurines.sz Amongst the FAFs, the Chalandriani variety is unique in two respects. It alone has the pubic triangle marked immediately below the arms; and it is the only variety which sometimes shows the right arm folded over the left.s3 Both of these features are also characteristic of the Trapeza figurine type. There is a remarkably good case for tracing the derivation of the Trapeza type from the Chalandriani variety of FAF, but it may be that we should also recognize a Minoan element in the derivation. The depiction of the mouth occurs not only on the figurines of the Chalandriani variety, but also on some of the figurines ofAy. Onouphrios type, on at least one figurine of the 48 Trapeza 86. 49 J.

One could argue, therefore, that the Trapeza type derived these characteristics from FAFs produced in Crete itself, but the Cretan FAFs provide no good parallels for the other unusual features of the Trapeza type. It seems altogether more likely, therefore, that all these characteristics were borrowed from a single source, which can hardly have been any other than the Chalandriani variety. This conclusion suggests the solution to one problem, but presents us with another. If the Trapeza type is derived from the Chalandriani variety, it is unlikely to be earlier than late E.M. II in date, and may more reasonably be ascribed to E.M. III, since the Chalandriani variety itself is thought to have made its appearance only late in Early Bronze II.ss Thus, the date of the Trapeza type is established as E.M. III-M.M. IA. The identification of the Chalandriani variety as the source of derivation is, however, difficult to understand; no Chalandriani figurines have yet been found in Crete, nor is there any great body of evidence to suggest close contact between northern Crete and the Cyclades in E.M. III.s6 Indeed, I have suggested elsewhere that in E.M. III Minoan trade was beginning to seek new markets outside the Aegean.s7 There is thus something of a mystery in the way in which the Chalandriani variety of FAF could have made its impact in northern Crete, and Lasithi in particular, in E.M. III; this is a point to which we must return later. Trapeza I. Trapeza. Sub-Neolithic to M.M. I. Bone. Ht. 5'4 cm. Trapeza, fig. 25, 8. 2. Site, date, material as i. Ht. 3"3 cm.

I, 13) Two certain, and one uncertain, examples of this type have so far been identified. Apart from the figurine from the type site, the other two were found at Ay. Triadha, only 5 km. north of the Siva tholoi; thus these three figurines, like the Trapeza group, may well represent a very localized type. The Siva figurines are all of ivory, and like the Trapeza figurines are notable for their small size. They differ from the Trapeza type in several respects, however. The head is roughly circular and is notable for showing not only eyes, nose, and mouth but ears also. There is little or no neck, narrow but distinct shoulders, and a roughly square body. The legs taper appreciably from the waist. Arms folded across the waist (on the Siva figurine and on one of those from Ay. Triadha) betray the origins of the type. The third figurine, from Ay. Triadha, seems to have had the arms carved from a separate piece of ivory (now lost), and for this reason its identification as conforming to this type is uncertain. The two figurines from Ay. Triadha were found in the large tholos, and cannot therefore be dated more closely than E.M. I-M.M. I.

I-II. The latest material listed as coming from this tomb is of E.M. III date. If we are right in recognizing these figurines as derivative from the Cycladic FAFs, they can hardly appear earlier than E.M. IIB,s8 since all the FAFs found in Crete belong to the more evolved varieties, and the earliest FAFs do not appear until Early Bronze II has begun. Unlike the Trapeza type, there is nothing so distinctive about the Siva type as to identify clearly its FAF prototype(s). We saw a little earlier that the depiction of the mouth is found on a few Cretan examples of the FAF, but the only FAF known to me which depicts the ears, mouth, nose, and eyes is an unusual example of the Chalandriani variety allegedly from Amorgos.59 It is probably futile to attempt to trace the origin of the Siva type from a particular variety of FAF. In the Mesara, where a distinctive culture had emerged during E.M. I, it is more likely that a figurine type derived from the Cycladic FAFs would be a real hybrid. The form of the Cycladic figurines may have been adopted, but the details-like facial features-would be those normally found on Minoan figurines. The FAF variety which we must envisage as providing the immediate inspiration for the Siva type is obviously the Koumasa variety, distinctively Minoan, very popular, and probably itself originating in the Mesara.60 Siva I.

I, I I) This type is represented by five examples from the eponymous site and a further two from Platanos. All those from Ay. Triadha and one from Platanos were made of alabaster, the remaining example being of white limestone. This type has perhaps been the centre of more controversy than any other variety of Early Minoan figurine. The most characteristic features of the Ay. Triadha type are the shape of the legs and torso. Below the waist the figurines taper to a pointed base, whilst above it the torso is short; at its broadest point, the shoulders, it is only a little broader than the hips. The shoulders may be angular or rounded, but the forearms are always represented by a single horizontal line drawn across the waist, suggesting that the figures are portrayed in the folded-arm position. There is usually no recognizable neck, the spade-shaped heads being placed immediately on the shoulders. Facial features are never shown, although some of the figurines have a ridge running vertically down the centre of the face, perhaps suggestive of a nose (e.g. 6). All five of the examples from Ay. Triadha were found in the large tholos and cannot, there- fore, be dated more closely than E.M. I-M.M. I by their associations. Xanthoudides reports, however, that one of the two figurines from Platanos was found inside tholos A at this site. This is useful information, since although this tomb was in use from E.M. II (?) until M.M. II, we know that there were two clearly distinguished strata, the lower of which contained virtually no artefacts at all. The contents of the lower stratum are explicitly mentioned by Xanthoudides 58 The principal grounds on which I distinguish E.M. IIB from E.M. IIA are first, the appearance of white- painted Vasiliki ware; secondly, the complete or almost complete abandonment of the Ay.

It is almost certain, therefore, that one of the two figurines from Platanos (we do not know which) was found in the upper stratum of tholos A. A study of the artefacts found in the upper and lower strata suggests that the former must be dated either E.M. IIB-M.M. II or E.M. III- M.M. II. We have no other evidence from context for the date of the Ay. Triadha type, unless we consider also the E.M. II figurine from Knossos (8) which we have tentatively ascribed to this type. This date is considerably later than what we have been led to expect by the hypothesis, first proposed by Evans, and subsequently supported by Xanthoudides and Pendlebury,62 that the Ay. Triadha type owed its inspiration to a group of Predynastic figurines from Egypt character- ized by pointed bases.63 Whether or not Evans and Xanthoudides intended also to relate the Porti and Giophrakia types to the Egyptian predynastic figurines is uncertain, but the late date of the Giophrakia type presents an insurmountable chronological obstacle to any such relation- ship. There are, in fact, no sound reasons for recognizing a relationship between the Ay. Triadha type and the Predynastic figurines, as Banti long ago pointed out.64 Apart from the pointed base, there are no close similarities between the Cretan and Egyptian types, and we have seen earlier that the pointed base figurines of Crete can probably be traced back to an indigenous origin in EM. I. The development of the Ay. Triadha type would appear to result from the interaction of the influences exerted on the one hand by the Cycladic FAFs, and on the other by the indigenous figurines of Porti and Giophrakia types. The pointed base, distinct shoulders, and small head suggest a close relationship between the Ay. Triadha and Giophrakia types, but in view of the imprecise dating of both, the exact nature of the relationship cannot be established. They may well prove to be parallel and contemporary developments from the earlier Porti type. The Cycladic influence, however, is clear, to some extent revealed in the shape of the head, but more clearly so in the position of the arms, which though very schematically represented can only be recognized as in the folded position. The tapering, short legs of the Koumasa variety of FAF may have facilitated the development of this hybrid type with a tapering base. Ay. Triadha i. Ay. Triadha. E.M. I-M.M. I. Alabaster. Ht. 4-2 cm.

Omitted from the discussion have been the stone and ivory figures of men and women with hands raised to the breasts, and the clay figurines from the peak sanctuaries, which date mainly to M.M. I and later. Of the seventeen types and varieties discussed, only five are claimed to be entirely indigenous, so that Troadic and Cycladic relation- ships can be established for more than two-thirds of the figurine types in use in Early Minoan Crete. At present, however, only two or three figurines can be claimed as actual imports from the Cyclades, and of the twelve types identified as Aegean rather than Minoan in origin, at least six are found in Crete in a modified or adapted form. Thus, though the Minoan repertoire was notably dependent on the Cycladic and Troadic forms for its inspiration, the Minoans made a distinctive contribution to it, producing varieties which were unique to the island. A suggested chronological and typological development, based on the conclusions drawn in the discussion above, is shown in FIG. 2. An analysis of the various materials used for the manufacture of the figurines raises a number of points of interest. Because of the scarcity of well-dated examples, it is difficult to trace chronological variations in material, but nevertheless it is apparent that, after E.M. I-II, marble was little used, and the only stone more plentifully used in E.M. III-M.M. IA than in the preceding periods was alabaster. The Early Minoan figurines were always small by comparison with their Aegean counterparts and there is, of course, a notable lack of evidence for any monumental sculpture in the palatial civilization of Crete. The Minoan interest in miniature sculptures is well represented in the Early Bronze Age, not only by small figurines but also by the splendid zoomorphic and anthropomorphic sealstones and amulets.6s These pieces display infinitely more artistry than do the figurines we have been discussing; and the Minoan ability to work bone and ivory with more success than stone might explain the adoption of the softer materials for a good many of the figurines of E.M. III-M.M. I. Certainly the marked decline in the use of stone, and the equally marked increase in the use of bone and ivory in these periods, tipped the balance further still in favour of miniature sculptures. If we group the figurine types into their three families-indigenous types, Aegean types, and derivative or hybrid types-then other interesting variations in the use of materials become apparent. Almost nine in every ten figurines of Aegean type are produced in marble, whilst although this is still the commonest single material used for indigenous types, other stones together account for almost two-thirds of the material used for them. The derivative or hybrid types, on the other hand, are not of marble at all and are equally divided between stone (ala- baster and limestone) and bone or ivory. The relationship between the derivative types and the use of bone and ivory has already been sought in terms of chronology, but the clear correlation between Aegean types and the use of marble has not yet been explained. Until recently one would simply have said that the Aegean types were actual imports from the Aegean, but this can no longer be maintained. The numerous figurines of the Koumasa variety, and indigenous types made of marble, show that marble was employed for figurines which were made in Crete itself. Indeed, the discovery of a good source of marble near Ay. Nikolaos means that we no longer need to postulate the importation of either figurines or the raw material of which they were made.66 The overwhelming preponderance of marble for figurines of Aegean type must therefore be explained in other ways. There seems to be no chronological difference between these figurines and a good many of the indigenous types oflimestone, slate, rock crystal, and 65 A brief discussion of these is in Foundations 94-7, I42-4. 66 C.

One must conclude therefore that marble was used for the Aegean figurines either because they were thought to possess particular powers by reason of their material, or else simply because the Aegean types were fashionable, and if one could not obtain the genuine article then one at least tried to purchase a good local imitation. That Cycladic fashions were adopted in Crete during E.M. I-II has long been recognized, and the FAFs are the most wide- spread and most immediately recognizable manifestations of this situation. It may be profitable, therefore, to conclude with a short reassessment of cultural contact in the Aegean Early Bronze Age, in the light both of our own and of Renfrew's examinations of the Cycladic figurines and their derivatives. FIGURINES AND CULTURAL CONTACT Dr. Ucko's recent book on Neolithic figurines from Crete and Egypt devoted three chapters to a detailed comparative analysis of the individual features of Cretan, Egyptian, Aegean, and Near Eastern figurines; and on the basis of this analysis he made a reassessment of cultural contact in the central and east Mediterranean in the period before the third millennium B.C.67 An ex- haustive typological analysis of this kind cannot be attempted here; fortunately the typological and generic relationships between the Cretan, Cycladic, and other Aegean figurines seem reasonably clear already. The background against which these relationships should be con- sidered has already been briefly discussed by both myself and Renfrew;68 and we find ourselves in agreement that in Early Bronze II there was a very marked increase in cultural contact within the Aegean, brought about very largely by the advent of metallurgy. On two points, however, I disagree with Renfrew. I believe that metallurgy began, throughout the Aegean, during Early Bronze I, and that cultural contacts were established then that were to provide the basis for the extensive and regular contacts of Early Bronze II.69 Secondly, I believe that in northern Crete we can distinguish what I have previously called the 'Cycladic province' of the island, where Cycladic culture was to some considerable extent adopted by the population.70 I have tentatively proposed that a similar 'province' also existed in Epirus and on Ithaca.7' I have previously identified the Aegean contacts with Crete during E.M. I mainly on the basis of metal objects found in mixed deposits of E.M. I-II, and on the evidence of the 'Pelos' bottles from Pyrgos and early chalices from Knossos. To this evidence we can now, I suggest, add the rather more substantial evidence of the figurines. Early Bronze I examples of Aegean type found in Crete include the pebble, Troy I, and Spade varieties of Brettidolen. The sole example of the last, from Ay. Onouphrios, may well be an actual import. In connection with the proposed 'Cycladic province' in the north of the island, it may be significant that of the five sites producing these early Aegean forms, those at Pyrgos, Arkhalochori, and Trapeza lie in that region. The much-increased contacts of E.M. II are well represented by the figurines, but the nature of the contacts must be reassessed in the light of Renfrew's recognition of the Koumasa variety of FAF and my own discussions of the Minoan figurines derivative from the FAFs of the Cyclades. The popularity of the FAFs in Crete can hardly be disputed, about thirty examples having so far been discovered in the island; but it is now clear that the majority of these are the products of Minoan rather than Cycladic workshops. Both numerically and typologically, the origin of the Koumasa variety may be ascribed to the Mesara, and it is at least possible that all, or nearly all, of the Koumasa figurines were made in the Mesara and ex- ported to other parts of the island. Evidence for trade within the island is difficult to recognize, 67 Ucko, chapters I1-13. 68 Branigan 22 7-8; Foundations I 18 f., 202-4; Metallurgy 15-18. 69 cf.

III vessels of east Cretan type found in northern Crete, and north Cretan vessels of M.M. IA found in east Crete,72 there is reason to think that during E.M. II and III the Mesara may have exported daggers of my type LD. V.73 There are also the steatite 'dog- lid' pyxides found at Ay. Triadha, Mochlos, and Zakro, which, one imagines, must all have come from a single workshop.74 Apart from trade between the various regions of the island, there was also the important trade with the rest of the Aegean. The examination of the evidence provided by the figurines has changed the picture which previously existed. With the recog- nition of the Koumasa variety as a Cretan product, possibly manufactured in the Mesara, the north of the island is stripped of its only Cycladic 'imports'. The Dokathismata figurine from Tekes is a possible exception, but we noted earlier that it showed sufficient affinity to the Koumasa variety to be suspected of a Cretan origin.75 The only figurines found in Early Minoan Crete that can be identified as imports were found in the Mesara. Here we find the Spedos figurine from Koumasa, the spade figurine from Ay. Onouphrios, and the Phylakopi I figurine from Platanos. In addition, one of the fragmentary FAFs from Ay. Onouphrios might also be an imported example of the Spedos variety. It is relevant to recall that the Ay. Onouphrios deposit also contained two Cycladic marble pyxides; and that from Marathokephalon came a jug which is probably of E.C. II type.76 It might thus be argued that if the imported Cycladic objects are found in southern Crete, then it was from there that trade with the Cyclades was principally organized. Whether or not this implies that Minoan objects found in the rest of the Aegean were the products of the Mesara is uncertain. It would be possible to put forward plausible arguments along these lines for the foot amulets found at Ay. Kosmas, Zygouries, and on Despotikon,77 for the bottle seal from Ay. Kosmas,78 the sealstone and sealing from Troy,79 a steatite pyxis from Thera,so and a triangular dagger from Amorgos.8' Only for the stone jug and Vasiliki sherds from Kythera might it be easier to argue an east Cretan origin.8z But the Kythera finds are, of course, the most significant ones, in that they occur on an island which we know to have later become a Minoan 'colony'. Nevertheless, if direct commercial relationships were established with the Greek mainland, the Cyclades, and the Troad during E.M. II, as both Renfrew and myself think they were, then the most likely focus of this trade in Crete would be the Mesara. Technologically and commercially, the communities of the Mesara appear to have been more advanced than either the north or east of the island in E.M. II.83 The 'Cycladic province' in northern Crete now appears to represent a region where Cycladic traditions were prevalent rather than Cycladic trade. Here, in E.M. II, we find no direct imports, but either imitations of the Cycladic material culture in the form of FAFs and silver jewellery,84 or the adoption of Cycladic burial customs represented by the appearance of cist graves at Mochlos and Sphoungaras, and on the east coast at Zakro.8s The cist graves could, of course, date back as early as E.M. I, and the small circular built tomb at Krasi is probably to be recognized as another example of Cycladic influence in the north at the start of the Early Bronze Age in Crete. We noted earlier the finds of schematic figurines of Aegean types of Early Bronze I 72 P. Warren, 'The first Minoan stone vases and Early Minoan chronology', Kret.

I. To the early chalices mentioned above,86 we can add the many examples of the globular, funnel-necked jar or bottle found at Kanli Kastelli, Ay. Photia, Ay. Nikolaos, and other sites in the north and east, and typical of the Grotta-Pelos culture. These bottles cannot be identified as imports from the Cyclades, but their inspiration is clearly Cycladic. Levi's recent excavations on lasos, however, have shown that all the elements described so far could also have had their home along the western sea- board of Anatolia,87 and this is clearly of some interest in view of the chalices which were so popular in northern Crete during E.M. I, and the Troy I figurines from Trapeza, which find few parallels in the Cyclades.88 Connections between northern Crete and the western seaboard of Anatolia may perhaps be traced a little further back, to the very end of the Neolithic period in Crete: they are manifested in the anthropomorphic features of Trapeza ware, and in the rim projections on bowls from Partira and Amnisos recalling Trojan ceramic types.89 The signi- ficance of these Cycladic and west Anatolian elements in the culture of northern Crete in the sub-Neolithic and E.M. I period is difficult to determine, but the tradition which they represent was clearly maintained into E.M. II, when the establishment of regular commercial contact with the Cyclades and western Anatolia no doubt provided a new stimulus for its further pre- servation. If we are right in seeking the impetus for the foundation of Minoan trading interests in Kythera amongst the communities living around the Gulf of Mirabello, then before the end of E.M. II northern connections with the islands of the Aegean would have been strengthened. The remarkably close relationship between the Chalandriani figurines and those of Trapeza type is perhaps to be understood in terms of such developments. At least two of the islands where the Chalandriani variety was in vogue late in Early Bronze II, i.e. Amorgos and Thera, have pro- duced Minoan imports of this periodgo and thus provide points of contact between the Minoan and Cycladic figurine types in question. To conclude, we might briefly consider the vexed question of Aegean contact with the western Mediterranean in the late third millennium B.c. Whereas I believe that such contact existed and to some extent can be documented,o9 Renfrew regards the evidence as entirely unsatisfactory.92 It is not surprising, therefore, to find that he rejects the hypothesis of a relation- ship between the Sardinian and the Cycladic marble figurines.93 He may well be right, but two observations might be borne in mind. Firstly, the Sardinian figurines with pointed basesg* might suggest that the relationship was an indirect one through Crete, where we have identified a Cretan figurine type characterized by this feature but derivative, we think, from the FAFs. Secondly, a connection between Cretan examples of the FAF and the Sardinian examples is perhaps indicated by the occurrence of Sardinian figurines with broken heads mended by the boring of perforations through the ends of the neck.95 This is an unusual feature to which Renfrew has himself drawn attention, occurring as it does amongst figurines of the Koumasa variety and other FAFs found in Crete.96 Neither of these points may be of any significance, but in view of the other evidence which I believe exists for contact between E.M. III Crete and Chalcolithic Italy, they deserve consideration. KEITH BRANIGAN 86 These, of course, point towards Troadic rather than Cycladic connections. 87 The cemetery excavated by Levi has yielded globular funnel-necked bottles, silver jewellery, and cist graves. 88 Renfrew 27 n.
