<plain_text><page sequence="1">INTERPRETING LEGISLATIVE INACTION William N. Eskridge, Jr. * There is a longstanding debate in the theory of statutory interpre- tation over what meaning, if any, can be attributed to the legislature's failure to do something. Issues of "legislative inaction" often arise in cases where the Supreme Court considers the validity of an adminis- trative or judicial interpretation of a statute and the argument is made that the interpretation must be accepted because Congress has acqui- esced in it by not overruling it, has ratified it by reenacting the statute, or at some point was presented with a formal bill or amendment em- bodying an alternative interpretation and rejected it.1 The Court has grappled with such arguments since the nineteenth century,2 often- times finding inaction arguments persuasive but other times finding them unappealing. The debate within the Court over the significance of legislative inaction has intensified in the last two Terms,3 in large * Associate Professor of Law, Georgetown University Law Center. - Ed.

As the quotation marks suggest, "legislative inaction" is a term of art widely used in Supreme Court opinions and law review articles for the phenomena described in the text. But, obviously, for each phenomenon - acquiescence, reenactment, rejection - Congress (or a sub- group in Congress) is engaged in "action" as well. And the phenomena discussed in this article do not exhaust the occasions for which Congress' failure to act has doctrinal significance. 2. See, e.g., United States v.

These arguments may be tested early in the 1988 Term. The Court has requested briefs in Patterson v. McLean Credit Union,4 to address the question whether the Court's decision in Runyon v. McCrary5 should be overruled. Runyon interpreted section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (now section 1981)6 to prohibit private discrimination in contractual relations. In Patterson, four Justices sharply dissented from the request for further briefs on what they considered a settled question. The dissenting Justices relied, in part, upon Congress' fail- ure to overturn the Court's line of decisions interpreting the 1866 Act to cover private discrimination.7 The briefs for petitioner and several supporting amici strongly rely on several legislative inaction argu- ments.8 Patterson, therefore, presents the Court with a clear opportu- nity to make sense of its legislative inaction precedents, perhaps with an eye on Justice Scalia's critique. Patterson also provides commentators with an opportunity to re- visit the Court's theory and practice in legislative inaction cases. Tra- ditionally, scholars have been skeptical of the Court's inconsistent use of legislative inaction and have argued that "almost no reliable infer- ence of [legislative] intent could be drawn" from the legislature's si- lence or inaction.9 However, there has also been some scholarly 107 S.

DICKERSON, THE INTERPRETATION AND APPLICATION OF STATUTES 181 (1975); see</page><page sequence="3">Interpreting Legislative Inaction defense of a limited use of legislative inaction as an interpretive tool.10 The purpose of this article is to contribute to the doctrinal and theoretical debate about the meaning of legislative inaction for the statutory interpreter. I hope to make three contributions. Part I offers a doctrinal starting point for analyzing legislative inaction issues gen- erally and those in Patterson in particular. Three related doctrines emerge from the Court's past treatment of legislative inaction issues: (1) the "acquiescence rule," positing that if Congress does not over- turn a judicial or administrative interpretation it probably acquiesces in it; (2) the "reenactment rule," which posits that a reenactment of the statute incorporates any settled interpretations of the statute by courts or agencies; and (3) the "rejected proposal rule," which posits that proposals rejected by Congress are an indication that the statute cannot be interpreted to resemble the rejected proposals. These rules are not inevitably followed, though. In some cases, the Court finds great meaning in "positive inaction."1 In other cases the Court finds such an inquiry nothing more than "the pursuit of a mirage."12 Still, the reasoning of the cases seeks, with some success, to suggest coher- ence. Generally, when the Court finds meaning in Congress' inaction, it points to specific legislative consideration of the issue and, either implicitly or explicitly, indicates that Congress' failure to act bespeaks a probable intent to reject the alternative(s). Thus, I think there is a little more coherence to the Court's ap- proach to legislative inaction than most commentators have found. The Court's reasoning is an intelligent, practical effort to fit the legisla- ture's inaction into what the Court perceives as its general mandate to respect legislative intent when it interprets statutes. The question re- mains, however, whether legislative inaction really does tell the Court, or us, anything about legislative intent in these cases. The answer de- pends very much on what one means by "legislative intent." Part II argues that if one means the actual collective will or desire of the en- H. HART &amp; A.

Assuming this view of legislative intent, I agree with and elaborate upon Justice Scalia's critique of the Court's frequent invoca- tion of legislative inaction. Part III argues that the cases make more sense if we read them as decisions about presumed, rather than actual, legislative intent. Like other legal doctrines drawing inferences from inaction, the various leg- islative inaction doctrines are policy presumptions having this general message: When Congress enacts a statute that implicitly or explicitly delegates lawmaking authority to courts, agencies, or the executive, "building block interpretations" by the courts, agencies, or executive are presumptively correct if Congress does not disturb them. A build- ing block interpretation of the statute is one that is authoritative or settled and has given rise to public or private reliance interests. Hence, there is no presumption of correctness for interpretations that are not authoritative (e.g., a single lower court decision), or have not been treated as reliable building blocks for private conduct or public policy. The presumption of correctness can be rebutted by clear evi- dence that the building block interpretation is inconsistent with the statutory language and policies. At first blush, the proposition staked out in Part III seems like an unusual approach to statutory interpretation, but I argue that its pre- sumption is quite consistent with other widely accepted practices and doctrines in statutory interpretation, especially clear statement rules. More importantly, a presumption or clear statement approach has the substantial virtue of explaining the Court's own legislative inaction precedents better than the "actual intent" or "collective will" proposi- tion does. While I think my explanation of the legislative inaction cases describes what the Court is doing pretty well, I have several nor- mative problems with the cases. My general problem is that the cases overemphasize what I call "vertical continuity," that is, the persever- ance of an interpretation over time. And the cases underemphasize "horizontal continuity," that is, the coherence of rules and policies at any given time. As the Court applies the lessons of the legislative inac- tion cases, it ought to be mindful of the need for law to evolve. Patter- son is a classic case for application of the presumed intent of the case law and is not subject to this normative problem. I. THE SUPREME COURT'S LEGISLATIVE INACTION CASES AND THEIR LEGAL PROCESS REASONING The legislative inaction cases decided by the Supreme Court in the post-World War II era can be generally divided into three categories: 70 [Vol. 87:67</page><page sequence="5">Interpreting Legislative Inaction the "acquiescence cases," in which the Court concludes that Congress' failure to overturn a judicial or administrative interpretation is evi- dence that Congress has acquiesced in that interpretation of the stat- ute; the "reenactment cases," where the acquiescence argument is buttressed by reenactment of the interpreted statute without material change; and the "rejected proposal cases," in which the Court infers from the rejection of a bill or amendment by Congress, or by a cham- ber or committee of Congress, that an interpretation similar to the rejected proposal is excluded from the statute. There are also many cases where the Court has refused to draw these inferences from Con- gress' failure to respond, its reenactment of a statute, or its rejection of a proposal. Three appendices to this article list post-1961 Supreme Court decisions accepting or refusing to accept these arguments. Overall, the cases suggest that the Court does not lightly rely upon inaction as the primary basis for its decisions in statutory interpreta- tion cases and that the Court will usually justify reliance on legislative inaction by pointing to Congress' awareness of the interpretative issue, and some deliberation about it. In contrast, when the Court refuses to credit significance to legislative inaction, it will usually point to Con- gress' inattention to the issue. In this part, I shall survey each line of cases and explain how they fit together by using the legal process ratio- nales generally suggested by the Court. The discussion of each rule (acquiescence, reenactment, rejected proposal) will conclude with its application in Patterson, for all three types of inaction arguments can reasonably be made in that case. A. The Acquiescence Rule The leading acquiescence case is Apex Hosiery Co. v. Leader,13 which held that labor unions are not wholly excluded from coverage of the Sherman Act. Judicial interpretations of the antitrust laws had originally extended those laws to cover union activity in a broad range of cases. Although legislative amendments to the statutes narrowed that range, Apex Hosiery held not only that Congress had not over- ruled the early cases, but that Congress had fortified them. "The long time failure of Congress to alter the Act after it had been judicially construed ... is persuasive of legislative recognition that the judicial construction is the correct one," the Court concluded. "This is the more so where, as here, the application of the statute to labor unions has brought forth sharply conflicting views both on the Court and in Congress, and where after the matter has been fully brought to the 13. 310 U.S. 469 (1940). 71 October 1988]</page><page sequence="6">Michigan Law Review attention of the public and the Congress, the latter has not seen fit to change the statute."14 The Apex Hosiery principle shows up in many Supreme Court decisions interpreting statutes, though the Court typi- cally exercises caution when invoking its acquiescence rule. A recent application of the acquiescence rule is Flood v. Kuhn, 15 which also involved interpretation of the Sherman Act. In Federal Baseball Club v. National League, 16 the Court held that baseball in the 1920s was not subject to the Sherman Act because its "exhibitions" were "purely state affairs" and not directly involved in interstate com- merce, as required by the Act.17 In the ensuing decades, of course, baseball grew into a highly popular interstate business. Yet the Court in Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc.18 refused to overrule Federal Baseball, in part because "Congress has had the ruling under consider- ation but has not seen fit to bring such business under these laws by legislation having prospective effect."19 In the 1950s and 1960s, after Toolson, baseball continued its interstate growth, adding lucrative tele- vision contracts to its other interstate dimensions. This made Federal Baseball an increasingly anomalous opinion - especially after the Court applied the Sherman Act to other professional sports.20 The Court in Flood again reconsidered Federal Baseball and, again, refused to overrule it, primarily relying on the "positive inaction" of Con- gress.21 In particular, the Court noted that between 1957 and 1965 more than fifty bills were introduced to deal with the issue; that even after extensive consideration and hearings (two of the bills passed one house of Congress), none of the bills became law; and that most of the bills would have expanded rather than contracted antitrust immu- nity.22 Based upon this evidence, the Court concluded that "Congress as yet has had no intention to subject baseball's reserve system to the reach of the antitrust statutes."23 The precept that Congress by its positive inaction can incorporate a judicial interpretation into statutory law is sometimes cited by the 14. 310 U.S. at 488-89. 15. 407 U.S. 258 (1972). 16. 259 U.S. 200 (1922). 17. 259 U.S. at 208. 18. 346 U.S. 356 (1953) (per curiam). 19. 346 U.S. at 357. 20.

Bob Jones University v. United States 26 is a significant acquiescence case for executive department interpretations. The Court held that the income tax exemption for "[c]orporations ... organized and operated exclusively for religious, charitable . . . or educational purposes"27 does not apply to educational institutions that discriminate on the ba- sis of race. The primary ground for the Court's holding was that per- mitting a tax exemption for educational institutions discriminating on the basis of race would be fundamentally at odds with our national policy against racial discrimination and the statute's overall purpose.28 In support of its decision, the Court emphasized legislative acquies- cence in this interpretation of the statute, first voiced by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) in 1970. The Court observed: "Nonaction by Congress is not often a useful guide, but the nonaction here is significant."29 To begin with, the IRS position became the focus of prolonged public debate and congressional hearings (the first of which was held only a month after the IRS announced the interpretation in 1970). At least thirteen bills were introduced in Congress to overturn the IRS interpretation, yet none even emerged from committee, even though other amendments to the charitable exemption provision were passed in 1976. "It is hardly conceivable that Congress . . . was not abun- dantly aware of what was going on. In view of its prolonged and acute awareness of so important an issue, Congress' failure to act on the bills 24. See, e.g., United States v. Johnson, 107 S.

October 1988] 73</page><page sequence="8">Michigan Law Review proposed on this subject provides added support for concluding that Congress acquiesced in the IRS rulings."30 Most importantly, the Court emphasized that "Congress affirmatively manifested its acquies- cence" by enacting a new provision that denies tax-exempt status to social clubs discriminating on the basis of race.31 The new provision filled a gap in the IRS anti-discrimination policy, created when a three-judge court held that discriminatory social clubs could still re- ceive tax exemptions. And the committee reports for the amendment strongly endorsed the IRS policy against racial discrimination, stating that "discrimination on account of race is inconsistent with an educa- tional institution's tax exempt status."32 The Court believed this lan- guage all but endorsed the IRS rule set forth in 1970.33 As in Bob Jones, the Court will often find that congressional failure to disapprove of executive department regulations, while "not disposi- tive . . . strongly implies that the regulations accurately reflect con- gressional intent."34 The inference is even stronger in the foreign affairs arena, where the executive has special competence; the Court will routinely infer legislative approval of executive practices, where "Congress has consistently failed to object to [such interpretations or practices] . . . even when it has had an opportunity to do so."35 The Court draws similar inferences from interpretations by independent agencies. It will attribute significance to legislative inaction "once an agency's statutory construction has been 'fully brought to the atten- tion of the public and the Congress,' and the latter has not sought to alter that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects."36 30. 461 U.S. at 600-01. 31. 461 U.S. at 601 (citing Act of Oct. 20, 1976, Pub.

The leading case is Helvering v. Hallock,37 which overruled several Supreme Court precedents interpreting an es- tate tax provision of the Internal Revenue Code. The acquiescence argument in the case was a strong one: Not only had Congress failed to change the provision to overrule those precedents, but it had amended related estate tax provisions, including other subsections of the same Code section, to respond to other Supreme Court prece- dents.38 Nonetheless, the Court overruled the precedent. "It would require very persuasive circumstances enveloping Congressional si- lence to debar this Court from re-examining its own doctrines. To explain the cause of non-action by Congress when Congress itself sheds no light is to venture into speculative unrealities."39 When the Court follows Hallock, it generally pays lip service to the acquiescence rule and emphasizes procedural reasons why legislative inaction is not particularly cogent. One strategy is to show that Con- gress was not aware of the judicial or administrative interpretation and, therefore, could not be charged with any form of approval by its failure to overturn it. For example, in Zuber v. Allen,4' the Court rejected the Department of Agriculture's apparent interpretation of the Agricultural Milk Marketing Act of 1937, to exempt "nearby farmers" from the uniform pricing contemplated by the Act. The Court had some nasty things to say about the inaction argument but confined them to a footnote.41 Its main reason for rejecting the argu- ment was the ambiguity of the Department's position and the clear evidence that, whatever the Department's position was, Congress had never been made aware of it nor been given a meaningful chance to express disapproval.42 There are numerous cases where the Court fol- lows this first, highly popular, strategy of explaining away legislative inaction by reference to Congress' ignorance of the prior interpreta- Service Commission); CBS, Inc. v.

An important case is Monell v. Department of Social Services,45 which overruled the Court's earlier decision immunizing local governments from lawsuits pursuant to sec- tion 1983.46 Congress had considered several bills to overrule the pre- cedent, but the Court rejected any acquiescence argument, in part because it would be "inconsistent with recent expressions of congres- sional intent."47 That is, when Congress passed laws authorizing grants to school boards and other local governmental bodies to assist in compliance with federal court decrees, it tacitly recognized that school boards and other local bodies were often defendants in section 1983 actions.48 And the Senate report to the Civil Rights Attorneys Fees Awards Act of 1976 (the Fees Act)49 explicitly recognized that "defendants in [section 1983] cases are often State or local bodies" and that those defendants ought in appropriate cases to pay counsel fees for prevailing plaintiffs.50 A third strategy for avoiding the acquiescence rule is to contend that subsequent legislative inactivity cannot ratify a clearly erroneous prior interpretation. A significant recent case illustrating this excep- tion is Aaron v. SEC. 5 The issue was whether the SEC had to estab- lish scienter as a necessary element in an injunction action to enforce the anti-fraud rule. The Court held that scienter was necessary, based upon the reasoning of Ernst &amp; Ernst v. Hochfelder, 52 which had held that a private party seeking damages under the anti-fraud rule had to prove scienter. This seems logical enough, but the SEC had a particu- 43. See, e.g., Rowan Cos. v.

Namely, both before and after Hochfelder, the SEC and lower federal courts had interpreted the statute not to require scienter for injunction actions, and the agency and the courts developed logical policy reasons for such a distinc- tion.53 In 1975, Congress revised the securities laws and added a pro- vision preventing consolidation of public and private anti-fraud actions, apparently because of the potentially different scienter re- quirements. Hearings in 1977 focused on the scienter issue and ex- pressed general legislative approval of the position taken by the SEC and the lower courts.54 The Court's only response to these arguments, contained in a footnote, was that "since the legislative consideration of those statutes was addressed principally to matters other than that at issue here, it is our view that the failure of Congress to overturn the Commission's interpretation falls far short of providing a basis to sup- port a construction of ? 10(b) so clearly at odds with its plain meaning and legislative history."55 To apply the precepts of these acquiescence cases to Patterson, con- sider the following chronology. In 1968, the Supreme Court held in Jones v. Alfred H. Mayer Co.56 that section 1982's57 prohibition of dis- crimination in the sale or rental of property applies to private as well as public conduct. Since section 1982 is also (apparently) taken from section 1 of the 1866 Civil Rights Act, lower courts between 1968 and 1972 all but unanimously interpreted section 1981 to apply to discrim- ination in private contract matters.58 Congress was well aware of this stream of lower court decisions, for when it was considering the 1972 amendments to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, it rejected efforts to make Title VII the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination.59 Then, in three decisions between 1972 and 1976, the Supreme Court explicitly held that section 1981 applies to private contracts.60 Soon after the Court's decision in Runyon, Congress enacted the Fees Act of 53.

And like Bob Jones: "Congress affirma- tively manifested its acquiescence,"67 not only by rejecting proposals to overturn the interpretation, but by building on the interpretation in the Fees Act. For substantially the same reasons, Patterson does not seem to fall under any of the three exceptions to the acquiescence rule.68 B. The Reenactment Cases In many of the acquiescence cases, including Apex Hosiery, the Court has emphasized that Congress' inaction was meaningful because Congress had focused on the statute and actually amended it.

There have been a number of cases throughout the century in which the Court has held that "the reenactment by Congress, without change, of a statute which had previously received long continued ex- ecutive [or judicial] construction, is an adoption by Congress of such construction."70 The leading recent articulation of the rule is the Court's statement in Lorillard v. Pons:71 "Congress is presumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change."72 Although the Lorillard principle shows up in many Supreme Court opinions and seems more procedurally attractive than the bare acqui- escence rule, it too is rather cautiously invoked by the Court. The rule is rarely the primary basis for the Court's decision, and when it is the primary basis, the Court often seeks to reassure itself that Congress actually was (or must have been) aware of the existing interpretations when it reenacted the provision in question. An illustrative case is United States v. Board of Commissioners of Sheffield, Alabama.73 Sec- tion 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 provides for Department of Justice preclearance of specified electoral changes for "a State or polit- ical subdivision" covered by section 4 of the Act.

The Court's main argument was that the Attor- ney General, charged with enforcing the statute, had long interpreted preclearance to apply to municipalities and school districts and that Congress had reenacted the Act in 1970 and 1975, without changing section 5 to overrule that interpretation. "When a Congress that re- enacts a statute voices its approval of an administrative or other inter- pretation thereof, Congress is treated as having adopted that interpre- tation, and this Court is bound thereby."74 The Court was sensitive to the argument that "it is impermissible to draw inferences of approval from the unexplained inaction of Congress,"75 but responded that Congress was fully aware of the Attorney General's interpretation and approved of it. For example, in 1975 an Assistant Attorney General testified explicitly about his Department's policy in House and Senate hearings, and several other witnesses directly or indirectly assumed that the Department's policy was settled.76 Not only was this view reflected in comments even of opponents to the 1975 extension, but also the House and Senate committee reports explicitly contemplated that the preclearance requirement would apply to municipalities and school districts.77 As it did in Sheffield, the Court may elevate executive department interpretations of statutes into settled meaning if Congress has not only reenacted the statute, but also was aware of the executive inter- pretation and seemed not unhappy with the interpretation.78 The same principle applies to interpretations by independent agencies. "When the statute giving rise to the longstanding interpretation has been re-enacted without pertinent change, the 'congressional failure to revise or repeal the agency's interpretation is persuasive evidence that the interpretation is the one intended by Congress.'

In Snyder v. Harris,8' the issue was whether separate claims presented by various claimants in a class action could be aggregated to provide the $10,000 amount in controversy required under the diver- sity jurisdiction statute.82 A long line of Supreme Court decisions had interpreted the statute not to allow aggregation, but the class argued that the approach taken by these decisions was impractical and unnec- essarily grudging, especially in light of new developments in class ac- tions. The Court rejected this argument, based upon a cautious invocation of the reenactment rule. "There are no doubt hazards and pitfalls involved in assuming that re-enactment of certain language by Congress always freezes the existing judicial interpretation of statutes involved," but the Court was persuaded that the reenactment rule was applicable, because it believed the "settled judicial interpretation of 'amount in controversy' was implicitly taken into account" by Con- gress.83 Congress had deliberated about the amount in controversy and raised the amount three times in the last century,84 each time re- enacting the diversity statute otherwise intact. Surely, the Court sup- posed, Congress must have given thought to the established nonaggregation rule.85 Like the acquiescence rule, the reenactment rule is not always fol- lowed, and the three strategies for avoiding the acquiescence rule are also used to avoid the reenactment rule. The leading case is Girouard v. United States. 86 Girouard held that the Nationality Act of 1940 did not require an alien to take an oath to bear arms for this country in order to obtain citizenship. A dissenting opinion by Chief Justice Harlan Stone, the author of Apex Hosiery, relied on prior Supreme (1986); Bloomer v. Liberty Mut. Ins. Co., 445 U.S. 74, 85 (1980); Owen Equip. &amp; Erection Co. v. Kroger, 437 U.S. 365, 374 n.16 (1978); Douglas v. Seacoast Prods., Inc., 431 U.S. 265, 278-79 (1977); United States v. American Bldg.

Although the Chief Justice had not joined the earlier precedents, he felt bound by them, since Congress had "adopted" them; not only had Congress failed to amend the Nationality Act in response to public efforts to overrule the decisions, it had, instead, reenacted the provision without change in 1940.87 The Court rejected the reenactment argument, us- ing language identical to that ofHallock "'It would require very per- suasive circumstances enveloping Congressional silence to debar this Court from reexamining its own doctrines,'" the Court reasoned. "It is at best treacherous to find in congressional silence alone the adop- tion of a controlling rule of law."s88 More persuasive for the Court than Congress' inaction in 1940 was Congress' action in 1942, when Congress specifically amended the Nationality Act to permit noncom- batants to become citizens. The Court concluded that "the affirmative action taken by Congress in 1942 negatives any inference that other- wise might be drawn from its silence when it reenacted the [statute] in 1940."89 Girouard represents one strategy for avoiding the reenactment rule; as in Monell, Congress acted as though the prior judicial inter- pretation was not settled law. Two other strategies for avoiding the reenactment rule are illustrated by the Court's decision in Leary v. United States.90 The Court invalidated the transfer tax provision of the Marihuana Tax Act91 on the ground that they required defendant, Dr. Timothy Leary, to supply the government with self-incriminating information. The government sought to sidestep this constitutional difficulty by claiming that the registration requirements of the statute were only applicable to persons engaged in legal use of marihuana; it relied upon administrative regulations to this effect, and implicit legis- lative approval of those regulations when Congress reenacted the stat- ute in 1954. The Court rejected this use of the reenactment rule, primarily because the Court found it patently unsupported by the stat- utory language and the legislative history. Although "congressional re-enactment of a statute, even without any apparent knowledge of a particular regulation, can 'strengthen to some extent' the regulation's claim to validity . . . re-enactment cannot save a regulation which 'contradict[s] the requirements' of the statute itself."92 This represents 87. 328 U.S. at 73-76 (Stone, C.J., dissenting). 88. 328 U.S. at 69 (quoting Hallock, 309 U.S. at 119). 89. 328 U.S. at 70. 90. 395 U.S. 6 (1969). 91. 26 U.S.C. ?? 4741-4746 (repealed 1970). 92. 395 U.S. at 24-25 (quoting Massachusetts Trustees of Eastern Gas &amp; Fuel Assoc. v.

Leary also rejected the reenactment rule because the Court was doubtful that the government's interpretation was in fact the "long- standing interpretation" of the Act by the agencies charged with en- forcing it.93 This represents the third strategy for getting around the reenactment rule: Congress cannot be presumed to "know" an admin- istrative interpretation that is unsettled even in the minds of the ad- ministrators. Rodriguez v. Compass Shipping Co.94 illustrates this exception in connection with prior judicial interpretations. A unani- mous Court held that Congress' thorough overhaul of the Longshore- men and Harborworkers Compensation Act in 1972 did not implicitly codify a decision of the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals which permitted longshoremen to sue third parties, and not just their immediate employers, once it became clear the employers would not sue the third parties.95 The Court found that the earlier interpretation was inconsistent with both the language and purpose of the 1972 stat- ute and that the single lower court decision was not the "well-estab- lished" interpretation that Congress should be presumed to know.96 Probably for this reason, the Court often will not incorporate lower court decisions into a statute through the reenactment rule.97 Under these reenactment cases, the Fees Act of 1976 significantly buttresses the acquiescence argument in Patterson. The statute itself provides counsel fees for prevailing plaintiffs in cases brought under sections 1981, 1982, and 1983 of title 42.98 Section 1983 provides a remedy for persons discriminated against by state actors, and sections 1981 and 1982 - as interpreted in Runyon and Alfred H. Mayer - provide a substantially parallel remedy for persons discriminated 93. 395 U.S. at 25. 94. 451 U.S. 596 (1981). 95. Potomac Elec. Power Co. v. Wynn, 343 F.2d 295 (D.C.

Overruling Runyon would render section 1981 largely repetitious of section 1983,99 a result at odds with the text of section 1988. Indeed, the Senate report suggested that the main reason sections 1981 and 1982 were included was to assure that plain- tiffs pursuing lawsuits against private discrimination would have coun- sel fee incentives similar to those of plaintiffs suing under Titles VII and VIII of modern civil rights laws.100 The House report and floor statements by Representative Drinan (the House manager of the bill) and Senator Tunney (the Senate manager) also expressed congres- sional understanding and approval of the Supreme Court's interpreta- tion of section 1981.101 This brief history of the Fees Act suggests that the reenactment cases support the legislative inaction argument in Patterson. The Lorillard precept that "Congress is presumed to be aware of [a] judi- cial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change"102 seems applicable, even though the Fees Act only referred to section 1981 and did not reenact it. As in Sheffield, committee reports and floor debate amplify the inference that Congress understood the implications of Runyon and incorpo- rated its holding in section 1988.

Such a ruling would not render the section entirely redundant. For example, ? 1981 has been interpreted to cover federal contractual matters, e.g., Bowers v.

Moody. 05 One issue in the case was whether backpay could be awarded to those unnamed members of a Title VII class action who had not themselves filed charges with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC). The Court held that such relief could be awarded in a class action, even though EEOC charges are normally a prerequisite to ob- taining such relief in ordinary lawsuits. The Court noted that all the circuit courts addressing the issue had so held, and concluded that the Congress "ratified" those cases when it amended Title VII in 1972.106 The House version of the 1972 amendment would have barred backpay to class members who had not filed charges. The Senate passed a bill without the House provision, based upon its committee recommendation, which in turn relied on and cited the circuit court opinions. The conference committee adopted the Senate version and specifically rejected the House provision. From this evidence, the Court concluded that the backpay issue was settled.'07 As in most of the rejected proposal cases, the rejection in Albemarle Paper was made by a subsequent Congress, not the one ac- tually passing the statute being interpreted.

The conference committee for the 1947 Act rejected a provision in the House bill that would have made the Norris-LaGuardia Act inapplicable to suits brought to enforce section 301 duties.l' "When the repeal of a highly significant law is urged upon [Congress] and that repeal is rejected after careful consideration and discussion, the normal expectation is that courts will be faithful to their trust and abide by that decision.""2 Albemarle Paper and Sinclair illustrate the Court's willingness to find significance in a conference committee's rejection of a specific pro- vision; such rejection "strongly militates against a judgment that Con- gress intended a result that it expressly declined to enact."113 The Court may also infer meaning from the rejection of a specific proposal or interpretation by one chamber of Congress: "There could hardly be a clearer indication of congressional agreement" with one interpreta- tion than one chamber's rejection of a proposal to change the settled interpretation.114 In North Haven Board of Education v. Bell,115 for example, the Court interpreted Title IX of the Education Amend- ments of 1972,116 which prohibits sex discrimination in federally funded or assisted programs, to include employment discrimination.

Congress voted down the resolutions, and the Court found the rejection significant evidence that Congress believed Title IX includes employment discrimination.'17 In North Haven Board of Education, the rejected proposal rule reinforced the acquiescence rule, but in other cases the Court has found significance in one chamber's rejection of amendments or proposed language, even when there has been no judicial or agency interpretation in the background.118 Finally, the Court will sometimes rely upon the rejection of pro- posed legislation by congressional committees.119 The leading case is Blue Chip Stamps v. Manor Drug Stores.120 The Court held that pri- vate parties may not sue those making a stock offering for fraud under the securities laws when the claimants have neither purchased nor sold any of the offered shares. The primary argument made by the Court rested upon the acquiescence rule and the rejected proposal rule.'21 The Second Circuit in Birnbauin v.

For example, Monell overruled Monroe v. Pape,126 which had in- terpreted section 1983 not to apply to municipalities. Monroe's main argument was that the Congress enacting the Civil Rights Act of 1871 rejected an amendment that would have subjected municipalities to liability for damage done by private persons "riotously and tumultu- ously assembled." Monell demonstrated the irrelevance of that inac- tion by arguing that the amendment was rejected, not because it imposed liability on municipalities, but because it held them responsi- ble for the acts of private citizens and, hence, carried respondeat supe- rior too far.127 Another case refusing to rely upon rejected proposals is NLRB v. Catholic Bishop of Chicago.128 The Court held that the National La- bor Relations Act (NLRA) does not give the National Labor Rela- tions Board (NLRB) jurisdiction over educational institutions that are associated with a religious denomination and teach secular as well as religious subjects. The dissenting opinion relied upon two rejected proposal arguments. First, when the NLRA was amended by the LMRA in 1947, the conference committee rejected a House provision that would have precluded NLRB jurisdiction over religiously associ- ated educational institutions.129 Second, when the NLRA was amended in 1974 to repeal the exclusion of nonprofit hospitals, the Senate rejected an amendment to exempt hospitals operated by reli- gious groups, arguing that "'national [labor] policy . . . holds relig- iously affiliated institutions . . . to the same standards as their nonsectarian counterparts.' "'30 The Court found that these rejected proposals did not reflect any "affirmative intention" of Congress on this issue because the Board did not assert jurisdiction over church- operated schools until after 1974.131 Hence, there was not a tangible policy tradition to which Congress could respond.

PROBLEMS WITH INFERRING LEGISLATIVE INTENT FROM LEGISLATIVE INACTION Based upon the analysis in Part I, one might conclude that the Supreme Court's legislative inaction decisions are coherent and make a fair amount of sense out of delphic signals from the legislature. These conclusions would be hasty. I have made the best effort I can to present the range of outcomes and the Court's reasoning as coherently as possible. Thus, Part I emphasized, as the Court does, the legal pro- cess context of the legislative inaction in each case: Was Congress aware of the interpretation, and did it deliberate about it?140 If so, its failure to act has interpretive significance, as the Court seems to be saying in cases like Apex Hosiery, Flood, Snyder, and Sinclair. "There could hardly be a clearer indication of congressional agreement" with a particular interpretation, than Congress' focusing on it and failing to change it, the Court said in Runyon141 and might say again in Patterson. Yet the cases are not as coherent as my summary in Part I might suggest. Upon close examination, some of the cases might be consid- ered internally incoherent. For example, Bob Jones' invocation of con- gressional acquiescence in the 1970 IRS interpretation of section 501(c)(3) is inconsistent with Congress' similar acquiescence in exactly the opposite interpretation before 1970.142 Indeed, in the 1960s this issue was certainly a salient one, and at least one bill was introduced to overturn the prior IRS interpretation (it did not pass).143 Why should Congress' silence after 1970 count so much, while its silence before 1970 counts not at all? Bob Jones provides no explanation for this curiosity. A similar point can be made about Runyon. Its holding rested upon Congress' acquiescence in Alfred H. Mayer and lower court decisions extending that precedent to section 1981. Yet the Court ignored Congress' acquiescence in pre-Alfred H. Mayer deci- sions that had required a showing of state action for lawsuits under 140. Cf. 2A N. SINGER, supra note 10, ? 49.09, at 400 (reenactment rule "is of special impor- tance" where administrative or judicial interpretations are known to Congress and "does not apply where nothing indicates that the legislature had its attention directed to the administrative [or judicial] interpretation upon reenactment"); id. ? 49.10, at 408 (acquiescence is "of small consequence where the . . . contemporaneous interpretation was not called to the legislature's attention" but is "presumptive evidence of its correctness" when the legislature was aware of it). 141. 427 U.S. at 174-75. 142.

Like Bob Jones, Runyon seems capricious in its invocation of leg- islative inaction. Other cases are inconsistent with one another. Although Hallock is the leading anti-acquiescence case, the amount of active legislative deliberation over the interpretive question seems just as impressive as that in the leading acquiescence cases, such as Apex Hosiery. Thus, not only had Congress failed to overrule the Supreme Court's authori- tative interpretation of section 302(c) of the Revenue Act of 1926, but Congress had reenacted it without change and had overruled judicial interpretations involving other section 302 issues.145 In short, there seems to be no procedural reason why the acquiescence arguments that prevailed in Apex Hosiery should not have prevailed in Hallock or Girouard. 46 For an even more striking example, Sinclair is one of the most persuasive inaction cases, because the Congress enacting section 301 specifically rejected (at the conference committee) a proposal to allow injunctions to enforce section 301 and, pro tanto, to repeal the Norris-LaGuardia Act. Yet the Court eight years later, in Boys Mar- kets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770,147 overruled Sinclair. The overruling flies in the face not only of the rejected proposal rule but also of the acquiescence rule, since Sinclair was a well-publicized deci- sion and proposals were advanced for Congress to overturn it, which never occurred.148 There is, finally, incoherence at the level of rhetoric. For every case where the Court rhapsodizes about deliberative inaction, there is a counter-case subjecting such inferences to scathing critique. "To ex- plain the cause of non-action by Congress when Congress itself sheds no light is to venture into speculative unrealities," the Court said in Hallock, where Congress not only had focused on the interpretive is- sue, but had changed the statute in other ways.149 "So what," the Court seemed to say.

Congress, but they would only be sufficient to indicate that we walk on quicksand when we try to find in the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal principle."150 Hallock is particularly eloquent, but similar invective can be found in many other opinions rejecting inac- tion arguments.'51 The rhetorical debate has heated up in the last two years, in part because recently appointed Justice Scalia is forcefully critical of legis- lative inaction arguments, the acquiescence rule in particular.152 The debate on the Court is epitomized in Johnson v. Transportation Agency, Santa Clara County. 53 In that case, the Supreme Court reaf- firmed United Steelworkers v. Weber, 154 which had interpreted Title VII to permit voluntary affirmative action in employment. Justice Scalia dissented in Johnson, arguing that the earlier interpretation was wrong and had malign policy consequences.'55 The Court brushed aside this argument in a footnote, observing that "Congress has not amended the statute to reject our construction, nor have any such amendments even been proposed, and we therefore may assume that our interpretation was correct."156 Justice Scalia responded with vari- ous reasons why Congress' failure to amend the statute should have no significance, concluding that "vindication by congressional inaction is 150. 309 U.S. at 121. 151.

"159 And when the legislature declines the invitation, one can infer that, more likely than not, it did mean "X." This reasoning suggests a highly persuasive metaphor for finding meaning in inaction: Wadlington tells Krattenmaker, "Go fetch me some soupmeat." Krattenmaker fetches beef, presents it to Wadlington with the query, "Isn't this the kind of meat you intended?" Wadlington says nothing. Under the acquies- cence rule, we can infer that it is more likely than not that Wadlington did mean beef. Suppose Wadlington issues the same directive every week for a year, Krattenmaker brings beef every time, and Wadlington says nothing. Under the reenactment rule, we can infer that it is more likely than not that Wadlington did mean beef. Finally, suppose Wadlington's spouse suggests, "Dearest, why don't you have Krat- tenmaker fetch us some chicken instead of soupmeat?" And yet Wadlington immediately turns to Krattenmaker and asks only for "soupmeat." Under the rejected proposal rule, we can infer that it is more likely than not that Wadlington did mean beef. If one combines these three scenarios (as in Patterson), the inference is quite powerful. Wadlington meant beef. When Johnson and other Supreme Court opinions make inferences from legislative inaction, they typically assert that these inferences tell us something probable about the actual "intention" of Congress as to the certain issue on which Congress has not responded.'60 Congress is my hypothetical Wadlington.

Yet in Johnson and other cases, Justice Scalia seizes this meta- phor and criticizes it intensely. On the whole, I agree with his cri- tique. While the inferences we draw from the inaction of my hypothetical Wadlington are reasonable, I do not believe that Con- gress is very much like Wadlington. It is different in three material ways: (1) Unlike Wadlington, Congress is a discontinuous deci- sionmaker. Wadlington is the same person, albeit older, year after year. Congress turns over every two years, and the "intent" that is constitutionally most relevant is the intent of the Congress that actu- ally enacted the legislation. (2) Unlike Wadlington, Congress is a col- lective decisionmaker. While Wadlington may sometimes "be of two minds," Congress is always of two minds (the House and the Senate), and each of them contains many different minds. This makes it very difficult to figure out exactly what the intent of Congress is when it fails to do something. (3) Unlike Wadlington, Congress is a public decisionmaker. What Wadlington decides is of little moment, except to Wadlington and her household. What Congress decides has impor- tant consequences for many people and for our own political commu- nity. The public decisionmaking process in fact has several systematic flaws, and we need to be chary of exacerbating those flaws when we develop theories of interpreting Congress' decisions and indecisions. The legislative inaction cases may exacerbate some of those flaws. The remainder of this part explores the implications of these three differences for the legislative inaction cases. To the extent these cases claim to tell us something about legislative expectations, they overstate their claim. To illustrate my criticisms, I shall use Johnson and three cases from Part I - Flood v. Kuhn, Sinclair, and Patterson. These are among the strongest cases for legislative inaction arguments, yet in each case those arguments provide less satisfying proofs of legislative intent than might appear at first glance. I conclude that legislative inaction rarely tells us much about relevant legislative intent. The most persuasive cases under this approach are the rejected proposal cases, such as Sinclair, where the enacting Congress in conference committee rejected a proposal similar to the interpretation rejected by the Court. (Ironically, of course, Sinclair has been overruled.) Not all rejected proposal arguments work, though, and I consider the rejected proposal arguments in Patterson and Flood unpersuasive. Reenact- ment arguments can sometimes be persuasive under an actual intent approach, and the reenactment argument in Patterson is not a bad one. 94 [Vol. 87:67</page><page sequence="29">October 1988] Interpreting Legislative Inaction 95 Acquiescence arguments are almost never persuasive indicia of actual legislative intent, and their invocation in cases like Flood and Johnson only highlights flaws in the legislative process. A. Legislative Structures: Formalist Problems with Inferring Legislative Intent from Legislative Inaction An important formal problem with most of the legislative inaction cases is that they are inconsistent with the traditional proposition that the legislative "intent" relevant to statutory interpretation is the intent of the enacting Congress, not the continuing intent of subsequent Con- gresses.161 Doctrinaily, this proposition underlies the rule that "subse- quent legislative history" is not an authoritative source in statutory interpretation. In a long line of cases, the Supreme Court has held that " 'the views of a subsequent Congress form a hazardous basis for inferring the intent of an earlier one.' "162 Formally, the job of Con- gress ends when it passes the statute, and "it is the function of the courts and not the Legislature, much less a Committee of one House of the Legislature, to say what an enacted statute means."163 Func- tionally, subsequent legislative history is highly unreliable and subject to strategic manipulation.l64 "Thus, even when it would otherwise be useful, subsequent legislative history will rarely override a reasonable interpretation of a statute that can be gleaned from its language and legislative history prior to its enactment."'65 161. Note that a growing body of literature argues that legislative intent is not the only thing courts will or ought to consider when they interpret statutes. R. DWORKIN, LAW'S EMPIRE 313- 54 (1986); Eskridge, Dynamic Statutory Interpretation, 135 U. PA. L. REV. 1479 (1987) [herein- after Dynamic Statutory Interpretation]; see Aleinikoff, Updating Statutory Interpretation, 87 MICH. L. REV. 20, 108 (1988). My view is that historical legislative intent is relevant to statu- tory interpretation, for both formalist and functionalist reasons. Ongoing legislative considera- tion of an interpretive issue is, in my view, relevant information for a court to consider, but not as formally important as is the enacting legislature's intent. 162. Andrus v. Shell Oil Co., 446 U.S. 657, 666 n.8 (1980) (quoting United States v. Price, 361 U.S. 304, 313 (1960)); see also Southeastern Community College v. Davis, 442 U.S. 397, 411 n.ll (1979); W.

Even contemporaneous legislative history may be unreliable and subject to manipula- tion. As legislators and lobbyists have begun to understand how much courts use legislative history, posturing and fabrication have become possible. The fight, if lost on the language of the statute, moves to the language of the committee report or perhaps to getting a scripted colloquy entered into the Congressional Record. The hope is that an unfavorable but likely interpretation will be limited, if not excluded, by the extra-statutory information. 165. Consumer Prod. Safety Commn. v.

Pursuant to articles I and VI, federal statutes are our supreme law (assuming they are constitutional), trumping and dis- placing the common law and state law. The supremacy of statutes, however, is accompanied by elaborate procedural requirements. Before something is an authoritative legislative enactment, entitled to supremacy, it must be passed by both chambers of Congress in the same form, and signed by the President (or passed over a veto).166 Thus, nonbinding resolutions, passed by both Houses of Congress but not presented to the President, are not formally entitled to authorita- tive weight in statutory interpretation.167 The acquiescence and most of the rejected proposal cases directly conflict with these propositions. If subsequent legislative statements directly supporting a statutory interpretation are not valid evidence, how can subsequent legislative silence, usually just indirectly support- ing a statutory interpretation, be considered any more authoritative? As a formal matter, "in view of the specific and constitutional proce- dures required for the enactment of legislation, it would seem hardly justifiable to treat as having legislative effect any action or nonaction not taken in accordance with the prescribed procedures."168 Thus, in Flood v. Kuhn, the "positive inaction" the Court found critically im- portant related to unsuccessful bills introduced between 1957 and 1965.169 The Court's conclusion that "Congress as yet has had no intention to subject baseball's reserve system to the reach of the anti- trust statutes"170 is doctrinally suspect. In none of the more than fifty bills that Congress considered did both Houses agree; hence, there was no article I legislative enactment entitled to authoritative considera- tion by the Court. The only authoritative legislative enactment perti- nent to the case was the original Sherman Act of 1890 that broadly prohibits restraints of trade in "interstate commerce," which baseball Some Observations on the Use of Legislative History in the 1981 Supreme Court Term, 68 IOWA L.

Of course, this formal criticism does not apply to Sinclair, because in that case the rejected proposal was in connection with the original statute (LMRA section 301) being interpreted by the Court. The conference committee's rejection of an exception to the Norris-LaGuardia Act is, therefore, relevant legislative history, and not questionable subsequent history. The irony is that the Court over- ruled Sinclair eight years later in Boys Markets, Inc. v. Retail Clerks Union, Local 770. 172 The latter opinion did not even mention the con- ference committee's rejection of the rule it adopted. Insofar as they are said to be evidence of actual legislative intent, the legislative inaction arguments in Patterson are subject to the for- malist objections discussed above. The argument that Congress has acquiesced in Runyon because it has not overturned it is of question- able formal relevance. The formal question is whether the text and legislative history of section 1981 itself support Runyon, a question that is harder for the Patterson petitioner.173 Similarly, the 1972 rejec- tion of the Hruska amendment by the Senate, and the conference com- mittee rejection of the House provision repealing section 1981 in employment discrimination cases, would not be relevant to the inter- pretation of Congress' intent in 1866. The most persuasive argument would be that based upon section 1988, as amended in 1976 by the Fees Act, because it is based upon a statute actually passed by Congress and formally entitled to supremacy. The reenactment cases are not subject to the formalist objections. The problem is that the Fees Act is not quite a reenact- ment of section 1981. It only builds upon section 1981, as interpreted in Runyon. Is this enough? Perhaps. "Subsequent legislation declar- ing the intent of an earlier statute is entitled to great weight in statu- tory construction."174 While the Fees Act does not state, "Section 171. 407 U.S. at 282 ("Professional baseball is a business and it is engaged in interstate commerce."). 172. 398 U.S. 235 (1970). 173.

Indeterminacy of Collective Intent: Realist Problems with Inferring Legislative Intent from Legislative Inaction Even if subsequent legislative inaction were formally relevant or authoritative evidence of legislative intent, there would be problems of inference. What, in fact, does the inaction mean? It was not difficult for us to infer that the individual Wadlington probably meant for Krattenmaker to fetch beef when she requested "soupmeat," at least after the first fetching. It is more difficult to make such probabilistic inferences for a large collection of people, especially when their deci- sionmaking is as structured as that in Congress. There are two dimen- sions to this problem. First, it is very hard to aggregate preferences in such a large collection of people.'73 Very few of them express their views in legislative debates or committee reports, and when they cast their votes, it is not always easy to figure out what they mean by those votes. Second, the structure of Congress makes it far more likely that something will not happen (inaction) than that it will (action).179 In- 175. See S. REP.

OLESZEK, CONGRES- 98 [Vol. 87:67</page><page sequence="33">Interpreting Legislative Inaction ertia is the main reason for this phenomenon. The legislative agenda is severely limited; to gain a place on that agenda, a measure must not only have substantial support, but be considered urgent by key people (such as the President and/or the party leadership in Congress).180 Even if a proposal finds a place on the legislative agenda, it is usually doomed if there is substantial opposition, whether or not most legisla- tors favor it, because of the variety of procedural roadblocks oppo- nents may erect. A bill can effectively be killed by a hostile committee or subcommittee chair in either chamber, by a hostile House or Senate leadership, by a hostile Rules Committee in the House or by a filibus- ter in the Senate. Consequently, even if a majority of the members of Congress disagree with a judicial or administrative interpretation of a statute, it is very unlikely that they will be able to amend the statute quickly, if at all.181 Given the variety of reasons, unrelated to the merits or legislative support, for the failure of an idea or a measure in Congress, Justice Frankfurter was surely right when he opined in Hallock that such con- siderations "indicate that we walk on quicksand when we try to find in the absence of corrective legislation a controlling legal principle."'82 Consider the evidence in Flood v. Kuhn. On two occasions one cham- ber of Congress passed bills that would have expanded baseball's anti- trust exemption to include other athletic activities, and based upon this evidence the Court reaffirmed its finding in Toolson that "'Con- SIONAL PROCEDURES AND THE POLICY PROCESS (2d ed. 1984); R.

KINGDON, AGENDAS, ALTERNATIVES AND PUBLIC POLICIES (1984). 181. An excellent recent example of this phenomenon is the Civil Rights Restoration Act of 1988, Pub. L. No. 100-259, 102 Stat. 28 (1988). The Act overturned Grove City College v. Bell, 465 U.S. 555 (1984), which interpreted Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 to bar sex discrimination only in programs which received federal aid, not in all programs of institutions receiving federal aid. From the beginning there were very few defenders of the Court's decision, and several bills were introduced to overturn it. 130 CONG. REC. 3661-62 (1984). One bill passed the House but was killed by a Senate filibuster. 130 CONG. REC. S4585 (daily ed. Apr. 12, 1984). (It takes sixty votes in the Senate to cut off a filibuster.) A similar Senate bill in the same Congress was tabled after parliamentary impasse near the end of the session. 130 CONG. REC. S12640-43 (daily ed. Oct. 2, 1984). In the next Congress, the Senate bill was not reported out of committee. S. REP. No. 64, 100th Cong., 1st Sess. 3 (1988). Two committees favorably reported a House bill, H.R. REP.

(Unless a bill is specially expedited by the Rules Committee, it is unlikely to be called up in its turn.) In the next Congress, fifty-one Senators sponsored a bill to overturn the decision, 133 CONG. REC. S2249-56 (daily ed. Feb.19, 1987), yet it took a year before the bill passed the Senate, 134 CONG.

Mar. 22, 1988); 134 CONG. REC. H1071-72 (daily ed. Mar. 22, 1988). It is remarkable that it took four years of procedural maneuvering to overrule a Supreme Court decision that, from all I can tell, never had much support in Congress. 182.

"'83 There are, however, several different inferences that could be drawn from Congress' reaction to the Court's decisions:184 (1) Legislators approved of the Court's decisions and were only divided on the question of whether and how far to expand them to other athletic activities. (2) Legislators in one chamber approved of the Court's decisions only if they were applicable to all professional athletics (which the Court held was not the case), on grounds of fairness. Legislators in the other chamber either (a) approved of the Court's decisions for baseball only and did not want them expanded to other sports, or (b) disapproved of the Court's decisions entirely and did not want them expanded at all. (3) Legislators in one chamber approved of the Court's decisions, while legislators in the other chamber did not care enough about the issue to consider it. (4) Legislators in neither chamber approved of the Court's deci- sions, but on two occasions one chamber voted for an expansion of the decisions in order to placate the special interests of team own- ers in baseball and other sports. On each occasion, the chamber understood that the other chamber would not go along. Of these possible inferences, only the first one supports Flood's conclu- sion that Congress "has no intention to subject baseball's reserve sys- tem to the reach of the antitrust statutes." Inferences two and four strongly cut against the Court's decision, because they suggest legisla- tive unhappiness with the unequal treatment of baseball and other sports. The Court suggests no reason to prefer the first inference to the fourth, and there is every reason to believe that the first is less likely than the second and fourth together. The problems with the acquiescence and rejected proposal argu- ments in Flood are generalizable, because Flood is a relatively strong case for their invocation. A similar analysis can be used in other cases.185 For example, the acquiescence and rejected proposal argu- 183. Flood, 407 U.S. at 285 (quoting Toolson v. New York Yankees, Inc., 346 U.S. 356, 357 (1953) (per curiam)). The Court also used this evidence to conclude that Congress has had no desire to disapprove of Federal Baseball legislatively. That is obvious but cuts against the Court's position unless it also concludes that Congress approved of the decision. 184. See H. HART &amp; A. SACKS, supra note 9, at 1395-96. 185.

He supports his assertion with an example using two urns, one with only white mar- 100 [Vol. 87:67</page><page sequence="35">October 1988] Interpreting Legislative Inaction 101 ments in Patterson are even more vulnerable, as suggested by an analy- sis of Congress' refusal to cut back on the ambit of section 1981 in connection with its 1972 amendment to the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Start with Senator Hruska's proposed amendment in the Senate. The amendment did not single out section 1981, nor did it posit that sec- tion 1981 should be reinterpreted to apply only to public discrimina- tion.186 Senator Hruska offered the amendment because then-current law permitted a "multiplicity of actions to be instituted against a re- spondent before a number of separate and distinct forums for the same alleged offense.'"187 While section 1981 was apparently one of the "multiplicity of actions" concerning Senator Hruska, neither he nor his amendment expressed an opinion on the ambit of section 1981. The Senate bill expanded Title VII to cover discrimination by state and local governments against their employees, and so section 1981 was a relevant statute however it was interpreted. Those voting against the Hruska amendment were, at most, following the dictates of the bill's sponsors not to remove section 1981 from the employment arena.188 In short, rejection of the Hruska amendment tells us little about what anyone thought about section 1981's application to private discrimination. Assume, as the Court did in Runyon,189 that the vote on the bles and another with half white, half black marbles. Id. at 10, n.38. We are presented with a white marble. Though we don't know which ur produced the marble, it is probably the first urn. "Similarly," Farber concludes, "although congressional silence could result from either congressional approval or other factors, it still increases the likelihood of congressional ap- proval." Id. The flaw in this analysis is that Farber has stacked the urns, by giving us only two (Congress either approves or disapproves) and assuming there is an equal number of marbles in each (his inference doesn't work if the second urn has twice as many marbles as the first). Consider a more realistic variation on Farber's example. White marbles indicate that Con- gress will not overturn (black marbles indicate that it will). Three urns represent Congress' possible attitudes toward an interpretation. Urn 1 stands for Congress' positive approval of the interpretation and has four white marbles (there is no way Congress will overturn the interpreta- tion). Urn 2 stands for Congress' disapproval of the interpretation; it has two white and two black marbles (50-50 chance of overturning, depending on procedural obstacles). Urn 3 stands for Congress' apathy or ignorance of the interpretation; it has 44 white marbles and six black marbles (Congress may do something but very probably won't). We are presented with a white marble. Can we infer that it came from Urn 1 (Congress approves of the interpretation)? No. There is a 92% probability that it came from Urn 2 or 3 (Congress disapproved or was unaware). While Farber's argument is "brilliant," see Farber, The Case Against Brilliance, 70 MINN. L. REV. 917 (1986), it is not persuasive. 186. See 118 CONG. REC. 3173 (1972) (text of Hruska amendment). 187. Id. at 3172. One example of this "multiplicity" was that of a lawsuit by a black em- ployee against an employer, pursuant to the Civil Rights Act of 1866, id. at 3173, but Senator Hruska did not explain whether the employer was private or public. 188. Additionally, those voting against the amendment may have thought it unnecessary, since modern principles of res judicata would protect companies against seriation employment discrimination lawsuits. See id. at 3370 (Sen. Javits). 189. 427 U.S. at 174 n. 11. Runyon characterized the defeat of the Hruska amendment as a referendum on the Alfred H.

The argument is still problem- atic. While Runyon correctly says that "Senator Hruska's proposed amendment was rejected,"190 it does not mention that the amendment failed on a tie vote - thirty-three Senators voting for it, and thirty- three Senators voting against it.191 Indeed, there were actually thirty- four Senators on the floor voting in favor of the amendment, which means that a majority of those Senators present supported the amend- ment. But the thirty-fourth Senator announced that he was a live pair for an absent Senator.192 It is highly unusual for a Senator to agree to be a live pair when it affects the outcome,193 and I suspect that some deal had been worked out by the Senate Democratic leadership to save the bill from the Hruska amendment.194 In any event, with at least half the voting Senators agreeing with the Hruska amendment, Run- yon's attempt to use it to prove legislative intent is questionable. Although Runyon did not mention it, a better argument for its po- sition would have been the rejection of a similar proposal by the con- ference committee that assembled the Equal Employment Opportunity Act in 1972. Like the Senate Labor &amp; Public Welfare Committee, the House Education &amp; Labor Committee had reported a bill which preserved existing remedies and refused to make Title VII the exclusive remedy for employment discrimination.'95 Unlike its Senate counterpart, though, the House committee was unable to pre- vent its version from being amended. Indeed, the committee bill was replaced on the floor of the House with a substitute that contained the case, for the reasons suggested in the text. For support, the Court quoted Senator Williams: "'It was recently stated by the Supreme Court in the case of Jones v. Mayer, that these acts [sections 1981 and 1983] provide fundamental constitutional guarantees.' ' 427 U.S. at 174 n. 11 (quoting 118 CONG. REC. 3371 (1972)). Apart from Senator Williams' confusion about the hold- ing in Alfred H. Mayer (which interpreted ? 1982, not ? 1981), that quotation is odd support for the Court, since Senator Williams lumps together ?? 1981 and 1983 and characterizes them as protecting "constitutional" rights - which are normally only applicable to public and not pri- vate discrimination. The one or two Senators who were really listening to Senator Williams might have assumed the opposite of the Court's point - that ? 1981, like ? 1983, applies only to public discrimination! 190. 427 U.S. at 174 n. l. 191. 118 CONG.

While Sinclair and Albemarle Paper suggest that this ought to be a decisive argument for the Runyon result, it is subject to some doubt, based upon a realistic appraisal of the legislative process. As was the case with the failure of the Hruska amendment, we have no clear explanation from the official records for why the Senate position prevailed over the House position. The explanation probably was the conference committee's desire to have a broad range of federal and state remedies for employment discrimination. Such an explana- tion and the conference committee's choice of nonexclusivity are, of course, perfectly consistent with the view that section 1981 only covers public discrimination, because the final bill extended Title VII cover- age to state and local employees.197 More importantly, there is a likely procedural explanation for why the Senate position prevailed. The custom, followed in 1972, is to appoint as conferees on important leg- islation members of the relevant committee in each chamber.198 The conference committee for the 1972 Act consisted of members of the House Education &amp; Labor Committee, a majority of whom had op- posed the exclusivity provision in committee and on the House floor,199 plus members of the Senate Labor &amp; Public Welfare Commit- tee, an overwhelming majority of whom had voted against the Hruska amendment.200 Given this composition, of course the conference com- mittee was going to preserve all existing remedies.

Dysfunctions in the Legislative Process: Systemic Problems with Inferring Legislative Intent from Legislative Inaction The analysis in this part has suggested that, on closer examination, the legislative inaction arguments in most of the leading cases do not often tell us much about relevant legislative intent. I want to conclude the analysis by raising a larger policy issue: If the Supreme Court seriously applies the various legislative inaction doctrines, it may be exacerbating dysfunctions that exist in the legislative process. In the previous section, I dealt with one dysfunction, inertia. Congress' fail- ure to be more active in dealing with public problems is perceived by many to be a substantial institutional failing, and the Court's willing- ness to draw overbroad conclusions from Congress' lapses expands upon the already malign consequences of this dysfunction. Another institutional dysfunction of Congress is suggested by anal- ysis of the legislative inaction arguments in Flood and Johnson. In Flood, the baseball owners argued that since virtually all of the legisla- tive activity after Toolson had sought to expand baseball's antitrust immunity to other sports, it would be anomalous for the Court to eliminate that immunity,201 and it is likely that this argument was a persuasive one to the Court. The Court itself in Johnson advanced a similar argument to defend its position that Congress' failure to over- rule Weber represented acquiescence in the decision.202 Just before Weber, Congress had responded to an equally controversial Supreme Court interpretation of Title VII, General Electric Co. v. Gilbert.203 That case held that Title VII's sex discrimination prohibition did not apply to an employer's failure to provide pregnancy benefits as part of an otherwise comprehensive health care package; within two years, Congress overruled Gilbert through the Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978.204 One of the amici in Patterson argues that Congress' failure to overrule Runyon is particularly significant, given its willing- ness to overrule other judicial interpretations of civil rights statutes, such as Gilbert.205 These arguments have a strong appeal. If one can show substantial congressional activity in a given subject area - civil rights or applica- tion of antitrust principles to professional sports - then concerns about legislative inertia and inactivity seem less persuasive.

Consider two influential lines of political theory, and then reconsider the arguments made in Flood, Johnson, and Patterson. Public choice theory, the application of economic insights to polit- ical behavior,206 suggests several intriguing principles. Public choice theory assumes that legislators are primarily motivated by a desire to be reelected. Such legislators are confronted with the "dilemma of the ungrateful electorate" - that is, an axiom of human nature under which voters and interest groups will remember the things the legisla- tor did to hurt them more strongly than they will remember the things done for their benefit. Given this calculus of human nature, legislators will try to avoid conflictual issues; hence, their activity will focus on passing laws that help as many organized groups as possible, without hurting other organized groups. This would not be so bad if organized groups represented a broad range of interests, but public choice theory also predicts that groups tend to organize in a selective and often arbi- trary way. Groups are more likely to organize when they are small, wealthy, and well-defined; once they are formed, such groups will work intensely to seek concentrated benefits (such as subsidies) for themselves and to avoid concentrated costs (such as user fees). Con- versely, groups will not so often organize to seek legislation that dis- tributes benefits to the general population, or to avoid generally shared costs. Typically, the disorganized general public is not even aware of when its interests are being compromised. The gloomy conclusion of public choice theory - prevalence of special interest groups and legislator reluctance to offend them - is made gloomier by the insights of institutional process theorists about "subgovernments."207 According to these theorists, decisions distrib- uting benefits to private groups are generally made by subgovern- ments, that is, House and Senate committees and subcommittees, relevant bureaucrats and executive officers, and private lobbyists for the benefited groups. Because of their low visibility and ties to organ- ized interests (which, public choice theory teaches, are formed selec- tively), subgovernments tend to pander to special viewpoints and are not necessarily broadly representative. 206.

The obvious reason why the activity focused on expanding the antitrust exemption to other sports is that no one was pressuring Congress to eliminate baseball's exemption, while strong organized pressure was applied to expand it. Baseball owners were well-organized and would have lobbied hard against any effort to take away their exemption, and owners in other professional sports were just as well-organized to ob- tain similar treatment for their sports. These groups fit the classic public choice pattern - small, homogenous, and wealthy - as the groups most likely to organize. Those hurt by baseball's exemption the millions who bought overpriced tickets each year and watched the sport on television - were unlikely to organize because they were gen- erally ignorant of their injury and because individual stakes were very small. Even baseball players, a smaller and discrete group harmed by the antitrust exemption (the reserve clause), were not politically or- ganized until after 1966.208 Consequently, the relevant subgovern- inent between 1957 and 1965, when the legislative activity occurred, wanted only to help the owners, because they were virtually the only organized "players" in the legislative ballgame. There was no pressure on legislators to help consumers and ballplayers; because they were not well-organized, they were effectively marginalized in the political process. Under these circumstances, Congress was not going to over- turn Toolson. Its failure to do anything says nothing about its ap- proval of the gap in antitrust enforcement created in such a blundering fashion by the Court and, instead, represents a prudent reluctance to cave in to special interest demands to expand the exemption. For similar reasons, Congress is highly unlikely to overturn Weber. The relevant subgovernment consists of well-organized minority and civil rights groups209 and sympathetic members of the Judiciary Com- mittees in both Houses of Congress.210 So long as the civil rights 208. The Major League Players Association was formed in 1954, but it did not become a major force until after 1966. Players were not better organized, in part because they were just not politically alert and had substantially more allegiance to their teams (and hence to the owners of their teams) than to their group, before the 1960s. In the 1970s the players were much better organized and were able to eliminate the reserve clause through arbitration. 209. Note that blacks, the primary beneficiary group of Weber, are a classic group for polit- ical organization (now that barriers to political participation have been removed). While they are numerous, they are "discrete and insular," which facilitates their organization. See Ackerman, Beyond Carolene Products, 98 HARV. L. REV. 713 (1985). 210. Tale House Judiciary Committee has been chaired by liberal Representative Rodino in this time frame and has been controlled by liberal Democrats with close ties to the civil rights lobby. The Senate Judiciary Committee for six years was chaired by Senator Thurmond, once a bitter foe of civil rights and now at best acquiescent. Even in this period, the civil rights lobby could count on a committee majority (the Democrats, plus liberal Republican Senators Specter and Mathias) in key situations. 106 [Vol. 87:67</page><page sequence="41">Interpreting Legislative Inaction lobby intensely favors Weber, very few members of Congress are going to tamper with it, and the legislative committees will fight them if they try. Conversely, there is no organized political demand to overturn Weber. Unions and employers (highly organized groups) benefit from Weber, because it allows them to escape potentially costly Title VII lawsuits. Those hurt by Weber - blue collar white males - are dif- fuse and ill-organized politically. In short, contrary to the Court's opinion in Johnson, the legislative response to Gilbert is not surprising, nor is the nonresponse to Weber. 211 While both decisions were contro- versial, only Gilbert hurt a group active in the political process, and so it is not surprising that only it was overturned.212 Under this framework, Patterson is an intermediate case. Run- yon's vulnerability falls between that of Gilbert and that of Weber. Like Weber, Runyon benefitted well-organized minority groups who have powerful allies in the relevant subgovernment. Like Gilbert, and unlike Weber, Runyon hurt well-organized employer groups, which disliked the broader employment discrimination relief afforded by sec- tion 1981. They were able to present their position to Congress in 1972 (when lower court decisions clearly signaled the coming of Run- yon), and they lost. This analysis suggests that in cases like Johnson and Flood the ac- quiescence argument is particularly questionable as a basis for infer- ring legislative intent. Acquiescence is the rule and not the exception, whatever Congress' feelings about a Supreme Court decision; and leg- islative overruling is as much controlled by political calculations as by any judgment on the merits. If the Court is going to make inferences about legislative intent based upon acquiescence,213 I urge that the 211. I disagree with the characterization of my position by Farber, supra note 68, at 11 n.39. I posit two reasons why no bills were even introduced to overturn Weber: (1) groups benefitting from the decision were better organized than victims (the explanation Farber attributes to me), coupled with (2) the dilemma of the ungrateful electorate and the strong aversion most legislators have to antagonizing important interest groups (an explanation Farber does not attribute to me). 212. I speak only in terms of probability. I am undertaking an empirical study of congres- sional responses to judicial statutory interpretations and have discovered that Congress does often respond to judicial decisions; though the legislative response is biased, it is not perfectly predictable. Recall the long fight to overturn Grove City, recounted in note 181 supra. The opposition of the President and other important public figures, based in part on ideological grounds, is one of the political imponderables that the public choice calculations do not precisely anticipate. See Eskridge, Politics Without Romance, supra note 206, at 319-22. 213. The analysis also raises some questions (albeit less serious ones) about the reenactment cases. When Congress reenacts a statute, or enacts related legislation (such as the Fees Act), it has few incentives to reexamine issues "settled" by Supreme Court decisions. Unless virtually all of the relevant organized groups agree that the Court's decision is wrong or unless the groups favoring the Court's decision can be placated in the logrolling process, tampering with the Court's decision will add unnecessary complications to the process of enactment, which is hard enough as it is. 107 October 1988]</page><page sequence="42">Michigan Law Review Court consider whether the "losers" in the initial interpretation had effective access to the political process to urge reconsideration. If they did not - as in Flood and Johnson - then the Court should be more reluctant to find any kind of legislative approval of the decision. In my view, this reluctance does not extend to the issue in Patterson, be- cause the losers in Runyon were well organized and had their opportu- nity to make their case before Congress. III. THE RELEVANCE OF LEGISLATIVE INACTION: THE PRESUMED CORRECTNESS OF BUILDING BLOCK INTERPRETATIONS Based upon the arguments in Part II, I believe that legislative inac- tion usually tells us very little about actual legislative intent. If my skepticism about the usefulness of legislative inaction as evidence of legislative intent is correct, then what can be made of the dozens of Supreme Court cases that rely on legislative inaction as positive evi- dence in statutory interpretation? Are they all wrong? Their rhetoric about legislative intention is subject to question if they are referring to "actual intent," but the cases can be explained by reference to a better idea, "presumed intent." My thesis is that what the Court is doing in these cases is to place upon Congress the institutional burden of re- sponding to "building block" agency and judicial interpretations of statutes when Congress disagrees with them. Building block interpre- tations, as I am using the term, are authoritative, well-settled interpre- tations upon which public and/or private parties reasonably rely to carry out their roles under the statute. If Congress does nothing, the Court feels free to presume (rebuttably of course) that an agency and/ or judicial building block interpretation is the correct one. This pre- sumed intent approach explains the cases pretty well and is consistent with our constitutional traditions. I believe there are normative problems with this descriptive model and argue, further, that the legis- lative inaction doctrines ought to be applied somewhat more cau- tiously than they have been in the past. These normative problems do not apply to Patterson, however, and I fully endorse their application to reaffirm Runyon. A. Rethinking the Legislative Inaction Cases: Presumed Intent and the Legislative Burden of Response Although the rhetoric of the legislative inaction cases usually em- phasizes legislative intent, as an actual collective intent like that of my hypothetical Wadlington, there is no inherent reason why the legal significance of legislative inaction must be tied to actual intent. To the 108 [Vol. 87:67</page><page sequence="43">Interpreting Legislative Inaction contrary, the significance of inaction in legal doctrine is not necessarily based upon an actor's actual intent anyway, but typically is based upon the actor's failure to fulfill a legally defined duty. For example, criminal liability in Anglo-American law does not attach simply be- cause an actor fails to save a dying person, even if the actor's intention is malicious - unless there is a statutory or common law duty for the actor to do something.214 In Anglo-American contract law, silence is usually not acceptance of an offer even if intended to be - unless the parties' relationship or a statute has created a duty to respond nega- tively if the offeree wants to decline.215 Perhaps the best public law example is the President's use of the veto power. If the President does not veto a bill passed by Congress within ten days, the inaction is deemed an approval of the bill, which becomes law whatever the Presi- dent's actual intent or the reason for the President's failure to act.216 One reading of the legislative inaction cases is that once courts, the executive, or an agency has interpreted a statute, the burden is upon Congress to respond to the interpretation if it disagrees with it. If Congress does nothing to disturb the interpretation, the Court is free to presume that the interpretation was correct. This reading of the legislative inaction cases often appears in their rhetoric. Thus, the Court sometimes states the reenactment doctrine: "Congress is pre- sumed to be aware of an administrative or judicial interpretation of a statute and to adopt that interpretation when it re-enacts a statute without change."217 And the acquiescence doctrine: "But once an agency's [or the Court's] statutory construction has been 'fully brought to the attention of the public and the Congress,' and the latter has not sought to alter that interpretation although it has amended the statute in other respects, then presumably the legislative intent has 214.

The presumption becomes conclusive by showing that Congress did in fact approve of the interpretation. If the relevant intent is a presumed intent arising out of an institu- tional responsibility, what is the source of the responsibility? The ap- parent policy basis for this responsibility is our legal system's desire for continuity in the law, a concern that also animates stare decisis.220 Continuity is desirable for at least three reasons.221 First, it contrib- utes to our overall sense of security and to the legitimacy of law as something that does not unduly vacillate. Second, persons subject to legal rules often rely on those rules when structuring their activities. If the rules changed abruptly and constantly, their reliance interests would be destroyed. Third, public decisionmakers often rely on those rules when establishing or changing other rules. Changing one rule might then unhinge other rules built upon it. Given these policies, the presumption of correctness should apply to interpretations that subserve the policies of continuity. Hence, the strongest case for application of the presumption is for a "building 218. United States v.

The legislative inaction cases are very much connected with stare decisis, because many of them deal with the Supreme Court's statutory interpretations. But the cases also deal with Congress' response to settled statutory interpretations by the executive, agencies, and lower courts. 221. See generally Moragne v. States Marine Lines, Inc., 398 U.S. 375 (1970). 110 [Vol. 87:67</page><page sequence="45">Interpreting Legislative Inaction block interpretation." Following the policy reasons for continuity in law, a building block interpretation has the following characteristics. First, it must be an authoritative or settled interpretation, setting a firm direction for the statute's development. Hence, a lower court in- terpretation not followed by other courts, or an informal agency prac- tice would not be a building block interpretation. Second, it must be one on which parties subject to the statute have (probably) relied in structuring their conduct. A widely ignored interpretation is not a building block one. Third, it must be one upon which public deci- sionmakers have (apparently) relied in developing further legal rules. Conversely, the presumption of correctness does not inhere in a judicial, executive, or agency interpretation which is "unsettled," namely, one that is not authoritative and has not been the basis of private or public reliance. (Now, such an interpretation may in fact be correct, but it is entitled to no presumption.) Obviously, most inter- pretations are intermediate cases, neither building blocks nor unset- tled. For example, a lower court interpretation upon which private parties but not public decisionmakers have relied is not quite a build- ing block interpretation, but it is entitled to some presumption of correctness. My reading of the cases is largely descriptive. I think it adequately accounts for the Court's concerns in the legislative inaction cases and for most of the apparently anomalous results reached by the Court. For example, contrast the Court's application of the acquiescence rule in Monell with that in Johnson.222 In Monell, the Court overruled a seventeen-year-old precedent (Monroe), notwithstanding congressional inaction, while in Johnson the Court reaffirmed an eight-year-old pre- cedent (Weber), based upon congressional acquiescence. My explana- tion for the different results is that the Court considered Monroe an unsettled precedent, and Weber a building block one. Monell gave four reasons why it would be unjustified to " 'place on the shoulders of Congress the burden of [correcting] the Court's own error.' "223 The first three reasons parallel the three continuity values underlying the presumption of correctness: Monroe was inconsistent with the Court's practice both before and after 1961, Congress had not relied on Monroe and in fact had assumed in the 1976 Fees Act that Monroe did not really protect local governments from suit, and there was no justi- 222. Dissenting in Johnson, 107 S. Ct. at 1473, Justice Scalia argued that if Congress' failure to overturn Weber could be taken by the Court as evidence that the decision is correct, the same argument ought to have persuaded the Court that Monroe is correct. 223. 436 U.S. at 695-701 (quoting Girouard, 328 U.S. at 70); see 436 U.S. at 708-13 (Powell, J., concurring). 111 October 1988]</page><page sequence="46">Michigan Law Review fiable private reliance.224 I read these to say that there were no con- tinuity-of-law justifications for affording Monroe a presumption of correctness. The fourth reason given in Monell was "'that it ap- pear[ed] beyond doubt from the legislative history of the 1871 statute that [Monroe] misapprehended the meaning'" of the statute.225 That is, even if the presumption of correctness had applied, the Court might still have overruled Monroe because its error was so clear. Justice Scalia's dissenting opinion in Johnson sought to characterize Weber as similarly aberrational,226 but his arguments were forcefully rebutted by Justice Stevens' concurring opinion.227 Justice Stevens argued that Weber is now an important part of the fabric of the law, relied upon by unions and employers seeking to bring their workforces into compli- ance with Title VII; the Court has been building upon Weber in a series of cases that have spelled out in more detail the contours of that decision. Though Weber is a recent decision and is not without analyt- ical problems, those problems come nowhere near to challenging the presumed correctness of such a building block case.228 For a more difficult pair of cases, consider Sinclair and Boys Mar- kets. Sinclair's reliance on the Taft-Hartley conference committee's rejection of the House proposal to curtail the Norris-LaGuardia Act seems like a decisive argument, because the Congress enacting the stat- ute being interpreted squarely considered the issue and reached formal agreement. Nonetheless, Boys Markets not only denied that argu- ment, but also rejected an argument based upon post-1962 legislative acquiescence in Sinclair. 229 Under the Court's actual intent approach, these cases seem entirely anomalous: Surely Sinclair, and not Boys Markets, accurately discerned the actual legislative intent. But my presumed intent approach suggests a plausible way to reconcile the two cases, as the Court itself recognized.

The committee's action created a presumption of legislative intent because it sustained the longstanding anti-injunction policy of the Norris-LaGuardia Act against incursion by the newer policy of encouraging labor arbitration. That latter pol- icy was in large part judicially created in a series of decisions handed down only a few years before Sinclair.231 But by 1970, when Boys Markets was decided, the policy subordinated in Sinclair had become fundamental (enforceable labor arbitration became the linchpin of na- tional labor policy), and Sinclair's preferred policy had become less urgent. Additionally, it had become clear by 1970 that Sinclair was interfering with state court injunctions compelling arbitration, which went beyond the concerns of the Norris-LaGuardia Act.232 Finally, return to Flood, which is very hard to defend under an actual intent approach. Under the presumed intent approach, it re- mains marginal but is at least defensible. Was Federal Baseball/Tool- son a building block interpretation triggering a congressional burden of response if it disagreed? Yes and no. Yes, in the sense that the interpretation had been in place for half a century and had created substantial private reliance interests. No, in the sense that the inter- pretation was increasingly inconsistent with the Supreme Court's over- all antitrust jurisprudence, and even inconsistent with the Court's application of antitrust law to professional athletics. The dissenting Justices stressed the inconsistency with general antitrust law, while the majority stressed the longstanding interpretation and current reliance. Under the descriptive approach outlined here, Federal Baseball/Tool- son was entitled to a weak presumption of correctness, which was ap- parently enough to save these decisions given the close case on the merits.233 230. 398 U.S. at 241. 231.

Professor Stephen Ross has suggested to me that there were in 1972 several very good current-policy arguments in favor of preserving baseball's antitrust exemption.

Problems with the Legislative Inaction Cases, Even Under the Presumed Intent Theory My explanation of the Court's legislative inaction cases, focusing on the presumption of correctness for building block interpretations that Congress does not overrule, is only descriptive. The question re- mains: If this really does capture what the Court is doing, is it norma- tively defensible? The main problem I have with the presumed intent approach is that it, like the actual intent approach, exacerbates dys- functions in the legislative process. As I argued in Part II,234 the legis- lative process is heavily inertial, and many interests are not effectively heard. I am concerned that the presumption of correctness might overprotect interpretations benefitting well-organized interests, too often at the expense of the general welfare. That is, once an organized interest wrests a favorable interpretation from the courts or a captured agency and of course relies on it, it will very probably be able to rely on the presumption of correctness, because its interpretation is a build- ing block one and Congress is unlikely to express disapproval, given the interest group's ability to mobilize opposition to any effort to change the interpretation legislatively. Conversely, if a judicial or ad- ministrative interpretation hurts the interests of the same well-organ- ized group, the group will often have a fighting chance to obtain a legislative overruling. In short, the legislative inaction cases - however they are ex- plained - have an asymmetrical, and unfair, impact on the develop- ment of legal rules. For this reason, I should urge that the presumption of correctness should be a weak one if the Court per- ceives that interests hurt by the building block interpretation do not have effective access to the political process. For me, this concern viti- ates the use of legislative inaction in Flood, and I disagree with its result. A second, and related, problem I have with the Court's practice in the legislative inaction cases is that it may foster or preserve obsoles- cent statutory interpretations, because the practice on the whole overvalues reliance interests and the historical continuity of one line of interpretation, to the detriment of the present coherence and fairness of our law. Again, Flood is an example of this phenomenon. Another is Monessen Southwestern Railway v. Morgan,235 decided at the close of the 1987 Term. Monessen interpreted the Federal Employers' Lia- 234.

The Court argued that when FELA was enacted in 1908 the common law did not permit prejudgment in- terest in suits for personal injury or wrongful death and that the stat- ute's failure to provide for such interest suggested an original intent not to include it.237 Additionally, the Court relied on Congress' fail- ure to overturn the virtually uniform line of federal and state decisions holding that FELA does not permit prejudgment interest and on Con- gress' rejection of a proposal to amend the general federal interest stat- ute to include prejudgment interest across the board. The Court suggested that this somehow tells us something about legislative in- tent,238 but the basic message of the opinion was that the Court was "unwilling in the face of such congressional inaction to alter the long- standing apportionment between carrier and worker of the costs of... injuries. If prejudgment interest is to be available under the FELA, then Congress must expressly so provide."239 A dissenting opinion in Monessen argued that FELA's compensa- tory purposes are ill-served by denying claimants prejudgment interest on out-of-pocket losses, for that denies the claimant the make-whole remedy intended by Congress.240 As to the Court's legislative silence arguments, the dissenting Justices argued that even in 1908 the com- mon law rule was being criticized as inconsistent with the compensa- tory purposes of tort law, and today's common law endorses prejudgment interest on out-of-pocket losses.24' Also, they argued that the "consistent judicial interpretation" of FELA was unpersua- sive, because most of the decisions engaged in no meaningful analysis of the subject, and several recent ones that did analyze it recognized the "excellent case" to be made for prejudgment interest.242 "'We do not expect Congress to make an affirmative move every time a lower court indulges in an erroneous interpretation,'" sniffed the dissenters.243 Monessen is arguably consistent with the Court's legislative inac- 236. 35 Stat. 65 (codified as amended at 45 U.S.C. ?? 51-60 (1982)). 237. 108 S.

That, in turn, owes much to the ambiguity of the underlying policy - continuity in law. There are two kinds of continuity in law, vertical and horizontal. The Monessen majority em- phasized "vertical continuity," that is, the consistency of interpreta- tion over time, for just the one issue. The dissent emphasized "horizontal discontinuity," that is, the inconsistency of denying FELA claimants prejudgment interest with the evolving purposes of FELA, the moder consensus that prejudgment interest is often necessary to assure compensatory relief, and the Court's willingness in other stat- utes to infer prejudgment interest. I believe that both types of con- tinuity are important. Vertical continuity is often necessary to protect reliance interests and predictability of legal rules, but horizontal con- tinuity is often necessary to effectuate dynamic statutory goals and as- sure overall fairness. When there is a clash between the values of vertical and horizontal continuity, I should often favor horizontal con- tinuity. Hence, I believe the Monessen dissent had the better arguments. My third concern with the presumptive intent approach to the leg- islative inaction cases is that it may sometimes slight actual legislative intent. In Pierce v. Underwood,245 also decided at the end of the 1987 Term, the Court interpreted the Equal Access to Justice Act of 1980 (EAJA),246 which provides that in civil litigation brought by or against the United States, federal courts shall award the prevailing party (but not the United States) its attorney's fees and other expenses, "unless the court finds that the position of the United States was substantially justified or that special circumstances make an award unjust."247 Based upon language in the House and Senate committee reports, and 244. The lower court interpretation in which Congress "acquiesced" was not a classic build- ing block interpretation, because it was not entirely authoritative (i.e., there was no Supreme Court holding) and did not clearly create private reliance interests (though there may have been insurance assumptions). Cf. Norfolk &amp; Western Ry. v. Liepelt, 444 U.S. 490 (1980) (no acquies- cence in longstanding lower court practice in FELA cases). On the other hand, the interpreta- tion was not unsettled, either. The lower court cases were all but unanimous, and there may have been congressional reliance on them when the general prejudgment interest proposal was rejected. At most, the lower court interpretation was entitled to a weak presumption of correct- ness - a presumption that, I should have thought, is rebutted by its inconsistency with the statutory policy of make-whole relief. 245. 108 S.

The House report for the 1985 re- enactment, however, opined that "'substantial justification' means more than merely reasonable" and that the lower court decisions ac- cepting a reasonableness standard were wrong.250 Although Under- wood cited no other evidence of legislative intent in the 1985 reenactment of the statute, it found this relatively clear committee lan- guage insufficient to rebut the presumption that the general trend in lower court interpretations was the one intended by Congress.251 An initial problem with decisions like the one in Underwood relates to overall interpretive methodology. Traditionally, actual legislative intent has been considered the lodestar of statutory interpretation,252 and a number of recent scholars have argued that original legislative intent is usually the only relevant criterion for interpreting a statute.253 The concept of presumed intent, based upon the policy concerns un- derlying the legislative duty to respond, might be inconsistent with this traditional understanding. I do not find this very problematic, though, because the traditional focus is an oversimplification of what statutory interpretation involves.254 For example, judicially created policy presumptions, often called clear statement rules, are not new to statutory interpretation.255 There are literally dozens of them, includ- ing the rule of lenity, that penal statutes should be interpreted nar- 248.

Like the presumption of correct- ness when Congress fails to disapprove of a building block interpretation, these well-established rules presume a congressional in- tent, based upon important national policies (fair notice to criminal defendants, federalism, sovereign immunity). "'The normal rule of statutory construction,'" the Court emphasized just last Term, "'is that if Congress intends for legislation to change the interpretation of a judicially created concept, it makes that intent specific.' "259 An even closer doctrinal relative to the presumption analyzed here is the special stare decisis rule for statutory precedents. The Court is often more reluctant to overrule a statutory precedent than a constitu- tional or common law precedent.260 The Court gives various reasons for what I call the "super-strong presumption against overruling statu- tory precedents." The most popular one is that when the Court misin- terprets a statute, Congress is the better forum for correcting the error. This is simply another way of saying: Once the Court interprets a statute, Congress has the burden of response if it disagrees; if it does not respond, the Court can presume (as it did in Flood, Runyon, and Johnson) that its interpretation was correct.261 While I think that the 256.

Thus, I am not much troubled by the Court's willingness to pre- sume legislative intent. What does trouble me is the cavalier way the Court treated the evidence of actual intent in Underwood and its reluc- tance to consider evidence rebutting the reenactment presumption. The Court belittled rather than analyzed the position taken by the 1985 House committee report that the statute had been misinterpreted by the lower court opinions. Committee reports are generally consid- ered authoritative,262 and I do not see why the House report should not have been entitled to at least some consideration by the Court.263 Indeed, there is evidence that some members of the 1980 Congress intended that the standard fall somewhere between reasonableness and automatic fee awards. The original Senate bill in 1979 would have awarded fees automatically; the Department of Justice sought an amendment to impose fees only when the Goveri;ment action was "ar- bitrary, frivolous, unreasonable, or groundless"; the Senate Judiciary Committee adopted a compromise position in the "substantially justi- fied" test, rejecting both the Government's test and a test of "reason- able justification."264 To be sure, the committee reports for the 1980 statute support Underwood's interpretation, but my point is that the Court blatantly ignored actual legislative expectations. There are ar- guments to be made on both sides about the intent of Congress in 262. Note that Justice Scalia authored the Underwood decision. Justice Scalia has openly expressed his disdain for reliance on committee reports to interpret statutes. See Hirschey v. FERC, 777 F.2d 1, 7-8 (D.C. Cir. 1985) (Scalia, T. concurring) (same EAJA issue as in Under- wood). Though some lower court judges find his position tenable, there is no indication that his view is widely shared on the Supreme Court. Cf Farber &amp; Frickey, Legislative Intent and Public Choice, 74 VA. L. REV. 423 (1988) (criticizing Justice Scalia's position). 263. See Underwood, 108 S. Ct. at 2556-57 (Brennan, J., concurring in the judgment). The Government argued that sponsors of the EAJA "renounced" portions of the House report on the floor of the House and Senate. Petitioner's Brief at 17-18, Underwood (No. 86-1512). This was a pretty outrageous argument, because the portion questioned did not relate to the test being con- sidered in Underwood. As one of the questioners said, "[t]he committee report ... should not be interpreted to suggest that a finding of an agency action that was not supported by substantial evidence would automatically entitle a prevailing party to fees."

My problem with Underwood, and some of the other legislative inaction cases,265 is that the Court short-circuited those arguments by its reliance on the presumption. C. The Presumption of Correctness (Reformulated) and Patterson Given my normative problems with the legislative inaction cases, I should urge the following refined approach: The presumption of cor- rectness should apply for a building block interpretation, so long as those hurt by the interpretation have had some meaningful access to the legislative process. A building block interpretation must be one which is not only authoritative and vertically coherent (reliance), but also horizontally coherent (consistent with current policies). The pre- sumption of correctness can be rebutted by persuasive evidence that Congress in fact has disapproved of the building block interpretation. Consider the issues in Patterson under this approach. Is Runyon a building block interpretation? If so, is the presumption of correctness rebutted by contrary evidence of actual legislative intent? Whether or not Runyon was originally a correct interpretation of section 1981, it has become a building block one, given the descriptive and normative considerations set out above. First, and most impor- tant, its interpretation is both vertically and horizontally coherent. Runyon flowed naturally from the Court's interpretation of section 1982 in Alfred H. Mayer (which was the real turning point) and the experience in the lower courts, and the Court has followed or assumed that interpretation several times in the last decade. Hundreds of pri- vate lawsuits have been brought under section 1981, and the Depart- ment of Justice in Runyon had argued that it favored the interpretation as a way of complementing the Government's enforce- ment of the desegregation mandate in education.266 The interpretation is also consistent with our overall legal and constitutional evolution in the last twenty years. Not only has the legal system remained commit- ted to the antidiscrimination principle in education and employment, but the system has expanded upon it administratively (by denying tax benefits to schools that discriminate), legislatively (the Fees Act in 1976, the Pregnancy Discrimination Act in 1978, the Restoration Act in 1988), and judicially (Bob Jones). That commitment has also been a commitment to providing a "multiplicity" of remedies for victims of discrimination. In short, Runyon's result is consistent at many levels 265. See, e.g., United States v. Shreveport Grain &amp; Elev. Co., 287 U.S. 77, 83-84 (1933) (refusing to rebut presumption of acquiescence in administrative interpretations, despite contrary statements in both House and Senate committee reports). 266.

At the federal level, the best example is the Fees Act. In that statute, Congress assumed that section 1981 provided for private actions and sought to encourage such actions with counsel fee incen- tives. At a more general level, Congress has been encouraging expan- sive civil rights enforcement quite strongly. Indeed, 66 Senators and 118 Members of the House have filed a brief in Patterson asserting their continuing support for, and reliance on, the Runyon interpreta- tion.268 The brief makes it clear that many legislators would consider overruling Runyon not only erroneous, but an interference in Con- gress' agenda, darkly hinting that the Restoration Act of 1988 ought to warn the Court not to interpret civil rights statutes narrowly. "To require the Congress to revisit this issue could jeopardize the closure and repose that we have obtained as a Nation on the issue of racial discrimination."269 At the state level, there is a similar consensus. Forty-seven states have joined in a brief arguing that state remedies for private discrimination would be left inadequate if Runyon were overruled.270 Third, but least important, there may have been some private reli- ance on Runyon. The petitioner in Patterson asserts that she waived her Title VII claims because she did not go through its procedural labyrinth, thinking that she could bring the same claims under section 1981;271 and there may be some other claimants in her position who would lose legal rights through no fault of their own if Runyon were overruled with retroactive effect. Other reliance arguments may exist in this case,272 but in my view they are hard to quantify, and the public reliance arguments are far more persuasive. If Runyon is a building block case, as I think it is, the burden was on Congress to overturn it if it disagreed with its result. Obviously, Congress has not overturned Runyon, and the presumption of its cor- rectness applies in full force. If anything, the presumption is strength- ened by Congress' reliance on the interpretation when it enacted the 267. Runyon, 427 U.S. at 191 (Stevens, J., concurring). 268.

The presumed correctness of Runyon ought to pre- serve the precedent unless it was a clearly incorrect interpretation. I have undertaken no independent research on this issue but am im- pressed by arguments that Runyon was not clearly erroneous.273 In short, if the Court wants to make sense of, and be faithful to, its legislative inaction precedents, Patterson is a classic case for their invo- cation. Indeed, I consider Patterson to be a more appealing case for the invocation of legislative inaction arguments than either Monessen or Underwood. Unlike Monessen, Patterson involves not only a long- standing and well-settled statutory interpretation, but one that is con- sistent with our society's evolving law. Unlike Underwood, Patterson involves a statutory interpretation that not only appears to enjoy con- tinued support in Congress, but is one upon which Congress relied when it passed the Fees Act in 1976. Given the Court's own vow to "treat all litigants equally" when it asked for new briefs in Patter- son,274 it should reaffirm Runyon's building block interpretation. CONCLUSION It is noteworthy that a central theme running through all three of the articles in this Symposium on Patterson is the dynamic nature of statutory interpretation.275 I have defended this general proposition in earlier articles,276 and this article explores its relationship to legislative inaction arguments. From my perspective, the main legisprudential issue raised by these legislative inaction cases is how much we want to emphasize vertical continuity in legal rules, at the expense of flexibility in our system of evolving law. While the Anglo-American legal tradi- tion is one that has placed a great value on vertical continuity in the law, that emphasis is somewhat less tenable today, when most of our law is agency-made rather than judge-made, and when society and its problems change at an ever-increasing pace. The primary threat to law's integrity in modem times is obsolescence rather than unpredict- 273.

Congress itself is the most legitimate institution for achieving greater horizontal coherence. But given the structural inertia and biases of the legislature, it is those who interpret and imple- ment statutes - agencies, the executive, courts - that have the pri- mary burden of fostering horizontal coherence. Read broadly, the legislative inaction cases threaten to exacerbate the problems of inertia and bias - and obsolescence - in our system of government. The rhetoric used by the Supreme Court in these cases can be read to ossify statutory interpretations that have no other virtue save longevity. But the cases need not be read so broadly. A more sensible reading of the cases suggests that some statutory interpreta- tions are building blocks, upon which future law can be constructed, while other interpretations may be aberrations overtaken by subse- quent developments in law and society. As a descriptive theory, the theory of presumed correctness explains the cases and ameliorates the problem of obsolescence. But the theory of presumed correctness for building block interpre- tations is not satisfying as a normative theory, and I believe several of the Court's legislative inaction cases are wrong. If a narrow, well- organized group wins a favorable interpretation - perhaps by fortu- ity, perhaps by sheer perseverance - from the courts, an agency, or the executive, and then builds its own reliance interests and trumpets it to Congress, should the courts or agency not be able to change its mind later, when problems with the interpretation become manifest? I don't see why not, and hence I believe Flood v. Kuhn was wrongly decided. If an early interpretation becomes boilerplate law, cited with approval by courts and even committee reports because of its age and not because of its persuasiveness, should that interpretation not be subject to reevaluation if it becomes seriously inconsistent with current values? I don't see why not, and hence I believe Monessen was wrongly decided. As a normative proposition, the legislative inaction precedents I should not have joined - Catholic Bishop of Chicago and Snyder, as well as Flood and Monessen - are those where the Court has invoked the presumption of correctness for interpretations having strong claims of vertical continuity and (sometimes) private reliance, and weak claims of horizontal continuity and current fairness. For such 277. See generally G. CALABRESI, A COMMON LAW FOR THE AGE OF STATUTES (1982). 123 October 1988]</page><page sequence="58">124 Michigan Law Review [Vol. 87:67 interpretations, I urge a relaxation of the presumption of correctness. Private reliance interests can be protected in such cases by changing the interpretation prospectively, perhaps with a time period for private persons to adapt to the new rule. As for the virtues of vertical con- tinuity, an interpretation that persists over time, yet becomes increas- ingly inconsistent with the surrounding legal terrain, does not have the unambiguous blessing of tradition and often ought to yield to current values and policies.</page><page sequence="59">Interpreting Legislative Inaction APPENDIX 1: ACQUIESCENCE CASES (1961-1988) This appendix collects the main Supreme Court cases decided be- tween 1961 and 1988 in which the Court considered the argument that Congress acquiesced in a judicial, executive, or agency interpretation.
