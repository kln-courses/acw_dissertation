(Signed) R. WHITNEY TUCKER WILLIAM C. MCDERMOTT December 9, 1944 The Treasurer read the following report from Goodwin B. Beach, a member of the Committee on Investments, indicating that the securities in custody of the New York Trust Company had been checked and found to be in good order: Omnia ego ad mensam inspexi nec defuit hilum, Ergo notis recte factis tabulas tibi reddo: Quod dico verum esse manuque et nomine firmo. (Signed) GOODWIN B. BEACH The following report was received and placed on file: REPORT OF THE EDITOR OF PUBLICATIONS Monograph XII, Glossae in Martianum, by.Professor Cora E. Lutz of Wilson College, appeared early in July. It consists of thirty pages of introductory material and sixty-eight pages of text, notes, and appendices. Volume 74 of Transactions and Proceedings was printed in August but owing to the shortage of cartons was not distrib- uted until October. Transactions contains eighteen articles and amounts in all to 306 pages. Proceedings amounts to sixty-eight pages including abstracts of nine papers and the annual bibliographies of 203 members. It was still impossible to secure the exact shade of color of the former binding, and owing to the paper shortage it was necessary to set a limit of 375 pages on the whole volume. Fortunately we did not have to omit any article judged suitable for immediate publication by the various referees, but at the suggestion and with the help of Professor Shero made a considerable cut in Proceedings by omitting the charter and by-laws, the lists of former officers and places of meeting, and the contents of previous volumes, and saved further space by printing the minutes of the meetings of last year, the abstracts, and the bibliographies in smaller type. The Philological Association of the Pacific Coast held no meeting last year and there- fore had no minutes or program to report. We hope that conditions will soon permit our sister association to resume its regular activities.</page><page sequence="18">xviii American Philological Association I wish to express my heartfelt gratitude to all with whom I have had to deal during my three years as Editor for their constant courtesy and helpfulness, and par- ticularly to the secretary, Professor Shero, and to the officers of the Lancaster Press. I wish also to express my complete confidence and satisfaction in welcoming Professor Blake as my successor and my hope that he will enjoy a very pleasant and successful term. On motion from the floor, it was voted that a committee of three be appointed to prepare a resolution expressing the thanks of the Associa- tion to the retiring Secretary-Treasurer and Editor, and that this resolu- tion be included in the minutes of the meeting. [President Winter appointed W. E. Blake, G. D. Hadzsits (chairman), and E. A. Hahn as members of the committee, which drew up the following resolution: The American Philological Association wishes to express its sense of obligation to Professors L. R. Shero and T. Robert S. Broughton, who are retiring from their offices as Secretary-Treasurer and Editor of Publications, respectively. The duties of these offices are so manifold and important that the Association owes the deepest thanks to those who have fulfilled them conscientiously and efficiently. But no mere thanks can possibly express the gratitude we should feel to the two scholars who have given so generously of their time and who have so faithfully per- formed their services, and who, by so doing, have contributed in very large measure to the prestige of the Association which they have represented. The Association exists, largely, for the maintenance of Classical scholarship in our American education-and the services of Professors Shero and Broughton acquire a peculiar significance at this time, because of the disruption of normal educational processes during war. It is our hope that we may be served as well in the future.] On recommendation of the Directors, it was voted that an allowance of not more than $300 per annum be granted to the Secretary-Treasurer for secretarial help, this amount to be supplementary to his honorarium of $500. It was reported that the fqllowing motions had been adopted by the Directors: 1. That $1,000 be transferred from the ordinary account' to invested funds. 2. That the warm thanks of the Association be extended to the committees re- sponsible for the arrangements for the local meetings in Pittsburgh, St. Louis, and New York, and especially to those who are serving as Secretaries for these local meet- ings, Professors James Stinchcomb, W. C. Korfmacher, and E. Adelaide Hahn. 3. That the warm thanks of the Association be extended to the authorities of the University of Pittsburgh for their generous invitation to hold the sessions of this meeting at the University and for hospitably entertaining the members of the Board of Directors at luncheon. 4. That the warm thanks of the Association be extended to the authorities of St. Louis University and Hunter College for their generous hospitality in connection with the meetings held under the auspices of the Association in St. Louis and New York. 5. That the following members be appointed to serve with the Treasurer on the Committee on Investments: G. B. Beach, L. A. Post, H. A. Sanders, L. C. West.</page><page sequence="19">Proceedings for 1944 xix The following report, presented by the chairman of the committee, W. E. Blake, was received and placed on file: REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON PUBLICATION OF MONOGRAPHS The publication of Professor Cora E. Lutz's Dunchad: Glossae in Martianum (Mon- ograph XII) took place in July. The first volume of ProfessorRand'sServiushasagain been delayed by war time conditions, but final printing is now due to begin immediately. Nothing further has been heard from other works tentatively approved, and no new manuscripts have been accepted. The Committee has voted not to consider two manuscripts offered during the year, acceptance of which would run counter to present policies. Since no referee's fees were paid, the Monograph Fund has at the present been diminished only by the cost of publishing Monograph XII. Other expenses in prospect, however, make the present balance not more than comfortable. On completing his term of office, the Chairman wishes his successor, Professor Coulter, as much pleasure as he has enjoyed from the kindly and helpful support of fellow members, referees, and contributors. The following report, presented by the chairman of the committee, B. D. Meritt, was received and placed on file: REPORT OF THE COMMITTEE ON MATERIALS FOR RESEARCH The following information about aids to research has been reported to the Com- mittee. A bibliography of American publication in the field of the Classics entitled Classica Americana has been completed at the University of Illinois by Professor W. A. Old- father and students who have been working in consultation with him and is now ready for the press (see Classical Weekly 30.235-236). The intention of the editors has been to include all contributions to the Classics by Americans, wherever published, and by foreigners, if published in America, covering the period down to ca. 1453 A.D. for the East and ca. 600 A.D. for the West. There are also brief biographical data for those whose names appear in the bibliography. This volume was announced as almost ready for the press in the Proceedings of this Association for 1942 (p. xxi). Another publication which was expected to appear in 1943 and which was an- nounced in the Proceedings of this Association for 1942 is the Index to the first ten volumes of Hesperia and to its first six supplements, covering the years from 1932 to 1941 inclusive. The Index of Greek names, which will comprise about half the volume, is now largely in galley proof. The general index has been completed and will be set in type early in 1945. The date of publication will probably be the summer of 1945. Work on the collaborative project in Athenian Prosopography, which was to be under the general supervision of Mr. W. K. Pritchett, mentioned in these Proceedings for 1941 (p. xx), has had to be postponed because of the absence of many contributors in the war. Some progress, however, is being made, and Professor James Notopoulos reports that he has alphabetized the names found on many of the Athenian ephebic inscriptions. War conditions have impeded the contemplated transfer of the headquarters of Prosopographia Christiana from Fordham to Washington. Excerpts from pertinent authors continued to come in to Fordham. In particular, laborers at St. Bonaventure College were diligent and accurate in listing prosopographical material from Ammianus</page><page sequence="20">xx American Philological Association Marcellinus, the Historiae Augustae, and Tertullian. However, the direction is tend- ing more and more to put the stress on epigraphical studies in the Christian field. Mr. W. Leonard Grant has begun to collect materials for an index to the rhetorical works of Cicero. He invites correspondence, from anyone interested, to be addressed to him at Naval Service Headquarters, Ottawa, Canada. A pamphlet, entitled Basic International, written by L. J. J. Nye and John Bostock, was presented to the Association by Mayor La Guardia and referred to your Committee. It advocates a universal language which every country will teach its people to use as their second tongue and gives suggestions for the selection of material. Your Committee has taken no action. The request set forth in the Proceedings for 1942 (p. xxii) for information concern- ing available photostats of the manuscripts of Aeschylus to supplement those now made available at Harvard University from a legacy of the late Professor Herbert Weir Smyth has brought notice from Professor W. A. Oldfather that a very considerable collection of photographs and photostats exists at the University of Illinois, repre- senting something like six hundred Greek and Latin manuscripts. The originals thus reproduced range in date from about 517 A.D. down to the seventeenth century. The pertinent data concerning any author will be furnished upon application to the University of Illinois. The following report, read by T. R. S. Broughton, was received and placed on file: REPORT OF THE DELEGATES OF THE ASSOCIATION TO THE AMERICAN COUNCIL OF LEARNED SOCIETIES The ACLS continues to devote its major activity to war services, acting as a consultative body on research and personnel problems for various government agencies. Important projects are, as described in our report last year, the Intensive Language Program with the attendant area studies, the Ethnographic Board which provides information on strategic areas, and the Committee on the Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas. At the request of the Directors of the American Philological Association, your delegates in January 1944 presented to the Council of the ACLS a letter urging that the Committee on the Protection of Cultural Treasures give special attention, if pos- sible through the appointment of a sub-committee, to the preservation of manuscripts and valuable printed books in European libraries. Professor W. B. Dinsmoor, the chairman of the ACLS Committee on the Protection of Cultural Treasures in War Areas, reported to your representatives that the preservation of monuments is now in the hands of the Commission nominated by the President of the United States for the Protection and Salvage of Historical Monuments in Europe and that a sub- committee under the chairmanship of Mr. Archibald MacLeish, Librarian of the Library of Congress, is concerned with the preservation of manuscripts and valuable books. Professor E. K. Rand is a member of that sub-committee. The ACLS is at the same time studying post-war plans for education, with special emphasis on the humanities. At the annual meeting of the Council, the 25th anni- versary gathering to be held at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in Boston on January 25-26, 1945, an entire session is to be devoted to the role and functions of the Council in the post-war period. Of possible interest to our Association is a project for translating into English representative works of Russian scholarship in the humanities. The project is to be supported by a subvention of $50,000 from the Rockefeller Foundation.</page><page sequence="21">Proceedings for 1944 xxi Applications for grants in aid of research continue to be much less numerous than in pre-war years. Of the awards made, a considerable number has gone to scholars who have embarked on linguistic studies which are related to the Intensive Language Program. For the delegates, G. L. Hendrickson and L. R. Taylor, LILY Ross TAYLOR The Secretary read a list of the papers which had been submitted by members of the Association in response to the usual invitation sent out in the autumn. The list contained, in addition to papers included in the programs of local meetings given below, the following titles: "What Are Teretes Plagas?" William Hardy Alexander, University of Califprnia. "An Oath of Hannibal, Elias J. Bickerman, Ecole Libre des Hautes Etudes. "Gothic, Too, Is Classical," Frederika Blankner, Adelphi College. "The Meaning and Use of Sed Enim," Joseph Fontenrose, University of California.

"Divine Communication in Thucydides," Robert George Hoerber, Bethany Lutheran College. "Theocritean Resemblances," Raymond Mandra, Hunter College. "The Successor of Speusippus," Philip Merlan, Scripps College. "The Mozarabic Hymnal," Ruth Ellis Messenger, Hunter College. "Two Greek Ostraca," Verne B. Schuman, Indiana University. "Exclamatory Particles in Classical Greek Literature," Famee Lorene Shisler, Mt. Vernon Seminary and Junior College. A motion that the following memorial (prepared by a committee consisting of G. E. Duckworth, A. C. Johnson, and B. D.. Meritt, chair- man) be spread on the minutes was adopted: Andrew Fleming West was born here in Pittsburgh on May 17, 1853. He died on December 27, 1943, in Princeton, New Jersey. As a life member of the American Philological Association, he was from the date of his first enrollment always active in its affairs, and he was elected its President for 1901-1902. Perhaps no man came to be better known during his lifetime as a champion of the Classics. He was one of the founders of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome and served as chairman of the committee of the School for more than a decade. As chairman of the Department of Classics at Princeton University he traveled widely in the United States making the acquaintance of younger men who might act as preceptors in the classical curriculum, and subsequently he organized an honors course in the classical humanities. In 1917 he gathered together a representative group of citizens to determine what should be done to maintain the Classics. Out of this gathering grew the American Classical League, which drew its inspiration from his vigorous personality. He was interested in all the broader aspects of humanistic study. He wrote not only textbooks for students but also exhortations for a larger public. His more general works include: "American Liberal Education" (1907), "The Value of the Classics" (1917), and "The War and Education" (1919). Among his honorary degrees was that of Doctor of Letters from Oxford University in 1902; and he brought much of Oxford tradition to the founding of the Princeton Graduate School, where he served as Dean from 1901 to 1928. He retired from teach- ing and from formal academic obligations in 1928, but continued in his later years</page><page sequence="22">xxii American Philological Association his many friendships and his perpetual interest in the education of American scholars. He bore advancing years with dignity and with charm, and practised the teachings of that Roman philosophy which he himself had taught, that old age is not alone a time of sorrow but also a time of joy. Humanistic scholarship had found in him a zealous advocate, and equally a worthy example. The meeting then adjourned. B. LOCAL MEETINGS Because of war conditions, members living at a distance were not urged to attend the business session. The Directors therefore. made provision for the holding of regional meetings, organized by local groups, under the auspices of the Association. Three such meetings were held. In Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, a meeting was held on Saturday, December 16, 1944, at the Cathedral of Learning (University of Pitts- burgh). Arrangements for the meeting were in charge of James Stinch- comb. Sessions were held at 9:30 A.M., at 3:15 P.M. (following the business session of the Association), and at 8:00 P.M.

The Middle Voice in the De Senectute, by Edith Frances Claflin, Barnard College, Columbia University. In a paper on "The Nature of the Latin Passive in the Light of Recent Discoveries," AJPh 48 (1927) 157-175, the writer advanced the theory that in Latin, as in other Indo-European languages, the passive is essentially a develop- ment of the inherited middle voice. It is a specialization in appropriate context of the reflexive, or intransitive, meaning of the Indo-European middle. In Classical Latin the middle voice is, in fact, in much more vigorous and living use than is generally recognized. By examining the De Senectute of Cicero, in the manner of an exploratory shaft in archaeology, the present paper illustrates by specific instances the lively character of "middle" uses of the so-called "pas- sive" in idiomatic Latin prose of the best period. It is significant that these uses fall naturally into the categories set up by Delbrueck for Indo-European Media Tantum. Proof that the interpretation of these forms as middle is the correct one is sometimes supplied by the context. So in the following passages the italicized words show that extinguitur in the first and agitetur in the second must be taken as middle, not passive: Itaque adulescentes mihi mori sic videntur, ut cum aquae multitudine flammae vis opprimitur, senes autem sic, ut cum sua sponte nulla adhibita vi consumptus ignis extinguitur (De Senectute 71); cumque semper agitetur animus nec principium motus habeat, quia se ipse moveat (ibid. 78). Similarly, in the following sentence: Ut Turpione Ambivio magis delectatur, qui in prima cavea spectat, delectatur tamen etiam, qui in ultima, sic adulescentia voluptates propter intuens magis fortasse laetatur, sed delectatur etiam senectus procul eas spectans tantum, quantum sat est (ibid. 48), not only is delectatur 'delights in' paralleled by the deponent verb laetatur, but also the syntax of Turpione A mbivio, without a preposition, excludes the idea that it could be ablative of the agent with a passive verb. 2. Divine Communicationt in Thucydides, by Robert George Hoerber, Bethany College. This paper proposes to examine the evidence in Thucydides concerning the fifth-century belief on communication with the gods. The references to eclipses and earthquakes, together with the statements concerning oracles and frontier sacrifices, reveal two distinct levels of thought concerning the means and manner of divine communication. The one respects the oracles and frontier sacrifices as means of divine communication. The other includes also the xpiieru'oX6-ot, earth- quakes, and eclipses. The one is based on the usual religious practices of the Greeks; the other goes beyond these means and, under various times of stress, interprets phenomena of nature as means through which the gods -communicate their will to men. The one represents the ordinary religious concepts of the Greeks; the other is more akin to practices such as astrology, palm-reading, and</page><page sequence="26">xxvi American Philological A ssociation fortune-telling. The one is deeply religious; the other is superstitious. The one apparently prevailed during normal conditions; the other arose especially at critical moments. 3. Iste Deiktikon in the Early Roman Dramatists, by Ruth M. Keller, Philadelphia, Pa. [An abstract of this paper was not submitted since the paper is to appear elsewhere.] 4. Theocritean Resemblances, by Raymond Mandra, Hunter College. The classical student who either took part in the invasion of Sicily with Gen. Lucian K. Trmscott's Third Division of the Seventh U. S. Army, or as a member of the AMG was in the staff of Colonel George H. McCaffrey at Licata, might well have been astonished at the large number of Sicilian customs which reminded him of those that he had read about in Theocritus' Idylls. A research was made into Idylls I-XV to select customs that have a striking resemblance to those of modern Sicily, and the results are set forth in this paper. These customs relate to: 1) Buying and selling; 2) Farmers at work; 3) Food; 4) Censure against foolishness; 5) Lovers' presents; 6) Magic, precautions to ward off the evil eye, philters; 7) Money; 8) Poetical compositions and their special characteristics; 9) Praise and blame; 10)' Religious festivals; 11) Super- stitions; 12) Women involved in comparisons; 13) The bride's sorrow at the departure from her home; 14) Women's beauty; 15) Women's ugliness. In each instance besides the Greek of Theocritus quotations are given of a word, or a phrase, or a poem of the modern Sicilian literature that express the particular custom under discussion. 5. The Successor of Speusippus, by Philip Merlan, Scripps College. At the time of Speusippus' death, the members of the Academy still con- sidered Aristotle as one of them. They even thought of electing him to succeed Speusippus as the head of the Academy. Obviously at that time they did not see in Aristotle's doctrines anything incompatible with their own philosophic convictions. 6. Cicero's Discussion of Immortality and Epicureanism, by Mary N. Porter Packer, Brooklyn College. In his desire for immortality, Cicero found one element of his controversy with Epicureanism. The first book of the Tusculan Disputations suggests that 1. Cicero desired to believe with Plato in a future life, and achieved a waver- ing hope; 2. This feeling strengthened his aversion to Epicureanism, in which, however, in time of despondency, he was perhaps somewhat tempted to believe; 3. The first Tusculan may have been in part a reply to the third book of Lucretius' poem, De Rerum Natura.</page><page sequence="27">Proceedings for 1944 xxvii Any estimate of Cicero's character should consider his philosophical works, as well as his other writings. The Tusculans, written at a ime when Cicero was suffering from political disaster and personal bereavement, deal with topics wherein Cicero particularly differed with Epicureanism: death, pain, distress, emotional disquiet, personal integrity. It is usually assumed that the initials, M. and A., indicating the two speakers in the dialogue, represent Magister and Auditor respectively. But in the First Tusculan, the conversation between the two speakers is so harmonious that the iqitials might well represent Marcus and Animus, Cicero and his soul, in meditation. Marcus, the logical Academic, ponders the evidences of immor- tality, while his more impulsive inmost self longs to be convinced. Both declare that they would rather be wrong with Plato than right with his opponents. M. admits that the Epicureans may be right, but adds with irony that he sees no cause therein for exultation. At this and at other points, Cicero may be taking issue with Lucretius. In the Tusculan Disputations, as in his other philosophical works, Cicero reveals high personal standards of uprightness. An evaluation of his public and private life should give due consideration both to the ideals thus expressed and to the varying ethical standards of those with whom he had to do. 7. Exclamatory Particles in Classical Greek Literature, by Famee Lorene Shisler, Mount Vernon Seminary and Junior College. [An abstract of this paper was not submitted, since the paper is to appear elsewhere.] 8. "Body" or "Lower Soul"?, by Charles J. Treacy, Villa Maria College. Is it the "body" or the "lower soul" that antagonizes the "higher soul" in the Platonic ethic? We reply-both. That the villain is a hermaphrodite, is quite in line with the method and metaphysic of the Theory of Ideas. On asking the question, "What is the lower soul?" the answer comes back, "It is not really soul, but it is soul in a kind of way (see Sophist 240 for the terms). That places the lower soul in the realm of phenomena, of ambiguities, of contradictory things; for the language used is that of the Theory of Ideas and puts the higher soul in the relative position to the lower of Idea to Phenomenon. The lower soul, accordingly, is quite methodically a thing with two frames of -reference and is equally entitled to the name "soul" or "body" though it is strictly neither. The terms are not really convertible for "just soul" or "just body," but are so for the mid-term of the triad, Reason, Lower Soul, Body. In strict technical terms, the "lower soul" is neither soul nor body, but becomes like to both at once. Such a solution is easiest on the texts, suits best the method of triads by regarding the "lower soul" as the mean proportional between extremes, and gathers up the difficulty of ambiguity into the wider arms of its metaphysical antecedents. It is also reached by an approach from the metaphysic of body. This solution involves us, though with respectful reverence, in a polemic with Professor Shorey's view in the Unity of Plato's Thought. We have shown that</page><page sequence="28">xxviii American Philological Association Plato is not definitive, but he is so quite methodically; to Shorey's statement that "sensation must be strictly a matter of soul" we reply that it need not be a matter of strict soul, and that in fact it cannot be; as regards the text that pleasures "come through the body" -from which Shorey infers they are not of the body-we may reply with equal technical accuracy that they do not touch the real soul.. They are begotten of both in a third, the body-soul part. Finally there is no such thing as a real body. Body is not-being in various guises-here in the guise of a sensi- tive function.</page><page sequence="29">Proceedings for 1944 xxix IV.

TRANSACTIONS AND PROCEEDINGS The annually published Transactions of the American Philological Association give the full text of such papers as the Directors decide to publish. The annually published Proceedings contain the program and minutes of the annual meeting, brief abstracts of papers submitted, a record of the publications of members of the Association, lists of its officers and members, and miscellaneous information. The Transactions and Proceedings are issued in a single volume. The Trans- actions are not published separately; a limited number of separate copies of the Pro- ceedings is available each year. In some instances offprints of separate articles are also available for purchase. The price of recent volumes of Transactions and Pro- ceedings (beginning with volume LIV) is $4. Members in good standing receive current volumes free. New members on joining receive the latest issue of Proceedings. For the contents of the Transactions, volumes i-xxxiv inclusive, see volume xxxiv, pp. cxliii ff.; for volumes XXXV-XLVII, volume XLVII, pp. lxxxviii ff.; for volumes XLVIII-LVIII, volume LIX, pp. xcvi ff.; for volumes LIX-LXVIII, volume LXIX, pp. CiX ff.; for volumes LXIX-LXXII, volume LXXIII, pp. IxXiX ff. The " Transactions for" any given year have usually not been published in that year. To avoid mistakes in ordering back volumes, please give in each instance either the number of the volume desired or the year for which it was issued (not the year of publication). The Transactions for 1869 and 1870 form Volume I. A volume has been published for each year thereafter. The number of the volume for any given year can be found by subtracting 1869 from the number of the year. B. PHILOLOGICAL MONOGRAPHS Monograph I.
