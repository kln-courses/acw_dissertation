<plain_text><page sequence="1">HORIZONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY: AN ALTERNATING PROCESS IN THE RISE OF CIVILIZATIONS Gordon R. Willey The Precolumbian culture sequences for Mesoamerica and Peru, the two New World areas where native civi- lizations attained their greatest complexity, show, in each case, an alternation between periods of horizon-style unifications andperiods of marked regional stylistic diversity. It is the thesis of the present essay that this alternating process of intense regional interaction broken by periods of lesser interaction is a vital one in the rise to civilizational complexity. Las secuencias de las culturas precolombinas para Mesoamerica y el Peru, las dos areas del Nuevo Mundo donde las civilizaciones nativas alcanzaron su mayor complejidad, demuestran, en cada caso, una alternancia entre periodos de unificaci6n de horizonte estilo y perfodos de marcada diversidad estilistica regional. Es la tesis del presente ensayo que el proceso alternante de intensiva acci6n reciproca regional interrumpida por periodos de menos interacci6n es vital en el ascenso hacia la complejidad de la civilizaci6n. My title concerns a process that I think can be observed in the growth of some ancient civiliza- tions. While this process may be something that has gone on-and still goes on-universally, I will restrict most of my remarks geographically and chronologically to Precolumbian Mesoamerica and Peru. When we look at the archaeology of these areas in diachronic perspective, the most striking thing we will observe on the time charts for both of them is an almost rhythmic chronological alternation of periods of cultural integration with periods of marked regionalism. It will be my thesis that such an alternation of horizonal integration and regional diversity is a vital, perhaps even a necessary, process in the rise to that social, cultural, ideological, economic, and political complexity which, taken as a whole, we refer to as civilization. I should say at the outset that I do not think my thesis or hypothesis can be proved or even "tested"-at least not in the large and at the present time. Certain parts or aspects of it might be susceptible to "testing" in specific situations, though for the time being I am not interested in that. What I am offering now is simply a description of a pattern in the data. Like any such empirical observation, it suggests or implies explanations-and I will speculate about these-but it is not an explanation in itself. As archaeologists, we may differ as to how worthwhile such broad observations may be. I must confess to being fascinated by those large patterns of similarity or contrast in the data, and for a long time I have had an undisciplined interest in them (Willey 1950, 1955a, 1955b, 1960, 1962). Perhaps this is because I always have thought it a good idea for archaeologists to take an occasional "high-elevation flyer" over their data. I think that this may be especially so now in view of the fact that the profession, by and large, has been working pretty "close to the ground" in recent years. So, for a change, I propose that we go up a few thousand feet, and look at the landscape of Precolumbian culture history from there. I am not arguing that we should stay up there all the time. As we all know, if you stay up there too long, you are in danger of disappearing off into thin air, but a temporary shift in perspective is good for us all-at least every now and then. I suppose at this point, before getting down to the business of my topic, I should identify myself "theoretically" -if this is at all possible. Given my age, it should not be surprising that I was brought up in what we can probably call the "Culture Historical School" of American archaeology. In the Gordon R.

Copyright C) 1991 by the Society for American Archaeology 197</page><page sequence="2">198 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 56, No. 2, 1991 late 1940s and the 1950s, I was active and much interested in the kind of functionally interpretive archaeology that is best exemplified in settlement pattern studies (Willey 1951 a, 1953, 1956; Willey et al. 1965). Later, I was disposed favorably toward the "new archaeology" and "neo-evolutionism" (Willey 1977; Willey and Sabloff 1974), in spite of the excessive polemical dust storms that often accompanied the asseverations and admonitions of this school of thought. Now, in my old age, you can count me as one who is supportive of such things as the formulation of "middle-range theories" (Binford 1977) or the study of "site-formation processes" (Schiffer 1976, 1987)-if I do not have to pursue these particular lines of investigation myself. But then there is no reason why I should. There are a lot more of us around now than there used to be, and we can do different things. Today, I also think I can understand most of the complaints and some of the desires of the postprocessual, or "deconstructionist," generation in archaeology (Earle and Preucel 1987; Hodder 1985, 1986; Leone 1986; Patterson 1989; Shanks and Tilley 1987). While they follow many different lines of argument, I think they are expressing a common dissatisfaction with what they fear as a dehumanizing bleakness of processual or new archaeology. That such a wave of protest should arise is not at all surprising. Those who have not read Trigger's (1989) A History ofArchaeological Thought should do so. Trigger tells how the discipline of archaeology, from its infancy to the present, has swung back and forth between the poles of what, for want of better terms, we can call the "scientific" and the "humanistic" modes of address. As one reviews this history, I think one would have to agree that much of the admirable edifice of archaeology as we know it-incorporating such things as the principles of typology, seriation, stratigraphy, and artifactual association, as well as the formalization of theories for bridging from archaeological data to human behavior-is largely a contribution of the "scientific" tradition. But at the same time, the "humanistic" tradition has kept alive the idea that cultural choice, human choice, always has been an important element in guiding our destiny, from remote times forward, and that there is no easy way to formulate covering laws that will predict what these choices will be. Clearly, archaeology must draw upon both the "scientific" and the "humanistic." In saying this, I also deny that it is an eclectic "cop-out." For, after all, archaeology is concerned with the whole of the human past, not just some segment of it. We need to look at that past through the eyes of both science and humanism-just as we ourselves, in our own lives, must look at things in this way. Having indulged in this digression, let me get back to my subject. I will review, in the space that I have, the main outlines of the Precolumbian culture history of Mesoamerica, and then of Peru, the areas of the great native American civilizations. In each case, I will be concerned with their development from a base line of about 2500 B.C. up to the coming of the first Spanish conquis- tadores-a substantial time span in human history of some 4,000 years. I will then take a comparative look at their respective horizonal integrations and their periods of regional diversity and draw some speculative conclusions from this. MESOAMERICA Mesoamerica, that southern two-thirds of Mexico, the immediate Central American republics below it, and portions of others still farther south and east, began to take on the characteristics of a coherent archaeological culture area late in the third millennium B.C. and had consolidated this coherence by the middle of the succeeding millennium (see Kirchoff 1943; Lowe 1978; MacNeish 1964; Tolstoy 1978; Willey 1966:78-177, 1978). The economic base of this culture area with time depth was a maize-beans-squash-chili pepper agricultural complex, with society organized into simple, autonomous sedentary villages. A very general cultural unity of the area as a whole was evident in numerous shared traits in ceramics, textiles, and other manufactures, as well as in the basic subsistence pattern, but, by and large, the Mesoamerica of that time was organized into numerous small, regionally differentiated societies. Then, in the centuries between ca. 1500 and 1000 B.C., the simple autonomous villages were modified by the appearances of the first public buildings or ceremonial centers, clear signs of the beginnings of a change to a more complex social order. It is at this particular stage in the development of mesoamerican Early Formative cultures</page><page sequence="3">Willey] HORIZONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY 199 that we also have the first evidences of horizonal integration. It is signaled by the appearance of Olmec art. The Olmec style is one of the best known in mesoamerican archaeology. Although sometimes it seems difficult to find two experts on Olmec art who will agree on just what constitutes the legitimate body of that art, there is still consensus about a number of basic themes (see various essays for conflicting and concordant opinions in Benson [1968]; Coe et al. [1981]; Joralemon [1971]; and Sharer and Grove [1989]). The were-jaguar, or anthropomorphized jaguar, is accepted generally as the central iconographic feature of the style; human representations, if not "jaguarized" in appear- ance, often have a "baby-faced" aspect; and to these themes we can add such decorative motifs as the "jaguar-paw-wing," the "St. Andrew's cross," and the "fire-serpent" designs. The Olmec also had a penchant for full-round or relief sculpting, either in stone or in clay, with sculptures ranging in size from small figurines to great monuments. Ceramics that bear Olmec incised or modeled decoration tend to be reduced fired and dark in appearance. There are, however, marked regional differences in Olmec, or Olmec-associated, ceramics and other manufactures. Thus, for example, except for a few shared design motives, the pottery of Gulf Coast Olmec sites has little in common with that found in Olmec-related sites in Oaxaca or central Mexico. Similarly, the famed monumental sculptures of the Gulf Coast sites are not found in all regions and cultures that are linked by other manifestations of the Olmec style. There are some sharp differences of opinion as to the role of the Olmec in the rise of mesoamerican civilization. Were they the sole instigators of the change from simple to complex society as reflected in the construction of the first ceremonial centers? Some authorities would answer this question affirmatively (Coe 1968a, 1968b, 1989) holding that the Early Formative period inhabitants of southern Veracruz and Tabasco-the region that most frequently is conceded to be the original homeland of the archaeological Olmec-were, indeed, the first people in Mesoamerica to attain to a level of complex society and civilization and that they then "carried the torch" from their Veracruz- Tabascan hearth, to other, less advanced peoples and regions of Mesoamerica. Other scholars would see the Gulf Coast Olmec as simply one society among many others of southern and central Mesoamerica who participated in the interrelated achievement of building mesoamerican civilization (Demarest 1989). But the more important thing, at least in the context of my presentation here, is that this first mesoamerican horizonal integration must have had a strong ideological theme, a theme expressed in the highly idiosyncratic Olmec art style, wherever that particular style and the ideas behind it may have first originated. Thus, by the beginnings of the Middle Formative, Mesoamerica, from western El Salvador to the Valley of Mexico, had become an integrated ideological sphere, an Oikoumene, one in which its many parts-its regional cultures and its different linguistic and ethnic groups-were to some important degree linked by mutually held ideas. As noted, Olmec art began to appear at some time after 1500 B.C. There is, however, some debate about its exact dating. Some mesoamericanists want to define an early Olmec horizon from 1200 to 900 B.C. and a later one from 900 to 600 B.C. (Coe 1968b; Coe and Diehl 1980; Lowe 1989); rival opinion is suspicious of the dating of the early horizon and would prefer to place all of Olmec art between ca. 800 and 400 B.C. (Demarest 1989). What generally seems agreed upon, however, is that after about 400 B.C., or the beginnings of the mesoamerican Late Formative period, Olmec Horizon art largely had disappeared. The Late Formative (400 B.C.-A.D. 200) and the Early Classic (A.D. 200-450/650) periods were a time of regional diversity in Mesoamerica, with the emergence of a number of regional art styles. Some of these, as at Tres Zapotes (Drucker 1943a) and Cerro de las Mesas (Drucker 1943b), in the old Olmec heartland of the Gulf Coast, have Olmec residues and are sometimes referred to as "Olmecoid" or "Epi-Olmec"; others, such as the Tajin style (Proskouriakoff 1954) of Central Veracruz, the Izapa style (Graham 1979; Quirarte 1973; Smith 1984) of Pacific Chiapas, or the early Maya styles of both the Guatemalan Highlands (Miles 1965) and Lowlands (Proskouriakoff 1965), while retaining what can be recognized as transformed Olmec elements, stand forth more clearly as new and vigorous entities in their own right. In general, this period of approximately 800 years between 400 B.C. and A.D. 450 was a time of cultural growth and innovation in the several regional settings of Mesoamerica, especially those of the southern and central part of the area. It</page><page sequence="4">200 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 56, No. 2, 1991 was as if the potential opened up by the ideology propagated during the Olmec horizonal integration was now richly exploited by these regional cultures. Throughout, the settlement landscape was that of the ceremonial center-cum-village. The egalitarian society now had been replaced completely by an hierarchically structured one, with, everywhere, the power of hierarchy proclaimed by the pyr- amids and temples that marked the precincts of the rulers and the upper classes. This was the time of Kaminaljuyu, Monte Alban, Izapa, Tajin, and the lowland Maya cities of the Peten (for general references see Adams [1977]; Sabloff [1981]; Wauchope and Willey [1965a, 1965b]; Weaver [1981] Willey [1966:78-177]). Hieroglyphic writing and calendrical inscriptions, occurring first in Middle- to-Late Formative times on the Gulf Coast and in Oaxaca, and then in Late Formative Chiapas and Guatemala, now were carried to a florescence in the richly complex Classic Maya writing and time-counting systems. The great regional art styles flourished as seen in the Lowland Maya wall paintings or figure-painted polychrome pottery, in Tajin Totonac sculptures, in the elaborately modeled Monte Alban funeral urns, and the Thin Orange pottery and mold-made figurines of Teotihuacan. Everywhere fine craft goods were produced in quantity to accompany the burials of the regional aristocrats, and dense residential zones were arising around the pyramids and temples of the ceremonial centers. It was out of one of these wellsprings of Late Formative-Early Classic regional diversity that the second major horizonal force of Mesoamerica arose. This was the large urban center of Teotihuacan, in the Valley of Mexico. Teotihuacan had its beginnings as a ceremonial center in the Late Formative period, but in the last century B.C. and the first century A.D. it enjoyed a rapid and impressive population growth, expanding from a town of around 5,000 inhabitants to a city of 80,000. This extraordinary increase then continued until the fifth century A.D., by which time the city's population had increased to an estimated 125,000-200,000 persons, all living in a densely settled area of 20 kM2, with the urban residents grouped around a carefully laid out central ceremonial precinct of mammoth pyramids, great concourses, and elaborate palaces (Millon 1967, 1973; Weaver 1981: 189-225 ). It was the largest city in all of Mesoamerica, and its influences were felt far beyond the central Mexican uplands, extending out to both coasts and from the Maya rain forests of the south to the deserts of northwestern Mexico. These influences are reflected in art, iconography, architecture, and trade goods, particularly concentrated on a time horizon between A.D. 450 and 650, or the last 200 years of the mesoamerican Early Classic period (Cowgill 1983; Price 1976; Sanders and Price 1968; Tolstoy 1978). Like the Olmec Horizon, that of Teotihuacan has its appropriate iconographic symbols (Kubler 1967; Pasztory 1974; Von Winning 1948). One of these is a Tlaloc or rain-god representation in which the key diagnostic element is a "goggle eye" or a semiclosed eye; another is a feathered serpent. Ideology, religious ideology, certainly is implied; however, the Teotihuacan Horizon is not as intensely focused upon strictly artistic themes as is Olmec. Instead, it is characterized by such things as architectural features-the tablero-talud type of terrace used in the construction of public buildings being the prime example-or by manufactures such as Thin Orange pottery. While the distinctive Thin Orange may not have been manufactured at the Teotihuacan site-indeed, a Pueblan or Tlaxcalan source seems more likely-there seems little doubt but that the Teotihuacan state con- trolled its exchange to other parts of Mesoamerica. Various specialized vessel forms are associated with it and with the Teotihuacan Horizon, including slab-footed tripod jars with nobbed lids, tall floreros, and distinctive modeled incensarios. These forms frequently were imitated in various local regional-pottery styles, as in the examples from lowland Maya tombs in which Teotihuacan-like tripod jars were painted or carved with typically Maya designs. Mold-made pottery figurines were another Teotihuacan innovation that appeared first in pre-horizon times. Later, during the Teoti- huacan Horizon period, the mold process was disseminated widely throughout Mesoamerica. To all of this can be added the raw material, green obsidian, which was exported from its sources in central Mexico to all parts of Mesoamerica under the aegis of the Teotihuacan state. The intensity of Teotihuacan horizonal influence usually can be correlated with the distance from that great site (Millon 1981). That is, there is a predictably strong core zone of Teotihuacan traits centering on the Valley of Mexico and adjoining portions of the states of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala. A</page><page sequence="5">Willey] HORIZONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY 201 secondary core margin of somewhat lessened Teotihuacan influence extends out from this primary core to include larger portions of these two states as well as much of Morelos and parts of Puebla and Guerrero. In addition, there are also well-marked corridors of Teotihuacan influence extending eastward and southeastward from central Mexico into Veracruz and Oaxaca. For examples, both Tajin and Monte Alban show very definite Teotihuacan artistic and architectural ties to Teotihuacan. In western and northwestern Mexico the Teotihuacan influence is slightly less but is still well represented by Thin Orange ceramics and such items as stone masks. In the far south and east, in Maya country, the force of Teotihuacan is still felt, although here it is spottier, most frequently showing up in the largest and most important sites, such as Kaminaljuyu, in the highlands and Tikal in the lowlands. The Teotihuacan Horizon impresses one as being much more involved with trade and commerce than does the Olmec Horizon. The wide distributions of manufactured goods and raw materials controlled by the city are strong evidences for this. To what degree was this Teotihuacan commercial hegemony enforced politically, or even militarily (Bernal 1966)? Some archaeologists have inter- preted the evidence this way, seeing the stelae figures at distant Classic Maya Tikal, for example, as indicative of the presence of Teotihuacan overlords at that site, or the tablero-talud pyramids at Kaminaljuyu the work of Teotihuacan colonizers in the Guatemalan Highlands. Others-probably a majority-while acknowledging the commercial, as well as the religious prestige of that city, stop short of translating this as true imperial power. In this connection, and in attempting to evaluate Teotihuacan as an imperial presence, it has been pointed out that the monumental art of the city, especially its famed murals, is singularly lacking in militaristic motifs, a circumstance that would argue against a "conquest-state" interpretation; however, this should not be taken to mean that all was sweetness, light, and benevolence. Recent excavations within the ceremonial precincts of Teo- tihuacan have come upon what appear to be the sacrificed remains of high-status individuals, quite possibly rival rulers from other cities or states (G. L. Cowgill, personal communication 1989-1990; Sugiyama 1989). At about A.D. 650, Teotihuacan was put to the torch, quite probably as a result of conquest by northern barbarian, or at least less civilized, invaders. Its power was ended, and with that the Teotihuacan Horizon came to an end (Diehl and Berlo 1989). This inaugurated a second major mesoamerican period of regional diversity that lasted over the next several centuries-or what would be the equivalent of the Late Classic through most of the Postclassic periods (see Weaver 1981: 185-480). During this time a succession of city states took over the hegemony of central Mexico: first Cholula (Garcia Cook 1981), then Xochicalco (Litvak-King 1972), and then Tula (Diehl and Benfer 1975). Later, what has been referred to as the Mixteca-Puebla culture prevailed over much of the central Mexican region, though political power was divided among a number of petty polities (Nicholson 1976, 1978). In other mesoamerican regions, where Teotihuacan authority and influence had been less strong, the Classic regional cultural traditions continued into the Late Classic and Postclassic periods. Oaxaca and the Maya regions would be examples of this. Nevertheless, in spite of the regional-cultural separatism of the times, there were some notable interregional exchanges of influence. Thus, some post-Teotihuacan central Mexican elements are seen in Late Classic and Early Postclassic architectural sculpture at Maya cities in northern Yucatan (Sharp 1978), as well as at Mitla, in Oaxaca, and on the Pacific slopes of Guatemala the Late Classic Cotzumalhuapa style (Parsons 1969) reflects another strain of central Mexican influence. Nor was all of this interchange in a central Mexico-to-the-south direction. Xochicalco has a set of very Lowland Mayan Late Classic- style terrace reliefs, and Cacaxtla, in Tlaxcala, is well known for its Maya-style wall paintings (Nagao 1989). But it should be stressed that these various examples of interregional influences-while more common than what had gone on in pre-Teotihuacan Horizon times-still do not assemble or cohere into anything as unified or as extensive as the preceding Olmec or Teotihuacan horizons. This post-Teotihuacan horizonal diversity was coterminous with a time of troubles marked by intra- and interregional endemic warfare, as well as by the frequent movement of peoples from one region to another. There were probably two basic causes for this "time of troubles." One was pressure on the civilized regions of central Mexico by the semibarbaric peoples from the northwest. The</page><page sequence="6">202 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 56, No. 2, 1991 earlier waves of their southward migrations had helped bring about the fall of Teotihuacan, and later incursions from the north led to continued dislodgments, disruptions, and wars. The second cause for the time of troubles was overall population growth in Mesoamerica, with competition for lands becoming more intensified. In saying this, I do not relegate all violence and warfare in native Mesoamerica to the Late Classic and Postclassic periods, but I think that the evidence for its increase in these periods is unassailable. It was in such a setting, in the Late Postclassic, that the Aztec state rose to power and brought about the third and final horizonal unification of the area. The Aztecs, or Tenochcas, of Tenochtitlan were one of several competing tribes or small city states in the Valley of Mexico in the fourteenth century (see Vaillant 1941). In A.D. 1428, under their ruler Itzcoatl, the Aztecs defeated the rival city of Atzcapotzalco and became the dominant power in the valley (Nicholson 1978). Thereafter, they moved swiftly to increase and consolidate a warlike state. They did this by a series of conquests, by economic penetration of other territories through their Pochteca merchant system (Chapman 1957), and even by the shifting of conquered populations across old tribal and linguistic borders. To be sure, their control varied from region to region, being harder and tighter in some places than in others. This variation, however, seems to have depended largely upon what terms they could effectively enforce upon a conquered city or nation. In 1519, when Cortez entered central Mexico, their state or empire was at its zenith, and it still was expanding. They held under their governance a large swath across the south-central part of what is now Mexico, extending from coast to coast. Beyond this, they were known and feared, and their commercial influence was felt, south into the Maya region and north to the frontiers of Mesoamerica. We know about Aztec horizonal integration from both Conquest period historical sources as well as from archaeological remains-including such things as the fortresses and the regional adminis- trative centers that the Aztecs built throughout their empire (see Nicholson 1978; Weaver 1981: 422-460). Aztec religion was clearly a potent force in their imperial policy, and we see some signs of it as horizon indicators. Aztec deity representations-the Huitzilopochtli and Quetzalcoatl fig- ures-and the Aztec twin-temple constructions are examples; however, Aztec art, as represented in sculpture and ceramics, is not widely nor heavily distributed throughout Mesoamerica, or even within that part of Mesoamerica we know from historical sources to have been within the confines of the Aztec empire. This may reflect the brevity of Aztec imperial dominance-a period of less than 100 years - more than any restraint on the part of the conquerors. Certainly the historic accounts tell us, that the Aztec rulers, like most imperial rulers, were most desirous of "homogenizing" and stabilizing the empire. Perhaps with another century or so of rule and success, the Aztecs would have left a greater stylistic impress upon Mesoamerica as a whole. PERU The Peruvian, or Peru-Bolivian, culture area consists of the Peruvian coast and highlands and a substantial portion of the adjoining Bolivian highlands (Willey 1971:78-177). As it happens, this was the archaeological area setting for the initial formulation of the "horizon-style" concept (Kroeber 1944; Willey 1945), and Chavin is the earliest horizon style for the area. At one time, some ar- chaeologists saw Chavin as marking the beginnings of complex society or civilization for the area (Bennett 1948; Tello 1942). Indeed, almost 30 years ago, I came up with such a formulation myself (Willey 1962). After all, the analogy with ideas about the role of the Olmec in Mesoamerica is obvious, and in its setting the Chavin style and culture could be conceived of as the "civilization- bearer" for Peru. Subsequent research, however, has shown that things are not that neat for either Mesoamerica or Peru. I already have pointed out that in Mesoamerica there is increasing evidence for the rise of complex society in some regions prior to the Olmec horizon; for Peru, evidence to this effect is now overwhelming. On the coast of Peru there was a considerable degree of sedentism even as early as 4000 B.C. (Lumbreras 1969; Willey 1971), apparently linked to its marine subsistence practices. In the late preceramic, ca. 2200 B.C., the first public buildings appear on the coast (Engel 1966), and such constructions also occur at some places in the highlands, where they are linked to an early agricultural economy (Izumi and Sono 1963). Then, after the advent of farming on the</page><page sequence="7">Willey] HORIZONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY 203 coast, in the long, early ceramic, Initial period (1800-1200/800 B.C.), a number of absolutely mammoth public buildings or ceremonial mound constructions were put up in the coastal valleys (Patterson 1988). As examples, La Florida and Sechin Alto are two of the biggest of these, both larger than anything built in the later Peruvian periods. It is in this setting and context, of a 1,000- year-old tradition of complex social orders that Chavin art first appears. The dating of these first appearances of the Chavin style is debatable. At the great type site of Chavin de Huantar (Lumbreras 1971), in the north highlands of Peru, its inception purports to be in the range of 900-800 B.C.; however, there are Chavin manifestations on the north coast of Peru, including some of a monumental scale, that are thought to date as early as 1200 B.C. (Conrad 1982). Whatever the beginning date, there is general agreement that the Chavin Horizon lasts until ca. 200 B.C. (Lanning 1967:Table 2; Lumbreras 1969:28; Rowe 1960; Willey 1971:Figures 3-7, 3-8). Chavin Horizon art is best known from the northern part of the Peruvian area, both highland and coastal. Thus, it seems likely that Chavin as a coherent style is northern in its origins-whether highland or coastal. But saying this is not to deny that many of the elements that are incorporated into Chavin art-such as the various animals that are depicted-are at home in the natural envi- ronment of the tropical-forest zone to the east of the Andes so that, as Tello (1923, 1942) often pointed out, an ancient Amazonian lowland inspiration for the style cannot be discounted (Lathrap 1971). The principal themes of Chavin art are humans, demonized or animalistic humans, felines, raptorial birds, and caimans. These all tend to be rendered in a highly stylized manner, with transpositions of elements of one animal or being, such as teeth and claws, onto the body of another. Like Olmec, Chavin art is highly idiosyncratic and is readily recognizable (Willey 195 lb). It is found monumentally on stelae, though it is more common as relief decoration on temple structures of either stone or adobe. Craft objects in stone, bone, and even goldwork were ornamented in the style. Chavin, or Chavinoid, pottery is usually a dark-fired ware, frequently polished, and decorated in incision or in other plastic techniques. A stirrup-mouthed jar or bottle is one of the best-known Chavin Horizon vessel forms. As in the preceding Initial period, Chavin Horizon settlements were numerous, and individual valley or regional ceremonial centers were a part of the pattern (Willey 1953). Irrigation on the coast and terraced agriculture in the highlands were the primary bases of life. The Chavin era was not altogether a peaceful one as we have evidence for fortified constructions in some of the coastal valleys (Wilson 1988); however, there are no certain indications of multivalley conquest states developing at this time. The trade and exchange of goods over long distances is well established for the period of the horizon as it is for the preceding Initial period. The widespread presence of the powerful Chavin art style-as in the case of Olmec art in Mesoamerica-suggests the sharing of a common ideology, the ecumenical recognition of certain values and their symbols over much of the area (Patterson 1971). The Early Intermediate period (200 B.C.-A.D. 550), following on the Chavin Horizon, was a time of intense and brilliant regional diversity in the Peru-Bolivian area. Its earlier styles include the various white-on-red painted ceramics of the north (Larco Hoyle 1944) and central coasts (Willey 1943) and the north highlands (Bennett 1944), the succeeding negative-painted or resist-dye-dec- orated wares (Strong and Evans 1952), and the polychrome ceramics of the south highlands (Kidder 1943) and south coast (Kroeber 1953). These styles gave rise to, or were succeeded by, the better- known regional styles of the latter part of the period, especially the naturalistically life-modeled Moche (Benson 1972; Larco Hoyle 1938-1940) wares of the North Coast and the handsome stylized polychromes of Nazca (Gayton and Kroeber 1927) and Classic Tiahuanaco (Bennett 1934). While some of these styles show residues of old Chavin Horizon art, these residual elements have been reworked thoroughly to conform to the canons of the new regional styles. In addition to these developments in ceramics, this was also a time of craft innovations, especially in metallurgy (Bennett and Bird 1964:188-191), with the first appearances of gold-copper alloying, casting, and gilding. Metals most frequently were used in the manufacture of jewelry and ritual objects, though in the Moche culture they were employed occasionally in weaponry. The area's finest textiles (O'Neale 1937) also belong to the period, with the most spectacular products being produced on the south</page><page sequence="8">204 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 56, No. 2, 1991 coast. The major architectural achievements were still the construction of large adobe pyramids, for the coast, or stone temples, for the highlands; but now, however, more time and energy appear to have been put into the construction of dwelling sites than formerly. Population increased over Chavin Horizon times, and on the coast canal irrigation for agriculture probably reached its max- imum extent (Willey 1953). Some of the aforementioned great ceramic styles defined what were probably sizable regional states or kingdoms. Thus, the Moche state on the north coast appears to have incorporated several coastal valleys, and the nature of that state is attested to by the scenes of warfare and the treatment of prisoners as depicted in Moche art and iconography. These themes of war and conquest also are echoed in the numerous valley fortifications (Willey 1953; Wilson 1988). This period of regional diversity was brought to an end in the sixth century A.D. by the expansion and spread of the Tiahuanaco, or Tiahuanaco-Huari, horizon style. The origins of the style are certainly highland, and had their roots in the Classic Tiahuanaco culture of the Lake Titicaca region. The dominant icon of the style depicts what has been designated as the "staff-god"-a frontally facing anthropomorphic figure holding staffs, spears, or a spear-thrower. Frequently, the face of this anthropomorphic being is framed with radiating sunrays, often represented as serpents. Another motif is a running, winged demon or deity, shown in profile. Both motifs are carved on the monolithic stone Gateway of the Sun at the site of Tiahuanaco, and because of this it was assumed for a long time that Tiahuanaco had been the source of the Tiahuanaco Horizon. This, perhaps, is true in one sense for the art style does appear to have had its origins there; however, it now seems certain that another major site, the great urban center of Huari, several hundred kilometers to the north of Tiahuanaco, in the central Peruvian Highlands, was the place responsible for the widespread prop- agation of the style throughout the Peruvian area (see Menzel [1964] for a background statement on all of this). This propagation took place between ca. A.D. 550 and 1000, and it can be divided into four subphases. During the first two subphases, the diffused Tiahuanaco-Huari art and its motifs, oc- curring as ceramic and textile design, as well as in other media, is strong and stark in the recipient cultures. This and the fact that at this time there are also evidences of a marked disjuncture in architecture and settlement patterns suggest that the Tiahuanaco-Huari Horizon was propelled by the force of conquest and political incorporation. During the later two subphases, Tiahuanaco- Huari art becomes more blended with, or assimilated into, old local regional stylistic traditions that begin to reassert themselves (Stumer 1956; Willey 1971:157-164). While the political meanings of these changes is not altogether clear, a gradual restoration of local traditions after the shock of the imposition of alien traditions certainly is implied. At its height, the Tiahuanaco-Huari horizonal integration extended over much of the Peruvian coast and highlands. On the coast, it would appear that the Huari impact was earliest and strongest in the south, but it is also very well represented on the central coast, as at Pachacamac, or on the north coast where it is notably manifested at the Moche site proper (Uhle 1913). North of the Moche Valley it is weak or dim, with its furthest northern coastal limit in the Lambayeque Valley where, quite possibly, the old Moche kingdom had its last capital at Pampa Grande (Bawden 1983). In the highlands, the Tiahuanaco-Huari style became dominant in both the south and central regions, although quite probably it should be divided here between a Tiahuanaco focus, that influenced the south, and a Huari focus that prevailed in the central and northern regions (Isbell 1983; Menzel 1964). But combined, the overall Tiahuanaco-Huari distribution was substantially greater than that of the preceding Chavin Horizon. I have said that it seems highly probable that the Tiahuanaco-Huari horizonal integration was effected by imperial means, perhaps by centralized states governed, respectively from Tiahuanaco and Huari; but, if so, these "empires" were strongly commercial, as well as political, domains. The nature of this "commerce" remains somewhat speculative. Quite possibly trade preceded conquest, with a distributional economy like that of the later Inca empire coming into being, especially with the political successes of the Huari state (Isbell and Schreiber 1978; Schreiber 1987). It is likely that there were degrees of dominance or incorporation within that state. The evidence for imperial amalgamation is much better, for instance, in the central highlands, or in the immediate region of</page><page sequence="9">Willey] HORIZONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY 205 the Huari site, than it is farther afield; but whatever the political nature of the Tiahuanaco-Huari Horizon, there can be little doubt that there were profound changes in the old regional civilizations during this period. These were probably religious and ideological, as suggested by the ubiquitous appearances of the "staff-god" motif and its associated iconography, but the radical changes in architecture and settlement patterns also imply social, political, and economic changes (Bawden 1983; Isbell 1971, 1977). Indeed, the forms and patterns laid down during the Tiahuanaco-Huari horizon set the channels for architecture and settlement from this time forward to the end of the Precolumbian era in Peru. I already have indicated that in the latter two subphases of the Tiahuanaco-Huari Horizon old regional cultural traditions began to reassert themselves. For example, on the north coast, the great emphasis on realistic life-form modeling that had characterized the preceding Moche culture begins to come back. Similarly, on the south coast, the polychrome tradition, which had flourished so spectacularly in Nazca ceramics, emerged in the early Ica styles. These, and other transitional styles and cultures were the forerunners of what Peruvian archaeologists designate as the Late Intermediate period (see Willey 1971:164-172), a span of time from A.D. 1000 to ca. 1475, and, once more, a period of regional diversity. Several important kingdoms are defined for this Late Intermediate period. Most of these were territorially larger than the earlier regional, or Early Intermediate period, kingdoms. Thus, the Chimu state is reported, in legendary ethnohistorical sources, to have extended all along the coast from La Chira in the north to the Supe Valley in the south, limits considerably larger than that of the old Moche state (Moseley and Day 1982; Rowe 1948); and the distribution of the readily recognizable Chimu modeled blackware pottery seems to confirm this. On the central coast there may have been two or three sizable states, with the Chancay (Kroeber 1926; Lothrop and Mahler 1957) and Huancho (Lanning 1967:141-156) pottery complexes pertaining to at least two of these. And on the south coast there were probably two kingdoms, the Chincha (Kroeber and Strong 1924a; Menzel 1966) and the Ica (Kroeber and Strong 1924b; Lyon 1966), both defined by distinctive ceramic styles. The late kingdoms of the highlands include the Cajamarca (Reichlen and Reichlen 1949), Killke (Rowe 1944), Collao (Tschopik 1946), and Wancani (Lanning 1967; Ryden 1947). The latter was the successor of the old Tiahuanaco culture around Lake Titicaca while the Killke kingdom, in the vicinity of Cuzco, was the relatively small political domain of the Inca in the centuries immediately before the burgeoning of their empire. Craft goods were produced in enormous quantities during this late regional or Late Intermediate period. Indeed, there is a mass-produced quality to many of them, as in the abundant mold-made Chimu blackwares or in the great volume of textiles that are found archaeologically in all of these late cultures along the rainless Peruvian coast. Bronze began to make an appearance in these centuries. This was a tin-bronze that had its beginnings in the Bolivian highlands and in nearby Argentina and Chile. Some of it was used in ornaments, along with gold, gold-copper alloys, and silver, but it also was beginning to be employed in the making of tools and weapons (see Lechtman 1979). This last period of regional diversity was brought to an end by the Inca state and empire, for which a round date beginning of A.D. 1475 for the horizon marks the substantial success and spread of Inca imperial power. Beginning in A.D. 1438, the Killke-Inca, then one of several small, warring states in the south highlands, launched on a series of successful local conquests. These successes soon were followed by others farther afield, with an extension of Inca power down to the coast. By the 1470s they had conquered and incorporated the Chimu kingdom of the north coast. From here they pressed on north into much of Ecuador, and to the south they extended their holdings well into Chile and Argentina. When Pizarro entered Peru in A.D. 1532, the empire, although suffering from strains of rebellion and civil war, ran for over 3,000 kilometers down the spine of the Andes and the adjacent Pacific coast. It was clearly the greatest native American state and, indeed, one of the largest preindustrial empires in the world. From ethnohistoric accounts we know of its amazing centralized political organization and how it was formed and held together by force and by various imperial strategies ranging from a state warehousing and distribution system of goods to the shifting of whole populations from one section of the empire to another (Rowe 1946). Viewed as an archaeological horizon style, however, the Inca impress is something less than that</page><page sequence="10">206 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 56, No. 2, 1991 of the earlier Tiahuanaco-Huari Horizon. In the ceramic and textile arts it did not inundate, submerge, or obliterate local regional styles as did Tiahuanaco-Huari art (Willey 1948). In fact, there are places which we know, from historical records, to have been a part of the Inca empire, but which have very little or virtually no Inca pottery on or in their archaeological sites. Classic Inca polychromes-the famed aryballoid jars-were, of course, widely distributed in the empire (Bennett and Bird 1964), and there are certain sites and locations in which such pottery is abundant. Often, these appear to have been Inca-established provincial capitals or strongpoints. In some regions old local stylistic traditions were blended with those of the Inca to produce new types and forms, as, for instance, in the conquered Chimu territory. One effect of the Inca Horizon was to speed up and extend the diffusion of bronze. Tin-bronze now replaced earlier local arsenical bronzes throughout the empire (Lechtman 1981, 1988). Inca architectural styles and ideas also diffused. One thinks of the Mamacona structures at the coastal site of Pachcamac or the great fortress of Tomebamba (Uhle 1923) in the Ecuadorian highlands; however, the Inca also appear to have taken over and rebuilt many local fortifications and strong- points and in so doing to have continued along in the traditions of local architecture. MESOAMERICA AND PERU: A COMPARATIVE LOOK Let us now take a quick comparative look at the horizonal integrations and the periods of regionalism in our two areas. Beginning with the earliest horizons-and for whatever it may be worth in telling us something about the rise of complex civilization in Precolumbian America-we note that Olmec and Chavin occur at approximately the same absolute time (ca. 1200/900-400 B.C. for Olmec, and ca. 1200/800-200 B.C., for Chavin); but this chronological symmetry is not matched by what is probably the more important difference in the developmental stage contexts of their occurrences. In these, we see that Olmec art and the Olmec Horizon appear to be almost synchronous with, or only slightly later than, the first big public building and the beginnings of complex society in Mesoamerica; in contrast, Chavin art and the Chavin Horizon had been preceded in Peru by 1,000 years or more of large public structures and inferred social complexity. When I wrote about Olmec and Chavin back in 1962 I did not know this (Willey 1962). Peruvian Late Preceramic and Initial period large mound constructions had not yet been so identified. I think there is a real difference here in the ways in which mesoamerican and Peruvian cultures developed. It is a fascinating difference, and we do not know the whole significance of it yet, but it is a circumstance that deserves further investigation as we pursue research in the two areas. In spite of these differences in timing and context, I still would hold that the Olmec and Chavin horizons mark the first great ideological integrations of their respective areas. In saying this, I do not mean to imply that ideology was the only interregional integrating force operating in the mesoamerican and Peruvian areas at that time. Interregional trade and exchange in raw materials and manufactured goods were surely motivating factors that also promoted interregional communication and integration. Nev- ertheless, the nature of the Olmec and Chavin styles-idiosyncratic, heavily charged with symbolism, highly compelling, and readily recognizable-give high plausibility to ideology, to the promulgation of a common cosmic view of life and the world, as being the primary motivating force in both of these horizonal integrations. The periods of regional diversity following Olmec in Mesoamerica and Chavin in Peru are, again, approximately synchronous (from 400 B.C. to A.D. 450 in Mesoamerica and from 200 B.C. to A.D. 550 for Peru); and the two periods are similar in their development. In both areas, it was the time of the most brilliant art styles, especially as these were expressed in ceramics, textiles, and other crafts. Standards of aesthetic excellence were achieved that were not to be duplicated again in the Precolumbian era in either area. These periods of regional diversity were the times when an elite class, in each area, was consolidating its powers in a system of competing regional states and kingdoms. Such an elite class had come into being, of course, some time before this. Now it was beginning to be especially concerned with the validations for its existence and its right to rule, as well as with the organization of the forces to exercise that rule.</page><page sequence="11">Willey] HORIZONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY 207 The second horizonal integrations, those of Teotihuacan (A.D. 450-650) and Tiahuanaco-Huari (A.D. 550-1000), are, as was the case for Olmec and Chavin, characterized by their distinctive art styles, but both horizons also are defined by other traits and qualities. These include architectural innovations and the dissemination of these among the various regions, and this may be testimony of the spread of political power and authority. But I am inclined to think that the strong economic and commercial linkages that were forged during the two horizons were probably even more im- portant than the political ones. I think this was certainly the case for Teotihuacan and Mesoamerica. It probably also is true for the Huari Horizon of Peru, though by this time it may be that the Peruvians had moved farther along the road of imperial politics than their mesoamerican contem- poraries. Additional matters of interest concerning the two second horizons relate to their geographical and chronological dimensions. The geographical extent of both is substantially greater than that of first horizons in their respective areas. Thus, Teotihuacan horizonal influences cover virtually all of the mesoamerican culture area, in contrast to a territory only half that size for the preceding Olmec Horizon; and the distribution of Tiahuanaco-Huari influences in Peru is substantially greater than the spread of Chavin influences. As to chronology, the time durations of the Teotihuacan and Tiahuanaco-Huari horizons are considerably shorter than those of Olmec and Chavin. Comparing the lengths of the Teotihuacan and Tiahauanco-Huari time spans with each other, the duration of the Teotihuacan Horizon is set at 200 years while that of Tiahuanaco-Huari is 400 years. In spite of the approximate nature of such estimates in treating archaeological data, this difference might just be significant. It may reflect an earlier and stronger tendency in Peruvian cultures and societies to submit to uniformity, and a lesser urge to break out of the bonds of horizonal homogeneity, than was the case for Mesoamerica. One wonders if this might not foreshadow the later Inca success in maintaining such an impressive monolithic control over their wide domains. In the second period of mesoamerican regional diversity (A.D. 650-1425), Teotihuacan horizonal influences fade away or become no more than residues in new regional styles. During this second period in Peru (A.D. 1000-1475), there is a very definite reassertion of old regional artistic traditions, albeit in a series of new and distinct styles. In both areas, the cultures and political entities of this second period of regional diversity tend to be territorially larger than those of the earlier regional cultures. In both areas, also, I think it is fair to say that the quality of aesthetic excellence in art products is somewhat less than in the earlier regional period. However, in both areas, it was a time of technological innovation: the spread of a tin-bronze weapon and tool technology in Peru and the introduction and development of a simpler metallurgy in Mesoamerica. The third and final horizonal integration for the two areas was, in both cases, relatively brief: from A.D. 1425 to 1520 for the Aztecs and from A.D. 1438/1475 to 1532 for the Incas, or an approximate century for each. In neither case was there as definite a set of central artistic or iconographic themes for the horizon as there had been for the earlier horizons in their respective areas. This is notably so for Peru where no dominant artistic motif, or set of motifs, stands for the Inca Horizon in the way that the feline-saurian motifs had represented Chavin or the "staff-god," in its various forms, had represented Tiahuanaco-Huari. The most widespread feature of the Inca Horizon style is the polychrome aryballoid jar with its relatively simple geometric or naturalistic design elements. In Mesoamerica, Aztec deity representations of Huitzilopochtli or Coatlicue are, to be sure, highly idiosyncratic and distinctive, but their horizonal distribution is relatively limited. The Inca horizonal integration extended much further geographically than had that of Chavin or Tiahuanaco-Huari, covering the entire Peruvian, or Peru-Bolivian, culture area and going well beyond this into Ecuador to the north and Chile and Argentina to the south. The Aztec Horizon was more limited geographically than the earlier Teotihuacan Horizon, covering, perhaps, less than a third of the mesoamerican culture area; however, Aztec influence is seen sporadically in the archaeological record well beyond this. Finally, if we characterize the predominant driving force behind the Olmec and Chavin horizons as ideological, and that behind the Teotihuacan and Tiahuanaco-Huari horizons as commercial, there seems little doubt that the spread of the Aztec and the Inca horizons was fueled, in each case,</page><page sequence="12">208 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [Vol. 56, No. 2,1991 by political and military power. And in each case this true and full-scale imperialism produced a harder and more all-encompassing horizonal integration than the regional societies of the two areas had yet experienced. THE INTERMEDIATE AREA: A CONTROL CASE If the alternation of horizonal integrations with periods of regional diversity is a process leading to high civilizational complexity, as I have stated at the beginning of this essay and have attempted to describe for Mesoamerica and Peru, we might ask if there are instances in the Precolumbian American record where the lack of such an alternating process may have precluded such civilizational complexity? In attempting to answer this question, my attention is drawn first to that territory that lies between Mesoamerica and Peru that some of us have called, because of this geographically intermediate position, the "Intermediate area" (Willey 1971:254-359). In more conventional terms it consists of lower Central America and the highlands and coasts of Colombia and Ecuador. In general, this is an area of an impressive Precolumbian cultural profile, second in the Americas, I should say, only to Mesoamerica and Peru. Like these two areas, the Intermediate area is one of impressive natural environment diversity. Like them, there are a variety of coastal and upland- valley living zones, with tropical climates variably moderated by differing altitudes. Unlike either Mesoamerica or Peru, however, the Intermediate area cannot be described or defined as a cohesive archaeological culture area. That is, it would be very difficult to define an "Intermediate area co- tradition" in the way that Bennett (1948) once did this for Peru or Kirchhoff (1943) for Mesoamerica. Instead, the Intermediate area presents extraordinary and persistent regional diversity in its ar- chaeological styles. It is a diversity unrelieved by anything like the horizon-style unifications we have described for Mesoamerica and Peru. In making these comparisons, it should be emphasized that the Intermediate area did not lag behind Mesoamerica and Peru in the development of a New World Formative base. To the contrary, ceramic beginnings in the Intermediate area go back to 3500-4000 B.C. (Bischof and Viteri 1972; Bray 1984; Cooke 1984; Marcos 1980; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965, 1980) or much earlier than in Mesoamerica and Peru. In addition, sedentary life based on agriculture is also as old, or older, in the Intermediate area, than it is in the other two areas (Lathrap 1975). Indeed, it might be said that as of third century B.C. the Ecuadorians, the Colombians, and even the Panamanians (Cooke 1984) were ahead of the Peruvians and mesoamericans in their development of a sedentary agricultural way of life that would provide the platform for later developments of more complex societies. Even beyond that, and going upwards on the scale of developmental thresholds, we can cite evidence of small public buildings and ceremonial centers in Ecuador, bespeaking the beginnings of complex society there, as early as 2200 B.C. (Lathrap 1975), or as early as in Peru and earlier than in Mesoamerica. That is, the relations of the Intermediate area to Mesoamerica or Peru were not the peripheral ones that the southwestern United States had with Mesoamerica or the south andean area had with Peru, relations in which the Formative foundations of civilization are appreciably later than in the core areas. To the contrary, the Intermediate area was a part of the "core," indeed perhaps the earliest part of that New World core. But in spite of this, regional diversity was never transcended in the Intermediate area by horizonal integrations. The regional diversity of the Intermediate area is represented by a great many sophisticated art styles (see Linares de Sapir 1977; Meggers 1966; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1965) expressed especially in pottery and goldwork, but occasionally in stone sculptures. The regional archaeological cultures of Ecuadorian Guangala and Mantefio, Colombian San Agustin and Chibcha, Panamanian Cocle, or Costa Rican-Nicaraguan Nicoya would be a few of the examples. But none of these regional styles ever expanded, or "exploded," into a horizon style that then linked together the whole of the Intermediate area or even any very large part of that area. Thus, I rest my control case. There is no evidence for horizonal integration in the Intermediate area, at least prior to the advent of Inca imperial power, a force that was not generated there but came in from the outside. As a corollary of this, the cultures and societies of the area did not attain to that level of civilizational complexity that characterizes Mesoamerica and Peru. Instead, the</page><page sequence="13">Willey] HORIZONAL INTEGRATION AND REGIONAL DIVERSITY 209 Intermediate area cultures remained regionally distinct one from another. As they came up into the sixteenth century, they were the small chiefly domains that the Spaniards encountered on their arrival in that part of the New World. Frequently rich, and the seats of locally powerful but petty overlords, they appear never to have been drawn together-ideologically, economically, and polit- ically- in the way that the cultures and societies of Mesoamerica and Peru were so drawn together by their respective horizon styles. CONCLUDING COMMENTS If I am correct in my hypothesis, that an alternation between horizonal integration and regional diversification is a potent, or even necessary, process in the rise of civilization, how does the process actually work? What are the mechanisms of the diffusion and acceptance of ideas and goods from one society and region to another during the course of what I have called a horizonal integration? Or, conversely, in what ways does a return to regionalism promote growth and change? And how do ideology, economics, and social and political organization interact upon one another during these changeovers between interregional and intraregional emphases? Obviously, we need to know a lot more about culture change and growth before we can answer these questions, and I have no doubt that when we learn more it will be in situationally specific contexts where we can take a closer look at what has gone on and where we can define models of growth and change and test them-rather than through the kinds of speculative generalizations I am offering now. In spite of this, speculation has its place, and I will continue in that vein, in these brief concluding remarks. First, let me try to disarm you by pointing out that the horizonal integration-regional diversity frame of reference is really a very simple and homespun idea. It is not imbued with anything as mystical as the youth-maturity-and-death cycle that Spengler (1932) saw as organically inherent in all civilizations, nor is it even as arcane as Toynbee's (1961) challenge-and-response mechanism for cultural growth. I am simply saying that human societies and cultures change and evolve more rapidly toward that complexity we call civilization under conditions in which periods of intensive regional interaction alternate more or less regularly with periods of lesser interaction. The horizonal interaction part of my formulation should be readily acceptable to most anthro- pologically trained American archaeologists; indeed, under the different name of "interaction sphere," something like it has been introduced into eastern North America (Caldwell 1965). A more-pres- tigious parallel from world culture history and economics would be Wallerstein's (1974, 1980; see also Kohl 1989) "world systems" concept. While I realize that the world systems of industrial states do not replicate ancient mesoamerican or Peruvian horizonal integration systems, both share that potential for growth and complexity that make the interconnected whole as something greater than the sum of its parts. In a word, very important forces in culture change appear to be generated and released through integrative networks. What of the other half of the horizonal-regional formulation? How does regionalism, or an alternating return to regionalism after each horizonal integration, also contribute to cultural growth and complexity? The processes operative in this seem less obvious then for the horizons, but perhaps we can begin to identify some of them. Could not horizonal homogeneity, when maintained for too long under the same forces of control, become perceived as oppresive and stultifying? I should think that it could, and that under such conditions there might be a tendency for people to return to old and smaller sociopolitical divisions, to old local roots and traditions. After all, in the modern world scene around us today such a decentralizing or "regionalizing," process is not unknown. Perhaps it is only by such a return that the creativeness of the system as a whole can be recharged by the new ideas that will power the next horizonal integration. REFERENCES CITED Adams, R. E.
