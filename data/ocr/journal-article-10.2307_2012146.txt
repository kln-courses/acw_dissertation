<plain_text><page sequence="1">90 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY THE INTERPRETATION OF A SYSTEM FROM THE POINT OF VIEW OF DEVELOPMENTAL PSYCHOLOGY W E may assume two attitudes towards the works of men; we may interpret them, or, going a step farther, estimate them according to our own or the artist's ideal. The one is the function of the historian, the other the function of the critic who is to edu- cate men to do better next time. You interpret the Zeus of Phidias, Dante's Divine Comedy, or Wagner's Parsifal. You apply your criticisms to works that pretend to contribute to modern progress, as, for instance, a play by Maeterlinck, a new cure, or a new system of philosophy. Sometimes, however, the very latest systems defy the critic; he may adjudge them stillborn because they do not conform to his standard: nevertheless they will prove very much alive. Buechner's 'Force and Matter' was in its time the gospel of many thousands. Haeckel's 'Riddle of the Universe' was not swept into oblivion by a flood of most expert criticism. Of these two I was vividly re- minded by Mr. Franklin's 'Socialization of Humanity.' All three are the work of amateurs in philosophy, and have been or are still satisfying the demands of a large class of people for a systematic arrangement of experience. The most profitable thing, then, seems to be an attempt at interpretation. The more so because the works of the amateur in their unguarded boldness of reasoning offer splendid opportunities for trapping and snap-shooting the philoso- phizing mind when it transforms by secret processes the raw ma- terial of experience into the finished product of a system of meta- physics. Now if science is first of all an ever-increasing minuteness of description by differentiation, if it is this to-day from the point of view of evolution, history of philosophy will not fulfill this modern requirement unless it describes philosophizing man in his evolu- tionary stages. The amateur philosopher, then, if I may use the terms of anthropogeny, represents the still extant, though yet un- appreciated, link between the expert of to-day, on the one side, and the layman who has ever reasoned and is still reasoning from anal- ogy to systems of anthropomorphic imagery, on the other. The amateur employs the abstract language of the former, but, neither grasping the difficulty of his problems nor familiar with the extent of their solution, reveals by the recklessness of his reasoning the 1 The Socialization of Humanity.'

Mr. Frank- lin appears to be an amateur in philosophy. Let us see whether he lays bare some of the hidden ways of the philosophizing mind. He says (187) the popular view of our situation was correctly stated by a laboring man when the author was a child of seven; he still remembers the striking words: "It is live hard, work hard, die hard, and go to hell at last!" He himself seems still to hold a similar view; our every-day life with its struggle for existence, its panics, its poverty, its insecurity, its wars, is in his opinion little better than savagery (186). The church is said to be the cause of all this misery; her theological conception of the universe prevents man from improving this earthly life. The bits of description strewn over more than four hundred pages, and some information received in answer to my questionnaire concerning the natural history of the thinker, make me infer that the church here denotes the conception and political organization of Christianity against which Voltaire declaimed his ' Ecrasez l'infame,' against which the German Social Democracy thundered her ban up to the year 1885, and which the materialist thinkers and politically interested scientists of Europe about 1860 feared and hated as the staunch supporter of all reaction- ary policies. Witness, as the last survivals of that metaphysical mood, Haeckel in his earlier philosophical writings, Renan in the preface to his 'Souvenirs' and still to-day Bertholet in his last vol- ume on 'Science et Libre Pensee.' Whence, however, so much bitter- ness and misjudgment in our author, especially here in America, which has never known the political contrast between a conservative majority within the state church and the followers of liberalism? When Franklin was about thirteen, one day coming home from work with an elder companion, he denied the existence of God because he could not reconcile the evil he saw in nature and society with the idea of an all-powerful God; and still to-day he thinks the argument from injustice most convincing and indisputable.2 To mention a greater name, J. S. Mill thought so too, and never ceased to think so even when in later life he had to accept an evil and a good God. As regards our philosopher, two causes seem to have contributed to making permanent the sway of this argument. The first is his being struck by life's misery too hard in his boyhood days. When still an immature boy of eleven he was forced to quit school and earn a living. Any drudgery will be painful to a boy of that age and interfere with his smooth development from the self-centered boy to the society-centered adolescent. The boy has social instinct 2 Chap. XVI., 'The God and Immortality Hypothesis.'</page><page sequence="3">92 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY enough to respect the group of boys to which he belongs. The only demand he makes upon that group is the demand for a square deal; justice or, better, equality is the supreme law of his life. Any com- munity, small or large, be it even God's, in which a boy must work more than he is able or in which man suffers without good reason, appears to the boy as an unjust organization. However deeply religious the child may have been, the boy rebels against an unjust God like the primitive man who punishes his idols for neglect or misdemeanor; the more so because for the first time conscious of his power to handle a few abstract terms, he judges all things, merci- lessly applying the Procrustean bed of his narrow system of thought. The second cause is a low degree of the teleological vision in the adolescence of our philosopher. When at seventeen be became 'thoughtful about life, what it meant and what his duty was,' he was forced during a Methodist revival to surrender his scepticism and for a time acknowledge the truth of orthodox Christianity. He, however, commenced at once to study the Bible, and the more he studied it the less he believed in it, without having yet looked into the writings of men like Conybear, M. J. Savage, W. H. Mallock and Tom Paine. If I may state in a few words what other indi- vidual analyses shall bring out more fully, this continued critical attitude of the adolescent philosopher means to me that the five features of the teleological vision-the emotion of optimism, the emotion of the unity of the universe, the emotion of one's humble place in a purposeful universe, the communistic emotion of love, and the communistic volition of equality and sacrifice-were not so intensely experienced in his 'first conversion' as to undo his boyhood reasoning by opening a view into a vaster and more purposeful uni- verse than the boy had ever known. The several individual pur- poses of this spiritual world may be hidden from our vision, but appear as firmly established as the whole mental experience which announces to the boy the advent of his adolescence. Thus Carlyle ('Sartor Resartus'), although for ten years rather believing in the Devil and a society subject to him and hostile to the struggling youth, finally, in his twenty-fourth year, had his 'conversion' or 'fire-baptism' on Leith walk and realized the larger spiritual world of the German idealists. Franklin himself seems to think that his having had no particular religious training determined the light transitory character of his first 'conversion.' Herbert Spencer rather felt the other way, that his mental make-up would never have responded to any religious training, however judiciously applied. Leaving aside Mill's case as one-sided over-feeding and artificial deformation of the mind, both may be right, representing different species of mental constitution, especially so because our author now,</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 93 in the maturity of his manhood, knows, like any true positivist, the ecstasies of religion. But whatever have been the causes, the boyhood reasoning from the analogy of tribal equality to man's place in the universe has been firmly fixed once for all. So the author's preachment on man as 'a being unfavored, unfriended by the Infinite' (4) still reveals a metaphysical mood that since his boyhood feels, as it were, the world to be split into two hostile camps. This mood manifesting itself from time to time in emotions of a dualistic view of life ap- pears to be an especially common, though transitory, disease of the adolescent, a disease which results from his struggle to adapt him- self to life under the new stimulus of his ideals. However, it may also become chronic or at least permanently affect the intellectual life of the mature man; it is then accompanied by, or evident in, a tendency to antithetical reasoning which leaves the affected indi- vidual unaware of the relativity of values and knowledge, and pre- vents him in many cases from conceiving impartial judgments. Witness Saint Paul and Augustine, or Tolstoy and Carlyle. Tolstoy was not able to adapt himself for any length of time to the life of the upper classes of Russian society, because it was not suited to his spiritual nature; therefore he began to hate and to reject not only that life, but also western civilization represented by it, as altogether immoral, and to love and to believe in the life of the peasant and its spiritual possibilities. Carlyle struggled for ten years with what he called the materialism and atheism of Edinburgh society; it did not satisfy his metaphysical and spiritual needs and, worst of all, it did not seem to have a place for him. When the final unification of his mind started in with reaching the 'Center of Indifference,' he had grown the antithetical thinker and moralizing critic which he remained to the end. An almost perfect record of such growth has been written by a master hand in 'Sartor Resartus,' especially in the 'Sorrows of Teufelsdr6kh' and the chapters following. A similar struggle seems to resound in page 246 of Mr. Franklin's book, where the author tells us that religion is the joy of man's life. When a youth he desires to do something for the betterment of the race, being by nature a reformer. He is intoxicated with his dream. But he attempts to do things and fails. His enthusiasm dies out, and at thirty all the dreams of his youth disappear and his ideals are dead. To venture a psychological interpretation, at thirty Mr. Franklin had completed the critical period of adolescence which, in his case, at first modified, later on destroyed, the metaphysical system taught to the child and the boy by his surroundings during the years of mental dependence. He must have been for years without faith in any satisfactory order of the universe. When at twenty-two the</page><page sequence="5">94 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY constructive period of his adolescence set in, overlapping the critical one, it took him yet at least eight years to conceive the central idea of his system around which his metaphysical thoughts might crystal- lize into unity. These eight years of his life without spiritual unity and support may easily have worn out the ideal will for a time. However, most people do not take up the work of their manhood without any faith. So it is only natural that, as I am told, the positive beliefs of his manhood came to our thinker between his thirtieth and his fortieth year. It must have been at thirty or shortly thereafter that he 'experienced the profoundest surprise' in learning God to be an allegory only for tribe or nation or humanity (249). With this equation he had conceived the central ideal of his system and his practical philosophy: humanity the final cause of the individual's life; this life to be socialized, that is, to be lived in complete devotion to humanity. This constructive reasoning of his thirties Franklin has called his third conversion-his second conversion had invaded conscious- ness at eighteen in the form of a moonlight illumination that told him he was then free from the orthodox conception of the fall of man, the atonement and hell. The happiness resulting from the third conversion is said to have been much more intense than that accompanying the first two. This statement agrees very well with the positive beliefs gained by the third which are so necessary to a healthy life; his manhood reasoning had then been completed in a way satisfactory to the individual. The method, however, employed in it still bears the marks of the antithetical effect upon his reasoning of the metaphysical struggle of his youth. He reasons thus: the hideousness of modern civiliza- tion with its poverty, its struggle for existence, its wars, is due to the inefficiency of Christianity (177). The religion of the church is chiefly superstition, fanaticism, bigotry, hypocrisy (333). Chris- tianity does not recognize that governments may do wrong (361). Society, owing to its traditional theology, makes no effort to remedy the social tragedies (367). The thought-stopping answers of the- ology have stultified man in his investigations (261). Religion is taken advantage of by designing individuals (127). Hypocrisy is the philosophy of the leaders of men to-day as it has been in all past ages in transitional periods, as from mythology to theology (144). The lace has ever been the victim of its great individuals, nobilities, priesthoods, professions (151). It is the avowed object of college training to hold persons in their childhood beliefs instead of making them original thinkers (183). Every revolutionizing genius and scientist has suffered as the martyr of his cause (168). And last, not least, Christianity does not fit the individual's acute intellect</page><page sequence="6">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 95 (338). In short, the Christian church stands for a theory of things which considers man to be a slave to an imaginary God and his vice- gerents and minions here on earth, and existence to be a fixed condi- tion of servitude, instead of a glorious career of development. It is either Rome or reason, as Cardinal Newman said (194). The author has chosen reason; for him science, the work of man's reason, has taken the place of our effete theology. Reason apparently denotes with Franklin something that will assist in realizing the ideals the youth dreamed of, the betterment of the race. Reason, highly appreciated in the matter-of-fact attitude of manhood, leads to a rational or scientific conception of the uni- verse and permits of conceiving a rational system of living (6). This scientific knowledge begins with matter and energy, and ends by describing all nature in their terms. While the scientist of to- day will be glad to reduce all knowledge to mathematical equations, Mr. Franklin seems to hold the fond hope of the eighteenth century that it will be possible to mechanize science; his enthusiasm, not sobered by either epistemology or even an amateur philosopher like Du-Bois-Reymond, carries him away to the assertion that even the ultimate secrets of the universe are within the limits of our investi- gation (7); life will not be a mystery but a science (256). Empedocles would have satisfied his demand for light on the process of knowing by his answer: yair .hv y%ap yaTav dtrCap.ev (we know the like by the like). Knowing meant to the Greek thinker (if I understand it at all) nothing less than to know as much of a thing as you may know of yourself by introspection; his way and his theory of knowing had not yet outgrown the anthropomorphizing attitude of primitive man. The same method of knowing is used by Mr. Franklin when he rises against the scientists who do not admit that the internal vibrations registered in the nervous system of animals are identical with the external vibrations of the environ- ment. From his point of view they must be identical or else we would have unlike knowing like for the first time in all nature (44). If the mind is not the residual representations of external energies so as to be identical with it, then it is inexplicable, then the universe is unknowable, then science is but a dream, and man the sorry dupe of his own nature. Such is not the case (46). He is certainly not a pragmatist; he is an enthusiastic rationalist; he will not submit to the relativity of human knowledge, but believes in our ability to arrive at absolute knowledge; and since he unknowingly reasons from the analogy of his own inner aspect to the life of the things about him, he insists on knowing the like by the like as the only method that satisfies 'his longings for absolute knowledge' (80). On the other hand, Mr. Franklin has given up in despair the</page><page sequence="7">96 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY task of forming a concept of a purposeful universe out of the ap- parent chaos and realizes that man is a being unfriended by the Infinite (4); his teleological vision lacking in intensity, he has re- signed himself to that knowledge that describes nature in terms of matter and energy. But since these external phenomena are silently understood to have an inner aspect according to the above principle of knowing the like by the like, the thinker may easily take mechan- ical energies to be identical with mind as their residua in the brain; nor is the inference to be wondered at that we shall finally know what we are and what everything else is in terms of our own being (256); then we shall also know what matter is because we know what emotions and ideas are (85); thus the gap between mind and matter is spanned, and the whence, whither and why of humanity deter- mined (129). The hidden anthropomorphism comes out more clearly in his chapter on 'Aspects of Scientific Morality,' where the various forms of the will are given as chemical affinity, appetite, desire, will, love, religion (348). Mr. Franklin illustrates his way of reasoning by referring to Bacon's 'Advancement of Learning.'3 However, we need not go back into the past. This anthropomorphic stage of scientific reasoning with its belief in absolute knowledge and its inability to perceive the outer as well as the inner aspect of this world as psychic realities may still be studied in life. Professor E. Haeckel, of Jena, regarded in 18924 all matter as endowed with feel- ing and the power of motion, and, as a true rationalist demanding an explanation of chemical affinity, accepted the Empedoclean sup- position that the molecules or atoms feel each other. To-day his hylonism, or hylozoism, is, according to 'The Wonders of Life,' meant to express 'the fact that all substance has two fundamental attributes; as matter it occupies space, and as force or energy it is endowed with sensation.' In the same way, Professor W. von Bechterev5 needs for his scientific reasoning a psyche (innere Verar- beitung ausserer Riickwirkungen) as the inner aspect of the most simple living beings, but he more cautiously arrests his anthropo- morphizing bent where the series of living substances ends. Neither do I think that Herbert Spencer in making the equation, ether consciousness, passed beyond this hylozoism; and Diogenes, of Apol- lonia, generalizing primitive thought, for instance, that of the ancient Hebrew, endowed all the air with an inner aspect. However, before we go on with the analysis of the philosopher in hand, we must state here in justice to him that quitting the common 3 Book IV., Chap. 3. 4 Monist, III., p. 234. 5 Journal fiir Psychologie u. Neurologie, V., p. 211.</page><page sequence="8">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 97 school when still a boy of eleven, he has not had the opportunity for, and guidance in, developing so rich a system of concepts as one who attends school until he enters upon a profession at about twenty-five. Thus there was a limited range of concepts and a limited capacity for receiving new ones at his disposal while he was constructing a vast metaphysical system. This limitation of intellectual content accounts for the fact that our rationalist is, on the one hand, so easily satisfied with anthropomorphic ways of reasoning, though determined on a rigorous mechanization of all science, and, on the other hand, manifests a certain unwillingness to stand the 'showers of scientific technicalities' and an inability to understand the in- tricacies of modern science. For instance, he thinks that the various definitions of society proposed by sociologists are due to a capricious desire to be original rather than to express the facts in the case (373). It is no wonder that at the age of eighteen he was at first not able to understand Mallock's 'Is Life Worth Living?' and that he read Comte's 'Positive Philosophy' in Martineau's abbreviation 'many times' since his twenty-second year before he understood his 'greatest philosopher.' With such mental make-up, holding fast to the true rationalist method that he had followed since his boyhood days, he looked out upon the universe. In the eyes of the anthropomorphizing thinker, the universe is a being the only business of which is to economically expend energy, and, like a householder or economist, he assumes the utilitarian attitude of mind, asking 'what for?' and 'to whose bene- fit ?' The answer is not favorable to that being, because the conception of an economical expenditure of energy does very well when applied to living beings that succeed best in preserving life by greatest economy along with the vigorous play of their biological functions, but can never be deduced from the life of a universe which as a whole is not accessible to scientific analysis. Nature is the most wasteful organ- ization (12). Its seemingly intelligent arrangement does not amount to much when we estimate all of the waste. If man had the power, he could make improvements in the solar system, arrange to better advantage the rainfall upon the earth and economize the sunlight. Man might plan such wonderful things because the energies of nature in their fortuitous combinations have resulted in a new world, the life of the individual controlled by the conscious or subconscious mind; the test for this mind is order resulting from an ever more economical expenditure of energy that goes to preserve the indi- vidual and the race (96). Thus, according to Mr. Franklin, pur- posive mind appears a stranger in a strange world which has no purpose. Only in a few places we may come across a larger vision that recalls Hegel (whom the author never felt inclined to study);</page><page sequence="9">98 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY for instance, where Franklin sums up the universal process by saying that the individual comprises within himself all of nature and all of society by being the object in which nature returns upon itself in self-consciousness (161). In general, however, and consistent with the whole system, the narrower vision prevails. A part of the universe has been sur- rendered as inaccessible to the purposive interpretation of the ideal will or teleological vision. The remainder is not, as one should infer from his biological test for mind consisting in economical expenditure of energy, the whole animate world, to which modern scientists, in contrast with eighteenth-century rationalism, feel inclined to extend the fellowship of kin; the remainder is humanity only, that part of the animate world which is capable of planning a greater perfection of its life and conceiving of the socialization of humanity as its final cause and chief concern. Since Mr. Franklin has learned to his joy that society is the author and perfecter of our being, he demands that all prayers, all songs, all praises, all service, be inspired by humanity and directed to humanity (270), 'in which we live and move and have our being.' Thus religion is the very climax of mental life, because it is the emotion of race-protection (95), because the most exquisite ecstasy possible to a human being comes from the performance of his social functions (155). Without religion no socialization! Only the supreme ecstasy of religion will overcome selfish individualism, the immediate cause of all social misery (251). Therefore one should make religion the basis in our system of education (105), so that no scholar may leave school without the vision of humanity. On this basis, the educator is to consciously and consistently build up his educational practice after the demands of biology and sociology. He should teach what nature is and how to live in it, what society is and how to adjust one's self to it; he should teach these subjects, even sociology, by the experimental methods (181). After this practical philosophy had been worked out, or at least conceived in its main features, Mr. Franklin seems to have felt the need of unifying his ideas about life into one homogeneous system, or, as he says, 'to interpret everything in the terms of some one thing.' When at the age of twenty-two he decided to construct his own system of philosophy it was with him a matter-of-course that he reject the conception of God as unsuited to guide to ultimate terms, because the inner aspect was, for lack of vision, not the pre- dominant factor of his experience. As we saw above, he accepted as suited for the purpose the terms of the space or outer aspect. He found it easier to arrive at an ultimate substance and an ultimate law than his master. Comte, too well informed to believe in the</page><page sequence="10">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 99 mechanization of science, yet gifted with too narrow a vision to look at ultimate questions from the psychical point of view-Comte in the 'Introduction' holds out no hope that he might be able to reduce the vast variety of experience as proceeding from a single principle and as subjected to a single law. Mr. Franklin then began, quite up to date, with energy as the ultimate concept, as if he were familiar with Ostwald's speculations on matter and followed him in not seeing the heterogeneity and reciprocity of matter and energy, that is, that neither term can do without the other nor take the place of the other. Energy, we are further told, manifests itself as gravitant and radiant. Gravitant energy produces the forms of matter, radiant energy the conditions of matter. The latter is 'expended' (1) by inanimate nature, (2) by the self-interested individual under the direction of the intellect (fourth law of motion), (3) by the same under the guidance of the emotional 'moral sense' (fifth law of motion), and (4) by the same according to the 'social sense' or scientific knowledge (sixth law of motion); each form more and more approaching the perfectly eco- nomical method of the last. Gravitant or internal energy manifests itself (1) in nature as chemical affinity, (2) as the instinct of self- preservation in the animate world, (3) as sexual love in man, and (4) as religion, holding men together in a social organization. From the fact that both kinds of energy behave everywhere and at all times in the same way, the author deduced and discovered, after seventeen years of thought, the law of external and internal repeti- tion as the ultimate law. It seems to mean that there are uniformi- ties of nature; nature follows up the same causes with the same effects: Mr. Franklin wants to have here subsumed Tarde's and Baldwin's laws of imitation. Only the varied combination of the two kinds of energy produce change, evolution and progress. So much for the general character and growth of this 'monistic system of philosophy,' which is as much a monism as Professor Haeckel's or any other hylozoism. If I were finally asked to give an opinion on the practical edu- cative value of the work that embodies the system, I should point out these three of its features. First, it is all through a passionate plea for the ever more thorough application of science to the functions of individual and social life: let us eat and drink scientifically, let us work and rest scientifically, let us engender offspring scientifically, let us organize society scientifically. What the author means may, in part, I think, be well illustrated by the exceedingly scientific con- duct of the Japanese commissariat and medical service during the late war. I wish, indeed, some academy of sciences would compile a moral code, something parallel to the civil code of the courts; a</page><page sequence="11">100 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY code which prescribes rules of conduct regarding the various func- tions of the individual and society; which could be revised at stated intervals like the official dictionary of the French Academy; a code which would infinitely assist the anxious inquirer to live a healthier, more useful and happier life and thus prevent many evils arising from the ignorance of those who are willing to do better. Second, the book forces upon us the conclusion that the very application of science to the problems of social life will contribute to tighten the social fabric in order to preserve and increase the life of the social body and the individuals composing it. Mr. Franklin is not a socialist of this or that brand; well, he is as much of a socialist as we all are who want to consciously and scientifically guide the evolution of society to forms of organization in which the individual reaches his highest development and is thereby enabled to serve society in the most efficient way. Mr. Franklin, though better appreciating the function of society than Herbert Spencer, is still at heart an Anglo-Saxon individualist, he is not kin to the German socialist, because with Franklin the socialization of humanity is not an end in itself, but a means to create conditions favorable to perfect the life of the individual. The German socialist represents a racial admixture to the Teuton stock which is not made for an individualistic society; his vision of the state is not so differentiated as to include the most intense individualization as a means of in- creasing the life of the body politic. And third, education ought to be more rigorously planned and practiced from the biological point of view of efficiency to preserve and increase life; and since skill is developed and efficiency attained by practice or experiment only, Mr. Franklin wants to have the laboratory methods extended even to the subject of sociology. I suppose he has in mind something like the 'school city' political organizations of high school pupils tried successfully in several larger cities of the east and middle west and resorted to already by the great educators and character-builders of eighteenth-century rationalism. This is his sermon, and I am sure a large and congenial congre- gation is ready to listen to its preacher. EDWIN TAUSCH. OHIO UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
