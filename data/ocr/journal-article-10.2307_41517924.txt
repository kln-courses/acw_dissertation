The</page><page sequence="2">COMPTES RENDUS 641 land that the mighty Nile nurses with its life-giving waters is the only one in the Mediterranean basin that h?s preserved so far the oldest records of man's trials for this approach. Only recently Kamal el Malakh discovered Khufiťs solar ship which five millennia ago the Pharaoh proposed to use at the end of time, one may suppose, for his timeless journey. It is quite natural in Egypt to think of millennia, end of time, and timelessness. Many religions were here worshipped by immigrant nationalities, such as the Ethiopians, pre-Mohammed- an Arabs, Babylonians, Carthaginians, Lycians, Medes, Paphlago- nians, and Indians (pp. 5, 90) ; but only four in the course of time acquired great importance : the native Egyptian, the Olympian of the Greeks, the Christian of the converted natives, and later, beyond the scope of this volume, the Mohammedan. In the rise, amalgam, and disappearance of religions, Re (sun god) Geb (earth), Nut (sky goddess), and many others, sprang from the darkness of pre-historic times ; in Greek communities they were fused with Greek gods, so Amon became Amon Zeus ; Horus, Horus Apollo ; Thoth, Thoth Hermes ; Ptah, Ptah Hephaistos ; Hathor, Hathor Aphrodite ; etc. ; in Babylonian communities Isis was iden- tified with Nana and became Isis Nanaia (p. 15). In due time all these gods yielded to the Gospel of Christ (p. 83), and the latter in turn yielded to the Koran of Mohammed which now prevails. There is also something interesting in the life of the Jews on the island of Elephantine in southern Egypt. These Jews retained certain practices which were followed in pre-exilic Judah (p. 28) : blood offer- ings in their temple, and a polytheistic religion in which five gods were important : Ya'u ( Yahweh or Jehovah), Bethel, Ishum, Heren and 'Anath ; the latter in a oath is addressed as 'Anathya'u, and so «it looks as if 'Anath were regarded as a female consort of Ya'u, Queen, as he was King, of Heaven » (p. 29). Although Greece evolved its religious experience to a lofty point, hardly surpassed by any other land, Egypt had a greater variety of religious experience. In historical times it had anthropomorphic, and theriomorphic gods ; and also anthropo-theriomorphic gods (a phrase that does not occur in this book). It made not only its Pha- raohs gods (p. 22), but also other men not so prominent in public life, such as Imhotep (or Imouthes), a sage and physician of the third dynasty, whom the Greeks identified with Asklepios ; and Amenôphis, son of Hapu, minister of Amenôphis III (p. 11). Later it contributed to Christianity San Anthony (p. 89) and the monastic movement (p. 88). In its original native religion it conceived of a heaven where a good man, even though poor on earth, would be rewarded with happiness (p. 13-14). Long before Dante's times the Egyptians had developed a system of multiple meanings for the same event in religion. Thus an animal or a thing from the point of view of religious consideration would be interpreted, first, as a symbol of the deity ; second, as the dwelling</page><page sequence="3">642 COMPTES RENÛUS of the deity ; and third, as the palpable manifestation of the deity (p. 10). A land that experienced such varied spiritual life also experienced some of the most inhuman massacres that disgrace the history of humanity. Egyptians stirred pogroms against the Jews (p. 31) ; Romans and Romanized persons persecuted Christians (101) ; Chris- tians butchered those who still believed in the góds of ancient Rome, amongst whom there was Hypatia, a woman (100), one of the finest intellects of those days. At this point I have a query : « When will writers of ancient reli- gions stop misusing the word « pagan » (paganus, pagus) ? For in- stance note the following sentence on p. 39 : «... often enough the Jews and the pagans who surrounded them managed to live together on friendly terms. » What does « pagans » imply here ? Does it imply different religions or different nationalities? The thought should be clarified. Or take this other expression on p. 83 : « &lt; Christians openly displayed &gt; their inability to join in communal acts of pagan wor- ship ». To be accurate the word « pagan » should be replaced with the phrase « state religion » : « pagans » here is an anachronism. The motivation of the last discussion, « The Christian Triumph », should be strenghtened ; and some kind of order should be given to the « Select Bibliography » (pp. 106-107) even though it is intended for the layman. On the whole I found this work interesting and stimulating. Hunter College Raymond Mandra. St. Gregory of Nyssa, The Lord's Prayer . The Beatitudes , translated and annot. by Hilda C. Graef (Westminster- Maryland, The Newman Press, et Londres, Longmans, Green and G°, 1954), v-210 pp. in-16, 25 s. Nous ne pouvons signaler que brièvement cette traduction de deux ouvrages de s. Grégoire de Nysse, parue dans la collection Ancient Christian Writers , dont elle constitue le 18e volume. Il faut regretter avec Madame Graef qu'il n'existe pas d'édition critique de ces traités - aussi la traduction a-t-elle été établie sur des éditions remontant soit à 1840 soit même à 1638 1 Mais cette réserve importante faite, il convient de louer la richesse du commen- taire de Madame Graef ; pour ma part, j'aurais étendu mon enquête à la tradition latine du Notre Père en examinant les De Oratione de Tertullien et de s. Cyprien notamment, ne fût-ce que pour mieux souligner l'originalité de la pensée de S. Grégoire de Nysse. Jean-G. Préaux.</page></plain_text>
