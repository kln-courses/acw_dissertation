ANTHROPOPATHISMS Anthropopathisms occur but infrequently in our Book, and they deal with God's anger; the author of Job had more subtle ways of ex pressing disagreement with those who claimed to comprehend God's action and will.

Whatever views on the subject he may have had did not prevent him from reproducing the anthropopathisms literally, unless he considered a paraphrase of some kind stylistically preferable.40 The use of the term "clear-cut" is fully justified not only by the data themselves — as will be seen immediately -— but by the sig nificant fact that with all their claims of anti-anthropomorphism allegedly manifested by our translator (see pp. 155-57 in § A pre ceding), such more recent critics as Gerleman and Gard passed over in total silence the anthropopathisms of the masoretic text reproduced literally in the Septuagint; at the very least, note might have been made of this clear characteristic of the translator. 1. 1. God's אימה occurs but once in our Book, at 13.21, together with a typical anthropomorphism ; both the latter and the anthropopathism were reproduced literally: (בפך מעלי הרקק) ואמקך (אל־הבעקני) / (rr/v XÛpaXe'Pa àir' èfiov àiréxov,) kclï ô &lt;pô(30s aov (pr! pe KaTaTrXrjcraéTu), "and (let not) Thy fear (terrify me)." 2. The אף of the Lord is mentioned five times in Job, and it is trans lated literally by opyr!: 9.5 המעתיק דוו־ים ולא ;ךעו אשר ה??ם) מאפו) / (ô 7raXatc0R oprj Kal ovk oïôatnv, ô Karaarpeipuv avrà) opyrj.41 9.13 (חחו עזרי רהב# [Qere = ] אלוה לא־:שיב) אפו (תרותיו) / (aûrôs yàp â7rétrrpa7rTat) ôpypv, (vit' avrov enapupd-qaav «97x77 rà Ù7r' ovpavov). The problem of anthropopathism does not exist here, but it should be noted that the original LXX text (already Old Latin has: ipsius enim inadvertabilis ira, ab ipso condita sunt cetera sub caelo) must ohptvos KOLTéfiaXév pt,) 'if}pv!~tv 'tir' tpè tovs ôSôvtcls (OL: fremuit super me dentibus). 40 The Septuagint translation of Job would be better understood if H. S. Geh man's paper in JBL, 68 (1949), 231-40, on "The Theological Approach of the Greek Translator of Job 1-15," had employed the term "stylistic" instead of "theological" in the title; in other words, a much clearer picture of the Greek would have been gained had the translator's alleged theology not been found where it did not exist and was out of place in the picture as a whole. Chapter II of our essay ("The Char acter of the Septuagint Translation of the Book of Job" (see note *above) provides a mass of data to demonstrate this, along with the evidence in the present chapter (III). 41 It is scarcely necessary to note that one of the common features of the Septua gint translation is the omission (or the addition) of the pronominal suffix when it accords with good Greek style at the same time that the pronoun is implied in the translation (or in the original). Cf. §§ 12-13 in Chap. II above, pp. 260-64: § 9, p. 256, at 38.34; Chap. Ill, § B, n. 39 (on at 16.9; on ]?¥ at 16.10).</page><page sequence="3">[3] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 241 have included a negative particle for the Hebrew לא, for otherwise the translation in the second stich makes no sense.

God's קולון is found but once in our Book, in 20.23 (see immed iately above), and it is rendered faithfully: חרון אפו / Ovpov bpyrjs. 4. The Lord's "dread," פחד, was translated literally both times it occurs in Job: 13.11 (הלא קואתו חבעת אחכם) ופחדו (ופל עליכם) / (irô repov ovxl ôeivà avrov arpo^aa vpâs,) tpbfios bè 7rap' avrov {kir lit ta tir ai {kir lit ta tir ai vpîv;). The translator — quite correctly, of course — has reproduced the objective force of the genitive פחד)ו); contrast ô (pbjios croC / אמחל only ten verses farther on. In the difficult verse, 31.23, כי פחד אלי איד אל was rendered tpbfios yàp Kvpiov aw ta\tvta\tv pt — where, unless the Hebrew Vorlage differed from our received text, the anthropopathism went beyond the translator's call of duty. 5. The nouns 9לה? "rebuke" (26.11) and לגז "raging" (37.2) in relation to God belong to verses that are lacking in the Septuagint and, in their Greek form in the standard editions, belong to Theo dotion.42 C. ALLEGED CONCEPT OF AFTERLIFE Nothing is clearer in the book of Job than the fact that the author had no concept of an afterlife other than that the grave was the end of everyone: kings and nobles, the wicked and the wear}־, prisoner and slave, the lowly and the mighty — everyone found a quiet resting place in the unrelieved blackness of Sheol, where even God 42 It may be noted here that the Targum translated literally all the anthro popathisms in our Book. Noteworthy, too, is the extent to which this version re produced the anthropomorphisms (cf. § A above, n. 5). A fresh study of this aspect of the Targumim is very much in order.</page><page sequence="4">242 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [4] Himself was not fully at home (cf. e. g., chap. 3; 7.21b; 10.21-22; cf. Dhorme, p. 92, at 7.9). Indeed, any other concept of afterlife would have made the writing of the Book superfluous, for then the solution of the central problem in the Book, viz., why does the principle of quid pro quo fail so often to operate, would have been: in the world to come the righteous will receive their just reward and the wicked will suffer their deserved deserts. But none of Job, his three friends, Elihu, and God, expresses any such thought. The contrary is true. It is taken for granted by all — no discussion, let alone argument, ever takes place about it — that death constitutes the end of life on earth, and that the grave marks the place of no return. And that is why, naturally, the Book ends with Job receiving his twofold reward from God in this world, and dying at an exceedingly ripe old age.45 As to the Septuagint translator, he reproduced in Greek whatever his Hebrew text had to say about this matter. As in the case of an thropomorphism and anthropopathism, he was the faithful trans lator, whatever his own views of afterlife may have been. The text and data bear out this categorical assertion. 1. 1. 7.6-7 ימי .קלו מניץ*ךג, ô ôè fîîos pov é&lt;rrn' èXcupporepos XaXiâs, :קללו ני^פס קקוה àirbkiokev ôè tv Kevrj èX7rîô1.

The point is, of course, that "my eye will never again see good" because (cf. vv. 8-9) just retribution will be denied Job for lack of escape from eternal Sheol.44 2. 7.9-10 ללה ענן ו.ילך wairep vt&lt;pos à-jroKadapdèv àr' ovpavov. :כן י1ךד שאול לא יללה èàv yàp âvdpwiros Karafir) els aôrjv, ovk Itl pi) àvafirj, ■ני For a clear statement on when the concept of afterlife and resurrection de veloped in the Second Jewish Commonwealth, and on the struggle over thisdoctrine, see the monograph by Abraham A. Neuman, The Immortality of Man: a Jewish Viewpoint Viewpoint (Lancaster, Pa., 1949). 44 Cf., e. g., Dhorme, ad loc. (p. 91), "Le 2e hémistique, d'après le parallélisme et la suite du passage, constate que l'homme, après la mort, ne revient plus sur terre pour jouir du bonheur . . ." Rashi (cf. also Ibn Ezra, Ramban, and others) put it bluntly: לא תשוב עיני ... לאחר מיתה, וכאן כפר איוב בתחיית המתים.</page><page sequence="5">[5] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 243 לאקשוב עוד לביתו לביתו ovb' ov pi] emoTpeiJ/ri en et s tov ïbiov OÎKOV,oÎkov,oÎkov, :ןלא־:כיך13 עוד בקומו:בקומו ovb' ov pr!

Szold's comment on 9b is worth repeating: כן יורד שאול לא יעלה. אבל ישאר שם לעולם (לא אמר אם 'היה שם בחיים או לא, כי איוב אין לו עםק בנםתרות). Or as (Driver-)Gray put it (Vol. I, p. 69): Job beseeches God "to have compassion on him for the short time that remains before he descends forever into the grave.

Thus הבל ;מי may may be connected with Ps.144.4 ך□ להבל ךםה ;מיו בצל עובר^. 48 Commentators have noted the verbal connection between these passages and Ps. 39.14 השע ממני ואבליגה בטךם אלך ואינני.</page><page sequence="6">244 HARRY M.

He did not hesitate to reproduce the biblical pro position that "man once dead, unlike a tree that is cut down, cannot be rejuvenated and start life again, but passes away forever leaving no trace behind" ([Driver-jGray, Vol. I, P• 128). 7. 14.12 ואיש שכב ןלא־:קום avdpioiros ôè KOip-pdeh ov pi! àvaarfj. עד־בלתי שמום לא זי.ק י צ ו eœs àv ô ovpavos ov pi! crvppaipfjJ9 :□ולא :ערו משנס [Theodotion =] /cat ovk è^virvi-crdrjŒOVTaL è£ V1TV0VV1TV0V CLVTÛV. Those who have asserted that our translator deliberately refrained from reproducing the last stich, because of its denial of resurrection (e. g., Bickell, Dillmann, Baer, Budde, [Driver-jGray, Buttenwieser50) simply shut their eyes to the faithful reproduction of the first stich (ואיש שכב ולא־יקום / âvdpwrros ôè KOLprjdeis ov pi] àvaarfj), as well as vv. 2 and 7-10 (above) and v. 14 (below) in this chapter alone, apart from the other pertinent passages in our Book.

An utterly unmethodical line of reasoning is followed by Gerleman (pp. 60 ff.) on this verse, one which he exhibited in connection with the matter of anthropomorphism (see Chap. Ill, § A, pp. 155 ff.). On the one hand he is forced to admit that "in regard to the view of death and the state of death ... If we turn to the LXX, we have the impression [sic!] that the translator, in regard to death and the fate of the dead, entirely shares the view of the author of the dialogue. The great majority of the relevant passages in the LXX are re produced without essential change. [7.9 f. and 16.23 are cited.] Nor do the other cited passages in the LXX give expression to a view deviating from that of the Hebrew poet. The agreement, however, is merely apparent. The difference is shown in the translation of 14.14 14.14 . . ." In other words, every case which is admittedly clear-cut is to be regarded as "merely apparent" because one single case is not clear-cut ! With such reasoning, no conclusion is impossible.52 Our verse is difficult in that חליפתי in the Hebrew is not readily clear and the Septuagint has not divided the verse as the Masoretes have. Whether the first stich (rrijM אם־;מות גבר) is out of place or is a gloss, as many scholars believe,55 our translator reproduced it, ולא 1?5רו מ$תם which disturbs the meter and adds nothing whatever to the context, was not reproduced in the Old Greek simply because it did not exist in the Hebrew text at the time of [I should now word it: that was used by] the translator, and is therefore to be excised as a gloss of לא יקיצו." 52 By disregarding the overwhelming majority of instances where the Hebrew anthropomorphisms were reproduced in the Septuagint, Gerleman (p. 59) was able to demonstrate "the translator's scrupulous aversion [sic !] to describing God in human terms." 53 Thus, e. g., Beer, "Hinter 12' durfte am besten 141 אם־יםות נבר היחיה zurticken sein. Dann entstehen 2 Verse zu je 2 Stichen. Ahnlich schon Reiske." The mathe</page><page sequence="8">246 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [8] but he connected with it most of the second stich: èàv yàp arocpavr! âvdpœirosâvdpœiros ^paeraL avvr\éaa s rjpepas rod fiLov avrov. The punctuation of this sentence, however, is not certain. Many scholars would regard the Greek as interrogative: "For if man die, will he live after completing the days of his life?" And cf. Lagarde's edition of the Old Latin translation of our Greek: si enim mortuus fuerit homo, vivet consummatis diebus vitae suae? Others, however, would regard our Greek as assertive: "If a man die, he will live after com pleting the days of his life." In either case, our translator read some thing like כלה for preserved כל, and צבאו for preserved צבאי. Leaving the inner-Greek problem unsolved, there can be little doubt about the third stich in the LXX: "I will wait until I am made again" (OL: sustinebo usque quo denuo faciam).54 The meaning of the root of חליפתי, the translator, not unreasonably at all, understood to be here exactly what it was but a few verses previously, in v. 7: כי :ש לעץ תקור, אם־:כךת ועוד) ;חליף) / (. . . en) kiravd-qaei, "it will (again) sprout" (OL: . . . iterum floriet). That חליף;, in accordance with the general view in the Book, cannot mean renewed life in our v. 14 is acknowledged by all scholars,55 who generally interpret it to mean "release, relief" from a man's term of service (צבא). Our conclusion, then, is that — unless our Greek verse is to be construed as an interrogative — the Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX was somewhat different from the preserved text (e. g., יח;ה for mivn; כלה or the like for צבאי :כל for צבאי) and that our translator — justi fiably in the context — construed חליפתי to mean "be born again." There was nothing "dogmatisch" (so, e. g., Beer, following Merx) in this interpretation, since our translator everywhere else, including several earlier passages in this very chapter, reproduced similar statements without flinching. 9. 14.20-22. Indeed, only a few verses farther on, vv. 20-22, essen tiallytially the same sentiment is expressed, viz., that man's end is ir revocable and that once dead he knows nothing of what transpires matical count may be correct, but the consequence is wooden, unpoetic Hebrew. (Driver-)Gray, I, 129, "Line 0 is perhaps misplaced, or a marginal annotation . . " Dhorme would attach 14a to v. 19. 54 If the first part is to be understood interrogatively, then this last stich might be understood in that vein too: "shall I wait until I am made again?" Yet this hardly seems likely. 55 Except by those, e. g., Duhm, who follow something of the LXX and come up with: "If only a man might die, and live again!"</page><page sequence="9">[9] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 247 among the living; our translator reproduced this sentiment no less boldly than our Hebrew author did : תתקפהו לנצח עהלךעהלךעהלך waas avrov els réXos, /cat a&gt;xero־ משןה ?ניו וישלחהו: kirearqaas avrœ to irpbawirov /cat è£a 7r€(TTetXas• דו בניו ולא :ךע??: iroWœv ôè ytvopévœv rûv vlwv avrov OVKOVKOVK oîôev,oîôev, :ך?ערו ולאץבין ^מו êàv ôè oXiyoi yèvœvrau, ovk èiriararai־ אך־קןור'ו עליו :?$ב àXX' tj at &lt;râp/ces avrov f!\yrjaav, :7י ונפשו עליו תא?ל ôè '/וvxv avrov èirèvdqaev. 10. 16.22 ןז€7 ?י־שנות מ??ר ;אוזיו ôè àpiQpqrà ?!Kaaiv, :וארח לא־^שוב אהלך ôôc3 ôè, fj ovk t-iravaarpatp-qaopai, iropev aopai.aopai. 11. 11. 20.7-11 גללו לנצח יאבד? ôrav yàp ôo/qj 7ן07ן KarearrjpixdaL, rbrerbre ets réXos à7roXetrat, :01 לאיו יאסרו איו ôè iôbvres avrov èpovaiv IIoO èortt;' חלום ;עוף ולא :מצאהו? icairep èvvtvlov èKTreraadèv où pr! evptdfi, :רדד ?חזיון ^ילה 'èirrr] ôè uairep &lt;pàapa WKrepLvbv. ע:ן שןפתו ולא תוסיף (otpdaXpbs irapè^Xexpev /cat où TpooOqaei, :ולא־עוד ר1שוך3ו מקומו /cat ovk ert rrpoavoqaeL avrov 0 tottos יי י י \ avrov.avrov. ) בניו ירצו דלים roi)s vloùs avrov bXèaaiaav firroves, :ויךיו תש?נה אקו at ôè xe&lt;4&gt;es a,vrov ■Kvpatvaaioav bôvvais. עצמותיו מלאו עלומיו (oarà avrov kveirXqadqaav vebrqros avrov, :עמו על־ע?ר תש?ב) /cat per' avrov è7rt xwMaros KOLpqdqoerai..)56 This whole speech by Zophar is a pessimistic peroration on the fate of the wicked : their own ignoble end and the affliction of their children. 56 The Greek of vv. 9 and 11, placed here in parentheses, derive from Theodo tion.

And not even Beer blames the translator for this minus in the LXX; indeed, he recognizes the possibility, after Bickell, that v. 9, "aus 7, 8 u. 10 geflossene Stiche jiingeren Ursprungs u. dann zu streichen sein."</page><page sequence="10">248 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [10] Job, on the other hand, denying that the fate of their posterity really affects the wicked themselves once they are dead, asserts (Chap. 21) that "once life is over, one who has enjoyed prosperity up to the end is no worse off than one who has lived miserably; difference of fortune belongs to life only; the dead share all a common fate" ([Driver-] Gray, Vol. I, p. 182, Introd. to Chap.

The matter of methodology is here paramount: it is only after all the clear passages and statements in the preserved text of the Hebrew and Greek of our Book have been permitted to speak for themselves that the difficult and elusive instances may be taken up. Otherwise — and that is precisely what a number of critics may justly be accused of — one is guilty of determining the obscurum by something that is obscurius. For it must be stated flatly that our vv. 25-27 are impossible of textual solution on any theory. Thus (Driver-)Gray (Vol. I, pp. 171 ff.) refers to the "corruption and obscurity of the text [p. 171] ... the difficult and in part corrupt lines . . . the obscurities and ambiguities of the text [p. 172] .. . the obscure renderings of . . .

Thus in v. 26b, it is believed by many that the Vorlage was read ומשדי (אחזה?) אלה to give 7rapà 7àp nvpLov nvpLov raura (pot avveTtXeadrj). Whether this be so or not, one can scarcely doubt that the translator would have reproduced ומנזרי ארוןה אלוה in the generally accepted interpretations, "and from (or, away from, without) my flesh I shall see God" in the light of 42.5 (Job to God): ■1שמע אזן שסעוזיף,) ועתה עיני ך$ו1ף?) / (aK0r!v pèv wtos t/kovov aov to irporepov,) vvvi ôè ô 0&lt;pdaXpôs pou èépa/céi' cre. It is clearly most unsafe to attempt to determine the character and motivation of the Septuagint translator on the basis of the Hebrew-Greek of our vv. 25-27. So that whereas (Driver-)Gray, for example, leaves the Hebrew of v. 26a entirely untranslated (except for initial "And"!) and notes (I, 174, ad loc.) that "Line 0 is altogether obscure and uncertain: see phil. nn. Unfortunately being obscure, the phrase in 4 ... is ambiguous . . .," Gard (pp. 39-43) analyzes each word in the Hebrew as though its meaning were really known, assumes that the Hebrew Vorlage of the LXX was identical with the preserved text, and "charges" the LXX translator with avoiding every kind of expression that was derogatory to God. Thus he concludes (pp. 42-43), "One fact is certain: © avoids the anthropomorphic concept of any man's seeing God, even though it be applied to a vision." What, then, e. g., of 42.5? Again, when Gard asserts (p. 41) that "&lt;S objects to גאל חי on the basis that God does not 'live' in the sense that a man lives," then what, e. g., of 27.2, ח'־אל / frj Kvpios, apart from the fact that the translator treated God's נשמה ,נפש, and רוח the same as man's (see above, § A, 9-11)? D. CHARGES AGAINST OR INVOLVING GOD Much has been written about the Septuagint translator's alleged reluctance to placing God in the same light that the Hebrew author of our Book did. So that whereas the creator of the book of Job has been found "guilty" of frequently being most intemperate and some times virtually blasphemous in the references to God that he placed in the mouth of Job or his three friends, the translator has been found "guilty" of refusing to reproduce these harsh statements and of making it his business to tone them down where he did not eliminate them altogether. This general view of the Septuagint lacks justification. It derives</page><page sequence="12">250 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [12] from the same unmethodical, ad hoc procedure by which, e. g., anti anthropomorphism, anti-anthropopathism, etc., were found in the LXX, namely, that of ignoring the vast majority of anthropomorph isms, anthropopathisms, etc., that were reproduced literally, and by asserting that the few remaining instances, that were not reproduced literally, were the consequence of the translator's theology — in other words, that the translator manifested his "theology" less than ten percent of the time. Also ignored, in the process, were the passages where God and theology were not involved and where the translator still rendered "theologically." Not only that, but by failing to reproduce and utilize the many more passages that were reproduced literally, scholars — even if in advertently — created a picture that simply wasn't real.58 In point of fact, the Job of the LXX is no more different from the Job of the masoretic text than the portrayal of any of the friends or God in the Greek and Hebrew. There is nothing theological or tendencious in the Greek; there is nothing but the usual factors involved in turning the Hebrew into Greek: the honest attempt on the part of the trans lator to interpret and translate the Hebrew correctly; the pos sibility of different Hebrew readings in his Vorlage•, and the temper of the translator in the matter of style. In letting the data speak for themselves, it seems best in many instances to reproduce several verses together, or even an entire speech ; in that way the crucial passages may be comprehended in the proper setting. 1. 3.20 :למה לתן לעמל אור וחיים ?ימך, נפש / ïva t'l yàp SéôoraL rots èvèv ■KiKp'iq. &lt;pws, Çair! ôè raïs èv ôôvvais \pvxo.ts] 2.2. 3.23 :1נבר אשר־דךכו נקותךה) נ:סך אלודז בעדו?) / (dàvaros àvôpi ava-ava 7ra1&gt;/ta59) ovveKktiatv yàp ô deos /car' avrov. 58 Thus in the works of Bickell, Dillmann, Gerleraan, Gehman (JBL, 68 [1949], 231-40), and Gard, only the allegedly "tendencious" renderings deriving from the translator's alleged theology are listed; and they are presented quite out of con text. So that the unwary reader is not made to realize that in the overwhelming majority of cases a stich that is cited as evidence for anti-anthropopathism or some other theological bias on the part of the translator actually is preceded or followed, not infrequently, by one or more stichoi that manifest utter conformity with the Hebrew anthropopathism or other such theological phenomenon. s9 It is generally agreed that dâvaros stands for קבר in v. 22 preceding, though the rest of the Vorlage of the stich is uncertain (cf., e. g., Beer, Dhorme). The argu ment of the second stich, however, remains unaffected.</page><page sequence="13">[13] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 251 3. 5.18 (הךפיןה [Qere=] כי־הוא !כאיב (רז־ובש) !ק'סץ (ןיךיו / avros yàp yàp àXyeîvàXyeîv 7rotet (xal 1rà\i.v à1r0KadlcrTr](nv)־ erato'»־ (kcli al xe^Pe$ aÛTovaÛTov iâaavTo) .6° 4. 6.4 :כי חצי שרי עעדי אשר המתם שותה רוחי כעותי אלוה !עדכוני / /SéXrç yàp yàp Kvpiov 'ev rw acoparl pou ècTiv, &amp;v ô dvpos avrwv è/&lt;7rîm pou to to alpa0 ־Tav a p^wpat, \a\etv, KevToval pe. Scholars generally have recognized difficulty in the masoretic text, as well as in the received Greek correspondent for the third stich: "the terrors of God are arrayed against me" is scarcely represented by the LXX: "and whenever I begin to speak, they (viz., the /3éX1? 'arrows' of the Lord) pierce me." Thus, according to Schleussner, s. XaXéw (III, 425), "*בעותים . . . [LXX] Deduxerunt ab ענת, quod in in 1.

Beer would reconstruct the translator's Vorlage as "אמלל od. 4 .כעת אלוע§&gt; hat בעותי ganz verkannt // יערכוני &lt;S&gt;. . . lesen besser יעכרוני (Dill.4) . .

As to the second stich, Beer believes that "tîbrigens wird der Satz mit אשר nur eine Glosse sein wie 4, 19." (Driver-)Gray (I, 59 f.) notes the "overlong" character of the stich which "may be due to some dislocation of the text" but "no certain reconstruction can be suggested." Ignoring these problems and solutions, Gehman believes that this is one of the passages where "# softens or tones down what may have seemed offensive" (pp. 234 f.); so that the translator "removed" the Hebrew "the terrors of God" and "played with the root; בעותי may have suggested Hebrew בעה, Aramaic בעא, 'to seek'. At any rate 'the terrors of God' is eliminated, and # reads: 'When I begin to speak, they OSéXrç) prick me.' " But apart from the fact that LXX "begin to speak" has nothing to do with Aramaic בעא "to seek" (and the less said about the Septuagint translator "playing" with roots the better; cf. Chap. I, P• 7L rt• 63), one may well ask 60 Gerleman (p. 59) explains the anthropomorphism, at Xe'Pes olvtov for דיו,:ז־יו:, as due to "less concrete context" and ignores the rest of the verse! Against such "reasoning" it is not very easy to reason; cf. above, Chap. Ill, § A, pp. 155-59.</page><page sequence="14">252 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [14] why "the terrors of God" should terrify the translator when "the arrows of the Lord, the wrath of which drinks up my blood"61 did not. Furthermore, every other occurrence of God's "terror" in our Book (cf. § B 1-4 above) was reproduced faithfully, including those passages in which the root בעת was found: 9.34 (ואמתו] אל־תבעתני] / /ri) pe (JTpofidTw)■, 13.11 (דזלא ?!אתו] תבעת אתכם] / &lt;TTpo(3i]ae1. vpâs); and 13.21 (א?תף] אל־תבעתני) PHI* 7י"/ / [??ד ¥9לי M€ /cara7rXrçcr&lt;réTC&lt;;). This apart from such other passages with בעת, where God is the subject, which were reproduced literally, e.g., 7.14 (cf. in § 5 im mediately below). I have not bothered to list here the synonyms of בעת where God is the subject, but they will all be found in this very section (D) and in § E immediately following. We may safely assume that theology played no role whatever in the LXX rendering of our third stich; in all probability (cf., e. g., the failure to reproduce אלות) the LXX-Vorlage was different from the received text. 5. 6.8-10 מי־לסן תבוא שאלתי et yàp ôûr] /cat eX0ot pov rj aÏT7]&lt;ns, :ןתקןתי ותן אלות /cat ttjv éX7rtùa pov ôœrj ô xvpios. לאל אלות רד?אני api-àpevos ô Kvpios rpcocrarw pe,pe, תר ;דו ויב^עני; ds réXos 8è pi) pe cbeXérco. ותתי־עוד נת?תי dir! ôé pov 7rôXts ratpos, אסלךה תחילה לא־:תמול} è&lt;p' r!s é7rt retxécoR rjWoprjv eir' avrrjs, où pi]pi] cpeiawpai :י־לא כחז־תי אמרי זקדוש? où yàp exf/evaap-qv pripara àyia deov pov.

Beer, "41. . . ergânzt willkiirlich pi] (Drusius)"; Dhorme, "&lt;S ... est une paraphrase qui joue sur le sens de 'délier sa main' du 2e hémistique. On ne peut y voir, avec Beer, le résultat d'une leçon לאחרית au lieu de יתר ידו." Whatever the reason(s) for the Greek differing from the Hebrew, the fact is that the translator did not find repulsive other passages which refer to God as doing away with Job, e. g., 14.20, תתקפהו ?1נצח ן;הלך משנה פניו נתשלחהו / àaas avTov eis ré\os /cai cçx^to, èiréaT-paas aùr&lt;S to irpôawirov /cat ê£a7récn-etXas. — Note the use of €t's réXos here and in 6.9b. Furthermore, the translator did not insert the negative particle : On alfia for רוח, see Chap. II, § 11 (p. 258).</page><page sequence="15">[15] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 253 to nullify the intent of the sacred text that he was reproducing; this is a serious — and facile — accusation to level against the LXX translator without clear-cut evidence.62 If the LXX text is original (i. e., if negative pr\ in 9b is not secondary), it seems most likely that the Vorlage of 9b differed from our masoretic text and that it was interpreted to mean approximately : "let Him hold back His hand when He destroys me," which the trans lator turned into "let Him not utterly destroy me." (On this use of the negative in the LXX, cf. § 1 of Chap. II). This sentiment is ex pressed elsewhere in our Book, e. g., 7.16b, 19a; 14.6a. Finally, it should not be overlooked that our translator did not fail to reproduce the essence of the Hebrew, even with v. 9b —-a stich that recalls at once such a passage as 13.21, בפך ס^לי הך!זק לאמתך 8ל־ף1בעס3י / rrjv xeb°a ®־מ' èpov à-rréxov, Kal ô &lt;pô(50s &lt;rov prj pepe KaTairXrjaaeTW. 6. 7.12 ff. 12) הלם־אני אם תר ן תר ן תר ן) irbrepov dâXacraà eipi r! bpâicœv :י'תשים בלי משמר? otl Karéra^as kir' èpè &lt;pv\aKr)V, 13) כי־אסךתי ת3חםר ¥!■£') élira ôti ttapaKaXéaec pe r! k\'lvף pov,pov, ;שא ?שיחי מ^ו^בי! àvoiaw ôè irpos èpavrov lôcç, \6yov rrj KOLTflKOLTfl pOV. 14) לחתתר בהלמותלחתתר בהלמות בהלמות) èKtpofieîs pe èvvirvioLs :וסחלינות תבעתני Kal èv ôpàpaaiv pe KaTa1r\r!acre1s. 15) יתתחר מסלק 93שי) à7raX\ci£e1s d7rô trvevparbs pov ti)v \pvxvv 1PVXVV M0G :,מלת מעימות àiro ôè davàrov rà oora pov. Note how the entire section was reproduced without modification in in regard to God's terrifying actions and Job's wish to die in order to free himself from them. Interestingly, while dealing specifically with the problem that is the core of these verses, recent critics such as Gerleman, Gehman, and Gard passed over this section in silence, as they did in the case of 3.20, 23; 5.18; and (except for Gehman; see above) 6.4, 8-9. 7. 7.19-21 19) כןןה לא'תשעה מקני) eus t'lvos ovk êâs pe :לא־תךפני עד־בלעי ר,קי oûôè rpoîjj pe, ecos âv xara7rtco tov irrveXbv pov èv oôvvr!; 62 On how our translator manipulated the negative particle, see Chap.

But desirable as it is to reproduce all fifty six verses of the Hebrew and Greek, only enough verses will be cited to provide adequate background for the few "controversial" pas sages. From reading Gerleman, Gehman, and Gard, one would think that the translation was outrageously tendencious, Gerleman re ferring only to 10.3, 13, 16; Gehman to 9. 14-16, 20-23; 10.4, 7; and Gard to 9.12-13, 22-25; 10•2&gt; 13* 17• After expatiating on God as the creator and as omnipotent (9.5 10), Job continued with 9.11-16: 11) הן :עבר עלי ולא אראה) èàv virepfirj pe, où pr! ïôu :החלף ולא־אבין לו Kai èàv TvapèXdr! pe, ovô' us eyvuv. 12) הן :קתף מי ישיבנו הן :קתף מי ישיבנו ישיבנו) èàv àiraXXà^ri, tLs à7r00Tpe^e1 ; :מי־יאמר אליו מה־תעשה:מה־תעשה f! ris èpei aùrû Tt èiroiriaas] 13) אלוה לא־:שיב אפו אפו) avros yàp à1rê&lt;7Tpa7TTa1. àpyrjv, :שחחו עזך, רהב [Qere=] תרתיו Ù7r' aùrov èKaptpôrjaav kt]TT] rà Ù7r' oùpavbv.oùpavbv.oùpavbv. 14) אף כי־אנכי א^ננו) èàv ôè pov ÙTraKovarjrai., :אבחךה ךבךי עפו f! biaKpiveî rà prjparà pov. 15) אשר אם־צך־קתי לא־אענהלא־אענהלא־אענה) èàv re yàp u bUaios, oùk eiaaKov aérai aérai pov, :לסשקטי א החנן: א החנן •X roD Kpiparos avrov ôer!67]00pa1 Y 16) אם־זקךאו!י !;עמי!;עמי) èàv re KaXèau Kai viraKovaji, :לא־אאמין כי־:אזין קולי où ■Kiarevu on eiaaK7]K0èv pov.

" This statement, however, suffers from two faults: (1) חתף (pace the traditional rendering) does not necessarily mean "seize" (cf. the data, e.g., in Dhorme); and (2) àrraXXàaau need not mean "set free." The usage of this Greek root in the LXX of Job is most interesting and instructive: (i) our trans lator used forms of àiraXXâaau more frequently than did all the other LXX translators combined; (ii) he used this root for a variety of Hebrew words: ('?&gt;93 7.15 ,נתקחר (מחנקa; 10.19 ,(מבטן לקבר) אובלb;</page><page sequence="18">256 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [18] (סר (מעלי שבטו: in 9-34a and (33לא־אס'ר (תמתי מ?' in 27.5b; (סתר (עמל מעיני:!, 3-iob; as well as for our יחתף• So that even on the assumed meaning "seize; carry off" for חתף, Schleusner has observed (I, 325, s. a7raXXaTTw), "kàv à7raXXà£27, si removerit: ubi non legerunt חלף." (b) In 9.13a, Gard (pp. 62 f.) believes that to the author "the anger of God is tremendous force, inanimate and irresistible. The trans lator does not like this rather mechanical idea of the workings of God, and he omits the suffix ו from אפו and the negative לא and renders: 'For he himself has turned back anger ... In this way depicts the anger of God as tempered by his mercy." Or as Beer put it previously (but with an alternative explanation that clears our translator of bias), "&lt;@ . . . lâsst aus dogmatischem Intéressé לא weg, oder iiber sieht es nach אלוה"; cf. Dhorme, "(S . . . enlève la négation, peut-être par scrupule théologique (Beer)." It was demonstrated already above (see the verses quoted in § B, 2 on אף; and in §§ 1, 3-4 on פחד ,חרון ,אימה) that our translator re produced not only God's "wrath" but also the actions associated with it. Again, the idea of omitting the negative particle (as of adding it; cf. § 5 above on 6.9b and n. 62) is quite foreign to our translator and should not have been attributed to him ad hoc and without proof. But there is something more fundamental involved here, un mentioned by the critics, viz., the Greek lacks a correspondent for אלוה; for avros is not yet Kvpios. This must be taken together with another inner-Greek matter, viz., v. 13 in the Greek makes no sense per per se in that b is a non-sequitur after a: "For He Himself has turned back (His) anger, the sea-monsters under heaven have stooped (or, bowed) under Him." On the other hand, the assumption of a negative particle in the original Greek would make b a logical consequence of a. Yet the preserved Greek text may be original and its Hebrew Vorlage have suffered corruption : הוא ישיב אפו or the like for אלוה לא ישיב אפו. Our translator did not suppress the suffix in אפו: the suffix (avTOv) is readily understood in the context. (And why would the suffix have to be deleted once it is assumed that the negative had been dropped?) (c) In 9.14-15, Gehman (pp. 233 f.) believes that "(3, by changing the persons, avoids the temerity of answering God by way of argu ment." But even on the surface of it, not only is it in utter disregard of our translator's style to accuse him of such "temerity" but it is straining credulity to see in our preserved Hebrew text anything that would arouse any translator's temerity; after all, "answering God by way of argument" is a common enough phenomenon — indeed a significant characteristic — not only in the book of Job but in the Bible in general.</page><page sequence="19">[19] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 257 Actually, however, even on Gehman's premises, the argument is no argument. For he understood the masoretic text to say: "How much less shall I answer him (And) choose out my arguments with him? Whom, though I were righteous, I could not answer; I would make supllication to him that contendeth with me." What is so shocking about Job saying (vv. 13-14) that if monstrous Rahab's helpers must bow to God, then surely he mimself could not hope to cope with Him? But the whole argument becomes academic when one realizes that our translator's Vorlage may not have been identical with the maso retic text, and that some of the words may have been vocalized some what differently. Indeed, many scholars, following the LXX, Theo dotion, and the Peshitta, vocalize "לא אענה, das viel besser als das Qal in dem Zusammenhang passt. . ." (Beer; or cf. Dhorme). (d) In 9.16, while recognizing "a difficulty . . . because no negative precedes ע י :. . .," Gehman (p. 234) accuses © of adding the negative pi] and thus "removing the idea of distrust in God and a denial of actual evidence ..." It is methodologically hardly proper automatically to downgrade and accuse a translator of tendenciousness at precisely the point where the original is itself admittedly suspect. But apart from that: (1) Several scholars regard LXX pr\ as reflecting original (לא (יענני; (2) Dhorme would regard p7} as a corruption of pt. I do not know how to choose the correct solution from among these several possibilities. It is safest to leave the problem without solution, without emenda tion (either of MT or LXX), and without accusation. 11. 11. In dealing with 9.20-24, the critics of the LXX, as observed previously, do not note the manner and extent to which the trans lator has reproduced what might normally constitute "theologically" offensive statements.

Thus iW . . . 'Though 1 be innocent, he (God) declares me crooked.' &lt;S takes God out of this verse: 'Though I be blameless, 1 shall prove to be crooked'. . ." But the fact is that God is not involved in the verse at all. The subject of ויעקשני, as of ירשעני in the first line, is פי / to VTOpa pov, so that acre/377cm . . . cr/coXtos airofiricropaL are merely stylistic aspects of the translator's work.63 In 21a, where LXX reads "even if I have sinned" for masoretic "(though) I am blameless," it is not only incorrect to assert dog matically that "45. . . verkehrt die erste Hâlfte des Textes in ihr Gegenteil" (Beer; cf. Dhorme, "&lt;S corrige le 1er hémistiche..."; Gerleman, 57) but it is far more likely that the translation harbors something closer to the original: (1) the repetition of תם אני after the verse preceding is not altogether normal, especially when (2) the whole point in Job's statement is that so far as he knows he is blame less (20a, תם אני), and that if he has sinned (LXX 21a) he is not aware of it.

" But the matter is hardly that simple. Firstly, in view of the fact that our tranlator does not avoid making God Himself the destroyer (cf., e. g., 6.9; 10.3, 8; 13.15; 14.20), there would be no special reason for doing so here. Secondly, even if the translator, whatever the reason, did not care to reproduce literally "He destroys," he could readily have resorted to some such simple expedient as turning the active into the passive ("are de stroved"). Thirdly, the fact that "wrath" is present in the LXX and that this concept is manifested elsewhere in our Book (cf., e. g., 9.13; 10.17; 14.3; 16.9; 20.23) justifies the possibility that our trans lator's Vorlage read differently from preserved (הוא (מכלה. On all accounts, then, it is scarcely permissible to attribute to the translator any theological motivation regarding God in this verse. 111 vv. 23 and 24a (24bc is lacking in the LXX, and Theodotion's rendering now represents it; see further, Chap. V), as in v. 22 pre ceding, there appears to have been some variation in text between the LXX Vorlage and the preserved Hebrew version. Having taken עוט (or some similar word) in a to mean "fool" (tpavkoC), there was no reason for the translator to avoid a literal rendering of ילעג "He (viz., God) mocks" in b\ after all, it was not the demise of the righteous that was involved. One can but assume that masoretic שוט ימית / («paOXoi kv davarcp) read differently in the LXX Vorlage (the LXX has preserved nothing for למסת). On the other hand, the translator did not refrain not only from asserting "but the righteous are laughed to scorn" (23b) but he even singled out the same "righteous" (as against the more general או־ץ; per contra Gard, p. 72) as being those who "are handed over into the hands of the wicked" (24a). All in all, 9.20-24 is not an easy section to understand, it read differently in the LXX Vorlage, and suffered no harm at the hands of the translator causa causa God. 13.

In 10.2-8 there are several passages where a "finnicky" trans lator might have succumbed to the temptation of "playing it safe"; indeed our translator has sometimes been accused of precisely that, e.g., Dhorme and Gerleman at 10.3; Beer and Gehman at 10.3, 7; Gard at 10.2.

In v. 2 it may well be, as put by Beer, . . . zieht הודיעני falsch nach 21 . . ."; but the fact remains that the translator's version of Job's plea to God, "Do not teach me to act wickedly," is much stronger than the masoretic (Gard, pp. 17-18, per contra). Unfortu</page><page sequence="23">[23] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 261 nately, those (e. g., Beer, Gerleman, Gehman) who criticize the LXX of v. 3 do not tell this to their readers; they simply assert for them in re כי־תעשק / eav aôiK-qaoi that the LXX is a "dogmatische Korrektur" (Beer), or a modification of God as a "demonic enemy" (Gerleman, 53), or as a suppression of "a reflection upon God's moral character" (Gehman, 234). There can be no doubt that LXX "(Is it good for You) if I act unrighteously" is not the same as masoretic "if You oppress." But what has theology to do with this? Our translator did not modify such expressions involving God, vide e. g., !17] /re cure!Qeiv ôiôaaice in the verse preceding, and stichoi b and c immediately following in our own verse.64 What is probably involved here is a reading in the LXX Vorlage (perhaps merely אעשק) that differed from the preserved text; àÔLKto) was used elsewhere for עשק (e. g., Lev. 5.21,23; Isa. 23.12). It is easy to assert (as Gerleman does, p. 53) that the translator mo difies the text "where he sees in God a demonic enemy" and refer to תעשק / aÔLKrjaw as proof; but where is the scholarship that sup presses vv. 2 and 3bc and ignores God as a "demonic enemy" in the LXX of v. 8, where ותבל עני was reproduced directly pe eTaiaas, and the many similar passages? 16. In 10.15-20, such passages as אם ... (צדקת' לא־אמא לאשי מבע קלון (15), 16) ומאה כשחל תצודני ותשב תתפלא־ בי), and תחדש עךיך עדי ותו־ב כעמך 17) .עקןךי חליפות (צבא עמי), the picture is only very partially and alto gether misleadingly painted when Gerleman (p 54) limits his comment to part of 16a: "Sometimes the translator uses quite simple means to tone down the original . . . כשחל תצודני / àyptiiopaL yàp wawep Xéwv [ets &lt;7(payrjv]." Taken as a whole, the LXX reproduces the bitterness of v. 15 against God (éâi' re a&gt; ôiicaios, oil ôvvapai avaKinpai,avaKinpai, 1rXr]pr)$ yàp ariplas dpi) and the full force of 16b (iraXiv ôè perafiaXoiv 5eu!ûs, pe ôXé/ccis) and 17bc (àpyfj ôè peyâXr!peyâXr!peyâXr! pot èxpvcrai, è7rrjyayes ôè èir' èpè TeiparripLa). So that when Gerleman attributes the change of person in 16a from 2nd ("You [viz., God] hunt me") to 1st ("I am hunted"; [[ויגאה כשחל תצותי / àypeiiopaL [yàp waTep Xeon' eis &lt;T&lt;payr!v]) to the trans lator's desire "to tone down the original," he fails not only to take note of the context as a whole but he overlooks the fact that nothing important has really been toned down in 16a: "For I am hunted like 6&lt; Gehman's rendering of the Greek in b and c, "That I renounce . . . But didst thou attend . . should be corrected to "That thou renounce . . . And that thou attendest..."</page><page sequence="24">262 HARRY M. ORLINSKY [24] a lion to slaughter" in the light of 16bc can mean nothing other than that God is the hunter. On the other hand, it is more than likely that the translator had a somewhat different text in his Vorlage, so that the difference in voice between active and passive may be due to the Vorlage rather than to style. It may be noted here that in 17c, whatever meaning masoretic חליפות וצבא עמי may have, the LXX rendering, "You (viz., God) did bring robbers upon me," is even more direct and "offensive" than the Hebrew. Gard (pp. 38-39), having begun his study with an "a priori" verdict of "guilty" against the LXX translator, translates the masoretic text, "Columns and a host (come) against me," and goes on to assert that "(0 chose rather to portray God as thundering in wrath against Job. (S then avoids the physical connotation of 'columns and a host' with respect to God ..." I suppose that one can prove anything this way. In 18a the translator reproduced literally the Hebrew: "Why did You bring me out of the womb?" 17. In 11.7 the Greek reads even more "physically" than the Hebrew: (החיקר אלוה (תמצא / r! I'xros Kvpiov (eîiprjaeLs), "(have you discov ered) the trace (or: foot, clue) of the Lord?"65 18. 12.4 is an admittedly difficult verse per se; the LXX — for whatever reason — has an abbreviated version of it. Yet the trans lation is more blunt, and uncomplimentary, so far as God is concerned : צדיק תמים plntp מחק לרעהו וארדה קרא לאלוה !;ענהו / ôikcuos yàp àvrjp KalKal âpepirros kytvrjdï] eis xKtiiaapa, "for a righteous and innocent man has become a mockery." But Gerleman makes no mention of this when he deals summarily (p. 54) with v. 6, where the extremely diffi cult Hebrew (!שליו ילהלים לשדרים ובטחות למך?יזי אל לאשר הביא אלוה ב;ךו) — whatever it means — is placed alongside the LXX reading without any analysis, and asserts categorically: "The verbose Greek version is probably a paraphrase without exact correspondence in the original. Probably the translator has isolated ובטחות from the context and built up round that word a very free interpretation, in which Job maintains the certainty of retribution." It is safest to dispense with the two "probably" 's and simply admit that the Hebrew-Greek of this verse as }'et defies convincing analysis. 65 Gerleman (pp. 18-19) need not have written on l\voî / חקר had he seen Schleusner, s. v., Ill, 131.</page><page sequence="25">[25] STUDIES IN THE SEPTUAGINT OF JOB 263 19. In 12.17-25, such outspoken passages as מוליך יועצים שולל ןש5טים מסיר שפה לנאמנ;ם וטעם .(19) מוליך כהני□ שולל ואתנים יסלף ,(17) יהולל 20) זקנים י"קח), and 24) מסיר לב ךאשי עם־האךץ ו!תעם בתהו לא־ךךך), were reproduced by the translator faithfully. In singling out 20b, Gard asserts (p. 7) that Job's suggestion, in the preserved text, "that God at times acts somewhat capriciously . . . [was] studiously avoided by &lt;&amp;, which renders . . .וטעם זקנים) יקה ") by (avveaiv ôè -n-peafivrepuv) tyvw,tyvw, "And He knows (the knowledge of the elders)." However, not only is it plainly contrary to fact to assert that the translator "stu diously avoided" such imputations against God, but the root לקח does have the meaning of "know" (so rendered in the LXX of I Sam. 17.18; and cf. biblical לקח). In v. 25, Gehman (p. 236) has suggested that the translator deliberately suppressed God as the one who misleads the leaders of nations referred to in vv. 23-24: 1 '0) (23) משגיא לגולם ויאבדםr\avûv Wvy Kai àiroWvwv aura,) :שטח לגולם [!נחם Karaarpœvvvuv Wvy Kal Kadob-qyûv ailTCL.ailTCL. 24) מסיר לב ךאשי עם־האךץ) ôiaWàaawv napôLas àpxôvruv yrjs, :1!קעם ?תהו לא־ךךך:לא־ךךך:לא־ךךך eirXavyaev ôè avrovs èv ôô&lt;£, y ovkovk ?)ôetcrau. 25) ימששרחשך ולא־אור) \J/7]\a&lt;p7]&lt;7a1&lt;7av okotos Kai py &lt;pûs, :ו!וזעם כשקור irXavrideLrjaav ôè wairep ô pedvwv. It is clear from vv. 23b-24, not mentioned by Gehman, that God is the one directly responsible for "overthrowing nations and leading them off" (KaraffTpuvvvcov . . . Kadoôyyûv), etc., and for "perplexing (ôtaXXâcrtrajï') the minds of the princes . . . and causing them to wander" (ויתעם / eirXavr!ere ôè avrovs), with the LXX reproducing these charges literally. So that if the LXX reads the passive ifKavy deiyaavdeiyaav for ויתעם in v. 25, the most that can be said — and that is what many scholars have asserted (e. g., Bickell, Gottheil [JQR, OS,OS, 6 (1893-94), 559] Beer ["&lt;&amp; nicht dogmatisch iibersetzt"] Dhorme) — is that the translator's Vorlage read ימששו //) [ל$עו). 20. It is scarcely possible — indeed, it is hardly necessary — to discuss in detail every word or passage that has been made the basis for "attack" on the translator. The analysis employed in the four sections of this Chapter has amply indicated the methodology to be applied to the Hebrew-Greek text. Thus Gehman (p. 236) asserts</page><page sequence="26">[26] 264 HARRY M. ORLINSKY that "In 13 25 harshness is removed, or God's arbitrariness is softened" when masoretic "And the dry stubble will You pursue?" is turned in the LXX into "Are You opposed to me, as to grass borne by the wind?" But LXX (f! ws . . .) àvTiKaaai poi, "(or as a leaf...) will You set Yourself against me?", used elsewhere in the LXX for roots צור (Exod. 23.22; God vs. Israel's צך!־ים) and מטן, is actually harsher than the Hebrew "will You pursue (the dry stubble)"! And, in context, no mention is made of the verse immediately preceding or the verses immediately following where the "harshness" of the Hebrew is retained in the LXX: "Why do You (viz., God) hide from me (viz., Job), and regard me as Your enemy? (v. 24) . . . For You have written evil things against me (26a) . . . And You have placed my foot in the stocks (27a) . . ." Accordingly, only selected passages will be offered below, passages that have some special interest for the textual criticism of the LXX of Job or that illustrate how readily the LXX translator rendered the Hebrew even more harshly — so far as God was concerned — than the original warranted. Virtually none of the passages listed here was noted by those who downgraded the LXX as a translation that was theologically biased. 21. In 14.17 (חתם (בצרור פשעי is rendered "You (viz., God) have sealed up" (e&lt;r&lt;ppa71&lt;ras), which — unless it derived from חתמת— is more outspoken than masoretic □np. 22.

Gard (p. 65) accuses the translator of having purposely altered the verbs in vv. 13bc-14 from singular to plural in order to "remove God from the passages." However, in the light of the variation of person and number in v. iobc, and the LXX "Lord . . . He" in vv. 11-12, this accusation is groundless. The LXX simply understood the verbs in the singular as collective. In 19.12 ff. the Hebrew follows up נהליו with the plural; on הךחיק / àiréoTTfaav ( = רחקו), see Chap ter VI. 24. In 16.21a the translator reproduced unflinchingly Job's wishful thinking: ויוכח לגבר עמ־אלוה / e'irj 8è eXeyxos àvôpi evavn Kvpiov. Gard (p. 30) stands alone in the belief that evavri for עם is evidence that "The translator objects to the idea of conflict with God." 25. In 19.3 LXX reads yvœre povov otl à Kvpios èiroirfoè pe ovtois, whatever the original Hebrew for it may have been (cf., e. g., Beer, Dhorme); and the same charge against God, only more specif ically, is repeated in v. 6: רעו־אפו כי־אלוה עותני yvûre ovv otl ô Kvpios èanv ô rapà^as,66 :ומצוה עלי הקיף oxvpupa ôè avrov ê7r èpè inj/oxrev. 66 Gard (p. 64), ignoring v. 3 and the whole context, accuses the translator of having deliberately omitted "the suffix ני from the verb" in 6a — as though "Know then that it is the Lord who has troubled" were a compliment to God, or</page><page sequence="28">266 HARRY M.

The LXX translation of 16b, "He (viz., God) does not behold the works of the wicked," is as blasphemous a statement as one could wish; why should v. 15 stump the translator? See further, Chap. V. 27. In 21.23-26 Job once again laments the fate of man: זה ;מות 23) בעצם תטוa), 25) תה ןמות בנפש מרה ןלא־אכל בטובה), and :חד על־עפר 26) נ'ןו,כבו ורמה בכמה עליהם).

Difficult as it sometimes is to determine the LXX Vorlage (e. g., 12c), the Greek per se is forthright. 30. In 25.3b Hebrew ועל־מי לאץקום) אח־הו) is reproduced (é7rt rivas Ôè Ôè ovk èireXevaerai) 'éveôpa irap' avrov] where the translator did not hesitate to render fully "an ambush from Him." Many scholars regard a form of ארב in the LXX Vorlage to be the original reading (cf., e. g., Schleusner, II, 360; Dhorme). 31. In 27.2 where (חי־אל) הסיר משפטי (לשדי המר נ?שי) was rendered (Z(Zfj KvpioSj ) ôs ovTco pe KèKprvev, (xat ô iravroKparup 0 7rtxpd vas vas pov rr!v \pvxyv), Beer talks of "abschwâchende Ubers.," Dhorme asserts that "le sens ... est atténué par &lt;©," Gerleman (p. 54) refers to "modification," and Gard (11 f.) believes that the translator avoided referring to "an unjust, almost demoniacal Deity." In a calmer, more objective vein, it will be seen that the translator, theologically speaking, really avoided or modified nothing. He reproduced the oath at the very outset (Z77 Kvpros) and minced no words in the second stich: "And it is the Almighty who has em bittered my soul." Not only that, but in v. 6 the translator asserted flatly: ÔLKatoavvri ôè irpooèxuv oil pi] irpoûpai, ov yàp abvoiôa èpavrûèpavrû aroira irpâÇas (Heb. בצד,קתי הס!כןף1י ללא אךפה לא־לחרף לבבי מלמי:). Clearly, LXX "who has judged me thus" is a rendering that was stylistically, rather than theologically, motivated. Finally, those who may still need convincing, may in addition look at 34.5b, where לאל הסיר משפטי was reproduced ô Kvpios àirrjXXa^èv pov to KpLpa (and cf. at 34.6a below, § 33.)</page><page sequence="30">[30] 268 HARRY M. ORLINSKY 32. In 30.11 the bold expression in [Qere = nfi! ;Kethib = ] i"1!v כי פתח נ י ע_3 נ י י was reproduced in the LXX: avouas yàp (paper pav(paper pav avrovavrov eKanuaev pe, "For He has opened His quiver and afflicted me." The same is true in 14a, 1BéXeaiv avrov KarrjKÔvriaév pe, "with His weapons He has shot at me," where the Hebrew Vorlage can no longer be determined. Likewise, e. g., 21b, פעצם יךך תופסני / nparaia pe èpaariyœaas, "with a strong hand You have afflicted me"; or 22a, traças ôè pe èv àôvvais, "You have put me in grief," whatever the Vorlage may have been. 33. In addition to reproducing literally 34.5b (לאל הסיר מיןופטי; cf. at 27.2 above, § 31), our translator rendered bluntly also in v. 6a: e\J/evaaro ôè rœ Kp'ipari pov "He has lied in my justice," for which the masoretic text has על משפטי אמב. In this light it is hardly sound methodology to accuse the translator of being "dogmat." (Beer) in v. 10, where LXX M17 poi e'irj evavri Kvpiov acreftrjoaL corre sponds to masoretic חללה לאל מרשע; clearly the Greek derives from a somewhat different Hebrew Vorlage — especially when two verses farther on (12) o'lrj ôè rov Kvpiov aroira iroi-qaeiv, fj ô 7ravronpà- avronpa rœprœp rapa^ei np'iaiv; reproduces אף־אמנם אל לא־לרשיע (שר' לא־ י עי ת מש§ט. On o'Lrj for אף־אמנם, see Chap. II, §A 3 ,ad loc. 34. There is a problem involved in the matter of the exact force of the preposition in צךק מן, as distinct from צדק עם / לפני. At 4.17, e.g., האנוש מאללה לפרק was rendered rL yap\ pi! nadapos eorai fiporosfiporos kvavriov Kvpiov . . ., (Driver-)Gray (ICC on Job), without reference to the LXX, argues strongly for the meaning "before God"; Brown-Driver-Bnggs (s. 842 ,צדקb) and (Driver-)Gray at 32.2, where על־צדקל נפשו מאלהים was translated ôiôri â1ré(pr]vev èavrovèavrov ôUaiov èvavrLov nvpiov, would render "rather than God." In both 4.17 and 32.2, Dhorme follows the LXX in rendering "devant." In 32.2, where אםךתי) צל־קי מאל) was translated ÔUaLÔs elptelpt evavri Kvpiov, both (Driver-)Gray and Dhorme render "before" (see their philological notes ad loc.). In fine, the precise meaning of צדק) מן) must be determined per se,se, if possible, before the LXX rendering of it can be evaluated. 35. Summary attention may be drawn to 38.1 ff., where God's numerous acts of creation are described in some detail. These acts are physical enough. It should come as no surprise to the student of the LXX of Job that the translator reproduced the Hebrew termi nology faithfully.</page></plain_text>
