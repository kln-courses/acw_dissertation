<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS ern eyes (which is quite a different kettle of fish), it is impossible to discern it from this illustration. Similarly, certain pictographs of the lower Pecos (Diablo) region of Texas are said to bear a "strong likeness" (p. 31) to Style 2 petroglyphs of the Glen Canyon region. A study of the description of Style 2 petroglyphs (p. 6) fails to reveal any convincing similarities except possibly that anthropomorphic figures are "poorly executed" in both. If we turn to the illustrations for help, we find that Fig. 8 is captioned as having Style 2 petroglyphs; but the middle section of this photograph is lightstruck, and the mountain sheep which do happen to be clearly visible are not present in any lower Pecos paintings. Other Style 2 illustrations are equally faulty; either the photo- graphs are not clear or it is impossible to find the alleged similarities. In short, Turner fails to make a convincing case for the relationship between Style 2 petroglyphs and the lower Pecos pictographs. It is difficult to assess the accuracy of the other relationships Turner proposes, either because of defective illustration or because the descriptive terms employed are puzzling and imprecise. It is said of Style 3, for example, that ". . . its complexion is a retrogression from the plasticity and peerless extensi- bility of Style 4" (p. 6). This publication is also badly marred by numerous typographical errors and/or misspellings. These begin with "diefication" (twice) in the Abstract (p. xi), and six others were casually noted by the time page 36 was reached, on which page an entire line seems to have been lost. At this juncture the enumeration of such sins was abandoned, since it seemed likely that the total would be embarrassingly high. While a reviewer can hardly pass over such short- comings as are mentioned here, it should also be made clear that this study is a positive contribution to our knowledge of North American rock art and that it sug- gests prehistoric connections between Glen Canyon and other regions which should be more carefully and pre- cisely studied in the future.

This is written by a professional writer who has pro- duced numerous books on archaeology, science fiction, and biography. It is divided into six chapters, each de- scribing the archaeological discovery of a given ancient people: Egyptians, Hittites, Harappans, Phoenicians, Etruscans, and Incas. The bibliography consists, as one would expect, of secondary sources. The question one raises is, "Why such a book?" In the first place, there has been a plethora of such books on the market since World War II, and this is among the poorest of them. Secondly, the book is filled with cliches and inaccuracies: "Egypt is a vast treasurehouse of the past"; "The whole civilized world shook at the news that Babylon had fallen"; "The Aryans . . . were rude and barbaric, but not unintelligent. They realized they had much to learn from the older peoples they had conquered.... So the lore of the Harappans passed to the Aryan successors." If the writing were distinguished and not journalistic, much might be overlooked in view of the ever-present need to make known the discoveries of archaeology. There is nothing to recommend this book except the hope it raises that fine writers will someday use this material in the distinguished way it deserves. WALTER A. FAIRSERVIS, JR. University of Washington Seattle, Washington Pueblo Period Sites in the Piedra River Section, Navajo Reservoir District. Assembled by ALFRED E. DrrTERT, JR., AND FRANK W. EDDY. Museum of New Mexico Papers in Anthropology, No. 10, Museum of New Mexico Press, Santa Fe, 1963. 122 pp., appendix, 62 figs., 16 tables. $4.00. This report consists of a brief explanatory chapter and four site reports - the Candelaria site by Frank W. Eddy, the Serrano site by James J. Hester, and the Railroad and Martinez sites, both by James V. Sciscenti, Alfred E. Dittert, Jr., and Beth Dickey. These sites are along the Piedra River in Colorado and were excavated as part of a salvage operation connected with relocation of a railroad and a county road that were within the Navajo Reservoir pool limits. Much of the excavation was accomplished with power equipment. The sites were carefully selected (from the 24 endangered) because each was deemed particularly representative of one or more aspects of the local occupational pattern. In the Navajo Reservoir district, the defined cultural units or periods are the Paleo-Indian, Archaic (3000- 500 B.C.), Pueblo (A.D. 1-1050), and Navajo (A.D. 1550- present). The Pueblo period is divided into five phases: Los Pinos (A.D. 1-400), Sambrito (A.D. 400-700), Rosa (A.D. 700-900), Piedra (A.D. 850-950), and Arboles (A.D. 950-1050). The four excavated sites here reported fall within the Pueblo period (the Navajo period is lightly represented at the Martinez and Railroad sites) but do not include Los Pinos or Sambrito manifestations. The Candelaria site represents a short occupation in- dicated by two isolated structures (a pit house, used both for domestic residence and ceremonial purposes, and a masonry surface-storage structure). The single- unit pueblo site, of which the Candelaria site is repre- sentative, is most typical of the Navajo Reservoir. On the basis of ceramic types (dates determined on the basis of tree-ring dates associated elsewhere), this site is assigned to the early part of the Piedra phase (A.D. 850-900). The Serrano site consists of two groups of superim- posed pit houses and a staggered row of very poorly 357</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY preserved surface-storage units of cobble masonry and jacal (?). Ceramic evidence suggests a short occupation that spanned the Rosa and Piedra phases; several tree- ring counts (only one with the outside ring intact) date the topmost of the four superimposed houses at no ear- lier than A.D. 898. The house second from the bottom is dated at A.D. 885. The Railroad site consists of two pit houses and five surface structures, the latter in an L arrangement (two are of masonry with paved floors, two are ramadas, and one was too poorly preserved to permit classification). This site is considered as transitional between the Piedra and Arboles phases (A.D. 925-975). The Martinez site included three components, Rosa phase, Navajo period, and late Piedra-early Arboles phase (about A.D. 925-1000), but only the last was excavated. This single-unit (?) component contained two superim- posed surface structures. The lower, of jacal construc- tion, was only partially excavated; the upper was a rec- tangular, masonry, storage structure. The sites excavated represent both single and multiple- unit types and, collectively they seem to span the Rosa, Piedra, and Arboles phases of the Pueblo period. Sev- eral general characteristics emerge. Pit houses were resi- dence units, and possibly diminished in size through time. The pit house at the Candeleria site is thought to have had a dual role as residence and ceremonial chamber. Surface structures (some with paved floors) of cobble or sandstone slab-and-mortar masonry were used primarily for storage. Through time, the pit-house residences may have given way to multiroomed surface structures; single- unit sites gave way to multiple-unit sites (the ultimate in this series, the village site, is not represented). The fly in the ointment is that the postulated temporal sequence is based primarily on a postulated ceramic-type sequence, which in turn is based on a network of extra- polated dates, absolute dates, and a ceramic sequence postulated from a general survey of the Navajo Reser- voir. Although one may feel uneasy about the absolute dates ascribed, the general sequence seems accurate enough. Although discrepancies in ceramic associations and sequences are indicated, these are not always ob- vious in site interpretations (see, for example, "Chro- nology" of the Candelaria site, p. 42; compare "Ceramics," p. 59, Table 8, and "Discussion," p. 60, of the Serrano site). It is obvious that this report is a compilation of articles written at different times by different authors. One of the most interesting aspects of Navajo Reser- voir occupation is architecture. The details are too numerous to list, but some features should be noted, such as floor ridges, bifurcated ventilator-tunnel open- ings, four-post roof supports, benches, and a sealed pit in the pit houses. Surface-storage structures at the Ser- rano and Railroad sites are in linear arrangement and include slab or cobble walls. The remarkable similarity of house types and the general site "flavor" to architec- ture and sites in the Virgin River drainage of western Utah suggest an early and wide dispersal of certain architectural traits. Several figures are improperly labeled (see Figs. 6, 35), but in general this report is well done. The Museum of New Mexico and the staff responsible for this report are to be congratulated, particularly in view of the severe time limitation imposed by road construction. FLOYD W. SHARROCK University of Utah Salt Lake City, Utah Sun Father's Way: The Kiva Murals of Kuaua. BERTHA P. DUTTON. The University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque; The School of American Research, Santa Fe; Museum of New Mexico Press, Santa Fe, 1963. Appendix, "Rock Carvings, A Record of Folk History," by AGNES C. SIMS. x + 237 pp., 3 colored pls., 111 photographs, 26 drawings, bibliography, index, and glossary. $15.00. Most anthropologists familiar with the American Southwest are more or less aware of the excavated and now partially reconstructed pueblo ruin on the west bank of the Rio Grande just north of Bernalillo, New Mexico. They know it either by its long-standing name of Kuaua or by its designation, since 1940, as the Coronado State Monument. This important pueblo consisted of two major plazas (and a lesser one) accompanied by some 1200 adobe- walled rooms; there were also six underground kivas, two round and four rectangular. However, the principal fame of Kuaua stems, as the present volume clearly illustrates, from numerous decorated layers of plaster on several kiva walls - primarily those of Kiva III and Kiva VI, both rectangular in form. Five years of excava- tions, beginning in 1934, were conducted at Kuaua under the direction of Edgar Lee Hewett and, initially, under the immediate supervision of Gordon Vivian. During this time, numerous supervisors and others were in- volved, both in the field and in laboratories at the Uni- versity of New Mexico and the Museum of New Mexico. In the present volume, Dutton provides only sufficient background in terms of archaeology and history to give context to her major concern: the analysis and interpre- tation of the remarkable series of figures, deities, humans, and animals, as well as numerous signs and symbols, re- vealed through the meticulous process of separating 25 or more layers of decorated kiva-wall plaster, both from one another and from some 68 interspersed undecorated layers. The brief account of the actual discovery of the murals and their subsequent uncovering and removal is fascinat- ing. It is archaeology in its more dramatic form; at that time, it is well to remember, the techniques were much more of a pioneer venture -adding to the uncertainty, tension, and overall drama. Wall sections, reinforced, isolated, and encased, were taken in blocks weighing up to two tons to the Univer- sity of New Mexico, where the exacting work of separat- ing and preserving the frescoed plaster layers was done. 358 [ VOL. 30, No. 3, 1965</page></plain_text>
