<plain_text><page sequence="1">NEW STUDIES IN THE PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM ABRAHAM CRONBACH, Hebrew Union College I N THIS study, we shall review literature which has appeared since 1929, and which treats various phases of Judaism from the psychological standpoint.1 While this Jewish material will furnish our examples, the theses to be illustrated may prove no less pertinent to other religious affiliations. PART ONE: SURVEY OF THE FIELD That the meanings of words constantly shift and change has become a semantic commonplace. This applies particularly to the word "religion." "Religion," in one context, can bear a sense totally different from that of "religion" in another context. The whirlings of a dervish constitute religion; similarly do the loftiest utterances of Robert Browning. A parental blessing represents religion; so also does an auto da fé. For our present purpose, religion comprises anything to which — whatever the reason — the name "religion" has come to be attached. Debate on the propriety of appending the term "religion" to this, that, or the other manifestation merely exemplifies how the import of the term tends to vary. Our initial step shall be to take caution from a warning issued years ago by William James. James exposed what he called "the psychologist's fallacy."2 We commit the psychologist's fallacy when we confuse the mentation of the investigator with 1 The psychoanalytic material on this subject was synopsized in "The Psychoanalytic Study of Judaism," HUCA, VIII-IX, (1931-32), pp. 605-740. This is the publication called, in the second part of this article, "No. 34." It was necessary to include one publication dated 1928 (our No. 2). ' William James, Psychology, Vol. I, pp. 196, 197, New York, 1899. 205</page><page sequence="2">206 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [2] that of the person investigated. In order to avert that confusion, let us begin by setting forth what is done by the psychological subject. Afterward we shall consider the procedures of the psychological researcher. 1. 1. The Psychological Subject As we survey the activities of the psychological subject, the following arrest our attention : 1. Rituals 7. Controversy 2.2. Doctrines 8. Rationalization 3. Symbolization 9. Factualization 4. Verbalization 10. Social Control 5. Dramatization 11. Beneficence 6. Evaluation 12. Missionarization 13. Religious Art These items, while overlapping at various points, warrant sepa rate enumeration inasmuch as the overlapping is nowhere complete. It is further desirable to guard against their ambigui ties. We can use these terms to designate what people do un reflectively, or we can allow for some measure of self-observation. Ceremonials, as Prof. E. S. Ames puts it, in a letter commenting on this article, "may be symbols to the observer, but to the performer they are just the prescribed and customary activities. So far as they are symbols or symbolic, they are lifted out of their original depth of direct action, and have become modified by the infusion of consciousness." People can act with little or no self-perception, or they cap act with a degree of introspection. They can be unaware of the broader psychological bearings of their activities, just as a sleeper can be unaware of his tossings; or they can possess a measure of self-consciousness, a modicum of reflection, in which case the subject draws nearer the line which separates the subject from the investigator. The charac teristic of the investigator is that of inspecting human mentation with precision, with a reflection that is organized, with attention to details, and with scruple about accurate reporting, whether</page><page sequence="3">[3] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 207 he directs his observation toward others or looks introspectively within himself. The symbolic character of rituals is widely recognized. Less generally understood is the symbolic nature of doctrines. Accept ance of a doctrine can symbolize loyalty to a group. This can be perceptible to an observer even if the devotee himself is unaware of that symbolistic potency. A doctrine can symbolize such loyalty even when the doctrine's content awakens little interest. This obtains in politics no less than in religion. Free trade or protective tariff, armament or disarmament, private enterprise or collectivization can indicate one's group allegiance, though one little understands or cares to understand the proposal itself. The Declaration of Independence still awakens our en thusiasm although a critical reading of that famous document might disclose that its thoughts no longer comport with our thoughts. Doctrines are catchwords as well as programs, perhaps more extensively catchwords than programs. Doctrines resemble not only a map which one traces but also a flag which one waves — perhaps less frequently a map than a flag. Doctrines no less than rituals exhibit a symbolistic propensity. This symbolistic function is akin to that of verbalization. Verbalization denotes the well known human bent for slogans and clichés. The mere sight or sound of a word can evoke certain feelings and actions. Examples are: "That blessed word 'Meso potamia,' " "Glory Hallelujah," "For Thy name's sake," "God is one." Frequently such terms as "Judaism" and "atheism," likewise "Communism," "Fascism," and "Democracy" behave in this manner. Verbalization also accounts for the willingness or the unwillingness of people to regard as "religious" any given activity. To some, the word "religion" appeals and there fore labels that which appeals. To others, the word is hateful and labels only that which the user detests. Another form of symbolization is dramatization. Dramatiza tion occurs when something easily pictured is substituted for something intricate, complex, subtle, far reaching, or too ab stract to comprehend. Hitler dramatized the hostile urges of the German nation. Uncle Sam dramatizes our federal government. Santa Claus dramatizes the gayety and the prodigality marking</page><page sequence="4">208 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [4] the end of the year. "Freedom on her mountain height" drama tizes American ardor for American institutions. Dramatization invests every cartoon.3 Science itself dramatizes. Science does not scruple to credit water with "seeking" the lowest level or the sun with "attract ing" the earth or the white corpuscles with "rushing to the defense" of the organism or a watch spring or a battery with "storing up" power.4 Most striking are the dramatizations of religion. The prev alence of good will in the congregation can be dramatized by the minister's benediction. The supreme seriousness of some of life's concerns can be dramatized by the act of prayer. The redemptive aspects of experience — the moment's of triumph amid life's affliction and adversities — can be dramatized by affirming: "There lives a God!" Recovery from illness, the rain which terminates drought, escape from danger, reconciliation with one's enemies and the like — above all, the change from turbulent to quiet states of mind — imbue the word "God" with its dramatistic force. Such is the import of the word in every psalm and hymn; in "The Lord is my shepherd" (Ps. 23.1), in "Behold the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save" נ The possibility of having one object or situation represent another object or situation becomes obvious every time we anticipate some future event. Our mental images of future situations can be true without being photographic. We can, without error, find our way to a city which we have never before visited although our image of the city, before we arrive, may differ in toto from what we find after we arrive. Is there perhaps some kinship between this and dramatization? And may not people's mental images of God similarly prove useful though, in no way whatsoever, photographic? Drama tization is closely akin to metaphor and still more closely akin to personifica tion. It is surely akin to reification, as expounded by Morris Cohen in Reason and and Nature, New York 1931, pp. 225, 302, 390. Science bristles with reifica tions such as: mind, matter, time, space, force, electricity, magnetism, heat, con sciousness, and the like. Reification means the use of a noun as if some specific thing were under consideration when the reference is not to any specific thing but to a wide and diversified sweep of events, actions, and expectations which are somehow gathered up in the scope of the noun's application. « « Under different terminology, these dramatizations of science provide the theme of a large volume, Die Philosophie des Als Ob by Hanz Vaihinger, Tenth Edition, Leipzig, 1927.</page><page sequence="5">[5] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 209 (Isa. 59.1), and even when "One that was ancient of days did sit : his raiment as white snow and the hair of his head like pure wool" (Dan. 7.9). A world devoid of pain would be a world devoid of God, inasmuch as rescue from pain is the very signif icance of God. Nor can we overestimate, among the afore mentioned states of mind, the potency of hope. The hope for deliverance can be itself a momentous species of deliverance. "Thy will be done" can dramatize mental accommodation and resourcefulness. Our next item is that of evaluation. Evaluation articulates our likes and our dislikes. It is the process of finding things good or bad, right or wrong, beautiful or ugly, agreeable or dis agreeable.5 The God affirmation embraces not only dramatization but also evaluation. Affirming God, besides dramatizing life's deliverances, voices at the same time, our joy and acclaim over those deliverances. Religious dramatizations thus contrast with those of science. From the scientific dramatizations, that in gredient of evaluation is absent. One can evaluate the total universe. The beauties and the sublimities of the cosmos furnish the theme of many a religious outburst. Often evaluation veers toward the phenomenon of evaluation itself. Religious rapture has been stirred not only by "the starry firmament without" but also by "the moral law within." The circumstance that the universe engenders évalua tion of any kind — ethical, esthetic, biological, social — becomes itself evaluated. That change from maladjustment to adjust ment,6 that emergence of good from backgrounds of evil whence ! The science of semantics takes definite cognizance of the difference between the designative force of language and its evaluative force. Ogden and Richards, to indicate the distinction, use the terms "descriptive" and ',emotive." {The Meaning of Meaning, New York and London, 1925, pp. 13, 226-229, 255-260, 263-271, 355-360, 366-373). 6 Although adjustment and maladjustment belong to the vocabulary of science, these terms conceal evaluation. The change from maladjustment to adjustment or vice versa is not a mere relocation of matter in space. Ad justment is always something desired and maladjustment something disliked by the organism and, in a way, by the scientific observer, in behalf of the organism. Nor is it the organism that becomes adjusted to the environment.</page><page sequence="6">[6] 210 ABRAHAM CRONBACH evaluations emanate, can impress one as reality's outstanding trait. On this trait, the purport of the word "God" can feed and grow. Among the objects of evaluation are the activities listed in the present survey. People can evaluate the doctrines, rituals, symbolizations, verbalizations, and all the rest characterizing our psychological subject, sometimes praising and sometimes disparaging. There can further occur evaluation of the work performed by the psychological inquirer — including our present effort. We may like or we may dislike the psychological approach. We may favor or may repudiate any given conclusion. What needs to be stressed is that evaluation is an activity of the psychological subject and not that of the psychological inves tigator. The observation and explanation which we shall près ently assign to the investigator entail not evaluation but scrutiny and testing. The investigator seeks not edification, pleasure, or consolation. The investigator asks: "Is the statement correct?" "Does it meet the empirical test?" "Does it fit the facts?" Evaluation is subjective and individual. The same object or situation can be differently evaluated by different persons. What one person lauds, another disdains. These diversities of evaluation lead to controversy, and when controversy affects anything classified as "religious," we stand amid religious controversy. Out of controversy, grows rationalization. Engaged in con troversy, the individual reaches out for social support. The arguments advanced during controversy aim at winning social support. In these arguments, fidelity to facts is secondary, while the capturing of social support is primary. This subordina Environment undergoes alteration simultaneously. Indeed, it is not always easy to determine where organism ends and where environment begins. We are dealing not with organism and not with environment but'with a synthesis absorbing both. It is this synthesis which, as maladjustment and adjustment, receives evaluation. That adjustment (i. e. the fulfilment of an urge) should lie in one set of events and not in another is perhaps the ultimate mystery. The philosophical discernment that the aspects of the universe apprehended through evaluation are primary and that those apprehended through cognition are ancillary to those apprehended through evaluation can itself call forth evaluation of a deeply religious tenor.</page><page sequence="7">[7] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 211 tion of facts to propaganda is what we mean by rationalization. So vast is the sweep of rationalization that illustration were almost superfluous. "You must not dance because dancing ruins morals." "You had better subscribe to the resurrection of the dead because Hell awaits him who denies the resurrection of the dead." "To worship with uncovered head is to disrespect one's deceased parents who, when they lived, insisted that, during worship, the head be covered." "The minister should wear a gown because that will increase attendance at the services." Such will serve as examples. Rationalization avails itself of the fact that sometimes an untrue statement can be true in part. "I can not attend syna gogue because I have to work every Friday evening and Saturday morning." That the individual works Friday evenings and Saturday mornings may be true, but that this is the reason or the only reason for non-attendance need not be true. "I reject religion because science contradicts the Bible." That science contradicts the Bible is indeed true, but other factors in the life of the individual may bear more vitally upon his rejection of religion than the clash between science and Scripture. Many people continue devoted to religion long after the conflict be tween religion and science has become, with them, a matter of course. Or a statement, though true, may embody untrue implica tions. "Scripture forbids the eating of swine's flesh." That assertion is, of course correct; but the implication need not be correct that the speaker's aversion to certain meat products proceeds from a determination to comply with Holy Writ. What about other scriptural commands to which the speaker may have shown himself indifferent? Again, may not the speaker's dietary habits betray the conditionings of childhood rather than the effects of perusing sacred lore? Still further from correctness lies the implication that, because the dietary prohibition happens to be preserved in the canon, the ordained abstinence is in cumbent upon the listener. In short, the winning of social support, on the one hand, and the stating of facts, on the other, generally prove incompatible; and, in that incompatibility, rationalization has its wellspring.</page><page sequence="8">212 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [8] To single out one particular species of rationalization, we invent the word "factualization." "Factualization" names the tendency to overlook the processes of symbolization, verbaliza tion, dramatization and evaluation and to treat, as statements of fact, statements whose office is not that of reporting facts but that of symbolizing, verbalizing, dramatizing, and evaluating. Let us cite as an example the doctrine of bodily resurrection. The doctrine can dramatize the rebound from frustration. Comfort, hope, and joy do enter human life, and the imagery of bodily resurrection can dramatize those deliverances. That imagery can even avail as part and parcel of those deliverances. It can accompany upsurges of longing and of love. Yet while the doctrine fascinates some people, it repels others. Controversy ensues,' and then the biproduct of con troversy — rationalization. The doctrine of bodily resurrection which functioned as a dramatization, a symbolization, and an evaluation becomes, in the course of rationalization, tested as something different, namely, as the report of a fact. One side "proves" bodily resurrection to be impossible, and the other side answers with a rebuttal. Both sides factualize. Both sides manipulate, as a piece of information, something which was previously not information but dramatization, symbolization, and evaluation but which has become overwhelmed by that precipitate of strife -— rationalization. We call to mind the huge array of argument to prove that "God is one." "God is one" provides stimulating verbalization — until it provokes controversy, rationalization, and factualization. We may wonder whether Maimonides' dissatisfaction with the proposition that God is one,7 after he has labored so assiduously to "prove" that God is one, may not, in some way, link with a suspicion that, whatever one "proves" in this domain, one proves the irrelevant.8 ' Moreh Nebukim I, 58. Pp. 82, 83 in M. Friedlander, Guide for the Per plexedplexed of Moses Maimonides, London, 1904. Mairaonides, permitting the ascription not of positive but only of negative attributes to the Deity, main tains that God is one only in the sense that He is not many. 8 No one would ever have found occasion to coin the notorious credo quia absurdum had it been realized that doctrines, though defective as pieces of</page><page sequence="9">[9] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 213 A species of factualization comes to light in discussions regarding prayer. People pray because they wish to pray. Why any given individual, at any given time or place, should wish to pray offers a legitimate topic of psychological inquiry. Prior to such inquiry, all that can be alleged with certainty is that the individual desires to pray and does so; just as one studies science because one desires to or visits an art gallery or hears a symphony or chooses an occupation because one desires such. However, in a diversified society, those arise who find prayer objectionable. Why any given individual should deem prayer objectionable is again a problem in psychology, pending a solu tion of which all that can be maintained with confidence is that such and such people oppose prayer. Meanwhile, there unfolds the customary pattern —- controversy, rationalization, factuali zation. For both sides, the rationalization pivots on the question whether or not prayer is efficacious, as if people waited with their praying until efficacy is assured or discontinued praying after lack of efficacy had become demonstrated. One side seeks to show that prayers are futile, while the other strives to estab lish the opposite. Both sides overlook that people pray not because they have discovered prayer to be efficacious but for other reasons. People pray because prayer fulfills some kind of need. What kind of need, let the psychologist ascertain. Obvi ously it is a kind of need that must be satisfied by means of dramatization and evaluation. The debate concerning efficacy yields another example of factualization. Factualization perpetuates the warfare between science and religion. So varied are the meanings of the word "religion" that conflict may well flare up not only between science and religion but between anything whatsoever and religion. Life has its deliverances — deliverances from bitterest woe. Both in the moment of need and in the moment of rescue, we exclaim: "God!" Someone■—for reasons that a psychologist may ex hume hume — protests against our exclaiming "God!" Thence the controversy, thence the rationalization, thence the factualiza information, can be well suited to the purooses of symbolization, dramatiza tion, and evaluation.</page><page sequence="10">214 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [10] tion, and thence the collision with science. The remark that science jeopardizes religion holds true only in the sense that when, for reasons which have little if anything to do with science, the God affirmation loses its dramatistic and evaluative power, the persons affected discard the God affirmation and then pro ceed to rationalize their dissent. In some circles it is customary, for purposes of such rationalization, to quote science. God is "proved" to be contrary to fact, just as, in other circles, men arraign religion as "the opiate of the masses."9 It is overlooked that religion encounters antagonism from people who possess little knowledge of science or little interest in science while, on the other hand, there are those who cherish both religion and science — sometimes even at the cost of rationalizations claiming to "reconcile" the two. The bald assertion that science under mines religion is psychologically erroneous. All that science does is to supply the rationalizations for anti-religious attitudes bred by a different set of circumstances. Factualization will further account for theology. Theology ignores the symbolistic, verbalistic, dramatistic, and evaluative character of religious formulations and handles them as if they were informational. The issue thereupon arises whether the proffered information is correct. Contradictions emerge that clamor for harmonization. Libraries of disquisition accumulate. From all of this, the simple unsophisticated worshiper stands remote. As long as one worships, one does not dispute, and in the absence of dispute, little occasion develops for rationaliza tion. That the purport of the word "God" in a devotional con text differs decidedly from its purport in a theological context hardly admits of question.10 « Whether the statement about the opiate of the masses is true no one has ever inquired, nor need anyone inquire. Information is not the purpose of the statement. The statement belongs to the horde of the world's ration alizations. 10 The misgiving about the personality of God is a further upshot of factualization. Through association with felicitous relationships among human beings, personality is a term that evaluates and dramatizes. The questioner's real concern is whether experience actually elicits such evaluation and drama tization. The answer "Yes" is supported not only by the fact that people</page><page sequence="11">[11] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 215 Factualization will also explain the religious stressing of belief — belief not in the biblical sense of loyalty (Gen. 15.6, Isa. 7.9) but in the distinctly variant sense of judging a given proposition to be informationally valid. The history of religion exhibits the spectacle of compulsory assent to various theological pronouncements. Doctrines, as we have already noted, can symbolize group attachment. The challengers of doctrines thus become rebels against the group. Enmeshed in contention, chal lengers and defenders alike resort to rationalization, including the special kind of rationalization which we have called fac tualization. Steadfastness to the group requires that one fac tualize in the manner of the group defenders. To believe is to accept, as correct statements of fact, whatever the group de fenders assert to be correct statements of fact in the course of their defensive rationalizations. In conclusion, we must criticize the assumption upon which all factualization rests. This is the assumption that the need for information is man's only need or man's dominant need. Factualization forgets the pressing needs fulfilled by symboliza tion, verbalization, dramatization, and evaluation. It overlooks that our desire for facts is a comparatively feeble desire. People evince solicitude for facts chiefly in matters pertaining to their occupations. Outside of those occupations, facts exert a relatively scant appeal. There is not a popular publication on any subject or a popular presentation of any kind which, fails to illustrate how the need for facts recedes before the need for entertainment, thrills, inspiration, or consolation. The preconception that a religious statement is necessarily discredited if it falls short of conveying facts and necessarily potent if it does convey facts is itself out of line with facts. Where men crave stimulation, sustenance, and comfort, factual correctness is not always an asset nor is factual incorrectness always a liability. No drawback mars a Shakespearian drama long to affirm the Divine personality but also by the questioner's own solic itude in the matter. When the word "personality" is used not dramatist ically or evaluatively but designatively, the essential point is missed. There is also, by the way, collision with the Jewish compunction about anthropo morphism.</page><page sequence="12">216 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [12] if it condones many a deviation from historical or biological accuracy, nor does defect beset an art gallery which displays a painting of a cherub or an angel or a demon, nor is it a blemish in an oratorio simulating a thunderstorm if some of its musical strains disregard meteorology. How fragile then the notion that, in the sphere of religion, a statement is misleading if it errs as regards facts or that it is compelling if it offers solid information! Yet such is the supposition underlying factualization whether practiced by religion's defenders or by its assailants.. The next item on our list is social control. The social controls exercized by religion are familiar. We need only supplement that these controls utilize not only doctrines, rituals, and evalu ations and, of course, institutions (which fall outside of our present theme) but also dramatizations. An example is the stern and punitive God or the worm that never dieth or the fire that is not quenched (Isa. 66.24, Mark 9.48). Similarly the beneficence attending religion, in some of its phases, foliates not only into acts and idéals of charity and social welfare and not only into deeds and teachings of kindliness and forbearance but also into the dramatizations of God as the Heavenly Father, the Shepherd Who tendeth His flock, the Savior, the Helper, the Redeemer, the Friend. We might add, to the instances of dramatized beneficence, the vision of a blissful hereafter which is to guerdon life's toils." Conspicuous as a token of beneficence is intercessory prayer. Devout prayer in behalf of another unequivocally manifests love. As for missionarization, this takes place, in a way, whenever rationalizations are adduced to convert the listener to the view of the speaker. We must nonetheless allow for deliberate, avowed, and systematic endeavors at persuading individuals to abandon one allegiance or set of ideas and to substitute another. We employ the word "missionarization" rather than "proselytism" because the former encompasses not only the movement from " This must not be confused with the role of that doctrine in psychical research or in philosophical discussions about the life to come. The question of a hereafter can be subjected to factual scientific study like the question of the canals on Mars. But such inquiry must be sharply differentiated from the use of the idea in religious edification and devotion.</page><page sequence="13">[13] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 217 one group to another but also the creation or the revival of loyalty within the group to which the prospect already be longs." Finally, we consider religious art, such as sculpture, painting, music, poetry, pageantry, architecture, and esthetic ritual. Moments of artistic exaltation can figure among the moments of precious serenity that shine amid life's encircling gloom. How prominent that quality among the ways in which art ministers to religion ! May not art also reside in the aforementioned dramatizations? Then would those hallowed dramatizations of life's deliverances themselves amount to deliverances. And may not art further include human beneficence — an art of human relationships? "The beauty of holiness" would then constitute beauty in a literal sense. II.II. The Investigator Having concerned ourselves with the activities of the psycholog ical subject, participant, or agent, let us now look at those of the investigator. These can be divided into 1.) Observation and 2). Explanation.13 To discern some of the phenomena listed above demands little acumen. Rituals, doctrines, controversy, social control, missionarization, and religious art count as every day events. More searching is the scrutiny required to detect verbalization, dramatization, evaluation, rationalization, factualization and " Among Jews, conversion usually denotes changing from one religious affiliation to another. Among Christians, the word more commonly refers to loyalty within the group itself. Psychologically, missionarizing seems modeled upon the transactions of commerce and seems to promise a quid pro pro quo. The missionary achieves an accession to his group and the kudos of having acquired the accession. The convert gains the friendship of the missionarizing individual or association and, in addition, the emotional sat isfactions conferred by the group symbols. ני Between observation and explanation, there is no sharp line of demarca tion. Observation is but the initial stage of a process whereof explanation is the later stage. This has been treated by John Dewy in Logic, The Theory of Inquiry, New York, 1938. See "Observation" in index.</page><page sequence="14">218 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [14] the symbolistic capacity of doctrines. Both types, for our present purpose, occupy the area of observation. Explanation appears in much that has already been presented. Without some explanation, it proved impossible to expound dramatization, evaluation, rationalization, and factualization. Explanation entails the discovery of wider phenomena whereof the matter observed is but a phase, the wider being the more frequent and hence the more readily understood and controlled. Thus symbolization, together with its sub-forms, verbalization and dramatization, can be explained as specimens of association of ideas. The association involves, of course, not only ideas but also the affective states fused with ideas. The various urges or drives envisaged in modern psychology must also be taken into account, especially if we would comprehend evaluation and the several derivatives of evaluation. The psychology of religion differs from psychology in general only as regards the situations pondered. It is merely that province of psychology which focuses attention on situations for which the term "religious" chapces to be the appellative. We are, for instance, acquainted with the urge of the Ego. The Ego urge obtrudes itself in the desire for approbation, in the pleasure at being admired, in the chagrin at being dis paraged, and in the exasperation at being ignored or disdained. Undoubtedly this urge haunts religion. It surely animates our evaluations. It instigates perhaps all of our controversies. Its buffetings intensify the dark background of the experiences which project the affirmation of God. Its resentments generate the doctrines of Divine punishment and other harsh forms of religio-social control. Nor is the world of religion void of the aggressiveness born of frustration nor of displaced aggressiveness as elucidated by some noted authorities.14 14 Frustration and Aggression by John Dollard and others, published for the Institute of Human Relations by Yale University Press, New Haven, 1939. See also Smiley Blanton and Margaret Blanton, For Stutterers, D. Appleton-Century Co., 1936, p. 54. Perhaps we should mention in this context the phenomenon of wishful thinking so widely prevalent in human affairs. The Yiddisch writer, Sholom Aleichem, tells of an aged Rabbi who, while the</page><page sequence="15">[15] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 219 Alongside of the urge of the Ego, our psyché harbors the urge to cooperate.15 This proclivity ramifies into good will, helpfulness, and love. We glimpsed the cooperative urge when we dwelt upon the religious role of beneficence and recalled not only acts of charity and social welfare but also the delineation of God as a Father, a Friend, a Savior, a Helper. We commented on the beneficence which prompts intercessory prayer and which wel comes allusions to a felicitous hereafter. Cooperation can be so gratifying as to elicit superlative evaluations: "The greatest of these is love," "Thy love it is my heart desires." In that mingling of adversity and triumph which inspires the devotional import of the word "God," the triumph of blessed human relationships can rank supreme. The realization that "God is love" can tower as the greatest of all discoveries. Among the drives governing human affairs is that of sex. Does sex reappear in religion? We must remind ourselves that we are now not evaluating but explaining. Whether the sexual ingredient exalts religion or degrades it, the investigator does not ask. Sex, like everything else in the world, is adjudged noble by some and ignoble by others. For the investigator, the question shapes itself merely: "Does or does not sex account for any religious manifestations?" Weighty reasons exist for an affirma tive answer. We need think only of circumcision or of the rites of puberty or marriage or of the Book of Canticles. In certain hymns, the element of sex wears but a thin disguise.16 Wherever supplications or rituals, amid strong accessions of feeling,' ac centuate submission and self-subordination, reactions akin to those of sex can reasonably be surmised. town was ablaze, felt certain that God would not permit the fire to reach the holy synagogue and the sacred scrolls. A few minutes later, the synagogue went up in flames. (Kasrielevker Nisrofim, in Aile Werk Vun Sholom Aleichem, New York, 1919, Vol. 13, pp. 22, 23). '5 The counterpoise to the Darwinian teaching about the struggle for existence appears in such literature as Drummond's Ascent of Man (1894), John Fiske's Through Nature to God (1899), Peter Kropotkin's Mutual Aid as as a Factor in Evolution (1915), and Nasmyth's Social Progress and the Darwin ianian Theory (1916). 16 Examples are: "Blessed submission, Jesus is mine, O what a foretaste of rapture Divine," "Leaning on my Savior's breast," and the like.</page><page sequence="16">[16] 220 ABRAHAM CRONBACH The urge of the Ego, the urge to cooperate, and the sex urge represent ordinary psychological happenings. But the psychology of religion does not restrict itself to the ordinary. It also invokes "depth psychology," chiefly psychoanalysis. We procure an example of depth psychology in the thesis that the responses of infancy and early childhood sometimes continue, little transmuted, into adult life. The attitude of the devout toward the Heavenly Father has impressed some psy chologists as the persistence of the child's attitude toward its parents, with its trust, its reliance, and its sense of security. These feelings of trust, reliance, and security, sunk in the matrix of life's tragedies and difficulties, nourish the devotional (as distinguished from the theological) meaning of the word "God." Unmistakable strands of child-parent attachment can further be traced in the Jewish punctiliousness about reciting the Kaddish as also in the wide spread inclination to adhere to rituals which one's parents were wont to emphasize. Conformity in religion is conjectured to stem from habits of filial affection, while tensions between parent and child are suspected of predisposing to non conformity, neologism, and protest. As differentiated from the rationalizations, the real reasons for a person's acceptance or rejection of a given doctrine can lurk in the pleasantness or the unpleasantness of the human contacts associated with that doctrine — which holds likewise of rituals, verbalizations, dramatizations, and, more or less, the entire remainder of our list. Subtler penchants such as that of masochism or of the Oedipus complex have also been imputed to the religious domain. That self-punitive impulsions of a masochistic hue break forth in many forms of penance such as fasting, flagellation, isolation and perhaps even in the tedium of lengthy religious services will hardly sound incredible.17 Nor does the list of explanatory factors omit reference to 17 On the incidence of the Oedipus complex in religion, The Psychological Bulletin,Bulletin, Dec. 1926, p. 701; Dec. 1928, p. 701; May 1933, p. 327.

Exponents of the inferiority complex would probably ascribe to its workings some well known religious pretensions, conten tions, and dissentions which a different school of psychology would ascribe to the aggression fathered by frustration. To the psychology of religion, everything which emancipates the individual from anxiety and conflict can be classed as ger mane. We need not countenance the facile formula that religion consoles or that it edifies. Religion does not console and does not edify. What happens is that countless forces —- biological, social, psychological — encircle and interpenetrate the individual in such manner that consolation or edification is the outcome. Religion is not the cause but the consequence. The causes lie diffused throughout the universe, a universe of endless malad justment and adjustment, of victory amid defeat. Such of these factors as impinge directly or almost directly upon the individual furnish the data for religio-psychological study. We must conclude, as we began, with caution against con fusing the psychological subject and the psychological investiga tor. No one mistakes the act of eating for research in dietetics, even though dietitians, like the rest of us, eat in order to survive. The domain of psychology is less fortunate. Confusions here are incessant and disturbing. Objection, for example, will be raised to what has been said about dramatization. It will be insisted that the worshiper testifies: "God is my Heavenly Father." He does not profess: "By affirming the Fatherhood of God, I dramatize and evaluate the salutary features of an otherwise forbidding experience." Of course, the worshiper does not thus express himself, any more 18 Theodor Reik, "Dogma und Zwangsidee," Imago 1927, 13, 247-382 and "Endphasen des Religioesen und des Zwangneurotischen Glaubens," Imago, 1930, 23-38.</page><page sequence="18">[18] 222 ABRAHAM CRONBACH than a sucking infant announces: "I am now ingesting vitamins." Grasping the complexities of dramatization is the work of the psychological researcher, not that of the psychological subject. Dramatization which is what the psychological subject performs is what the psychological investigator observes and explains. Performing is one thing. The study of the performance is a totally different thing. The religious dramatizations mentioned here must, of course, be distinguished from the dramatizations of science treated supra supra p. 208. It will be recalled that the difference lies not only in the happenings dramatized but also in the merger with evaluation — absent from the scientific, present in the religious. Sometimes the confusion moves in reverse. Not only is the dramatizer mistaken for an investigator; the investigator often misunderstands himself and is misunderstood by others to be an evaluator. Thus the investigator may have to face the charge of attacking theology when he alleges that theology subsists on factualization or when he records that the meaning of "God" in disputation is not identical with the word's meaning in prayer. The truth is that any psychologist who fashions a statement either with deprecatory intent or with laudatory intent falls, ipso ipso facto, out of the role of investigator and into that of the psychological subject. Investigation consists of fact finding and fact interpreting, and these are not the same as praising or condemning. We have adverted to the qualms surrounding sex. Some writers expound the sexual side of religion in a trans parently anti-religious manner.15 Plainly, these writers have, for the time being, transformed themselves into subjects of psychological research and have ceased, for the time being, to render observation and explanation. The process of observing and explaining is not the process of divulging one's likes or one's dislikes. Concerning the literature which we are now to examine, we 19 Examples are: H. C.

For those facts, what are the attempted interpretations? Does this literature cling to observation and explanation or does it, like other literature on the psychology of religion, divagate into the activities of the psychological subject? PART TWO: SURVEY OF THE LITERATURE We place in the appendix to this article (p. 271) the list of writings covered in this survey. Each publication is there as signed a number by which, for the sake of convenience, it is to be designated throughout this inquiry. Distinctly the greater part of this literature chances to be the product of authors whose approach is that of psychoanalysis; while, within these psychoanalytic presentations, the Oedipus complex, which figured so conspicuously in our earlier study, again plays the dominant role.20 Resolved into its components, the Oedipus complex includes : 1. The sexual longing of the son for the mother. 2. The attendant hostility of the son toward the father. 3. The reciprocal hostility of the father toward the son. 4. Reconciliation between father and son. We take up each of these elements in turn and record the use to which each is put by our writers in the treatment of various Jewish legends, beliefs, and rituals. Our undertaking, at this stage, is purely that of reporting. Later we shall raise the ques tion of our own assent or objection. I.

The same writer maintains that, by sublima tion, the sexual interest in the mother goddess became diffused over the entire land.41 Another one of our writers reports that modern scholars construe Cant. 2.9 ff. as a dialogue between a mother goddess and her son-consort.44 The tabernacle into which the priest would enter and from which he would emerge is declared to picture, in some way, the maternal body.43 The mother is also found represented by such ritual objects as the much kissed phylacteries.44 Again, the mother is discerned in the triad — father, mother, child — contrived by the three-pronged finger arrangement of the Kohenites.43 The spread of the fingers before the eyes is held to suggest the hide and seek which a mother plays with her child.46 נ« No. 31, P- 56. » No. 31, p. 57. 40 No. 31, p. 64. 41 No. 31, pp. 25, 52, 64. 44 No. 10, p. 310.

A birth significance is seen in the detachment of the fruit from the tree of Paradise;47 a child, we again recall, being the "fruit" of the womb. A similar implication is attributed to the expulsion from Eden.48 We are also told that birth is symbolized by the passage of the flame between the pieces in the Abrahamic covenant49 of Gen. 15 and by the opening of and passing through various doors.50 Trumbull's Threshold Covenant, p. 13, is quoted for its association of the threshold with that part of the mother's body through which the child enters the world.51 This, in turn, comports with the psychoanalytic identification of room and womb.52 The Hebrew Dalet, like the triangular Greek delta, not only means door but also implies, according to this writer, the female pudendum.55 The Ashera, with its voulptuous accompani ments, is declared to have been originally a pair of posts sur mounted, door fashion, by a lintel.54 Attention is directed to the importance of thresholds in the ancient Canaanitish custom of sacrificing children at the thresh olds or at the laying of foundations or in choosing the door of the tent of meeting as the place for burnt offerings.55 With the threshold is likewise associated circumcision. Our writer suspects a parallel between the sacrifice at the threshold of the sanctuary and circumcision as a sacrifice at the threshold of life and, akin to that, the sacrifice of the Egyptian first born.56 Another of our writers reminds us that there was blood on the doorways of Egypt when the Israelites "went forth."57 "As Moses was saved by his circumcision, so was Israel saved, when the Egyptian «'«' No. 27, p.

One of our authors agrees with Levy, in Imago V, 19, that the original sin is coitus and that the source of death,62 according to that story, is carnality. A sex symbol is the serpent crawling on his stomach and eating dust.63 The serpent of brass in the ancient Temple is asserted to have been originally a god of fertility.64 Apples also, as in Cant. 2.5, betoken carnal longing;65 likewise the tree.66 The tree of life, guarded by a serpent, brings to mind the myths which tell of a treasure or a beautiful woman guarded by a dragon. Eve — again recalling that Ilawwah means ser pent — is identified, by this writer, with the serpent, with the "apple," and with the tree.67 This writer quotes Trumbull's Threshold Threshold Covenant to the effect that, when the story of Paradise was originally composed, the sexual intimations of tree, fruit, and serpent were still familiar.68 The eating of the forbidden fruit implies, to this writer, a harking back to the infant's sucking of its mother's breast — by no means, according to psycho analysis, an "innocent" and sexless activity.69 5858 No. 31, p. 62. s' No. 31, p. 64. 60 No. 31, p. 60. 41 Ibid. 62 No. 26, p. 22.

Something similar is imputed to Gideon with whom the urge to violate his mother comes to light when, in Jud. 6.28, he strikes down the Ashera.72 Also vested with sexual reminders is the goat73 in Lev. 16; Azazel, the hairy, suggests the pubes.u It is pointed out that Azazel became identified with one of the fallen angels who courted the earthly women in Gen. 6.2. Our writer holds that the sin for which the goat was to atone was that of the libido. Adduced in evidence of this are the chapters on sex taboos which closely follow upon the chapter in which Azazel is mentioned.75 This writer detects a similar import in the red string fastened to the goat's horns (Yoma IV,2), red being the color of sin, especially that of lasciviousness.76 He claims that the sins to be expiated by means of the scapegoat are sins of sex also according to Yoma VI, 4 and according to Rashi on Yoma 39A.77 The cock, as Kapparah fowl, by which the goat was superseded,78 is reported to figure as a sex symbol in the dreams of neurotics and, in various parts of the world, to signify the procreating male.79 ל°ל° No. 15, p. 310• יל No. 31, P• 56. 71 No. 27, p. 199. 3ל No. 24, p. 339. ל" No. 24, p. 341. 75 The author might also have cited the sex regulations in Chap. 15 which immediately precedes that in which Azazel is mentioned; as well as the sex taboos in Chap. 18 which follows the chapter containing reference to the Se'trim Se'trim (Lev. 17.17). 6ל No. 24, p. 342. 77 Rashi, in Yoma 39A, quotes Isa. 1.18 which links sin with the color red.

Also freighted with sexual implications are such ritual ob jects as prayer shawl and phylacteries.83 We are assured that these have borne a sexual significance in the dreams and phanta sies of psychiatric patients. It is recalled that Hos. 2.22, in connection with the phylacteries, involves the word "know" with its familar sexual connotations.84 A genital meaning is also perceived in the three-fold winding of the phylacteries and in the bride's three-fold circumambula tion of the groom at weddings, as well as in the three-pronged finger spread of the Kohenites.8s Feldman quotes Zoller's "Alphabetstudien" to the effect that the letter ש, simulated by the Kohenites, signifies not only tooth but also organ of sex.86 In connection with the priestly blessing no less than in connec tion with the phylacteries, considerable discussion is bestowed 80 No. 4, p. 117. 81 On the sexual significance of the myrtle, something is said by Lauter bach, HUCA, 1940, p. 397. 83 There are recorded, on Ber. 56B, still other dreams with sexual inter pretations. The dream, Ber. 56B (line 17), about removing a shell from an egg, is not interpreted sexually as our No. 4 supposes. Ber. 56B does not men , tion any dream about a falling branch as our No. 4, p. 118 claims. The writer appears to have mistranslated the passage in Ber. 56B, (lines 15 and 16,) about the shadows, one above and one beneath the dreamer.

Among other things, it is noted that, in some circles, the finger serves to convey jocular sexual allusions.87 Apropos the Kohenitic removal of the shoes, our author tells of a patient who was obsessed with the impulsion to polish the shoes of his father.88 In this case, analysis showed "a con densed expression" of the longing for the sexual possession of the mother. This writer insists that the shoe sometimes betokens the male organ of sex and sometimes that of the female — a conclusion which he sees confirmed by the clinical findings in the case of a patient whose phobia related to putting on shoes and going into the street. The command not to look at the func tioning Kohenites is connected, by this author, with the inhibi tion about peering at the coitus of one's parents, lest the mother become the object of incestuous desire.89 Our author under stands the priestly blessing to express the demand that the incestuous yearnings for one's mother be abjured.90 The purport is that the blessing reaches only him who forsakes the incestuous deed figuring in the primeval sin.91 II.II. The Son's Hostility Toward the Father Alongside of the son's incestuous desire for his mother, the Oedipus complex includes the hostility of the son toward his father. Much of our material follows the Freudian supposition that, in some primitive horde, the sons murdered the father in order to obtain access to the women, and then cannibalistically devoured the father, expecting thus to absorb into themselves his admired and dreaded prowess.92 The hostility of the sOn toward his parent is reported not merely as a phenomenon of the clinic.

As in other myths in which the hero must combat a serpent or a dragon before he obtains the beautiful maiden," Adam has to resist Yahweh, the serpent-shaped god of fertility, to win the right to the apple, to the tree, to fertility, to Eve.100 The story of Paradise is thus construed to mean that, as in various non Hebraic myths, Yahweh is the father and Adam the son, that disobedience to the father appears in sexual maturation and desire,101 and that the son's uprising against the father consti tutes the Fall of Man.104 Referring to the serpent of Paradise, the fish of Jonah, the Leviathan of the Jewish hereafter, and the fish of the Sabbath dietary, Roheim connects these dragon myths with the aggressions and anxieties attendant upon the relationship between the infant and its mother.103 Hostility of the son toward the father is discovered also in the story,of Cain and Abel.104 Abel whom Cain slew is, in psycho ני No. 14, p. 213. יי No. 26, p. 25. ני No. 26, p. 23. זי זי Supra, p. 224. 8י No. 26, p. 26. יי No. 27, p. 180. 100 No. 27, p. 195. 101 No. 27, p. 177. 102102 No. 27, p. 197. נ" No. 28, p. 40.

The same insurgent tendency, characterizing the Jews as a group,105 if not mankind as a whole, is descried by Isaac-Edersheim in the story of the Tower of Babel.106 It is maintained, by another of our writers, that the Berit ben Habetarim, in Gen. 15, portrays the neurotic dread of being torn to pieces or eviscerated "as the talion repre sentation of the subject's own destructive desires."107 In No. 12, pp. 64, 160, 161, Freud advances the thesis that the primeval slaying of the father was repeated in the slaying of Moses. For the supposition that Moses was murdered, Freud claims support in the researches of Sellin and in the intuitions of Goethe. According to Roheim, "the opener of the womb" in Exod. 13 and elsewhere is one who is predisposed to kill his father and to commit incest.108 A similar import is traced by Isaac-Edersheim in the prophetic denunciation of the Jews as stiff-necked.109 Rebellion of the son against the father is, according to one of our authors, presupposed in the law, Ex. 20.22 and Deut. 27.5, against the use of an iron implement in the construction of the altar. This author interprets recourse to such implement as detracting from the glory of the father by indicating easy access to the earth-material, that is, to the mother.110 Isaac-Edersheim, like various earlier writers of the psychoanalytic group, attaches a similar implication to the practice of offering sacrifices."1 This writer adopts the theory that the meal which followed the sacrifice of the totem animal simulated the primitive devouring of the father, just as the sacrifice itself furnished a replica of the murder.1" Roheim, also echoing Freud, regards the slaughter, of the bull or ram as a repetition of the patricide and simul taneously its expiation."5 Feldman, assigning an analogous im "s No. 14, p. 211. 106 No. 14, p. 205. 10ל No. 25, p. 456. 108 No. 10, p. 302. 10» No. 14, p. 211. 110 No. 31, p. 56.

"Nomen est omen.""5 According to Isaac-Edersheim, the uprising of the son against his sire and of man against God is typified by the Messiah. This writer holds that the act of annointing derives from the notion that one absorbs the power of the totem by taking, into ,or upon one's body, some part of the totem's body — in this instance, a touch of its fat;116 the totem being meanwhile identified with the deity who is, in turn, identified with one's father."7 Anointing thus signifies the rebellious' and aggressive appro priation of the father-deity's prerogatives. The Messiah, the anointed, usurps the Deity's place. The Messiah impersonates, in addition, says Feldman, the first born, "the opener of the womb" who, when it came to doing away with the father, "must have been the ringleader.""8 This view is favored also by Isaac-Edersheim."5 Isaac-Edersheim regards the Messiah as the duplicate of the son who initiated the insurrection against the totem, against the father, against the god; somewhat like Siegfried who bathes in the blood of the dragon which he slew or like Achilles who becomes invulnerable by immersion in a sacred fountain. The son who eliminates the father is thus a familiar mythological figure.120 Variously dis guised, he appears in stories such as those of Zeus, Osiris, Oedipus, Parsifal.

Feldman, endorsing Reik, maintains that the Aaron ide benediction, like the scene at Mt. Sinai, which these writers assume it repeats, signalizes the repression of the urge to hate the father and to kill him.123 The handwashing of the Aaronides, pronounced akin to the handwashing which accompanies neurotic obsessions,124 is held to symbolize the wish to become free of patricidal desires.125 The same applies to the Kohenitic abstinence from wine, just prior to functioning, wine betokening blood, hence the blood of the slain parent.126 Concerning the rule inhibit ing the Kohenites from stepping on the threshold, Roheim joins Reik in the theory that stepping on the threshold betrays hostility toward the occupant of the abode.127 Bearing in mind that, by certain displacements, the Kohenites become God Himself, the prohibition about looking at the Kohenites links with the thought that to look at someone means to overpower him.128 The forming of the Divine Name by means of the fingers is a further step in the process of abandoning the use of the Divine Name altogether, with all the domination over the name's bearer that such use implies.129 It is even suggested that "the tune in the blessing might be a reminiscence of the last growling of the 'Urvater.'

Feldman seconds the views of Abraham, of Reik, and of Langer that, by means of the phylacteries, the worshipers identify themselves with the primeval totem animal which is, in turn, the replica of the slain parent.131 Feldman maintains that the swaying in prayer, while wearing phylacteries and prayer shawl, simulated the totem in a manner analogous to the imita "נ No. 10, p. 311.

Though conceding that Ahasuerus may be a personification like Uncle Sam, John Bull, and the like, Isaac Edersheim insists, nonetheless, that the subject is highly com plicated.137 This author sees, in the Wandering Jew, a displace ment of the feelings of hate and aggression directed by the Jews against their God.138 In Ahasuerus, the Jewish Father-God, re jected by His children, goes wandering like Cain, the eternal rebel and murderer.13' Isaac-Edersheim is impressed by the demonstrations of hostil ity toward the father in the legends of the Golem. The Golem, according to this author, divulges a mediaeval Jewish antipathy to the Most High.140 The Golem signifies belligerence against God on the part of R. Loew and thus on the part of the entire Jewish community for which R. Loew is spokesman. R. Loew is asserted by Isaac-Edersheim to exemplify the urge to stand on a level with God by performing an act of créa 132 No. 10, p. 311. 133 No. 10, p. 318. 133 No. 7, p. 486. 133 No. 4, p. 118. 136 No. 24, p. 343, No. 34, pp. 675, 686, 698. 133 No. 15, p. 304. 138 No. 15, p. 314. 13' No. 15, p. 315.

Loew resemble the elements which compose man according to the interpretation of Ps. 139.16 in San. 38AB and according to Pirke de R. Eliezer, XI.143 The Golem is the servant of R. Loew as Adam, Abraham, Moses, Job, and the prophets were servants of the Deity.144 Again the Golem, in some respects, becomes identified with R. Loew himself. The Golem is the material man as R. Loew is the spiritual man.145 The Golem is, in other words, R. Loew's own split-off personality and the eject of R. Loew's repressed wishes.146 In this aspect, the Golem resembles the gigantic Adam described in IJag. 12A (lines 4, 8) and in San. 38B (lines 18, 20), the Golem returning, like Adam, to its natal earth.147 This gigantic Adam was originally endowed with supernatural powers which he lost because of his contumacy. It is hinted that R. Loew's status was similar. The Golem, violating the Sabbath, becomes the projection of R. Loew's own concealed rebellious ness, while the Golem's attack on the Jews betrays R. Loew's covert enmity toward his own people.148 Along with all of this, our author finds that the Golem stands for God.14' God Himself is ridiculed and degraded in the Golem's clumsiness, dulness, and servility.

One of our writers suspects that "even within the older Jewish communities, before the day of the modern Rabbi, there was sufficient proof of the readiness of the congregant to choose for leadership the man who would not be too well invested with uncontrollable author ity"ity" — a reminiscence explained by this writer as an Oedipus involvement.151 Filial animosity is spied also in the antagonism leveled at its minister by the modern Reform congregation.153 The writer instances the resentment felt because the Rabbi calls for discipline. Some parishioners suffer, in the religious leader, a reminder of their Orthodox and poverty stricken childhood the memory of which they desire to escape.153 This author adds that the waning of the father image from the popular idea of God increases this resistance. The writer then refers to a certain Rabbi who, because of his abhorrence for his father, proved unable to carry on his work.154 III. The Father's Hostility Toward the Son Among the tokens of the father's antagonism toward the son, one of our writers places the prohibition against eating the Paradisial fruit. This he construes as a paternal act of restric tion,155 displayed likewise in the role of the serpent.156 By casting its skin, the serpent ac'hieves self-rejuvenation, a quality which one's mother lacks; she grows older and not younger and may therefore not become one's wife. Another one of our authors glimpses the restraining punitive father in the prayer shawl and the phylacteries;157 while another perceives him in the lameness came to him in retribution not for the censure but for that censure in addition to the act of prostrating himself by way of illustrating how one prostrates oneself in prayer.

CASTRATION Extensively does this literature recognize symbols of castration, the barrier reared by the older generation against the incestuous proclivities of the younger. Approval is accorded Reik's view, in "Das Kainzeichen" (Imago V, 41), that circumcision is castra tion in an attenuated form.161 To Westermark's critique of these suppositions, Roheim rejoins that circumcision arises when the latent tendency to castrate is counteracted by tendencies of an opposite nature.162 As confirmation, Roheim cites the castration anxieties which, he says, accompany all ceremonies of initia tion.165 Roheim reports that, among the Pitjentara, both initiates and participants tend to dream, prior to the initiation rites, that their organs of sex have been removed.164 Further evidence "58 No. 10, p. 320. י י" No. 10, p. 302.

That initiation rites dramatize the suppression of youthful aggres siveness, Roheim finds evidenced in the initiation rites of the Randa and other Central Australian tribes which believe that uninitiated youth would become transformed into demons that would eat the old men of the tribe (No. 30, p. 109). A similar purport is seen by Roheim in the terrors visited upon the initiates among the Pitjentara {ibid., p. 110). Roheim thinks, in this connec tion, of old men in our own society who resent being superseded in business by younger men (p. 109). He also surmises elements of latent hostility in the severities practiced by pedagogues. Can the author mean to connect incestuous urges with these manifestations in our own midst?</page><page sequence="35">[35] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 239 is adduced from a modern clinical observation that, with Jewish patients, an unconscious symbol of castration attaches to their state of being circumcised.165 "The acceptance of castration in order to demonstrate the giving up of incest" is Feldman's account of the circumcision depicted in Josh. 5.166 Cognate to this is the idea of Roheim that, when Gideon, in striking down the Ashera, symbolically violates his mother, the tree reminds him of the oak of Mamre where Abraham, shortly after his circumcision, sat convalescing.167 A kindred implication is acribed to the linen breeches worn by the priests.168 Only the castrated, desexualized male may enter the Holy of Holies, such entrance being tantamount to the incestuous act of entering the Great Mother.169 Likewise a symbol of castration is the requirement that the priest be ritually pure.170 Castration is further linked with the observance of Yom Kippur.171 Reconciliation with the father is achieved through a self-emasculation such as would preclude infringement upon the father's sexual privileges. Castration is predicated also of the removal of the shoes by the officiating Kohenites.172 It is argued that removal of the shoes bespeaks castration because such removal implies submission. Sandor Feldman, who expounds this theory, holds that, in the UalizahUalizah ceremony, the sister-in-law symbolically castrates the brother-in-law.173 Hence, according to this author, the Kohenitic shoe removal means that castration has been accepted and incestuous desires renounced.174 168 No. 30, p. m. 166 No. 10, p. 303. 167 No. 27, p. 199.

The real reason, thinks Barahal, is the husband's fear of homosexuality and his consequent need of intensifying his wife's femininity by recourse to that castration symbol. The reverse of castration is surmised in the ritualistic cov ering of the head. Says Eder, discussing this requirement, "A castrated man may not appear before his associates or his elders or his God."177 B. THE FATHER IMAGE Also operative here is the father image. Thus one of our writers detects, in the prayer shawl and the phylacteries, mother identi fications and also father identifications.178 This author contends that, as superstition wanes and phylacteries no longer convey the father image and no longer effectuate the presence of God, they cease to fulfill their purpose; the result being neuroses as the only way out of tensions due to feelings of guilt and cravings for punishment.179 Sandor Feldman surmises that, in the Kohenite blessing, the priests become identical with God and the congregation identified both with God and with the priests.180 We have already noticed how this author finds God duplicated in the Kohenitic arrange ment of the fingers.181 The fingers resemble the lattice in Cant. 2.9 through which the lover, who is God, can look with a frightening gaze.182 This author asserts that the finger-spread of the Aaron "s No. 7, p. 499. 176 No. I, p. 301. י" No. 7, p. 484.

The minister is "to his congregation the personification of the father image largely concerned with moral values and taboos."184 This writer claims that, ac cording to Reform Jewish theology, the Rabbi functions either as a prophet or as a priest but that, as a priest, he gains readier acceptance.185 With modern conditions blurring the father image in the popular conception of God, that image attaches to the Rabbi more and more; just as, in Christian theology, Jesus moves into the foreground while God, the Father, recedes.186 C. THE SUPER-EGO Another psychoanalytic concept invoked here is that of the Super-Ego. "Super-Ego" means approximately the same as "conscience." According to psychoanalysis, conscience is a psychic deposit remaining from the demands levied upon us by our parents and subsequently by society as a whole. One of our writers is aware of the Super-Ego in the story of Paradise.187 The Super-Ego, he claims, animates the belief there enunciated that cohabitation and its consequences are punitive. The voice of the Deity in Gen. 3.8 is labeled an "introjected father-image and Super-Ego."188 Roheim calls initiation ceremonies "socialized or institutional ized representations of the Oedipus complex, of castration anxiety and Super-Ego formation," a conclusion which he regards as validated by clinical observation.18' Castration anxiety connects 18נ No. 10, p. 320. The attention of none of our authors has been arrested by the passages in Sot. 36B (line 31) where literally a father-image deters Joseph from wrong doing, or the passage in YaHfu{ Shim'oni, 171, on Ex. 3.6 telling how Moses was heartened by an auditory image of his father, Amram. ,8■י No. 32, p. 320. 185 No. 32, pp. 221, 227. 186 No. 32, p 222.

The Super-Ego is also associated, by one of our writers, with phylacteries and prayer shawl.150 According to Freud, the entire of Jewish history is permeated by a sense of guilt that originated in the killing of Moses which, in turn, repeated the killing of the primeval father. This also would evince the Super-Ego's workings. The role of the Super Ego, according to Freud, was vested in Moses, the great man.151 Further thoughts of Freud are that the guilt of having killed Moses stimulated the wish phantasy of a Messiah, and that the Christian grievance against the Jews is not that the Jews mur dered God but that the Jews refuse to admit the crime (No. 12, pp. 161, 162). Freud terminates the volume by confessing that this refusal on the part of the Jews calls for additional research. We are further apprised that the modern Rabbi, insofar as he assumes the function of prophet, voices the demands of the Super-Ego and its restraints upon the Id.152 By "Id" is meant approximately the automatic reactions of the organism. This writer deems the church (including, of course, the synagogue) a group expression of the Super-Ego checking the predatory trends of the Id as these are exhibited in capitalism and its economic warfare.153 , D. EXPIATION AND PUNISHMENT Acts of punishment or of self-punishment or of vicarious punish ment for the son's aggressiveness are seen by our writers at various points.

They may also count as specimens of the dramatizations mentioned in the same context — one of those dramatiza tions of science whose divergence from those of religion we pondered supra, pp. 222.</page><page sequence="39">[39] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 243 for which, in the story of Paradise, death is the penalty.194 Death suggests to Roheim certain clinical types of neurotic anxiety concerning death.195 He comments that, in Gen. 3, death is represented by the serpent.196 The serpent eats dust as the dead, in Babylonian folklore, eat dust. The woman's birth pangs and her desire for the male — in the Biblical account, punishments for partaking of the forbidden fruit — are, psychoanalytically speaking, vicarious retribution for the son's obtrusiveness.197 The expulsion from Paradise is ex plained as signifying the punitive character of birth itself; the psychoanalysts denominate it the trauma of separation from the mother's body.198 Roheim further interprets the account as teaching that growth and sexual maturity are misfortunes. Do they not bring the forfeiture of infantile happiness? Manner for manner, sexual sin is thus penalized by sexual tribulation.199 Isaac-Edersheim construes the story of Cain to mean that Cain is punished with immortality and, attendant upon that immortality, the compulsion to wander without end.200 That the sin of Cain is the sin of Oedipus has already been brought to our attention.201 An expiatory import is attributed also to circumcision and to burnt offerings.202 How the threshold of the sanctuary where sacrifices are offered is equated with the sexual threshold of life has already been explicated.205 The psychoanalytic teaching is reaffirmed, according to which the sacrifice of the bull or the ram dramatizes both the crime and the doom.204 Roheim main tains that the priest was permitted to enter the tabernacle only after he had expiated the patricide by dying in the guise "4 No. 27, p. 177.

The paschal lamb receives a kindred interpretation. A bloody token saved Israel just as the rite of circumcision saved Moses.205 Expiation is achieved also through the scapegoat. The community symbolically tears itself to pieces as the scapegoat is torn to pieces. The community thus relieves its anxiety about being torn to pieces — an anxiety, we are informed, not unfamiliar in modern clinical practice.206 A double of Cain is the immortal Wandering Jew.207 Why wandering should be the penalty of murder Isaac-Edersheim elucidates for us by reference to the primitive belief that the murderer is pursued by demons.208 This author quotes a legend which recites how Buddha conferred a punitive immortality upon a rebellious disciple.209 Other parallels are the Flying Dutchman and Judas Iscariot.210 It is pointed out that, as in the stories of Zeus, Osiris, Oedipus, and Parsifal, gods may be overthrown and yet their vanquishers punished.211 Of like tenor are the eternal punishments of the Erinnies, Sisyphus, Tantalus, the Danaides, and the denizens of Dante's Hell.212 An identical import is conjectured of the Golem.213 We are told that Golem phantasies, always leading to the Golem's destruction, express the desire to slay the guilt laden self. By menacing its creator, the Golem automatically punishes the audacity of seeking to imitate the creative prowess of God.214 Coming now to our own generation, our No. 32 opines that the respect shown by congregants for the modern Rabbi re produces the subordination of the child to the dreaded parent, the ultimate intent being to ward off "the evil which the father can impose upon his rebellious children."215 "S No. 31, p. 62.

Reconciliation Between Father and Son After the hostility of the son toward the father and of the father toward the son, the third phase of the Oedipus situation con templated in psychoanalysis is that of reconciliation between the two. The literature which we are surveying perceives many signs of this in the Jewish domain. A. Conciliatory Actions Tokens of conciliation are spied by Roheim in the covenant of the pieces (Gen. 15)16ג and again in the covenant of circumcision, the latter implying, as already noted, castration and feminization which render the son innocuous for advances upon the mother."7 Such reconciliation between father and son, between God and man, is descried also in Abraham's readiness to sacrifice Isaac."8 A demonstration of submissiveness, the Sinaic theophany like wise accounces a reconciliation between remorseful son and irate father."' Analogous, according to Isaac-Edersheim, was• the cult of animal sacrifice."0 While the offering of the animal reiterated the slaying and the devouring of the father, it represented, at the same time, expiation and reconciliation. One of our writers, as we saw, posits an underlying identity between the sacrificial cult and circumcision.3" The altar itself is a monument to such conciliatoriness. "The primitive altar was nothing more than a suitable stone, pre sumably a phallic symbol. The erection of such a stone amounted to an affirmation of the recognition of the masculinity of Jah weh."2" This is said especially of the altar built by Abraham. Also symbolic of reconciliation, according to this writer, is the law against using, upon the altar, any tool of iron."3 "« No. 25, p. 454• "7 Supra, p. 238, No. 31, pp. 57, 63, No. 34, p. 657.

And that means the renunciation of all incestuous father-offending designs."6 Reconciliation is effected likewise by the Day of Atonement. The ritual of that day is asserted to constitute a periodic cas tration and, at the same time, a periodic orgasm for which the castration castration is the conciliatory expiation."7 According to Freud, the Jewish and Christian belief in a Messiah proffers a device whereby the patricide is canceled, rendering it as if it had never taken place."8 For the sacred and perilous act of killing the sacrosanct totem, the entire com munity, according to Isaac-Edersheim, was deemed responsible thus rendering a Messiah indispensable."9 In the Messiah also, the concept of reconciliation thus inheres. Reconciliation attaches likewise to the phylacteries. As shown by the wearer's kissing of the phylacteries and his solic itousitous care of them, the phylacteries can stand for the parents, both father and mother, in their genial moods.250 The kissing and the solicitude are themselves conciliatory gestures. Eder de scribes a certain patient who recalled how austere and stern his father became as soon as he put on his phylacteries, although the father was otherwise a man of gracious demeanor. The same is asserted with regard to the kissing of the prayer shawl and the reverence shown the prayer shawl, whose purple fringes are alleged by Eder to represent the blood of the slaught ered totem.231 Pathological cases are reported in which the analyst himself gets to impersonate the genial father behind the well kissed phylacteries, prayer shawl, and Mezuzah.

As one of our writers has observed, washing the hand signifies the wish to be cleansed of the primeval sin.232 Abstinence from wine, which resembles blood and hence the blood of the slain father, amounts to an abnegation of the patricidal impulse. Removal of the shoes denotes castration and hence impotence as regards appropriating the mother.233 The three-pronged finger spacing of the Aaronides betokens the trinity: father, mother, child, and thus the gracious restoration of infancy, lost but much desired.234 The fingers also represent the hitherto castrated organ, now restored and enlarged. Looking through' the fingers re produces the Divine eyes and also, says Feldman, the Divine genitals affectionately disposed toward God's people. The priests' uplifted hands, as well as the pronunciation, over the people, of the Divine Name and the removal of the shoes, all of them genitally symbolic, proclaim a friendship, indeed a blood covenant, between the people and God.235 The Aaronide blessing is asserted to restore, in some manner, that which the castration takes away.236 The land given to Israel constitutes, according to Feldman, the recovery of the lost mother and not only the reinstatement but also, as we saw, the augmentation of the previously detached member. Agreeing with Reik, our author writes: "The Sinai scene and the blessing of the Kohenites which I regard as a repetition of it is in its essence the repression of the urge to hate the father and to kill him and the victory of love and recognition of God over the unconscious hatred and anger."237 From a conciliatory trend, emanates likewise the tale of the Golem. Though the Golem, as depicted by Isaac-Edersheim, embodies sedition against the Deuty, the stories narrate that the Golem was created by Divine command.238 This act of obedience spells reconciliation between the outraged father and the obtrusive offspring. s3* No. 10, pp. 306, 320.

According to Freud, the value that monotheists impute to monotheism echoes the devotion of the primitive horde to its leader.239 In monotheism, Freud claims, the grandeur of the primeval father is restored and the emotions originally directed toward him are revived.240 The obsessiveness of monotheism among the Jews and its persistence among the Christians be trays, according to Freud, its continuity with a primeval order.241 Monotheism demands, among other things, abstinence from worshiping the mother and this implies, in turn, such veneration for the father as to preclude incestuous leanings. Freud holds that, even after the accession of Jesus, God the Father, retained the devotion and adoration of the Christians; former gods, sometimes in the shape of "demons, tending to survive in popular belief.242 Whenever the church would deviate from pristine Aton monotheism and deteriorate into rituals, non conformist movements would develope and seek its revival.243 Jones adds the qualifying reflection, however, that the Jewish compunction about placating the Father led away from the pure religion of Moses into a cult of ceremonialism.244 Freud would account for many a phase of Jewish history by regarding it as an expression of remorse for the Jewish killing of Moses and as a search for Atonement. In the Jewish reiteration that the misfortunes which had befallen Israel justly punish Israel's sins, that remorse is allegedly demonstrated.245 B.

Homosexual fac tors are also traced in the blessing of the Aaronides ;248 the priests, identified with God, become the objects of homosexual regard. Homosexual reactions are discernible within the group itself.24' According to this author, the God who looks through the Aaron ides' fingers enters into a homosexual bond with His people.250 The psychoanalytic concept of ambivalence rests upon the observation that hate and affection can coexist in the same person toward one and the same individual.251 Ambivalence, we learn, can mark the kissing of prayer shawl, phylacteries, and Mezuzah.Mezuzah. The kiss can express adulation; it can also betoken cannibalism.252 Those ritual objects would thus impersonate the father in his love-eliciting capacity and, at the same time, in his quality as a provocative of detestation.253 A similar ambivalence operates, we are told, in the phantasy of the Wandering Jew. Ahasuerus, timeless and spaceless like God, is in fact God Himself as an object of aversion, while God otherwise remains an object of veneration.254 The same is predicated of R. Loew and the Golem. The Golem's attack on the Jews discloses a latent enmity toward his people on the part of R. Loew, their leader, servant, and friend.255 With this ambivalence, such incidents comport as R. Loew's slip of the tongue, the taper that goes out during his service in the synagogue, the wine cup that falls out of his hand at a marriage ceremony, and the servant who, in R. Loew's presence, drops a scroll of the Torah. 2&lt;6 No. 31.

We now proceed to consider: a.) Psychoanalytic Ideas Outside of the Oedipus Concept. b.) The Critique of the Psychoanalytic Material. c.) Non-Psychoanalytic Material. V.

Psychoanalytic material of other classifications comes within our purview. There occurs, for instance, a mother role different from that of the mother in the Oedipus relationship. Man's cleaving to his wife in Gen. 2.24 is taken to imply a mother-imago corre sponding to the father-imago discussed elsewhere.259 The benigni ties and the malignities connected with the phylacteries and the prayer shawl are alleged to belong not only to the father but to the mother as well.260 Supplementing the accounts of the son and father conflict, some of our authors expatiate on an analogous child and mother conflict.

Such imagery is said to enact the infant's hostility to its mother and the destruction of the mother's body.262 Talions of such destruction are stories about the annihilation of a child: for example, the judgment of Solomon in I Ki. 16.34 or Abraham's abortive move to sacrifice Isaac or the sacrifices of children at the laying of foundations as mentioned in Josh. 6.26 and I Ki. 16.34.263 Roheim reports, from clinical observation, phantasies of opening the mother's body and taking something out of it, or phantasies of sawing or cutting or biting the mother's body in two.264 Roheim recalls, in this connection, that "the hero god Indra represents the body destruction phan tasy of the infant who wishes to cleave or pierce the mother's body and tear out the good objects it contains."265 This author attributes that reaction to the distressing separation of the child from the nipple.266 He invokes the psychoanalytic concept of ambivalence to include, on the one hand, the bliss of sucking and, on, the other, the annoyance of weaning and the consequent impulsion to do the mother to death. Also outside of the Oedipus scheme, lies the psychoanalytic doctrine of the masculine protest, which means woman's resent ment of man's presumed superiority. On the one hand, Roheim maintains that the story of Paradise affirms male pre-eminence in that it pictures woman as emerging from man instead of man from woman267 while, on the other hand, according to Isaac Edersheim, the exaltation of Mother Earth in the formation of Adam from earth or of the Golem from earth remonstrates 261 No. 28, pp. 40, 50. 262 No. 25, p. 455.

Hair-cutting also involves, outside of the Oedipus framework, some intimat'ons of homosexuality. According to Barahal, as we have already noticed, the husband guards himself against homosexuality by symbolically castrating and thus additionally femin'zing his wife.270 Likewise outside of the Oedipus configuration fall some of the Rabbinic dream interpretations treated in our No. 4.271 This article sees psychoanalytic surmises in the discussion of the dreams which play on the word Cappadocia and on the words ShunnaraShunnara and Shinnara.272 The opinion is ventured that, when Ibn Ezra and Gersonides interpret Job 33.15 to mean that one can derive valuable counsel from dreams, those commentators evince discernments not unlike those of psychoanalysis in our own time.273 Our attention has been drawn to the psychoanalytic theory that our unconscious desire to slay generates a dread of retribu tion taking the same form — Middah keneged Middah — as our 68נ No. 14, p. 199. י6נ No. i, p. 301.

The weird fascination exerted by the phantasy of the Golem marks not only the Oedipus involvement but other situations as well.275 Thus the hostility manifested by Jewish parishioners toward the modern Rabbi is explained not only as a disguised hostility toward one's father but, in addition, as a displacement of the hostility felt by the Jews toward their inexorable persecutors.276 Similarly external to the Oedipus domain is the modern Rabbi's purported capacity to counteract the demonic forces hovering around birth, marriage, and death, a capacity founded, we are informed, on the taboo attaching to the Rabbi in his role as prophet. This taboo is asserted to be the Rabbi's protection.277 To slay a prophet is dangerous (Ps. 105.15). Ordination, accord1 ing to this writer, confers upon the Reform Rabbi a "contagious magic." This literature also utilizes, outside of the Oedipus structure, the psychoanalytic concept of Narcissism, by which is meant the sexually tinctured love directed toward oneself. A growth away from infantile Narcissism is recognized by Jules de Leeuwe in the development of cosmogonies such as that of the Bible.278 Speaking of the modern Rabbi as a protagonist of social justice, Efraim Rosenzweig identifies economic reactionism with nar cissistic, infantile self-love from which industrial democracy is a deliverance into adulthood.279 Also not overlooked is the psychoanalytic concept of All machtmacht der Gedanken. Omnipotence of thought is bracketed with the evolution of language which tremendously enhances the power of the intellect.280 "« Supra, p. 234 referring to No. 10, p. 302. Cf. No. 26, p. 20.

Critique of the Psychoanalytic Material Before we proceed to the non-psychoanalytic material,'we pause to estimate the material thus far presented. In so doing, we must adhere rigidly to our role as investigators. The question before us is not whether we are emotionally gratified or emotionally perturbed by these findings or by the possible effects of these findings upon others. Our only question is: Scientifically speaking, are these deliverances correct or incorrect? How near do they come to reporting facts? How adequately do they handle the problems which they undertake to solve? How satisfactorily do they meet the empirical test? One striking feature of this material is its disregard for our customary departmentalizations. Freud, Roheim, Eder, Feld man, Rosenzweig, Isaac-Edersheim, and some of the others do not limit their range to the clinic and the laboratory. Many are their forays into the realms of archaeology and anthropology. Aside from questions touching psychology, queries therefore arise concerning the distant past. Of course, when a writer like Roheim depicts contemporary practices of primitive tribes, we confront nothing that provokes any challenge. But when our writers indulge in conjectures about usages of prehistoric an tiquity, the professional anthropologist may feel tempted to protest. A. Errors of Anthropology The amateurishness of the anthropology in Freud's Moses and Monotheism Monotheism was readily exposed, notably by Morris Cohen in Jewish Jewish Social Studies for October 1939, by Salo Baron in the American American Journal of Sociology for November 1939, and by A. S. Jahuda in Bitzaron, Vol. I, 455 ff. and Vol. II, 6 ff. and 121 ff. Similarly has Clemen, in our No. 3, refuted the anthro pological surmises in Fromm's article on the Sabbath,281 in Reik's essay on the Shofar,282 in the reflections of Reik and of 281 No. 34, pp. 637, 640, 648, 650, 659, 661. 282 No. 34, pp. 668-670, 672-675, 680-685, 697.</page><page sequence="51">[51] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 255 Karl Abraham on the Kol Nidre,283 in the views of Reik on the census of David284 and on the attempted sacrifice of Isaac,285 in Allwohn's interpretation of Hosea,286 in Reik's explication of Michelangelo's "Moses,"287 in Frieda Fromm-Reichmann's disquisition on the Jewish laws of diet,288 and in the psycho analytic explanations of threshold taboos289 and of the sacred silence admonished in Zeph. 1.7, Hab. 2.20, and Zech. 2.17.290 Clemen holds that nothing whatsoever in Genesis warrants the assumption that Abraham's attempted sacrifice of Isaac conceals an assault by Abraham, Isaac's father, upon Isaac's grandfather.291 Reik's interpretation of the injury to Jacob's locomotor tendon in Gen. 32.24, Clemen scorns as far fetched.292 Clemen recognizes a better explanation in Frazer's Golden Bough (1912, Vol. II, p. 264 ff.) and in Frazer's Folklore in the Old Testament Testament (1919, Vol. II, pp. 423, 424). The notion that there was totem worship in ancient Israel, Clemen pronounces utterly unfounded. Hence the groundlessness of the psychoanalytic claim that the Moses of Michelangelo resembles an animal.293 Reik's suppositions about the self-punishment of Moses in his demolition of the tablets and pulverization of the golden calf collapses in Clemen's refutation of the entire Freudian anthro pology.294 288 No. 34, pp. 642, 651-653, 658, 664, 666, 675. 384 No. 34, pp. 607, 611. 285 No. 34, pp. 649, 680. 286 No. 34, pp. 623-626. 287 No. 34, pp. 676, 679, 682, 686, 698.

More convincing does he find the explanation in Mensching's Heiliges Schweigen. In the course of his devastating criticism, Clemen declares it not at all sur prising that authorities on Judaism pay no attention to these psychoanalytic ruminations.303 The psychoanalytic theory of castration is repudiated, from the anthropological standpoint, by Westermark. Says Wester mark: Circumcision as an initiation rite has been represented by psycho-analysts as a survival of, and substitute for an earlier act of castration. This is absurd, con sidering that castration could at most have only taken place in rare cases, whilst initation rites, where they occur, are general. Or circumcision has been said to serve the purpose of punishing and preventing incest. But its generality as an intiation rite also makes it impossible to take it for a punishment : and as a means of preventing incest it would be useless. It cannot prevent it by inspiring fear where it is performed anyhow; nor does it produce physical incapacity for performing the forbidden act.3"* While most of the strictures here summarized relate not to the publications surveyed in this article but to the older ones surveyed in our No. 34, there can be no question that the objec tions raised in the one case are fully as applicable in the other. The anthropological suppositions of our No. 31, for instance, are surely no less vulnerable than those ventured by Freud, Reik, Fromm, Abraham, Allwohn, and the others as synopsized in our earlier study.303 As for Moses and Monotheism, this effusion, far from offering psychological explanations of religious phe nomena, lavishes its ingenuity on assumed and hypothetical religious phenomena, not phenomena that exist but, to a great extent, phenomena that are merely conjectured to have existed in an effaced antiquity. 303 No. 31 P• 14• 304 No. 33, p. 234. 305 See supra especially the matter at note indicators 38, 50-56, 58, 71, 110, 202, 205, 224, 225, 335.

ERRORS OF PSYCHOLOGY Even more vehement are the condemnations visited upon psycho analysis by the authorities in psychology. The accusation is brought that the methods of psychoanalysis are definitely not scientific. A sample is a statement like that of James Feibleman: The method of psychoanalysis is not the method of science . . . the scientific claims of psychoanalysis are specious and false .... In psychoanalysis, scien tific method is completely misunderstood, and inductions made at the level of enlightened common sense are taken for both the highly abstractive indue tions and the experimentation of physical science.306 An authority no less renowned than Havelock Ellis declares that: To survey the vast field in which he has desired to move is indeed to raise the question whether Freud is properly regarded as a man of science . . . The varied fields of unquestioned scientific study which Freud has entered, he has entered as an amateur, deliberately disregarding any other method of approach and, when he seeks support, not always selecting that which carries most weight . . Freud might be termed an amateur throughout, since he has almost ostentatiously ignored the results of previous workers, except when he chanced to find that they supported his own view.307 Ellis, in fact, while discussing Freud in highly gracious and amicable terms, rates Freud not as a scientist but as an artist. Says Ellis: Freud is a great deal of an artist, though he himself repels that attribution, declaring that he is nothing but a man of science .... Freud's art is the poetry of psychic processes which lie in the deepest and most mysterious recesses of the organism ... At the highest points of human genius, science and art become indistinguishable.308 For a completely shattering inspection of psychoanalysis one need go no further than The House That Freud Built by Joseph Jastrow (New York, 1932).

Robert Mac Iver observes: The lapse from science appears when he claims unwarranted certainty and treats his inferences as though they were established facts . . . The Freudians . . have widely exposed themselves to this charge .... Freud tells us, for example, that the rise of religion is due to the child's sense of helplessness and his longing for a father, and that totemism is a device by which the primitive tribe guarded itself against the dangers associated with incest. But these, like countless other examples of psychoanalytic pronouncement, are mere sug gestive hypotheses which should be stated and treated as such ... In the literature of psychoanalysis there is all too frequently contentment with the original guess, the acceptance of analogy as proof, the daring leap in the dark — the salto mortale of faith.309 Not far removed from Mac Iver's criticism is that of Clemen who, referring to what Frieda Fromm-Reichmann reports about the erotic reactions of certain Jewish patients to ritually pro hibited foods, charges that such may have been produced in the patients by suggestion. Clemen is also among those who protest against applying, to people who are normal, diagnoses obtained by the analyses of neurotics — even granting that those analyses be correct.3" He attributes the entire Freudian outlook to the peculiar circles to which the psychoanalysts, together with their patients, belong. He further blames Freudianism on certain literary trends, preoccupied with matters that psychoanalysis love to stress.311 Particularly subject to question is the theory that certain types of memory are inherited. One of our writers adopts Jung's doctrine of a folk psyche and a collective unconscious manifest in myth, in legend, and in various practices that greatly resemble though occurring among widely separated peoples.312 Another posits phylogenetic patterns to which the individual returns when in a group.313 Freud himself sees, in tradition, something that parallels the repressions and recollections in the memory of the individual.314 Monotheism, according to Freud, exhibits "נ« No. 19, PP• 9, 10. 3" No. 3, pp. 5, 12.

These, he thinks, illustrate the recur rence of an identical theme in the unconscious part of the folk mind and, consequently, in the unconscious part of an author's mind.3'' And yet, one of our writers, though a Freudian himself, judges the doctrine of inherited memories definitely out of line with scientific findings.320 The most that this writer will concede is the inherited disposition to react to certain types of situations with certain types of phantasies. De Leeuwe similarly dissents from the view that, to explain Monotheism, we must assume that the memory of an ancient patricide was bequeathed to the unconscious.32' De Leeuwe does, however, grant that a God conception free of egocentricity may be the product of some inborn human propensity. Further charged against psychoanalysis is the tendency to ignore the multiplicity of factors operative in the human mind concept of latency in connection with the theory of certain periods dur ing which the Mosaic religion suffered abeyance, pending later resusci tation. 315 No. 16, p. 426. 314 No. 16, p. 427, No. 31, p. 64, No. 12, pp. 178, 179. 317 No. 30, p. ill. 318 A.

Freud's testy reaction to the term "religion," glaringly obvious in his ZukunftZukunft Einer Illusion, does not obtrude itself in Moses and Monotheism.Monotheism. Nevertheless, he does evaluate — sometimes in eulogistic terms.323 Meanwhile an undertone of contempt for "religion" and the consequent inclination to apply the word only to matters so preposterous as to evoke contempt pervades some of the other psychoanalytic effusions. In the article on the Reform Rabbinate, the abundance of technical terminology hardly suffices to conceal the writer's dissatisfaction with the existing state of affairs.324 If we define research as the ascertain ment and publication of facts to the exclusion of appraisal, our psychoanalytic writers deport themselves as psychological sub jects rather than investigators. The question is not easily dis missed : What has occurred in the lives of these writers to prompt those bizarre constructions profferred without any supporting evidence or with little supporting evidence such as we are ac customed to expect of scientific writings? C. THE UNDERLYING TRUTH Meanwhile it is not out of place to ask whether these psycho analytic ruminations embody any truth at all. We can not remain unimpressed by their extensive acceptance and their zealous adoption by persons widely separated in cultural back ground and geographical location. The most vehement detrac tors of psychoanalysis do not deny it every iota of worth. Even "a No. 9. p. 61. 3ינ Such as "hoehere Geistigkeit" (p. 116), "die Hoehe der Vergeistigung" (p. 158), "hoehere Stufe der Geistigkeit," "Fortschritte der Geistigkeit" (p. 203), and "Grossartiges" (p. 226). On p. 158, the author speaks of the "kulturelle Regression" of Christianity. On pp. 216, 217, he comments sar castically on the enviable position of those whose problems are blithely solved by popular theology. On p. 228, he denies that God "exists," thus using "God" informationally, obviously unaware of any other semantic function. See supra,supra, pp. 212-214. *u Supra, pp. 237, 241, 244.</page><page sequence="58">[58] 262 ABRAHAM CRONBACH Joseph Jastrow admits that it has some value.325 Also James Feibeleman concedes: On the theoretical side, psychoanalysis has accomplished much by discovering and emphasizing certain functions and processes which were hardly known before, or if they were known, at least were overlooked. The calling of atten tion to the importance of the sexual side of man's nature in his total constitu tiori is the contribution of Freud, just as the important part played by the economic side of man's nature in his total constitution is the contribution of Karl Marx.326 Let the suggestion therefore be entertained that the chief drawback of psychoanalysis may lie in its nomenclature. The writer above mentioned may have uncovered the central diffi culty when he observes : Many entities of psychoanalysis which seem new and strange to the unini tiated are merely old ideas dressed up in new terms and given unusual impor tance. Thus, for instance, the ego stands for the old conception of conscious ness, the super-ego for the 'still small voice of conscience,' and the id for the unconscious . . . Certainly there is no particularly keen insight involved in giving fresh names to old ideas.32' If the exotic terminology of psychoanalysis constitutes an element of weakness, perhaps the translation of that terminology into familiar language may reveal elements of strength. This we shall now attempt. * One of the best known attributes of our psycho-physical organism is its tendency to repeat. Whatever the organism does successfully,328 it tends to do again. Habit is one of the most familiar of all phenomena. Closely related to habit is memory. Memory signifies that, if two presentations are once conjoined, the repetition of the one tends to bring with it the mental repetition of the other. Our word "presentation," it hardly needs explaining, covers both sense perception and mental imagery. •*2s Joseph Jastrow, The House That Freud Built, New York and Cleveland, 1942, pp. 288-292. 24ג No. 9, p. 62. 2נ' No. 9, p. 58. As Freud puts it, all processes of the Id are unconscious (No. 12, p. 172). 328 The concept of success takes us into metaphysics. Success implies a purpose fulfilled, and purpose is one of the ultimates of the universe.</page><page sequence="59">[59] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 263 Here also belongs heredity. The inherited memories assumed by Freud may be fictitious. Heredity and memory are, nonethe less, phases of the same cosmic manifestation, namely, repetition. Otherwise stated, if the organism responds successfully to a given situation329 in a given way, it will tend to repeat that response when the same situation recurs, to the extent to which it recurs, and in part if it recurs only in part. Of course, it is only in part that any situation can recur at all. Exact repetition is impossible not merely because the universe is constantly changing but also because every occurrence becomes a precedent for its subsequent recurrence, and an occurrence having a precedent differs markedly from that same occurrence minus a precedent. Amid those partially recurrent situations and the reiteration of response, we sometimes note the functioning of memory. We react as we do because there is something of which we are re minded. But sometimes memory is not involved. The factors constituting memory may not be among the factors that recur. Most of us have completely forgotten how we first learnt to walk or how we first discovered the meanings of certain words or how we first became acquainted with certain commonplace facts. Many of our responses are reflex and automatic and many, like those of healthy digestion, breathing, circulation, or locomo tion can be unconscious. Sometimes these responses are not unconscious altogether but contain elements of emotion. We can experience a repetition of the feelings evoked by past situations even after those situa tions themselves have faded from recollection. Analogous per 32י Admittedly, this is a provisional way of speaking, like "sunrise" and "sunset." Situation and response are, in many ways, interfused. "Situation" refers to one aspect and "response" to another aspect of the same totality. Two people may stand at the same place at the same time and yet experience markedly different situations. Responses determine situations as surely as situations determine responses. Nor will the conscientious psychologist ignore such factors as purpose and personality. The individual's purposes determine the way in which that individual's responses will be rendered. Purpose also regulates the individual's choice of stimuli by which the responses are to be aroused. The uniqueness of a human being, in this regard, constitutes person ality and individuality. See supra, note 6.</page><page sequence="60">264 ABRAHAM CRONBACII [60] haps is the frequent "intuition that something is wrong" with a sentence which we have written or with an article of food. Precisely where the flaw may lurk, we ferret out later. Another example may be the sense of having forgotten something without being able, until later, to determine what. As suggested in the first division of this article (p. 218), mental associations consist not only of presentative factors such as we call "memory" but also of the non-presentative, the emotional. This region, in which responses occur without memory, seems to be the domain of psychoanalysis. It is misleading to speak of this domain as that of the unconscious. It were more apt to say: the domain of the unremembered. While many of our re sponses are indeed unconscious, many again, though at their recurrence devoid of memory, do repeat their affective con comitants. It is these affective concomitants that fascinate the Freudian. Prenatal existence, for instance, may set up certain response patterns destined to figure among the determinants of later behavior. The same may be said of infancy and of early child hood. Happenings of these periods may sink into oblivion and yet initiate forms of response operative throughout life. This may also apply to the events of youth and of maturity. The events, though forgotten may, nonetheless, evoke responses that persist. Such may be the ingredient of truth in the psychoanalytic doctrines of the traumas of birth and of weaning, of incestuous longings for the mother, and of conflict with one's parents. Parental restraints may generate, in the child's organism, re sponses partially repeated in later life, although the restraints may have occurred too early to be recalled. We venture the surmise that our responses to music, painting, sculpture, poetry, dramatics,330 and even to words may derive from similarly deleted incidents. 3°נ°ננ Charles Baudouin, Psychanalyse de L'Art, Paris, 1929. Superior, unless supplementary, to ours is the explanation of the uncon scious given by Edwin R. Guthrie in The Psychology of Human Conflict, Harper and Bros., New York, 1938. Guthrie (pp. 108-116) identifies the un conscious with the unnamed as in our No. 34 note 695 and pp. 717, 718.</page><page sequence="61">[61] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 265 Why now may not this appertain also to the responses evoked by religion? Why may not the reiteration of response minus memory account for the appeal exerted by certain myths, rituals, and dogmas — exerted not only upon their originators but also upon those who accept or reject or merely ponder those myths, rituals, and dogmas? A response, successful in one situation, can be disastrous in another. One would certainly fall down stairs were one, descend ing the steps, to walk in a manner entirely suitable when travers ing level ground. Similarly, the mental abnormalities which psychoanalysis treats may exemplify unsuccessful repetitions of responses which, under previous circumstances, may have been entirely feasible. The alteration of the response program from that which was adequate in a prior situation to one which is adequate to the contemporary situation seems to be the essence of psychiatry. Such may be the modicum of truth in psychoanalysis. Psychoanalysis recognizes that our responses have been fashioned by forgotten experiences as well as by remembered experiences. The problem of psychoanalysis is that of refurbishing the expunged, of exhuming the interred. Every human being under goes the predicament of being born, of being an infant, and of being a child dependent upon and subject to one's elders. Those happenings generate responses which, by the law of repetition, become response patterns, and those patterns, even when unattended by memory, retain affective components which can permeate many of life's reactions, those of religion included. Psychoanalysis seeks to recover the forgotten incidents which brought those emotion laden responses into being. This will enable us to specify the shortcomings of the psycho analytic literature which we have surveyed. To any given religious presentation, different individuals, shaped by different histories, yield different reactions. A minute scrutiny of each individual would be required to determine, with any measure of probability, what was the incident of that individual's baby hood or later life which, though now forgotten, inaugurated the response in question. Our psychoanalytic studies of Judaism report very little observation of individuals; and, where such</page><page sequence="62">266 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [62] observation is recorded, the conclusions drawn are not limited to the individual studied but are stretched to embrace myriads of individuals who, through uncounted generations, have reacted to the beliefs and rituals under scrutiny. Such is the inadequacy of evidence to be charged as the central defect in the present psychoanalytic treatment of Judaism."1 -- VII. Non-Psychoanalytic Material The non-psychoanalytic material published since 1929 admits of classification under three rubrics: A. Non-psychoanalytic Material Appearing in Psychoan alytic Journals. B. Statistical Studies. C. Jewish Psychiatric Stories. A. MATERIAL FROM PSYCHOANALYTIC JOURNALS Some of the material, even when published in psychoanalytic journals, falls outside of the psychoanalytic realm. When De Leeuwe speaks of Monotheism and its attendant diminution of anthropomorphism as resulting from the power of abstract thinking, he is not employing psychoanalytic concepts;"2 although elsewhere in the same essay, he connects cosmogonies with a movement away from Narcissism, which is indeed psycho analytic language."3 In like manner, Darlington uses non psychoanalytic phraseology when he psychologizes concerning the story of the Exodus, explaining the withdrawal of the He brews as a split in the personality of a personified Egypt, Egypt suffering thereby a nervous breakdown, and the blood on the doorposts serving to close the psychic wound and to banish the misfortune-producing evil spirits.3" Darlington seems to credit the Biblical writer with a knowledge of modern psychiatry. 33י We observed this already in our previous study, No. 34! P• 7°9 332 No. 6, p. 430. 333 Supra, p. 253. 333 No. 5, p. 283.</page><page sequence="63">[63] NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 267 Possibly Darlington means that the author of the story in Exodus had in mind mental disturbances of the kind diagnosed as "dissociation of personality," "nervous breakdown," and the like by us of today. Rosenzweig's notations on the attitude of the modern con gregation toward its Rabbi also carry matter that is not psycho analytic. This writer speaks of the minister as presenting a rebuke to to the middle class reactionary shopkeeper and obtruding an "irksome reminder of mores and restraints," and erecting a defense for traditions which the modern Jew is trying to escape, particularly in large metropolitan centers where adherence to the mores and traditions impede acceptance by the non-Jew.335 That some of these remarks are evaluative hardly needs indi eating. Moses Moses and Monotheism, our No. 12, likewise abounds in psychological conjectures such as would appear in any anthro pological study. Except where Freud quotes or repeats from his previous psychoanalytic publications, the psychoanalytic con tents of this book are actually meager. B. STATISTICAL STUDIES Then there is the group of studies which exemplify genuine scientific research. One of these is Marvin Nathan's inquiry into the religious life of 1501 Jewish students in 57 colleges and universities, and the striking observation that, among those who attended religious schools, religious loyalty was less pro nounced than among those who had not; and that religion is more honored among the men than among the women, possibly, thinks Nathan, because Sunday Schools are attended by girls more extensively than by boys.336 Akin to this is the article by Markowitz who investigated the "Prayer Life of Adults in a Reform Jewish Community." Forty-four men and twenty-eight women replied to a question naire. The findings of Markowitz accord with those of Nathan נ« No. 32, pp. 225, 226. 3נ' No. 23, pp. 52, 57.</page><page sequence="64">[64] 268 ABRAHAM CRONBACH to the effect that people with a minimum of religious attachment were among those with a maximum of religious background; although the practice of prayer did prevail, to some extent, among those whose religious background was considerable.337 These investigators appear to have demonstrated that "religion," in one sense of the term, need not conduce to "relig ion" in another sense. Ritual or Bible stories can be one thing and consecration something else. Julius Mailer conducted tests of honesty which showed that, the longer the attendance at religious school, the greater the increase of honesty among children coming from privileged neighborhoods but not among children from underprivileged neighborhoods. Otherwise stated, children receiving religious instruction displayed greater honesty than children of the same economic economic group from whom such instruction had been withheld.338 The question is not raised whether the type of parent who patronizes the religious school may not, for some reason, prove better qualified than parents of the other type to imbue the children with the standards of conduct which the investigator supports. In another study, Mailer examined the Jewish information and the Jewish attitudes of 200 Jewish students who were attending secular schools but who had received little or no formal training. It is one of his conclusions that Jewish students, coming largely from orthodox homes, tend to be in greater sympathy with conservative and reform Judaism. Jewish students show little familiarity with the names of great Jews, and are badly misinformed in that connection. Jewish students show a fair knowledge of Jewish customs and ceremonies but ,extremely little knowledge of Jewish history. There is little correlation between the extent of Jewish knowledge and the degree of observing Jewish practices.3" This study, like the previous one, is all but entirely observa tional. Perhaps the only explanatory passage is the one which suspects that "supersensitiveness toward praise on the part of the gentiles" will account for the fact that certain derogatory 337 N0. 22, p. 317. 338 No. 20, pp. 628, 629. 33' No. 21, p. I.</page><page sequence="65">[65J NEW STUDIES IN PSYCHOLOGY OF JUDAISM 269 statements by gentiles concerning Jews imparted, to some of those students, feelings of joy, pride, and pleasure. A Yiddish study of 43 Jewish children, of ages ranging from five to twelve, undertakes to determine at what age and in what manner the consciousness of being Jewish arises. The conclusion is reached that nothing in the nature of Jewish consciousness appears earlier than the age of four. At the outset, conceptions are hazy. Later, Jewishness becomes identified with the Yid dish language, with the European place of parental origin, and with certain hallowed practices and beliefs. There is no difference, in this regard, between boys and girls, either as to their answers or as to the emotional coloring of their answers. Schooling plays a barely perceptible role — again reminding us of con ditions reported by Nathan and by Markowitz — the Jewish consciousness being well developed before the age of formal education. Variation, in this regard, is also not produced by diversity of milieu, wide though the gaps, in other respects, among the several Jewish groupings in the United States.340 C. JEWISH PSYCHIATRIC STORIES Then we have a set of studies which, instead of taking Judaism as an object of inquiry, set forth certain Jewish psychological procedures. One of these is Kowarsky's article on Ansky's Dibbuk.Dibbuk. Kowarsky attempts to explain, in psychiatric termi nology, the methods of the Zaddik of Miropol as he attempts to expel the Dibbuk from the heroine. The problem is that of producing a counter-complex strong enough to overcome the morbid complex by which the heroine is afflicted. The expedients adopted by the Zaddik actually avail toward that end. It is only because of circumstances which interrupt and disturb the therapeutic process that the morbid complex represented by the Dibbuk dominates eventually.341 To this class belongs also Freehof's "Three Psychiatric Studies from Rabbinic Folklore," recounting, from Die Welt 3&lt;° No. 18, p. 330. 3&lt;* No. 17, p. 209.</page><page sequence="66">270 ABRAHAM CRONBACH [66] DerzehltDerzehlt by M. Lipson (New York, 1928), how R. Joshua Leb Diskin cured a woman who, tasting tallow in all that she ate, had ceased eating and become woefully emaciated. The Rabbi's psychiatry consisted in assuring the woman that a candle, which had once fallen into some milk that she had used, measured in bulk only one-sixtieth that of the milk, with the consequence that the milk had remained ritually unimpaired. The article contains also the story narrating how R. Smelke of Nikolsburg healed the Rabbi of Janova of an aberration due to having been lost in the woods and thereby coming to mistake Thursday night for Friday night, the beginning of the Sabbath. The therapy consisted in getting the patient intoxicated and causing him to sleep from sundown Thursday to sundown Friday. The third is a story from Middor Dor, also by M. Lipson, narrating how R. Ezekiel Landau induced the recovery of a sick woman by giving her a rolled-up parchment, counseling her to unroll the parchment in thirty days, and predicting that the absence of writing on the parchment would indicate that the illness had vanished.342 It is obvious that, outside of the psychoanalytic writings, our literature offers little more than recordings of facts. Until we turn to the literature of the psychoanalytic order, explanatory attempts are rare. In the non-psychoanalytic list, appraisal is also rare, although not absent entirely. By and large, this litera ture deviates from scientific standards not so much in its admix ture of evaluation as in the failure of the psychoanalysts to marshall the evidence needed to substantiate their claims. נ4ג No. 11, p. 185.
