<plain_text><page sequence="1">REPORTS AND PROCEEDINGS. ANTHROPOLOGY AT BRISBANE. The Australian and New Zealand Association for the Advancement of Science - to use its new title - held its Brisbane meeting from 28th May to 4th June. The first gathering of the Anthropology Section took place on Friday, 29th May, and was opened by the Presidential Address delivered by Professor A. R. RadclifFe-Brown, M.A., the subject being "Applied Anthropology." After stating that the laws of social anthropology are of the same nature as those of the physical sciences the President proceeded to discuss the question of social integration, to show that every institution, of backward as well as of civilized peoples, had its function and meaning in their culture. Interference with native institutions and suppression of them by the white man, unless they are replaced by other social forms fulfilling a similar function, lead to the disturbance of the order and well-being of the society, to a state of social disintegration. This general principle was illustrated by examples. " Marriage by purchase," which in the true native culture is really a form of payment of indemnity, has been turned among some peoples by the influence of the white man into a system of actual sale of the woman. Among others, owing to the restrictive efforts of missionaries, the indemnity has been abolished with the result that instead of being a contract between two groups and a fairly permanent union, marriage has now become a matter of unorganized individual linkage, often of a merely temporary nature. Thus the social disintegration due to interference has disturbed the system of morality. In primitive law the relative nature of offences was pointed out, acts which are considered as crimes in one society not being punished as such in others. The imposition of a rigid system of legal penalties by white law, without regard to native custom, does not tend so much to prevent the commission of such acts as to cause concealment of them when committed. The practice of surreptitious appeal to witch-doctors in South Africa was cited as an instance. This comprehensive and eminently lucid survey of the problem of the application of anthropology to administrative and other contacts with native peoples concluded with a reference to the need for more field-workers in Papua and the Mandated Territory of New Guinea to study the native culture there, so that the government of these people may be founded on a basis of scientific knowledge. Mr. J. W. Bleakley, Chief Protector of Aborigines for Queensland, followed with a paper " Can Our Aborigines be Preserved ? " He drew the important distinction between the natives still in their primitive state, almost out of touch with civilization, maintaining their old tribal life, and those who in contact with the European have been deprived of their former mode of life and largely de-tribalized. The treatment to be</page><page sequence="2">248 REPORTS AND PROCEEDINGS adopted for their preservation must vary according to the circumstances. For the more primitive a policy of comparative isolation is advised, under the minimum of protective supervision ; for those in dependence on the white man, a benevolent control, with encouragement to the adoption of settled economic pursuits, especially agriculture. People of mixed blood should be allowed to remain as far as possible with their aboriginal relatives, to whose mode of life they nearly always appear to be more closely adapted. Instances were given in sympathetic manner where aborigines appear to have responded satisfactorily to tactful management. The session of Monday, ist June, was opened by Mr. F. E. Williams, M.A., Govern- ment Anthropologist of Papua, who read a paper on " Rock Carvings and Paintings in Papua." Illustrating the subject by a number of lantern slides, rubbings and sketches, he described the petrographs and paintings of Sugeri district, behind Port Moresby, and of certain villages in the D'Entrecasteaux group. Conventional designs, including an apparent sexual symbol, predominated in the former area, while in the latter are found, in particular, a number of interesting anthropomorphic figures. Little is known of the meaning or the object of these engravings. A paper by Mr. D. F. Thomson, read by the President, " A Culture-Hero Myth from Cape York Peninsula," described some aspects of the myths and ceremonial life of a very unusual type of Australian people. The lizard-skin drums and masked dancers of their initiation rites suggest some cultural affiliation with Papua. Miss Ursula McConnel, B.A., described " Totemic Stones in Cape York Peninsula," with photographs, demonstrating the existence of increase cults among the Wik-Munkan and adjacent tribes. The totems represented by stones are sometimes arranged in family groups. A paper on " Personal Names among the Tiwi of Melville and Bathurst Islands," by Mr. C. W. M. Hart, M.A., read by Dr. Raymond Firth, revealed an interesting system of Australian nomenclature. Each individual of the Tiwi has several names, allotted by the father and other paternal relatives, and owing to a taboo on names associated with the dead readjustment is constantly taking place. Other words of similar sound are also taboo, but the needs of social intercourse, which might otherwise be extremely hampered, are met by the existence of a sacred as well as the ordinary language. This acts as a reservoir of terms which can be drawn upon as a supplement in accordance with certain rules. A paper by Mr. Gerhardt Laves, M.A., " A Preliminary Grammar of the Kum- baingeri Language," which analyzed the processes of word formation, and discussed the principle of suffixion, was then presented. On Tuesday, 2nd June, Miss Camilla H. Wedgwood read a paper " The Nature and Functions of Secret Societies." The difference between ostensible and latent function of such associations was pointed out, with a broad survey of the various types and the conditions of membership. The importance of the secret society as an element of culture was indicated, with reference to its relation to the system of rank and government and the economic organization. Dr. Raymond Firth read a paper on " Chieftainship in Tikopia, Solomon Islands,"</page><page sequence="3">REPORTS AND PROCEEDINGS 249 in which the privileges and authority of the chiefs in this Polynesian community were dis- cussed, and their function in law and government. It was shown that the power of the chief, though absolute in theory, is conditioned to a large extent by the influence of the executive officials, and of public sentiment. Mrs. M. M. Banks dealt with an aspect of " Basque Folk-lore," describing the Corpus Christi procession in the Pyrennees, and indicating how the Church there had absorbed into its ceremonies a number of elements of the old pagan ritual. Mrs. Ernest Scott read a paper on " Javanese Music." The two systems of slendro and pelog, the former being more akin to our diatonic, were described, and examples of each were given by gramophone records of considerable interest. Javanese music employs a great number of scales, in the neighbourhood of three hundred, in contrast to our own, which amount to less than four dozen, and is highly organized, being by no means primitive in character. A series of lantern slides illustrated the type of native orchestra and the variety of instruments in use. The meeting of the Section was concluded by framing a recommendation, to be forwarded through the Association to the Queensland Government, that every endeavour be made to preserve a record of the languages and culture of the aborigines in the State, and that the Government be asked to grant its assistance to this end. It is a matter of congratulation for Anthropology that at the General Council Meeting on 28th May it was resolved to invite Sir Hubert Murray, Lieutenant-Governor of Papua, to accept the position of President of the Association at the next meeting at Sydney in August 193 1.</page></plain_text>
