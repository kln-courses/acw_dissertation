ANTHONY COLLINS AND THE QUESTION OF ATHEISM IN THE EARLY PART OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY By David Berman Department of Philosophy, Trinity College, Dublin (Communicated by J. F. M. Lydon, m.r.i.a.) [Received, 8 October, 1974. Read, 28 April, 1975. Published, 19 September, 1975.] Abstract The primary object of this paper is to argue, in opposition to modern scholarly opinion, that Anthony Collins (1676-1729) was not a deist but a speculative atheist?perhaps the earliest in Britain. The case is made specific ally against James O'Higgins' recent study, Anthony Collins, the man and his works. Some of the problems involved in identifying atheism in the eighteenth century are explored; and an attempt is made to determine the form (or forms) which Collins' atheism took. Anthony Collins, like many controversial figures, was called by a variety of names. Among them were "infidel", "deist", " free-thinker ", "minute philosopher ", " atheist " and e&lt; man of matter "; and one of the aims of this paper is to determine which of these names best suits Collins. Another aim, connected with the first, is to comment on the first full-length scholarly study of Collins: Father James O'Higgins* Anthony Collins, the man and his works (The Hague 1970). Although Collins was regarded by his contemporaries as one of the formidable theological-philosophical writers, his life and works have since received less attention than they deserve. One of the reasons for this neglect is probably that the work for which he is best known is one of his worst, namely, the once notorious Discourse of free-thinking (1713), a book that drew strong criticism from Swift, Bentley, Hoadley, Berkeley and Steele. But however Collins* neglect may be explained, Father O'Higgins is to be congratulated for his lucid pioneer study. He has covered a great deal of ground, and presented us with a sober and balanced portrait of the many-sided Collins. He has also thrown light on those men, books and movements which most likely influenced Collins, as well as sketching the backgrounds of the now obscure controversies in which Collins often played a leading role. I. The deist interpretation My first, and perhaps primary, reservation about O'Higgins' picture of Collins is that it is too balanced, too sober. The original, I shall maintain, is deeper, more radical and more exciting than O'Higgins' portrait suggests. For O'Higgins, Collins is to be seen somewhere on the border between very Low-church Christian ity and Deism. The tendency of Collins' thought, according to O'Higgins, is PROC. R.I.A., VOL. 75, SECT. C [E]</page><page sequence="2">86 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy away from revelation and organised religion and towards a reasoned belief in a very few theological doctrines. " He believed in God and in a future life."1 In his account of Collins' various works, O'Higgins carries on a running debate with himself about the extent of Collins' allegiance to a watered-down Christian ity, on the one hand, and pure Deism, on the other. At times one is unsure as to whether it is Collins who is uncertain of his position, or O'Higgins who is uncertain of Collins' position. For example, in commenting on the Discourse of free thinking, O'Higgins asserts that " Taken at its face value it seems to be an extreme anti-clerical protestant insistence on private judgement" (pp. 88-9). O'Higgins then, however, asks: Was this his true position ? A good deal of what he wrote [in the Dis course] can be interpreted as the writing of an anti-clerical protestant, insisting on private judgement for the laity. A few other passages . . , seem to imply a bias against Christianity itself, or at least against Revelation (p. 89) Taking up the question again in a later chapter, O'Higgins says: His position is perhaps most truly seen, not simply in an anti-Christian camp, but as placed in the debated ground where left-wing protestantism shaded off into absolute unbelief. His attitude was ambivalent. He could still practise as a member of the Church of England and be genuinely indignant at those who considered him dishonourable and hypocritical in so doing. But his religion was in no way supernatural (p. 199). Finally, in the last chapter, he states that Collins " was just on or just over the fringe of Christianity." But this is immediately followed by a note of uncertainty : " In spite of his books against Revelation and his defence of natural religion, it is doubtful if he had ever really analysed and defined his position " (p. 234).2 But, whatever position Collins really held, O'Higgins is entirely confident of one thing: Collins was not an atheist. For example: " Collins himself never aban doned his belief in God . . ." (p. 15); and the Discourse " poses the question of Collins' real position, which, whatever it was, was not that of the atheism with which Bentley credited him " (p. 81) ; for similar statements see pp. 22, 74, 76, 221, 234-5. O'Higgins* often-repeated judgement that Collins was not an atheist is no doubt based on the many, apparently straightforward, statements which Collins makes to that effect throughout his wTritings. II. Collins' atheism: the external evidence But against O'Higgins' judgement, I shall try to show that there is consider able evidence?of both an internal and external nature?that Collins was very far from a watered-down Christianity or Deism, but was, in fact, a strong-minded 1 O'Higgins, Anthony Collins, the man and his works, p. 234; all quotations from, or references to, O'Higgins, will be to this work. I shall also be using the following editions, and abbreviated titles, of Collins' works: An essay concerning the use of reason in propositions (2nd ed. London 1709)?Essay ; An answer to Mr. Clarke's third defence of his letter to Mr. Dodwell (2nd ed. London 1711)?Answer ; A vindication of the divine attributes, in some remarks on his grace the Archbishop of Dublin's sermon intituled Divine predestination . . . (London 1710)?Vindication; A discourse of free-thinking (London 1713)?Discourse; A philosophical inquiry concerning human liberty (3rd ed. 1735)?Philosophical inquiry ; A discourse on the grounds and reasons of the Christian religion (London 1724)?Grounds. 2 Also see pp. 81-4, 173, 191-2, and 234-5.</page><page sequence="3">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism 87 atheist, with a proof for the non-existence of God. I do not claim to be able to prove this. But I do hope to show that it is highly probable. As even the possibility seems to have been ignored?not only by O'Higgins, but all scholars of Deism?there is surely a need at least to present the evidence, and make a case. The external evidence for this case is drawn primarily from the writings of George Berkeley. In the Advertisement to Alciphron or the minute philosopher (London 1732), Berkeley asserts that he "is well assured, that one of the most noted writers against Christianity in our Times, declared, he had found out a Demonstration against the Being of a God". This charge is again made in dialogue one, section 12, and also in dialogue four, section 16. In both of these places the deviser of the proof is aptly given the name Diagoras, no doubt after Diagoras the Melian, perhaps the earliest atheist. The passage in dialogue one, in which the accusation is made, consists of a catalogue of the " discoveries " of free-thinking. The catalogue concludes with the following : But the Master-piece and finishing Stroke [of modern free-thinking] is a learned Anecdote of our great Diagoras, containing a Demonstration against the Being of God, which it is conceived the Public is not yet ripe for. But I am assured by some judicious Friends who have seen it, that it is clear as Daylight, and will do a world of Good, at one blow demolishing the whole System of Religion (sect, 12). It is quite certain, for various reasons, that Berkeley meant Diagoras to stand for a particular person, and that this person was Collins. By establishing this, we will also be able to see more fully the extent of Berkeley's charge. In dialogue four we learn more about Diagoras. He is described as " a Man of much Reading and Inquiry," who had discovered, that once upon a time the most profound and speculative Divines finding it impossible to reconcile the Attributes of God, taken in the common Sense, or in any known Sense, with human reason, and the Appearances of things, taught that the words Knowledge, Wisdom, Goodness, and such like, when spoken of the Deity, must be understood in a quite different sense, from what they signify in the vulgar Acceptation, or from any thing that we can form a Notion of, or conceive (sect. 16). Diagoras is said to have been " wonderfully delighted " with this way of under standing the divine nature, because of its atheistic implications. For if the new sense is such that we can form no notion or conception of the divine nature, then the term " God " is virtually deprived of any cognitive meaning. Indeed, if such a conception, or non-conception, of God were widely held there would have been little reason for Diagoras to have taken such " pains to find out a Demon stration that there was no God" (sect. 16). For such a conception denies the existence of God, while merely retaining the name. In his account and criticism of this version of negative theology (in Alciphron IV, 16-22) Berkeley has two targets in view: an unwary friend of religion, and a wary enemy. The unwary friend is Archbishop William King, who, in his influential Divine predestination and fore-knowledge, consistent with the freedom of man*s will : a sermon (Dublin 1709), developed the theory summarised above.8 8 For this identification, see chap. 5 of Meaning and method in Berkeley's theology (1972) an unpublished Ph.D. thesis, by the present writer under the supervision of Dr. A. A. Luce; it is in the Library, Trinity College, Dublin. In that study, King's theory is examined and described as " theological representationaUsm ". The same theory was held by Peter Browne, Bishop of Cork, who may have been Berkeley's secondary target in Alciphron TV.</page><page sequence="4">88 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy The wary enemy was Collins, who attacked King's Sermon of 1709 in a vigorous pamphlet entitled A Vindication of the divine attributes, in some remarks on . . . the Archbishop of Dublins Sermon . . . (London 1710). Collins' interest in King's Sermon did not end there. Three years later, in the Discourse, he returned to King's conception o? God. Here he juxtaposed it with Archbishop Tillotson's very opposite and more anthropomorphic conception of God. The apparent intention of this sceptical juxtaposition was to cast doubt on accepting a theological doctrine on the authority of a churchman : for here are two illustrious archbishops disagreeing with one another on a fundamental doctrine of religion. Berkeley, however, suspected that Collins had a more sinister motive. He expressed his suspicions in a work published one year after Alciphron. In this work, the Theory of vision vindicated and explained (London 1733), he also goes some way towards identifying Collins with Diagoras; for Collins' atheism is associated, like Diagoras', with an interest in King's version of negative theology: the author of a book intituled A discourse of free-thinking, who, having insinuated his infidelity from men's various pretenses and opinions concerning revealed rehgion, in like manner appears to insinuate his atheism from the differing notion of men concerning the nature and attributes of God,4 particularly as it hath been misunderstood and mis interpreted by some of late years. Such is the ill effect of untoward defences and explanations of our faith; and such advantage do incautious friends give its enemies. . . . instead of causing scandal to good men and triumph to atheists [such friends should] return to speak of God and his attributes in the style of other Christians, allowing that knowledge and wisdom do, in the proper sense of words, belong to God. . . .5 It is not necessary, however, to depend on circumstantial evidence in identify ing Collins with Diagoras?the inventor of an atheistic demonstration. We have quite direct and explicit evidence from Samuel Johnson, Berkeley's American friend and first president of King's College, now Columbia University. In A Letter to Mr. Jonathan Dickenson .... (Boston 1747), Johnson remarks that Collins (&lt; gave out in conversation, as I was informed by one present, that he had found a demonstration against the being of a God."5a That Berkeley was the " one present " is made apparent not only by Johnson's citation of the Advertisement of Alciphron as support for his remark, but by the following account in the Life of Samuel Johnson, D.D. (New York 1824), by Johnson's biographer, Thomas B. Chandler: In the advertisement prefixed to these dialogues [Alciphron] the author affirms, that he was " well assured one of the most noted writers against Christianity had declared, he had found out a demonstration against the being of a god." Mr. Johnson, in one of his visits to the Dean [Berkeley] 4 Compare Alciphron 1.8, where Berkeley traces, and explains, the development of free thinking. It starts from latitudinarianism and ends with atheism, progressing by continual cancelling of the differences in theological positions, and a retaining of that which is held in common; eventually nothing is held in common. This is the beginning of atheism, and the end of religion. 5 The works of George Berkeley, edited by Luce and Jessop; vol. i, p. 254; hereafter referred to as Works. f?a Samuel Johnson, his career and writings (New York 1929), eds. H. and C. Schneider, vol. iii, p. 191 ; see also Prof. Jessop's valuable introduction to Alciphron, in Works iii, p. 23.</page><page sequence="5">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism 89 conversing with him on the subject of the work then in hand [viz. Alciphron] was more particularly informed by him?that he himself (the Dean) had heard this strange declaration, while he was present in one of the deistical clubs, in the pretended character of a learner?that Collins was the man who made it?. . ." (pp. 57-8).6 There can be no doubt, then, that Diagoras is meant by Berkeley to stand for Collins. It should be noted at the outset, however, that Berkeley is well aware that the charge of atheism was repudiated by Collins, as well as being generally denied, especially by the latter's friends : if they [the free-thinkers] own it [i.e., being infidels and atheists] in their conversation, if their ideas imply it, if their ends are not answered but by supposing it, if their leading author hath pretended to demonstrate atheism, but thought fit to conceal his demonstration from the public; if this was known in their clubs, and yet the author was followed, and represented to the world as a believer of natural religion; if these things are so (and I know them to be so) . . ."7 It will be necessary to examine more particularly Berkeley's testimony?which is largely completed by the above quotation; but I shall first produce a further piece of external evidence for Collins' atheism. Among the many interesting memoranda made by another of Berkeley's close friends, John Percival, Earl of Egmont, is the following note : Of Collins Esq. deceased Dec. 1729 . . . [he] is a Speculative Atheist and has been for many years, as he owned to ?rchbald Hutchison Esq. who told it to Dr. Dod M.D. and he to me.8 III. Difficulties in identifying atheism We have, then, two quite definite statements that Collins was a speculative atheist. Admittedly, both witnesses, as it were, claim to know this not from any written or published work by Collins, but from word of mouth ; in Berkeley's case, from Collins' own mouth. However, if word of mouth was the only means available to testify the fact, then we can hardly demand more. Moreover, if it is ascertained that the charge is true, and Collins was an atheist, then this will mean more than a mere change in label. It should, and must, I think, have an effect on our reading of Collins' writings. For if the fact is established, we will be obliged to look in his works for hints and suggestions which might reveal the form his atheism took ; and we will also pay close attention to those " ideas [as Berkeley puts it, which] imply it." 6 The meeting must have taken place some time after January 1713?Berkeley's arrival in London?and probably before 25 April 1713, which is the date of one of Berkeley's Guardian essays in which he strongly suggests that Collins is an atheist; see Works, vol. vii, p. 189. The essay is about an imaginary visit to Collins' pineal gland. 7 See Theory of vision vindicated, in Works, vol. i, p. 255. 8 In the British Museum, Add. MS. 47126, f. 166. In The religious, rational, and moral conduct of Mathew Tindal, LL.D. late Fellow of All Souls College in Oxford (London 1735); the author, who styles himself " a member of the same College " as Tindal, speaks of " Dr. Dodd, a very sober, and pious, and worthy physician, formerly one of the fellows of the College . . ." (p. 26).</page><page sequence="6">9o Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy That there is a hidden meaning or message in the writings of some of the early eighteenth-century free-thinkers is definitely suggested by Collins' acquaint ance, John Toland. This comes out in Toland's essay " Clidophorus," which makes up a part of his Tetradymus (London 1720). This essay deals with the esoteric and exoteric distinction. Although Toland examines the esoteric, or, as he sometimes calls it, the " internal doctrine," mostly in the context of ancient writers, he affirms that his contemporaries, also, are obliged to say one thing but mean something else. Especially on religious topics some of the moderns, as well as the ancients, have an esoteric doctrine. " I have [he writes] more than once hinted that the external and internal doctrines are as much in use as ever . . ." (p. 94).8a Again: "In fine, daily experience sufficiently evinces, that there is no discovering, at least no declaring of TRUTH in most places, but at the hazard of a man's reputation, employment or life " (p. 67). My thesis, then, is that for prudential reasons Collins held back from explicitly or exoterically publishing his atheism. There are a number of factors, both from Collins' life and times, which add considerable weight to this hypothesis. As O'Higgins shows (chapter viii) Collins had a genuine interest in his position as a county justice and treasurer, which he conscientiously fulfilled. Hence he would have been reluctant to put either his " reputation " or " employment " in jeopardy. But it would have been extremely awkward for an atheistic magistrate to take oaths. Indeed, " application was said to have been made by [William Whiston, one of Collins' theological opponents] to the Lord Chancellor King to remove Mr. Collins from the Commission of Peace, but without success." The reason for the legal action, according to Whiston, was that Collins had " taken superabundant care not to be suspected of believing so much as the Apostle's creed, or the Books of either the Old or New Testament, or indeed any Divine Providence at all : Yet [Whiston goes on to charge] does he [Collins] claim a right to be admitted to take an oath upon the Bible . . . and in virtue thereof is in Commission of the oath. . ."9 The time was hardly right for Collins to avow his atheism, when as late as 1729 his fellow free-thinker, Thomas Woolston, was sentenced to prison for the alleged blasphemy in his Discourses on the miracles of our saviour (London 1727-9) ; and this was no token punishment, for Woolston died in prison.10 It would, then, have been most imprudent and uncharacteristic for an urbane country gentleman, such as Collins, to have risked his reputation, to say nothing of his neck. By a law of 9 and 10 William III, chap. 32, those who " impugned either the orthodox doctrine of the Trinity, or the supernatural character of Christianity . . . [were] disabled, upon the first conviction, from holding any 8a In his Pantheisticon (1720) Toland offers an intriguing (although questionable) account of societies of pantheists, flourishing especially in London, that make use of the esoteric/ exoteric distinction. 9 Quoted in the article " Collins " in A general, historical and critical dictionary (London 1734-41), vol. iv, p. 402; this edition of Bayle's Dictionary was edited by Thomas Birch, among others. A great number of lives were added to it; I shall refer to it as Birch's Dictionary. One can understand Whiston's annoyance at Collins' apparent duplicity, since Whiston gave up his professorship at Cambridge rather than subscribe to articles in which he did not believe. Lord Chancellor King, it may be noted, was the nephew of Locke, and through him a friend of Collins. 10 Even in the polite Spectator, we read: " In my opinion, a solemn judicial Death is too great an honour for an Atheist . . /'; no. 389, 27 May 1712; by E. Budgell.</page><page sequence="7">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism 91 ecclesiastical, civil, or military office. . . ."n So, as Toland remarked, " consider ing how dangerous it is made to tell the truth, 'tis difficult to know when any man declares his real sentiments of things."12 IV. The existence of atheists: opposing tendencies There is, however, another side to the question of whether Collins was an atheist. In the first part of the eighteenth century it was extremely common for a theological writer to accuse his opponent of atheism. The suggestion of atheism was a fairly popular way of discrediting the opposing point of view. Moreover, theologians in Collins' day did not often make the distinction between views that tended towards socinianism, deism, or atheism, and views which were socinian, deistic or atheistic. For polemical purposes, grey often became black. It is also not uncommon to find a socinian doctrine being referred to as deistic and a deistic one as atheistic. Hence one must be careful about trusting the judgment of eighteenth-century theologians on their contemporaries. And it may well be such caution which lies behind O'Higgins' frequent and off-hand dismissals of the charges of atheism levelled against Collins by, for example, Bentley (p. 81). That there was an obsessive tendency to shout atheism on the barest grounds cannot be denied.13 But one can hardly believe that Berkeley was in the grips of such an obsessive tendency in his informing his clerical friend Johnson that Collins had claimed to have found a demonstration against the existence of God. What polemical purpose could be served ? Nor, I think, would such a tendency apply to Percival's private note. Admittedly, the weight of my case?thus far? for Collins' atheism depends very much on how reliable and truthful Berke^'s testimony is. Yet what more reliable witness could one find in che whole of the eighteenth century ? All the evidence that we have strongly indicates that Berkeley?who was, according to Pope, given every virtue under heaven?is an unimpeachable witness. There is a final piece of external evidence that should be examined. It is from the second edition of the Biographia Britannica (London 1778-1793), edited by Andrew Kippis. This edition of the Biographia does not seem to be as well known as the first edition, perhaps because it was left incomplete, reaching only the fifth volume and the letter " F."14 It is one of the comparatively few relevant 11 See W. E. H. Leckv, A history of England in the eighteenth century (London 1919), vol. 1, p. 358. 12 Tetradymus, p. 95. In An essay towards preventing the ruin of Great Britain (London 1721), Berkeley says that " the public safety requireth that the avowed contemners of all religion should be severely chastised . . ." {in Works, vol. vi, pp. 70-1). 13 Two books which clearly illustrate the obsessive tendency are Some discourses upon Dr. Burnett and Dr. Tillotson . . . (London 1695) by George Hickes (see pp. 39-40, 48); and Spinoza reviv'd (London 1709) by William Carroll, with a preliminary discourse by Hickes. A brief extract from Hickes' discourse may serve as a sample of the whole: " one of the Deists, or Atheists, so little difference there is between them. . . .". 14 An indication of the obscurity of this edition is that in the fifth volume (1793), in the article on Mrs. Mary Delany, there is an interesting letter by Swift to Mrs Delany, dated 6 August 1735, which is not included in any edition of Swift's letters; see p. 89 note.</page><page sequence="8">gz Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy texts missing from O'Higgins' excellent bibliography.15 Kippis added a few things to the first-edition account of the article on Collins. The following is of most interest for our discussion : It has not been uncommon to connect his [Collins*] name with authors of atheistic principles; but this is doing a manifest injustice to his character. A worthy and respectable clergyman put a paper into our hands, contain ing two anecdotes which represent Mr. Collins as an Atheist, and as having introduced a young gentleman to a club of such persons in London. The paper, by some accident, has been mislaid. . . .16 It is curious that Kippis' judgment, i.e., that Collins was not an atheist, is made not on account of, but in spite of, the evidence he mentions. One way of accouncing for this is as follows. Some theologians, at least in the eighteenth century, were reluctant to believe that any serious thinker could be an atheist. Thomas Broughton, for example, in his Bioliotheca historico-sacra (London 1737) claimed that " there is room to doubt, whether there ever have been thinking men, who have actually reasoned themselves into disbelief of a Deity " (vol. i, p. 97). William Baxter was also "of the opinion that there never were any persons of that character," i.e., speculative atheists.17 Those apparent speculat ive atheists were, he maintained, either (1) asserting atheism as a sceptical possibility (e.g., Protagoras), (2) making believe that they were atheists in order to give themselves airs, or appear novel, or (3) impetuously claiming to be atheists without really knowing what they were doing (e.g., Diagoras). Men who fit into one of these classes might be called " unthinking atheists," in contradistinction to " speculative atheists." Unthinking atheism, one might say, has a cause but not a reason. Samuel Clarke in his Boyle lectures undertakes to deal only with speculative atheists, as he is appealing purely to reason.18 Hence, along with the tendency to see atheism on the merest grounds, there is an opposite, repressive tendency. It is interesting that Collins is aware of both tendencies. In the Discourse he makes much of the obsessive tendency, and 15 For the identification of a serious omission, however, see the present writer's "Anthony Collins' essays in the Independent Whig"?-forthcoming in the fournal of the history of philosophy. 16 Biographica Brittanica (London 1789), vol. iv, p. 27. It is a pity that Kippis mislaid the anecdotes, for we have very little information about the free-thinking clubs. Berkeley refers to them in his Guardians, and in J. H. Monck's Life of Bentley (London 1830) Collins is said to have been at the centre of a club which met at the Grecian coffee-house, near Temple-bar (p. 268). One meets the suggestion that some of the free-thinking books, e.g., Toland's Christianity not mysterious (1696), were written by a number of men in free-thinking clubs; and there is one instance known to me where this was, to some extent, admitted. In the preface to a later deistic work, The moral philosopher (1737), the author, Thomas Morgan, says that the book arose from discussions " many years ago by a Society, or Club of Gentlemen in the Country, who met once a Fortnight at a Gentleman's House in a pleasant retired village, with a Design to enter impartially into the Consideration of the Grounds and Principles of Religion in General ..." (pp. vii-viii). 17 See Birch's Dictionary, vol. iii, p. 60. 18 See A discourse concerning the being and attributes of God (6th ed. London 1725), pp. 2-3; Clarke claims that the two causes of (unthinking) atheism are (1) stupidity and ignorance and (2) immorality (p. 2). The term " practical atheist" was commonly used to describe someone who, although he professed a belief in the existence of God, acted as though God did not exist. The immoral behaviour of the practical atheist showed that he did not really believe in God. So, e.g. breaking promises might be either a cause of unthinking atheism or an expression of practical atheism; and practical atheism itself would be regarded as the very probable effect of speculative atheism.</page><page sequence="9">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism 93 obviously took some pleasure in recording that such distinguished writers as Locke, Tillotson and Cudworth had been called atheists (pp. 84-5). But he is also aware of the repressive tendency; for again in the Discourse he remarks that "many divines maintain that there never was a real Atheist in the world " (p. 104) .^ But why should theologians, we might ask, be disposed to disbelieve in the existence of atheists ? There are a number of reasons. If no thinking person could seriously be an atheist, then atheism need not have to be taken very seriously. Furthermore, the actual existence of atheists?especially speculative ones?presents an obvious difficulty for those who want to use the argument from universal consent as a justification for believing in the existence of God. Berkeley, also, was well aware of the repressive tendency, and its danger. In the Advertisement to Alciphron he writes: " There may be a Reader who shall think the Character of Atheist agrees with none [of the free-thinkers]; But though it hath been often said, there is no such thing as a speculative Atheist ; yet we must allow, there are several Atheists who pretend to Speculation."20 We must be guarded, then, about refusing to believe that there were atheists; and we should, I contend, be prepared to read between the lines. In an age where it could not openly be published, it had to be insinuated.21 That Collins, for one, had a hidden message, or internal doctrine, is asserted not only by Berkeley, but by others such as Dr. John Mitchell. In a letter to Professor Charles Mackie, dated 27 July, 1728, Mitchell says: " Colins [sic] and all that tribe are mere fools 19 David Hume seems to have been similarly aware of the two opposing tendencies, as we can see from the opening remarks in his Enquiry concerning human understanding, sect. xii. He there also poses a question, which has not, as far as I am aware, been answered: " There is not a greater number of philosophical reasonings [he writes] displayed upon any subject, than those, which prove the existence of a Deity, and refute the fallacies of Atheists; and yet the most religious philosophers still dispute whether any man can be so blinded as to be a speculative atheist. How shall we reconcile these contradictions ? " (Selby-Bigge edition, p. 148). Part of the answer to Hume's question is, I suggest, that something which is emotionally charged for a person or group (as atheism was and perhaps still is) is quite likely to produce opposite effects on a person or group. So, if I hate something I might either run away from it, or I might run for it, i.e., attack it: my reaction would depend on my personality and mood at the time. 20 This charge is warmly denied by the free-thinker, Lord Hervey, in his Some remarks on the Minute philosopher (2nd ed. London 1732) ; e.g., " there is not one Atheist in a million Free-thinkers, and perhaps not one atheist among them all . . ." (pp. 34-5), also see p. 62. One suspects, however, that Hervey protests too much. 21 As far as I am aware, there is no British writer in the seventeenth or early part of the eighteenth century who actually asserts, in print, that God does not exist. The denial is frequently made on behalf of philosophers, especially Epicurus, Hobbes and Spinoza; but they never denied the existence of God or gods. In the account of Tindal, mentioned above in note 8, the writer claims to have heard Tindal argue against the idea of God. " In com panies where he thought he was certain he could make free, he used to endeavour to make the notion of a God ridiculous. He used to argue upon this Head in the following manner: There cannot be two infinities. . . . And having laid down this indisputable Maxim, he went on to observe, that the notion which we had of God was, that he was an Infinite being; and that if any such being were supposed, it must follow, that there must be infinite space for him to be or subsist in ; and then it must follow, that there are two Infinities, which, he said, was a Contradiction ' ' (p. 25). The writer then adds, perhaps in the grip of the repressive tendency (see above), that " I do not tell you, Sir, that the Doctor did professedly, and in a blunt manner, endeavour to prove that there was no God ; no, Sir, even Dr. Tindal was not arrived at such a consummate Pitch of Impudence " (p. 26). The first public avowal of atheism by a British writer, as far as I have been able to determine, was by a William Hammon?in his An answer to Dr. Priestley*s Letters to a philosophical unbeliever, pt. I (1782). [El]</page><page sequence="10">94 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy and cowards to him [Woolston] \for they mask, as much as they can, what they say; but he never minces any expression whatsoever. . . ."2a I shall now try to look behind the mask. In doing this I shall be guided by the hypothesis that what we will find is a speculative atheist. V. The atheistic argument from the eternity of matter We are naturally very much in the dark as to the precise nature of Collins' atheistic demonstration, since it was never published. One suspects, however, that it was among the manuscripts that Demaizeaux inherited from Collins. If this suspicion is correct, then it might go a considerable way towards explaining why Demaizeaux became so upset after he sold or gave the manuscripts to Collins' wife; and why he thought that he had " betrayed the trust " of his friend, as he expressed it, when he learned that some of the manuscripts?the " several important pieces "?had been lent to the Bishop of London, Edmund Gibson.23 It was Gibson, one should note, who destroyed the manuscript of the second part of Christianity as old as creation (London 1730), by Collins' friend and fellow free-thinker, Matthew Tindal.24 Gibson was also in close touch with Berkeley in the early 1730's.25 Laying this conjecture aside, however, let us examine Collins' writings for hints or insinuations of atheism or, as Berkeley puts it, those ideas that " imply it." This need not be as difficult a task as one might at first imagine. For although we are looking for something which is hidden, there would be little point in a writer hiding it so deeply that few or no one could find it. On the contrary, there is much evidence (some of it we have seen above) which suggests that the esoteric message was hidden only deeply enough to protect the free thinking authors, e.g., from legal prosecution. But, as Bishop Gastrell, one of Collins' very early critics, remarked: "every Body understands their meaning.*'26 And, indeed, there would hardly be much point in publishing if some persons did not understand the intended meaning, and were not able to be influenced by it. 22 See Historical Manuscript Commission Report, Laing II (London 1925), p. 223; my italics. 23 This strange incident is described in I. Disraeli's Curiosities of literature (London 1858) " Des Maizeaux and Anthony Collins' mss.", vol. 3, pp. 13 fi; the relevant letters are con veniently reprinted here by Disraeli. 24 See Sir Leslie Stephen, History of English thought in the eighteenth century (London 1902), iii, 43. 25 See two letters of Gibson to Berkeley, printed in A. C. Fraser's The works of George Berkeley (Oxford 1871), vol. iv, pp. 238 and 244. Both letters were written in the middle 1730's, and they show that Berkeley and Gibson conferred on the problem of infidels and free-thinkers. For example, in the second letter of 7 February 1735-6, Gibson writes: " Here we have now little trouble from professed infidels, but a great deal from semi infidels. ..." One wonders whether Gibson either showed or ovon mentioned to Berkeley the atheistic proof. Speaking of it in Alciphron 1.12, one dialogist: " I am assured by some judicious friends who have seen it. . .". In the same passage the proof is called " a learned Anecdote ", which suggests that it was written out, although not published (see Johnson's Dictionary). Berkeley met Gibson in London?-in 1731/2?before the publication of Alciphron. 26 See Principles of deism, set in a clear light (London 1708), p. 32.</page><page sequence="11">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism 95 Let us begin our search of Collins' writings with one of his most philosophical pieces, his Answer to Mr. Clarke's third defence (2nd ed., London 1711). In this last of four pamphlets against Clarke, Collins examines such questions as the distinction between adequate and inadequate ideas (pp. 4-14), personal identity (pp. 56-66), the nature of substance (pp. 68-72), and the creation of matter ex nihilo (pp. 75-79). This last topic will now be considered. In his influential Boyle lectures Clarke inferred, according to Collins, from the assumption that there exist " two beings of different kinds " that God created matter (Answer, p. 75). Collins argues, however, that even if we grant that there are two different beings, it might be that neither created the other, for both may have existed from eternity. There is, at any rate, nothing in the assumption that implies that one of the two existing beings created the other. Hence creation ex nihilo is a problem for those theologians, like Clarke and the other Boyle lecturers, who believe that the question of the existence of God is really a question, " which otherwise [as Collins mischievously notes] would be with few any Question at all" (p. 76). Collins, then, rather ostentatiously asserts that " out of the inclination I have to see the foundation of all religion established on demonstration. ... I shall conclude this debate with an essay, showing a way how to demonstrate the existence of God. ..." (p. 76). In order to do this, and answer atheists such as Strato, "the Literati in China", and particularly Spinoza?who has " endeavoured to reduce Atheism into a system "?it is absolutely necessary, Collins claims, to " prove the creation of matter ex nihilo ; or which is all one, that matter is not a self-existent being " (p. 77). For if matter " be allowed to be a self-existent being, we Christians who believe in one self-existing being, are obliged by our reasoning to allow matter all possible perfections. . . . Because it is from the idea of self-existence, that we infer the perfections of God " (p. 78). In short, the theist's logic leads?once matter is allowed to be a substance?to pantheistic materialism. On the other hand, Collins suggests, one might maintain that there are two self-existing beings, namely, spirit and matter. But if this is allowed, it will be plausible to argue that there are?for all we know?three, or indeed any number of, self existing beings. We will then have a world in which there is, in effect, a plurality of gods. The question is: If matter, which evidently exists, is not sufficient, then why should two beings be sufficient ? Thus, if we are to withstand pantheistic materialism, on the one hand, and polytheism, on the other hand, we must, Collins contends, give some sense to or? in his terminology?" have an idea of the creation of matter ex nihilo " (p. 78). Having shown the crucial importance of doing this, and the dire consequences if we cannot, Collins then, surprisingly, goes on to tell his reader that to get an Idea of Creation, or a Conception how Matter might begin to exist, we must (as the incomparable Mr. Locke, Essay ofH. U. B.4. c.10. ? 18 with great modesty expresses himself) emancipate our selves from vulgar Notions, and raise our Thoughts as far as they can reach to a closer contempla tion of things ; and then we may be able to aim at some dim and seeming Conception, how Matter might at first be made, and begin to exist by the Power of the Eternal First Being. But as he thought that this would lead him too far from the Notions, on which the Philosophy now in the World is</page><page sequence="12">96 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy built, and that it would not be pardonable to deviate so far from them ; so the small compass of this Treatise, and the great labour of shewing the falshood of so many received Prejudices and Opinions as is necessary to give an Idea of Creation ex nihilo, must make it more pardonable in me (who own my self to be infinitely below him in Abilities) if I omit for the present so useful a Design, or should leave it intirely to some of those Gentlemen that are appointed annually to preach at the Lecture founded by the Honourable Robert Boyle (p. 79). This is surely a most surprising conclusion I After promising a proof for the existence of God, Collins presents the reader with what is, in effect, an argument against being able to prove the existence of God. Admittedly, he does say that although " demonstration is thought so necessary in the case ... I should think probability enough to determine any man " (pp. 76-7). But it is not at all clear what he means, or could mean, by "probability". Certainly he would not hold that, while we cannot form an idea of creation ex nihilo, or the non-existence of matter, it is nonetheless probable that God did create matter in this way. Because, for Collins, it is strictly meaningless to speak about something if we can form no idea of " it." So I am apt to suspect that the talk of probability was mere dust thrown up to obscure the atheistic argument and conclusion. But the dust did not stop one early reviewer of Collins' Answer to Clarke from describing Collins' discussion of the creation of matter as " bare-faced Atheism".27 This is not the only place in Collins' writings where, claiming to strike a blow against atheism, he succeeds in striking one for atheism. In the Philosophical inquiry concerning human liberty (3rd ed., London 1735), he defends determinism by pointing out that indeterminism provides the basis for Epicurean atheism, which holds that " chance may have produced an orderly system " (p. 53). This position, Collins asserts, is atheistic, and should be rejected. But what he does not point out is that the deterministic alternative for which he is arguing is at the heart of the far more formidable atheism of Spinoza. For Collins, as for Spinoza, God is a necessary being. But a being whose nature is necessary, or who must exist, cannot be free; and an unfree God is really no God. Collins does not say this openly. Rather he makes the point by quoting from Gilbert Burnet, Bishop of Sarum: "it is not easy [writes Burnet] to imagine how they [God's supposed free actions] should be one with the divine essence, to which necessary existence does most certainly belong " (p. 67). In other words, if God can act freely then he might have acted differently. But then His nature or essence might have been different, and if this is the case, his nature is not necessary but contingent. Hence " God " is necessary and not free (see pp. 66-7). Our suspicion that Collins accepted this Spinozistic Une of argument is enforced by the anecdote related by Chandler in his Life of Johnson, of which I quoted a portion above (pp. 88-9). After stating that it was Collins who claimed to have demonstrated atheism, Chandler concludes as follows: the demonstration was what he afterwards published, in an attempt to prove that every action is the effect of fate and necessity, in his book 27 Samuel Parker, Censura temporum : the good and evil tendencies of books, sermons, pamphlets . . . (London 1708), vol. i, no. iv, p. 117. The review runs from pp. 117-26; and, like all the reviews in this periodical, it is written in a loose dialogue form. It is not mentioned by O'Higgins.</page><page sequence="13">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism gj A Philosophical inquiry. . . And, indeed, could this point be once estab lished, that everything is produced by fate and necessity, it would naturally follow, that there is no God, or that he is a very useless and insignificant being, which amounts to the same thing (p. 58). VI. Second approach to Collins* atheism : his il vindication ,f of the divine attributes and Christian prophecies It seems to have been a part of Collins' general strategy to attack religion and Christianity through the eccentric theories of prominent, contemporary church-men and theologians. Thus we find him capitalising (1) on Henry Dodwell's odd theory that the soul is naturally mortal, but that by his grace God " immortalises " the infant's soul by baptism, (2) on Archbishop King's theory that we can as little believe that God is good or wise as that He has arms and is occasionally jealous, (3) on William Whiston's theory that the text of the Old Testament was corrupted by the Jews in their attempt to cast doubt on Jesus' fulfilment of the prophecies, and, as a part of the same controversy, (4) on W. Surenhusius' Rabbinical rules for finding in the Scriptures such meanings as could never be derived from any normal rules or procedures of interpretation. Now, by comparing Collins' attack on (2) King's theory with his criticism of the theories of (3) Whist on and (4) Surenhusius, we should be able to throw a good deal of light on the nature of Collins' atheism. Our discussion will also reveal how all-embracing his attack on religion is. In both of these contro versies?the first on our knowledge of the divine attributes, the second on the fulfilment of the prophecies?Collins identifies crucial problems for theism and Christianity, respectively. The theories which he attacks were designed to solve these problems. In his Vindication against King, Collins considers what may be called the Manichean problems. These fundamental problems had been recently raised again by Pierre Bayle, in his famous Historical and critical dictionary, from which Collins quotes at length on the classic problem: How can God be both omnipotent and all good, since there is evil in the world? (pp. 6-7). (Other problems are also mentioned, such as the one King specifically deals with : How can men have free-will if God knows everything that will happen ?) Bayle's solution to the Manichean problems was the " captivating the Understanding to the obedience of faith " (p. 10). But it is clear that Collins does not take Bayle's fideistic solution seriously, and he shows that the solution is not acceptable to the most distinguished theologians of the day (pp, 10-12). But if Bayle's solution is unacceptable, then how are the Manichean problems to be solved ? King's 1709 Sermon is, according to Collins, the latest attempt at a solution. He points out that King recognised that the standard theistic conception of God contains formidable internal difficulties, supporting this claim with a number of quotations from King, e.g., " if the Attributes of God are understood literally and in the same way as we find them in us, absurd and</page><page sequence="14">98 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy intolerable consequences will follow " (Vindication, p. 15). Now, King's solution to any conflict in the divine attributes is to deny that the attributes are like anything in man: human and divine goodness, for example, differ in kind, and not merely in degree. Hence, if we do not know what the divine goodness really is, we cannot know that it is in conflict with evil in the world, or with the attribute of omnipotence, of which we are, again, ignorant. In his Vindication Collins shows that King's solution will not work. If we have no proper or literal knowledge of the divine attributes, then we can only be saying when we speak of God that He is " rabba " (p. 25). But as " rabba " is meaningless, so must the concept of God be either meaningless, or, at the most, equivalent to " a Being that is a general Cause of Effects." But if the latter meaning is held, says Collins, " I see not why atheists should not come into the belief of such a Deity ..." (pp. 19-20). In short, King's theory renders the divine attributes invulnerable to attack, but at far too high a price; for it deprives the attributes of any determinate, cognitive meaning. Consequently, Collins contends, if King's theory were true, atheism would be unavoidable. Collins' opinion, as stated in the Vindication, is that King's theory is mis taken, and that atheism is avoidable. We do, he says, have literal knowledge of the divine attributes, such as goodness and wisdom. He writes: "Our conceptions indeed of those attributes do not reach the full extent of them as they are in God, but yet as far as our conceptions go, they correspond to the wisdom, goodness, holiness, justice, will and foreknowledge, of God" (p. 10). We have already considered a number of tl?ngs which should make us suspicious of this avowal; but let us, for the moment, work on the assumption that Collins did believe, in opposition to King, that we have literal knowledge of the divine attributes. Supposing he did, then what?we should ask?is the actual con clusion of the Vindication ? It is, simply, that there are very formidable, or insuperable, difficulties in the theistic conception of God?revealed by the Manichean problems?and that the lastest attempt to cope with, or solve, these difficulties, i.e., King's theory, has failed; for the medicine is as bad as the disease. But the disease remains ! So, as in the case of matter's creation ex nihilo, Collins calls attention to a fundamental problem for theism. He has done this, on the face of it, in the interest of theism: to prove the existence of God and to vindicate the divine attributes. But this, I believe, is the exoteric message. For he leaves us with what appears to be an insuperable problem. And for Collins that which appears to be a problem is a problem; and we must act on what appears to us to be true.27a In short, he has woken the patient up, not to give him his sleeping pill, but to remind him of his incurable illness. As the Vindication is, in my opinion, aimed at the heart of natural religion, so Collins' A Discourse on the grounds and reasons of the Christian religion (London 1724) is aimed directly against revealed religion, i.e., Christianity. Not only, -7a See Essay, pp. 4-14; for an examination o? this point, see the present writer's " Anthony Collins: his thought and writings " (sect. 3), to be published in Hermathena.</page><page sequence="15">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism 99 however, is the attack more direct than in the Vindication, but it is also less heavily disguised. Collins' fine of attack may be outlined in the following way : (1) The New Testament depends for its truth on its connection with the Old Testament. (2) That connection is the fulfilment of the Old Testament prophecies by Jesus. (3) It is necessary, therefore, that the prophecies relating to a messiah in the Old Testament were indeed fulfilled by Jesus, as described in the New Testament. (4) But there are serious difficulties in (3), as pointed out by Surenhusius and Whiston, e.g., that there are discrepancies between the quotations of the prophecies in the New Testament and the same prophecies in the Old Testament. (5) Furthermore, as Collins points out, the prophecies in the Old Testament cannot have been literally fulfilled by Jesus, because some of them had been literally fulfilled in the Old Testament, and others are about events which occurred many years before the birth of Jesus. (6) All that remains, then, is non-literal fulfilment of the prophecies. (7) Hence the Old Testament prophecies were non-literally, i.e., typologically, fulfilled by Jesus; and so Christianity is true. (8) But typological fulfilment is absurd, as nearly an3^thing could be fulfilled by its means. (9) Therefore since the Old Testament prophecies have not been literally fulfilled by Jesus, there is no connection between the Old and New Testaments, and Christianity has no basis. Now, Collins does not explicitly assert (8) and, a fortiori, (9). But his account of (7) is such that it is universally agreed that he believed, and expected his readers to believe, that (7) is false, and (8) is true, and b}^ implication (9) is also the case.28 Let us now look back again at the argument in the Vindication. As (l)-(3) state the conditions necessary for the truth of Christianity, so Collins holds in the Vindication that theism would be meaningless if we had no literal knowledge of the divine attributes.29 He quotes Archbishop Tillotson's necessary condition for the truth of religion. This is: " if we had no certain and settled Notion of the Goodness and Justice and Truth of God, he would be altogether an unintelli gible Being; and Religion, which consists in the Imitation of him, would be utterly lost." This is the motto on the title-page of the Vindication ; it is also quoted in the Discourse, p. 51. The difficulties of (4) and (5) are paralleled by the Manichean problems. But, whereas, in the prophecy debate, Collins dismisses a literal solution and pays lip service to a non-literal solution, in the Vindication 28 See, for example, John Leland's A view of the principal deistical writers . . . (London 1754), pp. 108-10; Stephen, History of English thought, iv 32-3; and O'Higgins, pp. 168-71. 29 O'Higgins goes even further, and claims that Collins makes " God's intellect univocal with ours "; see p. 63 note 7.</page><page sequence="16">100 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy he rejects a non-literal solution and, apparently, supports a literal solution. But it is a solution which does not solve anything: the Manichean problems remain. Moreover, in both cases he shows that the latest attempts to solve the legitimate problems are unsatisfactory.30 The question which we must then ask is this : was Collins as insincere in his saying that we have literal knowledge of the divine attributes as he was in claiming to believe in typological fulfilment of the prophecies ? The preponder ance of evidence, if we take Collins' statements in a straightforward, exoteric way, certainly argues for a negative answer. But since it is allowed by all commentators that Collins was not being straightforward with regard to typolo gical fulfilment (7), then there is certainly a serious possibility that he was acting in the same way concerning our knowledge of the divine attributes. To concede that Collins did not really mean (7) is tantamount to admitting that he had an esoteric or internal doctrine. On the other hand, it must be admitted that Collins was a champion of cognitive or literal language; hence we might expect him to hold that the divine wisdom must be literally like human wisdom, while rejecting non-literal fulfilment of the prophecies. But the question still arises, whether he really thought that the divine attributes could be referred to in literal language, and without contradiction. There is an important discussion of the nature and genesis of thinking in Collins' Answer to Clarke, which ought to be considered in connection with this question. Collins maintains there that thinking follows the action of bodies on our senses (p. 27) ; and that human thinking, and all of its modes, " has Succession and Parts, as all material Actions have " (p. 28). But, although he holds that human thinking is essentially tied up with matter, he claims that God. alone, is totally unconnected with matter. As the passage in which he asserts this is of considerable importance, I shall quote it in full : ?t is evident to me that God must be an Immaterial Being, that is, a proper Immaterial Being, a Being without any of the Propertys of Matter, without Solidity, Extension or Motion, and that exists in no place; and not a Being that has Extension (and consequently exists in Place and has Parts) according to Mr. Clark's Idea of Immaterial Being. Now Thinking in God cannot be founded on any Objects acting upon him, nor is Thinking in him supposed to be successive, or to consist of Parts, or to have any Modes, because Modes of Thinking are distinct Acts of Thinking. But as his Essence is eternal and immutable, without any the least Variation or Alteration, so his Thinking is supposed to be one numerical individual Act, comprehending all things and all the Possibilitys of things at one View, and as is fixt, and permanent and unvariable, and as much without Succession and Parts, as his Essence. So that if we can form any Judgment of the nature of Thinking in Man, from its perfect Conformity with the Powers of Matter, and its intire and total Disagreement with Thinking, in that only Immaterial Being which, we are satisfy'd, exists; we may reasonably conclude Human Thinking a Power or Affection of Matter (p. 29). 30 Logically, of course, the option of Manicheanism, in the one case, and Judaism in the other, remain open. But Collins' readers would hardly consider these as serious possibilities or solutions.</page><page sequence="17">Berman?Anthony Collins and the Question of Atheism ioi There is, I think, a direct conflict between Collins' statement here, and his assertions in the Vindication against King. If human thinking has an " intire and total Disagreement with Thinking, in that only Immaterial Being," how then can any of the intellectual or moral perfections be literally applied to man and God ? Collins allows that thinking is the genus from which all the particular mental modes are derived, or at least upon which they depend. He says: " Thinking has its Modes, such as Doubting, Willing, Knowing, Pleasure, Pain, etc." (p. 28). How then are we to account for, and deal with, the conflict between his non anthropomorphic description of God in the Answer and his anthropomorphic account in the Vindication ? Toland has provided us with a suggestion in his " Clidophorus ". The fact that " the same men do not always seem to say the same things on the same subjects . . . can only be solved [he says] by the distinction of the external and internal doctrine."*1 When we meet with an evident contradiction in such men as Collins, we must be on our guard and be prepared to look more deeply. My proposal, in short, is that Collins' internal doctrine was the negative argument of the Vindication combined with the immaterial conception of God in the Answer. Taken together they make up an argument for atheism. This interpretation is in general accord, I think, with the rule or key which Toland lays down for determining when a writer is sincere : If someone, he says, " seriously maintains the contrary of what's bylaw established, and openly declares for what most others oppose, then there is a strong presumption that he utters his mind " (p. 96). In his conception of an immaterial being, Collins is making as great and as unbridgeable a gap between things divine and human as did Archbishop King. An immaterial being must have a completely different i( psychology " from all material beings. But we can only have ideas of material beings and their psychology; we have no idea what an intellect is like which is utterly different from ours. Hence talk of divine attributes is without content and meaningless. As he emphatically, although conditionally, puts it in the Philosophical inquiry in an utterance worthy of Spinoza : " When we use the term God, the Idea signified thereby, ought to be as distinct and determinate in us, as the Idea of a triangle or square is, when we discourse of either of them ; otherwise, the term God is an empty sound " (pp. 11-12). 31 See Tetradymus, p. 85, and also see p. 77. O'Higgins does not draw attention to the conflict between Collins' negative conception of the divine attributes in the Answer and his positive conception in the Vindication; although he does mention another doctrinal conflict, first identified by Samuel Clarke, which is connected with the first (pp. 71-2). In the Essay Collins had asserted that God acts in time, and there is succession in the divine nature. In the long passage from the Answer, which I have just quoted, Collins denies that thinking in God is successive. Clarke pounced on this apparent contradiction, and in his next pamphlet the Fourth defense (1708) printed the opposing statements in opposite columns (pp. 17-19). Collins never answered Clarke's charge of contradiction, although there is no doubt that he was aware of it. Nor did he alter either passage, when he, presumably, had the opportunity in later editions of the Essay and Answer. The first edition of the Essay was in 1707, the second, edition " corrected " in 1709; the first edition of the Answer was 1707, and the second '' corrected " in 1711. It is possible that in contradicting himself Collins was showing, without saying, that there is a fundamental difficulty in the theist's conception of God. Certainly, it is very surprising that in the Vindication in 1710, he should contradict the very same statement from the Answer t which Clarke had pounced on with such alacrity as in contradiction to the Essay.</page><page sequence="18">102 Proceedings of the Royal Irish Academy I might summarise my reconstruction of Collins' atheistic argument in the following way: (1) God is an immaterial being, and His identity is like nothing that we can conceive; (2) but what we cannot conceive is meaningless; (3) suppos ing, however, that we can conceive His attributes, then they are observed to be in conflict, i.e., contradictory; (4) hence, as the conception of such a being is either meaningless or contradictory, that being cannot exist. Such a reconstruction supposes that Collins' Vindication plays a central role in his atheism; and this is in agreement with, and finds support from, Berkeley's association of Collins, atheism and King's theory in Alciphron IV. 16-22. (We should now be less surprised to read in Alciphron IV.17 that Diagoras (Collins) was " wonderfully delighted " with King's theory.) Another piece of evidence which supports my reconstruction is that one very early critic of the Vindication interpreted Collins' true intentions in generally the same way I have done. The reason why Collins recorded Bayle's Manichean problems, according to a reviewer in Censura temporum, was to shew that Boyle must be in the right, if the Bishop's [King's] solution of the difficulties relating to the matter be wrong and indefencible, and then as far as he is able to prove it so, and substitute a contrary principle in the place of it, which it is impossible should be true.32 The " contrary principle," I take it, is Collins' supposed literal conception of the divine attributes. Hence the reviewer calls Collins " this mock Vindicator."33 For what is really being vindicated is the Manichean difficulties in the theist's conception of God. Other difficulties which might be brought in by Collins to support the claim in (3)?that there are conflicts in the theist's conception of God?have been considered above. These are (a) the problem of conceiving the creation of matter ex nihilo (pp. 95-6), (b) the difficulty of retaining both the necessity and the freedom of God (pp. 96-7), and (c) the problem of how an eternal Being can act in time (note 31). Between the acceptance and rejection of the thesis I have been defending in this paper?viz., that Anthony Collins was a speculative atheist?there is a third possibility. My defence may appear only strong enough to warrant doubts concerning Collins' beliefs and disbeliefs. If such uncertainty is the result, I should then like to make the following classificatory suggestion : Pending a more decisive examination of the question, we should cease referring to Collins as a deist?a name by which he never called himself?and return to the neutral name, which he did apply to himself, namely, free-thinker.34 32 Censura temporum (1710), vol. iii, no. 2; p. 36. This long review (pp. 35-51), again unnoticed by O'Higgins, is written in a style, and contains views, remarkably similar to Peter Browne's; and I am tempted to think that the review is by him. Browne was in London at the time, being appointed to the Bishopric of Cork and Ross. 33 Censura temporum, p. 36. 341 am grateful to Mr. Ian Tipton for many helpful comments on an earlier draft of this paper.</page><page sequence="19">Page 94, note 25, line 6.
