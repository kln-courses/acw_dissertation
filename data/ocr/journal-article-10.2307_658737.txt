C., FEBRUARY, 1898 No. 2 ZtUNI ANCESTRAL GODS AND MASKS MATILDA COXE STEVENSON The pantheon of the Zufii Indians may be divided into two classes-anthropomorphic and zoom orphic- and the former class may be subdivided into those represented by men wearing masks and those who are not personified. I have never discovered that either the Sun God or the Moon Goddess is personified by the Zufii, although sun and moon sym- bols occur on many sacred objects. The Twin War-gods are not personified, although crude images of them are carved in wood, and they have their earthly representatives in the Priest of the Bow and his associate. Zoomorphic gods play their part in the medicine societies. In this brief paper I will confine myself to the creation and classification of the ancestral gods. The genesis of the Zufii is known to but few outside the priesthood, and it is carefully guarded by them. In the beginning Awonawilona (Sun Father) and Yionan (Moon Mother) existed above and Shiwanni (Priest-man) and Shiwanlotka (Priest-woman) existed below. All was shipololo-fog or mist. With the breath from his heart Awonawilona created clouds and the great waters of the world. Then said Shiwanni, " I, too, will create something beautiful and which will give us light at night when our Moon Mother sleeps;" and, spitting into the palm of his left hand, he patted the spittle with the fingers of his right hand and the spittle foamed like yucca suds and then formed into bubbles of many colors, which he blew upward, and created the heavens, and Shiwanni was greatly satisfied. Then Shiwanotka (Priest-woman) said, "See what I can do;" and she spit into the palm of her left hand and patted the spittle 5 (33)</page><page sequence="2">THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST with the fingers of her right hand, and the saliva foamed like yucca suds, and, running over her hand, it spread everywhere, and thus she created Awitelintsita (Earth Mother). Shiwanni and Shiwanotka also created the Zufnii many being born one after the other in rapid succession. Sun Father and Moon Mother always existed; so also Shiwanni and Shiwanotka. The Zufii believe they were created in an innermost world, which they call Awitantehula, " Fourth World; " also Annosien- tehula,' Blackness-of-soot World." The Sun Father, being aware of their existence, wished to bring them to his presence, so he created two sons-K6wwituma and Wats+,usi-by impregnat- ing two bits of foam with his beams. After their creation the two joined their Sun Father by throwing meal upward, which formed a road, over which they ascended. The Sun Father provided them with bows from the rainbow, arrows of lightning, and shields of clouds, and bade them go to the Underworld and bring his children to his presence. The two rent the earth with their light- ning arrows and descended into Awitintehula (Fourth World). Space will not permit us to relate the experiences of the Twin Sons in the innermost world. The Zufii were led by them to a world above, which is called Awishotehula, " Moss World," from a fine moss supposed to have enveloped this world. Again, they ascended to Pan'anula-tehula, "Mud World," and again to Lat'- owu-tehula, " Feather World," reference being to the sun's rays penetrating into this world like so many feathers-in fact, the rays are called the sun's feathers: finally they ascended to the Outer World, which they designate as Y'am'yatotka tiichu in tekohannan6 u nati tkanaptka, which signifies, " Our Sun Father, we see the light of day and draw in the sacred breath." Although these people lived in a world of darkness and could not see one another, they had a priesthood for each of the six regions. The Priest of the Zenith was not associated with the Sun Father, for as yet they knew him not. On their coming to this world Wats+,usi and Kow'wituma desired that a pekwin or deputy to the Sun Father be appointed; so they chose Yanowu- luha, a man possessed of much wisdom and foresight, and they had him fill the place of Priest of the Zenith; therefore since that time the Priest of the Zenith and the Sun Priest have been one and the same. When the world was still new to the Zufii,Wats+ ,usi and Kow'- wituma organized four societies. These were the Shiwannakwe 34 [Vol. XI</page><page sequence="3">Feb. 1898] ZUNI ANCESTRAL GODS AND MASKS (people who do not fast from animal food), Sain'iikakwe (hunt- ers), Newekwe (galaxy), and L'ewekwe (Wood people). We will not follow the Zufli in their migrations, fraught with so many trials and tribulations, but we will join them some sixty- five miles southwest of present Zufi. Weary of constant travel- ing, of building houses and then abandoning them in their quest for the middle of the world, the tK4kwemosi, Priest of the House of Houses, or high priest, sent his son Siwulutsiwa and his daugh- ter Siwulutsitsa in advance to find a suitable place to locate. The youth led his sister to a mountain top, whence they could have a more commanding view, and there left her. On return- ing he found her sleeping, and, being enamored of her beauty, embraced her. An immediate change of tongue and the birth of ten sons were the result of this unnatural union. Though the speech was new, they understood each other perfectly. Their children were not born after the lapse of months, but one after the other in close succession. Siwulutsiwa, recognizing their changed condition, declared, " We must prepare a place for our others," and he descended to the plains below and drew his foot through the sands and created the Zufii and Little Colorado rivers and a lake, and in the depths of the lake a group of houses were created, the center one being a great dance-house having four windows, through which those not privileged to enter might view the dance. When the Zufii drew near they were astonished to see the waters. The first to cross were the L'ewekwe (Wood Society) and their children. The children were frightened and pinched at their mothers, who in alarm dropped the little ones from their backs into the waters, where they were converted into tortoise, tadpoles, frogs, and water snakes, and, descending into the lake, they resumed their normal forms, growing at once into maturity. These children of the L'ewekwe, with the youth Siwulutsiwa and his sister, Siwulutsitsa, and their offspring constitute the original ancestral gods, all but Siwulutsiwa and his first nine sons mak- ing their abiding place in the lake. Siwulutsiwa and his nine children live in the K6yemshi mountain hard by. The name of the mystic lake is Hi'tin-tkaiakwe, " weed-water place," and is so called from the quantity of flags in the marsh surrounding its banks. The name usually applied to the lake is K6thluwalawa, "Dance village," which has reference to the abid- ing place of the gods, who are called K6k-ko, " Masked dancers." 35</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST Siwulutsiwa and his first nine sons became K6yemshi, " Old Dance Man," he being the Awantitchu, Great Father, of the K6k-ko. The eldest son became his Pekwin or deputy, the sec- ond his Pitla" Shiwanni or warrior; the third bears the name of Eshotse, "Bat;" the fourth, Muyapona, "Small-horns;" the fifth, Posotki, " Little Mouth; " the sixth, Na-l'shi, " Old Grand- father;" the seventh, Itsepaisha, "Game-maker;" the eighth, Ka'lutsi, " The Drinker;" the ninth, tSa-l'pshi, "Old Youth." S'wulutsiisa became K6mokatsi, " Old Dance Woman," and great mother of the K6k-ko, and her last born, with others of the original gods, became Korkokshi, " Good Dancers " or "Dancers for Good," and rain-makers. A council was formed at K6thluwalawa comprising the fol- lowing gods: Pautiwa-Director general of the Kok-ko and great dance-house. K'Siklo-Pekwin or deputy to director general. Shulawitsi-Pekwin or deputy to the Sun Father. Saiatisha-Holds relative position to the tKakwemosi, high priest of Zufii and Priest of the North. 1st Yamluhacto-Associate tKakwemosi. Huitutu-Holds relative position to the Priest of the West. 2d Ya/muhacto-Holds relative position to the Priest of the South. Two Sa/lamobia-Warriors; hold relative position to the Priest of the Bow and his associate. Others numbered among the original gods are six Shalako, couriers to the rain-makers of the six regions; SalInmobia, war- riors of the six regions, whose two priests are members of the council, and Kolowisi, keeper of cereals. I have mentioned that there is but one great dance-house in the lake. The Kok-ko do not confine their dancing to the house, but dance outside. The Awantitchu, Great Father of the Kok-ko, deemed it fitting that the faces of the gods should be covered when dancing away from the house, so he created a mask for himself and one for each god by moistening his finger with spittle and rubbing it on a spot on the floor of the dance-house. A mask was the immediate result. The moistening of the finger was repeated each time before rubbing the spot on the floor. The curious paraphernalia of the Shallako appeared with their masks. The discovery that the Zufii believe their gods wear masks was a revelation to me. I think all students of these people have understood that they believed their gods possessed 36 [Vol. XI</page><page sequence="5">Feb. 1898] ZUNI ANCESTRAL GODS AND MASKS monster-like heads on human forms. Even the plumed serpent as it came from K6thluwalawa to Zufii was a mask covering the God of Cereals, whose form is that of man. After crossing the river at K6thluwalawa the Zufii lingered for a time and requested the Twin Sons of the Sun, who remained by the Zuii through their migrations, to look after the lost chil- dren. The Twins descended into the depths of the lake, and entering the great dance-house of K6thluwalawa, found the children, who were masked; but they quickly removed their masks, laying them by their sides, and there was mutual recog- nition. The children bade Watst,usi and K6wwituma say: ' We are happy here, and here we will remain to receive our fathers and our mothers." Watst,usi and K6wwituma looked upon the masks until they knew them with their hearts, and they said, "Ellakwa chawe," "Thanks, my children." So they returned to the Zufi and told the tKakwemosi they had found the children and they were happy. Now the creation of K6thluwalawa seems to have been for a purpose, but the Zuii could not receive benefit therefrom until they were acquainted with the organization and plans proposed by the council of the Gods. Accordingly Pautiwa, director-in- chief of K6thluwalawa, designated his deputy tKi'klo, sagacious and good of talk, to bear his instructions to the Zufii. He gave a duck filled with cereals and beads about its neck to tKa'klo to use for a rattle, and instructed Awantatchu K6yemshi and his nine sons like unto himself to bear tK/'klo to his people at Itiwanna, the " Middle," the Zufii having located on their present site, believing it to be the middle of the world. tKii'klo recited to the Zufii a history of their coming to this world, and their nig,rations to Itiwanna, the Middle, adding that in eight days more the gods would come to give to the people the new breath of life, and they must have ready six houses for the six regions in which to receive the gods, and they must go over the western road to meet the gods. The myth comprising the tKa'klo's recital during this visit to the Zufii is the most zealously guarded in all their mythology. It is in the keeping of four men only, and death is the punish- ment for betrayal of the trust. It was a source of deep gratifica- tion to me that after years of effort to secure this recital I was able to record it during my last visit to Zuni, my informant being the director of the body, and I was doubly fortunate in in- 37</page><page sequence="6">THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST ducing a second member to repeat it to me. The two accounts agreed, with the exception of the addition of two words by the latter speaker. Neither one knew the other had confided the secret to me. While the ancestral gods appear at certain times in ghost form, their spirits being always present with the personators of the gods, they visited Zufii but once in physical form, wearing masks. I would add that though the gods wear masks in K6- thluwalawa when leaving their dance-house, when they ascend to this world to walk about a little for recreation they assume the form of game, principally deer. Nothing would induce a Zufii to shoot a deer anywhere near Kothluwalawa, fearing he might shoot a god. The shadow beings of game go to Kothluwalawa to serve the Kok-ko, and interesting ceremonies are held over game when t it is brought in, regardless of its having been secured in ceremonial hunts. The six houses for the gods, which are termed kiw8itsis, were completed. Thus originated the kiwitsis, and the Zufii went over the western road after the eight days, met the gods, and accom- panied them to the heiwa (north) klwisi. All the priests and laity assembled in this kitwisi. The Awiintitchu, Great Father of the K6k-ko, said to the Zufii, " Look well at these masks we wear; look well." Pautiwa, director general, was the first to re- move his mask. The tKAkwemosi, of the Pichikwe, Willow clan, taking the mask into his hands, examined it carefully, and said, "Thanks, my child;" and he afterwards made one like it, and since that time the decorating of this mask has been done by a man of the Willow clan. Then the mn6sona (director) of the Newekwe or Galaxy Society (one of the four societies organized when the world was new) examined the mask of Awantitchu, and those of his nine sons who wore similar masks were exam- ined, each by a member of the Galaxy Society, and were after- ward made by them and worn exclusively by members of this society until the Ashiwanni (Rain priests) decided to have the K6yemshi personated alternately by the Newekwe (Galaxy), Sh6wekwe (Gamblers), Matketsannakwe (Great Fire), and tKo- shikwe (Cactus) societies. The masks of each member of the council and others were carefully examined, not all, however, in the ktwitsi of the north. After a time the Awantatchu said: " I wish a man for Komo- sona [director to the Kok-ko, relative position to I'autiwa], a 38 [Vol. XI</page><page sequence="7">Feb. 1898] ZUNI ANCESTRAL GODS AND MASKS man for K6pekwin [deputy to the K6mosona], and two ptldi- shiwanni, as warriors to the former." These were selected by the tKi'kwemosi (high priest). First he chose a man of the Deer clan, saying, " My child of the Deer clan, you will be Komosona ;" and, addressing a man of the Badger clan. said: "My child, you will be K6petwin;" and again, choosing a man of the Deer clan, said: " My child, you will be warrior to the Komosona;" and again he spoke to a man of the Badger clan, saying, "My child, you will be warrior to the K6pekwin." The first body of Ashiwanni left the kiwitsi, and the K6mosona divided the Zufii, regardless of clan, into six groups, one remaining in the heiwa (north) kiwitsi, while the other five groups gathered in the re- maining five kiwitsis. The masks of the gods were carefully in- spected and fac-similes were made by the men of the klwitsis in which the masks were examined, and since that time each kiwi'si produces the personators of the gods whose mask it made. During this visit of the gods the Zuni were initiated into the mysteries of the K6k-ko, receiving the new breath of life, and thus the K6k-kotikili, Masked-dancer Society, was organized. The dramatization of this visit of the gods to Zufii is one of their most impressive ceremonials. Every male child must receive involuntary initiation at the age of four or five years and voluntary initiation at ten or twelve years into the society of the K6k-ko in order to be admitted after death into the Great Dance-house in K6thluwalawa. At the time of involuntary initiation he is relegated to the kiwi'si chosen for him at the time of his birth. There are usually three, sometimes only two, doctresses present at childbirth, and the one who receives the child as it is born decides the placing of the child into the kiwitsi, for the husband of the doctress be- comes the godfather to the child and enters him in his kiwilsi. In case the woman has no husband, her son fills the place, and should she have no son, her elder brother. Clanship plays no part in entering the kiwi'si. Though the child becomes a member of the society of the K6k-ko at a tender age, he is led to believe the personators of the gods are the gods themselves. All masks, when not in use, are kept carefully from view of the younger children, but at vol- untary initiation the children are made acquainted with the real condition of affairs and told if they betray the secret reposed in them their heads will be cut off with a stone knife. After volun- 39</page><page sequence="8">THE AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST tary initiation the youth receives a mask of the K6rkokshi, and is expected to take his part in the special dances of these gods for rain, each klwitsi furnishing in succession its set of K6rkokshi for the winter and summer rains. This mask is personal prop- erty, and is buried with the owner at his death, to follow him to the other world. While the dead go to K6thluwalawa, they do not remain there, but proceed by an under road to Awitaintehula, the Fourth World, whence they came. They, however, visit back and forth to K6th- luwalawa, and the original godsvisit Awitiintehula. The deceased Zufii become rain-makers, and are at the command of the coun- cil of the gods. The masks of the personators of the council of gods have their special keepers, and each dance director looks after the masks of his kliwitsi. The masks have a deep and sacred significance. When a man dons a mask his body becomes the abiding-place of the spirit of the god and he is worshipped as such; hence he is expected, when chosen to personate a god, to so conduct him- self that he will be worthy to fill the sacred office. During my last visit to Zufni a man who had been selected to personate the god Shfilawitsi in the drama of the Shalako was guilty of endeavoring to steal the affections of a man's wife. This caused the gathering together of the Rain priests and directors of the Society of the K6k-ko, and it was decided to dismiss him in disgrace and appoint a new man to fill his place. The dramas enacted by the personators of the gods are elab- orate and full of interest to the people, and while the actors en- dure many hardships and privations they derive great joy from it all. The weather is never too cold or stormy for these devotees to propitiate their gods in outdoor dances and ceremonies; and though these ceremonials are of the most sacred character the dancers are no sooner absent from the plaza than the K6yemshi, whose duty it is to render any necessary assistance to the per- formers, delight the audience with burlesques of the dancers. It is the function of the Society of the K6k-ko to hold cere- monials for rains to fructify the earth. The council of the gods designate the rain-makers, relegating them to the six regions, and the elaborate rituals of the Society of the K6k-ko may thus be summarized. They are for rains, that the earth may yield the fruits of her being, for in this arid land the greatest boon to man comes from the clouds. 40 Vol. XI</page></plain_text>
