Une approche possible est Ia notion de paradigme techno-6conomique. INTRODUCTION The shift from mechanistic models to an evolutionary approach in economics is long overdue. Despite the advocacy of Marshall [1925] and of Schumpeter [1939, 1943] it has been a long time coming. But there were many indications in the 1980s that the pace is accelerating. The work of Nelson and Winter [1982] and the joint work of many authors edited by Dosi et al. [1988], together with the establishment of new journals (for example, The Journal of Evolutionary Economics) and of the &lt;&lt; Schumpeter Society &gt;, exemplify this change. To capture the interactive nature of the technology-economy relationship, analogies with biological evolution are now often invoked. These imply a selection process from a range of " mutations " in technology and/or in the innovating organisations. By what processes do some organisational and technical innovations survive and prosper while others founder and die ? This paper attempts to explore some aspects of this interaction between the selection environment and innovations and to discuss the advantages and limitations of biological analogies. Section 2 explores the nature of the " selection environment " for innovations, including the natural environment, * An earlier version of this paper was originally prepared for the Labour Institute for Economic Research (Finland) and published in Finnish in ITT Katsaus, No. 4, 1989. 211 Revue Iconomique - N0 2, mars 1991, p. 211-232.</page><page sequence="2">Revue economique the built environment and the institutional environment. It concludes that despite the positive stimulus to be derived from biological analogies, there is no real substitute for the development of models and theories which take into account those specific features of social development and technical change which are uniquely human and which indeed vary with each successive technological revolution. The final section of the paper (Section 3) discusses one such attempt to open up a new perspective on the evolutionary aspects of technical and organisational innovation - the idea of successive " techno- economic paradigms " introduced by Carlota Perez, [1983]. " Selection " works at many different levels - the level of the R&amp;D project and programme in the R&amp;D system, the level of the individual innovation within the firm, the level of the firm itself (this is the level of most biological analogies in economic theory), the level of the industrial branch or region, the level of the nation and the level of the social system itself. The last two points in particular remind us that one of the fundamental differences between biological evolution and human social evolution is that not only the natural environment but also the institutional environment is itself changing rapidly as it interacts with new technology. Nevertheless, the emphasis on " selection " in terms of some criteria of viability and comparative advantage seems apt in terms of the real life selection processes which do indeed operate at all these different levels. From the astronomically huge numbers of possible mutations only a few survive, so that there clearly are powerful focussing systems. Freedom of choice is constrained on all sides and each step is path-dependent. Within the science system the " intemalist " criteria of experimental validation and logical coherence do play a part. At the technical level the hard test of" does it work " is obviously fundamental in addition to many other criteria of" satisfactory " performance which are more open to subjective interpretation and manipulation. Pilot plant work and prototype testing are selection procedures of a fairly rigorous kind. Market demand, profitability, market size and cost considerations are clearly of paramount importance in a capitalist economy when it comes to selling such new products and services, however optimistic early estimates may have been. In fact the capacity to generate a wide variety of potential new products, services and organisations and to confront them on a trial and error basis with these various selection processes over a prolonged period is probably the strongest single evolutionary advantage of capitalist institutions themselves. Schumpeter thought that the bureaucratisation of R&amp;D and the concentration of industry would lead in the end to the death of entrepreneurship, the loss of technical dynamism, and to socialism. He may well have underestimated the continuing technical dynamism of capitalism, but he was probably not mistaken is believing that the innovation capacity of a social system would be decisive for its long-term survival and growth. At all these levels and in their interplay, evolutionary selection processes are at work, and at all these levels the biological metaphor can be a useful stimulus to new thinking. Lorenz [1984] defended himself against the 212</page><page sequence="3">Christopher Freeman accusation of anthropomorphism when he compared jealousy in the behaviour of geese to that of human beings by claiming that logically there is no such thing as a " false " analogy. He was right to emphasise that analogies (observed similarities) between animal and human behaviour can be a fertile source of new ideas and explanations in both natural and social science, since they can lead to the observation of what is different about humans, as well as what is the same. However, it is important not to be carried away by evolutionary analogies and to mistake the analogy for the reality, as often occurs with computer simulation models which have a similar heuristic value. At the very least any good biological model would have to be Lamarckian and not neo-Darwinian. Moreover, the " mutations ", whether in technologies or in the behaviour of firms or other institutions, are often purposively introduced, even though they may follow from the screening and testing of a number of alternative combinations, some of which are random, or nearly so. It would be as dangerous for economics to take over wholesale the models of biology as it was to make too much of equilibrium models derived from physics (Allen [1988]). THE ROLE OF THE SELECTION ENVIRONMENT In contemporary societies, the interactions between human needs, the economy, entrepreneurship and the intemal dynamics of the science-technology system generate an increasingly wide range of technological and organisational possibilities. But this certainly does not mean unconstrained freedom to use new (or old) technology in any way we wish, either for individuals or for society as a whole. The social environment acts not only as a stimulus to the capacity and range of technology and the deployment of alternative new combinations. It also constrains, frustrates and prevents in various ways the deployment of new technologies. Furthermore, the environment may at one stage act as a containing and restraining influence, whilst at a different stage it may provide a powerful stimulus. The element of timing was already stressed by Schumpeter [1939]: One essential peculiarity of the working of the capitalist system is that it imposes sequences and rules of timing. Its effectiveness entirely rests on this and on the promptness with which it punishes infringements of those sequences and rules (p. 412). But it is not only the economic and institutional environment which imposes sequences " and " punishes ". Catastrophic events in the natural environment can at any time introduce a new set of penalties, constraints and priorities. In order to analyse the changing influence of the selection environment, it is necessary to distinguish between the natural environment, 213</page><page sequence="4">Revue e'conomique the built environment and the institutional environment. Within the institutional environment it is also necessary to distinguish different types and levels of selection. (i) The natural environment At a time of mounting concem about the " greenhouse effect "acid rain" and destruction of the tropical rainforest it is hardly necessary to stress the continuing importance of interactions between technology and the natural environment. Even when there were relatively few human beings and the mode of production was predominantly agriculturl these interactions were important. The possibilities for hunting, gathering, growing crops, herding animals and extracting minerals have always been constrained by climatic and geological factors. Whilst agricultural and mining technologies have vastly enlarged the possibilities for the scope, volume and quality of production they have not removed and cannot altogether remove these constraints. Social conflicts rather than geological factors or environmental hazards provoked the oil crises of 1913 and 1979. But the depletion of fossil fuels, the hazards of nuclear power and the polluting effects of many processes using oil and coal have led to increasing pressures for the development and improvement of new and old energy technologies (such as solar power, wind power, water power) which use renewable sources of energy. Similar considerations, although at the moment a little less pressing, apply to materials, transport and construction. The sheer scale of human populations and of economic activities means that, whatever the forms of social organisation, interactions between the natural environment and human technology will be increasingly important. Scientific breakthroughs and advances in bio-technology and in space technology may open up entirely new possibilities for energy and food production and thereby relax some of the constaints. But the use of pollution abatement technologies, changes in energy, transport and agricultural systems and even scientific research all depend on massive new investment Catastro- phic environmental degradation could destroy the human species as well as many others even though the role of human foresight, knowledge and capacity for adaptive response clearly distinguish the human from other animal species. Successful action depends on a combination of advances in scientific understanding, appropriate political programmes, social reforms and other institutional changes, as well as on the scale and direction of new investnent. Organisational and social innovations would always have to accompany any technical innovations and some would have to come first. But even with a timely response, in a very real sense the environment itself will " select " which technologies (if any) are effective in coping with such problems as the greenhouse effect. Human beings are " free " to develop a range of possible social and technical innovations which they hope will dampen the effects sufficiendy for them to survive. The more they understand about the scientific problems and the social problems the more likely they are 214</page><page sequence="5">Christopher Freeman to improvise effective strategies after a learning period. But there is also obviously a very strong selection process at work and the freedom to choose between alternatives is highly constrained: it is the " freedom of necessity " of which Bernal wrote [1949]. Some changes in the natural environment are the direct result of human activity (whether intended or not) and may be responsive to purposive social control, however puny and mis-directed such efforts may now appear, but other confront us as purely external forces. The analogy with biological evolutionary processes is therefore valuable insofar as it shows the great danger of separating economics completely from ecology. But it would be misleading if it led to neglect of the ways in which the human species can itself purposively modify the environment. (ii) The built environment Contemporary human societies are influenced and limited in their choice and exploration of new technologies not only by the natural environment. The capital stock of the human race in the form of cities, villages, power stations, transport facilities, factories, farms and other forms of fixed capital is now so great that it shows some characteristics of the natural environment and indeed in some ways is part of it. The built environment now predominates in its influence on the evolution of some animals and plant species. However, it both stimulates, channels and constrains human technological developments in a number of ways which have little to do with the natural environment. The prior existence of long-lived physical assets obviously may often be a constraint on investment in new equipment, not just in purely physical terms but even more in terms of cost, profitability and social acceptability. At other times the depreciation and deterioration of these assets may stimulate new investment and technical changes. Theories of replacement cycles for physical assets have been important in business cycle theory and were a major element in Kondratieffs [1926] theory in which he postulated that cycles of infrastructural investment lasted about half a century. Kuznets suggested a similar but shorter cycle for the construction industry. At all times considerations of location, scale, durability and cost of physical equipment powerfully affect decisions about new investment embodying new technologies, especially infrastructural investment. Grubler [1990] has recently demonstrated anew the very great importance of technical change interacting with waves of new infrastructural investment in transport systems. In the long run all fixed assets can be changed or replaced but in the short run most of them are " clay " rather than " putty ", acting at times as a powerful constraint on the rapid diffusion of new technologies. This could be seen very clearly in the energy crises of the 1970s. After the first OPEC shock in 1973 desperate efforts were made to save oil but to the extent that they were successful, it was more from social restrictions on consumption rather than changes in technology. A few power stations were equipped to switch rapidly from oil to coal and in many countries it was possible to make minor energy- 215</page><page sequence="6">Revue economique saving " retro-fitting " applications to existing capital stock. A persistent energy saving trend could set in only with new less energy-intensive generations of capital equipment in factories, vehicles and buildings and subsidies to the installation of such equipment. The strength of such trends varies between countries, depending on social policies and priorities and scale of investment as well as on R&amp;D technology policies. But in all countries the speed of the change in technology was constrained by the heritage of a large existing investment in old plant and infrastructure. For this reason, among many others, any large-scale transition to the use of bio-technology outside a few industries and services is likely to be a matter of decades rather than of years. For this reason, too, it is important to make an early start in dealing with severe long-term environmental hazards. (iii) The institutional environment The nature and timing of those technical and organisational innovations which will be generated, adopted and improved or discarded will be influenced not only by the natural and built environment but also, of course, by the institutional environment, including previous accumulated experience in science and technology. Capitalist institutions have so far proved the most effective in human history in stimulating a flow of technical and organisational innovations and diffusing them through the production system. No one paid a stronger tribute than Marx to this technical dynamism of capitalism. But this does not mean of course that any innovation is promoted and diffused under capitalism. On the contrary: the economy and the web of established technologies are highly selective. It is well established that most attempted innovations fail. A very high proportion fail in the development stage before they are ever launched, but after market launch there are still many failures. In particular for the more radical innovations, there is not only a high rate of failure but even for those which ultimately succeed there is usually a prolonged gestation period often lasting decades with many setbacks (Jewkes et al. [1958]). Although other factors, such as war or the threat of war, have certainly had a very powerful influence in some countries and some periods, there can be little doubt that under capitalism it has been economic criteria of potential market demand, cost and profitability which have predominated in the selection process. This does not mean that it is possible to make accurate ex ante estimates of costs and rate of return on any innovation, especially the more radical ones. On the contrary, all the evidence continues to point in the opposite direction. Nor does it mean that there are no other influences at work, such as safety or political power struggles in firms or governments. Still less does it mean that market demand is the only influence on innovation since by definition there is no previous experience of market demand for truly radical innovations (Mowery and Rosenberg [1979]). But in the long run the need for 216</page><page sequence="7">Christopher Freeman profitable accumulation asserts itself as the predominant influence on the success or failure of new products and processes. We have argued in Section 1 that biological analogies can be fruitful in highlighting aspects of this selection process provided that the differences as well as the similarities between social and biological evolution are also stressed. One of these differences relates to the interaction of the " selection environment " with the " mutations " which emerge and survive. Another relates to the purposive nature of that interaction with human individuals and social institutions deliberately cultivating and designing certain types of " mutation ". Marx expressed this difference well in his comment that what distinguishes the worst of architects from the best of bees is that the architect erects first of all in the imagination what is subsequently constructed in reality. This simply does not occur with the " blind watchmaker " or neo-Darwinian biological evolution, although of course it is a feature of some theories of creative evolution. Finally, the institutional selection environment for innovations operates at several different levels. The realm of the scientifically conceivable is far wider than the realm of the technically feasible, which is in turn far wider than the realm of the economically profitable (Perez [1985]). The realm of the economically profitable is in turn wider than the socially acceptable and the criteria of acceptability are themselves evolving. We shall briefly consider the various levels of selection. (a) Science and Technology in the Institutional Environment It would, of course, be a mistake to think of technology as simply drawing upon a " genetic pool " of random mutations from science or of the economy as drawing upon a similar genetic pool of mutations from technology. The " linear model " of innovation has been criticised ad nauseam and rightly so. Virtually all case studies of innovation and most histories of technology point to the strength of the interaction between technology and science as well as between the economy and technology. The internalist-extemalist debate in the history of science has receded with the growing awareness of these interdependencies. The importance of the social context is increasingly recognised as well as the fact that autonomous developments in technology sometimes lead science. Some historians of technology, such as Hughes [1983, 1988], who studied in depth the development of specific technologies, became impatient with the pretensions of particular disciplines, whether economists or historians of science, to reduce a complex interactive system to the narrow perspective of one discipline. ... interaction suggests that hard analytical categories, such as technology, science, politics, economics and the social should be used sparingly if their use leads to difficulty in comprehending interconnection. A system or networks approach may help historians present the history of technology in accordance with the interactive mode. Inventors, engineers, managers and financiers who have taken a lead in creating and presiding over technological systems show a way of grasping the seamless web (1988, p. 12). 217</page><page sequence="8">Revue economique The emphasis on interactive systems and networks is shared by most European historians of technology such as Gille [1978], Callon [1986], Bijker [1987] and the group at Edinburgh working on information and communication technology with their emphasis on the " social shaping of technology " (Molina [1989]). The growing use of such expressions as " socio-technical system " or " techno-economic paradigm " is another indication of the general recognition of the importance of these interdependencies. But when all this has been said, there is still an internal selection process at work within science and technology. Campbell [1960], in his paper " Blind variation and selective survival as a general strategy in knowledge processes ", has argued that the mental scanning of a vast range of random possibilities explains the greater part of original innovative ideas. But even from this extreme position, the Popper-Lakatos [1970] criteria of falsifiability and continuous experimental validation in fundamental science are still an even more important internal selection process. However they may originate, some of the results of fundamental research do create an entirely new range of possibilities for technology. The " genetic pool " is enlarged both by experience with technologies and by internal developments in science itself, and by their interaction. Clearly again this is another extremely important difference from the genetic pool of neo-Darwinian biology. This has very important implications for technology policy, which have been strongly emphasised by Nelson [1988]. The closer the interaction between science and technology the more important it becomes for industrial R&amp;D laboratories to find ways to gain selective early access to the results of fundamental research, especially in universities. Thus the national institutional environment could be an important stimulus to the evolutionary process or, in other institutional situations, could retard it. (b) Technology and the Economy It is at the stage of innovation and diffusion of innovation by firms that biological analogies have been most widely used in economics. Some analysts have concentrated on the evolution of the artefacts or innovations themselves (see, for example, Clark and Juma, 1987, and their comments on Marx's account of the hundreds of specialised types of hammer which evolved during the industrial revolution; or see also the comments of Lorenz [1984], on the " irrational " persistence of some design features through radical changes in technology - Marx's " locomotives with horses' legs "). In this approach the birth, survival or death of firms is secondary to the technological evolution itself. Faber and Proops [1988] suggest that inventions represent the genotypes of technological evolution, while innovations are the phenotypes. But most evolutionary economists have concentrated on the firm as the dominant analogy with the biological " survival of the fittest " (see Nelson and Winter [1982], p. 41-45). In this approach the survival and development of innovations, whether technical or organisational, is taken usually as dependent 218</page><page sequence="9">Christopher Freenwn on the survival and growth of innovating firms. This illustrates once again some of the profound differences between natural and social evolution. Businaro [1983] made a thorough and consistent attempt to explore the scope and limits of reductionism to the firm level. The behaviour of the system cannot be reduced simply to the behaviour of individual firms since technology has a continuity which outlives any particular firm and transcends their failures. Nor can the growth and survival (or death) of firms be really likened to the life cycle of biological organisms. Edith Penrose [1952] made perhaps the most devastating critique of biological analogies in her attack on the analogy between the growth of animals (or plants) and the growth of firms and other attempts to give explanations of human affairs that do not depend on human motives. Nevertheless there is some merit in the biological analogy both at the level of technology and at the level of the firm. For reasons of space it is not possible to pursue the analysis of firm behaviour here, but it is essential to insist on one key point: the role of profitability. Even though there may be enclaves where a " non-market " selection environment persists for long periods in a capitalist economy and even though unprofitable individual products like " Concorde " may survive for a long time through political subsidies, the profitability selection process clearly predominates. Future civil supersonic aircraft are likely to be more profitable than Concorde. Political and social influences may very well determine the innovations which are selected for further development. But after market launch and during diffusion it is the economic selection environment with all its constraints and stimuli, interacting with the strategies and decisions of firms, which will largely determine the growth, survival or disappearance of innovating firms as well as the improvements of the technology. Schumpeter and Marx were surely not mistaken in identifying profits as having a very important effect on " band wagons " and " swarming " behaviour during early phases of diffusion, and the erosion of profits at a later stage leading to bankruptcies, rationali- sation and concentration. And it is mainly the firms which invest in the capital stock embodying successive generations of new technology. (c) The Economy and the Wider Social System This point is particularly relevant in connection with the discussion on the transition to the assembly line and other types of mass and flow production in large firms. Some historians (for example Piore and Sabel [1984]) have suggested that the decline of flexible small firm production systems was as much a matter of the political and social power of large corporations as of relative economic advantages. There was, according to this view, a real choice for society in terms of quality of work and the human advantage of different types of work organisation. Some regions in Europe chose a different path. According to some accounts, even the economic advantages favoured small firms. But most of the evidence on scale economies suggests that it was the 219</page><page sequence="10">Revue economique enormous strength of the capitalist profitability selection pressures which, so far from favouring small firms, was the main force driving concentration. Klein [1977] points out that there were indeed several technical alternatives still in competition for the US passenger car market at the end of the 19th centry - electric cars, steam cars and the internal combustion engine. There were also at that time many small producing firms using a variety of manufacturing techniques. But the Ford assembly line and the internal combustion engine showed such decisive economic as well as technical advantages (Klein [1977], pp. 98-99) by the First World War that the competitive process led inexorably to a strong concentration of production and ownership in large-scale plants. Analogous developments took place in other industries. Some of these were closely linked to the motor vehicle industry, such as tyres, rubber and oil. Others were indirectly affected, such as consumer durables or service industries, like tourism and retail distribution. But in all these cases the relative profitability of large-scale flow production or assembly line methods and of mass markets was the driving force in the -competitive selection process, rather than the preferences of individuals or groups for particular styles of work organisation or size of firm. In fact, Ford found it very hard to retain his labour force in the early days of the assembly line because of the speed-up and monotony involved. But the productivity and profitability potential was so great that he could double wages to attract and retain the type of labour he wanted. It was this which drove the diffusion of the organisational innovations, as well as the technical innovations. This is not to say that different social institutions could not override the profitability imperatives of capitalist competition nor, for example, that strong trade unions or social legislation cannot mitigate them. But it would have required either a very different social regulatory framework or a different social system to override the pressures to adopt the assembly line in early 20th century United States. A similar resurgence of the competitive strength of large firms is taking place today (see, for example, Harrison [1989]). Scale economies in design, development and world-wide marketing still influence profitability. After a period of proliferation of small innovative firms in computing software and bio-technology a new phase of concentration is setting in with many take-overs, especially in Europe. Nevertheless, the Piore-Sabel debate, both in its historical context and its contemporary context, does highlight an extremely important issue in relation to social " shaping " of technology: - How much freedom do we really have to modify and adapt a major wave of technical and organisational innovations if they offer decisive economic advantages to competitive firms in a capitalist economy ? (d) Organisational Innovations It is true that some organisational innovations can and do proceed with little direct relationship to technical innovations. There are many examples of such innovations in service industries over the past half century, such as self- 220</page><page sequence="11">Christopher Freeman service and supermarkets in retail distribution, containerisation in transport, or packaged holidays in tourism. While changes in physical lay-out played some part in these innovations, and preceding technical innovations in refrigeration, vehicles and communications play an important role, they had their own trajectory. As Schumpeter indicated, they can be treated in much the same way as a stream of technical innovations and are part of the general profit-driven dynamic of capitalism. They were related, however, to the wider social and technical trends of mass production, standardisation of consumer products, mass markets, car ownership and cheap energy. Thus they were far more influenced by the dominant contextual web of technical and economic development and the dominant style of management, (the " techno-economic paradigm "), than by specific technical innovations in each particular sector. It is essential to look, therefore, not just at individual innovations but at the entire system. The main purposes of the last section of this paper is to examine these systemic aspects of innovation. Some other organisational innovations were much more directly induced by technical innovations. Almost any major process or product innovation will lead to some corresponding organisational change in the company, for example changes in training systems, in maintenance procedures, in technical services and so forth. Joan Woodward [1968] argued on the basis of a thorough empirical survey that a firm's technology largely determined its organisation and management structure. But a big organisational innovation in the production system itself may also reciprocally affect technical innovations. Burton Klein [1977] describes the technical changes which followed the introduction of the assembly line by Ford: ... once the organisational change was made, the automobile firms found many opportunities for developing more efficient machines by making them more automatic. For example, replacement of the vertical turret lathe by a more automatic horizontal lathe doubled output per worker (p. 91). There is an interplay between technical and organisational innovation both inside and outside the innovating firms. This can ultimately lead to the organisation of completely new service industries as, for example, roadside garages to cope with maintenance and repair of motor vehicles or the wide range of contemporary computer-based consultancy services and data banks. However, response is not instantaneous. There are great disparities in the trajectories of innovations in different sectors and industries, and in a complex institutional environment there will be many cases of time lags and adjustment problems as well as " bottlenecks " in various parts of the system. Both Rosenberg [1976] and Hughes [1983] have emphasised these features of innovation very strongly in their histories of technology. The problems of " mis-match " between technology, firm-level organisation and other institutions are likely to be most severe when a radically new innovation or combination of innovations confronts an institutional environment which has been developed to accomodate a very different system of technology. Some processes of matching institutions and technology may take place at a local 221</page><page sequence="12">Revue economique level through organisational innovations at the level of the firm or group of firms. But the bigger changes in technology may lead to a wider process of institutional change involving the legal and political system, as well as the educational system, technical standards, tax and incentive systems and so forth. This is, of course, a reciprocal influence. This leads directly to the topic discussed in the final section of this paper: the interdependence of technological, economic and organisational develop- ments throughout the system and the way in which radically new technologies are able to enter and pervade the system, despite their initial disadvantages. CHANGES OF TECHNO-ECONOMIC PARADIGM So long as the emphasis is entirely on the individual firm, innovation or product, economic theory has not quite broken away from the mechanistic models which it too uncritically adopted from physics and mathematics. Diffusion research on the evolutionary development and selective improvement of individual products or processes is of course relevant to analysis and forecasting of specific innovations within the broad spectrum of new technologies. But if we are considering clusters of related innovations with the potential to affect a very broad range of products and processes and even the economy as a whole, as with electricity, steam power, mass production or computerisation, then a different approach is needed. The concern here is with the complementarities and externalities of families of interrelated technical, organisational and social innovations and with the rigidities of the built environment, institutional environment and established technological systems. In Schumpeter's analysis, it is these successive technological revolutions which underlie the Kondratieff cycles, or long waves of economic development, although he did not explore the interdependencies in each wave. An important first step is the identification of the charateristics of those major changes in technology which have such widespread consequences that they merit some such description as "technological revolution ", or " change in techno-economic paradigm ", or" change in technological regime ". Any such taxonomy or classification system, must of course do some violence to the infinite complexity of the real processes of technical and economic change. Nevertheless, a taxonomy is essential both for analytical purposes and as a tool for empirical research (Freeman and Perez [1986]). It is useful to distinguish between four categories of innovations and their diffusion : incremental innovations, radical innovations, new technology systems and changes of techno-economic paradigm. Incremental innovations occur more or less continuously, although at differing rates in different industries, but they are concerned only with improvements in the existing array of products, processes, organisations and systems of production. They are therefore closely linked to the development of 222</page><page sequence="13">Christopher Freeman market demand and the experiences of users. For this reason user-producer and learning-by-doing relationships are extraordinarily important for this type of innovation (Lundvall [1988]). Incremental innovations account for the vast majority of patents and award schemes in firms. They are reflected in the official measures of economic growth by changes in the coefficients in the existing input-output matrix. Although their combined effect is extremely important in the growth of productivity, no single one has dramatic effects, or induces structural change in the economy. Radical innovations are discontinuous events and they have been the main concern of most diffusion studies, frequently showing the typical sigmoid pattern identified in the standard diffusion models and in product cycle theory. They could not arise from the incremental improvement of an existing product, process or system. For example, nylon could not emerge from the improvement of natural materials, nor could the railway emerge from putting several stage coaches together, as Schumpeter observed. They involve both organisational and technical change, and just because they do not readily fit into the existing built and institutional environment they lead to structural changes in the economy. New technological systems are " constellations " (Keirstead, 1948) of innovations which are technically and economically interrelated. Obvious examples are the clusters of synthetic materials innovations, petrochemical innovations and plastics machinery innovations introduced in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. Another example is the " cluster " of electrically driven household consumer durables innovations. Nelson and Winter's [1982] " natural trajectories " help to explain the technical interrelatedness of these clusters of radical and incremental innovations, but economic interdependencies and organisational innovations are also important as, for example, in the habituation to consumer credit systems in the purchase of consumer durables or the externalities in skills, such as software skills, which become available as a technology matures. This same process of consolidation of a system, which is increasingly hospitable, explains why an innovation, which would have been conisidered very radical in the early phases of a technological trajectory, may assume an increasingly " incremental " character as time goes by (Perez [1988]). Changes of " techno-economic paradigm " correspond to the " creative gales of destruction " which are at the heart of Schumpeter's long wave theory. The introduction of electric power or steam power are examples of such deep-going transformations. A change of this kind carries with it many clusters of radical and incremental innovations and may embody a number of new technology systems. A vital characteristic of this fourth type of technical change is that it has pervasive effects throughout the economy, i.e. it not only leads to the 223</page><page sequence="14">Revue economique emergence of a new range of products, services, systems and industries in its own right; it also affects directly or indirectly almost every other branch of the economy as in the example of mass production. The expression " techno- economic " rather than " technological paradigm " emphasises that the changes are interactive, involving organisational as well as technical changes which go beyond specific product or process technologies. They affect the input cost structure and conditions of production and distribution throughout the system. This fourth category would correspond to Nelson and Winter's concept of " general natural trajectories " and once established as the dominant influence on engineers, designers and managers becomes a " technological regime " for several decades. In this perspective Schumpeter's long cycles may be seen as a succession of " techno-economic paradigms ". These long cycles may also indirectly affect such phenomena as art and literature (Korpinen [1987]), but this is beyond the scope of this paper. We now turn to an elaboration of the main characteristics of " techno- economic " paradigms and their patterns of evolutionary diffusion through long waves of economic development. A new techno-economic paradigm develops initially withint the old. This already presupposes a socio-economic system which tolerates or even encourages variety and experiment. However, the new technology becomes established as a dominant technological regime only after a long period of gestation and competition with the previously dominant technologies. It has to prove its potential and actual profitability, first in one or a few industries and its full success occurs only after a crisis of structural adjustment involving deep social and institutional changes and the replacement of the leading motive branches of the economy. The reasons for the mis-match arise from the different rates of change in various parts of the system as well as from inertia in the built environment and social institutions. Clearly one major characteristic of the diffusion pattern of a new techno- economic paradigm is its spread from the initial industries or areas of profitable application to a much wider range of industries and services and the economy as a whole. A " paradigm " change is a radical transformation of the prevailing engineering and managerial common sense for best productivity and most profitable practice, which is applicable to almost any industry. But its spread to other areas is usually heavily dependent on organisational and social changes. Examples are to be found today in the rapid growth of new types of software and consultancy firms, of data banks and of o&lt; value-added networks "t and the difficulties of diffusion of computer systems in some of the older service and manufacturing industries. The organising principle of each successive paradigm and the justification for the expression " techno-economic paradigm " is to be found not only in a new range of products and systems but in the dynamics of the relative cost structure of all possible inputs to production. Perez [1983] argues that in each new paradigm a particular input or set of inputs, which may be described as the " key factor " of that paradigm, fulfils the following conditions: 224</page><page sequence="15">Christopher Freeman (i) Clearly perceived low and rapidly falling relative cost. (ii) Apparently almost unlimited availability of supply over long periods. (iii) Clear potential for the use or incorporation of the new key factor or factors in many products and processes throughout the economic system either direcdy or (more commonly) through a set of related technical and organisational innovations, which both reduce the cost and change the quality of capital equipment, labour inputs, and other inputs to the systems. This combination of characteristics holds today for microelectronics and telecommunications. It held until recently for oil, which underlay the post-war boom (the " fourth Kondratieff " upswing). Before that, the role of key factor was played by low-cost steel in the " belle 6poque " before the First World War (Freeman [1990]), by low-cost coal and steam-powered transport in the Victorian " boom of the 19th century. Clearly, every one of these inputs identified as " key factors " in each period existed (and was in use) long before the new paradigm was fully developed. From a purely technical point of view, the explosive surge of interrelated innovations involved in a technological revolution could probably have occurred earlier. But, as Perez pointed out [1988], there are strong economic factors that first of all delay but later stimulate diffusion and improvement innovations. The massive externalities created to favour the diffusion and generalisation of an existing paradigm act as a powerful deterrent to change for a prolonged period. Arthur [1988] has demonstrated just how powerful these containment mechanisms are, and David [1985] has shown how they can be influenced by technical standards. The existing stock and availability of skills, capital equipment, components, markets and enabling institutions is an extremely powerful combination favouring the already established techno- economic paradigm. The frustrations and difficulties involved in the early diffusion of computer-related innovations were often described in the 1950s and 1960s and similarly with electric power in the 1860s, 1870s and 1880s. Clearly, this approach implies a framework for evolutionary development which stresses the systems context rather than just the individual product or firm. Clearly, too it differs radically from the dominant conceptualisation both in most evolutionary theory with its emphasis on the innovating firm or product and with neo-classical economic theory, although it has points of contact such as the persistent search for least-cost combinations of factor inputs. Most formulations of neo-classical theory put the main emphasis on varying combinations of labour and capital and on substitution between them, and implicitly or explicitly assume reversibility and responsiveness even to small changes in these relative factor prices in either direction. This approach stresses the system's response to major changes in the price of new inputs, and new technologies which exploit their potential to reduce costs of both labour and capital as a result of new total factor input combinations and organisation- managerial innovations. Once the new technology is widely adopted the 225</page><page sequence="16">Revue economique change is irreversible. Brian Arthur's [1988] work on path dependence shows very clearly why this is so. At the level of the firm, the new " ideal " information-intensive organi- sation now emerging increasingly links design, management, production and marketing into one integrated system - a process which may be described as " systemation " and goes far beyond the earlier concepts of mechanisation and automatisation. Antonelli [1989] has described the combination of organisational innovations as the emergence of the " network firm ". Firms organised on this new basis can produce a flexible and rapidly changing mix of products and services, taking advantage of varying international prices of inputs and demand changes. However, collaborative arrangements between firms, networking arrangements and strategic alliances are also increasingly characte- ristic of the industrial environment both nationally and internationally. Like the multinational corporation, these new networks can take advantage of the growing externalities provided by the global telecommunications infrastructure, which will ultimately bring down to extremely low levels the costs of transmitting very large quantities of information all over the world. These developments are already transforming international monetary and investment flows, as well as design and R&amp;D information flows. The transformation of the profile of capital equipment is no less radical although heavily constrained by the factors relating to the built environment discussed in Section 2 and by the problems of organisational change in the education and training systems for software skills. Computers are increasingly associated with all types of productive equipment as in CNC machine tools, robotics and process control instruments as well as with the design process through CAD, and with administrative functions through data processing systems, all linked by data transmission equipment. According to some estimates computer-based capital equipment already accounts for nearly half of all new fixed investment in plant and equipment in the USA. A special supplement to The Economist (30 May 1987) entitled " Factory of the Future " outlined the complete reorganisation of the production system which is now taking place and is far more important than any particular discrete piece of equipment, even though the associated investment may take place incrementally and involve much trial and error: For the first time in three-quarters of a century the factory is being reinvented from scratch. Long, narrow production lines with men crawling all over them a feature of manufacturing everywhere since the early days of the car-making dynasties - are being ripped apart and replaced with clusters of all-purpose machines huddled in cells run by computers and served by nimble-fingered robots. The whole shape of the industrial landscape is changing in the process. ... In short nothing less than a whole new style of manufacturing is in the process of being defined. It is because of this " new style of manufacturing " that evolutionary models can no longer concentrate, as in the 1970s and 1980s, on discrete product innovations of firms but must take full account of system changes as 226</page><page sequence="17">Christopher Freeman well. For this reason there is now a proliferation of studies on the diffusion of " computer-integrated manufacturing ", " flexible manufacturing systems ", " computer-aided design " and so forth (e.g. Antonelli [1989]). But just as the natural environment constrains the range and effectiveness of alternative solutions to environmental hazards and crises, so too the built environment and the institutional environment constrain the feasible range of adaptations of the new techno-economic paradigm. There is some freedom to redefine what is socially acceptable in terms of work intensity, work environment, labour relations and so forth and the Japanese " just-in-time " approach is not an immutable or unique solution to the new range of organisational and managerial problems. But the scope for alternatives depends on the depth of understanding of the nature of the paradigm change, the power of the competitive and " locking-in " processes, and the forms of international competition in the world economy as well as on social and political programmes and conflicts. Finally, it is clear that the capacity to make innovations will vary at different times at the national level. Periods of paradigm change are also periods of great but uneven opportunity (Perez and Soete [1988]). For a variety of reasons it seems probable that Japanese institutional innovations in management systems, including the management of R&amp;D, government policies for technology and the organisation of large firms will temporarily provide a particularly favourable environment for the new technologies (Freeman [1987]). Clearly there is competition between the Japanese national economy and others, but here too the cruder forms of biological evolutionary analogy break down. There is a selective process at work but this does not necessarily lead to war or to the disappearance of the alternatives. There is also scope for mutual learning and cooperation in the regulation of the international system. This depends on further institutional and political innovations but it is certainly a possible path, just as at other levels the survival and adapta- tion of firms and individuals is possible through a learning process and through mutual aid. " Creative destruction " does not necessarily mean the disappearance of firms as both Penrose [1952] and Pavitt [1984, 1986] have pointed out. As Silverberg [1988] puts it in his discussion of evolutionary models: ... We are not always free to do what we want because the rest of the system may react in a very conservative identity-preserving way, or in counter-intuitively disastrous ones. On the other hand, verv astutely applied change by an appro- priately situated agent such as governments, social movements, etc. may be able to trigger a complete and self-propagating reorganisation of the system to an unequivocally more favourable state, which may not be attainable by the agents acting routinely on their own (p. 555). The experience of China since 1949 and of the Soviet Union since 1917 could be interpreted as examples of overestimation by both governments and " social movements " of the degrees of freedom in attempting to reshape both the technology and the economy. They were also examples of underestimation 227</page><page sequence="18">Revue economique of the enormous conformist pressures of the capitalist world market. This is certainly not to say that all such attempts are doomed to failure, only that the freedom to reshape technology and society depends on depth of understanding. It also depends critically on an experimental willingness to reassess experience and to learn in an open-minded way from both social and technical innovations. In other words, glasnost is an absolutely essential condition for attempts at perestroika. Human beings will continue to strive for socially desirable reforms or ideal visions of society and human motivation certainly cannot be excluded from evolutionary models of social change even if what people actually achieve turns out to be very different from their ideals. But to avoid dogmatic Utopianism a constant process of debate and social learning is essential. Civil liberty is not a luxury but a necessity for an innovative society. CONCLUSIONS In the resurgence of evolutionary economics, analogies with biological theories have had a very important stimulating role. This paper has argued that the analogies should be pursued not only to indicate similarities but also to highlight differences between evolution in the natural world and the evolution of human social systems. It has pointed to four main differences: (1) The greater complexity and various levels of the selection environment in social evolution comprising not only the natural environment but also a built environment and a complex institutional environment. It is not only a question of the selective adaptation of individual tools, products or firms but also of wider forms of social organisation, of production, an interconnected web of technologies and of a variety of social institutions. The systems level is very important in any analysis (Clark [1990]). (2) The teleological aspect of human evolutionary processes. Some biological theories also postulate an element of " design " in natural evolution and it is also possible to overestimate the degrees of freedom which human beings enjoy both in technical and in organisational design. Nevertheless, there is a real difference perhaps best illustrated by the fact that human beings now confront the possibility of eliminating some hereditary diseases through advances in scientific understanding and medical technology. This is a degree of purposive intervention which is now reaching the level of the natural genes themselves. (3) As this example also illustrates, social learning processes, knowledge accumulation and diffusion of knowledge have features which are unique to human societies. Any satisfactory evolutionary theory must pay special attention to those human institutions which play a central role in those processes (see, for example, Clark [1989]). 228</page><page sequence="19">Christopher Freeman (4) The above-mentioned three features of social evolution mean that technology both shapes its socio-economic environment and is in turn shaped by it. Neither is a sole determinant of the other. The two co-determine each other " (Sahal [1986]). In this complex process of " co-determination " this paper has emphasised a unique feature of techno-economic evolution - the succession of techno-economic paradigms involving a complex process of matching and mutual adjustment between pervasive new technologies, the built environment and the organisational/institutional framework within which these technologies develop. Again, of course, it is possible to stretch the biological metaphor and to make analogies with theories of " punctuated evolution ". But in the end social scientists have really no alternative but to go beyond analogies and develop their own evolutionary models. REFERENCES BIBLIOGRAPHIQUES ALLEN P.
