<plain_text><page sequence="1">Earthly Delights BY SANDRA LEONG ~Whenever I've nothing to do, they find me on the terrace. When they see that I'm not smoking or sulking, they're relieved. They attribute it to a culturally based longing for humidity. It's August. This is their first baby, and I'm their first baby nurse. Chris and Isabel. Penthouse apartment. Maid's room. Lacking confidence in themselves, they ask themselves questions about me. Can she soothe the baby? Hear the baby? Is she neat and clean? Does she feel love? Superficial enchantment? What does she hide? Why are we curious? I'm expensive, and that, too, makes me important. T'hey're admiring but nervous of my education, as though the instincts may have been drummed out of me. I never hide my education in the interview. It's one of my best features. I tell them that instincts are a small part of it. They'll soon see how far their instincts take them. I'm serious. I'm not for everyone. And though I come well recommended, they're at first a little mystified about how I can be nurturing without the bulk more common to baby nurses. If asked directly (and I'm not), I'd tell them: It's not about fat. It's about surrender. Fve never been fired, and I'm often asked to stay on beyond the usual six weeks. Chris called when the contractions started. He asked if I were still available, as though before this, the baby had been too intangible to truly bind me. They wanted me right away. To mind Rafe the bloodhound. I knew they were confused, but came anyway.</page><page sequence="2">540 The Antioch Review When the baby comes home I've already been there a day. Rafe and I are good buddies. I've seen Chris on one pit stop to shave. He apologized for having no photos. After eight hours. I've enjoyed the terrace. The things are washed and folded and tucked and smoothed. All is serene. The baby's a little lump. Isabel's eyes are swollen from labor. Chris is nervous, proud, elated, miserable. They make a lot of how easy the first twenty-four hours were. Isabel eyes me, cheery. She regards my breasts when she hands the baby over. Way paranoid. I greet the baby, call him Pumpkin. Everyone relaxes for a moment. Even Rafe' s tail thumps a few hopeful thumps. There is love. Love all around. It springs from all our hearts. The baby's name is Phil. Already foreshortened. Perhaps, he's meant to fill a void. Perhaps, it's hoped he'll drink his fill easily. Perhaps, he's to be ambiguously associated with tropical nuts rather than the ambivalently loved dead uncle. It's the name of ajaunty player. To me he's Pumpkin. The rest is their business. Rafe follows me into the nursery, though you see his heart rip casually in half at his inability to properly greet Chris and Isabel. He presses his muzzle against the blankets, snuffles deliriously. The baby's smell is as complex and overwhelming as a freshly unearthed truffle. It gives him anguish. He barks a whining bark. I check the baby. Swaddle him. His head's the size of a grapefruit. He's asleep, but soon he's hungry, crying. "To mommy," I tell him. He's eight pounds and wants what he wants. Isabel's in bed in a fresh nightgown. Her ears, sharpened by hormone blasts, heard the first peep. She's been on alert for his appearance, like someone counting seconds between lightning and thunder. She takes him gingerly. She's cautious of the awakening of her own greed for him, his piercing sensual necessity. Though she might think of what I do as a sacrifice to his bottomlessness. At any rate, it's calming to have a buffer, a first line of defense. Should terrifying need erupt, I'll take the first hit. She fumbles. The urge to nurse without the expertise is like preco- cious sex. It compels, and hurts. It feels more like curiosity than desire. Smart baby latches on, gentle but firm. Isabel's face goes from anxious to gentle, too. I go to the kitchen to make juice.</page><page sequence="3">Earthly Delights 541 Chris is there eating granola, looking sheepish. Eat, I tell him. Life goes on. He laughs. I'm surprised at his sociability. I have a bag of fruit selected piece by piece from the corner stands on my route from the bus stop. I have a perfect mango from Third Avenue. Bananas from Lexington. Peaches from 86th. They're cheap and beautiful. I place one on the counter by his hand. You competed with the Jamaican nannies for those, he says. I find the blender and place it on the counter. I unwrap a banana. It peels smoothly. I had a Jamaican nanny, growing up, I tell him. Most back off at this point, fearing something too close to home. How'd you get into this business, he asks? He's a voluble one, apparently. It's not a business, I tell him. It's a calling. He looks unimpressed. I'm as driven to do the work I do as a singer is to sing. The noise of the blender disrupts further communication. I pour. He's still there. He looks deprived. Have some, I tell him. I set a glass in front of him, a blushing puree. He stares at it glumly, but not without curiosity. I take another into the bedroom, where Isabel and Pumpkin rock in a rocker. I give her the glass. Cows eat grass, I tell her. She takes it dutifully. Function is sweet. And I'm a ministering angel. Isabel's breasts empty. Pumpkin is mine again. I carry him to the nursery. He's sleepy, the size of a loaf. Lips mushed and sensual. I swaddle him tight and put him down in his bassinette. On the terrace, I sip my juice and peer over at Chris. Rafe clings. The infant monitor hanging from a chain around my neck isn't a leash. It allows mobility, more like an electric collar. It's humid, humid. Someone has managed to cultivate a lemon tree up here. It must spend its winters in a greenhouse. I pet Rafe. I decide I like bloodhounds. I like their comical, anthropomorphic nobility. Chris wanders closer. Rafe likes you, he tells me. I tell him, I like Rafe. The humidity doesn't bother you? he asks.</page><page sequence="4">542 The Antioch Review I was born in a Turkish bath, I tell him. Are you Muslim? he wants to know. He's so far off. Not even warm. I tell him, I'm from the United Colors, the melting pot at the end of the Rainbow Coalition. I relent and tell him California. For some reason, New Yorkers like explanations having to do with California. I hear it, he tells me. In the enunciation. He laughs. In the way you prolong your vowels, he adds. I wonder if he's always this easy to amuse, or if he's one of the legions shattered by fatherhood. It keeps me entertained, I tell him. Pumpkin asserts himself inarticulately. I go in to check. I hear Chris tell Isabel he's going to the office for a bit. The house seems to quiet down in his absence. Pumpkin has settled back to sleep, unperturbed by the vibrations I make as I waft in and out of his room. Rafe's nails click like a metronome. It's 4:30 in the afternoon, and Isabel snores, her blinds drawn. Newborns can make every moment seem like the middle of the night. I did have a daughter. But I like to admit this only when the pressure to explain myself is absent. Why, after all, should I have to link my occupation with any prior circumstance? It's what we insist upon with serial killers (his mother was a prostitute who tortured him with candles) or presidents (his father had big bucks and he was president of his high school class). But a baby nurse? Leave me alone to do my job. I never make an issue of what the parents do. They're parents. I like their apartment. The furniture is unconventional, lots of angles that aren't right angles, colors where there are usually neutrals. It's playful, stylish, grown-up. A baby skullcap has perched itself upon an acid green chair. When I first encountered the self-contained, compressed decor of the Upper East Side, I felt pity for the children. Growing up in stage sets. The way you might feel for babies born into circus families. I realize my envy and insecurity generated those feelings. And my loyalty to my suburban roots. And my sense of being an intruder. I no longer have unease in the homes of strangers. I'm more familiar with the core of need that I've come to service. Now I appreciate its beauty and stability and universality. Encountering it again and again is a form of riches. Now I think I'm privileged to love babies. Never having to miss or regret what they become. Or be accused of misanthropy.</page><page sequence="5">Earthly Delights 543 I treat my baby with tenderness. I ease his loneliness. I smooth him, I rock him, I differentiate for him his hungers. The immediacy of my finger in his mouth, the partner to his hard suck, can calm him if he's not hungry. But if he's hungry, it can't. I love the competence of the baby's mouth, so full of power and discernment. The genius of hard palate and tongue and muscular cheeks. Some babies are Coltranes. This one's a joyful Charlie Parker. Isabel appears. She waddles. Her nightgown flutters. The outline of her deflated belly is oddly bereft. She tells me she's a fucking jellyfish. A birth passage on stilts. A comfy chair. I tell her she's having an identity crisis. She's a goddess. (She does look like one. Of the Pre-Columbian variety.) I'm a life-support machine, she says. I don't even know what to eat. She's in tears. I never break down and cook unless asked directly. Why don't you order some sushi? I suggest. I like sushi, she says. But you said that cows eat grass. Have some seaweed with it, I say. And, besides, you're not a cow. Chris walks in, and Isabel turns to him with the plan. I don't like take-out sushi, he grumbles. Husbands are at their most endearing when there's a life-threaten- ing component to things. That's when they're the doting, overheated Ricky Ricardos. The rest of the time, they seem to need urging to keep them paying attention. But she persists, and he submits, sweetly getting it. He allows mother and son the mood-lifting effects of essential Omega-3 fatty- acids. New mom is mollified. The machinery of bonding hums. Mol- ecules will permeate, adsorb, and nourish. She smiles, all tired radi- ance. A halo appears. I leave the family group, and go to the terrace. There are juxtapositions of sky and trellis where, lying just so on an uncomfortable wire chaise, the effect of vine-green against the blue might place you anywhere on earth. Same thing is true of unobstructed views of moon at night. The disc draws you like a loved one's face. No matter where: Home is a twist of the earth away. So in an hour or so I'm in Pumpkin's room again. He moves his head, sniffing. Eyes open, he leads with his cheek like a blind catfish with feelers. What makes him think that what he seeks is near? I pick him up. We already know things, he and I. I change his diaper.</page><page sequence="6">544 The Antioch Review Wrap him for transport. When we're in Isabel's room, he starts to cry. Hairbrush in hand, she startles, irritated. She looks reproachful. Like she's thinking, Who created this need? She puts her brush down, and cradles him without speaking. He coughs and latches on. Then she's all contentment. Let him cry a little before you pick him up, she murmurs. OK, I say. Just a little, she says. OK, I say. On the terrace, on the table next to my chaise, there's a red tray on which a lit candle, a dish of seaweed, an unagi-avocado hand roll, and a white orchid have appeared. Leftovers, Chris says to me, standing by the sliding doors. If you want. A pause. Not to offend, he adds. I'm delighted, but I'm checking for spiderweb strands of guilt and need; households are thick with them. Sweet of you, I say. Thank you. Are you sure you or Isabel won't want this later? That said, I nibble the hand roll. The nori sheet that wraps it is still crisp, the flesh of eel and avocado sublimely buttery and sweet, the harsh wasabi stings my tear ducts. I close my eyes. The red light of the candle plays against my lids. I hear a breath, less than a whisper: You're beautiful. I open my eyes, but I'm alone. Alone except for Rafe, well-trained dog, lying next to me, expecting no scraps. It could have been a hallucination. But it wasn't. I know because, until now, I've had no desire, and thus no reason for wishful thinking. There's the tang of violation. A tang that fades, and leaves the residue of something warmer and more ambiguous. Rafe sighs. At such moments, I feel fully the wobbly contradictions of baby nurses. Unknown even to the babies they nurse. Unknown to them- selves. A breeze stirs. I'm conscious of my strong back and limbs, my good teeth, my health. My hair lifts in the wind. In daytime it glows. My money is my own. When I go home, I go home to a tidy room. Not a peasant. Nor a victim. Not a concubine or a slave.</page><page sequence="7">Earthly Delights 545 Yet some words, without appropriate context, once uttered, are relentless in seeking a home. No trace elements of gothic heroine. I'm not really an employee. I'm a professional. Baby nurse. The breeze dies. The air thickens. As if surfacing, I return to the air- conditioned rooms. Isabel and Pumpkin have moved from the rocker to the bed. She's side-lying, and he's fallen asleep at her breast. As I move to pick him up, she puts out her hand. Leave him for now, she whispers. He's so dear. Lucky Pumpkin. In spite of all planning, all resolve, he's been chosen. Too dear to let go. So it's my time to sleep. She may well decide to relinquish him in the exhaustion of the wee hours. Does anyone but me know how decisively something has hap- pened? She's fallen for Pumpkin. She'll subsist on self-sacrifice, savor draughts of sleeplessness, demand more. Now if I'm the first to respond to him, I'll be the usurper. Our intimacy will be her burden. She'll monitor the songs I pour into his ears. Not want him to love the smell of me. When the obsession slackens, I'll be long gone. A scolding nanny will be hired for the early childhood activities. I worked for a woman who had the wrong baby brought to her for the first feeding in the hospital. She glimpsed the wristband as the baby, sated and sleepy, was being taken away. They made quite a stink about it, got the Board involved, but the memory still depresses her. Like a love affair that ended badly. Though in certain aboriginal tribes, I hear, any breast is a match for an infant. I imagine the wet nurse. The odd miscegenation of it, the sort of bovine ecstasy of it. The baby, a prince, dripping with jewels. The nursery alive with hunting scenes. He's asleep at the breast, his mouth grown soft and exquisite around it. The wet nurse, heavy-lidded with pleasure, eyes the stag on a spear. I think of my daughter.</page><page sequence="8">546 The Antioch Review She's in a curio cabinet. Too small and fragile to touch. A metaphor for the workings of memory? Enclosed, fleeting, encased, reified. Her veins collapsed threads of consciousness. Her life a condensation of many, in the compressed hours in which it was hoped that her lungs would perform. I held my breath, unwilling to breathe without her. They kept the cord patent, for the instillation of tiny, magical droplets. I could be with her for brief periods. Touch smooth glass. Prehistoric insects are preserved in amber, and worn as jewels by dowagers. They're frozen in the moments of their deaths, and betray no agony. Witchlike, the impulse to wear them. Yet, instead of earnest neonatology fellows threading lines, I prefer to think of schoolgirls stringing beads. The touch of beads against the neck are cooling, and reminders of the link to mother when meeting a potential mate. The touch is like the light pressure of fingers as mother fusses with her daughter's hair, investing herself in her beauty. A leap of faith in a world where beauty is cherished, but often plundered, or destroyed. My daughter is beautiful, and grotesque, and still. Perfect as only the unwritten can be perfect. Her mouth not dead, but unawakened. If it had been only my body that drew him, I would have resisted. But it was the curve of my cheek that he stroked first, with the side of his finger. A touch that asked a question. Which my body pondered. I am happy to be able to say this about more than one man in my lifetime. The question of resisting calls up the specter of some sort of blame. In what ways didn't I blame us after her death? It was as though guilt were latent in all pleasure, the predator in the grass, but potentially vanquished, entombable. As though the possibil- ity of a child had kept it all at bay. But in general, I tend to think shallowly about responsibility. Money, I still think, would have made a crucial difference in how things panned out. In the way we were treated. In the way we treated ourselves, and each other. In this thinking I, to some, reveal a whopping failure of character. To them, my denial of the primacy of sexual guilt and punishment (in the incubator, at times, saintly tears formed in the corners of her closed lids, her face serene as a martyr's) is rebellious in the extreme. Without this guilt, nothing will ever be clear, or unequivocal.</page><page sequence="9">Earthly Delights 547 Where did the dance, the fiction this time around, begin? In acts of polite intimacy? In the tenderness of seeing? I've saved the white orchid. It's beautiful and rare (though inexpli- cable as a garnish in elite Japanese takeout). And fragrant against my face. Chris, restless, looks for me on the terrace, finds me in my room. Perhaps he's reassured by the sight of his gift in a tumbler among my things. So that he forgets the pretence of a question. And, for me, forgetting allows remembering. So that, when his fingers brush my hair, it's my daughter's face that turns in the direction of the touch. Her lips that open in an 0, feral, sensual, awakened at last to hunger. And if I had made her up would my assertion be more, or less depraved? And if not real, then what would it be? His lips clamp down on mine, his mouth sucks, strongly, like a tidal pull. Forever we're like this, tongues merged with hard palate and purposeful against resistance. What he drinks from my mouth, my entire body yields. And yields once more. And again. And, with the lightest of pressure, once more. The tilt of my head releases tears, which stream into my ears. They're tears of relief and joy. And awe, at the emergence of hunger. There've been weeks when I've gone without even water, until my kidneys bled. When we're spent in one sphere, though agitated in another, he returns to his bed. The sadness of parting mouths is cloaked in sleep. He rests beside his baby, the bubble of milk still on baby's lips. And I rest with mine. A few hours later, he returns with Pumpkin, just fed. I take him to the nursery. Good baby, calm baby settles in his crib, still asleep. We gaze at him. Whatever is between us is before and beyond speech. Wise father not to attempt to speak about it. Pumpkin sighs, his ecstasy deep. No judge of us. His hand unfurls, the palm open, the simplest gesture of love.</page></plain_text>
