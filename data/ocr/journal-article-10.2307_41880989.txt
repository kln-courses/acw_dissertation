<plain_text><page sequence="1">[1] 55 THE THEOLOGY OF KITÃB AL-USÜS : AN EARLY PSEUDEPIGRAPHIC NUSAYRÏ WORK The treatise studied here, Kitäb al-usüs (Book of Foundations), is a lengthy Nusayrl theological work contained in the Nusayrl Codex, Paris, Bibliothèque Nationale, fonds arabe 1449 (folios 1-79)1. It is an eclectic theological work dis- cussing, somewhat erratically, a plethora of Nusayrl doctrines. The language of the treatise is «middle Arabic». The treatise is characterized by grammatical and syntactic phenomena typical of other Nusayrl compositions found in this codex as well as in the Nusayrl codex, Paris, fonds arabe 14502. The date of its composition is unknown. However, a reference to it in a Nusayrl polemical work by Yüsuf ibn al-'Ajüz al-Nashshãbl al-Halabí, a late thirteenth century Nusayrl scholar3, provi- des us with a terminus ante quem for its composition. According to the colophon the manuscript was copied in 1206/1791-1792 by al-Shayh Yüsuf ibn al-'Arïb in the village Ra's Ba'liya in the region Saflta, district of Tripoli4. The literary framework of the treatise is pseudepigraphic. King Solomon is said to have received a divine order for writing this book. He is therefore declared to be «the foundation (asas) of all things pertaining to the knowledge of this book5», hence the title Kitäb al-usüs. Solomom's role is further reflected in the al- 1 For a brief description of this treatise, see G. Vajda and Y.

Bar-Asher and A. Kofsky [2] ternative title of the work, Kitäb ma'rifat hikmat Sulaymãn ibn Dãwud6. To com- pose this book Solomom assembles numerous sages representing the great cultu- res of the world. These sages are charged by the king to write a book that will pa- rallel the exemplar received by Solomon from God - namely, the Kitãb abniyat al- kalãm or Ta lif abniyat al-kalãm [The Book of Structures of Speech]. The sages produce a dialogue in the form of questions and answers between an anonymous master and a disciple. This book, Kitãb al-usüs , turns out to be similar to its divi- ne archetype, and the author of the Arabic version identifies the anonymous ma- ster and disciple as Seth [son of Adam] and Idrls [Enoch], respectively7. The book is said to be a translation from the Greek8 of a work written by King Solo- mon by divine order. Kitãb al-usüs , like other NusayrI texts in the Paris codices (fonds arabe 1449 and 1450), is characterized by its unsystematic nature, which may be due to its dialogue format. The connections between the different stages of the discussion are associative; the author does not systematically develop views on any one point. In this analysis of the work we have attempted to put together the pieces of the mosaic and to reconstruct a comprehensive picture of the author's main doctri- nes. Some of the basic concepts treated in this work are familiar from other NusayrI texts. However, Kitãb al-usüs stands out in using certain concepts and terminology uncommon in other NusayrI writings. Christian doctrines and termi- nology, for example, occupy a relatively prominent place and the author frequen- tly advances analogies between Jesus and 'All to illustrate various aspects of the NusayrI divine mystery. The work is liberally sprinkled with canonical and apo- cryphal sayings of Jesus. However the numerous apocryphal references attest to an acquaintance with the canonical Gospels that is indirect. The role of angelo- logy and prophetology in the theology of Kitãb al-usüs is also remarkable. In addi- tion, the author demonstrates an impressive knowledge of the Qur'an, which he frequently interprets in an innovative and far-reaching manner. Hence the author of Kitãb al-usüs emerges as an erudite scholar of NusayrI learning who is also ver- sed in Christian and Muslim scriptures or at least in those parts adaptable to his peculiar theological exegesis. 6 Ibid. 1 Pseudepigraphic authorship by Seth is very common in Gnostic literature.

Like the presumably earlier proto-Nusayrl work Kitãb al-haft wa l-azilla , Kitäb al-usüs evinces considerable interest in cosmology and cosmogony; indeed, some of the major elements may have been derived from cosmological doctrines found already in Kitäb al-haft wa l-azilla. The whole order of creation is conceived of as the result of a voluntary act of God and not of a deterministic or accidental process9. There is a series of emanations, the first of which is the spiritual world. The angels were created10 and subsequently the spiritual, luminary human beings were created in an angelic form11. At the conclusion of this spiritual creation the angels and these spiritual beings engaged in contemplation of the deity12. This ge- neral notion of the creation of the spiritual world does not entirely harmonize with another, mythological cosmogonie concept found elsewhere in Kitäb al-usüs. According to this concept God also created a primordial cosmic man who encom- passed the whole of the spiritual and physical cosmos13. This second cosmology is founded on the principle of the typological number of seven ruling the cosmos. The cosmic primordial man thus embraces the whole of creation, which is organi- zed in units of seven in the various domains (such as the heavens, the planets and the oceans), including the sevenfold cycles of human reincarnation14. After crea- ting this primordial spiritual man in his own image, God engaged in lauding and glorifying himself for seven thousands years so as to teach the angels and the spiri- tual humans to imitate him. The motivation for this divine instruction was God's wish to teach them to describe him in proper ways without any anthropomorphic tendency15. God revealed himself in his omnipotence to the angels, who subsequently acknowledged his divine sovereignty. He then revealed himself to the pristine spi- ritual entities of human beings in their own form and disclosed his signs and 9 Ibid., 37a, lines 10-12. 10 Ibid., 8a-b. 11 Ibid., 9a. Our text alludes specifically to the creation of the cosmic spiritual Adam. 12 Ibid., 8a, line 12. H The concept of a primordial cosmic man, which plays an important role in Nusayrl myth, has a long tradition in religious speculation. It appears in Gnosticism as well as in Jewish mysticism. See e.g. Irenaeus, the second century Church Father, Adversus omnes Haereses (= Against Heresies), 1, 30, 6 in B. Layton, The Gnostic Scriptures (Garden City, N.Y., 1987), 176; G.G. SCHOLEM, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism (New York, 1941), 215. See also M. IDEL, «The Image of Man above the Sefirot », Daat (A Journal of Jewish Philosophy and Kabbalah ), 4 (1980), 41-55. 14 Kitäb al-usüs, 27 a. This cosmological symbolism seems to derive from Kitãb al-haft wa l-azilla, in which the number seven plays a central role, as alluded to in the title of the book Kitãb al-haft wa l- azilla , where haft is the Persian word for seven. See also W. Madelung's review of A. Tamer's edition of that book (Beirut, 1969) in Der Islam, 38 (1963), 181. For a German translation of selected passages of this work see H. Halm, Die Islamische Gnosis: Die extreme Schia und die Alawiten (Zurich and Munich, 1982), 246-274.

Bar- Ash er and A. Kof sky [4] knowledge to them, and they acknowledged him. In return God made a covenant with them, which is, according to Nusayrî interpretation, referred to in the Qur'an16. The author of Kitãb al-usüs is not aware of any cleavage in the creation pro- cess between God's creation of the spiritual and the physical worlds. Although he is somewhat vague, it appears that he views the whole of creation as being the re- sult of a single cosmic process encompassing all the constituents of the universe, including heaven and every living creature, all of which he describes in philo- sophic-scientific terminology17. This harmonious view of creation, however, is not consistent with his understanding of human existence in this world. Here the author seems to be caught unwittingly in a cognitive dissonance. On the one hand, human existence is beset by an inherent dualistic tension as a result of a cri- sis in the divine spiritual world that led to the fall and materialization of the elect part of humanity, the Nusayrls, who are the «sons of light», as opposed to the rest of humanity, predestined to slavery as the «sons of darkness18». On the other hand, the whole cosmic order seems to be preordained and focused around hu- manity, or rather around the Nusayrî elect, as the centre of the universe. This world is indeed a world under divine providence; but it is all the same a world from which the Nusayrî gnostic must escape in order to restore his ideal pristine state in the divine spiritual realm of light. This is not the extreme dualistic cosmos of the ancient gnostics but a rather world where human existence is subject to dualistic tension. Gnosis offers the only path to liberation from the exile and con- flict that characterize human existence. The Nusayrî human spirits in the divine world sinned in ignorance and pride. They began to misconceive the true and primordial essence of God, who appea- red to them in a spiritual human form. Their punishment was their fall into the material world and their descent into bodies19. The Nusayrî view of the human fall from the spiritual divine world is expounded in an interpretation of the story of the expulsion of Adam from Paradise. Paradise is actually the state of the hu- man soul as a luminary essence in the divine realm of light, and Adam is the pro- totype of the soul of the Nusayrî gnostic. The root of his original sin was that he innocently approached the tree symbolizing the world of heresy20 without posses- sing full gnosis. Adam's sin is conceived of as grave but not unpardonable, in a fa- 16 Kitab al-usus , 68a-b, and see below, note 68. 17 Kitab al-usus , 63b-67b. 18 Ibid., 57a, lines 7-8.

It was only after the fall that Adam was placed in the bondage of the commandments22. This description of the hu- man condition suggests that our author advocates here a position of antinomian theology, possibly offering scriptural legitimacy for the traditional NusayrI antino- mianism regarding the commandments of Islam23. It should be noted, however, that in the classical NusayrI literature familiar to us this antinomianism is never in- terpreted in a libertine or hedonistic fashion. Despite the fall God has given Adam an opportunity to restore his original state in Paradise24. This provides the theoretical basis for the gnostic to regain the state of Adam before the original sin. After the expulsion from Paradise, Adam, or the gnostic, is punished with seven cycles of reincarnation (takrirät) in retribu- tion for his heretical denial of the seven heavens ( yarjiu ilã dhãlika l-mawdť h atta ya rifa rahbahu ft sab'i takrírãt kamã jahilahu fï satti samãwãt)25 . However, he eventually returns to the pristine state of liberty where he is free of religious com- mandments and is rewarded solely for his deeds26. On the road back to Paradise the gnostic is assisted by divine grace ( al-minna )27 in his individual struggle toward spiritual progress, but only perfection in gnosis of the various emanations of the deity offers the way towards complete liberation from slavery to external re- ligious commandments. «Once the believer attains perfection and achieves gnosis and knows his Lord, his hijãbs, maqãms, bãbs , yatïms 28, he leaves the state of bon- dage and enters that of the free; his bonds are undone, and all that was forbidden to him becomes permitted ( idhã kamula l-muminu wa balagha al-ma'rifa iva ' arafa rabbahu wa hujubahu wa maqãmãtihi wa abwãbahu wa aytãmahu... fa qad kharaja min al- ubüdiyya wa sara ilã manzilat al-ahrãr wa ruft a ' anhu l-ãsãr wa ubiha lahu kullu mã kãna mahzür [!]»29 The divine gnosis - namely, the correct knowledge of the divine mystery - thus becomes the primary purpose of human existence30. 2 ' On the Ismail! antinomian concept of Paradise and eschatology, see Abu Muhammad AL-Ha- san B.

Bar-Asher and A. Kofsky [6] The author does not elaborate on the connection between the NusayrI myth of the fall and the appearance of physical human life. It seems that he accepts the traditional story of Adam and Eve for the beginning of the human race without special concern for reconciling the myth of the fall with the beginning of huma- nity. Physical existence, however, begins outside Paradise, with the procreation of humanity. The author is troubled by the absence of any precedence for the pro- cesses of life - pregnancy, birth and nurturing children. How would Eve have learnt these fundamental necessities? The resolution of this difficulty leads to a general principle for understanding the early development of mankind. The first human beings were assisted by God in their beginning steps in the world. God created for Eve an image of a woman that demonstrated the act of maternity and was imitated by Eve: When [God] created him [Adam] and wished to marry him off, He inserted into him a spirit from His body. He then made Eve for him [Adam] and she felt reassured towards him for He created her from his rib, and when Adam went in unto her she conceived and had an easy pregnancy. When she was about to give birth God formed for her an image of a woman in pregnancy, restraining herself until she gave birth, then she [the image] cut her umbilical cord31 and tied up her dress and as Eve watched the acts of the image she imitated her. Then Eve regarded the image swaddling her newborn and did the same [with her child]... {fa lammã an khalaqahu wa arada an yu- zawwijahu salaka fthi rühan min badanihi fa ja ala lahu Hawwã fa sakanat ilayhi Itannahu khalaqahã min dil'ihi; fa lammã taghashshahã hamalat ham- Ian khaflfan fa lammã [a]rãdat talidu sawwara lahã sürata unthã lahã ham- lun ; tazjuru fi hamlihã hattã waladat thumma qata'at surratahã 32 wa shaddat qimãtahã fa lammã ra at Hawwã mã sana at al- sura sana' at mithlahã ...)33 The first appearance of death and murder in the world is similarly explained. Cain contemplated an image that appeared to him killing his brother. He imitates the act of murder and then learns from the image a lesson in burial34. The structures of the cosmos parallel the earthly existence of the NusayrI gnostics. The seven planets active in the seven heavens have affinity to the bodies 31 Literally: the navel. 32 The text reads here surrataha. 33 Kitab al-usus , 28b, lines 8-13. 34 Ibid., 29a, line 7 - 29b, line 2. The author does not say here that this image was also created by God. It may have been created by creatures opposed to God, such as Satan or Iblls ( Kitäb al-usüs, 53b). A somewhat similar motif regarding the burial of Abel is expressed in Midrashic and early Mu- slim sources. In Midrashic sources Adam or Cain learn how to bury Abel from a raven burying its dead rival. See e.g. Pirkê de Rabbi Eliézer (The Chapters of Rabbi Eliézer the Great), translated and an- notated with an introduction and notes by G. Friedlander (New York, 1965), chap. 21, p. 156; and see also Quran: 5 / ( al-maida ) 31. Cf. A. GEIGER, Judaism and Islam , translated by F.M.Young (Madras, 1898), 80-81.</page><page sequence="7">[7] The Theology of Kit ab al-usus 61 of the NusayrI believers. The cosmos is divided into seven gnostic heavenly veils (. sab' hujub li l-ma'rifa ), which are parallel to seven earthly veils35. The days of the years - 366 (!) in number - are additional veils divided into the luminary and the earthly36. The luminary veils exist in heaven and belong to the veil of the Son and the Spirit ( hijãb al-ibn wa al-rüh)01 . In the time division of the day the twelve hours also play a symbolic role. They constitute spiritual stations38 where the be- lievers uphold the exemplary models of the twelve Imams of the Shîa39. In this symbolic imagery the Messiah (Christ) is depicted as the «supreme eye» ( al-masïh al-'ayn al-ala) who assembles the Imams - symbolized by the twelve hours of the day - in the figure of the twelve apostles who are «houses» and veils ( hijãbs ) of flesh and blood ( ithnay ' ashara hijãb al-lahmiyya al-damawiyya)40 . This symbolism exemplifies the syncretistic nature of NusayrI theology; in this case the fusion of Christian and Twelver Shîl elements. The Mystery of Divinity. As in other NusayrI works, the mystery of divinity occupies a major place in Kitãb al-usüs. Many of the disciple's queries to his master concern various aspects of the internal dynamics of the godhead. The dialectical tension between two op- posed concepts of God, characteristic of NusayrI discourse - namely, between a transcendental concept of the deity and an immanent one - is also attested in this work. However, the trinitarian concept of the present work is somewhat peculiar. In other NusayrI works the prevalent view is that the ma'na (the supreme aspect of the deity) and the ism (the second aspect) constitute two persons of the trinity. These two persons are sometimes conceived of as identical with God and someti- mes as emanations of the supreme deity. The author of Kitäb al-usüs , however, depicts God as himself being both the ism and the manã, as one person41. There 35 Kitab al-usus , 62a, lines 7-9. 36 Ibid., 62b., lines 1-5. 37 It seems that the author has in mind here two different veils - namely, those of the ism and the bãb - the second and third persons of the NusayrI trinity - applying to them Christian trinitarian ter- minology, which is not infrequent in NusayrI theological parlance. On the NusayrI trinitarian doctrine, see e.g. Lyde, The Asian Mystery, 118-132; R. Dussaud, Histoire et Religion des Nosairís (Paris, 1900), 46-72; and MOOSA, Extremist Shiites, 342-351. See also Bar-Asher and Kofsky, «Ñusayrl Doctrine», 283-288. 38 Literally: houses ( buyut ). See Kitab al-usus , 63a, line 4. 39 The concept of twelve or alternately eleven Imams constitutes a central pillar of NusayrI doc- trine and, along with other components, attests to the strong affinity of the Nusayriyya to Twelver Shl'ism. For a discussion of the role of the Imams in NusayrI religion see Bar-Asher and KOFSKY, «NusayrI Doctrine», 280-283. 40 Kitab al-usus , 63 a, lines 2-4. 41 This concept is reminiscent of the Sabelian and Patripassian doctrines in early Christianity, which maintained that the Father and the Son are one person. See e.g. Tertullian, Adversus Praxean, ed. A. Kroymann, Corpus Scriptorum Ecclesiasticorum Latinorum (= CSEL), 47 (1906), 227-289, chap.</page><page sequence="8">62 M.M. Bar-Asher and A. Kofsky [8] is nonetheless a distinction within the supreme aspect of the deity where God is identified with the mana, while his ism is identified with 'Ali - the supreme ism «who is beyond any other ism and prevalent over every ism» ( ismuhu ' Ali alladhi 'ala42 faivqa kulli ism wa qahara kulli ism)43. To avoid any misunderstanding about the power of these and other interme- diary entities (light, the holy spirit, angels, prophets) the author emphasizes that they are all dependent upon God. «Prophets, peace be upon them, are below God and so are angels; all these perform acts only by permission of God. They are not the actors; act is rather performed through God's power, His order and His permission» (wa dhãlika anna l-anbiya (alayhim al-salämu düna llãh wa kadhãlika l-malaika dünahu wa likulli hãdhihi a fai bi idhni llãh wa lay sa hum al-fä'ilüna in- namã al-fi'lu hi qudratihi wa amrihi)44. The author further supports this idea by a statement ascribed to Jesus: «Have you not heard the saying of Christ, peace be upon him, 'I create through God's permission and act through God's permis- sion'...»45 The author clarifies that God's revelation to his creatures does not harm them, nor does his revelation to them harm God ( Ian yadurra l-makhlüqa l-khãliqu idhã nazzala bihi qudratahu wa lan yadurra al-khãliqa nuzüluhu bi l-makhlüqi)4G . Furthermore, in order to moderate his transcendental theology the author develops a docetic concept. Despite God's transcendence he may, out of conde- scendence towards those of his creatures who failed to perceive his true essence, reveal himself to them in human form, and allow them to describe him in anthro- pomorphic terms47. This condescenscion is a logical implication of the act of crea- tion, when a relationship {nisba) between God and his creatures became manda- tory. The author's striking interpretation of the Qur'anic words (42 Yal-shüraM 11) «like him there is naught» (lay sa ka mithlihi shay') is essential for understanding the relationship between the deity and the creatures. In his opinion this Qur'anic description of God undoubtedly depicts his essence before creation, when he exi- 1.

HOLL (Leipzig, 1922), 31. 42 The play on the name All - literally meaning supreme - is noteworthy. 1 he tendency to apply this frequent Qur'anic divine attribute to 'All occurs in other NusayrT texts. Thus, for example, «the verse of the Throne» (2[al-baqara]/255), which ends with the words wa huwa al-' alt al-' aztm (He is the supreme and glorious), referring to God, is interpreted as denoting 'All.

At that primordial state «there existed no one to describe him and had you said "like him there is naught {lay sa ka mithlihi shay 'Y' and that he neither had an equal nor a rival, nor that he emerged out of something or entered something nor that he could be described - then you would have meant that he was by himself and did not describe himself to his creatures, for they did not [yet] exist48». Moreover, in that state God neither needed ( lam yahtaj) contact with anybody nor did he have to describe himself to himself or to converse with himself. However, after the creation of human beings, such need on the part of the deity became imperative, and variegated categories of divine attri- butes were introduced in order to express the forms of relationship existing between God and his creatures49. Since it is impossible for any change to take pla- ce in the divine essence {lã yumkinu an yahüla 'an hay' atihi)™ , God created an in- termediary entity of an external human form through which he communicated with his creatures {lã budda an yafala hay' atan mithla jinsi khalqihi hattã yukalli- mahum minha)31. Further on the author elaborates this idea of intermediary forms and speaks of twelve human-like forms {kulluhã 'ala sür at al-insãniyya) through which God reveals himself to his believers52. This series of anthropomorphic forms may allude to the spiritual archetypes of the twelve Imams53. Elsewhere, the forms through which God reveals himself are described as angelic persons appea- ring in various forms {inna llãha azhara nafsahu ashkhãsan innahã ka hay' at al- mala ika suwaran mukhtalifatan)3A . There follows a description of three of these appearances - one of which occurs also in Sulaymän al-Adhänf s al-Baküra al-Su- laymãniyya. God first appeared in the form of an old man55, with hoary head and beard {bi sürat al-shaykh al-abyad al-ras wa l-lihya ), possessed of the qualities of dignity, mercy and reverence {al-waqãr wa l-rahma wa l-hayba)5G.

The mythical primordial state of the deity is a concept appearing already in Kitãb al-haft wa l-azilla (pp. 32-37). 49 Kitab al-usus , 8a, lines 7-11. By referring to creatures the author undoubtedly envisions the spiritual beings of the primordial created luminary world. See e.g. Kitãb al-haft wa l-azilla , 34-35. 50 Kitab al-usus , 35a, line 15. 51 Ibid., line 12. This concept is further elaborated in other NusayrI works, where this external form is termed al-süra al-mar'iyya (the visible form). See e.g. Munãzara, 137b, line 4; «NusayrI Doctri- ne», 271; and see also Kitãb al-majmu in Dussaud, Histoire et Religion des Nosairîs, 176 (in the French translation); 195 (in the Arabie text). 52 Kitab al-usus , 35b, lines 3-4. 53 For the concept of divine archetypes of the Imams see «Nusayri Doctrine», 280-282. 54 Kitab al-usus, 8b, lines 7-8. 55 DUSSAUD ( Histoire et Religion des Nosairîs , 73) suggests that this depiction of God as an old man may attest to Christian influence: The old man reflecting God the Father or perhaps «The An- cient of days» Çatïq yomïn ) of Daniel (7:22). A similar concept and terminology are firmly rooted in la- te medieval Jewish mysticism. See e.g. G.G. SCHOLEM, Kabbalah (Jerusalem, 1974), 141-143 56 Kitãb al-usüs, 8b, line 9; and cf. E.E.

Kofsky [10] pearance God revealed himself to them in the shape of a young man with curled moustache {ka hayat al-shãbb al-maftül al-sibãt) , riding upon a lion having the quality of wrath57. Then follows the third appearance, when God reveals Himself in the form of a child (ft sürat al-sabï al-saghïr)3S. According to Sulaymãn al- Adhanl this triple appearance is interpreted by the Kalãzl NusayrI sub-sect as re- ferring to the three stages of divine lunar manifestation in the cycle of waning and waxing59. The dogma of the incarnation and its varied interpretations in NusayrI theo- logical discourse creates peculiar complexities for any discussion of the topic of the relationship between God and humans60. The author of Kitãb al-usüs, deals with this issue in various places without achieving a systematic presentation. A question by the disciple regarding the essence of the deity sets the framework for the author's dialectical approach - namely, what is the essence of the deity? In particular, does the divinity ontologically constitute a part of the created order, or is it totally separate from it? In reply the master rejects both options. The divinity cannot be associated with the created beings, since this would constitute a simila- rity between them. On the other hand, an ontological separation would create an unbridgeable opposition between the deity and the created order61. The author employs a series of detailed similes, using the sun and its relation- ship to the world to illustrate the way God exerts his influence on his creatures62. For example, the sun, though high in the sky, illuminates all objects in the world; in the same way God affects his creatures though he is ontologically separated from them. Another way the author illustrates the nature of the relationship between the deity and the creatures is by analogy with the relations that existed between Jesus and the Jews. This analogy is presented through a peculiar and original interpreta- tion of certain Qur'anic verses relating to Jesus or understood as referring to him. Verse 31[al-saffãt] /158 «and they [i.e. the polytheists] have set up a kinship between him and the jinn» {toa ja'alü baynahu wa bayna al-jinnati nasaban) is in- 57 Ibid., 8b, lines 9-10; and cfr.

In a poem ascribed to Muhammad b. Kalãzu, the eponym of the NusayrI Kalãzi sub-sect (Kitãb al-baküra al-sulaymãniyya , 63), this triple appearance of the deity is referred to by the initials hbq , signifying - according to al-Adhanl's interpretation - the three states of the moon: hilãl (cre- scent), badr (full moon) and qamar (the moon in its waning, which at times is termed mahãq). The ver- se from Ibn Kalazu's poem reads as follows: «I supplicate you, o hbq , by an essence which you have re- vealed, that you may manifest it as a kind among creatures», ( saaltuka , y a hbq , bi dhãtin azhartahã li- tujidahã ka jinsin bayna l-bariyya ). In our reading we substitute litujidahã for the seemingly erroneous printed text, which has linujidahã. 60 For opposing concepts of the incarnation among early Nusayri circles, see, «Nusayri Doctri- ne», 266-283. 61 Kitab at-ususy 4b, line 8-5a, line 8. 62 Ibid., 5a-b.</page><page sequence="11">[11] The Theology of Kit ab al-usus 65 terpreted as referring to the kinship ( nasab ) that existed between Jesus and his people. Relying upon the literal meaning of the root jnn (to conceal), the author suggests that the word « jinna in this [particular] occurrence means [a place] among them where God concealed himself; ...Mary thus being a place where God concealed himself» {wa taf sir al-jinna fi hãdhã l-mawdť mã istajanna llãhu fihim.. fa Maryam bi mawďin istajanna llãhu fihi )63. The second clause of the verse in question, «and the jinn know that they shall be brought forth» {wa laqad ' alimat al-jinnatu annahum lamuhdarün ), is explained as teaching the concept of incarna- tion. The participle muhdarün (those brought forth) is taken to refer to the en- trance of the divine aspect of Jesus into his human aspect through the essence of Mary ( dukhül al-lähüt ft l-näsüt fï l-maryamiyya)M . Further on the author depicts Mary as a veil by which God conceals himself [to avoid] the suffering of birth {iva Maryam hijãb ihtajaba llãhu bihã (an ta'dhib al-wilãda)65 . As do various heterodox Shîï writings, including other NusayrI works, our author draws an analogy between the figure of Jesus and that of 'All for the sake of demonstrating the logic of All's incarnation66. This is done through an interpre- tation of the well-known «verse of the covenant» {l'_al-a'rãf'/'12)G1 . In ShTl wri- tings this verse is interpreted as referring to a primordial covenant God made with his creatures. NusayrI authors took it to refer to a covenant God made with his chosen, the NusayrI believers, prior to their fall, to the terrestrial world of creation when they were spiritual luminary beings surrounding his Throne68. In our text as well this covenant is recorded. However here God reveals himself through the figure of 'All, who is referred to by Qur'anic verses relating to Jesus: [Prophets] prophesied ... that God will reveal himself and be manifested. Then came 'All [i.e. his incarnation] and revealed his spirit in the shape of [a man] born of a virgin «who guarded her virginity so we breathed into her of our Spirit, and she confirmed the words of her Lord, the 'Ayn, and his books, and became one of the obedient» (Q. 66 [al-tahrimV 12) through the 63 Ibid., 54b, lines 1-2. 64 Ibid., 54b, line 6. The term maryamiyya, rendered here as «the essence of Mary», is typical of the prevalent tendency in NusayrI writings to create abstract nouns from names and terms denoting aspects of the divine realm -- e.g. ma'nawiyya , ismiyya, bãbiyya, yatïmiyya. 65 Ibid. 55 a, line 1. Similarly, Moses is described as an abode in which God resides (Musa kana bay tan min buyüt llãhi yanzilu llãhu bihã) {Ibid., 56a, line 5). 66 See «Nusayri Doctrine», 272-273 with note 85. 67 This verse reads as follows: «And when your Lord took from the children of Adam, from their loins, their seed, and made them testify, touching themselves, Am I not your Lord?» (wa idh akhadha rabbuka min bant Adam min zuhürihim dhurriyyatahum wa ashhadahum 'alã anfusihim alastu bi rab- bikum; qälü bal shahidnã). 68 On this primordial covenant see e.g. Kitãb al-haft wa l-azilla 32-35; and see also Kitãb al- bäküra al-sulaymãniyya, 59-61.

GRÄMLICH, «Der Urvertrag in der Koranauslegung (zu Sura 7,172-173)», Der Islam , 60 (1983), 205-230, which discusses this verse in de- tail and also devotes some space to early Imam! exegesis.

It is noteworthy that the author introduces two substantial modifications in the understanding of this Qur'anic verse. First, the verse - originally referring to the birth of Jesus from the Holy Spirit and Mary - is interpreted as being the in- carnation of the first person of the divine trinity - namely 'All. Second, in order to supply a decisive textual proof for his understanding, the author goes so far as to interpolate the word (ayn , a common reference to 'All - into the Qur'anic verse, thereby inserting an implied equation between God and 'All. Elsewhere the presence of God among his creatures is more explicitly depic- ted. After completing the creation, God walks among his creatures in human form. He rules them by setting an example for all to follow70. He does not, howe- ver, communicate with them directly but only via the prophets and apostles71. The author is careful to avoid an unequivocal statement of divine incarnation doctrine by preferring instead a somewhat vague description of the form of the divine pre- sence. However, it seems that he is opting for a type of docetic concept. In its ma- nifestation on earth the deity reveals to its creatures only its powers and attributes - or, in a different terminology, its veil ( hijãb ) - and not itself72. Moreover, the di- vine presence is revealed to humans selectively - namely, to the elect ( khãss ) and not to the multitudes (' amm )73. What differentiates the two categories and enables the elect to perceive the divine manifestation is the power of perception and di- scernment, which prepares the gnostic for the revelation of God within his soul74. The docetic tendencies of the author become further apparent where he adopts an extreme form of docetism - that is, God indeed revealed himself in a form si- milar to that of his creatures, namely, in a human form75. However, even if they once behold the manifestation of his ability, they need not witness it a second ti- me76 (idh[ã' arãhum qudratahu marratan wãhidatan jazãhum an lã yuriyahum thãniyatan)11 . According to this concept the divine presence is limited to single 69 Kit ab al-usus, 69a, lines 1-5. For usage elsewhere of Qur'anic verses in support of the doctrine of incarnation, see Kitãb al-usayfir , 29b. 70 Cfr.

In view of his concept of divine revelation, albeit in a docetic version, the author seems extremely cautious about reiterating the essential and fundamental differences between God and humans, and he does so through a series of exam- ples and similes designed to preclude any misunderstanding of this doctrine. He devotes a laborious philosophical discussion to human anatomy and to the func- tioning of the body through its sensory system, as well as to the common material essence of all creatures, with the manifest purpose of establishing the clear di- stinction between creator and creature79. This general distinction is further elabo- rated through the categories of substance ( jawhar ) and image {math at). The di- stinction here is that while the created substance has an image this is not true of the preeternai substance - that is, the deity ( al-farq baynahumã anna al-jawahra al- makhlüqa lahu mathal wa l-jawhar al-qadlm lã mathala lahu)m. The author lists va- rious additional differences in this vein. The relationship between God and huma- nity is likened to that of body and soul, so that the separation between divinity and humanity is conceived of as the separation of the soul from the body by death81. In yet another simile God is likened to the sun, which nourishes the uni- verse, and humanity to the vegetation growing on earth. The manifestation of the deity is like a life-breathing wind82. At a certain point the disciple raises the two cardinal questions: what does God want from humanity? and what does humanity expect of God? ( akhbirnl mã yurtdu llãhu min khalqihi wa mã yurldu l-khalq min allãh )?83 The master's answer epitomizes the ultimate NusayrI gnostic maxim: The main purpose of human exi- stence is knowledge of God in his rule and speech and his manifestations in his precosmic, cosmic and postcosmic existence {yurtdu llãhu min kalqihi an y a rif ü hukmahu iva kalãmahu wa zuhürahu min awwal al-khalq ilã ãkhirihi wa kawnahu qabla l-khalq wa kawnahu bada l-khalq wa kawnahu ma' a 1-khalqY 4. The author further emphasizes that a clear distinction exists between the pursuit of divine gnosis and the worship of God out of fear. Serving God out of fear is conceived of as a form of polytheism. The author applies the familiar concept of «activities of the limbs» {amãl bi 1-jawãrihY 5 - that is, the external form of religion - to cha- 78 Kit ab al-usus may be the source for a further development of this peculiar concept in Mun aza- rai al-shaykh al-Nashshãbt.

Kofsky [14] racterize religious law. Religious laws follow faith but do not constitute faith. Reli- gious law is defined as the faith of the body, exemplified most amply by Judaism, which represents, according to the author, a typical example of an external form of religion86. Angelology. Angelology occupies a greater place in Kitäb al-usüs than in any other NusayrI works known to us. Some aspects of this angelology are classic and have their roots in the Qu'an and in post-Qur'ânic sources. Other components, howe- ver, seem to be the product of original developments that took place within NusayrI theology. The author's familiarity with the Muslim orthodox doctrines of angelology emerges clearly from his presentation of the subject. However, a su- perficial examination of the text is sufficient to realize that the general Muslim components provide no more than an external framework into which NusayrI theologians inserted their own peculiar concepts. As in Muslim tradition, at the head of all angels stand the four archangels: Gibrll, Isrãfll, malak al-mawt («angel of death» usually known as Tzrâ'ïl) and Mikâ'll87. A great similarity between Mu- slim and NusayrI sources exists also in the eschatological role played by the ar- changel Isrãfll: on the day of resurrection he is the one who will blow the trumpet (; yanfakhu fi l- sür) heralding the resurrection and he himself will resurrect the dead88. On the other hand, Mikâ'll plays a role in Kitäb al-usüs that in Muslim tra- dition is assigned to Gabriel. Mikâ'll is described as «the master of the "preserved tablet"» ( sahib al-lawh al-mahfüz). He is further depicted as God's veil (fa yahtajibu llãhu biht)m' consequently he is the sole angel entrusted to reveal to other angels the secrets concealed in this tablet (fa yakünu huwa alladht yu add! tilka al-ghuyüba ; lã yuaddïha ghayruhu)90 . However, elsewhere the author expres- ses the more common view that angels in general function as God's veils (. hujub )91. Furthermore, as in Ismâ'lll doctrine, angels are depicted in various forms whose common denominator is their being emanated entities mediating between the deity and the human world. They serve inter alia as tools through VI (Studies in Hebrew and Arabic) (Tel Aviv, 1988), 179-208. 86 Kit ab al-usus , lines 13-15. Other references to Judaism in Kit ab al-usus are treated later. 87 Ibid, j 68b, lines 5-6. For the main features of Muslim angelology and the roles of these four an- gels, see e.g. ZAKARIYÃ' b. Muhammad b. Mahmud AL-QazwInT, 'Ajaib al-makhiãqãt wa gharaib al- mawjüdät, edited by F. Wüstenfeld (Göttingen, 1848), 56-59 (= al-Qazwînî). See also D.B. MACDO- NALD and W. Madelung, «Malä'ika», EI2, 6:216-219. 88 For the various roles of Isrãfll in Muslim eschatology, see al-QazwInl, 56-57; see also A.J. Wensinck, «Isrãfll» in EI2, 4:211. Cfr. however Kitäb al-usüs 24a, line 8 where the power of resurrec- tion is described as the privilege of all angels. 89 Kitab al-usus 24a, line 2. 90 Ibid., lines 2-3. 91 See e.g. ibid ., line 3.</page><page sequence="15">[15] The Theology of Kit ab al-usus 69 which God reveals himself to prophets92. Realizing Goďs presence among his an- gels, prophets are enticed to desire a similar state. When the Lord is incarnated in him (i.e. a prophet) or wishes to reveal him- self in that prophet and that messenger whom God sent to him [i.e. the belie- ver], he changes his form into another form. Then, if he so desires, he tran- sfoms himself into another shape until he (i.e. the prophet) recognizes that this angel93 is the house of God in which he lodged his power so that the prophet and messenger crave that [God] should single them out, as he sin- gled out that angel by dwelling in him (wa idhã ¡palla al-rabbu fthi aw arada an yazhara bi dhãlika al-nabJ wa dhälika l-rasül alladhì arsalahu llãhu ilayhi fa y ugh ay y iru9* süratahu ilã süratin ukhra thumma yaruddu süratahu ilã hayatin idhã sha a hatta y a rifa anna dhãlika l-malaka huwa bay tu llah alladhì askana fthi qudratahu... liyatmaa dhãlika al-nabl wa dhãlika al-rasül an yakhussahu bi mith li alladhì khassa dhãlika l-malaka min al-suknã fini )95. It emerges then that God's revelation to his angels serves as a model for his prophets. In another passage it is stated that the true believer - that is the gnostic - can also ascend to the degree of angel {wa kadhãlika al-muminu yantaqilu ilã manzilat al-mala ika)9(' Angels also serve as archetypal forms for the creation of Adam97. God crea- ted him - states the author - in the shape of the angels in the primordial world. Finally, unlike all other creatures, angels are believed to be exempt from transmi- gration98. Prophecy. As has been noted, one of the major roles of prophets, according to the theo- logy of Kitãb al-usüs is mediating between the transcendental divine realm and the world of creatures. God reveals himself to his elect believers through the media- tion of prophets and apostles in a complex docetic form of incarnation. After the fall from the divine realm of light God sent prophets to his elect to convey the di- vine truth. Perception of this truth is dependent on a person's level of knowledge. The savants (' ulama ) acknowledge the truth; the ignorant ( juhhãD are perplexed; the skeptics ( shukkãk ) express doubt; and the heretics ( kuffãr ) reject it99. Before 92 Ibid., lines 5-8. 93 This refers to God's appearance in angelic form mentioned above. 94 The text reads here yataghayyaru, which seems less plausible. 95 Kitab al-usus , 23a, lines 8-14. 96 Ibid., 61b, line 11. 97 Ibid., 9a, lines 1-3. 98 Ibid., 60b, lines 6-7. 99 Ibid., 68b, lines 9-11.</page><page sequence="16">70 MM. Bar-Asher and A. Kofsky [16] the time of Moses, states the author, there was as yet no divine book and no mes- senger, and men were guided by reason and by prophets who were granted divine revelations through angels100. But God also conferred his dispensed power by way of emanation from the angels to his prophets and apostles, who receive some of the divine qualities given to the angels101. In his discussion of the descent of the divine power by emanation to messengers and prophets, however, the author soon adopts an outright terminology of incarnation. The various veils ( hujub ) of the deity are manifested via the descent of God's power to the prophets and his incarnation in them102. Elsewhere the author explicitly states that the prophets are incarnations of the deity (fahum al-rabbu idhã zahara fi khalqihi)m. However, the- se statements are qualified by the author's clarification that God reveals himself and communicates with men not directly but in the «form of prophets» ( hi sürat al-anbiya)m . Proof of the divine power of prophets is their knowledge of the hid- den and their capacity to resurrect the dead and transform things in their essence - qualities that belong to God and not to the believers105. The author further sta- tes that it is the duty of the gnostic to recognize God's manifestation in his prophets as well as his manifestation in other personalities106. The author of Kitäb al-usüs presents a cyclical conception of prophecy. Prophets serve as a medium for the cyclical religious progression of human hi- story. As is well known, this motif has a long history, and ramifications that begin with Manicheism107; it was subsequently elaborated by Isma'lll and heterodox groups such as the Druze108 and the Nusayrls109. Like the Isma'lll doctors110, the author of Kitäb al-usüs stresses the role of the prophets sent in various generations in abolishing the prevailing religion and introducing a new one111. In fact the prophets and apostles are assigned by the author a cosmic role - that of maintai- ning the delicate balance of justice in the world. They constitute the «scale of ju- 100 Ibid., 33b, lines 3-9.

Their paramount role in the evolution of human history merits the possibility of the return of prophets to the world and even the resurrection of their companions113. The divine character and role of the prophets makes them a prime target for the forces of evil, who are engaged in a battle for the souls of humanity in this world. These forces - namely, devils, demons ( al-abãlisa wa l-shayãtin ) and here- tics - wish for the death of the prophets. However, the author advocates a moni- stic providential stance to explain the problematic question of the existence of evil, manifested through the slaying of the prophets by the forces of evil. This rea- lity must be regarded as an integral part of the divine scheme. The forces of evil are obedient to the divine will even if this may not outwardly seem so. Their will is actually tuned to the will of God. Therefore it is God who willed the death of the prophets in order to perfect and complete their reward, and in order to confound the evil forces and cause them to doubt the divine character of the prophets114. The author ends with a warning against those who interpret the «books of the prophets» in a selfish manner according to their liking (; yaqra'u ' alayka kutuba l-anbiya lã ya' lamu tawllahã fa yujãdiluka fïha bi shahwatihi wa yuf assiruh ã laka 'ala mahibbatihi; wa uhadhdhiruka dhãlika tahdhïran)115 .

The disciple is further warned against denying the sayings of the prophets, which may be manifested in various ways116. Theodicy and Divine Retribution.

Kofsky [18] seems somewhat less troublesome, since the principal solution of transmigration gives a satisfactory answer to the perennial existential paradox of the suffering of the righteous. The author offers an unsophisticated discourse on some aspects of this subject - such as the suffering of the righteous as against the well-being of the evil doer, the differences in the lifestyles of the believer and the heretic, and the deserts of each in this world and in the hereafter118. The question of the source of evil in this world, however, is not solved by the doctrine of transmigration. The disciple enquires concerning the essence of divine justice, and the sage elaborates his concept of «originai sin», which is reminiscent of its Christian counterpart. Adam's transgression introduced sin into the world, and this brought about the human condition of sin into which we are born. The fallen state of humanity, a product of the original sin, is responsible for all manife- stations of evil and all catastrophes that beset man119. However, it should be emphasized that the whole system of divine retribution does not belong to the di- vine essence. It is actually an external accretion designed to answer for the lower condition of humanity. This principle accounts also for the apparent changes of stance on the part of God - either beneficial or detrimental - regarding certain bi- blical figures. The change in the fate of the people of Ninveh in contrast to Jo- nah's initial prophecy or the delivery of Abraham's son120 from sacrificial death contrary to God's earlier words to Abraham are offered as examples of God's re- tractions of his previous decrees in favour ( rukhas ) of his creatures121. In his treat- ment of the concept of changes in divine stance the author ignores the well- known doctrine of bada - namely changes in divine will or ruling - but his di- scussion is essentially reminiscent of the major tenets of this doctrine122. Transmigration is the main instrument for effecting divine justice and retri- bution. This point is illustrated through a series of questions and answers regar- ding the divine retribution of caliphs, kings and generals.

As is well known the Qur'an, unlike the Bible, does not refer explicitly to the name of the sacrificed son. In early Muslim tradition there existed a debate regarding the sacrificed son. However, at a later period it became una- nimously accepted that the sacrificed son was Ishmael. On this debate see S. Bashear, «Abraham's Sa- crifice of his Son and Related Issues», Der Islam, 67 (1990), 243-277. 121 Kitäb al-usüs, 45a, line 4-46a, line 10. It is noteworthy that the author unconventionally ap- plies the legal term rukhas - commonly denoting religious legal concessions - to his discussion of divi- ne retribution. On the concept of rukhas in Muslim jurisprudence, see M .J. KlSTER, «On Concessions and Conduct: A Study in Early Hadìth», in G.H.A.

However, the author does not exclude the possi- bility of a certain measure of reward already in this life, in the form of longevity. Here again the key to reward is gnosis. The secret of longevity lies in the knowled- ge of the veil of maternity C hijab al-wilada) - namely, the divine emanated power watching over maternity. Knowledge of this secret creates a scale of longevity from the ignorant to the perfectly enlightened124, a rather optimistic notion on the part of the author. Transmigration. The doctrine of transmigration plays a major role in the theodicy of Kitãb al- usüs. Indeed it seems to be something of a favorite topic among NusayrI scholars, possibly reflecting also its underlying existential concern125. Transmigration is a consequence of the fall. It is viewed as the divine punish- ment for the primordial sin of pride and ignorance with regard to the supreme deity by the spiritual human archetypes in the luminary divine world126. The author defines transmigration as changes that God makes in the forms of his crea- tures127. The form of the transmigration is a function of the religious worship rende- red to God by his creatures128. In line with the numerical cosmic symbolism typi- cal of Isma'IlI doctrine, Kitãb al-usüs refers to seven kinds of bodies for each type of transmigration129. Similarly the NusayrI believer has seven bodies into which he is transmigrated in seven cycles {li kulli mumin sab' ãt abdãn wa sab ' wilãdãt)1™ . The author introduces a series of questions and answers regarding the transmigra- tion of souls, which leads to a detailed discussion of transmigration into various animals and their possible kinds of death, as sacrificial animals or otherwise. He discusses the possibility of atonement and the classification of sins determining the different forms of transmigration (e.g. the murder of God's holy men). The 123 Kitab al-usus , 59a-b. 124 Kitab al-usus , 59, line 13 -60a, line 4. 125 See e.g. the detailed discussion of transmigration in Kitab al-sirat , 339-353. 126 See above p. 4 with note 19. 127 A wide range of terms denoting various forms of transmigration is attested in NusayrI texts. Kitãb al-majmu , for example, includes a series of seven different terms ( Kitãb-al-majmu in DUSSAUD, Histoire et Religion des Nosairis, 163-164 [in the French translation]; 183 [in the Arabic text]). Accor- ding to Sulaymãn al-Adhanl these seven terms are interpreted by the Nusayriyya as referring to the se- ven floors of Hell mentioned in the Qur'an (15 '_al-hijrV 44) ( Kitãb al-bäküra al-sulaymãniyya p. 11). For a brief discussion of transmigratory terminology in a broad Islamic context, see Ben-Shammai, «Transmigration of Souls...», 118-124. 128 Kitab al-usus 49a, lines 3-15. 129 Ibid., 61b, line 12-62a, line 10. 130 Ibid., 32b, line 14-15.</page><page sequence="20">74 M. Aí. Bar-Asher and A. Kofsky [20] punishment of Jews, for example, is their transmigration into animals131, whereas for heretics it is transmigration into sacrificial animals132. The author also distin- guishes between transmigration into animals and transmigration into natural ele- ments133. The transmigration into animals and other natural beings is offered as the ex- planation for the religious proscription of Certain foods, since they may embody transmigrated human souls. The author cites a source, which he terms «the Israe- lite Book» ( al-Kitãb al-israïli )134, on this point: «Everything transmigratory is for- ' bidden to eat, for example an egg which has no two distinguished sides135, fish with no scales, hare, pig, monkey, and others» ( inna kulla mamsükh muharram ak- luhu mithlu l-bayda idh lam yakun lahã tarafayn (!) mukhtalifa iva mithlu l-samaka idh lam [yakun] lahã fulüs wa mithlu l-arnab wa l-khinzïr wa l-qird wa ghayru dhãlika )136. While all these animals are proscribed by Jewish dietary laws - and pigs and monkeys are conceived of as transmigratory animals peculiar to Christian and Jews respectively, based on Qur'anic tradition - the reason for the inclusion of certain eggs in this list remains somewhat obscure. Restoration, Gnosis and Antinomianism. The author of Kit ãb al-usüs advocates a gnostic theology of restoration. God granted Adam the possibility to return to his original state in Paradise. This provi- des the theoretical matrix for the possibility of the NusayrI gnostic to achieve the state of Adam in Eden prior to his primordial sin. As we have seen this state was characterized as one of ideal religious freedom - that is, freedom from the burden of religious precepts and ritual obligations. The gnostic is restored to the pristine reality of religious liberty, where he is free from religious commandments and is 131 Ibid., 46a, lines 6-7. The transmigration of Jews into animals and more specifically into monkeys is derived from the Qur'an where a punitive transmigration of the People of the Book into monkeys and pigs is mentioned {2[al-baqara]/65' 5[al-maida'/tä and 7 [al-a'räf]/ 166). This motif is common in other NusayrI sources. See e.g. SuLAYMÃN AL-AdhanÏ, Kitäb al-bäküra al-sulaymãniyya, 81. 132 Kitab al-usus , 51a. 133 Ibid., 53a, line 5. 134 It is not clear whether the title al-Kitãb al-israïli refers to the Bible or some other specific Jewish work, or whether it is merely employed to denote an unspecified Jewish tradition. This term is akin to the title al-Kitãb al-' arabi, frequently applied by the author as a synonym of the Qur'an. For oc- currences of the latter, see e.g. Kitäb al-usüs, 53a, lines 8, 11; 54a, line 1; 54b, lines 4, 12; 55a, lines 2, 7; 55b, line 9. Other, less frequent, titles referring to the Qur'an are al-Kitãb (!) Muhammad {ibid., 53a, line 13) and al-Kitãb al- arabi al-Muhammadt {ibid., 68a, line 14). 135 Cfr. the Talmudic discussion of the characteristics that distinguish clean eggs from unclean ones: «All [eggs] that are arched and rounded, with one end broad and the other end narrow, are clean. Those that are broad at both ends or narrow at both ends are unclean...» ( Hullin , 64a; the Engli- sh translation is that of I. Epstein in The Babylonian Talmud: Seder Kodashim [London, 1950], 29:347). 136 Kitab al-usus 55b, lines 6-8.</page><page sequence="21">[21] The Theology of Kit ab al-usus 75 rewarded for his deeds137. Adam's road back to Paradise is made possible by divi- ne grace ( ukhrija Adam min al-janna iva raja a ilayhã bi l-minna)l™Ě This principle establishes the possibility for the gnostic to reenter the divine realm. The ascent to paradise, however, can be achieved only through the gradual enlightenment via the seven degrees of faith by which believers may progress139. In a remarkable passage the author idealizes Christian priests and monks as paragons of perfect gnosis of the Messiah - namely, Jesus. The apostles represent for him the perfection of the gnostic-monastic ideal: Do you not know that priests and monks, once they had achieved the degree of gnosis, they withdrew from the world, became wanderers140, rejected the world and its vanities in gratitude [towards] God who bestowed his grace upon them, elevated them so that they gained the full gnosis of the Messiah. The Apostles who secluded themselves in cells and monasteries, out of grati- tude and love and not out of fear and avidity, acquired a degree of asceticism unprecedented by other nations {ama 'alimta anna al-qissistna wa l-ruhbãna lamm a bala ghü darajata l-marifa tazahhadü fï l-dunyã iva särü saihïna iva 'jtanabü l-dunyã wa zukhrufahã shukran an ama llãhu 'alayhim wa balagha bihim al-daraja wa ' arafü l-masïha kunha l-marifa hattã balagha min shan al- hawariyyuna [!] alladhïna h abas ü anfusahum fï l-sawãmi wa l-biya( wa balaghü min al-zuhd mablaghan Iam yablughu ahadan [!] min hãdhihi l-milal shukran wa hubban lã khawfan wa lã tam an)x 41 . The author apparently anticipates the antinomian implication of the state of gnosis as he describes it. He has the disciple pose a question as to the legitimacy of an ideal state where the believer is liberated from religious law: «Inform me how is it possible that the believer should be without [religious] duties; that nothing is demanded from him; that he remains in the ranks of the free and nothing is forbidden to him» ( akhbirm kayfa yajüzu an yaküna l-muiminu bilã 'amai wa lã fard wa lã yutãlabu bi shay' in wa yakünu yastamirru fi manzilat al- ahrãr fa lã yuharramu (alayhi shayun)XA2i In a forceful response the master states 13/ Ibid., 50b-51a.

It is noteworthy that the author employs the term bayt al-maqdis denoting the temple or the city of Jerusalem, as representing the true gnostic knowledge of the divine {ibid., 5b, lines 11 ff). 140 In Arabic: saihün. This term reflects the Süfl ideal of siyãha - namely, ascetic wandering. On this concept in the Nusayriyya see e.g. MUHAMMAD AmTn GhãLIB AL-TawTl, Ta'rtkn al-'alawiyyin (Beirut, n.d.), 320, and the treatise tazkiyat al-nafs fï ma'rifat bawãtin al-'ibãdãt al-khams, in As'ad 'Ali, Ma'rifat Allah wa l-Makzün al-Sinjãri (Beirut, 1972), 2, 321.

Kofsky [22] categorically that perfect gnosis {ma' rifa) of all the divine emanations ultimately leads to final liberation143. This statement is further enhanced by the comparison between Moses and Jesus noted above. God revealed himself in the person of Moses and gave him the Torah and various commandments concerning purity and forbidden foods. Later came Jesus, the incarnate deity itself, and released them ( ataqahum ) - namely the Jews - from the bonds and limitations legislated by Moses. Jesus said: «God is in no need of your deeds; if you wish - do, and if you wish - do not do, for you understand the sweetness of freedom» ( inna llãha mustaghnin ' an a'mâlikum ; in shi' tun imalü wa in shi' turn fa lã tamalü idh fahim- tum halãwat al-huriyya)lAA . The Christian allusions here are clear. The comparison between Moses and Jesus is a traditional Christian theme going back to the roots of Christianity145. Here, however, the old Christian motif is grafted onto NusayrI theology in order to legitimize an antinomian stance in the context of Islamic civilization. Heretics and Believers. Like other NusayrI writings, Kitãb al-usüs advocates a theology of predestina- tion regarding the internal division of humanity. The divine economy has preor- dained the division of humanity into three principal categories: scholars (' ulama ), ignorant (juhhãl ), and heretics 0 kuffãr)1 46. The author states unequivocally that the ignorant and heretics cannot exceed the limits of their condition. Moreover, scholars are assigned the degree of free men, the ignorant that of slaves, and here- tics that of slaves of slaves (' abïd al-'abïd), who are reincarnated as sacrificial ani- mals but are in fact inferior to other beasts147. The author further stresses this di- stinction in order to accommodate the NusayrI gnostic myth of origin in the divi- ne realm of light. An ontological buffer distinguishes between the gnostic elect - the free sons of light - and the rest of humanity, who constitute the people of ser- vitude148. Nonetheless, the author tends to qualify his extreme deterministic position somewhat. The principle underlying the divine predestined classification of hu- manity is the degree of gnosis - namely, the progress of the initiate in the scale of 14î Ibid., 55b, line 15 - 56a, line 5. 144 Ibid., 56a, line 14 - 56b, line 2. 145 See e.g. EUSEBIUS of CAESAREA, Demonstratio Evangelica in Die griechischen christlischen Schriftsteller der ersten drei Jahrhunderte , edited by I.A. Heikel (Leipzig, 1913), 2, 3, 6-30. 146 Kit ab al-usus 50b, lines 12-14. 147 Ibid. y 51a, lines 1-8. 148 Ibid., 57 a.</page><page sequence="23">[23] The Theology of Kit ab al-usus 77 knowledge of the divinity149. In accordance with this concept, the author elsewhe- re proclaims the universality of divine truth, which is not limited to any particular religion or location: «Truth fortifies the believer and cannot harm him wherever he is and to whatever religion he belongs» ( wa l-mu minu al-haqqu yaziduhu toa lã yadurruhu ayna mã kãna wa fi ayyi dtnan (!) kãna )150. At the same time, however, it seems that the author counts such a believer among the gnostic predestined elect. The author further states that the internal division among believers and he- retics according to their degree of gnosis is reflected by the elements of nature and the cosmos151. There are seven ranks of faith among believers on the ascen- ding ladder to Paradise, as well as seven terrestrial bodies and seven heavenly lu- minary bodies with their astral affiliation152. These seven ranks are symetrically opposed by seven descending degrees of heresy - associated with darkness - lea- ding to absolute heresy ( al-kufr al-mahd)ì5ì. In the scale of heresy the Jews are seen as archetypes of heresy154. After the fall God sends prophets to humanity to disseminate the divine truth denied by the heretics155. The heretics in fact collaborate with the demons to bring about the death of the prophets156. The author ends his book with the sage's teaching to the disciple about how to refute two types of heresy, which are distin- guished by their position regarding the creation of the world and the unity of God. The first type of heretics are believers in the eternity of the world ( ahi al- dahr ), the second are dualists ( ahi al-thanawiyya)151 . The sage winds up his di- scourse on heresy with a general admonition to the disciple against various types of heresy and deceptive talk - both of which intertwine truth with falsehood158. Christian and Jewish issues. Kitäb al-usüs is marked by a considerable preoccupation with Christian and Jewish motifs. In fact, these notions, particularly the Christian, appear at all levels of discussion and throughout the entire treatise. Moreover, it appears that here, more than in any other NusayrI work, Christian theological issues are firmly inte- grated into NusayrI theological parlance. 149 Ibid., 38b, line 15 -3 9a, line 2. 150 Ibid., 58b, lines 3-4. 151 Ibid., 60a. 152 Ibid., 61a-62a. 153 Ibid., 61b, line 9. 154 Ibid., 39b, lines 1-2.

Bar-Asher and A. Kofsky [24] The author associates salient Christian terminology with the divine realm of emanation and with the NusayrI trinitarian doctrine. The third person of the tri- nity is sometimes referred to as the Holy Spirit ( al-rüh al-muqaddasa)159 , which al- so serves as a mediator between divinity and humanity. The various heavenly lu- minary veils ( hujub ) belong to the hijãb of the Son and the Holy Spirit (. hijãb al- ibn wa l-rüh)160. This apparently refers to the hijãb of the second person, the ism, and of the third, the bãb, thus applying the distinctly Christian trinitarian termi- nology to the NusayrI trinity and identifying the Son with the second person of the NusayrI trinity. Christ (Jesus) is further depicted as the «supreme eye», gathe- ring the cosmic divine Imams, who are identified with the twelve hours of the day under the figures of the twelve cosmic apostles161. To support his view on certain points the author occasionally adduces quasi- biblical quotations. The apocryphal saying of Jesus, «I create through God's per- mission...» has already been noted162. Elsewhere he cites Genesis 1:26 - erroneou- sly attributing it to the New Testament: «Let us create man in our form and ima- ge» ( ta'alaw nakhluqu insãnan ' alã süratinä wa amthãlinã)m . It is Jesus who speaks here, wishing to reveal his power in a form similar to his own (fa arada an yuzhira qudratahu fi l-süra aliati hiya (alã süratihi)l(A . In answer to the question, in whom was God revealed after he had concealed himself? the author cites - appa- rently indirectly and possibly from the Gospel (Mat. 1:23) - an interpolated ver- sion of the famous verse of Isaiah 7:14 , «Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a prophet (!)165, and shall call his name Immanuel». The author claims that God revealed Jesus to men and announced to them that he would perform great deeds - deeds that were beyond the powers of the prophets166. Several paragraphs of the book are devoted to discussions of the figure of Christ, the doctrine of incarnation, Jesus' suffering at the hands of the Jews and his death. Parts of these discussions are focused on Qur'änic verses dealing with Christian beliefs concerning the relationship between divinity and humanity as well as the complex relation between the Jews and Christ. The author attributes to the Gospel the verse «O Jesus, I have borne you» (yã Isã, inni waladtuka) . The 159 Ibid., 41 a, line 14. The more common term is rüh al-qudus (see e.g. ibid., 42b, line 7). For another identification of the Holy Spirit with the sun as a degree of emanation below the bãb and abo- ve the moon, see Kitãb al-usayfir , 34a. The bãb is identified in the latter work with the Universal Soul or the Holy Soul {ibid., 24b, lines 8-9). 160 Kit ab al-usus, 62 b, line 7. 161 See above p. 61. See also the author's comparison between Moses and Jesus ror the sake or legitimizing his antinomian theology (above, p. 76), as well as the idealization of apostles, priests and monks as models of perfect knowledge of Christ and the embodiment of the gnostic ideal. 162 See above, p. 62. 163 Kitab al-usus lib, lines 6-7. 164 Ibid., lib, lines 7-8. 165 Instead of «son» as in the biblical text. 166 Kitab al-usus 25b, lines 11-12.</page><page sequence="25">[25] The Theology of Kit ab al-usus 79 author interprets it as referring to Mary - who, according to him, is a divine place where God conceals himself - and to the incarnation of Christ167, which serves as a model for a divine incarnation through the medium of virginity and the Holy Spirit168. The author further comments on the aforementioned Qur'anic verse 31 (al- saffãt)/'5S «and they [i.e. the polytheists] have set up a kinship between Him and the jinn» (wa jaalü baynahu iva bay na al-jinna nasaban). He interprets it as refer- ring to John the Baptist and his father, Zecharia, who created a kinship ( nasab ) between Jesus and the demons. Following this assertion the author concludes further that the Jews erroneously conceived of the divine essence as being identi- cal with the demonic essence169. The Qur'än is thus cited as proof that the de- mons knew they were destined to come to Jesus170. The treatise next discusses Christology - namely, the natures of Jesus and the understanding of his messianic role. Here the author offers - albeit without elabo- ration - a distinction between two aspects of Christ's human nature, his superior, Adamite nature ( adamiyya ) and his lower, human nature (insãniyya)111 . Towards the end of the work the author introduces a series of questions and answers regarding Christ as a model of all figures who were concealed and revea- led in order to proclaim the unity of God. The disciple raises the question whether such a person is to be perceived as elected (by God) or as persecuted (by men) when he was killed but was not dead (bina qutila iva lam yuqtal)112. If one asserts that he was persecuted one must conclude that he was a created being and was executed. However, if he was elected then his murderer must be pardoned -presumably because he acted according to divine will173. The answer states that Christ, the «true truth» ( al-haqq al-haqïq) was persecuted not because he was a created being but because he chose to be persecuted174. The sage concludes his answer with a statement of the paradox of faith: the mysteries of Christ cannot be apprehended by a man of reason but only by the ignorant175. Responding to another question the author proceeds to discuss the revelation of Christ, arguing that his revelation is a sort of test for humanity176. This is fol- 167 Ibid., 54a, line 14-55a, line 2. 168 Ibid., 55, lines 11-14. 169 Ibid., 54a, line 9-54b, line 3. The author states further that the Jews claimed they had cruci- fied Jesus, until God denied their words in the Gospel and in the Qur'än (54b, lines 3-5). 170 Ibid., 54b, lines 5-6. 171 Ibid., 5a, lines 13-15. The Adamite nature seems to reflect the primordial spiritual nature of the human creatures who preceded humanity in the divine realm. 172 Ibid., 72b, line 1. 1/5 A similar deliberation with regard to Ali's murder can be found in heterodox ShTi circles. See e.g. 'Abd AL-QãHIR AL-BaghdãdT, Kitãb al-farq bay na l-firaq, edited by P.

Bar-Asher and A. Kofsky [26] lowed by a discussion of the meaning of the crucifixion and the role of the Jews in Jesus' death177. The author focuses on the issue of the compatibility or incompati- bility of the wills and intentions of the Jews and of Christ. The disciple argues that if the Jews acted according to Christ's wish that he be killed by them, then they have, at least outwardly, obeyed him. If, however, they acted contrary to his exter- nally manifested will, their action may serve as evidence against them. The master answers that Jesus did not wish his death to be an offering to God; therefore the will of the Jews (to kill him) was contrary to Christ's will. It is only when both wil- ls (i.e. of Christ and the Jews) are in harmony that one can speak of obedience (of the Jews to Christ's will). It is actually proper to consider Christ as disobedient because he did not obey the Jews. In fact, Christ did not order them to kill him but actually forbade it. But since the Jews were determined to execute him, he ap- peared to them as if he were dead and confounded them in knowledge, ability and will. God exalted Christ, the spirit and word (of God) from every inferior being, and he returned to the divine luminescence and omnipotent glory (wa naz- zaha llâhu l-masïha rühahu wa kalimtahu ( an kulli daniyya wa 'äda ila al-nüräniyya al-ilãhiyya wa l-jalãl al-jabarütiyya)m . Finally, the incarnation of Christ serves as an example that the divinity may be revealed in different forms, and that man should be aware of this. A semi-apo- cryphal saying of Jesus is adduced to substantiate this concept: «If I come to you hungry, feed me, and if I come to you naked, dress me. Namely, if I appear to you in this form, do not deny that I am your Lord for I appear in whatever form I wish», ( idhã jitukum jai' an fa ashbiünt wa idhã jitukum ' uryãnan fa 'ksûnï ay idhã tasawwartu lakum bi hâdhihi al- sûr a fa lã tabaw ; inni rabbukum fa innï qad tasawwartu bihã kayfa shitu)m. Whereas Christian motifs play an important role in Kitäb al-usüs the author refers only sporadically to Jews and often in the context of the death of Jesus. Jews are characterized as the model of arch-heretics180. Following Qur'anic verses 4(al-nis a )/l60' 2(al-baqara)/2ll y the author notes that the Jews were punished with certain restrictions. What is noteworthy here is the explanation for their spe- cific punishment: their sin was that «they denied the incarnation of the deity in prophets and [their] heirs» (inkäruhum hulüla al-lahüt fi l-anbiyã ' wa l- awsiya 181 )182.

Conclusion. The unsystematic and enigmatic nature of Kitãb al-usüs ought not to be viewed as detracting from its significance as a very valuable source for the study of NusayrI doctrine in its formative stages. Alongside concepts and ideas prevalent in other NusayrI works our treatise is marked by ideas and terminolgy not found in - or at least, not developed in - other sources. One of the questions debated by scholars of the NusayrI religion since the beginning of modem research is the weight that should be assigned to the Christian components within the complex NusayrI syncretism. As is well known, certain scholars such as Henri Lammens held the view that Christian influence upon the NusayrI religion - mainly on its trinitarian doctrine and liturgy - has been cardinal. Lammens even went so far as to claim that the roots of NusayrI religion are to be found in Christianity. Although the evidence of Kitãb al-usüs does not support the rather extreme posi- tion of Lammens the treatise certainly demonstrates the great affinity of early NusayrI religion to Christian doctrines and terminology. Moreover, we have seen that this work is also distinguished by other topics, such as its antinomian stance rooted in redemptive gnostic theology as well as a complicated concept of trans- migration, which constitutes an essential pillar of the theodicy of Kitãb al-usüs185.

Other references to Jews in a Christian context were noted earlier - na- mely, the comparison of Moses to Jesus in the context of establishing an antinomian theology, the for- bidden incarnated foods, the claim of the Jews that they crucified Jesus, their mistaking the divine es- sence for a demonic one (p. 79), and the question as to whether they acted in conformity with Christ's will when they persecuted him and plotted his death (p. 80). 184 Kitab al-usus 77b, lines 14-15. 185 We would like to thank Prof. Y.T. Langermann for his critical reading of a draft of this article and for his instructive remarks.</page></plain_text>
