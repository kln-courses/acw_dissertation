<plain_text><page sequence="1">Goïonaôos Hanč) cl Ttûuex By John L. Sinclair Custodian, Coronado State Monument, New Mexico Member Illinois State Archaeological Society With Photographs by George W. Thompson His horse was of the breed becoming1 a warrior. His attire identified him as a Spanish cavalier - those trappings such as the plumed helmet, the gilded breastplate, the crimson cloak, and the sword. His companions, other than the foot sol- diers and Indian guides, were gentlemen of rank ; among them were men in gray cassocks who each in his hand carried a. Cross. The day was September 7, 1540. The scene was the desert flats stretching westward of the Rio Grande about 20 miles north of the present city of Albuquerque, New Mexico - the then vast unknown country that 370 years later was to become one of the United States of America. The armored man who led his company to the scene was Hernando de Alvarado, captain-adju- tant to the great explorer, military general and would-be conqueror Francisco Vasquez Coronado, who had set out on a,n expedition in quest of wealth and new possessions on behalf of Charles V, the Catholic Majesty of Spain. Now the gentlemen sat easily in their saddles and the foot soldiers rested upon their lances as they gazed at a new prize that had come to them in the course of adventure: the four-storied Pueblo Indian village of Tiguex (pronounced Tee-wesh) ; which, to their hopes, might contain within its high-piled adobe walls that balm dear to the heart of every 16th century Spanish gentleman - Gold! They gazed and wondered; anxiety to acquire what wealth the town should deliver to their hands gripped them then in 1540 - just as four centuries later, in 1934, a group of Archaeolo- gists stood on the Mound that covered the ruins of ancient Tiguex to wonder with equal anxiety as to what priceless treasures of antiquity lay under their feet. For ten days the small band under the com- mand of Alvarado had trekked northeastward from the pueblo of Hawikuh, one of the "Seven Cities of Cibola," now in ruins on the Zuni Indian reservation in western New Mexico; that village of mud and rock which Coronado had conquered but, much to his chagrin, failed to deliver the hoped-for wealth, the treasure that would natu- rally be found in a city reported by an Indian of Mexico who had gone there on previous occasions to trade parrot feathers as one "paved with gold and doors studded with turquoise." But that ten-day march was only a fraction of the journey they had taken, for in February of that year they had set out from Compostela in southern Mexico fired with endeavor to ex- plore the unknown country to the north. Coro- nado's army penetrated the wilds of what is now the Mexican state of Sonora, crossed the present boundary of the republics into Arizona, marched eastward into New Mexico, and took Hawikuh, which was the first town they encountered on the way. Discovery of Grand Canyon. There Coronado rested his army, sent his lieu- tenant, Pedro de Tovar, to investigate villages reported in the northwest, which were those of the Moqui (Hopi) Indians; and while there, he found a great river that dashed through a deep canyon, which he named the Firebrand River - because the color of its water was the most vio- lent red - and distinguished himself as the first White man to look upon the Grand Canyon of the Colorado. In Hawikuh the Spaniards were told of a town to the east of another great river, a village called by the Indians Cicuye, and that beyond there great herds of "cows" roamed vast plains - the "cows" known to you and me as the buffalo. This report intrigued the Spaniards. Alvarado was honored with the task of investigation. On the way he met the village of Tiquex beside the Rio Grande. Smoke curled upward from the plazas of the town. From the rooftops the Indians watched the newcomers and marveled at the strange beasts they were riding and used as carriers of burden, for until Coronado brought them north from Mexico horses were unknown to the natives of the land that was to become the United States. The vision of accumulated treasure haunted the cavaliers ; their patience could hold them no long- er. They advanced upon the town. Then the transition of Archaeology into History took place for the benefit of 20th century scientists. At Tiguex, Alvarado made ready winter head- quarters for his superior, from whence expedi- tions were sent as far north as the Kansas-Ne- 35</page><page sequence="2">braska line - again in search for reported gold, there only to find the grass huts and crude imple- ments of the half -naked Wichita Indians. Although Imperial Spain declared the Coronado Experition a failure - for want of the golden booty it failed to bring back to Mexico City - and heaped annoyances on the man who suffered to lead it, such as the penalties of fines, exile from the capital and political disgrace, the venture nevertheless was the most important ever under- taken in the American West Then much of the guesswork of the Archaeology concerning the southwestern Indians wa,s given over to a writ- ten History of the region in which they lived. Coronado - Important Explorer. Coronado was the first White man to explore and blaze a trail for further expeditions through the Southwestern regions of the United States, which have become vast grazing areas, fertile agricultural valleys, bonanza mining camps and super-provident oil fields. In fact, he was the first European with a,n eye on the future to look upon what is now the states of Arizona, New Mexico, Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas - barely missing Nebraska by a few miles. With his entrada, the pre-Columbian age ceased to exist, and by the noble effort of one of his common foot soldiers, the first American history was written. At that time the settlement of Culiacan, in Sinaloa, was the Spanish outpost of civilization and all the country to the north of it was un- known. Sonora and Chihuahua were peopled by hostile savages who understood thoroughly their own difficult terrain, and to the thin-blooded Spaniards' way of thinking, the soil which was destined to become the United States was too close to the North Pole to be of much worth even should they acquire it. The only good they had heard was that it contained seven cities that flourished in splendor and wealth, and that the population could be easily overcome and tortured into giving up the treasure with little effort. Eureka ! There lay booty even greater perhaps than that which they had taken from Montezuma! And such a, knowledge would fire with ambi- tion any Spanish gentleman into doing something gracious for his king and country! So history can be grateful to one of the foot soldiers stationed at the Culiacan garrison, one chosen by Coronado to accompany him on the expedition; and for the fa,ct that although he was not a gentleman he was gifted with literary talent. Pedro de Castañeda, born in Najero in Spain's northern province of Biscaya, was to be survived by eight children. A day by day narra- tive of the Coronado Expedition was written by his own hand in Spain many years after his re- turn from the venture. The Spanish document is preserved in the Lenox Library, which is now part of the New York Public Library. In 1896 it was printed in the 14th Annual Report of the Bureau of American Ethnology, translated by George Parker Winship. The Seven Cities of Cibola. Castaneda's narrative tells posterity that on February 23, 1540, Francisco Vasquez Coronado led 250 horsemen, 75 foot soldiers, with priests and friars, Indian servants and guides, sheep, cattle and swine, northward in search of the seven cities accounted for by certain Indians who had gone there to trade; by Cabeza de Vaca, who had passed them on his way to Mexico City* after spending ten years with the Indians in Texas following an ill-fated attempt to explore Florida with Pamfilo de Narvaez in 1528; and by a priest named Marcos de Niza who had gone there to explore the year previous on orders of the vice- roy and who had hastily retreated to Mexico when it dawned upon him that he was not wel- come at any Pueblo Indian's doorstep. All those adventurers reported "The Seven Cities of Ci- bola" to be fabulously rich. With the aid of crossbows and harquebuses, not to mention the horses that put the fear of God into the Indians, Coronado took and made quarters of the Zuni, Hopi and other Pueblo towns, discovered the Colorado River and the Rio Grande, explored the coast along the Gulf of Cali- fornia, and saw with White man's eyes for the first time the buffalo of the plains and the Vaq- uero Apaches who subsisted on them. Coronado exhibited greed and cruelty becoming the Spanish grandee. He injected hatred for the White Race in the Red in doses potent enough to last for cen- turies. He was1 the first of European stock to ex- plore Kansas. Two* years after the beginning of the adventure he returned to Mexico disgusted with North Amercia, with the opinion that it was not fit for habitation by the civilized human being. The climate was bleak, he decided. The natives knew nothing of the golden commodity as had the Aztecs of Mexico and the Incas of Peru. Exploration of Kansas. The explorer named the country Quivira, now called Kansas, and sent a report written to the King in Madrid, from Tiguex on October 20, 1541, and erranded by a certain Lopez de Cardenas, which hinted that the country had agricultural possibilities. "The province of Quivira is 950 leagues from Mexico," wrote Coronado. "Where I reached it, 36</page><page sequence="3">it is in the 40th degree. The country itself is the best I have ever seen for producing all the products of Spain, for besides the land being very flat and black and very well watered by the rivu- lets and springs and rivers, I found prunes Lke those of Spain (or I found everything they have in Spain) and nuts and very good sweet grapes and mulberries." The report was lengthy and comprised many words concerning the promise to kiss the royal hands and feet, come the future, and how Lopez de Cardenas who would deliver the report would do a considerable amount of the same when he reached the majestic presence, besides wishing "the Holy Imperial Catholic person of Your Maj- esty with increase of greater kingdoms and pow- ers, as your loyal vassals desire." Flowery well- wishing and writing of the desire to do physical homage may have been customary in those days when communicating with the monarch, but Coronado's message was inclined to reveal the writer's suspicions that on his return to Mexico City he would most surely find himself in diffi- culties. The Spaniards, according to Castañeda, found the Indians friendly at first; but grandees being what they were, and conquering soldiers having then as today certain characteristics bred of battle and bloodshed, isolation from the home fires, hearty appetites pertaining to both stom- ach and glands, killed that friendship as readily as they would a life. In the Indian towns they found no streets paved with gold or doors stud- ded with turquoise as they had expected, and such a dash of extravagant hopes was enough to anger a serious plunderer. Coronado's army became peevish and difficult to handle. Gold - A Dream Which Failed. Rocky Mountain history has proven that the southwestern United States is rich with mineral ore under the crust of its earth; but the adven- turers of 1540 gave no thought of getting it by means of pick and shovel, but interested them- selves only in gold already beaten by human 37</page><page sequence="4">hands, fashioned into paving bricks, platters, cups and various ornaments of colossal size, and con- veniently packed in chests ready to transport to the viceroy's coffers in Mexico City. The blasted dreams raised disappointment in the minds of cavaliers and foot soldiers alike - not to mention the clergy - for they were all built of the same human flesh. However, the Pueblo Indians were then farmers as they are today, and they had stores of food in their bins - and the slogan goes that an army travels on its stomach; they knew how to cultivate cotton and weave the lint - and the 5,000-foot altitude of New Mexico's Rio Grande Valley gets cold in winter; and much of the Indian population was female - and the conquerors followed their nat- ural bents. Castañeda describes Tiguex as a province con- taining 12 villages, some beside the Rio Grande while others were found in the foothills of the Sandia, mountains that range east of the river. The; southernmost of these towns, the inhabi- tant! spéakmg the Tiqua language in contrast to neighboring groups using other tongues, was is- leta, 13 miles south of INew Mexico s present-day metropolis of Albuquerque ; while the northern- most vfas somewhere m the vicinity of Algodones, a Spanish-American settlement 23 miles north of the city. Archaeologists differ in their opinions as to which of the 12 towns was the actual pueblo of Tiguex Coronado visited, but it could have been one known today by Indians of Sandia, a Tiguex-speaking group, as Kuaua, near Berna- lillo» New Mexico, now in ruins. Out of the 12 only two remain inhabited, the pueblos of Isleta and Sandia, the latter about 12 miles north of Albuquerque. A Complex Civilization. Tiguex, as Casteneda described it, was built of adobe, or sun-dried mud blocks, four stories high - ^the building laid around two "courtyards" or plazas. The women attended to the construction of the houses which became their property, and if a man should repudiate his wife he was ban- ished. The men attended to government, reli- gion, farming and the hunt; and they spun and wove and gave the women staples of the field such as corn, beans, squash, for the cooking of food. They provided them with venison and wild turkey taken with bow and arrow or hunt- ing club. . He told how the men wore little shirts of tan- ned deerskin with more generous outer robes, and how the young women went about entirely naked until they were married. He describes them as making pottery "glazed with antimony and jars of extraordinary labor and workman- ship, which were worth seeing." He let the world know that there were dead men who did not stink ; the people did not commit nuisances about the village; the women were virtuous and the men fine of character. "Sodomy is not found among them," he was happy to report. Conflict with a strange land and people helped while away time for the Spaniards at Tiguex. There was the trek to Quivira, of course, and the trip to Taos necessary on the itinerary of every tourist to New Mexico. There were the baptisms of Indians staged by the clergy and a garroting now and then performed on certain wayward tribesmen by the military. Then there was that winter of 1540-41 - which was cold and found the soldiers insufficiently clad, and the larder depleted. To put matters right for the welfare of the Spaniards, Coronado commanded the people of Tiguex to hand over their supplies of food, while each soldier took sadistic pleasure in partially disrobing any Indian he by chance should meet, to the advantage of his own bodily warmth. Tribe members shivered in their nudity and caloric in- take decreased in Indian bodies. Then the people became particularly irritated when a cavalier^ described by Castañeda as "one whom I will not name, out of regard for him," rode up to a house, commanded the Indian to hold his horse by the bridle for the while it took enter the abode and rape his wife. Indians Seek Revenge. The chieftains decided that in retaliation for such a breach of etiquette the Spaniards' horses should be killed, and shields and war-clubs taken to hand; so Lopez de Cardenas, shortly after, was irked, "when he found the village closed by palisades and a great noise inside, the horses be- ing chased as in a bull fight and shot with ar- rows." A battle ensued which resulted in the surrender of the Indians. Coronado gave orders that no man of Tiguex was to be harmed. Peace at the cost of pride was to reign in the province. But Don Garcia Lopez de Cardenas blundered, as officers of the military are apt to do, when he ordered 200 stakes to be driven into the well- trodden dirt of the plaza and have just as many Indians bound to them and roasted alive as an example of the might of the Spaniards. When the unsuspecting people watched the victims be- gin to sear in the flames, and in time sizzle to a crisp, confusion arose among them; then they made a stampede for the open desert. Coronado's men followed them on horseback and mowed them down with sword and lance. Cardenas might have rustled his lace and garters, bit his fingernails and called himself a fool, but 38</page><page sequence="5">all his regrets did not prevent the surviving war- riors of Tiguex from shooting arrows in his di- rection and that of his fellow trail-blazers of civilization. Harquebuses and crossbows went into action; Tiguex wa,s besieged for 50 days; and, of course, the Spaniards were the victors. A Crippled General Is No General. A year later found both cavalier and foot sol- dier restless and ready to welcome any excuse to get back to the luxuries of Mexico City or at least a , semblance of decent living. They had done enough belt-tightening to last them a life- time. Then - "by the ordination of Almighty God," as Castañeda puts it - Coronado fell from his horse one day while jousting at rings with his good friend Rodrigo Maldonado. His injury was serious, and he was no less worried mentally due to the pa,st predictions of a "scientific friend" in his home town of Salamanca, in Spain, that he would die in a foreign land away from his loving wife and mourning offspring. In spite of Cas- tañeda' s conclusions that dead men did not stink in Tiguex, Coronado had, no desire to die there. A crippled general was as good as no general at all, so the expedition marched to Mexico in the spring of 1542 with Coronado freshly out of splints and ready to face the royal, viceregal and clerical re- pudiations that were to be flung at him. A Weird Painting. Other expeditions visited Tiguex from the time of Coronado's exit in 1542 to the final colonizing of New Mexco by Onate in 1598. The friars, Rod- riguez and Lopez, called in 1581 to offer greet- ings and sprinkle holy water; they proselyted 39</page><page sequence="6">until the Indians were tired of it all to the extent of killing them. Antonio de Espejo was sent out the following year by the viceroy to inquire as to the welfare of the priests, and even before he reached the pueblo he learned the sad news. While at Tiguex (which on the later expeditions was spoken of as Puaray) he and his party were lodged in one of the kivas, or underground cere- monial chambers. There, to their horror, they saw a painting on the wall which depicted the friars receiving the bloody but glorious martyr's death. Onate, in 1598, saw the same painting in the same kiva at Puaray. Since then Archae- ologists and historians have given much thought to the work of art, but decided conclusively that it had long since crumbled with the dust. Those who make a profession of antiquity claim that Tiguex thrived as a town from about 1300 to a period between 1600 and 1680 A. D. During that span of centuries the people farmed and hunted, fought off enemies, and staged elab- orate ceremonies for their own particular gods. In answer to their prayers the Sky Father let loose his rains to fall on the Earth Mother, who conceived and bore crops. The people reared chil- dren and buried their dead. During the period Tiguex was inhabited an in- fant died and was buried under the floor of one of the rooms. For centuries the desert wind howled over the resting place, and the walls of the abandoned town collapsed and covered the grave deeper with its rubble, and the drifting sand piled higher until what was left of the town was itself buried in the earth. Then, on Febru- ary 7, 1938, Albert G. Ely, Archaeologist for the University of New Mexico and at that time super- visor of the excavations at the Kuaua ruins be- side the Rio Grande near Bernalillo, New Mexico, with two N. Y. A. youths to assist him, un- earthed the skeleton of the infant. With the body was found a large Glaze-on-Gray bowl, a smaller bowl and dish. The infant was one of over 600 skeletons taken from the ruin. Tiguex was alive again! The Coronado State Monument. In March, 1935, the Commissioner of Public Lands of the State of New Mexico set aside the tract of land on which the old pueblo was located and it became the Coronado State Monument - "to be preserved for the use and pleasure of the people of the State of New Mexico." Two Tiguex sites were chosen for excavation: Kuaua, and a ruin two miles to the south thought to be and named Puaray by the famed Archae- ologist, Adolph Bandelier. The project was un- der the direction of Dr. Edgar L. Hewett, direc- tor of the Museum of New Mexico, Santa Fe. Pro- fessional excavators, students from the Anthro- pology department of the University, N. Y. A. youths and W. P. A. workers swarmed over the ruins to dig ancient Tiguex from its mother earth. There are three much-used words in the Ar- chaeologist's vocabulary: "probably," "maybe" and "perhaps." Probably Kuaua was the town of the 12 in the Tiguex province Coronado visit- ed; maybe one of the kivas there actually housed Espejo and Onate when they saw the gruesome painting on the wall ; perhaps Bandelier was right when he stated that the ruin two miles below Kuaua was the historic Puaray. But Archaeolo- gists have contested Bandelier's statement and now of the two ruins on the Coronado Monument the smaller is always spoken of as "Bandelier's Puaray." Before work was commenced in 1934 both çuins were mere Mounds on the desert surface, with the rims of walls showing here and there and pottery sherds everywhere. The south portion of Kuaua had been dug into by Charles F. Lum- mis in 1911-12, the work done under the auspices of the School of American Research of the Ar- chaeological Institute of America. Dr. Lummis touched only a corner, otherwise the excavation of the most important ruins on the Rio Grande wa.s yet to begin ; and what lay under the sandy dirt was food for guessing. What did the ruins contain? Material left in the wake of Coronado? Probably. The painted kiva? Maybe. Would conclusive proof come to light that Kuaua or Pua, ray was the Tiguex described by Castañeda ? Perhaps. Detailed Work Begun. Under Dr. Hewett's direction Gordon Vivian was placed in charge of the crew that would take the first shovelfuls of earth from the south ruin - Puaray. Mr. Vivian was an experienced exca- vator and the importance of the project required skill. Marjorie F. Tichy, then instructor in Ar- chaeology at the University and now Curator of Archaeology of the Museum of New Mexico, was assigned to classify all cultural material - such as pottery; and bone, stone and clay artifacts which would include jewelry, fetishes, pipes, needles, awls, scrapers, knives, arrow and spear points. Dorothy Luhrs, now with the Hancock Foundation and the University of Southern Cali- fornia, studied the skeletons as they were taken from their graves. 40</page><page sequence="7">As spade, trowel and brush brought Puaray and Kuaua out of the earth the cultural material, and what was left of once living animal and hu- man beings, were taken to the experts for sort- ing and classifying. Pottery sherds were checked as to the location where they were found, those from the kivas studied for a comparison to those dug from the plazas and refuse dumps. At Puar- ay were found Spanish porcelain, metal tools; goat, sheep and horse bones-- all European left- overs. The task of excavation was tremendous and to the student of antiquity vitally important ; for there beside the Rio Grande 400 years ago Archaeology turned into history - there the transition occurred. Any object, no matter how tiny or seemingly insignificant, might prove to be a link that would tie in with the culture Cas- tañeda wrote about. The Tiguex people, Dr. Luhrs found, as was the custom with all Pueblo people, chose the ground under the floor of their living rooms, as well as the refuse dumps, as suitable for the eternal resting place of their dead. Upon exca- vation the skeletons were found "flexed" - that is, with the legs drawn up in a sitting position and arms bent at the elbows with hands at the shoulders. They were laid on their sides facing the east. The custom was to bury "mortuary offerings" with the deceased, such as jewelry, trinkets ; and one or more pots were laid at the head. Not all the burials had the offerings, but many of them did. Weather - A Handicap. The proiect had its handicaps. The climate of the region is fickle, with days as beautiful as 41</page><page sequence="8">the landscape and at other times just as wild. It is extreme, and doles out its heat and cold - with frequent strong winds - in wholesale lots. Rain- storms are few and far between. When they do come more often than not they are a mere sprin- kle, but the heavens open sometimes to let loose a downpour that washes half the countryside into the Rio Grande. Those on the job, from supervisor down to wheelbarrow-dumper, perspired profusely under the harsh heat of the sun in summer, and shiv- ered to the blast of sleet and all manner of chill in winter. The gales swept over the ruins with- out hindrance any month of the year - then as now. An excavator could put hours to the tender work of unearthing a skeleton with trowel and brush - not daring to put any but a gentle hand to the bones lest one fall out of place before it was thoroughly studied; then comes a gust of wind only to pile sand on the delicate effort. There the rattlesnake will buzz and the five-foot- long bullsnake slither; the ants crawl and the sandburr and tumbleweed thrive under the ele- ments. Man, however, finds the going rough. The factor of weather must necessarily weigh heavily on the Archaeologist with an eye to the future, not so much to his own bodily comfort, but rather to the weather's effect on the earth- child of his digging - especially weather as uncer- tain as that of the middle Rio Grande valley. The shovel took Kuaua from its sheltering mound and laid what remained of its walls naked to the sky. The experienced excavator knows that heavenly downpours and blustery gales will soon weather away the precious result of his hard labor and Nature take it back to her Mound again - Nature, the Earth Mother who will claim what is hers to the end of time. So the solution can be only one of two things to do: re-bury the ruin scien- tifically, or wholly or partially restore it. Importance of Kuaua. Of the two ruins Kuaua, the larger, was fa- vored for partial restoration. The diggers had made a very important find at Puaray - the foot- ing of a Spanish mission; but it was at Kuaua the great discovery occurred that sent Archae- ological thoughts throughout the nation thinking in its direction, while the interest of lovers of primitive art was aroused. When Puaray was brought to daylight it was found that it comprised a dwelling that measured 400 feet from north to south and 300 from east to west, and that it was built around one plaza which contained one kiva. Kuaua, on the other hand, was built around two main plazas (north and south, divided by a middle house) with an- two kivas were found there - but six indicated the complexity of the ancient social system of the village. Then, too, the dwelling of the people, which was built in compact form as an apart- ment house, contained over 1,200 groundfloor rooms! And this massive structure, according to Castañeda, was four stories high! Allowing for the number of rooms which would be strictly other to the northeast - and not one, or a mere confined to the storage of foods and crops, the dwelling would house 1,000 to 1,500 Indians. The Largest Town in 1540. If the average grade school pupil were asked today what town was the largest in the United States in 1540 he or she would ponder, then say that there were no United States and that North America was inhabited then only by Indians who lived in tipis or wigwams and were yet to be shown by the White man how towns were built. The mind would automatically go to the north- east coast, to the settling of the Dutch colonies of New York, of the English in Virginia, and New England. No thought would be given to the re- mote Southwest. Yet in this desert region, inhab- ited by so-called savages utterly removed from Euï opean influences, were towns built in a dis- tinctive form of architecture, story upon story, and cleverly planned for the convenience and safety of the inhabitants. Kuaua then, when Coronado first looked upon it, was two and a half centuries old or there- about, while others had been in existence much longer - -centuries longer. The New World had enly been discovered 48 years previous, 80 were yet to pass before the Pilgrims should land at Plymouth Rock, and 67 before Jamestown was to be founded ; while Manhattan Island had 86 years of Indian ownership to go before Peter Minuit did his $24's worth of real estate trading. A civiliza- tion with a complex religion, substantial govern- ment, and satisfactory agricultural system thrived on American soil ages before the first European set foot on it. First Gunpowder in America? There is an interesting tid-bit in the history of Tiquex, written of so slightly in the archives that historians have given it little thought or passed it off as untrue. And that is that while Coro- nado made Tiguex his camp he sent his captain, Frai cisco Barrio Nuevo, to the Seda Dam in the nearby Jemoz mountains to secure sulphur from which a crude explosive was made. If thai is true, then it was probably at this Kuaua now in ruins that was manufactured the first gunpowder in America. And, ironically enough, the site is within the boundaries of New Mexico's county of 42</page><page sequence="9">Sandoval, where also is located the atomic bomb factory of Los Alamos - the plant that assembled the force that blasted Hiroshima 405 years later. Only 40 miles, as the crow flies, lie between the two places ; and there also lies food for thought. Dr. Luhrs supervised the crew that partially restored Kuaua. Her men were put to the job of making adobe bricks, of which in the end the ruin was found to require 350,000. Stack that number of dried-mud blocks, each measuring 14 by ten by four inches, and the result will be quite a, pile. In most parts of the ruin the exca- vated walls were found to be only six inches to a foot above the ground level, with the highest reaching to about three feet at Lummis' corner excavations. Dr. Luhrs built up these remnants to a height of about four feet for the inside walls to eight along the outside of the pueblo. 43</page><page sequence="10">Five of the kivas were partially restored, leav- ing the pits rooness ana open to the sun, but the lava oi kivas - the paintea one - was completely rebuilt as supposedly it was when .... Again, prooaoiy, maybe or perhaps .... Espejo ana Unate were loageü in it and saw the painting! A Great Find in Archaeology. The day's work began on February 14, 1935, in good order. The excavators took up their shovels and set to action, tor they know that bouy-motion was the best way to combat the cold oí the New Mexican winter day. A test trench had shown that in the northwest corner of the south plaza was buried a kiva, and decision was made that much of the work on the project be put to digging it out. Little anyone knew that before labor should cease that evening he or she would look upon one of the most remarkable "finds" in Southwestern Archaeology. Dirt was taken from the inside of the west wall and heaped to the outer side, while Spanish tongues took to conversation and wise-cracking as the job progressed. Then a man put his foot to the shovel and cast aside soil to attain a two- foot depth; then the expert eye of Gordon Viv- ian saw the first upper fragment of the famous Kuaua Murals come to light after the earth had held them for centuries. What came before his eyes were the fingers of an unlifted hand and the upper portion of a ceremonial mask, painted on the interior wall of the kiva. The interest which the "find" created put all hands to the job of getting the subterranean chamber excavated; and in time the four walls were exposed down to the floor level; three of the four elaborately painted (north, west and south) - one (the east) badly eroded. The figures depicted the anthropomorphic and zoomorphic beings that partly made up tHe complex Indian religion and were found to measure on average a height of four and a half feet, full-faced with no perspective, painted with six colors of earth pigment - black, white, red, yellow, brown and green. The layout of the kiva was of the conventional type : with the ventilator shaft running up to the fresh air at the east wall with the opening to the interior behind the deflector or aitar, the latter being merely an adobe block two and a half feet high, three and a half wide, and eight inches thick - a very efficient system of air circulation devised by some ancient mind. A pit for the cere- monial fire lay directly in front of the altar, and under the long-crumbled roof in which was a hatchway that gave entrance and exit to those people who used the kiva once rested the foot of a ladder- the ladder that pointed skyward, to the realm of the Sun God. The room, symbolizing the womb of the Earth Mother, measured about 18 by 18 feet, and a floor level was struck at a depth of eight feet. Ceremonial Fires and Prayers. Here in ancient times the Tiguex priests and medicine men conducted the religious rites of the pueblo ; here the ceremonial fire blazed as its smoke drifted upward through the hatchway to convey messages to the gods ; here secret prayers were chanted by those who were privileged to offer them, those in direct contact with the spirit benefactors, the shamans who set prayer plumes and fetishes before the altar and handled the sacred corn meal; here the dancers donned their elaborate costumes of deerskin a,nd feathers, painted their bodies to the wildest hues, before they climbed the ladder to file out and dance on the plaza - to stamp and sway, as they do today, to the beat of drums and rhythm of the chant: the pagan supplication for rain, fertility, increase and life. In this chamber no woman was ever permitted, except for the purpose of bringing food to the men. But the painted wall was yet to cause more excitement for the Archaeologists. The upper rim showed that it contained other layers of plas- ter beneath, adobe laid over adobe, put on from time to time during the centuries the kiva was in use. Accordingly, Wesley Bliss, of the Uni- versity of New Mexico, who had done much work previously in removing paleontological specimens, was assigned to the task of getting the walls out of the kiva and down to the University labora- tory for study - to take them apart layer by layer, and preserve the paintings. Tedious Laboratory Technique. A delicate assignment? Well, set to and find out how easy it is to re- move a painting done in earth pigments on a base of crumbly adobe directly over another painting - the base being about the thickness of heavy wrapping paper! The walls were cut into sections; jacketed in lath, burlap and plaster of Paris; and ha.uled in trucks to the University. There the jackets were removed except for the back permanent base, propped against the wall, and the work began. By means of pallet knives and various solu- tions the outer painting was cleaned of adobe. Each wall section was copied to scale and repro- ductions made in exact colors and size of figures. "The next a,nd last process," said Wesley Bliss, "is to remove the painted adobe layer intact from the wall and to remount it as a permanent mount. 44</page><page sequence="11">The material used for a permanent base is a commercial pressboard, or hard-board. Adobe mixed with sizing is painted over the board to give it a natural background. A solution is ap- plied to the mural painting to harden it. This solution also has a tensile strength. A second application of the solution is made ; then, a cheap grade of muslin is put on, and more of the solu- tion is added to make the contact complete. When almost dry, the muslin is rolled from the wall, and the mural painting adheres to the cloth. This is then treated and mounted on the permanent base. A solvent is applied to the cloth, which is rolled off, leaving the original painting on the mount." Work in the laboratory went on day after day, from month to month. Each layer was copied, stripped and mounted. In time the last layer, which was the first applied to the kiva centuries ago, was reached and carne before the eyes of men and women whose life work is the study of cultures long dead. The walls had given up 35 layers of plaster, 17 of them painted with the esoteric figures! The Kiva Restored. Under the supervision of Albert G. Ely - who had done work on the ruins of Quarai, Chaco Canyon, Puaray and Paako in New Mexico, who attended field schools in Mexico, Peru, Guate- mala, and is now business manager of the Mu- seum of New Mexico - the kiva was completely restored. In 1940 Zena Kavin, a young painter of Santa Fe, wa,s given the project of reproduc- ing one set of the murals on the restored walls in the exact size and color as the originals. To- day the visitor sees the kiva with its whole in- terior done over as supposedly it was when the medicine men chanted their prayers on the earthy floor. However, the great work failed to deliver the painting of the murdered priests. On one set of murals were found two prone figures, but they were dressed in Indian ceremonial attire, wore masks, portrayed pagan gods in some legend probably now forgotten - they definitely were not Christian priests. But Tiguex was not one town but 12; Kuaua and Puaray were only two. There are other sites maybe; and under their mounds perhaps .... And quite probably .... Advance Guard of Civilization. Today the Coronado State Monument stands by the Rio Grande a memorial to the lives that were lived and deaths that died on its very ground; and a reminder, to those of today who go there for a brief plunge into history, of that band of Spaniards who - though avaricious were never- theless brave, and were the advance guard of European civilization in the Southwest. It is under the direction of Dr. Hewett, its Excavator- in-Chief, and is a branch of the Museum of New Mexoco. There the custodian conducts thousands of people annually through the ruins of what wa,s once a great town ; the kiva is explained to them and all its intricacies, and they wander at will over the plazas and through the maze of rooms that long ago housed Red folk whose splendid culture was interrupted by Coronado - his gentle- men, friars and foot soldiers. At the Monument is a museum that exhibits artifacts taken from the excavations, and dior- amas that depict life dead with but the knowl- edge of it dug out from below the crust of the earth; a, life destroyed by the sword, taken to the Earth Mother of the Indian, and reclaimed by the Archaeologist's spade. "I always notice, and it is a fact," wrote the common foot soldier, Castañeda, four hundred years ago, "that for the most part when we have something valuable in our hands, and deal with it without hindrance, we do not value or prize it as highly as if we understood how much we would miss it after we had lost it, and the longer we continue to have it the less we value it; but after we have lost it and miss the advantages of it, we have a great pain in the heart, and we are all the time imagining and trying to find ways and means by which to get it back again. It seems to me that this has happened to all or most of those who went on the expedition which, in the year of our Savior Jesus Christ 1540, Francisco Vasquez Coronado led in search of the Seven Cities of Cibola."</page></plain_text>
