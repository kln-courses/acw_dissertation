Maret Maxwell National Institutes of Health Biomedical Engineering and Instrumentation Branch ABSTRACT Time-varying compressive loading was applied to unembalmed human cervical spines using an MTS closed-loop hydraulic testing machine. Load programs included relaxation, cyclic loading, variable rate constant veloc- ity loading (0.13-64 cm/sec), and constant velocity loading to failure. The failures produced were similar to those observed clini- cally. A generalized quasi-linear viscoelas- tic Maxwell-Weichert model incorporating a continuous relaxation spectrum was developed to predict the relaxation and constant veloc- ity test responses. The fit was adequate considering the complexity of the structure involved. WHILE INJURY STATISTICS generally attribute only 2 to 4% of serious trauma to the neck, any neck injury can have debilitating if not life- threatening consequences. The human neck not only contains vital neurologic, vascular and respiratory structures but it also pro- vides for the support and motion of the head. From an anatomical, neurological and mechan- ical point of view, the neck is quite complex. Much research has been done to describe neck anatomy [17,24,37],* injury mechanisms [1,2,4,7,12,15,21,24-28,31,33,35,41], and the diagnosis [3,5,11,18,20], classification [3, 6,16,19,24,39] and treatment of neck injuries, but only a few serious efforts [5,7,32] have been made to quanti tate the structural proper- ties. Many authors have studied the visco- elastic behavior of the lumbar and thoracic discs [8-10,14,22,36,38,41] but rarely have they extended their work to include the cervi- cal discs. ♦References at end of paper. This paper summarizes both experimental and theoretical studies aimed at quantifying and predicting the responses of the cervical spine to compression loading. Time-dependent responses (i.e. force~time and deformation^ time characteristics) of the cervical spine were measured and analyzed. Peak loads and deflections, strain energies and mechanisms have been summarized for all experimentally produced failures. A model that allows pre- diction of these responses has been proposed. Hopefully, the results presented in this paper will be useful in further mathematical model- ing, in the design of protective devices, and in the development of anthropomorphic models. RELATED LITERATURE Probably the earliest empirical study was Messerer's (1880) work on the mechanical prop- erties of the vertebrae. He reported compres- sive breaking loads ranging from 1.47-2.16 kN (330-486 lb) for the lower cervical spine. Later, Yamada (1970), in his extensive compil- ation on the strength of biological tissues, provided data on the static load~def lection properties of the vertebral bodies and discs. Roaf (1960) loaded single cervical spinal units in compression, extension, flexion, lat- eral flexion, horizontal shear and rotation. He found that the intact disc, which failed at approximately 7.12 kN (1600 lb), was more re- sistant to compression than wet vertebrae, which failed at approximately 6.23 kN (1400 lb). Bauze and Ardran (1978) loaded human cadaveric cervical spines in compression and reported flexion dislocations with loads of 135-145 kg [1.32-1.42 kN (298-320 lb)]. Fielding et al. (1974) conducted shearing studies of the atlas. In all cases, the 70-180 kp [0.69-1.77 kN (154-397 lb)] force required to fracture the odontoid process was greater than the 12-180 kp [0.12-1.77 kN (26- 397 lb) ] force required to tear the transverse ligament.

MC ELHANEY, ET AL. experimental fractures of the odontoid process but did not report load or deformation data. Selecki and Williams (1970) conducted an ex- tensive study of cadaveric cervical spines loaded with a manually-operated hydraulic jack. Unfortunately, they monitored the pres- sure in the hydraulic line and reported their results in terms of hydraulic pressure without indicating the ram piston diameter. Hiey were able, however, to duplicate several types of clinically observed injuries. Panjabi et al. (1975) measured rotation and translation of the upper vertebra as a function of transec- tion of the components in single units of the cervical spine. Liu and Krieger (1978) re- ported loačHle flection responses from axial compression tests on single cervical spinal units. Sanees et al. (1982) tested isolated cadaver cervical spines in compression, ten- sion and shear. A quasi-static compression failure was observed at a load of 645 N (145 lb) and dynamic f lexion/compression fail- ures were reported at loads ranging from 1.78-4.45 KN (400-1000 lb). Except for studies by Fielding et al., Liu and Krieger and Sanees et al., all of these tests were quasi-static and most researchers recorded only the maximum load. Studies have also been done on impacts to intact cadavers which involved the neck. Most notable of these were the works of Hodgson et al. (1980), who measured strains on the anterior surfaces of the bodies of C2-C7 and near the left facet joints of all of the cervical vertebrae of embalmed cadavers during crown impacts, and Nusholtz et al. (1981), who studied neck motions and failure mechanisms on unembalmed cadavers due to crown impacts. They both reported significant influence of spinal configuration on the spinal response and damage. INSTRUMENTATION Tests were conducted with a Minneapolis Testing System (MTS) servo-controlled hydraul- ic testing machine which consisted of a rigid load frame, a 6000 lb ram, a temperature- and humidity-controlled environmental chamber, a 25 gpm 3000 psi hydraulic pump, two nitrogen- filled hydraulic accumulators and a displacement-controlled feedback system. Ram motion was monitored by an integral linear variable differential transformer. Load was measured by a strain gage load cell calibrated with proving rings certified by the National Bureau of Standards. Command voltages were provided by an Exact function generator. With the MTS system, we were able to apply dis- placements at ram speeds up to 1 27 cm/sec without overshoot. Figure 1 illustrates the input displace- ment~time histories used in these studies. For the relaxation tests, the specimens were preloaded to 200 N and then subjected to ramp-and-hold command signals. For the cyclic modulus tests, sinusoidal waveforms were used. Upon completion of the cyclic modulus tests, a reference state was defined which corresponded to a 200 N preload. This preload defined a constant reference specimen length that became the initial condition for all subsequent con- stant velocity tests. Triangular waveforms were used for the constant velocity tests. Specimen loach* and de forma tion~time histories were stored on a Tektronix 5223 Digitizing Oscilloscope and then recorded onto magnetic tape with a Tektronix 4052A Graphic Computer using the WP1310 Waveform Processing System Software. High resolution x-ray images were obtained using a Hewlett-Packard Faxitron unit before and after testing.

The following questions were addressed: (1) Do changes in the mechanical proper- ties occur as time elapses after death? (2) Can the properly stored cervical spine be reequi libra ted after non-destructive testing and tested further? That is, can the cervical spine recover from tolerable load levels or are the effects of testing irrevers- ible? If the results of the first test are, in fact, repea table, what period of time is necessary for full recovery prior to subse- quent testing? (3) Does freezing significantly degrade the mechanical responses? (4) Does the cervical spine exhibit a weak enough temperature dependence between room (25°C) and body (37°C) temperatures to justify room temperature testing? All eight rhesus monkey necks were removed during nechropsy, sprayed with calcium-buffered saline, and kept sealed in waterproof plastic bags. Relaxation tests were performed on four of the specimens within 2, 24, 48 and 60 hours post-mortem. After testing, these four specimens were stored in the refrigerator, allowed to recover for vary- ing times and then retested. Figure 2 shows typical results. The four remaining specimens were frozen post-mortem, stored at -20°C for two months, and thawed in the refrigerator for four days prior to relaxation testing. These preliminary rhesus monkey tests demonstrated that: (1) Properly stored specimens tested within 60 hours post-mortem did not exhibit detectable changes in their relaxation proper- ties. A specimen was considered to be proper- ly stored if it was moistened with calcium- buffered saline and then kept sealed in a waterproof plastic bag throughout the experi- ment. This procedure was selected in order to reduce the possibility of dehydration or chem- ical changes which could shift the osmotic gradient. Total immersion of the specimen in saline was deemed undesirable because of the possibility of disc swelling due to fluid imbibition. Anything that could change the fluid balance of the disc and/or ligaments could change the stiffness and, perhaps, even the failure characteristics since disc and ligament stiffness influence the strain dis- tributions. (2) The preliminary test results have shown that even loads of tolerable levels alter the mechanical behavior of the neck. This observation may be related to the capac- ity of the intervertebral discs to imbibe and release fluid. A detailed discussion of the osmotic action of the disc is beyond the scope of this paper. When externally loaded, the disc exhibits a tendency to lose fluid and, when the external loads are removed, the disc exhibits a tendency to absorb fluid. It is hypothesized that the reequi libra tion process involves the osmotic uptake of fluid into the discs and that the reequilibrated state is the end state characterized by an osmotic balance. Figure 2 shows that a 24-hour recovery period was required between the initial test and a subsequent test in order to achieve full reequilibration and test reproducibility. During this period, the specimen was properly stored and refrigerated. (3) For periods up to two months, freez- ing had no observable effect on the relaxation responses. Panjabi et al. (1975), Hirsh and Galante (1967), and Casper (1980) also report- ed no degradation in mechanical properties due to storage by deep freezing and thawing prior to experimentation. (4) Tests performed at room temperature were comparable to body temperature tests. This conclusion agrees with Casper's (1980) observations for the intervertebral disc. 1 20 1 - 5 Hour Recovery 1 2-10 Hours Recovery A 75 . 3 - 24 Hours Recovery I O _l ' 10 28 30 TIME CMINUTES3 FIGURE 2, RHESUS MONKEY CERVICAL SPINE RELAXATION TESTS</page><page sequence="4">4.474 J. H. NC ELHANEY, ET AL* EXPERIMENTAL PROTOCOL FOR HUMAN NECK TESTS Fourteen intact unembalmed cervical spines were obtained at autopsy from cadavers. The donors, who ranged in age from 42 to 73 years, showed no evidence of cervical spine problems in their hospital records. All specimens included the base of the skull, approximately two centimeters around the foramen, at the proximal end and C5, C6, C7 or T1 at the distal end. All ligamentous struc- tures were kept intact except the 1 i game n tum nuchae where it attached to the base of the skull. The specimens were sprayed with calcium- buffered saline, sealed in plastic bags until dissection and either tested on the day of removal or frozen and stored at -20°C. At the time of testing, the specimens were thawed to room temperature and allowed to fully equili- brate with their respective fluid environ- ments. Using polyester casting resin, the ends of the specimens were cast in aluminum caps so that the caps were approximately perpendicular to the axes of the end verte- brae. During casting, the aluminum caps were cooled in a flowing water bath to minimize degradation due to the heat of polymerization. Figure 3 illustrates the lordotic curve con- figuration of the specimens after casting. Next, the initial values of a and L0 were determined, a was measured with an adjustable protractor. L0 was measured with vernier calipers. A moment M0, measured with a spring scale operating on a known moment arm, was then applied to make the end caps parallel and the cervical vertebrae approximately vertical- ly aligned. This moment varied from 5 to 30 N-m. The specimen was placed in the test fixture. / jr FIGURE 3* SPECIMEN WITH END CAPS The test fixture (Figure 4), which consisted of a dovetail slide driven by a precision micrometer lead screw, allowed movement of the distal end of the specimen with respect to the proximal end. A displacement h in the ante- rior or posterior direction was applied with the slide and the lead screw in order to obtain the desired degree of flexion or exten- sion. All specimens were x-rayed before test- ing in order to document the initial configu- ration. Finally, the test fixture was in- stalled in the testing machine.

The loadr^time histories were monitored and recorded. Figure 5 shows a typical relaxation test for a human cervical spine. A variable rate of load relaxation was demonstrated. Initially, for constant defor- mations, the load decay was extremely rapid. Thereafter, the load decayed at a much slower rate. This observation renders a standard lumped parameter viscoelastic model with a single dominant long-term time constant a poor predictor of neck behavior. Instead, a gene- ralized Maxwell-Weichert model is proposed since it incorporates an ensemble of decay mechanisms and associated time constants. CYCLIC MODULUS TESTS By definition, the cyclic modulus Gc is given by: G =l£ c Łc where Pc is the load amplitude and Lc is the deformation amplitude. A sinusoidally-varying compressive displacement of 0.7 cm peak- to-peak amplitude at 20 Hz was applied for 150 cycles to the fui ly-r eequi libra ted specimen. The load~time history was monitored and re- corded. Figure 6 shows a typical plot of Gc vs. deformation cycles. Preconditioning behavior was demon- strated. When a specimen was subjected to a repeated deformation history about a fixed length, there was a decrease in the cyclic modulus Gc as the number of deformation cycles A £ Ü ' Z v/ (0 D -I D ù O Z o H J O &gt; o 4000. 3000 Sl 2000 . t 000 . a.7 «m CYCLIC DEFORMATION AT ta Hs 50 1 00 , 1 60 CYCLES FIGURE 6, TYPICAL CYCLIC MODULUS FOR HUMAN CERVICAL SPINE</page><page sequence="6">4.476 J- H' HC ELHANEY, ET AL.

The initial cycle was representa- tive of the elastic response of the fully reequi libra ted cervical spine. Eventually, a steady-state was reached, which we defined as the mechanically stabilized state, where Gc approached a constant value and the load- deflection response was repea table. The cy- clic modulus of the mechanically stabilized state ranged from 45% to 55% of the modulus of the reequilibrated state. Figure 7 illustates, for a typical relax- ation test, the difference between the fully equilibrated elastic response and the mechani- cally stabilized elastic response. These cyclic modulus tests demonstrated the influence of the previous load history and the osmotic state of the cervical interverte- bral discs on the mechanical response. VARIABLE RATE CONSTANT VELOCITY TESTS Figure 8 shows typical results for a human cervical spine in a mechanically stabil- ized state. The deformation rate was varied by a factor of 500. The stiffness ranged from 1285 to 2250 N/cm, less than a two times increase. The indicated points are measured data. Deformation rate sensitivity is common in viscous, viscoelastic and plastic materials. For example, the ultimate strength and stiff- ness of compact bone increases with increasing strain rate [23]. Cancellous bone is sensi- tive to strain rate to a lesser degree [40]. The intervertebral disc is also sensitive to strain rate to a lesser degree [10]. The human cervical spine exhibits a dependence on deformation rate. This experi- mental result is consistent with a generalized quasi-linear viscoelastic Maxwell-Weichert model which incorporates a continuous spectrum of relaxation mechanisms and predicts a more distributed deformation rate sensitivity than the standard lumped parameter viscoelastic models • CONSTANT VELOCITY LOAD-TO-FAILURE TESTS The last test performed on each mechani- cally stabilized specimen was the constant velocity load-to- fai lure test. Ram velocity was nominally 64 cm/sec. By moving the base of the specimen one centimeter in the anterior or posterior direction via the slide and lead screw, the classical extension, compression and flexion injuries were produced. Table 1 summarizes the type of failure, the maximum load and deflection, and the strain energy or area under the loading por- tion of the load~de flection curve. Figures 9 through 1 9 show representative curves • The following four failure mechanisms were observed as the specimens buckled: EXTENSION/COMPRESSION - As the body, discs and facet joints resisted the load, the posterior elements were compressed and, as failure of the disc and end plates occurred, the cervical spine extended in a forward buckling mode. Specimen A80-339 failed in this way with rupture of the anterior longi- tudinal ligament and distraction of the an- terior section of the disc between C4 and C5. This occurred with a one centimeter posterior eccentricity. JEFFERSON FRACTURES - In the clinical literature [18], the common etiology of a fracture of the atlas is a direct blow to the top of the head. In these tests, the experi- mentally produced atlas fractures, which were usually bilateral and symmetrical, involved the anterior and posterior arches. This was probably due to the compressive force driving the articular condyles outward and bending the arches.</page><page sequence="7">CERVICAL SPINE COMPRESSION RESPONSES 4.477 KO If) O ra w Ł ' « __ "" •z ra w i E ' « V* __ ' C T3 X ' ' - &lt;D vO .'

H. NC ELHANEY, ET AL. BURST FRACTURES - Comminuted vertical fractures through the vertebral body produced fragmentation of the centrum into a number of large pieces. There were no obvious areas of compressed cancellous bone. Analysis of x-rays taken before and after each test indi- cated that the specimens that burst were slightly flexed to straight while the speci- mens that sustained the Jefferson fractures were slightly extended to straight. The burst fractures required larger forces and strain energies than the Jefferson fractures. The loadrde flection diagram exhibited a character- istic M-shape or twin peak. Specimen A80-384 showed multiple spikes in the first peak which may be related to the multiple fracturing process. ANTERIOR WEDGING - The addition of a small flexing moment arm (h &lt; 1 cm) using the test fixture resulted in compression and frac- ture of the anterior section of the vertebral body. The addition of a slightly larger moment arm (h = 1 cm) produced buckling rear- ward. Pieces of the cortical shell were dis- placed in a random pattern. End plate failure occurred and the intervertebral disc was dis- rupted. However, the amount of displacement applied to the specimen did not result in large anterior dislocation or rupture of the anterior longitudinal ligament. By careful alignment and adjustment of the slide- positioning device, we were able to produce fractures similar to those observed clini- cally. But, after fourteen tests, we had the distinct impression that one or two centi- meters forward or backward, right or left, made a tremendous difference in the outcome. Perhaps, this is the reason there is such a wide range of responses to cervical spine compression in the relevent literature [1,2,4, 1 5, 21 , 24-28, 31 , 33, 35, 41 ] .

A variety of standard linear viscoelastic models were tried and proven inadequate. These in- cluded the Maxwell, Kelvin, three-parameter solid and four- parame ter solid models. Both the presence of rapid initial load decay for fixed deformations and the fact that the hys- teresis loop and the load~ deformation response fail to exhibit the strong strain rate dependence predicted by standard lumped parameter viscoelastic models suggest that the behavior is governed by a broad distribution of relaxation times. The model developed is based on the quasi-linear viscoelastic consti- tutive law hypothesized by Fung (1972). Determination of model constants procedes in the manner used by Pinto and Patitucci (1980) for cardiac muscle, by Casper and McElhaney (1980) for the intervertebral disc, and by Sauren and Rousseau (1983). In a mechanical sense, we may view this continuous spectrum as arising from a gene- ralized Maxwell-Wei chert model. The reduced relaxation function, Yr(t), may be written as CO E + / E(t )e-t/T dT Y (t) = _ī 2 (1) r 00 E + / E(T)dT 00 0 Defining H(x), the relaxation time distribu- tion function, as H(t) = xE ( T ) (2) and substituting into equation (1), we find, after some rearrangement: oo 1 + L_ / H(T)e"t/T d(lnr) E 0 Y (t) = °° (3) r 1 + !_ / H(t )d(lnx ) E 0 OO H(t) may be approximated from experimental data as the negative slope of the relaxation modulus vs. logarithmic time plot. This slope is roughly equal to a constant, C, over a major portion of the time domain. Therefore, H(T) = -C ? tx &lt; T &lt; T2 (4) H(T) =0 ; T &lt; Tx , T &gt; T2 and the relaxation spectrum becomes: E(T) = -C/T ; T &lt; T &lt; T2 (5) E(T) =0 ; T &lt; , T &gt; T2 Defining C* as C* = -C/E«, (6) and substituting equations (5) and (6) into equation (3), we find: 1 + C* ( Ej ( t/T2 ) - EļU/T!)) Y (t) = (7) 1 + C*ln( T2 /Tļ ) where Eļ(t/x) is the exponential integral function. The relaxation spectrum approximation can be incorporated in the hereditary integral representation to allow the prediction of load~de formation behavior at various defor- mation rates. Employing Yr(t) in the quasi- linear viscoelastic representation, we find: F(6,t) = / Y (t-T) dF (6(t)) dž(T) dT (8) 0 r dS dT where F(&lt;5,t) is the force as a function of deformation and time, dFe/d&lt;5 is the slope of the 'elastic* loaded e forma ti on curve, and dô(x)/dx is the change in deformation with time. In the integral representation, Y(t-x) is obtained from a relaxation test on a mechani- cally stabilized neck and d&lt;5(x)/dx is the deformation rate. For short test times (less than 0.025 sec for full displacement), the load~de formation curves for the neck undergo rapid compaction. Instantaneous deformation of the neck is impossible to achieve in a physical sense. Therefore, the elastic load~ deformation curve is estimated from the 0.025 sec-full stroke loadr-deformation curve. For integral calculations, the pseudo- elastic loadr^de flection curves were computer- fitted to a power series in 6. Little addi- tional information was gained by extending the power series beyond a 4th-order expansion. MODEL PREDICTIONS The loading responses of the mechanically stabilized constant velocity tests were pre- dicted using the model constants calculated from the corresponding mechanically stabilized relaxation test data. The theoretical re- sults, plotted as solid lines, are compared to the experimental results, indicated as points,</page><page sequence="14">4.484 J. H. MC ELHANEY, ET AL. in Figures 8, 1 4, and 16. The measured con- stant velocity responses are predicted with reasonable accuracy within the load range of the relaxation tests upon which they were based. However, the prediction of failure loads is beyond the scope of this model. They must, therefore, be determined empirically. We are currently addressing the question of the validity of extrapolating this model be- yond the load range of the corresponding relaxation test and for predicting unloading responses. This work is ongoing. SUMMARY In the engineering disciplines, a designer starts with a basic building material and shapes it into a structure with specified load and deformation responses. These load and deformation responses are defined as the structural properties. The structural proper- ties are determined by the size, shape, con- figuration and material of which a structure is composed. In contrast, the material prop- erties are independent of the structure or shape of the material under consideration. Since the human body exists, it exhibits load and deformation responses which determine its injury potential in traumatic environments. Knowledge of the properties of the material of which the human body is composed is useful in so far as it leads to a better understand- ing of these structural properties. The structural properties of the cervical spine have been investigated, with particular emphasis on the quantification and prediction of the time-dependent responses to dynamic compression loading. A key aspect of this research has been the development of an experimental protocol that produces accurate and repea table test results and is biomechanically significant. The rhesus monkey tests established the valid- ity of delayed post-mortem testing, specimen freezing, and room temperature testing. Results of these tests and the cyclic modulus tests on the human neck have led to procedures for proper specimen storage and the defini- tions of reequilibra ted and mechanically sta- bilized states. These procedures and defini- tions are significant in that they have ensured test accuracy and reproducibility. Relaxation tests were performed on equi- librated, reequilibrated, and mechanically stabilized specimens. An initially rapid and subsequently slow load decay pattern was ob- served. The dynamic variable rate constant velocity tests were performed on mechanically stabilized specimens. Results indicated a demonstrable deformation rate dependence. Dynamic load-to-failure tests were also per- formed on mechanically stabilized specimens. A discussion of failure modes, a summary data table, and load~de flection curves indicated that the failures produced were similar to those observed clinically. It was found that small eccentricities (±1cm) in the load axis could change the buckling mode from posterior to anterior. A mathematical model with constants es- tablished from a relaxation test was devel- oped. This model predicts with reasonable accuracy the specimen behavior in constant velocity tests at different rates within the load range of instantaneous elastic response data. Extrapolation beyond this range is probably not justified. We are also currently exploring the model's predictive ability for variable rate loading and unloading tests. REFERENCES 1.
