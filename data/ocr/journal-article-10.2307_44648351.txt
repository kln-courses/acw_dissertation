Masset Laboratory of Physiology and Biomechanics Peugeot- Renault Association C. Got and A. Patel Institute of Orthopaedical Research Raymond Poincaré Hospital THE FIRST AIM of this project was to obtain a convenient dummy for lateral impact to aid in the evaluation and the improvements of automo- bile lateral protection systems. As already pointed out (l)x, when using an adequate ATD, the test results must be correc- table with those of human beings under similar loading. Accordingly, lateral collisions involve particular requirements for the dummies, which will be detailed. The utilized biomechanical reference data come from tests carried out with fresh cadavers. It was decided to use the "Part 572" dummy as a starting basis, this dummy being well known and widely used. Furthermore, one major consideration in this (x) Numbers in parentheses designate references at the end of the paper study was to improve its lateral performance while keeping for this dummy the possibility to be used in frontal collisions, either with the same characteristics as specified in Part 572 or with other performance requirements. The Problem To Be Solved - Examination of high-speed films of lateral experimental colli- sions, in which the cars struck sideaways either dummies or fresh unembalmed cadavers, gave evi- dence of significant differences of behaviour between the cadavers and the "Part 572" dummies. The cadavers were not subject to rigor mortis at the time of the test. When the arm is placed along the body, in the position naturally adopted when the hands are crossed and when the fore-arms rest on the thighs, there is an angle of about 15° between the arm and the torso line and this was the case with the cadavers seating in passenger position. ABSTRACT This study is related to the modifications of Part 572 dummy for lateral impact, to aid in the evaluation of the injury reducing potential of automotive lateral protection systems. This was done by modifying the rib cage, arms and shoulders of Part 572 so that its impact perfor- mance more closely simulates that of a human. According to biomechanical data coming from cadaver testing, the arm was modified by redu- cing the size of the structural members and in- creasing the padding of the arm; the mobility of the shoulder was increased in both forward and upward directions. Moreover, the shoulder 3596 was modified to become transversely collapsible to a certain extent. The rib cage was redesigned so as to give a more realistic deformation. The measurement of lateral chest deflection was also incorporated into the rib cage design. The fron- tal impact characteristics of the dummy, both for impact and belts, were left unchanged. The result of these modifications were com- pared with freefall and full scale crash tests with cadavers, both in frontal and lateral im- pacts. The results of these comparisons are given. 3596 0096-736X/80/8804-3596$02.50 Copyright © 1980 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc.</page><page sequence="2">The arms of the cadaver are thus jammed bet- ween the wall of the car and the thorax during the collision. A noticeable crushing was obser- ved on the flesh of the arm and a complex move- ment at the shoulder; this movement is a culmi- nation of a posterior-anterior movement (angle E of SAE J 963), an elevation of the shoulder (an- gle F of SAE J 963), and some collapse in Y-di- rection. The result for the body is a marked reduc- tion of the distance between the lower part of the neck and the side-wall; a strong lateral deflection of the thorax is also seen. The am- plitude of movements at the shoulder is greater when the shoulder is more affected by the impact. As an example, here are the kinematics ob- served on a cadaver in a lateral collision si- mulation. The details of the movement of the shoulder are given as following (in function of the ti- me) : . tg = 0 -wall /arm contact . ti (0 to 5 ms) - arm and shoulder compres- sion, causing a transversal shoulder displace- ment of 15 mm approximately (x) . t2 (5 to 20 ms) - arm and shoulder com- pression causing a simultaneous compression of the thoracic cage. The transversal shoulder displacement reached between 20 to 25 mm; simul- taneously, elevation of the shoulder of a; 15 mm caused by its rotation around the clavicle-manu- brium junction. . t3 (20 to 35 ms) - the compression conti- nued after the fracture of the clavicle (in that case). The transversal displacement of the shoul- der reached about 50 mm. . tą (35 ms) - the total thorax reduction is 80 mm when the compression reached a maximum. Under the particular test conditions of this test in which the arm was prevented to escape forward of thorax, this being due to arm rest, one can observe that the magnitude of transver- sal displacement of the shoulder is: - before the fracture of the clavicle: 22mm - after the fracture of the clavicle: 50mm Such shoulder displacement amplitudes are observed with reductions of the thorax's trans- versal diameter of about 80 mm, which means that this reduction is of about 90 mm for the whole thorax's breadth + impacted arm. Such thoracic deflections obviously come with many rib frac- tures with flail chest (AIS 3 and 4). The respective magnitude of each observed component of the shoulder motion taken as a whole depend on impact direction, initial upper- arm position (which is different for the driver and the passenger e.g.), shape and side-wall stiffness and, of course, on the side-wall velo- city during the crash. To simulate with a sufficient biofidelity the kinematics of human shoulder in each analy- sed impact configuration which are likely to (x) shoulder displacement: relative to the ster- num; measured near the upper end of the hu- merus occur in tests, some conditions are needed: - a forward shoulder rotation along a ver- tical axis (E-angle, SAE J 963), reaching some- times 90°; - an upward shoulder rotation along an hori- zontal axis (F-angle, SAE J 963), reaching some- times 30°; - a shoulder lateral displacement in Y-direc- tion which may reach up to 80 mm when the thora- cic deflection is at its maximum. The shoulder must be built in such a way that these three motions can be superimposed to test conditions. No movement of the shoulder is observed with the Part 572 dummy; crushing of flesh of the arm is relatively weak and deflection of the thorax is insignificant. Even when the arm is not affec- ted by the impact, there is a great difference of the deflection between the human thorax and the dummy's thorax. The consequences are that simulation of the movement of the head in the vehicle by the dum- my is defective; furthermore, if the side-walls of the vehicle are envisaged as covered with relatively thick padding, the respective rigidi- ties of the thorax and of the padding should be adjusted. If the thorax of a dummy is too rigid, it will penetrate the padding and will only be subject to low deceleration, but a human being would have been injured in a similar test by padding which is too hard for the human thorax. These facts agree with those published before (4) (5) (6). A research programme has therefore been undertaken for the purpose of: - determining force/deflection characteris- tics of the thorax of the human body, - modifying the Part 572 dummy to provide a thorax of suitable rigidity and satisfactory behaviour of the shoulder. The Laboratory tests carried out for deter- mining the force/deflection characteristics con- firmed and stated more precisely the previously described kinematics. Determination of Force/Deflection Characte- ri sties of Thorax - These have been defined by tests using free-fall of fresh unembalmed cada- vers. Observation and analysis are much easier under these test conditions than when accidents are simulated. Each subject was hung by its side with ropes supporting the shoulders, hips and legs (fig. 1) and then released in order to drop freely against the side. Depending on the particular test, the types of surface struck were rigid or padded. All subjects were equipped with a triaxial accelerometer, screwed to the 4th dorsal vertebra. ' The accelerometers and measuring systems meet the requirements for measuring accelera- tion of the thorax of Safety Standard 208 (SAE J 211-b and 180 Hz). Deflection of the thorax was measured by using films taken during these tests (with a Stai ex 1000 frames per second camera). During the tests made against a rigid sur- face, the relative movement of sighting marks 3597</page><page sequence="3">3598 R. L. STALNAKER, ET AL. Fig. 1 - Experimental set-up, with a dummy on the thorax seen from the back was observed. During the tests against a shock-absorbing material, the penetration of the thorax into the material makes it impossible to observe the reference plane directly. This is why a cylin- drical rod was used inserted crosswise through the thorax. One of its ends was attached to the contour of the thorax of the side struck, while the other carried sighting marks the movement of which, with relation to the thorax, was ob- served. The deflection considered was that which occurred in the mean plane of the thorax between the 3rd and 4th ribs. A load measuring plate using Kistler cells was beneath the surface struck by the thorax. The load measured approaches that applied to the top of the trunk, in view of the small mass of the shock-absorbing material. The frequency in this measurement is 180 Hz. After the test, an autopsy was carried out on each subject. Most of the injuries recorded were rib frac- tures . Knowledge of the strength of their skeleton enables the results to be interpreted more fine- ly. With this in view, undamaged parts of the ribs were taken after the test and subjected to bending and shearing mechanical tests. Like- wise, the calcination of fragments of rib made it possible to determine the percentage by weight of mineral salts in the bone. The overall re- sults (Table 1) show that exceptional subjects the skeletal strength of which is too high or too little, would bias the results. On the basis of the results of previous tests, suitable force/deflection characteri sti cs for the dummy have been selected on the basis of the following: - consideration of deflection of the half- thorax subject to impact, - consideration of those of cadavers of which the bone condition is as near as possible to that of people exposed to the risk, - consideration is not extended above a cer-</page><page sequence="4">LATERAL IMPACT 3599 Table 1 - Anthropometric Data on Subjects Test Weight Thorax (cm) Rib Mineralization No Age Sex kg Breadth Depth Circumference C/M (%) C/L (g) 104 70 M 59 27 20 88,6 29 0,248 105 47 M 54 27 20 84,5 27,5 0,227 109 68 F 49 27 21 89 21,5 0,137 111 52 M 53 28 21 86,4 24 0,274 118 46 M 49 28 20 81,5 30 0,269 121 57 M 75 32 23 96,1 32,5 0,232 122 42 F 45 26 16 77,6 40,5 0,333 128 47 M 50 28 20 84 31,1 0,196 129 57 M 44 27,5 21 87,5 21,3 0,205 130 45 F 62 25 20 79 42,2 0,292 131 47 M 45 29,5 21 90,5 30,2 0,207 132 38 M 44 27 20 86 31,9 0,319 133 67 M 61 28 23 95 27 0,171 155 42 M 69 29 20 91,6 31,94 0,264 156 25 F 57 27 17 78,7 44,75 0,296 tain number of rib fractures. It was noted during tests of lateral falls that the major part of deflection occurred on the impact side and that the same applied to injuries which mostly occurred first on the im- pact side. Furthermore, the possibility seems to be excluded of making a perfect model of the whole thoracic cage without making use of techno- logies other than those used at present for dum- mies. With one half-thorax only suitably simula- ted on the impact side, acceptable movement of the spinal column is provided in addition to realistic behaviour in relation to the padding; this facilitates good simulation of the impacts of the head and gives more significance to the measurements made at the spinal column. Simula- tion of the non-impacted half-thorax does not appear to be necessary. In order to eliminate subjects of inadmissi- ble bone condition from the analysis, subjects are illustrated in Figure 2 as a function of two parameters of mineralization of ribs, C/M and C/L. C/M corresponds to the mass of ash obtained by calcination of a fragment of rib compared with the mass of the same fragment when fresh; this gives a good approximation of the percentage of the weight of mineral salts contained in the rib. C/L corresponds to the weight of ash contai- ned in 1 cm of length of rib; the values of C/L illustrated in the figure are average values ob- tained from several positions of samples; the same applies to C/M. In order to assess the differences of mine- ralization between the subjects on which experi- ments were carried out and those of people ac- tually exposed to the risk, fragments of rib we- re taken from cadavers autopsied after a sudden death without any previous illness (suicides, accidents, etc.) As a comparison, it may be seen that subjects 130 and 132 and 156, for example, may be considered as equivalent to people expo- sed to the risk of accident while it is reasona- ble to eliminate subject 109 from an analysis which relates to the mechanical characteristics of the thorax. These choices have been confirmed by using other methods (8) . The force/deflection characteristics are ba- sically considered in the rising part of the curve that precedes the appearance of a great number of fractures; the purpose is to simulate the stiffness of a non-injured human being as well as possible, in order to achieve the opti- mization of the paddings which would provide for delaying the appearance of serious injuries as long as possible. The force/deflection characteristics of the impacted half-thorax of subjects selected are shown in Figures 3 and 4. All deflections are relative deflections shown as percentages. A summary of test results relating to the previous subjects are given in Tables 2 and 3. It may be noted that the values for forces applied to the thorax have been normalized, that is to say that the values measured have been corrected in order to approach the value which would have been obtained if the subject had weighed 75 kg, as near as possible. The following formula (Eppinger - (7)) is used: 2/3 F normalized = F measured x(true7^eight) Another important observation is that, in the experimental field in question, variations from subject to subject are preponderant when compared with variations caused by test condi- tions. The force/deflection characteristics, for falls from a height of 1-3 m against deformable or rigid surfaces, lie in the same section of the diagram (F,3") in their initial part which is that being considered.

Specific Design Considerations - Having ana- lysed the differences of the kinematics of the human being and of the dummy, and having defined convenient characteristics for the thorax, it becomes possible to modify the "Part 572" dummy with precise aims, while taking into account its specific technology. The work involved the shoulder, the arms and the thorax. Shoulder - The "Part 572" dummy was develo- ped over the years for primarily frontal impacts. The shoulders were designed to carry high belt loads in a rearward and downward direction. Con- sequently, the shoulders were designed to have very little motion capability in any direction. Because of this, in a rigid lateral impact the shoulder can neither deform, nor move out of the way of the impact. Therefore, very high for- ces and accelerations are transmitted to the tho- rax in this type of impact. In a padded impact, the rigid shoulder highly deforms the padding without any deflection of the dummy's thorax. This type of performance is contrary to what is seen in lateral impacts with cadavers, where most of the stopping distance can be from thorax de- flection and not from the arm and shoulder pene- trating the padding. In other words, a padding which performs well with a dummy can be far too stiff for a cadaver because all of the stopping distance is in the padding and not in thorax deflection, as already written. In "Part 572", the shoulder, sterno-clavicu- lar link and clavicle must be modified so as to deform, move out of the way or both in a lateral impact. This is necessary so that the lateral im-</page><page sequence="8">LATERAL IMPACT 3603 i cd Applied normalized force daN ^&lt;'''' 000 ..

The neck mount must be modified if the shoulder system is going to be allowed to move upward. Arm - The arms of Tart 572" consist of a re- latively large articulated, steel skeletal sys- tem, covered by a hard (compared to human) skin. The top of the upper arm is made largely of steel for connection to the dummy's shoulder and has very little padding at the shoulder area, less than 1 cm. The arms, for the most part, are largely over-designed. Therefore, the arm's skeletal system will be reduced in cross-sectional area, and the padding tailored to more match that of a human arm. Thoracic Cage - The thoracic cage of "Part 572" was designed to deflect in frontal impacts. This is primarily due to the fact that the ribs are Ll-shaped and fastened to the spine and ster- num at the top of the II (fig. 6). The force in a frontal impact is at the top of the U_ and per- pendicular to the center-line of the JJ , thus allowing good rib deflections. The force in a lateral impact is at the bottom of the U and along the center-line of the U, thus making large deflections, "same order of magnitude as for frontal impacts", impossible (see fig. 6). To obtain large thoracic deflection, appro- ximately 5 cm in the lateral direction on "Part 572", two approaches are possible: 1. Make the ribs considerably thinner, 2. Leave the ribs approximately the same thick- ness, and allow them to displace without ben- ding. Therefore, if the front impact response of the dummy is to be conserved, only the second approach is possible. That is, to make the rib slide in and out according to a defined force/ deflection function obtained from the cadaver tests . DESCRIPTION OF MODIFICATIONS A NEW HUMANO I D SYSTEM'S P/N 572 DUMMY, was used for this programme. The head and neck, as well as the spine, pelvis and legs, were removed. This then left what was to be considered for modification for lateral impact. The thorax system was then disassembled and each component studied for its exact function with respect to the previous considerations. Shoulder Assembly - The shoulder assembly is made up of three main parts: 1. Shoulder yoke assembly (for attaching arm to thorax) , 2. Clavicle (for forward and backward motion), 3. Sterno-clavicular link (for attachment of the shoulder to the spine and for upward and down- ward motion). The shoulder area was modified twice, succes- sively: a) First stage of modifications - Based on the observed motions, the shoulder yoke assembly was reduced in size. The yoke in "Part 572" was 4.4 cm wide. This dimension was reduced to 2.5 cm. The padding in the dummy's upper arm can now be increased by 0.95 cm. The clavicle was modified by removing the rear half of the rubber stop in the clavicle and a notch was cut in the top of the clavicle to allow the stop pin in the sterno-clavicular link to move through the top and rear of the clavicle. The top of the clavicle was made flat to allow free rotation between the clavicle and the ster- no-clavicular link.</page><page sequence="9">3604 R. L. STALNAKER, ET AL. - ii - ,Ł - y y spine J_ ». ' 7 y IF y spine - J_ ». ' F^| - ». ) ' pli ' deflection frontal impact lateral impact Fig. 6 - Thorax deflection of Part 572 dummy The outside radius of the pivot point on the clavicle was reduced so as greater rotation could be achieved by the clavicle in the forward direction. When the clavicle now rotates all the way forward a large pointed part of the back of the clavicle is now at the side of the dummy. This wing is cut off so as to make the back edge of the clavicle as flat as possible (fig. 8). The sterno-cl avicular link was modified by making the top of the link flat. A stop of the front of the spine was removed, as well as about 1 centimeter of the material to which the stop was welded. So, now with the link flat and the stop removed, the link can rotate upward until it contacts a rib on the neck mount. This rib on the neck mount was removed, allowing the ma- ximum upward motion of the sterno-clavicular link (fig. 7). Because the shoulder shock-absorber was not designed for this so great-a-range of motion, it had to be modified also. This was done by chan- ging the number of rubber washers in the shock- absorber. Each shock-absorber now has 4 hard and 3 soft rubber washers, gluded together in the lower half of the shock-absorber cylinder and 2 hard and 1 soft washers, gluded together in the top half of the cylinder. This then completes the modifications to the shoulder assembly. The- se modifications did not change the shoulder sys- tem's performances in the rearward or downward direction. That is, the system still performs the same when used with belts or air bags. b) Second stage of modifications - The shoul- der modified as above described is not able to collapse in Y-direction. It was noted in tests that the arm of the dummy remained sometimes between the thorax and the impacted surface. When it is the case, the need for a lateral collapse is obvious in order to achieve a humanlike kinematics. Therefore, it was decided to further modify the shoulder area (see fig. 9). First, a telescopic device is provided, allo- wing a stroke of about 4 cm. To achieve that, the end of the shoulder yoke glides inside the clavi- cle. Secondly, the location of the joint of the sterno-clavicular link to the dummy sternum was Fig. 7 - First stage of shoulder modifications</page><page sequence="10">LATERAL IMPACT 3605 Fig. 8 - Second stage of shoulder modifications - top view Fig. 9 - Second stage of shoulder modifications - details</page><page sequence="11">3606 R. L. STALNAKER, ET AL. lowered. This facilitates, in case of lateral impact, the expected rise of the shoulder. Arm Assembly - a) First stage - The cross- sectional area of the skeletal system of the upper arm and elbow was reduced. The width of the upper end of the skeletal system of the upper arm was reduced by 0.95 cm. This isthelo- cation where the upper arm attaches to the shoul- der yoke assembly. The diameter of the shaft of the upper arm was reduced by 1.25 cm and the el- bow width was reduced by 1.58 cm (fig. 10). Fig. 10 - Reduction of the arm skeletal system New skin was molded in two sections. The first section for the shoulder area was molded out of polyurethane and the rest Of the arm was molded out of the same material at a lower hard- ness. Improvements to the lower arm were not neces- sary because it is not usually involved in late- ral thoracic impacts. However, it had to be modified, but only to fit to the upper-arm. b) Second stage - The second stage of modi- fications of the shoulder area made necessary some minor adjustments in order to keep the ran- ges of motion. Thoracic Cage Assembly - a) First stage - The modification of the thoracic cage was the most extensive redesign undertaken on "Part 572" to convert for use in lateral impact. This was required because just reducing the thickness of the ribs would not be sufficient to give adequa- te lateral and frontal impact response; there- fore, a method had to be developed which would allow the ribs to displace laterally in a pres- cribed way, and not change their force/deflec- tion relationship in frontal impact. This requirement was achieved by inserting two horizontal cylinders into the spine: one cylinder at the level of R2 and the second at R5. The first three ribs were connected by a rod to a piston in the first cylinder, with the se- cond three ribs connected by a rod and piston to the second cylinder (see fig. 11). The ribs were disconnected from the spine and made shorter. Rubber washers were inserted into the cylinder to achieve the required late- ral force/deflection relationship. The overall dimensions of the thorax have undergone no chan- ge- The design of this system has to be broken down into two parts: 1. the design of the ribs, 2. the design of horizontal thoracic displace- ment cylinder. New Rib Design - The force/deflection rela- ti on?ínp_õ7_ITPârt-5 7 2" in frontal impacts is due to two things. First, the rib is U-shaped, as described, and attached to the spTne and sternum plate; and secondly by the rib's thickness. If lateral displacement is required, the ribs have to be disconnected from the spine and shorten to al low the displacement. Also, the ribs are now attached to rods at the location of the rib sup- port cylinders. This gives new boundary condi- tions and in effect, raises the stiffness of the ribs. The relationship between the displacement and force for loading of the ribs are given from classical stress analysis, as: D = K F TP where D = displacement, K = shape constant, F = force, h = rib thickness. Now, knowing this, a test of the "Part 572" rib with the original boundary conditions can be made, and the force/deflection relationship de- termined. A second test of Part 572 rib can be made, supporting the rib in the modified position. The shape constant can be determined from this test. Knowing the shape constant and the slope of the first test, with the original boundary condition, the new rib thickness can be deter- mined; so the new rib with the new boundary con- ditions will have the same force/deflection re- lationship as the "Part 572" rib and the origi- nal boundary condition. Therefore, the new rib thickness was deter- mined to be 2.5 mm as compared to 3.175 mm for</page><page sequence="12">LATERAL IMPACT 3607 Fig. 11 - Lateral thoracic deflection system the "Part 572" rib. The same procedure was follo- wed to determine a new rib thickness to simulate Hybrid III flexibility. The new rib thickness for the Hybrid III rib was found to be 1.5 mm. Force/deflection tests of the new ribs were made with the new supporting system and compared to the Part 572 rib in both the original and mo- dified supporting conditions. Design of Horizontal Thoracic Displacement Cyl inders - The horizontal thoracic displacement cylinders were designed to give the maximum dis- placement possible with the available space in the thoracic cage. A 40 mm stroke were first ob- tained. The connecting rods between the ribs and the cylinders were made square to prevent rota- tion of the rods in frontal impacts. Displacement measurement of the thorax was obtained by placing a magnetic pick-up over the connecting rod, with slots, in the end of the horizontal cylin- ders. The overall schematics of the function of the cylinders and of the thoracic cage are given in fig. 11. The design of the rubber washers was made on the base of dynamic and static tests in the tho- racic cylinders. The last thing to be done is to adjust the weight and center of gravity of the thorax of the "Part 572". This was done by placing weight between the two cylinders in the spine and by adjusting the mass at the end of the pelvis adapter before fixing it to the bottom of the spine. b) Second Stage- Some design improvements allow to increase the stroke giving lateral de- flection. 55 mm were achieved. RESPONSE TESTS OF A MODIFIED DUMMY Lateral Impacts - After some elementary tests performed to tell whether the new thorax opera- tes correctly, a series of tests was carried out on the dummy under conditions similar to those of the reference tests with free-falling cada- vers. Following results concern a dummy equipped with the first shoulder version, i.e. without a degree of freedom in Y-direction. a) Falls onto rigid surfaces - Tests of sideaways falls against flat and rigid surfaces were carried out, like configuration Bb (Table 2), without involving directly the shoulder. Height of fall was 1 m and the arm of the dummy was at an angle of approximately 20° to the thorax, therefore a little more than the 15° noted inside some vehicles with cadavers. A first test was carried out with the dummy chest allowing a 4 cm deflection stroke. The two horizontal cylinders contained 7 one-centi- meter thick rubber washers of 40-shore hardness. The film analysis showed that the dummy arm did not remain between the thorax and the impac- ted surface. Deflection of the thorax assembly was carried out correctly. Internal deflection, recorded by means of magnetic pick-ups, was 3.5 cm on the side impact, for the two superimposed sections of the thorax. True deflection, measured from films, is greater because it was caused by crus- hing of the skin and a few bend on the ribs. The force/deflection curve plotted by means of the films shows that the behaviour of the thorax is similar to that of the human thorax from the point of view of deflection. Stiffness of the thorax is included among the various tests on cadavers and its maximum value is admissible, allowing for the fact that no attempt is made on the dummy to simulate deflection caused by a great number of fractures of ribs (fig. 12). A similar test was performed, using a chest allowing 5.5 cm deflection. The deformable mate- rial was made of 9 rubber washers of 70-shore hardness. Results are on figure 13. The force/ deflection curve is too high in that case. b) Falls onto paddings - These falls are a better reference than falls on rigid surfaces, because they are closer to the conditions of fu-</page><page sequence="13">3608 R.

The dynamic crushing of the pad- ding has to be considered. It was found 80 mm for the 40-shore test and 120 mm for the second test: the average dynamic crushing of the pad- dings amounted to 65 mm in the cadaver tests. The lower weights of the subjects have to be taken into account. On the whole, these results show it is possible to adjust the lateral stiff -ness of the dummy chest in order to obtain a humanlike behaviour. c) Tests with improved shoulder - More re- cent drop tests have been performed, using the collapsible shoulder (Aa configuration). The ki- nematics of the modified dummy and of the cada- vers look similar. These results have to be con- fi rmed . Frontal Impacts - Tests of frontal impacts on the thorax have been carried out under condi- tions defined by "Part 572". It has been found that the dummy performance is inside the limits allowed by the Part. The most advanced dummy was used in a belt restraint test, in the same run as a standard "Part 572" dummy. It is impossible to conclude from a single run; however, the modified dummy worked without being damaged; the measurement values have a convenient order of magnitude. DISCUSSION THE MAIN OBJECT was to construct a dummy giving a response to lateral impact similar to that of human cadavers, and has been attained under a certain field of test conditions. The response of the dummy to the first types of tests is roughly similar to that of human bodies. The development is going on and the deflec- tion characteristics will be more in depth studied. The shoulder and the arm were correctly dis- engaged during tests of free-fall (angle torso- line/arm about 20°). A survey is at present being carried out to determine the conditions of disengagement and of non-disengagement of the arm, on human cadavers. The dummy shoulder will be improved to provide a behaviour as human- like as possible. Finally, in the event that there should be no disengagement of the arm in the case of human cadavers, it is noted that the shoulder is sufficiently deformable that it does not prevent crushing of the upper thorax. Questions related to injury criteria for this dummy remain open. The chest design allows acce- lerations, deflection and even forces to be used. CONCLUSIONS An anthropomorphic dummy, "Part 572", has been modified with the intention of using it for both lateral and frontal impacts; biomecha- nical data have been accumulated for the purpose and have been used for specification and cons- truction of this dummy. The first results are encouraging; further developments are expected; the design adopted allows adjustment of the characteristics of the thorax and meets roughly the many requirements governed by observation of human behaviour. This research was conducted under contracts with French Government and with European Econo- mic Community. The findings and views expressed here are those of the authors. REFERENCES 1. JH.
