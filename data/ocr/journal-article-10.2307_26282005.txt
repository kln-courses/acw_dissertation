<plain_text><page sequence="1">rrfr NOTES AND DISCUSSION WOMEN AND WYNDHAM LEWIS "I'm sorry if I've been too brutal girls,"1 sings Wyndham Lewis in One-Way Song. Many critics, in fact, feel that Lewis's treatment of females has been brutal and speak freely of Lewis's "dislike of women" and "his somewhat savage criticism of their sex."1 Such remarks betray a facile understanding, at best, of Lewis's work. The confusion arises, no doubt, from a too-hasty perusal of Lewis's polemical writings, in which he avows his dislike of militant feminists on one hand and romantic "feminine" women on the other. What other sort is left? asks the critic bent on other pursuits and immediately places Lewis in one of the "classes" (that of the woman-hater) that he abhorred so strongly. We will discover presently what "other sorts" of women are possible in Lewis's view; meanwhile a re-examination of Lewis's feminist and feminine satire is in order. A dislike of slushy romantic femaleness is not difficult to understand, and Lewis wastes no polemics on it. A dislike of feminism is not so fashionable these days, however, and Lewis devotes a good deal of discussion to the "sex-war" in Hitler and The Art of Being Ruled. Just as feminine women are a class controlled by men, feminist women are a class controlled by Big Business, according to Lewis. It was the "control" element that he hated so intensely in the concepts of "class" and "race," because such control is opposed to the freedom of the in dividual intellect.

Feminist women are mechanical by virtue of their robot-like adherence to the "mechanical ascendancy"' of their group or class. Feminine women are mechanical, and hence anti-intellectual, in yet another way, which is hinted at in Tarr when the narrator remarks of Bertha, "The machine, the sentimental, the indiscriminate side of her, awoke,"4 and which is made even more explicit in the short story "Joint" when Joint sees the maid: "From insect to woman was on ly a step: for it was only another form of the same promiscuous excitability."5 Animal nature, in other words, is mechanical for Lewis; Nature runs the robot. It is the feminine preoccupation with animal/mechanical affairs to which Lewis refers when he speaks of "the natural feminine hostility to the intellect."' Both of these types—the feminist and the feminine—are vigorously satirized in Lewis's "automaton" period,7 and the satirical portraits deserve a close inspec tion. Beginning with the "feminist" satire, we discover the "Leipmann circle" of Tarr, which is presented as only mildly ridiculous and not especially militant: "The Leipmann circle. . .stood for a group. For chief characteristic this par ticular bourgeois-bohemian circle had in the first plan the inseparability of its members. Should a man, joining them, wish to flirt with one particularly, he must flirt with all—flatter all, take all to the theatre, carry the umbrellas and the paint boxes, of all. Eventually, should he come to that, it is doubtful if a proposition of marriage could be made otherwise than before the assembled band. And marriage alone could wrench the woman away from the clinging bunch, if it did succeed in doing that" (Tarr, p. 82). This apparently harmless Liepmann circle develops into the "Lesbian-Apes" of The Apes of God, and in that novel the satire becomes more serious. Like the Liepmann circle, the Lesbian-Apes dabble in art, and Dan is sent to spy on them. Upon his first en counter with one, there is some confusion as to its sex: "With alarm he glanced up. Before him stood a severe masculine figure. In general effect it was a bavarian youth-movement elderly enthusiast. . . .But this was a woman, as in fact she had appeared in the typed description. Of that he felt tolerably certain, because of the indefinable something that could only be described as 'masculine.' An heroic something or other in the bold blue eye, that held an eyeglass, that reminded him of the Old Guard or the Death-or-Glory-Boys, . . . secured for him certainty of the sex at least without further worry. It was She. This was Miss Ansell."' The Lesbian-Ape continues to be rendered in masculine terms throughout sWyndham Lewis, The Lion and the Fox: The Role of the Hero in the Plays of Shakespeare (London: Grant Richards, 1927), p. 296. 4Wyndham Lewis, Tarr (London: Calder and Boyers, 1918), p. 131.

The Lesbian-Apes are feminists, and they are also homosexual, thus emphasizing Lewis's theory of feminists breeding inversion. They also balance one of the framing satires of The Apes of God, the Dan-ZagTeus male inversion. A good deal of comedy is afforded as well, of course, by Lewis's satire of feminists. One of his most hilarious single portraits is of a feminist woman, Agnes Irons in The Revenge for Love. It is a nice irony that, at Agnes' en trance, the romantic feminine woman (which Margot still is at this point in the novel) is rudely interrupted in her reverie by the boistrous feminist: "She [Margot] turned her head upon her shoulders; and her eye twinkled feebly, as the image of a starched-collared and jacketed, a scotch-tweeded amazon, equipped for the sex-war with an alarming chin and jet-black eye—Agnesl —impressed itself upon her senses."' It is a further ironic touch that, just as romantic women make both Tarr and Snooty ill, so "Agnes smelled of peat, which always made [Margot] feel a little sick" (RL, p. 233). Both the feminine and the feminist are nauseating in their own way. Agnes is rendered almost wholly in terms of her very manly laughter, a Lewisian character detail paramount to Humph's chin in Snooty Baronet or Dan's sore feet in The Apes: For five or ten minutes after her entrance Agnes made no remark whatever without an obbligato of deafening laughter, which lasted for a longer or shorter period upon some principle of jolly-good sortishness, of seeing the humorous-side-of-things, admitting no visible relation to the ratio of comic matter in its verbal counterpart. She stood rocking with laughter now, as if shaken by hiccups, her legs wide apart in golfing at titude. Her merry eyes were . . . screwed up as if to spy out a distant bunker: all her teeth were un covered, and anyone would have thought that the most side-splitting object on earth had now been given house-room in her flatlet. . . . (RL, p. 2S3) What, we might ask, does Lewis do with his other women characters, the ones who aren't aggressive feminist caricatures? For one thing, we may observe that they are not dismissed by neglect—in The Apes of God, for instance (notably at Pamela Farnham's tea party and at Lord Osmund's lenten party) the women are given just as much and the same kind of artistic attention as the men. In Snooty Baronet, "Old Val" is just as fully drawn as Humph or Snooty (even though one of the latter is probably the main character). Apart from these considerations of sheer description, however, there is the other type of woman Lewis singles out as the object of satire, the romantic female discussed earlier. It will be recalled that Lewis especially detested the animal, "mechanical" natures of such women; Geoffrey Wagner, in his account of Lewis's external approach, remarks that "Nearly all his characters are called machines, at some stage or other, and the more often they are called machines, •Wyndham Lewis, The Revenge for Love (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 19S7), p. 232. Subsequent references, identified as RL, will be listed parenthetically in the text. NOTES AND DISCUSSION 225</page><page sequence="4">the less the reader may take it Lewis likes them."1® Bertha Lunken is one of the earliest satiric portrayals of the romantic woman, and at first glance she doesn't appear to be particularly mechanical: "Through girlhood her strong german senses had churned away at her, and claimed an image from her gentle and dreamy mind. In its turn the mind had accumulated its impression of men, fan cies from books and conversations, and it had made its hive. So her senses were presented with the image that was to satisfy and rule them. They flung them selves upon it as she had flung herself upon Tarr" (Tan, p. 47). The mechanical nature of such romanticizing, however, lies in the fact of control: Bertha's romanticism makes her a robot, controlled by the men in the novel. Tarr, for instance, calmly describes her to Butcher as "a high-grade aryan bitch, in good condition, superbly made; of the succulent, obedient, clear peasant type" (Tarr, p. 29). His reason for this detachment is his theory that his passions and emo tions must be reserved for his art—"Surrender to a woman was a sort of suicide for an artist" (Tarr, p. 194). Kreisler has the opposite theory—" 'woman' was the aesthetic element in Kreisler's life" (Tarr, p. 95)—but he too controls the Bertha-robot, even quoting Nietzsche to the effect that "When you go to take a woman you should be careful not to forget your whip\" (Tarr, p. 206). Cantleman, we may note, in "Cantleman's Spring-Mate" affects the same disinterested attitude to women as Tarr; but even in that story (written in 1917) Nature runs the robot. Sex itself is described in Tarr in mechanical terms. The following account of Tarr and Anastasya is told, significantly, from Tarr's point of view: She crossed her legs. The cold grape-bloom mauve silk stockings ended in a dark slash each against her two snowy stallion thighs which they bisected, visible, one above the other, in naked expanses of tempt ing undercut, issuing from a dead-white foam of central lace worthy of the Can-Can exhibitionists of the tourist resorts of Paris-by night. Tarr grinned with brisk appreciation of the big full-fledged baby's coquetry pointing the swinish moral under the rose and mock-modestly (sic) belowstairs, and he blinked and blinked as if partly dazzled, his mohammedan eye did not refuse the conventional bait; his butcher-sensibility pressed his fancy into professional details, appraising this milky ox soon to be shambled in his slaughter-box, or upon his high divan. (Tarr, p. 29) It is significant too that the imagery makes effortless and natural transitions be tween the mechnical (the "dark slash. . .which they bisected") and the animal (the "snowy stallion thighs," the "milky ox"). Similar accounts of the mechanical matings of robots are given in other of Lewis's novels as well. In The Apes of God the incident is exploited for its humor; Matthew Plunkett and the diminutive Betty Bligh begin their copulation in the following manner: Betty was equal to the occasion. She had come in with the perfect animal assurance to be expected of a puppet. . . . The bold-eyed round-buttocked small boy's body vaulted backwards slap up on a table-top that was ever so high up, in sitting posture, dangling the little plover's egg home-spun doll-leggies brightly to and fro. . . .He watched her chewing. The grinding of her grenadine tinted lips was what he watched, her small painted beak was sucking the imaginary juices of transatlantic trees. . . .Matthew breathed very deeply. He took one cart-horse stride to the front which brought him up against the 10Wagner, Wyndham Leuns, p. 281. 226 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="5">tabic. The sham-gum-chewing lips grinned up at this funny boy. With both hands he seized her head, holding it in his palms like an orangoutang which had possessed itself of a coconut, and preparatory to breaking it, held it chest-high, to delect itself with its intact and hairy roundness, like that of an animal-head. The passive baby-girl gazed back, a little inquisitive. (AG, pp. 95-97) Once again the mechanical ("puppet," "doll-leggies") merges fully with the animal ("small pointed beak," "orangoutang"). It is perhaps difficult to envisage sex-play rendered in any more mechanical terms than this; but in Snooty Baronet this end is achieved, partly through the devices of the hero's mechanical parts, his wooden leg and the steel plate in his skull. Snooty does the reporting: She grappled with me at once. . . .1 went to meet her. . . .my mechanical leg giving out an ominous creak (I had omitted to oil it, like watches and clocks these things require lubrication). I seized her stiff ly round the body. All of her still passably lissom person . . .gave. It fled into the hard argument of my muscular pressures. Her waist broke off and vanished into me as I took her over in waspish segments, an upper and nether. The bosoms and head settled like a trio of hefty birds upon the upper slopes of my militant trunk: a headless nautilus on the other hand settled upon my middle, and attacked my hams with its horrid tentacles—I could feel the monster of the slimy submarine-bottoms grinding away beneath, headless and ravenous. . . .Squatted upon the extremity of the supper-table, with my live leg (still laden with hearty muscles) I attacked the nether half of my aggressive adversary, and wound it clearly round her reintegrating fork. (We were now both suspended upon my mechanical limb.)11 Once more we may note the blend of animal-mechanical imagery, and once more the incident is related from the male's point of view. In contrast to the situation in Tan or The Apes of God, however, in Snooty Baronet the female robot seems to be as much in control of manoeuvers as the male; they are two ponderous machines, going clumsily through the sterile motions expected of them. In Lewis's "automaton" period, then, the detached observer in his novels (sometimes the author-narrator, sometimes one of the characters) describes sex, like everything else, in terms of externals alone, in which the aspect of control is uppermost: the robot-characters are controlled by one of the partners, by Nature, or, in the case of The Apes of God, by nobody. And this is only the logical extension, we might remind ourselves, of Lewis's satire of the romantic female. Before we leave the "automaton" period, however, there is a curious ex ception to be noted, and that is the rape of Bertha Lunken by Kreisler in Tarr. The romantic female is there, the animal imagery is there, but the mechanical imagery is conspicuously absent, and—astonishingly—the "inner" workings of Bertha's mind after the rape are portrayed with something amounting to sym pathy and sincerity:1* Her attitude was reminiscent of the way people are seen to stand, bent awkwardly forward, neck craned out, slowly wiping the dirt off their clothes, or spitting out the remains of their polluted drink, cursing the person who has victimized them, after the successful execution of some practical joke. This had been, too, a practical joke of the primitive and whimsical order, in its madness and inconsequence. But it was of a solemn and lonely kind, more like the tricks that people play upon themselves: at its con "Wyndham Lewis, Snooty Baronet (London: Cassell, 19S2), p. 45. "On this point we must disagree with such critics as John Holloway, who likens the rape scene to "a surgical operation. . .being forcibly performed," ("Wyndham Lewis: The Massacre and the In nocents," Hudson Review, 10 [1957-58], 171-188, 174.) NOTES AND DISCUSSION 227</page><page sequence="6">summation there had been no chorus of intelligible laughter.— An uncontrolled satyrlike figure had suddenly leapt away from the battling Amazon —it was all over, the day was lost. She lay convulsed upon her back, her mouth smeared with blood: in a struggle that had been outrageous and extreme, rolling in each other's arms, like confederates beneath the same ban of the world's law, only calling to each other hoarsely under their breaths, Bertha and he had fought out the simple point, mysteriously fierce, like snarling animals. A joke too deep for laughter, parodying the phrase alienating sorrow and tears, had been achieved in this encounter. {Tan, p. 175) The mock-heroic tone cannot destroy the sense of pathetic nobility with which Bertha seems to be invested; and a further attempt by the narrator to point out the inanity of her mind's functionings only serves to enhance this impression: "Bertha's hidden face was strained into an old woman's bitter mask, inane tears soaking into it. A watchful fate appeared to be inventing morals to show her the folly of her perpetual romancing: this was its last cynical invention: what had occurred was senseless, there was not a visible pinshead of compensation. It never occurred to her that such things could be arrived at without traversing romance. But where oh where was the romance in this occurrence? The terrible absence of romance crushed her" (Tan, p. 176). The incident stands out because of the felicitous portrayal of the emotional workings of the character, which is atypical of Lewis's "automaton" period of writing; it comes close, in fact, to the internal monologue, or as Lewis termed it, "the romantic snap-shotting of the wandering streams of the unconscious, ... a phenomenon of decadence."13 It was not that Lewis never employed the stream of-consciousness technique, of course; in Men Without Art he explicitly tells us when it is to be used: "What I think can be laid down is this: In dealing with (1) the extremely aged; (2) young children; (3) half-wits and (4) animals, the in ternal method can be extremely effective. In my opinion it should be entirely confined to those classes of characters" (MWA, p. 120). Hence, he explains, both the outside and the inside of Lady Fredigonde, the prelude to The Apes of God, are recorded. This brings us to an anomaly in the person of Margot Stamp in The Revenge for Love, who is neither an old person, a child, a half-wit nor an animal, but who is nevertheless portrayed in terms of her consciousness rather than solely in terms of her outer shell. Our first glimpse of her is illustrative of this change in Lewis's technique in 1937: The taut lines of an extreme fatigue went down to the extremities of her mouth, which was well shaped and gentle, and of a youthful red. Her eyes were charged with the same painful uncertainty as was betrayed in her hesitation to get up. . . .She had been crying, muffling the bitter spasms lest she should waken Victor. She had been saying to herself that love was vain, that love could do nothing, that the gods had a hatred for love; that love, in short, was unlucky! What could love do against events? She felt herself a frail contraption, to stand up to time and what each day brought forth and had in storel (RL, pp. 65-66) We instantly notice Margot's mouth, "which was well shaped and gentle, and of youthful red" and which none of Lewis's previous automata with their latch-like mouths could have possessed. We also notice her romantic conjectur "Lewis, Men Without Art (London: Cassell, 1934), p. 127. Subsequent references, identified as MWA, will be listed parenthetically in the text. 228 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="7">ing about love; but we become aware as the book progresses that, curiously, Margot is neither the satirized feminist woman nor the satirized feminine woman. In fact, she is not satirized at all and must be examined more closely. William H. Pritchard refers to her as "the surprise of the book."" Hugh Kenner goes into more detail: "The Revenge for Love is saved specifically by Margot Stamp's abashment of her creator's satiric energy. Hanging on the border of non-entity, Margot remains precariously real. Her reality, indeed, is the key to the meaning of the book, and the Lewis prose, addressed for the first time to the presentation of such a figure, respects her eggshell autonomy and that of her husband."" In fact, Lewis not only respects Margot, we note with astonishment, he also seems to like her. Even in his somewhat sardonic descriptions of her fierce loyalty to Victor, there is an undercurrent of affection present: "Victor slept. In sleep he was heroic, with the balance of the High Renaissance in the proud dispersal of his limbs. He slumbered upon Sean's cushions as if upon iron clouds, in a Michelangelesque abandon. Margot watched him, with the mater nal patience of a tiny bird mounting guard over a giant cuckoo foisted upon it, which she loved more than the child of her own humble egg" (RL, p. 179). The "bird" metaphor is characteristic of Lewis's depiction of Margot throughout the novel: Victor thinks of her trustfulness as that "of a bird that makes its nest against your window" (RL, p. 77), and later he comforts her "as he might have secured a wild bird that had come to some harm" (RL, p. 229); her head is that "of a small wistful seabird" (RL, p. 66); she starts off to obtain food for Victor at a party "as a bird that quits the nest at an unexpected promise of fresh worms" (RL, p. 170); Victor's pet name for her is "Honey Duck." Such an anthropomorphic metaphor is characteistic of The Revenge for Love and uncharacteristic of Lewis's previous prose, in which animal imagery was generally linked with mechanical imagery for the purpose of portraying robot-activity, as we have seen. The change in style may be indicative of a change in attitude; Hugh Kenner, at least, believes that this is so. It disturbs Kenner that Lewis's automata "act but never interact," and he is concerned to establish "the human reality [underlying] these gesticulations."1' Kenner is aware, of course, that the automata are not meant to be real, that only their surfaces are meant to be presented, along with the detached intellectual observa tions of certain characters such as Tarr and Snooty. In contrast to these emo tionless individuals who base their world on ideas alone, Kenner remarks that "Only Margot is devoted to anything more than an idea. . . . The one thing recalcitrantly real in the universe of the book remains Margot's love, tinselled though it is with delusions concerning the plane of Victor's worthiness."17 Such talk of "the human reality" is dangerous when one is discussing Lewis, who would undoubtedly argue that the mechanical surfaces are just as much a part of reality as the inner emotions. It may be conceded, however, that Margot does not appear to be the usual Lewisian simulacrum and that, in her, Lewis does appear to probe a stream of consciousness, albeit somewhat cautiously. "William Pritchard, Wyndham Leuns (New York: Twayne Publishers, 1968), p. 118. 15Kenner, Wyndham Lewis, p. 125. 1ÄKenner, Wyndham Lentis, pp. 48, 49. 17Kenner, Wyndham Lewis, pp. 135, 150. NOTES AND DISCUSSION 229</page><page sequence="8">It will be further noticed that Margot, unlike most other Lewisian charac ters whether they are automata or not, develops in the course of the novel. At the beginning we see her as a somewhat foolish, typically romantic female and the object of Victor's condescension. There is a touch of mockery in the record ing of her romantic reveries at this stage: "It was for Victor's sake that she desired to go back and retrace her steps; to sacrifice once more, upon the altar of Australian passion, 'the hermit girl' of her little enervated fabrication—the clever picture of a lonely girl, to whose immaculate conception Virginia Woolf had so decisively contributed" (RL, p. 2S0). There are two incidents at least by which Margot, through shocks of awareness, is jolïed out of her romanticism, and Lewis relates each of them in careful detail. One is the "dwarf" incident (from which the reader is not quite sure what Margot learns but becomes aware of the "submerged tenth" of her personality), and the other is the scene by the brook, to which a whole chapter is devoted and in which Margot realizes the ir relevance of Ruskinite Romanticism to life—"Was this a moment to be flirting with 'nature'—with a guide-book to its charms, to make it worse and more ridiculous?" (RL, p. 299). Even though Victor patronizes her (and to this she responds with a contin uing patient sweetness), the reader constantly recognizes that Margot is more aware than Victor. Once again we encounter a phenomenon which is amazing for a Lewis character—she appears to be aware by virtue of some sort of intui tion. At the O'Hara party, Margot "could not reach out, to express her misgiv ings, into the difficult realm of speech, where all these disparities of thinking and acting would fall into place and be plausibly explained; but she was con scious nevertheless of a prodigious non-sequitur, at the centre of everything that she saw going on around her—of an immense false-bottom underlying every seemingly solid surface, upon which it was her lot to tread" (RL, p. 161). Perhaps Margot's "sixth sense"' coming from Lewis is not so difficult to swallow if we consider his personal views concerning women as he outlines them for us in The Art of Being Ruled: "I am able to observe very little difference between men and women, and my liking and interest are equally distributed. If anything women represent, I believe, a higher spiritual average" (my italics; A BR, p. 190). A successful love relationship exists between Margot and Victor Stamp, something we have not previously witnessed in a Lewis novel. It will be remarked, however, that we still do not have a successful sex encounter—one that is not mechanical, that is; nor does one ever occur in Lewis's fiction, the reason being, we suspect, that it would be too uncomfortably sentimental. As it is, Victor often cradles Margot against him soothingly and awkwardly, but never makes love to her, and even their devotion is categorized by Kenner as "loyalty. . .the least personal form of love."11 Lewis is not by any means ready to risk the mawkish, and it is this discipline, in part, that makes the novel a success. Margot's development is not a sudden denial of romanticism in favour of reality; she remains the feminine idealist, true to her cause of Victor, to the end. Rather, her development is rendered in terms of the narrative voice, always '"Kenner, Wyndham Leuns, p. 118. 230 MODERN FICTION STUDIES</page><page sequence="9">a tricky subject with Lewis. In his previous "automaton" novels, there is usually a character upon whose shoulder Lewis conveniently perches—we see the antics of the Apes largely in terms of Dan's idiocy, for example, and Sir Michael Kell Imrie provides our focal point in Snooty Baronet. We do not care about Dan, however (he is too inane), and we do not care about Snooty (he is too detached). Lewis does not care about them either—he merely watches and listens to them with intense interest—and they do not care about each other. No one really minds, for example, when Snooty shoots Humph in the back, except for Old Val, perhaps, who is only a silly romantic female with built-in responses anyhow. It is as though Lewis, as well as his characters (and eventually his readers), are esconced in a type of structuralist solipsism, a valid artistic position, no doubt, but one which involves only the intellect. Lewis's creation of Margot Stamp in volves something more. Although the narrative continues mockingly to imitate her romantic terminology ("She had been well-meaning! More than that, she had aimed at something of more positive virtue, like the fortitude of women in the grand roles of life, after she had fallen out with her great mentor" [RL, p. 365]), the fact remains that Lewis cares about her, and we care about her. The entire last section of the novel, Part VII, in which the events come together, is devoted to Margot's consciousness. Even though the section is caustically entitled "Honey-Angel," it is through Margot's eyes that the reader witnesses the conclu sion (and the meaning) of the events of the book. In other words, according to Pritchard, "She moves closer in knowledge and sympathies to the most inclusive consciousness in the novel—that of Wyndham Lewis, the narrator."" The Revenge for Love is the first Lewis novel to have a non-detached, non-cynical narrator, and it is significant to our study that the character through which this is achieved is a woman. It is Margot's "strained and hollow voice" which somewhat melodramatically sounds in Percy Hardcaster's ears in the last paragraph of the novel, having the last word and producing the desired effect on both Percy and the reader: "The eyes in the mask of THE INJURED PAR TY dilated in a spasm of astonished self-pity. And down the front of the mask rolled a sudden tear, which fell upon the dirty floor of the prison" (RL, p. 280). After Margot there were to be other sympathetic female characters in Lewis's novels, such as Hester Harding in Self-Condemned and Mary Chilling ham in The Red Priest. The detached male narrator, in fact, virtually disap peared from Lewis's work after 1937, and even the male hero played a diminished role. Lewis was not, we may conclude, a woman-hater. What he disliked was the exploitation of women by their division into robot-classes, the feminist class on one hand and the feminine class on the other. Both of these classes are unthink ing puppet-groups, and Lewis's hatred of such groups remained adamant throughout his career: in Rude Assignment in 1950 he still asserts that "What I call in The Art of Being Ruled 'the dance of the Puppets' is to my way of think ing the reverse of freedom."10 JUDITH MITCHELL 1#Pritchard, Wyndham Leuns, p. 127. ,0Wyndham Lewis, Rude Assignment: A Narrative of My Career Up-to-Date (London: Hutchin son, 1950), p. 180.
