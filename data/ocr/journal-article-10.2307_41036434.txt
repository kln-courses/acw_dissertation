<plain_text><page sequence="1">Lower Scythia in the Western European Geographical Tradition at the Time of the Crusades* In memory of Valentina Galaktionovna Morozova LEONID S. CHEKIN Chronicles and annals, romances and epics of medieval Western Europe contain various data on the history and geography of Rus'. Although often vague and open to dispute, all of this evidence1 taken together seems to point to the fact that Western Europeans had some knowledge of the geo- graphical and ethnic situation in the region as far back as the tenth century, to say nothing of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. Yet the image of Eastern Europe depicted in the geographical literature of those times - in maps of the world and narrative descriptions of the earth - does not fully live up to this conclusion. Western European geogra- phers drew their information about Scythia inferior, or Lower Scythia - the area between the Don and the Danube - primarily from works by later Roman authors. Sanctified by the trusty ancient authorities and polished by generations of their medieval interpreters, the techniques and forms of such descriptions appeared eternally true and unshakable. The newer evidence * This paper is a reworked and supplemented chapter from a dissertation written at the Insti- tute of History of the USSR (Moscow) during 1982- 1986 in connection with the late Vladimir Terent'eviö Pasuto's project of editing a corpus of ancient and medieval sources on the history of the peoples of the USSR. The work benefited from the criticism it received from my col- leagues in the Institute of History, especially my teachers Dr. Elena Aleksandrovna Mel'nikova and Professor Jaroslav Nikolaeviö Söapov. They are, of course, not responsible for any shortcomings in the paper. 1 Of the works that have appeared in the last decades, see V. P.

CHEKIN needed to be fit into the established system of geographical ideas; this would not occur rapidly.2 The main purpose of this paper is to describe the system of traditional geographical data, which was applied to the description of the region of medieval Rus'. My sources are the available cartographic works of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries and the most significant narrative descrip- tions of the earth, which often are sections of medieval "encyclopedias." A few words need to be said about the period covered in this paper. The twelfth and thirteenth centuries were an important time in the development of Western European geographical literature. Active exploration of geo- graphical space, both in Western Europe (expansion of cultivated plots, improvements in communications) and beyond (the Crusades in the Middle East and in the Baltic lands, diplomatic and religious missions, growing trade), excited educated people's interest in geography. Lengthy geographi- cal works were written, containing every possible bit of data on countries and peoples inherited from antiquity and synthesizing later Roman knowledge and biblical geographical and cosmographie views. Among these works were the cartographic masterpieces of the Middle Ages - the Ebstorf and Hereford maps of the world. At the same time, the traditional description of the earth evolved gradually under the influence of new infor- mation: the thirteenth century witnessed a "geographical discovery" of medieval Rus' by Western Europeans.3 During this period there was one single "mainstream" geography developing in Western Europe. Yet regional schools can be identified - among them the "English" one, primarily noted for its more courageous treatment of new data and new practical experiences of Western European travelers.4 A number of works of this school were created by English authors on the continent; soon after publication they were used extensively in Western European universities and scientific centers, thus becoming an element in the pan-European book tradition.

Alpatov's thesis (Russkaja istoriéeskaja mysl' p. 21) that in the thirteenth century, because of the "feudal fragmentation of Rus' and the Tartar yoke," "the interest of Western scholars in Rus' seemed to decline rather than grow." A survey of our sources leads to the opposite conclusion: several outstanding geographical descriptions of the region that reflected the new information were made exactly in the thirteenth century (Gervase of Tilbury, Bartho- lomaeus Anglicus, Roger Bacon, and the Ebstorf and Hereford maps of the world). 4 Cf.

Although the Western European geographical literature of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries has been studied as a source of information for the history of Rus', researchers have given little attention to data that did not reflect the new realities of the time of the Crusades. Some interesting obser- vations can be found in Grégoire Lozinskij's integrated analysis of both cartographic and narrative sources,6 in articles by Ludwig Niederle and Jerzy Strzelczyk, in Leo Bagrow's book, which examined information about Rus' on world maps,7 and in similar works on the geography of neighboring regions.8 Several narrative geographical texts are presented in Vera I. Matuzova's publication.9 There is also a considerable body of litera- ture on the Eastern European material in individual sources that is almost exclusively devoted to the search for new data. Traditional data were never studied in their entirety: this predominant section of medieval knowledge was usually separated in the historical works like chaff from the wheat of genuine facts; in the process, however, the wheat was often mixed with the chaff, and vice versa. The goals of this paper differ from those of preceeding historiography. New data will be discussed only from the point of view of its interaction with traditional knowledge. The focus of research will be traditional data, the background against which Europeans absorbed new geographical and ethnographic information about medieval Rus'.

CHEKIN a detailed picture of the functioning of the system of traditional geographi- cal knowledge - a task that cannot be met if only examples from Rus' or Eastern Europe are used. 1. THE ORIGINS OF TRADITIONAL INFORMATION 1.1. The traditional data of medieval geography can be divided between "biblical" and "Graeco-Roman" - obviously a very arbitrary classification, for the two groups had already begun to interact during Patristic times. The Christian picture of the world came to be filled with fac- tual information borrowed from Greek and Roman philosophers and adapted to the new world outlook.10 Scholars of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries looked for this adapted version of the ancient geographical legacy primarily in the geographical introduction to the world chronicle, Historiae adversum paganos, by Paulus Orosius (bk. 1, chap. 2); in the encyclopedic treatise, Etymologiae, by Isi- dore of Seville, which contained sections describing peoples of the world (bk. 9), seas and rivers (bk. 13), and lands and mountains (bk. 14); and in Cosmographia by Aeticus Ister. Scholars also used geographical and ethno- graphic remarks contained in St. Jerome's Liber questionum Hebraicarum in Genesim (10.2), Contra Iovinianum (2.7), commentary on Ezekiel (38.2), and in a number of his letters (e.g., 122); in the Getica of Jordanes; and in various versions of Pseudocallisthenes. 1.2. Other sources of ancient geographical knowledge and ideas in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries included books of ancient Roman philoso- phers and poets, often quoted with as much reverence as the church writ- ers.11 The greatest authorities, at least before they were criticized by Roger Bacon, were Pliny, with his fundamental Historia Naturalis (Scythian materials were borrowed mainly from bks. 4 and 6, less often from bks. 5, 7, and 8), and C. Julius Solinus, the author of the encyclopedia of the wonders of the world, Collectanea rerum memorabilium. Pomponius Mela was probably known during the time of the Crusades only through Soli- 10 Concerning the early church writers' apprehension of ancient science and culture, see Robert M.

Curtius Rufus, the Historiae by Ammianus Marcellinus, and Justinus's Epitome of Pom- peius Trogus's Historiae. Geographers gave vent to their poetic inclinations by occasionally quoting Lucan's Pharsalia, Ovid's Metamorphoses and Epistolae ex Ponto, or the Consolatio Philosophiae of Boethius. 1.3. By the twelfth century direct ties with Greek literature were long lost.13 True, there was much translating of Arabic and Greek in Toledo and Palermo, which influenced the theoretical and methodological principles of Western European science.14 Yet, the new knowledge of Greek and Arabic works did not result in the adding of names of places and peoples to Western European nomenclature. The two outstanding geographies by Strabo and Claudius Ptolemy were at that time unknown in the West. The revival of Ptolemy later dramatically influenced the Western European image of Eastern Europe, and the new discoverers of sixteenth-century Rus- sia were often guided by Ptolemean data on Sarmatia. 1.4. Historians of cartography are still concerned with the degree to which early medieval geographers and map-makers drew on ancient cartog- raphy, in particular on the tradition of the lost "Map of Vipsanius Agrippa" of the first century A.D. According to Konrad Miller, who at the end of the last century undertook a fundamental study of medieval maps in order to reconstruct their alleged ancient prototypes, "the most authentic copy of the Roman map" is the Ebstorf map of the world. The maps preserved in medieval copies of works by Sallust, Lucan, and Macrobius were also inter- preted as remnants of the Roman authors' own cartographic activity.15 With very rare exceptions, ancient maps have not been preserved, so the above 12 Concerning Mela's lack of popularity, see Jerzy Strzelczyk, Gerwazy z Tilbury: Studium z dziejów uczonoSci geograficznej w Sredniowieczu (Wroclaw, 1970), pp. 79ff. 13 In our sources the usage of Greek is limited to words and phrases that were mentioned by St. Jerome, Martianus Capella, and Isidore of Seville.

CHEKIN and similar conclusions, when repeated in recent works on the history of ancient cartography, give rise to varying degrees of skepticism.16 If we limit ourselves to the study of the texts on the maps and leave aside the iconographie representations, traditional data on maps of the world (including the biggest wall maps, the Ebstorf and Hereford) might seem to have been drawn from the same later Roman and medieval sources to which authors of narrative geographical descriptions resorted. Most medieval maps are found in copies of narrative works, and in many, but not all, cases those narrative works appear to be the main sources of the maps' legends. The existence of a given tradition of manuscript illustration prior to the date of its earliest preserved examples is sometimes evident. Yet, it is difficult to determine whether prototypes of illustrative maps, like those of other illus- trations in early medieval manuscripts, can be attributed to the authors of the narrative texts (who may well have borrowed them from earlier sources) or to later scribes.17 Maps most frequently embellish copies of Sallust's Bellum Jugurthinum (chap. 3), the Commentary on Cicero's Somnium Sci- pionis by Macrobius (11.9), Beatus de Liebana's Commentaries in Apo- calypsim (Prologue and 1 1.4), Liber floridus by Lambertus of St. Omer, and Gautier of Chatillon's De Alexandri libri X. Maps are also found in copies of the Bible and the Psalter, in Lucan's Pharsalia, Juvenal's Satires, and in works by St. Jerome, Priscian, Isidore of Seville, and the Venerable Bede. 1.5. Ancient and early medieval authorities were inclined to borrow whole fragments of descriptions of the earth from their predecessors. Fur- thermore, the twelfth and thirteenth centuries saw the appearance of tradition-based, new authoritative works that provided sources of informa- tion to contemporaries. As a result, it is often impossible to determine the precise source of traditional data in an individual narrative or cartographic work. For example, Honorius Augustodunensis succinctly relates the materials of Paulus Orosius and Isidore of Seville in the geographical sec- tion of his De imagine mundi (1100). The anonymous author of the Old Spanish Semejança del mundo (1123) resorted to works by Isidore and Honorius, and Gervase of Tilbury (first quarter of the thirteenth century) resorted to Orosius, Isidore, and Honorius. Gossouin (1246) borrowed from Orosius, Honorius, and Gervase, while the author of the Ebstorf map 16 For details see A. V.

Authors of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries possessed a vast body of data borrowed, either directly or indirectly, from later ancient and early medieval literature. Drawing on this knowledge, they selected and organ- ized the material that was of use to them; medieval geographers thus used a "metalanguage" comprised of borrowings and quotations from the works of their predecessors. The present goal is to identify and classify structural units of this metalanguage. Attempts to systematize constant elements (invariants) of typologically similar texts have been made, for example, in the study of folklore. Similar methods have been applied to medieval geographical literature by Boris N. Zaxoder, who used "comparative textological analysis" of Arabic geographical works to single out "themes," or "pas- sages that were a complete narrative constantly repeated in different texts, in different combinations, and with different additions, omissions, and dis- tortions," and to build a "thematic compendium of data" on some Eastern European regions.18 A comparison of twelfth- and thirteenth-century Western European descriptions of the earth, with each other and with a vast number of similar ancient and early medieval works, identifies the "minimal fragments" of the text - i.e., those that were not further divided into parts by medieval authors. These constant fragments can be traced to one (or more) ancient authority who had borrowed such fragments from another authority without substantial distortion. Most of these constant elements of the geographical texts are extended definitions of traditional toponyms and ethnonyms ("The Albanians have blue pupils and can distinguish objects better at night than in daylight"). On maps of the world, such fragments may appear in succinct or abridged versions, or in an iconographie form, and it is often possible to reconstruct them unambiguously. It seems that individual toponyms and ethnonyms on these maps were perceived as belonging to a definite, implied fragment of a narrative text. Thus, we can represent the traditional informa- tion as a set of ancient text fragments, reproducible signs, which, when organized in various combinations, create medieval geographical texts. 18 Boris Nikolaeviõ Zaxoder, Kaspijskij svod svedenij o Vostoënoj Evrope, vol. 1, Gorgan i Povol2'evIX-X w.

The geographical literature of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries presents several methods of dividing the world and the ecumene developed by ancient science.19 Each of these methods left its mark on the character of geographical descriptions of Lower Scythia. 2.2. One of the more ancient cosmographie schemes, the "wind rose," divided the globe radially into twelve - sometimes four, eight, or twenty- four - segments. Each radius was assigned the name of a wind, as well as the names of people and regions. Certain moral qualities were ascribed to the winds (directions). The perception of the northeastern part of the ecu- mene was especially influenced by the words of the prophet according to Vulgate: "Ab Aquilone pandetur omne malum."20 The wind rose was described in medieval encyclopedias. The names of the winds, accompanied by their anthropomorphic representations, were sometimes written along the perimeters of maps of the world. In this con- nection, the toponymy of the ecumene' s northeast is referred to in the fol- lowing cases: first, in the versified list of the winds borrowed by Gervase of Tilbury from Ovid's Metamorphoses'?1 "And the blasts of blustering Boreas raigne In Scythia. . ."22 and, second, in the leonine hexameters of obscure origin, written along the perimeter of the Ebstorf map. It says of the northern winds Circius (NNW), Aquilo (N), and Septentrio (NNE): 19 Data on the division of the ecumene in ancient geography are given in accordance with Igor' Vasil'eviö P'jankov, Srednjaja Azija v antiënoj geografiëeskoj tradicii (lstoënikoved- ëeskij analiz): Avtoreferat dissertacii. . .doktora istoriëeskix nauk (Leningrad, 1984), pp. 11-20.

This is quoted, for example, in Vine. H16.16 in connection with the enumeration of peoples who crushed the Roman Empire. Cf. the reasoning in Bacon 2, p. 35, on the possibility of identifying the Tatars with Gog and Magog: "Atque gens Gothica et Vandalorum quae postea invasit meridiem sunt de finibus Aquilonis."

However, the understanding of the Ruteni of the Ebstorf map as Rus' has also been indicated in modern historiography.24 The association of Circius with the Ruteni of Aquitaine is justified, given the classical meaning of Circius as a NWW wind in Narbonne Gaul.25 Yet, in the Ebstorf map's hexameters, as on the other roses of the winds of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, Circius was understood as the NNW wind.26 This identification had been strengthened by Isidore of Seville and perhaps by Charles the Great, who developed the German rose of winds in which Circius was replaced by nordwestren (NNW) and Chorus by west- nordren (NWW).27 Furthermore, the Ruteni of Aquitaine are not shown on the map proper, while the word Rucia (Rus') is inscribed directly next to the radius denoted by Circius. Therefore, it is possible that the author of the Ebstorf map associated "the cultivated lands of Ruteni" with Rus' and perhaps also shared Gervase of Tilbury's and Bartholomaeus Anglicus's concept of the identity of the Aquitainian and Eastern European Rut(h)eni. Most of the toponyms and ethnonyms in other hexameters correspond to the map's data (all of these names are of ancient origin).28 Only the verse about the NNE wind Septentrio complaining of the Goths does not seem to match the implications of the map on which the Goths are shown in the northwest. This "misplacement" of the Goths in the hexameters is believed 23 "[Circius] effrenis flat per loca culta Rutenis. Sese Meotides stringent Aquilone paludes. Quos algore ferit Gotos Septentrio querit." (Miller 5, p. 10) 24 Namely, in a popular book by Leonid Arkad'eviò Goldenberg and Aleksei Vladimiroviö Postnikov, Petrovskie eeodezisty i pervyj peöatnyj plan Moskvy (Moscow, 1990), p. 9. 25 Cartographers of the Age of Discovery and of later times rather strictly understood Circius as the NNW wind; see, for example, maps from Philipo Bietio, Parallela Geographiae (Paris, 1648), reprinted in Lloyd Arnold Brown, The Story of Maps (Boston, 1950), p. 135; and Gre- gorius Reisch, Margarita philosophica (Fribourg, 1503), reprinted in Nils Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, Faksimile-Atlas to the Early History of Cartography (Stockholm, 1889), p. xxxi. 26 Cf. Hon. 1.55; Gerv. 1, pp. 889-90; Hereford map (52-3). Location of other winds may not coincide in these roses. In some contexts, borrowed from ancient authors, the name Circius may still be used in a more classical meaning; see Gerv. 1, p. 914 (Oros. 1.2): "Habet Nar- bonensis provincia a Circio Aquitaniam," Gerv. 1. p. 912 (Oros. 1.2). 27 Isid. 13.11.2-3; Einhard, Vita Caroli Magni, cited in Silvanus R.

Another ancient method divided the ecumene into several latitudi- nal zones. Ionian scholars seem to have believed in the existence of three belts: Scythia was located in the northern one, Ionia in the central one, and Egypt and Ethiopia in the southern belt. The counterposition of the Scythi- ans and the Ethiopians, advocated by Hesiod and Aeschylus,30 was prob- ably based on this scheme. Roger Bacon's words about different mores under different heavenly latitudes, as exemplified by the Scythians and the Ethiopians, may be compared, for instance, to the relevant section of Pliny's Historia Naturalis. Pliny counterposed the Ethiopians to the inhabi- tants of the north and all of these together to the moderate inhabitants of the middle section of the earth.31 Justinus and Orosius, who described the war between the Scythians and Egypt, were other possible sources for Bacon's reasoning.32 Justinus noted, among other things, that the Scythians and the Egyptians had had a prolonged dispute over who had the more ancient ori- gins (the Scythians proved to be more ancient).33 Justinus also wrote that the Scythians lived in a harsher climate; therefore, their bodies and minds were tougher than those of the Egyptians.34 2.4.

The order of Septentrio and Aquilo is reversed, in comparison to the one adopted by most twelfth- and thirteenth-century (and ancient) geographers; cf. Arentzen, pp. 161-62. In the Old English version of Orosius, however, Aquilo was interpreted as north and the translation for Boreas was northeast. See Janet M. Bately, "The Relationship between Geographical Information in the Old English Oro- sius and Latin Texts other than Orosius," Anglo-Saxon England, ed. Peter Clemoes, vol. 1 (Cambridge, 1972), p. 52 and fh. 5; the only exception is referred to in fh. 6. On the other hand, a late twelfth-century Norse source interpreted Latin Septentrio as northeast; see Lauritz Weibull, "De gamie nordbomas väderstrecksbegrepp," Scandia 1 (1928), reprinted in his Nor- disk historia, vol. 1 (Stockholm, 1948), p. 31. 30 P'jankov, Srednjaja Azija, p. 14; see also W. Aly, Volksmärchen, Sage und Novelle bei Herodot und seinen Zeitgenossen (Göttingen, 1921), p. 13. Other ancient authors who counter- posed Scythia and Egypt are listed by D. P. Kallistov, "Antiönaja literaturnaja tradicija o Sever- nom Pricernomor'e," Istoriëeskie zapiski 16 (1945): 189-90. The tradition of counterposing Scythia and Egypt also influenced Ovid's rose of the winds, quoted above, where the southern wind Auster who moistens "the opposite lands" is named after Boreas.

The teaching provided a founda- tion for the so-called zonal maps of the world, most of which illustrate copies of the Commentaries on Cicero's S omnium Scipionis by Macro- bius.36 Zonal maps are also included in Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae (26-10) and Lambert of St. Omer's Liber floridus (43.III). On these maps the border between the extreme northern zone, which was believed unin- habitable because of the cold, and the "moderate" northern zone, i.e., the ecumene, sometimes lies to the south of the Rhipaean Mountains (43. Ill) and crosses the Tanais (26-10). Macrobius did not locate any geographical objects in the uninhabited northern zone, although he believed that the borderline areas of the "moderate" zone were not well suited to settlement: "The [areas] that adjoin the borders of the cold zone such as the Maeotian Marshes and the countries in which the Tanais and the Ister flow, and all areas above Scythia whose inhabitants were called Hyperboreans in the ancient time it is not easy to explain, how immensly harsh the cold is there."37 2.5. According to yet another method of latitudinal division, which is based on astronomical principles, the ecumene is divided into seven or more "climates" or latitudes that are characterized by the duration of the longest day and the angle of the sun's inclination. Listing these climates in the astronomical section of his De imagine mundi, Honorius Augusto- dunensis mentions the Tanais, the Maeotian Marshes, and the area of the Sarmatians that lies in the eighth climate where the maximum duration of the day is sixteen hours. He also names the Hyperborean Mountains (seven- teen hours) and the Rhipaean Mountains (night and day last six months each) in additional climates. These notions can be traced to the Venerable Bede, who abridged Pliny's relevant section in light of what Martianus 35 See A. B. Ditmar and G. A.

CHEKIN Capella wrote.38 The Arab version of the theory of climates is illustrated by a rare variety of Western European maps of the world, namely, climatic maps. The nontraditional toponymy of Eastern Europe appears on a map in John of Wallingford's Chronicle (49-7) in the seventh climate ("the climate of the Francs") and, possibly, the sixth climate ("the climate of the Romans"). 2.6. In medieval geographical descriptions the ecumene was most often divided into Asia, Europe, and Africa, a method probably going back to the works of Ionian scholars of the fifth century B.c. Yet, the method fits well with Christian ethnogenetic theory: after the flood the world was divided among Noah's sons; Asia became Shem's domain, Europe Japheth's, and Africa Ham's (26-5). In ancient and medieval geography, the border between Europe and Asia was formed by the Tanais that flowed from the Rhipaean Mountains, or the system Tanais -Maeotian Marshes -Pontus. This border is shown on almost all - even the most schematic - medieval maps of the world, including all maps of the most representative group of tripartite ("ecumenical") maps. Their basic scheme - "T-O" - presents the ecumene as a circle whose upper half is occupied by Asia, the lower left- hand quarter is taken by Europe, and the lower right-hand quarter by Africa. While the ring of the ocean represents the letter "O" of the cartographic symbol, the borders between the parts of the ecumene, including the Tanais, form a semblance of the letter "T."39 The Tanais and, frequently, the Rhi- paean Mountains, the Maeotian Marshes, the Pontus, and other geographi- cal objects located near the border between Asia and Europe are usually mentioned in introductory notes to the narrative descriptions of the entire ecumene, of Europe and of Asia (see Table 1). 2.7. The general principles of composition of twelfth- and thirteenth- century descriptions of the earth also have their roots in the ancient geo- graphical tradition: data on the structure of the world is followed consecu- tively by information about Asia, Europe, Africa, and the Mediterranean islands (with some variation in this order). Sections on regional geography observe political-ethnic and administrative principles of division of the ecu- mene, as well as the orohydrographic principle adopted by later Greek and Roman geography.40 38 Plin. 6.219; Martianus Capella 8.876-77; Bede, De natura rerum 47; Hon. 2.22-23. 39 For details concerning the T-O symbol, see Brown, The Story of Maps, pp. 93, 103, 309. 40 Cf.

Information in Regional Sections 2.8. The traditional data presented by geographers in regional descrip- tions may be divided into several groups: toponyms and ethnonyms (single element units of the geographical metalanguage) and etymological, histori- cal, ethnographic, and natural science data (extended units of the metalanguage). 2.9. In the sources names of peoples and areas are interchangeable. The most frequent references in the descriptions of the ecumene's northeast are to Scythia and Scythians. According to Isidore of Seville, Scythia belonged in the distant past to the vast territory "from India to Germania, including the Maeotian Marshes." Vincent and Bacon continued, as the ancients had done, to refer to a single Scythia.41 Normally, the term "Scythia" in the regional sections required a specifying attribute: "Upper" ("Asian") or "Lower." The former begins at the Eastern Ocean, borders the Caucasus and India to the south, and stretches west to the Caspian Sea, or, according to other points of view, to the Maeotian Marshes.42 The latter is located between the Tanais and the Danube. In some cases each of the two Scythias even has a specific spelling (Esc(h)ocia and Ticia in the Old Spanish Semejança del mundo), which may either be due to a paléographie accident or to the desire to distinguish between the two areas orthographically.43 On maps the word Scythia often appears only once, with no obvious preference given to either Europe or Asia (Table 2). In addition to the Scythians proper, geographers know of various "Scythian" peoples whose names go back to the Herodotus nomenclature. In what is now Eastern Europe, there were the Scythian peoples Callipides and Neuri. The Alanians were also sometimes identified as Scythians. The toponym and ethnonym "Sarmatia/Sarmatians (Sauromatians)" are functionally close to "Scythia/Scythians." Evidence of this was supplied by Pliny (4.81): "The name of Scythians everywhere is transmuted into the names of Sarmatians and Germanians, so the ancient name is borne only by 41 Isid. 14.3.31; Vine. N32.6, HI. 66; Bacon 1, p. 374. 42 Concerning the borders of Upper Scythia, see Isid. 14.3.31; Rich. 3.2; Gerv. 1, p. 948, 2, pp. 756, 761-62; Bart. 15.113; Vine.

Cf. an Italian translation of Honorius Augustodunensis's De imagine mundi (in a fourteenth-century manuscript), where Lower Scythia is called Sitia la Minore, whereas Upper Scythia has the name Magathia, in accordance with Isidore's deriva- tion of the name Scythia from Magog, son of Japheth (see below, fh. 58), Magath in our source.

W. Kowalenko notes that in the Middle Ages Scythia and Sarma- tia were interchangeable "notions without fixed borders."44 Sources men- tion Sarmatians both in Europe and Asia, yet much less frequently than Scythians and Scythia. The ethnonym "Sarmatians" and the toponym "Sar- matia" became more popular after fifteenth-century Western Europe's rediscovery of Ptolemy's Geography.45 Medieval authors, following Isidore, sometimes used the word "Bar- baria" as a synonym for Lower Scythia. "Barbaria" invoked the semantics of the Scythian toponym and ethnonym that included the concept of savagery and barbarity.46 The division of Lower Scythia was based on the data provided by Orosius and Isidore, who distinguished three provinces, namely, Alania, Dacia, and Gothia (Table 3). Chronologically, traditional twelfth- and thirteenth-century ethnonyms were from the time of Herodotus to the Great Migration of Peoples. Roman names predominate (Table 4), in contrast to Upper Scythia whose ethnic map, compiled by ancient Greek and Hellenistic science, was inherited by medieval scholars without substantive additions. There is not much traditional topographical nomenclature. In addition to toponyms mentioned in relation to the border between Europe and Asia, descriptions of Lower Scythia include the Sarmatian Mountains.47 The names of the Borysthenes and Maeotis rivers were also preserved.48 The name of Chersonesos on the Ebstorf map (52-2) is not necessarily tradi- tional. This ancient Greek colony was not mentioned in the standard sources used by medieval geographers. True, it is marked on an eleventh- century map (in a copy of Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae [4-6]), which, in structure and content, is close to the Ebstorf map.49 Gervase of Tilbury (2, p. 764), the Hereford map (52-3), and the "St. Jerome" map (0-0) formally recognize the traditional origins of the hydro- nym Alarms that designated a river joining the Pontus. This may be the legendary river mentioned by Isidore of Seville to explain the etymology of 44 Kowalenko, "Baityk i Pomorze" (as in fh. 8), p. 356. 45 Cf. T.

The people that live near the river Lemannus are called Alemanni." Lemannus, which is also the name of a river in Lower Scythia on the Ebstorf map, is probably derived from Lacus Lemannus (Lake of Geneva). According to Ernest Sommer- brodt and Konrad Miller, it was transferred to the Ebstorf map from the above quotation.50 It is also marked on the "Isidore" map in an eleventh- century copy of his Etymologiae (4-6). Miller's comparisons show that the Rivers Alanus and Lemannus may be identical in thirteenth-century descriptions of Lower Scythia.51 2.10. In medieval geographical works many toponyms and ethnonyms are accompanied by their "etymological" interpretations (or quasi- etymological, from today's standpoint), as in the above passage about the Alanians and Alemanians. Traditions of etymologizing have their roots in antiquity. Etymologizing became a universal method of cognition in the Middle Ages, a "form of thinking," in E. R. Curtius's words, that went far beyond purely linguistic research. It showed the "origin" and "force" of things. It is therefore no accident that the most significant encyclopedic work of the early Middle Ages was entitled Etymologiae.52 This work of Isidore of Seville was a source for the etymological data used to describe Scythia. Isidore derived the name of the Rhipaean Moun- tains from Greek, riphe (rush) (following Servius's scholias to Georgicae). This etymology was reproduced by Gervase of Tilbury, the anonymous author of the Old Spanish Semejança del mundo, Bartolomaeus Anglicus, and Vincent of Beauvais, all of whom, probably, applied it to different "Rhipaean Mountains" that, like the two Scythias, were divided into moun- tains in Germania and mountains in the upper reaches of the Tanais.53 The 50 Isid. 9.2.94; Ernest Sommerbrodt, Die Ebstorf er Weltkarte (Hannover, 1891), p. 45; Miller 5, p. 25. 51 Miller 4, p. 17; 5, p. 25. 52 E. R. Curtius, Europäische Literatur und lateinisches Mittelalter (Bern, 1948), pp. 448-92. 53 Isidore placed them where Germany began (Isid. 14.8.8, the same in Vine. N6.21, HI. 86); he also knew of Rhipaean forests in the upper reaches of the Tanais (Isid. 13.21.24). Gervase mentioned the etymology when speaking of the Rhipaean Mountains from which the Tanais flows (Gerv. 2, p. 763). Bartholomaeus used it in his account of the mountains in Germany, which, in the 1483 edition (Nuremberg) bears the title De alpibus, and where the form Cifei is used (Bart. 14.32), while the mountains in the upper reaches of the Tanais are Rifei (cf. Table 1). Other editions (e.g., Strasbourg, 1505) may contain the form Riphei in both cases and the title of Bart. 14.32 as De Ripheis montibus sive alpibus. In the Old Spanish Semejança del mundo the mountains in the Upper Tanais are named both Cephey (Ceferin) and Rrifey, and Germany's mountains are Rrifey (SM A81, B79, 184, 318).</page><page sequence="16">304 LEONID S. CHEKIN etymologizing of the Tanais River from the Scythian king Tanus,54 Scythia and Gotia from Magog, son of Japheth,55 and the Sarmatians from their "love of arms"56 became commonplace. The same models were used to create new etymologies. Vincent of Beauvais assumed that the name of the Mongols was derived from Mosoch (Meshech),57 Hungaria from the Huns (see below), and so on. 2.11. Standard attributes of toponyms and ethnonyms can contain histor- ical information. In addition to the etymology of their name, it was said of the Sarmatians that they "rode with arms in the steppes until Lentulus drove them away from the Danube."58 Descriptions of Eastern Europe speak at length of events relating to the penetration of Pannonia by the Huns. Jor- danes was the main early medieval source: a fragment of his Getica on the Huns' march across the Maeotian Marshes, narrated by an unknown intermediary, is reproduced almost identically by both Bartholomaeus Anglicus and Vincent of Beauvais.59 The Huns lived in Great Pannonia, which was located in remote Syria (both authors use this name, presumably, instead of Scythia), beyond the Maeotian Marshes. In search of other hunt- ing grounds, they moved, following the tracks of deer and other animals, to Minor Pannonia, which later came to be called, in the vernacular, [HJungaria. The historical part of Vincent's encyclopedia gives a more detailed account of these, as well as of preceding and subsequent, events in the history of the Huns and Goths. This account is closer to Jordanes's ver- sion, and Orosius's material is also used.60 54 Isid. 13.21.24; Hon. 3.2; Gerv. 2, pp. 763-64; SM A81, B84; Vine.

They had lived in remote Maeotide, between the icy Tanais and the ferocious tribes of Massagetes. Then on their quick-footed horses they broke across the Caucasian rocks where Alexander had blocked savage peoples. . . ."61 Hence the inscription on the Ebstorf map, in the North Black Sea area, that recorded a stage of this route: "the Avari, i.e., Huni, had lived here." Moreover, the map mentions the Huns, and the Huni-Avari, in two legends inscribed in the territory of Pannonia, which is, incidentally, defined as "Lower which is now Ungaria."62 Although the identification of the Hungarians with the Huns was not generally accepted (they were distinguished in the anonymous Descrip- tiones terrarum, between 1255 and 1260),63 it was recognized by many geographers.64 Relying on Jordanes, Isidore, and data from William of Rubruquis's travel account, Roger Bacon wrote that the Huns, later called Hungri and now Hungarians, came from the land of Pascatir (Bashkir), i.e., Great Hungary. "Having taken with them Bulgars and other peoples, they, according to Isidore, broke open Alexander's Gates."65 The legend Hungari on the Hereford map (52-3), there placed to the east of the Sarmatians and to the south of Norway, near the northeastern border of Lower Scythia, does not necessarily point to later events than those recorded in the works by Jordanes and Isidore. Rather, it is synonymous with the legend Huni, for example, on Lambert of St. Omer's map of Europe (43.X-1). 2.12. Vincent of Beauvais provided ethnographic descriptions of some peoples of Scythia, following St. Jerome who cited examples of their pecu- liar tastes and behavior: the Sarmatians, Quadi, Vandals, and innumerable other tribes eat horse meat and fox meat; the Nomads, Troglodytes, Scythi- 61 Isid. 9.2.66. 62 Miller 5, pp. 17,24. 03 Jerzy Strzelczyk, "Opis krajów: Nowe zródlo do dziejów wieków srednich i chrystianizacji ludów nadbaityckich," Zycie i myél 36, no. 3/4 (1988): 62, 67, fh. 8. 64 On the origins of this identification, see Richard C.

Some data on natural conditions are provided for remote northern areas of the ecumene. The land of Pterophoron, beyond the Rhipaean Mountains, invokes references to eternal cold.69 On the other hand, a mild climate, fruit-bearing trees, and life-giving air are characteristics of the region of Hyperboreans, who live near the world pole.70 A bear pictured in the land of the Sarmatians on the Hereford map is reminiscent of the famous motif of the "Russian bear," which first became popular in Shakespearean England (cf. Macbeth 3.4.100 and Henry V 3.7. 139).71 There were attempts to trace the roots of this stereotype to anti- quity (Greek, arktos, means both "bear" and "north"; the semantics of both "bear" and "north" in early Christian tradition included the idea of evil),72 but the Hereford map was never recognized as the possible English "miss- ing link" in the development of the motif.73 C.

Some of the names related to human geography (names of peoples, regions, cities) do not reflect the real geographical situation in the period under review, yet to a varying degree they are correct for certain periods of antiquity and the early Middle Ages. We can, with a degree of precision, single out from medieval descriptions of the earth data concerning the geo- graphical and political reality of the time of Herodotus and Alexander the Great, the first and fourth centuries A.D. and the era of the Great Migration of Peoples. We often come across twelfth- and thirteenth-century data that do not match the reality of contemporaneous authors, even in their eyes. Although the Pharos lighthouse had been destroyed long ago, it was still marked on map 52-2. According to narrative sources, the Amazons owned the Themiscyrian fields only for some time in the distant past, yet map 0-0 placed them in the Themiscerii campl. Migrating peoples had long left the Maeotian Marshes, and those who had been destined to rush toward Rome had already done so. Yet they remain in their erstwhile places on the maps.74 According to a definition by Cresques Abraham, author of the Catalan Atlas, mapamundi is an image "of the various ages of the world":75 the circle of the earth was regarded as the arena of world history, and the "world chronicle" was projected onto its plane. The space of the medieval map of the world, of the medieval description of the earth, was not synchro- nous, as is the space of today's maps - even that of historical maps. The medieval map is outside time or, rather, of all time.76 2.17. Finally, there are a number of legends that are incorrect from today's standpoint, and which were repudiated by medieval geographers as new knowledge about the ecumene was accumulated. There were many and varied reasons for the appearance of geographical legends, but, generally speaking, their propagation and stability in the Middle Ages is attributed to a shortage of empirical knowledge and the rule of religious-symbolic think- ing.77 74 However, the time distance is on some occasions indicated, even on maps: "Hie olim terra hunorum fuit" (52-2); "Gotia unde Goti" (17-9). 75 Georges Grosjean, ed., Mapamundi: The Catalan Atlas of the Year 1375 (Dietikon and Zurich, 1978), p. 40. 76 See Anna-Dorothee von den Brincken, "Mappa mundi und Chronographia: Studien zur 'Imago mundi' des abendländischen Mittelalters," Deutsches Archiv ßr Erforschung des Mit- telalters 24 (1968): 1 18-86. 77 See Jelena A.

CHEKIN Legends about parapeoples and monsters were the preferred subjects for drawings on maps. They occupy a prominent place in regional descriptions, especially in those dealing with remote areas of the ecumene. Some creatures were classified by a thirteenth-century natural scientist as occupy- ing a position between people and animals:78 Hippopods (people with horses' legs), Panotii (Fanesii) (people with enormous ears that they wrap around themselves), the Cynocephali (dog-headed people), for example.79 The legend about Gog and Magog, the Inclosed Nations, and Alexander's Gate came from the region of the Caspian "Gulf but certainly had an impact on the ecumene's whole northern rim. Three motifs of the legend - the peoples of Gog and Magog as helpers of the Antichrist, the gates built by Alexander the Great to protect the civilized world from onslaughts of barbarians (let us recall that Huns-Hungarians broke through those gates), and the ten lost tribes of Israel - can be found in descriptions of the earth. The development of each motif and the time and place of its combination with the others are topical questions of the history of culture.80 Medieval classifiers, like the author of the Hereford map (52-3) could place the Inclosed Nations as an ethnical phenomenon on the same footing with other parapeoples, but the idea of the legend goes far beyond the limits of ethnography. Roger Bacon (1, p. 365), for instance, saw the value of the science of geography in its ability to determine from where and when Gog and Magog would bring the downfall of the world. Over the centuries the legend illustrated the apocalyptic concept of Christian historiography. New barbaric peoples appearing on the borders of the ecumene made their existence known primarily through violence and plunder. This peculiar nature of the "ethnographic discoveries" of later antiquity and the Middle Ages is demonstrated in the development of the legend's diverse versions, both in Christian and Islamic literature. For example, our sources reflect the discussions in later antiquity of the possibility of identifying Gog and Magog with the Goths,81 the early medieval theory of the origins of Turks 78 Thomas Cantimpratensis, Liber de natura rerum (Berlin and New York, 1973), pp. 95-97 (3.1). 79 See John Block Friedman, The Monstrous Races in Medieval Art and Thought (Cam- bridge, Mass., 1981); Claude Lecouteux, Les monstres dans la littérature allemande du moyen age, 3 vols.

The distinction between legen- dary and factual data is a modern introduction and reflects our understand- ing of the further road traversed by geography since the Middle Ages.84 3. DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM A. Variance 3.1. The conservative treatment of information by narrative geographi- cal texts and maps and their dependence on works by previous authorities did not exclude original organization of the old material, or intentional or unintentional modification of its lexical, grammatical, syntactic, and icono- graphie forms. For example, if we compare variants of the phrase about the Albanians who see better at night than in daylight in the three most influential ancient texts and in three medieval texts, there are no two that are completely identical (to say nothing of the iconographie form of the same invariant in a cartographic source).85 3.2. The formal transmutation of ancient toponyms in some cases represents a "self-reliant" form of development of the system of traditional data - i.e., development through variance rather than through interaction with alien elements.86 We have noted above (2.9 and 2.17, fn. 84) such phenomena as the splitting of the etymon - i.e., the formation of two ortho- graphically different toponyms, as was the case with the two Scythias in Semejança del mundo - and, conversely, the formal convergence of two names, as was the case with the ethnonym Gog, which was transformed into Goth in the same text. It is not very important for the functioning of the sys- tem whether such transformations are the author's intent or occur as pp. 9-12, and Hans Andersson, "Gothus, Gog och Magog," Scandia 19 (1963): 155-56. 82 Aet. 3.32: Ebstorf maü Í52-2). see Miller 5. o. 26. 83 Cf.

In the final analysis, the instability and mobil- ity of some toponyms known to the medieval geographer from the ancient book tradition are due to the semantic paucity of those toponyms.87 3.3. Traditional geographical information about remote areas of the ecumene is rather freely distributed on the maps. It might be said that we are dealing with "errant" names and characteristics. The location of objects on the maps constantly and inevitably shifts within a larger region (e.g., Lower Scythia): the methods used in map making did not make it possible to "tie" a geographical object consistently to one location or to determine the latter with a sufficient degree of precision (probably not the cartogra- phers' main purpose). Traditional data can even move from one region to another. To take one characteristic example, Cynocephali were marked in Ethiopia and India, Lower and Upper Scythia,88 i.e., in almost all inaccessi- ble areas of the ecumene. 3.4. Standard ethnographic descriptions "wandered" from one people to another. These data may have had a certain empirical base in antiquity, but creditable ethnographic facts became "errant" legends in a long process of literary reworking and generalization. Two main types of standard descriptions of peoples can be identified. The first shows a noble barbarian: selfless, moderate, peace-loving, possessing lofty moral qualities and good health; this idealization of the noble barbarian may mask the ancient author's polemics about "corrupted civilization."89 The second type encom- passes such ethnic traits as cruelty, bloodthirstiness, foolishness (ignorance), the habit of eating raw and unclean food, including human flesh and blood. N. S. Sirokova has observed that "a reserved, and some- times even hostile attitude toward barbarians is the same idealization, only with a minus sign."90 Peoples "swap" characteristics within each of the two types. The Hereford map (52-3) assigns to the "worthless" people of Griphe an attribute that Solinus had applied to the Geloni: "[they] make clothes for themselves and their horses from the skin of their enemies." The map 87 Cf.

Incidentally, Pliny and Solinus, who applied this characteris- tic to the Arumphaei, stressed the two peoples' similarities.92 Both types of standard characteristics - the "positive" (following Justinus) and the "nega- tive" (borrowed from Solinus) - were applied to the Scythians in medieval descriptions of the earth.93 3.5. Numerical designations for the numbers of peoples also "migrate" from one area to another. For example, the number of peoples in the Scythian-Hyrcanian region could be "24," "42," "43," "44," and "54";94 "24" also characterizes the number of peoples in Egypt,95 Albania, and Amazonia,96 and "44" the number in India.97 3.6. Remoteness was sufficient cause for generalizations about peoples and regions, for exchange of data between different areas of the ecumene. This "interregional" exchange was subordinate to its own laws. First, geo- graphical data "migrated" more often within the limits of two neighboring areas; for example, Scythia and India seemed to merge into a single "Orien- tal land." Descriptions of Lower Scythia were influenced by its proximity to Germany. Hence, the elk and the aurochs, which Pliny and Solinus located in the Hercynian Forest,98 appear in the territory of Rus' (52-2); Isidore's mysterious "Germanian" rivers of Alanus and Lemannus, were directed by twelfth- and thirteenth-century geographers toward the Black Sea. Scythia and Egypt, two areas at the opposite borders of the ecumene, are also linked to one another. This link, which was based on the tradition of climatic and ethnographic comparisons (see above, 2.3), was solidified by the composi- tion of the geographical descriptions of Orosius and Honorius Augusto- dunensis, where Egypt is followed almost immediately by Scythia. 91 Cf. Sol. 15.3. According to Miller 4, p. 17, the fact that on map 0-0 Geloni are in the same place in Asian Scythia as Griphe on map 52-2 also confirms the indiscernibility of these peo- ples in medieval cartography. 92 Plin. 6.35; Sol. 17.1-2; Bacon 1, p. 359. 93 See above, m. 68. 94 "24": Rud. p. 765; "42": often in copies of Oros. 1.2; "43": Gerv. 2, p. 762; Oliver Herbert Phelps Prior, ed., L'Image du Monde de Maître Gossouin, réd. en prose (Lausanne and Paris, 1913), 2.2.FH; "44": Hon. 1.18, SM A48, B46; Bart. 15.74; Ebstorf map (52-2); "54": Chiovaro, L'Ymagine des mondo (m. 47), chap. 22 (p. 113). 95 Hon. 1.17; Rud. p. 700. 96 Gerv. 2, pp. 761-62 (with a variant: "34," as in Oros. 1 .2). 97 Hon. 1.10. 98 Plin. 8.38-39; Sol. 20.4-6 (identified in Miller 5, p. 25).</page><page sequence="24">312 LEONID S. CHEKIN Second, migration of traditional data from one region to another may be due to toponymie consonance. Thus, the wonders of the Hercynian Forest migrated from Germania to Hyrcania" (the root causes of this transforma- tion are related to the fact that Germania lost its status as a remote area of the ecumene). Some descriptions of the earth transplanted Scythopolis from Palestine to Scythia.100 Finally, distant migrations of geographical objects may be due to features of the source manuscripts used by medieval authors (e.g., the absence of paragraphs) and other purely "technical," accidental reasons. Vincent of Beauvais placed the Caucasus on the island of Tylos because the phrases about the Caucasus and the island were placed next to each other in the ancient source.101 When Brunetto Latini wrote about the Scythian islands in the "Dead Sea," he hardly meant the Crimea and the Sea of Azov (contrary to what his modern commentator assumed). The point is that the ancient source, which was characterized by inconsistency, placed the story of the Pontian islands of the Apollonites and Achilles next to a description of the Northern Ocean.102 In the natural history section of his encyclopedia, Brunetto placed the Hyperborean Mountains in Greece, having read per- functorily the section of Isidore of Seville's Etymologiae that recounts the well-known story about swans in the Hyperborean Mountains and compares Latin and Greek names of the swan in the next phrase.103 A similar "techni- cal" error probably gave birth to such curiosities as "the Hyperborean Mountains" on an island in the Black Sea (the Ebstorf map) or a picture of an ostrich in the North Black Sea region (the Hereford map).104 3.7. It should be stressed that all cases of unusual localization require a thorough analysis of the sources, for they may reflect a special ancient tra- dition followed only by individual medieval maps and narrative texts or particular groups of maps. Some maps in copies of Sallust's Bellum 99 See Christian Hünemörder, "Hercyniae aves," Rheinisches Museum für Philologie 110 (1967): 371 -84. 100 Rich. 3.8: maps 49-8r?l: 52-2r?l. 101 Sol. 52.50; Vine.

William La- tham Bevan and H. W. Phillott, Medieval Cartography: An Essay in Illustration of the Here- ford Mappa Mundi (London and Hereford, 1873), p. 139, pointed to another fragment of Aeticus' s Cosmographia, to the description of the ostrich proper, which Aeticus believed to be found in the mountains of Armenia. On the Hereford map the ostrich is placed near the Arfaxat River, the name of which can be interpreted as a derivative from Araxes.</page><page sequence="25">LOWER SCYTHIA 313 Jugurthinum and Gauthier of Chatillon's De Alexandri libri X show Armenians, Persians, and Medians in Africa, which corresponds to Sallust's description of the fortunes of Hercules' warriors.105 The presence of the Maeotis and Jaxartes rivers in the location of the Tanais, and a strange pic- ture of the Maeotian Marshes as several small round lakes linked by chan- nels seem to be echoes of ancient Ionian notions106 in the Hereford map's geographical concept. B. Interaction with New Data 3.8. Traditional information is often found side by side with new infor- mation without any critical comparison given. This approach of medieval geographers was determined not only by their "uncritical" attitude toward authoritative ancient sources but also by the religious-symbolic meaning of traditional geographical description, in particular its objective of showing the arena of historical events, "loca in quibus gestae sunt."107 At times a traditional description of a region is completely duplicated by a new one, though the two do not come into direct contact with one another; cf. the dis- tribution of Eastern European regions, cities, and rivers on the Ebstorf map: Scithia inferior, Dacia, Gotia, Teodosio, Lemanus, etc. in the east; Rucia with Kiwen (Kiev), Novgardus (Novgorod), Plosceke (Polotsk), Smalentike (Smolensk), Olchis qui et Wolkans (Volkhov?), Duna (Dvina) in the west. 3.9. The preservation of traditional information can be attributed to its importance for composition. Thus, for Gervase of Tilbury, information about Lower Scythia and its division seems to have only a formal function, i.e., merely to signal the beginning of a description of a new part of the world - Europe. In the same chapter Gervase repeatedly returns to Eastern Europe. Enumerating provinces and peoples, he "arrives" in Rus' from the northwest and southwest, without once mentioning either Lower Scythia or its provinces. Yet, at the end of his description of the earth, in a short con- cluding list of the ecumene's regions, where he mentions in particular Rus' and Poland, Gervase makes it a point to allude once more to Lower Scythia as Europe's first region.108 3.10. Traditional terms may be a kind of landmark to which previously unknown areas of Eastern and Northern Europe are tied. Bartholomaeus 105 Maps 12-15; 29-13; 49-17; cf. Sallust, lugurt. 18.3-4; see Arentzen, pp. 99-100. The same fragment of Bellum Jugurtinum is quoted by Bacon 1, p. 316. 100 Concerning these notions, see I. V.

CHEKIN Anglicus refers to Lectonia, Livonia, Sambia, and Sweden as provinces of Lower Scythia. Rivalia borders Lower Scythia, and Zealand is situated to the west of Upper (?) Scythia.109 On maps 25-3 and 52-3, Rus' is included in Lower Scythia, replacing a component of the formula "Dacia, where also Gothia" - "Dacia (here) and Rus(s)ia." The idea of marginality, remoteness, and barbarity that antiquity associ- ated with Scythians and Scythia was passed on to the Slavs and "Sclavonia" (paganism being the substitute for barbarity),110 together with some tradi- tional contexts (see 2.3 above). This "Scythian legacy" contains an ines- capable comparison with the southern rim of the ecumene. According to Brunetto Latini, the Ethiopians and the inhabitants of "Esclavonia" lived according to "beastly laws."111 By contrast, Bartholomaeus emphasized the difference between Sclavia and the regions inhabited by the Ethiopians: they lie in different climates, so the influence of the planets is different.112 Some monuments of the French epos did not distinguish the Slavs from the Muslims (i.e., Muslim slaves); in particular, Renand de Montauban calls the Egyptian king Safadin a Slav (F Esclavón). m The closeness in meaning of "Pagan" and "Muslim" for medieval Western authors,114 or the presence of the Slavs in Muslim regions,115 also contributed to the stable literary 109 Bart. 15.87, 88, 126, 134, 153, 174. 110 Cf.

Bartholomaeus referred in the same paragraph to Mis(ch)alath philosophus (elsewhere Miselat astrologus), probably Mäsa'alläh ibn Atharï al-Basrï, who wrote ca. a.D. 770.

The differences, both physical and moral, between Ethiopians and northern peoples (populus Dacus et Sclavorum), were noted also by Albert the Great, who was following pseudo- Aristotle' s De causis proprietatum et elemen- torum, a ninth-century Arabic book translated into Latin by Gerard of Cremona: Alb. 2.3, pp. 26-27, cf. pp. 57-58 of the same volume of Albert's works. 113 N.

Slavs were not the only "successors" of the Scythians. Due to ortho- graphic similarity between some forms of the names of Scythia and Scotland, the latter could be derived from the former. The legend of the Egyptian extraction of the Scots possibly represents the development of the same etymological idea.116 3.11. The "errant" traditional characteristics were passed on to peoples that became known to the medieval author from contemporary sources. This migration of legendary information may account for the description of the people of Perossites, identified as a Finnish tribe in the region of Vyatka and Perm. Mixail P. Alekseev views John of Plano Carpini' s story about the Perossites feeding on the steam of broth (this story is included in the histori- cal section of Vincent of Beauvais's encyclopedia) as a "modification of a legend about the peoples of the East. ... It is difficult to decide, however, whether the story was recounted to him in this form by Mongols who described their campaigns or whether it came to be associated in the author's mind with memories of works by classical authors." It should be born in mind, observes Alekseev, that the classical authors and the Mongols could have had common Indian and Persian informers.117 There can be no doubt that sometimes the transfer of traditional characteristics to new peo- ples was based on real features of their cultures and regions. 3.12. Medieval authors use two types of interaction when consciously comparing new and traditional data. The first type uses traditional data to verify new knowledge (e.g., Gervase of Tilbury supports information about Rus' - "Rutheni" with a line from Lucan about Rutens of Aquitaine). The croisés français eurent l'occasion de rencontrer des Russes sans se rendre compte s'ils étaient amis ou ennemis, chrétiens ou païens. . ."; cf. p. 256. Lozinskij also pointed to the presence in the Holy Land of placenames resembling the name of Rus'. He saw this, in particular, as the reason for the odd image of Russia in Bartholomaeus Anglicus's encyclopedia (ibid., p. 257). 116 See the Pictish Chronicle of the tenth century, which bound the name of Scotti to both Scythia and Egypt: "Scotti qui mine corrupte vocantur Hibernienses quasi Sciti, quia a Scithia regione venerunt, et inde originem duxerunt, siue a Scotta filia Pharaonis régis Egypti, que fuit ut fertur regina Scottorum." Isidore's description of Asian Scythia was used as a geographical introduction to this chronicle (William F. Skene, ed., Chronicles of the Picts, Chronicles of the Scots, and Other Early Memorials of Scottish History [Edinburgh, 1867], pp. 3 -4). Cf. a story of Scythian noble families migrating first to Egypt, then to Spain, and finally to Britain: Lamb. 68v/138; Rene Derolez, "British and English History in the Liber Floridus," in Albert Derolez, ed., Liber Floridus Colloquium (Ghent, 1973), pp. 59-70.

CHEKIN second type appeals to new data to verify traditional information (Bacon refutes Pliny and other classics by referring to the experience of travelers to Mongolia).118 Interaction of the first type often resulted in the transcoding of traditional texts, the filling of traditional form with new contents, as is the case with the Rut(h)eni. The ratio of the two types of interaction in descrip- tions of the earth is determined by the degree of development of argumenta- tion within medieval geography, which, until the thirteenth century, was usually content to cite ancient authorities; in the thirteenth century, geogra- phers often drew on "experimental" proof and references to observations made by witnesses.119 3.13. A typical medieval toponymie transformation is "archaization," i.e., putting a new toponym in a traditional orthographic shell belonging to an outdated term that no longer reflects the new geographical and ethnic reality. This was observed by historians on numerous occasions, particu- larly with regard to the Byzantine literary tradition.120 3.14. In many cases a remote phonetic similarity (and, possibly, secon- dary ethnogenetic legends) was enough for a geographer to consolidate ties between a medieval reality and an outdated toponym or ethnonym.121 Yet, it is tempting to assume that medieval authors had additional reasons for per- sistently using a definite ancient name for a contemporaneous people or place. For example, if the name Rus' really has some kind of genetic rela- tion to the name of the ancient Aquitainian tribe of Ruteni,122 we can hardly 118 Gerv. 2, p. 765; Bacon 1, p. 354, and pp. 305, 365-66. 119 More details are provided in L.

V. Nazarenko, "Ob imeni 'Rus' ' v nemeckix istoènikax IX -XI vv.," Voprosy jazyko- znanija, 1980, no. 5, pp. 46-57, traces medieval German forms of the name Rus' and its derivatives back to the ethnonym (?) *Rut(j) which existed in Old High German (southern dialects?) before the completion of the second High German consonantic shift and after com- pletion of the West Germanic gemination, i.e., ca. fifth to sixth centuries. Omeljan Pritsak used this and other data to support the "Rutenian" etymology of Rus' (which had been proposed in the past, with weaker arguments) in his, "The Origin of the Name Rus/Rus'," in C.

The same is true of another scholarly name for Rus', Galatia, which Bartholomaeus Anglicus confuses with Galatia in Asia Minor. Although attempts to find the basis for such geographical names as Galich (Halyö) and (East European) Galicia in the reality of Celtic migrations are rather hypothetical,124 one cannot but note the ancient references to Galatae and Galatia in the North Black Sea region collected by Peter I. Koppen.125 Yet, these and similar notions are insufficient to doubt the presence of "archaization" proper, the formal identification of Rus' with the Rutens of Aquitaine or Galatians of Asia Minor in medieval geographical literature. Toponyms and ethnonyms could have become integrated in the tradition, thanks to a set of reasons that did not contradict one another. Therefore, the idea of one of the forms of the ethnonym Rus', Rugi, resulting from the velarization characteristic of the Ripuarian Frankish dialect,126 does not necessarily contradict the theory that it was integrated in literature under the influence of ancient Rugi121 and possibly Rogi of Jordan.128 It should be stressed that the medieval tradition did not entirely forget the original mean- ing of the ancient ethnonym Rugi.

CHEKIN tury and Albert the Great in the thirteenth century both mentioned ancient Rugi.129 The Rut(h)eni of Aquitaine were also well known, judging from the example of Lambert's correction of the ethnonyms "rup- treni. . . anntequini" to "rutheni. . . aquitani"130 (they are on the list of Asian peoples as a result of a not-so-valid conversion of pseudo-Aeticus's four- part division of the ecumene into a three-part division by Lambert). 3.15. In unclear contexts, especially on maps of the world, it is difficult to distinguish between outdated traditional information and "archaized" toponyms and ethnonyms. There is the possibility of an alternate solution. Let us consider the formula (mentioned in 3.10) "Dacia (here) and Rus(s)ia."131 In spite of our preference for a purely literary origin of the first component, we cannot rule out the possibility that it reflects, for example, the presence of Danes in Kiev in the eleventh century132 or that it speaks of Denmark and the island of Rügen (cf. Herbord's phrase "Ruthenia vero Danos adiunctos habet").133 Already the original formula, "Dacia (here) and Gotia" could point both to the outdated ancient reality and to the lands of Scandinavia with phonetically similar names.134 A similarly vague transfor- mation of the same formula appeared in work of the French poet Pierre de Beauvais (or, probably, in a copyist's version of his poem Mappemonde): "Alanie siet droit illec, Escoce et Danemarche avec." The phrase is based 129 Maps 43.1; 43.X- 1 (the text below the map); Cosm. 1.26, p. 84; Alb. 3.2, p. 35. 130 Map 43.1; cf. Cosm. 1.13, p. 77; Alb. 3.1, p. 32. 131 Dascia et Russia (25-3); Dacia. Hec et Rusia (52-3). The first component was interpreted as Dacia proper by Bevan and Phillott, Medieval Cartography (fh. 108), p. 137. They con- trasted this formula to Dacia et Gotia on the Anglo-Saxon map (24-6), where, perhaps, Den- mark was meant. The interpretation of Dacia/Dascia as Denmark on maps 25-3 and 52-3 was also proposed in the literature, but without any argumentation; see von den Brincken, "Mappa mundi und Chronographia" (fh. 76), p. 170; David Woodward, "Mappae mundi," J. B. Harley and D. Woodward, eds., The History of Cartography, vol. 1 (Chicago and London, 1987), p. 328. The reading of the text on the map as Dacja sive Russia which resulted in the idea about the Rus' origin of Peter the Dane, Silesian palatine and general of the Polish king Boleslaw in the Wry-Mouthed, is obviously a mistake (see Marek Cetwiñski, "Piotr Wlostowicz czy Piotr Rusin?" Sobótka, 1974, no. 4, p. 432). 132 This fact is discussed in Alexander V. Riazanovski, '"Runaway Slaves' and 'Swift Danes' in Eleventh-Century Kiev," Speculum 39 (1964): 288-97. 133 For an analysis of this evidence, see N. S. Truxaèev, "Popytka lokalizacii Pribaltijskoj Rusi na osnovanii soobSõenij sovremennikov v zapadnoevropejskix i arabskix istocnikax X-Xm vv.," in Drevneßie gosudarstva na territorii SSSR, 1980 (Moscow, 1981), pp. 159-85; cf. Liman, "'Graecia,' 'Latinum,' 'Campania,' 'Ruthenia'. . . ," p. 414. 134 Cf. Alb. 3.7, pp. 40-41 , where pseudo-Aeticus's text about the division of Lower Scythia (Cosm. 2.21) is retold with the following (here italicized) additions: "Hinc ab oriente Alania, Ruthenia, Prutenia, Livonia est.

Escoce in place of Gotia may mean either Scythia (also referred to several verses earlier as Siehe) or Scotland.135 The identification of the Alanus and Lemannus rivers mentioned by Isi- dore as purely etymological reconstructs and included by medieval geogra- phers in the system of traditional data on Lower Scythia (see above, 2.9) is equally uncertain. It is quite probable that in the period under review these hydronyms reflected some local realities. The Lemannus which flowed into the Black Sea near the city of Chersonesos (map 4-6; cf. 52-2) may be related to the Greek limen, Middle Greek limeñas, Turkic liman, etc.136 Thus, it may represent either the estuary of the Dnieper (and that of the Southern Bug) or the Dnieper proper, named after its estuary - cf. the Ukrainian duma, "Samijlo KiSka," where "Liman River" is used as a synonym for the Dnieper.137 In addition to the name of the Alanus River, Gervase of Tilbury's description of Lower Scythia contains a number of other hydronyms derived from traditional ethnonyms: Vandalus,m Sarma- ticus. There is even the Lentulus River - possibly named after the com- mander who drove the Sarmatians from the Danube (see above, 2.11). These hydronyms may well be founded in reality.139 Or, consider the mysterious list of peoples in the works of the St. Victor school of the mid-twelfth century: "scite inferiores, daci, gothi, alani, gepidi, rugi, bulgari, huni vel hungari, nores, sciavi."140 Judging from the context, all of those peoples lived within the borders of Lower Scythia (the next period begins with Germanians and Alemanians; cf. Table 3). Do the Rugi imply Rus' or, possibly, the people of Rügen? The origins of the list are unknown; there appears to be no other mention of Rugi or Rus' in geo- graphical works of the St. Victor school, so no unambiguous identification of the ethnonym is possible. It is a different matter when an almost identical 135 Annie Angremy, "La 'Mappemonde' de Pierre de Beauvais," Romania 104 (1983): 484-85 (vv. 852, 858) and commentary. 136 Cf.

Trubaòev, vol. 2 (Moscow, 1967), p. 497. 137 See Gottfried Schramm, Nordpontische Ströme (Göttingen, 1973), p. 106, fh. 263. 138 As an etymon of the ethnomym vandali, the Vandalus River is mentioned in Lamb. 49r/99 and, in the form VindilicuslVandalicus, in Isid. 9.2.96. 139 The Alanus River is sometimes identified with the Prut, yet no convincing proof has been shown at this time. In connection with the ethnogenetic legend, which identified Vandals and Poles, the name Vandalus was used for the Vistula by Vincentius Kadlubek and perhaps by Gervase as well; see Grabski, Polska w opiniach obcych X-XIII (fh. 8), pp. 139-41, 144-48. 140 Hugues of St. Victor, "Mapa mundi," in Roger Baron, "Hugues de Saint- Victor lexi- cographe: Trois textes inédits," Cultura neolatina 16 (1956): 140; Rich. 3.4.

CHEKIN list, at almost the same time, appears in Benoit de Sainte-Maur's poem that mentiones "li Cit, li Got, li Alain, li Gepedien, li Roge e li Ungreis, li Hun. . . e li Bougreis e li Daneis," and, finally, "Esclavunnie." Unlike the St. Victor list, Benoit's list is more updated - at least the Dacians are now clearly Danes. The identification of these ethnonyms is confirmed in another passage of Benoit's poem. Nevertheless, the term "li Roge" does not seem to be synonymous with Rus', which is designated by the term "Rosié."141 3.16. The medieval literary tradition contains a toponymical transforma- tion opposite in its essence to archaization. It is rarer, and seems never to have been specifically described. In this transformation, a new toponym is inserted into a traditional phrase as if this toponym were a manifestation of a "normal" variance of a traditional name. There is no obvious change in the content of the traditional phrase; the new name "grows" inconspicu- ously from the old one under the influence of formal orthographic changes. Thus, Hirnia (in some copies, Hunid), which was mentioned by Honorius Augustodunensis in place of Hyrcania, was later transformed into Iranea by Gervase of Tilbury. Gervase's sources included communications from crusaders, so we cannot rule out the possibility that he knew the local name for the land of Iran.142 The conversion of the "region of Sueuia, named after the Sueuus mountain," into terra Suetia (tierra Sueçia), named after the Suetio (Sueçia) mountain143 more obviously reflects the Spanish and Italian geographers' knowledge of the name of Sweden. 3.17. Generally speaking, when an ancient text is inserted in a medieval description of the earth, certain semantic changes are simply inevitable. They are predetermined by obvious cultural differences: heroes of ancient history on maps of the world and other medieval iconographie monuments wear dresses of burghers and knights.144 In other words, even a "purely" traditional sign in the medieval description of the earth cannot imply the same content as its ancient analogue. "Traditional data" of medieval geog- raphy and cartography represent desemanticized and transcoded ancient texts whose meanings are elusive unless the new interpretation of the old 141 Benoit de Saint-More, Chronique des ducs de Normandie, éd.
