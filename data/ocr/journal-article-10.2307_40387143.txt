By defining the chronological limits and the typo- logical characteristics of the dentate, non-dentate and undecorated Lapita ware, and the forms of the non-ceramic material, this paper makes a preliminary study of the local differences of the Lapita cultural complex in Southern Melanesia. The Lapita phenomenon has been a central issue in the archaeological research programs conducted in Oceania, since its identification as an important cultural horizon in the prehistoric chronology of the South- West Pacific (Golson 1971). The astonishing homogeneity of this 'Cultural Complex', as it was defined by R.C. Green (1979a), was explained through a rapid dispersal of Austronesian sea-faring groups, out of the Bismarck Archipelago to southern Melanesia and Fiji-Western Polynesia, taking place in a few hundred years (Figure 1). The comparative studies conducted on archaeological material excavated in different major sites of the region showed the existence of discrete differences between a western Province (comprising the Melanesian chain) and an eastern Province (Fiji-Western Polynesia). A further refinement has been identified by D. Anson in part of the Bismarck Archipelago, leading to the identification of a Far Western Province (Anson 1983). This has been con- firmed by more recent studies issued from the Lapita Homeland Project (Kirch and Hunt 1988; Summerhayes 1996). In all these syntheses, the data from the southern Melanesian archipelagoes of Vanuatu and New Caledonia had little impact on the general debate. Only one major cluster of Lapita sites is known in Vanuatu, on the small island of Malo (Hedrick η. d.), although recently new data on this subject have been published (Bedford et al. 1998). In New Caledonia, apart from few exceptions (Gifford and Shutler 1956; Frimigacci 1974), the material from the Lapita sites was poorly published until recently (Sand 1996b, 1997a, 1998a). Since its creation in 1991, the local Department of Archaeology of New Caledonia has focused its research on a better understanding of the cultural and socio-politi- cal evolution characterising the nearly 3000 years of pre- history of the southern-most archipelago of Melanesia. After having mainly worked on sites dating back to the last 2000 years, and which had been poorly studied pre- viously (Sand 1995, 1996a), we started in 1994 to focus part of our programs on the restudy of archaeological sites related to the first millennium of Austronesian set- tlement, called the Koné period. This choice was mainly dictated by the need to identify better the characteristics of the beginning of the Austronesian settlement of the archipelago, in order to reconstruct more accurately the rest of the chronology. This focus has led to the excava- tion of various sites on the Grande Terre and in the Loyalty Islands, be they characterised by Lapita ceram- ics or post-Lapita ware (Sand 1996b, 1998a). The archaeological data collected in New Caledonia, especially those related to the settlement of the archipel- ago by people producing Lapita pottery, have a wider significance in the study of the prehistory of Near and Remote Oceania (Green 1991a). Representing a southern part of the Lapita phenomenon, they can shed a different light on the characteristics of the Lapita Cultural Complex from those identified in the northern part of Melanesia and in the Fiji-West Polynesian area. Unfortunately, the data on the Lapita settlement of Central and Southern Vanuatu, the neighbouring archi- pelago to the north-east, are scarce. This missing link makes the exact relations between the central Melanesian Lapita sites of the Reef Santa-Cruz-Northern Vanuatu area and those of southern Melanesia (especially New Caledonia), difficult to specify. Acknowledging this situ- ation but also taking into account the geographical posi- tion of the southernmost islands, Kirch, in his recent summary of Lapita, has proposed to identify, as well as the Far Western, Western and Eastern Lapita provinces, a Southern Lapita (1997:72-73). The scope of this paper is to try a first description of the possible characteristics of this postulated 'Southern Lapita province', comprising the islands of Southern Melanesia devoid of malaria. To be able to use this term in the future, we need to start to analyse its real signifi- cance. I have therefore tried to highlight aspects where a difference from the other Lapita provinces might prove of cultural significance. This is necessarily a preliminary trial, as studies of archaeological material excavated dur- ing the last years are still under analysis by specialists, Département Archéologie, Service des Musées, BP: 2393, 98846, Noumea, New Caledonia. sand@offratel.nc 20</page><page sequence="2">&gt;£¿ &lt;^ Solomon # ^ λ-XJÉ·* °s&lt;"^ β· _ Uvea P.N.G. &gt;s. « o ^ ·*· · Futuna · * ^ Samoa ftî Vanuatu »Í7· " ·· · ? ^~&gt; °0 o # Tonga [Australi^ Caledonia ^&gt;« Figure 1: The extent of the Lapita Cultural Complex in the South- Western Pacific. notably the ceramic and lithic material. The present analysis will start by looking at the chronological limits and environmental characteristics of the Lapita phenom- enon in New Caledonia. I will then turn to the different ceramic series (dentate and non-dentate), by paying attention to the typological characteristics of the wares, the types of decorations and the differences with the neighbouring regions. I will end with the characteristics of the non-ceramic material (adzes, fishing gear, orna- ments, tools), before synthesising the evolution of the archaeological material at the end of the Lapita horizon and assessing if 'Southern Lapita' is a useful concept. The chronology of the Lapita cultural complex in New Caledonia and its environmental characteristics Since the first attempts to define the chronological extent of the production of dentate-stamped Lapita pottery in New Caledonia, the basic hypothesis has been of a long chronology. Single dates from different sites obtained in the 1970s and 1980s had put the start of the Koné period, the first ceramic period of the Archipelago, around 1500-1400 BC (Galipaud 1992), and the end of the pro- duction of Lapita ware around 200 AD (Frimigacci 1980; Galipaud 1988, 1996), representing production for over 1500 years (Spriggs 1990a). The recently conducted excavations have allowed for multiple redating of major sites, like WKO013A of Lapita in Koné (Sand 1998a), KVO003 of St Maurice- Vatcha in Isle of Pines (Sand 1996b, in press), and of new discovered sites like LWT054 of Keny (Lifou) and LMA023 (Sand 1998b) of Kurin (Maré) (Sand, Bole et al. 1998). The results obtained show the existence of a much shorter chronol- ogy of Lapita decorated wares than supposed (Sand 1997a). The earliest dates place the beginning of the set- tlement of the archipelago by Lapita pottery makers not earlier than 1100-1050 BC. All the newly excavated sites have no dentate decorated Lapita sherds in primary depositional context after 800-750 BC. The chronology of Lapita production in New Caledonia is therefore short, lasting probably around 300 years. This short chronology of the postulated 'Southern Lapita Province' is in marked contrast to the situation in the Far Western Province, where the time span of pro- duction of Lapita pottery is about 1000 years (Kirch 1997; Spriggs 1997). Significantly though, we find a much similar chronology to what is identified as the Eastern Lapita Province of Fiji-Western Polynesia (Sand 1992a; Anderson and Clark 1999; Burley et al 1999) and what has appeared recently for the Western Lapita Province (Green 1991b). The chronological link seems therefore to be with the two nearest Provinces and espe- cially with the Eastern Lapita area. Although not dis- cussed here, I am convinced that this new chronological image has major implications for the identification of the concrete use of the dentate-stamped Lapita pots in the founding Austronesian societies of Remote Oceania. Much has been written on the choice of settlement location of Lapita sites (Green 1979a; Swadling 1986; Lepofsky 1988). A first study of the geographical loca- tion of Lapita sites on the West Coast of New Caledonia's Grande Terre (Main Island) had prompted Frimigacci to identify major similarities between them (1980). The pri- mary environmental setting seems to be a sheltered beach in front of a pass in the reef and next to a river, possibly near to a reef-flat, a mangrove area and cultivable soils. These characteristics hold for the Lapita site of St. Maurice- Vatcha on Isles of Pines, but they are not usable completely for the Lapita sites of the Loyalty Islands, 21</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2: Carinated pots from the pit of Lapita site WKO013A (drawings K. Coote), from site WBR001 of Nessadiou andLMA020ofPatho. characterised by old uplifted coral platforms without bar- rier reefs and where no rivers exist. Here, the sites are located in front of the fringing reef without mangrove, mostly on Quaternary sand-dunes (Sand 1995, Sand, Bolé et al. 1998). Some Lapita sherds have even been found in a small rock-shelter on a low uplifted coral platform, with difficult access to the sea (Sand 1998b). In sum, we see different settlement strategies, depend- ing on the natural environment encounted. Contrary to what seems to have happened in southern Vanuatu, where no large Lapita site in situ has been located to date, some of the Lapita sites of New Caledonia have been little affected by post-depositional processes of mixing. This has led to the conservation of large quantities of well pre- served material, in particular very large pottery sherds. These ceramic remains allow the identification of what could be a 'Southern Lapita ceramic series'. The principal characteristics of the postulated 'Southern Lapita ceramic series9 The typological forms The amount of large sherds found in excavations or in surface collections during the last 40 years makes New Caledonia one of the archipelagoes of Remote Oceania where the largest number of dentate-stamped and incised decorated Lapita pots have been reconstructed so far. The discovery in October 1995 of a pit with more than 15 reconstructable pots on location WKO013A of Lapita (Sand, Coote et al. 1998) has only highlighted the rich- ness of the archipelago's collection. The characteristics of the ceramic typology produced in New Caledonia at the beginning of the Austronesian settlement are there- fore quite well known. Five major ceramic forms can be identified, all present in the classic Lapita vessels and unknown, except for the first form, in the non-dentate stamped pots series. (1) The most common form is the carinated pot with an out-curved rim (Figure 2). The dentate-stamped Lapita pots can have a diameter at the carination ranging from 15cm to over 55cm. Observations made on the large dentate-stamped Lapita pots found in the WKO013A pit (Sand, Coote et al. 1998) have shown that the main construction was by slab building, with the probable use of a paddle and anvil to shape the pots before smoothing of the outer surface (Sand 1996b). This pot profile is by far the most common form for incised, shell-impressed or paddle-impressed pots produced in conjunction with dentate stamped pots. (2) The other main form is the flat-bottomed dish 22</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3: a-b) flat-bottom dishes; c-e) cups with pedestal feet; f) pot with incurved rim (a-f : dentate-stamped motifs). (Figure 3 a-b). The diameter and the form of these plates is variable, ranging from 20cm to more than 40cm. Most of the rims are out-curved, with a decoration on the inside and outside of the rim. Sometimes a carination is present. (3) The last major form is composed of dishes with a pedestal (Figure 3 c-e). The presence of a foot is directly identifiable on the flat bottom by the presence of a round groove, onto which was placed a small clay cylinder as a ring-foot. For some of these dishes, the question of the attachment of the two parts is open to question, but clearly most of these forms were really pedestaled dishes. (4) Some of the cannateci and decorated Lapita pots (form 1) have a composite rim. This typological form is linked to the presence of decorated lids with an attach- ment on top. The sherds from lids are difficult to distin- guish from the out-curved dishes (form 2), and they are mainly identified by the direction of the dentate-stamped motifs. (5) Few of the Lapita pots have an ovoid shape (Figure 3 f), with an incurved rim and mostly no carina- tion. The basal shape is unknown. A few small sherds have a rounded bottom like bowls. No special category has yet been created for them. The preliminary study of the dentate stamped Lapita collections from different sites has shown a wide variety in the size of the pots, their thickness and the geological composition of the sherds. Some dentate-stamped vessels were also decorated with clay nubbins on the rim or on the upper part of the body. The cylinders used to make the pedestals were often of composite form, with one or two horizontal clay coils placed around the main form. Finally, the presence of small perforations has been noticed on out-curved rims. This review of the dentate stamped Lapita typology of New Caledonia shows interesting relations with the data from the center and north of Melanesia, but also marked differences. One major form identified in the Far Western Lapita Province, the so-called 'cylinder stand' (Kirch 1997), is clearly absent from the postulated 'Southern Lapita ceramic series'. This is also the case with cut-outs in the clay, found to date on only one sherd in New Caledonia. We have to take into consideration the possible misinterpretation of some sherds from site SE-RF-2 (Reef) as parts of pots and not ring-feet (Parker 1981: plate 6). Knowing that this form is present in Malo (Northern Vanuatu) (Green 1992), a more common pres- ence in the Western Lapita series of pedestal dishes than presently published is possible. What seems to be the major development in New Caledonian Lapita is mainly the regular presence of composite rims on carinated pots, related to the use of lids (bearing in mind the difficulty of identifying this typological form on small sherds), although this type of rim is also known in some Western Lapita sites like Buka (Wickler 1995). These 'southern Lapita' typological differentiations are clearly more complex than the Eastern Lapita forms of the Fiji- Western Polynesia area (Mead et al. 1975; Poulsen 1987; Kirch 1988). The dentate-stamped Lapita motifs The general unity of the decorative Lapita motifs over a geographic area ranging from the Bismarck Archipelago to New Caledonia and Western Polynesia is one of the most striking characteristics of this ceramic tradition (Summerhayes 1996 for a review). Different ways of studying the sets of dentate-stamped geometric motifs have been followed over the years (see Green 1990 for a review), helping to identify similarities and differences between sites and regions. Studies and analyses are underway on the recently excavated Lapita material of New Caledonia and also on older material: these will be presented in full when achieved. In the mean time, I have tried to list, from the material published, the broad deco- rative categories that can be identified on the well-pre- served sherds (Sand 1996b, 1999a). The focus was on the decorative motifs present on the large central band, without looking at the friezes present over and under this central decoration. One of the characteristics identified in the 'Far Western Lapita Province' has been the amount of decora- tions made with tools having very small teeth, leaving a fine decoration on the surface of the pot (Anson 1983). Although statistical studies have not yet been completed on this subject for New Caledonia, it is clear that most of the dentate-stamped motifs have been made with medium-sized teeth, comparable to what is known of Western Lapita pots. Some sherds bear very fine indenta- tions, while at the same time some of the oldest and most elaborate pots were decorated with large toothed imple- ments (e.g. Sand 1999a: 44). The chronological and spa- tial homogeneity of the dentate tools from the postulated 'Southern Lapita province' must therefore be questioned, as slight variations appear to be present even within 23</page><page sequence="5">Figure 4: Dentate-stamped motifs of geometric construction: a) labyrinth; b) undulated; c) successive triangles; d) rec- tangular construction; e) triangles; f) wavy design. sites. Finally, one must acknowledge the presence of a large number of sherds with decorations made with the same type of tools as the dentate-stamped decorations but without teeth, in the Lapita sites of the Loyalty Islands (Sand 1998b: 215). Variations are also present in the amount of decorated material between Lapita sites. Using the calculation by surface-area of the different sherds present in the excava- tion, the largest density of decorated sherds, over 50% , has been found in some squares of location WKO013A at Lapita (Sand 1998a). In site LMA023 of Kurin, the amount is around 45% (Sand, Bolé et al. 1998). In the in situ Lapita layer of site KVO003 of St. Maurice- Vatcha, the amount is between 25% and 30% (Sand 1996b, in press). It drops to 17.5% in one of the test-pits of site WBR001 of Nessadiou (Sand 1996b). Broadly, about half of the surface of Lapita pots is decorated. These results demonstrate that in some parts of excavations, nearly all the sherds recovered come from decorated pots, probably as a result of discrete -spatial clusters (Sheppard and Green 1991). Twelve major decorative themes have been identified. These can be divided into (a) geometric designs, and (b) anthropomorphic designs and their stylised evolutions. In all these themes, the main decorative Construction' is the same, but slight differences are present between pots, be they in the development of the motif or in the details of the decoration. (a) The motifs of geometric construction (Figure 4). (1) The most complex motif is certainly a labyrinth (Figure 4 a), constructed on a series of interrelated bands (Donovan 1973: motif 73). The geometric construction is the same on all the discovered pots, be they from site WKO013A of Lapita, WBR001 of Nessadiou, WPT052 of Naia or KVO003 of St Maurice-Vatcha. In one instance, the motif is reversed. Some derived motifs, less complex, might be an evolution in the labyrinth motif. (2) A second major geometric construction can be classified under the term 'undulated' (Donovan motif 86) (Figure 4 b). The base of the motif is composed of a suc- cession of an X motif, related by a U-shaped motif. This construction can present a single band around the pot or can also form different rows. (3) Different types of 'successive triangles' have been identified (Donovan 1973: motif 13) (Figure 4 c). Some 24</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5: Anthropomorphic designs and their stylistic evolutions: a) double face; b) triangular face; c) elongated face with earplugs; d) simplified elongated face; e) simplified motif. are single-lined, others are reversed. The evolution and simplification of this motif occur in numerous variations. (4) A large part of the Lapita motif constructions are formed around a central rectangle (Figure 4 d). Starting from this simple form, endless variations can be imag- ined. Frequently the rectangle is subdivided into trian- gles, with different forms of infilling. (5) On some small carinated pots, the motif is restricted to the triangles (Figure 4 e). This does not mean that the decoration is necessarily simple, as the presence of surrounding friezes can highlight the com- plexity of the central motif. (6) One infrequent motif corresponds to the development of a wavy design, repeated around the pot (Figure 4 f). (7) The final simplification of the dentate-stamped motif is the imprint of successions of straight lines, mostly done with a U-shaped tool. This motif is charac- teristic of the end of the Lapita period. (b) The anthropomorphic Lapita design and its stylistic evolutions (Figure 5). Although anthropomorphic motifs were part of the earli- est Lapita collections made before the 1950s (Lenormand 1948; Spriggs 1990b: Figure 14), the full extent of Lapita faces was not identified before the 1980s. The New Caledonia sites have yielded a large number of sherds bearing different forms of anthropo- morphic motifs. The listing of these motifs has led to the identification of five major classes, which do not follow exactly the divisions proposed by Spriggs (1990b). (1) The most elaborate motif is composed of a dou- ble face, one rounded superimposed over another trian- gular (Figure 5 a). The triangular face forms the human body, whose open arms end up in rounded designs. The complexity of this double face construction is high- lighted by the friezes surrounding the central motif. Few of these motifs have been identified so far. They are present only in the earliest levels, showing a rapid demise of this design construction after first settle- ment. Interestingly, the upper rounded face is always simple, with no eyes and nose, showing a simplifica- tion compared to pots from the Western Lapita Province (Green 1976). (2) Another theme is the triangular face (Figure 5 b) with spans out from the double face. The eyes and the nose are the central repeated items, with sometimes more elaborate adjunctions (cheeks, eyelash). Some faces are covered by a half circle, which could represent a sort of cover or hat. The most common stylistic evolution of these triangular faces is interesting, as it shows the con- struction of motifs sharing part of their elements (eye, cheek), leading to the superimposition of the triangles. Some extremely simplified motifs have little in common with the original face. 25</page><page sequence="7">{ WÊiÊÈÈÊÊÈ^ « 1 . &gt; b W M ^ cm Figure 6: Non dentate-stamped pots: a) incised; b) plain; (drawings Κ. Coote); c) paddle-impressed. (3) The second major type of motif with faces (Figure 5 c) is composed of elongated representations of the nose and the two eyes but without the mouth, separated by a rounded or pointed geometric motif, labelled 'earplug' by Spriggs (1990b). The general construction is fairly simple and standardised, and the differences appear mainly in the way the 'earplugs' are filled. A well pre- served pot with this type of faces found in the pit of loca- tion WKO013A at Lapita (Sand 1999a) has shown that the 'earplugs' are not necessarily all filled-in with the same pattern: in this case for example the two patterns are repeated every two 'earplugs'. This major type of Lapita face representation has been already identified in the Far Western as well as in the Western Lapita Provinces (Spriggs 1990b; Kirch 1997). The southern Lapita examples can nevertheless be distin- guished by some specificities. The principal difference with what has been published on the Far Western Lapita series is the shift of this representation from 'cylinder stands' and open bowls supported by pedestal feet or rings' (Kirch 1997: 139) to carinated pots. Although some plates with feet bear this motif (see Siorat 1990: Figure 5), the majority of the identified faces are on pots. The second difference is the construction of these faces as a repetitive illustration around the pot, without zone- markers as found for example in Mussau (Kirch 1997: Figure 5.6). There does not seem to have been a phase of full faces, each having its two 'earplugs', as identified on sites SZ-8 and RF-2 in the Western Lapita Province (Spriggs 1990b: Figure 18-19). (4) The elongated anthropomorphic representation has been simplified by creating a motif with alternate eye- nose-eye-nose-eye (Figure 5 d). This evolution of the main motif has led to the development of an autonomous set of designs, up to the final simplification leading to the loss of the eye. (5) The space left free by the demise of the eye has been replaced, in another set of designs (Figure 5 e), by semi-circular or crossed patterns, whereby it has not been left empty. These simplified motifs appear statisti- cally to be the most numerous present in our Lapita col- lection. This high representation of derived motifs from the stylised face in the New Caledonian material has been identified first by Anson (1983). This has led Spriggs to hypothesise the local development of this par- ticular form of design (1990b: 110). However, as these are present from the bottom of the oldest sites in New Caledonia, it appears that the first Lapita potters arrived in the archipelago with this construction already known, or alternatively that this was a rapid local evolution, impossible to identify in the sites. Nevertheless, this development of stylised faces on carinated pots and on flat-bottom bowls is one of the main differentiation marks identifying the postulated 'Southern Lapita' den- tate-stamped motifs. In conclusion, we begin to have clear indications of a distinct 'Southern Lapita Province' in terms of pottery typology and dentate-stamped motifs. The most direct links are with the rest of the Melanesian chain, and all the data show a real gap with the Eastern Lapita material, which is in general less diversified. The non dentate-stamped pots As in the other Lapita sites of Island Melanesia, part of the sherds are not from dentate stamped pots. These pots are part of the "Lapita ceramic kit" of the first 26</page><page sequence="8">Austronesian settlers of the archipelago and have to be integrated fully in the definition of the postulated "Southern Province". In New Caledonia, four major types have been identified (Figure 6): incised, shell- impressed, plain and paddle-impressed. (a) The incised pots represent approximately 20 % of the decorated sherds (including dentate-stamped sherds) in the Lapita sites. They seem to be restricted mostly to carinated pots with an out-curved rim. A fairly large num- ber of incised pots have a notched lip. Interestingly, the incised motifs are restricted to a few major classes, placed always in the same way: a large central design, placed over a narrow band ending at the carination. By far the most representative motif is the succession of rounded tri- angles (Figure 6 a). On some pots, these triangles are ori- ented in the two opposite directions. The last major motif is formed by successions of waves. The homogeneity of decoration is also found in the narrow band over the cari- nation, with mostly the presence of a succession of trian- gles. All these characteristic Lapita incised motifs drop out at the same time as the dentate-stamped Lapita pots and have never been found in later contexts. The low diversity of the incised component of the postulated 'Southern Lapita' Province has striking simi- larities with what has been identified in the rest of the Melanesian chain. The incised pot of one of the Reef Santa Cruz sites published by Green (1976) is in all points similar to some of the pots of New Caledonia. The difference lies in the diversity of the motifs of the incised Far Western and Western Lapita Provinces, compared to the standardised postulated Southern Province. (b) The shell-impressed pots are an uncommon type of ware, but they are present in all the major Lapita sites. The shell-impressions, present on carinated pots, form regular successions of curved lines. (c) The most simple pots are those with only a notched lip or completely undecorated (Figure 6 b). Based on rim-counting, the undecorated pots represent between 10% and 50% of the total amount in the exca- vated collections, depending on the sites. Most seem to be carinated, with an out-curved rim, but some are clearly of simpler form. (d) The last type of non dentate-stamped ceramic pro- duced in New Caledonia at the beginning of the Austronesian settlement is composed of paddle-impressed ware of the Podtanéan tradition (Frimigacci 1981; Galipaud 1988; Sand 1995). The decorations are formed by long imprints of a carved paddle (Figure 6 c). The Podtanéan ware seems restricted typologically to the cari- nated pot with an out-curved rim, typical of the Lapita tra- dition. Paddle-impressions and dentate-stamped motifs occur sometimes on the same sherd. The major difference observed is the better quality of the paste of the Podtanéan tradition ware, allowing for thinner and harder pots. Although carved paddle-impressed sherds are present in all the Lapita sites of New Caledonia, they do not rep- resent a large proportion of the ceramic collection in the sites during the first generations of settlement. Their major development takes place after the demise of the dentate- stamped and incised Lapita motifs and is the clearest material link between the introduced material culture of the Lapita complex and the following ceramic traditions spanning out locally during the first millennium BC (Sand 1998b). Nevertheless, Podtanéan is another characteristic of the postulated 'Southern Lapita series'. Much has been written on the cultural significance of this particular ware, from the hypothesis of two distinct cul- tural groups at the beginning of New Caledonia's settle- ment (Green and Mitchell 1983) to the idea that Podtanéan represents the founding cultural group, who would have adopted Lapita as a foreign item after some centuries of settlement (Galipaud 1992). The clear identi- fication of the Podtanéan tradition as part of the ceramic productions of the first Lapita settlers of the archipelago has now led to the interpretation of differences in terms of function, the paddle-impressed ware being seen as a func- tional pottery, mainly for cooking activities (Sand 1995). The identification of a slab building technique for the Lapita pot construction and the probable existence of a finishing method by paddle and anvil, makes the presence of carved paddle decorations just a simple innovation, although the definition of the region of origin of the carved paddle's use as a decorative tool is for the moment difficult. Galipaud for example has found no paddle- impressed ware in Vanuatu (pers. comm. 1998). However the existence of a tradition of carved paddle in the 'Lapita ceramic building kit' has to be acknowledged on a wider scale, as some paddle-impressed sherds are present in the Fijian (Davidson et al. 1990) and West Polynesian Lapita sites (Sand 1992a, b). The important development of the Podtanéan ware, which took place chronologically after the demise of dentate- stamped Lapita, has thus to be interpreted simply as an evolution of a ceramic tradition from the founding 'Southern Lapita ceramic complex'. Non-ceramic artefacts of the postulated 'Southern Lapita Province' Few data have been published until recently on the non- ceramic artefacts found in the Lapita sites of New Caledonia. At the same time, the absence of full publica- tion of the major Melanesian Lapita sites makes any attempt at identifying differences difficult (see Green 1992: 16). The scope here is not to make a complete review of the data but to identify the major trends, by following previous work done on the subject (Jephcoate n.d., in Green 1992), and where the New Caledonia data was impressively poor. As these are more functional objects, comprising adzes, fishing gear, shell ornaments, stone and coral tools, we should expect to have a general similarity to the Melanesian Lapita non-ceramic kit. Adzes Three major types of stone adzes have been so far identi- fied in the New Caledonian Lapita sites, from approxi- 27</page><page sequence="9">il jtrîi ■;.".·ν.ν :vp ■ c ' " ^^^■■■■■^^^ 0 5 cm b Figure 7: Lapita stone adzes. mately a dozen well preserved specimens and numerous fragments. In the bottom of sites WKO013A of Lapita and KVO003 of St Maurice- Vatcha, a type of flat faced, medium-sized adze with a lenticular cross-section and flat sides has been identified. The second type is a longer, thicker form, with an oval cross-section and nar- row flat sides (Figure 7). This type of adze is the only form to be developed at the end of the Lapita horizon, leading to the production of long adzes with oval cross- sections and no flat sides during the rest of the Koné period (Sand 1995, 1996b). Finally, small flat adzes, not exceeding 5mm thickness, may have been used as carv- ing tools for wood. The 'Southern Lapita' stone adze inventory shows marked similarities with the other provinces of the Melanesian chain. Although no provenience study has yet been carried out on this material, it appears clearly that a particular, nearly uniform type of dark-green siliceous rock from the Grande Terre has been used to make the Lapita adzes. This type of rock has never been again used to make New Caledonian adzes. The shift to more readily accessible raw material sources is probably one of the reasons of the evolution of the forms at the end of the Lapita horizon. Of importance is the near total absence of shell adzes: at present, only one Tridacna shell adze has been found in location WKO013A of Lapita. Probably due to the large variety of suitable rocks for tools existing on the Grande Terre, few shell adzes have been produced in the archipelago during prehistoric times (Sand 1995). Fishing gear The fishing gear collection is at present poor. One possi- ble lure has been identified in site KVO003 of St. Maurice- Vatcha and apart from small pointed pieces of shell possibly from small hooks, only two broken one- piece fishhooks have been identified so far. The WKO013A example is a long Trochus-shell artefact (6.7 cm in shank length) with a broken end and a double notching for the attachment (Sand 1996b: fig. 48). It is nearly identical to examples found in Lapita context from the Far Western sites of Mussau (Kirch 1987: Figure 7). Interestingly, the double notching is seen in site AN-6 of Anuta as characteristic of the fish-hook type HT1 related to the early plain-ware phase (Kirch and Rosendahl 1973). This fishhook type is in marked contrast to what has been found in the Eastern Lapita sites of Fiji and Western Polynesia, where the hooks are always smaller. The only other fishing gear type identified is the Cypraea octopus lure. Interestingly, it appears that this artefact is absent from the Far Western Lapita sites (Jephcoate n.d.), although a sampling error is possible here. Ornaments (Figure 8) A large quantity of shell ornaments has been discovered in the different Lapita sites excavated. Nearly the com- plete kit identified in the Lapita Cultural Complex is pre- sent in New Caledonia. If we take as a starting point the list of Poulsen (1967), worked on by Jephcoate (n.d.) (see also Poulsen 1987, Kirch 1988), then we can cite: narrow and broad bracelets in Conus, Tridacna and Trochus shell, small rings, squat, rectilinear and circular units, curved segments, pearl shell and perforated uni- valve pendants, small Conus and pearl shell beads, fish bone beads, pottery discs and miscellaneous artifacts. One important item is not present in the postulated 'Southern Lapita' inventory: it is the type of long units pieced at the two ends, mainly of Tridacna, characteristic of the shell ornaments of the Lapita sites of the Eastern Lapita province. An intermediate example, 4cm long, has been found on location WKO013A of Lapita. What distinguishes most the postulated 'Southern Lapita' ornaments is the number of incised motifs made on the narrow and broad Conus shell bracelets. The most common item is the presence of one to three grooves on the upper part of the ring. Other units have been incised with different types of V-shaped motifs. The relation to the dentate-stamped designs is most clear on two bracelets of WKO013A of Lapita (Sand 1998a) and NKM001 of Boirra (Koumac), where X-shaped and V- shaped motifs have been made by applying a needle to make indentation marks. To my knowledge, these deco- rations have not been reported elsewhere in Melanesia. They come as another indication of the possible presence of the characteristic Lapita designs on other materials than just pottery (Green 1979b). 28</page><page sequence="10">Figure 8: Lapita ornaments (natural size). Stone, shell and coral tools As with the ornaments, most of the tools listed by Jephcoate (n.d.) are found in the postulated 'Southern Lapita' sites. The stone tools can be subdivided into stone knives, chert and chalcedony flakes, rough dressed pebbles, anvil pounders, stone and pumice files and grinders. Although most of the flakes are of medium size (Forestier 1999), small finely executed points, probably used to drill the small shell beads, have now been identi- fied in all the major sites. The presence of some obsidian flakes from the sub-source of Kutau/Bao at Talasea in North New Britain (PIXE-PIGME analysis) (P. Sheppard, pers. com. 1998, Sand in press) has to be men- tioned in location WKO013A of Lapita and site KVO003 of St Maurice- Vatcha. The total absence of what has been called 'grooved stones', present in the Eastern Lapita sites, is probably to be associated with the absence of the long unit Tridacna ornaments. One class of item not listed by Jephcoate is the nut-cracking stones, present in location WKO013A of Lapita. Also of interest is the absence of small abrading stones with a depression for the manufacture of shell beads (Kirch 1983; Sand 1992b), although numerous flat beads have been found in the New Caledonian Lapita sites. The shell tools are identified as Conus gouges and as 29</page><page sequence="11">univalve and bivalve shell scrapers. The question of the existence of shell net sinkers in the New Caledonia Lapita sites remains open. Finally, the coral tools are composed predominantly of coral files. The demise of Lapita in Southern Melanesia Few archaeological site of New Caledonia have to date allowed the identification of the demise of the dentate- stamped and incised Lapita pots and the evolution of the other forms of items. Most of the time, these evolutions appear as transformations of the characteristics in the archaeological material between stratigraphie layers. In the rock-shelter LWT008 of Hnajoisisi of Lifou Island for example, the dentate-stamped and incised sherds of the bottom layer are replaced by carved paddle- impressed sherds of the Podtanéan tradition, which con- tinue for one millennium of occupation. In the upper part of the in situ Lapita layer of site KVO003 of St. Maurice- Vatcha, some incised sherds of the distinctive Puen tradition are present (Sand 1996b, in press). This tradition is characteristic of the second half of the Koné period in the south of the Archipelago (Sand 1999b). In sites of the Bourail region, carinated pots bear carved paddle-impressions and fine incised motifs that can be related to older dentate- stamped Lapita. In the Yaté region on the south-east coast, simple dentate-stamped decorations, that I have tentatively interpreted as a form of simplified late Lapita, appear on some pots (Sand and Ouetcho 1992: 68-69). Finally, in the Pindai region, we see at the end of the first millennium BC wavy incisions and cord-marked decorations on simple globular pots (Sand 1996b). We see slow, clearly mainly local, developments of ceramic wares out of the Lapita complex (Sand 1999b). There is no 'replacement' of Lapita, but rather there is evolution of the non-dentate-stamped and early incised components of the ceramic complex. This evolution is also identified in the stone adze typology (with longer and thicker specimens and a change in the raw material used), in the shell ornaments (with the slow demise of the hard Tridacna rings and lesser ornaments present in the later sites) and in the fishing technics (with the devel- opment of smaller fishhooks). Interestingly, this slow evolution in the ceramic typol- ogy is also identifiable in the neighbouring archipelago of Vanuatu. There, from what has been shown by recent excavations (Bedford and Spriggs 1999), the rapid demise of dentate-stamped Lapita pots has been followed by the evolution of non-decorated and then incised ceramics in the central islands. Discussion The refinement of the Lapita analysis over the last 20 years has led to the identification of major subjects of study (Kirch and Hunt 1988), from the definition of the cultural complex as a whole to the description of its ceramic (Mead et al. 1975; Green 1979a) and non- ceramic components (Green 1992) or its chronological limits (Spriggs 1990a). The variability of the Lapita ceramic complex begins to be well identified, showing a logical trend from the north-west of Melanesia to the south and the east towards Western Polynesia. The data from New Caledonia just presented fall nicely in the cen- tral part of this general typology and chronology from north-west to east. The large flat-bottomed plates with pedestals, characteristic of the Melanesian chain, are replaced in Fiji- West Polynesia mostly by carinated pots. The intricate dentate-stamped motifs of the western area are slowly replaced in the east by more loose impres- sions. We therefore can demonstrate a clear and logical simplification of typological forms and stylistic com- plexity during the colonising movement of the Austronesian settlers. This pattern parallels unquestionably the chronology of settlement, the same simplification applying for the length of production. The oldest and longest area of pro- duction of Lapita ware is in the founding geographical region of northern Melanesia, the shortest period of pro- duction being identified in Western Polynesia, where the typology is the least complicated. Again, New Caledonia appears in a median position between the west and the east. This observation leads to the questioning of the set- tlement chronology accepted until recently for the West Polynesian region, supposed to have started around 1200 BC exclusively on marine shell dates (Kirch and Hunt 1988, 1993; Kirch 1997). The fairly simple Eastern Lapita typology identified is the sign of a later settlement than 1200 BC. The Eastern province having probably been settled from an area in central Melanesia, we might anticipate some time gap between the earliest Lapita occupation of the Reef Santa-Cruz (dated between 1200 BC and 1150 BC by Green (1991b)) and the settlement to the east, with the crossing of a 850 km sea-gap. New chronologies recently published place the effective colonisation of Fiji sometimes around 900 BC (Anderson and Clark 1999), and the settlement of the smaller islands of Eastern Fiji and Western Polynesia between 850 and 750 BC (Burley et al. 1999, Sand sub.). The simplification of the ceramic inventory in Eastern Lapita Province compared to the proposed Southern Lapita Province settled from 1100 BC on, is well in line with the new proposed dates for that region. In this first and necessarily preliminary review of a pos- sible 'Southern Lapita Province', only the artefacts have been listed. Other items might certainly show other partic- ularities, specially in relation to the use of the local insular environment. One of the most striking questions of the New Caledonian chronology is the total absence of the pig (Sus scrofa), a major cultural symbol for the rest of the Pacific societies. No pig bone has been found to date in any Lapita site of the archipelago. The reasons that might explain this absence are at present unclear, as is the cul- tural significance of this local particularity (Gorecki 1992). New Caledonia can be affected by drought, and 30</page><page sequence="12">some of the soils of poor horticultural quality would maybe have led to a necessary extirpation of the pig in some areas, but these two reasons are not enough to account for its total absence from the archipelago. Another peculiar pattern arises from the results of the fishbone-analysis of the earliest sites, showing on the Grande Terre a large representation of Lethrinidae fishes, in greater proportions (F. Leach, pers. comm. 1997) than identified in the rest of the region (Butler 1994). The par- ticular lagoon environment of the western part of the Grande Terre, the largest of the Pacific, with its reef totalling over 500km length and sometimes over 15km wide, might explain this local adaptation to the fish inventories. The extinction of local fauna is well recorded in the earliest sites, with the demise of the megapode Sylviornis neocaledoniae, the land crocodile Mekosuchus inexpectatus, the horned turtle Meilania mackayi, the varanid (Varanus sp.) and a large number of birds (Balouet and Olson 1989). This picture parallels what is known elsewhere in the Pacific (Flannery 1995, Steadman 1997). Finally, a whole chapter should be reserved to the study of the sourcing of archaeological material, but studies on this subject are just starting. The presence of some West New Britain obsidian flakes cannot be inter- preted as regular imports of raw material over long dis- tances. These very small flakes only illustrate the remaining samples of material carried by the first settlers from their homeland in the Reef-Santa Cruz area, where the flow of Talasea obsidian in relatively large quantity seems to stop (Sheppard 1993). The total amount of obsidian in location WKO013A of Lapita and site KVO003 of Vatcha is not more that about 50 grams. The sourcing of the earliest stone adzes is not completed, but this might shed light on other long distance imports. Clearly though, the most regular exchange links where concentrated on the archipelago itself, mainly with the regular import of pots and stones from the Grande Terre to the Loyalty Islands (Sand 1998b: 215-217). However, all these data are presently too scarce to venture any firm conclusions. Conclusion The scope of this paper was to highlight the differences that could be identified in the archaeological material related to the Lapita horizon of New Caledonia, in order to test the concept of a 'Southern Lapita Province' recently proposed by Kirch. It appears, after this first review of the artefacts present in the New Caledonian Lapita sites, that we can indeed identify differences, par- ticularities and unique local characteristics, placing this material as a distinct 'Southern Lapita' group. This con- clusion strengthens the view that the 'Lapita phenome- non' is composed of different discrete geographical clus- ters (Green and Kirch 1997). The apparent homogeneity of the Lapita Cultural Complex must not mask - in future analyses - the significant evolutionary differences between the 'Lapita provinces', if we want better to understand the mechanisms of spread, settlement and local adaptations of these Austronesian potters who left the Bismarck Archipelago more than 3000 years ago.
