<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ludwig Deubner: Attische Feste. Berlin: Keller 1932. 267 S. 40 Taf. 50 M. A new treatment of Attic festivals, worthy to be set beside Nilsson's investigation in his Griechische Feste, has long been needed, and now we have it. In the present work Deubner has given us an admirable account of the topic, arranging the festivals according to the deities to whom they belonged, and giving for each a clear and satisfactory statement of the evidence and a lucid and penetrating commentary. The whole is marked by an equal mastery of literary and archaeological material, a complete absence of confusion between fact and inference, and a robust common sense. It is a book to be read, but it is also arran ged and indexed in such a way as to make it a perfect work of reference. Further, the excellent plates give an admirable selection from the vases and other monuments on which we depend for so much of ritual practice. There is here much that is original and attractive; I may mention in particular the remarks on the distinction between ?qqrjcpoqe?v and ?qqrjcpoqe?v (9ff.); the discussion of the age of the naval car used at the Panathenaia (33); the account of the Eleusinian mysteries, perhaps the best ever written (69ff.); the thorough treatment of Dionysus, and the contention that an early wave of his cult came to Attica from Ionia (122f.); the handling of the Dipolieia (158ff.); the distinction between Meter theon and Cybele (216); the excursus on vases belonging to the Choes (238ff.); the second excursus, on the frieze, now in the church of Hag. Eleutherios, with representations of seasons, zodiacal signs, and figures symbolizing the principal festivals in their places in the year (248 ff.); the refutation of what had appeared an attractive suggestion about the Skira (49f.). This is not all; the reader cannot but feel on every page that he is in the presence of an honest and vigorous mind, which has made full use of previous investigations and has nevertheless approached this subject with as much freshness and freedom from preju dice as if all the material had come from a new find of papyri. There is of course room for some divergence of opinion; that lies in the nature of the evidence, consisting as it does of phrases, statements and representations which in their own time needed no explanation and of the comments of a later age concerned with the interpretation of a literary tradition. On some issues, failing new finds, the truth seems unattainable; thus there is a group of vases which Deubner, following Frickenhaus, regards as referring to the L?naea; Nilsson argues that they represent rather the mixing of wine at the Choes, which formed Gnomon 1934 19</page><page sequence="2">290 Gnomon 1934 part of the Anthesteria (cf. now his Eine neue schwarzfig. Anthesterien vase, Bull. Soc. de Lettres, Lund, 1932/33, 44ff.). Probability appears to be on Nilsson's side, but we may be pardoned for suspending judgment. On one point I feel compelled to more definite dissent. Deubner places the Adonis festival at the beginning of autumn (221). Now Baudissin (Adonis und Eshmun, 100) has shown that the festival of the kindred Babylonian figure Tammuz fell in June-July, and (12Iff.) that most of our Graeco-Roman evidence for Adonis points to the same time of year. Cumont (Syria, 8, 1927, 338ff., followed by J. Bidez, Vie de L'Empereur Julien, 277) has made it probable that the celebration of the festival which coincided with Julian's arrival at Antioch in 362 fell in July and quite likely that a kindred rite of Salambo was performed at Seville on July 17?19; in an article which was not available when Deubner wrote he has shown that the celebration in Syria was connected with the rising of the Dogstar on July 19 (M?langes Glotz, 1, 257ff.). When was the festival at Athens in the fifth century B. C. ? Aristophanes speaks of it as coinciding with the speech of Demostratos urging the expedition to Sicily (Lysistrata 389ff.). The expedition sailed in the summer of 415: the calculations of B. D. Meritt have given June 20 as the date1). What Aristophanes says might possibly refer to some discussion in the ekklesia subsequent to the original decision, but it is sXeye nXeiv ?? HixeXiav, not something like eXeye ur) u?XXeiv ?XX? nXe?v ?? Zixe X?av; further, Plutarch (Nik. 12, Alkib. 18) mentions Demostratos as the author of the proposal that the three generals should be entrusted with full powers for the equipment of the expedition as well as for the conduct of the war, and Demostratos is probably the n? of Thucydides 6, 25, l2). I infer that the reference is to the original meeting at which the expedition was voted, and this is dated in spring by Thucydides 6, 8, 1; rov ?' ?niyiyvou?vov d?gov? ?ua fjgi. Must we not return to the old view that there was a spring celebration3) ? In 415, on Meritt's calculations, Elaphebolion began on March 12, Munychion on April 104); we cannot however fix a precise date for the celebration, and it appears to have been private in character although fully recognized and familiar. Its standing is shown by the reference in Aristophanes Pax 420 ; Trygaios, seeking the aid of Hermes, promises him in return for it that the Panathenaea and all other rites, the mysteries, the Dipolieia and the Adonia, shall be celebrated in his honor; this combination of the solemn, the archaic, and the exotic is inten tionally humorous, like the contemptuous reference in Kratinos fr. 15, but implies that the Adonia had their place in the religious year. The advocates of a date in summer quote Plato Phaidros, p. 276B, where the making of gardens for Adonis is set in summer, i??gov?; but it is ??gov?, not ??gov? ueaovvro?, and, as Nilsson has remarked (Studia de Dionysus Atticis, 101 n.) the point of the passage is the contrast of this eccentric time of sowing with the normal autumn sowing5). Further, if we can trust Ast's lexicon, Plato never uses ?ag, on ga, uer?n gov as x) AJA. 34, 1930, 125ff.: Athenian Financial Documents of the Fifth Century, 170. Professor W. S.

The Pythagoreans had a theory of four specific seasons (Diels, Vorsokratiker I4 xliif.), the Hippocratic treatise On the number Seven, a theory of seven, summer lasting to the rising of the Dogstar, autumn (Onega) till that of Arcturus (September), and in the calendar frieze mentioned above summer falls between Taurus and Gemini, i. e. April-May, and is associated with Thargelion, and the figure representing autumn falls be tween Leo and Virgo, i. e. July-August, follows the Dogstar, and is associated with Metageitnion2). But in general ?ag, ?n ga when used did not have hard and fast limits bat referred to natural processes: Aristotle says, p. 553b 19f., ?xav u?v oi?v ?ag ?xpiov y?vnxai, just as we say 'when spring is late'. When Theo phrastus says of the abrotonon (Hist, plant. 6, 7, 3) ngouoaxsvouevov [??] ?v ?axgdxoi? aneg ol A? vi?o? xfjnoi xov ??gov? he may be assumed to be speaking more precisely, since in De causis plantarum 1, 13, 4 he distinguishes sag and ??go?. There are three possibilities; first, that the variations of the calendar had brought the festival later in his time ? and it need not be later than early May; secondly, that he referred to the gardens on the basis of the allusion in Plato ; thirdly, that the gardens belonged to a summer celebration distinct from the lamentation in spring. In any case, there is no botanical difficulty in the preparation of the gardens in April; Frazer, Golden Bough 5, 253f. mentions a Sicilian and Calabrian custom of sowing wheat, lentils, and canary seed in plates and causing them to shoot up in time to be placed on the Good Friday sepulchre. The only evidence adduced for an autumn date at Athens is the vase figured by Deubner pi. 25, 2; it shows a woman climbing a ladder and holding a plate loaded with grapes. Hauser, Jahreshefte, 12, 1909, 93ff., showed its re semblance to vases on which a woman bearing a 'garden of Adonis' mounts a ladder, urged that it too referred to the Adonia, and argued that as the grapes would not be available before September the festival could not fall earlier than that. Against this we must remark (1) that grapes were hung or otherwise preserved till the Choes, which fell on Anthesterion 12 (that is in 415, according to Meritt, on February 21) and can in Greece today be kept till the end of March (Deubner 132), as in Sicily till April; (2) that grapes are nowhere mentioned as an offering to Adonis, unless we suppose them to be implied in the phrase of Hesychios (s. v. A? vi?o? xfjnoi), navxo?anfjv ?n gav ? and Hesychios illustrates his meaning thus, o?ov ?x uagdi?g v xal i?gi?ax v; (3) apart from the formal analogy of the ladder and the presence of a winged Eros, no one would think of associating this vase with the Adonia : the connexion is very dubious ; and, if it exists, we may regard the detail as imaginative ; such representations of eult-acts were never photographic. Adonis appears in Greek literature and art from the beginning of the sixth century onw^ards, when contacts with Cyprus are certain and with Syria dubious, and all probability points to a Cyprian origin for the Athenian cult. Now Lydus x) Note above all Ep. p. 345 D; ?jv y?g fisgo? r?or? x?xs xal ?xTikoi x v ve v. 2) For later dates of the beginnings of the seasons cf. Geoponica 1,1; pp. 362f. of. Wachsmuth's edition of Lydus De Ostentis ; A. Rehm, SBHeid., 1913, iii, 11, 31; L. Bianchi, ib., 1914, iii, 33, 38. Summer starts with the rising of the Pleiads, placed usually May 8 or 9, always between May 7 and 11, autumn usually between Aug. 8?12. 19*</page><page sequence="4">292 Gnomon 1934 (de mensibus 4, 65, p. 119 W?nsch)1) records the sacrifice, offered in Cyprus to Aphrodite, of a pig in the skin of a sheep and on April 2, of wild boars, because of the plot against Adonis. He says nothing of the 'gardens' but he makes it clear that there was a spring celebration marked by a sacrifice of peculiar character. This seems to me to account for a spring celebration at Athens, possibly existing side by side with a summer celebration ? as in Cyprus perhaps with an autumn celebration2). There are indications of a possible spring celebration at Byblos3), and the season was appropriate4). Later the midsummer celebration became familiar, particularly from Alexandrian practice and its reflections in literature. This perhaps accounts for the modifications in Plutarch of the story of 415. In Alkib. 18, 5, he makes the Adonia coincide with the preparations of the fleet and mentions it before the mutilation of the Herrnai, now dated on the night of June 7/8; in Nik. 13, 11, he mentions it after the Hermai and brings it to the time of sailing, r v rjueg v ?v a?? r?v ar?Xov ?^?neunov. Three further points of detail may be mentioned. First, the Aristides scholion quoted (107 n. 7, on the basis of the textual studies of F. Lenz) ?v y?g ra?? . . nouna?? ? pi?v Aiovvaov, ? ?? Uarvgov, ? ?? Bdxxov aveXdu?ave oxrjpia, raises an interesting question. Dionysus and Bacchus are here treated as dif ferent. Does the first mean the type of the cultgod in his majesty, the second the ecstatic type of the deity with whom the worshipper was made one in enthu siasm ? This would square with the use of Baxyelo?, Bdxxio?, as epithets of Dio nysus (cf. CIRev. 40, 1926, 185); they could be parallel to another epithet of his, mystes. Secondly, the addition of the epithet ?lava?rjva?xd to the title of r? Avr vieia (236) affords an analogy for the addition of Sebasta to other such names, which seems to mean no more than the addition of Royal or Imperial to the designations of various foundations. Thirdly, in regard to the Eleusinia (91 f.), reference might well be made to the discussion by W. B. Dinsmoor (The Archons of Athens 209 ff.), who places the trieteric celebrations in the second and fourth years of each Olympiad, and the penteteric in the third. The material which Deubner has so well set forth gives us occasion to consider certain general aspects of the organization of public religion at Athens. First, the calendar in its main lines must be the deliberate creation of a particular time. We can see how it was expanded ? no 1) The point in question is clear in the manuscript text: the detail of the sacrifice depends on a certain emendation of R. W?nsch, Das Fr?hlingsfest der Insel Malta, 26 (ngo?drov for ngo?arov; avv ??vov for avv??vov). ? For the Cyprian origin of the cult, cf. K. Latte, De saltationibus Graecorum (RGW. 13, 3) 100. 2) Nilsson, Griechische Feste, 387. The absence of an accepted solar calendar made for considerable diversity. 3) Nilsson, 1. c. ; de Vaux, Revue Biblique, 42, 1933, 44. Praxilla of Sikyon, fr. 2, Diehl, has been thought to be evidence of a midsummer festival in 5th century Greece : Adonis mourns that he leaves sun, stars, moon rj?? xal gaiov? aixvov? xal ufjXa xai oyxva?. It may point in this direction, but it is natural that Adonis should mourn the loss of these things. 4) Anitschkoff, summarized by Deubner, ARW. 9, 1905, 460; cf. the Roman calendar for April.</page><page sequence="5">A. D. Nock: Deubner, Attische Feste 293 tably as a result of the incorporation of Eleusis and later of Oropos in the state, of Pisistratid policy, and of the assimilation of new cults, such as those of Asklepios, Bendis and Pan. Nevertheless, the core is no product of chance. The archaeological evidence of the Minoan Mycenaean age suggests that fertility rites were then practised, and they were presumably fixed by seasonal and agricultural necessity at given points in the natural year; further, the Odyssey indicates the existence of an Apollo festival at the time of its writing, and calendar and festival were old in Egypt and Babylonia. Nevertheless, as far as Greece is concerned, the nomenclature of months is subsequent to the time of Homer and Hesiod, and belongs to the seventh or at earliest to the eighth century B. C. Nilsson, who has proved this, has further pointed to the great probability that the Delphic oracle had a consi derable share in this process1). Recognizing this, we must also note the amount of diversity in the results; Delphi clearly regulated old usage, and did not create or impose. It gave direction, but religious affairs were now the concern of the polis and of its oligarchic rulers and not of a monarch, and their outlook was more provincial and local than his had been. Moreover, the development which now took place over so wide an area is intelligible only as part of a rise of civic and ra cial interest in Greek worship as such, seen clearly in the contemporary emergence of temples and lifesize cultimages and in the Homeric hymns. The hymns to Apollo and to Demeter stress the building of temples and the establishment of worship, and the short fragmentary hymn to Dio nysus (1, 10 Allen-Sikes) makes Zeus prophesy that men will raise many images to his son in temples2). There are other signs of religious develop ment at this time; thus at Aija Irini in Cyprus the bullgod becomes wholly anthropomorphic by the end of the early archaic period, that is by about the second half of the seventh century B. C., which com pletes a process begun some 250 years before; further, the holy place 1) ARW. 14, 1911, 423ff.; Die Entstehung und religi?se Bedeutung des griechischen Kalenders (Lunds Universitets ?rsskrift, N. F. Avd. 1, 14 Nr. 21, 1918). 2) Cf. Nock, Conversion, 23f.; but I now regard the Hermes hymn as re presenting the literary elaboration of a more popular point of view and interested in M?rchen rather than in cult. The evolution of temple cult from the domestic cult conducted by rulers or others wTas sometimes gradual e. g. at Aija Irini (E. Sj?qvist, ARW. 30, 1933, 308ff.), and Thermon (H. C. G. Payne, JHS. 53, 1933, 281; cf. ib. 279 and Year's Work in class, stud. 1933, 93f. on models of thatched dwellings, possibly shrines such as that described by Chryses in Iliad 1, 39, and on the early temple, perhaps eighth century, at Perachora, and JHS. 1. c. 284ff. on an early apsidal building, possibly a temple, at Antissa in My tilene).</page><page sequence="6">294 Gnomon 1934 was now^ enlarged, and there is a sharp contrast between the poverty of the Geometric period and the changed conditions of the early ar chaic1). The emergence of temples and large images was gradual and spasmodic; so no doubt was the development of festivals. Literature and in a smaller degree art had panhellenic aspects: but religious life in Greece at this time was cantonal, as in a measure it remained. The calendar leads us into a world of which we otherwise know little; it does this because, although existing festivals were enlarged and others added, there were no omissions save in times of political and social disturbance. Ancient ceremonies (in particular, for instance a number of festivals associated with Zeus at Athens and elsewhere) might become unintelligible and of little interest, but they survived in the calendar and they were long observed, even when their obser vance had become as perfunctory as the holding of the comitia curiata in the later Roman republic; aq%al? ye xal AmoKm?r}2). Perhaps the most striking evidence of conservative continuity is the survival of the tetra polis, which included Marathon, as a religious entity with its own rites. Secondly, as we come down to more familiar times and contemplate the details of Athenian religious procedure, we must feel as we do when we contemplate the details of Athenian administration, and in parti cular such a complicated matter as the working of the tribal cycle in the appointment of officials. We cannot but wonder at the way in which democracy when fully developed managed an intricate system which involved the direct participation of so many citizens. Religion had been the affair of the polis from its beginnings; in democratic days, as earlier, there were certain religious experts, the families with hereditary functions at Eleusis and the exegetai (from whom the Basileus might conceivably pick his assessors), but there was not a hieratic spirit; according to tradition, Theseus handed over knowledge of religious affairs (ycvcoaxecv x? esta) to the Eupatridai as a whole3). Athenian democracy produced a peculiar ethos. Many questions of religion came before the popular assembly; law required that at the x) Sj?qvist, L c. 327, 336, 328; for seventh century interest in myth cf. Vollgraff, Mnemosyne, 59, 1931, 369ff.

Roussel, M?langes Bidez, 821). This reflects the archaizing and conservative mood which showed itself in the Greek world at the time; cf. Nock, CIRev., 39, 1925, 60ff.</page><page sequence="7">Chr. Blinkenberg: Eiimann, Labyrinthos 295 third and fourth meeting during each prytany three matters relating to the gods, three relating to heralds and embassies, and three relating to oaca should be brought forward1). Any and every citizen had as of right and as of duty his share in these proceedings ; nearly every citizen was able to serve as Basileus or as priest; any citizen of means was liable to be obliged to take his part in the great Dionysia; and even the illegitimate and their descendants were subject to prosecution if they shirked duty as parasitoi of Herakles2). Perhaps this makes it easier to understand how, in the stress of war, prosecutions for asebeia emerged ; there were no creeds, but the gods were part of the framework of the city and their worship was part of a citizen's life. Nowhere is this clearer than in Aristophanes, Lysistrata, 641 ff. Civic religious responsibility declined only with the decline of civic responsibility in general3). The festival, with its mixture of piety, patriotism and merrymaking, holy day and holiday alike, is a central fact of ancient corporate religion, and very much of the life of antiquity is lost to us if we do not under stand it aright.
