The importance of his contribution is barely suggested in the foregoing notes. WILLIAM F. EDGERTON THE UNIVERSITY OF C:HICAGO Bibliography is also included in the introductory pages; in this connexion a useful addition would have been the chapter, Current Progress and Prob- lems in Septuagint Research, by E. M. Orlinsky in The Study of the Bible Today and Tomorrow, edited by 13:. R. Willoughby (1947). Chapter I, which is on Ealakah, opens with the statement: 'Das Verstandnis der LXX erfordert eine kur3e Erlauterung des Depositenrechtes nach judischer Tradition.' A reading of PriJs's book shows that in a number of cases the LXX has the same interpretation as Jewish tradition. We must also admit that there are numerous cases in the LXX where we find esemplified the Jewish methods of esegesis which can easily be identified, even though they are not extant in the traditional literature. This is borne out by the reviewer's study of the esegetical methods employed in the translation of I Samuel.l Prijs's citation of Jewish literature has drawn attention to an ap- proach that has been neglected by commentators, and for this reason his study is of great impor- tarlce. The author does not make clear, however, by what method the translators availed themselves of the material which he has culled from the ex- tensive literature, but he hardly means to imply that they had it before them in written form. It should also be borne in mind that probably many agreements of the LXX with the traditional litera- ture are due solely to a common approach and method of exegesis and that we have to consider the element of coincidence. This study clearly indicates that Ealakah, lIaggadah, and Midrash began in pre-LXX times and that there were cer- tain exegetical methods in Jewish schools both in Palestine and in the Diaspora. In a number of instances the author appropriately refers to the discussion of hermeneutics as found in lI. L. Strack's Einleitung in Talmud qznd Midras (1930), pp. 95-109. Naturally the Jewish translators of 1 See the brief communication eIsewhere in this issue of the JOUKD[AL. adequately presented here.

No human being could have written such a commentary without arousing disagreement on Judtsc7we Tradttton in der Septuagtnta. By LEO PRIJS. PP. IXV + 118. Leiden: E. J. BRILL, 1948. 15 guilders. The work under review is an estension of a Basel dissertation which was completed in 1945 under the title Beitrage zur Frage der j?izdischen Tradition in der lZZ. The author says that, even though there is an abundance of literature on the LXX, there is little that takes into account the Jewish tradition. The purpose of Prijs is not to establish the readirlgs of the Yorlage of LXX, but to point out the Jewish Weltanschauung, laws, and lIaggada, with special emphasis on Jewish esegesis in the Greek version. lIe maintains that the LXS is to be understood out of the Jewish torah-centric and theocentric Weltanschauung. Accordingly he seeks to understand the Greek translation in its relation to the Hebrew text from within or from its own spirit, and not through a mechanical and purely external comparison with MT. With this approach he makes numerous comparisons with the interpretations found in the Targum, Midrash, Talmud, and mediaeval com- mentators; in many instances he also cites the Peshitta. Accordingly he seeks to explain varia- tions between LXX and MT on the basis of Jewish traditional exegesis; in other words, he holds that the textual basis of LXX is the same as that of MT. In case LXX contains a midrash which is not in the traditional literature, he supposes that it was not taken up in any special collection and that consequently it became lost. The book contains sis chapters in which the following themes are treated in this order: (1) lEalakah, (2) lIaggadah, (3) Al Tiqre Explana- tions, (4) Theology, (5) Additions in the LXX to the lIebrew Text, and (6) the LXX and the Accents of the WIasoretic Text. At the end of the book are five and one-half pages of Nachtrage followed by an indes of Biblical passages and an index of words in Greek, Ijatin, and Hebrew together with other Semitic languages. A useful</page><page sequence="2">Revi,ews of Books 305 the LXX were acquainted with the esegetical principles in vogue in their time and applied them here and there in the various books of the O. T. In his reading of the Targum of Job the reviewer found little help for the interpretation of the LXX text, and yet the Jewish principles are very apparent in the Greek version of this book; cf. his article, The Theological Approach of the Greek Translator of Job 1-1S, JBL 68 ( 1949 ) . 231-240. It should be borne in mind that in making a rendering from Hebrew into Greek the Biblical translator tried to make sense out of the passages before him. This problem has not been considered in this book. Thus in Pr. 6: 6 the observation that the I,XX employs the comparative is of no significance. Sometimes the translator obviously played with the root. A few examples will suffice to illustrate: thus in Ps. 91: 6 yasud suggested wesed 'and demon'; in Is. 57:3 'onena(h) sug- gested 'awon ' iniquity '; in IIosea 5: 11 saw was interpreted as saw'. In all these cases we can agree with Prijs that the translator had a text not dif3erent from MT. We may call this playing with words and roots the trick of the translator. In this connexion also may be considered I Sam. 20: 23, 42, where 'ad is rendered sxs, but it also suggested 'ed, which is accordingly added ad sen- sum as uaprus. Rationalization was often employed by the Greek translator, as in Gen. 37: 28, where the Midianites are identified with the Ishmaelites. In many instances good sense was produced by a free translation as in Lev. 21: 9; among sample free translations may be listed Gen. 30: 15; Ex. 2:9; Jud. 11:18; I Sam. 3:14; I :Kings 22:19; II :Kings 1: 4, 6, 16. In I Kings 18: 36 the free translation is fluent; it suggests rapid movement and is picturesque. Occasionally Prijs gives weak examples, as in Lam. 1:15; Eccl. 8:8 (p.33). In the case of Dan. 10: 6 the argument seems forced and very uncertain; perhaps fiaAavv7ys is merely a phonetic development from a trans- literation. The work of Prijs abounds in numerous good examples, but only a few can be pointed out. Thus in Es. 21: 22, 23 both I,XX and an old Halakah agree in transferring the harm done from the wife (MT) to the child. In connexion with al tiqre may be cited Es. 12: IT and Eccl. 8: 1 as signifi- cant. But it is extremely difficult to quote Scrip- tural passages from this work, because the writer goes into such great detail, and often his ultimate purpose is not quite clear. A few observations may be made on his lin- guistics. Thus the rendering of $edaqa(h) (Ps. 33: 5) by AsyourvvX is a well-known interpreta- tion. Occasionally he refers to the Latin transla- tion of LXX in the London Polyglot, but that has nothing to do with the thesis he is trying to prove. In the case of Cant. 1: 7 (p. 54) the Aramaic idiom in TOTE iS not recognized. The Hebraic Greek of LXX should have received some con- sideration. In Cant. 4: 13 (p. 39) we may regard avo(rToAai (JOV a literalistic rendering of selahaytk. It seems that avoaToAai means 'shoots' and no more. The preposition ev is often used to denote cause or means, and this is recognized on p. 43, note 3; accordingly one wonders why he indulged in such a long discussion of Ex. 29: 43 and Ps. 68: 36. On pp. 48-49 in connexion with the ren- dering sis uapTvpTov for la'ad (Micah 7: 18; Amos 1:11; Pr. 29:14), the question may be raised whether the author has not exaggerated the diffl- culty; it is possible that the translators meant to use sis ,UapTVptOV in the sense of ' for ever.' Some passages should be reconsidered by the author. On p. 26 in Esek. 28: 13, 14 'att is not doubly translated; it was read as 'et and accord- ingly rendered gucTa; crv comes from the second person suffis in htbbara'aka. On p. 32, in Job 23: 13, where we have a free translation, it is better to have Kat aVTOS represent wehX'. In regard to Gen. 15: 11 (p. 73) the question may be raised why the author sought such a difficult explana- tion; the translator had the same consonants as MT, but he vocalized his unpointed text dif3er- ently, whence Kai (rvvsKa&amp;t(JfV avroTs. In connexion with Is. 24: 23 (p. 74) the matter is very simple as explained by Schleusner and Frankel, who are quoted, but not followed. IIis comparison with Is. 30: 26, however, is misleading; if thetranslator be correct in one passage, it does not follow that he is right everywhere. The theology of the translators is of great im- portance in LXX studies, and much material in this field was assembled by C. T. Fritsch, whose dissertation The Antz-Anthropomorphtsms of the Greek Bentate1beh was published at Princeton in 1943; cf. reviews of this work by H. XI. Orlinsky, Crozer Q1barterly 21 (1944).156-160; J. Reider, JBL 43 ( 1944) . 203-205; J. A. Montgomery, Princeton Seminary Bullettn 37 (Dec., 1943).46- 47. It may be in order to make some observations on Prijs's chapter on Theologie; in consideration of the number of pages devoted to this section</page><page sequence="3">306 Reviews of Books (62-75), it may be inferred that the author rightly considers this an important element in LXX studies. Attention should be called to his com- ments (pp. 64-65) on torah-study as esemplified in Is. 50: 4 and Ps. 119: 70. On p. 67 in refer- ence to Gen. 49: 10 it appears that LXX had a Hebrew text like MT and that the Messianic interpretation was a Jewish tradition which LXX followed. In the discussion of Ex. 23.8 (p. 65), where we have a free translation, the grammatical reference is more important than the quotation from the Mechilta. In the case of Pr. 28: 24 (p.63) it seems that we are dealing simply with a free translation. In the rendition of Job 36: 5 (pp. 62-63) it appears that we have merely an influence from 8: 20. In connexion with Ps. 82: 1 (p.6) the possibility may be suggested that we have here a theological interpretation to emphasize the supremacy of God. In Ex. 1 6: 8 a murmuring against God is removed by rendering 'alaw by Ka6i' yzv. In Ex. 23 : 7 (pp.13-14) the change from the first person, which refers to God, to the second may have been made for theological reasons. In Lev. 18: 21 (pp. 14-15) the substitution of TO 3vo,ua TO (iyCOV for ' the name of thy God ' in MT, without question has a theological reason. Ezek. 48: 35 is taken up under A1 Tiqre Deutungen (pp. 44-45); MT ' The Lord is there ' is rendered in LXX by fffTaC TO 3vo,ua avs. In this connexion Prijs suggests: 'dass Kvptos durch Versehen des :K:opisten wegfiel oder gar wegen des zu kuhnen Bildes spater gestrichen wurde.' The latter possi- bility seems to be the better, but the time of the omission has to be reconsidered. It is just as probable that for theological reasons it was de- liberately left out in the original Old Greek. One observation should be made on Job 14: 14 (p. T ), where we meet a diflerent point of view in LXX from that of MT. In the latter there is a question concerning life after death, but in LXX it is pre- sented positively as a fact. In connexion with theology attention should be drawn to the discus- sion of Gen. 6: 3. Apparently the translator had the same Hebrew as MT, but by playing with the root, d un was interpreted as d ur. The author overlooks the fact that we are dealing here with an anti-anthropomorphism; it may also be noted that the Onkelos Targum in removing the anthropo- morphism goes farther than I1XX; in the Targum the spirit of God no longer is the subject. As a result of his own studies the reviewer has come to the conclusion that in the main the Hebrew Yorlage used by the Greek translators agrees with MT, but it must be admitted that there are numerous cases where it disagrees. In this connexion there should be considered the al- ternative Hebrew readings, of which there is evi- dence in the readings collated by :Kennicott and deRossi; a study of MT and LXX will bring to light others which are not represented in the manuscripts studied by these two authorities. Work has been done in this field by O. H. Bostrom, Alternative Beadings in the Hebrew of the Books of Samuel (1918); C. C. Torrey, Stray Notes on the Aramaic of Daniel and Ezra, JAOS 43 (1923). 229-238; R. Gordis, The Hebrew Text in the Mak- ing (1937); F. Zimmermann, The Perpetuation of Variants in the Masoretic Text, JQR NS 24 ( 1 944) . 459-474; J. W. Wevers, Double Readings in the Books of Kings, JBL 65 (1946).307-310, and A Study of the Hebrew Variants in the Books of Kings, ZAW 61 (1949) .43-76. A reading of this work shows that the author has not devoted sufficient attention to alternative readings. If LXX agrees with a reading of the Samaritan or with a variant or the variants in :Kennicott and deRossi in opposition to MT, we may reasonably infer that we are dealing with alternative readings. In this connexion we may cite Ex. 22: 9, 13 (p. 6); Num. 11:32 (p. 39); Deut. 20 : 6 [cf. Deut. 28 : 30 and Jer. 31: 5] ( p. 54) . On p. 66 in a discussion of Ex. 23: 8 the author derives o+@aR,uovs from Deut. 1 6: 1 9, but it should be noted that twelve mss. and the Samari- tan at this point have 'ene. In Chapter V, Hinzu- fugungen der LXX zum Hebraischen Text, the following passages should be considered as repre- sentative of alternative readings: Gen. T: 3; 8: 18; 12: 3; 21: 13; 25: 8; Ex. 1: 22; 3: 8,17; 17:11; 19:3; 23:23; 23:28; 25:37; 34:11; Lev. 1:8; 8:13; Num. 24:8; Deut. T:10. A number of other passages should also be con- sidered as possibilities of a double tradition or alternative readings: Gen. T: 1T, cf. 1 2; 8: 12, cf. 10; 17:10, cf. T; 18:13, cf. 12; 18:1T, cf. 26: 24; 25: 1 0, cf. 23: 20; 28: 1 3, cf. 1 5: 1; 29: 1, cf. 28:5b; Ex. 2:11, cf. 23; 14:11, cf. 17:3; 19: 10, cf. 21; 22: 24, cf. 25; 24:18, cf. 12; Lev. 9: 19, cf. 3: 3; Num. 17: 2, cf. 4; Deut. 2: S, 19, cf. 9. In these cases, however, the reviewer is not deciding whether we are dealing with alternative readings or with the influences from neighboring</page><page sequence="4">Reviews of Books 307 or even remote verses. At any rate, this problem will have to be faced and conclusions should be drawn in the study of the Hebrew test of each book of the O. T. Prijs's work is in the right direction. A varia- tion between LXS and MT in numerous cases is not to be explained on the assumption that a diferent Hebrew text lies behind LXX. The O. T. books were rendered into Greek at various times, and in order to find out the philosophy of transla- tion, the exegetical methods, and the theological background of the translators it will be necessary to study one book at a time to have a clear picture; Aram Naharaim: A Contribution to the Bistory of Upper MesopotamiZa in the Second Millen, nium B. C. BY ROGER T. O'CALLAGHAN, S. J. (Analaecta Orientalia 26.) Pp. xv + 164, with 3 8 plates and 3 maps. Rome: PONTIFICIUM INSTITUTUM BIBLICUM, 1948. $11.50. The subject of this study requires a broad canvas for adequate treatment. Upper Mesopotamia and the adjoining territories which is another way of saying Aram Naharaim emerged in the second millennium B. C. as the center of gravity in the an- cient Near East. Vigorous new elements ethnic, cultural, and political appear on the scene, rival- ing and eclipsing the long-established centers along the Nile and the Lower Euphrates. We are now faced with Assyrians, Kassites, Hurrians and Hittites, Canaanites and Aramaeans, either indi- vidually or in ever changing combinations. tJntil recently the principal areas in which these relative newcomers converged and clashed suffered from much obscurity owing to the paucity of source material. Today this is no longer true. Nuzi, Mari, Ugarit, and Alalavh have added vast stores of in- formation. The import of much of this is imme- diately apparent, but a great deal remains to be integrated and appraised. In these circumstances the task which Father O'Callaghan set himself was highly taxing and ambitious. Outstanding success in an undertaking of this kind could scarcely be expected of any one scholar. The book before us is the product of broad learn- ing, enormous industry, and rare enthuslasm. It is certain to be widely used. Because it involves several disciplines, readers competent in only one in this connexion more than estant traditional literature will have to be considered. In many cases the Jewish exegetical methods employed in LXX can be determined, even though they may not be extant in the traditional literature. Prijs's book shows that due caution must always be exer- cised in emending MT on the basis of LXX; in this respect he has made a significant contribution to O. T. studies. :EENRY S. GEHMAN PRINCETON THEOLOGICAL SEMINARY AND PRINCETON UNIYERSITY of these may find it difficult to approach the whole with the requisite measure of criticism. For this reason, among others, it is regrettable that the author has added to the existing complexities of his task by ranging farther afield than would seem at all constructive. By thus borrowing trouble ]ze has impaired the usefulness of a timely and badly needed study. Archaeology is properly one of the essential tools which the author employs. Yet such em- ployment appears at times to be excessive. For instance, a reference to :Eeinz Mode's Indische Fruhkulturen und ihre Beziehungen zum Westen is clearltr in order. What is questionable, however, is the conclusion as formulated by Father O'Calla- ghan and cited by him with obvious approval, that " the painted pottery culture (Buntkeramik) of North Syria and Mesopotamia was one of the greatest moulding forces of the ancient world, comparable to Egypt and lower Mesopotamia." (P. 12, n. 1.) What does this statement mean? Surely, we have learned by now that painted pot- tery as such was not a culture hut one of many ingredients in more than one individual civiliza- tion, and hence in no way on a par with a com- plete prehistoric assemblage, let alone a complex and full-bodied culture of the early historic periods. The author's handling of linguistic matters gives rise to numerous objections. Only a few of these can be cited here. In commenting on the treat- ment of the original Semitic laryngeals in Akka- dian (a needless digression in this context in any case) he states: " All laryngeals and gutturals except h were lost." (P. 23, n. 2.) Just what are "gutturals," and does h fall under either rubric?</page></plain_text>
