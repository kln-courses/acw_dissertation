<plain_text><page sequence="1">CLAY FIGURINES OF THE AMERICAN SOUTHWEST, by Noel Morss. Papers of the Peabody Museum of American Archaeology and Ethnology, Harvard University, Vol. XLIX, No. I, 1954. Pp. 73, figs. 31, I map. $3.50. This excellent and well illustrated report has as its first aim a description of the 1950 find of eleven un- fired clay figurines from a cave on Range Creek in northeastern Utah. The discovery was made by Mr. Clarence Pillings of Price, Utah, and the figurines were brought to the Peabody Museum for study, which was undertaken by Mr. Morss. Each of these figurines appears to have been made as one unit, apart from the applied clay elements (belts, necklaces, aprons, breech clouts, hairdos) which, with one exception, occur on the ventral surface, implying that these objects were viewed from the front only. During manufacture, these figurines were laid on in- verted baskets, such impressions being evident on the dorsal surfaces, which are slightly concave. Neither arms nor legs are portrayed. Sexes can be distinguished by anatomy and dress though no distinction is evident in the modeling and painting of the face. Morss judges that the figures were made by one artist, on the basis of certain idiosyncrasies in details, and he indicates that one can pair the five male figures with five of the six females by the variations in clay coloring and orna- mentation. In appraising the relation of these figurines to oth- ers in the Southwest, Morss undertakes a review of anthropomorphic figures in the Greater Southwest and a few even further removed, and also briefly discusses animal effigies and other clay objects which appear to be associated in some manner with figurines. His comparative study indicates that the Basket Maker (both II and III) figurines appear more primi- tive than those of Utah (Northern Periphery) in basic modeling and in the use of punctations instead of ap- plied elements, though there are many resemblances such as size, undecorated dorsal aspect, lack of em- phasis on mouth and lack of limbs. He also points out that specimens of Utah were used up to about A.D. IIoo, but in the Basket Maker area cease around A.D. 750 or 800, to reappear again in the late Iooo's. Figurines of the Hohokam and Mogollon, farther South, also survived up to about A.D. I0oo but differ from the northern and Basket Maker items primarily in being fired clay and exhibiting lower limbs. Eyes and occasional ornaments were applied, but otherwise ornamentation was accomplished by occasional punctat- ing or painting. The late Hohokam figurines appar- ently had perishable bodies, since only heads have been recovered. California specimens, though fired, are allied to Bas- ket Maker III types rather than the southern tradition of the Hohokam. To the East, the rarely encountered figurines of west Texas and the various types of the Mississippi Basin appear, in general, quite alien to those of the Southwest. Morss points out that most authorities feel that there is a relationship between the Mexican and South- western figurines, but that their estimates of the time of derivation from Mexico vary, due largely to the dif- ference of several hundred years between the earliest Mexican and Southwestern finds. In discussing the possible function of the human figurines, he draws on Southwestern ethnological evi- dence and archaeological inference and from both New and Old World writings. These discussions delve into increase cults, witchcraft and agricultural fertility rites, all of which exist in one form or another in various Southwestern groups today. Perhaps Morss' statement in the preface covers his conclusions most aptly: "No doubt the precise parts played by these objects in the various cultures producing them varied at least as widely as the interpretations which have been sug- gested." His treatment of the data is thorough, and perhaps future finds may furnish the answers to several ques- tions which he raises concerning time, relationships and diffusion. This report is another welcome trait study such as the Southwest sorely needs. ALBERT H. SCHROEDER. NATIONAL PARK SERVICE, GLOBE, ARIZONA</page></plain_text>
