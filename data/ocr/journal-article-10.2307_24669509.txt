Unlike other Second Temple texts, which discuss what idols are, how they were created by human hands, why they exist, and how they can be destroyed, Bel et Draco focuses on only one of the characteristics of the idols that will lead to their demise: their ability or inability to dis tinguish between and consume different types of food. This motif becomes so important for Bel et Draco that it is used in connection with almost every character appearing in the story. How this literary device is used in the description of the fate of the characters and in the establishment of a hierarchy between them is the topic of this article.' 1. Introduction Bel Bel et Draco is an apocryphal addition to the Book of Daniel} As a work of Second Temple Judaism, Bel et Draco makes the intentional destruction of two idols by a human being the main topic of its narrative. ' I presented a shorter version of this article at the 2003 International Meeting of the Society of Biblical Literature in Cambridge. 2 The text of Bel et Draco is most likely based on a Hebrew or Aramaic original that no longer exists (the medieval Aramaic manuscript of the Chronicle of Jerahmeel might contain a descendent of the Hebrew Vorlage). No Jewish writer quotes from Bel et Draco, nor was any of it found at Qumran. The Greek text of Bel et Draco exists in two ver sions: the Old Greek (G/OG or LXX) and Theodotion (Th). The text of the Septuagint version is only preserved in a few manuscripts such as the Syrian translation of the Hexapla by Origin (Syh) and the Codex Chisianus from the 11 th century (88).

On the one hand, the ability to eat brings death not only to the sacred ani mal4 but also to the priests who secretly eat the food items provided for Bel. The lion,s ability to eat causes the death of Daniel's enemies at the end of the story. But the same ability to eat can also save lives, namely, the life of Daniel who receives food after being in the lion's pit. On the other hand, the inability to eat brings about the demise of Bel. But in the case of the lions, the inability to eat saves Daniel's life when he is trapped in their pit. How Bel et Draco plays with the motif of the ability/inability to eat as determining life and death will be the topic of this paper. It will be shown that this motif is not only a a coincidental feature of each part of Bel et Draco but is used as a con scious literary device in the description of the fate of the characters and the establishment of a hierarchy between them. Christian times, the Th translation became more prevalent and is the one that is quoted by the early Church Fathers who considered Bel et Draco to be canonical. Theories about the place and date of composition are far-reaching and cover the areas of Egypt, Babylonia, and Palestine as well as the centuries between the Persian and Hellenistic periods. All portions from Bel et Draco in this paper are quoted according to Ziegler (1999). 3 The importance of the ability/inability to eat as determining life and death in Bel et et Draco was also observed by others but was not commented on in detail, cf. Moore (1977, 118): "So it was that Bel was proven to be a false god because he could not eat, and the snake was proven to be a false god because it did eat — and died from it!"; and cf. Collins (1993, 414): "The story is a parody of idol worship, taking one idol that is lifeless and cannot eat and a second that is alive but is killed precisely by eating." 4 Bel et Draco's OG and Th call this creature δράκων, a noun that LXX elsewhere uses to translate various creatures of land and sea as well as mythological creatures (עתור׳ם ,לויתן ,פתן ,נחש ,תנים, and כפירים). In Bel et Draco, it refers to a large, living, and probably serpent-like animal. There is evidence for the worship of snakes in Egypt and Greece, for example at the temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus, but none for Babylonia. The two common translations "dragon" or "snake" will be avoided in this paper because the former is too mythological for a creature that was imagined by Bel et Draco as his torical, and the latter is too biological for an animal inspiring awe and fear among the people worshipping it.</page><page sequence="3">264 CLAUDIA BERGMANN 2. Idols in the Hebrew Bible and Second Temple Literature The The Oral Abilities of Idols In the Hebrew Bible, idols are described as something made by human hands that displays no signs of being alive. Idols do not have the senses of seeing, hearing, smelling, or feeling.3 They cannot move or walk, and have to be carried and set into place.6 Just like any life less statue, idols need to be secured in their place by the artisan so that they do not topple.7 Some of the idols refuted in the Hebrew Bible appear to have the anthropomorphic feature of a mouth, but they can not use it for the basic functions of speaking, eating or breathing.8 In Second Temple period texts, idols are still described as being made by humans from mundane materials and are still considered to be life less.9 Idols are again said not to have any sensory abilities10 such as seeing or hearing, smelling or feeling. Their lack of oral abilities (speak ing and eating),11 however, never appears as a major theme in Second Temple texts until Bel et Draco. The Ancient Near Eastern worshippers placed food in front of their idols to "feed" them. It was apparently a known and accepted prac tice that the king and the priests received the "leftovers" of those meals 5 Seeing: ולא ״ראו / και ούκ οψονται. Dtr 4:28, Ps 115:5, 135:16, similarly Dan 5:23. Hearing: ולא ישמעו / και ούκ άκούσονται. Dtr 4:28, Ps 115:6, similarly 1 Ki 18:27, Dan 5:23. Smelling: |VTT ולא / και ούκ όσφραν&amp;ησονται.

Instead, the king is portrayed as believing that all of the food is consumed by Bel and as absolutely gullible to the priests' deceptions. This unlikely naivete of the king serves a heightening and ironic purpose, without which the story of Bel et et Draco would not work as well. It also portrays the king in a very positive light adding to the ease with which Daniel is able to convince him of the lifelessness of the idols and to the general positive attitude of the king towards the Jewish hero, Daniel. Unlike other Gentile kings, the king in Bel et Draco does not consume idol food and is even unaware of the fact that idol food is served to the priests. This positive por trayal of the king indeed reflects a positive attitude of Bel et Draco's author toward foreign rulers and would support the suggestion that Bel et et Draco was written either before the time of Antiochus Epiphanes and the Maccabean Revolt or during the Diaspora when the conversion of the Gentile ruler by faithful Jews was seen as a possible goal.13 Thus, while the ancient readers must have been aware of the true consumers of the idol food, Bel et Draco's king was not, and only after Daniel's investigation, the priests are proven to be the culprits who eat and drink the food provided for Bel. Second Temple literature also discusses a new concern that reflects a practice mostly known from Egypt — zoolatry. The Letter of Aristeas 138, for example, calls zoolatry a foolishness by "Egyptians and those like them, who have put their confidence in beasts and most of the serpents and monsters, worship them, and sacrifice to them both while alive and dead." A second example, Wisdom of Solomon 15:18-19, describes the "enemies and oppressors of your people" as the ones who "wor ship the most hateful beasts" who are more "brutish" than the lifeless hand-made idols and aesthetically unpleasing. In the case of zoolatry, the powerful arguments that idols are made by human hands and do not display the characteristics of a living creature no longer hold. Wor shipped animals are obviously alive and display signs of their aliveness 12 Cf. Burkert (1987, 46): "Feeding the gods has become a conspicuous ceremony in the temples of Mesopotamia and Egypt; since the gods do not consume the food offered to them, it remains available for their minors, and 'migrating offerings' finally reach a hierarchy of beneficiaries; the offerings thus form the basis for economic accumulation and redistribution." 13 Collins (1993, 418). Cf. 3 Macc, Esther.</page><page sequence="5">266 CLAUDIA BERGMANN in that they, unlike the created idols, eat and drink the food provided for them. Bel et Draco addresses the question of the oral abilities of the sacred animals and proves that they also cannot save themselves from destruction just as the human-made idols were unable to save them selves from harm. Bel et Draco proves that sacred animals can be killed by using the exact fact that, although they are alive and have mouths that can eat, they do not have the ability to realize that the food served to them might be lethal. The The The Destruction of Idols The idols of the Hebrew Bible are described as lifeless and unable to help or save their devotees. Sometimes, the powers of an idol are seen as being so non-existent that idols cannot even save themselves when faced with possible harm such as destruction by fire.14 It is impor tant to note that the destruction of idols in the Hebrew Bible is inti mately connected to God's prohibition of idolatry. It is either God himself or people acting on God's behalf and under God's command who harm the idols of the Hebrew Bible.10 Nowhere do human agents act out of their own will based on their own understanding that idols are made by hand, that they are lifeless, powerless, cannot compare to God, and therefore have no right to exist. Only in Second Temple Judaism will this understanding be developed. In Second Temple texts, idols perish either because of the wear-and-tear of the elements on them or their own inability to save themselves.16 In a few texts, they are still said to be destroyed by God or God's agent or suddenly dis appear at the end as they appeared in the beginning.17 The most impressive and elaborated texts, however, feature the enlightened human being18 as the main agent of destruction who realizes that idols are 14 Ex 32:20 (the burning of the Golden Calf by Moses), Isa 44:9-20 (the idol can burn like the log of firewood that came from the same tree), 1 Ki 15:13, 2 Ki 19:18/Isa 37:19 (idols burn up during a war). 15 Destruction by God's ark: 1 Sa 5:1-5; future destruction by God: Isa 2:18, 44:9.11, Ez 30:13, Mi 1:7, 5:13-14; people acting on behalf of God: Ex 32:20, Jdg 6:25-26, 2 Ki 19:8/Isa 37:19, 1 Chr 14:12. 16 ApAbr 3:5-6, 4:5, 6:13.17, Epjer 1:11.20.48, WisSol 14:8. " 17 Destroyed by God: WisSol 14:11, Jub 48:5. Destroyed by God's agent: In Jub 31:2, Jacob takes great care to burn, crush, and destroy the idols of Laban and hides the remains of them under a tree. 1 Macc 5:68 might also fall under this category. Sudden disappearance: WisSol 14:13-14. 18 The destruction can also be done by a careless person such as in ApAbr 1:9, 2:4, 3:7.</page><page sequence="6">267 THE ABILITY/INABILITY TO EAT pointless, powerless, lifeless, and accomplish nothing. In Jubilees 12:12 14, for example, Abraham19 intentionally burns the house of the idols and the idols themselves. This destruction is planned and done in the middle of the night to avoid disturbance. In the Apocalypse of Abraham 2:9, Abraham intentionally throws the idols into the water where he watches them drown. In ApAbr 5, Abraham intentionally puts the wooden god Barisat next to a fire, mocks him, and allows him to burn with the firewood. The reading of the Apocalypse of Abraham affords the reader the opportunity to recreate Abraham's learning experience by presenting two common-sense ways of how everyone could "test" whether idols are alive. In Bel et Draco, then, Daniel proves that Bel and the sacred animal are not gods by finding two other common-sense ways of test ing whether idols have any powers both focusing on the idols' alleged oral abilities. Daniel proves that Bel might have a mouth but does not eat and that the animal can eat but is unable to determine whether the food is lethal. Aside from presenting "tests" for the abilities of the idols, the Apocalypse of Abraham and Bel et Draco are also similar in that they portray laughing heroes who mock both the powerless idols and the people who believe in them. 3. The Ability/Inability to Eat in Bel et Draco Bel Bel et Draco still uses traditional material when it describes the qual ities of the idols and their destruction. Yet, it elaborates on the received material in previously unexplored ways. Out of the various traditional ways to describe idols, it lifts up a) the idol's inability to eat as proof for its power- and lifelessness, and b) the animal's ability to eat but its lack of knowledge that would allow it to be able to distinguish between nourishing and harmful food as proof of its profane nature. In fact, Bel Bel et Draco in both of its versions, makes the ability or inability to eat a hallmark of its narrative utilizing it not only in its description of the destiny of the idols but also in the telling of the heroic story of Daniel and the stories of the supporting cast (the priests and their ilk, the prophet Habakkuk, the lions). Food, in fact, and the ability or inability to eat it, become the determining factor of death and life in Bel et Draco. 19 The topic of Abraham rejecting idolatry is taken up again in BiblAnt 6-7 where Abraham refuses to take part in the construction of the Tower of Babel and thus renounces idolatry. Subsequently, he is thrown into a fiery furnace from which he is able to escape alive. In BiblAnt, this rejection of idolatry is the cause for God's bless ing on Abraham and his family.</page><page sequence="7">268 CLAUDIA BERGMANN The The Bel Idol Idol Th 3και ήν εϊδωλον τοις Βαβυλωνίοις φ δνομα Βηλ καϊ έδαπανώντο εις αύτδν εκάστης ημέρας σεμιδάλεως άρτάβαι δώδεκα και πρόβατα τεσσαράκοντα καϊ οίνου μετρη ταί εξ 6καϊ είπεν αύτώ δ βασιλεύς ού δοκεϊ σοι Βηλ είναι ζών θεός ή ούχ οράς οσα έσθίει και πίνει καθ' έκάστην ήμέραν 'και είπεν Δανιήλ γελάσας μη πλανώ βασιλεΰ ούτος γαρ έσωθεν μέν έστι πηλός έξωθεν δέ χαλκός και ού βέβρωκεν ούδέ πέπωκεν πώποτε 8και θυμωθείς ό βασιλεύς έκάλεσεν τούς ιερείς αύτοΰ και είπεν αύτοΐς έάν μη ε'ίπητέ μοι τίς ό κατέσθων την δαπάνην ταύτην άποθανεϊσθε έάν δέ δείξητε δτι Βηλ κατεσθίει αύτά άποθανείται Δανιήλ δτι έβλασφήμησεν εις τον Βηλ . σύ δέ βασιλεΰ παράθες τά βρώματα και τόν οίνον κεράσας θες και άπόκλει σον την θύραν και σφράγισον τω δακ τυλίφ σου και έλθών πρωί έάν μη εύρης πάντα βεβρωμένα ύπό τοϋ Βηλ άπο θανούμεθα ή Δανιήλ δ ψευδόμενος καθ' ημών OG 3και ήν ε'ίδωλον βηλ δ έσέβοντο οί βαβυλώνιοι άνηλίσκετο δέ αύτφ καθ' έκάστην ήμέραν σεμιδάλεως άρτάβαι δέκα δύο και πρόβατα τέσσαρα και έλαίου μετρηταί εξ 7και είπεν αύτώ Δανιήλ μηδαμώς μηδείς σε παραλογιζέσθω ούτος γάρ έσωθεν μέν πήλινος έστιν έξωθεν δέ χαλκούς όμνύω δέ σοι κύριον τδν θεδν των θεών δτι ούθέν βέβρωκε πώποτε ούτος 8και θυμωθείς ό βασιλεύς έκάλεσε τούς προεστηκότας τοΰ ιερού και είπεν αύτοΐς παραδείξατε τδν έσθίοντα τά παρασκευα ζόμενα τω Βηλ εί δέ μή γε άποθανεϊσθε ή Δανιήλ ό Φάσκων μή έσθίεσθαι αύτά ύπ' αύτοΰ οί δέ είπαν αύτδς δ Βηλ έστίν δ κατεσθίων αύτά 9είπε δέ Δανιήλ πρδς τδν βασιλέα γινέσθω ούτως ούτως έάν μή παραδείξω δτι ούκ έστιν ό Βηλ ό κατεσθίων ταύτα άποθανοΰμαι και πάντες οί παρ' έμοΰ . . .

While the king and all the Babylonians worship it because of its alleged ability to eat the gifts provided for it (OG+Th 6),20 Daniel replies that Bel is made from clay and bronze (OG+Th 7) and is certainly not the one who consumes the offerings. OG's series of verbs used for Bel's eating in the initial dialogues between Daniel and the king as well as the king and the priests respectively is δαπανάω — βιβρώσκω — έσθίω — έσθίω — κατεσθίω. It is interesting to note that the king uses the rather neutral but rare δαπανάω when speaking with 20 OG 6 is careful to avoid the actual words "eating" and "drinking" but uses the passive of δαπανάω "is spent (on him)" instead.</page><page sequence="8">269 THE ABILITY/INABILITY TO EAT Daniel but the common and concrete verb έσθίω when speaking to his priests. Daniel, however, uses the less common verbs βιβρώσκω and κατεσθίω, the latter of which is never used by the Septuagint for human consumption but rather describes a devouring by wild animals or by fire. In Th, the chain of verbs used for Bel's eating in both initial dia logues is έσθίω/πίνω — βιβρώσκω/πίνω — κατεσθίω — κατεσθίω. When the king first addresses Daniel, he describes Bel's eating with the com mon verbs έσθίω and πίνω that are used for human consumption. Daniel replies by addressing both "eating" and "drinking" but changes to βιβρώσκω and πίνω. In his dialogue with the priests, the king then describes Bel's eating with a double κατεσθίω avoiding the verb έσθίω. None of the characters in this first part of the story claim or dispute that Bel has a mouth of any other anthropomorphic features. The fact that OG and Th use no less than four verbs for Bel's "eating," many of them uncommon, leaves the reader with the impression that Bel's "eating" is indeed unusual. The food items provided for Bel are somewhat different in OG and Th. In OG 3, it is twelve measures of σεμίδαλις "fine wheat flour," four sheep, and six measures of oil. Later on, wine is also mentioned in addition to the other food items. In Th 3, it is the same amount of flour but forty sheep and six measures of wine. It appears that the food items provided for Bel are both in the raw state (flour) and maybe also in the cooked or prepared state (sheep, wine/oil). It is interesting to note that the meat for Bel is not explicitly described as cooked, boiled, or prepared as a burned sacrifice. Since "raw and cooked in the Hebrew Bible clearly serve as markers of culture and civilization"21 this choice of food items shows that Bel is not on the same level with the Hebrew God who only receives cooked/burned sacrificial meat. In addition to that, there is no mention of utensils or containers for food preparation indicating that the food items provided for Bel are not as carefully prepared as the food that Daniel will receive from Habakkuk later in the story.22 While some people believe that the idol "eats," the choice of words proves that it is an uncommon, less "civilized" eating, sometimes even a "devouring" of food items that are somewhat pre pared or even raw. Bel's destiny is thus foreshadowed in the word choices made when the idol is first described. 21 Brenner and van Henten (1999, XI). 22 Note Levi-Strauss's (1969) thoughts on raw vs. cooked as representing nature vs. culture.</page><page sequence="9">270 CLAUDIA BERGMANN The story continues with a detective-like element23 as Daniel devises a plan to prove that it is the priests who eat the gifts provided for the idol. After the food items are presented before Bel — in Th 14, it even is the king himself who sets the tables — Daniel's men set the trap and the door is sealed. As the betrayal is revealed, Bel's abilities or inabilities are no longer discussed. In OG 22, it is the king who overturns Bel. In Th 22, the king first hands over Bel to Daniel who then destroys the idol and his sanctuary. Unlike the idol texts in the Hebrew Bible or in other Second Temple texts, it is Bel's proven inability to eat (and drink) that leads to its demise. No other common-sense tests such as burning the idol or floating it in water [Apocalypse of Abraham) or rationalization of its hum ble origins as in the Hebrew Bible idol texts are needed. In Bel et Draco, the idol's inability to eat is the one and only factor necessary to show that Bel is powerless and worthless.

OG chooses the verbs κατεσθίω and έκπίνω highlighting the animal like greed of the priest's consumption. Th 12 adds the verb άναλόω which is related to the hapax legomenon αναλίσκω that was previously used by OG to describe the alleged consumption of offerings by Bel. The food items consumed by the priests are of course the ones origi nally provided for Bel. Two details about the food should be men tioned. First, OG adds the note that the priests also drank wine which was not in the original list of the offerings provided for the idol.24 It is possible that OG added this detail three times in order to further emphasize the frivolous character of the priests. Second, Th has 40 instead of four sheep that are originally placed before Bel but then consumed by the priests and their families. This small detail could have been Th's attempt to show that the priests were excessive meat-eaters which was generally frowned upon in antiquity.25 There is no indica tion that the priests further prepared the food items that they found or that they used any utensils or containers so that it becomes clear to the reader that the priests eat 1) raw food and 2) idol food. The first just puts them on a lower civilized level than Daniel who later eats in the most cultured way possible, but the second is an abomi nation against Jewish law. A few similarities between the destiny of the priests in Bel et Draco and other texts from the Second Temple period should be mentioned. In Second Temple texts, it is common that the makers and worship pers of idols are destroyed like their creations. In Jub 12:12-14, for example, the idol worshipper Haran dies with his idols when Abraham burns them. In ApAbr 8:4, God warns Abraham to leave his father so that he "too may not be slain in the sins" of his father's house. In EpjerEpjer 1:48, idols and their priests are said to be in the same kinds of danger and have to hide together in order to survive. The Epistle of Jeremiah also describes a situation of priests abusing the offerings given 24 Wine was mentioned in Th's original list of offerings for Bel, but the priests are never accused of drinking it specifically. It is a "civilized" drink but only when con sumed in a controlled way. Herodotus (6.84) already ridiculed the Scythians for con suming it in access thus proving themselves to be savages. Another difference between OG and Th is that Th emphasizes and notes explicitly than it is the priests and their families who consume the offerings. In OG, the families are mentioned but remain somewhat in the background. 23 Cf. Garnsey (1999, 124) on Roman attitudes toward meat-eating albeit somewhat later than our text.</page><page sequence="11">272 CLAUDIA BERGMANN to the idol by people of good faith similar to the one in Bel et Draco. In Epjer 1:33, priests take some of the clothing provided for the dress ing of the idol in order to clothe their own women and children. While Bel Bel et Draco takes up the tradition of the destruction of idol worship pers with their creations and alludes to the claim of priests abusing the offerings that is also made in the Epistle of Jeremiah, it goes beyond these works by lifting up the ability to eat as the most important reason for the priests' death. Through the choice of vocabulary, the priests are put on the same level as Bel foreshadowing their similar fate. They are portrayed as "eating" or rather "devouring" the raw or litde-pre pared food items that were originally provided for the idol. But unlike Bel's inability to eat, it is their ability to eat that will lead to their demise. Like the sacred animal, they are able to eat and do so with out being able to determine whether the food they consume is appro priate for them. While it is not lethal food per se, it becomes lethal when their betrayal is discovered. In OG 22, the king hands them over to Daniel to a fate not described in any detail. In Th 22, they are killed by the king himself. The The Sacred Animal OG 24 και εΐπεν ό βασιλεύς τω Δανιήλ μή και τοϋτον έρεΐς δτι χαλκούς έστιν ιδού ζη και έσθίει και πίνει προσκύνησον αύτω 27καί λαβών ό Δανιήλ πίσσης μνάς τριά κοντά και στέαρ και τρίχας ηψησεν έπί τό αϋτό καί έποίησε μάζαν και ένέβαλεν είς τό στόμα του δράκοντος καί φαγών διερράγη ...

It was shown that zoolatry presented a new challenge to texts want ing to prove that worshipped animals, though obviously alive, were still not divine beings. The sacred animal in Bel et Draco appears to have all the characteristics of a living being. It has a mouth and some kind of digestive system and, as the king points out in OG 24, lives, eats, and drinks, and is not made from bronze.26 Both OG and Th, however, 26 24και εΐπεν ό βασιλεύς τφ Δανιήλ μή και τοΰτον έρεΐς οτι χαλκούς έστιν ιδού ζτ! και έσθίει και πίνει...</page><page sequence="12">THE ABILITY/INABILITY TO EAT 273 make certain word choices that already indicate that the creature's aliveness is not automatically to be equated with a divine nature. OG, for example, mentions that the Babylonians worship the animal, but the king never calls it a god per se. Here, "eating and drinking" is only equated with "living." Th 24 has the king call the animal a "liv ing god" and thus goes beyond OG but never states on what this argu ment is based. "Eating and drinking" are not pointed out as signs of its aliveness. The words that denote the animal's "eating" are the common έσθίω as well as πίνω which were used by the king in Th to describe Bel's eating to Daniel. It also seems at the outset that the animal is being served a "civilized" cooked meal because Daniel is pictured as boiling together (OG+Th 27, εψω) several ingredients. The same verb is again used later on in the story when Habakkuk boils a meal which will be delivered to Daniel. While the eating habits of the sacred animal are initially described in terms reminiscent of human consumption, the story here makes a radical turn when revealing the ingredients of the cooked meal: pitch, fat, and hair. This lethal concoction has inspired the inter est of ancient and modern interpreters. Of the ancient interpreters, B'reshithB'reshith Rabbah 68 adds the idea that Daniel also hid nails within the boiled mass making it even more deadly. Josephus ben Gonon speaks of iron combs that were added by the hero of the story. Jerusalem Nedanm 37d explains that the sacred animal in Bel et Draco was also fed camel skins filled with burning coals. Among the more modern interpreters, Hermann Gunkel sees connections to the Babylonian myth Enuma Elish in which the goddess Tiamat swallows 'God Wind' who destroys her inside.27 While Gunkel's allusions to the death of Tiamat and the ancient embellishments of the animal's cause of death are certainly intriguing, it is most noticeable and important that there is no other story in the Hebrew Bible or in Second Temple literature where a sacred animal is destroyed by something it is fed. Zoolatry is not a common topic in general, and neither the Letter of Aristeas 138 nor Wisdom of Solomon 27 Gunkel, Η. Schopfung wnd Chaos in Urzeit und Endznt. (1895). For a discussion of this and related views, see Moore (1977, 123f.). Following Gunkel, Zimmermann (1958, 440) suggest a complicated linguistic process in which the Babylonian term for wind saru was translated into the Aramaic term סערא / סעדאת translated as both "wind" and "bar ley" which was later rendered into Greek as μάζα and also misunderstood as סערחא meaning "hair." Moore (1977, 143) convincingly shows that the same linguistic process could have also happened with a Hebrew Vorlage.</page><page sequence="13">274 CLAUDIA BERGMANN 15:1 15:18f. deal with the question how it can be proven that these ani mals are not gods. The only other roughly contemporary text that might be of interest isjosephus' Against Apion 1.22: 201-204, where the Jewish bowman Mosollamus kills a bird thereby proving that it could not tell its own future. In a humorous and interesting twist of the story, Daniel thus uses the crux presented by zoolatry, the animal's ability to eat, to prove the creature's powerlessness. Like the bird in Against Apion, the sacred ani mal in Bel et Draco is not able to predict its own future. It eats the food not knowing that it will actually be killed by it. Bel et Draco here plays with different levels of comparisons and contrasts. On the lin guistic level, the animal is compared to Daniel who also eats (έσθίω) a boiled (εψω) meal but in contrast to the animal survives because of it. On a second level, the animal is also compared to the priests because neither they nor the animal have the intelligence or the power to real ize that eating food will lead to their demise. On a third level, the animal is compared to Bel because both are idols revered by the Babylonians and proven to be powerless using food. In contrast to Bel, the animal can eat but it is exactly this ability that kills it. HabakkukHabakkuk and Daniel While Habakkuk is only a minor character in the overall story of Bel Bel et Draco, he becomes an important mediator when seen in light of the food and eating imagery in Bel et Draco.w Because the stories of the chef Habakkuk and Daniel, the recipient of the meal, are so inter twined at this point, they will be discussed here together.

Obviously, both Daniel and Habakkuk are human beings and consume food suitable for humans. Both versions of Bel et Draco go to great lengths to portray Habakkuk's preparation of the meal and Daniel's consumption of it in such a way that there is no longer any doubt that the two of them are the most advanced and cultured personali ties in the story. The fact that Daniel eats (and drinks) only food items prepared by Habakkuk but is never shown as eating and drinking with anybody else in the story also guarantees that the meal he consumes is prepared according to the Jewish food laws and has not been in contact with idol worshippers or idol food items. Daniel's eating is described with the verb έσθίω. Although he must have starved after six days without food and water in the lion's pit, he simply "eats" when Habakkuk provides him with food. This is a stark contrast to the greedy κατεσθίω "devouring" and έκπίνω "drinking (to the last drop)" by the priests who are fed regularly and plentifully by the unsuspecting Babylonians. The food Daniel receives is also of high est civilized quality. According to OG 33, it is a boiled meal (εψήμα)29 in a large container (σκάφη) in which bread (άρτος) has been crumbled (ένθρύπτω). Th 33 uses the same dense collection of terms from the semantic field "eating" and "food" and adds the note that Habakkuk himself boiled (εψω) the stew. OG 33 features the additional note that Habakkuk also provided a jar (στάμνας) of mixed wine (οϊνος κεκ ερασμένος). This menu is a departure from the cooked (εψω) yet lethal food fed to the snake or the raw and/or not explicitly prepared food items given to Bel and eaten by the priests. Habakkuk's stew becomes a τό άριστον, a "meal/feast," when given to Daniel. It is carefully pre pared and transported in containers designated for food in a way that ״־״־ The same term, but in the form εψεμα, also appears in Gen 25:29 (LXX) for Jacob's stew and II Ki 4:38 (LXX) for the stew boiled for the prophets at the request of Elisha. Both of these stews determine the destiny of the ones who eat them.</page><page sequence="15">276 CLAUDIA BERGMANN lifts up the civilized character of Daniel and Habakkuk and lets the food received by the other entities in the story pale in comparison. The The Lions Th 32ήσαν δέ έν τω λάκκφ έπτά λέοντες καί έδίδετο αύτοΐς την ήμέραν δύο σώματα και δυο πρόβατα τότε δέ ούκ εδόθη αύτοΐς ϊνα καταφάγωσιν τον Δανιήλ 42και άνέσπασεν αύτόν τούς δέ αιτίους της άπωλείας αύτοΰ ένέβαλεν εις τον λάκκον και κατεβρώθησαν παραχρήμα ενώπιον αύτοΰ OG 31ήν δέ λάκκος έν φ έτρέφοντο λέοντες έπτά οίς παρεδίδοντο οί έπίβουλοι τοϋ βα σιλέως και έχορηγεϊτο αύτοΐς καθ' έκά στην ήμέραν των έπιθανατίων σώματα δύο και ένεβάλοσαν τον Δανιήλ 01 δχλοι εις εκείνον τόν λάκκον ϊνα καταβρωθή και μηδέ ταφής τύχη και ήν έν τφ λάκκφ Δανιήλ ήμέρας εξ 2και έξήγαγεν ό βασιλεύς τόν Δανιήλ έκ τοϋ λάκκου και τούς αιτίους τής άπωλείας αύτοΰ ένέβαλεν εις τόν λάκκον ενώπιον τοΰ Δανιήλ και κατεβρώθησαν The lions in Bel et Draco are the creatures with which the text's focus on the ability or inability to eat as determining life and death can once more be shown. In the cast of the story, they are neutral players. There is no question about whether they are dead or alive and they are expected to act according to the habits of wild carnivores. Since they are animals, their eating/feeding is described with the fitting verbs τρέφω and καταβιβρώσκω. The feed they receive is raw, possibly even alive, and in the most unprepared and uncivilized state. However, while they are feared as some of the most dangerous ani mals, they once choose to not eat the human being Daniel and thus save his life even though this behavior is against their nature. As they come into play a second time at the end of Bel et Draco, they behave as expected and devour their victims. The verb βιβρώσκω that had pre viously been used for the priests devouring the offerings designated for Bel is now heightened in intensity by a prefix and used as καταβιβρώσκω for a laconic description of the death of Daniel's enemies. Thus, Bel et Draco's Draco's lions symbolize what Bel et Draco wanted to show with its focus on eating and food. In Daniel's case, the lions' inability to eat saves the hero's life. In the case of Daniel's enemies, however, the lions' ability to eat brings death. In Daniel's case, they wisely refrain from</page><page sequence="16">THE ABILITY/INABILITY TO EAT 277 eating, in the case of Daniel's enemies they become animals again who devour raw meat. This episode in Bel et Draco is similar to the canonical Dan 6 where Daniel is also thrown into a lion's pit by the foreign king upon the request of Daniel's enemies. It is either possible that both stories devel oped independently out of an older tradition that portrays Daniel as saved from the lion's pit or that the Dan 6 story was the model for the episode in Bel et Draco?" Some of the differences between the two stories could be explained when Bel et Draco's focus on eating as deter mining life and death is kept in mind. First, the lions in Bel et Draco are more clearly portrayed as being hungry. While Dan 6 has none such details, Bel et Draco explicidy mentions that the pit contained seven lions who daily received the bodies of two humans (OG 32) or two humans and two sheep (Th). Th 32 even adds that the lions had been starved for food so that they would eat Daniel. Second, the lions have their new food, Daniel, with them in the pit for more than just one night as was the case in Dan 6 but for six days and nights, which must have further increased their hunger.31 However, the Daniel of Bel et et Draco does not appear to be concerned about the starving lions, and no explanation is given why they did not devour Daniel. Instead, Daniel praises God only when Habakkuk and his food arrive. Designating Habakkuk's meal for Daniel is the proof that God had been on his side, not the protection from the wild animals. 4. Conclusion Eating and drinking are a biological necessity for all living beings and are activities that bear rich symbolism. Each culture has rules and reg ulations about food consumption and beneficial or taboo food items. Eating and drinking together can create community within a culture, lack of communal eating creates distance. What and how a person eats and drinks may determine their status, define and protected their iden tity, and distinguish them from others. What and how a person eats 30 Cf. Collins (1993, 411). For the lions' pit as a Babylonian metaphor for the hos tilitytility and competition among the scholars at court, see van der Toorn (1998). 31 A third difference that can be attributed to Bel et Draco's focus on eating and food is that the lions of Bel et Draco actually devour Daniel's enemies while the lions in Dan 6:25 break the enemies' bones and kill them while a devouring of their bodies is not mentioned: ml οί λέοντες άπέκτειναν αΰτοΰς και εθλασαν τά οστά αύτών.</page><page sequence="17">278 CLAUDIA BERGMANN and drinks is boundary marking.32 The short story of Bel et Draco is a point in case. Here, the motif of the ability/inability to eat (and drink) was first and foremost used for the refutation of the idols' abilities thus binding together two stories of idol destructions that could have stood on their own. It was also used as a boundary marker defining almost all of the characters in the story and establishing a hierarchy between them. Many anthropologists dealing with the importance and symbol ism of food in societies compile lists of intentions, feelings, and/or attributes associated with certain food practices. Grimm's list33 is one example, and it can be seen that almost all of the items on her list can be found expressed in Bel et Draco further underlining that the abil ity/inability to eat is more than a coincidental occurrence and has become the factor for determining life and death: Functions of Food in Bel et Draco 1) the priests and their families form a community by eating the idol food items 2) the priests' consumption of the idol food demonstrates their low status to the reader of Bel et Draco 3) the consumption of the idol food by the priests is the only characteristic expressed about them 4) Habakkuk brings food to Daniel, God initiates the contact between Habakkuk and Daniel 5) Daniel's eating habits separate him from all of the other characters in Bel et et Draco 6) the Jewish Daniel distinguishes himself from the Babylonians by what and how he eats 7) all characters show their allegiances to a certain faith and its food practices by what and how they eat The Cultural Functions of Food 1) initiates and maintains personal and business relationships 2) demonstrates the nature and extent of relationships 3) provides a focus for communal activities 4) expresses love and caring 5) expresses individuality 6) proclaims the separateness of a group 7) demonstrates belonging to a group 32 Cf. Garnsey (1999, XI): "Food serves to bind people together linked by blood, religion of citizenship; conversely, it is decisive, being distributed and consumed in accord ance with existing hierarchies." 33 Grimm (1996, 5).</page><page sequence="18">THE ABILITY/INABILITY TO EAT 279 9) food and eating determine life and death 15) Daniel eats the right food and thus separates himself physically and spir itually from the idol worshippers 17) Bel et Draco expresses right and wrong, good and bad, by the food and eat ing choices of its characters 8) helps cope with psychological stress 9) is a reward or a punishment 10) signifies social status or wealth 11) bolsters self-esteem and helps gain recognition 12) wields political or economical power 13) prevents, diagnoses, or treats illness 14) symbolizes emotional experiences 15) displays piety 16) represents security 17) expresses moral sentiments The motif of eating or not eating as determining life and death is something that holds the different parts of Bel et Draco together. This motif clearly serves the purpose of weaving one consistent narrative out of two idol confrontation stories and one story portraying Daniel in the lions' pit as a result of these successful confrontations. While the ability or inability of idols to speak and eat had been part of discussions about idols in earlier literature, oral abilities have never led to the idol's demise. By paralleling the destinies of the lifeless Bel idol and the liv ing sacred animal, Bel et Draco now proves that their oral abilities or inabilities do not matter for their future destiny: they both will be destroyed. Idolatry and zoolatry can both be defeated. Bel et Draco draws out the motif even further by showing that the destiny of the idol wor shippers and the destiny of Daniel, the worshipper of the true God, are also determined by their ability to eat. On the basis of the study of the semantic field of food and eating in Bel et Draco, the intentional and consistent use of the motif by the author of Bel et Draco is obvious. There does not appear to be a significant difference in the impor tance of this motif for OG and Th. OG and Th use about the same number of terms for food and eating, OG has the slightly higher num ber (38 vs. 34 in Th). While OG and Th alter their exact choice of words at times, the terms for food and eating applied to the different characters are almost equally distributed in OG and Th:34 a slightly higher emphasis on the difference and drink but dies because of it, and Daniel a result. 34 It seems that OG wanted to put between the sacred animal who can eat who also can eat and drink but lives as</page><page sequence="19">280 CLAUDIA BERGMANN Bel priests/enemies sacred animal Daniel/Habakkuk lions OGOG 13 5 6 11 3 ThTh 13 5 4 8 4 This leads to the conclusion that the importance of food and eating/ not eating was an element of the Vorlage that was not added by OG or Th. The motif of the ability/inability to eat as determining life and death is used to establish several distinctions and hierarchies among the char acters of Bel et Draco. The first distinction is that between living beings and lifeless beings as determined by their ability or inability to eat: able to eat unable to eat priests Bel sacred animal Daniel In the literature refuting idol worship, this simple distinction would have proven the lifelessness of idols. But since the problem of zoola try shows this distinction to be insufficient, a second qualifier is added for the group of living beings, namely, the ability to distinguish between food items that will lead to death or to life: unable to eat able to eat. . . . . but unable to distinguish food . . and able to distinguish food Bel pnests sacred animal Daniel This almost corresponds to another distinction between the choices of food, but here the priests end up in the least desirable category:</page><page sequence="20">THE ABILITY/INABILITY TO EAT 281 little-prepared, unboiled food items prepared and boiled food items boiled prepared and boiled Bel priests sacred animal Daniel By utilizing the themes of the ability to distinguish between food and quality of food, a hierarchy is established among the characters of Bel Bel etet Draco. On the top of this hierarchy stands Daniel who is alive, who eats food that saves his life, and who does so in a civilized manner. Below him is the sacred animal who is alive but can not distinguish between life-giving and lethal food items and also eats a less prepared, thus less civilized diet. Yet further down in the hierarchy are the priests who eat litde-prepared and unboiled food items and cannot determine between their life-giving or life-preserving qualities. On the bottom of the hierarchy is Bel, who is lifeless, unable to eat or to determine between good and bad food items. The ability to eat and the ability to distinguish life-giving from lethal food thus determine life and death in Bel et Draco: unable to eat able to eat Daniel able to distinguish between food items Bel priests sacred animal unable to distinguish between food items It is an ironic twist in the story that the lions, who are also living ani mals as is the second idol, do have the ability to distinguish between food items. They act as the executioners of the story and spare the positive character Daniel but later devour Daniel's enemies. It is one of Bel et Draco's main messages that survival is possible only where the ability to eat and the ability to determine the value of food come together. The idols and their worshippers lack one or both of these abilities and die. The civilized Jewish hero Daniel is the only charac ter in the story who is able to do both and thus survives.</page><page sequence="21">282 CLAUDIA BERGMANN BIBLIOGRAPHY Berger, Klaus. 1981 "Das Buch der Jubilaen."
