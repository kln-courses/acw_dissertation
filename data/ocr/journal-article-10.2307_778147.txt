Man on this earth is an unforeseen accident. -Joseph Conrad, Victory, 1915 You are standing in a thicket. Dark overhanging vines thread around you as they scatter the shafts of light that pierce the canopy, hitting the moss-covered stones beneath your feet. Stepping on the wet carpet of twigs, you make your way down the narrow path, pulling apart tree limbs as you approach what appears to be a clearing.You come upon a tall branching tree next to an old British colonial cupola'-the sort lovers take shelter in from the storm.You approach and look up, staring long at the tree's dark core, and notice how the vines hang down like lines of text ripped from so many books. This was the starting point for Simryn Gill's Forest, a series of black-and- white photographs made between 1996 and 1998, images of books cut up and carefully woven into an actual tropical landscape. Several sites were chosen for these interventions: the above-mentioned tree and cupola at Fort Canning in Singapore, an old colonial mansion, an abandoned army base, and the Gill family bungalow in Port Dickson, on the southwest coast of Malaysia. The texts were "naturalized," as it were, returned to earth and soil. The large-scale photographs (about four by three feet each) were then dispersed to various exhibition sites across the Pacific: Yokohama, Sydney, Singapore, Los Angeles- Kevin Chua Simryn Gill and Migration's Capital geographical dissemination fulfilling the cycle enacted within each photograph, a return to the world.You emerge from the forest, only to want to be absorbed back again. Gill's site interventions, which revolve loosely around nar- ratives of colonialism in Southeast Asia, have conventionally been explained biographically: Her works are supposedly about her migration and travel among Singapore, Malaysia, England, India, and Australia. Washed Up (1995), for example, a collection of beach-debris-like glass fragments, each etched with evocative words such as "war" or "nervous," would thus ostensibly tell a tale of our contingent life histories, our "washing up" in various parts of the world.Yet this description hardly gets us close to the work; it fails to bring these mute objects into our imaginative space. How do we explain what the works themselves enact within their own structure? Each fragment in Washed Up, for instance, conjures up a string of images and memories for the viewer-the biographical move-but acquires a different, more complex aura as the work as a whole recedes from the viewer. Individual word fragments then compete with one another, metaphor warring against metaphor, even before our arrival on the scene. We are washed up as viewers. It is immediately apparent that the viewer has difficulty in placing the pho- tographs that make up Forest-they could come from anywhere in the tropics- and in identifying, let alone reading, the texts. Gill includes no explanatory wall text in their display; the precise focal distance of the photographs allows the viewer to make out only some of the words on the leaves, adding to the diffi- culty of that placing. The fact that these aren't "landscapes" per se but close-ups of plants and trees makes the large-scale title "forest" beguiling-there's hardly a forest in sight. It is difficult to reconcile the small scale of these private textual site interventions with their public photographic format and display and their 5 art journal Many thanks to Simryn Gill and Lee Weng Choy for their comments.

What is it about the largeness of these photos against, or amidst, the smallness of these texts? At what moment as we pull away from the pho- tograph does a tree or cluster of trees become a "forest" for us? When do we see the forest for the trees? Gill seems to be calling into question the moment of scale itself-our prelinguistic apprehension of the world around us.2 We waver between an intense absorption in these strange text-landscapes and a need to withdraw from them, to take in the larger, encompassing view. Forest comprises a jostling or conjunction of old and new, nature and culture. Stately, ruined nineteenth-century colo- nial buildings are captured in the sheer aesthetic finish of black-and-white photography, while lush natural forms rub against soon-to-be-crumbling "colonial" texts by Charles Darwin, Joseph Conrad, and Daniel Defoe. Much of the work's aesthetic charge derives not from our percep- tion of the opposition but from the series of reversals between old and new, nature and culture. That opposition or gap is also a linguistic one: the etymology of the word "forest" underwent a gradual shift in meaning between the eleventh and fifteenth centuries from "a waste or unenclosed tract" to "a cultivated area." With the Norman conquest of England in the early eleventh century, the nomen- clature "forest," probably deriving from foris, or "outside," replaced the older Latin terms saltus and silva. This etymological shift was associated with a new, more repressive political administration that was imposed on large areas of the English countryside.3 But if the underlying sense of "forest" is thus of "an out- side wooded area," both the reference and the speaker's relative position are ambiguous. When we look at Gill's photographs, for instance, who names, that is, designates, the piece? Where are we standing in relation to this forest? Taking up the word "forest," in other words, involves entering a space of splitting lin- guistic paths and an ambiguous colonial history. What does it mean to inhabit the space of this linguistic turn or error?4 The publicness of Forest implies some relation to the wider world around it. So much has been written about the current turbulence of the global economy 9 art journal 2. For scale as a function of linguistic error, see the classic account in Paul de Man, "Metaphor (Second Discourse)," in Allegories of Reading: Figural Language in Rousseau, Nietzsche, Rilke, and Proust (New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1979), esp. 149-55. For de Man, the emer- gence into scale, seen in the misrecognition and misnaming of a man as a "giant," depends on the literalization of a prior literal-metaphorical (or literal-figural) undecidability. 3. Simon Schama, Landscape and Memory (New York: Knopf, 1995), 144. The moment of the political "fall" is hence also the moment of our entry into language. 4. Compare also Gill's Red Hot (1995), consisting of a Native American headpiece made of chilies. The work turns on the tension and misrecognition between "chili" and "pepper"-the word "pep- per" was a mistranslation of "chili"-across geo- graphical space. With regard to "error" in the Western literary tradition, most famously in Dante's Divine Comedy, to be "lost in the woods" or "not yet out of the woods" meant allegorically to wander in error or sin.</page><page sequence="7">that it has become just another truism; the spate of financial bubbles and busts in the 199os might remind us of Nature run amok, her storms mercilessly wreaking revenge on the economically timid. Like Nature, "globalization" comes close these days to being a universal signifier, a condition all of us are seemingly helpless to resist: we collapse from the weight of its metaphoricity. Assuming we may legitimately take "forest" as a metaphor for Nature, for something that threatens to engulf us, we might be tempted to link Gill's piece to the economic and social turbulence that swept through Asia in the late 199os, and whose cata- strophic effects have been compared to the Great Depression of the i93os.' Yet we should approach with caution, for any work of art can be inserted too easily into the framework of the Crisis. Like globalization, such a large-scale event explains both too much, and nothing at all about a work of art. We should bear in mind, too, that in the late 199os contemporary Asian art was being packaged for global consumption at the same time that capital was entering, and often quickly exiting, the region.7 "Art" is the fragmented remains left behind after capital's migration. Gill may appear to be reclaiming these ruined colonial sites (Fort Canning, Port Dickson) to serve as memorials against the destructive tide of globalization. But in attending to a site's "specificity" we might be nostalgically reconnecting to what is in fact a manufactured uniqueness of place. The authentic meanings and memories that circulate around a place may hinge on a surreptitious "differ- ential function of places"--the mere fact of their being different from one another. It is this differential function associated with places that might be "the hidden attractor in the term site specificity."8 Site specificity in this sense is merely nostalgic, hardly interventionist. Or, any interventionist component quickly becomes recommodified and rechanneled down one of global capitalism's many distributive streams. The risk is this: that Gill's retrieval of colonialism's "secret" history may end up being reused and recirculated by the global economy. Does inhabiting the space of this linguistic error only enable a repackaging of the "colonial," as it were, on capitalism's forward march? Perhaps the final irony will be that Nature-Faustian global capitalism run amok-will truly have the last word. The texts that Gill so carefully inserted in Forest and her site interventions will be, before they even begin, consumed by capitalism's heart of darkness. Let us begin with this first "nostalgic" history of the two main sites in Forest. Fort Canning and Port Dickson share similar histories of an initial importance fol- lowed by a period of decline. Fort Canning was the most prominent overlook in nineteenth-century Singapore. Known variously as Forbidden Hill (Bukit Larangan) and Government Hill-itself reflecting its transformation from a sacred to a political site-the hill was at various times the home of the chief British official in Singapore, the location of a Christian cemetery, the site of the colony's first botanical garden, and, around the second half of the nineteenth century, the location of a military bunker, built when Singapore's sea-trading activities grew significant enough to be threatened.9 Yet by the middle of the twentieth century, after sufficient land had been reclaimed from the sea to push it further inland, the hill's strategic importance diminished, and it became a mere symbol of a bygone colonial era. Curiously the location was a failure from 10 WINTER 2002 5. As a description, "globalization" refers to the widening and deepening of the international flows of trade, capital, technology, and information within a single integrated global market. As a pre- scription, it refers to the liberalization of national and global markets in the belief that free flows of trade, capital, and information will produce the best outcome for growth and human welfare. See James Petras and Henry Veltmeyer, Globalization Unmasked: Imperialism in the 2 1 st Century (London and New York: Zed Books, 200 1), I I. 6. The causes of the Asian Crisis have been hotly debated, although almost always by economists and political analysts. As with any historical event, its passing sees in fact not the opening up but the closing down of the historical possibilities on offer, as a normative explanation of the event becomes hegemonic and is recirculated. Currently the most accepted explanation sees the crisis as merely a financial affair: that the structural weakness of Asian banks and financial institutions abetted the panicked transfer of short-term capital out of Asian countries by investors world- wide. (See, for example, "The Crisis in Emerging Financial Markets: A World Bank Group- Brookings Conference Report," May 1999, at http://www.brook.edu/comm/conferencere- port/crO2.htm.) Yet this interpretation, though correct from a purely economic point of view, avoids talking about long-term causes of the crisis-in particular the reasons for the shift in the late 1960s and early 1970s from the "Golden Age" to the "Leaden Age." Only in the Leaden Age did financial deregulation substantially increase, which led to higher levels of speculative activity. This set the stage for the financial crises of the late 1990s. Giovanni Arrighi is one of the few who have adopted this long view of capital trans- formation, seeing the financial expansion of the 1990s as in fact indicative of the autumn of the long U.S. regime of accumulation, roughly from the 1I900s to the present, one of four long histori- cal cycles of capital accumulation. (See The Long Twentieth Century: Money, Power and the Origins of our Time [London: Verso, 1994].) Following Arrighi, I understand the long-term significance of Gill's Forest-specifically its harking back to the Conrad moment of the 1870s to the 1900s- as a similar attempt to make sense of our con- temporary present, but only by a careful, non- programmatic testing of History in a particular medium, here, texts and photography as part of a site-specific intervention. The period of the 1870s to the 1900s saw a similar turn or transition from one regime of capital accumulation to another, this time from the British to the American. In addition, the "purely financial" explanation of the crisis, by dismissing culture from econ- omics, loses sight of its larger significance: that, from the very beginning, its sources lay firmly rooted in everyday social action and behavior. How, for example, small shopowners like Pornsawan Rakthanyakarn in Thailand invested in speculative real estate schemes like the Thai city (and soon-to-be-ghost-town) Muang Thong Thani, only to become victims of the crash.

The British founded Singapore in 1819-"founding," of course, implying the erasure of a prior native history-in the course of the British East India Company's move to secure the lucrative China trade by controlling the strategic Strait of Malacca. The island quickly became the region's premier entrep6t, pulling commerce from many of the ports that dotted Malaysia's west coast. Port Dickson suffered this fate, even though it was active in the late nineteenth century as a port used to ship tin mined in the foothills nearby. Perhaps because of its economic marginalization, the Port also served as a leisure resort for the rich of nearby Kuala Lumpur, with the leisure resort being a historically specific form of pastoral in retreat, a refuge from the brutal effects of industrialization on the Malaysian countryside. Even today, the tourist beach is contaminated by oil from nearby refineries. Nor has the Gill family bungalow, built in the early twen- tieth century, been immune to such strange disjunctions. Bungalows have always connoted Edenic seclusion from the bustle of colonial industrial life, yet this house seems strangely out of place. The British remained in the region until the I96os, after a brief interregnum during World War II, when the Japanese occupied Malaysia and Singapore." After decolonization, both countries embarked on similar paths of modernization, first industrial, then export-driven. The shift from import-substitution to export-led growth in the early I980s marked a new alignment with transnational capital flows for the two countries.' Essentially this was a continuation of the nineteenth- century free-port strategy, especially for Singapore: the countries would open up to wider regional and international capital flows, staking their economic hopes on the ability to filter and capture this monetary traffic. The strategy, it seems, has paid off: now referred to as Newly Industrialized Countries, or NICs, both II art journal http://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/sur- vey2.htm.) How they (too) got caught up in the alluring image of capital is what's at issue-not just the activities of a group of bankers, investors, and government officials at the top layer of the global economy. Guy Debord was one of the first to understand the image as intrinsic to the work- ings of capital. "The spectacle," he argued in The Society of the Spectacle (Donald Nicholson-Smith, trans. [New York: Zone Books, 1995]), "is capital accumulated to the point where it becomes image" (24). It is the turning from capital to image (and back again) that forms the vantage point of his theory-and the horizon of any future political transformation. The best short introduction to the Asian crisis is in Wayne Ellwood, The No- Nonsense Guide to Globalization (Oxford and London: New Internationalist Publications and Verso, 2001), 72-89. 7. In 1996, about $96 billion in capital flowed into five countries: South Korea, Malaysia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Singapore. By the end of 1997, these five nations saw a total outflow of about $100 billion. My use of the term "global con- sumption" derives from Lee Weng Choy, "Just What Is It that Makes the Term Global-Local So Widely Cited, Yet So Annoying?" in Flight Patterns, exh. cat. (Los Angeles: Museum of Contemporary Art, 2000), 134-43. The history of these large- scale survey exhibitions of new Asian art in the 1990s has yet to be written. 8.

For Singapore, see especially Garry Rodan, The Political Economy of Singapore's Industrialization: National State and International Capital (London: Macmillan, 1989), who seeks to recover the contingency of the moment of Singapore's incor- poration into the New International Division of Labor (NIDL) in manufacturing production, first as an exporter of low-value-added goods. "Contingency" here refers to the specific social and political factors that made incorporation into the NIDL possible. Emerging in the late 1960s and 70s, the NIDL signaled the new historical condi- tions of capital accumulation, characterized by the rapid industrialization of certain Third World economies (the Newly Industrialized Countries). The emergence of the NIDL was based on three preconditions: "the development of a world-wide reservoir of potential labour power..,. made possible by the introduction of capitalist agricultural</page><page sequence="9">Singapore and Malaysia have recorded impressive rates of economic growth. Singapore's per capita gross national product, for example, currently exceeds that of her former colonizer, Great Britain, while Malaysia marked high-double-digit rates of economic growth until the mid- 1990s. Singapore and Malaysia's post- I960s history would seem to represent our exit from the colonial forest. This recent history was written in the shadow of an ambiguous British decolonization, which reflected the ambiguity of colonization itself. From the early years of their formal intervention in several of the Malay states in the 1870s, the British were deeply reluctant to become involved in what they regarded as the endless petty disputes among local Malay princes. The British wanted to enjoy the rewards of economic extraction without getting their hands dirty in the muck of local politics. The twist was that, many years later, when they were withdrawing from Malaya in the I960s-a period marked by the terrors of Communist insurrection'3-they were suddenly overcome by a need to leave behind an independent Malaya "fit for Malayans." Decolonization continues to be felt in many features of British rule that have lingered on in the social and political fabric of the two countries: the sharp ethnic divide in Malaysian politics, for instance, can be traced back to the after- math of the Emergency of the I96os, while the paternalistic and pragmatic ideals of the current government in Singapore were also traits of British colonial rule- its stern aesthetic face. For the generation that came of age in the I95os, and especially for modern Singapore's former prime minister and chief architect, Lee Kuan Yew, that image of British power and perfection was deeply constitutive. "[The] Englishman remained Lee's model of perfection," one writer explains, "the Englishman of the old school, who dressed up in the tropical heat and bravely bore the white man's burden."'4 Entering the freedom of a clearing, we are left with scars from the forest. The era Gill refers to as "colonial" has both a more extended temporal continuity and a more contingent nature. Forest taps into a longer historical-even geological-time scale, and at the same time conveys a feeling of rupture. We seem to be returning to a landscape we once knew, where we encounter (or are encountered by) some hallucinatory pieces of text. The symbol in Forest both extends through historical time and performs punctually, with the character of an event. Symbols have an inherent colonizing power: They are absorptive and all-encompassing. (Metaphors work in a similar way, extending in almost infinite webs, bringing everything into their sphere of meaning.) The symbolic forest, closely linked to the quest for a pristine Eden, has deep, even primeval roots in western European culture. By the fifteenth cen- tury, however, with the rise of agriculture, many in Europe began to live apart from the life-sustaining forest."' It was this movement that occasioned the word's linguistic shift: "forest" now turned from lived metaphor into (mere) literal referent, something scaled and apart from human habitation.'6 The search for Eden brought about the West's colonial advance to distant lands, necessitated in part by a pragmatic need for timber, as more and more of Europe's forests were cut down."7 Forests in Jamaica and other islands in the West Indies and in Southeast Asia were needed for timber to build trade and battleships; the increase in commerce in the newly colonized regions accelerated deforestation to build ships to support and protect that very commerce. By the time the British "founded" Singapore in 1819, the harsh effects of I2 WINTER 2002 production techniques in the periphery; the decomposition of complex production processes into separate and simple units of production, leading to the deskilling of the labour process; and the technological development of transport and communications systems which freed industrial production from constraints on geographical loc- ation" (17-18). 13. The underlying significance of this Cold War conflict was that its resolution ironically allowed the Asian "economic miracle" to take place, thanks to an American security umbrella. Benedict Anderson explains it thus in "From Miracle to Crash," The London Review of Books, April 16, 1998: "In every important country of South-East Asia, with the exception of Indonesia, there were major, sustained Communist insurrections, and Indonesia, in the early sixties, had the largest legal Communist Party in the world outside the social- ist bloc. In all these states, except Malaysia, which was still a colony, the Americans intervened politi- cally, economically, militarily and culturally, on a massive scale. The notorious domino theory was invented specifically for South-East Asia. Washington made every effort to create loyal, capitalistically prosperous, authoritarian and anti- Communist regimes.... Many were tied to the U.S. by security arrangements, and in some the Americans had a broad range of military installa- tions. Each disaster only encouraged Washington to put more muscle and money behind in remain- ing political allies. No world region received more 'aid"' (3). The cooling down of the "hot" Cold War in Southeast Asia took place at the same time as the NIDL was emerging. 14. lan Buruma, "The Man Who Would Be King," The New York Review of Books, June 10, 1999, 34. Lee himself is explicit in this regard in his autobi- ography, The Singapore Story: Memoirs of Lee Kuan Yew (Englewood Cliffs, N.J.: Prentice Hall, 1999). 15. For the forest as a life-sustaining force in liter- ature, see Northrop Frye (A Natural Perspective: The Development of Shakespearean Comedy and Romance, New York and London: Columbia University Press, 1965), 142 ff. "The forest or green world, then, is a symbol of natural society, the word natural here referring to the original human society which is the proper home of man, not the physical world he now lives in but the 'golden world' he is trying to regain" (142). 16. As Schama points out: "The mark of these Western woodland societies was not their sepa- ration from, but their connection with, the rest of the world" (144). Only later would traces of this woodland labor be eradicated and the myth of an imaginary forest utopia constructed. "[It] was just because the English woods were home to all this busy social and economic activity that the imposi- tion of the Norman concept of the forest seemed so brutal" (144).</page><page sequence="10">deforestation and capital accumulation were concentrated in these areas. The literal exit from the forest in Europe led, ironically, to a metaphorical coloniza- tion of the world. Using the word "jungle" in these lands provided a measure of safety; it allowed the British to forget the trauma of the lost forest of their ances- tral homeland. When we are absorbed into the imaginative space of Gill's pho- tographs-and the barely readable text scales them to the human-we are drawn into a space, and a past, that is deeply colonial. Our engagement with each pho- tograph enacts a cognitive to-and-fro that both mimics and metaphorizes the entry into and exit from the colonial forest: both the life-giving, British forest denied to us by the invading French, and the historical "forest" that was the colonization of Asia. We are positioned right on that uneasy threshold between past and future, forest and clearing. There is also a dark irony in the fact that the British created botanical gar- dens in many of their colonies, miniature paradises for the selective cultivation of rare plants. One such was at the foot of Fort Canning. Sir Stamford Raffles, the founder of Singapore, explicitly affirmed the importance of the garden. The historian C. M. Turnbull tells us that Raffles built himself a wooden bungalow on the Forbidden Hill, later renamed Government Hill, partly to escape from the oppressive heat of the plain below, partly in a death wish to be buried among the Malay rulers of old Singapura. In 1819 he had dispatched a European gardener from Bencoolen [in Indonesia] to plant clove and nutmeg trees at the foot of the hill ... Raffles hoped his experimental garden would provide the foundation for Singapore's agricultural prosperity.'8 The gardens also represented the conservationist and scientific efforts of sev- eral botanists and other naturalists working in the region, men who sent plant specimens back to Britain's famed Kew Gardens-a vast colonial project of scien- tific classification and specimen-gathering. This indicates a deeper historical reference for the layers of botanical illus- tration in Gill's photographs; she is literally fixing the complex reality of plant life in the region, those classifications of nature that would be recirculated in the West and then around the world as empirical knowledge.'9 By this logic, a foreign presence controls and tames a place by "knowing" it: colonization by epistemology. So much of Southeast Asia was subjected to this peculiar kind of storytelling that it is difficult to recover a sense of what the region and its plants and animals were like before their scientific regimentation. A traveling naturalist like Alfred Russell Wallace blended travelogue and scientific document in his widely read book The Malay Archipelago, which included several images that may have formed part of the imaginative fabric of Gill's project.20 Yet something pre- cedes these images and their texts, and it is this moment prior to representation that Gill seeks to tap into, a reconnection to something lost-and therefore presently alive-in the colonial imagination.2' It is no surprise to learn that Joseph Conrad, another of Gill's sources,"22 read Wallace, whose text would be converted into Conrad's own, like the way in which the remains of a dead plant would form the nutrients for a living one. Lord Jim drew from both Conrad's personal experiences in the Malay region and Wallace's scientific descriptions. Gill's Forest revisits this late-nineteenth-century 1 3 art journal 17. See Richard H.

This is not too different from Wallace's own project, which sought to locate deeper geological causation beneath and through the surface forms of plants and animals. e.g.: "But it is when we examine the zoology of these countries that we find what we most require-evidence of a very striking character that these great islands must have once formed a part of the continent, and could only have been separated at a very recent geological epoch." (Wallace, Malay Archipelago, 9) But causation for him meant not the locking down, but rather the opening up of interpretive possibilities of the region's historical ecology. We are only beginning to appreciate the fact that Wallace's project was not a narrow, positivist scientific enterprise. 22. The use of the word "sources" is complicated, for Gill does not go out in search of places to illustrate prior texts; nor does she attempt to illustrate prior places with texts. Her practice might best be described as a long-term interlacing of place and text-long-term because laced with deep memories of these places and texts, some- thing the moment of photography masks and puts in tension, because of its recording of an instant.

He notably remarked that life resembles a forest in which no one knows the way.24 In Heart of Darkness we get his fullest treatment of the forest as symbol (and it is a mark of Conrad's intelli- gence that he used the more symbolically charged word "forest," rather than the weaker "jungle," thus implicating his narrator with a colonial gaze): "Going up that river was like traveling back to the earliest beginnings of the world, when vegetation rioted on the earth and the big trees were kings. An empty stream, a great silence, an impenetrable forest."' The forest symbolizes the opacity, even futility, of human action and knowledge in a godless world; this is Conrad's skeptical imagination at its clearest (and most dizzying). Tracking and trailing the narrator, the reader descends into the symbolic forest, the skeptical abyss. The image of the forest can stand for what must have been a more pervasive 14 WINTER 2002 23. Arrighi argues that the period of 1870 to 1900, which saw an expansion of worldwide financial speculation and activity, was already the autumn of the British regime of capital accumula- tion. Conrad's novels expose the contradictions and tensions of this moment of transition. The phrase "high noon of empire" comes from Turnbull, History of Singapore, 76. 24. Joseph Conrad's Letters to R.

The characters in Conrad's tales share this anxiety about the jungle, as well as a sense of being adrift in a fog of sensations. His texts contain pockets of wonder despite, or perhaps because of, his deep skepticism.26 We find, for example, scenes in which the narrator seems to be encountering the land for the very first time: Some fifty miles below the Inland Station we came upon a hut of reeds, an inclined and melancholy pole with the unrecognizable tatters of what had been a flag of some sort flying from it ... by the door I picked up a book. It had lost its covers, and the pages had been thumbed into a state of extremely dirty softness, but the back had been lovingly stitched afresh with white cotton thread, which looked clean yet. It was an extraordinary find. Its title was An Inquiry into Some Points of Seamanship by a man Towser, Towson some such name-Master in His Majesty's Navy. . . . I handled this amazing antiquity with the greatest possible tenderness lest it should dissolve in my hands (39). The book's identity oscillates between text and thing, producing in the nar- rator Marlow a strange sense of the transience of his own presence in the land- scape. Similarly, at the end of Lord Jim, the audience diminishes one by one, finally leaving the primary narrator alone with the last words of the story, "in a thick packet addressed in Marlow's upright and angular handwriting."27 It is interest- ing that Conrad's desolate landscapes need to be marked by these textual traces; mere human mortality gives way to the permanence of writing as relic.28 But if in Lord Jim there seems a greater possibility that writing can weave the alienated traveler back into the world, back into the normalizing community-a moment, in other words, in which a faltering skepticism recovers itself-in Heart of Darkness writing puts us on a grim path toward dissolution. Death turns its ironic face and hands us a tattered, and beautiful, book. In another of Gill's source texts, Daniel Defoe's Robinson Crusoe, the paradig- matic island-conqueror Crusoe remarks: "I saw large plants of aloes, but did not understand them.""9 We could say that Crusoe must forget or repress this instant of wonder if he is to territorialize his plot of land, yet his initial apprehension of nature will somehow remain, a spectral, offstage presence in the narrative. Something like this occurs in early descriptions of Fort Canning, which seems to have been haunted by a mythology of ruin. One traveler recounted how Government House, located at the top of the hill, was constructed of materials "withal so insubstantial, that after a Sumatra squall has passed over the town, inquiring glances are cast up by the inhabitants, to discover whether the house still remains [status] quo, or has disappeared from the top of the hill." Immediately after this observation, the writer describes the botanical garden at the foot of the hill, "which is now overrun with weeds, though several nutmeg trees ... flour- ish and bear fruit without any care or cultivation."30 We should also note the metonymic slide from the government building to the garden below, as though they share a primordial, perhaps even cosmological, connection. This conjunc- tion of ruin and fertility is a recurring trope in travelers' accounts and official documents-a little disquiet lurking at the boundaries of Eden.3' An 1873 state- ment arguing in favor of intervention in Malaya reads: I15 art journal 26.

Part of the legend surrounding the founding of Singapore involves the discovery of a monolith ten feet high by ten feet wide and two-and-a- half-feet thick with writing at the mouth of the Singapore river, just below Fort Canning. Raffles's scribe Munsyi Abdullah's account of the incident proceeds as follows: "It was then that they [labor- ers under the direction of Stamford Raffles and Colonel Farquhar] found at the point of the head- land a rock lying in the bushes. The rock was smooth, about six feet wide, square in shape, and its face was covered with a chiseled inscription. [This writing] was illegible because of extensive scouring by water. Allah alone knows how many thousands of years old it may have been. After its discovery crowds of all races came to see it. The Indians declared that the writing was Hindu but they were unable to read it. The Chinese claimed that it was in Chinese characters.... Many learned men came and tried to read it... not a single person in all Singapore was able to interpret the words chiseled on the rock .... It remained where it was until the time when Mr. [S. G.] Bonham was Governor of the three Settlements of Singapore, Penang, and Malacca. Mr. [G. D.] Coleman was then engineer in Singapore and it was he who broke up the stone; a great pity, and in my opinion a most improper thing to do... ."

It is probable that this ruin/fertility trope also manifests a nostalgia for the landed estates of England, displaced onto these foreign locales. Beginning with the rise of the British Empire under the Tudors, more and more of the forest was opened up, and more and more woodland devel- oped. No longer could there be "islands" of pri- vate landed property within the area of the royal forests, and the hostility of the aristocratic minor- ity would continue in a different, mutated form during and after the Enclosure Acts of the early nineteenth century.</page><page sequence="13">Her Majesty's Government have, it need hardly be said, no desire to interfere in the internal affairs of the Malay States. But looking to the long and intimate connexion between them and the British Government ... Her Majesty's Government find it incumbent upon them to employ such influ- ence as they possess with the Native Princes to rescue, if possible, those fertile and productive countries from the ruin which must befall them if the present disorders continue unchecked [italics mine].32 We are far from any felt affinity to the land here, far from wonder. While the elegiac mode does not in itself necessitate action or redress, here the imaginary anticipation of ruin allows political intervention to be "rationalized." One needs to tend one's garden in advance. A moment of turning in the text, like standing in front of one of the Forest photographs, our upright body falling silently to the horizontal, tilting ever so slowly into the picture's dark interior. How strange then, that modern (post- 1965) Singapore has promoted itself as an Edenic "Garden City"; this has been one of its major selling points on the global tourist circuit.33 Yet Ebenezer Howard's nineteenth-century vision of a town of limited size surrounded by a buffer zone of agricultural land held in common by the community has been implemented somewhat literally with the large-scale planting of trees and shrubs all over the island. The gray concrete of the urban landscape has been harmoniously "color-balanced" with shades of green.34 For Lee Kuan Yew, the strategy was "to make Singapore into an oasis in Southeast Asia, for if we had First World standards then business-people and tourists would make us a base for their business and tours of the region.'3s It is interesting how Lee so succinctly blurs tourism and investment, as though one naturally followed from the other. We note the awkwardly antiquated use of the term "First World," as well as the assumption of a unitary "standard" for this unnamed group of countries. The terms "First World" and "Third World" origi- nated in the i96os, when several nonaligned nations sought to clear a political space for themselves within the Cold War struggle for global hegemony.36 The terms were mostly out of favor by the i98os, at exactly the moment when the rise of the east Asian NICs to economic power was breaking down the easy geo- graphical distinction between Western "First" and non-Western "Third" worlds. Lee's wording thus enacts a powerful reversal for the reader: Whereas in the i96os the Third World countries were asserting their independence from First World political-economic domination, here, the direction is from Third to First World.You defeat the core by becoming the core-if you are a bootstrapping Singaporean or Asian, or sympathetic Westerner, while, by implication, those less fortunate remain in the Third World. Lee both posits a hierarchy and draws a line in the sand, a Darwinian one of economic fitness. The pivot in Lee's sen- tence is the word "if": it assumes an image of the future that rationalizes present action, much like garden logic. What is this forest that Singapore is always limi- nally emerging out of, this prospect it desires? Part of Lee's strategy of greening Singapore was, ironically, to make the city greener than it actually was-to hypernaturalize nature: Nature did not favor us with luscious green grass as it has New Zealand and Iceland. An Australian plant expert and a New Zealand soil expert came in 1978 at my request to study our soil conditions . . . They explained that 16 WINTER 2002 32. These were Sir Andrew Clarke's instructions, dated September 20, 1873, cited in Sir Frank Swettenham, British Malaya, rev. ed. (1906; London: G. Allen and Unwin, 1948), 174. Clarke was the new governor of the Straits Settlements. One of the states marked for intervention, Negri Sembilan, included Port Dickson. Between 1870 and 19 14 the British consolidated their position in the Malay Peninsula, northern Borneo, Burma, and Siam. Although British intervention-which led to the formation of the Federated Malay States in 1896-was intended to facilitate British economic interests in the region, and to stave off challenges to British power in the region by other global powers, notably Germany and France, it was originally triggered by local crises in the region. Yet intervention had a larger place in the British regime of capital accumulation: From the late nineteenth century "the development of agriculture and mining tied South-East Asian economies more closely to industrial and finance capitalism in Britain" (A. J. Stockwell, "British Expansion and Rule in South-East Asia," in The Oxford History of the British Empire, vol. 3, The Nineteenth Century [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1999], 371). In short, during the period of 1870 to 19 14 the region became fully integrated into the global economy, which meant a greater dependence on external capital flows, beneficial to a specific, financial capitalist class, rather than a deepening of the internal market, beneficial to labor and the manufacturing class. So although the rubber industry would experience a boom between 1905 and 19 14, ironically it entrenched Malaya's position as a "less-developed" depen- dent economy. See John H. Drabble, Rubber in Malaya, 1876-1922 (Kuala Lumpur and New York: Oxford University Press, 1973), 207-1 1. 33. See Stephen H. K.

At issue is the balance between managed and spontaneous vegetation in Singapore. The authors point out that "urban vegetation is care- fully managed to meet aesthetic and architectural criteria; far less attention is given to spontaneous vegetation which provides food and protected nesting sites for birds and insects" (214). In 1990, Fort Canning became a national park under the jurisdiction of the newly-founded National Parks Board (NPB), set up to administer parks and nature reserves in the country. 35. Lee Kuan Yew, From Third World to First: The Singapore Story, 1965-2000 (New York: Harper Collins, 2000), 174. Lee's book in effect seeks both to posit and enact the exit from the forest of colonization and underdevelopment. 36. Specifically this dates from the Bandung Conference of 1955.</page><page sequence="14">Singapore was part of the equatorial rainforest belt, with strong sunshine and heavy rainfall throughout the year. When trees were cut down, heavy rainfall would wash off the topsoil and leach the nutrients. To have grass green and lush, we had to apply fertilizers regularly, preferably compost, which would not be so easily washed away, and lime, because our soil was too acidic. The Istana curator tested this on our lawns. Suddenly the grass became greener. We had all school and other sports fields and stadiums similarly treated. The bare patches around the goal posts with sparse, tired- looking yellow grass were soon carpeted green. Gradually, the whole city greened up. A visiting French minister, a guest at our National Day reception in the 1970s, was ecstatic as he congratulated me in French; I did not speak it, but understood the word "verdure." He was captivated by the greenness of the city. 37 Singaporeans' discourse about their city is often troubled by a need to please an imagined (Western) foreigner visiting the island, a need to impress some phantasmic colonial superior whose position, paradoxically, the Singapore bour- geoisie now occupies.38 Hence the closing encapsulation of Lee's anecdote by a theatrical presentation to a foreign spectator. Foreign, forest. Reversals abound: The foreignness of the visitor's language is evoked in terms uncannily like those a Western traveler would once have used to describe a native's incomprehensible tongue ("I did not speak it"). And everything, it seems, races toward that final moment of triumphal presentation: if in the Conrad anecdote Death gave us infinite pause, here all is speed and virtuality. Thus reworked, even Nature in Singapore is made to keep pace with the speed of capital ("Suddenly the grass became greener"). Even though, that is, she "did not favor us." Globalization has to colonize time: not only must it occupy the future hor- izon as a mere ideal, it has to ensure that the pathways for capital are kept open in the present-future. This means that it has to defeat history itself, for history is what is antagonistic to global economic time.39 The realm of representation is where we see this struggle, this colonization, taking place. Global capitalism ultimately wants to posit a cultural realm prior to economic activity, to have culture prepare the ground for capital entry. Culture must structure time and desire-or, better, structure the time of desire. The threat of future ruin promises present desire for continued capital, and all it takes is the threat of capital pullout (a common strategy of multinational firms).4' Even the Singapore government's speeches are often coated with a rhetoric of disaster: For a small country like Singapore, we always worry about freak election results. A demagogue, or a honey-combed politician, can cause an election upset. ... If he cannot follow up his victory with effective government, dis- aster will befall the country. Once the country has a great fall, we cannot possibly stick Humpty Dumpty together again.4' While the future becomes evacuated by fear, the past, too, is streamlined. "Colonialism" becomes less and less a real event that is gradually incorporated into the imaginary than a number of vestigial buildings on their way toward ren- ovation. History not only becomes pastoral, it is replaced by the more alluring, less complicated consumerist "tourism." I 7 art journal 37. Lee Kuan Yew, From Third World to First, 176.

Cutting eight hundred workers from its ten-thousand-strong Singapore workforce, the company moved some of its production to the cheaper Bangkok. The move to Bangkok was matched by two of Seagate's rivals, Micropolis Corporation and Maxtor Corporation, which wanted to set up plants outside of Singapore.

Kevin Chua. But is Singapore truly the triumphant site of global capitalism, a country able to direct culture fully toward its economic needs? Compare Fort Canning in early 2001, with the cupolas under renovation, to this abandoned building in Port Dickson-a residential haven that fell into ruin before it was even completed.42 In the late 199os, capital underwent devaluation and crisis, only to recirculate again as capital. "A crisis always forms the starting point for new investments," Marx observed in Capital, and these lay "a new material basis for the next turnover cycle."43 What is unprecedented in the present stage of globalization is the increased power of culture to do capital's work; culture is no longer thought of as epiphenomenal, the realm of mere appearance. Port Dickson is perhaps a step behind Singapore in its cultural manipulation of capital: The signs of capital crisis there have been left too visible in the landscape. In a world where "image is everything"--the pristine image so alluring to global capital migration-culture and economics in Singapore have become ever more tightly interwoven: Ruins are immediately repackaged and recirculated for further consumption. The gar- den utopia is just on the horizon, and we are accelerating toward it. Economists refer to the preparatory conversion of the spectator-buyer in advance of capital as "the seeding of markets." Why not call this process the "the naturalization of place"? We are loading the dice here. As Gill has explained: 18 WINTER 2002 42. Gill dates its appearance to between 1995 and 1996. She has tracked the transformation of these abandoned buildings in Port Dickson and else- where in Malaysia, how in dissolution they seem to revert into the landscape: "To me it seems like time is going backward for these unrealized pro- jects....

In Forest I was fas- cinated by the idea of planting books and seeing what would grow out of them. I viewed these texts as having become part of the landscape, where I "literalized the landscape" so that bodies of texts literally become part of the landscape and texts literally become embodied as plants.44 Part of the fascination of Gill's method is that it cleaves close to global capi- talism, mimics and flirts with Nature. Her wager lies at the moment of insertion (before the next turnover cycle?): seeing, or seeing embodied, a prior moment of naturalization, an opening she is looking for in the now-vanishing present- past. A kind of seeing (or not-seeing) involved in the surreal phrase "so that bodies of texts literally become part of the landscape and texts literally become embodied as plants"-the sentence turning from anthropomorphic to inhuman and back again, tumbling over itself as it slides in and out of metaphor. 19 art journal 44.

It has to lull and detemporalize culture into a contentless present, if it is to keep its circulating rhythm. The question of time in Gill's pictures is therefore crucial: They display a slowness that is more common to painting (because of painting's inherently slow process-just imagine the time needed for oil paint to dry). If globalization closes down time, perhaps slowness can open it up again. The slowness in Forest operates on several levels: the com- pression inherent in the generation of the image-the photographic develop- ment and printing that sets off a gradual phenomenal release of the image's con- tent; the slowness of reading and looking (and the slowness of the blurring of reading with looking, their mutual interlacing and separation); the slow absorp- tion of the beholder into the picture, even the slowness of nature as it reveals itself to us.45 The viewing habits of a casual museum-goer are transformed into the slow looking we rely on when we are out in nature, pondering and wander- ing: where memories become one with a place, and when place becomes- entwines with-the sensations of felt memory. We seem in Gill's photographs to be in a place, a forest, of our ancestral past, a place we keep coming back to. Of course, the slowness of the image is antithetical to the speed of global capital, making these images hard to digest. Slowness makes consumption difficult, like eating hard things. The extent to which the image seduces and lulls us is particu- larly interesting. We give in to the opening of time in order to find our place within it, finding a clearing within the time of globalization. "The finished pictures have a particular look .... " Pictures, when finished as "Art," lose their vitality, become mere remains. How can Gill work through her process and still have these dead pictures be about a place, as opposed to being mere representations of a place? An interviewer asked her: "You work with materials such as chillies, books, cutlery, seeds, and everyday objects, which are then reconstituted as metaphor. To what extent are these particular choices informed by a sense of personal history ... ? [italics mine]" When she replied that "usually different layers coexist and come together in the work,"46 she was refusing to say which came first, refusing to admit that the process was linear or predictable. Yet the interviewer's question is revealing in its assumption that metaphors come after materials, ideas after things, as if metaphors had the capacity to "revive" dead objects. But Gill pursues the problem of metaphor and materiality to a deeper, prior moment of undecidability, a moment or state when materi- ality is (already) metaphor, or metaphor (already) material, thinglike, causative. Gill has remarked of the mysterious "thingness" of objects, their presence before human presence: What more is there to add to it-there is very little that an artist can do to "things," they are best left alone, as they are. I like to think that I do not dis- tort the things I use (except occasionally), i.e., reshape, paint over, recon- struct, etc. I collect and assemble and juxtapose mostly . . . even [with] the books, all I am doing is liberating the text, not tearing against it. I love that resonance, the tension, that movement between the form (thingness) and the content. They seem to undermine each other as much as the opposite.47 And of course literalization is thinglike, a pause along metaphoric migra- tion. Globalization-as-metaphor becomes effective when it operates at the level 20 WINTER 2002 45. Gill remarked of Forest: "The finished pictures have a particular look-they are graphic pho- tographs, which are printed with very low con- trast so that every element of detail is retained. The model that I had in mind was botanical drawings, the graphite of pencil drawings. Con- sequently the printing tries, as far as possible, to remain in the grey range. There is almost no true black in these photographs. They are what I would call 'slow' images. They give of themselves very slowly. The content, the visual information, doesn't jump out immediately due to the low contrast. They demand a long look. Almost like reading. Or looking into a thicket of plants and only slowly seeing the detail, the separation of elements" (8). 46. "Suhanya Raffel in Conversation with Simryn Gill," 6. 47.

To stop (seeing) in front of Forest is already to literal- ize it (as "Art"); in evoking metaphors we reawaken what was already there in the object-image to begin with. When we exit the forest into a clearing, rather than lose the forest or leave it behind, we realize that it is a place that we have already been to, a place that we rediscover. The dialectic between text and thing, metaphor and materiality, is delicate and profound because it is radically open to contingency. And Gill's historical investigations are nothing but contingent. Objects also have an unusual ability to contain memories. We think of Proust's madeleine or the way objects in childhood seem indissolubly bound up with images, tastes, and smells. Perhaps it is the way objects make us aware of our scale, our human size relative to the phenomenal world around us. They give us pause as we pass into the realm of the human, the realm of language. Standing in front of Gill's Forest, Yao Souchou ruminated on his early travels to Europe: " ... in the hushed silence of [Western] university libraries, we discov- ered, besides financial accounting and international economics, also other works and ideas-those of Keats, Wordsworth, Byron, Emerson, Goethe, and Schiller. For some of us, such a discovery marked us forever like some Conradian char- acter fatally marooned in some place which can never be home.48 Perhaps his- tory begins precisely from a consciousness of having been marooned. From a moment of inscription-a moment that allows memory to begin, that begins a place. In this light it is significant that the bits of text in Forest are very lightly impressed or pasted over. Ephemerality as contingency. In and through that very lightness, Gill's images press toward a founding moment of inscription or clear- ing: she is reaching for the grammar of colonial experience, a moment of "letting be."'49 We are unfolding and unraveling these large narratives of capital and glob- alization by means of the simplest acts of cutting, pasting, and hanging, acts of recovery and attunement. Our entry into these photographs becomes, in turn, a perceptual dance between remembering and forgetting, coming and going. A dialectic between grammatical scale and metaphorical size.

One night, a Hong Kong student, his eyes popping out of his head, told me they were unashamedly making love on the lifeboat deck. I was curious and went up to see for myself. What a sight it was! The deck was a hive of activity, with couples locked in passionate embraces scattered all over it. ... But to see dozens of men and women openly engaging in sex contrasted sharply with my memory of the Japanese soldiers queuing up outside the 'comfort house' at Cairnhill Road. 'French letters,' now called condoms, littered the deck. "I received another shock when the ship passed through the Suez Canal. It proceeded slowly so that the waves would not wash down the loose sand on the banks. As we passed, a group of Arab workers on the shore started shouting obscenities and lifted their gallabiya-- long garments like nightshirts-to flaunt their genitals at the British servicewomen, who were watching the world go by in the torrid heat. The women shrieked in surprise and disgust, much to the delight of the Arabs, who put their hands on their penises and shook them. I had seen monkeys in the Botanic Gardens in Singapore do this to visi- tors who refused them bananas. Later, I learnt that they hated the British. Why, I did not know. It was the first time I had left Singapore to go overseas. I was being exposed to a new world of the hates and loves, the prejudices and biases of different peoples" [italics mine] (99-100). 49. This dovetails with Lee Weng Choy's precise remark: "Gill's engagement lies in the grammar of things, in how the positioning and proliferation of terms make possible, as well as undermine, that which moors identity." Lee Weng Choy, "Local Coconuts: Simryn Gill and the Politics of Identity," Art Asia Pacific 1I6 (1997): 61. I have extended Lee's approach in exploring this grammatical problem to the level of history: the dialectic between objects "speaking" history and objects being inscribed by history. 50. Simryn Gill, conversation with the author, Port Dickson, Malaysia, January 5, 200 1. It is appropri- ate that the ficus trees, deadly in the parasitic suffocation of their host tree, take their place next to the cupolas, silently mocking the pastoral.</page></plain_text>
