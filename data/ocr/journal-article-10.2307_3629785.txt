<plain_text><page sequence="1">Ritual Performance and Religious Experience: A Service for the Gods in Southern Haitil IRA P. LOWENTHAL Offertory ritual in Haitian voodoo is examinedfrom the point of view of the participants. The implications of the structure and the organization of worship for the subjective experience of the devotees is explored Such a view highlights spirit possession and acoustic/kinetic performance as the most salient features of ritual within this religious system. The design and the success of ritual are predicated on the articulation of basic theological tenets with an aesthetic principle for collective participation in song and dance. It is argued that previous analyses of voodoo tend to fragment and/or objectify this fundamental ritual process. A perspective which confronts the act of worship on its own terms, as a coherent and meaningful event in the religious lives of the faithful, leads to a reformulation of some traditional anthropological questions concerning the culture-history, function, and psychological signific- ance of Haitian voodoo. INTRODUCTION VOODOO has long been an object of both popular fascination and scholarly research among outsiders to Haitian life and culture. Sensa- tional journalism, "exotic" novels, and a number of antivoodoo campaigns (the most strenuous, perhaps, conducted by the U.S. Occupation Forces of 1915-34 [Mintz 1972; Schmidt 1971]) have all contributed to the myriad misconceptions which mark the layman's knowledge of Haitian religion both in the Americas and abroad. In a forum of this kind, such popularized accounts are best left to stand as their own critique (cf. Kuser 1921; Loederer 1935; Pritchard 1900; Seabrook 1929; Wirkus 1931). At the same time, the extensive literature representing the attempts of more serious students of Haitian society to understand voodoo and its importance is in need of careful re-examination. In this article, I will suggest that previous analyses of Haitian religion have failed to come to terms with some of its most essential features as a coherent system of belief and worship. Through the examination of a single type of ritual event, I will attempt to refocus attention on several issues, which seem to lie at the heart of this Afro-American religion. Such a re-orientation, more fully researched and expounded, may have implications for an understanding of both the contemporary and the historical significance of voodoo in Haitian society and culture. 1 Fieldwork upon which this paper is based was carried out during the summer of 1974, supported jointly by the National Science Foundation and the Antilles Research Program, Yale University. Thanks are due to Emily Ahern, Sandra Barnes, Eugene Galbraith, Jacqueline Mintz, Sidney Mintz, Richard Price, Elizabeth Traube, and Drexel Woodson for their thoughtful criti- cisms of earlier drafts of this manuscript. My profound personal and intellectual debt to the members of the community in which my research was conducted cannot be repaid in the form of an acknowledgment, but it is perhaps worth noting here that their hospitality and cooperation are the foundations upon which whatever limited understanding I have achieved ultimately rests. 392 Vol. 34, 1978</page><page sequence="2">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 393 THE LWA What has come to be known variously as "voodoo," "vaudoux," "vaudou," or "vodun" in the literature is a syncretic system of theology and ceremonial which informs the religious life of the majority of Haiti's five million inhabitants. The Haitian Creole term vodoi,2 however, refers simply to a type of dance often held in the Haitian countryside, which does not necessarily occur in conjunction with religious ceremonial. When asked about their religion, then, Haitian rural dwellers will not respond by saying that they are "voodooists," or that they practice "voodoo." A more likely response would be "M se katolik, ?pi m k3n skvi lwa-yo" ("I am Catholic, and I serve the lwa"), or "M s' skvitk lwa" ("I am a servant of the lwa").3 The lwa, and peoples' service to them, are at the very core of Haitian folk religion. While God (B0 Dyb) is the creator of the universe, with Jesus (fizi) and the Holy Ghost (Set Espri) who help Him in His works; and though there are a host of other spirits, including the spirits of the dead (limb) and of twins (marasa) who must be regularly propitiated; it is the lwa who are most occupied with humans, and vice versa. The lwa live in a land called Gin2.4 Gine looks much like Haiti; the ancestors of the Haitians themselves are said to have come from there as well. The term itself is derived from the French "Guin6e" for Africa, but has lost its geographical referent for the contemporary Haitian peasant. Today it is simply the land of the lwa. There are believed to be about 21 nations (nasiz) or types of lwa, although this number varies from region to region. Some of the nations are grouped in wider categories and are said "to walk together." All of the nations are subdivided into a number of different kinds or subtypes, which are named. Again, these subtypes vary in number and name from region to region. Each named subtype or category of lwa has its own particular characteristics, both "physical" and temperamental. Nations are made up of individuals who are either male or female, 2 Transcriptions of Haitian Creole terms are based on the "Laubach System" (Hall 1953). The circumflex (^) indicates nasalization. The accent aigu (') and the accent grave (') over the "e" are as in French. Over "o," the accent grave indicates the French open "o." The "ou" is as in French, the "ch" as in English "sh," and the "j" as in French "z." 3 For the purposes of this paper, the term "voodoo" has been adopted to refer to the Haitian religious system under discussion. Ideally, all of these terms should be dropped from the literature, but for stylistic reasons a single term denoting "the religion of the majority of Haiti's population" is both convenient and necessary. Since no such term exists in the language of the people themselves, I have chosen to utilize that form which is most clearly distinct from the Haitian Creole "vodofi." 4 The following precis of voodoo theology highlights only the most important features of the belief system, as they are pertinent to the subsequent discussion of ritual activities. These basic understandings concerning the nature of the lwa and their activities represent the shared, nonspecialized knowledge of the adult members of a particular rural community. Regional variations in religious ideology and practice will be noted where relevant.</page><page sequence="3">394 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH but not both. Particular nations (or subtypes within them) are known for their emotional characteristics in their relations with humans, characteristics which may vary from ferocity to docility, patience to intemperateness, gravity to ribaldry. The subtypes are also generally associated with such physical traits as strength, age, or deformity. It should be stressed that each category of lwa comprises a vast population of individual spirits living in Gina. These individual lwa have their own distinctive personalities as well, partly determined by membership in a particular nation and subtype, but partly a matter of individual variation. Thus, the world of the lwa exhibits much of the diversity so familiar in society itself, and the Haitians view their deities as highly personalized and anthropomorphic in character. Individual lwa of each nation and subtype are associated with particular families of Haitians. While the lwa are simply called by their nation and subtype names, it is clear to everyone that any of the lwa of one family are quite distinct spiritual entities from the lwa of the same type associated with another family (Murray 1977:Chapter 11). While the complexities of Haitian family organization and its relationship to the worship of the lwa have yet to be worked out in detail, it will be sufficient for our purposes to point out that the "family" is a bilateral kin group, usually tracing common descent to a shared set of grandparents or great-grandparents. Any individual, then, is a member of at least two distinct families, composed of the descendants of his father's parents and his mother's parents, respec- tively. The lwa of each family are the lwa which were traditionally served by the grandparents, are said to have been inherited in turn from their own sets of grandparents, and represent an amalgam of the once distinct sets of lwa associated with more distant ancestors. This tie between the family and the lwa is paralleled by a link between the lwa and the land. The lwa come to Haiti from Gina for a variety of reasons. Each lwa has a station or depot (d6po) at which it arrives on its way to join its devotees. These depo are located throughout the countryside, and include such natural and man-made landmarks as streams and trees, or the gate of the original family residence. This type of landmark is specific for each nation, while each individual spirit has its own particular spot. The family's lwa all have their depo on or near the site of the home of the grandparents (or great-grandparents) of contemporary adults. That part of this land which contains the greatest concentration of such locations is the traditional site of the family's ritual activities, known as the mazi. The mazi is ideally never alienated from family ownership, though usufruct rights in it are transmitted bilaterally to family members, much as fee simple rights are transmitted in any other parcel of family land.</page><page sequence="4">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 395 The lwa themselves are inherited bilaterally, much as land; however, the lwa are the collective responsibility of the bilateral group, while land is usually divided into individually owned plots. When referred to in its capacity as a group serving the lwa, the family is called by the same term as inherited land itself: eritaj. The lwa, the family, and their land are thus inextricably bound together, through time, by these features of the rural belief system. The lwa have power to affect both the physical world and the life-chances of members of "their" family. To accept the existence of the lwa is to be subject to these powers. The lwa are neither good nor bad by nature, but are capable of using their powers to help or to harm their devotees. Although the lwa are not ancestors, people, particularly in ritual contexts, often refer to themselves metaphorically as "children of the lwa"; and the lwa expect to be served and respected by their "children." At the same time, the lwa are often casually referred to as "like children themselves." They can be capricious, annoying, jealous, or petty, and are easily offended. The most important ritual activities of Haitian folk religion are efforts to come to terms with the lwa in order to insure that they will act with good will toward the family. If served well and generously, they can bring success, happiness, and good health. If neglected or slighted, they readily anger, and may bring misfortune to those who have ignored or insulted them. THE LITERATURE Three analytic approaches have characterized the study of voodoo: the culture-historical, the functional, and the psychological. Although the best exemplars of each of these three types of studies include detailed ethnographic descriptions of particular ritual events, their respective theoretical orientations tend to obscure the structural coher- ence and underlying significance of the act of worship itself in Haitian religious life. Interest in the origins and syncretic nature of voodoo may be traced to the work of Melville Herskovits, the first anthropologist to study it extensively. Herskovits, engaged in constructing a theory of Afro- American culture, was primarily concerned with demonstrating that voodoo was the product of acculturative processes whereby components of a fundamentally African heritage had been variously retained, reshaped, and re-interpreted upon contact with the Euro-American tradition in a New World context (Herskovits 1937a). His analytic strategy centered on a comparison of particular features of voodoo beliefs and rituals with those of present-day West African religions in a search for "Africanisms." Many of the names of the</page><page sequence="5">396 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH nations of the lwa in the voodoo pantheon, and some of their reputed characteristics, were shown to be derivative of those of Dahomean and Fon-Yoruban relgions. More substantive features of voodoo, such as the ritual importance of spirit possession and beliefs about the dead, were "understood" as deriving from a more generalized West African religious tradition (Herskovits 1971 [1937]:139-295; 1954). The fundamental "African-ness" of voodoo thus established, its syncretic nature was revealed with reference to yet another set of correspondences-this time between elements of voodoo and those of French Catholicism. Again, the voodoo pantheon was one focus of attention, and the assimilation of the names and characteristics of some Catholic saints to particular nations of lwa was noted (Herskovits 1937b). The use of parts of the Catholic litany for ritual purposes, and the general acceptance of Catholic doctrine concerning the Holy Trinity by the practitioners of voodoo, were cited as further evidence of syncretism. In considering Afro-American culture in its relationship to an African past, however, Herskovits and those who have followed him in the study of voodoo (e.g., Courlander 1960; Metraux 1972 [1959]; Pollak-Eltz 1970), have been hampered by a formalist notion of culture. Culture is conceived as a series of traits, each of which may be examined on the basis of its form for evidence of its provenience. Voodoo, a syncretic religious system, emerges as a collection of such traits, each of which "looks" either more or less African or European. That these elements are integrated into a meaningful system of belief and ritual, and that this integration itself may be the most significant issue of the historical processes underlying the emergence of Haitian culture, are secondary considerations in this type of analysis. The functionalist approach attempts to link voodoo, not to an African past, but to other aspects of the Haitian present. For example, the entire complex of rural religious beliefs and practices has been convincingly described as a part of the folk-medical system of the Haitian peasant. In this view, voodoo is seen as the source of one set of possible explanations of and responses to illness, which, in the absence of easy access to modern Western technology, offer some sense of security and some actual measure of control in matters of sickness and health (Murray and Alvarez 1973). The social requirements of ritual activities have been said to "enhance family solidarity" (Simpson 1970:251). The belief system, especially as it concerns the use of certain kinds of power by malfekte, or evil-doers, and the role of the dead in the affairs of the living, has been interpreted as a set of moral sanctions concerning proper behavior in society (Simpson 1970:252).</page><page sequence="6">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 397 Perhaps the most exciting recent work on voodoo, based on field work in Haiti's Cul-de-Sac Plain, has unequivocally demonstrated the latent economic function of voodoo as a resource-circulating mecha- nism, linking the substantial costs of ritual to the sale of land (Murray 1977:Chapter 11). Finally, my own current work suggests that the economic aspects of voodoo may have further implications with respect to the concentration of cash in the hands of ritual specialists, and the subsequent re-investment of this amassed capital to underwrite the steadily increasing flow of rural Haitian emigrants in search of labor opportunities throughout the Caribbean and North America. In combination, these functional interpretations and others like them (e.g., Metraux 1972 [1959]; Simpson 1970) help to situate voodoo in its wider context as they trace the relationship between particular features of theology and ceremonial, on the one hand, and various nonreligious aspects of Haitian rural life, on the other. Yet here again, the analyses perforce cannot focus upon the integrity of ritual itself, nor the character or tone of the religious principles which ritual activity embodies and exemplifies. Unlike the culture-historical and functional approaches to Haitian religion, the psychological approach has been limited to concern with only a single aspect of voodoo ritual: spirit possession. Possession is in many ways the most important (and certainly the most striking) feature of voodoo ceremonial. As Bourguignon (1965) has pointed out, the concept of spirit possession is a folk theory applied to a psychological state of trance or dissociation. Psychological interpretations of voodoo attempt to replace this native theory with an empirical explanation of dissociative states, and to understand the causes and effects of trance phenomena within a scientific, as opposed to a mystical, frame of reference. The issue of whether or not trance, in the context of Haitian voodoo, may be seen as evidence of abnormality, was once hotly debated. A Haitian physician, J.-C. Dorsainvil (1931), went so far as to suggest that possession was the result of widespread psychopathology in the country- side, which, far from being the result of individual and social experience, was in fact related to the genetic characteristics of the Haitian people! This argument has been refuted by Haitians (Mars 1954; Price-Mars 1954 [1928]) and non-Haitians alike (Bourguignon 1970; Herskovits 1971 [1937]; Kiev 1964, 1968; Metraux 1972 [1959]). Anthropologists have tended to stress that trance is a normal, socially learned, and controlled phenomenon occurring within the context of religious worship, basing their arguments on the fact that it most often occurs only where and when considered appropriate, and involves patterned, systematic behavior on the part of those possessed</page><page sequence="7">398 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH (e.g., Herskovits 1971 [1937]:143). Others have stressed the therapeutic value of trance and dissociative states, either as cathartic experiences, which serve to release tension and anxiety in general (Bourguignon 1965:92), or as a part of effective curing rituals, which direct psycholog- ical energy against both physiological and psychosomatic illness (Kiev 1968). These psychologically oriented studies of spirit possession in Haitian voodoo suffer from two basic shortcomings. First, in concentrating on spirit possession, such studies have failed to discuss the psychological and emotional experiences of the great majority of devotees who do not enter trance states during a particular ceremony, and those who may not ever enter trance throughout a lifetime of worship. Second, in their efforts to explain trance and dissociation within a "rational" framework, most researchers have left the folk theory of spirit possession and its implications inadequately explored. Although the Haitian psychiatrist, Dr. Louis Mars, has noted that spirit possession is a "religious, dramatic and social phenomenon" taking place "in the framework of a collective performance" (1954:72), no actual analysis of voodoo ritual had yet been governed principally by these concerns. It is precisely these two features of ritual-its social organization in terms of collective performance and its cultural underpinnings in terms of possession belief-that are definitive of Haitian voodoo for its practitioners. The discussion which follows suggests that both the theological and experiential significance of worship within this religious system emerge from the ritual process which successfully articulates this set of culturally patterned expecta- tions with a particular mode of collective participation. THE SEVIS LWA5 IN SOUTHERN HAITI Service, in the form of offerings to the lwa, may be deemed appropriate under a number of different circumstances. Consultation for purposes of divination or requests for aid in particular matters should be accompanied by small offerings made by the individual concerned. Specific instances of illness or continuing misfortune, if attributed to the dissatisfaction of a particular lwa, may be treated by means of a minor ceremony of appeasement (pri'), often attended only by the sufferer and his/her immediate family. The general prosperity and good health of the family and its members, however, is dependent upon the performance of much larger rituals known as skvis Iwa, in which the entire 6ritaj is expected to participate. 5 This discussion and analysis of voodoo ritual is based on an ethnographic case study of a particular shvis lwa (service for the twa), a series of structured interviews, and more informal discussions with informants concerning the general features of ritual service to the spirits.</page><page sequence="8">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 399 These sevis are of varying scale and frequency, in accordance with the means and "piety" of any given eritaj. Many families hold a relatively small sevis annually during the peak harvest season (mid- December to January), propitiating those three or four lwa who have been traditionally most important to the &amp;ritaj. It is explained that the lwa, observing the relative prosperity of this season, "want their share, too." In addition, once every decade or so, each family is expected by its spirits to hold a much larger service (gro skvis) for all those nations that have taken an active role, either negative or positive, in the family's affairs. The specific nations involved differ from family to family; the importance of particular nations also seems to vary regionally. Usually, eight to twelve nations are served in the course of a sevis of this kind. Ideally, a gro sevis should be offered voluntarily; that is, out of generalized devotion to the lwa. Owing to the great expenditure of both resources and effort that any sevis requires, however, the family most often takes a pragmatic view of its responsibilities, and postpones the performance of a large-scale sevis until the dissatisfaction of the lwa is manifest. A series of misfortunes or illness episodes befalling various members of the family in close succession usually constitute the precipitating cause of the gro sevis, since they are interpreted as the lwa's "chastisement" of the family for its continuing neglect. While the lwa's dissatisfaction with the family is often phrased in terms of the fact that "the lwa are hungry and have not been fed for a long time," their expectations of service are actually seen as including more than just the provision of food. In addition to food and drink, the lwa are said to love song and dance. To serve the lwa well and completely, then, is to offer them not only the culinary but the musical delights which people are capable of providing. The sevis lwa6 is a ritual organized so as to make these pleasures available to the lwa in ways thought to be acceptable to them. It is a design for satisfying the appetites of the lwa. To understand the significance of this act of worship as it is created and experienced by its participants, we must consider both its structure and its purpose, as well as the principles that govern its successful execution. STRUCTURAL COMPONENTS OF THE SAVIS While the lwa all like food and music, each nation of lwa has its own 6 The term "sevis" will hereinafter be used to refer to all sevis lwa in which the entire &amp;ritaj is involved, regardless of scale. The ritually important features of the annual sbvis and the gro sevis are the same and, in fact, this semantic distinction is only rarely employed by Haitians themselves. Further, it should again be stressed that pronounced regional variation is perhaps one of the most characteristic features of Haitian religion (Mintz 1972). The description and generalizations recorded here are strictly applicable only to a single such variant, practiced today in the rural areas of the Fond-des-N'gres region, centrally located in Haiti's southern peninsula. The question of regional variation will be taken up more explicitly in the concluding section of the paper.</page><page sequence="9">400 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH particular tastes with respect to food, and prefers one of several basic musical types. Coupled with the belief that the various lwa are often very jealous of each other, especially about being "fed," these beliefs account for the overall structure of the s6vis. THE SEAERMONI The sevis consists of a series of distinct serimoni (ceremonies), each constituting a separate food offering to the lwa of a particular nation, which are of importance to the family, or to the lwa of a group of nations, who are throught to "walk together," i.e., are capable of being served at the same seremoni. The particular order of the s6r6moni-that is, the order in which the family's lwa of each relevant nation are served-is based on a number of determinant factors. Certain lwa have the power to impede the progress of the s6vis if they are not served first and satisfied. Thus, Boulatch6 and Met Kafou (Master of the Crossroads) should be served in a joint ceremony on the weekend preceding the balance of a gro sevis. Boulatche is a violent and powerful nation of lwa, and Met Kafou has the power to block the crossroads to all lwa on their way to receive the offerings of the family. In like fashion, Legwa (L6gba in other regions of Haiti, Master of the Gate) can close the gate to the other lwa, and must be cajoled into keeping it open. Thus, when the main part of any sevis begins, the first nation to be served is Legwa. The other nations should be served on particular days of the week, and, in some instances, at particular times of the day. These protocols further influence the order of the s6r6moni. Single s&amp;r6moni are created around the central activity of the food offering. Part of that offering is usually livestock; at one level of analysis, each ser6moni may be understood as beginning with the presentation of dry goods and livestock, climaxing with the sacrifice of the offered animal, and concluding with the bleeding of the slaughtered sacrifice. The animal, however, must then be prepared and cooked, and finally offered in cooked form to the lwa for consumption. In most cases, the lwa then eat the "soul" of the cooked food, while the actual meat is divided up for consumption by all family members. Other sir6moni should not begin until this final division of the food from the preceding s6r6moni takes place. Thus, the sevis becomes a relatively long event, lasting anywhere from 15 to 80 hours, depending on the number of lwa to be served. All adult family members are present and active during this entire time, although the periods of food preparation following each s6r6moni afford most of them the opportu- nity for a few hours rest.</page><page sequence="10">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 401 Music AND THE B^BOCH The different tastes of the Iwa with respect to song and dance divide the sevis into at least two (and sometimes three or four, depending upon the particular lwa to be served) distinct musical phases. Boulatche and Met Kafou, mentioned above, are served with the boulakata, a simple percussion instrument consisting of a large piece of bamboo, ten to twelve feet in length, supported at either end and played simultaneously by a number of men with wooden sticks. Singing and dancing specifically appropriate to the service of these two nations accompany the music. The baboch (party/dance) thus generated emerges as an aspect of the seremoni, proceeds concurrently with it, and is attended by a number of invited friends in addition to the family. Since this preliminary phase of the gro sevis may be omitted in the case of smaller-scale family services, the biboch boulakata is not an invariant musical feature of the sevis lwa. Legwa, who must be satisfied at the commencement of every sevis, and a number of other lwa who may or may not be included in a particular family's devotions, are served with a cappella singing accompanied by handclapping. There are some cha/t lwa (songs for the lwa) appropriate to each of these deities, and others which may be sung in service to any lwa. These a cappella performances all take place within the context of individual seremoni, which occupy the first few hours or the first day of the sevis, depending upon the actual number of lwa to be served in this fashion. The family, some affines, and a few close freinds are most often the only ones in attendance. Following these seremoni, which are usually timed to end on a Friday afternoon, the drums (tabou) arrive at the site of the service. Dancing and singing, accompanied by the drums, continues from dusk on Friday until mid-morning the following day. Many of the most important lwa must be served with drumming, and this all-night musical event is a necessary part of any gro sevis. The baboch tabou is held under a brush shelter outside the kay lwa, a two-room house located on the family's mazi, which is the center of activity during the entire sevis. This biboch continues uninterruptedly as a series of s&amp;remoni are conducted nearby for those lwa who prefer the music of the t.bou. It has many of the characteristics of a secular vododi dance (although I will argue that it does not simply represent the recreational or secular component of the setvis), and attracts a large crowd of the family's friends and neighbors, including many uninvited guests. Up to 250 people may attend this part of a sevis. The final musical phase of the se~vis is again an all-night b*boch, but of a very different kind. It accompanies the saramoni for a group of lwa</page><page sequence="11">402 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH who are members of related nations, known as the Iwa bla.7 When offerings to those lwa are a part of a family's sevis, their s&amp;remoni and biboch conclude the ritual and last from Saturday evening until Sunday morning. The strangely foreign tastes of the lwa bla, which include a decided predilection for Ritz Crackers, also extend to music. They are served with the violb (violin), accompanied by a small drum and a large tambourine with a drumhead attached. This trio plays what appears to be a Haitian version of pre-nineteenth-century French dance music, including the mrnwat (minuet) and katridas (contredanse). The biboch viol6 also attracts a number of people, especially older men and women who can more easily participate in its less strenuous dance routines. The musical profile of the sevis, then, has its own characteristic shape, peaking with the biboch tabou on Friday night, which is unrivalled in its intensity, number of participants, and sheer excitement for the sevite. It has been argued by Herskovits (1971 [1937]:Chapter IX and X) that the biboch is of secondary importance as an aspect of religious worship and, rather, represents an essentially optional, recreational accompaniment to the offertory ends pursued within the framework of the s6r6moni themselves. This is decidedly not the case, at least in the area under study. There is an essential and integral connection between the aesthetic and performative features of the sevis and its devotional ends. This connection goes beyond the simple fact that the lwa are said to desire song and dance; its precise nature has to do with the folk theory of possession and its ritual importance. SUCCESSFUL WORSHIP AND THE PRESENCE OF THE LWA Although the various s&amp;remoni constituting a sevis differ with respect to their particular ritual details, in accordance with the tastes of the particular lwa being served, they all may be seen to share a common ultimate purpose and, based on the requirement for successfully achieving this goal, a common process and nature as acts of worship. The lwa themselves know best how they like to be served, especially with respect to the details of actual sacrifice, which act they themselves should perform. Also, evidence of the acceptability of any major offering involves the lwa arriving to receive it "in person." The success 7 Haitian Creole "bla" has two distinct referents. With respect to objects, it signifies the color white. When applied to people, however, it is most accurately glossed as "foreigner," and is applied to individuals of all races and complexions. Here the term seems to be partially relevant in both senses. The lwa bla are ritually associated with the color white and with a preference of foreign consumer goods and styles. Significantly, however, these lwa are not themselves thought of as "foreign" in any sense, having the same ancience and provenience (Gins) as their spiritual colleagues.</page><page sequence="12">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 403 of each s&amp;remoni ultimately rests on the occurrence of possession-the coming of the spirits to Haiti, and their assumption of visible form by entering the body and mind of a devotee. Thus, the immediate and recognized end of the s&amp;r6moni ritual leading up to the sacrifice itself is to induce possession; that is, to attract the lwa to the s&amp;remoni and to allow them to "mount" one or more of the sevite. For possession to occur, the lwa must be called from Gins, made aware that a s6remoni for them is taking place, and attracted to it. Sound is the medium through which the Iwa are called. The ringing of a bell, the clapping of hands, a song, and the music of a dance-all can be heard by the lwa in Gins. If executed properly, they will attract the lwa to those whose voices and bodies are creating them. Just what "properly" means here is the key to understanding Haitian ritual performance and its crucial role in voodoo worship. Each s&amp;remoni opens with a fixed number of prayers from the Catholic litany, recited responsively from memory in French, i.e., in as close an approximation to French as nonspeakers are able to reproduce from memory. These prayers are followed by the chanting of a number of katik (canticles), learned in church, again in French. The prayer and songs are not actually directed to the lwa, but stand as an opening invocation to the Holy Trinity and the saints to bless the proceedings and the participants. They are performed by rote, and seem neither to engage nor to inspire most of the devotees. Likewise with the lwa, who are not thought to be attracted by these performances, whose character- istic mood or tone is one of solemnity and seriousness coupled with lack of interest. Following the katik, however, the calling of the lwa proceeds in earnest as the devotees begin the singing of the chite lwa. Some of the chit6 lwa may include references to Catholic belief, such as the name of Sainte Marie Madeleine or La Vierge Marie, but stand in marked contrast to actual church songs because they always include references to the lwa, either in general or in particular, and to their powers. Furthermore, these songs are sung in Creole, the language of the worshippers. Far from being learned by rote, they form part of the traditional repertoire of song and dance which is at the heart of the sevite's cultural heritage. A set number of chate lwa of particular kinds, each with a specified number of verses, should mark the commencement of the calling of the Iwa. In many of the seremoni, however, informants pointed out that a number offot (mistakes) had been made in executing these formal ritual ideals, in the sense of a recognized discrepancy on the part of participants between ideal ritual form and actual practice. Fortunately, they were quick to explain, it is not proper form that makes the ch.t6</page><page sequence="13">404 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH lwa effective in attracting the spirits. Nor is it the lyrics themselves that are thought to bring the lwa, although explicit references may be made within the songs to the food that has been prepared and is awaiting their arrival. Rather, the lwa will be attracted to the s6r6moni if (and only if) the performance of the chit6 lwa is cho (hot). People exhort each other to chofe seiremoni-a (heat up the ceremony) with their songs, and if the lwa are slow in arriving it is said that the s&amp;remoni is simply not hot enough. The s6remoni is cho in direct proportion to the degree of involve- ment and enthusiasm of the participants in performing the chit6 lwa. It is this enthusiasm which is so attractive to the lwa. Slowly at first, and then more rapidly, the excitement at the s&amp;remoni mounts, as each chite lwa is performed. Handclapping and some dancing may accom- pany the songs. Finally, all are fully engaged in creating and enjoying that combination of sound and motion that is so pleasing to people they attribute to it the power of attracting their gods. The concept cho also applies to the several biboch described above. Those s6remoni held during the course of a baboch are prepared by family members inside or near the kay lwa while the dancing continues outside. Following the invocation to the Catholic deities, the family joins the other dancers and the "heat" of the baboch itself attracts the lwa who are to be served. After a family member is possessed by the appropriate lwa, the family and the lwa retire to complete the s6remoni. Following the completion of the sacrifice, both the Iwa and the family return to enjoy the pleasures of the biboch. The biboch may thus be seen both as a call to receive service, and as one aspect of the offering itself. While the family is responsible for the food offerings which the Iwa receive, it is clearly dependent as well upon the musical participa- tion of the community to serve successfully a number of its spirits. One of the most important features of voodoo worship is revealed in the concept cho. Ritual details (e.g., the spatial arrangement of food offerings, or the number and order of Catholic prayers to be performed) are relatively devalued by both the devotees and their deities, for if the song and/or dance are cho, the lwa will come to accept the offering as given or rearrange it to suit their tastes.8 Successful worship-worship that is ultimately pleasing and satisfying for the lwa-is not predicated on an accurate replication of form, but rather on enthusiastic involve- 8 The active role of the lwa in the organization and performance of their own worship, made possible through possession, has important implications with respect to the relative importance of ritual specialists within this religious system. While the skills of such practitioners, both male (oAga) and female (mabo), are highly valued, particularly for the diagnosis and treatment of specific illness episodes, their expensive services as organizers of family ritual are often downgraded by non-specialists. Such sentiments are expressed explicitly: "You may invite the ofig, as you would invite anyone, but it is the lwa who make the sevis."</page><page sequence="14">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 405 ment in song and dance. These, then, are an intrinsic part of worship and, in fact, its precondition; if the lwa are not successfully called, the s6remoni cannot proceed. The song and dance of voodoo ritual, and the nature of people's involvement in it, are clearly instrumental to the induction of trance or dissociative states (Ludwig 1968:72-74). The culutral significance of the concept cho and the act of calling the lwa, however, is not simply that they are objectively effective in bringing on trance. Rather, this effectiveness helps to create a subjective reality for the sevite in which the essence of worship comes to be participation in the collective creation of song and dance. Religious experience in the context of the s vis is, above all, kinetic and aural, sensual and aesthetic. Fervent devotion is virtually defined in tetms of activities which are felt to be pleasurable and satisfying in and of themselves. Thus, the sevis cannot be said to have a recreational or entertainment "component" in addition to its religious features; wor- ship, in fact, is recreation, and prayer is entertainment, in Haitian voodoo. The pervasive dichotomization of experience in the Judeo- Christian tradition, which associates secular/religious with sensual/ spiritual distinctions, is of little analytic value here. Beyond this merging of the satifying and the sacred in voodoo ritual, possession belief has further implications for those who, through it, are brought into a direct social relationship with their gods. In addition to the family's lwa, who come to the s&amp;remoni in order to receive their tribute, many other lwa may visit the sevis simply because the excitement of the ch.te lwa and of the baboch attract them to it. The family lwa can only possess the members of the family, but each family member also has at least one other set of lwa (those of his/her second set of grandparents), who may come to "mount" them during the sevis. Also, the lwa of friends and affines may arrive for the festivities. Thus, in the course of a sevis, almost anyone attending may become possessed, and a large number of possessions will take place, especially on the night of the tabou dance. Visits by 35 to 40 lwa are not uncommon in the course of a three-day ceremony. What this means is that, during the sevis, participants are almost constantly in the immediate presence of supernatural beings and power. "Supernatural," in fact, is perhaps an inappropriate term, for in common usage it stands in contrast to "natural" and "real." The most important thing about possession, as it is understood by those who worship the Iwa, is that it demonstrates how patently real and natural the spirits are. As it was put to the writer by one skeptical informant: "I don't really believe in the lwa, but when they come to me or to someone else it doesn't matter if you believe in them or not-there they are!"</page><page sequence="15">406 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH Not only are they there, but they are active as well. Possession is not just a passive manifestation of the reality of the lwa. Rather, the gods become visible and articulate as they take over the bodies of the s6vite, and actively participate in social interaction with their devotees. When a Iwa first enters an individual9 there usually follows a brief period of inarticulate vocalization, including humming and yelping, accompanied by what is apparently uncontrolled gesticulation and body movement. After a few moments, however, the lwa has settled into the body of its "horse" and gains control of the oral and kinetic functions. The body speaks, but not with the voice of the individual who has been displaced; the body moves, but with a grace and power clearly not within the range of the everyday capacities of the unpos- sessed. It is obvious to all that the lwa is in control. It is held that when the lwa possess a person and become a part of the s6vis, they are on good terms with everyone. They may argue and complain (about the size of an offering, for example), but will never do harm to anyone while they are in visible form. Thus, they are not at all feared, and their arrival excites and pleases everyone. This is true not only because the coming of the lwa signals the success of the ser6moni, but because, throughout the sevis, the coming of any lwa means the presence of a new and very special participant in song and dance. The lwa, it is said, are not content simply to receive the offerings of the sevite-to listen to song and to watch the dance. They possess the bodies of their sevite not only to reveal themselves, but so as to be able to sing and to dance for themselves-to experience the pleasures of kinetic and musical creativity that only the corporeal can enjoy. After greeting the sevite, and talking for a while to the group or to individuals (concerning the s6r6moni, the family, past and future 9 For the possessed themselves, we can only speculate about the quality of the experience. It is expected that those possessed will remember nothing of what they have done or said, nothing of what they have felt, while their bodies have been inhabited by the lwa. This professed amnesia is probably genuine in most cases; in any event, it is considered impolite even to mention an individual's possession experience to them. Often they will deny ever having been possessed at all. While it is clear that possession represents a truly altered state of consciousness, rather than a simple theatrical performance or sham, it is difficult to discover or to explicate what the nature of that alteration might be. From my own observations of the lwa, however, I would suggest that possession involves, at the very least, an increased precision and fluidity of body movement, coupled with an apparent loss of self-consciousness and the sense of control over the body itself. (For what strikes this writer as a particularly relevant discussion of these and related issues, see Bateson 1972). The body seems endowed with an energy and endurance which counteract the effects of fatigue and allow the lwa to dance for hours on end with no pause. The possessed appear to achieve a total, single-minded concentration on whatever they are doing, particularly in dance. Their bodies merge completely with the sound of drums and singing, and appear to respond immediately and effortlessly to this aural stimulus. Although we may never discover precisely how this state is perceived or sustained by those who are possessed, it is the implications of the occurrence, and the interpretation of possession in the wider context of the ritual, which are of primary concern in the present analysis.</page><page sequence="16">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 407 events), the lwa consistently turn to singing and dancing. They ask the sevite to sing for them, or the drummers play, and then they take the lead role as the performance proceeds. For those who are not possessed, singing and dancingfor the lwa becomes singing and dancing with the lwa. The opportunity to share the act of aesthetic creation with the gods themselves is perhaps the ultimate satisfaction of voodoo worship, and no performances equal in intensity, enthusiasm, and involvement those which include the lwa as participants. STRUCTURING ENTHUSIASM: AESTHETICS AND THE ORGANIZATION OF PARTICIPATION We have seen that the sevis, to fulfill its devotional ends, necessarily entails the organization of a series of collective performances in the kinetic and oral-auditory modes. As an occasion for aesthetic creativity, the sevis offers a whole range of potentially satisfying opportunities for the exercise and appreciation of skill, talent and imagination. It should be clear from the discussion above that Haitian aesthetic sensibilities are closely tied to the notion of full participation in the act of creation, rather than to passive contemplation or appreciation. Group performances, however, are organized in such a way as to allow for individual creativity as well as collective participation, and at the same time seem to succeed in distributing the satisfactions of skill and success among all participants. Underlying the variety of musical forms that play a part in the sevis, there is a similarity of design with respect to what might be called "structures of participation" or patterns of performance. In song, in dance, and in drumming, individual performances are set against a backdrop of group participation. Chate lwa are performed in a call-and-response pattern, with the group either repeating the short verses of the leader or singing the same chorus to a series of verses. Other songs of the same form, but with different lyrics, as well as some chate Iwa, accompany tabou and viol6 music. In all of these songs, however, it is neither the lyrics nor the melodies that are thought of as beautiful or exciting. Rather, it is the way in which they are performed that may be pleasing and satisfying. The leader may experiment with tonal changes and glides, or sing a series of nonsense syllables in place of lyrics, much like "scat" singing in American jazz. The group often provides an elaborate rhythmic structure by syncopating handclapping with the basic rhythm of the song. The group performance itself is never really "in unison." Rather, a unity emerges from a series of systematic harmonic and rhythmic variations around a central theme represented by the chat6 lwa in its</page><page sequence="17">408 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH most basic form. Thus, even as a member of the group, an individual may exercise a certain amount of personal creativity. Furthermore, the leadership role is shifting, and any individual may "put" a song if he/she so desires. This changing leadership is linked to the feeling that the lwa will be more pleased if a number of family members (and friends, if the occasion for singing is the baboch) take it upon themselves to lead songs. Dancing to the music of the tabou also highlights the activity of an individual, and likewise involves a constant alternation of personnel who successively become the center of attention. A large group of people forms around the drums, with many more in front facing the battery of instruments than behind. The crowd leaves an open, semicircular space, however, right in front of the three drums. For each piece that is played and/or sung, a single individual (sometimes, but rarely, a pair) does a rF (round). That is, one person dances to the drums in the area directly in front of them. As the piece ends, another performer will move into the area to take a turn or, if no one appears, the individual may stay and do another rO. The activities of the crowd, however, are also essential, both to the performance of the individual and in terms of attracting the lwa. First, the crowd itself forms or defines the space within which the individual performance takes place. Their singing and handclapping combines with the drumming itself to create for the individual the aural context which is the setting for the dance. Caught up in this sound, the dancers seem able to give themselves over entirely to the rhythmic structure of the music. Although a series of set steps form the basis of any dance (there are particular dances appropriate for each of four basic drum rhythms), the embellishment of these forms with rhythmically complex movements of the arms, head, hands, and hips is what distinguishes the best dances from others. The crowd responds with redoubled enthu- siasm in their singing and handclapping, and often with direct comments (the most frequent is "bay-la cho!" ("the thing is hot!"]), to the successful creations of the dancer. This interaction with the crowd seems to sustain the performer's efforts and involvement. The structure of participation in dancing to the viol6 seems less complex, but is still based on individual/group patterns of involvement. Dances are most often performed in cross-sexed couples, following the basic pattern of European ballroom dancing. Usually, a fixed number of couples (two or four) take part in a ro. Their performances are coordinated much like those of an American square dance, by the shouted directions of a caller. Complex steps and changes in partner are fixed for each type of dance, and signalled by the caller, but again, it is the way in which these moves are embellished that is most often the</page><page sequence="18">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 409 focus of comments of appreciation. The caller is the solo performer here, and people are recognized as good or bad callers on the basis of the fluidity with which they are able to direct the dancers' movements. Only rarely does singing accompany the music of the viol6, but the larger group involves itself with handclapping and encouraging com- ments to the dancers. Some dancing to the violo involves a large number of couples, each dancing on their own, without the coordina- tion of a caller, and seems a closer approximation to ballroom dancing. Here again, however, those not actually dancing will be attending to the music and to the dancers, and participating with handclapping and a running commentary on the quality of the dance. The significance of the underlying similarities which crosscut all of these forms of creative expression involved in the sevis10 has to do with the way in which their various structures of performance shape the aesthetic experiences of the participants. The satisfactions of participa- tion in the creation of a thing of beauty, appreciated by men and their god alike, are in some sense open to and enjoyed by all, regardless of their individual skills. At the same time, the participation of the group creates a temporal (and, as in dance before the tabou, a spatial) structure of sound and motion that becomes a "stage" for the expression and display of individual competence and improvisational skill. Ulti- mately, individual performances, no matter how distinctive or skillful, are merged again into the total group production. Each song, each dance, becomes a whole unit, which, in virtue of its being simultaneous- ly created and appreciated by all, is enjoyable and satisfying in ways that the simple contemplation of another's performance never can be. As Lomax (1970:193) has suggested for a much wider sample of Afro-American and African music, the non-complex structure of text and tune and the multileveled structure of. . . performance styles facilitate group participation, opening the door for anyone present to make a contrastive and complementary personal contribution to the song-dance performance (italics added) Thus, the enthusiasm and involvement so necessary for the successful enactment of ritual devotion are, in effect, generated by the aesthetic principles that govern both the form and the execution of group performance. Traditional voodoo performances are structured so as simultaneously to encourage and channel that full, active participation in the collection creation of song and dance that maintains and articulates the ritual relationships among human beings and their gods. 10 The baboch boulakata, not observed in its entirety, has been omitted from the present discussion. The structure of instrumental performance itself, while conforming to the basic pattern described, is experientially relevant for only a very limited number of participants, and has also been omitted here in the interest of brevity.</page><page sequence="19">410 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH CONCLUSION This paper has presented a description and tentative analysis of the sevis lwa in southern Haiti. In discussing this ritual event, I have attempted to highlight what I take to be its most salient featuresfrom the point of view of the participants themselves. While my approach from the "outside" has been necessarily analytic, it is through focusing on the perceptions and experiences of the worshippers that I have tried to make "sense" of the sevis. Whatever actual analysis is implicit in the presentation goes no further than to suggest that the sevis itself, and the variation activities that make it up, are structured, organized, and experienced in relation to (1) certain basic theological tenets concerning the nature and powers of the lwa, on the one hand; and (2) a particular aesthetic principle governing collective performance, on the other. In concluding, I will briefly re-examine some of the issues raised in the discussion of the literature, to suggest that even this programmatic first attempt to approach voodoo on its own terms, as a coherent cultural system focusing on collective worship, may offer some new perspectives on the problems which have heretofore stimulated social scientific interest in Haitian religion. Psychological interpretations of the significance of voodoo must come to terms with the profound implications of ritual participation (particularly with respect to the occurrence of possession and the organization of performance) for the life of any devotee. These conse- quences of religious experience are felt at the "conscious," as well as the "unconscious," level. This conceptual distinction itself may cease to be heuristic as we move beyond classic psychological concerns to a more integral understanding of the subjective implications of face-to-face interaction with the lwa themselves, in the context of group creative activity. The standard question of psychopathology and its manifesta- tions, or of psychosomatic disequilibrium and its remedies, must necessarily be refined (if not replaced) by new lines of inquiry concerning such interrelated phenomena as motivation, satisfaction, skill, grace, faith, and ecstasy (Bateson 1972). These are clearly fundamental facets of the psychological reality of voodoo worship. With regard to the social "functions" of this religious system, it is interesting to note that while the sevis takes on its characteristic form and meaning as a ritual concerned with the relationships between humans and spirits, its successful enactment stands as an implicit demonstration of the appropriate organization and tone of interpersonal relations and cooperation as well. That some measure of diffuse and enduring "group solidarity" may emerge from collective participation in ritual is not really the issue here. To re-invest this essentially Durkheimian generalization with analytic significance is to begin to</page><page sequence="20">RITUAL PERFORMANCE AND RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE 411 attend to the particular kinds of collective activity which any given ritual entails, the ways in which such group performances are coordinated, and the nature and distribution of the rewards which motivate individual participation in such events. Only then may we start to trace the complex interconnections that link ritual activity to the perceived and actual relationships of individuals in wider social groupings within particular sociocultural contexts. Finally, although the mode of analysis followed within the discus- sion is basically synchronic, it may be fruitful to turn our attention, in closing, to a reconsideration of some problems in the culture-history of voodoo. As we have seen, the concept of possession and a principle of performance together constitute the essential features of the cultural context within which each sevis unfolds. These, in large measure, both define and enable the successful ritual maintenance of the human/lwa relationship. Ethnographic descriptions of voodoo in other areas of the island, both rural and urban (Herskovits 1971 [1937]; M6traux 1972 [1959]; Simpson 1970), provide some additional confirmation for this assertion. In spite of marked regional variation in almost every other regard, possession and performance are everywhere a part of Haitian religion. These accounts further indicate that regional variants may differ significantly with respect to certain sociological features of religious organization. Rural/urban differences are, not surprisingly, particularly clearcut. In and around the capital, Port-au-Prince, the lwa's asso- ciations with family and land are not reported. Rather, the lwa are conceptualized as a discrete number of named, individual spirits constituting a pantheon. Worship is organized around cult centers (oi4o) established by professional, trained specialists. A devotee's associations with particular lwa are conceived in terms of an affiliation with one or more such specialists and their temples, while the group mobilized for holding a sevis comprises the individual members of a particular ofif6 (Metraux 1971 [1937]). These materials are introduced here simply to indicate the extent to which highly differentiated variants of voodoo have developed in particular socioeconomic contexts, while maintaining what is apparently a common cultural base in terms of the possession/ performance complex noted above. A student of the culture-history of Haitian religion, then, must face a whole set of problems both more fundamental and more difficult to resolve than questions of African vs. European provenience. First, what are the particularities of local social history throughout the island that gave rise to contemporary regional variation? Second, what more generalized sociological factors in pre-Revolutionary Haiti significantly shaped the historical and cultural processes which issue was the</page><page sequence="21">412 JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGICAL RESEARCH possession/performance complex itself, with its apparent centrality in the emergent religious system? Finally (and an adequate response to this question is clearly dependent upon prior consideration of those above), to what extent may we understand the development and persistence of voodoo in terms of the particular cultural resources which were brought to bear in its formation? This conclusion, most appropriately, stands as a series of questions concerning the past, the present, and (if implicitly) the future of voodoo in Haiti. Even partial responses to these are well beyond the scope of this article and the current knowledge of its author. That they might be posed is perhaps the most significant product of this ethnographic exercise. BIBLIOGRAPHY BATESON, GREGORY 1972 Style, Grace and Information in Primitive Art.
