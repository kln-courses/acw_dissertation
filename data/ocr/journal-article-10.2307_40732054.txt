<plain_text><page sequence="1">Colonization Circulars: Timber Cycles in the Time of Famine Kathryn Miles When the trees were enchanted, In the expectation of not being trees, The trees uttered their voices From strings of harmony, The disputes ceased. ("Cad Goddeu," tr. Robert Williams1) In the sixth century poem "Cad Goddeu," Gwydion the magician bewitches a forest, turning the trees into soldiers. Once converted, they soon form a formidable army in which alder trees become "the head of the line," followed by willows, plum trees, "quickly moving" oak, "provoked" cherry-trees, "high-minded" birch, and a whole host of determined conifers, all of whom take on the anthropomorphic attributes of a communal army. These trees qua men unite to avenge Arawn, king of Annwfn, whose animals have been stolen by a ploughman named Amaethon and who thus desires restitution. "Cad Goddeu" has enjoyed a controversial place in scholarship, alternately cited as justification for Robert Graves' s contested alphabet of trees and as an early example of Welsh satire.2 It also figures as a useful catalogue of early Celtic silviculture, cataloguing and assigning value to the various species inhabiting the depleted forests of Wales. 1 Williams, Robert (tr.), "Cad Gaddeu," Four Ancient Books of Wales, ed.

Accessed 4 February 2007.)</page><page sequence="2">KATHRYN MILES I find this last interpretation of "Cad Goddeu" particularly interesting, especially when one also considers the juxtaposition of these trees and the humans with which they coexist. In this regard, the poem figures as a prescient vision of over a millennium of similar metonymy. Indeed, this conflation of men and trees, along with the suspect acquisition of land and property, is an apt metaphor for land use patterns throughout Ireland, Scotland, and Wales. For nearly two thousand years, Celtic subjectivity and ecology have been elided with the consequence of allowing colonial powers to exploit both. At no time is this more apparent than during the height of famine-era immigration, an epoch that also represents the climax of the Celtic forest crisis. Beginning in the mid-nineteenth century, the disenfranchised rural occupants were again represented as a forest of trees, not to avenge their stolen land but, rather, to allow for such land to be taken from them. And it was the British government instead of a staff-wielding magician who completed the conversion. Through a series of parliamentary votes, peasant farmers were first rendered into planks and staves and then shipped to colonial North America in the holds of timber ships. Printed artifacts from the era support this rendering. Consider, for instance, an immigration ad from the famed coffin ship, The Jeanie Johnston, which appeared in the July 31, 1850 issue of the Tralee Chronicle. Intended to lure potential émigrés on board, the ad begins with a confident assertion of the ship's comforts: She is, as usual, fitted up with every care and attention to the health and comfort of the passenger, is well ventilated, and has a capacious Life Boat in addition to her other boats. Immediately following this account is a reminder of the boat's primary function: For all particulars, apply at the Office of the Owners, John Donovan and Sons, Tralee: who have also for sale a cargo of prime Red and Yellow Pine Timber, Oak, Ash, Elm, Birch, Pine and Spruce Deals, Oak 119</page><page sequence="3">COLONIZATION CIRCULARS Pipe and Barrel Staves, Spars, Oars, etc., which they have just landed from this ship. This idea, that readers of the ad would be interested either in boarding the ship for Canada or taking from it some newly harvested Canadian timber, intrigues me on several different levels, particularly insofar as it seems to offer the readers a fairly distinct series of choices: escape or expand, fit for travel or fit for timber, buy or become cargo. Other ship advertisements from the same time use similar language; so much so, in fact, that the two functions of these famine- era ships began to assume aspects of one another. This raises an obvious question for me: when considering the history of colonization and human ecology, can we actually separate the two uses of these so-called coffin ships? Or, put another way, are these functions, like the men and trees of Annwfn, so integrally linked that their representation, and ultimately their very existence, conflate and become one? What I want to suggest is that two key elements of the famine diaspora (the timber trade and peasant immigration) are, indeed connected in a cycle of natural resource commodification. As such, they are not entirely unlike the triangle trade that linked Africa, North America, and European holdings. In the case of the Irish famine, however, the triangle ultimately folds in upon itself: rather than requiring three distinct commodities or exchanges, the Celtic timber cycle insists on the removal of such distinctions and, instead, begs a transformative perspective in which humans and forests are not longer distinguished from one another. To understand how this process reached its apex in the nineteenth century, it is helpful to begin with some background. Four centuries before the composition of "Cad Goddeu," the value of converted trees had already become a salient issue for Celtic culture. Indeed, significant woodland clearing in Ireland and Scotland dates back to the second century A.D., when Celts on both islands began stripping areas of land in order to establish semi-permanent communities. Not surprisingly, "high concentrations of [early] 120</page><page sequence="4">KATHRYN MILES nucleated settlement corresponded closely" to these cleared areas.3 Those people not a part of such settlements, scratch farmers, transients, select highland clans, and the like, were encouraged to make their home in what were deemed the "waste" areas of the remaining forest. In one of the first of multiple conflations, marginalized people became associated with the marginal landscape of the forest. The value of either was negligible. But by the thirteenth century, the remaining woodlands had become sparse enough that they shifted in classification and earned the distinction of "valued asset" status: because there was so little of this landscape left, what remained had increased in its perceived merits.4 Estates began claiming the landscape, and landed gentry often used the woods to graze their pigs, as a playground for hunting expeditions, and as a cache of potential building material. Eventually, the aristocracy came to view the woods as a pure commodity, that one could invest in over time and which would ultimately provide liquidity.5 By 1400, perceptions regarding woodland property had completely shifted and the formal classification of "waste" area had all but disappeared. The problem, however, was that its inhabitants hadn't. The conflation of peasants and forests no longer worked: the value of the latter required the displacement of the former, lest they affect potential value. This resulted in repeated attempts to relocate marginalized individuals to the highlands and other lower-value locations. These attempts, however, failed to solve the more serious problems of early forestry: timber, a so-called liquid asset, wasn't liquid at all. Not only was it tied up by tenants and squatters who still lived there, but the woodlands also required constant attention if they were to prove profitable. Landlords - and their tenants - would have to enact a formal forestry plan whereby laborious techniques such as coppicing and pollarding extended the value of the few 3 Britnell, R. H., The Commercialisation of English Society, 1000-1500 (Manchester: Manchester UP, 1997), 22. 4 Britnell, 28. 5 Those in the aristocracy who conserved their forests saw their assets increase, and fiscally irresponsible nobility regularly pulled from their woodlots when they found that they lacked sufficient liquidity. 121</page><page sequence="5">COLONIZATION CIRCULARS remaining trees.6 Such techniques were both laborious and time- intensive, and forestry plans could take decades to reach fruition. As a result, the immediate value of the remaining forest took quite some time to materialize. Given these conditions, economist Joel Mokyr has suggested that we consider this industry a "slow growth system" - insofar as the overhead and labor values required a long- term investment in order to see profit.7 While far from perfect, this forestry system worked for quite some time. But with the introduction of capitalism, slow growth lost its effectiveness.8 In Ireland, this occurred with the Act of Union in 1800. The act not only aligned all of the United Kingdom politically, but it also mandated a commitment to new systems of managing both the economy and natural resources, as the two were increasingly seen as incompatible. As a result, landowners were now forced to "give priority to ecological or economic outcomes."9 We see this forced choice in land management decisions relating to the corn laws and the British legislation regarding imports of cattle and other agricultural products. And, as many historians have already noted, these ecological outcomes were exacerbated by the appearance of the potato blight, which allowed Britain to restructure the Irish economy even further, largely through tariff management.10 6Britnell,411. 7 Mokyr, Joel, Why Ireland Starved (New York: Routledge, 2006), 74. According to Lourdes Beneria, slow-growth systems were no longer viable because of changes to social hierarchy. The introduction of capitalism led to "the hegemony of an economic system that determines social organization. In other words, the economic has primacy over the social." Economies became individualized and connected, which required immediate and liquid assets. As a result, slow growth systems no longer worked. {Global Tensions: Challenges and Opportunities in the World Economy [New York: Routledge, 20031,1 16.) 9Beneria, 127. 10 As socio-economist Joel Mokyr explains, the existing economic system did not support this model. Rather, he explains, land-use patterns in the modern age involved not "two agents (landlords and tenants), but three factors of production (land, labor, and capital)" (82). Capital was, he 122</page><page sequence="6">KATHRYN MILES Thus, the already perennial land question became a bigger one - and one demanding a decisive answer. For Lord Grey, a Whig Members of Parliament (MP), that answer was one of condemnation. Ireland, he said in a speech before parliament, had become a disease onto itself. It was "a blight on the brightness of British honour." So much so, in fact, that he concluded, "Ireland is the one weak place in the solid fabric of British power."11 Grey's fellow MPs disagreed - at least on one point. There was another weak thread in the British fabric, at least insofar as the ecological economy was concerned: the colonial timber trade in North America. The Napoleonic wars that had devastated grain prices had a similar effect on the timber trade. Naval skirmishes throughout the early part of the nineteenth century meant that the Baltic countries, Britain's preferred source for timber - could no longer ensure that the rising timber needs of the empire would be met. So England cast its eyes across the Atlantic: there, its largest colony sat on a seemingly endless hinterland of pine and hardwood, capital that could sustain even the most ambitious colony. Depending upon British North America's prodigious woodlands made good sense in theory: supply more than outstripped demand; good political relations between colony and colonizer were ensured; and the climate of Canada made harvesting and transporting wood relatively easy. Perhaps more importantly, buying wood from the colony represented an opportunity for a closed economic loop in which resources and revenue remained within the empire. The reality of the Canadian timber trade, however, proved more of a challenge. English transplants had already established small logging companies evocative of earlier Scottish timber firms.12 But although British North America had been trading with and supplying England for quite some time, the colony's timber business lacked the infrastructure needed to meet England's demands. Furthermore, explains, thoroughly " 'embodied' in the soil" (82). Similar problems occurred when landlords made a more decisive shift towards agriculture. 11 Quoted, in Kinealy, Christine, A Death-Dealing Famine: The Great Hunger in Ireland (London: Pluto Press, 1997), 35. 12 Lower, Arthur, Great Britain's Woodyard (Montreal: McGill-Queens University Press, 1973), 144. 123</page><page sequence="7">COLONIZATION CIRCULARS shipping anything from the colony was expensive, time-consuming, and outright risky for much of the year. England could do little to calm the high seas of the North Atlantic or speed up the square- sailed barques and shipentines(four-masted ships) so common at the time; however, it could boost the industry by providing human capital and economic support. To that end, Parliament first instituted a series of differential duties designed to make its North American supplies competitive in the European marketplace. In 1821, the height of the enforced taxation, timber from Baltic countries was taxed at a rate of approximately 55 shillings per ton, while colonial timber was assessed a tax of only 10s. By 1848, the British government sought to phase out all tariffs; however, the inequity between the two timber producers was no less stark (Baltic timber was taxed at rate of 15s; colonial timber at Is.). These tariffs sought to charge the Baltics for the shortcomings of Canadian timber. Not only did this program succeed, but it ultimately created what Arthur Lower has deemed a monopoly on the trade.13 That's precisely what many in the British government didn't want. Having embraced free market philosophies, they saw its excessive tariffs as antithetical to its new economy. Furthermore, these taxes were proving exceedingly expensive. Subsidizing colonial timber and simultaneously taxing Baltic supplies cost England hundreds of thousands of pounds sterling a year. The Baltics were not dropping their prices - as was hoped - to remain competitive. To make matters worse, England had failed in its attempts to complete the economic loop. Little export was reaching British North America, thereby leaving the hypotenuse of this new triangle trade devoid of commercial participation.14 Without a robust export program to Canada, ships would return empty. Furthermore, shipping companies would have to expend resources filling these ships with rocks and sand to provide the ballast needed to cross the 13 Lower, 67. 14 In 1833, Britain exported just over £7,000,000 to the Baltics and £2,000,000 to North America. In 1843, the discrepancy was more pronounced: Britain shipped approximately £1 1,000,000 worth of goods to the Baltics and just under £2,000,000 to North America. 124</page><page sequence="8">KATHRYN MILES North Atlantic, only to spend more time and resources dumping this load in the harbors of Quebec. Not surprisingly, England's response to this state of affairs was to relax its support of colonial wood. In 1846, Sir Robert Peel announced his plan to dismantle timber subsidizes. He wrote: I am about to affect domestic interests by the relaxation of protective duties: and we have a perfect right, if they be protected, to affect colonial interests. Timber is a very difficult question. I am most anxious to insure the consumer the benefits of the whole change."15 The colonies, it would now seem, would have to go it alone in the competitive market. This decision should have ended the North American timber trade altogether; nevertheless, the opposite soon proved true. The reason by and large was the advent of the famine, which created a true confluence between logging and immigration. The hundreds of thousands of starving Irish sent to North America, both by landlords and assistance from the government, seemed the solution both to the empty ships and the need for cheap labor in the Ottawa timber valley. In this regard, they also offered Britain a new kind of preferential subsidy: the inclusion of human capital. Leading the charge in this initiative was MP William O'Brien, who made a series of speeches before Parliament on the matter. In one such speech, dated 2 June 1840, O'Brien insisted: . . .whether we consult the impulses of humanity or the dictates of self-interest, we cannot better occupy our time than in considering whether colonization does not afford us the means of succoring the distressed, and giving bread to the hungry, by an 15 Quoted in Lower. 89. 125</page><page sequence="9">COLONIZATION CIRCULARS application of the natural resources which promises to ourselves a constantly accumulating return."16 This tripartite account of colonial interest and its eternal return would become something of a refrain for O'Brien, although he would sophisticate it somewhat by the time his speech went to print, at which time his version of the triangulation became ships, colonies, and commerce. The language of his scheme maintained its original commitment to natural resource management as he advocated "planting colonies" in order to "bring back, from every quarter of the globe, the productions which belong to each peculiar clime."17 Such a process required new thinking about forested landscape and colonial resources. It also allowed MPs to reconsider the famine debate. As far as O'Brien was concerned, they were already nicely linked. Indeed, he opined: I find that, at the same moment that our industrious fellow countrymen are starving, at home, from inability to procure employment, a universal complaint pervades our colonies that the bounty of nature is rendered unavailing, from the want of hands to gather the gifts which she there so lavishly bestows.18 The answer to this so-called universal complaint? According to O'Brien, it was simple: render immigrants as timber ship cargo and get them to the colony. This plan made good sense to the authorities involved. In Ireland, overburdened natural resources - from landlord fields to communal goods such as acorns, seaweed, and nettles - would be once again freed. In British North America, the supposedly wasting resources would be actualized. It was, some have argued, a moral obligation to support timber and immigration simultaneously. As Arthur Lower observes: 16 O'Brien, William Smith (MP), Emigration. A Speech on Moving Resolutions relative to Emigration in the House of Commons on Tuesday, 2 June, 1840. (London: Proprietors of the Mirror of Parliament, 1840), 1. 17 O'Brien, 1. 18 O'Brien, 6. 126</page><page sequence="10">KATHRYN MILES Pamphleteers rang the changes on the good old motto of 'Ships, Colonies, and Commerce'; and proved beyond contradiction that if you did not buy your timber from the British North American colonies, you thereby cut off all facilities for emigration to those colonies, you robbed the British shipowner, and, worst of all, you deprived the nation (in an oft-repeated phrase) of its chief 'nursery for seamen'.19 Even Canadian officials seemed supportive of this association. As early as 1834, the governor-general of Canada assured Britain that it could support at least 100,000 emigrants per year by placing them in the forests of Upper Canada, where they could fell timber.20 But the British Parliament was nevertheless initially cautious. Popular perception held that descendents of the original Celts maintained the insufficient morals of their pagan ancestors. What would happen if such individuals were let loose in the wilds of virgin forest? Calls were sent out to British officials in the colonies. Did those immigrants who had already arrived have the moral fiber needed to weather the vice-ridden world of the timber camps and become productive farmers and tradesmen? Yes, came back word, they had served the crown with aplomb.21 That was all the Britain needed to hear. The triangulation was attempted, and timber holds were outfitted with rough bunks to accommodate their new cargo. But the plan did not prove immediately successful, and only a fraction of those eligible agreed to sail. Ships remained empty on their return trips to North America, and the potential timber crisis continued to loam. The reason for this initial failure, says Gerald Moran, rested in the peasants' 19 Lower, 62. Moran, Gerald, Sending Out Ireland's Poor (Portland, OR: Four Courts Press, 2004), 33.

For assisted emigration to be effective, it was important that the emigrant knew what awaited him in North America.22 What the immigration commission needed was a public relations campaign of its own - something to dispel rumors, entice interest, and override the notes home written by immigrants who had successfully established themselves not in Canada, but in the U.S. And so began a project of pamphleteering. Known as "Colonization Circulars," these thin brochures, measuring approximately seven by five inches, were an attempt to both inform and influence potential immigrants. Dozens were published under titles such as Emigration: Practical Advice to Emigrants on All Points Connected with their Comfort and Economy, and Information Published By His Majesty 's Commissioners for Emigration, Respecting the British Colonies in North America?2' The pamphlets offered a variety of approaches to enticing the potential colonial settler. One such pamphlet promised an entertaining and recreation-driven passage to North America: Should the wind be lulled, you will perhaps be catching your own cod-fish, and observing occasionally the slimy track or the spouting of a whale. In fact, once the sickness is over, there is much to break the ennui and apparent sameness of the situation: - the rising and setting sun; the brilliancy of night; falling stars; the sporting of 22 Moran, 63. 23 For the first item see the following quotation.

Still, it succeeded in painting an appealing image of the Atlantic crossing. Other circulars, while less romantic, nevertheless provided information regarding the price of grain, time tables for trains, and an overview of local customs, all intended to woo Irish and Scottish tenement farmers to North America. These circulars all shared an emphasis on what the immigrants ought to do once they arrived: fell more timber. Anyone thinking himself a potential homesteader was reminded, "he must, with his axe, which will cost him 7s6d on the spot, cut into the forest with all his might and main."25 Another one reminded immigrants of their patriotic duty in razing forests: "emigration is of considerable advantage to the mother country, and we most cordially approve of the motto from Napoleon, prefixed to the 'Backwoodsman,' viz. 'Ships, Colonies, and Commerce'."26 All of the immigrants, of course, were reminded that under no circumstances should they consider leaving the woods of British North America and pushing southward into the United States. Not everyone approved of this plan. Some MPs continued to the think the landscape of colonial North America too pernicious. Others worried that the pamphlets, along with ships' advertisements such as the Jeanie Johnston's, would attract only the most literate and best-educated of potential emigrants - the very people they were 24 Emigration: Practical Advice to Emigrants on All Points Connected with their Comfort and Economy.

And there were additional problems as well. Fewer than 14 percent of these immigrants identified themselves as farmers; less than two percent considered themselves woodsmen.28 Most had no knowledge of how to work a woodlot. Many had never before even seen a forest. But, like the Québécois, Irish immigrants landing in British North America found decisions had already been made about their livelihood. Neither the French Canadians nor the Irish were thought fit for many employments outside of the timber industry. And so, qualified or not, they found themselves deep in the Ottawa River Valley, or supporting the industry in Quebec City, either loading ships with square deals of wood or carving out employment in wooden ship building. The association between forest and famine immigrant had stuck. And, in 1847, both immigration and timber exports to England reached their zenith: that year alone, approximately 1.3 million metric tons of North American forest and 98,000 famine refugees travelled across the Atlantic in the belly of timber ships, reached the shores. Meanwhile, the dramatic influx of immigrants caused an overconsumption of both farmland and timber in the Ottawa River Valley - a state of affairs not so unlike what had happened 400 years prior in Ireland and Scotland. As logging pushed further and further north, the price in human capital of Canadian timber grew. It became more labor intensive to move felled trees from the deep forest to the nearest river, and every additional mile of required river navigation offered new dangers both to the quality of the logs and the drivers navigating the churning waters. By 1850, the bottom was 29 dropping out of the colonial timber trade. Many Irish immigrants, unable to secure jobs outside the timber industry, did exactly what some British officials feared: they left Canada for Maine, Minnesota, and other places in the United States where unfelled forest remained. 27 This state of affairs led One Poor Law Commissioner to opine, "the best and most enterprising people are hasting away to cultivate the American wilderness" (quoted, in Mokyr 244). 28 Mokyr, 248. 29 Lower, 120. 130</page><page sequence="14">KATHRYN MILES What we end up with, then, is not so much a triangle - or even a full circle - but something more akin, perhaps, to Yeats' famous gyre, cycling into and from itself in what Neil Mann rightly calls a perpetual pattern of resource and circumstance.30 The transformation of forest into men first depicted in "Cad Goddeu" overlays itself generation after generation: first in the highlands of Scotland, then throughout Ireland, and finally in British North America and even in the twentieth-century United States. It is an elision we continue to encounter throughout Quebec and New England today, where questions of forestry and human participation continue to create headlines. The stakes and participation in the debate are growing. What once concerned one Welsh king and his people is now a global crisis and a new form of economic colonialism. If we are to learn nothing else from the collective sum of these timber cycles, it is surely that there is no one land question, or immigrant question, or notion of sustainable trade, but rather a transnational conundrum of resource use and the social construction of market forces. 30 Mann, Neil.
