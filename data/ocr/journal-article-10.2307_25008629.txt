Do they Feds never learn, man? They always have their walkie-talkies turned up to squawk assistance, yet they're never done yap-yapping between themselves; specially these backland Feds: cannot shut their cake holes for a moment: never so much as thirty seconds' radio silence; you can hear that distinctive static voice buzzle furlongs away. Once on his feet in the cellar, stood in cool shadow, the Nephew only had to wait and Fed might climb in that busted scullery window. When he heard glass tinkle into the sink, the whisper, "Up, Stalker; hup, boy," it was enough. Enter your own property and that's them sent the dogs in on you! he thought. He shouldered his backpack, plonked bar stool under, opened the coal hatch to a collapse downward of painfully bright light, and hunclded himself up. Outside he scoped both ways, let coal cellar door close quiet, then he hit out in a disembarkation hunch for a first line of tree cover, as if off a barely touched-down chopper. Even when well and truly along the slope lines shielding him, there was no sign of mutt nor master. The Fed would be inside the rooms, yielding to the novelty of his radio transmitter, reporting a clean sweep. The Nephew 7</page><page sequence="3">hoped the Fed went straight down the cellar hatch and broke his neck, and the Nephew threw himself to his stomach, crawled last fifteen feet over stony ridges of moorland. Sure as fate: a sleek, souped-up Fed Mondeo was parked on their old caravan pitch at the passing place they were always lecturing his old Dear it was illegal to park in; a gash sunlight off its windscreen; the Nephew turned his head both ways to take in the cathedrals of blue above; it was going into being a real scorcher of a day. Sure enough, the Nephew had seen the signs: cuckoos singing at dawn, swans flying north, and in the rivers the eels turning up their silver or golden undersides or the minnows and perch leaping and the frog's skin, normally blacker among the rotted grass, had been blushing up into mustard and green. There was no soul around but he waited ajiff, just in case a second Fed was away in trees for a slash or pulling off the gander's head, fantasizing about Juliet Bravo handcuffed to a bed, but that car was unoccupied. Even spotted now, the Nephew knew he could outrun any dog upslope, toward rail embankment, and scramble the drainage tunnel. Do the dog there, in the ... confines. Do it clean with the hunting knife. Drag its gutted sack for trains to sweep away. The Nephew glanced back toward Man Who Walks' house; sashayed to that police car, reached out and opened driver's door as his hair went static. He looked: ersatz leather, if no the real thing, and all state-the-art electronics, radar guns, no-expense-spared-taxpayers equipment. Not that the Nephew paid tax; no need to let your imagination completely run riot! But just then he saw a most amazing outrage: top the dashlboard a sort of miniaturized video monitor was relaying the moving picture sequence right there an then-inside-swerving infrared down through Man Who Walks' papier mache tunnels, right there on that wee screen, view scoping left, then right, the Nephew saw massive mitt of a human hand flutter near and he realized: it was a camera strapped to a collar atop that stupid dog's head, like as used in bomb or terrorist situations! Made him seethe, such equipment in this territory, like the time, just when the pub's come out, the hydro went down with a power cut, no juice was going to them new CCTV cameras in main street: those Dose brothers put in every shop window and looted just for sheer spite, brassieres clipped round their oilskins! There was a dirty sheet of hardboard where the tar macadam turns to moss and ancient moor begins, so he scoped round. Over by thistle clusters was an example. Using the hardboard he cooried in and slid it on: 8 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="4">semi-fresh cow shit, usual glittering array of summer flies and vermilion tinted bluebottles tense with activity on its crusted top, holed by beetles. Insects scattered with the under-easing of the board. As judged, like a slobbery French omelette, lower portions were green runnings. Looking over his shoulder the Nephew returned to that open police car door, checked the giveaway monitor, then let cow shit smear from the board and plomp heavy onto the driver's leather seat. Smeared it round a bit, allowing some cakelets to fall onto a fitted-carpet floor in by brakes and accelerators. The Nephew tossed that board, wound down yon window to get some flies in and, knowing sound will carry a mile here in the morning foothills, softly clicked closed police car's door. Reglancing at that monitor (the Fed dog was climbing stairs) off the Nephew swerved, uphill following moor grass doups and swells, case he'd to hit deck, but the Nephew was way in those birch leaves before there was sight of any soul. Whole scents of this earth was rised up out of it into the Nephew's face, the sun blanching these grasslands. Splashed round his eyes; on the springy moss by a wee stream, rinsed his mouth, lips close to the rock, and spat out, but there was no time for dilly-dally. He'd put down far too many roots already this side of a loch that it was time to get over ... across. Course he daren't use the old cantilever and away north, not now. Be a sitting duck on its five-hundred-yard dash with no escape but bailing out over that side: hundred-foot drop to rapids below. He shivered. He crossed the embankment without a glance up the deer cutting and tumbled down through beehives where he'd beaten upon his old friend Hacker those years ago, then fell into thistle ranks behind guest houses, rehopped back of the tin-roofed holiday home and hesitated by a rowan in the garden to get a clear crossing over the road and hither anon he was back down on the bright shoreline, squinted against silvers, grays, and blacks and the top slicks of current on the moving loch mass, coiling and turning like severed worms; he was headed for Hacker's boathouse through plague clouds of gnats until he was cooried among fecund verdure, pale undersides of bramble leaves swaying close to his cheek, so he turned aside, trying to jalouse how to cross a loch, when he spotted that outline he'd missed in the night's darknesses when it had been black as the earl of hell's waistcoat. There was a bulk in among wild thornbush just off the pale shore stones. The Nephew didn't want to come out onto open shore yet, so he just tossed a pebble at yonder bulk: looked like something long, plastic-seeming, THE MAN WHO WALKS 9</page><page sequence="5">wrapped in hessian. Stone missed, so he under-lobbed another, like a grenade, and it hit that wrapped thing which made a fiberglassy echo dunk. He crawled forward and tugged at that wrapping. Right enough, it was a long, faded orange canoe, wrapped in rotted sack and blue, sun-bleached fertilizer bags that'd been violently slashed open to increase size. The canoe'd been pulled in under thombush, right-way-up, but fertilizer bags had stopped it filling with rain. Though a dip where the opening was had a layer of rotted autumn leaves so's it'd lay there since winter past-at least. A paddle was slid inside. The Nephew stood, stooped and dragged that canoe backward, into deeper overgrowths, like ajust-shot corpse, he thought, and this movement stripped it of its coverings. The canoe was aswirl in graffiti, couple big quotes in spray paint, smaller quotations most wrote in those silver magic markers: And I turned myself to behold wisdom, and madness, and folly: for what can the man do that cometh after the king? Even that which hath been already done. He was no dafty nincompoop or dopey-docus. Ecclesiastes, only gump tion in Bibles, he thought, and he could mind whole sections himself because he still had that little pocket Bible that had once belonged to a very, very naughty young woman and it excited him to read it, especially the lines she had underlined in her untutored hand, knowing all the most lustful things that woman had done! There was Romans 8:22, Isaiah 54:3, and much of Ecclesiastes. I sought in my heart to give myself unto wine, yet acquainting my heart and to lay hold on folly. I got me servants and maidens, and had servants born in my house and whatsoever mine eyes desired I kept not from them. As it happeneth to the fool so it happeneth even to me: and why was I then more wise? And how dieth the wise man? as the fool. Questions, questions, but the Nephew licked his lips at this, for he had most niggling wee suspicion, was not this the entire story of Man Who Walks and his pursuits of him? Were he and the Foreman any better than the Man Who Walks, the fool? You can do the midnight rosary with as many servant girls as you want, but you will never know all the excessive pleasures of past kings and concubines, this is the lament of the sybarites, chasing dreams seeking ones as yet undreamt and, in the end, fool, imitator of the king, king himself we all will perish unremembered. Nothing new under the sun on account of all that has gone before, is one conclusion of these musings or, 10 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="6">as Sam Beckett, Nobel Prize for Literature I969, put it, "And for other reasons better not wasted on cunts like you." Whole bloody canoe was scrawled with these creepy Bible quotations, but the Nephew tried to put mere thoughts and fears of dark waters out there to one side. Such bright morning took dominion and he made himself ready for crossing. He sat to tug off his combat trousers over boots in case they got all mankyized in that canoe bottom, stood, slipped the mobile in his lumberjack shirt pocket, and dropped down his jacket. He opened his backpack to check his hunting knife and that's when he saw yon bin-liner he'd crammed in as a pillow the night before, still there and all forgot about. He yanked it out. Opened the bin-liner and he thought it was reams and reams of cine-film, a i6 mm ribbon of dreams that was coming out. Whole thing stuffed with it, but then he saw it was actual typewriter ribbon, miles and miles of the stuff; maybe a report one those boffins was writing up on the Man Who Walks, so he crammed it all back in, but he couldn't fit combats and jacket too, so he spraffed them up back of that pointy-ended canoe. He took the paddle square in two hands and practiced a wee bit, stood there in his shirt and bockers and, guessing there was nothing for it, shoul dered on the backpack and pulled the canoe down to water's edge. He'd never been long enough at the high school tove done this carry-on, the old canoe rolls with helmet banging off bottom of a pee-filled shallow end, but he'd watched the mugs do it one winter's day through the steamed up outside window of the new swimming pool in his truancy phase. Phases. There was a lot of creepy popper seaweed close inshore, so it was going to be awkward to gain deep water. None for it but to push the canoe ahead, splash out, bow pointed to opposite shores. Not far at all, he kept thinking; then, using the paddle on rocks under water, he managed to lift sodden boots an snug hisself in, arse soaked right away on the canoe bottom that he thought he'd need to be laving out so much muckwater. He leaned over to one side, took up his paddle and, lo and behold, he was sat steady in a canoe on fearful loch water, squinting at the fast-moving currents ahead, seeing it was rushed west, at a fair old rate of knots, but preferable to being taken upstream to rapids under that old cantilever! If he did coup, he'd be carried outward, but the long, slung sandbar by the old seaplane base would be something he could kick in for. There was nae choice; he set forth. THE MAN WHO WALKS 11</page><page sequence="7">The Nephew began to paddle and his canoe moved over the loch surface surprisingly quick, out past seaweed slops in the shallows and in and among those currents. He'd imagined force of the black water frothing against sides of the biblical canoe but, by angling the paddle blades down, he could easy counter its sweep and he turned his head round, seeing how far he'd already come in the orange canoe. In a crazy flush of confidence he even considered rounding the sand bar and paddling up to the beach over the clear water and across the wreck of the Breda herself, for landfall, walking down to the old station and cutting off Man Who Walks there and then, maybe carry this bloody canoe, balanced on his head! Steady now, old mate, the Nephew thought. He was well out on that firth, seeing the village off to his right from a new angle over the straits. He couldn't have been far off halfways across -sun all way above. Ahead, the peninsula mountains with the superquarry buried deep in them like a skelf; behind, Ben More, clear as a huge, mad projection on the wall of horizon. So eerily quiet out there, deep under him silence, then a peeping bird hugging the glassy surface made past, saw it dip a wing to miss, pass behind . . . the stern. Far across the perfect polished floor of water, against his squint he could see the wee ferry Flora MacDonald, a thirty-footer with a putt-putting Evinrude: full-house, it was towing an unpowered rowing boat heavy with anorak-clad touristos rocking in its lively wake. The Nephew sang: Michael, row the boat ashore Hallelujah, The river's deep and wide Hallelujah There's milk and honey on the other side Halle-oo-oo-jah. What he thought was a lobster creel buoy was a sky-pointed seal's nose, its fiber-optic whiskers showing water drops he was so close. Maybe he could come to love the sea, one those late conversions in life he'd often read about! The seal sunk for cover as the mobile phone shri]ly rang "Rule Britannia" in his breast pocket. Damn and blast! He parried the paddle across, hanging on with the right hand, and picked out that phone with the left; the canoe began to drift to bad places as he thumbed up the button. 12 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="8">"Caught me at a poor time here. Delicate ops." "Are ya with a whoor, boy?" "A gray seal, phone you back." "AH YAH!" The Nephew yanked the phone away from his ear. There was the most intense, jabbing pain on his left leg, then another, so he fiercelyjerked, kicked up splashes at the canoe side, thought himself having a heart attack. "oh fiddlesticks," he grimaced. "Ouch, oh, OUCH!" A little voice in his hand trembled, calling, "Whaass matter, laddie ... 2?" He tried drop-pocketing yon mobile in his shirt but another sting on his bare leg! Phone missed, bounced once on fiberglass and slithered down the canoe flank with a neat plop into that sea, extinguishing all the Foreman's protests, for the moment at least. He had to try to stand and get away from those pains and, as he lifted his torso clear of the canoe, he saw his bare thighs and lower legs were crawling with clung masses of yellow-jacketed wasps! The canoe wobbled down to the left, in a sinking sway as if the top could be breached by the suddenly clear loch water. The Nephew yelled aloud and tried to balance other way as more wasps came fury-buzzing upward from the opened hole in the canoe body. He swiped out at his thigh, got stung on the hand, and dropped the paddle. Down in the canoe bottom with a little muddy water he could see a bust-open half of a whole wasp's nest shoogling from one side to another as he balanced; nest must have been built in there all summer, yacuntya, he thought, looked round, wide-eyed, middle of fucking black lochs under faultless skies. Choice was clear: drown or stung to death-got a last piercing just below his balls and chose: the Nephew leaned, went over with his feet still in that biblical canoe. Underwater the Nephew kept eyes tight shut, not wanting to see savage serrations and wicked aretes of a sunken mountain range below, the Foreman's phone bubbling his voice, sinking past scallop meadows and cliff edge lobster villages, the headless seal's body at surface above. What he felt then, his eyes shut against the salt, believing this was his end, was not fear to be in his worst of feasible scenarios; not fear but huge sense of solidarity with the historical drowned, like that foster-daughter, and a deep spurt of detestation and violence for that animal fool Man Who Walks, his blood Uncle who he clearly hadn't tortured nearly enough. His face slid out on an oily surface among patches of floated drowned THE MAN WHO WALKS 13</page><page sequence="9">wasps on their backs, wasps' little legs like girl eyelashes held to yonder sky. He spat and spun cause already that capsized canoe had drifted over him and away. What was keeping him floated was his backpack, strapped to his shoulders, so he spun it off cause the buoyancy was forcing his face forward. He could see it was air trapped inside the bin-liner of typewriter ribbon was all that was keeping him up, so, holding it out in front of him with both arms, he began to kick and mush furiously toward that sand bar. In moments he realized he was actually going to make it to the shore, the current not nearly carrying him as violently as he feared, but his feet were deep cold within his boots and he was fearful of any rock crops with their kelpy sheetings, but, unspectacularly, he came to first levels of seaweed float; found he was already in his own depth. Drooked, the Nephew had to declare he stuttered through the waves and limped out the loch that morning, onto stone and shattered construction debris of the northern shores, only in boots, clinging shirt and underwear, he shivered and emptied water out his backpack looking for a quiet spot to sneak up onto the trusty old A828 and north. Numbing cold and salt must act antiseptic, because as soon as he left the waters his legs started to sting away like nobody's business as if he'd eased under his skin with a razor and lifted a strip up, the way Jennifer Faulkner says it felt when he coaxed her to carve his name in her arm. So he just lay among whins down by the road, listening to their seed pods pop in the direct sunlight and the little trickling sound of their thrown spores falling through adjacent bushes. He was getting his puffback, grinning at leg pain, then chuckling, hearing vehicles whizzing past, north. He squeezed the shirt best he could and pink water from its cheap dye came out. His legs were killing with stungness. What he needed wasnt just a pair of breeks, he thought, but some blonde bint in suit and Porsche to take him north for a kiss per kilometer. Or better still, a safe house or bolt-hole himself. Stood with boxer shorts tugged that bit lower below the long shirt, and his big boots, he'd might just pass for some ridiculous Australian backpacker with normal shorts and here he began to think, in his moment of weakness (as, he must confess, he had done after imagining the Hole's anointed fingers, fixing the toilet seat), of Paulette Mahon, who lived a few mile up the road at Boomtown and who might, if he played his cards right, provide a safe house for recovery, and trousers! So the Nephew lay there, near stung to death and half drowned, shirt 14 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="10">spread out on whin-bush spikes, head on the squelchy bag of typewriter ribbon, thought of his young twenties, snout-faced Paulette's lispy vocabulary from a tongue-piercing she once swallowed. Paulette, with a burgundy and aqua tattoo of a weeping willow's downshower at the very bottom of her spine and those legs! She was using a tin of his shaving foam a week during his residency! Only let him bide two weeks, then posted him forward a package of oily socks: "You forgot your socks," wrote in a surprisingly precise hand! Paulette spent so long in bed, her nail varnish matched her pajamas. Paulette, mostly languid in a long, drained bath, always tuned to Aluminumville FM, playing "Riders on the Storm," "His brain is squirming like a toad," her rendered half-decent through the always-open bathroom door, archipelagoes of clung bubble bath on the strategic points all along her somehow tannedness, devouring cannabis resin through a pipe made from a Coca-Cola can. In the mornings, he had the brief privilege to learn, she only ever seemed to have one dream, about a chocolate malt ball being lodged in her belly button. First thing Paulette ever said to the Nephew, at a crowded wedding table that he'd gatecrashed, was, "Women stand stiller than men in the Ladies toilets, doing their make-up in the mirror," she said, "you become so still that the movement-sensitive monitor puts the light out on you and you smudge your makeup; it thinks there's nobody in there. Gives me the maximum creeps, makes me feel I dont exist," she shivered. "You know, I very much identify with your experience of existential dread there. I've felt a very similar feeling, I believe, when I've noticed, late at night, the low swaying bow of a tree setting off a movement-sensitive lamp outside a property." Ah, the poetry of love! In those days Paulette's only nourishment ever seeming: sperm, Asti Spumante and forever nibbling on a snap-brittle stalk of unboiled spaghetti. Her famous flight to London on modeling trial for a swimsuit catalogue and picked up by some rich man on the train, her shouting from a pulled-down Hackney taxi window at King's Cross to first London prostitute she'd ever seen, "I love your shoes, they're beautiful, where'd you get em?" After a week or so you imagine the rich boy realized he could not handle Paulette in her wildly scandalous girlhood, but when she came back here she'd a bobby dazzler wardrobe of silk she was forever having dry-cleaned, so these wee THE MAN WHO WALKS 15</page><page sequence="11">blue number labels were always attached to her cuffs with a tiny safety pin. The Nephew thought, oh Paulette! Sadness of wild spirits broke by their own excess which only kings should know. Now she's part-time at the Sea Life Center in a skin-tight wetsuit, kneeled in the Rock Pool Environment holding out starfish to wee kids, hitched to probably some ordinary boy who likes his football, but he'd definitely heard worked shifts offshore. Two wee daughters that look just like her, the Nephew'd heard, when he cautiously inquired round the pubs, and mortgaged to the hilt on the new scheme at Boomtown, just a few mile up the road. What if that hubby was two week offishore? But the Nephew couldn't turn up looking like this . . . had to get a pair of trousers, at any rate, before calling on Paulette, yacuntya!? He jumped to his feet and got that warmed, damp shirt over his shoul ders. He chose his thumbing pitch on the long straight so's he could identify Fed cars at some distance. A white taxi going south made him duck briefly. Forty-seven northbound vehicles, private, heavy goods, utility and public service, passed him, most markedly accelerating. He hardly bothered thumb ing latest reg, all company-car chancers. He could read no meanings from resultant registration plates, nothing at all; no combination of number plates communicated to him usual informations, nor did number plates spell out Man Who Walks or Paulette! That concatenation of letters and numerals seemed meaningless. When wee he used to demarcate all vehicles as either "isad-faced" or "happy" depending on the anthropomorphic design qualities of their headlights and radiator grilles, but now he couldn't decide if these modern, madly overpowered vehicles, clearly designed for other worlds than Argyllshire, had sad, happy, or even angry faces. Forty minutes later the Nephew came out of sun behind him, down into Boomtown from the megalithic burial grounds up above the old Folk's home, through that place below Forestry Commission conifers where he once saw a pinecone big as a full-size chocolate Easter egg, one of the ones that he never got. Bloodstained trousers not too noticeable, he stepped over a picket fence and walked up to Paulette's front door. Doorbell played the Close Encounters coda. Leaf-pattern glass swung open and an adorable little miniature Paulette looked directly at him cause he was at the bottom of the steps and she says, "Who the fuck're you?" 16 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="12">"Mummy or Daddy in?" "You're not social services, are ya?" "No. I'm an old pal of your Mummy's." "You mean an old boyfriend?" "Well, goodness me," the Nephew coughed. "Don't tell anyone," she whispered, "I'm home alone! You can wait out there, I'm babysitting ma silly wee sister; Dad's away offshore, Mum's just down the shop and I've never ever to let anyone in." "Quite correct," the Nephew nodded. She did her size equivalent of slamming the door, sort of running, heaving at it so's you thought she'd come through that glass. She clicked the Yale, the Nephew thought, with that foul, confident possessiveness of Settled Community kids round their secure little houses. He sat cross-legged, plucking daisies on that wee lawn; Mary Queen of Scots had her head chopped off. The lawn hadn't been cut for four or five days, so at least a week till hubby was home. He took out his Japanese address on that bloodstained piece of paper writ in a very, very shaky hand and put it safe in the shirt pocket. The wee daughters pulled over a chair to the front-room window: stared through dirty double-glazing and giggled toward him. He overheard a cheeky comment about his trousers being far too long. That doorbell! Yes, the movies were not the Nephew's chosen art form. He recalled, once and once only, the Man Who Walks took him to the cinema, in the Port's fleapit, and paid for his seat in the stalls; there were only stalls. It was meant to be a scary film but the Nephew was scared enough by the time he got to his seat. "I can't hear a fucking thing," the Man Who Walks roared, and the woman seated in front of them jumped and her perm shook. "No characters are talking yet," the Nephew whispered. The Nephew has never managed in picture houses though he's bought many tickets. The Nephew enters, anmed with valid ticket, chocolate-chip tub, or the incredible yellow mustard on his hotdog, but he can see nothing in the gloom. To crash his way to even the nearest seat would be an embarrassment. So he tries waiting for a brightly lit scene that may illuminate his way forward, but no, all the films are so moody these days. The Nephew waits in vain, lurking, sinister-seeming to the back-row dwellers and their furtive ways, so he retreats, pretends he's making for the bogs but instead he leaves the picture house altogether with his valid ticket, escapes the melancholy of some THE MAN WHO WALKS 17</page><page sequence="13">moronic screenwriter's denouement and feels newly invigorated to step out so soon, back into evening airs again, with his copy of Senecas Consolation to Helvia in his jacket pocket; he takes a shivering stance on the street, watching interlinked teenagers brace the thoroughfare in both directions, and lifts the ice cream to his lips, eyes missing nothing. Alive! When things don't go well for him, the Nephew turns his mind to what is written in wry Suetonius: vain Caesar staring at a bust of Alexander the Great, thinking, By the time he was the age I am now, he'd conquered the world. Or old Art Schopenhauer, his steady gaze being returned for hours by the orange orangutan in Dresden Zoo which the old cynic grew so fond of, toward the end. The Nephew stood abruptly when Paulette's head on its swans neck sailed along top of a hedge, like it'd been severed. He groaned at how she still looked and he thought: whatever so mine eyes desired I kept not from them. Neither smiled nor frowned when she saw the Nephew, but she put down the shopping and lifted a hankie to her nose. Front door came open and two daughters piled out screaming, running round Paulette's denim legs, way that wee dug Trafalgar had bothered me, he thought, till I flung the cunt by its back leg into a wheelie bin. Paulette looked him up and down, in his conglomerations of clothing, her snozzle was all red and chapped and in nasally voice she says, "Well, least I won't have to worry that I haven't done the vacuuming. Don't! ... come near me. Less you want a cold." "Well worth it!" he goes and pecked her on a cheek. Her daughters wolf whistled. He'd forgot eyes were that color; a few more lines at the side but that was from too much laughing for these lands. He tried to take the shop ping bags off of her, but she shrugged negative. He says, "What happened to the hotel?" "Long gone, stranger, like you." "Boating accident." He held out his arms, squeezed down on his feet: water fizzed and buzzed still, from top of his boot. "Chucked off a trawler for too much wanking?" she goes. "Nah, it's true, bit of canoeing." She laughed, took a hankie out her sleeve and blew a real grogger. "I traveled for years, recently I work at Agricultural Supplies, heaving pony nuts for well-to-dos basically." 18 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="14">"No get yur leg over they horsy women types among the alfalfa?" "Stick to the horses." "Poor horses. I work at the Sea Life Center these days." "I know. Saw you in the brochure, they had you everywhere, in the water, behind the till, in the cafeteria." "That's how it is." "Our Prince is in the heather once more," he shrugged. "Your mental Uncle's still doing the runners!" she sniffed. "Why don't you just let him alone?" The Nephew stopped at the front door, "He's a danger to himself I'm worried sick about his well-being." "Ever thought, it's you an yours' mentalness he's tried to get away from; you keep catching him like a stray dug and dragging him back?" She looked at the Nephew out corridors of shadows, one girl-child wrapped round a thigh. "Colin's away, come in if you want, mind your boots on the carpets." Colin, was it! The Nephew says, "Some cold you've got there." "Summer colds are aye worser and with these wee ones it's hard taking to your bed any more." She blew that cute snout again. Front room he goes, "Nae telly!?" "Against them. Bad influence on these two." "That a paper there?" "All you're going to get is the relentless goal machine that is Oban Camanachd," Paulette flicked out yon dreaded local paper (est. i86i) from the shopping bag. "Want a beer?" Plonked on the armchair of the three-piece suite, a cold Heineken was therefore delivered unto him but with unfortunancy those wee daughters brought an endless series of toys for the Nephew's inspection, Barbies, unfamiliar alien creatures, and a plastic baby that both vomited and pished itself "I had a cuddly elephant when I was wee called Markus," the Nephew tried. They were unmoved. Finally the tallest child dropped a living, all-too-ratlike gerbil from two cupped hands onto his groin area. "Johnstone," she introduced. "If we want peace, I suggest the washing machine room," Paulette jerked her head, so he shucked off the gerbil and followed her to the washing machine room that was more a cupboard with a Bendix inside, doing a demented cha-cha. With his lower lip pushed out in cursory interest he THE MAN WHO WALKS 19</page><page sequence="15">reread, for fourth... fifth time, front page of the newspaper: the customary photo of a minor member of the Royal Family who had strayed within one hundred miles.

Door pushed in at him and Paulette squeezed through, yelled above washing machine spin, "Awful car crash up the road, they was saying in the shop, must be bad, took the boy away in an ambulance just there." "Oh!?" he went, quick-slapping yon rag into a folded square and sliding it well in under the washing machine. He noticed these envelopes of silver foil beneath the machine's wheels, to stop it running away or whatever. Paulette sighed, "Agbhlh!" tiptoe reaching, her slimness perfectly intact, 20 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="16">to a shelf for the makings in a Golden Virginia tin, lid clipped into the base and green paint worn silver, then she did a long slide down, sat against the door bottom, legs along the Nephew's, feet really close by his thigh, his boot by hers, she got whole-hunkered forward, hair falling into her face with the jerks as those daughters shoved at other side of the door, shouting behind her like some proto-drug squad, but they soon wearied, way kids do these days with all food additives and video games in them, he thought. She went about blow ing her nose and asks, "Dinnae have any snot on my top lip, do I?" He shook his head, mesmerized by her. Paulette's experienced fingers were sprinlding an rolling up. He goes, "I know an old gypsy cure for the cold," but she ignored so's he goes, "What age is the biggest?" "Niamh," she went. "Neeve," he goes. "Know how it's spelled?" she says. "N-E-E-V-E," he goes. "Nut. N-J-A-M-H. It's Irish," she went. He didn't flinch, "What age is she?" he says. "Eight." He whistled, "Jeez, yonks since I saw you." She lit up, inhaled, held down, and passed to him. She blew smoke and goes, "I must say, I'm impressed, I was expecting you to be jamp out bushes every night for months, or Colin to show up with his legs broke." "He's fairly clipped your wild wings, hope this is all paid for," the Nephew sneered and toked deepest of deeps, nodded at the jiving washing machine. "Want me to straddle it?" she whispered, blew out smoke. "Bet your daughters do while you're down the shop," he finaRly says when he couldn't hold smoke in any longer. She pointed at him, "You will not stray within ten meters of my daughters without me being there." "Don't worry, Paulette, y'know fine they're too old for me. So how dye keep the old spark alive in married life then?" "Who says we're married and at least he can get it up." "Your memories no frazzled then." "Hard to forget worst sex of your life." "I've been researching." "Aye, on yersel." THE MAN WHO WALKS 21</page><page sequence="17">"For the day we two would meet again," he bowed, gesticulated. She laughed, a sort of sneezy sound, and grabbed the toke off him. He knew he shouldn't smoke dope. Could lead on to major relapse, buy ing cigarettes and voddy instead of beer, and once back on the spirits you're doomed, man. He'd get the urge for powders and Bob's your uncle! his wee castle would come tumbling down. He thought, Couldn't let myself go that way again. Last time on dope I minded looking at a goldfish bowl trying to decide if the water was behind the glass or surrounding it; I got drawn into a conversation regarding Carpaccio and the evolution of perspective in Venetian art, and I gave away too many juicy ideas of my own, yacuntya. Paulette was talkng, "The older one, Niamh, worries me. One night when she was younger I had a girlfriend over, who was at high school with me. We're both eating tea and my wee Niamh put her chin on the table and says, 'Mummy, there's a battery up my bottom.' Well, panic stations broke out and, sure enough, one of the double AAs you put in a Walkman, a Duracell, was shoved in and stuck up there. She coulda been lectrocuted." "She's got an illustrious future." "Shut your gob. So I sit her down." "She could still sit?" "And I says to her, 'Now you shouldn't be putting things up your bottom."' "Put it in Latin on the family coat of arms! Don't you want her to take after her mother though?" "'And if you really want to, you must come and ask Mummy first!"Oh,' she says, 'does that include food?' So I says, 'Food's meant to be up there, darling,' and she says, 'Even the frozen peas I get out of the fridge and stuff up?' And she'd been getting the froze peas and putting those up too!" "Ah, the joys of parenting, eh?" The Nephew just started talking, hearing his own voice, not caring that her children were already hopeless psychoana lytic cases, knowing if he looked in a mirror he could never focus on his own eyes. He says, "Paulette; hey, Paulette! Up Bealach an Righ, past Pennyfiir through Tulloch Ferry, choose east or north to you here, I'm no fussed; I went away from old Dairiada, to the army, to a country, to somewhere proper, these lands would play on me at nights, like the shadows on the ceiling. Travel? Travel is for students; don't want to travel, I want to arrive, be elsewhere, like old Ovid, concerned with objects that transform themselves." He took another hit of spliff. "Aye, Paulette; hey, Paulette! Have you ever 22 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="18">had a place where things have gone down big time for you, just a place that's going in all directions?" "You what?" "Far as your eye can see. Out and lonely among the waters. Ranged some where among rock and you've say spent a dod of time there or something happened to you and then you go back to this very place that should mean so much to you and it just, ach, disappoints or something?" Paulette drawled, with a smile on the sides of her mouth, "I see you still cannie handle a smoke. Whatre you on about? You're way too deep for me as per usual; all those dictionaries you swallowed burping up again." She was getting fixed to roll another and the fat whopper they worked on was not near done. "Nah, nah, this isn't book stuff it's real! I've been to New York, I've been to Rome, seen a milihon birds circle St. Peter's at dusk, the flocks go invisible until they wheel and flourish hike a swarm, opening their wings above the Eternal City, heading west. You come back here and the place seems thinned out, nowhere near as real as it was in your fizzed-up brainbox. Nostalgia. You start to notice tricks time has played. Trees are taller, there's a new something over there that wasn't in your mind's picture, or you'd excluded, foolishly, the way Napoleon warned his generals not to make pictures in their heads but to trust only what their eyes could perceive. Jeez, you get back to home-town you believe you have strong feelings about, to find maybe certain buildings are a whole story higher than you remembered but you kept those cherished memories so sacred! Memory is the mark of love. You find your vision, the product of your love, is grander than the reality. Memory is the mark of love, Paulette. To keep something in your mind and cherish it, what a miracle in this world." Paulette giggled at him, concentrating, rolleying away, smiling to herself: aroused by some briar she'da been tumbled over in long ago; dumbly superior as if he'd no done that stuffwith McCallum sisters, gone and given them some plein air memories too; aye aye, a wee nest egg of sweet memories for him also, to take with him when he goes down slow with the cancer or the angina or the pneumonia or the linguistic area of his brain blacked out in a spreading aneurysm's fireworks. He says, "Aye, hike time I had to fight Robert Sinclair when fourteen." "Here we go," she whispered. "Hardest guy around. Like some medieval joust, his gang had to meet my THE MAN WHO WALKS 23</page><page sequence="19">gang and it was in this place, way up on the pony-trek to Black Lochs. Fuck alone knows why we'd have chose to meet out there cause we was so knack ered by the time we's reached it, on a scorching heatwave day, lucky we could lift our arms, or at least it seemed that way ... seemed it was miles and miles to get there and I minded it as being this lush little plain meadow with all the ben sides seeming to dip down into real rich, long straps of fresh grass. A green basin surrounded by mountains curving away up to the turned-back summits and a full sky above black mounts. Now a few month ago I walked back up there, to find that meadow where I bested Sinclair; a stroll down memory lane sort of." "Aye, back to your glory days!" Her snigger turned into a mucus release and she darted her beautiful fingers up her cuff for yon hankie. She muttered, "Near as a dosser like you'd get to a battle field, since you gave away yur Action Man." "Listen, Minnehaha, course it wasn't miles at all; I was there in ajifly." Fabric hanging, white and green in front her red lips, there was a giggle. Nodding. "And it wasn't this grand amphitheater of my mind at all, with embank ments all soared away up on every side, it was just this totey wee cabbage patch, with some slopes over to wee, wee cliffs. See, it seemed so far cause I was all the way there psyching myself up. Hills seemed all round cause when me and Sinclair walk]ed toward each other, the whole world shut out, huge moun tains just flew away back with the bang of first punch. It enclosed us, cause there was no way you could escape that conflict, so I felt all mountains round us. Then when I'd triumphed, I recalled it as this, arcadia ... that's sort of paradise like. What I'm saying is, it's where our head is at that prints our impression of the landscape! I realized early on, growing up in grandeur like this that you and me are surrounded by each day, I sussed that cause I was lonely I preferred landscapes to people, then I was reading Bertie Camus, as you do, and I read in his Camets: 'In our youth we attach ourselves more readily to a landscape than a man. It is because landscapes allow themselves to be interpreted.' And of course they do, but differently depending on the state of your mind." "You were certainly nae good at attaching yourself to any woman." "The land is here, all round us, but each of us pulls from it or inserts into it what we want, we all see it different, like we could meet the ghosts of other folks' needs and dreams wandering the places at night." 24 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="20">"Watch you don't meet your own," Paulette curled her lip, a little uglily. "Exactly. I believe we live in a semi-spirit world. Sometimes the deceased just forget they're dead for a moment or two. Like I knew soldiers, eyewit nesses, who can't agree on where they all were on the field of battle cause you have all these highly excited individual viewpoints jostling with each other. No just Gulf or Faildands or Normandy. Some battles with hundreds of thousands of men, it's been impossible to find the battle site cause no one there could agree; only the burial pits grown over to show for real, like at Culloden. Some battle sites have gone missing, generals arguing it all happened over the next hill. Like the Romans in Scotland, the Ninth Legion marching north to relieve the Tay garrisons, they vanished and it's said at night you can still hear them marching. Aye, when you look at this earth we walk upon with adult eyes." Some of the conversations folk have in this life, eh? yacuntya. "Hoi, you've nodded off, ya blethering lightweight."y Right enough, his legs were stunged to billy-o, dope was crashing the Nephew out-aknacked; he goes and says, "Aye, look, gotta make a phone call, hardly slept last night." "oh aye!?" "Maybe I could have a quick wee nap of forty winks but you'd wake me later, aye?" "More like forty wanks with you." He tried to get to his feet but the pins were wobbling. "It's no the grass, he defended, "I can tak the pace, pal. Suppose I should have something to eat. When did I last eat?" "It's no grass," went Paulette. "Eh? What is it?!" "It's some New Drug. Look, I crush down the seeds under the washing machine, that's why I've aye got it on Spin. There's nothing in the wash." Right enough, the Nephew leaned down and glared seriously in: the washing machine was empty. The envelopes of tinfoil under the runners were grinding the drug up. His mouth went all dry. He didnt want to tamper with things he didn't understand. He followed Paulette out the washing machine room, along a corridor of echoes to bottom of the stair. She was carrying his black backpack that THE MAN WHO WALKS 25</page><page sequence="21">he'd forgot existed, he noticed white, semenish stains on it, then salvaged a memory, Dried salt water, he thought. She had another New Drug joint in her other fingers. "Conducted tour. Girls' rooms, out of bounds." He nodded, not paying attention, to his later detriment, goes, "Aye aye," he'd realized how hungry he was. She pointed up the stair so's he led the way, disappointed, sumley supposed she thought she'd grab him if he fell, but he'd been looking forward to watching as her tight behind went up. He ascended. Top of the stairs she swung a door to a single bed in a wee room and tossed his backpack in on the duvet. Wallpaper was all bright colors; place looked like it was never used. "Luxury," he goes, and she kissed him, aside the cheek. "Give us a call in a hour or so, I've got to make an urgent phone call. Business." "Okey-dokey," she sniggered. "It's sort of good to see you, ya lightweight," she pulled the door tight. He smiled in the true joy that only a woman can give and got the Buddhist snowboarder's breeks off, then sat on the side of the bed, fascinat ingly poked at the wasp stings on his thighs that'd come up as hard little lumps. Off with the damp shirt and keks and he wormed under yon bright blue duvet, shivered at coldness, his toes came against something so he reached down. Pulled up a cold, rubbery hot-water bottle from the last guest. He let it slide with a collapsing blurble down on a bedside rug. Then the visions began. * Brand-new reg car stopped, raged into reverse. Above the reg the enameled number plate read: WARP SPEED MR ZULU. The Nephew picked up his back pack. The Nephew didn't know if it was polite to let him lean over and open the passenger door or do it yourself, but the driver leaned and shoved it open. "Are fifteen possums going to appear from the trees?" "Sorry." "Australian?" "Nut." "Are you jogging or do you just have no trousers on?" 26 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="22">The Nephew leaned down to smile and the driver looked disappointed, as if he was about to drive on, so the Nephew clambered in and water poured out his backpack swinging over the gear stick. "I had the old canoe accident this morning," he says. "oh, white-watering, I see." Disinterested, he looked in his mirror, accel erated impressively. "I'm headed for Ballachulish." "Where's that, is this the right direction?" "Aye, twenty mile north." He'd got the seatbelt on and looked at the driver's face, realized, just then, immediately and intuitively by that face that they were going to crash in this car. Glued on dashboard top (he could still see a hardened run of Evo-stick down past the clock) was a little cup made of colored glass squares, there was a real candle burning inside. The driver nodded at the candle, "I'm a Buddhist." 'Aye?" "I'm a snowboarder. A Buddhist snowboarder." "]Right." Music with a mechanical beat was playing very loudly. The Nephew knew this type of music was called "gangster rap music." It didn't have a patch on Roses or Lizzy. He'd seen it performed on televisions by men moving their arms violently in an effiort to back up their articulation. Once, at some girl's house, he'd listened closely to the words; each song was a sort of narrative and, relevantly enough, he'd noticed each song, one after another, was set inside a car. It was the music of a carbound planet. Often cars would draw opposite him when he was thumbing it at Yield junctions and the low sound of that car music was actually rocking the vehicle on its low suspension. With a sinister, subtle motion. The Buddhist snowboarder took the first corner with the needles on the speedo and revs pointed directly up, gearing in for curves. The Nephew glimpsed a lone sheep in a field with two magpies standing on its back, signifying God only knows what on the luck front. Cars were queued up in the petrol station at the caravan site and he glimpsed an old lady with the petrol nozzle stuck in ajerry can. "It's summer," announced the Nephew. "Sure is glorious, eh?" "There's no snow." "I thought you had mountains?"1 THE MAN WHO WALKS 27</page><page sequence="23">"Aye, but no that high. Few patches lying through summer in the conies but you wont find more." "well, shit. I drove all night. I need a cup of tea." Looking straight ahead the Nephew pondered this relationship between himself and the unknown body part inside him right then that would fail one day, lead to his death. He thought, If only we knew. Way when you look into someone's eyes you don't foresee both will be serrated in a future crash impact, unless you predict futures and bring out those lacerations there your self Often the Nephew would dream that all future injuries and fatal ailments on the bodies surrounding him, at a party, or in the street, or with the women he'd lay beside in quiet rooms, that those ailments all imuediately manifested themselves simultaneously on the humans around him: tumors fruiting forth, faces tearing open, lungs as heavy as bags of seawater so all destiny was revealed in its sordidness. He believed it would be a mark of mercy to act immediately, invoke those destinies.... Sure as fate, half a mile on, yonder side of the village, they passed a man on a bicycle, the wing knifed so close the Nephew noticed the bicycle had no chain. In the mirror he saw the yellow wellies spreadeagle and the bike's back wheel rear up as the cyclist vanished into the ditch; then another mile on, the Buddhist snowboarder yelled, "Streuth," under-steered a comer, they crossed the road, the Nephew grimaced and, taking forty feet of barbed-wire and rotted fence posts with them, they stopped on the downward lee of a sloped rapeseed field, out of view of the road-two sickeningly colored snowboards almost took the Nephew's head off on their way out through the busted windscreen. The fucking candle was stfill burning. "See that, my Buddha looks after me." The Nephew turned to his driver smiling, says, "A car crash is the least excuse I need. Get your fucking trousers off." * Wow! The Nephew jamp into woken-ness, thought himself still in Man who walks' dreadful den. It was pitch dark and him no reported in to Foreman, yacuntya! Told Paulette to wake me! He sat up with fiercest of fierce thirsts upon him. Jeezo, what drought! He had to drink. He swung his legs out, stood, thought he was on the New Drug still, cause he floated, then fell 28 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="24">forward on the carpet and bit his tongue so's omaments chinked out in that dark there. Jesus Christ, I musta woke the dead, he thought. He held his breath and listened out for dear life. Not a cheep. His legs weren't there, they'd got numbed. "Itchy Magellan?" he says out loud. His reached-down hand came on the bone hardness of swollen feet, like as all the wasp poison had sunk down to his toes. He couldn't stand up his feet were so numbed and invisibled too in such darkness. Where was the light? That hot-water bottle was beside him, so's he unscrewed the top and gobbled rubbery-tasted water out it, most gushing down cold onto his chest and as he gulp-gulped down out of the hot-water bottle he realized, simultaneous, he was furiously bursting for a pee too! Nothing for it, after he'd drained the water down his gullet, he got the end of Old Moody, the Marquis of Lome, into the hot-water bottle end, trying to spill as little as possible as he pee'd back into it! Like this cow in a field he saw, drinking from the big trough his Uncle once had his eye on, a cow drinking and pishing at the same time, its tail canted out. "In the fields of Abraham," he moved lips to the words. He screwed the hot-water bottle top on, realized how chilly it was, so he pulled himself back into bed and cuddled up, holding warmnesses of yon hot-water bottle filled with his own urine to his chest. He was famished hungry. The Nephew nodded back off into delicious visions but then he was fill awake, needed to pee! Yes, yet again, shamelessly unoriginal and repetitive but true, and most probably needing to evacuate the same volume of liquid he had ingested from within the hot-water bottle, now unlikely to receive a similar volume of urine again back into itself; even taking into account that absorbed by his dehydrations. For who can calculate the strange ministries of the body? And should he, say, commence the peeing and find the hot-water bottle, in simple mathematical terms, pushed to its volumic limits, well, imagine! How could he hold his head high again after peeing the overflow onto Paulette's spare-bedroom carpet, especially if she noticed! This would bring his already low standing, in her and the general eyes of the countryside, to a new low. In conclusion the Nephew's meditations were led toward one pulverizing insight, in the manner of that written about by Leibniz or was it Santayana's essay on Lucretius? Who cares, the conclusion was: Get me to the pisser, yacuntya! THE MAN WHO WALKS 29</page><page sequence="25">He got his arms down on carpet, then he lowered his numbed feet. He tried to find those boxer shorts, in case he run into one of Paulette's pesky daughters out there, him in the scud, and he'd be back in the newspaper for child molestings this time! It stung like billy-o getting the keks over the swole feet, they felt utterly ginormous to him, almost frightening, as if they may split, like when Hacker'd whispered to him, if you pulled back hard on your foreskin, the shaft of your knob would come shooting out like a banana, clunking to the floor and you'd never fit it back in again; in the days when it was rumored, also by Hacker, that you could swallow your own Adam's apple! Too painful to shuffle forward on knees so he'd to hunker self forward on elbows, pulling his dead legs behind him, like a slither of knapdallicks hanging, bloody, from the arse of a ruptured sheep, as his Gran used to intone, for a variety of situations. Even before the Nephew reached the door, the carpet had pulled off the boxer shorts to his ankles and his elbows were tingling. He could reach up easy to the handle of your average door without the use of legs. This was a very average door. He reached up to try sweep the emulsion, find a light switch, but it was so dark, he couldnt make a thing out till his eyes adjusted to the little leaked light from beyond the curtains. His reaching fingertips could just manage a light switch. He thought, Perhaps there's some EEC directive as to exactly what height light switches should be positioned at? Fuck alone knows, cause obviously Glasgow has to be taken into account, and you know what they say, Nay need to replace a light bulb at the Blind Home, yacuntya. By pattering his fingers, the light burst on. His feet were so swollen with these little toes on the end. Like an orange when you stick it full o' cloves. He sort of panicked at the sight of his feet, maybe he needed a doctor; he didn't like abnormalities at the best of times though fascinated by them in other people, but these were substantially abnormal feet swellings. Trying to be as quiet as a ghost, he crawled out onto the landing, pulling on the base of the banisters. He listened to the hermetic silence of the slept house and was sure he felt a commensurate arousal in his compressed penis. There were two other doors. Dragged his poor old Moody over that acrylic carpet; he too-clearly experienced the insensitive textures of a bargain at Landmark warehouses. The Nephew clicked the door handle and gingerly shoved the first door, perhaps this was the little girls' place and a chorus of wails would arise. Light from his room showed up this other room: he saw gym equipment, one of those torturous-looking weight-lifting mechanisms, 30 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="26">and it seemed all other bodies were down the stair. He slithered, bit by bit, over to another door, but by the time he'd pulled it back it was just an airing cupboard with a breath of warm air from a dormant immerser tank, then some bloody towels fell on his head giving him the terrors but he yanked hold of them competitively (as if someone would beat him to it) and continued to crawl, throwing the towels ahead, clawing over them, easing that down the stair passage, planning to use the towels to shroud his nudiness should his crawl be intercepted. He was fair bursting to pee by then. The stairs were awful steep-seeming in the darkness and blood ran to his head as he began his descent, testicles steadily compressed by each stair edging till he could lay his left cheek on the downstairs corridor carpet. No improvement in the man-made fibers department. Now there were more doors, up and down the infemal corridor. He wasn't even sure what was the washing machine cupboard any more, never mind the locale of the cludgie. Sorta eeny meeny miney mo, he sumley surmised. Made him think of that Traffic song, "House for Everyone," on the first album: On the door of one was: "Truth." On the other one was: "Lies." Which one should I enter through? I really must decide. A Dave Mason composition. I do believe. Yacuntya. He reached up, gently compressed one door handle, pushed the lightweight, hollow-feeling door in gently, and he was trying to check the walls for kiddies' posters, My Little Pony or Jason Donovan, whatever the fiuck floated the boat for these queer nippers of nowadays. Why had he not suffered hisself to get the snowboarder's breeks on? Cause bastardizing things wouldn't get over his blobby feet! Another unoccupied room almost in darkness; and his people homeless! He noisily elbowed the way in, dragging his legs behind like a snake shucking its own skin. Even a bucket or flowerpot would have to suffice by now. There was a strange, excited trundling sound in the blackness to his left. A light went on. Sitting up on a bed beside him, under a Lion King duvet, so close she could have leaned down and ruffled his hair, was one of Paulette's daughters, THE MAN WHO WALKS 31</page><page sequence="27">the Niamh one. To his left now, in his white cage, Johnstone the Gerbil was frantically galloping on his revolving wheel. "I can see your hairy bum." "Hush!" "Have you come here to have it off with me?" "No! Sbhh." "Have you come to have it offwith Mum?" "Nooooo, s hhlhh, your Mummy'll hear," he flicked the towel backward, trying to shield his arse. Some of it got covered by a roping of towel along the crack, so he lay, splayed out, trying to wiggle his boxer shorts back up his shins. "Why are you crawling? Are you drunk?" "Look at my feet." "Yeuch, what's wrong with them?" she goggled, fascinated but smiling; she wasnt petrified at all. "I'm looking for the toilet, darling, and I can't walk.' "Don't call me darling less you want to be my boyfriend and I've two of those already and they'll burst ya if you try an two-time, three-time with me," she tiptoed out bed, stepped over him and, to the Nephew's horror, carefully closed the bedroom door, shutting them both in. "Niamh, now I've GOT to go for a piddle. I'm bursting!" "Here then," she pattered over to her wardrobe; helpless, his head followed her. "It's Katia." She was holding up that vomiting and peeing doll she'd waved in his face earlier. "Eh?" "You have to fill it up with water, so she pee-pees. A girl can't do it, I try and it goes everywhere!" "You're joking." "If you doit, I'll call Mum." The Nephew looked at the doll's ooo-ing red plastic lips, the pale white of its descending esophagus. "Come on then." "You're mad; show me the toilet."y "Fill Katia so she pees real pee." "iWhat if I . . . spill. It's dirty." "Careful is what careful does." "Eh. Well, turn round then." 32 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="28">Something squeaked, it was one of those angle poise lamps she'd next to the bed and she'd twisted it so it glared in his face. "I'd like to watch, please," she says and folded up her legs. Nothing for it. He coughed and rose to his knees. Niamh giggled. "It's true what Mum says! You have a tiny one." He grimaced, took the doll, rolled to the side, away from her so the flaccid, carpet-chaffed tip of old Moody, the Marquis of Lorne, was placed into Katia's dead, outrageously accommodating lips. The daughter simply stood up on her bed to enjoy a full view, her brown eyes upon him, he sensed the jamming up of pee in his tubes as a massive case of Stage Fright descended, the need ... the inability! "I can't," he hissed, "with you staring." "Don't be shy." He looked away from her, tried to pretend the stupid-faced doll's lips were those of others, warm, living faces in the washing sea of lust. "Go on, pee in her mouth," Paulette's daughter whispered, then suddenly she groaned, all to herself, and it was the privacy of that groan which led to a terrible arousal lifting in the Nephew, not so much at the latest jailable offense but the narrative of this event and how he would be able to slur it in some woman's ear at the perfect moment, as a first few driblets came, then a rich stream, and by angling the plastic doll's head she took it all proudly. He could have written to the manufacturers with admiration, praise, and relief! The doll grew heavy and warm in his cold hands and, when he was done, wisps of his desperate steam emerged from its lips as if the thing had taken up Marlboros. He was reminded of the drinking days he'd kneel to the chemical toilet in the dark, then light a match to check if there was any blood in there. He looked at the young girl and licked his lips slowly. "Men are so disgusting," she said, stepping over him, then very gingerly cradling Katia. She placed the doll in a regimental row of imitation beings. "Night, night, crawl quietly and don't wake Mum." He began to crawl out again; she made him struggle with the door and she switched off the light; all the way Katia stood in the comer of the girl's room with her dismal gang, watched the Nephew's painful progress with deadened contempt. Halfway back up the bloody stairs all the lights came crashing on. Least by this time he'd re-hoisted the boxer shorts and perfected a stair-edge hop THE MAN WHO WALKS 33</page><page sequence="29">to prevent them working down. It was version two on the sprog front. The Nephew looked down, along the length of his leg at its reprimanding stare, then he pitifully attempted to accelerate his ascent when the child walled away, but moments later, pulling a dressing-gown around her and coughing, Paulette stood, shockingly tall at the bottom of the stairs. "Why didn't you wake me?" the Nephew whined. "I bloody tried, you were out the game, mumbling all kinds of stuff, and what are you doing crawling around nude in the house?" "Excuse me, but could you direct me to the toilet?" he sighed in normal volume. "What in the name of Christ is wrong with your feet?" she says and honked her nose. "There was a wasp's nest in the nose of my canoe. I was chastised." She climbed the stairs and studied his swole feet, then let out a phlegmy chuckling, "Only one cure for that. Along with a little anesthetic of course." Paulette rolled him down beneath sodium tangerine street lamps on the stolen hospital trolley, as all the lights came on in the adjacent houses and the curtains moved. They stopped where the drive ended in an oval turning place. "You got a tax disk on this?" "Does for wheeling Colin in the house when he gets back from the pub pished mortal. Right. On your feet, son." With his arm around Paulette's toweling robe they made on into the Argyllshlire Debatable Lands, the familiar tracts where new estates blunder into reedy fields with a pretense of civilization; where cable TV and sewering runs out, abrupt, where telephone wires turn back on themselves while the lazy movements of drifting night beasts rustle against the thistles. Farm animals wander freely here with the same liberties as the holy cow in India. A patrol of blue keel marks on sheep flanks show just above the reeds of the ever-damp ground. A perfect gate stands alone, abandoned on each side by its fence. As they labored into so-called fields a particularly virile thistle banged against his thigh, a fat sappy nettle released its bubbles of poison along a shin while her terry-toweling threw the plants aside before her. With disappoint ment he could detect the frazzled end of censorious under-denim round her trainers. 34 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="30">They halted in unformed fields, deep in dark, the estate just mushrooms of streetlight vapor to their rear, the roofs shining. Paulette blundered him from left to right, almost toppling him a couple of shots till the dimensions were agreeable, his naked legs, gynecologically splayed, both his swollen bare feet were deep sunk in two substantial fiesh cowpats, hardened by daylight's sluggish encroach, the crusts digging into blond hairs on his upper feet. "Best cure for swole feet is the good soak in the fresh cowpats," she announced dubiously, darting out that right hand to his shoulder, steadying him as she lit up two more joints of the New Drug in her mouth and he relaxed but shivered as she popped the now familiar gear in his lips. "It's great for pain, I took a good toke when I went into labor with Niamh fore they carted me away." Stood in shit was karmic revenge on him after the Fed, the Nephew thought, and says, "Is there no risk of infection?" "That what you say to all the girls?" "When Mockit's old man got sunk on the convoys the men used to pee on their hands to keep the frost out them and they all got infected in their cracked knuckles and that." "Well, in an open wound, sure, but your own waste can be good, all the supermodels are drinking one another's pee these days. I find that sexy." "Mmm," he kept quiet, then says, "I feel, Paulette, you run a visceral household." "I never need Vaseline." "You're sexy, Paulette, I recall you used to like a man to sing a song in your ear while . . ." "Is that what you call it? Your singing was no better than your shagging." The women always have their wee thing, the Nephew thought, like that bint: showers and volcanoes! Yup, if you can find the wee button of their fetish and press it forever, they'll love you okay. Once I get the Man Who Walks' money, a wee trip to Japan might be in the offing, everyone's always on about the dump, and working up a lather with yon caviar whoor in the Jacuzzi, chucking out the soap suds, mmm. The Nephew, a symbol of his nation, shivered, stood square in the cow shit, musing under cloudy Scotch skies on better days ahead. THE MAN WHO WALKS 35</page><page sequence="31">* Ihe Man Who Walks moved down those slopes with a camping pack on his back and his unlit pipe upside down in his mouth to stop it filing with the rain. On the end of each long arm dangled a carrier bag. Both bags were filed fitll of water, the plastic handles strained against his hands, and he had to hold the bags out to get them clear of his moving legs. The bag he held with his left arm had a large dead salmon foating inside, curled around against the plastic; you could see its silver flank of scales. The other bag just had water in it that splashed out in response to his erratic walk. It was still raining when he arrived outside the Hotel. In the Hotel car park, next to two parked buses, he tipped out the water fom the bags. He wrapped the salmon in one and laid it by his boot; then, using two fngers, he reached up to his left eye and removed it. It was a glass eye. After he'd taken out the glass eye he poked into the dark recess of the socket and from beneath the little fap of skin he removed a small tinfoil package of cannabis resin. He unwrapped it, used his thumbnail to split away more than half, then swallowed the lump of resin. He wrapped the remaining portion and put it back in the socket behind the eye, which he replaced. He picked up the salmon and crossed to the door of the lounge bar. Inside, the Hotel was busy with tourists from the buses who would have been staying there that night. When he reached the bar he said, "A score of nips." "A score? You want twenty whiskies for the bus party?" The barman slid out a tray, then started to count twenty shot glasses. He shouted, "In one glass, man; in one glass!" The barman looked at him, sighed, reached for a tankard and started fliung it with repeated shots of whisk. The Man Who Walks slapped the salmon on the bar top. "Cash or fsh?" he asked. The barman said, "Look, sir, barter went out with the Middle Ages, it'll have to be the legal tender." TIhe Man Who Walks took a very large wad of wet one-pound notes fom his greatcoat pocket and, with one eyebrow raised, peeled the paper notes; a few tore in half they were so sodden, but he stuck them down on the wooden bar top. The barman collected over twenty of the soaked notes and half notes but didn't put them 'in the till, he laid them out to dry on a radiator by some beer crates. The barman ran up the till and put the change down beside the dead fsh. "Can you take that off the bar, please." 36 ALAN WARNER</page><page sequence="32">The Man Who Walks took the fish off the bar and put it inside the plastic bag. "What a beautifiu big fish, is it a salmon?" a nearby tourist asked. The Man Who Walks removed his glass eye again, grinned at the tourist, then said, "Look i-nto my mind." The tourist moved sharply away. ihe Man Who Walks took a small case from inside his overcoat. He opened it and removed his drinking eye. This glass eye was similar to his other but the white of the eye was specially rivered with reddened blood vessels designed to match with his living eye after the consumption of twenty whiskies. He ftted the red eye in. An hour and three-quarters later it was after closing time and the lounge bar was deserted apart from the Man Who Walks; his tankard still had a good dose of whisky in the bottom. The barman repeated, "Come on now, sir. I'll have to ask you for your glass." T'he Man Who Walks picked up the carrier bag: the upside-down dead eye of the fsh and its gaping mouth were inside, pressed against the grayish-looking plastic. He lifted the salmon out by its head, clamping the gills with his grip, he gently tipped the whisky fom the tankard into the open mouth of the dead fsh, carefil not to spill a drop, then banged the emptied tankard down on the bar top. Good night! he yelled. He stepped out of the Hotel into the rainy darkness and held the big salmon's mouth up to his own, then tipped his head back and gulped all that whisky out from the insides of that fsh. 'Then the Man Who Walks took the salmon's tail in both hands, swung back and gave the big bastard a good fling across the road. The fish went spinning through the night, then landed with a bump on the roof of one of the buses no doubt leading to a lot of shitty speculation among the tourists in the mornming concerning the feeding habits of the golden eagle, etc., etc., but meanwhile he was of, striding into the wet black of nightimeness with his thumbs under the straps of his camping pack. He moved along the back roads, across the Concession Lands, between the outlying homes he made his way through the darknesses until he came to a slight gradient in the road where he halted. He stepped into a Fat field and strode into the blackness. There was a large crack and a blue explosion as he walked into an electric cattle fence cranked up to the max. He yowled, fell backward into a puddle on his arse. He could not see a thing in front of him, behind him, to his left or to his right, so he did not know where the electric fences were, out there, in the dark, waiting for him. The Man Who Walks sat still in the raining field and chuckled in the dark, then let out a sound more like a sob. He leaned forward and swung his backpack off. He pulled out a set of poles which clinked together and sounded like tent poles. But they were not. He was unfolding the plastic walls and roof of a child's playhouse that THE MAN WHO WALKS 37</page><page sequence="33">he often used for his camping expeditions. He tried to get up on his feet to pitch the playhouse, but he was mortal as a newt and slumped back on his arse each time. Eventually he unlaced his boots and removed them, then lay back and just pulled the playhouse plastic up to his chin like a sheet. He started snoring, water made bubbles in his uptumed nostrils and there was also the sound, in the darlmess, of big raindrops pattering down on the plastic. In the morning his boots were flled with water. In the afternoon sun, carrying a new bag of water, the Man Who Walks came down off those hills. He entered old Greyhead's General Store to get provisions. He placed purchases on the counter beside the till, spilling water from his bag all over the j1or as he moved. He bought four cans of South Atlantic pilchards and one can of North Atlantic pilchards! He bought Clann tobacco, two copies of the Daily Telegraph, two copies of the Financial Times and two copies of the Times. "It's brightened up a lot now, hasn't it?" said old Greyhead. "Shut your mouth and give us a carrier bag," the Man Who Walks said, and he'd forgotten to change his drinking eye so he had one red eye and one clear one. Although he stinks, shouts, spills water and once shat pilchard skitters on the floor of the shop, then wiped his arsehole with a dead pigeon, Old Greyhead held the Man Who Walks in the highest regard because of the quality newspapers he reads. "Good afternoon now, sir," Greyhead said, following the Man Who Walks with a swishing mop. The Man Who Walks moved up the paths to his one-story house on the hill. He emptied the bag of water into a forty-fve-gallon drum in the overgrown garden which the rain had already filled, so it poured down the sides. He opened the front door to his house. Afernoon surn still shone over his shoulder but it was dark in there: pitch dark. He shut the door behind him, got down on all fours a-nd dragged the carrier bag of provisions, crawling forward through the network of fithy papier-mache" tunnels and igloos he had constructed inside the rooms and corridors of the house: the papier mache' made from years and years of unread quality newspapers. 38 ALAN WARNER</page></plain_text>
