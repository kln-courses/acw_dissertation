<plain_text><page sequence="1">IF I WERE A Brai). Words by Gladys Conklin; Pictures by Artur Marokvia. Holiday House, New York. $3.50. 38 p.; ill. 1965. Here is another of Gladys Conklin's imaginative nature books for young children, presenting a sur- vey of birds for four- to eight-year-olds. The anthropomorphic approach ("If I were a bird, ! could whistle or call or sing better than I can now . . .") is used to put the child in the place of various kinds of birds, and happily not to per-</page><page sequence="2">NEW BIOLOGICAL BOOKS 201 sonify the birds themselves. In this way one or two distinctive facts are presented about twenty-seven of the species an American child is most likely to meet, along with a picture, and in most cases a notation of the song. (However, since no staff marks are used, this is difficult for a parent or teacher to reproduce accurately enough to be recognized by children.) The illustrations are some- what loosely drawn, in a four-color lithographic process, but are accurate enough to make the differ- ent birds easily recognizable. The unrealistic use of color in backgrounds, while attractive, might prove distracting to young children in transferring their recognition to real birds outdoors. The imaginative approach of the text is appealing to this age group, and is simple enough to be easily understood. For such an elementary book, how- ever, a good deal of knowledge is presumed on the part of children about birds in general, and a few pages on such general topics as habits, feeding, and nesting would be a useful addition. The book ends with a very good factual section on feathers at a slightly more advanced level than the main text, explaining and encouraging the making of a feather collection. Additional sections at this level on other aspects of bird life such as nest collecting or feeding birds in winter would probably make the book more valuable for the six- to eight-year-olds.
