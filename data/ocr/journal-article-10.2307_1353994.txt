In 1901 and again in 1904 at Gournia, Harriet Boyd Hawes uncovered several tombs on the north spur of the very ridge on which the settlement of Gournia is located. In 1908, Richard B. Seager uncovered a large number of tombs on the western side of the island of Mochlos. Both cemeteries were used first at the beginning of the Prepalatial period, ca. 2900 or 2600 B.c.; that at Mochlos appears to have gone gout of use by the end of the Prepalatial period, ca. 1900 B.C., although parts were re-used later in the New Palace period, while that at Gournia remained in use through the Old Palace period, until ca. 1700 B.C. Hawes and Seager published the major finds from these cemeteries but paid little atten- tion to the cemeteries as a whole, to the architecture of the tombs, or to the actual burials. As a result, the picture of the cemetery at Mochlos was incomplete and somewhat confused, and the very existence of the North Cemetery at Gournia was all but forgotten. The pri- mary aim of this book is to re-examine the extant remains in both cemeteries as carefully and in as much detail as possible and so to gain a more complete picture of both cemeteries. Such a re-examination seems warranted for several reasons: first, because of the important role that each cemetery played in the life of its settlement at a fairly early stage in the devel- opment of the Bronze Age civilization of Crete; second, because of the intrinsic importance of the architecture of the tombs in these cemeteries, which make up a sizable portion of the known architecture of the entire Prepalatial period; and third, because of the general desir- ability of providing as clear a context as possible for the finds that Hawes and Seager pub- lished from these cemeteries, among which are some of the most spectacular objects ever found in Prepalatial contexts. As a result of the cleaning operations that were carried out on the sites in the summers of 1971, 1972, and 1976, which were necessary because most of the tombs had been reburied in the interval since their original excavation, it has been possible to draw actual-state plans and sections of the tombs, as well as over-all maps of the cemeteries, and to furnish the detailed description that Hawes and Seager neglected to provide. The first two chapters of the book are devoted to these cemeteries. After a description of the cemetery as a whole, each tomb is considered separately. First, a bibliography is provided (when one exists); then the location and excavation of each tomb are described; its architecture is described next; and finally, whatever information may be gleaned about its burials and chronology is provided. When it has been possible to re-examine old finds, and whenever new finds have been made in the course of the cleaning, a catalogue of these finds is appended at the end of the de- scription of each tomb. While all the finds reported from the Gournia tombs have been included in the catalogues, it has not been thought necessary to republish all the finds from Mochlos, already published so well by Seager. The built tombs that were used for most of the burials in both cemeteries belong to a distinct class of tomb that was popular in Crete during the Prepalatial and Old Palace</page><page sequence="6">PREFACE periods. Several examples in addition to those at Mochlos and Gournia have been excavated throughout the island, in southern Crete, where they sometimes appear alongside the tholos tombs, as well as central and eastern Crete, where they are most common. They have been described in various ways by their excavators, on the one hand as "bone enclosures", "os- suaries", or "ossuary cists", and on the other as "rectangular built tombs", "burial cham- bers", or "house tombs". The confusion results in part from the use of one term to refer to the nature of burials in the tomb and of another to refer to the structural appearance of the tomb: for example, the same tomb might be referred to as a chamber tomb and as an ossuary simultaneously.1 But the confusion also results from differing opinions regarding the origi- nal structure of the tomb alone. According to one view, the tombs were simple walled en- closures limiting a certain burial plot. This seems to have been the view of the early British archaeologists at Palaikastro and has recently been revived by Nicholas Platon.2 According to the other view, the tombs were modeled after domestic architecture, and the low rubble walls that are preserved are socles that originally supported a roofed superstructure of per- ishable material. This view was first expressed by Hawes, who initially identified the tombs on the west slope of the North Cemetery as intramural burials.3 She was seconded in her view by Arthur Evans, who noted that the Mochlos tombs resembled "miniature stone houses,"4 and by John Pendlebury, who believed that the Mochlos and Palaikastro tombs imitated the "traditional houses of the living of a bygone era."5 The problem was further complicated by scholars such as Seager and Stephanos Xanthoudides, and more recently Keith Branigan, who recognized both types of tomb.6 In part, this disagreement is due to the failure of all the early archaeologists, not just Hawes and Seager, to study these tombs carefully and to record the architectural details of the tombs in their publications. Of the numerous examples of this type of tomb that have been excavated, few have received anything but the briefest notice. As a result, their preva- lence has been overlooked, and their importance in the Bronze Age civilization of Crete has been neglected; scholars have tended instead to focus on the circular tombs of the Mesara, which are more fully published but which are a regional phenomenon. Another aim of this book, therefore, is to fill the gaps in our knowledge of this class of tomb and to provide as much information as possible about these tombs as a whole. In Chapter III a catalogue of all known tombs of this type is provided. The tombs are presented in alphabetical order by site, each with a brief discussion of its architecture, burials, and chronology. The catalogue and the architectural discussion in Chapter IV make it clear that Hawes's description of the Gournia tombs and Evans' of the Mochlos tombs are fully justified. These rectangular built tombs or ossuaries warrant the title "house tombs" that Hawes introduced to describe them, not necessarily because the dead were thought to inhabit the tombs but because the tombs were architectural imitations of the houses of the living.

See also Shaw, p. 170 below. vi</page><page sequence="7">PREFACE vii and VI, the various uses of the tombs are examined further. These chapters are somewhat more speculative than the preceding ones but are offered here in the belief that speculation and theory are tools that archaeology, like any science, uses to advance knowledge. While some details of interpretation may need emendation in light of future discoveries, the gen- eral significance of these tombs in the political and religious life of early Crete seems clear. The re-examination of the Gournia and Mochlos cemeteries would not have been possi- ble without the cooperation of the Greek Archaeological Service and particularly Costis Davaras, Director of the Agios Nikolaos Museum and for a long time Ephor of Antiquities in East Crete, to whom I am deeply indebted for support of the project and continuing encouragement. Dr. Davaras undertook a large part of the cleaning that was required at both sites and has generously allowed me to publish many of the discoveries resulting from this cleaning. I am also grateful to Markos Peronikolis, former Custodian of Antiquities at Gournia, and lannis Kouroupakis, Custodian at Mochlos, who were both eager to lend assistance whenever it was needed; to the many archaeologists who have permitted me to discuss in Chapter III tombs that they excavated, especially Nicholas Platon (Agios Geor- gios and Zakros), lannis and Effie Sakellarakis (Archanes), Costis Davaras (Linares), and Gerald Cadogan (Myrtos, Pyrgos); and finally to Epimeletria Stavroula Apostolakou and the staff of the Agios Nikolaos Museum, who always accommodated me most graciously on my frequent trips to the Museum. The main part of the field work for this project was carried out in the summers of 1971 and 1972 with grants from the United States Educational Foundation in Greece (Fulbright Program) and in 1976 with the aid of a Harriet Pomerance Fellowship from the Archaeo- logical Institute of America. In 1976 a team of architects from Cornell University, Frederick Hemans, Frederick Guthrie, and Margaret Denney, drew up the map of Mochlos and its cemetery, and two graduate students from Yale and Columbia Universities, Faith Hent- schel and Regina Lee, assisted me in drawing actual-state plans of tombs on the south slope of the Mochlos cemetery. In 1978 a Faculty Excellence Grant from the University of North Carolina at Greensboro allowed me to return to Crete to study finds in the Agios Nikolaos Museum from the 1976 cleaning on Mochlos, and in 1980 a Grant-in-Aid from the Ameri- can Council of Learned Societies allowed me to complete the topographical map of the North Cemetery at Gournia with the aid of two students from the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, Nancy Sultan and Jennifer Reid. In 1985 a stipend from the Research Council of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro permitted me to do further work in the Agios Nikolaos Museum. During all these years, I have also been indebted to the Directors of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens, especially James R. McCredie and Henry S. Immerwahr, for their patience in making application on my behalf for the necessary study permits from the Greek Archaeological Service. JEFFREY S.

Both these areas, with their steep slopes and rocky terrain, were unsuitable for large- scale habitation, and neither could be readily farmed, but both provided suitable space for the early burials of the settlement. Particularly suitable were the rock shelters, located in both areas, which consisted of small natural openings in the rocks that needed no working before they could be used. These rock shelters were used for many of the very first burials made by the new settlers and provided the initial impetus for the cemeteries that grew up around them. Sphoungaras, which is located 150 to 200 meters north of the Gournia ridge close to the coast, was the larger of the two cemeteries (Plan 1). It included an area extending over 70 meters in a north-south direction along the foot of Sphoungaras and reaching 40 to 50 me- ters up its slope. It was explored by Harriet Boyd Hawes in 1904 and excavated by Richard Seager in 1910, and the results of the excavation were published by Edith Hall in 1912.1 The cemetery remained in continual use from the foundation of Gournia until its destruc- tion at the end of the LM I phase in the Neopalatial period. In the EM IIa phase of the Pre- palatial period, burials were made here in at least two rock shelters. Shelter I, the largest of the shelters in either cemetery, had been used earlier at theer cie a end of the Neolithic for habitation.2 In the later EM II and EM III phases, burials that apparently consisted of direct inhumations in the ground were made in two other areas on Sphoungaras (Deposits A and B). These were much more extensive than the rock-shelter burials, Deposit A com- prising an area nearly 9 meters square and up to 1 meter deep, and Deposit B an irregular area about 13 meters in length; together they suggest a considerable growth in the size of Gournia's population. They contained a large number of complete vases, over 50 reported by Hall, which are mostly mottled Vasilike ware but also include a number of white-on- black EM III vases. The pottery, which includes many pieces of fine quality, and the other finds, including stone vases and some gold jewelry and ivory seals, also suggest the growing prosperity of the new settlement.3 In the final phase of the Prepalatial period, MM Ia, pithos burial was introduced to Sphoungaras. Direct inhumations continued to be made in both Deposits A and B, and at one point in Deposit A they were clearly stratified above EM II/III remains. Pithos burial, however, now became the most popular form of burial, 1 In addition to Hall's publication, Sphoungaras, Hawes published descriptions of the excavation of three rock shelters in UPMTA I, iii, 1905, pp. 180-183 and Gournia, p. 56. 2 Hall, Sphoungaras, pp. 46-48. 3 So Hall, Sphoungaras, p. 55: "It seems accordingly possible that the entire slope had been used as a burial place in Early Minoan times and that many of these earlier graves had been removed by later inhabitants to make room for their own dead.... This is indeed the most important conclusion to be drawn from these early burials, viz., that the town of Gournia was a large and prosperous community in the Early Minoan II period."</page><page sequence="22">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA as elsewhere in Crete,4 and although most of the pithoi belong to the New Palace period, MM I burial jars, as well as a few larnakes, were uncovered at several points over a large area of Sphoungaras. At no time in the Prepalatial period or later were built tombs ever located on Sphounga- ras, nor was any other kind of coherent architecture found there. At most, crude retaining walls were erected around the graves or along the slope in order to hold back the earth fill of the slope and prevent the erosion of the burials. Quite a different arrangement was to be found on the north spur of the Gournia ridge, where the other cemetery of the settlement, the North Cemetery, was located. The north spur of the ridge continues in the same north-south direction for a distance of about 80 meters beyond the central peak of the ridge, what Hawes called the Acropolis, where the settlement lay (Plan 2; PI. 1).5 A spine of hard limestone (sideropetra) outcrop- pings runs down the center of the spur and, towards the north, reaches a maximum height of 36.40 m. above sea level. Here the spur narrows, and its slopes are particularly steep and rocky. It is in this area that the rock shelters are located. To the south the spur slopes off towards the east and west more gently, and there was sufficient space to accommodate a number of built tombs. The cemetery was explored first by Hawes, who dug here on the first day of her excavations at Gournia in 1901 and on the last day of her 1904 campaign. In the preliminary report that appeared in 1904 she described her findings as "intramural burials", but in the report of 1905 and in the final publication of Gournia of 1908 she introduced the term "house tomb" to describe the buildings which she had uncovered here. She defined a house tomb as "an enclosure which from the existing remains of walls and doorway cannot be distinguished from an ordinary dwelling, but which is full of bones and skulls in disorder-a veritable charnel house."6 She included little additional information about the architecture of the tombs and published only their more notable finds. In 1971 and 1972 the cemetery was explored again under the general supervision of the Greek Archaeo- logical Service and the Ephor of Antiquities in East Crete, Costis Davaras, and preliminary reports were published in 1973 and 1974.7 The primary aim was to gain a clearer picture of the tombs that Hawes had excavated, but in the course of the work new finds were un- covered, and two additional tombs were excavated. As a result, it became clear that Hawes's tombs were not isolated on the north spur but were set in the midst of an important cemetery containing several built tombs. As in the cemetery at Sphoungaras, burials took place here from the very beginning of the EM II phase. They were made in two rock shelters (V and VI) and in at least one built tomb (III). The remains from both tomb and shelters appear to have belonged to the EM IIa phase of the Prepalatial period and to have been contemporary with those in Rock Shelter I at Sphoungaras. The deposits in the North Cemetery are more extensive, and it may be that it was the larger of the two cemeteries at the time the settlement was founded. No burials have been excavated from the immediately succeeding phases of the Prepalatial 4 See Pini, Minoischen Graberkunde, pp. 11-13. 5 Plate 1 is a photograph of the site from the northeast taken during the course of excavations in 1903 at the time of Wilhelm D6rpfeld's visit.

At the end of the Prepalatial period, however, when major building was undertaken in the town of Gournia,8 several small built tombs were constructed on the north spur (I, II, IV, VII, and VIII), and the area came to form a small necropolis on the edge of the town proper. Indeed, these tombs, resembling the houses in the town and located adjacent to them, separated only by the North Ridge Road, might easily have been mistaken by a visitor for part of the town itself. At the same time that these tombs were constructed, an important open-air shrine was erected in their midst. It stood for several centuries, long before the small palace at Gournia and its shrines were constructed, and may have served a communal function. The North Cemetery, then, with its built tombs and its shrine, contrasts markedly with the more modest, if more extensive, cemetery at Sphoungaras. Its finds of the EM II and MM I phases are also much richer than those from the burials at Sphoungaras, and it seems likely that while the majority of the population was buried at Sphoungaras, the elite were buried in the North Cemetery. The cemetery continued to be used into the period of the Old Palaces, although no further building appears to have occurred after the end of the Prepa- latial period. Despite its apparent importance at this time, and unlike Sphoungaras, it ceased to be used for burials after the destruction of the Early Town and appears to have been abandoned once new burial customs using chamber tombs came into vogue and once the palace and its communal shrines were constructed.

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Tombs I and II are located side by side on the east slope of the north spur.9 Tomb II is the northernmost of the built tombs in the cemetery, and immediately to its north, where Rock Shelters V and VI are located, and to its northeast, the slope steepens and becomes more rocky. Both tombs were excavated by Hawes in 1904 on her "last day's digging" at Gournia (July 20, 1904), and they can be identified today on the basis of two points in her report. She noted that the second and northern of the two consisted of "two rectangular rooms with door between" and that it was located next to the rock shelters on this side of the spur. She also noted that they lay side by side, 15 feet apart. Since the rock shelters may be located without any difficulty just to the north of Tomb II and since Tomb II fits Hawes's description, the two tombs may be safely identified, although in fact they lie much closer together, only three to four feet apart. The tombs were cleaned by the author in 1971 with 8 See Soles, AJA 83, 1979, pp. 151-156. 9 Much of the description of Tombs I and II is repeated from Soles, AJA 83, 1979, pp. 158-164 but in a somewhat different format. Further information about architectural details has occasionally been added, as have the catalogues of finds. The plans and the reconstruction of the tombs published in AJA are republished here, but many of the photographs are simply referred to in the text. 3</page><page sequence="24">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA .y , -- I FIG. 1. Reconstruction of Gournia Tombs I and II (drawn by Jean Carpenter Efe) the assistance of Markos Peronikolis, Custodian of Antiquities at Gournia, and under the general supervision of the Greek Archaeological Service. In 1972 the pit in the northwest corner of Tomb I was excavated for the first time by the Greek Archaeological Service under the supervision of Costis Davaras. ARCHITECTURE (Pls. 2 and 3) Tomb I is a small, nearly square building measuring ca. 3.92 m. east-west, ca. 4.20 m. on its west side, and ca. 3.72 m. on its east. It consists of a large pit dug into the bedrock on the slope of the spur, deeper at the west because of the rise of the slope. The pit is unevenly cut in places, and these irregularities in turn caused certain variations in the architecture of the tomb. Once cut, the pit was lined with walls on all four sides and then divided down the middle by a wall running parallel to the outer north and south walls, forming two separate rooms. The north wall is the best preserved of the outer walls and best illustrates the method of construction used for the outer walls of the tomb. It consists of a simple retaining wall of stones set in uneven courses in earth mortar against the face of the cut bedrock. Seldom more than the thickness of one stone, this wall is little more than a lining that served in part to prevent the seepage of ground water into the tomb. At the point where the inner lining of the wall reaches the height of the cut pit, a height of six courses at its west end and three at its east, the wall is widened by a second row of stones set next to those of the inner wall as an outer facing. Unlike the inner wall, the outer facing rests on the surrounding, uncut bedrock of the slope, and only one course of this outer facing, resting on a thin layer of earth packing, is preserved.10 10 North wall: L. ca. 3.24 m.; W. 0.50-0.72 m.; H. on outside ca. 0.21 m.; H. on inside, at east ca. 0.52 m., at west ca. 1.33 m. 4</page><page sequence="25">A r- Q 0- 0- o. 0 0 . s:: CZ 44 U) '*1'^ H (\ 0 r CD</page><page sequence="26">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA 32.64 A w?WwA KIk^w.r^z ,,^Avvc,^AW, 4C~~C^^ 3291 D 32e25Z o C C 0 I 2 3M. JSS FIG. 3. Sections AB and CD through Gournia Tombs I and II The remaining walls use the same method of construction, but their outer facings are less well preserved. The east wall, standing to a height of three courses on the inside and one on the outside, has lost a number of the stones of its outer face. Those remaining rest on a bed- ding of earth, considerably thicker than that beneath the north wall (as much as 0.15 meters thick), which in turn rests on the uncut bedrock. At three points, single large stones are placed across the wall to bind the outer facing and inner wall lining. At its north end, the wall appears to have been set back intentionally in order to break the right angle. If intentional, this setback would have been both decorative and functional in origin, providing as it does additional space for the entrance to the narrow passage between the two tombs. In the Prepa- latial period Minoan builders were often capable of such refinements, just as they could also, and often at the same time, employ sloppy techniques and produce rather shoddy effects. 1 The west wall of the tomb is the highest preserved, rising to a maximum of eight courses at its center. The stones of the inner lining are set in the usual earth mortar against the cut bedrock but in less regular courses than those of the other interior linings. Larger stones appear to have been placed in the upper two courses, and perhaps as a result part of the wall in the north room has collapsed. The wall has lost most of its outer facing, only part of which is preserved at the north end and towards the south. The large stones located against 11 East wall: L. ca. 3.72 m.; W. ca. 0.44 m.; H. on outside ca. 0.32 m. 6</page><page sequence="27">TOMB I its outer side towards the north do not belong to it; like the stones found in the earth fill within the tomb during the 1971 cleaning, they have simply rolled down to their present position.12 The construction of the south wall differs somewhat from that of the other outer walls (PI. 3:a). The pit on this side of the tomb was not cut in a straight line. The western half was cut back farther than the eastern half, and as a result there is a corresponding setback in the wall. The western half of the wall has lost all its outer facing, although its inner lining is preserved to a height of six courses. It runs parallel to the eastern half of the wall but is set back from it by ca. 0.28 m. and does not bond with it. The eastern half of the wall appears to be intact, its inner lining rising to a height of three courses and its outer facing consisting of small, fist-sized stones set in a minimum of earth mortar.13 The peculiar construction of these walls, with inner lining and outer facing, is rare, but it seems to have at least one parallel in a contemporary structure at Gournes Pediados that was used to house funerary offerings and has been identified as the epos Aa'KKoS.K 4 In each case the intent of the builders may have been to strengthen the structures by sinking them into bedrock, but the technique used for constructing the outer walls is also a short-cut, since fewer materials and less time would be required than for the erection of proper walls. The added facing serves to widen the wall and provide a socle of the necessary width to support a mud-brick superstructure. No remains of mud brick were reported by Hawes in any of the tombs, but the preservation of Tomb I, with the inner sides of the north and south walls each three courses high on the east and six on the west, suggests that the side walls of this building were provided with a stepped construction, required by the slope of the ground, to provide level beddings for mud-brick superstructures. No entrance to the tomb is readily apparent. On the interior the tomb is divided into two rooms by a partition wall that joins the east and west walls without bonding with either. It is preserved to a maximum of eight courses at its west, built in ordinary rubble with two faces of stones set in earth mortar. A foundation consisting of a single course of stones projects ca. 0.20 m. beyond the wall at its base on the north side (Pl. 3:c).15 The southern room formed by this wall is slightly L-shaped in plan as a result of the indentation of the south wall. It is ca. 2.90 m. long, ca. 1.46 m. wide at the east, and ca. 1.78 m. wide at the west. Its floor is evenly formed by the cut bedrock. A low bench runs along the base of the south wall for the entire length of the room. It follows the line of the south wall and is set back midway, at the point where the wall is set back. The eastern half of the bench is built of a single stone course set in earth mortar and at the time of its cleaning showed traces of white plaster. The western half is built with a stone facing, incompletely preserved, set against a backing of earth and bedrock that was not cut down to floor level.16 12 West wall: p.L. ca. 4.08 m.; W. at south ca. 0.54 m.; H. on inside ca. 1.45 m. 13 South wall: p.L. ca. 3.28 m.; W. at east ca. 0.50 m.; H. on outside, at east ca. 0.08 m.; H. on inside, at east ca. 0.40 m., at west ca. 1.08 m. 14 Hazzidakis, AcAr 1, 1915, pp. 59-63; see p. 151 below. 15 Partition wall: L. ca. 2.84 m.; W. 0.43-0.46 m.; H. ca. 0.94 m.; L. of foundation ca. 1.64 m.; H. of foun- dation ca. 0.13 m. 16 Bench: L. ca. 2.90 m.; W. 0.38-0.44 m.; H. ca. 0.17 m. 7</page><page sequence="28">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA The northern room of the tomb is a rectangular area ca. 2.06 m. long, ca. 1.07 m. wide at the east, and ca. 1.16 m. wide at the west (PI. 3:b). Its bedrock floor is level except along part of the south side, where it is filled with the foundation wall noted above, and in the northwest corner, where an irregular hole, ca. 0.75 m. deep, was dug. Originally the north room seems to have had the same length as the south room, but it was shortened by two short walls that fill its east end. These are built against each other and in turn against the outer east wall; they do not bond into the outer north wall or the partition wall, which they join at either end. They are the same height as the outer walls they join and appear to have formed part of the external wall of the tomb rather than a bench inside it.17 As there is no passage leading from one room to the other, nor any clear indication of a doorway leading into the tomb from outside, it is possible that this corner, strengthened by the double filling walls contiguous to both rooms, provided a solid platform for entry from outside and passage from one room to the other through openings in the mud-brick wall of the tomb at the level of the stone socle. It is equally possible, of course, that access to each room was gained through trap doors in the roof that could have been reached easily from the higher ground level along the west side of the tomb. BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY Hawes did not report on the skeletal remains in the tomb apart from her description of the tomb as a "house tomb" and her definition of a house tomb as a building "full of bones and skulls in disorder." In her Notebook for July, 1904,18 she also reported fragments of sarcophagi in the south room. She published five finds from the tomb: a silver kantharos with quatrefoil mouth (Her.Mus. 202), two clay polychrome kantharoi imitating metal shapes (Her.Mus. 3621, 3622), and two stone bowls (Her.Mus. 552, 553). In addition, she reported the find of a third stone bowl and a pair of bronze tweezers. In her Notebook she recorded some additional information about the location of these finds, noting that the silver kantharos and stone bowls were found in the south room and that the clay kantharoi, the unpublished stone vase, and the tweezers were found together in the southeast corner of the north room. During the cleaning carried out in 1971 and 1972, several additional finds were made. In 1971 scattered, extremely fragmentary bones, together with several pottery fragments, were found on the bedrock floor of the south room. The pottery fragments included some MM I polychrome specimens (G 1-6, 7, and 8), and both skeletal and pottery fragments were probably originally associated with the tomb. Directly outside the southeast corner of this room, two small vases, a miniature jug and a handleless cup (G I-4 and 5), were found in situ. They had been left side by side against the outer side of the south wall, presumably as funerary offerings. In 1972, when the deep pit in the northwest corner of the north room was excavated for the first time, another deposit was discovered in the bottom 0.60 m. of fill. Davaras, who excavated the pit, reported finding portions of eight skulls, together with a number of sea shells, two globular pyxides (G 1-13 and 14), two fruitstands (G 1-15 and 17 Interior walls: L. ca. 1.07 m.; W. of eastern wall ca. 0.28 m., of western wall ca. 0.42 m.; H. ca. 0.51 m. 18 Recently acquired by the University Museum of the University of Pennsylvania.

The pit was dug apparently for the special purpose of storing these skulls and the burial goods deposited with them. All the finds from Hawes's excavation and from the 1971 cleaning may be dated to the MM Ia or MM Ib/II phase, and the date of construction of the tomb is presumably at the beginning of the MM I pottery phase, as Hawes reported. What is surprising, however, is that several of the finds in the pit excavated in 1972 are earlier and, with the clear exception of the MM I stone vases, apparently date to the EM II phase. While it is possible that the tomb should be redated on the evidence of this new material, it seems more likely that these early finds had been buried elsewhere originally and were redeposited in this pit at the time the tomb was constructed, presumably after the collapse of the tomb which originally held them.19 Such an explanation would account for the presence of MM I vases among the EM II material. In the following catalogue all the finds from 1904 and 1971 are grouped togeth- er, while those from the separate deposit found in 1972 are listed at the end.

See p. 31 below. 20 Finds from the cleaning carried out in 1971, 1972, and 1976 are housed in the Agios Nikolaos Museum, and the Museum inventory numbers are provided for these in the following catalogues for Gournia and in Chapter II for Mochlos, whenever possible; where Museum numbers are not available, however, the find numbers provided at the time of the cleaning are retained. It has not always been possible to re-examine first- hand the finds from Hawes's excavation now in the Heraklion and University of Pennsylvania Museums, and the description of these objects here, particularly regarding pottery fabrics and measurements, relies on her original description. The names for colors, used in describing new pottery finds, are those suggested by the Munsell Soil Color Charts, with the exception that "buff" refers to colors in the pink to reddish yellow to very pale brown range (5YR 8/4-7.5YR 7/4, 7/6-10YR 7/3) and "brown-black" to colors in the red to dark reddish brown to black range (2.5YR 4/6, 3/4, 2.5/0). A comprehensive study of the Prepalatial pottery from Mochlos is planned for separate publication. 9</page><page sequence="30">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA Conical foot; low bowl with low carinated shoul- der; high, slightly concave upper wall; flaring quatrefoil mouth.

Upper surface of handles decorated with short horizontal strokes in white. The vase is discussed in Zois, Kamares-Stil, pp. 257- 258 and Walberg, Middle Minoan Pottery, p. 124. In addition to these two kantharoi and the silver one, a fourth kantharos from Gournia was published by Hawes (Gournia, p. 38, pl. VI:8) and a fifth, frag- mentary example by Davis (TUAS 4, 1979, pp. 36- 37, fig. 3). They belong to a distinct class of lobed kantharoi, of which several examples have been re- ported, and to a larger group of vases with crinkled rims that first appear in the MM Ib or Early Kama- res phase. For the other examples and for a possible Anatolian origin of the type, see Davis, TUAS 4, 1979, pp. 34-35. For an MM II date, see Walberg, Kamares, pp. 18-19 and Middle Minoan Pottery, p. 124. Two varieties of lobed kantharoi appear to be represented. One, which includes all four clay exam- ples from Gournia, as well as another from Zakros (Platon, "Epyov 1971, p. 227, pl. 276), has a separate foot, low bowl, and high upper wall. Because of the repetition of the same decorative motifs on the three intact Gournia vases, the branch motifs on the lobes of Gournia, p. 38, pl. VI:8 and G 1-3, the bands of red flanked with white at the shoulders of G I-2 and 3, and the hanging arcs of solid red and white inside their lips, as well as the similarity in shape, all three should be considered the product of the same work- shop, and G I-2 and 3, as Zois has suggested, perhaps the work of the same hand. The second variety, in- cluding the silver vase and those from Pseira (R. Sea- ger, Excavations on the Island of Pseira, Crete, Philadelphia 1910, p. 20, fig. 5), Mallia (Effenterre, Mallia, Necropoles II, p. 109, pl. XLIV), and Myr- tos, Pyrgos (Cadogan, ArchReports for 1977-1978, pp. 73-74, fig. 12), has a high flaring body without separate foot and a low, angular shoulder with rela- tively low rim. Her.Mus. 7882, from Mallia, which is virtually identical to the silver vase from Gournia in size and shape, may perhaps be considered a copy of this very vase. G I-4 (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4385).

Demargne, Achevement de lafouille au sud du palais et complements divers, quatrieme rap- port [Etudes cretoises XII], Paris 1962, p. 49, pl. XXXVII). The mottled decoration, although perhaps not the fabric, recalls the Vasilike style of EM II. In the MM Ia phase this style appears to have enjoyed a limited revival. Compare the vases from Gournes, Her. Mus. 7052-7055, 7059, 7060 (Zois, nIpoAXr7?jara, pp. 21-22, 89-90, pls. 29, 30); this vase probably dates to the same phase. G I-6 (Ag.Nik.Mus. P.71.1).

Three joining frag- ments preserving part of rim and upper wall. P.H. 0.053 m. Fine buff clay; black slip on exterior and around interior of rim; exterior originally decorated in white and red, now largely effaced. Decoration in band of red just below rim, followed by frieze of triangular spirals in white; another band of red below, followed by a frieze of vertical rippled lines (quirks) in white; another band of red below. The decoration is closely paralleled by that on a MM Ib kantharos from Palaikastro with two friezes flanked by red bands, the top frieze a row of similar triangular spirals (Bosanquet and Dawkins, PKU, p. 14, pl. XI:A; Zois, Kamares-Stil, p. 249; Walberg, Middle Minoan Pottery, p. 133, pi. 3:2). The tri- angular spiral originates in the EM III style, invent- ed, as Hall has shown, from curvilinear elements, not inspired by nature (E. Hall, "Early Painted Pottery from Gournia, Crete," UPMTA I, iii, 1905 [pp. 191- 205], pp. 201-202, pl. XXXIII:7 and The Decora- tive Art of Crete in the Bronze Age, Philadelphia 1907, pp. 9-10; Zois, Kamares-Stil, p. 132). It is probably indicative of further development that the apexes of the MM I triangular spirals are filled, un- like those of the EM III spirals. For their develop- ment in the Kamares style, see Walberg, Kamares, p. 49. The quirks of the lower frieze, closely related to S-motifs, are also an EM III creation, as Zois has pointed out (Kamares-Stil, pp. 128-129, 211). In the Kamares style, however, they appear to be used, as they are here, in a more standardized fashion as vertical elements in horizontal bands. Compare those on the MM Ib jug from Agia Photia (Hawes, Gour- nia, p. 60, pl. A:2) and on the MM Ib tumbler from Gournia (Hawes, Gournia, p. 38, pl.

Lower zone of incised chevrons around cen- ter of vase, separated from zone above by incised horizontal line. For the fabric and shape, see Wilson, BSA 80, 1985, pp. 304-307. The vase type tends to be globular or flattened globular with a short collar neck. Exam- ples on pedestal stems are scarce, but compare Her.Mus. 3781 from Sphoungaras Rock Shelter I (Hawes, Gournia, p. 56, fig. 37:9) and Her.Mus. 4192, 4193, 4194 from Koumasa (Xanthoudides, VTM, pp. 9, 34-35, pls. I, XVIII, XXV). The ped- estal stems that Wilson believes to have belonged to "goblets" are also very similar (Wilson, BSA 80, 1985, p. 305, P81-84). For the decoration, compare Pendlebury, Archaeology of Crete, p. 48, fig. 4:1; Zervos, L'art de la Crete, pl. 124, from Marathoke- phalo; and Hawes, Gournia, p. 60, pl. A:5 from Gournia Rock Shelter V. Once believed to be EM I, such pyxides are char- acteristic of the EM IIa phase. The vases are rare in northern and eastern Crete, and Wilson has suggest- ed a center of production in the Mesara, where the largest number has been reported (including some 25 examples from the Lebena tombs). Eight are now known from Gournia. G 1-15 (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4402). Fruitstand Fig. 5, PI. 5 Complete except for a few restored pieces around the rim. H. 0.086 m.; D. at rim 0.202 m.

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION The identification, location, and excavation of this tomb and Tomb I are discussed on pp. 3-4 above. ARCHITECTURE (Pis. 2, 7, and 8) Tomb II is a two-room structure, approximately five meters square on the outside, with a doorway at its northwest. It lies alongside Tomb I, separated from it by a narrow corridor 1.02-1.26 m. wide. Its walls are oriented in approximately the same direction as those of Tomb I, and the two tombs appear to have been constructed together as a pair. Unlike Tomb I, however, Tomb II is built directly on the natural bedrock of the slope, with its west wall lying at a higher elevation than its east wall, and the north and south walls sloping downwards at their bases from west to east (Fig. 3). The walls are constructed in ordinary rubble fashion with inner and outer facings of stones, collected from the local outcroppings of gray limestone, which have been set in earth mortar in uneven courses, usually with smaller stones between. The upper, west wall is the most poorly preserved. It is never more than one or two courses high on the inside and has lost many of the stones from its outer, west face.22 During the 1971 cleaning, a line of fallen stones, ca. 0.50-0.80 m. wide, was found lying parallel and adjacent to this wall in the room immediately below it, and it is likely that the stones in this line had fallen from the wall as it was originally excavated by Hawes. The wall was constructed in two parts, on either side of a large, flat stone that crosses it near its south end. The longer stretch of wall, extending ca. 3.40 m. northward from this stone, is set somewhat to the east of the shorter southern stretch, and the setback at this point, ca. 0.30 m. deep, was probably carried up into the mud-brick superstructure of the wall. At its north end the wall is widened to ca. 0.76 m. to form the base for the western jamb of the doorway located at this corner of the tomb. The shorter, southern stretch of this wall is somewhat wider than the northern section and continues its direction for ca. 1.50 m. (including the length of the large stone) until curving around into the south wall of the tomb. The curvature of the wall at this 22 West wall: L. ca. 4.90 m.; W. at north ca. 0.48 m., at south ca. 0.66 m.; H. on inside ca. 0.51 m. 17</page><page sequence="38">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA point is continuous;23 there is no break and no right angle at the southwest corner of the tomb. The break, as noted, comes farther back in the west wall. Such rounded corners are not uncommon in the architecture of the period. Examples may be cited from contemporary walls at Knossos and Chamaizi, and Pendlebury has suggested that, as in Mesopotamia where such corners are frequently found at street intersections, they may have been de- signed to prevent people or animals from knocking against a sharp corner and damaging the mud-brick wall.24 The south wall, the rear wall of the tomb, is better preserved than its extension to the west.25 Its western half is constructed of a single course of stones laid, like those of the western wall, directly on bedrock with a minimum of earth bedding; its eastern, and lower, half is constructed of two courses of stones set on a bedding of earth and small stones 0.10-0.20 m. thick. The result is that, although the ground slopes down beneath the wall, its upper level lies on a fairly horizontal plane and so provided a level bedding for a mud-brick superstructure. Midway, the outer face of the wall is broken by another setback, ca. 0.26 m. deep, which, coming exactly at the point where the interior spur wall divides the tomb into two rooms, reflects externally the internal arrangement. In many Prepalatial and Protopa- latial walls, such setbacks often appear to have a structural origin, but they also serve a decorative function. The corridor that this wall flanks probably served as the major ap- proach to the entrance of the tomb, since access from the north is blocked by large boulders and steep terrain; this function as a corridor of approach may explain the peculiar features of the south and west walls of the tomb. The two setbacks that originate in structural peculiarities also break the monotony of the solid walls and make them me tm ore attractive to the approaching pedestrian. The rounded southwest corner emphasizes the nature of this space as a corridor of approach and facilitates movement towards the entrance of the tomb. The north wall of the tomb served no such grandiose functions.26 It is constructed of two courses of stones set on a deep bedding of earth and stones, ca. 0.20 m. thick at the upper, west end and ca. 0.34 m. thick at the lower, east end. The result of this method of con- struction is to achieve the required horizontal level of the upper surface of the wall without resorting to the stepped masonry that was apparently used in the north and south walls of Tomb I. At its east end, where it reaches its maximum preserved height, the wall is termi- nated by a boulder that fills the northeast corner of the tomb and buttresses it at this point. On its outer, north side the wall is bounded by an outcropping of two large boulders, and the space between these and the wall is filled with a loose packing of earth, small stones, and sherds. Both boulders and packing act to buttress the wall socle along its entire length, and it is possible that loose rubble resting on the earth packing outside the wall was also used to support the superstructure of the wall. At the same time the western boulder is responsible for the angular orientation of the wall, since it juts in towards the tomb and so forces the western end of the wall to be built out of line with the eastern. 23 Soles, AJA 83, 1979, fig. 14, pi. 21. 24 Evans, PM I, p. 139, figs. 96, 102; C.

It employs larger stones in its facings and contains a large amount of fill in its center with the result that in places it is twice as wide as the other walls.27 It consists of two courses of stones, set on a thick bedding of earth and stones that rises ca. 0.25 m. above bedrock on the inside of the tomb and ca. 0.48 m. on the outside where the bedrock slopes farther downwards. As a result, the upper surface of thiss wall is roughly level with the adjacent upper surfaces of the north and south side walls, and this height must represent the original height of the stone socles on the eastern side. On its outer side the east wall is but- tressed by several boulders, the southernmost placed against the wall itself and the three to the north against the lower bedding of the wall.28 These rest on the same bedding of small stones and earth as the wall itself, not on bedrock. At its north end the wall is terminated by the boulder that forms the northeast corner of the tomb; at its south it projects ca. 0.39 m. beyond the south side wall. Here at the outer southeast corner of the tomb there appears to be a low staircase of three steps that leads from ground level up to the top of the wall (Fig. 3, P1. 8:a). On their southern, outer side the steps are neatly faced with large stones, and at their north they adjoin the boulder buttressing the wall. The risers are carefully edged with rows of stones set against a fill of earth and small and there is no indication of another doorway, these steps may simply form a stepped buttress comparable to the boulders that buttress the outside of the wall to the north. On the other hand, the brick superstructure probably did not fill the whole width of the wall socle at this corner of the tomb, and the steps may have provided access to a narrow ledge that ran along the outer edge of the east wall and, more important, around the southeast corner of the tomb. At this point, immediately on the other side of the southeast corner, two boulders project from the south wall (Pls. 7:b and 8:b). These are not natural rock outcroppings. They are set against each other and have been faced on the west, where a gap occurs be- tween them, with a narrow wall of stones, three courses high, set in earth mortar. The southern boulder rests on bedrock on uretits west side but is raised on earth fill at its east so that it forms a level surface on top. The other boulder, less securely bedded, has tilted down- wards on one side so that its upper surface now lies at an angle. When originally placed, however, it was probably also level on top. The two boulders form a low platform that was intentionally added onto this outer corner of the tomb.30 On the basis of its appearance alone, the platform should probably be identified as an altar. It is similar to altars found outside other tombs but especially to the contemporary rock-built altar found outside the northeast corner of the tholos tomb at Apesokari, the identity of which is securely based on the associated finds.31 Like the Gournia structure this altar is formed from a boulder, though only one instead of two, with an outer facing of stones on one side. It is reported to 27 East wall: L. ca. 4.72 m.; W. 0.70-1.092 m.; H. on inside ca. 0.58 m., on outside ca. 0.85 m. 28 Soles, AJA 83, 1979, fig. 9, pl. 20. 29 Steps: L. of lower step ca. 1 m., depth 0.32-0.46 m., H. ca. 0.23 m.; L. of middle step ca. 1.10 m., depth 0.36-0.40 m., H. ca. 0.22 m.; H. of upper step ca. 0.15 m. 30 Platform: L. north-south ca. 0.96 m.; W. east-west ca. 0.98 m.; H. on west ca. 0.40 m., on east ca. 0.76 m. 31 Schorgendorfer, Forschungen auf Kreta, pp. 20-22, pl. 16:L; for a discussion of tomb altars, see pp. 219-223 below. 19</page><page sequence="40">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA measure ca. 0.80 by 0.90 m. and so is also similar in size. A parallel for steps leading up to an altar may be found in the somewhat earlier altar in front of Tomb Complex IV/V/VI at Mochlos, which would still have been in use at the time the Gournia altar was built.32 The identification of this appendage to the tomb as an altar appears to be confirmed by the stone kernos discovered during the 1971 cleaning just below these boulders to the south (PI. 8:c). It consists of a flattish, pentagonal stone of gray-blue sideropetra, the top of which has been polished to create a smooth, flat surface. This surface is marked with a ring of 22 small hollows that follow the edges of the stone. Each hollow is a simple mark on the stone without any real depth and appears to have been created by the blow of a hammer-stone. One hollow in the northwest corner is slightly larger than the rest and was apparently created by a double or triple blow.33 Although the surface of the stone was partially exposed at the time of the 1971 cleaning, there is no doubt that the stone was in situ. When the earth was cleared from around its base, sherds belonging to an artificial packing were found tucked under its edges. These included (against its west side) almost the whole lower half of one conical cup (G 11-5). Because of its position at the end of the projecting pier of stones, the kernos should be thought of as pat of a single architectural complex. Together the kernos and stone platform belong to a distinct class of cult structures that consists of raised altar and juxtaposed offering table, a class commonly found in Minoan architecture in many different periods. Examples from tombs are less common, but two may be cited from the MM Ia and MM Ib/II tombs at Chrysolakkos.34 Situated between Tombs I and II, at the entrance to the corridor of approach, this structure provided a focal point for the two tombs and a center of devotional activity. The entrance to the tomb, located at the northwest corner of the building, is formed by an opening ca. 0.51 m. wide between the west and north walls. The widening of the north end of the west wall to serve as a jamb for this doorway suggests that a door may once have closed the opening. During the 1971 cleaning, a flat, rounded stone with a small depression near its center was found just north of the doorway, no longer in situ. It may have served as a pivot stone for a wooden door; if it had been placed against the end of the north wall, the door would have closed firmly against the jamb of the west wall. In the space between the two walls in front of this doorway, a hard bedding of stone chips and earth, ca. 0.10-0.15 m. deep, served as a threshold. The doorway provides access to the western room of the tomb (PI. 8:d). It is a rec- tangular space of irregular dimensions, ca. 3.10 m. long at the east, ca. 3.68 m. long at the 32 For other stepped structures, attached to altars or used as altars themselves, compare the altar steps at Mochlos Tomb Complex IV/V/VI (pp. 56-57 below), the contemporary stepped altar at Juktas (Karetsou, IpaKTLKa 1974, p. 233), and the later examples from the East Court at Nirou Chani, the northwest corner of the Central Court at Phaistos, and in the painted scene on the Agia Triada sarcophagus (S. Xanthoudides, &lt;MtyriOKvMy pUfyapov Nipov&gt;, 'ApX'E 1922 [pp. 1-25], pp. 2-4, figs.

Sakellarakis, &lt;'AvaaKa i6, 'ApXavWiv&gt;, HpaKTiKa 1979 [pp. 331-392], p. 375). 33 Dimensions of kernos: ca. 0.43 by 0.36 by 0.15 m.; D. of hollows ca. 0.025 m., of large hollow ca. 0.045 m.

It is bounded on the east by a spur wall consisting of two courses of stones set on a bedding of earth and small stones ca. 0.20-0.30 m. thick. This wall does not bond with the south wall and runs at a slight angle to the west wall, accounting for the irregular width of the room.35 It ends before reaching the north wall of the tomb, leaving a space ca. 0.64 m. wide which forms the doorway leading into the adjacent, eastern room. No attempt was made to cut into the nat- ural bedrock of the slope within the tomb, and as a result the natural rock floor of the western room, which is considerably higher than that of the eastern room, slopes down sharply from west to east, with the highest point in the southwest corner lying ca. 0.67 m. above the lowest point in the northeast corner, before the interior doorway. The thick bedding on which the spur wall rests at this point, however, as well as the bedding on which the north wall rests, suggests that an artificial earth floor was raised above the natural bedrock along the east side of the room in order to provide a more level footing. The finds made along this wall during the 1971 cleaning lay at this artificial floor level, ca. 0.20 m. above bedrock. The eastern room of the tomb, entered from the doorway at the north end of the spur wall, consists of a rectangular space somewhat larger than the western room, measuring ca. 1.70 by ca. 3.30 m., also irregular. The natural bedrock floor is not so uneven as in the western room, sloping downwards from the southwest corner to the northeast for a maxi- mum difference of only ca. 0.50 m., but here too it is likely that an artificial earth floor was raised somewhat above the natural bedrock, perhaps to a height approaching the top of the earth bedding of the walls. The northeast corner of the room is filled with a large stone set at an angle across the corner with a backing of earth and small stones. It forms a small tri- angular step rising ca. 0.18 m. above the bedrock floor, and it seems likely that the artificial level of the floor lay at this height along the eastern side of the room. Another small deposit of finds was uncovered at approximately this level along the eastern wall of the room during the 1971 cleaning. BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY (P1. 9) From the original excavation in the tomb, Hawes reported "masses of broken bones and skulls, in such poor condition that only one skull ... could be saved."36 In her Notebook for July, 1904, she reported a "broken casella". She published twelve finds from the tomb: a MM I clay cup (Her.Mus. 3623), four stone vases (Her.Mus. 551, 554-556), and three pairs of bronze tweezers, all from Room 1; three more stone vases from Room 2 (G 1-12, Philadelphia, G II-14); and a stone seal (G II-17) which was found outside the tomb in earth thought to have been thrown from the tomb. She did not record which was Room 1 and which Room 2, the eastern or the western room. In addition, she uncovered an un- specified quantity of pottery which she described as "a true Kamares deposit, of exactly the same character as that described by Dr. Mackenzie, 'Pottery of Knossos,' J.H.S. XXIII, 1903, p. 180 ff."37 This comparison has led to some confusion, however, since the deposit 35 Partition wall: L. ca. 2.53 m.; W. 0.46-0.50 m.; H. ca. 0.45 m. 36 Hawes, UPMTA I, iii, 1905, p. 187. 37 Hawes, UPMTA I, iii, 1905, p. 188. 21</page><page sequence="42">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA described by Mackenzie, found immediately beneath the palace floors in the area of the Room of the Olive Press, cannot be considered a "true Kamares deposit". It was found superimposed above floor deposits of the finest polychrome ware and did not contain any examples of such ware itself. Mackenzie later dated the deposit to MM III.38 The deposit that Hawes found appears to be earlier in date, since it included what she described as numerous cups of metallic shape of great "delicacy", Kamares fragments decorated with white spirals and ferns, and specimens of dark-on-light decoration in "proto-Gournia style".39 In her Notebook for July, 1904, Hawes described nine of the vases from this deposit, noting that one came from Room 1 and eight from Room 2, and provided sketches of each. While these vases cannot be located today and the information she provided is not sufficient to date all nine vases with certainty, a few may be dated tentatively. Two, which she described as "Kamares shaped cups" with white on black decoration (Notebook Entry No. 4), are clearly MM I; a third, described simply as "a Mycenaean cup with handle" (Notebook Entry No. 5), and a fourth, described as "a double curved Mycenaean cup" (Notebook Entry No. 7), appear to be MM I shapes; four others, described as "charac- teristic handleless Mycenaean cups with straight sides" (Notebook Entry No. 6), resemble the MM I conical cups found in the 1971 cleaning; and another, described as "a low cup with spreading flat rim" (Notebook Entry No. 8), might be of any date.40 During the 1971 cleaning further finds were made, some of which help to clarify the date of the tomb. In the western room the remains of a skull were uncovered lying midway along the central spur wall at the level of the earth floor. The skull was badly crushed and incompletely preserved, but it included the entire mandible as well as large parts of the cranium and both orbits; it probably belonged to an adult male. Imbedded in the remains of this skull were parts of four conical cups, two of which were nearly complete and found lying on their sides (G 11-2 as nd 3; P. 9:a). Wheelmade, with tin walls and undecorated, they belong to the MM Ib pottery phase and provide good parallels for the four handleless "Mycenaean" cups Hawes reported. In the eastern room a small deposit of skull fragments was uncovered midway along the eastern wall, again lying at the level of the earth floor in the room. It consisted of fragments of crania, none complete, belonging to at least three different skulls. On the opposite side of the room against the spur wall, another small deposit was uncovered just above the bedrock (P. 9:b).9 It contained, from south to north, fragments of a fruitstand (G 11-8), two MM Ia jugs, both handmade and decorated in the dark-on-light style which Hawes characterized as "proto-Gournia" (G II-6 and 7), with a pithos fragment between, and, just inside the interior doorway, the pedestal of a clay vase (G 11-9). Outside the tomb, in addition to the fragment of a conical cup by the kernos and various sherds from the fill beneath the east wall, a stone amulet in the shape of a quad- ruped (G II-16) was found by the southeast corner. 38 D.

First, the discovery of skull frag- ments in both rooms suggests that, as in other tombs of this type, including Tomb I,41 the skulls from previous burials were purposefully saved at the time of periodic cleanings of the tomb and were set to one side to make room for new burials. During the 1971 cleaning, pithos and larnax fragments were found scattered throughout the earth fill in the tomb but without significant joins. Like the broken "casella" reported by Hawes, however, they probably be- long to the original tomb contents and indicate that some burials, or some secondary skull deposits, were made in pithoi and larnakes. During the 1971 cleaning no pottery was found in the tomb that could not be dated to MM I pottery phases. This pottery includes a number of sherds which, being extremely fragmentary and showing no significant joins, may belong to modern (i.e., post-1904) fill and are therefore not catalogued. It also includes the vases from previously unexcavated deposits, however, and these provide several good parallels for the pottery that Hawes reported but did not publish. Finally, several sherds of EM III and MM Ia date were extracted from beneath the east wall of the tomb in 1971. These, together with the earliest pottery found inside the tomb, fix the date of construction at the very begin- ning of the MM I phase. Like Tomb I, the tomb appears to have been used into the Old Palace period, when MM Ib pottery was in use, but not to have been used any later. CATALOGUE VESSELS Pottery G II-1 (Her.Mus. 3623).

Zois, "Epevva, p. 722, pl. 8:4137). The band of solid paint around the base is common on MM Ia jugs, and the decoration with vertical lines, although unique (and the work of a less orderly mind), has something in common with the decora- tion on several MM Ia jugs from Gournes: compare Her.Mus. 7035, 7042, 7067 (Zois, FpoSXA7),lara, pp. 7, 18, 20, pls. 5, 16).

Round loop handle from neck to shoulder. Traces of trickle decoration on front of neck and on interior of vase; dot below lip. There does not seem to be an exact parallel for the shape. Compare a similar jug from Zakros, in a MM Ia deposit, with globular body, cylindrical neck, and trefoil mouth (Platon, IlpaCKTKa 1967, pl. 173:y). As trefoil mouths are not found before the MM Ia phase and the Gournia vase is handmade, it should probably also be dated MM Ia. For the at- tachment of the neck to the body, compare the MM Ia jugs from Tylissos (J. Hazzidakis, Les villas mi- noennes de Tylissos [Etudes cretoises III], Paris 1921, pp. 80-81, pl.

They were identified as fruitstands by Seager and Evans (Mochlos II, pp. 18, 20, 71; PM I, p. 75); whatever they held, they were clearly stands of some sort, as the hollow pedestals and the signs of wear on the in- terior of G 1-15 indicate.

TOMB III (Figs. 11 and 12) Davaras, AeAr 28, 1973, p. 588; Davaras, 'ApaXdheLa 5, 1974. LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Tomb III is the highest of the built tombs on the east slope of the north spur. It lies directly above Tomb I at the very foot of the limestone outcropping that rises sharply at the top of the spur and runs along its center. It was excavated for the first time in 1972 by the Greek Archaeological Service under the supervision of Costis Davaras. ARCHITECTURE (P1. 12) The builders of the tomb took advantage of the steep eastern face of the outcropping located here at the top of the spur and used it to form the western side of the structure, running the interior walls out at right angles from the rock face towards the east. The result is an oblong building, oriented approximately north-south, that consists of four rooms, each of which backs against the outcropping on the west, and that measures ca. 6.60 m. in over- all length. The eastern side of the tomb is not preserved, and as a result the original appear- ance of the tomb is unclear. An exterior wall may have run along this side of the building in a north-south direction. It has left no trace but, being located on the lower side of the hill, could have washed away, and several large stones found to the east, including those that now rest against the western wall of Tomb I and others found inside the tomb during cleaning, may have belonged to this vanished wall. On the other hand, it is equally possible that the tomb never possessed an eastern wall and that each of its rooms, closed only on three sides, remained open to the east. In this case, the stones found below to the east may have belonged to the interior east-west walls of the tomb. The four east-west walls to the north appear to have formed the original core of the building. They are parallel and approximately equidistant. Each rests on bedrock and is constructed in ordinary rubble fashion with inner and outer faces of stone set in earth mor- tar and laid in irregular courses. The northern is the best preserved and perhaps suggests the original length and state of the others. It is built into a slight recess in the cliff face on the west, which gives it additional stability, and is preserved here to a height of three courses, its maximum preserved height of ca. 0.78 m. It extends ca. 3.28 m. eastward before breaking off. The three walls to the south are incomplete, but each could have extended from the rock face at least as far as the northernmost wall, since there is ample room for them to have done 28</page><page sequence="49">TOMB III F 35,68 " 33.50 Im 31BO I 33.47 35(5 0 2 3M FIG. 11.

Section EF through Gournia Tombs I and III Any of three possible entrances might have been used to gain access to the interior of the tomb. If there was an eastern wall, one might have entered by a doorway in it and passed through a corridor running along the east side of the tomb. In the absence of such a doorway, one might have entered from the roof, which could be reached easily from the steep outcropping that rises alongside the west side of the tomb. Each room could, of course, have been entered directly from the east. All three northern rooms, Rooms 1-3, are rec- tangular, ca. 1.30 m. wide and, as suggested, something over three meters deep; each has a bedrock floor that slopes gently upwards to the west. The western walls of these rooms are of some interest. In Rooms 1 and 3 they are formed entirely by the rock face of the out- cropping that rises vertically ca. 2.10 m. above the floors. In Room 2, however, where there is a break in the horizontal line and the vertical face of the rock outcropping, the west wall is partially built in rubble to provide a higher walling and a smooth face (PI. 12:b). Five irreg- ular courses built into the north half of the uneven rock face are preserved, reaching a height of ca. 0.96 m. above floor level. These courses would have needed to extend originally some- what higher in order to fill the gap in the cliff and provide an even horizontal line for the roof support running along this side of the tomb. After constructing Rooms 1-3, the builders apparently took advantage of a natural indentation in the rock face of the bedrock outcropping to the south to add a fourth room to the tomb. From 1 to 1.50 m. south of Room 3, where the outcropping projects towards the east, the builders added a small extension to the projection in order to create an additional room. The south wall of this room is thus formed partly by the smooth vertical face of the projecting rock and partly by the built wall, which, as preserved, is only one course high.43 It runs at an angle to the wall to the north, narrowing the entry to the room, and appears to be complete in length. At its outer east end, it is widened slightly to form a jamb flanking the 43 Built section of south wall: L. ca. 1.10 m.; W. 0.44-0.52 m.; H. ca. 0.20 m. 30</page><page sequence="51">TOMB III entry. The space between the two built walls at the northeast corner of the room formed the entrance, ca. 0.60 m. wide; the jamb at one side suggests that it may have been provided with a door. It gives access to an irregular, almost triangular space, ca. 2.30 m. deep and ca. 1.50 m. wide on the inner west side. As in the rooms to the north, the inner west wall is formed by the vertical face of the rock outcropping, which rises here to a height of ca. 1.80 m. Where the rock face is irregular, small stones are set in an earth mortar to fill the gaps and provide a smooth walling. In the southwest corner of the room, where the out- cropping curves towards the east, there is a small nook which extends beneath the rock outcropping. Shallow and only ca. 0.30 m. high, it nevertheless suggests the resemblance between this chamber and certain rock shelters, which are often extended outwards by the addition of built walls. BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY Four deposits are reported from the tomb, one from each room. Each contained scattered skeletal material and pottery and was located in the inner, western part of the room. The re- mains in the outer, eastern part were presumably washed away with the walls on this side. The most extensive remains are reported to have been located in the northwest part of the tomb, in Room 1. A published illustration shows the remains as they were found in Room 3.44 Some 16 skulls in all were discovered in the tomb. Unfortunately, the poor state of preserva- tion of the structure means that they cannot represent the total number of skulls once stored in it. It is more than likely, however, that the eight skulls found in the pit in Tomb I immediately below originally belonged to burials in this tomb. The pottery from the pit is contemporary with the pottery from Tomb III, belonging in each case to the EM IIa phase, and also similar in type. When Tomb I was constructed some 600 years after Tomb III, these skulls and their accompanying grave goods were perhaps exposed among the remains of the then collapsed and destroyed Tomb III. As a result, the pit was dug in Tomb I in order to rebury the skulls, and at the same time the MM I stone vases were proffered. CATALOGUE45 VESSELS G III-1 (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4395).

On the other hand, Hawes found an identical gold sheathing in Tomb VII (Her.Mus. 110) which she identified as a tip "presumably from some wand of office." See p. 40 below. BUILDING IV (Fig. 14) LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Building IV is the southernmost of the buildings excavated on the east slope of the spur. It lies about 6.40 m. to the south of Tomb I on the same line as this tomb and Tomb II. It was excavated at the same time as Tomb III in 1972 by the Greek Archaeological Service under the supervision of Costis Davaras. ARCHITECTURE (PI. 15:a) The building is a simple one-room structure that was originally nearly square. Most of the south side of the building is destroyed, and only the north side is completely preserved. This side is ca. 3.92 m. long, and the other sides appear to have been approximately the same length. The walls of the building rest on bedrock and are constructed in ordinary rubble set in earth mortar. They are only one course high but are peculiar in that they are especially strengthened at key points by large stones and appear wider and stronger than such a small building would need. The west wall of the tomb is as much as 1.50 m. wide. It is faced with large stones along the lower, inner side and filled out with smaller stones on the higher, outer side. As a result, the upper surface of the wall forms a level bedding that is 34</page><page sequence="55">BUILDING IV 0 I 2M FIG. 14. Plan of Gournia Building IV nearly equal in height to the other walls, and it is doubtful that this wall or the others in the building were ever constructed any higher in stone. The east wall of the building ends at the north with a single boulder that forms the northeast corner of the building, and in this respect it recalls the construction of the northeast corner of Tomb II. Like the east wall of Tomb II, it too lies on the lower side of the slope and is therefore constructed with especially large stones.46 The north wall, also constructed of fairly large stones, does not bond with the east and west walls; it simply runs between them, closing the side. Only one stone of the south wall is preserved, and if an entrance to the building was located at ground level, it may have been somewhere along this side. Of course, as in the case of Tomb I, the entrance may have been higher, at the level of the stone socles or through a trap door in the roof. The entrance would have provided access to a small room ca. 1.75 by 2.20 m. in size. The bedrock floor of the room slopes upwards somewhat from southeast to northwest. FUNCTION AND CHRONOLOGY No finds, either skeletal or ceramic, were uncovered in the building, and its function in the cemetery and its date therefore remain unclear. There are several possibilities. The most 46 West wall: L. ca. 3.65 m.; W. 1.10-1.50 m.; H. on the inside ca. 0.70 m. East wall: p.L. ca. 2.58 m.; W. ca. 0.76 m.; H. on the inside ca. 0.68 m. 35</page><page sequence="56">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA likely, that the building also served as a tomb and that its contents simply washed out when the lower southeast corner was destroyed, is suggested by its location within the cemetery. On the other hand, the building is unusual in that it is constructed with exceptionally wide socles that would have been capable of supporting two stories of mud brick. It may well have been two stories high and, situated near the southeast limits of the cemetery, may have served as some sort of watchtower over the cemetery. No parallel for such a building is known, however. It may also have served some religious function, either as a repository for ritual equipment used in the cemetery cult or votives deposited in the cemetery, or as a shrine itself. Several parallels may be found for such a structure.47 The details of the construction, similar to those of Tomb II, and the location of the building on the same line of the slope as Tombs I and II, rather than near the top with Tomb III and the Rock Shelters, suggest that Building IV probably dates to the same period as these tombs (MM I). ROCK SHELTERS V AND VI (Fig. 15) Hawes, UPMTA I, iii, 1905, pp. 182-183; Hawes, Gournia, p. 56. LOCATION AND EXCAVATION In 1904 Hawes discovered burials in two rock shelters located on the eastern side of the spur immediately to the northwest of Tomb II. Shelter V, situated "below a dense grove of carob trees," is the more southern of the two, lying about four meters north of Tomb II. Shelter VI, located "in the same line of rock," lies about three meters northwest of Shelter V. The slope of the spur is steep and rocky here, and it is likely that it accommodated similar burial shelters in still other rocky nooks lying farther to the northwest, around the side of the spur. DESCRIPTION (P1. 15:b and c) Both shelters are natural rock formations. Shelter V is a triangular opening in the rocks formed by the overlapping of three boulders. The height of the opening is ca. 0.65 m. and the width at its base, ca. 0.80 m. The depth of the shelter is one meter at the most. Shelter VI is formed in the same way and is somewhat larger. Part of its rock face appears to have fallen away, however, and it is no longer possible to ascertain the original height of its opening. Its width at the base is ca. 1.40 m., and the approximate depth of the shelter is 1.80 m. The floors of both shelters are rocky. The floor of Shelter VI is relatively level, but that of V slopes upwards from front to rear so sharply that it would seem some sort of bar- rier would have to have been constructed at its opening to prevent burials and grave goods from rolling out. 47 Compare the contemporary structures at Gournes and Agia Triada (Hazzidakis, AeXT 1, 1915, pp. 59-63; Stefani, ASAtene 13-14, 1930-1931, pp. 152-154) and see the discussion below, pp. 240-241. 36</page><page sequence="57">ROCK SHELTERS V AND VI B O I 2 3M. -- B B FIG. 15.

The pottery includes a dark-on-light painted jug (G V-l), perhaps imported from Knossos, as well as a fruitstand from Shelter V and two small pyxides, one of them of light-gray burnished ware (G VI-3), from Shelter VI.

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION These tombs were uncovered on the first day of Hawes's excavation at Gournia, May 14, 1901. They were located on the west side of the spur "close in upon the rocks" and are now destroyed. It is apparently the more southern of these tombs, however, Tomb VII, to which Hall referred in her publication of the EM III pottery from the North Trench.50 She described it as "a house containing burials" and located it 7.35 m. northeast of the northeast limits of the North Trench. At the same time she provided a map of the North Trench showing its relationship to Wall X-X' and to House Ea at the northwest border of the set- tlement and giving its approximate dimensions. As a result, even though no traces of the North Trench or the tomb remain, it is possible to locate Tomb VII about 25 meters to the northeast of the northeast corner of House Ea, Room 1, which is still preserved. The apo- theke, which is now located on the west side of the spur close in upon the rocks, and its modern terrace lie approximately this distance from the north Trench, and it is likely that the tombs, which were poorly preserved, were destroyed in the 1960's during the building of the apotheke. Their approximate location is suggested on the plan of the Cemetery, Plan 2, beneath the modern terrace of the apotheke, and they are restored in hatched lines. Tomb VIII is reported by Hawes to have been located seven meters to the north of Tomb VII. It is likely that still more tombs lay in this area, perhaps still farther to the north, and were also destroyed in the 1960's when the apotheke was constructed.51 ARCHITECTURE Hawes initially mistook these tombs for ordinary houses and described the burials as intramural burials. It seems to have been only after her excavation of Tombs I and II that she realized that they were tombs and then introduced the term "house tomb" to describe them.52 Other than her general definition of a house tomb, she published no architectural description of the tombs. As a result of the discovery of her Notebook for July 1904, how- ever, it has been possible to gain further information about the tombs and their finds. Tomb VII, for which Hawes provided a sketch in the Notebook, reproduced here in the plan (Plan 2), was a rectangular building measuring ca. 4 by 5.70 m. on the outside, with its longer walls running approximately east-west. The walls were built in ordinary rubble and preserved to a maximum height of 0.30 m. No doorways are indicated in the external walls, and it may be that, as suggested for Tomb I, entry was from the roof or from a doorway placed above ground level. On the inside the tomb was divided into two rooms of almost equal size by a partition wall that ran parallel to the shorter walls and that appears from 50 E. Hall, "Early Painted Pottery from Gournia, Crete," UPMTA I, iii, 1905 (pp. 191-205), pp. 192-193, fig. 1. 51 As reported by Markos Peronikolis, Custodian of Gournia, who was present during the construction of the apotheke. 52 As late as 1905, however, Hall continued to describe them as "house burials" and Tomb VII as "a house containing burials", which suggests some lingering doubt among the staff. 39</page><page sequence="60">THE NORTH CEMETERY AT GOURNIA Hawes's sketch to have broken off at each end without joining the outer walls, the passages thus left open providing access from one room to the other. Tomb VIII is described only as "a similar enclosure". BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY Hawes reported that both tombs were badly denuded and and that only 0.15 m. of fill remained. In her Notebook she reported that bones were scattered throughout Tomb VII but were concentrated in the southwest and southeast corners. "Scattered throughout Room [a, the eastern room] were pieces of casella, legs of tripod cooking-vessels and other coarse sherds. With the bones in the southeast corner lay a bronze knife." The bottom of a larnax, 0.95 m. long as preserved, was also located in the southeast corner. "In Room [b] stood an- other casella, badly broken [in the northwest corner of the room]; its length appears to have been about 1.10 m., its width 52 cm.; 11 cm. is its greatest height today. As a handle was found in one corner, it is safe to suppose that the casella was originally furnished with four handles, one at each corner. In the casella, together with bones, was a second bronze knife." Other finds noted from this room include a third bronze dagger and a sheathing of gold sheet metal that she described as a thumb-sized tip of beaten gold "presumably for some wand of office."53 Tomb VIII also contained the remains of scattered bones and the fragments of two more larnakes. These fragments were "decorated in black-on-buff in Kamares style, proto- Gournia, with a band around the bottom and a broad free vertical stripe." Hawes did not describe the pottery from either tomb, and it is apparently on the basis of these painted larnax fragments that she assigned an MM I date to the tombs. 53 This is apparently the same gold "wand of office" that is mentioned again in Hawes (Gournia, Her.Mus. 110, p. 33, fig. 12), although it is described there as belonging to a Late Minoan tomb. 40</page><page sequence="61">II THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY The Mochlos Cemetery is one of the largest and most important of the Prepalatial ceme- teries in eastern Crete; it contains more built tombs than any other single cemetery in Crete, of any period, and has produced a wide variety of rich finds that have provided much infor- mation about the Prepalatial period of Minoan civilization. The cemetery was excavated in 1908 by Richard Seager, who uncovered over 20 built tombs on the island of Mochlos, as well as a number of pithos burials, rock shelters, and simple pit graves. The tombs he excavated are located in two different areas on the western side of the island (Plan 3): the larger, monumental tombs on a narrow terrace running along the west face of the island, apparently reserved for a ruling elite, and smaller, more numerous tombs and pithos burials on the adjacent South Slope, which was used by the population at large. Most of the built tombs were constructed at the beginning of the EM II phase and continued in use in the EM III phase; fewer appear to have been used in the MM Ia phase. After a considerable gap some were re-used in the Neopalatial period, and it was at this time that the pithos burials were made. In 1912 Seager published his discoveries in his Explorations in the Island of Mochlos, a book that remains an important source for modern research. In it Seager concentrates on the small finds, as well he might, since they include some of the most spectacular objects from anywhere in Early Bronze Age Crete, but he neglects the archi- tecture of the tombs. His description of them is minimal and often confusing. In order to supplement Seager's brief descriptions, with the objective of drawing detailed plans of the individual tombs and a map of the entire island, showing the relationship between the tombs and the area of settlement, and so to provide a clear context for the finds that Seager pub- lished, cleaning operations were begun on the island in the summer of 1971.1 At that time 13 tombs were cleaned and studied, and the remaining tombs excavated by Seager were located. In the summer of 1972 the large tombs (I/II/III and IV/V/VI) on the western terrace of the island were consolidated with cement by the Greek Archaeological Service, and at the same time two more tombs on the South Slope were cleaned.2 It was then possible to identify many of the tombs with those that Seager numbered in his publication, but because of Seager's meager, often nonexistent descriptions, it was still not possible to iden- tify all those on the South Slope or to obtain a complete picture of this part of the cemetery. To do this it was necessary to clean the entire area of the South Slope, and in the summer of 1976 the Greek Archaeological Service, under the direction of Costis Davaras, carried out this task, cleaning 13 additional tombs. These were studied the same summer, and at the same time it was possible to complete a topographical map of the island, providing an over- all plan of the cemetery area (Plan 3) and also showing the relationship of the different archaeological remains on the island.3 I These activities were carried out by the author under the supervision of the Greek Archaeological Service and with the assistance of Iannis Kouroupakis, Custodian of Antiquities at Mochlos. 2 Davaras, AcAr 27, 1972, p. 654, pls. a, ,3. 3 Davaras, AcAr 31, 1976, pp. 376-378; Soles, Expedition 20, 1978, pp. 4-15, fig. 3 for a map of the island of Mochlos.</page><page sequence="62">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY As a result of these efforts, it has been possible to revise much of Seager's description and to gain much additional information about the cemetery. To begin with, Seager's basic definition of the different types of graves in the early cemetery should be revised. He identi- fied four types.4 He distinguished between the larger roofed tombs on the West Terrace (Type 1) and the smaller, supposedly unroofed tombs on the South Slope (Type 3), but it is now clear that these should be combined into one type, since there is good evidence that both were roofed structures and that the only real difference between them is that of size. Most of the tombs of Seager's Type 2 should also be included in this group; although he likened them to Cycladic cist graves on the basis of the upright slabs set in their walls, such slabs were found in the large tombs of Type 1 as well, and their walls are also freestanding and set above ground, unlike those of cist graves. No cist graves were found in the cleaning.5 Seager's Type 4, "burials in holes in the rocks", must be subdivided into rock shelters (Tombs VII, VIII, and XVIII), which were located in the cleaning, and simple pit or hole- in-the-ground burials (Tomb XIV), which were not located. In addition, many of the 23 graves that Seager published as separate graves belong to the same tomb. Tombs I, II, and III, for example, are really different compartments in the same building. This is also true of Tombs IV, V, and VI and apparently of Tombs XX and XXI on the South Slope. The 23 graves numbered by Seager should thus be considered 18 separate tombs. All but four are built and belong to the same class of built rectangular tombs. Sixteen were identified in the course of the cleaning and are described in detail below. The missing two have probably been destroyed, since they include the pit burials or simple inhumations (Tomb XIV) and Tomb XII, which Seager describes as a "cist grave" with fragile walls. Ten tombs that Seager does not number in his publication have also been cleaned, making a total of 28 excavated tombs. In this publication these ten have been iden- tified with letters of the Greek alphabet.6 Five of them, Tombs A, B, r, A, and E, appear to have been uncovered by Seager, since they lie on the South Slope in the area that he exca- vated, and two are actually noted in his publication; none is described or numbered, how- ever, since nothing that Seager considered noteworthy was found in them. The remaining five, Tombs Z, H, 0, I, and K, lie outside the area Seager excavated and were uncovered for the first time in 1976. THE WEST TERRACE (Frontispiece) The West Terrace forms a narrow ledge isolated on the westernmost edge of the island. It is cut off on the north and east by the rock cliffs that rise 15 meters or more to the top of the island and on the west by the sheer cliff that drops to sea level 20 to 25 meters below. The only entrance is from the south. From this point the terrace slopes upwards, running approximately north-south ca. 45.70 m., varying in width from ca. 3 m. (midway) to ca. 4 Seager, Mochlos II, pp. 13-14. 5 Seager used the term "cist grave" loosely and not, apparently, as it is used today to describe a tomb of Cycladic type. For Cycladic cist graves in Crete, see Davaras (under G II-16, p. 27 above); Davaras, 'A,ad.Xera 2, 1971, pp. 197-199; and Doumas, Burial Habits, pp. 68-69. 6 The Roman numerals used here, however, are the same as those used by Seager. 42</page><page sequence="63">THE WEST TERRACE: TOMB COMPLEX I/II/III 10.60 m. (in front of Tomb Complex IV/V/VI), and rising from ca. 22.50 m. above sea level, where it begins just below Tomb II, to ca. 28.50 m. above sea level in front of the entrance to Tomb IV. At two points, midway and at the beginning of the entrance approach to Tomb Complex IV/V/VI, the terrace is provided with steps, each consisting of a row of stones set in earth packing, which apparently extended across the entire width of the ter- race.7 Traces of four steps are preserved. The uppermost, which is intact, provides the base line for the entrance to Tomb Complex IV/V/VI and is described on page 56 below. Some 4.30 m. to its south, midway along the terrace, parts of three steps are preserved. Only two large stones of the lower two steps remain, but the upper, third step, which rests on a bed- ding of large stones, is preserved for a length of ca. 2.80 m. across the terrace (PI. 16:a).8 During the cleaning in 1976, a small bronze diadem (M IV/V/VI-3) was uncovered in the midst of these steps midway between the two large tombs on the terrace. It probably be- longed originally to a deposit in Tomb Complex IV/V/VI at the top of the terrace and washed down to its findspot. It is therefore catalogued with the finds from IV/V/VI. TOMB COMPLEX I/II/III (Figs. 16 and 17) Seager, Mochlos II, pp. 14-15, 17-40, fig. 2 (view from north), fig. 3 (plan). LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Tomb Complex I/II/III is the lower, more southern, of the two large tombs located on the West Terrace. Like the other group of tombs on this terrace, it should be considered a single complex composed of three main compartments, not three independent tombs. It is a long, rectangular building measuring a maximum of 14.12 m. in length and oriented north-south; the slope of the terrace is such that the northern compartment (III) lies at a slightly higher level than the central one (I). The orientation is determined by the width of the West Terrace at this point, which varies from 5 to 10 meters: the tomb backs against the rock face of the cliff that rises above it to the east and opens on the narrow portion of terrace to the west that drops, after a short interval, straight to the sea below. Excavated in 1908, the tomb complex was cleaned and studied by the author in 1971. In the winter of 1971-1972 a large boulder fell from the cliff that rises above the eastern side and destroyed the central wall and part of the entrance of the central compartment (I). In the summer of 1972 the boulder and the destroyed walls were removed by the Greek Ar- chaeological Service, and the tomb was consolidated with cement. ARCHITECTURE (Figs. 16 and 17, Pls. 16-19) The central compartment of the tomb (I) consists of two small rooms lying adjacent and parallel to each other, each entered from the west by its own doorway and communicating on the inside by a doorway at the east end of the compartment (PI. 17:a). The compartment 7 Seager thought in terms of a continuous pavement "which, commencing a little to the north of Tomb III, extended to the entrances" of Tomb Complex IV/V/VI (Mochlos II, p. 40). The evidence for such a pavement is somewhat scanty today, and it is unclear whether more evidence, in addition to the steps uncovered in 1971 and 1972, existed at the time of Seager's excavation. 8 H. of lower riser ca. 0.30 m.; H. of middle riser ca. 0.29 m.; H. of upper riser ca. 0.31 m. 43</page><page sequence="64">0 I 2 3.

The northern- most joins the face of the cliff on the east and terminates in a large upright slab at its west end.9 On its inner, south side, four large slabs, set upright above a narrow bedding of flat stones, form orthostates along the base of the wall.10 Flat, horizontally laid stones are placed between the slabs, and the remainder of the wall above the slabs is built with similar stones, set with a minimum of earth mortar (PI. 17:b). Unlike the terminating west pier, the up- right slabs at the base of the wall do not fill its entire width, and flat stones are used for its outer, north face. Such large orthostate slabs, often resting on a narrow bedding of small, flat stones, may be observed frequently in the Mochlos tombs. A hard, gray-blue limestone frequently laced with white chlorite veins, known locally as sideropetra, is usually used for the slabs, as it is in this wall, but green and purple schists may also be used occasionally for color contrasts. All these stones were obtained locally on the island. They were cut along even lines of fracture; as a result most have a flat, smooth surface that gives an almost finished appearance.11 The central partition wall of Compartment I (now destroyed) was also constructed with such upright base slabs of sideropetra; in this case three filled the whole width of the wall. This central wall also ended at the west in a large upright slab, but at the east it broke off before reaching the face of the cliff, leaving space for the internal doorway.12 The south wall of Compartment I is constructed somewhat differently. It con- sists of an inner, north face of flat stones laid horizontally in the center of the wall against three huge slabs placed upright to form the south face. The outer, westernmost of these slabs projects ca. 0.55 m. west of the northern face of the wall, terminating it. At its east end, the wall turns north at a right angle and runs along the face of the cliff, ending at the north in another large upright slab. Finally, yet another huge slab, over three meters in length, is set upright against the outer, south side of the wall and, together with a filling of smaller stones at its east, serves as the north wall of Compartment II. The resulting wall, constructed in three parallel sections, is nearly twice the width of the other walls in Compartment I.13 The three slabs that terminate the walls on the west, the northern and southern of sideropetra, the central (now destroyed) of green schist, form large decorative piers framing the doorways that give access to Compartment I (PI. 17:c).14 The doorways themselves are set back 0.50 to 0.60 m. from the ends of the walls in such a way that a small rectangular al- cove is formed in front of each doorway. The northern doorway, ca. 0.61 m. wide, is pro- vided with two jambs of small, upright, rectangular slabs that project from the side walls of the room and narrowthe entry space (Pl. 17:d). The southern doorway, ca. 0.68 m. wide, lacks such jambs, but the inner face of the south wall serves a similar function, narrowing the entrance at the point where it ends, to the east of the south pier. Seager reported door slabs closing these entrances, but no trace of these was found during the cleaning, and so it is 9 North wall, Compartment I: L. ca. 3.30 m.; W. 0.56-0.62 m.; H. ca. 1.46 m. 10 H. of largest slab 1.07 m., max.

The northern room of Compart- ment I is the larger: it extends all the way back to the face of the cliff, ca. 2.75 m. from the interior of the door jambs, and is ca. 0.91 m. wide at the west end, ca. 1.26 m. at the east.15 At the northeast corner of this room, a small rock overhang forms a natural cavity ca. 0.40 m. high and ca. 0.50 m. deep. At the southeast corner the internal doorway, ca. 0.69 m. wide, which is framed by the upright slabs in the flanking walls, provides access to the southern room. This room is somewhat smaller because of the built wall that closes it on the east; it measures ca. 2.02 m. in length (from the west end of the inner south wall) and varies from 0.58 to 0.66 m. in width.16 Compartment I alone of the three in the tomb appears to have had a level earth floor. Compartment II, which lies to the south, consists of one long rectangular room, the south wall of which is completely destroyed (PI. 16:b). Its north wall, as noted above, con- sists of the huge upright slab set against the south wall of Compartment I. The west wall, which is partly destroyed towards its south, is constructed in a similar fashion, the preserved portion consisting of two slabs set upright on the inside of the wall with a rubble wall flanking the larger of the two slabs on the outside (PI. 18:a).'7 As preserved, this outer rubble wall has the appearance of a bench lying in front of the tomb. At the north it breaks off without joining the pier that flanks the south doorway of Compartment I, nor does it appear ever to have done so (PI. 18:b). It leaves a small opening here, ca. 0.85 m. deep and 1.10-1.26 m. wide, which may have served as a niche in the facade of the tomb, or, if the northern slab of the inner wall is in fact the blocking slab of a small doorway, which is also possible, the opening here would be an alcove in front of the doorway like those in front of Compartment I. At the south, after a gap, a small part of the rubble wall, consisting of three stones, is still preserved. This segment probably marks the south end of the wall, since the terrain begins to fall away at this point.18 The east wall of Compartment II is formed partly by the exposed cliff face at the north and, where it recedes along the south, by a built wall of upright slabs (PI. 18:c).19 At its north the built section of wall rests on natural horizontal beddings in the cliff face; at its south, where it rests on the bedrock floor, it ends on approxi- mately the same line as the preserved south end of the west wall, suggesting that this point marks the original southern limit of the compartment. Compartment II may have been entered through a doorway somewhere in the west wall, as are Compartments I and III, or, as Seager suggested,20 in the destroyed south wall. The entrance would have given access to a room at least 5.42 m. long and ca. 1.90 m. wide at the north. The floor of the room is remarkable for the large cavity located at the north end (PI. 18:d), the mouth of which occupies the entire width of the room and extends ca. 1.70 m. 15 Cf.

It was thought by Seager to have been partially manmade and was reported to have a depth of 0.70 m. To the south the floor is more regular and is formed by a large outcropping of sideropetra that is level on top, except for a slight slope downwards towards the south, and is filled in with rubble masonry at the northwest, where a gap would otherwise occur. The upper, northern compartment of the tomb (III) consists of another single oblong room (PI. 19:a). Its walls are constructed in ordinary rubble masonry without the monu- mental slabs used in the compartments to the south, and there is a distinct possibility that it is a later addition. Its outer, west wall, resting on a bedding of earth and small stones 0.05-0.35 m. thick, is irregularly built and is set out of line from and west of the west fa- Cades of Compartments I and II. At the south it is incomplete, leaving a gap ca. 1.50 m. wide between itself and the north wall of Compartment I, which serves as its south wall. At the north it ends in an upright slab that forms a pier flanking the doorway at the corner.21 The short north wall, running east-west from the face of the cliff, is flanked after a short gap of exposed bedrock by a short wall at right angles to it, running north-south along the face of the cliff.22 The doorway at the northwest corner, ca. 0.87 m. wide, provides one access to the room; Seager believed that a second existed at the southwest corner. Such an entrance is likely in view of the line of the west wall, which would have prevented it from joining the north wall of Compartment I. In the photograph of the tomb published by Seager (fig. 2), an upright slab appears to have been located against the outer northwest corner of the north wall of Compartment I and to have formed a pier flanking a doorway on the south similar to the pier flanking the preserved north doorway. No trace of this pier is preserved, except perhaps a single flat stone that may have served as bedding. The north doorway opens onto a small vestibule, measuring ca. 1.26 by ca. 1.58 m., formed by the section of built wall that runs along its east side. To the south of this point, the room opens out considerably as a result of the diagonal slant of the cliff face, so that the width of the room at the south, ca. 2.90 m., is more than twice that at the north, ca. 1.26 m.23 The length of the room is ca. 5.95 m. Its floor slopes downwards from north to south (Fig. 17) and is broken midway by an outcropping of sideropetra that runs diagonally through its center, sloping downwards from northwest to southeast. Of special interest is the location of a shallow cave, ca. 2.15 m. high at its mouth, in the face of the cliff (Fig. 17, Pls. 16:b, 19:b). It lies ca. 1.78 m. above the floor of the com- partment and is separated from it by three superimposed strata of sideropetra, purple schist, and sideropetra, each set back from the other and forming as it were three natural steps leading up to the floor of the cave. This floor, ca. 2.90 m. wide at its mouth and ca. 1.85 m. deep, is partially paved with rounded slabs set in a loose gravel of sand and schist, suggest- ing that the cave was an integral part of the compartment and served a special function within it. Of the three compartments of the tomb, this one alone may have been only partly roofed. The east wall at the north of the compartment suggests that a roof was located over 21 West wall, Compartment III: L. ca. 3.67 m.; W. 0.64-0.87 m.; H. ca. 0.68 m. 22 North wall, Compartment III: L. ca. 1.84 m.; W. 0.45-0.55 m.; H. ca. 0.82 m.

BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY (Fig. 18) Seager reported skeletal remains in Compartments I and II, apparently none still artic- ulated. The larger, north room of Compartment I was empty and had apparently never been used for burials. The southern room contained "at least thirty skulls mixed with a confused mass of other bones."24 In addition, Seager reported three distinct strata in this room, represented graphically here in Figure 18, consisting of disturbed surface, 0.20 m. of artificial fill, and one meter of burial stratum. From the top artificial fill Seager reported MM III pottery fragments but no burials, and from the lower burial stratum an EM IIa clay vase painted in typical Koumasa style (I b) and EM IIa incised stone vases,25 which suggest that this lower stratum was a closed EM IIa deposit. The finds in Compartment II came from two separate locations. From the surface at the south end of the room Seager reported MM III vases (unpublished) and on the rock floor, "many bones" of unspecified date. From the rock cavity at the north end of the room, Seager reported three distinct strata, also represented in Figure 18, consisting of disturbed surface, 24 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 18. 25 For a general discussion of the Koumasa style and the clay vase (I b) see Zois, Kamares-Stil, pp. 81, 84-85 and Zois, "Epevva, pp. 717-718, pl. 31; for the stone vases see Warren, KplqrXpov 19, 1965, pp. 8-9, 13 and Warren, MSV, p. 82, D250, P457.

Both contained bone fragments. No skeletal remains were found in Compartment III, and the pottery (III m, n) and presumably the majority of finds date to MM Ia.27 A few objects of gold and silver from the southeast corner of the room, however, were thought to be the remains of an EM burial that was cleared out in the MM I phase. During the cleaning and consolidation of the tomb in 1971 and 1972, fragments of stone vases, sherds, and pieces of bone were uncovered. For the most part they showed no sig- nificant joins, and the only finds that may have been in situ and so thought to be part of the original contents include a small stone pyxis with lid (M I-1), which was found in the rubble-wall debris in Compartment I after the fall of the boulder in the winter of 1971/ 1972, as well as a few sea shells and the remains of a spouted dish (M II-1) that were uncov- ered in the lower part of the cavity at the north end of Compartment II.

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION (P1. 20:a) Like Tomb Complex I/II/III, this structure, also described by Seager as three sepa- rate tombs, should be considered a single building. It is rectangular, consists of three separate compartments, and measures a maximum of 5.54 by 8.20 m. on its exterior. One of the best preserved of the tombs on the island, it stands at the upper, north end of the West Terrace (Plan 3), flanked on the north and east by the cliff that rises here to its highest point and on the west by the edge of the terrace that drops sharply to sea level. The tomb faces south, its orientation determined by its location at the end of the terrace at the widest and most level part. Excavated in 1908, like the lower tomb, it too was cleaned by the author in 1971 and consolidated with cement in 1972 by the Greek Archaeological Service. During the 1971 cleaning, much of the area in front of the tomb was uncovered for the first time, and an important deposit of EM II/III material that had escaped Seager's excavation was discov- ered in Compartment VI. During the consolidation of 1972, the outer, southwest corner of this compartment was partially rebuilt. ARCHITECTURE (Figs. 20 and 21, Pls. 20-22) The walls of this tomb complex are unusual in that they are built entirely in stone and are preserved in places to their original height. Like those of Tomb Complex I/II/III they use base orthostate slabs in the more important wall facades and flat, horizontally laid stones with a small amount of earth mortar. All the walls are entirely built, however, and living rock is not utilized. Only the north wall is not freestanding; it is set against a rise in 51</page><page sequence="72">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY / 7 0 1 2 3M, _ - - ' 1 5~~~s /-; FIG. 20.

Section AB through Mochlos Tomb Complex IV/V/VI slabs of sideropetra, both set at its west end (PI. 20:b). The slab that terminates the wall at the west is a large rectangular block, placed on end, that forms an important cornerstone at the junction with the east wall of Compartment IV. The south wall is built with large stones, including several roughly squared blocks, as well as the usual flat stones, and these too have a smooth outer surface. It is further adorned by the addition of a low course of stones that runs along the base of the wall as a kind of toichobate. This course, 0.03-0.05 m. high and 0.21-0.25 m. wide, lies partly under the cornerstone at the west end of the wall but elsewhere simply runs alongside the wall at ground level, rising where bedrock rises at the east end, in two steps.30 The main entrance to the tomb, opening into Compartment IV, the central compart- ment, is set back between the projecting east and west walls (PI. 20:c). The cornerstone of the south wall of Compartment VI forms a pier, as it were, on one side, and the projecting end of the west wall, which is carefully built up with a series of slabs, forms a pier on the other side. The space between these piers, ca. 1.68 m. wide and 0.48-0.54 m. deep, forms a small alcove before the doorway. The doorway itself is set between two jambs that are built up like the west door pier in carefully laid, horizontal courses of flat stones. These do not bond with the side walls of the compartment but form simple rectangular projections placed against them. The doorway, ca. 0.78 m. wide, is provided with a stone threshold consisting of a single slab. The threshold and the jambs suggest that at some point the tomb had a wooden door, but at the time of the original excavation Seager reported "a great upright slab" that closed this doorway.31 The doorway opens into a rectangular compartment ca. 3.50 m. deep, ca. 1.70 m. wide at the south, and ca. 1.90 m. wide at the north. Its east and west walls are both constructed with upright orthostate slabs. The east wall uses three at its base, two of sideropetra and one of green schist, and the west wall uses four, three of sideropetra and one of purple schist 30 South wall: L. ca. 4.02 m.; W. 0.76-0.80 m.; H. ca. 2.06 m. 31 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 44. No trace of this slab was found during the cleaning of the tomb. 53</page><page sequence="74">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY (Pl. 20:d).32 The color contrasts appear to be intentional, and the decorative effect of the or- thostates suggests that the compartment was intended to serve as an important room in the tomb. The north wall, which rests on rising bedrock above floor level and lacks these slabs, is preserved to its original height, ca. 2.30 m. above floor level, indicating the height of the roof over this room. Midway, the room is divided into two parts by a narrow partition wall.33 This wall, only a single stone course of which is preserved, would have blocked access to the north half of the room; it does not bond with either side wall and, as Seager observed, is a later addition. The floor of the compartment is level earth fill except at the northwest corner, where an outcropping of bedrock is exposed. At the northeast corner a break in the east wall of the compartment, ca. 1 m. wide, provides access to Compartment VI. The threshold of this doorway is located 0.53-0.80 m. above the floor of Compartment IV and is formed by the extension of the base of the east wall on the south and by exposed bedrock on the north. At the time of the original excavation, the doorway was blocked with a wall of rubble masonry. Compartment VI may be entered only by the northeast doorway of Compartment IV and is, as a result, isolated at the east end of the tomb (P1. 21:a). The doorway opens onto a large outcropping of bedrock, level with the threshold of the doorway and partially forming it, that immediately slopes down towards the center of the room. The room is approximately rectangular, measuring ca. 1.60 m. north-south and ca. 1.90 m. east-west at the north end. The floor is formed by irregular outcroppings of bedrock that line the room on the south, west, and north and leave a large cavity inth t and the center and against part of theast wall. Seager reported the depth of the deposit in this cavity to be some 3.85 m. below the top of the north wall. The west and south walls of Compartment VI, which rest on outcroppings, are also constructed with large orthostate slabs. Two stand at the base of each wall, all of sidero- petra. The west part of the north wall rests on the outcropping, but where this falls away at the east it rests on a projecting foundation of flat stones (PI. 21 :b). The wall is constructed in ordinary rubble and is preserved to its full height, ca. 1.93 m. above its foundation wall, ca. 2.86 m. in all. The east wall is only partly preserved. It was erected against the face of the cliff on this side of the tomb and originally concealed a small cavity in the rock face. At its north it also rests on the projecting foundation, which continues here at right angles from beneath the north wall. At its center it is flush with this foundation wall; the small section preserved of its south stretch rests on horizontal ledges in the cliff face that project into the compartment. The rest of the wall, destroyed now, was also bedded on these ledges; the foundation beneath the north half of the wall (and beneath the north wall) was used only to fill gaps where bedrock falls away and to provide a level bedding for the upper part of the wall. The east wall itself, above its foundation, does not appear to bond with the north wall of the room and 32 East wall, Compartment IV: L. ca. 3.26 m.; W. 0.50-0.57 m.; H. ca. 2.09 m.

(north-south) for the southern room and 1.85 m. (north-south) for the northern room. Seager's measurements for the entire compartment are 3.90 by 1.80 m. 54</page><page sequence="75">THE WEST TERRACE: TOMB COMPLEX IV/V/VI runs at an acute angle to it. The diagonal line on which the east wall runs precludes a junction with the east end of the south wall without making a sharp turn towards the south- east; the south end of the compartment must have been narrower than the north.34 Seager believed that the east wall of the room was a later addition to the tomb and that only the foundation wall belonged to the time of the original construction at the beginning of the EM II period.35 He observed a layer of fallen wall debris between the lower, EM II stratum in the room and the upper, MM III stratum and suggested that this debris belonged to the collapsed original wall. His explanation is certainly correct and is also suggested both by the apparent failure of the east wall to bond with the north and by its irregular, diagonal line, projecting into the compartment and narrowing it at the south. The date that Seager assigned to the rebuilding of the wall, however, is less certain. Compartments IV and VI, forming a but-and-ben unit, appear to have comprised the original core of the tomb. Compartment V, on the west side, is constructed with less care; it seems to have been added somewhat later and to have served secondary functions (PI. 21:c). Whereas the north wall behind Compartments IV and VI is built in ordinary rubble with inner and outer faces and runs in a fairly straight line, the western part, lying behind Com- partment V, is built more crudely, with only a single face of stones set against the rise in bedrock.36 It veers towards the south at an angle to the rest of the wall and does not bond with the main north wall. Instead, it overlaps this wall and is set back ca. 0.22 m. to the north at the point where it meets it on the outside; as a result, the inner north side of Com- partment V lies farther north than do those of Compartments IV and VI. These structural peculiarities seem to reflect different building phases, although they may result instead from changes in the terrain, since bedrock lies at a higher level along the north side of Compart- ment V and beneath the west extension of the north wall than along the north sides of Compartments IV and VI and beneath the main section of the wall. The west wall of Compartment V is also somewhat crudely built, without regard for the rest of the tomb, in that its south end lies considerably behind the line of the main south faade. The wall is set, as Seager noted, at the very edge of the precipice, dropping to the sea and terminating at its south in two rough boulders that serve to strengthen this end, erected as it is in a somewhat precarious position. These boulders, although set upright, are not comparable to the up- right slabs used elsewhere in the tomb, since they fill the whole width of the wall and are rough and unfinished.37 None of the walls in this compartment is built with the upright orthostates found in the rest of the tomb. Compartment V lacks a wall on the south, so that the entrance extends the entire dis- tance between its east and west walls, ca. 1.31 m. This space is rather wide for an ordinary 34 East wall, Compartment VI: p.L. ca. 2.50 m.; W. 0.30-0.66 m.; H. above foundation at north end ca. 1.50 m. Foundation: L. along east side ca. 1.50 m.; L. along north side ca. 1.22 m.; W. of projecting sections 0.01-0.41 m.; H. at northeast corner ca. 0.93 m. 35 Seager's observation that the later builders did not find the top of the original wall when laying the new east wall and placed the new wall somewhat farther forward is not wholly accurate. In fact, although the new east wall does narrow the compartment at the south, it rests directly on the earlier foundation and is set back on it at the north. 36 North wall: L. of east section ca. 5.70 m.; W. 0.60-0.92 m.; H. at inside northeast corner ca. 2.86 m.; L. of west section ca. 3 m.; W. 0.36-0.54 m.; H. at inside ca. 1.16 m.; total L. ca. 8 m. 37 West wall, Compartment V: L. ca. 4.36 m.; W. 0.54-0.80 m.; H. ca. 1.14 m. 55</page><page sequence="76">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY doorway, but Seager believed it to have been closed originally by a huge slab that he ob- served "lying part way down the slope caught between two boulders."38 The entrance opens into a narrow rectangular room ca. 4.40 m. long, ca. 1.70 m. wide at its north, and ca. 1.32 m. wide at its south.39 Its floor is formed by a small level area of packed earth at the entrance and by uncut bedrock that slopes sharply upwards to the north. The north wall again appears to be preserved to its original height, the same as that of the rest of the north wall lying to the east, but because of the rise in bedrock at the north end of the room, it stands only ca. 0.85 m. above floor level, and it would have been possible to stand upright only at the south end of the room. Outside the tomb to the south, Seager reported "a small roughly paved court."40 He did not elaborate, and during the cleaning of this area a much more complicated system of approach was revealed. It consists of four interrelated elements (Figs. 20 and 21; P1. 22:a). First is the uppermost of the four steps uncovered on the West Terrace, which is located ca. 5.50 m. south of the tomb. Some 0.38 m. high, it extends the whole width of the terrace at this point, ca. 3.60 m., and forms the base line of the approach to the tomb (PI. 22:b). A paved area resembling a sidewalk lies alongside the facade of the tomb about four meters north of the base step and ca. 0.95 m. above it. As preserved, this area is ca. 3.55 m. long east-west and extends 1.40 to 1.64 m. in front of the tomb. The north side of the pavement joins the low course of stones at the base of the facade but is separate from and lies slightly below it. The west end of the pavement is incomplete and breaks off in front of Compart- ment IV; originally, it probably extended somewhat farther west, but whether it also ex- tended farther south is unclear. There are no traces of any pavement stones here today, and the fairly straight line of the south face of the pavement may indicate that it did not extend farther. In that case, the area between the upper pavement and the base step formed a sizable open space with an uneven earth surface sloping gently upwards to the north.41 This open area is flanked all along the east side by a raised terrace set against the face of the cliff overlooking the tomb (PI. 22:c). The terrace, which is paved on top, is ca. 4.45 m. long at the front and 1.80-2.00 m. wide. Its outer, west face is built up with flat stones as well as larger blocks, and the terrace is raised ca. 0.69 m. above the base step at the south and ca. 0.15 m. above the upper pavement, which it overlaps at the north and from which it is best approached. Finally, set at the outer southeast corner of the tomb, against its south wall and the face of the cliff rising to the east, at the juncture of the upper pavement and the raised terrace, is a small rectangular platform. This platform, which is provided west and south with neatly built faces and is also paved on top, measures ca. 1.64 by 1.74 m. It is raised ca. 0.59 m. above the upper pavement to the west and ca. 0.47 m. above the raised terrace to the south, and it may be approached from both sides by small corner steps, one at the northwest and the other at the southeast.42 During the cleaning of the area, fragments of stone vases were found on top of this structure, including several joins from the same vase (M IV/V/VI-1 38 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 42. No trace of this slab was found during the cleaning. 39 Cf.

Bone fragments Compartment VI FIG. 22. Mochlos Tomb Complex IV/V/VI: strata in Compartment VI and 2). While they may have been thrown here from inside the tomb in antiquity or during the original excavation, they may be the remains of vases actually placed here as offerings; in that case, the platform itself should be identified as an open-air altar similar to that found outside Gournia Tomb II.43 Each of the main elements in this system of approach-upper pavement, raised terrace, and corner platform-uses flat paving slabs of varying colors, mostly blue-gray limestone (sideropetra), but also black, red, and green stones, which impart a decorative, "mosaic" effect to the whole area. These slabs are laid directly on the earth without a bedding of sand or other material, and the horizontal levels are somewhat irregular; as a result, the slabs of the upper pavement and raised terrace both slope upwards somewhat, towards the west. BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY (Fig. 22) During the excavation of the tomb, Seager discovered stratified deposits in each com- partment. Throughout Compartment IV, deepest at the north end, lay a stratum containing MM III pottery and other grave goods, including a small terracotta head, but no skeletal remains. Beneath this stratum, along the north face of the partition wall at floor level, an EM III burial was exposed. The skeletal remains are not described, and it is unclear whether they were still articulated. One clay cup fixed the date of the burial (IV 2).44 Apparently no EM II remains were found inside the compartment. Seager did report frag- ments of black burnished ware just outside the entrance, however, which he believed to be the remains of an original EM II stratum that was thrown out when the compartment was cleaned for re-use. 43 See discussion, pp. 219-221 below. 44Seager, Mochlos II, p. 47, figs. 18, 19; Zois, Kamares-Stil, pp. 160-161; Walberg, Middle Minoan Pottery, p. 129. 57</page><page sequence="78">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY In Compartment VI Seager also found two distinct strata. Both contained disturbed skeletal remains. The upper stratum, which apparently covered the whole floor of the room, contained MM III/LM I potsherds together with some modest grave goods and was thought to represent the relics of "people of poor condition."45 It was separated from the lower stratum by a layer of fallen wall debris. It was this lower stratum, composed of the lower 0.50 m. of fill in the large cavity that forms the floor, that contained the rich deposit of stone vases and gold jewelry for which the tomb is famous. The pottery here, as noted by Seager, belonged to the early part of the EM II phase, "when the grey subneolithic clays and the buff polished wares which preceded the mottled fabrics were still in use."46 Five clay vases were published from this stratum, one of gray burnished ware (VI 11)47 and four of Koumasa style (VI 6, 15, 19, 20).48 During the cleaning of this compartment in 1971, a third deposit of a completely differ- ent nature was discovered. It was located in a slide of loose earth coming from just outside the northeast corner of the room, extending over the collapsed east wall and filling the whole floor of the compartment (Fig. 22). The actual deposit concealed in this earth slide was lim- ited to a somewhat smaller area, extending from just outside the east wall to the middle of the room and sloping down from the top of the north end of the east wall to a point just below its foundations. The deposit had originally lain outside, between the east wall and the face of the cliff, at least partially in the small cavity located there, which would account for Seager's having missed it when he excavated in this area. Sometime after the original excavation, it was washed down into the compartment and then covered by earth slides. At least 85 percent of the sherds collected from this deposit belong to EM IIb/III styles, Vasilike mottled ware making up 69 percent of the total, and white-on-black painted ware accounting for 16 percent (PI. 23:a and b).49 No vase is complete. The majority of the Vasilike fragments be- long to spouted teapots, however, and over ten spouts were collected with fragments of as many bases, as well as one complete body (M VI-1). In addition to mottling, many of these fragments bear horizontal and vertical rows of impressed dots, a type of additional decora- tion that appears to be less common elsewhere and that may be a distinctive feature of Mochlos Vasilike ware.50 The deposit also contained a few objects of considerable value, including a marble bowl (M VI-4), a bronze dagger and a bronze scraper (M VI-5 and 6), a one-handled silver cup that had been folded over at the time of its deposit to enclose a small 45 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 51. 46 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 50. 47 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 52, figs. 22, 23; Zois, Kamares-Stil, p. 86; Warren, Myrtos, p. 103. 48 Seager, Mochlos II, pp. 52-54, figs. 22, 23; Zois, Kamares-Stil, p. 86. The jugs (VI 15, 19, 20) may be dated to the EM IIa phase on the basis of their shape alone: flat base, globular body, short and narrow cylin- drical neck with small pointed spout, small loop handle from below rim to shoulder. For the shape, cf. Moch- los I b (footnote 25, p. 49 above) in painted Koumasa style. While VI 15 and 19 were apparently undecorated, VI 20 carried dark paint on its spout and handle. 49 A total of 282 sherds were counted in this deposit. They may be classified into the following groups: Vasilike ware (including four fragments with white paint) 68.6%; white-on-black EM III styles 15.8%; brown-black burnished fabrics 7%; polished buff fabrics and Koumasa style 3.5%; remainder coarse or un- diagnostic. No sherds could be classed as gray burnished ware, and it is probable that the brown-black burnished sherds should be dated to the same time as the EM IIb/III material. No stratification was observed, and several joins were made between baskets taken from different levels. 50 For a discussion of this form of decoration see Warren, Myrtos, pp. 132-133. 58</page><page sequence="79">THE WEST TERRACE: TOMB COMPLEX IV/V/VI hoard of gold jewelry (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4298, 4299-4313, 4347-4362), and an ivory seal (Ag.Nik.Mus. 3106). With the exception of the blades, which were found together, all these objects were found at different levels.51 The deposit contained no skeletal material whatsoever. In Compartment V the burial deposit uncovered by Seager consisted of scattered skel- etal remains mixed with unstratified EM II and EM III pottery and other grave goods, all of which were thought to have been dumped here after initial burial elsewhere. Two vases are published from this compartment, an EM III white-painted jug (V a)52 and a two- handled jar that should belong to the EM IIb phase (V b).53 As a result of the cleaning and restudy of this tomb, many of Seager's original obser- vations about its use may be confirmed, while others seem to require some modification. Since the original burial deposit in Compartment VI belongs to the EM IIa phase, it is clear that the main compartments (IV and VI) were built at this time. Seager believed that the outer Compartment IV was not used for final interments until much later, however, and that even when it came to be used for burials, the outer part of the room always remained open. He suggested that the compartment was designed as a "mortuary chapel" and that the black burnished ware found outside the entrance represented the remains of offerings placed in this chapel.54 Such a conclusion would tie in well with the architectural elabo- ration of the room. Compartment VI, which did contain skeletal material of this period, was intended to serve as the burial chamber. At the end of the EM IIa phase the tomb appears to have undergone some major al- terations. In this period, and probably not in the MM III phase as suggested by Seager, the east wall of Compartment VI collapsed and was rebuilt. This sequence is suggested by the closed EM IIa deposit beneath the collapsed wall debris and by the EM IIb/III deposit found during the cleaning in 1971, which presumably came from Compartment VI and originally lay above the fallen wall debris. Seager's contention that the room was closed at the end of the EM IIa phase by the blocking wall in the door between Compartments IV and VI is unlikely to be true, since this wall lay considerably above the EM IIa deposit in the floor cavity and presumably at the level of the MM III deposit in the room. It is more likely that the room continued in service to the end of the EM III phase, as did both Com- partments IV and V, and that the wall blocking the internal door was added at the very end after the MM III/LM I period, so that the room remained open to those who re-used it for burials at this time. In this case, the EM IIb/III material, found during the 1971 cleaning, 51 It was from this same deposit "behind the collapsed east wall" that Hood uncovered an EM IIb stone teapot (N. Platon, 0XpovrKa&gt;, Kp7/rXpov 2,1948 [pp. 584-590], p. 589, fig. 18; Warren, MSV, p. 99). Seager also excavated here and uncovered several finds, including a "large disk of thin gold ... together with the fragments of a couple of fine stone vases," all apparently EM II in date (Mochlos II, pp. 55-56). 52 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 42, figs. 18, 19; Zois, Kamares-Stil, p. 149; Walberg, Middle Minoan Pottery, p. 129. 53 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 43, fig. 18. This jar, thought by Seager to belong to the early part of the EM II phase, should be dated to the EM IIb phase on the basis of its decoration. It is made of buff clay coated with a brown slip (note the line around the interior of the mouth), which is burnished and decorated with three parallel horizontal rows of impressed dots running between the handles. Such dotted decoration, as noted above, is common on Mochlos Vasilike ware and should be distinguished from the incised and punctuated decoration of gray burnished ware. It is imitated in white paint in the EM III phase immediately following. 54 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 44. 59</page><page sequence="80">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY would have been thrown out when the room was cleaned to make room for new burials at the start of the MM III phase. Furthermore, Compartment VI was probably not filled with burials by the end of the EM IIa phase, since the EM IIa deposit did not extend above the floor cavity when the east wall collapsed. It is more likely that this room was filled only in the course of the EM IIb/III phases, and it was then that the north, rear section of Compartment IV was used for burials, in order to accommodate the overflow from this room. Compartment V was probably erected at this time, too, either sometime in the course of the EM IIb/III phases as a result of the overcrowding in the tomb or at the beginning of the EM IIb phase in anticipation of this overcrowding and in conjunction with the repairs made to the east wall of Compartment VI. Such a date for Compartment V is suggested by the two published vases belonging to the EM IIb and EM III phases and by the deposit noted by Seager beneath its south floor, which contained some EM IIa polished buff and painted Koumasa-style fragments.55 Compart- ment V would thus have been designed primarily as an ossuary for the secondary storage of burials originally made in Compartment VI, a use suggested by the scattered disposition of finds noted by Seager and the comparatively careless construction of the chamber. CATALOGUE A. Depositfrom Compartment VI Several objects from this deposit have been published fully elsewhere and need no further publication here. They include: the silver cup (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4298) and the jewelry found inside it (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4299- 4313, 4347-4362), published by Davaras, BSA 70, 1975, pp. 101-114; an ivory seal (Ag.Nik.Mus. 3106) found by Davaras in 1971 and published in 1973 ('ApX'E4, 1973, pp. 82-84); and a stone teapot (Her.Mus. 2395) found by Hood in 1948 and published by Platon in KprqrXpov 2,1948, p. 589 and Warren, MSV, p. 99 (see footnote 51, p. 59 above). Several other objects found in 1971 have also been catalogued. VESSELS Pottery M VI-i (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4376). Teapot Fig. 23, PI. 23:a Outside eastern wall of VI. Three large joining fragments preserving body and part of ring foot. Two handles restored. H. 0.068-0.095 m.; D. at base 0.05 m. Fine buff clay; mottled Vasilike surface, reserved around rim and center of vase. Flattened piriform body with small raised collar and ring foot. Decorated with three horizontal rows of im- pressed dots, two around center of body, one below rim. The vase should probably be restored as a typical Vasilike teapot, not a two-handled jar, with one ver- tical handle opposite one side spout. One of the sev- eral spouts found in this deposit may in fact belong to the vase. For the decoration compare V b and M 44 from Mochlos (Seager, Mochlos II, pp. 43, 82, figs. 18, 48) and Warren's discussion in Myrtos, pp. 132-133. The Mochlos examples differ in deco- ration from the Myrtos vases in that the area behind the dots is reserved. M VI-2 (Ag.Nik.Mus). Fragments of Vasilike teapots PI. 23:b Found throughout deposit. Fragments of several teapots similar to M VI-1, including at least seven complete spouts. Many of the fragments are decorated with rows of impressed dots, perhaps inspired by the dot repousse of contemporary jewelry, and the decoration seems to be characteristic of Mochlos Vasilike ware.

Findsfrom outside Tomb Complex IV/V/VI Various pieces of jewelry found in the area in front of the tomb complex (Ag.Nik.Mus. 3107-3112,3115, 4366a, b) have been published by Davaras: BSA 70,1975, pp. 107-114. Like the cylindrical gold beads 4366a, b, which are identical to those that Seager found in Compartments IV and VI (Mochlos II, figs. 20, 25, pp. 48, 55), many of these pieces may have been thrown out of the tomb during its excavation.

Like the West Terrace, it is delineated by distinct topographical features. It is bounded on the northeast by a sharp rise in bedrock that forms a low cliff, on the northwest by a drop in bedrock that falls to the level of the West Terrace, and on the southwest by the sea. The slope rises from sea level about 35 meters at its highest point and encloses a much larger area than the West Terrace, over 2000 square meters. It also contained a much larger number of tombs. Twenty of these have been cleaned and re-exposed, but they represent only a fraction of the total number that once stood here. There is room for nearly twice as many, and Seager estimated that there were at least 34 tombs here, double the number that he excavated. He observed that many tombs had been completely destroyed "owing to the steep declivity" on which they were placed and the "process of denudation". Evidence of these destroyed tombs survived, however, in their contents, which were scattered over the "entire hillside, the soil of which was found to be filled with objects from tombs which had otherwise disappeared," and in deposits of a "sticky white clay" that were thought to belong to the vanished walls or roofs of these tombs.56 The destruction has been greatest across the exposed center of the slope, where erosion has been most severe, while most of the preserved tombs are protected by overhanging cliffs along the top of the slope and along its sides. The cleaning of this area, carried out in 1971, 1972, and 1976, has revealed a rather methodical layout, unusual in Prepalatial cemeteries, which reflects the terrain of the site. Most of, if not all, the tombs were built on terraces that run approximately east-west across the slope,57 starting near the edge of the water and rising one above the other up the hill. Each terrace backs on the one above it and is supported either by a rise in bedrock or, more often, by the rear walls of the tombs on the terrace below. The terraces are partly natural, therefore, and partly artificial. Narrow passages appear to have run lengthwise along the outer side of each terrace, while the thindividual tombs stood on the inner side, backing against the rise in ground level of the ae terrace behind and opening onto the outer passage in front. While only one of these terraces, the topmost, is completely preserved along its entire length, the terraces that are partially preserved below this one and the contour intervals along the slope suggest that there may once have been as many as seven terraces of tombs. The section drawn along the eastern side of the slope through the upper four terraces, Figure 26, indicates their general disposition. Many of the tombs on the South Slope can be identified with those that Seager ex- cavated and published. Since Seager's system of numbering was often haphazard, however, in the following description the tombs are arranged by the terrace on which they are located, starting with the topmost or seventh terrace. 56 Seager, Mochlos II, pp. 13, 16. It should also be noted that a great number of small stones, of the type that may once have been used in the construction of tomb walls, lie strewn about the South Slope. 57 The actual orientation is more nearly southeast-northwest. The tombs are oriented accordingly, running usually northeast-southwest, although in the following description their walls are designated north, south, east, and west, as they are by Seager. 63</page><page sequence="84">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY TERRACE 7: TOMBS XIX, XXIII, A, AND B (Figs. 25 and 26, PI. 24:a) Seager, Mochlos II, pp. 70-74, 79-80. LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Terrace 7, the highest and best preserved of the terraces on the South Slope, extends for a distance of ca. 20.40 m. east-west and averages ca. 5 m. in width (but only ca. 3.20 m. at its east end). It is bounded on the north by a sharp rise in bedrock, which forms an overhanging cliff along its eastern half, on the west by a rise in the hill that overlooks the West Terrace, and on the east by a sharp drop to the level of the sixth terrace. Four tombs lie in a row here, and since there is little space for additional tombs, four appears to be the original number on this terrace. Each backs against the cliff rising to the north and faces south, with its side walls running from the face of the cliff parallel to the side walls of the other tombs. The tombs may be identified without any doubt, since Seager describes four such tombs, only two of which, XIX and XXIII, contained any finds, and these are the only tombs on the South Slope that may be so described. Tomb XXIII, which "lay in a line with No. XIX," is the third from the west in this row, since Seager noted that the two empty and unnumbered tombs lie to its right and left. Tomb XIX, therefore, must be the westernmost of the four. With the exception of XXIII, which was blocked by a huge boulder that had fallen into its center, the tombs were cleaned by the author in 1971. In 1976 the Greek Archaeological Service removed the boulder from Tomb XXIII and re-exposed the tomb. TOMB XIX (P1. 24:c and d) Seager described the construction of the tomb as "very poor, consisting of a retaining wall at the lower or southern end, with two side walls running back to the face of the cliff at the foot of which the tomb lies."58 The tomb is the least well preserved of those on this ledge, and thus its construction might well be described as "very poor". In its layout it meets Seager's general description except for one detail. In 1976 the remains of a second chamber were found next to and west of the chamber that Seager excavated. Very few traces of it remain: its west and south walls are largely destroyed, and only its north wall and shared eastern wall are preserved. It does not appear to have been previously excavated. The eastern chamber, on the other hand, which had been excavated, matches Seager's descrip- tion of the tomb. He noted that the soil at its north end against the cliff was only 0.10 m. deep and that the soil cover never reached more than 0.40 m. in any part of the tomb. The tomb is the least sheltered of the four on this terrace, since the cliff to the north is not high here (and might better be described as an outcropping), and it rests directly on the bedrock slope; a deeper soil cover would be impossible. The tomb is also provided with the "very uneven" rock floor that Seager noted. The building is, then, a two-room rectangular structure, not one room as Seager report- ed, with an over-all length east-west of ca. 4.60 m. There is no clearly discernible entrance, but doorways were probably once located in the destroyed southern walls, as they are in the 58 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 70. 64</page><page sequence="85">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 7 rest of the tombs on this terrace. The eastern room, which held the rich finds uncovered by Seager, is the larger, measuring ca. 2.40 m. at its wider north end and ca. 2.20 m. north-south. Both the east and west side walls remain, projecting at right angles from the cliff face and resting on bedrock.59 The better-preserved east wall is built in ordinary rubble on the inside, but the base on the outside near its north end is faced with a small upright slab of green schist. This slab is quite thin and appears to have been primarily decorative. Other such slabs, now destroyed and washed down the slope, may have lined the exterior walls. Except for a very small built section of wall located in an indentation in the bedrock, the north wall of the room consists of the cliff face that rises here 1.50 to 2.00 m. above the floor of the room. The western room is quite narrow, measuring ca. 0.74 m. at its north end. Unlike the eastern room, its northern wall was provided with a stone socle that rests on the rise in bedrock and runs between the central wall of the tomb and a bedrock outcropping at the west. A small stretch of the western wall is also preserved at the northwest corner.60 Both rooms have irregular bedrock floors, consisting of a colorful combination of purple schist and sideropetra with white calcite veins, that slope down towards the south. TOMB XXIII (P1. 25:a and b) Seager described this tomb as "long and narrow, with a doorway at the lower end" and gave its measurements as "length 2.80 m., width 1 m."61 The tomb in question meets this general description, and although it is nowhere quite so narrow as one meter, its internal measurements are approximately those that Seager provided. In general, Seager did not give accurate measurements for the South Slope tombs. Instead, he noted, "These tombs ... are always of about the same size, viz. 1 m. wide by 2 m. long. Therefore I have given no dimensions in describing them except in cases which are marked exceptions to this rule."62 In fact, all Seager's measurements are approximate. Seager reported that the walls of the tomb were "built partly of small upright slabs, partly of horizontal courses of small stones." Unfortunately, because of the destruction caused by the fall of a large boulder into the tomb and the damage done in removing it, large portions of the walls are destroyed. Nevertheless, this feature of Seager's description seems as if it would have matched the lost walls, since horizontal courses of small flat stones and a few small upright slabs are found in the walls at the north side of the tomb. There are, however, no large orthostate slabs. The tomb is a rectangular building. Its east and west walls project at right angles from the face of the cliff at the north, varying in length from ca. 3.30 m. on the east to ca. 4.30 m. on the west.63 The east wall is badly damaged towards the south and along the outer face. At the north it rests above the floor level on the part of the cliff face that projects into the tomb at this corner. At the south it ends in a large cornerstone and is joined by a short segment of wall 59 Tomb XIX, east room, east wall: L. ca. 1.30 m.; W. 0.47-0.75 m.; H. ca. 0.50 m.

The western wall of the tomb was also badly shattered at the south by the fall of the large boulder, and only the lowest course of the southern half of the wall remains. At the north the wall is better preserved: its upper portion rests on a low projecting foundation, two to three irregular courses high, which also serves as the threshold of an internal doorway (P1. 25:b). This sec- tion of the wall is also unusual in that it turns at right angles alongside the internal doorway it flanks and extends to the west about one meter along a projecting section of the cliff face. The main doorway of the tomb, located on the south, is flanked by two short walls that project south of it and form a small alcove or landing. Both projecting walls are relatively narrow and are built primarily of green and purple schist slabs; they form decorative piers on either side of the entrance. The alcove, ca. 1.24 m. long and 0.46-0.58 m. wide, is paved with a large, perfectly flat slab of green schist. It provides access to the doorway, which is also provided with a threshold slab of green schist. This entry opens into a room 2.72-3.04 m. deep and 1.26-1.42 m. wide. It is provided with an irregular bedrock floor that rises to the northeast where the cliff face projects into the room. The north wall of the room, which rests on this projection, is particularly in- teresting for the evidence it provides for roofing. It is built in two sections above the floor on natural ledges in the rock face.64 Each section is constructed of flat stones, horizontally laid one stone deep, and is separated from the other by a small gap filled with projecting bedrock. At neither end does the wall bond with the side walls of the tomb: it lies north of the west wall, and at its east end, inside the east wall. It cannot be considered a retaining wall, since none is required against a cliff face of sheer rock; its function can be explained only by the need to provide this side of the tomb with a vertical wall to support a roof. The highest preserved point of this wall lies ca. 1.80 m. above the level of the threshold at the entrance and indicates the minimum height for the roof. The internal doorway in the west wall opens onto a rock ledge, behind the adjacent Tomb A, that appears to have formed an additional inner room. Although the ledge lies 0.65 to 1.10 m. above the floor level of Tomb A, it could apparently be reached from there as well as from Tomb XXIII. It is bounded at the north by the irregular face of the rock cliff that rises several meters higher and at the west by a natural rise in bedrock that lies on the same north-south line as the built section of the western wall of Tomb A and could have provided a natural rock socle for a mud-brick wall. The floor of the ledge is relatively flat bedrock except at the east, where a depression before the doorway leading to Tomb XXIII was filled in with earth. Since both Tombs A and XXIII are provided with main entrances at the south, it is unclear whether they were originally designed to connect internally and form a unit or whether the internal doorway is a later modification. In Tomb XXIII, the course projecting from under the northern portion of the western wall and flush beneath its south- ern portion may represent the original line of this wall, which was altered when the door- way was opened into Tomb A. 64 Tomb XXIII, north wall: L. of west section ca. 0.80 m., of east section ca. 0.71 m.; total L. ca. 1.58 m.; W. 0.20-0.32 m.; H. of built west section ca. 0.79 m., of built east section ca. 0.40 m. 68</page><page sequence="89">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 7 TOMB A (P1. 26:a and b) The tomb lying immediately to the west of Tomb XXIII is one of the two empty ones on this terrace that Seager excavated and left unnumbered. Like all the others, it backs against the cliff face to the north, its east and west walls extending south from the cliff. The tomb is unusual in that it appears to incorporate the flat ledge in the face of the cliff at its rear and is, as a result, partly a natural rock formation and partly a built structure. Its maximum over- all dimensions, including this ledge, are ca. 3.90 m. east-west and ca. 4.60 m. north-south. The east wall of the tomb is the west wall of Tomb XXIII. Its south portion extends from the face of the ledge at the rear of the tomb, and its north portion lies on the higher level of the ledge itself. The west wall of the tomb is only partly constructed of masonry. The built section runs between the face of the ledge at the north and an outcropping of bedrock at the south that is used for the cornerstone of the west and south walls. Two irregular courses are preserved, set on a bedding of earth and small stones 0.20-0.30 m. thick. To the north, as noted above, level, stepped rises in the natural bedrock along the western side of the rock ledge continue the north-south line of the built section of wall and may well have served as natural stone socles for its mud-brick superstructure. The south wall of the tomb runs from the bedrock "cornerstone" at the southwest corner of the tomb parallel to the rock ledge at the rear. Only one course, containing a large amount of earth mortar, is preserved. At its east end, where it is widened on the inside, it leaves a space ca. 0.50 m. wide for a doorway at the southeast corner of the tomb.65 This doorway provides access to an irregular room on two levels, ca. 2.50 m. wide at the south. Its lower, southern part forms a rectangular space provided with a level floor of packed earth, while its upper, northern part extends back into the face of the cliff on a natu- ral rock ledge 0.65 to 1.10 m. above the lower part. There are no traces of any kind of intervening wall between these two levels, and the north wall was formed simply by the vertical rock face of the cliff that rises several meters above the ledge. TOMB B (Pls. 24:a and 26:c) Tomb B is the eastern of the two unnumbered tombs that flank Tomb XXIII and is located at the eastern end of the terrace at the point where the bedrock outcropping that runs along the eastern side of the South Slope begins to rise. The tomb, a one-room building ca. 2.70 m. wide (east-west), nestles against the rising bedrock and makes use of it in the construction of its walls and perhaps even its roof. All its walls are constructed of the usual flat stones laid in irregular horizontal courses, with a few small slabs occasionally placed upright, and they rest partly or entirely on bedrock outcroppings. Where the west wall extends from the face of the cliff that rises above the tomb to the north, it rests on an out- cropping ca. 0.45 m. above the floor of the tomb. At the south, where it lies at floor level, it extends ca. 0.68 m. south of the south facade of the tomb.

At its north end the wall rests on a small projecting ledge in the cliff face ca. 1 m. above floor level; at its south end the inner face rests on earth fill ca. 0.30 m. thick, while the outer face rests on the exterior bedrock ca. 1 m. above the floor. The south wall of the tomb is constructed in two parts on either side of the entrance. The western section, which forms a door jamb, is set back from the end of the west wall, which projects beyond it ca. 0.68 m. to the south and does not bond with it. The eastern section is built largely on the bedrock that rises to the east, while its inner face rests partly on an earth bedding ca. 0.28 m. thick.66 The entrance to the tomb is unusual for its resemblance to that of Tomb IV on the West Terrace. Like that entrance, it is set at the back of a small sheltered area or alcove, but in this case the alcove is partly natural. It is formed by the projecting section of west wall on the west and on the east by the outcropping of bedrock on which the east wall and the east end of the south wall are built. This outcropping projects ca. 1.54 m. south of the south wall and leaves a space ca. 1.20 m. wide between it and the west wall. The doorway, ca. 0.73 m. wide, is paved with a stone threshold consisting of one flat slab set diagonally in the door space and a fill of smaller stones to its northwest. It gives access to a room that is roughly L-shaped as a result of the projection of the cliff face at the northeast corner. The length of the room along the shorter eastern side is ca. 1.80 m., while along the western side, where the room extends farther back into the face of the cliff, it is ca. 2.32 m.; the width of the room at the south is ca. 1.65 m. but only ca. 0.68 m. at the northwest corner. Only part of the north wall is con- structed of masonry. At the northeast it is formed by the overhanging cliff face that formed part of the roof; at the northwest, where the indentation in the cliff face is located, it is formed by a single thickness of stone walling set above the floor. This wall abuts the north end of the west wall without bonding with it and joins the cliff face on the east. It is preserved to a height of only three courses but was probably originally built higher to meet the overhanging cliff above.67 The floor of the room appears to have been level packed earth at the south; at the north it is formed by the rising bedrock. During the 1971 cleaning, a small stratum, 0.08-0.20 m. deep, of burned material containing many carbon flecks was uncovered in the southeast corner of the tomb. It ap- peared to be an original stratum, since it extended beneath the walls at this corner of the tomb, and it included numerous undiagnostic sherds. Just outside the east wall, approxi- mately one meter above this burned area, were found fragments of mud brick baked by fire and made of the coarse red-brown clay, with traces of the original straw reinforcing, that is typical of Minoan mud brick.68 It is likely that this small area outside the east wall was left unexcavated by Seager and that these fragments belonged to the superstructure of the tomb along this side and were preserved by the fire of which traces are visible in the stratum at the southeast corner of the room. There are several indications that mud brick was used above 66 Tomb B, west wall: L. ca. 4.10 m.; W. 0.44-0.56 m.; H. including ledge at north end ca. 1.35 m.

BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY The burials from these tombs are not described by Seager. Tomb XIX, although one of the more modest of the Mochlos tombs in construction, was one of the richest in finds. In addition to quantities of gold jewelry and stone vases reported by Seager, it alone of the tombs in this row was reported to have contained any pottery: EM III sherds are reported, and four EM II vases are published. The vases include two fruitstands of dark brown burnished ware (XIX 1, 10) and two teapots of plain red ware (XIX 8, 9).69 The remaining tombs on this terrace had been plundered, but Seager be- lieved that all four should be dated to the same phases of EM II and III because of their location side by side in a row. The resemblance of the facade of Tomb B to that of Tomb IV and the similarity of the wall construction of this tomb and that of Tomb XXIII would sug- gest the same conclusion. In addition to the mud-brick fragments, the only finds made in the 1971 and 1976 cleaning were a quern and rubber from the southwest corner of Tomb A (M A-i and 2) and a stone vase from the southeast corner of Tomb XXIII (M XXlll-1). These finds were all uncovered at floor level in apparently unexcavated corners of the tombs and must have been among their original contents.

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Terrace 6, which lies 4 to 4.50 m. immediately below Terrace 7, extends somewhat far- ther east and west (Plan 3). It measures ca. 37 meters in length and varies in width from ca. 4.30 m. at its west end to ca. 9.40 m. at the east. It is bounded on the west by the steep drop in bedrock that falls to the level of the West Terrace and on the east by the rise in bed- rock that flanks the east side of the South Slope. It is well defined on the north by bedrock outcroppings that rise to the level of Terrace 7. Five tombs are preserved on this terrace: two at the western end, one near the middle, and two at the eastern end. There are no traces of others, although there is ample space for at least three more in the areas to either side of the middle tomb. The preserved tombs resemble those on the terrace above in that they back against a rise in bedrock and open onto a narrow corridor to the south. At the west end of the terrace, this corridor was completely exposed and is still intact. It is quite narrow, as little as 0.70 m. in width, and is formed by level packed earth held in by the north wall of the tomb on the terrace below. The tombs at the west end of the terrace may be identified without any doubt as Seager's Tombs XX and XXI, which form a single unit like the tomb complexes on the West Terrace, and Tomb XXII, while those at the east end are most likely Tombs IX and X. The tomb in the middle was probably not identified as such by Seager because of its poor state of preservation and may not even have been excavated by him; it is identified here as Tomb r. The tombs at the west end of the terrace were still largely exposed when they were cleaned by the author in 1971. The tombs at the east end and in the middle of the terrace, on 72</page><page sequence="93">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 6 the other hand, had been completely reburied since Seager's excavation. They were cleaned by the Greek Archaeological Service in 1976. TOMBS XX/XXI AND XXII (Figs. 28 and 29, P1. 27) These tombs, which lie side by side at the west end of the terrace, receive the most detailed description of any of the small tombs in Seager's publication, and their identification here is certain. Tomb XXII, which is described as "a very narrow grave or rather trench lying just outside the west wall of No. XX,"70 is the westernmost of the tombs and is located at the very edge of the cliff that drops down to Tomb Complex I/II/III on the West Terrace. Tomb XX/XXI, which is described incorrectly as two tombs by Seager, lies immediately to the east. Seager believed that a MM III tomb, XX, cut into an earlier EM II/III tomb, XXI. He noted that the later tomb lay next to the earlier, which was located "along the face of the adjacent cliff,"71 and that it re-used the south wall of the original tomb, which was broken by a doorway, and perhaps also its west wall. He believed, however, that the east wall of XX, "a wall of small stones," was a later addition that cut the original tomb in half. At the same time, he noted that if the east wall of XX was a later addition and if the west wall of XX was indeed the original west wall of XXI, then "the original enclosure was a large one, about 2 m. square."72 All these features (the adjacent cliff, the doorway in the south wall, the wall of small stones) may be observed in the tomb cleaned in 1971. Seager's error lay in identifying the east wall of XX as a later addition when in fact it served as an interior partition wall in the original tomb and was required to support the roof of the original tomb, the south facade of which actually extends ca. 3.70 m. east-west, not the two meters estimated by Seager. The tomb is a single building, then, which was used initially in the EM II and III phases (XX/XXI) and re-used in the MM III phase (XX). The tomb is a two-room rectangular structure set against a natural L-shaped nook in the face of the cliff that rises above it on the north and east and provides natural rock walls on these two sides. The eastern section of rock projects southwards from the northern sec- tion almost at right angles, and it is this section that Seager called the "adjacent cliff". The south wall runs parallel to the face of the cliff at the north side of the tomb and joins the adjacent rock projection at its east end. This wall is built of ordinary rubble with a doorway in the center dividing it into two sections.73 The east section, which is complete, terminates at the doorway in a large, nearly square block, while the west section ends in small, irregu- larly placed stones that suggest that this jamb of the doorway may be only partially preserved. At the southeast corner of the tomb, where an indentation in the rock face of the cliff leaves a small gap between the south wall and the solid rock that forms the east side of the tomb, a short section of wall was built at right angles to the south wall. Its inner side is faced with one oblong, upright slab, the only upright slab in the walls of the tomb, and Seager's use of the expression "slab-lined" to describe XX/XXI differs from his application 70 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 78. 71 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 74. 72 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 76. 73 Tomb XX/XXI, south wall: L. of east section ca. 2.10 m., of west section ca. 1.67 m.; W. 0.50-0.63 m.; H. including bedding ca. 0.69 m. 73</page><page sequence="94">A 2 2&amp;46 I I I I z5.36 I 1 I I I I B 0 1 2 3M.

Section AB through Mochlos Tombs XX/XXI and XIII on South Slope Terraces 6 and 5 of the term to the large tombs on the West Terrace with their orthostate slabs. At its west end the south wall is bonded with the built section of west wall, and the outer angle where these two walls join, the southwest corner of the tomb, is strengthened by a single large block. The bonding of these two walls confirms the "possibility" suggested by Seager that the west wall is contemporary with the south wall and formed part of the original tomb. The west wall, only part of which is built of masonry, rests at a slightly higher level than the south wall, on bedrock instead of earth fill, because of the rise of the bedrock floor along this side of the tomb. Midway, the wall overlies and was actually built upon projecting rock, which rises here in three steps to meet the cliff face along the north side of the tomb. The north end of the built section of wall rests on the lowest of these steps, while the rock itself forms the rest of the west wall (although one loose stone, lying on the second step, may have belonged to an extension of the built wall). At the north end of this projecting stepped ledge, in the right angle formed where it meets the north side of the tomb, a small, nearly square pier is built up on a natural horizontal ledge rising a total of ca. 1.40 m. above the bedrock floor. This pier, although structurally independent, forms the north end of the west wall.74 The doorway in the south wall, ca. 1.08 m. wide as preserved, provides access to two rooms of approximately equal dimensions (PI. 27:b). The doorway is peculiarly situated, however, since it opens onto the internal dividing wall and onto both rooms equally instead 74 Tomb XX/XXI, built section of east wall: L. ca. 0.32 m.; W. ca. 0.32 m.; H. ca. 1.10 m.

The internal dividing wall, which runs approximately parallel to the east and west sides of the tomb, is built with a double course of "small stones", as observed by Seager, and is considerably narrower than the outer walls of the tomb. It rests on an earth bedding 0.05-0.21 m. thick, and it is appar- ently this bedding and the early gold beads caught in it at the northwest that prompted Seager to consider the wall a later addition. In fact, this bedding is not much higher than that on which the south wall rests, and it represents not later fill in the tomb but the original floor level created where bedrock falls away. At the south the wall is incomplete, although it is not likely that it continued much farther; at the north it is built up with eight additional courses of flat stones to form a vertical pier set against the cliff face and rising a total of ca. 1.34 m. above floor level.75 This central north pier is located on the same line as that in the northwest corner of the tomb, and both are in line with a natural ledge in the rock face at the northeast corner. The three features are all approximately the same height and clearly formed the vertical supports for an important horizontal roof beam that ran along this side of the tomb. The internal partition wall to the south of the north pier, as preserved, forms a level horizontal surface which most likely supported a mud-brick superstructure, and the outer walls of the tomb on the south and west must also have supported such a super- structure that rose at tleast as high as the piers at the north side. The room to the west of the internal partition measures ca. 2.55 m. north-south and ca. 1.37 m. across its center; its bedrock floor slopes down from west to east. The room east of the partition measures ca. 2.70 m. north-south and ca. 1.98 m. across its center. Its bedrock floor slopes upwards slightly from west to east, and along the east side and the northeast corner, bedrock projects into the tomb at a higher level. All the bedrock is quite colorful and includes veins of green and purple schists as well as sideropetra with white chlorite. At the northwest corner of the eastern room is "a crevice of the rock near the back" noted by Seager, which contained the richest deposit of EM II/III material in the tomb.76 Tomb XXII, as Seager observed, is a narrow rectangular tomb lying just outside the west wall of Tomb XX (PI. 27:c). It occupies the small area between Tomb XX and the edge of the cliff that falls straight down here to the West Terrace. The tomb is a one-room structure oriented in the same direction as the tomb next to it. Its north wall is formed by the face of the cliff that rises above it, while its west and east walls, running south from the cliff face, are constructed in normal rubble fashion and probably formed low socles for mud- brick superstructures. The east wall, lying only ca. 0.20 m. from the west wall of Tomb XX, is constructed on a ledge in the cliff ca. 0.48 m. above the floor level. At its south end it is largely destroyed; at the north it joins the same projecting rock that the west wall of Tomb XX joins, in such a way that the northeast corner of the tomb is also formed by the rock face. There is also a natural ledge in the rock face at this corner, rising ca. 1.30 m. above the floor, which could have supported a roof beam running east-west. The entire length of the west 75 Tomb XX/XXI, central partition wall: L. ca. 2.05 m.; W. ca. 0.37 m.; H. including bedding ca. 0.40 m.

It is located in the space between the internal partition wall and the projecting bedrock on the east. 76</page><page sequence="97">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 6 wall is preserved and rests directly on the bedrock floor.77 Bonded with the base of this wall at the south and running at right angles to it is what appears to be a fragment of south wall, only three stones of which remain but which may originally have partially enclosed the tomb at this end, forming the jamb of a doorway. The south end of the tomb opens into a space ca. 1.91 m. long and ca. 1.13 m. wide at its center. It is provided with a bedrock floor that slopes down from north to south. TOMB r (Fig. 30, P1. 28) Near the middle of Terrace 6 still another tomb is located in the area of the cemetery that has suffered most from erosion. It is a rectangular one-room building in a very poor state of preservation. Very little of the structure remains, but the tomb is nevertheless an important example of the architecture of the cemetery. Its south wall is completely de- stroyed, and its contents were presumably washed down the slope long ago. If Seager exca- vated the tomb, and there is some evidence that he did not, it is doubtful that he would have mentioned it. It does not match any of the descriptions that he provided for the numbered tombs in his publication. Like Tomb A on the terrace above, hi tomb appears to have made use of two levels of bedrock. The upper, northernmost level is a ledge lying 0.50-0.60 m. above the lower and surrounded on the north, east, and west by the rock cliff that rises several meters to the level of the seventh terrace. It forms an irregular space at one side of the tomb, ca. 3.65 m. wide across its southern side and 1.00-1.55 m. deep. The lower part of the tomb appears to have been roughly rectangular; at each side of this section, built walls project from the face of the ledge. At the east only two large stones, which may once have formed orthostate blocks, remain. The western wall, on the other hand, appears to be largely intact. At its south end it terminates in one large boulder of sideropetra set upright on a course of small stones, while the part of the wall between this boulder and the bedrock ledge to the north is built in ordinary rubble.78 At the time of the 1976 cleaning white plaster still adhered to the north part of the wall; it also extended onto the northwest corner of the floor. No trace of the south wall remains, but it is likely that the entry would have been located somewhere along this side as it is in each of the other tombs on the terrace. It would have provided access to a room ca. 3.80 m. wide at its rear and ca. 1.84 m. deep on the west. There is no evidence for any internal wall, and there was apparently, as in Tomb A, direct access from the lower part of the tomb on the south to the rear upper part. The lower part of the tomb used plaster on earth for its floor, while the upper part used the rock ledge. In the 1976 cleaning, dozens of small rounded stones were uncovered in the lower part of the tomb; they may have formed some kind of additional flooring (PI. 28:a). Fragments of a pithos were also found in this room (M F-I). 77 Tomb XXII, east wall: L. of built section ca. 1.86 m.; W. 0.40-0.68 m.; H. including ledge ca. 0.84 m.

Plan of Mochlos Tombs IX and X on South Slope Terrace 6 TOMBS IX AND X (Figs. 26 and 31, PI. 29) These tombs are located against the bedrock outcroppings that rise at the eastern end of Terrace 6. They are located side by side and share a single dividing wall. Each is provided with a doorway opening to the south, and on the inside a third doorway, located at the northern end of the dividing wall, provides direct access from one tomb to the other. In this respect, the building resembles Tombs A and XXIII on the terrace above and forms a kind of double tomb. In addition to the tombs on the seventh terrace, which have already been identified, Seager described only two other groups of tombs that lie adjacent to one another: 0 I I - I I I -I 79 -I t i I t - I I I I I</page><page sequence="100">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY IX, X and XV, XVII. If the identification of the other tombs is correct, then these two tombs at the east end of the sixth terrace and those lying immediately to the south of them on the fifth terrace, which also lie side by side, are the only candidates. Two facts suggest that those on Terrace 6 should be identified as IX and X. First, Seager described IX, X as "slab- lined" and XV, XVII as "built tombs", and indeed, upright slabs are placed along the base of the interior dividing wall here, whereas none are to be found in the two tombs on the terrace below. Second, a third tomb lies next to the two on the terrace below, and wherever three tombs cluster together Seager used consecutive numbers to identify them: I, II, III; IV, V, VI; or XX, XXI, XXII. Since the third tomb on the fifth terrace cannot be Seager's VII (which is a rock shelter) or XI (which has no doorway) but does match Seager's description of XVI, the three tombs on this terrace should be XV, XVI, and XVII. Partly by a process of elimination, then, the two tombs at the east end of the sixth terrace may be identified as IX and X. There is no way of knowing which should be IX and which X, however, and the western is here designated IX, the eastern X, simply for the sake of convenience. The tombs were built together and form a unit, the southern facade of which is ca. 4.90 m. wide. This is the only side of the building that would have been completely exposed at ground level, since the remaining three sides of the structure are built against rock out- croppings, and as a result it is here that the main doorways are located. They lie alongside each other in the same fashion as the doorways in the faCade of Tomb I and are separated like them by a projecting, monolithic pier of sideropetra that forms the southern end of the wall between the two tombs. The western doorway leading into Tomb IX also resembles the doorway of Tomb IV. Its two jambs, each constructed with courses of flat stones, are set back a short distance from the ends of the east and west side walls; they project from these walls without bonding with them and leave a space ca. 0.94 m. wide for the doorway. The east and west walls of the tomb thus form a small alcove in front of the entrance. This doorway provides access to an L-shaped room ca. 4.30 m. long, ca. 2.66 m. wide at the north, and ca. 1.56 m. wide at the south (PI. 29:b and c). It is provided with an irregular bedrock floor that rises in the short leg of the L at the northwest corner of the room. The southern part of the western wall, which is built of roughly horizontal courses of flat stones, lies at the base of the rock slope that rises along this side. The northern part of the wall jogs west and then returns to the north until it meets the bedrock cliff along the north side of the tomb. This northern section, now largely destroyed, rested above the floor level on the rising bedrock slope itself. While the west wall appears to have been freestanding at its southern end, at the north it served partly as a retaining wall that held back the earth of the seventh terrace and supported the passage running in front of Tomb XXIII, from which one could have walked directly onto the roof of the tomb if one chose.79 The north wall of the room, which is destroyed at its west end, is built up only at its base with similar courses rising approximately one meter in height. At this point it meets the overhanging face of the bed- rock cliff that forms the upper part of the wall and rises over three meters above floor level. A small rectangular niche built into the middle of the wall (PI. 29:b) lies ca. 0.65 m. above floor level, measures ca. 0.55 by 0.46 by 0.44 m., and is closed above by the overhanging 79 Tomb IX, west wall: p.L. ca. 3.80 m.; L. of east-west section ca. 1.40 m.; W. ca. 0.56 m.; H. ca. 1.35 m.

During the 1976 cleaning, fragments of a large stone vase (M IX-3) were found in this niche in a previously unexcavated deposit. The eastern wall of the tomb, the central wall of the building, is the most impressively constructed. It is decorated with two upright slabs of sideropetra placed to form orthostates at its base near the southern end, and it employs many flat stones of green and purple schist set in rough horizontal courses. At the south it terminates in the large monolithic pier noted above. At the north, where it rests on rising bedrock, it breaks off to form a doorway ca. 0.40 m. wide opening into the adjacent tomb. The bottom two courses of the wall project here beneath the doorway to form the southern part of the threshold, while rising bedrock alone forms the northern part; this is still another detail of construction in this tomb that finds a close parallel in Tomb IV. The threshold is raised ca. 0.68 m. above the floor level of Tomb IX but lies flush with the higher floor level at the northern end of Tomb X.80 The easternmost tomb, here designated Tomb X, may be entered through the interior doorway from IX or from its main entry in the south faCade, which is located between two short walls that form the jambs of a doorway ca. 0.75 m. wide. The west jamb is set back behind the projecting pier at the south end of the interior partition wall, and like the jambs at the entrance of Tomb IX it is constructed of flat stones and does not bond with the wall from which it projects. The eastern jamb of the doorway is bonded with the short built section of the eastern wall, which runs at right angles to it. The doorway opens into a long irregular room, ca. 5.76 m. deep, that narrows towards the north. The room is tucked against the bedrock cliff that terminates the terrace and uses the natural rock face, which rises here over four meters above the floor level, for most of its north and east walls. Along the east side the face of the cliff is smooth and fairly perpen- dicular except at its base, where it curves under, and at the south, where it curves outwards to the east. A small stretch of wall was constructed at this point, at the south end of the cliff, in order to fill the indentation.81 At the north end of the room, where a small crevice opens in the cliff, four stone courses are built up to fill the gap. They form a kind of pier between the diverging sides of the crevice and rise ca. 1.60 m. above the floor level at this end of the tomb. They appear to be complete and may therefore indicate the original level of the roof. A series of natural holes in the rock cliff to the east runs at about the same height and may have served as sockets for roof supports at this level. The floor of the room lies at two levels: at the southeast, just inside the entrance, it is formed by level earth; at the southwest and to the north, by outcroppings of green and purple schist. Near the center, between these two levels, a built stone step, ca. 0.40 m. high, leads up to the higher floor level in the northern, rear section of the room.

The finds made during cleaning in 1971 and 1976 have been helpful in clarifying the date of all the tombs on this terrace, and all may be dated now to the Prepalatial period, most to the EM II phase. Seager reported MM I and Neopalatial finds from Tombs IX and X but remarked at the same time that the tombs must have been built earlier: "Both these tombs appear to have been plundered in the M.M. period, inasmuch as their type of construction is of much earlier date (E.M. II or III) than any objects which they contained."83 The ortho- state slabs at the base of the interior party wall, as well as the design of the doorways (espe- cially in Tomb IX, which parallels the doorway of Tomb IV so closely), point to an EM II date for the construction of the tombs. In addition, the four stone vases found in the tombs in 1976 date to the Prepalatial period in manufacture. At least one, a small bowl of green chlorite schist (M IX-1), should be dated to the EM II phase. It was found in a small unex- cavated pocket at the base of the central party wall in Tomb IX together with M IX-2 and 4 and a small number of undiagnostic sherds; it may represent the remains of an original EM II deposit in the tomb. The interior doorway at the north end of the central party wall indi- cates that the two tombs were built as a unit and must be contemporary in date. The finds from Tombs XX/XXI and XXII suggest that they too were built in the EM II phase and used well into the Prepalatial period; like Tombs IX and X they were re- opened, plundered, and re-used for further burials in the Neopalatial period. Although Seager dated the burial on the western side of XX/XXI to the MM III phase, he noted that the only two clay vases found on this side (XX 1 and 6) "must be referred to an earlier interment."84 These vases, as well as the three published from the east side of the tomb (XXI 5, 11, 12), belong to the EM II and III phases. Vessel XX 1 is similar in shape to the EM II spouted goblet from Tomb VI (VI 11), although more carelessly made, and XXI 11 by shape and decoration should belong to the Koumasa style.85 Vases XX 6 and XXI 5 are painted in the white-on-black style of the EM III phase.86 Early finds came from both west (XX) and east (XXI) sides, then; they apparently covered the whole area of the tomb originally and indicate the date of its construction and initial use. Only the western side of the tomb was re-used in the MM III phase. Seager found no pottery in Tomb XXII and dated the tomb to the LM I phase of the Neopalatial period on the basis of the gold jewelry he found there. During the 1971 cleaning, however, two small pottery deposits that should be associated with the original contents were found outside its west wall. One vase (M XXTI-1) from the northern deposit belongs to the EM II phase, and the vase from the southern deposit (M XXTT-2) belongs to the MM Ia phase. The contents of these deposits 82 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 76. 83 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 58. 84 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 74. 85 For Seager's "gourd" shape compare VI 15 (Mochlos II, p. 52, figs. 22, 23); for a general description of such jugs see Wilson, BSA 80, 1985, pp. 319-330. 86 The shape of XX 6 is compared to the EM III cup from Tomb IV, IV 2; XXI 5 is discussed by Zois (Kamares-Stil, pp. 164-165). 82</page><page sequence="103">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 6 represent remains thrown out of the tomb when it was reopened and cleared for re-use in the Neopalatial period. The construction date of Tomb F is less clear because the only pottery from the tomb is the fragmentary MM Ia pithos found in 1976. The similarity in design to Tomb A, imme- diately above it, suggests an early date; the use of plaster on the walls, however, which does not appear to have come into general practice in tombs until the MM Ia phase, points to a date later in the Prepalatial period.

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Terrace 5 lies from one to four meters below the level of Terrace 6 (Plan 3). It is ter- minated by the same boundaries on the east and west and extends for approximately the same distance, ca. 35.30 m. Four tombs are preserved on the terrace, one at its western end lying just below Tombs XX/XXI and XXII and three at its eastern end lying below Tombs IX and X. The area between probably accommodated three or four additional tombs, and a great amount of loose rubble lying there today may have belonged to tombs that are now destroyed. At the east end of the terrace, the corridor that ran along the terrace is still pre- served. It is supported on the south by the rear wall of the tomb lying on the terrace below and measures ca. 1.80 m. in width. The tombs at this end of the terrace, each provided with a doorway, open onto the corridor; they are probably to be identified as Seager's Tombs XV, XVI, and XVII. The tomb at the western end of the terrace should probably be identified as Tomb XIII. All four of the tombs had been completely reburied by the time they were cleaned in the 1970's. Tomb XIII was cleaned by the author in 1971, and XV, XVI, and XVII were cleaned by the Greek Archaeological Service in 1976. TOMB XIII (Figs. 28 and 29, Pls. 27:a and 32:a). This tomb, located at the westernmost edge of the terrace, lies just below Tomb XX/XXI across the narrow corridor that runs between its rear wall and the facade of XX/XXI. Because it may be described as "slab-lined", it might be either of two tombs so described by Seager that remain to be identified, XIII or XVI; but because it has no readily apparent doorway and XVI is reported to have a doorway, it should be Tomb XIII. The tomb is a one-room, rectangular building. It is unusual in that it is one of only three tombs in the entire cemetery that does not appear to have had a doorway at ground level. Its north wall, the best preserved, is set as a retaining wall against the corridor of Terrace 6. It is constructed with five large orthostate slabs at its base, using sideropetra as well as green and purple schist in an especially colorful combination, and is identical in this respect to the walls of the large tombs on the West Terrace. It rises to the height of the corridor behind it and provides an even socle at this level, apparently completely preserved, for a low mud- brick superstructure that probably rose another 50 centimeters or so. Pottery of the EM III phase (M XIII-1) was found at the foot of this wall during the 1971 cleaning.87 The east and west walls, both of which bond with the north wall at right angles, are less well preserved and less impressively built with smaller, flat stones. The east wall rests on a bedrock ledge that runs along this side of the tomb and rises to a height of ca. 0.67 m. above floor level at the northeast corner. At the north end one small upright slab rests on the ledge; at the south end, where the bedrock ledge descends in small steps, the wall is missing. The west wall, which is considerably narrower than the other walls of the tomb, rests directly on 87 Tomb XIII, north wall: L. ca. 4.16 m.; W. 0.45-0.65 m.; H. on inside ca. 1.34 m.

It runs parallel to and only one meter from the edge of the cliff that drops to the West Terrace.88 The south wall of the tomb, also poorly preserved, appears to have been substantially constructed with large stones. It runs at a slightly acute angle to the west wall between two rock outcroppings at either corner and terminates on the east well inside and to the west of the east wall. It lies at the lowest level of the walls in a rather precarious position where the face of the island slopes more steeply towards the sea, and it appears to have been especially widened, an- chored between bedrock outcroppings, and perhaps buttressed by larger stones on the outer south side in order to strengthen it against the slope.89 The tomb could have been entered from the upper corridor of Terrace 6 through a doorway in the mud-brick superstructure or by a trap door in the roof; in either case, how- ever, there would have been a considerable drop to floor level. It could also have been ap- proached from the ledge at the southeast corner of the tomb where the bedrock outcropping forms a fairly level landing. Because of the inward slant of the south wall, the room itself is trapezoidal, ca. 2.97 m. long east-west, ca. 2.29 m. wide at the west, and narrowing to ca. 1.29 m. at the east. The bedrock that slopes down from west to east forms an even rock floor. TOMBS XV, XVI, AND XVII (Figs. 26 and 36, Pls. 32:b and c, and 33:a and b) These three tombs, located at the eastern end of the terrace beneath Tombs IX and X on the terrace above, are tucked against the bedrock that rises above them here on the north and east. Each is provided with a doorway that opens towards the south onto the narrow passage running in front. Each is built up against the next: the two to the west are separated by a double wall; the two to the east share a common dividing wall. The westernmost tomb is built with massive stone walls that use orthostate slabs; the eastern tombs have walls of ordinary rubble. Seager described a pair of tombs "lying beside" one another: XV and XVII. He noted that both are "built" tombs and that XV "lay against the face of a small cliff." The two easternmost tombs on this terrace are the only tombs not otherwise identified that meet this description. Neither has orthostate slabs in its walls, yet each is a built tomb, and the more eastern lies against the face of a small cliff. It should be identified as XV, therefore, and the one to its west as XVII. Tomb XVI, which Seager described as "a slab- lined tomb with a doorway at the south end," should be identified with the westernmost of the three, since it is the only remaining tomb that matches this description and since Seager numbered tombs consecutively wherever they are clustered together, as these are, in groups of three.90 The westernmost tomb, XVI, is the largest and the most substantial (PI. 32:b and c). Its exterior walls appear to have been constructed entirely in stone and still stand to an impres- sive height. Both the eastern and western walls project from the face of the cliff rising on the northern side of the tomb and rest here on higher bedrock than on the south. The interior face of the west wall is constructed with a few small slabs set upright at its base; its exterior, 88 Tomb XIII, east wall: p.L. ca. 1.25 m.; W. ca. 0.63 m.; H. including ledge ca. 1.18 m.

At its south end the wall turns to the east to form the western jamb of the doorway.92 The inner face of the eastern wall is constructed with two upright slabs of sideropetra at its base, one of which is as large as any of those in Tomb Complex IV/V/VI,93 but neither of which has their distinctively smooth face.

At the south the wall ends in line with the west jamb of the tomb and with the fagades of the tombs to the east. The eastern jamb of the doorway is set at right angles to the eastern wall at this point, but unlike the west jamb does not bond with it.94 The doorway, ca. 0.87 m. wide, opens onto a rectangular room ca. 1.92 m. wide at its south end and ca. 3.50 m. long at the west side. It is provided with an irregular bedrock floor that rises at the northwest a good 0.90 m. above the floor level at the entrance. A narrow spur wall, projecting from the cliff at the north and running parallel to the west and east walls of the tomb, divides the rear of the room in two; the doorway, like that of Tomb XX/XXI, opens directly onto the spur wall at the center of the room rather than at one corner. The southern part of the spur wall is destroyed, but as its primary function was probably to provide additional roof support at the north end of the tomb, it may not have extended far.95 It partitions the rear part of the tomb into two rather narrow compartments. The eastern compartment, ca. 0.80 m. wide, is provided on its northern side with a thick built wall that fills an irregular indentation in the rock cliff.96 The western compartment, ca. 0.63 m. wide, uses the natural bedrock for its northern wall; it extends beneath an overhanging rock in the face of the cliff and is as a result somewhat deeper than the eastern compartment. The tomb adjacent to the east, XVII, is also constructed with two side walls that project from the face of the cliff (PI. 33:b). Unlike those in Tomb XVI, however, they do not appear to have been built wholly in rubble. The western side wall is built up against the east wall of XVI with its outer, west face preserved to a higher level than its inner, east face. It is set directly against the eastern wall of XVI and runs the same length.97 The eastern wall, which extends from bedrock that projects into the tomb at the north, is somewhat shorter than the western wall; it is also much lower, with only one or two stone courses preserved, and probably supported an upper section of mud brick.98 At its south end it widens to form the eastern jamb of the doorway. There is no corresponding jamb on the west, and the door- way is formed by the intervening space between this jamb and the end of the western wall. This doorway, ca. 0.60 m. wide, opens onto one corner of a rectangular space ca. 1.13 m. wide at the south end and ca. 2.40 m. long at the west side. Like Tomb XVI, it is divided at the rear into two narrow compartments by a spur wall projecting from the cliff. As preserved, this spur wall is only one course high and one course wide.99 It runs alongside a rise in the bedrock floor at the eastern side of the tomb and once probably extended as far as the middle of the room to the point where the bedrock drops off. The space to the west of this wall, entered directly from the outer doorway, is only about 0.65 m. wide. It is provided with a fairly level earth floor and uses the face of the cliff, which rises about two meters 94 Tomb XVI, east jamb: L. ca. 0.48 m.; W. ca. 1.00 m.; H. ca. 0.44 m. 95 Tomb XVI, central spur wall: p.L. ca. 0.82 m.; W. ca. 0.50 m.; H. ca. 0.64 m. 96 Tomb XVI, north wall, eastern room: L. ca. 1.32 m.; W. ca. 0.65 m.; H. ca. 1.64 m. 97 Tomb XVII, west wall: L. ca. 3.60 m.; W. ca. 0.50 m.; H. at north ca. 1.42 m., at south ca. 0.78 m. 98 Tomb XVII, east wall: L. ca. 2.98 m.; W. 0.34-0.40 m., at south ca. 0.84 m.; H. ca. 0.78 m. 99 Tomb XVII, central spur wall: L. ca. 0.60 m.; W. ca. 0.22 m.; H. ca. 0.27 m. 90</page><page sequence="111">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 5 above floor level, for its rear wall. The space to the east of the dividing wall is much smaller and more irregular. The northern rock face is much lower here; a built wall rests on top of it, forming the north wall of the compartment and a retaining wall against the terrace above. The compartment is provided with an irregular bedrock floor ca. 0.30 m. higher than that of the western compartment. Tomb XV, the easternmost of the three under discussion, is a small one-room tomb. The east wall of XVII is its western wall, and the face of the adjacent bedrock cliff bor- dering the South Slope forms its eastern wall (PI. 33:a). A pier of stones is attached to the cliff at the east, in line with the south facades of Tombs XVI and XVII, and forms the only built section of the south face.100 An opening ca. 0.80 m. wide between it and the wall to the west serves as the doorway to XV. The room itself is a small rectangular space ca. 1.85 m. deep and 1.16-1.32 m. wide at floor level. The bedrock cliff that forms the east wall rises over three meters above floor level: at the south, just inside the entrance, it rises vertically; at the north the upper part of the cliff projects ca. 1.06 m. above floor level, forming a small sheltered area beneath its overhang. The north wall of the room is a built wall that does not bond with the western wall of the tomb and forms an even face against the rising bedrock and earth of the terrace behind.101 BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY The burials from these tombs are not described by Seager. Tombs XIII and XVI contained pottery of the EM II, EM III, and MM Ia phases. They appear to have been built in the EM II phase (to judge from the method of construc- tion, at its very beginning) and to have been used continuously to the end of the Prepalatial period. Seager reported three vases of red and black burnished ware from Tomb XIII (XIII a, b, c), wares especially common in the EM II phase.102 The side-spouted jug (XIII c) belongs to a type of vase that was popular on Mochlos at this time and has a close parallel in the jug found outside Tomb XXII in 1971 (M XXTI-1, p. 85 above). Seager also published an anthropomorphic rhyton from this tomb (XIII g), modeled in the shape of a Minoan goddess, which has a good parallel from Mallia.103 Both examples are painted in typical EM III white-on-dark styles. During the 1971 cleaning of Tomb XIII, an EM III cup with very similar decoration (M XIII-1) was found with fragments of similar cups at the foot of the north wall (P.71.8 and 9, see p. 92 below). Seager also published two side-spouted jugs (XIII h, j) from the tomb, one with MM Ia "plume" decoration, the other with characteris- tically fugitive MM Ia paint.104 He reported two EM II vases from Tomb XVI: a fruit- stand of black burnished ware (XVI 10) and a "small cover of ... polished buff ware with 00 Tomb XV, south wall: L. ca. 0.61 m.; W. 0.40-0.54 m.; H. ca. 0.46 m. 10' Tomb XV, north wall: L. ca. 1.10 m.; H. ca. 1.10 m. 102 For the black burnished ware see G 1-15 and 16, p. 13; for the red burnished ware see Wilson, BSA 80, 1985, p. 317. 103 Demargne, Mallia, N&amp;cropoles I, p. 14, pls.

II or E.M. III period" on the basis of their stone vases. In 1976 a small deposit of EM II pottery was found in Tomb XV. Located in an unexcavated area at floor level just below the middle of the east wall, it included fragments of two large basins (M XV-1) and a Vasilike-ware teapot (M XV-2) and confirms an EM II date for the construction of the tomb. To judge from the other finds reported by Seager, the tomb continued to be used in the MM Ia phase of the Prepalatial period and was then re-used in the Neopalatial period. In 1976 fragments of a MM Ia side-spouted jug (M XVII-1) were found in an unexcavated area of Tomb XVII, and it is clear that this tomb was also used in the Prepalatial period. Its stone vases suggest a construction date early in the EM II phase.107 It seems likely, then, that all the tombs on this terrace were built in the EM II phase and used to the end of the Prepalatial period. Tomb XV is exceptional in that it, or some part of it, appears to have been reopened and re-used for burials in the Neopalatial period. CATALOGUE Tomb XIII VESSEL Pottery M XIII-1 (Ag.Nik.Mus. 4378).

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION This terrace is preserved only at its eastern end, where a single tomb is located, and it is not clear how far it extended to the west (Plan 3). The slope of the hill is rather steep be- neath Tomb XIII, and it is doubtful that the terrace extended this far. It would have been somewhat shorter in length, therefore, than the terraces immediately above and below, per- haps extending no more than 30 meters in all. At its east end it lies ca. 1.30 m. below the level of Terrace 5. While only one tomb is preserved on the terrace today, three or four others could have been accommodated in the space to the west. TOMB XI (Figs. 26 and 40, P1. 34:a) The tomb preserved at the eastern end of the terrace, lying immediately below Tomb XVI, was cleaned by the Greek Archaeological Service in 1976. Its western wall and part of its south wall are destroyed, but the tomb appears to have been approximately square with an interior dimension of ca. 1.90 m. north-south. The walls are of ordinary rubble con- struction. Seager described one such tomb, Tomb XI, with which this tomb should be iden- tified. He called it "an enclosure 2 m. square with low walls built of small stones" and noted that "apparently there was no doorway, but at one point the wall had given away owing to pressure from the soil above." The only other tombs that might fit this description are Tombs XIII and F. Tomb XIII uses orthostate slabs in its walls, however, while XI does not. Tomb r does not appear to have been excavated before 1976; in any case it has barely any built walls left at all and is more rectangular than square. In addition, during the 1976 cleaning of the tomb at the eastern end of Terrace 4, numerous fragments of green-schist bowls, like the examples reported by Seager from Tomb XI, were uncovered. The tomb is situated east of a smooth bedrock outcropping that slopes down towards the east into its interior. The north and south walls are bedded on this outcropping on the west and rest at a much lower ground level on the east. No trace of any built walls remains on the west side of the tomb, and this side may always have been open; however, since the bedrock rises nearly to the height of the north and east walls along this side, a stone socle of a single course or two would have sufficed. The north and east walls are the best preserved, and the north wall, with a fairly level surface over its entire length, may survive to its original 94</page><page sequence="115">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 4 \~ O y 0 I 2M FIG. 40. Plan of Mochlos Tomb XI on South Slope Terrace 4 height.108 It rises to the level of Terrace 5 and serves as a retaining wall against its earth fill. The east wall is preserved to the same height at the northeast corner, and both walls proba- bly supported a mud-brick superstructure at this level. Only a small stretch of the south wall is preserved at the center of the south side.109 As Seager noted, there is no apparent doorway to the tomb. It was probably located in the customary fashion along the southern side of the tomb, at the southeast or southwest, where the wall has given way and been destroyed. It may, however, have been located at the western side of the tomb, where the bedrock outcropping forms a natural threshold, or access may have been by way of a trap door in the roof, which was easily reached from the terrace above. Consisting of a single room measuring ca. 1.90 by ca. 3.10 m. at its center, the tomb is provided with a sloping bedrock floor along the west side and a paved floor of care- fully laid flat slabs along the lower, east side.110 During the 1976 cleaning, numerous small rounded stones like those found in Tomb F on Terrace 6 were uncovered, some at floor level; they may have been used as flooring in the area between the sloping bedrock floor on the west and the paved floor on the east, or as flooring for later burial levels in the tomb. 108 Tomb XI, north wall: p.L. ca. 2.86 m.; W. ca. 0.60 m.

Seager found pottery of the EM II and MM Ia phases. The earlier pottery lay "in a heap in the northwest corner" of the tomb, while the MM I objects "lay together along the east side," and Seager believed that the tomb was built in the EM II phase and re-used in the MM I phase. During the 1976 cleaning, however, pottery of the EM III phase was uncovered in the southwest corner of the tomb, and it would appear that the tomb was used through all three phases of the Prepalatial period. Seager reported two vases of the EM II phase, including a "fruit-stand" of brown-black burnished ware (XI 6) and a Vasilike-ware "egg-cup" (XI 23), together with numerous small green-schist bowls that should also be dated to the same phase."' During the 1976 cleaning several fragments of similar bowls were uncovered in the same area at the north and northwest of the tomb. Seager reported five vases of the MM Ia phase, including a jug with round mouth and a bull rhyton, both painted with dark-on-light decoration (XI 11, 14), and a one-handled cup and two-handled jar painted in familiar MM Ia polychrome styles (XI 13, 16). 112 In 1976 a small unexcavated deposit was uncovered towards the south- west corner of the tomb; it included a small conical cup decorated in characteristic EM III paint (M XI-2) and two bird's-nest bowls (M XI-4 and 5), which could also be as early as EM III/MM I. The fragments of a third stone bowl (M XI-3) were found near by in disturbed earth, and a lamp found just to the north of the tomb (M XI-1) may or may not be part of its original contents."3 CATALOGUE Tomb XI VESSELS Pottery M XI-1 (Ag.Nik.Mus. 6813).

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Terrace 3 is the longest of the South Slope terraces since it extends farther to the west than any of the other terraces, a total distance of ca. 46 meters (Plan 3). Bounded on the east M XI-4 97</page><page sequence="118">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY by the rock outcroppings that border the South Slope cemetery, it runs beneath the West Terrace and terminates in the rocks that drop steeply to sea level at the southwest corner of the island. The width of the terrace is defined at various points on the south by bedrock outcroppings and steep drops and on the north by bedrock outcroppings at the east and west ends and by the rear walls of the tombs at its center. It ranges in width from ca. four meters at the west end to ca. six meters at the center and lies ca. 4.90 m. below the level of Terrace 4 at its east end. The modern path to the West Terrace runs along this terrace today, and in antiquity too Terrace 3 probably provided the most direct route to the West Terrace for one approaching from the settlement. The remains of four tombs have been exposed along the terrace: two rock shelters at each end of the terrace and two built tombs near its center. There is room for one or two more, particularly in the space between the rock shelter and the built tomb at the west, but no trace of other tombs survives. Only one of the four exposed tombs may be identified without any doubt: Tomb VII, the location of which was clearly described by Seager at the west end of the terrace just below and to the south of Tomb Complex I/II/III. The tomb at the eastern end of the terrace may be one of two rock shelters, VIII or XIV. The two tombs in the center of the terrace do not appear to have been numbered by Seager; they are identified here as Tombs A and E. All four tombs on this terrace were cleaned by the Greek Archaeological Service, A and E in 1972 and the two rock shelters in 1976. TOMB VII (Fig. 42, PI. 34:b and c) Seager described Tomb VII, a rock shelter, as "a fissure running between two large boulders" that "had been walled in at the southern end." In general this description is accu- rate, although some further points should be made about the walls. These extend, one from each of the two boulders, towards the south, and each turns at right angles at the south towards the center of the tomb to form a small doorway, ca. 0.58 m. wide. The eastern wall, which rests on a low bedrock outcropping and backs against bedrock on its east, is consid- erably shorter and does not extend to the rear of the tomb. The western wall, which rests at ground level and is freestanding, extends all the way back to the rear of the shelter, where it was built entirely in stone to fill the space between the earth floor and the rock overhang.114 The entrance to the tomb is flanked by low bedrock outcroppings that project south from the corners of the built facade and form a small natural alcove in front of the tomb, ca. 1.10 m. wide, reminiscent of the one in front of Tomb B. The entrance opens into a small irregular space measuring a maximum of 1.17 m. east-west and 1.08 m. north-south. This front area was provided with a level earth floor, but at the rear a rock ledge rises ca. 0.62 m. above the floor and projects another 0.70 m. back into the rock. The roof is formed partly by rock overhang at the rear of the shelter, which stands ca. two meters above floor level in the center of the tomb; the roof presumably constructed in front of this area would have rested on the two projecting boulders at either side of the tomb and in front on the mud-brick superstructure of the built walls. 114 Tomb VII, west wall: L. ca. 2.10 m.; W. ca. 0.44 m.; H. ca. 0.89 m.

Its identification as the Tomb VIII that Seager described simply as "a natural hole in the rocks" is made largely by a process of elimination and is not absolutely certain. Seager's Tombs VIII, XIV, and XVIII are the only remaining unidentified rock shelters. Tomb XVIII may be located fairly certainly on Terrace 2 and is discussed below, and Tomb XIV is described as "a small hole in the rocks". This tomb, because of its large size, is most likely to be Seager's Tomb VIII. Although the tomb has not been cleaned to bedrock, it is well exposed. The mouth of the shelter is set back between projecting arms of bedrock, each ca. 1 m. high, that on the east extending ca. 1 m. from the mouth of the shelter, and that on the west ca. 1.25 m. Like the lower outcroppings in front of Tomb VII, these rock ledges form a natural alcove, ca. 1.60 m. wide, in front of the tomb. The mouth of the shelter measures ca. 1.40 m. across and probably does not rise much more than one meter above the bedrock floor: to enter, one would always have had to crawl. The mouth opens into a small solution cave created by the erosion of a pocket of conglomerate, leaving floor, walls, and ceilings of hard sideropetra. The interior is an irregular space measuring a maximum of three meters in width, 2.70 m. in depth, and only ca. 0.80 m. high at its rear. TOMBS A and E (Figs. 44 and 45, P1. 35:b) These two tombs, which lie side by side between the two rock shelters on the terrace, do not appear to have been excavated by Seager. Only the very southeast corner of E is pre- served, so little that it might easily be overlooked, and it requires some imagination even to recognize the remains of a tomb. It provides a good illustration, however, of the erosion that has occurred across the center of the South Slope and caused the destruction of so many tombs. Since the cleaning of A in 1972, several of its walls also have collapsed and washed away. Tomb A is the better preserved of the two. It is a two-roomed rectangular building with over-all measurements of ca. 4.10 by 4.20 m. It is somewhat awkwardly oriented north- south, with the slope of the hill such that the north room lies at a higher level than the south. It is also one of the more poorly built of the Mochlos tombs: no attempt was made to anchor any part of the tomb on exposed bedrock or even to base the walls on bedrock in spite of their rather precipitous position. All the walls are constructed in ordinary rubble and rest directly on the earth slope. The north wall of the tomb acts as a retaining wall against the rising ground.115 For most of its length it lacks an outer face and simply backs against the earth, but at its west end it was carefully widened and strengthened with inner and outer faces. The east wall of the tomb, which runs down the slope of the hill, appears to have been constructed with four stepped, horizontal surfaces.116 The corner of each of the steps, above each vertical rise, is broken off, but the remainder of each of the horizontal levels is preserved. This type of stepped construction is not uncommonly found in walls built on slopes, and it parallels that of the north wall of Gournia Tomb I (p. 4 above). At its south 1'5 Tomb A, north wall: L. ca. 4.32 m.; W. at west end ca. 0.50 m.; H. ca. 1.05 m. 116 Tomb A, east wall: L. ca. 4.10 m.; W. 0.50-0.55 m.; H. ca. 0.71 m. 100</page><page sequence="121">B-, I &lt; i '% :1770 t / |jI I , 0 1 2 3M.

Section AB through Mochlos Tomb A end the wall curves, so that the south wall of the tomb is an unbroken extension of the east wall. Lying at the lowest level on the slope, the south wall is missing a large center section, which apparently washed downhill, but originally the section of wall preserved on the east probably joined the small end section preserved farther west. 17 No section of west wall is preserved, and the tomb was apparently always left open and entered at the west. The central north-south partition wall runs parallel to the outer walls.11 Like the north wall of the tomb, it acts as a retaining wall against the higher ground level behind it and has only an outer south face except at its west end, where it was widened and strengthened with inner and outer faces at the entrance. At its east end it does not bond with the outer east wall. The open spaces on the west between this partition wall and the north and south walls of the tomb, on the north ca. 1.40 m. wide and on the south ca. 1.04 m. wide, provide access to the two rooms. The lower, southern room measures a maximum of 1.43 by 3.50 m. and uses the natural earth slope for its floor. The slightly larger upper room, measuring a maximum of 1.62 by 3.72 m., is set roughly a meter above the lower room. It appears to have been paved, at least along its southern side, where slabs are placed irregularly above the loose fill of stones and earth behind the partition wall. Tomb E may originally have looked similar to A, although its plan is largely hypo- thetical: only fragments of two parallel walls running east-west are preserved. 19 They rest at about the same level on the slope as the south and central partition walls of Tomb A and 117 Tomb A, south wall: L. including gap ca. 3.58 m.; W. 0.47-0.52 m.; H. ca. 0.44 m. 118 Tomb A, internal partition wall: L. ca. 3.62 m.; W. at west end ca. 0.72 m.; H. ca. 0.76 m. 119 Tomb E, south wall: p.L. ca. 2.05 m.; W. 0.42-0.50 m.; H. ca. 0.40 m. 103</page><page sequence="124">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY run in the same direction. At the west they are incomplete; at the east they abut a low bed- rock outcropping that may have formed the footing for the now vanished east wall. As preserved, then, the tomb appears to have consisted of one rectangular room, corresponding in size and orientation to the lower south room of Tomb A, but a second room, now totally destroyed, may also have stood to the north as it does in A. BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY Seager reported finding "a few bones" in Tomb VII and "a great many bones" in Tomb VIII; he did not describe the burials further. During the 1972 cleaning only the most frag- mentary bits of skeletal material were uncovered in and around Tombs A and E. Seager did not report any pottery from Tomb VII and dated it on the basis of its stone vases to "the transitional stage between the E.M. III and M.M. I periods." During the 1976 cleaning of the tomb, however, EM II/III sherds were uncovered with several stone vase fragments (M VII-1-3) in an unexcavated area at the northwest corner of the tomb, and the date of construction should probably be pushed back to the EM II phase. Seager reported four vases from Tomb VIII, including three dating to the EM II phase (VIII b, d and e) and one of the EM III phase (VIII c).120 No diagnostic pottery was uncovered during the clean- ing of Tombs A and E, and they cannot be dated securely. Several features of the construc- tion of A, however, suggest that it may not have been built as early as VII and most of the tombs on the slope. These include the somewhat shoddy wall construction without ortho- states as well as the stepped eastern wall and the curved southeast corner of the tomb.

LOCATION AND EXCAVATION Below most of Terrace 3 the ground falls sharply to the coast, and it is doubtful that any tombs could be built in most of the area. Only at the southeast corner of the slope are there any indications of terracing below the level of Terrace 3. Like the slope above, this area is de- lineated by bedrock outcroppings: on the east those that flank the South Slope above continue until they break off some ten meters above sea level; on the west, another outcropping rising at the level of Terrace 3 parallels that on the east, running eight to ten meters from it, and continues down to sea level. In this area, approximately five meters below the level of Ter- race 3, there are good indications of another terrace. It extends about eight meters between bedrock outcroppings east and west and is flanked on the north by additional rock outcrop- pings. Only two tombs appear to have been located on this terrace. One is a tiny rock shelter at the western end in the outcroppings that rise along the north. The other is a simple hole in the rocks lying to the east; it has no apparent built structure, except perhaps the rocks placed loosely around its perimeter. The rock shelter to the west is to be identified as Tomb XVIII (Plan 3); the hole to the east, although it clearly was excavated, cannot even be identified as a tomb with any certainty.121 Tomb XVIII was cleaned in 1976. TOMB XVIII (Fig. 47, P1. 35:c) Seager's description of Tomb XVIII as "a natural hole in the rock" (apparently the description that he used for all rock shelters) that "lay low down the slope near the edge of the cliffs" exactly matches the location of this shelter, and since no shelters are located below it, its identification as Tomb XVIII seems secure. The shelter is located in a small outcrop- ping, itself no more than 1.65 m. across, of conglomerate and sideropetra. The conglomerate has eroded in such a way that the floor and walls are formed of sideropetra while the roof 121 This may be the missing Tomb XIV, the only one of the South Slope tombs that is unaccounted for, which Seager describes as "a small hole in the rocks"; on the other hand, XIV could be located beneath the uncleared rubble on Terrace 5, especially if Seager numbered the tombs on this terrace in sequence. 105</page><page sequence="126">THE MOCHLOS CEMETERY B - A A- o I 2rt FIG. 47. Plan and section AB through Mochlos Tomb XVIII on South Slope Terrace 2 remains conglomerate. The shelter is very small, with an opening ca. 0.60 m. wide at its base and ca. 0.40 m. high. It extends back into bedrock only ca. 0.60 m. BURIALS AND CHRONOLOGY Seager did not describe the burials in the tomb, and only a few very fragmentary bits of bone were uncovered during the 1976 cleaning. Because of the small size of the shelter, only one burial could be made here at a time, and it would have to have belonged to a small individual trussed up in a sharply contracted position. Seager reports six vases from the shelter, all of them small. One still wonders how so many vases could fit inside the shelter together with a burial. None of the vases is illustrated, but they appear to belong to the EM II (XVIII c, e, g) and EM III (XVIII h) phases.122 TERRACE 1: TOMB Z LOCATION AND EXCAVATION One additional tomb has been cleared and exposed below the level of Terrace 2. It lies at the very bottom of the South Slope at the edge of the rocky coastline that forms the south- ern boundary of the first and lowest terrace (Plan 3). This terrace is bounded on the west by the same line of rock outcropping that rises at the level of Terrace 3 and runs alongside the western side of Terrace 2. To the east, where the bedrock barrier that borders the whole east side of the South Slope subsides, the South Slope lies open towards the settlement area, and it is unclear how much farther the cemetery may have extended in this direction.'23 The 122 Vessels XVIII c and g are examples of EM II red washed ware and red burnished ware (Wilson, BSA 80, 1985, pp. 312, 317); XVIII h may be dated by its white-on-dark chevron decoration (Betancourt, White- on-Dark Ware, p. 22, fig. 3:2). 123 The remains of one unexcavated tomb, however, which lie in line with Tomb Z, are exposed in the scarp above the rock coastline ca. 10.60 m. to the east. Because of the proximity of the Prepalatial settlement remains in Block A, the cemetery probably extended no farther than this. 106</page><page sequence="127">THE SOUTH SLOPE, TERRACE 1 excavated tomb was exposed for the first time in 1976 by the Greek Archaeological Service and is identified as Tomb Z. TOMB Z (Fig. 48, P1. 35:d) Tomb Z, which lies at the western end of Terrace 1, is a one-room rectangular building nestled between low bedrock outcroppings on its east and west. It has no discernible en- trance and may have been approached from either the higher north side or the now de- stroyed south side, which opened onto the rocky coastline. The north and west walls are constructed in ordinary rubble, but without the flat stones that characterize so many of the higher tombs. The west wall rests on the bedrock outcropping that bounds this side of the terrace. One to three courses are preserved here, but the bottom part of the wall is formed by the bedrock itself that slopes into the floor.'24 The north wall is entirely built: six irregular courses are preserved, and the wall was carefully bonded at its corners.125 It rests at floor level and serves as a retaining wall against the rising slope to its north.

The south wall of the tomb is destroyed, but it is unlikely that the tomb extended much farther south than its western wall because of the sharp drop in ground level at this point. The interior of the tomb, then, was ca. 2.30 m. long, while its width varied from 1.37 to 1.72 m. The rock floor slopes down sharply from north to south, and the contents must have spilled into the sea long ago with the collapse of the south wall. During the 1976 cleaning, however, fragments of mud brick (P1. 37:a)126 and a pivot stone (M Z-1) were uncovered.

TOMBS EAST OF THE SOUTH SLOPE In addition to the two areas that Seager explored on the West Terrace and the South Slope, a third that he did not explore was also used as a cemetery in the Prepalatial period. This area is located immediately east of Seager's South Slope, on the opposite side of the rock outcropping that borders its east side. It too is delineated by distinct topographical features and is bounded on the east by a north-south line of further outcroppings like those on its west, although not running so far south, and on the north by outcroppings that follow the 35-meter contour line like the low cliffs that rise above Terrace 7 on the South Slope. The area is not so large as the South Slope: it extends east-west about the same distance, a maximum of 45 meters, but not so far south as the coast. Only four tombs have been cleared in this area, and while their disposition on the slope is not entirely clear, they do not seem to have been arranged in so orderly a fashion as those on the South Slope. Two were cleaned by the Greek Archaeological Service in 1976, H and 0; the other two, I and K, appear to have been only partly excavated sometime in the past, although it is unclear when or by whom (Plan 3). Traces of other tombs, as yet unexcavated, are to be seen in the area and warrant further investigation. TOMB H (Fig. 49, PI. 36:a and b) Tomb H is a small, nearly square tomb of one room with internal dimensions of ca. 1.40 m. on each side. It nestles in a natural recess of sideropetra outcropping which rises to the north and west. The north wall rests on a depression in this outcropping and is built ap- proximately five courses high to the level of the outcropping at the northeast and northwest. The east wall rests on bedrock above the floor level and is preserved to a height of three 126 Similar mud-brick fragments were found in Tomb B on Terrace 7; see p. 70 above. 108</page><page sequence="129">TOMBS EAST OF THE SOUTH SLOPE A ISs _ -_ 0 1 2 3M.

The floor is formed largely by the sideropetra, which slopes down at a 450 angle from west to east. Apart from fragmentary pieces of bone, no finds are reported from the tomb. TOMB 0 (Fig. 50, P1. 36:c) Tomb 0 is a rectangular building, ca. 4.15 m. in length, with two rooms. The south side is destroyed. The north wall, preserved for its entire length, is set partly as a retaining wall against the rise of the hill and is strengthened at its west end by a large upright block of side- ropetra. The wall is indented at its center and set farther back against the slope on the west than on the east. Part of the central partition wall is preserved, standing two courses above floor level at the middle of the tomb. The eastern wall is set on an outcropping of sandstone conglomerate ca. 0.35 m. above floor level and is largely destroyed. The northeastern and southern parts of the west wall are preserved to a height of one course, resting on sloping sideropetra.128 Each room of the tomb is ca. 1.30 m. wide and probably did not extend beyond the preserved sections of wall on the south. The floor of the eastern room, formed largely by an eroded sandstone conglomerate pit, lies lower than that of the western room, which is formed of sideropetra sloping downwards from northwest to southeast. In addition to fragmentary pieces of bone, sherds of dark brown burnished ware and Vasilike ware were uncovered. One EM II vase is preserved. CATALOGUE VESSEL Pottery M 0-1 (Siteia Mus.).

Plan of Mochlos Tomb K TOMB I (Fig. 52, P1. 36:d) Tomb I is a one-room tomb with a doorway at the southeast. The tomb backs against a small cave on the north and west; only its east and south walls are built of masonry. The south wall, preserved to a height of two courses, projects from the bedrock on the west side of the tomb; a small rectangular platform, only one course high, is located at its outer south- west corner against this bedrock. The east wall projects from the bedrock at the north side of the tomb. At its north end, where it is preserved to a height of four courses, it turns west at right angles and runs ca. 0.52 m. along the bedrock face enabling the mud-brick superstruc- ture of the wall to meet the roof of the cave.129 The roof was formed partly by the projecting bedrock, which stands ca. 1.25 m. above floor level near the center of the tomb, and partly by a built roof towards the south, the beams of which could rest on top of the bedrock projection to the north. A doorway, ca. 0.57 m. wide, opens into an irregular space with maximum dimensions of ca. 1.95 by ca. 2.82 m. It was a colorful interior: the cave at the north is formed by purple schist overhanging a bed of blue-gray sideropetra, which also forms the floor at the north- west sloping down towards the entrance. The tomb is not yet completely excavated. TOMB K (Fig. 53) Tomb K is a small one-room tomb set, like Tomb 0, in the bedrock outcroppings that border the South Slope.

Although some were built as adjuncts to the tholoi of the Mesara, most are located in central and eastern Crete, where 12 of the sites and 73 of the 80 documented tombs are found (Map). This type of tomb appears, then, to be as characteristic of the people who inhabited these parts of Crete as tholoi are of the Mesara culture. The earliest tombs date to the beginning of the EM II phase, a time of general expansion in the population of Crete and of nearly revo- lutionary change in the material culture and political organization of the island; the tombs are one manifestation of those changes. While they are 400 or more years later than the Mesara tholoi, they represent the first built tombs of an indigenous type in central and eastern Crete and an important break from the age-old tradition of burial in caves or rock shelters. The earliest examples are located in larger cemeteries, often close to tombs of an older or different type, at sites that appear to be new foundations at this time. They include Archanes (Tomb 6), Gournia (Tomb III), Koumasa (Tomb F), Linares, Mallia (the West- ern Ossuary), Mochlos (Tombs I-VII, IX-XI, XIII, XV-XVII, XIX/XX, XXII/XXIII, A, B, Z, H, 0, I, K), and Palaikastro (Tombs I and II). Mochlos accounts for the largest number by far, some 21 of 28 documented examples, and if number alone were a sufficient criterion for identifying the place of origin of the house tomb, Mochlos, which led the way in so many important developments of the period, would be so cited. Tombs from four of these sites, however, contained extensive deposits of EM IIa pottery: at Gournia, Koumasa, Mochlos, and Palaikastro; they must be judged to be contemporary. It is also tempting to identify eastern Crete, where five of these seven early sites are located and where the house tomb is most common through the remainder of the Prepalatial period, as the place of origin, but the evidence from Knossos is lacking, and since all these East Cretan sites appear to have been settled by colonists migrating from the area around Knossos, it may be Knossos where the house tomb originates. Many of the tombs built in the EM II phase continue to be used throughout much or all of the Prepalatial period, but it is only at the end of this period, in the time of the MM Ia pot- tery phase, that the house tombs proliferate. Like the EM II phase, this is a time of consid- erable development in the material culture and political organization of the island. It is a period of important change distinguished by the growing occupation and increasing urbani- zation of the island. The first country villas appear; cave and peak sanctuaries spring up everywhere; villages with closed plans appear to be broken up into open settlements and expanded into larger urban centers; and, most remarkably, the components of an early palace are thought to be laid in place at Knossos. It is at this time too that house tombs show a significant increase in number, that some of the largest examples are built, and that many are combined with shrines to provide centers of worship. At least thirty new tombs are built at 14 different sites in this period, nine of them new sites where the house tomb had not been</page><page sequence="135">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS documented before. Many are clustered together in larger cemeteries. New tombs are added alongside older ones in the cemeteries at Archanes (Tombs B, 8, 12, 18, 19), Gournia (Tombs I, II, VII, VIII), Mallia (the House of the Dead, the Eastern Ossuaries), and Palai- kastro (Tombs IV-VIII), and others are introduced to cemeteries at Porti and Platanos for the first time. Some tombs were built in isolation, and several, such as those at Agios Geor- gios, Gournes, and Myrtos, Pyrgos, appear to have stood alone. Those in the large cemete- ries served the expanding communities with which they were associated, whereas the more isolated tombs may have been built to serve the country villas that sprang up at this time. Most of the tombs built in the MM Ia phase, with the notable exception of those on Mochlos, continue to be used into the MM Ib phase. Only one or two new tombs appear to be constructed in the Old Palace period, and it is a curious phenomenon that the great build- ing activity associated with the construction of the first palaces is not paralleled in funerary architecture. The only tomb connected with this activity that may be described as truly mon- umental is the second tomb at Chrysolakkos: it shares several architectural features with the Protopalatial buildings at Mallia and, it has often been suggested, was designed to house the dead of the palace elite. The failure to build new tombs during the Old Palace period may be explained in part by the increasing poy the i asof other methods of burial. Pithos and larnax burials become ever more common, and the chamber tomb, introduced in the Old Palace period, increases in use until by the beginning of the New Palace period it has replaced the house tomb and nearly all other earlier methods of burial. In light of these new burial methods, it is almost surprising that a segment of the population should be content to con- tinue using the house tombs of their predecessors, which must have been considered a some- what traditional and conservative method of burial. It is quite likely that the choice between one form of burial and the other reflects a division in the social makeup of the population. Another reason, then, for the failure to build new tombs in the Old Palace period may be that use of the house tomb is restricted tom a relatively small segment of the population. A lingering conservatism often distinguishes the burial methods of the ruling class, and so it is in the New Palace period, long after the house tomb has gone out of general use, that a few tombs of this type continue to be used at centers of the palatial civilization. Tombs at Myrtos, Pyrgos, Archanes (Tombs 3 and B), and Mallia (Chrysolakkos III) are re-used, in the latter two cases after undergoing extensive renovation, and new tombs are built at Agia Triada (Tomb 5) and Knossos, where the Temple Tomb combines features of the house tomb and the chamber tomb in a new hybrid. During the period of Mycenaean occupation, when tombs at Knossos (The Temple Tomb), Mallia (the House of the Dead), and Agia Triada (Tomb 5) are used one last time, one new tomb was built, the Tomb of the Painted Sarcophagus at Agia Triada, and it too apparently belonged to very special individuals. In the following catalogue the tombs are arranged by site in alphabetical order. Bib- liography is followed by a brief discussion of the location and excavation of the tomb, its architecture, and its burials and chronology. When tombs are already fully published else- where description has been kept to a minimum; other tombs are published here in detail for the first time; still others must await final publication by their excavators.

THE AGIA TRIADA CEMETERY The Agia Triada Cemetery (Fig. 54) lies at the west end of the hill that the palace of Phaistos also occupies, some 100 meters northeast of the Neopalatial villa at Agia Triada, and adjacent to an EM II settlement. It looks out to the west towards the Bay of Mesara and to the north towards the twin peaks of Mount Ida. Not yet completely excavated, it contains the remains of at least five tombs and funerary buildings. The earliest of these are the two tholoi, A and B, lying near the foot of the hill to the north. They appear to have been erected in the EM II phase; near the end of the Prepalatial period, series of antechambers were added to their southeastern sides. Perhaps at the same time a precinct wall was added to the west side of Tholos A.2 This wall, constructed of large upright slabs set against the rising slope to the south, extends ca. 13.65 m. west of Tholos A in a nearly straight east-west line. At its preserved west end it veers to the north, but it may originally have extended farther to the west and enclosed the cemetery on its north. Both tholoi and wall were used into the Protopalatial period, and at the end of the Neopalatial period a larnax burial was added to the south side of the Tholos B annex. Higher up the slope to the south of Tholos A is the South Building, which was constructed in the MM Ia phase and is included in the Cata- logue below. To the south of Tholos B, lying at the highest point in the cemetery, is the somewhat enigmatic Tomb 5, which appears to be Neopalatial in date and which is also included in the Catalogue. Between this tomb and Tholos B lies the last of the house tombs, constructed apparently in the LM IIIa phase, which contained the famous Agia Triada sarcophagus. Only the two tholoi and Tomb 5 are visible today. The cemetery, then, remained in use throughout nearly the whole of Minoan civiliza- tion. It lies some two kilometers from the palace at Phaistos, where early settlement remains have also been revealed, and it may have served as the cemetery for the settlements at both Phaistos and Agia Triada. It also served as a religious center at important points in its history, and this fact, as well as its use by important settlements, explains its prolonged existence. 1.

Agia Triada, the South Building (Stefani, ASAtene 13-14, 1930-1931, p. 153, fig. 3) consisted of a two-roomed rectangular unit oriented approximately north-south. The two rooms do not interconnect, and each is provided with an entrance. Room 1, the southern room, opens to the west, and Room 2, the northern room, opens to the north. Each room is small and rectangular, Room 1 only ca. 1.20 m. square and Room 2 ca. 1.22 by 1.45 m. At some time a wall was erected a short distance to the north of this unit, running parallel to its north face, and the spaces between it and the north face of the building at the east and west were closed off by rough walls, thereby preventing access to Room 2. Perhaps at the same time the more extensive complex to the west was erected. The east wall of this complex was built against the west wall of the original unit, thus blocking access to Room 1, and the orig- inal building may have gone out of use. The larger complex to the west is composed of six rooms, 5-6, 7-8, and 9-10, located in three parallel compartments opening towards the north.3 Each compartment consists of an outer and an inner room, the one opening onto the other; each appears to form a self- contained unit, although it is possible that the units connect in the northern, unexcavated portion of the building.

Its east wall is broken to form a niche, ca. 0.45 m. wide and ca. 0.90 m. deep, where several dishes were found.4 Room 7, which lies at the east side of the central compartment, is the largest of the excavated rooms, measuring ca. 1.20 m. at its south end and ca. 2.30 m. in length. At its north it seems to open onto a still larger room that is only partly excavated. The floor of Room 7 is paved with cobblestones, and a low bench runs along its east wall. The room gives access to a smaller room at its west, Room 8, which is L-shaped and measures ca. 2 m. in length and ca. 0.80 m. in width at its south side. The published photograph of this area indicates that it was also paved. A small niche where a vase was found is located at floor level in the southeast corner of this room. Many vases in addition, including some heaped one upon another, were found in Room 7 and in the northern part of Room 8. The western compartment is arranged like the eastern, with Room 10 opening to its south into Room 9. Room 10, measuring ca. 1.20 by ca. 1.60 m., is paved with stone slabs, while Room 9, only ca. 0.75 m. wide, preserved traces of a red stucco flooring. The southern facade of the rooms in this complex is ornamented with a series of three setbacks that correspond to the internal compartmental divisions. At some time additional walls were added to this facade, creating at least two more rooms, 3 and 4, to its south, but it seems probable that the facade was the original southern face of the complex. Both the internal walls, which are visible in the published photograph of the building, and the facade wall lie at a considerably lower level than do the walls that form Rooms 3 and 4. Those enclosing Room 4 on the south do not join the south wall of the larger complex, and the wall enclosing Room 3 on the south does not appear on the plan (Fig. 55) to bond with the partially destroyed east wall of this room. As a result, it seems that the southernmost rooms in this building are a still later addition to the earlier complexes. Use and Chronology Banti compared the South Building to the buildings found in Area AB at Platanos that Xanthoudides described as huts used as tombs or storehouses for vases of clay and stone. The care taken to pave rooms of the building, as well as the bench in Room 7 and the signs of wear in the stucco floor of Room 5, suggests that the building was accessible to visitors in the cemetery. Zois has assumed that it was a "religious center" for the cemetery, and the deposits in niches and the stacked vessels, including cups like those found in Room L of the Tholos A annex, suggest that the rooms were indeed used for ceremonial functions, presum- ably, because of the location of the building, in connection with the funerary ritual. The pottery has been fully published by Banti, who has dated it MM I. Recently Zois has restudied the pottery and demonstrated that the majority of the vases belong to the MM Ia phase; because of the abundance of barbotine ware the building should be consid- ered a type site, along with Drakones, for MM Ia barbotine ware. It may not be considered a closed deposit, however, since several vases belong to the MM Ib phase, and the building clearly continued to be used in the Protopalatial period. 4 Banti, ASAtene 13-14, 1930-1931, p. 218, fig. 122. 119</page><page sequence="140">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS 2.

Location and Excavation This building, known also as the Tomb within an Ancient House, is located about 27 meters south of the Tholos B annex, higher up the slope of the hill but still within the cemetery area (Fig. 54). It was excavated in 1903 by Roberto Paribeni and is still exposed today. Architecture As at Tholos B, the slope of the hill has been cut away to bedrock to form a level terrace to accommodate the building. As a result, the long axis of the building is oriented approxi- mately east-west against the hillside. The entire northern side of the building has been destroyed by the erosion of the slope, but sufficient remains survive to the south to restore a rectangular building of four successive rooms, ca. 15.40 m. long5 and considerably less in width because of the limits of the terrace. The south wall is preserved for its entire length.6 It stands a maximum of five courses high and is constructed of a single row of large stones set in fairly regular courses against the slope. The true width of the wall, ca. 1.10 m., is best represented by the five stones of the top course that lie in a line near the center of the wall. The upper surface of these stones forms a N S C ^-E X _L 9 ,, H, - // -/; 1 oS 0 1 2 3 4 5 rm [ I ,s,1?s I I I i 1 FIG. 56.

Five additional walls, none completely preserved, are set north-south, perpendicular to this wall. The four to the west are constructed in the usual rubble and bond with the long south wall. Today they are preserved to a maximum height of four courses, but at the time of their excavation they were apparently much higher. The published photograph of this building7 indicates that the east wall of the pillar crypt rose some seven courses to nearly the same height as the south wall. Only the southernmost part of the east wall is preserved today. It differs from the other walls in that it is constructed of flat slabs only a single course high that are set next to one another without an intervening earth mortar. It lies ca. 0.18 m. inside the end of the long south wall and does not bond with it. Forming a level surface of uniform height, it appears to have served as a stylobate and was perhaps designed to support a series of columns, although no trace of these survives. In the published plan (Fig. 56) this wall is preserved the longest of those running north-south, ca. 4.20 m. in length, and pro- vides the minimum north-south measurement for the building. The building was probably entered through this eastern room, which, measuring ca. 4.15 m. east-west, may have formed an entrance portico. To the west are the remains of two parallel narrow rooms, the more easterly ca. 1.50 m. wide and the other ca. 1.30 m. wide. The function of these rooms is not clear, but they may have formed the well of a U-shaped staircase, as Long has suggested, or served s storerooms.8 The westernmost room of the tomb, ca. 4.15 m. wide east-west, is a pillar crypt. Two of the pillars, now destroyed, were in situ at the southern side of the room at the time of excavation and are visible in the pub- lished photograph.9 They were constructed of separate, superimposed, roughly squared blocks; three blocks of the western pillar but only the bottom one of the eastern remained.10 Because of the position of the preserved pillars near the south wall, to one side of the room, it is probable that at least two others originally stood to the north, perhaps, if the room was square, near the north wall. No passage from one room to another is preserved, but because the building could not have extended much farther to the north and the north-south walls block the south side of the building, one is tempted to restore an opening in the northwest corner of the portico and a corridor leading along the north wall to the pillar crypt. No trace of an upper floor was reported, but its existence is indicated by the width of the south wall, by the pillars of the crypt, which may have supported columns in a room above, and by the joins between finds from different rooms of the lower story. The excavators reported another wall lying just to the east of this building but not attached to it; its axis was similar to that of the long south wall, but it was set just to the south at a slightly higher level. Only a small part of this wall is exposed today, but it appears 7 Paribeni, MonAnt 14, 1904, p. 721, fig. 23. 8 In the plan (Fig. 56) and the published illustration (Paribeni, MonAnt 14, 1904, p. 721, fig. 23) the western wall of the western room appears to lack an inner face. This face is visible today, however, and the room cannot be thought for this reason alone to have been filled in with the lower flight of a staircase. Store- rooms are frequent adjuncts to pillar crypts, and in the complex of rooms that these most resemble in con- temporary domestic architecture, Tylissos House C, Rooms 2, 3a, and 3b, the narrow side rooms were used as storerooms (Platon, KpqrXpozv 8, 1954, pp. 455-456, pl. I:KET). 9 Paribeni, MonAnt 14, 1904, p. 721, fig. 23. 10 Western pillar: W. ca. 0.60 m.; H. ca. 1.29 m. 121</page><page sequence="142">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS to consist of a single course of carefully squared stones. One of these, fallen out of place and found in the vicinity, was incised with a trident sign similar to those found on the blocks in the Neopalatial palace at Phaistos. The extent of the wall is not reported, but the wall is included in the published plan of the entire site,11 extending ca. 10 m. to the east with a short wall running north-south at its end, and it is possible that the measurement of 26.30 m. given in the publication for the length of the building includes this eastern struc- ture. The wall seems to have been planned as an addition to the main part of the building, oriented as it is in the same direction as its south wall and located a short distance from it. Since it encloses such a large space, it may be part of a precinct wall enclosing an open court in front of the building. Burials and Chronology All the finds in the building were disturbed, including the burials, which were located only in the pillar crypt and the eastern of the two central rooms and lay well above floor level. The skeletal remains from the eastern of the two central rooms, all fragmentary, came from a "high stratum" in the room. None were found in the 1.15 m. of fill directly above the floor with the majority of finds from this room, and no finds at all were made in the last 0.30 m. of fill. The skeletal remains in the pillar crypt were concentrated in the southeast corner, scattered through the top 1.50 m. of fill together with the other finds, but with a greater concentration at a depth of 1.30-1.40 m. All the skeletal material was greatly dis- turbed, although at least five separate skeletons were represented and an unpainted conical cup was found with one skull. No finds were made in the lowest 0.50 m. of fill directly above the floor of the crypt. Because of the disturbed nature of the deposits, many of the finds cannot be securely dated. Those that can be dated with a fair degree of certainty on stylistic grounds, however, are included in the following catalogue. They appear to fall into three different chronologi- cal groups: objects of the EM II phase; a group, by far the largest, belonging to the Neo- palatial period; and objects of LM IIIa date.

Pendlebury, Aegyptiaca, Cambridge 1930, pp. 8-9; F. Stubbings, "The Aegean Bronze Age," in Cambridge Ancient History I, Cambridge 1962, p. 245. The seal should, however, be associated with the latest finds in the tomb and not the MM III/ LM I finds as Pendlebury and Stubbings suggest. A scarab of the same queen was found at Mycenae with LM III pottery (C. Tsountas, &lt;'ApxaorTjres EK MvKV&amp;v&gt;&gt;,, 'ApX'E4 1887 [pp. 155-172], p. 169), and more recently a scarab of Amenophis III was found in a LM IIIa context near Knossos (P. Fraser, "Archaeology in Greece," ArchReports for 1968- 1969 [pp. 3-39], p. 33, figs. 44-45). See also M. Pop- ham, "Late Minoan Chronology," AJA 74, 1970 (pp. 226-228), pp. 227-228. The disposition and peculiar nature of these finds have prompted considerable discus- sion concerning the building in which they were discovered. Paribeni concluded that be- cause none was found on the floor, the building was originally a house that was later re-used as a tomb. The female figurines found in the building led Nilsson and Evans to suggest that the building must also have contained a shrine,13 a suggestion supported and somewhat 12 With the exception of the diadems (Paribeni, MonAnt 14, 1904, pp. 732-733) and the gold-plated pen- dant (ibid., pp. 754-755, fig. 47), which could be as early as EM II, all the jewelry from this building should belong to the New Palace period.

In the meantime, Banti argued that the finds could not belong to the building because of their location above floor level, because of their disarray, and be- cause of their wide chronological span and had probably washed into it from higher up the hill. This hypothesis is the most tenuous. The EM II finds, if correctly identified, may well be intrusive, since the building is too advanced architecturally to date to this period. The closest architectural parallels belong to the Neopalatial period, as does the majority of finds. Furthermore, the Neopalatial finds show a certain homogeneity that one would not expect if they were simply "washed in" from above; it is important to note a remarkably similar de- posit with cylindrical incense burner, pedestaled vases, a female figurine with barbotine decoration, and several figurines with cylindrical or bell-shaped skirts in a Neopalatial shrine at Phaistos.14 The location of the finds above floor level may simply indicate that they had fallen from the floor above, and the building is included in this Catalogue on the pre- sumption that, regardless of its contents, its location in the Agia Triada Cemetery marks it as a funerary building. 3. TOMB OF THE PAINTED SARCOPHAGUS (Fig. 57) Paribeni, RendLinc 12, 1903, pp. 342-343; Paribeni, MonAnt 14, 1904, pp. 713-719; Paribeni, MonAnt 19, 1908, pp. 5-86; Long, The Ayia Triada Sarcophagus, pp. 11-15. Location and Excavation The Tomb of the Painted Sarcophagus is located some six meters south of the Tholos B annex in the Agia Triada Cemetery. It was excavated by Paribeni in 1903 and was appar- ently reburied sometime after excavation. Architecture The tomb is nearly square, with outside measurements of ca. 3.85 by ca. 4.10 m. It is oriented east-west and is built with rubble walls, rather more carefully constructed than most, laid on the natural bedrock slope. The walls are unusual for their width, which is relatively large in comparison to the small area enclosed and sufficient to support an upper story.15 The eastern wall is broken at the north by a doorway, ca. 0.87 m. wide, the threshold of which is formed by the continuation of the wall at its base. The doorway pro- vides access to a single small room measuring ca. 1.95 by ca. 2.39 m. At the time of the excavation it was noted that the upper surfaces of the walls were preserved to a uniform horizontal level,16 and it was suggested that the preserved surface represented the bedding for a superstructure of mud brick or wood. It was also suggested that the building resembled the tomb represented on the painted sarcophagus that was found inside and might also have had an elaborately painted facade.17 4 Room 10: Festos II, pp. 110-115. 15 Walls: W. 0.90-0.95 m.; H. of south wall ca. 1.20 m. 16 Paribeni, MonAnt 14, 1904, pp. 715-716, fig. 19. 17 Long (The Ayia Triada Sarcophagus, pp. 49-50) has pointed to several Mycenaean tombs with painted facades that have been excavated since and provide good parallels. 125</page><page sequence="146">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS A B 0 1 2 3m. 6 1 1 1L FIG. 57.

Location and Excavation This tomb, which is still visible, is located southeast of the modern village of Agios Georgios in Siteia (formerly known as Tourtouli) on the northeast slope of Mount Manta- lia. It is situated at the southern end of a long terrace, one of several running around this side of the hill. At the south the terrace is no wider than seven meters, but towards the north, where it is planted with olive trees, it widens considerably, and it is possible that this section of the terrace accommodated other tombs. The tomb was excavated by Nicholas Platon in 1959.18 Architecture The tomb is tucked into a small rectangular space that opens to the north. It skirts the edge of the terrace on the east and is sheltered by a low earth cliff that rises above it to the west. Originally the tomb must have been nearly square, with an over-all north-south measurement of ca. 5.40 m. It enclosed at least two adjacent oblong rooms running north-south. The tomb is now partially destroyed, part of the northern face of the north wall by plowing in the adjacent field, and the entire stretch of its east wall as well as large portions of the adjoining side walls by the erosion of the terrace. The parallel north and south walls back against the face of the cliff to the west. Only the western end of the north wall remains; the south wall is the better preserved.19 They are constructed in the usual rubble, that on the south with a large number of irregularly laid small stones at its west end. The southern wall appears to have been connected at its pre- served east end to a large stone lying ca. 0.40 m. to the south, thus forming a kind of external niche ca. 0.65 m. wide and ca. 0.40 m. deep. There are no signs of any doorway leading into the tomb or between its two rooms, and while an outside doorway might have existed in one of the destroyed walls to the east, it seems likely that each room was entered at a level above the preserved socle of the walls or through a separate opening from the roof. The east, outer room is largely destroyed, but its dimensions were probably similar to those of the west, inner room.

The maximum distance from this wall to the edge of the terrace to the east is 3.10 m., and it is doubtful that this space accommodated more than one room. The L-shaped room to the west of the central partition wall measures ca. 4.13 m. north-south, ca. 1.52 m. at the wider south end, and ca. 0.86 m. at the north. Its western wall, the rear wall of the tomb, consists of two separate but connecting walls, both only a single course wide. The northern half, constructed of larger stones than the southern, runs ca. 2.13 m. south from the north wall before turning west at a right angle towards the face of the cliff. The southern half, set back, west of this return, does not bond with the return of the northern half or with the outer south wall.21 The tomb is unusual for its type (tombs with side walls running back to the face of a cliff) in that instead of using some part of the cliff for its rear wall, as do so many of the tombs at Mochlos, its rear wall is formed completely by a built wall placed a considerable distance, 1.48-1.90 m., in front of the cliff. This construc- tion may be due to the type of cliff, which is earth and not rock, but it should be noted that the side walls run back beyond the rear wall on either side of the earth fill, as much as 1.45 m. on the south to the point where the side wall actually hits the face of the cliff, and it may be that the fill behind the west wall, especially behind the southern part, conceals another small room. Burials and Chronology Scattered bones are reported from the inner west room, and undisturbed burials are reported from its square southern end. The pottery includes a total of about 50 complete or nearly complete vases, mostly jugs and small cups. No examples are illustrated, but they are reported to belong entirely to the last phase of the Prepalatial period. Many vases were found against the walls outside the tomb and apparently in a niche at the preserved southeast corner, where a small pit had been dug. In the excavator's view these once held offerings of food for the dead. THE ARCHANES CEMETERY Phourni, the burial site of ancient Archanes, is a long hill lying at the northeast foot of Mount Juktas and extending between the modern towns of Epano and Kato Archanes (Fig. 59). Its southern end lies about a kilometer northwest of Epano Archanes, the site of the ancient town, and the ancient cemetery has been uncovered on top of the hill at this end. It is an impressive location with the peak of Juktas towering on one side and the town of Archanes, its houses often using the foundations of the ancient Minoan houses, lying below on the other.22 The cemetery is one of the best preserved in Crete and provides some of the most com- plete examples of house tombs. It covers a large area, extending about 150 meters north- south along the southeast end of Phourni. Some 24 funerary buildings of various types have been partly or completely uncovered so far, and excavations still continue.

Burials began to be made in the cemetery in the EM II phase in both house tombs (6 and perhaps 7) and in at least one tholos (E) and continued to be made in the EM III phase in still another (F), which is the earliest surviving example of a corbel-vaulted tholos. The largest number of burials and the greatest amount of building in the cemetery, however, belong to the end of the Prepalatial period, when Tomb 6 was enlarged and re-used, when Tomb E was also re-used and antechambers (16 and 9) were added to both E and F, and when entirely new house tombs (8, 12, 18, and 19) and the monumental Tomb B were all constructed. A large number of individuals were buried in these tombs at this time, and as if there were not space enough to accommodate everyone inside the tombs, many were buried directly in the ground in the large open area west and south of Tomb F. In the Old Palace period the number of burials appears to have fallen off somewhat. They continued to be made in Tomb 19 and also in Tomb 5, which may have been built as an addition to Tomb 3. By this time, as a result of continued construction over hundreds of years and repeated use, the cemetery had assumed what is practically a closed plan with its individual tombs closely packed together, either attached to one another or separated by narrow and winding pas- sages, themselves sometimes blocked by supplementary walls, and with many of its tomb chambers accessible only from above. In the New Palace period burials continued to be made in Tombs 3 and B, and at least two buildings that served ritual functions (4 and 17) appear to have been built to service them. In the Mycenaean era still more burials were made in tholos tombs (A and A) and in shaft graves (11). Many of the buildings in the cemetery provided for religious needs as well as for burials; the dual nature of the site as necropolis and religious center may account for its uninterrupted use through nearly the whole duration of Minoan-Mycenaean civilization. The cemetery is also important historically, for the two main types of Minoan tombs, tholos and house tomb, one characteristic of the Mesara, the other of central and eastern Crete, come together here. From the time the cemetery began to be used, they were built adjacent to one another, and when the greatest building activity in the cemetery occurred and it was used more than ever, the two types were thoroughly integrated, and the tholos was concealed behind or inside the house tomb. Clearly the proliferation of tombs in the MM Ia phase reflects an increase in the population using them, but the combination of the two different types of tombs in the same cemetery, indeed the unification of the two in the case of Tomb B, may also reflect a political combination of two different cultural elements in the area that is responsible for the increase in population and the great spurt of building activity. The excavation of the Archanes cemetery began in 1965 and is being carried out under the direction of lannis and Effie Sakellarakis.23 23 I am indebted to the excavators for permission to study these tombs and reproduce plans they have pub- lished in "Epyov and IlpaKrcla. For the most part I have followed the excavators' account in my own descrip- tion, but not always, and my remarks should be considered tentative until the final publication of the cemetery appears. 131</page><page sequence="152">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS 5.

Location and Excavation Tomb B lies near the middle of the Archanes cemetery. It is built on top of an earlier tomb on the site (Tomb 7) and is hemmed in by structures of varying dates on the west, south, and northeast. On the west an earlier building, Tomb 6, lies at a higher level, sup- ported by a high retaining wall and separated from Tomb B by a cul-de-sac. Immediately south lies Tomb 3, which was built so close to the south wall of Tomb B that one cannot pass between the two buildings. A short distance to the northeast lies a later structure that was never used as a tomb, Building 4 (Fig. 59). To the north it seems likely that an open area within the cemetery was faced by both the north faCade of Tomb B and the portico of Building 4, and from it a paved ramp led up to the higher ground level to the west. The excavators have suggested that an opening to the tomb may have been located at the de- stroyed northeast corner of the building, at least in the final stage of its use. The building was excavated in a series of campaigns carried out in 1966, 1967, 1971, 1972, 1973, and 1986. Architecture The tomb is the largest at Archanes. Standing two stories high, with over-all measure- ments of ca. 16 m. on the south side and ca. 15.40 m. on the west, it is one of only a few house tombs that might be described as monumental. In size, plan, and details of construction it is an innovative building and stands as an important landmark in the history of Minoan archi- tecture. It was used for a long period of time and underwent a number of alterations but was originally conceived as a unified structure and laid out with a carefully planned, almost symmetrical design. It consists of a massive rectangular building, oriented north-south, with projecting corners preserved at the northwest, southwest, and southeast. Inside, it is divided into two distinct, interconnecting areas with tholos and adjacent chambers located in the northern half of the building and pillar crypt with related rooms in the southern half. The outer walls of the tomb are constructed in a distinctive style of rubble masonry.24 Stones with roughly rectangular faces are laid in regular courses of approximately the same height, and the vertical and horizontal spaces between stones are filled out with earth mor- tar and stone chips in a decorative fashion. In addition, the bases of the north and west walls are decorated with freestanding upright slabs laid against the walls to form a dado. The walls on the north, west, and east are extremely wide, and, together with a fourth wall located midway inside the tomb and running parallel to the outer north wall, were designed to support the vault of the tholos and in places the rubble fill that surrounded the vault. The tholos was originally isolated within these walls in the north half of the tomb. It has a base diameter of ca. 4.80 m., and its walls are built with large blocks, smoothed and 24 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1971, pls. 291 and 294, right. 132</page><page sequence="153">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY FIG. 60.

The walls of the side chamber are slightly corbeled at the top in order to narrow the span for the ceiling, which is formed of huge stone slabs, two of which are in situ. The tholos was origi- nally entered at the southeast through a long dromos leading from the southeast corner of the tomb. The walls of the dromos are set back at the tops, and the ceiling was closed by slabs resting on these setbacks. During its period of use a number of rough rubble walls were constructed to block the inner part of the dromos,26 and at the end of this period the entry into the tholos was carefully blocked so that only the large curving lintel block of the entry is still distinguishable in the wall. At the end of its period of use, in the LM IIIa phase, a new opening was cut in the northeast wall of the tholos, leading to another room and probably to a new entrance. At the same time the floor of the tholos was raised and a bench 25 Sakellarakis, ripaKrcLK 1966, pl. 146:a. 26 Sakellarakis, IpaKrLiKa 1966, pl. 147:8. 133</page><page sequence="154">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS with rounded edges erected around it. The whole area, including floor, bench, and walls, was then covered with a reddish plaster, much of which still remains. Two other rooms lie north of the tholos, both isolated from it and probably entered from above. The room at the northwest corner of the tomb is part of the original building, but that lying along the northern wall is an addition27 and is not built with the same care as the rest of the building. The pillar-crypt complex, located in the southern half of the tomb, consists of four main rooms.28 The southern is a long corridor that extend the whole width of the tomb. At the east it gives access to the dromos leading to the tholos and to a narrow rectangular room to the north. At this end it is paved, as is the room to the north. Towards the west the corridor leads up over an initial step formed by the east wall of Tomb 7, over the buried south compartment of this earlier tomb, and up a flight of five steps to a large rectangular room at the west end of the pillar crypt complex. This room lies at the second-story level in the tomb and gives access through a doorway in its east wall to a room that lay immediately above the pillar crypt. The pillar crypt itself consists of a basement room ca. 3.50 m. square.29 The lower parts of the walls are constructed in courses of flattish, neatly laid stones broken on the inside by vertical chases for wooden beams; above these lower courses, at the top of the vertical beam chases, the walls are constructed more irregularly with rough stones that project slightly beyond the lower courses. This break between smooth and rough construction marks the approximate level of the upper floor. A rectangular niche, set at the northeast corner of the crypt two to three courses above floor level, extends the height of the lower wall. A some- what enigmatic window or small doorway located at the southeast corner30 may have pro- vided access to the crypt from the south corridor, but it also appears to have opened into the buried south chamber of Tomb 7. The crypt is built on top of this earlier tomb, which may be significant, and uses part of its walls for its own south wall and apparently part of its paved floor for its own floor. The pillar, located in the center of the crypt, is built of roughly squared blocks; the upper surface of the top block, worn smooth and flat, lies near the level of the second-story floor, the crossbeams of which the pillar apparently supported. Frag- ments of painted plaster found throughout the crypt, many with a combination of colors, were thought to belong to frescos that may have decorated the walls of the upper room. At the southwest a doorway opened from the crypt into an adjacent room to the west. Burials and Chronology Remains of burials have been uncovered at several points inside the tomb. In the pillar- crypt complex, skeletal remains were found in different strata of the southwest projecting room;31 in the westernmost room at ground-floor level, burials were found on the floor and in a sarcophagus, walled in at the northern end of the room and reached by a staircase from above, with as many as 13 burials inside;32 and in the crypt itself, skeletal fragments and 27 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1971, pl. 291, right. 28 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKac 1967, pl. 137. 29 Sakellarakis, HpaKLTKa 1967, pl. 138. 30 Sakellarakis, ipaKT&amp;KaO 1967, pl. 143:3, lower left. 31 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1971, pl. 298. 32 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1986, pl. 116. 134</page><page sequence="155">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY pieces of sarcophagi were thought to have fallen from the upper room. Undisturbed burials were discovered in both the eastern section of the south corridor and in the room imme- diately north of this area, in which a contracted burial was found just above the pavement, oriented north-south. Only the mandible was in situ; the remainder of the skull was found a short distance to the northeast, beside the feet of the skeleton. A conical cup had been placed beneath the mandible and another cup, inverted, by the remaining part of the skull. At the east end of the south corridor before the dromos, six complete larnakes were uncovered, all but one resting on the pavement and all but one oriented east-west.33 No undisturbed skele- tons are reported from the larnakes, but some 15 skulls were found in four of them, includ- ing five in one larnax alone, as well as other fragmentary skeletal remains, and some 15 additional skulls were found in the spaces between larnakes. One undisturbed burial is reported beneath a larnax; it lay in contracted position with the head to the east.34 Only a few scattered skeletal fragments are reported from the tholos, although one would expect it to be the principal burial chamber of the tomb. The deposit beneath the LM III floor, however, has not been completely excavated. In the original dromos, the remains of dogs, including skulls and complete skeletons, were found near the entrance to the tholos after the second blocking wall. Further undisturbed burials are reported from the northwest room of the tomb and the addition along the north wall. In the northwest room a skeleton was found at floor level along the south wall, together with fragments of larnakes. The skeleton had been placed in contracted position on its right side with the head to the east. In the north addition two burial strata were uncovered: in the upper stratum, a larnax placed against the south wall, oriented east-west, and two skeletons in the southwest corner;35 in the lower stratum, other undisturbed burials in the southwest corner and along the east wall. The earliest pottery reported from inside the tomb belongs to the MM Ia phase. In addition, a large deposit of MM Ia pottery was found in the cul-de-sac alongside the west faCade.36 It included some 272 complete or nearly complete vessels, several pieces, including one kernos and a composite vessel, of a ritual nature.37 The distinctive style of masonry used in the facades and the pillar crypt have close parallels in other architectural remains of the MM Ia phase,38 and the construction of the tomb is dated to this time. The tomb is reported to have continued in use to the end of the Neopalatial period and was re-used in the LM IIIa phase. 33 Sakellarakis, IlpaKToKa 1967, pl. 139.

Location and Excavation Tombs 3 and 5 lie in the space between Tomb B on the north and Tomb F on the south.39 They were built separately, and in the excavator's view Tomb 3, which is flanked by Tomb 5 on the west and south, is a later addition that displaced the eastern part of the latter. The reverse, however, may also be possible, namely that Tomb 3 is the original unit and the various rooms of Tomb 5 were added to its west and south at a later time. The two tombs were excavated over several years. Most of the work on Tomb 3 was carried out in 1966, and most of the work on Tomb 5 was done in 1967 and 1972. Architecture Tomb 3, conceived as a separate unit, is a rectangular building ca. 6.50 m. wide and ca. 7.90 m. long.40 Like Tomb B it was a two-story building with the lower story built entirely in stone. Although only the lower story remains intact, it is one of the best preserved tombs on the site, or anywhere in Crete. The outer walls resemble those of Tomb B on the outside but are constructed differently and in a more advanced fashion. The blocks are roughly dressed only in front and on top and bottom; they are wedge shaped at the back and set in rudimentary ashlar technique in the outer faces of the walls with ordinary rubble construc- tion behind. Quantities of plaster, including red and white fragments, were found inside the tomb and probably covered the rubble faces of the interior walls. There is no entrance to the tomb through its lower story; entry must have come at some point in the upper story, perhaps at the northeast corner or from the roof. A staircase con- structed in two parts along the eastern side led from the upper story to a lower-story landing.41 It provides access to a long corridor on the lower story that runs north-south par- allel to the staircase and in turn provides access to the two main rooms in the western part of the tomb. The larger, southern room is entered through a doorway over a threshold that marks the original floor level of the lower story. At some point in its use the room was divided in half by a roughly constructed north-south wall. The base of this later partition wall rests on loose fill, well above the level of the threshold. The northern room,42 which is entered from the central corridor through a doorway also provided with a built threshold, is some- what smaller than the southern but was also divided at a later time by a north-south wall. At the time of its construction Tomb 3 was flanked by other tombs on the north, east, and south and perhaps also by a retaining wall on the west, supporting the higher ground level like that to the west of Tomb B. The tomb then appears to have been enlarged by the three separate and consecutive additions that constitute Tomb 5. The first was made in two 39 Sakellarakis, IIpaKrTKa 1967, pi. 359:/3. 40 Sakellarakis, IIpaKrKca 1967, pl. 146:,3. 41 Sakellarakis, HIpaKTLKa 1967, pl. 146:a. 42 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1971, pl. 299. 136</page><page sequence="157">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY parts along the west and south sides of the tomb (Fig. 60). That on the south, which con- sists of three rooms (7, 8a, and 8b), fills the long and narrow space between Tomb 3 and Tomb r, while that on the west, which also consists of three rooms (5a, 5b, and 6), rests on top of the earlier wall that flanked Tomb 3 on this side. Another compartment with three rooms (2, 3, and 4) was then added along the western side of the first western addition, and still another compartment with only one room (1) was added along the western side of this addition, set back and extending somewhat beyond it to the north. None of the walls of these additions bonds with those of the others, nor do any of their walls bond with those of Tomb 3. It is specifically the construction of the rooms in the first western addition that shows that Tomb 5 is an addition to Tomb 3 and not, as the excavator suggested, an earlier tomb that was partly destroyed in order to make room for the construction of Tomb 3. The north wall of this addition carefully abuts the outer west wall of Tomb 3, and its interior east-west walls, which are cut back at the east to form doorways along the eastern side of the addition, also carefully abut the outer west wall of Tomb 3 at the base where they extend beneath the doorways as thresholds. All this construction, which shows no signs of repair or rebuilding, could have been done only after the west wall of Tomb 3 was completed. The result of these additions is a tomb running east-west, the first additions on the east and south lying at nearly the same level as Tomb 3 and considerably lower than the two later additions to the west, which rest on the rising bedrock. Each addition, although joined in a single continuous structure, was designed as a separate unit. Thus, the first eastern addition has its own entrance through a doorway at the north, and each of its three rooms is approached by the corridor running along its east side. The south addition is isolated from the east addition and, with the exception of Room 7, which is provided with its own internal doorway,43 appears to have been entered from above. The second addition on the west has its own entrance through a doorway on the south, and each of its three rooms is entered by a corridor with doorways opening along its western side. The last, westernmost addition ap- pears to have been entered from above. Burials and Chronology The excavation of Tomb 3 revealed three main strata. The lowest contained nothing of importance, and the excavator believed it to be a simple earth fill thrown in to raise the floor level. It should be noted, however, that this fill contained the fragment of a "sheep bell"44 in the northwest room and that it covered the original floor level of the tomb. The middle or second stratum in the tomb contained scattered skeletal remains in all rooms and fragments of larnakes as well as animal teeth in the southwest room. Several of the remains were in situ. A larnax designed to hold an infant burial lay near the center of the northern part of the central corridor, oriented east-west, and just to its south lay two feet of a second, similar larnax.45 A complete skull lay in the southwest corner of this corridor. In the southwest room another complete skull was found in the northwest corner, and the remains of a skeleton, oriented east-west with head to the west,46 were found along the south wall.

The upper stratum of the tomb contained more skeletal remains as well as fragments of larnakes in all but the south part of the corridor, where the stratum was destroyed. All these remains were scattered, however, and since finds in the stratum belonging together came from different rooms, they may have fallen from the second story. Schist slabs also found at this level are thought to have fallen from the roof of the building. All the rooms of Tomb 5 contained burial remains, some of which were in situ. The westernmost compartment (Room 1) was tightly packed with some 21 pithoi and two lar- nakes, all filled with skulls. Most of the pithoi had been placed right side up on stone bases in neat north-south lines,48 while others had been placed on their sides or upside down and were sometimes bounded by stones. The best-preserved pithoi in the northwest section of the room contained from one to four skulls each.49 A larnax in the northwest corner, oriented north-south, held some ten separate skulls.50 The central compartment (Rooms 2-4) contained scattered skeletal remains in each of is rooms, including fragments of larnakes in the central room and animal bones in the northern room. The eastern com- partment (Rooms 5a, 5b, 6) contained burials in larnakes and on the floor. Two larnakes were found in the northern room, one in the northeast corner, oriented east-west, and one in the southwest. A third was found at the entrance to the southern room, oriented north- south, containing the remains of a contracted burial with the head to the north.51 Another contracted burial lay on the floor to the west. The southern compartment (Rooms 7, 8a, 8b) also held burials on the floor and in larnakes. Room 7 was packed with bones, including some 37 skulls, together with at least 19 vases and a number of sea shells.52 The skulls were stacked, some on stone slabs, some in vases, on top of one another and extended above the lintel of the doorway in such a way that they must have been deposited from above. Room 8a contained at least five larnakes and two burial pithoi as well as some 31 skulls deposited on the floor at the narrow sides of the room.53 A number of sea shells and animal teeth were also found at this level. At a lower level in the room remains of further burials were found on the floor, including some 11 skulls with approximately 70 vases, mostly dishes and conical cups, stacked in vases; by one skull a conical cup had been placed in inverted posi- tion. Sea shells and animal bones were also found here. Room 8b contained two larnakes, one on the eastern, one on the western side of the room, each with the remains of two skele- tons. Beneath the eastern larnax four skulls were found together with seashells and a bull rhyton.54 Although the pottery from these tombs has not been definitively studied yet and only a few examples are published, that from Tomb 5 is reported to belong to the earlier part of the 47 Sakellarakis, IlpaKTLKa 1966, pi. 147:a. 48 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKa' 1967, pl. 150:a. 49 Sakellarakis, HpaKTKa' 1967, pl. 151. 50 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKa 1967, pi. 150:/3. 51 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKa 1972, pl. 268:,3. 52 Sakellarakis, rpaKTLKa 1972, pl. 269. 53 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKa' 1972, pl. 273. 54 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLiKa 1972, pl. 277. 138</page><page sequence="159">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY Old Palace period, and that from Tomb 3 is reported to be Neopalatial. In the excavator's view, Tomb 3 dates to the New Palace period and displaced the older Tomb 5 on the site when it was built. It is significant, however, that the lowest stratum in Tomb 3 consisted of simple earth fill, placed above the original floor level of the tomb, and it may be that the tomb was actually built and used at a much earlier time than its pottery suggests. The fragment of a "sheep bell" (p. 230 below) reported in its lowest stratum suggests a date in the MM I phase, and the incipient ashlar construction of its outer walls suggests a date at the beginning of the Old Palace period for its erection and initial use. In this case, it may be that the tomb, erected and first used in the MM Ib phase, was cleaned of its earliest contents before it was used in the Neopalatial period and that the compartments erected successively to the west and south were built to hold the material from periodic cleanings of the tomb. The last cleaning would have occurred just before the Neopalatial use of the tomb, and at this time its floor level would have been raised in preparation for new burials. 7.

Location and Excavation Building 4 lies a little more than five meters to the northeast of Tomb B along the eastern edge of the cemetery. It faces west towards a large flat area that probably lay open within the cemetery. The building was first examined in 1966 and 1967, and its excavation was resumed in 1974 and 1977. Architecture Building 4 is a rectangular structure, nearly 14 meters long, divided into two parts by a wall on its north-south axis. On the west, where the bedrock lies at a higher level, a large terrace, five to six meters wide, runs the entire length of the building and faces the open area to the north of Tomb B. This terrace was paved with large stone slabs, several of which still lie in situ along its outer, west side. It is unclear whether they covered the entire area of the terrace, but a foundation wall preserved midway at the north and south ends of the terrace appears to have been designed to support further slabs. Three round stone bases that once supported wooden columns were found at various points on the terrace. One of these, which rests on top of the pavement along the very edge of the terrace, appears to be in situ, and a colonnade supporting a flat roof apparently ran along the west facade. On the east, where the bedrock falls away, eight basement rooms are preserved below the level of the west terrace. Rooms 1 and 2 on the south are the larger and more important of these. Room 2 may be entered from the outside by a doorway, flanked by a window, in the outer, east wall of the room. It in turn provides access to Room 1 by a doorway at its south- east corner and, by another doorway at the northeast corner, to a very narrow corridor running north just inside the east wall of the building. The floors of both Rooms I and 2 have been cut out of bedrock, and the rooms were used for important activities within the building. With the exception of Room 4, where 13 conical cups were found stacked one 139</page><page sequence="160">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS 0 , 2m. " FIG. 61. Archanes, Building 4 (after Sakellarakis, lpaKTLKa 1977, p. 462, fig. 2) upon the other together with a bronze knife, few finds were made in the rooms north of Rooms 1 and 2, and the excavator has suggested that these small rooms (3 to 8) served only to provide foundation walls for structures in the upper floor. At least three rooms may be restored on the main floor level above the basement rooms in the eastern half of the building: one each above Rooms 1 and 2, the third above Rooms 3 to 8. Remains of the flooring of these rooms, including stone slabs covered with lime cement, were found fallen into the rooms below. Although no evidence for doorways on this upper level has survived, they were presumably located in the western walls of these rooms and permitted passage directly from the west terrace. In architectural design and perhaps function as well, the building recalls the small LM III terracotta model from Kamilari 140</page><page sequence="161">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY Tomb I,55 which is also provided with a terrace and colonnade and appears to represent a funerary building where offerings are being made to the dead. Function and Chronology No burials were found in Building 4. It was never used as a tomb, and only some of its several functions are clearly funerary. Its west terrace was used as a place of offering: a large number of conical cups were found here.56 The largest deposit was located in the southeast corner of the terrace, where some 248 conical cups were found intact and where more than 2000 fragments of bases belonging to similar cups were also found. Many of the complete cups had been placed upside down. The deposit, which also contained two "milk jugs", the fragment of a four-sided stone offering table, and fragments of two "bell vases", ranges in date from the end of the Prepalatial period to the beginning of the Neopalatial period. It is thought to have been laid down, however, perhaps as a foundation deposit, only at the beginning of the Neopalatial period. In virtually all the rooms in the eastern half of the building were found numerous fragments of plaster, often lying in small heaps. They had apparently fallen from the walls on the upper level; they were painted in an array of colors and indicate that the upper-floor walls were richly decorated. Most finds in this part of the building came from Rooms 1 and 2, where they lay in two strata. In the upper strata in both rooms, where the contents of the upper-floor rooms are thought to have fallen, numerous fragments of pithoi, various stone tools, including pestles, querns, and obsidian blades, and material for the preparation of dies were found. Some 47 loom weights were also found in these two rooms, most in the upper strata, and most from Room 2, where a vertical loom is thought to have stood against the south wall.57 Part of a female figurine was also found in Room 1,58 and three tripod cooking pots, thought to belong to the upper floor, were found in Room 2. The excavator has identified both corresponding rooms on the upper floor as workrooms or storerooms. In the lower stratum in Room 1 was found a complete pithos fallen on the floor in the southeast corner, together with several other vases, including one with the remains of olive pits near by; this room too appears to have served as a storeroom or pantry. In the lower stratum of Room 2 a large spouted vat, used for making wine or olive oil, was found fallen at the southeast side. The rock floor of this room is cut at two levels; the vat originally sat on the higher level on a stone platform against the south wall with its spout turned towards the east, where the floor was cut out to receive the runoff. Two shallow residue basins are cut in the floor along the north side, and the area appears most suitable for the production of wine. The excavator compared the building to similar establishments in Egyptian cemeteries used for ritual purposes and for the preparation of goods used in ceremonies. The discovery of cooking equipment, large numbers of conical cups (in addition to those placed as offer- ings on the terrace), and the remains of animal bones in the building suggests that eating and drinking, perhaps a funerary banquet, were among the ceremonies performed here. 55 Levi, ASAtene 23-24, 1961-1962, pp. 124-127, fig. 70. 56 Sakellarakis, fIpaKrtKa 1974, pl. 154. 57 Sakellarakis, HpaKrtKd 1974, pl. 153. 58 Sakellarakis, IpaKTLKa 1974, pl. 150:8. 141</page><page sequence="162">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS The area above Rooms 3 to 8 could even have served as a dining room. The excavator has dated the building to the Neopalatial period, but large amounts of MM Ia and Protopala- tial pottery were also uncovered beneath floor levels of the building and against the outer east wall. 8. ARCHANES 6 (Figs. 59 and 60) Sakellarakis, Kadmos IV, 1965, pp. 177-178; Sakellarakis, AeXTr 21, 1966, pp. 411-412; Sakellarakis, Illustrated London News, 1966, pp. 32-33; Sakellarakis, Archaeology 20, 1967, p. 276; Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1973, pp. 111-113; Sakellarakis, HpaKT&amp;Ka 1973, pp. 167-171; Hiller, Minoische Kreta, p. 108. Location and Excavation Tomb 6 lies on the west side of the cemetery at a higher level than Tomb B. It is ap- proached from the lower ground level and open area to the north of Tomb B by a paved ramp running east-west up the slope of Phourni.59 The tomb was excavated in 1965-1966 and again in 1973. Architecture The tomb appears originally to have been a single, oblong building, ca. 6.80 m. in length, consisting of two parallel rooms, 1 and 3. Sometime after the construction of this original core at least four additional rooms were added on the north and west. The south, rear wall of the tomb reflects these successive additions: its broken series of vertical setbacks was created as new rooms were added, reflecting the internal structure. All the walls are built of ordinary rubble and form level socles designed to support mud brick above. Each room of the original building has its own doorway, Room 1 at the north and Room 3 at the east. A rectangular alcove (Room 6), destroyed at the east, was added in front of the doorway of Room 1, and the doorway of Room 3 was blocked by a rubble wall. Each provided access to a long rectangular room with irregular bedrock floor. Room 3 was sub- divided by a short spur wall at the north. The later rooms added to the west (2, 4, 5) have no visible doorways and were presumably entered from the roof. Burials and Chronology The most extensive remains were found in Rooms 1 and 3, where the burials consisted mostly of skulls, some 196 counted; no complete skeletons were found. Two burial strata were uncovered. In the lower, skulls were deposited on the earth floor and in vases;60 in the upper, they were placed in pithoi61 and in larnakes, oriented for the most part north-south with the long axis of the room62 and so closely packed together that the last burials in Room 1 were thought to have been lowered in place from the roof. Of the later rooms added to the west and north, Room 2 contained no finds, "as if it had never been used."63 Rooms 4 and 5 contained fragmentary skeletal remains and pieces of sarcophagi, enough to indicate that 59 Sakellarakis, HpaKTiKa 1973, pl. 172:a. 60 Sakellarakis, Archaeology 20, 1967, fig. 2. 61 Sakellarakis, AEAT 21, 1966, pi. 439:,8. 62 Sakellarakis, Archaeology 20, 1967, fig. 3. 63 Sakellarakis, Kadmos IV, 1965, p. 178. 142</page><page sequence="163">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY burials had probably been made here in the same fashion as in the upper strata of Rooms 1 and 3. The northern addition to the tomb (6) also served for burials; five skulls as well as other fragmentary skeletal material were found here. Of special interest among the finds in this room is a large flat stone, located in the northwest corner, on which various objects had been placed in a row. These included two cups, both inverted, two sea shells, and a "sheep bell".64 Other finds in the room included fragments of animal teeth and at a lower level the fragments of another "sheep bell". The pottery in the later rooms (4, 5, 6) is dated to the MM Ia phase, the same time that the ramp at the north was constructed. Only examples of this pottery have as yet been illustrated, but in the early publications of the tomb, pottery ranging in date from EM II to MM Ia is reported from Rooms 1 and 3. The larnax burials in the upper stratum of Rooms 1 and 3 should belong to the MM Ia phase, and presumably therefore the burials in the lower stratum and the construction of the original two-room unit to the earlier phases.65 9. ARCHANES 7 (Fig. 60) Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKa 1967, pp. 153-157; Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1971, pp. 239-243. Location and Excavation Tomb 7 lies beneath the southern chambers of Tomb B, and some of its walls serve as foundations for the walls of the later tomb. It was excavated in 1967 and 1971. Architecture The plan of the tomb is obscured by the later building above it, but it appears to have consisted of three narrow, rectangular compartments lying parallel in the same manner as those of Tomb 6. Two of the compartments lie beneath the pillar crypt of the later tomb, extending beneath and east of its east wall; the third compartment lies to the south of the crypt, partly beneath the staircase in the south corridor of the later tomb and partly in front of it. The southern compartment is the best preserved, for it seems to have been incorporated into the later tomb for a special purpose.66 Its south wall lies just inside and adjacent to the outer south wall of the later tomb; its north wall, which is the south wall of the central compartment, is preserved beneath the south wall of the later pillar crypt running at the base of a "window" in the wall of the crypt; its east wall is preserved a short distance east of the later staircase. The central compartment of the tomb, which extended beneath the east wall of the later pillar crypt, is paved with carefully laid limestone slabs.67 Its north wall is only partly preserved where it forms the south wall of the northern compartment. Only the western wall of the northern compartment is preserved.68 It is set back from the west line of the other compartments of the tomb and does not bond with the north wall of the central 64 Sakellarakis, IIpaKTLKa 1973, pl. 171:a. For "sheep bells" see p. 230 below. 65 Sakellarakis has noted that the eastern rooms of Tomb 6 are apparently contemporary with the earliest tholos tomb on the site, Tomb E (FIpaKTrKa 1975, p. 307, note 1). 66 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKca 1967, pl. 143:/3. 67 Sakellarakis, rIpaKTLKd 1967, pl. 138:a. 68 Sakellarakis, HpaKTrKa 1967, pl. 138:/8. 143</page><page sequence="164">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS compartment. The room is analogous in these respects to Room 2 in Tomb 6 and is probably also an addition. The eastern and western boundaries of the tomb are unclear, but the excavator has suggested that the tomb extended east all the way into the paved area before the dromos of Tomb B and the paved area to the north, east of the dromos. Both these areas, however, are enclosed by the walls of the later tomb, and since the finds from these areas are contempo- rary with the earliest finds from other locations in the later tomb, they would seem to belong to it and not to Tomb 7. Burials and Chronology Scattered skeletal remains were uncovered in each of the three compartments. Some six skulls were collected from the southern compartment, but apparently no complete skeleton. In the central compartment an undisturbed burial was uncovered resting on the paved floor. It lay contracted on its right side with the head to the east. The pottery from the tomb has not been published, but the tomb must antedate the MM Ia Tomb B under which it lies. It may therefore be contemporary with the original structure of Tomb 6, which it seems to resemble closely. 10. ARCHANES 8 (Fig. 59) Sakellarakis, HpaKTrKa 1973, pp. 177-179; Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1982, p. 54; Hiller, Minoische Kreta, p. 108. Location and Excavation Tomb 8 lies at the southeast corner of Tomb B. It is flanked on the west by Tomb 3 and on the south by the antechambers of tholos Tomb r and is separated from all three tombs by a narrow passage that was blocked off at various points by crosswalls. The tomb was discov- ered in 1971 and excavated in 1972 and 1982. Architecture The tomb is a two-room rectangular building roughly five meters square. The north, west, and south walls are well preserved and appear to have been built entirely in stone to the height of one story. Only the lower courses of the east wall are preserved; as a result, it is unclear whether the tomb was entered from above, as was Tomb 3, or through a doorway at some point above the stone foundations of the east wall. The interior is divided by a north-south spur wall into two narrow, rectangular rooms connected by a doorway at the south that was blocked with stones at the time of excavation.69 The north wall in both rooms rests on a foundation that projects inside and forms a high bench; the west wall and the spur wall also rest on projecting foundation walls, which form a paved floor over a large part of both rooms and which the excavator believes belong to an earlier building phase.70 Burials and Chronology Most of the burials were found in the western room. One burial was uncovered in the southwest corner, apparently surrounded by stones, with a sea shell and an inverted conical 69 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKa 1973, pl. 173:a. 70 Sakellarakis, IlpaKTLKa 1973, pl. 173:/3. 144</page><page sequence="165">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY cup. The main burial stratum was located beneath. Here the remains of 14 individuals were uncovered; 12 were placed along the north wall, their skulls exactly on or alongside the bench. The only object found with them was a fruitstand placed upside down on the bench.71 Two other skulls were found in the southern half of the room, one by the doorway with a conical cup attached to the forepart of the skull. Other finds in the room included a sea shell, animal bones, and teeth. Along the southern side of the eastern room were found a few skele- tal remains with two inverted conical cups. Two burials with skulls surviving were found along the north side of the room. All the pottery in the tomb is dated to the MM Ia phase. Outside and along the north wall of the tomb eight vases, including four conical cups, and a small animal figurine were uncovered. In the corridor outside the south wall of the tomb, which was subdivided by crosswalls, 18 additional burials were uncovered. 11. ARCHANES 12 (Fig. 59) Sakellarakis, IlpaKrLKa 1973, pp. 174-177; Hiller, Minoische Kreta, p. 109. Location and Excavation Tomb 12 is located immediately south of Tomb 6, between it and the western rooms of Tomb 5 on the higher ground level above Tomb B. It is approached by a paved walk that runs along the east side of Tomb 6. It was excavated in 1973. Architecture Since the area was badly eroded before excavation, the tomb itself was largely de- stroyed, and its plan is lost. Traces of exterior walls are preserved along the north and east sides of the building, however, and part of an interior wall is preserved where it abuts the northwest corner of Tomb 5. Areas within these walls were paved. Burials and Chronology The main burials were uncovered on either side of the surviving interior wall. Remains of one burial were found on the west, and remains of some 35 skulls were found in two areas to its east. All were placed directly on the ground, but fragments of sarcophagi were also found. Conical cups, together with other stone and clay vases and remains of animal bones, were found with several of the burials. The pottery is dated to the MM Ia phase. 12. ARCHANES 17 (Fig. 59) Sakellarakis, IpaKTLKa 1975, pp. 312-317. Location and Excavation Building 17 is located a short distance north of Building 4. It was discovered in 1974 and excavated in 1975. Architecture The building, which might best be described as a depository, consists of an enclosure ca. 4.26 m. deep flanked by irregular walls along the east and west. Traces of pavement were 71 Sakellarakis, nIpaxruca 1973, pl. 175:B. 145</page><page sequence="166">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS found between these walls, and towards the south and east of the structure a pit measuring ca. 3.60 by 3.80 m. and as much as 1.55 m. deep was cut in the bedrock. How the building is to be reconstructed is unclear, but the excavator has suggested that its walls served merely as retaining walls; in this case, the structure may have been hypaethral. Use and Chronology The enclosure was used as a depository for objects that, in the excavator's view, had been gathered from the cleaning of other buildings on the site. Although fragments of three animal figurines were uncovered in the surface deposits, the finds consisted primarily of LM Ia pottery. Over 120 whole or nearly complete vases of this date were uncovered. They include 84 conical cups, a "milk jug", and other shapes, many finely decorated in LM Ia styles, and represent the best examples of pottery of this period in the Archanes cemetery. In addition, a group of Prepalatial pottery was found in the lowest deposits in the structure. It is thought to represent the remains of the cleaning of a Prepalatial building on the site. 13. ARCHANES 18 (Fig. 59) Sakellarakis, IlpaKTLKa 1976, pp. 344-351; Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1987, pp. 124-127; Hiller, Minoische Kre- ta, p. 109. Location and Excavation Tomb 18 is located in the southern half of the Archanes cemetery, midway between Tholoi r and E. It was excavated in 1976 and 1987. Architecture The tomb consists of a rectangular building of about 10 rooms.72 The seven northern rooms are entered from the east and interconnect through doorways; the rooms to the south could be entered only from the roof. Many of the northern rooms are paved with large slabs; an earlier tomb (Archanes 24) lay beneath their floors. Burials and Chronology The tomb was used as an ossuary and for primary burials at the end of the Prepalatial period and in the Old Palace period. The burials in the southern rooms are dated to the MM Ia phase. One of these rooms held 18 burials lying one above the other in four strata. Another room, in the southwest corner, contained remains, mostly skulls, belonging to 95 burials deposited in three strata; approximately 37 skulls were found in the uppermost stra- tum.73 Three sarcophagi were found in the middle stratum, one oriented north-south, lying to the east near the entrance, and the others lying to the west, oriented east-west. Some 17 skulls were found in and around the sarcophagus near the doorway. Five skulls were found in the second sarcophagus at the northwest corner, together with other skeletal remains indicating that primary burials had been made in it.74 In the third sarcophagus at the south- west corner were found three skulls and the remains of a contracted burial beneath them. An additional 22 skulls were found in the areas around these three sarcophagi. Nine more skulls were found in the lowest stratum beneath the sarcophagi, resting near bedrock. 72 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1987, pl. 150. 73 Sakellarakis, IlpaKrTKa 1976, pl. 214:a. 74 Sakellarakis, HpaKTLKa 1976, pl. 214:/3. 146</page><page sequence="167">THE ARCHANES CEMETERY The rooms to the north were used into the MM II phase, with most burials located in the two westernmost rooms. Forty-eight burials are reported, including 14 in sarcophagi,75 nine in pithoi,76 and 15 on the the floor. The northwest room held 16 burials in four strata: in the uppermost a small sarcophagus with two child burials, a pithos with a burial still in contracted position, and two burials on the floor; in the second stratum one sarcophagus placed alongside the south wall and one along the north, each with one burial, a pithos with two burials, and two burials on the floor. In the third stratum another sarcophagus and a burial on the floor were found; in the fourth, three sarcophagi, one pithos, and two burials on the floor are reported. In addition to MM II Kamares-style pottery, a large number of seals and stone vases, including one kernos,77 were found in the tomb. 14. ARCHANES 19 (Fig. 59) Sakellarakis, IpaKLrKa 1976, pp. 351-391; Sakellarakis, IpaKTLKa 1977, p. 481. Location and Excavation Tomb 19 is located just south of Tomb 18, a short distance northwest of Tholos E. It too was excavated in 1976. Architecture Tomb 19 is a small one-room building ca. 2.80 m. by 3.40 m. on the outside.78 It is unusual for several reasons. It was built with extremely wide walls on three sides; on the northwest, northeast, and southeast they range in width from 0.95 m. to 1.05 m. The num- ber of fallen blocks found around and inside the tomb suggest that they were built entirely in stone and, in the excavator's view, that the roof was also constructed in stone. To aid in the support of this superstructure, nearly the entire base of the southeast wall was reinforced with a huge monolith set on end on the outer side. The interior of the tomb, which is ap- proached from the west, is unusual for its apsidal plan with straight walls on three sides but a curved wall on the northeast. Burials and Chronology One hundred eighty burials were uncovered in two strata inside the tomb. In the upper stratum remains of 76 skulls, at least 12 of which belonged to children, were uncovered in five small sarcophagi, in vases, and on the ground. The remains of one infant burial were identified inside one of the sarcophagi (no. 5), and all the sarcophagi, which were found oriented east-west along the western side of the building,79 appear to have been designed for infant burials because of their small size. At least 19 skulls, again largely belonging to infants or young individuals, were found inside some 11 large vases or jars, often together with smaller vases, animal, chicken, and fish bones, sea shells, and other small grave goods. In the northeast corner, remains of three individuals were found in one vase, together with a 75 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1987, pi. 152. 76 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1987, pi. 153. 77 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1987, pl. 157. 78 Sakellarakis, IIpaKrLKa 1976, pl. 215:,8. 79 Sakellarakis, IlpaLKTrt 1976, pl. 215. 147</page><page sequence="168">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS female figurine of the Petsofa type. In at least five other vases the remains of animal and chicken bones were found. The remaining burials in this stratum lay on the ground. The best preserved of these belonged to an infant burial that lay in contracted position beneath a large stone in the northwest corner. Animal and fish bones were found with it. In the lower stratum were uncovered remains of 104 skulls, all at ground level, only two of which belonged to children. Many were found with the remains of other bones, which suggests that primary burials may have been made at this level, too. The skulls were grouped mostly around the sides of the room, often stacked in layers, one group above another. At one point in the southeast corner of the room five skulls appear to have been placed on top of a flat stone. Occasionally a conical cup would be placed by a skull. Other finds included a large number of sea shells, one zoomorphic and one anthropomorphic figurine, and two composite vessels.80 One hundred eighty-two vases were uncovered from these two strata, all of which belong to the MM Ia or MM Ib phase. In addition, in the area between and west of Tombs 18 and 19, a number of objects that may or may not be associated with the two tombs were also uncovered. Among the finds between the tombs were nine vases, including a fruitstand, two conical cups, and an EM II Agios Onouphrios jug, as well as parts of two anthropomorphic figurines, one of them of folded-arm type,81 and a large number of sea shells. Among the finds west of the tombs, where material from the cleaning of near-by tombs is thought to have been dumped, were parts of several more folded-arm figurines,82 hundreds of obsidian blades, complete and fragmentary, and pieces of human bone. Most of the pottery from this area dates to the MM Ia phase, although some from the EM II phase is also reported.

Location and Excavation A single built tomb, designated here as Tomb A, and a related structure, called by the excavator the ipoS AaLKKOS, or "sacred pit", were uncovered in 1915 by Joseph Hazzidakis on the northern slope of a hill that lies 150 to 200 meters east of the village of Gournes in an area that enjoys a splendid view towards the sea to the north and the island of Dia. Neither structure is visible today. The tomb is destroyed, but its location, immediately below two chamber tombs, just west of an abandoned threshing floor, is still recognizable and is marked with a heap of stones. Some ten meters to the north (not south as reported) in the lower adjoining field are traces of the sacred pit; it stands just east of a second threshing floor.

GOURNES, TOMB A (Fig. 62) Architecture At the time of its excavation, the tomb was already destroyed at the east, where a thresh- ing floor had been built. The western part of the tomb, which survived, consisted of three parallel rooms of unequal width, the southernmost set back from the others. For the most part only the lower course of the stone foundation remained. It is reported to have been constructed of fq^poXALLas or "dry-stone" masonry, by which is probably meant that only a minimum of earth mortar was employed.84 The excavator's plan suggests that a standard rubble construction was used with outer and inner faces of stones set side by side of r simply one large stone filling the entire width of the wall. The southwest corner of the central room appears to have been reinforced by one such stone. In size, details of construction, and general layout the surviving section of the tomb recalls Archanes anTomb 6, which it also overlaps in date, and the tomb should probably be reconstructed accordingly. The preserved western portion would then be one of the short ends of a rectangular structure. The western wall is about the same length as the original rear wall of the Archanes tomb, just over six meters in each case, and at the point where the third side chamber is located, the walls of both tombs are set back ca. 0.50 m. At Archanes the rear wall of this chamber does not bond with the rest of the rear wall, and the same ap- pears to have been true at Gournes. In both cases, then, the third side chamber appears to be an addition to an original complex of two rooms. No trace of a doorway is preserved, but one may have been located in the destroyed eastern end of the tomb, as at Archanes, or the rooms may have been entered from the roof. The rooms were probably long and narrow like those at Archanes. They vary in width, with the northern room ca. 2.50 m. wide, the central room ca. 1 m. wide, and the southern room ca. 0.55 m. wide, and extend a maximum preserved length of ca. 2.35 m. Burials and Chronology Remains of approximately 20 burials are reported from the north room of the tomb, of approximately ten from the central room, and of only one from the southern room. All were scattered, so that the original position of each burial was unclear. A small cup is reported to have been placed by each skull. Zois has recently studied and republished the pottery preserved from Hazzidakis' exca- vation. It is predominantly MM Ia, with the exception of only a few later examples, and shows several parallels with vases from Knossos and from eastern Crete.85 The tomb and its sacred pit may be dated to the MM Ia phase, but they also appear to have been used to a lesser degree in the Old Palace Period. 83 For a general view of the area from the north, see Hazzidakis, AeAr 4, 1918, p. 63, fig. 7. 84 For this type of construction see p. 207 below. 85 Walberg, in a recent critique of Zois' work, while agreeing that the majority of vases are MM Ia, empha- sizes the presence of MM Ib/II vases as well; thus Gournes should probably not be considered a closed MM Ia deposit (Middle Minoan Pottery, pp. 107-109). 149</page><page sequence="170">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS 4 IEPOI AAKKOS Tomb A 0 1 2 3 4 5m. i.

GOURNES, IEPOE AAKKOI (Fig. 62) Architecture As the name suggests, the i'po AaClKKOS is essentially a pit. It was dug into the bedrock of the hillside at the point where a low rise of ca. 0.50 m. divides an upper field from a lower. The pit is ca. 0.20 m. deep on the north side but deeper on the south where it backs against the hillside. The north, east, and west sides of the pit are faced with walls of small stones that are also carried around the edge on these three sides, presumably in order to support a superstructure. The south side, however, does not appear to have had a built foundation but used the natural face of the pit and the rise in the hillside. The room so enclosed measures ca. 2 by 3.50 m. In construction, particularly in the built foundations, the pit recalls Gour- nia Tomb I, which is also deeper on one side, but which is lined with walls on all four sides. Both structures were apparently roofed, but the Lepos XAaKKOS may not have been enclosed on its south side where it faced Tomb A. Chronology The [pos XAaKKOS contained no burials but only pottery deposits, and these contain material of the same style and date as those from the tomb. A large percentage of the pottery from Gournes consists of miniature vases, and the few examples of ordinary size are thought to be mostly imports from Knossos. Often decorated with unique or archaizing patterns, the local pottery is individual in nature, and Zois has suggested that the miniature vases were specially manufactured for use as votives, KTepLr.AaTrLK7^-aLefpIwMaTLrK^s. The Efpo AaJKKOS, which contained "many hundreds" of these miniature vases, seems to have been designed to receive them, and the excavator has suggested that such small built structures are often located beside principal tombs. "They are used as a type of shrine for the deposition of offerings dedicated to the dead; they are analogous to the shrines beside the Protodynastic tombs of Egypt that developed afterwards into great temples."86 KNOSSOS 17.

It was excavated by Arthur Evans in 1931, and a large part of it was restored in reinforced concrete. Architecture The tomb is a long rectangular building that cuts into the slope of the hill and shares its east-west orientation.

In this respect it resembles other buildings in the immediate area, including the High Priest's House, and although it has sometimes been compared to Egyptian tombs many times its size, or described as a built chamber tomb,87 its architectural details and over-all plan have good parallels in other domestic buildings at Knossos. The tomb stands at the end of a long tradition of tombs built in imitation of houses. At the same time it is something of a hybrid: it includes a rock-cut chamber at one end that served, in the contemporary fashion, as a chamber tomb. The exposed, built structure has an east-west measurement of ca. 22.40 m. and is one of four monumental house tombs. The tomb has two entrances from the north, one giving access to the ground level and the other to the upper story. The ground-level entrance leads through a walled corridor to a portico at the east end of the tomb and to an enclosed paved court; in plan it recalls the walled entrance corridor that leads to an enclosed court in the High Priest's House.88 The corridor axis, which bends at right angles in the portico and then continues on an east-west line, dominates the ground-floor plan: the portico opens upon the court, the court upon an alcove flanked by twin bastions, the alcove upon the main doorway to the tomb, the doorway upon an inner hall, and the hanl upon a pillar crypt. Only the the rock-cut burial chamber lies off this axis. Such axial arrangements are not uncommon in Neopalatial domestic architec- ture, especially in the Minoan Hall complex, and one need not turn to Egypt for parallels. The second story, which may be reached by a flight of stairs from the inner hall or from the outer north entrance, consists of an upper columnar room over the pillar crypt and two roof terraces, one on the west above te inner hall and bastions, and one on the east above the portico, both overlooking the paved court below. Needless to say, upper columnar rooms and roof terraces are also common features in contemporary domestic architecture. One of the most intriguing features of the architecture is the locking system of its ground-floor rooms. Each of the four doorways on this level is provided with monolithic gypsum jambs and, with the exception of the one leading into the inner sepulchral chamber, each is carefully provided with a double locking system. The main outer door, leading from the paved court to the inner hall, could be bolted shut from both inside and outside. The inner side may be shut by two large crossbeams set in rectangular sockets in vertical piers on either side of the door, one resting on the other, presumably in a metal bracket on the back of the door. From the outside this door could be closed by sliding a bolt that fastened to the outer face of the door and slid into a slot in the north jamb; it could easily have been moved back and forth on the outside, preventing someone only from opening the door from the inside, and a small square cutting adjacent to the bolt slot on the north jamb was probably used for a sealing which, attached by string to the bolt, would have been broken if the door were tampered with. The door leading into the pillar crypt from the inner hall could also be locked from inside and outside by a similar system;89 here, however, a bolt with bronze locking pin was substituted for the inner crossbeams on the inside of the door.90 The door 87 A.

Knossos, the Temple Tomb: jambs of the south doorway in the inner hall leading from the inner hall to the inner staircase (Fig. 64) could also be locked by means of the usual bolt-and-slot system, at least on the inside, but a different system was used on the outside, where circular cuttings at the tops of both jambs are located for a cross bar and another circular cutting at the base of the west jamb for a transverse bar. This door, then, could be used for leaving the tomb after bolting the outer front door from within. Ritual requirements seem to have determined many of the architectural features, includ- ing the corridor axis, the court and roof terraces with horns of consecration, the double axes incised on the faCade, and the pillar crypts; the double-locking systems of its doors, which are repeated three times, were probably also designed to meet some ritual need. Burials and Chronology Burials were discovered in the pillar crypt and the sepulchral chamber. In the pillar crypt the spaces between the two pillars and between the west pillar and the south and west walls were subdivided by rough partition walls,91 and the two areas were used for burials; two strata were apparently uncovered in each. In the lower strata only bones were discov- ered; in the upper strata, Pendlebury reported LM Ia pottery and some LM II material in the southeast part of the room. The skeletal material is reported to have been largely destroyed but to have belonged to "at least a score of individuals." In one or two cases parts of the same skeleton had been placed on the same slabs. In the northwestern part of the room, outside the entrance to the sepulchral chamber, a skull and a small heap of bones were found that were thought to belong to a child and an elderly man. A small quantity of bones was also found in the northeast corner of the chamber. Both these deposits were 91 Evans, PM IV, p. 991, fig. 943. 154</page><page sequence="175">THE KOUMASA CEMETERY associated with the pottery found in a pit dug in the floor at the entrance to the chamber and were believed to represent the last burials in the tomb. The pottery from the pit was dated LM II by Evans and has been redated LM IIIa by Popham. At least two separate periods of use may be distinguished, one belonging to the earlier part of the Neopalatial period and the other to the Mycenaean. MM III pottery was found in the sepulchral chamber, and the construction of the tomb probably dates to this time. No skeletal material was found with this pottery, and Popham has suggested that the building was originally a shrine, later converted to a tomb. Evans suggested, however, that the MM III pottery was originally associated with burials that were later removed. In the LM Ia phase the tomb suffered considerable damage, probably caused by an earthquake. Evans noted that the evidence of this destruction was to be seen in the re-used north jamb of the main outer door of the tomb and the re-used schist plaques and the laashlar masonry in the partitions thrown up in the pillar crypt. He interpreted the skeletal material in the pillar crypt as the remains of devotees present in the tomb at the actual moment of the LM Ia catastrophe. It would be consistent with Minoan burial practice, however, if these were in- stead remains of previous interments in the tomb, heaped here during a cleaning made in preparation for further use sometime after its partial destruction. In this case, some of the skeletal material may have belonged to the MM III phase as well as the LM Ia phase. It is unclear whether there is a break in use after the LM Ia destruction. The tomb continued, however, to be used in the LM II phase. Evans believed that the last burials belonged to this phase and that LM IIIa deposits, found by the entrance platform leading to the building and the entrance to the sepulchral chamber, were the remains of offerings of a memorial cult made after these burials. Since the skeletal material by the entrance to the sepulchral chamber is now associated with this same LM IIIa phase, the other LM IIIa pottery deposits may be interpreted simply as the usual offerings placed with the dead. THE KOUMASA CEMETERY The Koumasa cemetery, one of several excavated in the Mesara by Stephanos Xanthou- dides, is situated on a low rise in the foothills of the Asterousia mountains just southwest of the modern village of Koumasa (Fig. 65). Below it, to the north, the Mesara Plain stretches out towards the east and west. Overlooking it to the south rises what Xanthoudides de- scribed as the "two-peaked hill" of Korakies where the remains of MM and LM III houses were found and where an earlier town contemporary with the cemetery may also have been located. The cemetery was used first in the EM II phase when two tholos tombs, A and B, and a rectangular built tomb, F, were constructed. Only Tholos B seems to have continued in use in the EM III and MM Ia phases, and a new tholos, E, was constructed at the end of the Prepalatial period. A number of smaller and contemporary rectangular buildings appear to have stood outside the main tombs in Areas Z, AB, and A. While the four large tombs were partly intact at the time of excavation, the smaller buildings were destroyed, and only a large number of collapsed stones remained to indicate their original presence. Xanthoudides suggested that these buildings were "lightly built" structures resting entirely above ground, "some to be used as tombs, others as store-rooms for the gifts made by the living to the 155</page><page sequence="176">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS AB A 0 Sm FIG. 65. The Koumasa cemetery (Xanthoudides, VTM, pi. LXI) dead.""92 In Area Z Xanthoudides noted layers of ash and charred wood that may have belonged to the roofs of these small buildings. Just southeast of Area Z and east of Tholos E, he uncovered remains of a paved court, ca. 6.50 m. wide at the south, that was bordered by a wall on the west. 18.

As a result of its position at a point where ground falls away to the north, a large part of the tomb on this side has been destroyed: the entire northwest wall, as well as adjoining parts of the northeast and southwest walls, is missing. The tomb appears originally to have formed a simple square, oriented northeast- southwest, with an outside measurement of ca. 5.10 m. on the southeast. The floor level of the tomb is lower than that of the neighboring Tholoi A and E; apparently a large pit was dug out of the north slope, similar to that at Gournia (p. 4 above) but shallower and some- what larger, in order to construct the tomb. The southeast and the adjoining parts of the northeast and southwest walls were built against the sides of the pit, and the preserved upper surfaces of these walls today are flush with the ground level outside the tomb. Unlike the walls of Gournia Tomb I, however, the walls of this tomb are built in usual rubble fashion with inner and outer facings of stone. The construction is not nearly so regular as that indi- cated on the plan (Fig. 65), and the drawing of the stones there is schematic. The southwest wall of the tomb, the highest preserved, curves inwards towards the northwest end. Apparently, as is the case along the southern side of the pit of Gournia Tomb I the side of the pit at this point was not cut t in a straight line, and the section of wall built against the side curves in with it. Only the southeast wall is preserved for its whole length. Its courses bond with those of the adjoining walls at right angles. The northeast wall is the most poorly preserved of the three remaining walls and less well preserved than indicated on the plan. Most of the northwestern section is destroyed where the wall would originally have been freestanding.93 The entrance to the tomb is not apparent; it may have come at some point in the missing sections of wall, or above the preserved remains of the walls, or from the roof. The interior of the tomb, which measures ca. 4.10 m. northeast-southwe and wa. 4.20 me. southeast- northwest, seems to have consisted of one large space, since no trace of an internal dividing wall was found. Xanthoudides suggested that the tomb may have resembled the Mochlos tombs and "it is possible that it had a wooden roof of beams with reeds or branches laid across them, but no therace of anything of the kind was brought to light. ..." He suggested that the tomb may therefore have been an open burial enclosure "like those at Palaikastro and Gournes."94 Burials and Chronology The burials in the tomb, like those in the neighboring tholoi, were disturbed and mixed with other finds. None of the skeletal material was well preserved. Four vases are pub- lished, including spherical pyxides of gray burnished ware, one a kernos with three pyxides on pedestal foot (Her.Mus. 4194 and 4187) which should be dated to the EM IIa phase, and a one-handled cup and a bowl (Her.Mus. 4248 and 4283), both painted in the Kou- masa style of the EM IIa phase.95 Other finds included stone vases that may be dated to the 93 Northeast wall: p.L. ca. 2.84 m.; W. 0.60-0.64 m.; H. ca. 0.46 m. Southeast wall: L. ca. 4.50 m.; W. 0.58-0.66 m.; H. ca. 0.45 m. Southwest wall: p.L. ca. 5.10 m.; W. ca. 0.65 m.; H. ca. 0.98 m. Xanthou- dides reported 1.35 m. as the maximum height of the walls, in which case they rose above the surrounding outside ground level. 94 Xanthoudides, VTM, p. 32. 95 For these vases see Zois, Kamares-Stil, pp. 77-78, 80; Zois, "Epevva, pp. 719-720. 157</page><page sequence="178">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS same phase.96 Vasilike ware, which is found elsewhere in the Mesara region, is not reported in the Koumasa cemetery, and the initial building and use of Tomb F as well as the tholoi falls in the EM IIa phase alone. After this it seems likely that the cemetery was abandoned for a period. Tomb r was not re-used and, like Tholos A, represents a closed EM IIa deposit. In the areas AB, A, and Z, where the small rectangular buildings were located, EM IIa material was found together with EM III/MM I material, including many objects of ritual use. The same areas were used for burials, but it is unclear to which phases these burials belonged. Apparently the deposits were mixed and too badly disturbed to report precise associations. Zois has suggested that these areas were used for burials only in the EM IIa phase. The burials here, however, may just as well have belonged to the later phases, espe- cially since Tomb r and the tholoi were being used for burial in the EM II phase, or the burials may have belonged to all phases. The presence of MM vases outside the tombs was regarded as evidence of a memorial cult by Xanthoudides, who noted that ". . . even if the Middle Minoan descendants of the builders of the tombs did not continue to use them, at least they went on for a long time paying honour to their dead forbears, and perhaps buried their own dead outside.""97 Such an inference is possible, however, only if the burials outside the main tombs were confined to the EM IIa phase.

Location and Excavation Linares, the location of a small church of St. John, lies in the mountains to the north of Chamaizi. A short distance below the church, to the south, a built rectangular tomb was uncovered by Costis Davaras in 1971.98 The L-shaped structure built around irregular outcroppings of bedrock at its northeast corner is located in a level area on the hillside between these outcroppings and a larger one rising on the south. To the east and south the hill slopes away to a narrow rivulet that leads to the sea. No settlement has been located in the neighborhood, but just south of the excavated tomb are traces of an unexcavated building, a house or another house tomb somewhat more substantially constructed. The whole area commands a spectacular view of the sea, and in the distance Cape Phaneromenis is visible, with its sheer rock sides and level summit. Architecture The tomb is built with rubble walls, the outer using large stones for the faces with smaller stones set between and against them on the inside. It is a distinctive type of rubble construction that foreshadows the later form of Minoan ashlar masonry.99 It is best seen in the west and south walls of the tomb, which are the best preserved. The west wall has seven 96 Warren, MSV, p. 83. 97 Xanthoudides, VTM, p. 42. 98 I am indebted to the excavator for permission to study this tomb and publish a plan of it here. 99 For this type of construction see p. 208 below. 158</page><page sequence="179">LINARES 0 1 2m.

The latter, which does not run in a straight line, is not so well preserved as those on the west and south, and it is unclear if it was constructed in a similar fashion. 00 The entrance to the tomb is not evident. The excavator has suggested an entry from above, presumably from the roof, but it may also have come at the southeast corner, where the south wall contracts and a large flat stone was set inside the tomb; it could have served as a step down from a doorway located in the wall at the level of the stone foundation. Such an entry would give access to the east room of the tomb, a small irregular room with a 100 West wall: L. ca. 4.87 m.; W. 0.50-0.72 m.; H. ca. 0.87 m.

Unlike the other walls of the tomb, it is constructed of relatively large stones on the inside and terminates at the west in a large upright block. This block, over one meter high, serves as a pier or jamb flanking the north side of a doorway leading to the inner, southwest room of the tomb. A short spur wall, running north-south at right angles to the south wall across from this pier, borders the room on the west. The inner doorway, ca. 0.60 m. wide, gives access to a rectangular room measuring ca. 2.50 m. east-west and ca. 2.07 m. north-south, the floor of which is broken along the south side by a bedrock outcropping.102 The north wall lies somewhat north of the east room and does not bond with the walls at its east and west. Much narrower than the other walls and constructed with inner and outer faces of small stones, it is clearly an inner partition wall, and a third, unexcavated room must lie behind it to the north. Indeed, the outer west wall of the tomb extends north well beyond this inner partition wall, and traces of another unexca- vated wall may be seen behind the north pier of the inner door, also running north. Origi- nally, then, the tomb consisted of at least three rooms. Were it not for the outcroppings at its northeast corner, it might have been roughly square. Burials and Chronology The tomb is reported to have contained the scattereporte to ae conid skeletal remains of "many tens" of burials, apparently none found in their original position. The pottery from the tomb is as yet unpublished, but it is reported to be "Early Minoan". A cylinder seal that has been published'03 and a stone "egg-cup" reported among the finds are apparently EM II in date. MALLIA: CHRYSOLAKKOS AND THE NECROPOLE DES PIERRES MEULIERES The major cemetery at Mallia is located north of the palace, on the promontory dominated by the Chrysolakkos complex and extending about 100 meters along the coast from La Plage de l'Escalier on the east to the area of Les Pierres Meulieres on the west (Fig. 67). It is here that the earliest burials at Mallia were made at the beginning of the EM II phase, as well as some of the latest, during the Mycenaean occupation of the site. While other areas, such as L'Ilot du Christ, were also used for burials from time to time, this promontory appears to have been used as a cemetery for the duration of the Bronze Age occupation at Mallia.104 The promontory was most popular as a burial place, however, during the Prepalatial and Old Palace periods, when different types of graves were used, apparently, as the French 101 Davaras, ACAr 27, 1972, pl. 606:a. 102 Davaras, ACAr 27, 1972, pl. 605. 103 Davaras, 'ApX'E4. 1973, pp. 81-82. 104 For a plan of the area see Effenterre, Mallia, Necropoles II, plan II; for a general summary of the Mallia cemeteries see Effenterre, Palais de Mallia, pp. 214-247 and Baurain, Aegaeum 1, 1987, pp. 61-72. 160</page><page sequence="181">r -r i -f .-r , 0--4";,h i s /Ss} ' / F N e I ^ ^ \ 1.,,x,,,,,,,,, .. . . .. ...... &lt;ife g o5--/ . t.

Some appear to have continued in use into the LM I phase and thus to have spanned the entire period of Minoan occupation. It has also been suggested that they were used only by the poorest inhabitants of the site.106 At approximately the same time that these crevices came into use, a small rectangular tomb, the Western Ossuary, was built on the coast overlooking the small bay at the west of the Chrysolakkos promontory. It is unclear if this tomb was used in the following EM III phase, when the first of a series of tombs was built at Chrysolakkos. In the MM Ia phase, when numerous pithos cemeteries were opened along the coast and pithos burial became the most common form of burial at Mallia, at least three additional tombs were constructed in the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres (the Eastern Ossuaries and the House of the Dead). Finally, at the beginning of the Old Palace period, the second, monumental tomb at Chryso- lakkos was built. This tomb has often been described as a "royal" tomb, while the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres has been described as the burial place of the common people.107 Since all the tombs in the necropolis, however, antedate the monumental tomb at Chrysolakkos and few appear to have been used extensively after its construction, it may be that the built tombs in the necropolis were used in the Prepalatial period by the same element of the population that used Chrysolakkos in the Old Palace period. In addition to the tombs on the promontory, remains of a long wall of uncertain func- tion survive in its southwestern part. Although it is now interrupted by a series of gaps, originally this wall was probably continuous and stretched for more than 100 meters in a straight line, broken only by a series of setbacks, from the vicinity of Chrysolakkos on the east along the north side of the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres to the sea on the west. At the coast it makes a sharp turn south and runs some 18 meters along the coast before ending. It is solidly constructed with boulders of local limestone conglomerate laid in irregular courses with loose earth and stones in the interstices. The section along the coast is the best preserved and stands with a single face of boulders, four courses high, against the rising 105 Demargne and H. and M. van Effenterre have been the chief proponents of the view that differences in burial types at Mallia reflect differences in social ranking within the community (Demargne, Mallia, Necro- poles I, pp. 1-69 and Effenterre, Mallia, Necropoles II, pp. 85-102; Effenterre, Palais de Mallia, pp. 214- 247); recently Baurain and Pierpont have taken a more cautious approach and stressed instead the limitations of the evidence (Baurain, Aegaeum 1, 1987, pp. 61-72; Pierpont, Aegaeum 1, 1987, pp. 79-93). 106 Demargne (Mallia, Necropoles I, p. 2) refers to them as the "cimetiere de pauvres", and Effenterre (Pa- lais de Mallia, pp. 233-234) calls them the "mode le plus primitif d'enterrement". 107 Among those identifying Chyrsolakkos as a royal tomb are Demargne (Mallia, Necropoles I, p. 56), who believed the famous bee pendant to be a symbol of royal authority; Effenterre (Palais de Mallia, pp. 246-247), who prefers the terms "noble", "seigneurial", or "princier"; Hood (The Minoans, pp. 145-146), who suggests that it was "the burial place for the royal family of Mallia"; F. Matz (The Art of Crete and Early Greece, New York 1962, p. 115), who describes it as a "sepulchral palace" for the "court nobility"; P. Warren (Aegean Civi- lizations, London 1975, p. 70), who calls it a "royal burial place"; and Davaras (Cretan Antiquities, p. 35), Hutchinson (Prehistoric Crete, p. 188), Picard (Religions prehelleniques, pp. 162-166), R. Higgins (The Archaeology of Minoan Crete, New York 1973, p. 69), and F. Schachermeyr (Die minoische Kultur des alten Kreta, 2nd ed., Stuttgart 1979, p. 71).

Its date is also unclear, although several MM Ia structures are built against the wall and pro- vide a terminus ante quem for its construction. A stone kernos, similar to that at Gournia Tomb II (p. 20 above), lies by the north face of this wall near the west end.109 The stone is not in situ but had apparently fallen from the cemetery area behind the wall and is clearly associated with the necropolis, perhaps with the House of the Dead, which lies some ten meters to the east. Partially broken, it consists of an oblong slab of sideropetra, smooth on top with a rectangular pattern of hollows curved at the edges (P1. 39:b). Eighteen of about 30 original hollows are preserved, each quite shallow, probably formed by a hammerstone; one in the corner is somewhat larger than the rest.110 20.

Location and Excavation Chrysolakkos is located about 500 meters north of the palace at Mallia, in the middle of the promontory that served as its main cemetery during the Prepalatial and Old Palace periods. The site was excavated in 1921 by Louis Renaudin and again from 1930 to 1933 by Pierre Demargne. Two structures were uncovered, and evidence for as many as three build- ing stages was revealed. The first building on the site, which is designated here as Chryso- lakkos I, lies beneath and is partly incorporated into the monumental rectangular building, here called Chrysolakkos II. The clearest remains of the first building were uncovered be- neath the east and west terraces of the later structure; only those on the west are still visible. Architecture The over-all plan of Chrysolakkos I is lost because Chrysolakkos II was built in its midst. It included an open court on the west, however, and a number of rectangular rooms on the east; both areas were designed to accommodate visitors. The court was uncovered beneath the western terrace of the later tomb.111 It too is paved with irregular limestone slabs, but they are set on the natural slope of the terrain and not on an artificial horizontal level of sand, as is the later terrace. The extent of this court to the east and south is un- known. It extended at least as far as the west wall of the later tomb and perhaps originally stretched farther east. It extends north somewhat beyond the north wall of the later tomb. It is bounded on the west by an irregular wall interrupted by gaps at three points and broken by angular jogs and setbacks at others. Visible today, the different parts of the wall are con- structed in varying fashions and oriented slightly differently. The wall runs along the west- ern side of the court and clearly served not to support a roof but simply to border the court. 108 Wall at coast: W. 0.75-1.20 m.; H. ca. 1.90 m. 109 Just east of the point marked 4 on plan III, Effenterre, Mallia, Necropoles II. 110 Kernos ring: ca. 0.24 by 0.40 m. 111 Demargne, Mallia, Necropoles I, pl.

Further remains of the same complex were uncovered beneath the east terrace of the later tomb. They are located at approximately the same level as those beneath the later west terrace;114 the walls, like those of the early western court, are oriented more truly north- sout t han are those of the later tomb. The remains consist of a long narrow corridor (a) giving access through a sectional wall to the west to the later burial compartments and through two separate doorways to the east to two sets of rooms (h and g to the north; j, k, and e to the south). All these rooms are provided with low plastered benches along the walls115 and with plastered or paved floors, and they appear to have accommodated frequent gather- ings of people. Fixed furniture includes a terracotta disk imbedded in the floor of Room h, which has been identified as a hearth,116 a plaster bin located between Rooms h and g, and an important structure located just outside the southwest corner of Room a, identified as Structure b.117 Although the excavators made little of it, calling it simply "un curieux massif", it provides the key to interpreting these rooms and deserves a closer examination. The structure consists of a mass of earth and small stones ca. 1.10 m. square and ca. 0.43 m. high, covered top and sides with hard stucco and crowned with a raised stucco border ca. 0.05 m. high. It backs against the western wall of Room a and opens onto the large room (or court) that flanks Room a on the west.118 Its exposed face on this side appears to have been partly lined with sandstone blocks, still visible today. A stone kernos lies in situ immediately against the structure on the south, fixed in the pavement of Room d. It is an irregular stone, ca. 0.62 by 0.45 by 0.42 m., marked with a central depression and a ring of 31 hollows.119 The kernos identifies Structure b as an altar belonging to the same class of raised altar with juxtaposed offering receptacle as that at Gournia Tomb II (pp. 19-20 above). It is paral- leled in the later Chrysolakkos tomb by the hollow stucco altar with kernos juxtaposed in the plaster floor. Indeed, the later altar complex, located near this earlier altar and oriented in the same direction, with kernos and paving slabs to the south, may have been intended to reproduce the earlier altar complex when it went out of use and the new tomb was erected. Throughout their investigation of the interior of the later rectangular tomb the exca- vators found traces of two building levels, the earlier of which belongs to the same complex as the remains found beneath the east and west terraces of the later tomb. These remains are not sufficient, however, to reconstruct the plan of this part of the earlier complex or even to 113 The parts of the wall built in sandstone measure ca. 0.29-0.32 m. in width, those in rubble ca. 0.50- 0.59 m.; the capping stones are ca. 0.25 m. wide. It is most unlikely that these stones could have belonged, as Shaw suggested ("The Chrysolakkos Facades," p. 329), to the monumental tomb at Chrysolakkos with its massive exterior walls; their findspot and relatively narrow width indicate otherwise. 114 Demargne, Mallia, Necropoles I, pl.

The earlier remains include the small walls in Room c of the later tomb, found ca. 0.50 m. below the base of the large wall AB, and certain sections of smaller walls underneath the later wall CD (Fig. 69). The only room of the earlier complex that may be identified with some certainty appears as Room g in the later structure. Its north wall is still partly exposed just below and south of wall CD, which borders it, and its south wall may be identified as the small wall lying just south of wall EF.120 All these walls have a width of 0.60-0.65 m., similar to that of the earlier walls under the east and west terraces and contrasting with the greater width of the later walls. The floor of Room g is stuccoed like those of the earlier rooms to the east; wall EF was later built on top of this floor, cutting through the middle of the room. Burials and Chronology No burials are reported from the areas beneath the east and west terraces of the later tomb, and these areas were clearly not intended to be so used. It has been suggested recently that the early remains at Chrysolakkos belong to a house or complex of houses and should not be associated with a tomb at all.121 The fixed features and the finds of the eastern rooms, however, indicate that the remains belong to no ordinary house. The numerous benches, Structure b with its fixed kernos, and the small conical offering vessels found both in the eastern rooms and on the west terrace suggest that these rooms were used as a shrine, and the presence of benches, a very similar altar complex, and identical offering vessels in Chry- solakkos II122 suggests that the early shrine served the same funerary cult that was served in the later tomb. The identification of Chrysolakkos I as a tomb rests on the presumption that the intervening area beneath the later tomb was used for burials as it was in the later tomb. Skeletal remains, though not abundant, were not confined to any one stratum in the interior of the later tomb, and some may have belonged to the earlier building. The pottery from Chrysolakkos includes specimens ranging in date from the EM III to the MM III phase. All deposits were mixed, and the dating of the different building phases depends largely on the date assigned to the monumental tomb, Chrysolakkos II: on the basis of its architectural refinements and the pottery deposits of the north trenches, it may be dated to the Protopalatial period. The earlier structure, Chrysolakkos I, then belongs to the EM III/MM Ia phases.123 21.

The tomb is surrounded on all sides by a paved terrace and was fronted on the east by a colonnade of which seven rectangular bases of green schist are still preserved.124 The origi- nal faCade of the tomb is partly preserved on the south and east, where several large ortho- state blocks still stand, set back ca. 0.35 m. on a plinth 0.20-0.40 m. high. The orthostates are badly preserved limestone blocks that were originally cut flat in front and dressed on top and sides,125 while bases and inner sides are irregularly shaped. Only two of the blocks that stand in situ have intact upper surfaces; they measure ca. 0.87 m. and ca. 0.91 m. in height. The projecting plinth is constructed of medium-sized stones set in earth mortar and of large, roughly shaped blocks. Some of the orthostates rest directly on the plinth, and others are raised slightly above it on a fill of stones and earth, presumably in order to create an even horizontal bedding along all the upper surfaces. The irregular construction at the base of the orthostates would have been partly concealed by a series of thin slabs placed upright against the plinth face, forming a kind of dado between it and the terrace pavement.126 The two orthostates with partly intact upper surfaces, the fourth and seventh from the north in the east faCade,127 both preserve circular dowel holes at their outer edges. The outer edges of the other orthostates are largely destroyed but would also have had such dowel holes, and those re-used in the north and west facades in a third building phase demonstrate that all the orthostates in the original faCade were provided with such dowel holes along the edges of their upper surfaces. They were designed for the erection of vertical or horizontal timbers in a mud-brick or rubble superstructure, and the total height of the wall, including plinth, orthostates, and superstructures, is estimated at 2.5 to 3.5 meters.128 It is clear that at least one large doorway was located in the facade, for Shaw has identified two bases for jambs among the re-used limestone blocks in the north and west faCades.129 Like the re-used ortho- states, they apparently came from the original faCades of the tomb; they would have been set on either side of a stone threshold, and their dowel holes would have held the pins that fixed the wooden jambs of a doorway. Although the tomb is largely destroyed at the south, its internal arrangement is Iluch clearer than that of its predecessor. It consists of several wide walls running parallel to the outer faces of the tomb, north-south and east-west, intersecting at right angles to form a number of isolated, cell-like divisions. These divisions are usually rectangular (Rooms a and f), but at least one (b) is divided into two parts by a spur wall. The rooms range in size from ca. 2 m. square (in the northeast corner) to ca. 4 m. square (f). They often have plas- tered floors and walls, and as fragments of both red and white plaster were collected, they were apparently decorated with zones of different colors. Two rooms have been identified as shrines. Sunk into the floor of Room f, a nearly square room near the center of the tomb but isolated from the surrounding chambers, is a 124 Demargne, Mallia, Necropoles I, pl.

It is constructed differently, however, simply a stucco covering over hard earth, and since it is centrally locat- ed in Room f between the walls CD on the north and EF on the south it is probably part of the later tomb. A bench is set against wall EF in the southeast corner of the room.13' De- margne suggested that a lamp burned some "aromatic substance" in this room, perhaps in honor of the dead, and that the bench was designed to receive offerings or to seat pilgrims who came to pay their respects to the dead. If such were the case, access may have been provided by the long corridor immediately to the west between walls EF and CD. This corridor is also provided with a long bench along the whole of its south side and leads directly to the west facade of the tomb. Another shrine was identified in a rectangular room measuring ca. 2.20 by 6.70 m., located midway along the eastern side of the tomb. A circular structure was discovered against its eastern wall.'32 It consists of a stucco cylinder with serrated edges, resting di- rectly on the stucco floor, without a base; since it contained a loose fill of earth and pebbles, it was thought to have been hollow originally.'33 The excavators compared it to a libation table from Palaikastro with similar serrated edges and a circular depression in the center.134 Both are thought to have been used for libations, and the Palaikastro table, which dates to the Neopalatial period, may have been inspired by the Chrysolakkos altar. Remains of three or four small circular hollows were discovered in the stucco floor immediately south of the altar.'135 A large part of the stucco floor at this point is destroyed, but the curved arrange- ment of those extant suggests that originally a circle of hollows formed a kernos in the floor at the base of the altar. The area is thus identified by the excavators as a place where liba- tions and offerings of first fruits might be made. Demargne identified the cult centered here as the same as that located in the palaces and speculated that the Minoan Goddess "ex- tended her empire over the dead" as well as the living.136 Three superimposed layers of stucco flooring preserved south of the altar suggest that the room remained open for re- peated use. There is no clear entry into this room, but as it seems unlikely that pilgrims would have climbed into it by means of a ladder, passage may have been provided through the south wall from the small alcove immediately to the south and from there through an opening in the outer wall of the tomb from the east terrace. The east portico itself suggests a major entry into the tomb somewhere along this side, and further evidence of a door in the east facade is provided by the bronze pivot cap found somewhere against the exterior face of the east wall.137 130 Demargne, Mallia, Necropoles I, pl.

The majority, cut off from the outside by the faades and isolated from one another by thick walls, and which appear to have been the burial chambers themselves, were accessible only from the roof. While both Shaw and Effenterre have maintained that the tomb was hypaethral, the eastern colonnade, the doors (including one with a locking pin), the interior room divisions, and theer d painted stucco decoration all indicate that it was roofed. Wood was presumably used in combination with large stone slabs like that found in Room d138 or those in situ over the tholos side chamber and dromos of Archanes Tomb B. These heavy and cumbersome slabs could be moved aside when new burials were deposited. Although no staircase leading to the roof was reported, what may have been the remains of a well for a U-shaped staircase of wood are visible on the plan outside the northwest corner of the tomb. They consist of two narrow, parallel compart- ments, each 1 to 2 m. wide and ca. 5 m. long, of the shape and dimensions required for such a staircase. Burials and Chronology A "certain quantity" of bones is reported to have been found mixed with the debris of the tomb. Only at one point (Fig. 69: X) did they seem to be in situ. Here the bones of a leg were found together with two skulls on a layer of greenish clay. They originally belonged to a contracted burial that rested on its left side; a conical cup lay with the bones.139 Details concerning the other remains are not given, but apparently the quantity of skeletal material was not great, since the tomb was initially identified as a shrine.140 There is good ceramic and architectural evidence for dating Chrysolakkos II to the Protopalatial period. The ceramic evidence comes from the two trenches excavated outside the north faCade.141 They extend ca. 14.50 m. north, flush with the foundations of the fa- Cade; as they do not underlie it,142 it may be concluded that they were dug sometime after the construction of the wall, apparently when the tomb was cleaned in contemplation of further use. While there is some MM Ia material in the trenches, Zois has demonstrated that the majority of the pottery belongs to the MM Ib/II phases, and it was apparently at the end of the Protopalatial period or the beginning of the Neopalatial that the trenches were dug.143 The architectural evidence for dating the construction of the tomb to the MM Ib phase includes the orthostate blocks of the faCade, the dado course at the base of the east and south facades, and perhaps the green schist column bases of the east colonnade.

MALLIA, CHRYSOLAKKOS III Architecture Remains of a third building phase, here designated Chrysolakkos III, are to be found in the north and west facades. Orthostate blocks from Chrysolakkos II have been re-used on the original foundations or the old plinths of that structure to provide the base course or new plinths for walls constructed in a totally different fashion. The old orthostates have been placed on their sides, their original outer faces placed upward to provide the bedding for the new wall and, with one exception, their original upper surfaces (with dowel holes) placed outward to provide a smooth, even face for the base of the new wall.145 The excavators found dressed sandstone blocks against the north wall of the building, which they believed to belong to its superstructure. Some 30 separate pieces are still preserved on the site, includ- ing three intact blocks. With outer faces cut flat, upper and lower surfaces roughly dressed, sides and rear faces broken obliquely forming a wedgelike shape, they are the typical ashlar blocks used in other Neopalatial walls at Mallia.146 The new tomb then was designed with walls of newly cut sandstone blocks sitting on a plinth of re-used limestone blocks. Burials and Chronology The new tomb was designed to follow the lines of the old one, but the reconstruction work was never completed, and it is doubtful that Chrysolakkos III received many burials, if any. A very small amount of MM III pottery is reported from the interior, however,147 and the attempt at reconstruction belongs to the beginning of the Neopalatial period when just such ashlar blocks as those intended for the new facades were in widespread use. Recon- struction work ceased, and the tomb itself was abandoned, probably because of the new burial methods that became fashionable at this time. 144 For the orthostates, compare those at Knossos and Phaistos (Evans, PM I, pp. 127-128; E. Fiandra, "I periodi struttivi del primo palazzo di Festos," KprlrXpov 15-16, A', 1961-1962 [pp. 112-126], p. 125); for the dado, compare that in the Agora at Mallia (H. and M. van Effenterre, Fouilles executees a Mallia, le centre politique, I, L'agora (1960-1966) [Etudes cre'toises XVII], Paris 1969, pp. 28-33, pls.

MALLIA, NECROPOLE DES PIERRES MEULIERES: THE EASTERN OSSUARIES (Fig. 67) Demargne, Mallia, Necropoles I, pp. 61-62. Location and Excavation Two tombs are located just north of the east end of the precinct wall in the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres, some 40 meters west of Chrysolakkos. Both were excavated by De- margne in 1930 and reburied in such a way that only parts are visible today. Architecture The northern and better preserved of the two tombs is a rectangular building with over- all measurements of ca. 4.40 by 5.20 m.148 It is constructed in ordinary rubble fashion with the long walls running north-south. The interior is divided near the center by a spur wall, preserved to a height of five irregular courses, into two rooms, the northern measuring ca. 1.20 by 3.60 m. and the southern ca. 1.60 by 3.60 m. They are connected by an interior doorway on the west ca. 0.80 m. wide. The floor consisted of a thick layer of sand. Although the tomb resembles Tomb II at Gournia in plan and size, it does not appear to have been provided with an exterior doorway; at least none is reported, and none is visible in the published photograph of the tomb. The second tomb, located some six meters southwest, is not specifically mentioned in the publication, although it is included in the plan of the site. It lies alongside the north face of the precinct wall, just east of a retaining wall running north-south at right angles and rein- forcing the terrace on which the tomb stands. The tomb is a rectangular building approxi- mately the same size as the northern tomb, oriented east-west. Its south wall appears to have been formed by the face of the precinct wall against which it is built, and its other walls were constructed in ordinary rubble. Traces of an internal dividing wall remain and suggest that the tomb was originally a two-room building similar in plan to the northern tomb. Burials and Chronology Remains of skulls and bones were found on the floor of the northern tomb. In the northwest corner of the southern room, against the spur wall and by the doorway, the re- mains of two skeletons were found in situ. These were placed on a layer of hard earth ca. 0.30 m. above floor level and apparently represented the latest burials in the tomb. The pottery from the tombs in this area is not published but is reported to be MM I. 25.

Location and Excavation The westernmost tomb in the Necropolis is situated on the coast, overlooking the bay of Pierres Meulieres. It is built into an outer corner of the precinct wall at a point where, having turned south, the wall again projects westward towards the sea. The tomb was excavated by Louis Renaudin in 1921 and is sometimes referred to as the ossuaire Renaudin. 148 Demargne, Mallia, Necropoles I, pl. LXIX:1. 172</page><page sequence="193">MALLIA, NECROPOLE DES PIERRES MEULIERES Architecture The tomb is nearly square, its south and east walls formed by the precinct wall that creates a terrace rising above the rocky seashore. The east wall has caved in at the center, while the south is preserved to a height of three irregular courses.'49 Only one course of the north and west walls, both built in the usual rubble fashion, is preserved. The west wall is buttressed by a boulder set midway against its outer face and terminates at the northwest cor- ner in another boulder, which forms an important cornerstone.'50 The north wall is largely destroyed, and it is unclear whether the tomb was entered through a door on the lower level or through the roof from the terrace above. The tomb appears to have consisted of a single room measuring ca. 3.50 by 3.80 m. that was not subdivided as were the eastern tombs. Burials and Chronology Heaps of human bones, with at least one skull still intact, are reported from the tomb. These remains are similar to those from the rock fissures to the north and like them are thought to belong to primary burials. Five vases from the tomb were inventoried and published.15' They include two vases that Effenterre dated to the EM IIb phase in his latest discussion of the pottery, as well as three cups of the MM I phase. Because of the early vases, Effenterre suggested that the tomb was in use as early as the rock fissures. He has also suggested that the tomb is earlier than the precinct wall against which it is built and that the peculiar indentation along the coast that the wall follows is due to the presence of the pre-existing tomb on the site. In addition to the pottery from inside the tomb, a number of deposits were found in natural cavities on all sides of the tomb and at the foot of the precinct wall to the south.'52 These deposits date to the MM I phase and are distinctive for the numerous clay imitations of stone-vase shapes. Because the larger vases were broken and scattered, the deposits were interpreted as dumps of unwanted material from the surrounding burials, but it is also possible, especially because of their distinctive nature, that the vases originally belonged to votive deposits associated with the tomb and were broken and scattered by the sea. 26.

Location and Excavation The House of the Dead is located along the south side of the precinct wall ca. 25 meters east of the Western Ossuary and ca. 100 meters west of Chrysolakkos. It was excavated in 1928 by Jean Charbonneaux and Charles Picard and reburied; it is not visible today. Be- cause the building was re-used in the Mycenaean period -and is destroyed in part, there is some doubt about its original appearance and function. 149 South wall: W. ca. 0.80 m.; H. ca. 1.30 m. 150 West wall: L. ca. 4.20 m.; W. ca. 0.55 m.; H. ca. 0.35 m. 51 Effenterre, Mallia, Necropoles II, pl.

Mallia, The House of the Dead 174</page><page sequence="195">MALLIA, NECROPOLE DES PIERRES MEULIERES Architecture The building is constructed against the inner, south face of the precinct wall at a point where Effenterre suggested that a break in the wall and an entrance to the Necropolis were located. Most of the center of the building and its southern limits are destroyed, but the re- mains suggest an essentially rectangular original structure including Rooms I through VII and measuring ca. 12 m. east-west, so that the north wall, the precinct wall now partly de- stroyed, would have been continuous. The southern limits may be marked by sections of a wall preserved in Rooms III and V that lie on a line. The west wall is an addition to the precinct wall, which runs at right angles to the latter alongside Effenterre's entrance, and the east wall is the east wall of Rooms V, VI, and VII running parallel to the west wall and to which an additional room, VIII, is appended on the east. The interior is divided by two walls running north-south, parallel to the outer east and west walls and set nearly equidistant from them and from each other. They form three parallel compartments that are further divided into rooms and burial cells by shorter walls running for the most part east-west. Rooms V, VI, and VII are located in the eastern comp- artment, each ca. 1.60 m. wide and ca. 2.40-2.80 m. long. Only Room IV is preserved in the central compartment, measuring ca. 1 by 1.35 m., but two more rooms corresponding to Rooms VI and VII may have been located in the space to the north. Rooms I, II, and III in the western compartment appear to have been more carefully constructed than the other rooms and to have served a special function. The only clear access to the building from the outside is through Room III, where a "probable" threshold was noted in the south wall. This room, measuring ca. 1.80 by 3.40-3.70 m., is provided with stuccoed walls decorated with a painted red band and a stuccoed floor. It gives access through a doorway in its north wall to Rooms I and II, each measuring ca. 1.60 by 4.80 m. and connecting through a door- way at the south. These rooms alone contained ritual objects and, provided with easy access and architecturally enriched, were probably designed as a cult center. Burials and Chronology Burials in the building included simple inhumations, bone dumps, and burials in pithoi and in cists of both the MM I and LM IIIc phases. It is not clearly stated in the publication which pithoi contained burials, but the general impression given is that most, if not all, did. The pithoi are inverted, sometimes ranged in rows along the sides of the rooms, and their tops are broken to place the burials in the jars more easily. Only some of the cists contained burials; most were found empty. All the cists are built well above floor level, in most cases above the preserved level of the walls, and some are located outside the building. They are constructed with sides of sandstone blocks and covering slabs of sandstone or limestone. Room I contained an empty cist (6) located against the spur wall near the center of the room, a jar containing an infant burial in the southwest corner, and fragments of pithoi, thickest along the south wall. Another empty cist (7) was found in Room II, and fragments of bones beneath sandstone blocks against the east wall. Room III yielded an inverted jar with the skeleton of an infant inside and an inhumation beside it located ca. 0.50 m. above floor level; "several skeletons" were found on the stucco floor of the room. Room IV con- tained another empty cist (3) in the southeast corner and, directly below, an inhumation. In Room VI were found an empty cist (9) in the middle of the room and a pithos in the 175</page><page sequence="196">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS northeast corner. Room VII contained an empty cist (11) located above the walls at the northwest corner and, beneath it and ranged along the north wall to the east, remains of five pithoi together with a sixth against the south wall. The pottery from the tomb is dated to the MM I and LM IIIc phases. That found with the inhumation in Room IV, mostly one-handled and handleless conical cups,153 includes some painted in MM Ia styles. Other finds of special interest include a libation vase and an offering table stamped with a double axe on its base, both found in Room III and belonging to the MM I phase.154 Two interpretations of the finds and the function of the building have been suggested, one by the original excavators, Charbonneaux and Picard,'55 the other by Effenterre, who prepared its publication. The excavators identified the building as a tomb originally used in the MM I phase for the burials and rediscovered by the LM IIIc occupants of Mallia, who established a memorial cult of the dead by building cists above the earlier burials to serve as bothroi. Theories of memorial cults of the dead have gone out of vogue, however, and Effen- terre has argued that the building was a house, perhaps a guard house at the entrance to the Necropolis, that was abandoned at the end of the MM I phase and rediscovered by the LM IIIc occupants of the site, who used it and its pithoi for their own burials, building bothroi in the form of cists for cult purposes. Effenterre has pointed to the discovery of a LM IIIc pyxis inside a MM I pithos in Room IX as particular evidence in support of My- cenaean re-use of the original pithoi and his interpretation as a whole. Neither interpretation seems wholly satisfactory. The identification of the building as a house ignores its location in a cemetery, the location of burial pithoi and inhumations di- rectly on the floor of the building, the MM I finds associated with these burials, and the popularity of just such tombs at this time. Both interpretations, in their identification of the cists as bothroi used for libations in a cult of the dead, disregard the cists found outside the tomb (1, 2, 4, 5, 10), those found with cover slabs (10, 11), and those containing burials (1, 2, 3, 4, 5). All these cists were probably intended to serve as graves, and the House of the Dead is simply a MM I house tomb that was partly re-used in the LM IIIc phase for further burials. MYRTOS, PYRGOS 27.

It was reached from the settlement by a flight of steps that appears to have descended from the top of the hill to the north end of a paved road, which in turn runs northeast-southwest along the western slope, ending at the south in a small courtyard in front of the tomb.156 The tomb and its approach were excavated by Gerald Cadogan and the British School at Athens in the summers of 1970, 1971, and 1973.157 Architecture The approach to the tomb, like that to Mochlos Tomb Complex IV/V/VI (pp. 56-57 above), is an integral part of its over-all plan. The paved road and court lead nowhere else and were designed to play an important part in the funerary ritual. Both road and court are paved with slabs of sandstone and show few of the color contrasts so popular elsewhere. One of the slabs at the e north corner of the court (now partly broken) is marked with a ring of hol- lows forming a kernos. The court, which lies open at the northeast and northwest, is flanked by a terrace wall at the southeast, and a bench is located here at the foot of this wall. The tomb itself lies at the southwest side of the court and is entered from its west corner. It is a rectangular building with ordinary rubble walls. Only its outer northeast and north- west walls were entirely freestanding, however, and its southeast wall, which appears to be largely intact, is built in the form of a high retaining wall against the slope of the hill. A door- way set back at the north corner of the tomb leads down by three steps to the original floor level of the main chamber. This room is described by the excavator as an irregular polygon measuring about 3 by 5 meters. A large pillar, its base built of rubble masonry, is located in the center of the room;158 it supported an upper floor of wood. Two ossuaries were attached to the tomb. One, an oval space measuring ca. 1 I y 1.50 m. that rose at least as high as the lower story, was built at the south corner of the tomb. The other, a rectangular room, was located between the northeast wall of the main chamber and the court and was apparently provided with its own doorway opening at the northwest adjacent to the main doorway. Burials and Chronology In the space between the court and the tomb, below the level of the court and alongside the northeast wall, a deposit of pottery including EM III and MM Ia cups and an EM III dove rhyton159 was uncovered. The excavator identified the deposit as a "foundation de- posit", and it seems that the building of the tomb and the original approach from the north date to the EM III/MM Ia phases, what the excavator identifies as Pyrgos Phase II. Later in this phase, perhaps in the MM Ib pottery phase, the court and road were covered with a gravel spread, and the tomb itself may have ceased to be used. In Pyrgos Phase III, which spans most of the Old Palace period, and in Phase IV, which includes most of the New Palace Period, burials were again made in the tomb. In Phase IV some 300 LM I terracotta 156 Cadogan, ArchReports for 1977-1978, p. 71, fig. 4. 157 am indebted to the excavator for permission to study this tomb and reproduce its plan published in Cadogan, ArchReports for 1977-1978; my description follows that of the excavator closely but should be considered tentative until the final publication of the tomb appears. 158 Cadogan, ArchReportsfor 1971-1972, p. 24, fig. 39. 159 Cadogan, ArchReportsfor 1977-1978, p. 73, figs. 6, 7. 178</page><page sequence="199">THE PALAIKASTRO CEMETERIES vases,160 as well as stone vases and triton shells, were deposited in the upper story of the tomb above the pillar crypt (where they later fell), and the excavator has suggested that the upper level of the tomb was used as a place for offerings to the dead. Remains of about 65 individuals were found in the tomb and its ossuaries. In the south ossuary the excavator reports a large pithos full of bones. "Skulls were set around the base of the pithos and other skulls and bones packed into the remaining space. They were all so tight that the flesh had to have rotted before they were put in."161 In the actual tomb cham- ber burials were found in two strata, the lower belonging to Phase III and the upper to Phase IV. Several appear to have been intact and clearly belonged to primary burials.162 What is most startling about the burials is that all those in the tomb chamber, and appar- ently in the ossuaries as well, appear to be male ("one of them as tall as 1.75-1.76 m."). The excavator has described the tomb as a "communal" grave, but it appears to have been used by one small element of the population. THE PALAIKASTRO CEMETERIES The earliest burials at Palaikastro are located in two different cemeteries on either side of the main settlement at Roussolakkos: the Gravel Ridge, lying some 100 meters northeast of Roussolakkos, and Ta Hellenika lying about 300 meters to its north on the south slope of Kastri.163 At the beginning of the EM II phase a small tomb (I) was built on the Gravel Ridge, a narrow peninsula jutting into the sea, its top ca. 100 m. long and no more than 15 meters wide. Somewhat later, in the EM IIb phase, a tomb (II) was built at Ta Hellenika, a much larger area than the Gravel Ridge but without its spectacular view; a third tomb (III) followed here in the EM III phase. At the beginning of the MM I phase four additional tombs were built in these areas, one at Ta Hellenika (VI) and at least three more on the Gravel Ridge (VII, VIIbis, and VIII). At the same time two additional sites came into use: one at Patema, the location of at least one tomb (V), lying ca. 500 m. southwest of Rousso- lakkos on the northernmost slopes of Petsofa; and another at Sarantari, a small hill ca. 350 m. northwest of Roussolakkos, where two tombs (IV a, IV b) were uncovered. While only Tomb II of the early tombs appears to have been used in the MM I phases, all the later MM Ia tombs continued in use into the Protopalatial period, and the site of Sarantari was re-used in the LM III phase for larnax burials. A total of ten tombs and part of an eleventh have been excavated, then, in these cemeteries, and all are small built tombs "with house- like walls."'164 By the Protopalatial period the main settlement at Roussolakkos was nearly encircled by its cemeteries. 28.

It was excavated in 1902 by Robert C. Bosanquet and is totally destroyed today. Architecture Lying on the western slope of the ridge near the water's edge, the tomb was already badly destroyed at the time of excavation. Its walls had slid downwards, and no plan of the remains was attempted. The tomb is reported, however, to have subdivided the west slope of the ridge with low walls of "dry-stone" masonry, and it is compared to the much later Tomb VII on the center of the same ridge, characterized by parallel subdivisions and cell-like compartments. Burials and Chronology The burials from the tomb are not described. The finds included clay vases and incised stone vases of the EM II phase; there is no evidence for dating the tomb as early as the EM I phase, as Dawkins does. The two published clay vases are described below.165 Catalogue of Objects Pottery P I-1 (Her.Mus. 4707). Spherical pyxis PK I, p. 290, fig. 3; Zervos, L'art de la Crete, pl. 100.

As preserved, it measures ca. 7.30 by 9.10 m. on the outside.166 Its walls are apparently built in ordinary rubble fashion, standing "about a foot high," the outer averaging 0.50 m. in width and the inner 0.40 m. The whole outer northwest wall of the tomb is destroyed,167 and the western end of the northeast wall is incomplete. The southwest wall is partly destroyed at both west and east ends, and the southeast wall is partly destroyed at the south. No entry to the tomb is noted by the ex- cavators, but it may have been located in any of these destroyed sections. The inside of the tomb is divided into an L-shaped room that runs the whole length of the southwest and southeast sides of the tomb, ca. 6 by 6.30 m. as preserved, somewhat wider on the southwest than on the southeast, ca. 2.55 m. and ca. 2.10 m. respectively, and a smaller, rectangular room in the north corner, measuring ca. 3 by 5.60 m. as preserved. The southwest wall of the smaller room, which runs parallel to the outer northeast and south- west walls of the tomb, is preserved farther to the west than either of them; the published plan of the tomb suggests that it is preserved for its entire length and that its west end marks the western limit of the tomb. The southeast wall of the smaller chamber, which runs par- allel to the outer southeast wall of the tomb, is broken by a doorway ca. 1 m. wide between the inner and outer rooms. Burials and Chronology No burials were found in the larger chamber. "A few bones and a fragment of a skull" are reported from the smaller north chamber.168 The small number of bones suggested to the excavators that the tomb may have been that of a single individual. Since such a burial would be unusual, however, if not unique, it is more likely that additional burials in the tomb were lost along with the western side. Twenty-five vases were found nearly complete, and while a number of MM vases are reported among them, the published examples belong entirely to the EM IIb phase.169 No fine gray ware or Koumasa-style ware is reported, and it seems that the tomb came into use somewhat later than Tomb I. The MM pottery, which is unpublished, is reported to be like that from the other tombs at Palaikastro and is therefore presumably MM I. All pottery and reported finds, including the fragment of a triton shell and a model boat, came from the larger room and from its southwestern section, leaving the space before the inner doorway free; Dawkins therefore suggested that after the burial in the smaller room was made, the larger "was left open as a sort of mortuary chapel for offerings, and the vases used for this 166 All measurements given for this tomb are taken from Bosanquet, Palaikastro Excavation Notebook for 1904, for the use of which I am indebted to Peter Warren, formerly Assistant Director of the British School at Athens. This particular measurement differs from that given by Dawkins in PK III but not from that of the plan published in Dawkins and Bosanquet, PK IV, fig. 4:1. 167 This is stated in both Dawkins, PK III and Bosanquet, Palaikastro Excavation Notebook for 1904, and the section drawn in the published plan (PK IV, fig. 4:1) is apparently restored. 168 Dawkins, PK III, p. 197. 169 All are made of fine buff clay, and all but one are painted with a red slip, flaked off and badly preserved, which displays only traces of mottling, if any, never so brilliant as on the best examples of Vasilike ware. The major shapes include teapots (Dawkins, PK III, fig. 1:h), pedestaled goblets (fig. 1:f), beaked jugs (fig. 1:a), and straight-sided bowls with rim spout.

On the other hand, the tomb may have been re-used for burials in the MM phase and the MM vases deposited with these. 30. PALAIKASTRO, TOMB III (Fig. 72) Dawkins and Bosanquet, PK IV, pp. 268-272. Location and Excavation Tomb III is the lowest of the tombs at Ta Hellenika, located at the bottom of the south- ern slope of Kastri, ca. 60 meters south of tomb II. It was excavated in 1905 by Dawkins, and like Tomb II it is no longer visible, although its location is marked by a heap of stones. The land here at the bottom of Kastri is flat enough so that the hillside does not interfere with the placement of the long side walls of the tomb, and the tomb is oriented northeast- southwest. Architecture Little is published about the architecture of the tomb except that it consists of six rooms enclosed by low walls and "does not differ essentially from the others." A few additional observations may be made on the basis of the published plan.171 The tomb is a rectangular building ca. 4.80 by 10 m. on the outside.172 It is divided into three consecutive compart- ments with two rooms in each. The northern compartment, containing Rooms 5 and 6, and the central compartment, containing Rooms 3 and 4, are nearly identical in size and plan. The northern one is entered from its southeast corner through an opening giving access to two adjacent rooms divided by a short spur wall and connected by an internal doorway. The central compartment was originally entered through an opening at its southwest corner that provided access to two rooms arranged exactly like those in the northern compartment. On the plan, each of these four rooms measures ca. 1.80 by 3.30 m. The southern compartment, containing Rooms 1 and 2, appears to have been a later addition; on the plan, its walls do not continue from those to the north and do not join them. The west or rear wall is set back from the west walls of the two northern compartments, marking the break and reflecting the internal division of rooms. The addition of this com- partment shut off the entrance to the central one. The southern compartment has no visible entrance, unless a narrow break in the east wall leading into Room 2 represents a doorway. It is composed of smaller, cell-like rooms that do not interconnect, Room 1 measuring ca. 1.80 by 2.40 m., and Room 2 ca. 0.90 by 1.80 m. The fragment of another wall over three meters long is shown on the plan running parallel to the southeast wall of Tomb III. The wall is broken midway by a doorway, ap- parently with threshold intact, and at its north end the wall continues to the southeast. It is most likely the remains of a fourth tomb at Ta Hellenika. 170 Dawkins, PK III, pp. 197-198. 171 Dawkins, PK IV, fig. 4:3. 172 All measurements given here are taken from the plan and should be considered approximate. 183</page><page sequence="204">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS Burials and Chronology Rooms 3 and 4 of the central compartment were "filled with the usual confused mass of re-interred bones mixed with pottery and other objects." The four remaining rooms yielded few finds. In the adjacent corridor to the east, however, additional pottery was uncovered, including three hole-mouthed jars and four cups with slightly contracted mouths "a little different in style" from the pottery inside the tomb. The pottery included 41 complete vases, which are described in the publication.73 With only a few exceptions they are decorated in EM III white-on-dark styles. The most common shape consists of handleless cups, includ- ing some 20 straight-sided conical cups. The tomb appears to have been used mainly in the EM III phase and only briefly, if at all, thereafter. 31, 32. PALAIKASTRO, TOMBS IV a AND IV b (Fig. 73) Hawes in Dawkins and Bosanquet, PK IV, p. 293. Location and Excavation The two tombs are located on top of the hill of Sarantari, at its northwest side; imme- diately below them, LM III larnax burials were found. They were excavated in 1905 by Charles H. Hawes and re destroyed today. Architecture The summit of Sarantari is flat bedrock today, and the tombs were already badly pre- served at the time of excavation; very little information is available about them. The exca- vator remarked that they were built with "house-like walls," presumably of ordinary rubble construction, and contained compartments distinguishable from those of ordinary houses only because of the skeletal remains and funeral goods found inside. In the published sketch plan of the tombs as preserved,174 they are roughly rectangular and oriented north-south. The northern tomb, measuring ca. 5 by 6 m. on the outside, contains two adjacent rooms; the southern, measuring ca. 5.25 by 7 m. on the outside, contains three, two to the north and one to the south, with interconnecting doorways. The fragment of what appears to be a third tomb lies just to the southeast and suggests that originally the summit of Sarantari was built up with a number of tombs. Burials and Chronology The burials are not described. The pottery, which is unpublished, is reported to be MM, and the tombs are dated by the excavator to the same period as those on the Gravel Ridge and Kastri, which is presumably MM I. 33.

FIG. 73. Palaikastro, Sarantari: Tombs IV a and IV b (Dawkins and Bosanquet, PK IV, p. 270, fig. 4) Location and Excavation Tomb V is located some 600 meters southeast of the Gravel Ridge, low on the north slope of Petsofa in the area known as Patema overlooking the Bay of Palaikastro. The tomb was excavated in two separate seasons, in 1903 by W. L. H. Duckworth and in 1905 by Bosanquet. It is apparently destroyed today. Architecture No architectural information about this tomb is available other than that provided by two rather dissimilar plans, one drawn in the Notebook and reproduced here with measure- ments (Fig. 74:a), the other published in PK IV (Fig. 74:b), which may be a reconstruction based on the Notebook drawing. The building represented in the Notebook is an irregular structure, perhaps originally rectangular, with over-all measurements north-south of ca. 7.90 m. It contains three parallel rooms in a compartment at the east side of the building and three or four additional rooms in a compartment to the west. Burials and Chronology Scattered skeletal remains and one burial in situ were reported from the earlier excava- tions. The skeleton lay on its left side in contracted position, oriented northeast by southwest, 185</page><page sequence="206">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS .65' 2.75 0 \,j (1) (3)(4) (2) o' 1.70 IO01 0 S N _-- ' 0 0 1.20 , N L _ 2.15 cSt: 2.00 i a.

A skull was found directly above and crushed into the pelvis of Burial 3; another (4) was found among a heap of bones just to the east. In addition, one vase "from the same neighborhood" (P 1419) contained bones. Another skull (2) was found in the east central room against the north wall. The date of the tomb, like its plan, is a matter of some confusion. In the initial reports the tomb was dated to the MM I phase, and the only vase published at this time is a miniature 175 Bosanquet and Dawkins, PK II, p. 354, figs. 5, 6. 186</page><page sequence="207">THE PALAIKASTRO CEMETERIES jug of the MM Ia style.176 Some years later, however, Bosanquet and Dawkins noted that the Patema tomb was "already in use in the EM period," and in the chronological summary of the site of Palaikastro published in 1965 the tomb was cited as evidence that occupation began with the EM I phase.177 Only one of the "EM" vases has been published. It is a cylindrical pyxis without handles or feet, decorated with incised vertical bands of chev- rons.178 Dawkins dated this vase to the EM I phase, and Renfrew has compared it to Cyclad- ic vases of the Grotta-Pelos culture. 179 It has several parallels in shape with MM Ia pyxides, however, and it is by no means clear that it should be dated to the EM phase.180 In any case the pottery sketched and inventoried in the Notebook is without exception MM I.

PALAIKASTRO, TOMB VI (Fig. 72) Dawkins, PK III, p. 202; Bosanquet, Palaikastro Excavation Notebook for 1904. Location and Excavation This tomb is located a short distance south of Tomb II at Ta Hellenika. It was excavat- ed in 1904 by Bosanquet. and was apparently reburied. Like Tomb II it is not visible today, but its location is marked with a heap of stones. Architecture Only a little information is published about the architecture, but some additional facts, including measurements, are provided in the Notebook. The tomb is a rectangular building with a but-and-ben plan. It is constructed with "low" rubble walls, the north wall parallel to the south but a meter longer, and the east and west walls converging towards the south. The east wall does not join the south wall but turns west at a right angle, running parallel to it and ending before reaching the west wall.181 The tomb thus consists of two rooms, the main entrance at the southeast corner through the space between the east and south walls, and the inner room reached through the space at the northwest corner of the outer.182 The southern, outer room forms a vestibule ca. 1.10 by 1.90 m. in size, and the larger, inner room appears to have served as the main burial chamber, measuring ca. 2.40 by 3.80 m. Burials and Chronology The outer room contained the remains of only one burial, which rested on a layer of small round sea pebbles like those mixed with plaster in the later house floors on the site. In contrast, the inner room was full of bones packed closely together in an irregular arrange- ment including a number of skulls: 12 listed in the Notebook were for the most part badly crushed. Dawkins noted that "the interments were certainly not all secondary, for there were two clear cases of contracted burials." These, like those at Patema, lay on their left sides with heads to the east. The pottery, which is unpublished, is reported to be MM, all of it unpainted. Twenty- three complete vases were found. Eleven are plain handleless cups of Palaikastro Types 6, 6a, and 6b,183 which are the tumblers and conical cups typical of the MM I phase. In addition, the Notebook records in sketches the find of two jugs, one like Palaikastro Type 7 with round instead of trefoil mouth.184 At least one of the jugs is wheelmade with a string- marked base and belongs to the MM Ib phase. 35.

It was excavated in 1902 by Bosanquet and in 1903 by Duckworth. Because of its location on a peak of the ridge, much of the tomb, including its entire northeast corner, was already destroyed at this time. In recent years the remainder has been largely demolished by a shepherd who has used the stones of the tomb to construct a small hut at its north side. The north and south walls of this hut appear to rest on the ancient foundations of the tomb, however, and the hut itself, with its low walls and flat earthen roof, gives an idea of how one 189</page><page sequence="210">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS 50 ---- - ?e G I , " -- -- --- - Iet, 1 `i N. 0 1 2 3 4 5m.

Parts of the outer west and south walls of the tomb remain visible today at ground level. Architecture The tomb consists of a roughly rectangular building ca. 8.25 by 9.70 m. Its walls are constructed in ordinary rubble, occasionally with a single stone filling the entire width. The outer walls on the west, south, and east are somewhat wider than those on the interior and on the north, and the preserved north wall may be another interior wall and not the original north facade of the tomb. The interior is divided by four long, parallel east-west walls. All are broken off at the east, but in the view of the excavators they originally joined the toouter east and west walls and created five long, narrow compartments that did not interconnect (Fig. 76, bottom). This reconstruction is somewhat misleading, however, since these com- partments were further subdivided into small cells by short, non-continuous walls running north-south between the longer dividing walls. Only one of these short north-south walls is illustrated (Fig. 76, top), and they are omitted entirely from the plan,185 although their locations seem to correspond with the gaps between the finds plotted on it. A photograph of the tomb taken in the 1940's shows these internal dividing walls quite clearly (PI. 40:a).186 At least three cells were located in Compartments 1, 2, and 3, and at least two in Compart- ment 4. The cells vary in size; some are rectangular andry some square. The an. cell in the north- west corner of the tomb (Fig. 76, top) measures ca. 1.15 m. square. No entrance to the tomb is reported, and while one or more may have existed in the destroyed northeast corner, most of the cells were probably entered from the roof. Burials and Chronology With the exception of an infant burial inside a tall, two-handled vase, no burials were found in situ inside the tomb, and Bosanquet concluded that only "the skulls and principal bones of bodies skeletonised by previous interment elsewhere were deposited in this final resting place." Several skulls together with other bones and accompanying funeral offerings were located in each cell, and no cell appears to have been reserved for only one individual. Some 97 skulls were recovered in all. In addition, a primary burial, consisting of a skeleton stretched at full length, was found outside the southeast corner of the tomb. Over 140 vases were collected in the 1902 excavation alone. They included many cups and plates that were found inverted. Twenty-four of the vases are illustrated;187 they belong to the MM Ia and Ib phases and are characteristic of the MM I pottery from Palaikastro.188 36.

It was excavated by Bosanquet in 1902. Architecture Only part of one wall was found intact; the rest of the building had already been de- stroyed. The part preserved is described as a "fragment of good ashlar wall three courses high."190 The blocks of the top two courses measured ca. 0.22 by 0.53 by 0.20 m. Bosanquet suggested that the wall had been carried higher in mud brick and plastered over and that it represented the remains of "an ossuary-enclosure built with more than usual care." Burials and Chronology No burials are reported, and only two vases were found alongside the surviving wall. These are a coarse red bowl containing fine lime and the famous bowl with shepherd and flock that belongs to the MM Ib style.191 37. PALAIKASTRO, TOMB VIII (Fig. 75) Duckworth in Bosanquet and Dawkins, PK II, pp. 352-353, fig. 4. Location and Excavation This tomb is the second of the two on the Gravel Ridge not included in Dawkins' summary.192 It lies some 15 meters south of Tomb VII on the southernmost peak of the ridge and like Tomb VII is only partially visible today. It was excavated by Duckworth in 1903. Architecture Little information about the appearance of the tomb is available. It is built with or- dinary rubble walls, and the part excavated seems to have been a rounded building of irreg- ular plan. The rounded walls may be due to their location around the side of a conglomerate outcropping to the north, however, and the part that once lay to the south may have been constructed more regularly. The excavator noted that "suggestions of compartments were met with." Only the one illustrated in the plan (Fig. 75), which contained skeletal material, appears to be complete. It measures ca. 1.20 by 3 m. and is entered through a doorway at the northeast, just outside of which a large flat flagstone of uncertain use was uncovered. Burials and Chronology "Ten skulls and many limb bones" are reported from the one complete room. Appar- ently no skeletal remains were found in situ. The pottery from the tomb is not mentioned, 189 Dawkins, PK IV, p. 269. 190 By "ashlar" Bosanquet could not mean true ashlar, which does not appear before the MM Ib phase; for the type of construction to which he may refer, see p. 208 below. 191 For the date of the bowl, discussion, and bibliography, see Zois, Kamares-Stil, pp. 243, 262. 192 Dawkins, PK IV, p. 269. 192</page><page sequence="213">PORTI and no date is given; Duckworth, however, describes the tomb together with the MM I tomb at Patema, and the implication is that the two are contemporary. THE PLATANOS CEMETERY The cemetery of Platanos, lying just west of the modern village on level ground in the Mesara Plain, contains several major tombs, including three large tholoi. In many ways it resembles the Koumasa cemetery. It too was first used in the EM II phase and then re-used after some interval in the EM III/MM Ia phases. It continued in use longer than the Koumasa cemetery, however, lasting into the Protopalatial and Neopalatial eras. Like the Koumasa cemetery it is provided with a paved court, also flanked by a precinct wall, and with a number of smaller built rectangular tombs in addition to the tholoi. 38, 39. PLATANOS, TOMBS a AND y Xanthoudides, VTM, p. 93. Location and Excavation The rectangular tombs are in the field north of the two tholoi A and B, near the largely destroyed Tholos F. They were excavated in 1914 and 1915 by Stephanos Xanthoudides, who provides very little information about them. The field is cultivated today, and nothing remains of them. Architecture Xanthoudides describes the tombs as "small buildings square in plan arranged in groups," each building consisting of several chambers. Tomb a is actually a group of three rectangular buildings, each from ca. 3 to 4 m. long. Pieces of clay with reed impressions found with the buildings caused Xanthoudides to conclude that the tombs had been roofed with timber and clay. Burials and Chronology The burials are not described except for the note that a mass of half-burnt bones was found in Tomb y. The buildings are reported to be the burial places of "poor persons", presumably because of the paucity of funerary gifts. Sherds of the LM I phase were recov- ered, and the tombs were used at that time. Somewhat enigmatic objects of unbaked clay described as "phalloi" were also recovered, however, and since these are identical to "phal- loi" found in MM I contexts in Trench 8 and at Koumasa, the tombs may date to a much earlier period. PORTI 40. PORTI, TOMB 8 Xanthoudides, VTM, pp. 54-69. Location and Excavation The site of Porti is easily accessible today a short distance beyond Kantela, just to the eastern side of the road leading south towards Vasilike in the Mesara Plain. The hill where 193</page><page sequence="214">A CATALOGUE OF HOUSE TOMBS the cemetery is located is as Xanthoudides describes it, and Tholos nI may still be seen at its northwest corner. On the same plateau, apparently somewhere to the east of the tholos since the acropolis rises almost immediately above it to the south, Xanthoudides uncovered a built rectangular tomb, 8, which is not visible today. Architecture Xanthoudides reports that the tomb was built partly by cutting into bedrock, that it had a wall length of ca. 2.60 m., and that an entrance "hole" ca. 1 m. wide was located on its south side. Since he does not provide any additional information, the appearance of the tomb is somewhat unclear. Burials and Chronology A pithos, inverted and containing human bones, was found in one corner. Other in- verted pithoi with bones found "a few meters farther on" together with remains of walls suggested to Xanthoudides that they too had been placed in small tombs like 8 "lying close to the surface." No pottery is reported from Tomb 8 other than the burial pithos, which is said to belong to the Kamares style. The burials in pithoi and small tombs elsewhere at Porti are dated to the MM phase, although none of the pottery from these areas is published. The MM pot- tery from the tholos and its annexes includes examples of the MM Ia and Ib phases,193 and it is likely that the adjacent MM tombs, including 8, are contemporary. VASILIKE, IERAPETRAS 41.

Location and Excavation The tomb at Vasilike is located on a slope south of the Kephala, where the settlement is situated, apparently near the remains of walls connected with a small Roman conduit. It was excavated by Seager in 1906. The area around the Kephala is heavily cultivated today; while parts of the conduit may still be traced, there are no traces of the tomb itself, and it is probably destroyed. Architecture Seager described the tomb simply as a "bone enclosure" without further comment. Hall, who presumably had firsthand knowledge of it, provided a few more details. She compared it to the tombs at Palaikastro and Gournia and noted that it belonged to a class of tombs built above ground with long, narrow burial chambers. She reported that it had more than one room but did not say how many. 193 Zois, 'ApX'E4P 1965, p. 67, note 2; Zois, HpoSAXhtara, pp. 32-33, 97; Walberg, Middle Minoan Pot- tery, p. 100. 194</page><page sequence="215">THE ZAKROS CEMETERY Burials and Chronology Four undecorated larnakes, compared to one from Pachyammos,194 were recovered from the tomb. Their contents are not described. One small black MM cup is also reported, and Seager dated the tomb to the MM I phase. The earliest of the MM houses in the settle- ment on the Kephala appears to have been built in the MM Ia phase, and both houses were used in the Old Palace period. It is likely that the tomb was used at the same time. THE ZAKROS CEMETERY In the Prepalatial and Protopalatial eras the mountain slopes that surround the plain of Kato Zakros on its nor west and south,,, as well as the gorge formed by the Zakros river to the northwest of the plain, were used as burial sites. Some 15 graves have been investigated and reported to date.195 Most are simple burials in the rock shelters and caves that abound in the rocky slopes to the north and in the precipitous cliffs of the gorge. Two exceptions are the house tombs located low on the easterly slopes of the hills lying to the west of the plain at Pezoules Kephalas near the modern road leading to Epano Zakros. The slope is gentler at this point, extending some distance to the north and south, and may have accommodated other built tombs in addition to those that have been exposed. The area overlooks the plain, including the site of the palace to the northeast and the sea beyond. 42.

Location and Excavation The larger of the tombs, lying higher up the slope alongside the modern road, Tomb A is set against the east face of a large outcropping of gray limestone which forms a natural L-shaped nook against which the tomb is built. Its steep faces shelter the western walls of the tomb and are used for part of the wall. The tomb was excavated in 1966 by Nicholas Platon196 and reinvestigated in 1973 by Marshall Becker. Architecture Tomb A is a three-room rectangular structure measuring ca. 4.28 by 6.56 m. (irregu- lar) on the outside. It is oriented northeast by southwest, as the location requires.197 Its east wall runs more or less parallel to the face of the cliff on the west, and two lateral walls run at right angles from the east wall to the cliff face. The east wall, the most strongly constructed because of its position on the outside of the slope, is composed of large stones that run the 194 Seager, Pachyammos, pl.

Only three remain in place, however, to the height of one course, in the northern half of the wall; the southern half has been largely destroyed by erosion. The lateral walls are constructed in usual rubble fashion. The outer north wall, preserved to a height of two courses near the face of the cliff, is partly destroyed at the east. At the west, where it joins the face of the cliff, a bedding cut in the cliff face extends about 0.70 meters farther west and may have served to support an extension of the wall. The south wall, also preserved to a height of two courses, has been destroyed at the east, where it apparently joined the vanished section of the east wall. The west end joins the face of the cliff, which juts out to the east at this point so that the built section of the south wall is shorter than the north wall. The interior face of the wall, however, is carried farther west in an even line by an extension consisting of a single face of stones, preserved to a height of four courses, set against an indentation in the cliff face.198 The tomb has no visible entrance. It may have been entered through an opening at the destroyed southeast corner or from above, perhaps from the level of the cliff to the west. The interior is divided in half by a central partition wall running east from the face of the cliff parallel to the lateral walls. Built in the same manner as the lateral walls but somewhat narrower, it is preserved for six irregular courses, nearly one meter high. It ends before reaching the east wall, leaving space for a doorway ca. 0.62 m. wide along the eastern side of the tomb. The largest room, B, lies north of this wall and the smaller rooms, A and F, to the south. Originally the southern compartment seems to have been as large as the northern, but at some point it was divided into two rooms by a short wall running north-south between the central partition and the south wall.199 Although the two upper courses of this wall are constructed in normal rubble fashion, the base consists of two faces of large flat stones laid on edge against rubble fill, a technique not found in the other walls. At the south the wall curves east, and it does not bond at either end with the walls running east-west. The erec- tion of this wall isolated the small room r in the southwest corner of the tomb; it measures ca. 1.96 m. north-south and widens from ca. 0.64 m. at the north to ca. 1.04 m. at the south. It is flanked on the west by a retaining wall, preserved to a height of three courses, set against rubble fill in front of the cliff. Like the east wall of the room, the west wall does not bond with the north and south walls, and it may have been added at the same time. Since the room has no entry at floor level, the fill at the west side may have been designed to provide a solid platform for entering the room from above. Room A, the southeastern limits of which are lost, probably did not extend much farther east than Room B to its north. The preserved south end of the east wall reaches inside Room A and probably carried straight across to the outer south wall of the tomb. The room measures ca. 1.72 m. in length and ca. 1.44 m. in width at the north. As noted, it may have served as an antechamber, for it provides access to Room B through an opening at the northeast. Room B, which occupies the northern half of the tomb, is roughly rectangular, but because of the slanting line that the face of the cliff follows in this room it is ca. 3.12 m. long at the south and only ca. 2.08 m. long at the north. 198 Exterior walls: p.L. of north wall ca. 2.32 m.; W. 0.68-0.76 m.; H. ca. 0.45 m.

The west wall is formed by the face of the cliff at the south and by a supplementary wall, preserved to a height of two courses, at the north where the natural rock is indented.200 The floors of all three rooms appear to have been formed of packed earth above bedrock. Since no traces of roofing were found, the excavator concluded that the tomb was un- roofed and consisted simply of a walled burial precinct or rTadLKos 7rEp'oAos. According to this view, each burial, a true inhumation, would have been placed in a hole dug inside the enclosure; the hole would then be filled in and the area leveled. The presence of an interior doorway, however, and the disposition of skeletal material within the tomb suggest that one could move around inside. It is more likely that the walls were finished off in mud brick and that the building was roofed. Roof beams could have been laid north-south across the lateral walls. The traces of a bedding for an upper wall in the cliff face at the northwest corner of the tomb may thus best be explained by the need to extend the north wall in order to bring the west end into line with that of the central dividing wall. The fill on the west side of Room r, which establishes the even line for this side of the room not provided by the irregu- lar cliff, may also have aided in the support of a roof. Burials and Chronology The excavator estimated that there had been as many as 600 burials in the tomb. Most of the remains consisted of scattered bones, including a large number belonging to skulls, limbs, and pelvises. The missing pieces were thought to have been thrown away during cleanings of the tomb. Some 45 complete skulls were reported. Most of these, as well as the other skeletal material erand the accompanying grave goods, were located at the sides of the rooms, and much of the material was found lying in successive strata. In addition to skeletal remains, Rooms A and r yielded fragments of larnakes. Room B contained an undisturbed burial inside a narrow rectangular larnax in the center of the room, oriented north- south.20 The head of the skeleton lay to the north and the contracted limbs to the south. A second skull, which the excavator believed to have belonged to an earlier burial in the lar- nax, had been placed at the foot of the preserved skeleton. Pieces of two lids and three other larnakes were found at the foot of this larnax, and remains of two or more were found in the eastern and northern parts of the room. Remains of pithos burials were found along the eastern side. In the excavator's view all the pottery from the tomb belongs to the MM Ia phase.202 It has recently been examined by Walberg, however, and shown to include examples of MM Ib/II styles as well.203 Among the most common shapes are cups, some conical, with or without handles, others carinated with one handle. 43.

It is set among large outcroppings of gray limestone that fill part of the wall space on its south and west sides. They do not rise so high, however, as the outcroppings west of Tomb A. The tomb was excavated by Platon at the same time as A. Architecture The tomb is a one-room rectangular building, oriented in approximately the same direc- tion as Tomb A, with internal measurements of ca. 2.24 by 3.32 m. None of its walls is completely preserved. The eastern wall has been largely destroyed, most of it apparently washed down the slope, except for a few odd stones still in place providing its inside face. It is bounded at the north by a single large stone and at the south by a limestone outcropping that acts as a cornerstone for the east and south walls. The south wall is formed by a row of large stones placed upright in the gap between this outcropping and the large one to the west. Although unworked, the stones fit tightly together with only a minimum of earth bonding and form a retaining wall against a loose fill of earth and rocks. The west wall is formed largely by the outcropping. Where the outcropping slopes back on the north and south, sup- plementary walls have been built to maintain a straight side. The north wall, constructed in usual rubble fashion, is the best preserved and stands in places to a height of two courses.204 No entrance was visible, and while one may have existed where there is now a large gap in the east wall, it may also have taken the form of an opening in the roof. The excavator has suggested that there was no entrance and no superstructure but, like Tomb A, simply a walled area into which holes were dug for each inhumation. The straight lines formed by the interior faces of the walls and the right angles at the corners, however, are refinements that usually indicate a more substantial structure. The bases of the walls all lie at the same level, and the tomb was originally designed for a level floor. Towards the southwest an undulating outcropping of stone forms part of the floor; simple packed earth appears to have formed the remainder. Burials and Chronology As in Tomb A most of the burials and accompanying grave goods were found near the sides of the tomb. The skeletal remains again consisted mainly of the larger bones and skulls, some 20 complete examples of which were reported. A large number of the skulls were found along the north side, where they had apparently been gathered together. Three burials, which were thought to be the latest in the tomb, were undisturbed. One, located midway along the western side of the tomb, was placed inside a narrow rectangular larnax like that from Room B of Tomb A.205 The skeleton was contracted, its head to the north. The other two had been placed near the eastern wall of the tomb in a small rectangular area marked off by small stones. They lay in an east-west direction in contracted position with their funeral gifts near by.206 204 Walls: p.L. of east wall (excluding outcropping) ca. 3.72 m.; W. ca. 0.56 m.; H. ca. 0.30 m.

They include both males and females, the greatest number, perhaps as many as 40, being females, and represent all ages above six years, with the largest percentage, nearly half, belonging to adults in the 18 to 50 year range and the smallest number, only four, belonging to children or adolescents in the 6 to 16 year range. Some 70 complete vases were collected from the tomb. Similar in shape and decoration to those from Tomb A, they are also dated by the excavator to the MM Ia phase.

They all have close parallels in domestic architecture and were constructed along the lines of real houses, although they were to have a quite different use. In this respect they are remarkable among the built tombs of the period, and both the tholos tombs and cist graves, which appear considerably earlier at the beginning of the Bronze Age, are distinctly separate phenomena, perhaps reflecting the influence of foreign contacts.1 PLANS (Fig. 79) Few tombs at Mochlos and Gournia are unique in plan, and all fall into the three broad categories that encompass most of the tombs of this type: they may simply be described as tombs with single, double, or compound rooms (Types A, B, and C). All are introduced as early as the EM II phase and used throughout the Prepalatial period. The one-room tombs of Type A are particularly common among the smaller South Slope tombs on Mochlos and include Tombs VII, XI, XIII, XV, XXII, B, Z, H, I, and K, or ten of the 26 exposed tombs. Similar one-room tombs are to be found at the same time at the Mallia Western Ossuary and at Koumasa, Tomb F, and perhaps the small tombs located outside the tholoi. The type continues in the MM I phase at Gournia IV, Zakros B, Archanes 19, Porti, and the lepoS adKKos at Gournes. It reappears in the Mycenaean age at Agia Triada in the Tomb of the Painted Sarcophagus. All these tombs are approximately square or rectangular in plan; they vary in size from as little as ca. 2.15 by 2.45 m. to as much as ca. 5.10 by 5.20 m. Many are provided with doorways located either in the center of one wall or at one corner; others have no apparent entrance. Parallels in domestic architecture may be found both at Magasa in eastern Crete and Debla in western Crete. The Late Neolithic rock-shelter house at Magasa recalls Mochlos VII and I, as all three structures are formed by extensions of walls in front of already existing rock shelters. The house at Magasa appears to have been ca. 4.50 m. deep, somewhat larger than either Mochlos tomb; its exact plan is lost, and so it is unclear whether it was any more complex.2 Dawkins compared it to modern-day sheepfolds that are also built against pre-existing rock shelters, and that is exactly what the two Moch- los tombs resemble as well. The EM I/II houses at Debla, particularly Houses 2 and 3, offer clearer parallels. Both are nearly square, about the same size as the smaller one-room See, however, S. Hood ("Cyprus and the Early Bronze Age: Circular Tombs of Crete," IlpaKTrKa B' ALEOvoV Kvp&amp;rpLoXoytKov Lvvebplov, To/,uo A', Nicosia 1985, pp. 43-49); he argues that the tholos repre- sents an ancient form of house. There may also be a connection between the house tomb and the tholos annex. The earliest annexes, including those at Siva, Lendos, and Agia Kyriaki, which appear to be additions to earlier tholoi, and those at Koumasa and Platanos A are contemporary with the first house tombs and show some architectural resemblance. 2 Dawkins and Bosanquet, PK IV, pp. 261-262, fig. 1.</page><page sequence="223">PLANS A B C D 0O~l ...~2 .3 m .

Plans of house-tomb types tombs, and each is provided with a doorway, either at the center of one wall or at one corner of the wall.3 Other houses like those at Debla have yet to be reported, but the relatively large number of tombs with one room suggests that such a house plan was once common in the Prepalatial period. Tombs with two rooms, Type B, include several varieties with slightly different inter- nal arrangements. The most common are those divided near the center by an internal wall that leaves space at one end for passage between the two rooms. The earliest examples are 3 Warren and Tzedakis, BSA 69, 1974, pp. 313-315, figs. 14, 15. 203</page><page sequence="224">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES found at Mochlos: XVI, XVII, XX/XXI, I (before additions), IX and X, and A and XXIII; later examples include Gournia II, the two Eastern Ossuaries at Mallia, Zakros A, where one room is subdivided by a later wall, Archanes 8, and perhaps Gournia VII, which may have been incompletely preserved. Closely related are the tombs that have continuous internal walls without any apparent internal doorway from one room to the other: Mochlos A, Archanes 6 in its original plan, Gournia I, and perhaps Agios Georgios. Less common are those with but-and-ben plan (Palaikastro VI and Mochlos IV/V/VI in its original plan) and an internal room reached through an outer vestibule (Palaikastro II). Like Type A tombs, these may or may not be provided with an external doorway; some are unusual, however, in that each room has its own entrance despite the internal doorway (Mochlos I, IX-X, A-XXIII). The tombs range in size from ca. 3 by 3.70 m. to as much as ca. 7.30 by 9.10 m., although most fall in the 5-6 m. range. Probably the best parallels in domestic architecture for the type are House 0 at Mallia in its first stage of development (MM Ib), the North House at Vasilike in its first stage (EM IIa), and the late Neolithic but-and-ben house at Magasa. The northwest wing of House 0, Rooms y and 8, which may have formed a separate house with its own entrance at one corner, is especially similar in plan and size to Gournia II and the Eastern Ossuaries at Mallia.4 Unlike the tombs, however, it is not a freestanding building, as it is joined at the southeast by a separate unit of rooms. The North House at Vasilike, on the other hand, is a freestanding structure and is also similar in size to most of the tombs.5 It has no apparent doorways on the interior or exterior and most closely recalls Gournia II and Agios Georgios. The but-and-ben house at Magasa, also a freestand- ing structure, is identical to Palaikastro VI and Mochlos IV/VI in plan but is about twice their size.6 Freestanding houses, to which the tombs may be compared, are rare in the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods since most, like Mallia House 0, have been added to and enlarged until the original core of the building is scarcely recognizable. As a result, most of the parallels for Type B tombs are found within larger structures from the time of the EM II phase on.7 While Type A and B tombs are originally built as single units, tombs with compound plans, Type C, seldom are. These tombs have three or more rooms, some of which are likely to be additions to an original unit. Among the early tombs of this type are the large tombs on the West Terrace at Mochlos, where original two-room units have been expanded by the addition of one or more rooms; Gournia III, where the tomb is simply a series of walls added one alongside the other; Archanes 6, where the original unit is nearly lost among later additions; and Archanes 7. Among the later examples are Archanes 5, Gournes, probably Vasilike, and the South Building at Agia Triada. With the exception of Archanes 6, where 4 Effenterre (under AT 5-5, p. 123 above), pp. 13-14, pl. XXI. 5A.

See also the MM II shrine at Mallia which is similar to Mochlos IV/V/VI in several respects (Poursat, BCH 90, 1966, pp. 514-551, figs. 3, 4). Its but-and-ben nucleus is about the same size as that of the Mochlos tomb and is also flanked on the outside by a narrow pavement; its Room 2 appears to be an addition like Mochlos V. 7 For the evolution of this type, see D. Mackenzie, "Cretan Palaces and the Aegean Civilization," BSA 14, 1907-1908 (pp. 343-422), pp. 362-369, figs. 4-7. 204</page><page sequence="225">AGGLUTINATIVE ARCHITECTURE the additions seem to have been made long after the construction of the original unit, and perhaps the north addition to Mochlos I, the additions to these buildings appear to be nearly contemporary with the original construction or at least within the same pottery phase. Such tombs again find parallels in contemporary architecture, and the North House at Vasilike, an MM Ia house at Tylissos,8 and Mallia House 0 all illustrate the same sort of aggluti- native process where additions are quickly made to a two-room unit resulting in a larger, more complex plan. At the end of the Prepalatial period still a fourth type of tomb appears, Type D, with multiple rooms, which is not, however, represented at either Mochlos or Gournia. These tombs are large rectangular structures with a regular external appearance that are subdi- vided into a number of small rooms by crosswalls usually running parallel to the outer walls and intersecting at right angles. Often the interior rooms do not connect and appear to be isolated cells entered from the roof. Tombs of this sort include Palaikastro V and VII, the House of the Dead at Mallia, and Archanes 3 and 18; the type gives rise to Chrysolakkos II at Mallia in the MM Ib phase. The earlier tombs range in size from ca. 6.50 by 8 m. to ca. 8 by 12 m.; they are dwarfed by the huge Chrysolakkos II, which is nearly five times as large as Archanes 3. The same type of plan appears in domestic architecture. Apparently contem- porary with the earlier of the tombs is Mallia House B,9 which was originally mistaken for a tomb because of its similarity to Chrysolakkos II.10 The Protopalatial house Stou Kouse also belongs to this type,11 and still others of the same date are reported at Kalathiana.12 The houses at Mallia and Stou Kouse are not much larger than the earlier tombs, Stou Kouse measuring ca. 11 m. square, and each contains a number of apparently isolated, cell- like rooms as well as a number that connect at ground level. AGGLUTINATIVE ARCHITECTURE The tombs at Mochlos and Gournia, as well as many of those catalogued in Chapter III, illustrate important stages in the evolution of Minoan architecture. Many of the tombs appear to be more fully evolved than others. The tombs that are only half built and make use of natural rock cliffs for a large part of their structure (Mochlos X, XX/XXI; Gournia III) or those that are mere extensions of rock shelters (Mochlos VII, I) suggest a formative stage when men are still experimenting with built architecture and still take full advantage of the natural terrain in erecting their structures. Many of these tombs, with their irregular lines and rock walls, suggest a stage when men are not quite sure what a house ought to look like, and experimental plans result. Still other tombs illustrate a stage when the idea of something more complex than a simple one-room structure was beginning to emerge. Mochlos IX and X, A and XXIII are all basically one-room tombs, each provided with its 8J. Hazzidakis, Les villas minoennes de Tylissos (Etudes cretoises III), Paris 1921, pp. 59-60, pl.

Like Mochlos I they seem to have been designed with interior doorways from the start, but they nevertheless illustrate an important step when the possi- bility of a plan more complex than that of a simple one-room structure and "the convenience of direct internal communication," as Mackenzie put it, have just been realized.13 The next step is the realization that two entrances are not necessary once the internal doorway has been created, and a true two-room structure emerges when one of these external doorways is closed off. Such a stage appears in several of the two-room tombs where one room provides the only access to the other. Tombs with compound plans illustrate a still further step in which the original building, whether a one- or two-room unit, is enlarged by one or more additions. In most cases, these additions are made without full realization of their inherent possibilities. Even after all its additions, Mochlos I/II/III, for example, remains basically three separate chambers without any means of internal communication. Palaikastro III, on the other hand, may represent a slightly more developed stage in which the possibility of using one of the additions to reach one of the original units is realized, and a larger, more coherent interior results. The type of agglutinative construction that characterizes so many of these tombs, espe- cially those with compound plans, has been thought to explain the evolution both of the one- room house into more complicated houses and of these into the small villages with closed plans that appear in the EM II phase at sites like Myrtos and Vasilike.14 In this respect, the cemeteries at Mochlos and Gournia represent a pre-village stage in which the characteristic plan of the EM II village has not yet appeared and freestanding houses are still the fashion. They should be compared to EM I/II sites like Debla or Elenes, Amariou, each with an open settlement plan.15 Mochlos appears slightly more evolved, not because of its decep- tively regular layout but because the agglutinative process has begun, and several of the tombs are attached to one another to form small but continuous blocks. The cemetery plan, however, is still an open plan and contrasts with the contemporary settlement on the island, a sufficient portion of which was revealed by Seager in Block A to suggest a closed plan with many small attached rooms. While the Prepalatial settlement at Gournia has never been exposed, it probably resembled near-by Vasilike, and once again the settlement plan had evolved to a much greater extent than the cemetery. To this extent the two cemeteries at Mochlos and Gournia arrelis of and G earlier age, and Pendlebury's observation that the tombs on Mochlos imitated houses of a bygone age is basically correct. It might be more accurate, however, to observe that the cemeteries illustrate an incomplete stage in the forma- tion of a Prepalatial settlement. The cemetery at Archanes, on the other hand, is consider- ably more developed than either Mochlos or Gournia; it illustrates the way the closed plan of a Prepalatial village might emerge from a number of pre-existing units that are added to again and again until they all join in one agglomeration of buildings and the original units 13 Mackenzie (footnote 7 above, p. 204), p. 364. 14 R.

In different circumstances the cemeteries at Mochlos and Gournia might have done the same. That they did not may be the result of population demands and changing burial customs. In the MM Ia phase, when the greatest growth occurs in the Archanes cemetery, Mochlos appears to have been in decline, and many of its tombs went unused. At Gournia the population at large chose a new type of burial in pithos fields instead of further development in the North Cemetery. WALLS With few exceptions the tomb walls are constructed in rubble masonry of standard Minoan type. Such masonry consists of inner and outer faces of rough, unworked stones laid in irregular courses with earth or mud bonding. Within this standard type are many variations that have no chronological significance. In width, the walls average about half a meter, although some may be narrower, especially interior walls, and exterior walls may some- times exceed one meter. The stones employed, usually ordinary fieldstones gathered from the surrounding countryside without quarrying, average ca. 0.20 by 0.30 m. in size but may also vary from fist-sized stones to boulders. They tend to be irregular in shape, and the flat stones employed in so many of the Mochlos walls are unusual. The laying of the stone courses varies in regularity. Usually uneven, on occasion they appear to have been laid more carefully along roughly parallel lines. Often regularly and irregularly laid courses may be observed in different walls of the same tomb. Earth is the standard bonding and is used both as mortar between horizontal layers of stone and as fill in the center of walls. It is always mixed with pebbles or stone chips and occasionally with pot sherds. The quantity of sherds varies widely, however, and in some walls almost none can be found, while in others large numbers are used, thus providing a convenient method for dating the construction. Some- times the earth also appears to have been mixed with water to form a mud mortar. The amount of bonding varies from large to small depending on the size of the stones used in the facings and on the width of the wall itself. The term "dry-stone" masonry, 6r1poX6tasa, sometimes used to describe walls, is misleading, since all Minoan walls in all periods used some bonding, whether earth, mud, or clay, and this practice is often the sole means of distinguishing them from modern walls.16 In the majority of cases these rubble walls serve only as socles for superstructures of mud brick. There is little direct evidence for such superstructures, but they must be assumed to have existed because of the special care taken to provide proper beddings for them. In many cases, the rubble socles of the tombs are intact and preserve perfectly level surfaces that must have been designed for the laying of horizontal rows of brick. Occasionally, when walls are built on slopes, they are carefully stepped, like those of Mochlos A or Gournia I, in order to minimize the amount of rubble construction and still provide level beddings for the mud-brick superstructures. The mud-brick fragments associated with Mochlos B and Z are important because they are the only traces of mud brick reported from any of the tombs (PI. 37:a). Mud brick usually survives only if baked by fire, and it is significant that Moch- los B is one of the few house tombs where traces of fire have been observed. Were there as 16 Shaw, Minoan Architecture, pp. 77-83. 207</page><page sequence="228">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES many signs of burning in the house tombs as there are in the tholos tombs, more mud-brick fragments might be expected to have survived. In only a few cases do walls appear to have been constructed entirely in stone. Such instances include the walls of Mochlos IV/V/VI and XVI, the lower-story walls of Ar- chanes B, 3, and 19, and a few individual walls such as the party wall of Mochlos IX and X, the southeastern retaining wall of Myrtos, Pyrgos, and perhaps the central partition wall of Gournia I, as well as the walls of certain Neopalatial tombs (Chrysolakkos III at Mallia, Agia Triada 5, the Temple Tomb at Knossos). The walls show a remarkable variety of con- struction. Especially distinctive are those of the tombs at Mochlos that are built with large slabs, set on end at the base of the wall and filled out above and between with flat stones laid more or less horizontally. These slabs are quite large, often a meter in length or width. They come from local deposits of purple or green schist as well as a silver-gray sideropetra and are extracted along even lines of fracture; as a result they have a flat, smooth surface that gives them a finished appearance. They are used decoratively, often with different colors alternat- ing in the same wall, and only in the important faces of these walls. With the exception of the north wall of IV/V/VI, which is reinforced with a separate foundation, such slabs are used in all the walls that are entirely rock built, as if it was thought necessary to build such walls with especially strong bases. They also appear in a few other walls, where, however, they are seldom as massive as those in the rock-built walls. They are used in some South Slope tombs, as well as the West Terrace tombs, but never so extensively as in I and IV, rooms that probably had special functions in the West Terrace tombs and perhaps in the cemetery as a whole. It is noteworthy that the contemporary houses at Mochlos exposed in Block A are built of ordinary rubble, without the same care that went into the construction of the tomb walls, and no precise parallels may be cited for the early walls with their large base slabs.17 They are the first, however, of varying types of dadoes that grow increasingly popular with Minoan builders for their monumental effect and foreshadow the orthostate blocks used at Chrysolakkos II and in MM Ib palatial architecture. The walls of Archanes B and 3 illustrate another distinctive method of construction. The stones in these walls are roughly squared and laid in fairly regular courses filled in with vertical and horizontal layers of stone chips. They have parallels in near-by MM Ia walls at Knossos,18 and the fragment of "ashlar" wall reported on the Gravel Ridge at Palaikastro (see No. 36, p. 192 above) may belong to the same type. True ashlar masonry, which seems to be restricted to palatial structures when it appears in the Protopalatial period, is not found in funerary architecture until the Neopalatial period, when it appears in such tombs as Chrysolakkos III and the Temple Tomb. The walls of stone construction, when complete, provide the only available information on the original height of the tombs. The preserved heights are similar and probably repre- sentative. The north wall of Mochlos VI measures ca. 1.93 m. from the top of its inner foundation. The maximum preserved height of the east wall of Mochlos XVI is ca. 2.20 m. 17 See, however, the upright slabs placed in the bottom courses of Bastion 34 at Poliochni, a structure con- temporary with the EM II Mochlos tombs (L. Bernabo-Brea, Poliochni, citta preistorica nell'isola di Lemnos I, Rome 1964, pp. 274-277, figs. 151-153). The later slab in the facade of Archanes 19 is similar but lacks the smooth, almost polished surface of the Mochlos examples. 18 Evans, PM I, pp. 148-149, fig. 109. 208</page><page sequence="229">WALLS above bedrock. The west wall of Archanes B measures nearly two meters to the floor level of the second story in the tomb. The west wall of Archanes 3 also measures about two meters from the original floor level to the break in the wall marking the second-floor level. A height around two meters is the average and suggests that the tombs with stone walls were built about as high as other contemporary buildings.19 It is, of course, not clear that mud-brick walls rose as high as stone walls, although they certainly rose no higher. The maximum preserved heights of the interior wall of Gournia I and the north central pier of Mochlos XX/XXI are both just under 1.40 meters, and the brick walls of these tombs may not have risen much higher. Few of the tombs, and probably none of those at Mochlos or Gournia, appear to have been more than a single story high, since the width of their lower-story walls is usually not sufficient to support a second story. The only actual evidence for second stories is found at Archanes B and 3, where the levels are actually preserved, at Myrtos, Pyrgos, where the upper floor, supported by a large pillar, seems to have held a shrine, and at the Neopalatial tombs Agia Triada 5 and the Temple Tomb at Knossos, where the upper floors, also partly supported by pillars, also seem to have accommodated shrines. The only other possibility may be Chrysolakkos II with its uniformly wide walls. It may be significant that only this tomb and Archanes B used timber in their walls, and in both cases the timber may have been designed at least in part to provide extra support for an upper story. The height of 2.5 to 3.5 meters that has been estimated for Chrysolakkos II would not, however, be sufficient for a two-story building. The tomb walls are provided with a variety of foundations. In a few cases they rest directly on bedrock. These include the walls of Mochlos IV/V/VI, Archanes B and 3, and other walls built entirely of stone and perhaps thought to require solid beddings because of their great weight. In some cases bedrock was just below surface, but in others, as in the east room of Archanes 5, it required considerable digging to reach. Additional support is some- times provided by a projecting base or plinth designed to fill irregularities in the natural bedrock and provide a level bedding for the erection of the wall. They might be quite simple, consisting of only a single row of stones like those supporting the west wall of Mochlos XXIII and the partition wall of Gournia I, or considerably more substantial, like those supporting the north and east walls of Mochlos VI and the north and th o south walls of Ar- chanes 3. In most cases these plinths are peculiar in that they project only on one side, the inner side if belonging to an outer wall. In a few cases walls may be built upon earlier walls and so gain additional support, like the south wall of the Archanes B pillar crypt and some of the interior walls of Chrysolakkos II, or they may be built on a shallow footing of rubble construction, like the exterior walls of Chrysolakkos II. In most cases, however, the bedding of walls appears to have been somewhat haphazard. Some walls might rest on bedrock, while others in the same tomb rest on the natural ground level or an earth fill, occasionally with the addition of a few loose stones. This seems to have been the case with most of the tombs that have survived on the South Slope at Mochlos. In still other cases no part of a 19 Compare the heights of Room 76 at Myrtos (Warren, Myrtos, p. 66) and Room IL at Phaistos (D. Levi, "Attivita della Scuola Archeologica Italiana di Atene nell'anno 1951," BdA, 1952, pp. 320-339, fig. 7), each ca. 2 m. 209</page><page sequence="230">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES tomb might rest on bedrock. Even when bedrock might lie only a few centimeters beneath the walls, as at Mochlos III or Gournia II, no effort was made to carry the stone socles down to that level. The same sort of haphazard building may be noted in the construction of other Minoan walls where solid bedding was provided when thought necessary or when conve- nient, but a less substantial bedding was thought sufficient for the relatively light walls built of mud brick above rubble socles.20 Normally a sall one-story tomb did not require any substantial bedding, and the natural ground level would be sufficient, particularly if the tomb rested on level ground, as at Agios Georgios; on the other hand, more of the South Slope tombs on Mochlos would have survived if they had been built on bedrock instead of the natural slope. Occasionally some attempt was made to decorate the external faces of the tomb walls. One of the most common means was the use of vertical setbacks or recesses such as those built into the walls of Mochlos IV/V/VI, Archanes 6, Palaikastro III, Gournes, Gournia II, and Archanes 3 and 5. In the earliest of these, at Mochlos and Palaikastro, the setbacks seem to be the result of the addition of rooms to the original structure. The walls of the additions are simply set back (or forward) where they join the original walls. At Archanes 5 and 6 and Gournes setbacks are created by the same means and also mark actual breaks in the walls. At Archanes 3 and Gournia II a second type is introduced in which the wall is not structurally broken at the point of setback, but instead the internal structure of the tomb is reflected by the external setback. Here the setback has become chiefly a matter of design, no longer a primarily structural feature, and serves to break the monotony of a solid wall. In Archanes 3 the process is carried somewhat further, and the setbacks in the north and south walls of the tomb, while still reflecting the internal arrangement of the tomb, are less pro- nounced and primarily decorative. The setback seems to have originated then as a result of structural additions, but because of its decorative effect soon became a common adornment of Minoan walls.21 Still other techniques were used to decorate the facades of Mochlos IV/V/VI, Archanes B, and Chrysolakkos II. Once constructed, the walls of these tombs were underlined, as it were, by string courses, separate from the walls, placed at the bases for adornment. At Mochlos this course consists of a separate line of horizontal slabs, set between wall and terrace. At Archanes and Chrysolakkos the courses consist of a number of slabs set vertically against the bases of the walls. ORGANIC ARCHITECTURE As a rule, the tombs are set harmoniously in the landscape. They are oriented according to the slope of the terrain and are often tucked into its natural contours. At the same time, natural topographical features are often incorporated into the construction with the result that the tombs appear to be part of their natural surroundings. In this accommodation of the 20 Graham, Palaces of Crete, pp. 149-150. 21 For setbacks in domestic architecture, see the notes in Demargne and Gallet de Santerre, Mallia, Mai- sons I, p. 43, note 1; J.

It is a type of architecture that is particularly well illustrated by the tombs at Mochlos, where several techniques are used to achieve the integration, but it is also characteristic of much early Minoan building. One technique is the use of natural crevices for floors and the positioning of rooms over them, so that burial deposits can accumulate without hindering access to the rooms. Both Mochlos II and VI are constructed in such a way, as are many peak sanctu- aries, where, however, it is votives and burnt offerings that accumulate in the natural rock crevices. Related is the use of natural ledges in the rock like those in Mochlos A, F, and III to form extensions of the tomb. In each example the natural features of the ground become an integral part of the building. Another method is the use of a natural outcropping as a "cornerstone" of two walls, as at the southwest corners of Mochlos A and XI or the south- east corner of Mochlos XIII, in order to ensure the bonding between walls. Often a rise in bedrock will form the base of an entire wall, serving as the socle for mud-brick or stone walling. In each case, the living rock projects into the manmade wall, and the two become part of each other. Sometimes this practice is carried still further, and the rise in the rock cliff, where high and steep enough, is used to form one entire side of the tomb or more. Such use is made of the rock cliffs along the west sides of Mochlos I/II/III, the north sides of Mochlos A, XX/XXI, and XXII, and the east sides of Mochlos X and XV. The wall ledge may be partially built where it is necessary to fill irregularities in the rock face, as at the southeast corner of Mochlos XX/XXI, or to provide additional support for the roof, as at the north side of the same tomb, but often it is left untouched. This transformation of living rock into walls is found in other tombs such as Gournia III, Zakros A, and Porti 8 and in Prepalatial domestic architecture at Myrtos, Debla, and particulartialy Elenes, Amariou, where one house is reported to have had an entire wall of living rock.22 In this sort of archi- tecture the buildings seem to grow out of the ground, and it is often difficult to tell where the ground ends and the buildings begin. It is an economical method of building, requiring relatively little labor and a minimum of building materials, and it is also sound engineering, ensuring a solid structure. At the same time, the integration of natural topographical fea- tures and manmade materials is so common a feature of early Minoan architecture that it constitutes an important aspect of the architectural aesthetic of the period. DOORWAYS (Fig. 80) Doorways are found in a majority of, but by no means all, the tombs. Unlike the trilithon doorways of tholos tombs, they are constructed in ordinary rubble fashion, that is, with built jambs that presumably supported lintels of wood. They range in width from half a meter to a meter; the preserved height of the doorway from Mochlos IV to VI is ca. 1.73 m. Or- dinarily doorways are a simple break either in the middle of a wall, with the two ends of the wall forming the jambs (Mochlos XX/XXI), or at one end of a wall, with the wall running at right angles to the broken wall forming one of the jambs (Mochlos A, Gournia II). The position of the doorway varies, and there is no indication that one position was preferred 22 Warren, Myrtos, p. 257; Warren and Tzedakis, BSA 69, 1974, p. 335; Karo (footnote 15 above, p. 206), p. 177. 211</page><page sequence="232">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES A D 1OL1 B E C FIG. 80. Plans of tomb doorway types over the others. Often the ends of the walls forming the jambs appear to have been strength- ened: they are sometimes widened like those at Mochlos A and Gournia II (Fig. 80:D), or they might be built with large stones laid more carefully than usual, like the north jamb at the bottom of the staircase in Archanes 3, which is actually built in rough headers and stretchers. Usually the break in the wall is complete; a separate stone threshold like the flat slabs in Mochlos IV and XXIII may be provided, but more often a simple earth threshold, sometimes reinforced with stone chips as at Gournia II, sufficed. Sometimes, however, the wall is continuous at the base and only broken somewhere above to provide a doorway. In such cases the doorway may be located 0.20 m. to as much as 0.80 m. above floor level, and its threshold is composed of the rubble base of the wall itself. Such doorways are found between Mochlos IV and VI, in the lower-story rooms of Archanes 3, and in the houses at Vasilike and Myrtos. At Mochlos short projecting piers instead of the ends of walls are often used to form the jambs. They may be placed in a variety of positions but always in such a way as to form a I . O 1 2m. 212 L</page><page sequence="233">ROOFING small alcove or sheltered area in front of the doorway. Usually they stand between two parallel walls, narrowing the space for the door opening (Mochlos I, IV, IX; Fig. 80:C), or opposite the end of a wall, against a wall running at right angles to the doorway (Moch- los B; Fig. 80:B), or outside a doorway, flanking it and serving not as jambs but as pure dec- oration (Mochlos XXIII; Fig. 80:A). In most cases such piers are built in ordinary rubble and simply attached to the walls without bonding. The piers at the entrances of Mochlos I are unusual in being composed of monoliths, at least at the bases. Most of the doors were presumably constructed of wood. The locking system of the Temple Tomb, requiring wooden bolts, the wooden jambs and bronze pivot cap of Chryso- lakkos II, and the stone pivots of Gournia II and Mochlos Z suggest wooden doors, and while no direct evidence is available for other tombs, wooden doors revolving on wooden door posts set in rough pivot stones might be expected. Rarely, a rubble wall like that in the doorway between Mochlos IV and VI might be used to close a doorway, presumably when the room behind the doorway had gone out of use. Monolithic slabs are also reported by Seager to have closed the entrances of Mochlos III, IV, V, and XII. They are no longer visible on the site, and it is unclear exactly how they were used. If they blocked the entire doorway, they must have been quite large, perhaps resembling some of the monolithic slabs used in the tholos tombs.23 The use of such slabs is exceptional, however, and is clearly a feature of funerary rather than domestic architecture. They are used somewhat incongru- ously together with architectural forms such as stone thresholds and built jambs that are normally associated with wooden doors and may have been introduced only at the time the tombs were finally closed. A few of the tombs are not provided with any apparent entrance. Because walls are often preserved only to a low level and doorways are sometimes placed at the level of the stone socle without breaking the wall, it cannot always be assumed that doorways did not exist: they may have existed but are simply no longer visible. Sometimes an additional wall at one corner or end of a room, like that in Gournia I, built to the same height as the external wall it joins, may have served as an entry platform providing landings for doorways placed above ground level and no longer visible (Fig. 80:E). In still other cases where the walls are preserved to a considerable height without door openings or where the tomb is divided into numerous small rooms, it is clear that the tomb was entered from the roof, probably through a trap door, as rooms frequently were in domestic architecture.24 At Mochlos and many other sites the roofs could be reached easily without ladders since the tombs are located against a steep rise in ground level. ROOFING Direct evidence for the roofing of the tombs, that is, actual remains of roofing material, is slight, a fact that has prompted several scholars to conclude that many, if not all, tombs were unroofed.25 Seager, for example, argued that while the West Terrace tombs at Mochlos, 23 See the closing slab from the Kamilari tholos, which is ca. 1.30 m. high (Levi, ASAtene 23-24, 1961- 1962, p. 13, fig. 17). 24 Warren, Myrtos, p. 258. 25 See Preface, p. vi above. 213</page><page sequence="234">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES where he found remains of roofing material, were roofed, the South Slope tombs, where he believed he found no such remains, were not. In fact, the Mochlos cemetery provides more evidence of roofing, direct and indirect, than Seagerrealized. The direct evidence consists of the "pieces of white plaster, smooth on one side and showing the impress of reeds on the other" that Seager found behind Mochlos IV and identified as part of the original roofing of the tomb, which collapsed sometime after the last EM III burials were made and before the tomb was re-used in the MM III phase.26 In addition, a "filling of sticky white clay" foreign to the island was found in all the tombs that Seager excavated on the South Slope. At the time of the excavation, the clay was identified as the same material that the workmen used to waterproof the flat roofs of their own houses.27 In 1971 a fairly large quantity of asbestos was found with the EM IIb/III deposit behind the collapsed east wall of Mochlos VI, and in 1976 still more was found in the northwest corner of Mochlos r. This is probably the same sticky white clay reported by Seager, for although it has a sandy texture when dry, it becomes sticky when damp or wet and was once again identified by the workmen as the substance used locally to waterproof roofs (and whitewash walls). It is not available on the island but is currently mined in great quantities in a mountain on Crete directly across from it.28 The same material is reported from Archanes 3, where it was mixed with pebbles (XaXLKacp-reoTov) and was apparently used as a flooring in the second story or as a sealing in the stone roof of the tomb.29 In the Mochlos tombs it may also have been used as a sealing or may represent the decomposed roofing itself. A similar method of roofing, perhaps using a different sealing, is reported at Platanos a and y, where lumps of clay were found with impressions of reeds.30 Considerable indirect evidence for the existence of roofing is also to be found in the South Slope tombs on Mochlos, especially Mochlos X, XX/XXI, and XXIII, which were each provided with special features to support a roof. These include the two piers of stone in Mochlos XX/XXI, one built against the rock face at the north end of the mud-brick di- viding wall, the other resting on a natural ledge in the rock face at the northwest corner; the pier of stones in Mochlos X that rests on a ledge at the north end of the tomb; and the two sections of walling in Mochlos XXIII that rest on natural ledges in the rock at the north side. In each case these built additions to the rock walls of the tombs were designed to pro- vide vertical support for horizontal timbers in the roofs. At Zakros A the apparent cutting in the rock face at the northwest corner of the tomb, which continues the line of the north wall, probably served a similar function as a support for an important ceiling beam. In addition, the presence of doorways, often internal and external and occasionally with closing slabs in place, the disposition of walls in such a way that no room is too large to be spanned, and occasional embellishments, such as fixed furniture or plastered floors and walls, all provide good indirect evidence for the existence of roofs in the house tombs. The remains from the EM II and MM I tombs at Mochlos and Platanos probably represent the most common form of roofing in all the tombs: clay or lime plaster laid on a 26 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 46. 27 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 16; and see Shaw, Minoan Architecture, p. 225. 28 M.

Such a method of roofing was the most common type in Prepalatial domestic architecture. It is reported from Vasilike using clay and from Myrtos using lime plaster,31 and there is evidence that this simple method of roofing persisted into the Neopalatial period.32 It is not the only type of roofing used in the house tombs, however, and remains of two other types, one using large stone slabs and the other a combination of timber supports and stone paving, have been found at Chrysolakkos, Archanes, and the Temple Tomb. A large stone slab uncovered in Chrysolakkos II and clearly fallen from above was identified as a roofing slab by the excavators.33 Its dimensions were not recorded, and it is unclear exactly how it might have been set in the roof or indeed if there were other such slabs. At Archanes B, however, similar slabs may still be observed in situ. They consist of large, limestone slabs obtained by surface quarrying from the local hillside and measuring over two meters in length and nearly one meter in width. Two methods are used for the placing of these slabs. In the north antechamber of the tholos the upper portions of the walls are corbeled inward slightly to reduce the span of the roof, and in the dromos leading to the tholos the walls have been set back at top leaving a narrow ledge on each side on which the covering slabs rest.34 At Knossos, the gallery leading across from the upper entrance to the Temple Tomb to the roof of the terrace pavilion displays a similar roofing system with limestone slabs measuring as much as ca. 1.30 by 0.50 by 0.30 m. resting on the two side walls of the gallery.35 This roofing techniqe is especially well suited to tombs divided into many small cells. While the length of the slabs at Archanes is sufficient to span the ceilings of many of the house tombs, their great weight requires either thick and heavy walls for support, quite unlike the modest walls of most tombs, or else a small, limited area to cover, like a tomb cell. It is therefore unlikely that this method was used in many of the other tombs. It would also seem not to be a common form of roofing in domestic architecture, in which even lintels were customarily wood, and, as Demargne has pointed out, it has its closest parallel in the roofing of cist graves.36 The third method of roofing, using a combination of timber supports and stone slabs, is found at the Temple Tomb and perhaps at Archanes B and 3, where schist plaques were found fallen from above. Evidence for the technique is preserved most clearly in the Temple Tomb. Here, sockets for the support of large wooden beams were left in the pashla tr masonry in the upper part of the walls of both the inner hall and the pillar crypt. These beams were 0.40-0.50 m. square and ca. 2.50 m. long in the inner hall and the crypt, where one end of each beam rested on each of the pillars midway across the room. In the pillar crypt they supported the transverse beams of the floor above with its schist paving slabs. At Archanes B and 3 a similar system appears to have been used, with more modest timbers supporting 31 Seager, Vasilike I, p. 209; Warren, Myrtos, pp. 258-259, pl. 82. 32 Graham, Palaces of Crete, p. 149; J.

The interstices between these slabs were generally filled with a waterproof plaster, and Evans believed that in some cases the entire pavement was covered with such plaster.38 STUCCO REVETMENT AND PAINTED DECORATION Stucco revetment, which is found in a few of the tombs, is used in Minoan architecture from the beginning of the Bronze Age. In the EM I phase red stucco is used as a floor covering in- side houses, and in the following EM II phase it is used extensively on floors and walls as revetment and at Vasilike structurally as an outer cement solidifying the interiors of the rubble walls.39 In the EM III/MM Ia phases stucco becomes especially fashionable and is used both as revetment for every interior architectural detail, including floors, walls, benches, stairs, and ceilings, and as a building material forming bins, fixed hearths, and even walls.40 It is at this time that stucco first appears to have been used in tombs. It is found first at Chrysolakkos I, where it is used nearly as extensively as in domestic architecture, as a flooring in Rooms a, e, f, g, and k, as revetment for the capping stones of the west precinct wall, and as cement solidifying the largely earth walls and benches of the building. In other MM Ia tombs stucco was employed with considerably more restraint. It is used as revetment for the low bench along the south wall of Gournia I, concealing its haphazard construction, partly built and partly bedrock. It was also used in the South Building at Agia Triada as flooring in Rooms 5 and 9, the stucco flooring in Room 5 consisting of three different layers above an original floor of stone slabs, and in the House of the Dead at Mallia in Room III as flooring over earth and bedrock and as revetment on the walls of the room. During this time, at the close of th e Prepalatial perio, white stucco appears to have been introduced and quickly become as popular as red. It is still not the fine white plaster, consist- ing of practically pure carbonate of lime, that seems to have been introduced at the time of the first palaces, but has a yellowish hue.41 Nevertheless, its introduction is probably due to the same factor that led to the perfection of a brilliant white plaster in the Protopalatial period, namely the desire to provide a surface suitable for decorative treatment. The first attempts at such decorative treatment are well illustrated in the House of the Dead at Mallia: along the base of the west wall of Room III a thin band of red was painted against the yellowish white ground. It is a type of simple geometric decoration that enjoys a long vogue at Mallia and is 37 Compare the beam sockets in the rubble walls at Phaistos, Rooms XXVII, IL, L, LI, LIV (Zois, 'ApX'EP 1965, pp. 40-46, pls. 6, 7). 38 See the evidence from Phaistos, where pavement slabs from a second-story level were uncovered with stucco still adhering to their edges: D.

In each example the walls of the upper rooms were adorned with frescos in rich colors. The most decorative fragments, found in the pillar crypt of Archanes B but apparently fallen from the upper columnar room, included naturalistic designs. Sakellarakis has reported fragments with white stones on red ground and others with dark papyruslike leaves on orange ground that he believes to have belonged to a larger composition with human figures. Fragments of a fresco were also preserved in the upper columnar room of the Temple Tomb, where plaster painted a Venetian red was still adher- ing to the base of the walls, and Evans' conjecture that "a frieze of more varied character" ran above this level does not seem far fetched in the light of the evidence from Archanes.45 PILLARS While not found in the tombs at Mochlos or Gournia, pillars are present at four of the other sites: Myrtos, Pyrgos, Archanes B, Agia Triada 5, and the Temple Tomb. They are found in at least one tholos annex, at Apesokari, which is contemporary with the earlier of these and in two late chamber tombs.46 With the exception of the rock-cut pillars of the chamber tombs, the tomb pillars are constructed in the same manner as those in domestic architecture and appear to have served the same structural function: as supports for ceiling beams and, in some cases, for columns in upper floors.47 Most of the pillars, including those at Archanes B, Apesokari, and Agia Triada 5, are constructed of several stacked blocks, roughly shaped, alternating with thin layers of earth and small stones. Of these examples only the pillar at Archanes is completely preserved, consisting of six such blocks and standing to a height of ca. 1.60 m. The Myrtos pillar, which is preserved only at the base, is constructed somewhat more crudely, of rough rubble masonry and probably with mud brick or more rubble above. Only the pillars of the Temple Tomb use true ashlar construction: in the outer pillar crypt, each is constructed of five carefully cut blocks, with only a minimum of clay bonding, stand- ing about two meters high, while in the inner sepulchral chamber the pillar consists of a 42 Demargne and Gallet de Santerre, Mallia, Maisons I, p. 12; for Neopalatial frescos at Mallia, see 0.

The topmost blocks of the pillars in the outer pil- lar crypt are cut with dowel holes, and the pillars are aligned with beam sockets in the north and south walls, so that it is clear that they supported large cross beams in the floor above. The discovery of a gypsum column base belonging to this floor indicates that the pillars also supported wooden columns in the room above. At Archanes B, where the pillar rises to the level of the second-story floor, at Myrtos, where a large number of vases were fallen from the floor above, and at Agia Triada 5, where an adjacent U-shaped staircase appears to have led to a room above the crypt, it is clear that the pillars also helped support a second-story floor.48 Like the pillars in the Temple Tomb they may also have been designed to support columns in the upper rooms snce, as in Platon has argued in the case of the domestic crypts, the rooms could be spanned easily without the aid of additional floor supports at their centers. In this respect it may be significant that each of the upper-story rooms appears from the material fallen below to have accommodated a shrine, and although no other column bases are preserved these shrines may well have been columnar shrines like that in the upper floor of the Temple Tomb. The tomb pillars and their crypts share a number of additional features that relate them directly to the pillar crypts of Neopalatial domestic architecture. The tomb crypts tend to be small in size. Those at Archanes B and Apesokari are each ca. 3.50 m. square,49 and while these dimensions are never exactly repeated in the later crypts, they are approached in the inner sepulchral chamber of the Temple Tomb, which is ca. 3.80 m. square, in the crypt of the Southeast House at Knossos, which is ca. 3.15 by 3.65 m., and in several other domestic crypts. The tomb crypts never stand alone but are always surrounded by three or more related rooms. Those at Archanes B and Apesokari are again especially similar and include in each case a forehall, a corridor to one side of the crypt, and an antechamber (in one case leading to the tholos, in the other to the room above the crypt). Platon has noted that domes- tic crypts are also surrounded by important subsidiary rooms, which he has identified as forehall, treasury or storeroom, sacristy, and upper columnar room. In two cases, at Myrtos, Pyrgos and Archanes B, the crypts are also sunk in the ground, below the floor level of the surrounding rooms, and this is still another characteristic feature of the domestic crypts. The niches in the walls of the crypts at Archanes B and Apesokari also have parallels in the domestic crypts, where they are thought to have served as cupboards. The tomb crypt that shares the greatest number of features with domestic crypts, how- ever, is the inner sepulchral chamber of the Temple Tomb. The pillar in this room stands ca. 1.80 m. high, a standard height in Neopalatial pillar crypts. Its beveled edges recall those of the pillars in the north pillar crypt of Knossos;50 the basin in which it stands recalls those around the bases of several pillars that Platon has identified as impluvia for libations; the cist in the floor to one side of the room is like those found in many of the subsidiary rooms of the domestic crypts; and the blue kyanos used to paint the ceiling is used for the pillar itself 48 The outer of the double walls of Apesokari I could also have supported a second-story wall of mud brick, with the floor beams resting on the inner section of the walls and the interior partition walls. 49 For the domestic crypts and their characteristic features, see Platon, KprrXpov 8, 1954, pp. 463-471 and Gesell, Town, Palace and House Cult, pp. 26-29. 50 Evans, PM I, p. 401. 218</page><page sequence="239">FIXED ALTARS in the crypt of Zakros House A.51 Only the double axes that one might expect incised on the pillar are missing.52 FIXED ALTARS An altar can be securely identified by the finds associated with it, the remains of sacrifices or votive offerings, but when such finds are lacking an altar may still be identified with some assurance by its form and position.53 Some nine fixed altars have been identified at seven of the house tombs. In addition to those at Mochlos IV/V/VI and Gournia II, there are two examples at Chrysolakkos I, one in the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres, one at Myrtos, Pyrgos, one at Palaikastro VIII, and two at Chrysolakkos II. Only the altar at Mochlos with its fragmentary stone vases and that at Gournia with its conical-cup fragment preserve any traces of associated votive offerings. Five of the altars are identified on the basis of their form and position, and two, no longer in situ, on the basis of their form alone. In addition to these altars, four fixed altars have been identified by their excavators at the tholos tombs at Apeso- kari, Kamilari, and Agia Kyriaki.54 Those at Apesokari and Kamilari are especially impor- tant, for they are securely identified on the basis of associated votive offerings, both stone and clay vases, and demonstrate that fixed altars should not be unexpected in funerary contexts. Two types of fixed altars are represented: seven built altars of stone or stucco and six stone offering tables or kernoi. In four cases, at Chrysolakkos I and II, Gournia, and Myr- tos, the two types are associated in a single complex, and while the built altars sometimes stand alone, no kernos found in situ at any of the tombs stood apart from a built altar. This sort of compound altar, consisting of a raised platform and juxtaposed offering receptacle, is a distinct type of altar complex that persists in Crete to the very end of the Bronze Age. The most famous example, of course, is the complex with bench and fixed kernos that stands by the south entrance to the central court of the palace at Mallia. It is unusual in that it belongs to the Neopalatial period, a time when the kernos has usually been replaced by a portable tripod altar. But the type is so common that it may be safely identified as an altar complex even when the offerings no longer remain. The location of the altars is also helpful in their identification. In the majority of cases, at Mochlos, Chrysolakkos I, Myrtos, Gournia II, Palaikastro VIII, as well as Agia Kyriaki, Apesokari, and Kamilari, the altar stands outside the tomb at or near its entrance. Only two examples, those at Chrysolakkos II and Apeso- kari, are located inside the tomb, but again probably at or near the entrance. The location at entrances or along passages of access is significant and, as Fernand Chapouthier observed, is also characteristic of other types of shrines, particularly in the palaces.55 The built altars are constructed in a variety of fashions. Some are neatly constructed in rubble with earth mortar, often paved with flat slabs on top; some consist of flagstones, often 51 Hogarth (footnote 195 above, p. 195), p. 130, Room 4; blue is also used for the ceiling of Katsamba Tomb H (Alexiou, Karo-ra,ra, pp. 35-36). 52 These are cut on the walls of the outer pillar crypt. 53 For a discussion of the problem, see Nilsson, MMR2, pp. 117-119. 54 Schorgendorfer, Forschungen auf Kreta, pp. 19-21, pls. 16, 17:4; Levi, ASAtene 39-40, 1961-1962, pp. 80-83, fig. 106; Blackman and Branigan, BSA 77, 1982, pp. 9-10, 54, fig. 15. 55 Chapouthier, BCH 52, 1928, pp. 320-322; Pelon, Mallia, Maisons III, p. 146. 219</page><page sequence="240">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES roughly joined, without any great height; others are basically rock altars and only partly masonry, if at all; and those in a fourth group are built of stucco, often stucco revetment over earth or clay. They vary in height, depending on the method of construction, from only a few centimeters to nearly a meter; most approach one meter square. There does not seem to be any chronological significance in the different building techniques, and each type has a good parallel in a non-funerary, if not always contemporary, context. The Mochlos altar is the earliest; it is also the largest and most carefully built. While it has contemporary parallels in the settlement at Myrtos and probably outside the tholos tomb at Agia Kyriaki, its closest parallel in form is probably the MM Ia altar in the peak sanctuary on Mount Juktas. Both structures are built in rubble, paved on top with flat slabs, and provided with steps. The Juktas altar, measuring ca. 4.70 m. in length, is much larger but about the same height as the Mochlos altar. Its excavator notes that it "constitutes the crown of the terraces (in the sanctuary), and marks the end of the ascending ceremonial way,"56 and in this regard it is also similar to the Mochlos altar that stands at the end of the West Terrace, which was probably also used for ceremonial processions. The large flat flagstone noted outside the entrance to Palaikastro VIII may also be identified as an altar, although its identification is the most dubious of all, partly because so little information about it is available. It has good parallels, however, in the three flagstone altars found outside the tholos tombs at Agia Kyriaki and Kamilari and just inside the entrance at Apesokari, the last two with offerings or cult statue still in place. The EM II altar at Myr- tos with its fallen cult idol also preserves a good parallel for this type, for although it was described as a "bench altar" by its excavator, the three or four flat stones from which it was built were not built upon and have little height.57 The rock altar at Gournia II also has a good parallel at Apesokari in the rock altar located outside the tomb; it is even about the same size as the Gournia altar. They are built in a similar fashion and differ from other built altars in being constructed primarily of one or two large boulders with only a subsid- iary wall of rubble. Rock altars have been reported in the caves at Psychro and Skoteino,58 but the best parallel for the rock altars of Gournia II and Apesokari is that pictured in relief on a rhyton fragment from Knossos.59 The scene shows a man placing an offering in a basket on a a rock altar in front of a peak sanctuary. Like those at Gournia and Apesokari, the pictured altar stands in the open air to one side of the entrance to the sanctuary and is built of a large boulder with smaller stones at the base. While the rhyton was manufactured in the Neopalatial period, peak sanctuaries were founded at the end of the Prepalatial period, and the altar depicted, if real, could even be contemporary with the tomb altars. The stucco altars of Chrysolakkos I and II are the product of the taste for stucco revet- ment that became fashionable at Mallia at the end of the Prepalatial period and continued throughout the Protopalatial period, resulting in the stuccoing of floors, walls, and ceilings as well as benches and altars. The altars of Chrysolakkos I should probably be classed with 56 A. Karetsou, "The Peak Sanctuary of Mount Juktas," in Sanctuaries and Cults in the Aegean Bronze Age, R. Hagg and N.

AA, AE. 220</page><page sequence="241">FIXED ALTARS the bench altars that later become so popular in the palace shrines; they are about the ousame height as many of the bench altars and are also built against walls.60 Of course, a bench need not necessarily serve as an altar, and most of the benches in Chrysolakkos I, like those in the South Building at Agia Triada, served as simple seats for people gathered in the buildings for funerary ceremonies. On the other hand, an ordinary bench becomes an altar when votive offerings are placed on top of it or an offering receptacle is placed in front of it. Struc- ture b at Chrysolakkos I and the bench at Myrtos, Pyrgos, may well have served as altars because of the kernoi located near by; similar arrangements with stuccoed and unstuccoed benches and juxtaposed offering receptacles are found in Prepalatial and Protopalatial shrines at Gournia, Phaistos, and Mallia.61 In addition, a bench might be identified as an altar on occasion because of special decorative features. The raised molding and the rounded corner of Structure b have close parallels with the portable offering tables of the period.62 In addition, the sandstone revetments of this structure and that standing at the entrance to the west terrace seem to be a feature of other stucco altars at Mallia, such as that in the early sanctuary southwest of the palace encased on two sides with sandstone blocks topped with single horns of consecration.63 The stucco altar of Chrysolakkos II is unique. A stone liba- tion table with similar serrated edges from Palaikastro, belonging to the Neopalatial period, is still the best parallel for the shape.64 Ajar located in the contemporary sanctuary west of the palace at Mallia is thought to have served a similar function.65 Located at the entrance to the sanctuary room and buried in the floor up to its handles, it appeared to have an open- ing at the base and was identified as a libation jar the s at would permit liquid offerings to flow into the ground. The fixed stone offering table or kernos has by far the most parallels in non-funerary settings and in the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods is a ubiquitous feature of Minoan civilization.66 Well over a hundred examples may be counted at the settlements of Myrtos, Vasilike, Gournia, Mochlos, Mallia, Knossos, and Phaistos; seven have been noted above with the tombs at Gournia, Myrtos, Pyrgos, Chrysolakkos, and the Necropoles des Pierres Meulieres; and two more have been uncovered at the peak sanctuary on top of Mount Juktas. The one associated with the hollow altar at Chrysolakkos II is plaster; all the rest consist of a stone slab, irregular, rectangular, or rounded in shape, usually flat. The type of stone varies widely, but at Mallia, Mochlos, and Gournia sideropetra was favored. The upper surface, usually polished or worn smooth, is marked with a series of small circular 60 For these see Banti, ASAtene 3-5, 1941-1943, pp. 40-50. 61 Soles, AJA 83, 1979, pp. 152-154, ills. 1, 2; Poursat, BCH 90, 1966, pp. 514-551, fig. 3; L.

They may be shallow hollows cut in the stone or depressions of irregular shape and often insignificant depth formed by the repeated blows of a hammerstone. They vary in size, with diameters ranging from as little as half a centimeter to as much as eight centi- meters, and occasionally one, either inside the ring or set to one side of it, is marked out from the rest by its greater size and more careful working. In one case the hollows are cut so close to each other as to form a continuous groove, and in a few others a single groove is employed in place of hollows. In the majority of cases the hollows are placed in a circular or oval ring, but many variations exist. Occasionally the line of hollows follows the edge of the stone slab, and the ring takes on the irregular outline of the stone itself. Often the line of hollows is the e product of the creator's imagination: it may be square, horseshoe-shaped, foot-shaped, oblong, or crescent-shaped. In several, an extra line of hollows is added to the basic design, either down the center of a circle or square, dividing it into two parts, or as an inner circle within the outer circle or an inner square within the outer square. In others, two rings are placed side by side or sometimes overlap, forming interlocking rings. The number of hollows in the ring varies, with as few recorded as nine or as many as one hundred in cases where the inside of the pattern is filled with hollows. Both 12 and 13 are recurring numbers in a large percen- tage of them, especially at Phaistos, and may be intentional. The dimensions of the ring vary in proportion to the number of hollows, with some as small as 0.10 m. in diameter and others up to nine times as large. In many of the stones a cavity is located inside the ring of hollows. It is usually larger than any of the hollows, measuring from 0.06 to 0.40 m. in diameter, and like the ring itself may be round, oval, square, oblong, or crescent-shaped. Occasionally, only the central cavity is cut, and the surrounding hollows are omitted altogether. In a few, the cavity is clearly the result of repeated grinding or pounding, and at least two of the kernoi from Myrtos, found with numerous stone pounders and grinding stones, should be identified as grinding stones.67 Others of the stones may have had the same primary function. Most remarkable is the uniformity in the placement of these slabs, whatever their con- text. They are usually imbedded in pavements, either flush or projecting slightly above, and are only rarely set alone as at Gournia II. The position of the slabs in nearly every case is either at an entrance to a room or building or along a passage or street. This category in- cludes those stones found in the west courts of Vasilike, Phaistos, and Mallia, which may be considered courts of access, and it also includes those on the steps of the "theatral areas" at Knossos and Phaistos, which should be considered monumental entrances to the early pal- aces at these sites. The identification of these stones as altars or offering receptacles has long been debated, but the find of two stones in a clear cult context at the peak sanctuary on Mount Juktas, one built into the side of the stepped altar, the other deposited with a cache of double axes in a pit a short distance south of the altar,68 and the examples from tombs, sometimes found in juxtaposition with built altars, provide ample evidence for the ritual use of these stones and 67 Warren, Myrtos, p. 231, nos. 167 and 169, pi. 78. 68 Karetsou (footnote 56 above, p. 220), pp. 145-146, fig. 13; and Karetsou, HpaKrLKa 1974, p. 233, pi. 173:B. 222</page><page sequence="243">PRECINCT WALLS AND PAVEMENTS should put an end to the debate over their identification. Chapouthier first identified them as kernoi,69 and his comparison of the stones with their circular patterns of shallow hollows to terracotta ring vases, to circles of conical cups, and to stone vases of similar shape is still valid. The stones were designed to serve as receptacles for offerings, if only token offerings. The identification as grinding stones of some of the earliest examples, which Warren has described as the prototypes, suggests that the offerings were food offerings, perhaps offer- ings of the very grain that had been ground on the stone. The consistency of their location at entrances and along passages may also indicate, as Chapouthier suggested, that the offer- ings were apotropaic in nature. PRECINCT WALLS AND PAVEMENTS Areas outside tombs are often delineated by walls or pavements, and are reserved in this way for some special function. Such areas have been identified at Mochlos III and IV/V/VI, Chrysolakkos I, Myrtos, Pyrgos, Archanes 6 and B in the Prepalatial period, at Chrysolakkos II in the Old Palace period, and at the Temple Tomb, Agia Triada 5, and Archanes 4 in the New Palace period. They are also common in the Prepalatial period at the tholos tombs in southern Crete and have been identified at Agia Triada, Agia Kyriaki, Koumasa, Platanos, Apesokari II, and Kamilari.70 In the case of the house tombs, most of these areas are small, carefully defined, and associated with one particular tomb. In the earlier examples the areas are bounded and partly defined by independent walls. They might be built retaining walls like those at Ar- chanes B and Myrtos, Pyrgos, in which case they rise well over two meters in height, or they might be mud brick on a stone socle, like those at Mochlos III, Chrysolakkos I, and many of the tholos tombs, in which case they may have been considerably lower. At Mochlos IV/V/VI the solid rock cliff that towers above the tomb on the east serves a similar func- tion. Seldom continuous, these early walls enclose a given area as a result either of the topography, which forms natural boundaries where the wall leaves off, or of being con- structed to one side of an existing wall that delimits the space on the other side. At Mochlos or Myrtos a rectangular area is created by the cliff or wall that rises on one side and the terrain that falls away steeply on the other; at Chrysolakkos I and Archanes B, areas are enclosed by walls that flank the existing tomb walls. While the open areas at these early tombs are an integral part of the tomb, they are not yet a structural part. Only in the Old and New Palace periods are they integrated structurally in such a way that the tomb and open area form a single architectural unit. Porticos are used in each case to achieve this integration, and at the Temple Tomb and apparently Agia Triada 5 the side walls of the tomb are extended before the tomb to create small courts. These open areas are often paved. At Chrysolakkos I and Archanes 6 irregular limestone slabs are used. At Myrtos sandstone predominates, and at Mochlos IV/V/VI different colors and types of stone are combined, apparently intentionally, to create a decorative mosaic. They are early examples of the 69 Chapouthier, BCH 52, 1928, pp. 292-323; see also Pelon, Aegaeum 2, 1988, pp. 42-43. 70 Laviosa, ASAtene 31-32, 1969-1970, pp. 414-415; Blackman and Branigan, BSA 77, 1982, pp. 11, 54, fig. 15; Xanthoudides, VTM, pp. 34, 90; Davaras, AcAr 19, 1964, p. 441; Levi, ASAtene 23-24, 1961-1962, p. 18, fig. 16; and for a discussion of tholos courts, see Branigan, Tombs of Mesara, pp. 132-136. 223</page><page sequence="244">ARCHITECTURAL FEATURES Minoan interest in decorative floor patterns that was to lead to many variations in the New Palace period, including the limestone and schist slabs set off with red plaster at the Temple Tomb. In every case these areas appear to have stood at the entrances to tombs or at the end of processional ways. Open areas, often paved and bounded by precinct walls, are of course a common feature of Minoan architecture, particularly in the New Palace period, when they are thought to have served both a practical function accommodating daily activities and a ceremonial func- tion for games, dances, and other spectacles.71 They are known from other contexts as early as the EM II phase at Vasilike, where the same mosaic effect of differently colored stones may be observed,72 and in the MM Ia phase at Knossos, Phaistos, and numerous peak sanctuaries. The courts at Vasilike and Phaistos with their numerous fixed kernoi,73 the West Court at Knossos with its two fixed altars, and the peak sanctuaries with their open- air altars and tripartite shrines are all sacred areas, and the walls that surround them are temenos walls. The areas in front of the tombs must also have been regarded as sacred areas reserved for ceremonies linked to funerary rite. Evans suggested that the paved court of the Temple Tomb served various funerary rituals, including ring dances and funerary games, and that the roof terraces to the east and west of the court served as stands for spectators.74 The areas in front of other tombs may have served similar functions, but the areas at Moch- los, Myrtos, Pyrgos, and Archanes B, each provided with a paved avenue of approach, sug- gest that they also served as processional areas. There is a striking similarity between the entry to Mochlos IV/V/VI with its ascending ramp, raised terrace for accommodating spectators, and corner stand and the Theatral Area at Knossos where the same three ele- ments, ascending ramp, flanking stand, and corner bastion, set in the same relative posi- tions, are reproduced on a palatial scale. The similarity in form is explained by a similarity in function, and it is clear that Evans regarded the Theatral Area at Knossos not only as an area for dances and games but also as a processional way that provided a monumental and ceremonial entrance to the palace. The huge deposit of pottery uncovered outside Archa- nes B provides a glimpse of the kinds of offerings and libations that were made before the tombs at the end of these processions. ORIGINS OF THE HOUSE TOMB To some extent the origin of the house tomb is to be explained by its very imitation of do- mestic architecture. For even before the appearance of the first tombs in the EM II phase, it had long been the custom of the Minoans to bury their dead in shelters resembling those in which they lived. Throughout most of the Neolithic period, caves were a standard form of habitation, and both caves and rock shelters were used for burials. Thus Pendlebury 71 Graham, Palaces of Crete, pp. 73-83. 72 S.

In one sense the built house tomb is simply a logical extension of this custom, and when Minoans began to abandon caves in favor of built houses, they also realized the possibility of burying their dead in built, houselike structures. The concept of burial in a familiar everyday setting remained unchanged. The transition between these two types of tombs is illustrated by Tombs VII and I at Mochlos, which are a combination of the two, consisting of rock shelter or cave in the rear and built house with doorway in the front. They represent a primitive and transitional type of house like the Magasa rock-shelter house, but they also demonstrate the way in which the house tomb, if not the house itself, may have evolved from cave or rock shelter. The transition from one to the other was not made immediately, however. There ap- pears to have been a considerable gap between the widespread adoption of built houses in the Final Neolithic and EM I phases and the building of the first house tombs in the EM II phase. This gap might be explained by the continuing occupation of caves and the lingering conservatism of burial customs, or it might be that much earlier house tombs, perhaps con- temporary with the earliest tholoi, were located in and around Knossos, where the type is thought to have originated, although the evidence is lacking. These explanations are not wholly satisfactory, however, since both ignore the continuing use of caves and rock shelters for burials alongside the new, built tombs, and both overlook the momentous cultural and political developments of Early Bronze Age Crete. Even if they explain the gap between the adoption of the built house and the introduction of the house tomb, they shed no further light on the origins of the house tomb itself. Ultimately the explanation for the house tomb should probably be sought in the fundamental changes that were occurring in Minoan society at the time the new type of tomb appeared. At the beginning of the EM II phase, if not before, Minoan society was being organized along increasingly hierarchical lines.76 The largely egalitarian and segmental society of Late Neolithic and EM I Crete, which did not make a distinction between the burials of different individuals and therefore had no need of built tombs, was being replaced by a more complex society, one that made such distinctions and required built tombs for its most highly ranked individuals. 75 Pendlebury et al., II, p. 15. 76 Whitelaw, Minoan Society, pp. 337-340; Soles, Problems in Greek Prehistory, pp. 49-61. 225</page><page sequence="246">V OFFERINGS AND SHRINES Two kinds of offerings may be distinguished in the tombs: funerary offerings that accom- pany the dead; and offerings of a generally religious nature that may or may not be funer- ary. Among the funerary offerings are the numerous objects deposited with the dead at the time of initial burial, some of which were afterwards allowed to collect in the tombs or in related rooms. Most numerous are the secular objects used in daily life, such as the majority of vases deposited in the tombs or the personal effects deposited with their owners, including weapons, tools, jewelry, seals, and amulets. Although most of the tombs were plundered, there seems to have been a great concentration of such personal wealth in the house tombs, especially in contrast to the scarcity of effects deposited in other types of graves, and this concentration is a good indication that many of the tombs were used for elite burials. The effects reported from the Gournia house tombs and from the large tombs on the West Ter- race at Mochlos are typical and need no further review here.1 It should be noted, however, that such articles may be deposited in the tombs for one of two reasons: either because of an aversion towards their further use by the living (in which case their presence need not indi- cate a belief in an afterlife), or because they are thought to be needed by the dead in order to continue an existence in the afterlife, whether in the tomb or in another world. In this case, amulets that protected the possessor in life are provided to protect him in death; tools of one's trade are provided that the dead may continue his earthly pursuits; weapons may be deposited with a warrior or hunter so that he may continue to fight; and symbols of rank might be provided a chief or king so that he may rule forever. Thus, objects of everyday life would acquire a funerary function which they did not originally possess. RITUAL OFFERINGS Some articles that are not part of the assemblage of everyday objects deposited with the dead were specially designed for ritual use, and it is their presence in the tombs, as well as the funerary practices discussed in the next chapter, that prove the existence of a belief in an afterlife. A few objects appear to have been manufactured solely for funerary use, primarily to hold offerings to the dead; others served a religious function outside the tombs and were designed to be used as ritual offerings or ritual implements in the general cult. Among those designed for funerary use are certain stone and clay vases that held offerings or constituted offerings in themselves. They include the numerous stone vases of varying shapes (bird's- nest bowls, alabastra, cups with straight or hook handles, cylindrical or straight-sided jars, small pots) that are found predominantly in tomb contexts or are thought to be too small to have served any practical function in everyday life.2 Numerous clay vases, mostly jugs, such 1Some, identifiable as prestige goods or symbols of authority, are discussed in Chap. VI, pp. 257-258; compare those from the Mesara discussed by Branigan, Tombs ofMesara, pp. 56-85. 2 Warren, MSV, p. 166.</page><page sequence="247">RITUAL OFFERINGS as those from the lpbo XAaKKOS at Gournes, are also thought to have been specially manufac- tured for the dead,3 and the fruitstands discussed in Chapter I (pp. 25-26), found mainly in funerary contexts, may also have been designed for use in tombs. Usually these vases are placed directly with the dead inside the tombs, but occasionally they are placed outside the walls of the tombs, as they are at Agios Georgios, Archanes B, Gournia I, and the Mallia Western Ossuary, and the tholos tombs Apesokari I and Vorou A. Many are thought to have contained offerings of food to sustain the dead in the afterlife, and several from Lendos are reported to have held remains of animal bones, olive pits, and shells.4 Talismans, espe- cially those inscribed with the "libation formula" that come mainly from tombs (including three from Archanes 6), may have been used in the same way, and it has been suggested that they conceal magical spells also designed to sustain the dead.5 When offerings of this sort are made to the dead at the time of burial, they are simply part of the funerary ritual.6 If they are made long after burial has been completed, as the excavators suggested at Palaikastro II and the Temple Tomb, they may indicate that the dead were worshipped at their tombs. Many excavators have concluded that this was the case, and they have pointed to the small MM III model from Kamilari, which shows offerings of food and drink to the deceased, and to the LM III painted sarcophagus from Agia Triada as evidence for a cult of the dead.7 The evidence is far from conclusive, however, as the discussion below and the description of burial procedures in Chapter VI will show, and both the Kamilari model and the Agia Triada sarcophagus allow different interpretations. Among the objects from the tombs that were used as ritual offerings in the general cult are certain vases and figurines commonly used in cave and peak sanctuaries and domestic, particularly later, palace shrines. It might be assumed that they were used in the same way at the tombs s in these other contexts, especially when they appear in areas outside the tombs or in rooms that were not used for burials, but that they were also used with some special reference to the dead. The crude conical vessels that are found in the courts of both Chrysolakkos I and II, for example, are also found in the MM II sanctuary west of the palace at Mallia.8 They are generally thought to have been designed to hold small offerings of grain and were presumably used in the same fashion at the sanctuary and the Chrysolak- kos tombs. The miniature Chamaizi jugs, which are found in the tombs at Archanes, Chry- solakkos, Gournes, Palaikastro, and the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres, are also found in numerous domestic cult contexts, sometimes inscribed with hieroglyphics, ss id wh , and are thought to have been used for offerings of perfumes or precious oils in the general cult.9 Miniature 3 Xanthoudides, VTM, p. 96; Zois, IIpo,8A7ara, p. 23. 4 G.

Such jugs, usually no more than 0.08 m. high and provided with rudimentary handles at one side, are known from the Snake Room at Knossos, where Evans suggested that they were used for feeding snakes in the cult of the Snake Goddess.'? The ritual offerings also include the various vases containing clay applique offerings, which are found at Chrysolakkos, Palaikastro VII, VIIbis, and Myrtos, Pyrgos, but the majority of which come from other cult contexts.11 These vases are mostly open bowls, although a few other shapes, including jars, cups, and kantharoi, are known, with one or more separately modeled clay offerings attached to the interior of the vase. Except for a few late examples, nearly all date to the MM I/II phases, and they are thought to be an ex- pression of the naturalistic tendencies of the Kamares style.'2 Small quadrupeds, often un- identifiable, are among the most common offerings, accounting for five of just over twenty catalogued vases. Rows of small cellular holes, usually made in a continuous strand of clay wrapped around the interior of the vase, are found in three examples. Flowers, "dough- nuts", and breadlike loaves are each found in two. A flying dove, numerous miniature kan- tharoi, and the most famous, a herdsman and his herd, are still other types of offerings, all unique, that are found inside these vases. The same type of vase is reported from the peak sanctuaries at Gonies Melebiziou and Juktas,13 and all the offerings are paralleled most closely by the votive miniatures found in the peak sanctuaries, often in burned strata, where miniature quadrupeds, pots, breadlike loaves, doughnuts, and even doves were dedicated in the cult.14 At a later time saluting votaries are introduced to the repertoire of vase offerings, and in one vase the Goddess with Upraised Arms appears.15 Various anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and bell figurines found in the tombs may also have served as ritual offerings. The first type, the anthropomorphic, is the largest and most diverse category. It may be divided into schematic figurines, including both folded-arm figu- rines and types indigenous to Crete, and naturalistic figurines that make varying attempts at realistic portrayal. With the exception of several from the Archanes tombs and one from Gournes, the schematic figurines are confined to the Mesara. They have been much dis- cussed,16 and their function is not clearly understood, although it seems likely that it was not unlike that of the naturalistic figurines. These, which are much more common in the house tombs than the schematic figurines, may be subdivided into four distinct types on stylistic and chronological grounds. The earliest and least naturalistic, appearing as early as the 10 Evans, PM IV, pp. 139-140, 1014-1015; Gesell, Town, Palace and House Cult, p. 64. " For bibliography, see M.

It is distinguished from the schematic figurine by the addition of facial details and often a headdress of indistinct form. At the same time it is related to the schematic figurine by the short, straight arms set perpendicular to the body, which are meant to represent folded arms, as an example from Archanes shows.17 The type is found in early domestic contexts and peak sanctuaries as well as in the tombs at Archanes and Koumasa. It is probably descended from a Neolithic form with elongated head and is related to the Petsofa figurines by the Koumasa examples, which borrow details of dress from the Petsofa figurines.18 The Petsofa figurines, named after those from the peak sanctuary at Petsofa, include types from the entire corpus of peak-sanctuary figurines. They are the first successful natu- ralistic figurines produced in Crete.19 They range in date from the MM Ia through the MM III phase and are found in several house tombs, including Archanes 7, Gournes, Chry- solakkos, and Mochlos IV, as well as in the tholoi at Agios Kyrillos and Porti.20 The nude Archanes figure is important because of its resemblance to the schematic folded-arm figu- rines. It suggests the origins of the type, which is, however, wholly transformed by the addi- tion of Minoan costumes. All the figurines from the peak sanctuaries have been identified as votives offered to a divinity, and the human figurines in particular as portrayals of the votaries themselves. The type gives rise to the bronze saluting figurine in the Neopalatial period. In the Neopalatial period the art of producing figurines in a realistic manner is per- fected, and naturalistic ivory figurines are found in Chrysolakkos that match in quality those from palatial contexts.21 At this time it also becomes popular to place the figurines in a natural setting, and the female figurine on a swing from Agia Triada 5 and the various models from Kamilari are rpresentative of this innovation. Each of the models with archi- tectural settings has been interpreted s the representation of a religious scene, that from Agia Triada as an agrarian rite and those from Kamilari as funeral rituals.22 Several re- lated but freestanding figurines are also now often grouped together as if on stage, and the various female figurines with cylindrical skirts from Agia Triada 5 seem to belong to such tableaux. The group has an identical parallel from a palace shrine at Phaistos.23 Zoomorphic figurines are found in the tombs at Archanes (B and 3) and Chrysolakkos, as well as at Koumasa, Platanos, and Porti.24 They are less common than anthropomorphic figurines and seem to appear at a later date, not until the beginning of the MM phase. 17 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1971, p. 242, pl. 290. 18 Xanthoudides, VTM, p. 42, pl.

Miniature figurines, con- sisting mostly of rudely modeled quadrupeds identifiable as bulls in some cases, are slightly more common than the large figurines, which are more carefully modeled and occasionally decorated in paint. Both varieties, including bulls and agrimia, have close parallels in the peak sanctuaries, where the animal figurines are not all miniatures by any means.25 Bell figurines are found at Archanes, where they come from three different tombs (3, 5, and 6) and Vorou A, where a large deposit was found beneath the outer north buttress of the tholos ring wall. They are also found in domestic contexts in small hoards.26 They are manufactured and used primarily in the MM I phase with only a small number appearing in MM II contexts. They show virtually no development in shape and little variation in decoration, nearly all of them painted in vertical or diagonal lines, or both, in dark-on-light or light-on-dark. Two interpretations of the figurines have been offered: one identifying them as votive bells, "sheep bells", largely because of the perforations at or near the top of the figurines that are thought to be for suspending a clapper, and the other identifying them as horned masks, largely because of a painted faience bell from Poros.27 RITUAL IMPLEMENTS Among the objects from the tombs that may have served as ritual implements in the general cult are double axes, triton shells, various libation vessels, offering tables, palettes, and ritu- al stone pounders. The double axe has long been recognized as the pre-eminent symbol of the Minoan religion. It is a ubiquitous feature of the cult that identifies sacred places of worship and may even have served to represent the deity.28 More than twenty examples, several associated with the house tombs, have been found in various tomb contexts.29 They are found in the earliest of the house tombs at Mochlos II; one is stamped on the base of an offering table at Mallia in the House of the Dead; others are incised on the walls of the pillar crypt in the Temple Tomb; and others appear in the last of the tombs, painted on the Agia Triada sarcophagus. They are also found at a number of tholos tomb annexes, includ- ing Platanos Area AB, Agia Triada, Apesokari II, and Kamilari II, and in several later tomb contexts at Pseira, Palaikastro, and Knossos at the Tomb of the Double Axes. Several, including the earliest ones from Mochlos, are quite small, and it has been argued that they 25 For the bulls, see those from Maza (N.

Large examples come from the Area AB at Platanos and the later tombs. Their function is well illustrated on the Agia Triada sarcophagus. They were set up inside or outside tombs, perhaps on wooden poles like those shown on the sarcophagus, and marked off a ritual area where the deity was present and where libations and other offerings were made. Triton shells are reported from five of the house tombs: Palaikastro II, Gournes, Palai- kastro VII, the House of the Dead at Mallia, and Myrtos, Pyrgos, as well as the tholos Vorou A.31 The first of these, from Palaikastro, may be as early as the EM II phase, while most belong to the MM I phase, and those from Myrtos belong to the Neopalatial period. The earliest indication that tritons were used for religious purposes is the single large triton painted with red ochre from a Late Neolithic deposit beneath the Central Court at Phaistos. Its decoration led the excavator to speculate that the shell had had some "sacred use".32 At the EM II village of Myrtos several shells were uncovered that were thought not to have been collected for food. Two had apparently been collected after the departure of the animal; two more appeared to have been broken at one end in order to serve, in the exca- vator's view, as trumpets; and one of these may have been decorated with red ochre.33 By the time of the first palaces tritons are found in important cult deposits at Mallia, Phaistos, and Knossos,34 and their use as ritual objects is firmly established. The imitation of tritons in clay begins at this time. The examples from Knossos and Mallia are terracotta, those from Knossos, miniatures painted with red and white bands, and that from Mallia, life size and painted black. In the Neopalatial period the imitation of tritons in stone begins,35 and tri- tons become especially common in both domestic and funerary contexts. Evans, citing the frequency of tritons in shrines at this time and using the evidence of a crystal lentoid from the Idaean Cave that shows a woman standing beside horns of consecration and holding a triton before her face, concluded that tritons were used in the general cult as trumpets "for calling down the divinity to altars of offering."36 This explanation of the triton appears to 30 K.

This relief triton served as a rhyton,38 and the broken ends observed in so many real tritons may have been designed simply to facilitate libations. Many of the tritons from the tombs were found apart from the burials in these tombs. The triton from Palaikastro II was found in the outer room of the tomb, which was identi- fied as sa mortuary chapel by al the excavators; that from Mallia was found in the House of the Dead, Room III, which was identified in the Catalogue above (p. 175) as a shrine because of its special architectural features as well as its portable altar; and those from Myrtos, Pyrgos were found fallen from the columnar room above the cotomb crypt. In these cases the location of the tritons indicates that they were being used as ritual objects as they were in domestic cult, whether as trumpets or as rhyta, and other tritons from the tombs may have been simi- larly used.39 A number of vessels from the tombs are designed especially for pouring libations. An- thropomorphic, zoomorphic, and composite vessels are the most common of these, and zoo- morphic and composite vessels are also the most persistent, since they are produced from the EM I to the LM III phase without apparent interruption. Composite vessels are the most widespread, and although initially found in funerary contexts in the south of the island, from the MM I phase on they are found in both funerary and domestic contexts over a large area. Examples are known from the house tombs at Archanes and Gournes and from other early tomb contexts at Koumasa, the Pyrgos and Trapeza Caves, and, later, Kamilari.40 They consist mostly of double vases, although a few triplet vases, including the one from Archanes B, are also known. In both cases the vases are joined together either directly or by hollow connecting tubes at their sides and by arched handles placed vertically above. From one period to the next there is a marked development in shape, but the basic features remain the same. The EM I example from Pyrgos with vases of equal size, both with spherical bodies on low feet with cylindrical spouts, joined by a vertical, pronged handle, is important in this respect, for it demonstrates that from the inception of the shape, only one vase is open and the other is always closed. Only one outlet is provided, so that the contents of the secon- dary, closed vase (or vases) must pass through the other vase. The EM II vessels from Koumasa with spherical bodies on low feet and large cut-away necks are derived from the Pyrgos vase. Now, however, the second false spout is eliminated; the secondary vase is re- duced in size; the connecting tube is developed; and the handle takes on the arched form it maintains into the LM III phase. In the MM I phase the same spherical shape is used, but the main vase is provided with a wide, open mouth with collared rim, occasionally spouted.

In the Neopalatial period con- temporary shapes are adopted for the two parts of the vase, and the main part is commonly closed by a flat lid with a large central hole or a number of small perforations, or both. This part of the vase is still usually spouted, however, so that the vessel is still a pouring vessel, and the strainer served to strain or purify the liquid entering the vessel. The findspot of the example from Archanes in the deposit against the outer west wall of Tomb B, its similarity to kernoi from Koumasa and Mallia,41 and the double-axe cut-outs on its stand suggest that such vases were used in the general cult at least as early as the MM I phase. The findspot of the Kamilari vases in the annex of the tomb, away from any burials, and the plastic doves attached to the Kamilari examples suggest the continued use of these vases as ritual implements in the tombs. Like the composite vessels, zoomorphic vessels are found in both domestic cult and funerary contexts. During the Prepalatial period they are especially popular in the Mesara, but a few examples also come from tomb contexts elsewhere, including Archanes 5 and B, Mallia, Mochlos XI, and Myrtos, Pyrgos.42 The earliest vessels are mostly in the form of birds modeled in various poses with varying degrees of naturalism. This shape is especially popular in the Prepalatial period and is not produced in such numbers again until the end of the LM III phase. Other animal shapes also appear in the Prepalatial period, including pigs, tortoises, and beetle, and even some plant forms are produced, none of which reap- pears after the close of this period. In the MM Ia phase the bull rhyton, representing the entire body of the animal, is introduced, and it is this shape that becomes popular through- out the following Protopalatial and Neopalatial periods and replaces the earlier, more ex- perimental shapes. Most of the examples, regardless of shape or date, have two openings, one in the back for receiving liquids and another in front, usually in the head of the animal, for pouring the liquid out. As a result, they may be considered a form of rhyton. The ritual use of the vessels in the form of both bird and bull is established by their appearance in domestic cult contexts as early as the MM I phase,43 and it is likely that the earlier vases were used in the same fashion. Nine anthropomorphic vessels are known, each in the shape of a female figure with handle on the back. The vase is usually provided with two openings, one in the head and the other at the breasts or in a juglike spout at the shoulder. Unlike the composite and zoomor- phic vessels, these vases are strictly a Prepalatial form, appearing first in the EM II phase with the examples from Myrtos and Koumasa (Her.Mus. 4137, 4138) and continuing into the EM III phase with examples from Agios Myronos, Koumasa (Her.Mus. 4993), Mal- lia, Mochlos XIII (Her.Mus. 5499), and Trapeza.44 With the exception of the Myrtos 41 Xanthoudides, VTM, , pp. 34-35, pl.

Two varieties are represented, one in which the figure carries a small jug and possesses ropelike arms, and an EM III variety in which the breasts are pierced and the hands, incised or modeled in clay, are placed beneath them. While the EM II figure from Myrtos served primarily as a cult idol rather than a vase, it clearly belongs to this class of vessels, as Warren has shown, and is important for several reasons. Its carefully modeled and painted jug identifies the spouts on the sides of the vases from Koumasa, Trapeza, and Agios Myronos as schematically modeled jugs, and its rope- like arms, which hold the jug, suggest that the ropelike attachments on the other vases are also arms, not snakes as often suggested.45 The Myrtos vase also confirms the religious identification of the shape, for it was found fallen from an altar in a small shrine. The vase apparently represents the Minoan Snake or Household Goddess.46 Finally, a number of other vessels rarely found in tombs may also be identified as liba- tion vases. A ring vase is attested from Area A at Koumasa. The shape is rare until the end of the Bronze Age in Crete, although another EM II example is known from the Metaxa Collection, probably also from a Mesara tomb.47 Two rhyta of standard type are reported, including the fragment of a conical rhyton from Chrysolakkos, which probably belongs to the last phase of use of the tomb, and another, pear shaped, in stone from Archanes 3.48 Both belong to the Neopalatial period, when such vessels are often found in tombs and in domes- tic cult contexts. Libation jugs from the House of the Dead at Mallia, Room 1, and from the external altar at Apesokari I may perhaps also be recognized.49 They are distinguished by their ovoid bodies with long conical bases and prominent side spouts and resemble the ca- nonical form of libation jug popular in the Neopalatial period.50 Another vase with per- forated lid from the South Building at Agia Triada anticipates the later composite vessels with similar lids.51 In addition to the fixed stone kernoi or offering tables that form an integral part of many tomb altars, portable offering tables of terracotta are associated with several tombs. They are found in MM I contexts at Mallia in the House of the Dead and at Porti, as well as in the South Building at Agia Triada and in a Neopalatial context at Archanes 3. An early, slightly atypical example may also be identified at Chrysolakkos I in an EM III/ MM Ia context.52 All have a flat surface with a raised, decorated border along the edge Beginnings of Minoan Religion," in Antichita cretesi (footnote 30 above, p. 231), pp. 137-147; Miller, op. cit., pp. 379-385. 45 Evans, PM IV, p. 163; cf.

Those from Mallia and Agia Triada belong to a type popular in the Protopalatial period, Type A, which consists of a rectangular tray with or without feet. Those without feet are often embedded in floors and provided with a circular depression near the center of the tray.53 The table with feet from Mallia is important for the double axe stamped on its base, which identifies it as a ritual table for use in the general cult. The tables from Porti and Archanes 3 belong to a class with circular tray and feet, Type B, with or without central depression, which is common in the Neopalatial period and is often referred to as the tripod altar.54 Tables in shrines at Gour- nia and Chamaizi, belonging to Types A and B respectively, demonstrate that both types begin as early as the MM Ia phase. The rounded, oblong feet of these tables appear to be an early feature, used in the case of Chamaizi before the introduction of the canonical three feet found in the Porti table and all the Neopalatial examples of this type.55 Types A and B are both used in the Protopalatial period, but the rectangular tables are almost completely sup- planted by the circular tables in the Neopalatial period. While these tables served as offer- ing tables like those found in domestic cult contexts or peak sanctuaries, different types may have been used for different types of offerings. Those with circular depressions in the trays, for example, may have been used for burnt offerings, since traces of fire are sometimes observed around the depressions.56 Others, such as that from Agia Triada, which has the appearance of a shallow tub, or that from Chrysolakkos I, which has a spouted stone paral- lel from Phaistos, may have been used for liquid offerings. Still others, especially those with flat surfaces and feet, may have been used simply for solid offerings. It is most unlikely that any would have been used in the tombs as portable hearths, as they were also sometimes used in domestic contexts. Palettes, which are found in the tombs on Mochlos (II, V, XI, XX/XXI), in Palai- kastro II, and at many of the Mesara tholoi,57 have also been identified as a type of offering table. The standard shape, best illustrated by the Mesara examples, consists of a rectan- gular limestone slab with flat upper surface marked with a grooved border around the edges and slightly convex underside. The one from Palaikastro is oval, and three from Mochlos have four low feet. The palettes vary in size, the larger examples coming from Mochlos (the largest measuring 0.28 by 0.31 m.) and miniature examples from Agia Triada A and Palai- kastro (the latter measuring 0.05 by 0.09 m.). The tomb palettes date largely to the Prepa- latial period; several from Mochlos (II, XI) and Koumasa belong to EM II contexts and the one from Palaikastro to an EM III context. Others from the Mesara are not later than the 53 See that from the West Shrine Complex at Phaistos (Pernier [footnote 61 above, p. 221], p. 230, figs. 106 and 107); Gesell, Town, Palace and House Cult, p. 15. 54 For the Neopalatial examples, see Nilsson, MMR2, pp. 123-124; Gesell, Town, Palace and House Cult, p. 33. 55 Hawes, Gournia, p. 48, pl.

No palettes have been reported from domestic contexts in the Prepalatial period, whereas after this period they seem to be found only in such contexts. The earliest of these are two from the West Shrine Complex of the early palace at Phaistos; in the Neopa- latial period they become quite common.58 Xanthoudides, citing those in te n he Phaistos shrine, argued that the palettes served a ritual purpose and, on the basis of the footed Mochlos examples and the absence of any sign of grinding or color on the palettes, suggested that they served as offering tables.59 At the same time that these palettes are found in tombs on Crete, however, similar palettes are found in Cycladic graves, often accompanied by small pestles and occasionally with traces of coloring matter on their upper surfaces. The Cycladic palettes were clearly being used for grinding color powders. The later palettes found in domestic contexts on Crete, at least two with coloring material located near by, were probably being used for this purpose too, and the Prepalatial examples from tombs may also have been used in this way.60 Another somewhat enigmatic object is the stone pestle found outside Mochlos XXII (M XXlT-3, p. 85 above). It is one of several from the Mochlos tombs but is unusual in that it shows no signs of use and appears to have been carefully shaped. It is identical in shape to the clay pestles from Koumasa and Platanos that Xanthoudides identified as ritual "phalloi".61 A similar stone pestle is reported from the EM II shrine at Myrtos; it also showed no traces of use and was therefore thought to have served some ritual function.62 Other pestles are reported from the Protopalatial West Shrine Complex at Phaistos, togeth- er with stone palettes in these rooms and traces of red coloring matter. TOMB SHRINES In many cases ritual objects, including offerings and cult implements, are found mixed together with the skeletal material and funerary objects in the tomb, and it is possible that they were used the burial chamber itself63 or depoited with the burials after their use elsewhere, either outside or in another part of the tomb. At the same time, these objects are sometimes associated with rooms that were free of burials or other areas apparently re- served for ritual purposes. More than 30 small shrines or special places of offering have been identified at Mochlos and Gournia and at sites featured in the Catalogue of House Tombs on the basis of dis- tinctive architectural details or associated finds. Most fall into one of two broad categories, consisting either of separate rooms reserved for ritual activities, usually inside the tombs 58 Pernier (footnote 61 above, p. 221), pp. 223, 234-235, figs. 101,112; and for bibliography, see Deshayes and Dessenne (footnote 21 above, p. 210), pp. 62-63, notes 1, 2; P.

Most, if not all, cemeteries appear to have contained at least one shrine. It is usually asso- ciated with one particular tomb, whether located outside and adjacent to the tomb or inside one of its rooms; occasionally two shrines are associated with the same tomb, one in each location, as at Mochlos IV/V/VI, Chrysolakkos I and II, Archanes B, Myrtos, Pyrgos, and the numerous tholos tombs where internal and external ritual areas exist side by side. In some cases one ritual place appears to have served two or more tombs, as at Gournia, where the altar is placed between Tombs I and II, or at Koumasa in the Mesara, where the paved court adjacent to Tholoi E and B apparently serviced all the tombs in the cemetery. All the tomb shrines, even those associated with only one particular tomb, may have served in a similar fashion as communal shrines.64 The lepos AaKKOS, at Gournes, the South Building at Agia Triada, and Building 4 at Archanes are unusual in that they are isolated, freestanding structures that served exclusively as shrines; they are primary examples of shrines used by large numbers of people, probably by entire communities, and in this respect they may well be typical of all tomb shrines. Shrines dated to the EM II/III phases have been tentatively identified within tombs at Mochlos and Palaikastro. Dawkins identified the outer room of Tomb II at Palaikastro as a "mortuary chapel for offerings."65 No burials were found here, and the large number of EM II vases, as well as a fragment of a triton shell and a clay boat, emphasizes the ritual nature of the deposit. MM I vases in the room suggested that it may have been used as a chapel for offerings even after the building ceased to be used as a burial place. On the other hand, since the walls on the south and west sides of the room were largely destroyed, it is possible that burials that had been made in the room were lost along with the walls. Seager suggested that Mochlos IV also served as a "mortuary chapel" in front of the main burial chamber in VI and that the outer part of the compartment always remained open for offerings even after the inner part was used for burials.66 Seager might have made the same suggestion for the empty north room of Mochlos I, which also provided access to the burials in the south room of the compartment. In both cases, the rooms that may have served as chapels are decorated with colorful orthostates, but the evidence for such identifications is otherwise negative, since no ritual objects or offerings were found in either place. Seager's suggestion that the large Compartment III was designed for "funeral rites of some sort"67 is more likely, since it not only was free of burials but also contained a small cave to its east and apparently lacked a roof. Contemporary parallels for interior shrines are to be found in the settlement at Myrtos (Room 92) and perhaps in the antechambers of some Mesara tholoi, particularly Agia Kyriaki (Room 2) and Lebena II (Room A), where low benches similar to that in the Myrtos shrine are also located.68 The ritual areas in the early tombs that may be identified with the most certainty, however, are hypaethral. At Mochlos they include Compartment III in Tomb Complex I/II/III and the approach to Tomb Complex IV/V/VI with its raised terrace and corner 64 See Branigan, Foundations of Palatial Crete, pp. 93-94. 65 Dawkins, PK III, pp. 197-198. 66 Seager, Mochlos II, pp. 44-45. 67 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 37. 68 Warren, Myrtos, pp. 85-87; Blackman and Branigan, BSA 77, 1982, pp. 54-55. 237</page><page sequence="258">OFFERINGS AND SHRINES altar. In southern Crete at Agia Kyriaki, Agia Triada, and Koumasa, and slightly later at Platanos, they consist of irregular spaces marked off by precinct walls and at Koumasa and Platanos by paved courts as well. All these areas are identified as ritual areas by the objects found there as well as by their structural features. At Mochlos IV/V/VI these objects in- clude fragments of stone vases found on the corner altar, probably placed as offerings, and later pottery deposits noted by Seager against the side of the raised terrace.69 At Agia Ky- riaki they include fragments of bowls uncovered at various points in front of the precinct wall and a deposit of pottery in a pit by a flagstone altar in front of the tomb; at Agia Triada they include conical cups and other vases placed against the precinct wall; at Koumasa they include the clay "phalloi" or pestles and anthropomorphic and zoomorphic vases found northwest of the wall; and at Platanos they include large double axes and miniature vases. The West Court at Vasilike with its fixed stone kernoi suggests that open-air spaces were reserved for ritual use in domestic contexts too at this time. Shrines become increasingly common at the beginning of the MM I phase. They have been identified at many of the MM I tombs described above and at all the later ones. Their appearance in growing numbers at tombs is part of a general proliferation of shrines that marks the opening of the Middle Bronze Age in Crete; it is paralleled by the appearance of shrines across the island in caves, on mountain tops, and in certain domestic contexts, culmi- nating in the palaces and villas of the Old Palace period. It is part of a widespread religious fervor that may have had its roots in the political developments of the period. There are many parallels between the shrines, not only in their offerings and cult implements, but also in the built structures that distinguish the shrines. The tomb shrines have particularly close parallels with the peak sanctuaries and with the shrines in country villas and later in the palaces themselves. Like them they might take several forms, the most distinctive being a pillar crypt or columnar shrine, a bench shrine, or an altar-kernos complex. Pillar crypts, similar in plan and architectural detail to domestic crypts, as noted above, have been discovered at Myrtos, Pyrgos, Archanes B, Apesokari I, and probably other MM Ia tholos tombs,70 and later at Agia Triada 5 and the Temple Tomb. The earliest of the tomb pillar crypts appear to be contemporary with the first of the domestic crypts, the Basement of the Monolithic Pillars at Knossos.71 They antedate the palace crypts by 150 years, however, and because they are so prevalent when the crypt first appears, they may well have served as the prototypes for the crypts of important houses, villas, and palaces. From the start both tomb and domestic crypts probably served as places of offering, perhaps for libations, and so the assemblage of material from the crypt at Knossos, with its large quantities of pottery, including the Dove Vase, and its shallow floor pit, parallels the mate- rial from Myrtos with its dove rhyton and "foundation" deposit. Stone vases and conical cups, sometimes inverted like those at Agios Kyrillos or in the western beam chase at Ar- chanes, are as common in these crypts as they are in domestic crypts and also point to the 69 Seager, Mochlos II, p. 40. 70 Such as Apesokari II, Agios Kyrillos, and even Kamilari, all of which have antechambers very similar to those of Apesokari I, although the pillars themselves are missing. 71 A.

The tomb crypts appear to have been reserved primarily for ritual use, and in most cases burials were not allowed to accumulate here, at least not initially, but were placed in adjacent burial chambers or ossuaries. At Myrtos, Pyrgos, where the crypt itself was used as a final burial place, it may have been so used only because the ossuaries were full (in Phases III and IV). In some cases the adjacent rooms of the tomb crypts may also have been used in the same way as those of the domestic crypts. The an- thropomorphic concretion and altar in the outer room at Apesokari I and the male idols in the outer rooms at Agios Kyrillos and Archanes B suggest that these spaces, which served as foyers, also served as outer ritual rooms, perhaps as Platon has suggested for rites prepar- atory to entering the crypt itself. The large numbers of cups and jugs frequently found stacked together in the antechambers of the tholos annexes may identify these rooms as sacristies like those which Platon believes to have been attached to domestic crypts. Where upper-story rooms existed above the crypts, the finds demonstrate that they also served as places of offering, perhaps in each case as columnar sanctuaries. These include the large deposit in the Myrtos crypt of some 300 vases, tritons, and stone vases, all fallen from the floor above; the offertory vases and horns of consecration from the upper floor above the outer pillar crypt of the Temple Tomb, as well as the column base and frescos; the frescos from the room above the Archanes crypt; and the objects apparently fallen from the upper rooms at Agia Triada 5, including female figurines and ritual vases exactly paralleled by the assemblage of objects in a palace shrine at Phaistos, Room 10. Other shrines have been identified in rooms at Chrysolakkos I and II, Archanes 3, and the House of the Dead at Mallia. The whole east wing of Chrysolakkos I appears to have served as a ritual area, left free of burials, which could accommodate sizable numbers of people. Thus it was provided with numerous benches, lining virtually every wall of every room, fixed altars and kernoi, and a stucco table, perhaps serving for offerings, and con- tained a number of small conical vessels thought to have been designed for making offerings of grain. Room III in the House of the Dead has also been identified as a shrine because of its architectural features and finds. While burials were located in the eastern half of the room, the western half was left open for ritual purposes, and a clay offering table with a double axe stamped on its base, together with a large triton shell, was uncovered in this section. The rooms to the north, I and II, may also have served for ritual ceremonies at some point in the use of the tomb, since they are easily reached from III, and a libation vase, as well as a number of stone vases, was found here. A major shrine has been identified at Chrysolakkos II in the room with the stucco altar, which was apparently used for pouring libations, and it has been suggested that others may have existed elsewhere inside the tomb. At Archanes 3 it seems likely that one or more of the rooms in the upper floor served as ritual areas. Fragments of plaster tripod offering tables, as well as animal figurines, includ- ing at least one agrimi, were scattered in the upper stratum of the tomb, where they are thought to have fallen from the upper floor. All these interior shrines with their benches, altars, and offering tables have contemporary parallels in domestic architecture, already in the MM Ia phase at Chamaizi (Room 4), probably one of the first country villas, and in 239</page><page sequence="260">OFFERINGS AND SHRINES important houses at Gournia (Aa, Room 4) and perhaps Koumasa;72 parallels are more common, however, with later palatial shrines. Still other shrines or places of offering have been noted outside Chrysolakkos I and II, Agios Georgios, Gournia II, Palaikastro VIII, and several MM Ia tholos tombs. At Agios Georgios and Apesokari I they consist of niches in the outer walls, the one at Agios Georgios built onto and projecting from the wall, and that at Apesokari recessed in the wall. Vases, thought to have held offerings of food, had been deposited in the niche at Agios Georgios. At Chrysolakkos the terraces of both the earlier and later tombs were also used as ritual areas, and conical offering vessels like those in the east wing of Chrysolakkos I were placed there in considerable numbers. The areas in front of Chrysolakkos I and Kamilari were flanked by precinct walls, in the same fashion as those at earlier tombs. Altars, standing unattached and separate from the tombs, were located in these areas at Chrysolakkos I and Kamilari and in front of Apesokari I. Both those at Apesokari I and Kamilari are securely identified by offerings of stone and clay vases, several of which were inverted. Other altars built onto tombs have been identified at Gournia II, Apesokari II, and perhaps Palaikastro VIII. In addition, an altar may have stood outside the Tomb of the Painted Sarcophagus at Agia Triada, if the tomb presented on the sarcophagus is indeed one and the same.73 The best parallels for these external shrines with their altars, terraces, and precinct walls are found not in domestic contexts, but in the peak sanctuaries that flourished at places like Gonies, Juktas, Petsofa, or Traostalos at the same time as the tomb shrines.74 Several buildings that contained no burials have been discovered in the midst of ceme- teries and appear, like the peak sanctuaries, to have been devoted wholly to ritual use. They include the epos AaiKKos at Gournes, the South Building at Agia Triada, Archanes Building 4, and perhaps some of the small outbuildings at Koumasa. Each was used as a depository for offerings or ritual equipment, if not for other purposes as well. The Gournes building, which contained hundreds of miniature vases, was used exclusively as a depository for offer- ings and was compared by its excavator to shrines found beside the Protodynastic tombs of Egypt. Some of the structures built outside the tholoi at Koumasa, where anthropomorphic and zoomorphic rhyta and other vases were found, were identified by their excavator as storerooms "for the gifts made by the living to the dead" and may have been used in the same way as the building at Gournes. The South Building, which contained a number of stacked vessels, bowls and conical cups, and several ritual vessels, including a libation vase and a libation tray, and Archanes 4, which contained scores of conical cups, some inverted on the terrace of the building, were also clearly used as places of offering and places where equip- ment used in making the offering might be stored. The two buildings accommodated visitors to the cemeteries in other ways too. The South Building, provided with benches and interior doorways, permitted movement from room to room, and Archanes 4, provided with a kit- chen for the preparation of food, including meat and grain, could also accommodate small 72 Xanthoudides (footnote 55 above, p. 235); Soles, AJA 83, 1979, pp. 152-154; Xanthoudides, VTM, pp. 49-50. 73 For this possibility, see Long, The Ayia Triadha Sarcophagus, pp. 49-50. 74 See B.

It is possible, as Branigan has argued,75 that the funerary ritual in- volved some sort of banquet in honor of the deceased, as in Mycenaean Greece, but it may also be that these tomb shrines simply provided facilities for the preparation of offerings, including offerings of food and drink, as well as areas for storing objects needed in making the offering and areas for depositing it. Shrines in domestic contexts provided facilities for such multiple activities beginning in the EM II phase. Two important conclusions may be drawn about the tomb shrines. The first is that many, perhaps all, belonged to the general cult and were not necessarily erected for the worship of the dead. Pillar crypts, bench shrines, courtyards with precinct walls, and altars with fixed kernoi are structures that are commonly used as places of worship. The ritual equipment found in the tombs and in the tomb shrines is also characteristic. Each element- double axe, triton, offering table, anthropomorphic and zoomorphic rhyta, and libation vessel-is a regular feature in the cult assemblage of Minoan religion. In addition, many of the offerings in the tombs, especially those located in the shrines, apart from the burials, should be identified as offerings to a deity. Bowls with plastic appliques, anthropomorphic figurines, small bulls, or agrimia are offerings that are customarily made to the deity in other locations. Occasionally, a particular deity might be represented in the tomb as a cult idol, whether in the shape of a concretion as at Apesokari I, an anthropomorphic or dove rhyton, or in a more naturalistic fashion, as in some of the female figurines from Agia Triada 5. The Temple Tomb discovered by Evans and the double tomb of Minos described by Diodorus (4.79) as half sepulchre, half sanctuary have a long tradition in Crete. Minoan religion involved some concept of an afterlife, and its deity played some role in this concept; accordingly, the tomb was considered an appropriate location for worship, and shrines dedi- cated to the deity became a common adjunct to tombs. Such shrines, while not differing in essentials from those in other locations, may have been used for a slightly different purpose, and the ritual carried out in these shrines, while apparently similar to that practiced else- where, may have been directed to a different end. At the tomb it would be appropriate to invoke the deity as a guardian of the dead. Of course, it is possible that the dead themselves might also be invoked at their tombs using the equipment of the general cult. The second conclusion is also to be drawn from the connection between tomb shrines and other shrines. While the parallels between the two are sometimes contemporary, often the tomb shrines appear to have preceded later examples by many centuries. This may also be true to some extent of certain ritual objects used in the tombs, as Gesell has noted in her review of Minoan cult: birds, double axes, and perhaps horns of consecration;76 but it is especially striking in the architectural features of the shrines. The altar-kernos complexes at Chrysolakkos I and Gournia II are the first examples of a type that is to become very common, but it is significant that it reappears in the immediately succeeding period in the monumental Chrysolakkos II and is then incorporated as a major shrine in the second palace at Mallia. The pillar crypt also appears in tombs long before it appears as a major shrine in the palaces at Knossos, Mallia, and Phaistos. The very ancient shrine outside 75 Branigan, Tombs of Mesara, pp. 99-102. 76 Gesell, Town, Palace and House Cult, p. 8. 241</page><page sequence="262">OFFERINGS AND SHRINES Mochlos IV/V/VI is also curiously replicated on a much grander scale in the Theatral Area at Knossos. The explanation for this transferral of tomb cult to palace cult, and for the parallels observed between tomb shrines and those elsewhere, is not that Minoan cult was basically chthonic in nature. Cult symbols are too varied and cult locations, including mountain tops, are too diverse to suggest anything other than a rich and pervasive religious system that encompassed many areas of human concern. The explanation is probably to be found instead in the status of those who were buried in these tombs. The tombs in the North Cemetery at Gournia and on the West Terrace at Mochlos have been identified as elite burial places, and many of the other Prepalatial house tombs may have served in this way too. In the palatial periods there is a direct link between tomb and palace cult because the tombs are elite tombs, or, to use Effenterre's expression, "tombes seigneuriales".77 The shrines at the Temple Tomb, Agia Triada 5, Archanes 3 and B, Myrtos, Pyrgos, and Chrysolakkos II and III, all burial places of an elite class, served the special interests of this class just as surely as did the shrines in the villas and palaces from which they ruled. In the Prepalatial period the predecessors of this elite, who should probably be identified as chiefs who ruled over small geographical areas and actually monopolized ritual or religious re- sponsibilities, also made use of religion to legitimize and consolidate their authority.78 It is no coincidence that at the very time when this elite was expanding and consolidating its power in the MM Ia phase, shrines proliferated throughout Crete in many locations. These shrines played an "integrative role", as Cherry and Bintliff have observed,79 and helped unify a society that was being organized hierarchically. The individuals buried in these tombs were the very ones who were bringing about the unification of the island in a number of highly centralized palatial polities, and "religious sanctions" and the "manipulation of ideological symbolism" were among the more important means they employed to achieve their goals. 77 Effenterre, Palais de Mallia, p. 247. 78 E.

They were used for repeated burials for several gen- erations and often for hundreds of years. Most of the tombs on Mochlos appear to have been used in both the EM II and EM III phases of the Prepalatial period, perhaps for as many as 850 years,1 and most of those at Gournia in both the MM Ia and Ib phases, some 350 years. The prolonged use of these buildings, which must have required frequent repairs to their mud-brick walls and roofs, is typical of other house tombs, and only after long periods of use were old tombs abandoned and new tombs constructed to accommodate new burials. BURIAL DEPOSITS The burial deposits uncovered in the tombs are the result, then, of many years of repeated use, and three different types of burial deposits are found as a result, often within one and the same tomb. Usually the burials are disturbed, the skeletal remains re fragmentary and mixed indiscriminately in such a way that it is no longer possible to identify individuals. Sometimes the principal bones, mainly skulls, are gathered up and placed either at one side of the tomb or in special containers, carefully stored away. At other times undisturbed burials, still articulated and usually contracted, are found on the floor of the tomb or inside larnakes. These three apparently separate types of deposits have caused some confusion. Many archaeologists, emphasizing the disarray and fragmentary nature of the burials, refer to the tombs as "ossuaries", "bone houses", or o0rcoO7Kal, suggesting that the tombs were used for secondary burials and that the primary burials and the decomposition of the corpses occurred elsewhere. Such were the views of the early archaeologists at Palaikastro, who noted that the burial remains belonged to "bodies skeletonised by previous interment else- where," of Seager at Mochlos, who believed that the "bones belonged to secondary burials rather than to original interments," and more recently of Sakellarakis at Archanes, who has suggested that the skulls in Tomb 6 were deposited there after having been transferred from another cemetery.2 Burial is thought of as a "two-stage process", as Branigan has put it, first in a "mortuary house", later in a "bone repository".3 Although burial did indeed involve a two-stage process in the sense that the bones were relocated after the flesh had decayed, there is little evidence for the view that primary burials were made outside the tomb in another location and that the bones were later removed to the house tombs. Primary burials have been found in situ in several of the tombs and indicate another procedure. The number of still articulated primary burials is admittedly small in proportion to the total number of individuals represented by the skeletal material as a whole. Twenty-six have been noted and briefly described in the house tombs recorded here. These include one 1 By P. Warren's extended chronology ("Problems of Chronology in Crete and the Aegean in the Third and Earlier Second Millennium B.C.," AJA 84, 1980, pp. 487-499). 2 Bosanquet, PK I, p. 292; Seager, Mochlos II, p. 15; Sakellarakis, Archaeology 20, 1967, p. 176. 3 Branigan, Foundations of Palatial Crete, pp. 155-158; see also Hutchinson (Prehistoric Crete, p. 228), who suggests the same procedure.</page><page sequence="264">BURIALS AND SOCIAL RANKING each from Archanes 3, 7, and 19, Chrysolakkos II, Palaikastro VII, and Zakros A, two each from Archanes 5 and 18 and the northern of the Eastern Ossuaries at Mallia, three each from Palaikastro V and VI and Zakros B, and five from Archanes B. In addition, an undis- closed number of undisturbed burials is reported from Agios Georgios, in the south section of the west room, from Archanes 5, deposited in strata in the eastern compartment, from Ar- chanes B, in the lower stratum in the north addition of the tomb, and from Myrtos, Pyrgos, in the burial strata of the main chamber. All these burials, except for that outside Palaika- stro VII, appear to have been contracted. Where the information has been reported, 11 of 17 are oriented with head to the east, and 7 of 9 are placed on their left side. Most of the burials lay directly on the paved or earth floors of the tombs, and in only a few cases do they seem to have been placed on specially prepared surfaces. At Palaikastro VI, where the burial was no longer complete, a special pebble flooring had been prepared; at Chrysolakkos the burial is reported to have been placed on a sticky green clay; and at Archanes the numerous sea shells found with several of the burials may have provided special beddings. In addition, many primary burials were placed inside larnakes and pithoi from the MM Ia phase on. Only five have been preserved still articulated, those from Archanes 5 and 18 and Zakros A and B, which account for four of the six cases in which the burials are not oriented towards the east, but the number of additional larnakes and pithoi preserved in the tombs, empty or contain- ing fragmentary remains, suggests that the practice was common. Often burials, whether placed on the floor or in larnakes, appear to have been separated from the rest of the tomb by secondary dividing walls. Such is the case at Zakros B and Myrtos, where flimsy walls were thrown up around the burials, and at Archanes 3 and Mochlos IV, where more substantial walls blocked the burials at the rear of the compartments. The evidence from the tholos tombs is similar. Here too most of the burials are badly disturbed, but a small number of undisturbed burials has been reported. These include the articulated limbs of one skeleton in the Agia Triada A annex, Room G, another in the southwest room of the Agios Kyrillos annex, and at least one from the upper stratum of Archanes E, two each from the Apesokari annex, Room C, and the Gypsades tholos at Knossos, and as many as seven from Archanes F.4 All are contracted and rest either on the floors of the tombs or in larnakes. Those resting on the floor lie on their left side with head oriented to the east, while those in larnakes are oriented in all directions. A number of extended inhumations are also reported somewhat tentatively from Vorou and from the Lendos tholoi,5 but they appear to be exceptional. In both house tomb and tholos, the same building clearly served as mortuary house and as ossuary. In the house tombs, primary burials and the secondary storage of bones were usually made within one and the same room. At the same time, in several cases one room within a tomb seems to have been intended for the initial laying-out of the dead or prothesis, just as other rooms seem to have been designed as ossuaries. Such appears to have been the case at Palaikastro VI and Mochlos IV/VI, where the outer rooms may have been reserved 4 Stefani, ASAtene 13-14, 1930-1931, p. 151; Sakellarakis, AAA 1, 1958, p. 52, fig. 2; Schorgendorfer, Forschungen auf Kreta, p. 18; S.

At Palaikastro VI one burial lay in situ in the outer room while two more lay with a large number of disturbed burials and skulls in the inner room; at Mochlos IV/V/VI the remains of a burial are reported in the northern part of Compartment IV, while many skulls were put away in the inner chamber VI; and at Myrtos, Pyrgos, the articulated burials lay on the floor in the crypt, while dozens of skulls were packed so tightly into adjacent rooms "that the flesh had to have rotted before they were put in."6 The use of different rooms for different stages of burial may have been more common than the evidence suggests. So, for example, rooms that are found empty, such as the north room of Mochlos I or Room 2 of Archanes 6, or with the remains of only one burial, such as the outer east room of Gournes, while the rest of the tomb is packed full of skeletal material, may also have been reserved for the prothesis. In the one case, the skeleton has been removed and the room cleared for future use, while in the other the cleaning has not yet taken place.7 Disturbed burials are the rule. They are reported in all the house tombs where burials are described and also in the other collective tombs of the period. The disturbance is usually explained by the presumed transferral of the bones from primary burial elsewhere but may be due to other factors as well. In the Kyparissi rock shelter, where traces of fire and animal bones were mixed with the human remains, it was suggested that the disarray of the skeletal material was due to funeral rituals that took place inside the cave. In the Zakros tombs the excavator noted that most of the burials were located at the sides of the rooms, and in Room B of Tomb A it was clear that these remains had been swept to the sides of the room in order to provide space for the larnax burial in the center. A similar practice may be noted in at least two Mesara tholoi, at Kamilari and Koumasa E. In the latter the excavator noted that the bones had been swept up and heaped together in the northwest part of the tholos, as if the tomb had been "tidied up ready for new interments."8 Repeated use of the tombs over many years, then, may also account for the confusion of skeletal material. As each new burial was made, previous burials were removed to make room. The repeated and pro- longed use of the tombs also necessitated periodic cleanings, without which the tombs would quickly have become filled as the floor level was continually raised, and they could not have been used for as long a period as they were. These cleanings also help account for the confu- sion and fragmentary nature of the remains. During the cleanings, an, d probably as a part of an extended funeral ritual, most bones were thrown out, often including principal bones, while skulls were retained and placed elsewhere within the tomb. It is unclear if the skulls were always saved, but the care taken with those that were suggests that this may have been the practice. Sometimes the skulls were simply put on the earth floor to one side of the room, as at Mochlos I, where they were stacked in a pile in one corner, or they might be deposited in pits in the floor, whether natural cavities like those in Mochlos II and VI or artificially dug like that in Gournia I. Beginning in the EM III/MMIa phases, various containers were employed. They might be 6 Cadogan, ArchReports for 1977-1978, p. 74. 7 Branigan has suggested that empty rooms in the tholos annexes may have served a similar function (Branigan, Tombs of Mesara, pp. 94-95; Blackman and Branigan, BSA 77, 1982, p. 52). 8 Xanthoudides, VTM, pp. 7, 34; Levi, ASAtene 23-24, 1961-1962, pp. 24-32, figs. 21-27. 245</page><page sequence="266">BURIALS AND SOCIAL RANKING small or large vases of any shape. If small, only a single skull would be deposited inside, as in so many cases at Archanes 6, but if a large vase was used, the skull might be deposited together with some of the principal bones, as at Palaikastro VII, or several skulls might be deposited, as at Archanes 19, where the remains of three individuals were found inside one large vase and the remains of animal, chicken, and fish bones, as well as sea shells, small vases, and other grave goods were found with the skulls in other vases. The most popular containers from the MM Ia phase on, however, were pithoi and larnakes. These were found to contain skeletal material at the House of the Dead at Mallia, Zakros A, the Tomb of the Painted Sarcophagus at Agia Triada, and at Archanes, where virtually every tomb seems to have employed them as storage containers. Pithos and larnax fragments from other tombs suggest that such practice was widespread. The number of skulls stored within pithoi and larnakes might range from only one or two to ten or more. In one case at Archanes 18, 17 skulls were found in and around a broken larnax, many of which were once stored inside it. Like the tombs, the larnakes seem to have been used for repeated burials, and the skulls stored in the larnakes often seem to have belonged to earlier burials in the same larnax. Thus at Zakros A and in several of the tombs at Archanes, bones of earlier interments were occasionally pushed to one side of the larnax to make room for a new occupant. As more burials were made in the larnax, only the skulls of previous burials would be retained, and eventually even some of these might have to be placed elsewhere in the tomb. In the tomb at Agia Triada, for example, it was suggested that the painted larnax was used repeatedly for primary burials and that the skulls from these burials were placed in the unpainted larnax in the cist below floor level. In addition to the corners of rooms or pits in the floor, pots, pithoi, and larnakes, spe- cially constructed enclosures and occasionally special rooms were also used for the storage of skulls and principal bones. They include the walled crypt hidden beneath the floor of the room west of the pillar crypt in Archanes B, where the remains of 13 individuals had been placed in a single sarcophagus. Barriers were erected across the west rooms of Archanes 3 to close off the burial remains, and the walls erected between the pillars and the south and west walls of the pillar crypt in the Temple Tomb were designed to contain all the previous burials in the tomb as well as various building debris. Special rooms designed primarily as ossuaries have also been noted at Mochlos (Compartment V), Myrtos, Pyrgos, Palai- kastro III (Rooms 3 and 4), and Archanes 5 and 6. In several of these cases the ossuary rooms were additions to the original tombs and appear to have been added to store earlier burials from these tombs and permit their further use. Eventually they might themselves be used for primary burials; for example, two articulated burials were found in situ in the east- ern compartment of Archanes 5. The other collective tombs of the period, especially the tholos tombs, appear to have been used in the same fashion. Here too periodic cleanings involved the selective collection and retention of skulls and principal bones. At Platanos B and Koumasa B skulls had been heaped together at distinct points along the ring walls of the tholoi.9 At Agia Triada A they lined the ring wall of the tholos and were also collected in Rooms F and G of the annex.'0 9 Xanthoudides, VTM, pp. 7, 92. 10 Stefani, ASAtene 13-14, 1930-1931, p. 151, fig. 5. 246</page><page sequence="267">SKULL RETENTION AND FUNERARY RITUAL Containers were also used to store the skeletal remains, whether small vases as at Vorou A, Room AA 1,11 or more often pithoi and larnakes. These are reported from a number of tholoi, including Archanes F and E, Drakones, Gypsades, Kamilari, Porti, Siva, and espe- cially Vorou, where the annex Rooms AA 1 and 2 of Tholos A were packed with two layers of pithoi and larnakes stacked on top of each other. Small, roughly built enclosures were also used for bone deposits, such as that built to one side of Room AA 2 at Vorou A,12 and certain rooms of the annexes often seem to have been designated for this purpose. At Porti, Room y, which was packed with disturbed bones, was identified as an ossuary, and at Apesokari II, the large rectangular room added to the south of the original four-room annex was also identified as an ossuary.13 Although mainly intended for secondary bone deposits, here too the ossuaries may have accommodated a primary burial at some point in their use; thus in the Apesokari II ossuary a small larnax belonging to an infant burial was found intact and apparently in its original position. SKULL RETENTION AND FUNERARY RITUAL In addition to indicating that the house tombs were used for primary burials, the articulated burials reported from these tombs are important for information they provide concerning funerary ritual, particularly at the time of initial interment. One in particular, an undis- turbed infant burial reported from Archanes 19 underneath a large stone in the corner of the tomb, was accompanied by a deposit of animal and fish bones, indicating that food offerings accompanied the initial interment of the deceased. Food remains reported in disturbed con- texts in other tombs at other sites, as well as the array of food remains that Sakellarakis has identified in practically all the Archanes tombs, including various animal bones, chicken, and fish bones, may then also belong to such offerings made to the deceased. They need not be thought of only in terms of some funerary repast held by mourners at the tomb.14 Two articulated burials reported in the house tombs represent an intermediate stage in the burial process between the initial interment of the corpse and the sweeping up and disposal of the skeletal remains and provide further information regarding funerary pro- cedures. One burial at Palaikastro V and another at Archanes B were found in situ with ar- ticulated limbs but with their skulls removed, at Archanes leaving a displaced lower jaw. In the Palaikastro burial the skull removed may have been one of those placed in the adjacent room; at Archanes the skull seems to have been placed at the feet of the skeleton. In both cases the skulls were intentionally removed at a time when the bodies had decayed suffi- ciently to permit the separation. In both cases the primary burials, the removal, and the secondary deposition of the skulls occurred in one and the same tomb. At a still later time, after the gathering of the skulls, or in some cases perhaps during their removal, the remain- ing bones of the skeletons would have been displaced. A similar procedure appears to have been followed in the tholoi. So at Vorou A an articulated burial found beneath a large spouted tub in Room AA 2 was apparently complete except for its missing skull. As at 11 Marinatos, AeAT 13, 1930-1931, p. 150. 12 Marinatos, AcAT 13, 1930-1931, fig. 15. 13 Xanthoudides, VTM, pp. 56-57; Davaras, AeAr 19, 1964, p. 441. 14 As Branigan has suggested for the tholos tombs (Branigan, Tombs of Mesara, pp. 93, 102). 247</page><page sequence="268">BURIALS AND SOCIAL RANKING Palaikastro V and Archanes B it had been removed after the decomposition of the flesh, and a skull thought to belong to the burial was found near by, outside the tub.'5 The gathering and redeposition of skulls so graphically illustrated in these examples were accompanied by still another offering of food, in this case if not also in the first, to- gether with the offering of conical cups. Many of the vases used for the final deposit of skulls at Archanes, particularly in Tomb 19, also held the remains of food packed side by side with skulls. Still other vases in the upper stratum of Archanes 19, which were deposited at the same time as those that stored skulls, held only food supplies. In these cases the offerings were made when the skulls were finally deposited, but unless the offerings were actually placed with the skulls, as these were, it is not always possible to recognize the offering as a secondary offering made in conjunction with the removal of the skull. The offering of coni- cal cups at this stage of the funerary ritual is much more easily recognized, and several examples of such offerings have been cited. Perhaps the best are the cups placed with the articulated but decapitated burial in Archanes B, one cup placed by the displaced lower jaw, another inverted by the skull at the feet of the skeleton. Other cups are reported, often inverted alongside the skull or actually attached to them, in Archanes 5, 8, and 19, in each case after the skull had been separated from its skeleton and deposited in its final resting place. At Gournia II two cups, one on its side and perhaps originally inverted, were also found embedded in the fragmentary skull in the west room of the tomb. At Palaikastro VII conical cups, which constituted the majority of the pottery, were often found inverted by the skulls they accompanied. Because of the intentional deposition of cups in these cases, their presence by skulls in other tombs, which might otherwise be considered part of the normal assemblage of vases deposited with the dead, acquires special significance. At Gournes, where a cup was reported by each of the skulls, at Palaikastro, where such cups are reported to have been especially common among all the cemeteries,'16 and in every house tomb where these cups appear, they should be identified, at least in part, as the remains of secondary offerings placed by relocated skulls. Most of the cups date to the EM III and MM I phases, when the shape has begun to appear in some quantity, but the choice of the particular shape is nevertheless significant, since such cups now begin to be used in cult contexts, not only at tomb altars such as those at Kamilari and Apesokari I, inverted in both cases, and Gournia II but also in peak sanctu- aries. The use of such cups for offerings becomes increasingly common at a later time when they are identified as "votive cups" by Evans and are found in several cult contexts, most notably at the Spring Chamber by the Caravanserai at Knossos, in the upper shrine at the Psychro Cave, and in the pillar crypt at Gypsades House B, where some 200 were ranged in rows to one side of the pillar.17 In each of these cases the cups were inverted and often held the remains of carbonized food offerings. It may be inferred that the conical cups placed by 15 Marinatos, AcAT 13, 1930-1931, pp. 150-151. 16 Bosanquet and Dawkins, PK II, p. 303; Dawkins and Bosanquet, PK IV, p. 269. 17 Evans, PM II, pp. 134-135, fig. 68; Evans, "The Palace of Knossos," BSA 7, 1900-1901 (pp. 1-120), pp. 98, 76, pl.

The use of these cups in the funeral ritual is paralleled by the initial deposition of vases with food offerings as well as other objects with the dead at the original interment. If the function of the original deposit was to equip the dead with objects to sustain him in the afterlife, the secondary offering of conical cups probably served a similar purpose. The two offerings, one made considerably after the other, however, suggest that life after death also involved two stages, first perhaps a period of limbo which lasted as long as the body remained intact and during which time the dead remained on earth and lived in the tomb, and later withe dn the decomposition of the flesh and the removal of the skull a release from earthly exis- tence and an afterlife in another world. In this case the initial offerings of food deposited with the dead and placed against tomb walls, during or after initial interment, sustained the dead while he resided in the tomb, and the personal possessions and other objects of trade that he required in life were laid by his side to satisfy his earthly needs so long as he remained on earth. Such a concept of the afterlife explains the nature of the house tomb in many civiliza- tions where it appears.18 The dead is thought to live on in the tomb, if only for a few years after death, and tombs that resemble the house in which the dead lived in life are required to insure further the continuity of his existence during the period of limbo. The small terracotta model from Kamilari I, which Levi believes to depict a cult of the dead, with two small figures worshiping four larger figures in front of their tomb,19 may represent a scene of just such food offerings made to the dead while they still inhabit the tomb. The mere representa- tion of the offering may have possessed a potent force that assured the offering, not unlike the homeopathic magic that similar models in Egyptian tombs possessed. Such offerings were required only temporarily, however, and after the decomposition of the flesh and the removal of the skull, neither offerings nor personal possessions, nor even a resting place in the tomb were required. Possessions, earlier offerings, and the bones themselves might be swept aside, sometimes removed or sometimes stored away, without fear of harming or provoking the dead. The apparent disregard for the dead, contrasting so sharply with the initial care with which they were laid out, has also been noted by Branigan in the case of the Mesara tholoi20 and does not indicate a lack of belief in an afterlife but only that the dead were no longer thought to reside in the tomb. At this time and as part of the rite involving the removal of the skull, a second food offering was placed by the removed skull to provide some final suste- nance, perhaps for the journey of the soul to its new abode. The cup that held this offering was often inverted to fix the offering in the earth. Astrom has noted that the inversion may "be explained as a natural act, consisting of pouring out a liquid and leaving the empty vessel upside down at the same place." But by being left there, it becomes a "memorial of the act" and when repeated "in funerary or sacred contexts, it may become a ritual."21 Other rituals in addition to the offering of food and conical cups almost certainly accom- panied the burial of the dead. In the case of the Mesara tholoi, rituals such as farewell 18 For a survey of house tombs, see Grinsell, Barrow, Pyramid and Tomb, pp. 9-16. 19 Levi, ASAtene 23-24, 1961-1962, pp. 123-127; see also Branigan, Tombs of Mesara, pp. 116-118. 20 Branigan, Tombs of Mesara, pp. 109-111. 21 P.

At Archanes, where the two types of tombs, one characteristic of the Mesara, the other of central and eastern Crete, come together, burial customs peculiar to the Mesara must have been practiced, and Building 4 in particular seems to offer some evidence of the toasting and banqueting that may have been practiced in the Mesara. Regional or cultural differences in burial customs should be expected, however, particularly during the Prepalatial period, and it may be that burial in the Mesara involved certain rites that were not practiced in the northern and eastern parts of the island. Whatever differences in burial customs there may have been between these two areas, the similarities were nevertheless considerable, based as they were on the same belief in a two-phase existence after death. In addition, the altars and shrines located at so many of the house tombs, as well as the Mesara tholoi, have been identified as those of a Minoan deity, and the ritual vases and implements found in both types of tomb have been associated with the general cult. It has been suggested that the shrines played a particular role in the funer- ary ritual as suitable locations for invoking the deity on behalf of the dead. There is perhaps no way to reconstruct the exact manner in which these shrines were used; the altars and ritual equipment suggest only that the deity was invoked at some point in the funerary ritual and received offerings and libations. It seems likely, however, that each stage of burial might be accompanied by its own ritual at the tomb shrine, and some evidence of this is perhaps to be found in the painted scenes on the Agia Triada sarcophagus. Largely owing to Charlotte Long's detailed study of the sarcophagus,23 these scenes are now recognized with near un- animity as funerary scenes, although differences in interpretation of details may still occur. The scenes were painted in the Mycenaean era, probably during the LM IIIa phase before the final destruction of Knossos when frescos were still being made in Crete, and the main danger in using them to explain earlier Minoan funerary ritual is, of course, that they may depict Mycenaean funerary procedures or at least procedures that belong to a time long after those performed before the house tombs. Nevertheless, the sarcophagus sat inside a very ancient type of Minoan tomb, the house tomb, and the attributes of the deity depicted on the sarcophagus belong to a very ancient Minoan deity, the very one who was apparently wor- shipped centuries earlier at the house tombs. Because of the conservative nature of funerary ritual in the Bronze Age, it is possible that the rites depicted are similar to those that took place in the Neopalatial period in front of Agia Triada 5, Archanes B, or the Temple Tomb, all of which were still in use in the LM IIIa phase, and before other tombs even earlier. Long has interpreted both scenes as apparently unrelated offerings performed in the course of the funerary ritual, but once the twofold nature of the burial customs practiced at both the house tombs and the Mesara tholoi is recognized, then the two scenes on the sarcophagus begin to make sense as a coherent unit that depicts two different phases of the funerary ritual. Initial offerings made on the front of the sarcophagus (coursing bulls, a boat) are made to the dead 22 Branigan, Tombs of Mesara, pp. 99-103, 132-138. 23 Long, The Ayia Triadha Sarcophagus. 250</page><page sequence="271">POPULATION UNIT at the time of initial interment when he is still present in this world and stands in front of the tomb. At this time it was apparently also the custom to make offerings to the deity, perhaps invoked as a guardian of the dead. On the sarcophagus these are liquid libations made at the tomb altar. At a later time, shown on the reverse side of te sarcophagus, the dead is no longer depicted, not because the tomb is no longer shown, as Long suggests, but because the dead is no longer present. Perhaps now his skull has been relocated, his skeleton dispersed, and his soul released from its earthly bonds. At this time further offerings were made to the deity, perhaps offerings of thanksgiving paid in tribute to the deity's life-giving powers. On the sarcophagus these include the offering of first fruits and a libation, the sacrifice of a bull, and dancing accompanied by the triumphal flute. The double offering made to the deceased, for which there is tangible evidence in the tombs, is accompanied on the evidence of the sarcophagus by a double offering made to the deity at the tomb shrine. The actual offerings may have varied from region to region or tomb to tomb and from one time to another, but the consecutive twofold character of the offering would not vary, rooted as it was in the actual burial practice and in the Minoan concept of the afterlife. POPULATION UNIT Although it is sometimes assumed that the house tombs were communal tombs used by clans or perhaps entire communities in the same manner as the Mesara tholoi,24 the multiple skeletal remains found in the tombs indicate only that they were collective tombs. They do not readily indicate what unit of population, community, clan, fraternity, or family, used them. If it were possible to establish the actual total of burials ever made in any one tomb and the exact length of time it was used, it might be possible to establish exactly what population unit used the tombs, but such information is difficult to obtain for two reasons. First, the skeletal remains are always incomplete and fragmentary because of the periodic cleaning of the tombs in antiquity or because of later plundering and destruction. In addi- tion, the length of time a tomb was used is not necessarily the same as the length of time the pottery found in it was used. Use of the tomb may have been discontinuous, and the deposition of pottery of one phase indicates only that burials were made during some part of that phase, not necessarily the whole of it. Nevertheless, in spite of these difficulties, esti- mates of both the original number of burials made in Minoan tombs and the length of time the tombs remained in use have been made. At least three methods have been employed to estimate the total number of burials in any one tomb. One, employed in estimating the burial population of tholos tombs in partic- ular, counts the number of daggers and seals in the tombs. On the assumption that these belong to mature men or heads of families, representing on average one of every five burials, it then multiplies this number by five to obtain an estimate of the total burials.25 This method requires several dubious assumptions, but its chief drawback is that daggers and seals are among the least likely objects to survive the repeated cleaning or partial plundering of a tomb, and any estimate based on this method alone will fall considerably short of the 24 Branigan, Foundations of Palatial Crete, p. 159; Cadogan and Hankey (see bibliography for No. 27, Myrtos, Pyrgos, p. 176 above). 25 Whitelaw, Minoan Society, p. 343, note 16. 251</page><page sequence="272">BURIALS AND SOCIAL RANKING mark. Another method estimates the original number of burials on the basis of the total mass of skeletal material in the tomb. Basically it constitutes a rough guess and tends to exaggerate the number of dead because the heaps of bone appear to be so great. Using this method, the excavator of Zakros A estimated that "up to 600" burials had been placed in the tomb, but a closer examination of the skeletal material and the survival of only 45 skulls (of an estimated 600 individuals) in the relatively short period of use indicate that considerably fewer burials were made in the tomb.26 A third method uses the number of skulls preserved in the tomb to estimate the original total of burials. In view of the care that Minoans took to preserve the skull, relocating it within the tomb after the removal of other bones, this method is much more likely to arrive at a figure approaching that of the original burial population. It will still fall short of that figure, however, since some skulls will have been crushed and destroyed during the prolonged use of the tomb, and the surviving number will represent only some fraction of the original. This fraction will be close to the original total in tombs that were used for a relatively short time or where some care was taken to protect and preserve the skulls, but it will be short of the total in tombs used for many hundreds of years without special containers for storing skulls. Skull counts are currently available for ten house tombs. Thirty are reported from Mochlos I and 24 from Gournia III, both of which were used in the EM IIa phase; 201 are reported from Archanes 6, which was used from the EM II to the MM Ia phase, perhaps with some interruption; 181 are reported from Archanes 19; 15 from Palaikastro VI; 97 from Palaikastro VII; 45 from Zakros A and 20 from Zakros B, all of which were used in both the MM Ia and MM Ib phases; 161 are reported from Archanes 18, which was used in the MM Ia, MM Ib, and MM II phases; and, finally, 65 are reported from Myrtos, Pyrgos, which was used from the EM III phase into the LM I phase. Since the pottery phase or phases associated with the skulls in any one of these tombs provides a certain time frame for the use of the tomb but does not indicate that it was used continuously during the whole extent of that phase, the estimated time that the tomb remained in use should depend in part on two variables: the quantity of pottery in the tomb and the number and the chron- ological span of the pottery phases represented. The greater the amount of pottery deposited in the tomb, the longer it is likely to have been used, and the fewer phases represented and the shorter their chronological span, the more likely it is that the tomb was used continu- ously. The problem is compounded, however, by the possible overlapping of certain pottery phases and by uncertainty as to the exact chronological span of some of them. In the follow- ing table, Figure 81, estimates of the number of burials made in each tomb per 100 years are computed for both the extended chronology proposed by Warren and for the shorter, more traditional chronology, in both cases on the assumption that the MM Ia phase began 100 years earlier and lasted 100 years longer in central Crete than in eastern Crete and on the assumption that the MM Ib phase continued to the end of the Protopalatial period every- where outside the palaces. An estimate of the population unit using each tomb is then calcu- lated on the basis of Bintliffs proposal that a typical nuclear family of five individuals would contribute 20 burials to a collective tomb each century.27 26 See p. 198 above. 27 Bintliff (footnote 79 above, p. 242), pp. 635-641. 252</page><page sequence="273">POPULATION UNIT Tomb Date Skull Pottery Phase Date Maximum Length Burials per Population Count Traditional/Extended of Use 100 Years Unit Mochlos I EM IIa 30 2600-2400/2900-2600 200-300 years 10-15 0.5-0.75 Gournia III EM IIa 24 2600-2400/2900-2600 200-300 8-12 0.4-0.6 Archanes 6 EM II-MM Ia 201 2600-1900/2900-1900 700-1000 20-29 1-1.45 Archanes 18 MM Ia? 95 2150-1900 250 38 1.9 Archanes 19 MM Ia/Ib 181 2150-1700 450 40 2 Zakros A MM Ia/Ib 45 2050-1700 350 13 0.65 Zakros B MM Ia/Ib 20 2050-1700 350 6 0.3 Palaikastro VI MM Ia/Ib 15 2050-1700 350 4 0.2 Palaikastro VII MM Ia/Ib 97 2050-1700 350 28 1.4 Myrtos, Pyrgos EM III-LM I 65 2200-1500/2300-1500 700-800 8-9 0.4-0.45 FIG. 81. Estimated population making use of the tombs The population estimates in this table indicate that the tombs were not by any means communal graves, but neither were they used by nuclear units. The tombs that might be expected to provide the most reliable estimates on the basis of the criteria discussed above, Archanes 18 and 19, which appear to be intact, indicate the largest population unit, 1.8 to 2 nuclear families; they should be regarded as more reliable indicators than tombs with mark- edly smaller population units, such as Zakros B or Palaikastro VI, where many skulls were probably lost. In addition, the population units at Archanes 6 and Palaikastro VII, 1.4 to 1.45, are probably both underestimated. Only three-fourths of Palaikastro VII was exca- vated, and further excavation would uncover a larger number of skulls; it is not specifically reported that Archanes 6 was used in the EM III phase, and a gap decreasing its length of use by 150 years would increase the number of burials calculated per 100 years. In both cases, then, the actual population unit might well approach that indicated by Archanes 18 and 19. The conclusion to be drawn from these data is that a population unit somewhat larger than a nuclear family used these tombs. If it were twice as large and consisted of ten individuals, it might be identified as an extended family or perhaps a fraternal organization such as a priestdom or warrior elite. It might be added that the small size of the tombs (with the exception of Chrysolakkos II) and the presence of other types of graves or additional tombs in the vicinity also indicate that only some segment of the community was buried in any one tomb. An analysis of the skeletal material in the tombs could provide a solution to the identity of the population unit. A family unit could be identified if a "natural" population, that is, a population with normal age and sex expectations representative of the population at large, were represented in the skeletal material; whereas a fraternity (or sorority), which is re- strictive by nature, would be identifiable if a significant deviation from normal age and sex distributions were represented in the skeletal material. Unfortunately, few skeletal analyses have been completed. The most extensive published to date is the study of the skeletal mate- rial from Zakros, where a natural population is represented with the exception of infants, five years old and under, who are missing from the remains. This study may be compro- mised, however, by the combination of skeletal material from two different tombs, and 253</page><page sequence="274">BURIALS AND SOCIAL RANKING while it seems unlikely, it is at least theoretically possible that the combination has obscured some deviation in the material. All males in the skeletal material may have come from one tomb, and all females from the other. Another study has been reported from Archanes: 19 individuals ranging from 5 to 45 years old were identified, including six males and five females. Again, however, the report combines skeletons from different tombs (as well as Anemospelia).28 The skeletal material from Myrtos, Pyrgos is being studied carefully and, while still unpublished, is reported to consist predominantly, perhaps exclusively, of males, with those buried in the pillar crypt accompanied by their weapons. The evidence might appear to be inconclusive, then, were it not for the frequent reports of infant burials in the tombs. They are reported specifically from Archanes 3, 6, 18, and 19, where 33 of the 181 skulls counted belonged to infants or young individuals, the House of the Dead at Mallia, Palaikastro VII, and the Temple Tomb; many more have probably gone unreported. Infant burials would seem to be the norm, and since fraternities do not normally initiate infants into their ranks, and because infant burials suggest a hereditary relationship with adult burials in the same tomb, the tombs should be identified as family tombs. The sheer number of tombs on Mochlos, 24 house tombs representing only some portion of the original num- ber of tombs, most of them in use at the same time, also points to the family as the unit of burial, at least on Mochlos, since the community could not accommodate 24 fraternities and the settlement area could probably not have accommodated many more than 300 individ- uals, or about ten individuals per tomb, each used by an extended family.29 The multiplication of tombs at sites such as Gournia, Archanes, Mallia, and Palai- kastro from only one or two tombs in the EM II phase to five or six by the end of the Prepa- latial period is also significant. It is the nature of a ruling elite in a chiefdom or monarchy to raise the status of every member of its family above that of ordinary families; consequently, as the elie family proliferates with the t passage of time, its lineage grows.30 At some point one tomb, which may have been designed for the founding elite family, even though repeat- edly cleaned, will not be able to accommodate the extended family of the elite, which has grown into several different families, all claiming descent from the original founder, each ranked according to its proximity to the main line, and each requiring burial in a house tomb. The growth of the elite lineage, then, will require the building of multiple tombs at some point. Multiple tombs will not appear only at sites that fall into decline, such as Mochlos, which appears to have been severely depopulated in the MM Ia phase and where only two large or elite tombs were ever built, or at sites founded late in the Prepalatial period, such as Myrtos, Pyrgos, and Gournes, which are probably both founded as small country villas by individuals representing offshoots of a larger elite lineage located else- where. Wherever the elite lineage prospers and the passage of time permits, however, multi- ple tombs will appear. In the MM Ib phase the elite lineage at Mallia, now a royal lineage, decided to consolidate these multiple tombs into a single monumental structure, Chrysolak- kos II, which could accommodate all the families in the royal lineage. In this respect Mallia 28 Sakellarakis, "Epyov 1986, pp. 136-137. 29 Whitelaw, Minoan Society, pp. 337-339. 30 Service (footnote 78 above, p. 242), pp. 139-140; idem, The Origins of the State and Civilization, New York 1975, pp. 78-80. 254</page><page sequence="275">SOCIAL RANKING differs from other sites such as Gournia, Palaikastro, and Zakros, where the elite was con- tent to continue using earlier and multiple tombs; Mallia probably differs from these sites too, however, in that it alone had become a truly palatial center by the MM Ib phase. If the royal tombs of other palatial centers in the MM Ib phase were discovered, it might be found that they too housed the entire royal lineage in a single monumental structure. SOCIAL RANKING By way of conclusion it may be helpful to reiterate one of the main theses of this book. Many of the house tombs, especially those in the northern and eastern part of Crete, have been identified as the tombs of a ruling elite, probably consisting of chiefs and their families in the Prepalatial period, and probably consisting of kings and a landed nobility in the palatial periods. The identification of the tombs as elite tombs, whether chiefly or royal, explains the origins of the house tomb in the EM II phase, when Minoan society was being organized along hierarchical lines; it explains the continuing use of the tombs long after other forms of burial were introduced for the masses of the population; it explains the presence of shrines at the tombs as religion became an important tool by which these priest-chiefs (later priest- kings?) consolidated their power; and it explains the multiplication of tombs towards the end of the Prepalatial period as chiefly lineages grew. The identification, then, provides a single, unifying explanation for many aspects of these tombs, as no other single explanation can, and is also consistent with anthropological theory concerning primitive social organiza- tion and the emergence of state society. This identification has been suggested by a number of different factors, the foremost being the use of different types of graves at a given site for different burials, with those belonging to the elite always more elaborate and more costly and often placed in a different location than those of the population at large.31 This distinction is particularly evident at Mochlos, Gournia, and Mallia, cemeteries that have been extensively excavated, where the contrasts are pronounced: at Mochlos, between the tombs on the West Terrace and the much smaller tombs on the South Slope; at Gournia, between the tombs in the North Ceme- tery and the simple inhumations and later pithos burials at Sphoungaras (and perhaps Pachyammos); at Mallia, between the tombs in the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres and Chrysolakkos and the rock-crevice and pithos burials along the coast. It may also be noted at Zakros in the contrast between the built tombs at Pezoules Kephalas and the many rock shelters in the Gorge of the Dead. At Archanes the contrast is complicated somewhat by the presence of a different culture burying its dead in a different type of tomb, the tholos (which may also have been used by an extended family unit); but even here numerous inhumations were made directly in the ground outside the built tombs, particularly in the area south of Tholos r and to the west of Tombs 18 and 19. Were other cemeteries at large population centers excavated as extensively as these sites, the same sort of pattern should have emerged. Further excavation at Palaikastro, for example, should be expected to uncover inhumations 31 For the methodology involved in determining social ranking from funerary data, see Soles, Problems in Greek Prehistory, pp. 49-61; J. Brown, "The Search for Rank in Prehistoric Burials," in The Archaeology of Death, New Directions in Archaeology, R. Chapman, I. Kinnes, and K.

At smaller, more isolated sites, such as the country villas, where only a single house tomb might be used to bury the occu- pants, a simpler form of burial will also be found for their dependents. In addition to the burials inside the tombs at Myrtos, Pyrgos and Gournes, direct inhumations are reported in areas outside and adjacent to the built tombs. Once the house tombs are introduced, the distinction between different types of graves persists through all phases of the Prepalatial and Protopalatial periods. The distinction begins to fade only when chamber tombs are introduced at the end of the Protopalatial period and the house tomb is supplanted by a new burial method. It does not fade completely, however, and tombs such as the Temple Tomb at Knossos and Tomb 5 at Agia Triada reflect the earlier tradition. Burial in a house tomb also involves a much more complex treatment of the deceased than burial in a lesser form of grave. This is true at the initial time of burial, when it ap- pears that the deceased was laid out in a special part of the tomb for the prothesis, and subsequently, when the skull was removed, with the offering of a conical cup, and redepos- ited with special care elsewhere in the tomb, all happening, it might be added, with accom- panying ritual carried on at the shrine of the tomb. Burials thrown in the rock crevices at Mallia, or inhumed directly in the earth at Sphoungaras or Archanes, or squeezed into pithoi at Mallia, Sphoungaras, and Pachyammos were made with considerably less effort, required no secondary treatment, and permitted the skull to decay with the rest of the body. A prothesis or lying in state, with or without gold-studded funerary trappings, is usually a mark of high rank within the community; skull retention may also be indicative of a special status.32 While there are many uses to which skulls might be put, some suggesting a com- plete disregard for the dead, their careful retention in the house tombs suggests a certain reverence and may also represent a form of ancestor worship. A chiefly lineage, stemming as it does from the founder of a community, is commonly elevated along with the founder to a semidivine status within the community, and the chiefly line, often become a priestly line, commonly intercedes "with its ancestral gods in favor of the society."33 Ancestor worship is a common feature of chiefdoms. The skulls from Gournia Tomb III, which were carefully redeposited with the addition of new offerings in the Gournia Tomb I pit 400 years after their initial interment, probably belonged to Gournia's founders and were treated with such care for exactly that reason. The builders of Archanes B may also have located a pillar crypt over a much earlier tomb (7) and carefully opened a window into that tomb from the crypt because they believed that it belonged to Archanes' founders. All skulls retained in the house tombs belonged to members of an elite class who may have been venerated at their tombs. A parallel for this kind of skull retention is found in the Myrtos shrine, Room 89, where the skull of an adult male in his twenties or thirties was "deliberately situated near the tripartite structure with central hearth" with offerings placed near by.34 It may well be the remains of a chief or even founder of the community who was venerated in the community shrine.35 32 F.

In spite of the fact that the tombs have nearly all been plundered, sufficient grave goods remain to suggest that these differences were both quantitative and qualitative. Although many of the same kinds of objects (pottery, stone vases, jewelry, weapons, seals) are found in all graves, there is always a greater concentration of such objects in the house tombs. The concentration of wealth is particularly evident at Gournia and Mochlos, where none of the burial deposits at Sphoun- garas or on the South Slope contains the same mass of wealth as that accumulated in the North Cemetery or West Terrace tombs. With the introduction of pithos burial at the end of the Prepalatial period the contrast becomes even greater, since few pithoi contain any finds at all.36 In addition, many of the grave goods from the house tombs should be regarded as prestige goods that an elite would have collected to display its power and status. These in- clude silver vases, objects of ivory, and gold and silver jewelry, which are found in many of the tombs. They also include finer pottery wares, which, although not made exclusively for the elite, were widely used by them, particularly for gift exchanges with other elite groups. The cache of incised pyxides from Gournia III, some reburied in Gournia I, or the polychrome kantharoi from Gournia I, all of which were the products of highly skilled master potters, have few, if any, parallels in the rather commonplace pottery from Sphoungaras. Similarly, the fine Kamares-style pottery found in the tombs of the Necropole des Pierres Meulieres or Chrysolakkos has no equivalent in the pottery from the rock-crevice burials along the coast.37 A few of the grave goods may also be identified as actual symbols of authority. Diadems should be recognized as such because of early parallels in the Prepalatial period in Troy and the Near East and later parallels in the Shaft Graves at Mycenae and in Crete itself. They may have had a funerary use in the prothesis, as in the Alapa Hiiyuk burial,38 but early par- allels from Troy and the Cyclades found in domestic contexts, as well as later representations in Minoan art, indicate that they were also worn by the living. Only two of approximately 15 examples from Mochlos were found outside the large tombs on the West Terrace, and, although they were not long enough to be considered diadems by Seager, coming from Tomb XIX, which was rather rich in its grave goods, they may well have belonged to a fam- ily related to the chiefly lineage. Other diadems are reported from Chrysolakkos, from sev- eral of the tombs at Archanes, and from Agia Triada 5; they are associated only with burials in built tombs at these sites and never with the burials in simpler graves. In addition to diadems, gold and stone scepter-heads were also deposited with the burials in the house tombs. The early examples are more difficult to identify than the diadems, but they too have contemporary parallels in Troy and the Near East and somewhat later in the Old Palace bones from the tomb to venerate them at religious ceremonies and afterwards returned them.

A similar but shallower gold sheathing with four pendent leaves from Mochlos Tomb V was identified by Seager as "the tip to a staff or sceptre, as its shape precludes any idea that it could be used for personal adornment" and may offer a parallel for the Gournia sheathings.40 Still another gold object from the Aigina Treasure, perhaps from Chrysolakkos, has been compared to a stone panther mace from the first palace at Mallia and identified as the "model of a ceremonial axe-head."41 In the Neopalatial period the mace appears to have been standardized in the shape of a stone hammer, and one was found in Agia Triada 5 with several parallels in the palaces and in at least one country villa of that time. Many different features, then, point to the identification of the house tombs as tombs of a ruling elite. In the palatial periods these tombs, along with the palaces and villas them- selves, provide primary evidence of Cretan hierarchical social structure; in the Prepalatial period they provide the best evidence for the chiefdoms that characterized Minoan society in central and eastern Crete from the EM II phase on. It would seem that certain areas of the Mesara had reached the same stage of social development by this time,42 and the interaction between these chiefdoms from two different cultures and different parts of the island, which may not have been always peaceful, lay behind the palatial organization of the island at the beginning of the Middle Bronze Age. 39 For the diadems and scepter-heads at Troy, see C.

It is noteworthy that, although the Mesara tombs exhibit many of the features used here to identify social ranking, none can be identified as a chiefly tomb as long as it is also identified as a communal tomb used by the entire clan. Although recognizing "the traces of societies led by village chiefs" in the remains of some tholoi, Branigan can argue only that some of the larger and richer tholoi were built "by the clans from which the village chiefs were drawn." If, on the other hand, the tholoi should prove to be family tombs, as Whitelaw has argued (Minoan Society, pp. 336-343), then some might also be identified as chiefly tombs. At sites like Koumasa, Platanos, and Porti, where small rectangular tombs were located between the larger tholoi (and Koumasa F), it is of course the smaller and poorer rectangular tombs that would belong to the general population. 258</page><page sequence="279">INDEX AFTERLIFE 226, 241, 249, 250, 251 Agia Eirene 13 Agia Kyriaki 2021, 219, 220, 223, 237, 238 Agia Photia 12, 27 Agia Triada 116, cemetery 36, 116, 230, 235, 238, sarcophagus 2032, 125, 126, 127, 227, 231, 250- 251 Neopalatial villa 116 South Building 116-119, 204, 216, 221,234, 237, 240 Tholos A 116, 119, 244, 246 Tholos B 116, 120, 122, 125 Tomb 5 115, 120-125, 208, 209, 217, 218, 223, 229, 23342, 238, 239, 241, 242, 250, 256, 257, 258 Tomb of the Painted Sarcophagus 115, 125-127, 202, 240, 246 Agios Andoni 27 Agios Georgios vii, 115, 127-129, 204, 210, 227, 240, 244 Agios Kyrillos 229, 23342, 238, 239, 244 Agios Myronos 233, 234 Agios Onouphrios 16, 34 Agrimi.
