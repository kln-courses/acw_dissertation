<plain_text><page sequence="1">286 BOOK LIST T. MuRAoKA (ed.), Melbourne Symposium on Septuagint Lexicography. Sep- tuagint and Cognate Studies 28. xvi + 136 pp. Scholars Press, Atlanta, 1990. $19.95, for members $14.95; paperback, $14.95, $9.95. The background to the symposium and its literary crystallization is the interest on the part of a number of scholars in producing a lexicon of the LXX. In this connection the editor and a colleague had already been working on a lexicon of the LXX Minor Prophets some time in advance of the symposium. Each of the participants had written an experimental lexical entry or entries on LXX words of their choice, and had cir- culated them beforehand. Four of the original six participants contribute to the present volume. The editor sketches in the background to the symposium in his Introduction, and also discusses problems associated with the lexicography of what is mostly a work of translation. He has a further chapter in which he deals with other general issues relating to LXX lexicography, examining "function words", collocations, semantic fields, unique Septuagintal usage, and the study of the LXX as a Greek document. J.A.L. Lee provides a sample entry on auv(a=,TLt, drawn ip in the way of the Oxford English Dictionary and the Oxford Latin Dictionary with definitions forming compartments which, ideally, cover exactly the examples put into them. S.P. Swinn writes on &amp;yoarav ("to love"), concluding that the "love" terminology of the LXX (and also the NT) reflects the stage of the development of the words in question within the Greek language, and is not deter- mined by other (principally theological) considerations. Finally, E. Tov addresses in "Greek Words and Hebrew Meanings" the problem that faces all would-be LXX lexicographers and that virtually supplies a sub-text to the present volume (cf., for example, Lee and Muraoka): how much attention should be paid to the underlying Hebrew when an item of LXX vocabulary is being defined? Only in the painstaking, and still provisional, researches of this kind of exercise can sound principles for LXX lexicography be established, which is reason enough to be grateful for the efforts represented in this volume. [R.P. GORDON] R.E. MURPHY, The Song of Songs. A Commentary on the Book of Canticles or the Song of Songs. Hermeneia. xxii + 237 pp. Fortress Press, Minneapolis, 1990; distributed in Britain by the SCM Press, London. Â£20. More than half of this, the most recent addition to the Hermeneia commentary series, is given over to the Introduction, in which Murphy pays particular and sympathetic attention to the book's chequered history of interpretation. Other topics fully treated include com- parisons with similar ancient Near Eastern literature, literary character and struc- ture, composition and style, and interpretation. While recognizing the limitations of our knowledge (of the pre-history of the parts of the text, for instance), Murphy finds a certain unity in the work based on the common style, use of refrains and other repeated themes. Moreover, the use of dialogue between the two principal characters suggests "at least a contrived unity" (p. 62), but not in the sense of a drama. Because he eschews speculation that goes beyond the "plain meaning" of the text, he also rules out ritual or cultic interpretations which were popular earlier in this century. The work is to be classified as "love poetry", whose setting is perhaps best regarded in the context of betrothal. Moreover, the social setting (represented by the "daughters of Jerusalem", the "watchmen", and the members of the woman's family) ensures that this is not a treatise on free love, but is contained within a sphere which "encouraged strict standards of sexual morality and marital fidelity" (p. 97). Finally, after doing full justice to the Song's major theme of "human sexual fulfillment, fervently sought and consummated in reciprocal love between woman and man" (p. 103), Murphy indicates that it is not unreasonable to see in this something of a reflection of the love of God (cf. Isa. lxii 4-5): "the love that forms human partnership and community ... is a gift of God's own self" (p. 105). The commentary itself pays full attention to the text and</page><page sequence="2">BOOK LIST philology in the "notes" (Murphy is usually conservative about textual emenda- tion, finding the chief difficulty in elucidating the work's often obscure vocabulary), whereas the "interpretation", both introductory and verse-by-verse, is concise by comparison. Murphy has published articles on the Song of Songs at regular intervals since 1954. This commentary, which represents the mature fruit of a lifetime's study, is a distinguished contribution to a prestigious series. [H.G.M. WILLIAMSON] L.

NIEHR, Rechtsprechung in Israel. Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der Gerichtsorganisation im Alten Testament. Stuttgarter Bibelstudien 130. 144 pp. Verlag Katholisches Bibelwerk, Stuttgart, 1987. DM 29.80. There have been many studies of O.T. law and its relationship to law in the rest of the ancient Near East, but surprisingly few on the processes of law and the organization of courts of justice. A monograph which deals exclusively with these latter topics is therefore particularly welcome, the more so because of the widespread use of legal ter- minology in biblical literature generally. Niehr begins with a brief consideration of general studies of legal systems and the methodological problems raised by the O.T. source-material. An account of the different legal systems attested at Mari, in Assyria and Babylon and in the remainder of Syria and Canaan then provides the context for a study of the development of legal institutions in Israel. In the "egalitarian tribal society" of the pre-monarchic period (for which Exod. xx 22- xxiii 19 is argued to provide some reliable information) Niehr holds that the pater- familias and the elders (representatives of the heads of clans) dealt with most cases, though some were referred to priests for resolution by ritual means. He finds no solid evidence for the existence of individual "judge"-figures at this time. The monarchy at first brought about only minor changes to this system, as the king's jurisdiction was limited to his immediate entourage. Only under Josiah were state judges introduced to replace the priestly jurisdiction at the defunct "high places". After the exile the "heads of fathers' houses", representing the clans, took over the roles previously exercised by the elders and paterfamilias, and the legal authority of the Jerusalem priesthood was greatly augmented. The imperial authorities were generally content not to intervene. A bibliography and an index of biblical references complete a work which offers both a synthesis of earlier study and a provocative fresh reconstruction of Israelite legal history. [G.I. DAVIES] S. OLOFSSON, God is my Rock: A Study of Translation Technique and Theological Exegesis in the Septuagint. Coniectane Biblica, Old Testament Series 31. x + 208 pp. Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, Stockholm, 1990. S. Kr. 178. This is a revised version of an Uppsala dissertation (1988). While the author has much to say about theological exegesis in the LXX in general, he is mainly interested in the Psalter. Ch. 2 deals with claimed instances of anti-anthropomorphism and anti-anthropopathism in the Greek Psalter and concedes much less to theological exegesis than have Olofsson's predecessors in this area. Most of the spadework for the volume is done in the longer chs 3 and 5, in which the translation of metaphorical designations of God ("rock", "shield", "refuge", etc.) and dif- ferent types of metaphorical divine names ("mighty One", "most high", etc.), respectively, are discussed. The last of the main chapters looks at possible backgrounds for the translation of divine names and epithets in the LXX. The work is thoroughly indexed, and there are six tables setting out translation equivalents under a number of headings. The author shows awareness of a wide 287</page></plain_text>
