<plain_text><page sequence="1">oW SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR IN ANIMALS, with Special Refer- ence to Vertebrates. By N. Tinbergen. Methuen &amp; Company, London; John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York. $2.50. xi + 150 pp. + 8 pl.; text ill. 1953. This is another fascinating book about animal behavior from one of the members of the New European school of naturalists who style themselves "ethologists." The extensive observational and experimental work of Lorenz, Tinbergen, and others is treated here in detail. Much of the material, however, is not new, and, indeed, this volume is a little anticlimactic compared with its predecessors. As in earlier volumes by Tinbergen and others of the same school, there is a strong emphasis upon the role of behavioral adaptation in evolution. Likewise, there is the usual strong emphasis upon the importance of un- learned behavior, an emphasis underscored by the almost complete absence of a discussion of mammalian behavior. Finally, again in company with the earlier books, this volume makes a strong plea for the analytic study of animal behavior under natural conditions. It is this last characteristic, I think, that makes the work of the ethologists as important as it is. This book is only loosely organized around the topic of social behavior. The problem of interaction between animals is seen primarily as a special case of release-</page><page sequence="2">200 THE QUARTERLY REVIEW OF BIOLOGY mechanisms triggering internally primed behavioral patterns. The present reviewer cannot undertake a detailed criticism of the general type of work presented in this volume. Lehrman, in a recent issue of this journal, has presented such a review. The serious student of animal behavior will want to evaluate this book in the light of Lehrman's rather trenchant criticisms. The work of Lorenz and Tinbergen has now come to the point where it is necessary to examine its weak points as well as ad- mire its great originality. In conclusion, I would like to mention the enjoyment to be found in reading this little volume. The amateur naturalist and the undergraduate student will find this book as fascinating as it must appear to the professional student of animal behavior. One is occasionally dis- turbed by the excessively anthropomorphic tone of the descriptive narrative, but this seems to the present reviewer to be largely stylistic. Indeed, the fundamental ideas behind the work of the ethologists are mechanistic and physiological in nature. JAMEs DEESE %-2r,</page></plain_text>
