Viano, and James DeCou General Motors Research Labs. Biomedical Science Dept. Warren, Ml This paper covers the development of the General Motors Energy Absorbing Steering System beginning with the work of the early crash injury pioneers Hugh DeHaven and Colonel John P. Stapp through developments and introduction of the General Motors energy absorbing steering system in 1966, evaluations of crash performance of the system, and further improvement in protective function of the steering assembly. The contributions of GM Research Laboratories are highlighted, including its safety research program, Safety Car, Invertube, the biomechanic projects at Wayne State University, and the thoracic and abdominal tolerance studies that lead to the development of the Viscous Injury Criterion and self-aligning steering wheel. Also discussed are engineering efforts of the Saginaw Steering Gear and Oldsmobile Divisions, the extensive testing program at the GM Proving Ground, government interactions and regulations, and the field accident reports of the many lives saved by Energy Absorbing Steering Systems. THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY HAD BEEN INTERESTED in safety long before the introduction of the Energy Absorbing (EA) Steering System in 1966. General Motors developed such early safety features as the speedometers first installed on 1901 Oldsmobiles and the first electric headlamps on their 1908 models. In the 20's and 30's, dashboard lights, electric windshield wipers, dual tail lamps, electric turn signals and steel body structures were also introduced. The auto industry's first proving ground was opened by GM at Milford, Michigan in 1924, and the first barrier impact tests and rollover tests were conducted there in 1934 to evaluate the structural crashworthiness of their automobiles (Yanik 1983). During these early days of automotive safety engineering and through the 1950's, the emphasis was on accident avoidance, handling and braking, but to a lesser degree on crash impact engineering of vehicle interiors. Highway safety advocates, the courts, and the general public were convinced that if cars were designed for safe normal operation, drivers were well trained and licensed, and roadside hazards were removed, then few if any accidents would occur (Eastman 1973). However, accidents were occurring and people were being killed and injured by impacting interior structures such as the instrument panel, windshield and steering assembly. At least a half dozen patents for compressible steering systems appeared in the late 20's and 30's (Figure 1), but these ideas were not developed at the time because of the lack of measures for impact protection and the common attitude that the best way to avoid injuries was to eliminate accidents. The effect of interior structural design on accident pathology was first studied in small aircraft crashes. When airplanes first got off the ground, most pilots believed that accidents were a part of operating these machines and that injuries sustained in the accidents were attributed to either bad luck or acts of God. In 1917, when a young American cadet named Hugh DeHaven (1969) in the Canadian Royal Flying Corps suggested to his Commanding Officer that "the luck could be changed by better engineering and design," the officer told him that "the hand had been dealt as it was and that changing anything would amount to stacking the deck." He also told the cadet "that flying was dangerous and the best way to prevent injuries was to stay on the ground." DeHaven had recently sustained serious abdominal injuries in a crash that killed the other three cadets involved. He realized that he survived because his was the only cockpit that remained relatively intact (Hasbrook 1964). He also identified the narrow pointed buckle on his safety belt as the cause of his near-fatal injuries (DeHaven 1969). It was then that DeHaven first considered the concept of designing the plane for crash survival and proposed a crash injury research program. DeHaven's ideas were rejected by a) the pilots who thought that accidents were all due to fate, b) the safety groups who said that money used for research would save more lives if it were put into extra pilot training, and c) those who considered the human body to be a fragile object that would be cut in two by a safety belt. DeHaven (1969) 1818</page><page sequence="2">could not easily disprove these first two points, but he had witnessed enough airplane and automobile crashes to know that the body could withstand tremendous forces under certain conditions. To demonstrate the strength of the human body, in 1938 DeHaven began an engineering and pathological study of survival in falls from heights of 50 to 150 feet. He presented eight of these cases in 1942 in the American Medical Association's journal, War Medicine. In this paper, DeHaven (1980) stated that "the fact that these survivals occurred when the necessary factors were accidentally contributed is strong evidence of the large increase in safety which can be provided by design." This study was the catalyst that gained him the support of the Civil Aeronautics Board and the National Research Council in setting up the Crash Injury Research (C I R) project at Cornell University Medical College in 1942 (DeHaven 1969). DeHaven's first work at CIR was a field study of injuries in non-fatal small plane crashes. He reported his initial findings to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers in 1943 in which he stated two main conclusions: "(a) The force of many accidents now fatal is well within physiological limits of survival" and "(b) Needless injuries- both serious and fatal- are caused by the unfortunate placement and design of certain objects and structures." He identified the control wheel as a structure causing intrathoracic lesions in crashes, and also called for the support of physicians in assisting accident investigators in a 1946 editorial to The Journal of the American Medical Association (DeHaven 1946). By 1950, the effect of DeHaven's work could be seen in the numerous crash survival design features in new airplanes (Hasbrook 1964). Several physicians were becoming interested in this idea of injury reduction through design, especially in automobiles. Detroit plastic surgeon Dr. Claire L. Straith was well aware of what the car interior could do to the human body in an accident and added seat belts and crash padding to his own car as early as the 1930's. He achieved only limited success, however, with automobile manufacturers in implementing his ideas (Eastman 1973). Dr. Fletcher D. Woodward of the University of Virginia Hospital called for specific design changes in his "Medical Criticism of Modern Automotive Engineering" presented at the annual meeting of the American Medical Association in 1948. Woodward (1948) demonstrated among other things that "crushing injuries to the chest of the driver occur when he is driven against the steering wheel," and recommended the installation of a hydraulic steering column that would move forward on impact. By the mid-50's, more physicians had begun discussing ways to combat automobile accident injuries, including Drs. Jacob Kulowski Í1955) of St. Joseph, Missouri, C. Hunter Shelden Í1955) of Pasadena, California, and Horace E. Lampbell (1954) of Denver, Colorado. Campbell was critical of automobile manu- facturers for not following the example of the aircraft industry, although several of the changes made in cockpits were also seen in car interiors by the early 50's, such as better positioning of instrument panel control knobs (Gandelot 1951). In his paper "Deceleration, Highway Mortality, and the Motorcar," Campbell (1954) alleged that "it is possibly about time that we build the motorcar to crash," although GM had been running barrier impact and rollover tests for 20 years to study the crashworthiness of its cars. He also stated: "Motorcar manufacturers advertise at great cost the thrills and satisfactions of increased acceleration. It is time that they point out in their advertising the Figure 1: Three examples of compressible steering assembly patents from the 1930's. 1819</page><page sequence="3">even more abiding satisfaction of controlled deceleration." In 1955, however, the widespread idea that "safety doesn't sell" was emerging, as the safety-promoting campaign of Ford Motor Company's Robert McNamara was dropped after only three months, when Ford sales fell further behind those of its' stylish competitors (Eastman 1973). At that time, consumers wanted style and performance, and as sales showed, safety was not an important selling point. Another physician who was interested in crash injury research and the effects of mechanical force on living tissues was Air Force Colonel John P. Stapp (Figure 2), an M.D. with a Ph.D. in biophysics. From 1946 to 1958, he studied the effects of deceleration on both humans and animals at two facilities he established for the Air Force. Stapp exposed belt restrained volunteers including himself to deceleration forces of up to 40 times the force of gravity (40 g) using rocket sleds at the Aeromedicai Facility at Edwards Air Force Base in California (Stapp 1966) and the Aeromedicai Field Laboratory at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico (Snyder 1970). This work produced invaluable data for design engineers and also aroused tremendous interest in impact research (Hasbrook 1964). Stapp became involved in automobile crash research at the Holloman facility in 1953 and two years later, he invited the seat belt standards committee of the Society of Automotive Engineers and others involved in crash research to view car crash experiments and other demonstrations. This was the first Stapp Car Crash Conference, which is now an annual event (Eastman 1973). In 1948, Corporal Elmer C. Paul of the Indiana State Police, in talking with a representative of Hugh DeHaven's Crash Injury Research about small plane crashes, became interested in undertaking a similar project on automobile accidents. By 1951, with the help of CIR, Paul had set up a statewide study of rural fatal accidents. In a 1952 report on 495 of these accidents, 50% were classed as survi- vable and the steering wheel assembly was iden- tified as a major cause of fatal injuries (Eastman 1973). Although it had its weaknesses, DeHaven was impressed with the Indiana project, and together with Paul, representatives of the automobile manufacturers, and officials of several states, set up a nationwide study of injury- producing accidents. This would be the first large scale acquisition of automobile field accident statistics. In March, 1954, this project became Automotive Crash Injury Research (ACIR) located at the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory in Buffalo, New York and headed by John O. Moore (Eastman 1973). Two developments within ACIR were instru- mental in arousing public interest in automobile safety and convincing the manufacturers to design and build protective interiors. In 1952, Liberty Mutual Insurance Company of Boston contracted with Edward R. Dye of the Cornell Aeronautical Laboratory to develop several automobile safety concepts and combine them into a crash-proof car capable of withstanding a 50 mph impact. Of the 88 safety features on the "Cornell-Liberty Safety Car" (Figure 3), there was a hydraulic steering mechanism controlled by levers and covered with a large chest pad. The car's design was announced in 1956 and a prototype was built and put on display, receiving much publicity (Cornell, 1957). A second car, "Survival Car II", was designed and built by Cornell for Liberty Mutual in 1961 and featured a deformable steering assembly (Figure 4). In 1955, ACIR made its first attempt to rank injury causes. The steering assembly was found to be the leading cause of injury based on exposure, frequency of injury, and degree of injury (Schwimmer, Wolf 1962). This initial report and others that followed from ACIR (1961) that similarly identified the steering assembly helped focus the priorities of automobile manufacturers. Once the auto industry had sufficient understanding of the issues and had public support, work was begun to introduce an energy-absorbing steering system and other safety items into their products. DESIGN QUESTIONS In designing an energy absorbing steering system, many questions had to be answered. The first and most important was whether or not a compressible steering system would improve driver safety. It was known from ACIR (1961) studies and other reports in the mid-50's (White 1955) that the number of injuries and fatalities experienced by drivers was significantly less than by right front passengers, especially in mild to moderate accidents. This was supported by an ACIR report at the Ninth Stapp Conference in 1965 that specifically compared the injuries sustained by the driver and the right front passenger in injury-producing accidents in which both occupants were present (Kihlberg 1965). The conventional steering system was therefore acting as a safety device by providing restraint to the driver in certain crashes. If the steering system were to simply collapse, the driver would respond like the right front passenger since his head would be free to interact with the windshield and instrument panel. Many studies, however, including one by ACIR in 1961 and another by Donald F. Huelke and Paul W. Gikas (1965) of the University of Michigan Medical School, have shown that in more serious accidents, the driver was sustaining very serious and often fatal injuries to the thorax due to impacting the steering system. The ideal steering system therefore should stay intact in mild to moderate accidents in which the load to the chest is below a certain injury threshold in order to restrain the driver, and in severe crashes it should compress and absorb the impact energy while limiting the load to a level just below that which causes injury. An important question immediately arose - What was this load limit for the chest? In 1959, when GM began its work on EA steering systems, there was a general lack of knowledge on the survival parameters of the human body. Important work had been done by DeHaven and Stapp and a few others, but there was much more that needed 1820</page><page sequence="4">Figure 2: Colonel John P. Stapp. Figure 3: Cornell-Liberty Safety Car. Figure 4: Liberty Mutual "Survival Car II." 1821</page><page sequence="5">to be learned about the tolerance of specific body regions for impact and restraint loadings. In order to obtain this needed data, the General Motors Research Laboratories (GMR) became involved in biomechanics research. Another question at the time concerned the rearward axial displacement of the steering column relative to the passenger compartment during severe frontal collisions. In an impact to a rigid barrier, if the vehicle front end was crushed sufficiently to deform the frame, the steering gear and attached shaft would come to a stop before the passenger compartment, thus causing relative movement of the shaft towards the driver. The question concerned whether or not this was detrimental to the driver. Some people argued that the collision of the car with the barrier, the so-called first collision, occurred before the second collision between the driver and the steering wheel, and thus the relative rearward displacement of the column aided in restraining the driver (Abersfeller 1965). However, Snyder (1953) reported that "axial movement of the steering column as a result of crash impact is not unusual, and such movement is potentially dangerous." This question was not even fully answered when Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard Number 204 limiting steering control rearward displacement was issued (NTSA 1967). Besides these questions of safety and bio- mechanics, there were also many engineering questions that had to be answered. The most important consideration for the engineers was that the steering system still had to fulfill its main function - that of steering the car. Keeping this in mind, they could then think about the problems of designing the system to absorb energy in a crash. First, the EA element could be put in the wheel, column, or vehicle structures, and if the column were used, various column components could function as the energy absorber. The steering column is made up of the shaft, which connects the steering wheel to the steering gear, the shift tube in some columns, which connects the gear shift lever to the transmission, and the mast jacket, which gives structural support to the column and attaches it to the instrument panel. If, for example, the EA element were in the mast jacket, the shaft and the shift tube would have to telescope and the instrument panel attachment would have to release to allow the assembly to compress. Also, there are many different mechanisms for absorbing energy, each having unique force-displacement relationships, vibrational and inertial properties, torsional strengths, and many other parameters. These and numerous other engineering questions had to be answered during the developmental stages of this project. INITIAL GM INVOLVEMENT In the early 1950's, Charles W. Gadd of the General Motors Research Laboratories became convinced of the need for General Motors to develop a crash injury research program and that GMR was the corporate unit where this should be carried out. In 1955, the Special Problems Department utilized its experience with transient vibration theory, its rapid computation facilities, and its strain gage and vibration instrumentation to carry out a project for improving the design of dash pads and other features for increasing highway crash protection. This was among the first scien- tific investigation within GM to design the car interior to protect occupants in the event of a crash. Safety research activities intensified at GMR in 1959 including methods of controlled energy absorption, a means of absorbing energy while limiting the load involved to some maximum value, and maintaining this value throughout the range of displacement. This was considered an ideal load- displacement curve from the standpoint of efficiency, because for a given maximum load, energy absorption, which is the area under the curve, would be maximized for a given displacement. This led to the invention of the Invertube, a ductile, thin-walled aluminum or steel tube which is progressively turned inside out when loaded axially (Figure 5). Three different configurations for gripping and inverting these tubes were developed (Figure 6). All three types of Invertubes (Kroell Ì962) were made up in various dimensions and tested on a new gravity drop impact testing facility (Figure 7). The potential usefulness of the Invertube as an energy absorbing device was immediately recognized and incorporated into an experimental energy absorbing steering wheel (Figure 8). The assembly incorporated an Invertube in the wheel hub to minimize the inertia forces the driver had to overcome to initiate compression, and included a flat wheel with a large rigid padded hub zone to provide maximum contact area for distributing the load. Prototypes were tested on a newly designed drop test apparatus, in which an angled simulated body block was dropped on a vertically mounted wheel/column assembly (Figure 9). the compressible wheel proved to be markedly superior to a conventional wheel also tested on the facility, based on acceleration-time histories recorded by transducers in the body block. The test was unrealistic, however, because the momentum vector of the falling body block was directed along the column axis. Tests were then set up at the Proving Ground in which an anthropomorphic dummy was dropped on an experimental wheel/column assembly inclined to the dummy's momentum vector (Figure 10). The assembly did not compress axially but instead experienced bending failure (Figure 11). The wheel was redesigned for added bending strength and in subsequent tests, axial compression was achieved without bending. 1822</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5: Progressive stages of Invertube formation and inversion. ft" tr i - SS"""* SS«ir' T~ 'l M i SS«ir' ¡¡feil r . p p II ^jéí ¿É- ,_^llfc Figuře 6: Three Invertube configurations developed by Kroell. 1823</page><page sequence="7">Figure 7: Invertube drop test facility.

The Snubber test was originated at the Proving Ground in 1955 as a means of testing one vehicle component at a time without the costly destruction of an entire car in a barrier impact test (Stonex and Skeel 1963). In this test, a stripped-down car with a reinforced frame, equipped with the experimental steering assembly and a dummy driver, had its rear end connected by a long cable to a hydraulic energy absorbing device called a Snubber (Figure 14). This test vehicle was brought up to speed by a tow car connected by a breakaway link. When it got to the end of the cable, the test car was quickly decelerated by the Snubber with a deceleration pulse that could be regulated between 3 g and 35 g. The deceleration-time curves were very similar to those measured in barrier tests. This in-vehicle testing was found to be more realistic compared with drop tests for steering system impact evaluation. During 1959, to demonstrate the feasibility of possible safety improvements and promote their crash injury research program, the Special Problems Department designed and built a concept car from a 1959 Buick that incorporated 24 safety features, Figure 11: Failed Invertube wheel after dummy drop test. Figure 12: Installation of Invertube wheel into Snubber car. Figure 13: Deformed wheel after Snubber test. Figure 14: Proving Ground Snubber test facility. 1825</page><page sequence="9">including an Invertube compressible steering wheel (Figure 15). Stylistically, the wheel was designed by the GM Styling Section with the large flat hub area specified by Special Problems (Figure 16). The car was displayed in late 1959 along with demonstrations of the Invertube and the compressible wheel (Figures 17 and 18). GM executives in attendance were impressed with these innovative concepts and expressed interest in the further development of several of the ideas, especially the compressible steering system. With the support of the Corporation and after having viewed the GMR display themselves, Saginaw Steering Gear engineers began work to incorporate the Invertube as an energy absorbing element in the steering column. Whereas Special Problems had incorporated the Invertube in the steering wheel, Saginaw moved it into the column as part of the steering shaft for two reasons. The first was simply that Saginaw made columns, not wheels. Second, by locating the compressible element in the shaft below the instrument panel, the relative rearward displacement of the steering column during severe frontal crush could be controlled while still absorbing the energy of the driver. Such placement also was a means for controlling bending loads applied to the invertube element. GM Research continued the testing of its EA steering wheel design in 1960 using both drop tests and Snubber tests. However, after Saginaw Steering Gear became involved, the Special Problems Department helped them get started running Snubber tests and then relinquished further engineering work to them because of their greater manpower and unmatched experience with the steering system. Special Problems, in a joint venture with Wayne State University's Biomechanics Laboratory, then began work on a task of equal importance to the development of the EA Steering System - that of determining the tolerance of the human chest to frontal (anteroposterior) impact loading. ENGINEERING DEVELOPMENT Saginaw Steering Gear was the General Motors division responsible for most of the engineering work on the Energy Absorbing Steering Column. After seeing the Invertube with its nearly constant load-displacement characteristics and its application in GMR's compressible steering wheel, Saginaw engineers decided to incorporate this safety feature into their product. Their first idea in early 1960 for attaching the steering shaft to an Invertube is shown in Figure 19. However, this shaft had much too large a diameter to be practical in a steering column. It was redesigned to fit inside a column assembly (Figure 20), and in mid 1960, prototypes of this shaft were built and tested by Saginaw. The Invertube steering shafts were not tested for their dynamic axial compression and energy absorption characteristics until they were tested for the more important function of steering the car. The shafts were tested statically for axial load and torsional yield and dynamically for torsional fatigue. A major problem with the early designs was the attachment of the steel shaft to the aluminum Invertube. In 1960, Saginaw attempted to make a solid aluminum shaft that would be continuous with the hollow Invertube (Figure 21). They first tried a soft aluminum shaft but it failed the static torsion tests. A shaft of harder aluminum passed the static tests but failed the torsional fatigue tests. These designs were never snubber tested because they were not considered functionally adequate for steering the car. A steel shaft and aluminum Invertube design was finally found that performed well in the torsion tests and also exhibited desirable energy absorption properties in dynamic tests. The next step was to design the other components of the column to allow the shaft to carry out its energy absorption function. The shift tube and mast jacket were both designed as two overlapping parts that would telescope under relatively low axial loads. The instrument panel mounting bracket was designed as a simple breakaway element between the column and panel. These components were also tested for their performance under both normal and impact conditions. By late summer, 1960, a complete steering column assembly was drawn up (Figure 22), ready for in-vehicle testing. Toward the end of 1960 with the help of GMR's Special Problems Department, Saginaw ran the first snubber test of the Invertube Column prototype at the Proving Ground. It was designed to compress up to 6 inches at a load of 650 pounds. A 1959 Oldsmobile snubber car carried an unrestrained Sierra 165 pound dummy driver containing two accelerometers in the head and four in the chest. The car was snubbed at 26.5 mph causing a 19 g deceleration peak for the car. The dummy chest experienced a 38.6 g peak. The impact of the dummy bent the column and caused it to jam on the instrument panel (Figure 23) after only 1.25 inches of compression. The instrument panel mounting was reworked to reduce interference for the second test, but the column again only compressed 1.25 inches as it bent and jammed this time on the dash bracket. For the third snubber test, the column mount was modified by adding a track and roller guide system (Figure 24) which allowed up to 5 inches of compression. This system solved the problems of bending and dash interference, and the column compressed the maximum distance available. This iterative process of testing and redesigning continued as many more experimental Invertube Columns were snubber tested at the Proving Ground during 1961 and the first half of 1962. By early 1962, the Invertube Column was performing fairly well in the snubber tests and appeared to be the EA steering system that would eventually go into production. In anticipation of this demand for Invertubes, cold extrusion dies and aluminum tubing were ordered from Alcoa, Aluminum Company of America. These Invertube- forming dies had to be specially made and took about a year to produce, slowing the development process. 1826</page><page sequence="10">WHEEL RIM OF CONTOURED SECTION and Figure 15: 1959 GMR Safety Car. softer material (for f.«* injury) ' !

The car was driven and evaluated by GM engineers for six months, after which the column was removed and examined for fatigue damage. GM executives and the carlines were impressed with the installation and encouraged Saginaw to continue their development work. Cadillac Motor Division became so interested in the project that they ordered some columns previously tested by Saginaw to be rebuilt for testing in their own laboratory. A new method for analyzing steering system impact began to be used in 1963 as testing and design modification of the Invertube Column continued. In 1962, the Proving Ground installed the Impact Sled (Figure 25) originally to test seat belts and later expanded to test other safety features (Cichowski 1963). This vehicle crash simulator, the first of its kind in the auto industry, consisted of a car body buck containing anthropomorphic dummies mounted to a sled on a track (Figure 26). The sled was accelerated backwards by firing a high pressure air piston, causing the stationary dummy driver to be impacted by the moving steering assembly. This simulated a barrier crash by exposing the dummies to the same dynamic loading conditions as would have occurred in such a collision having a deceleration-time pulse and velocity change of equal amplitude but opposite direction to those of the sled test. The Impact Sled was more repeatable and much less costly than the barrier impact, although barrier tests were still necessary to analyze rearward relative column displacement due to front end crush. Being an indoor facility illuminated by 64 floodlights, the Impact Sled was superior to the Snubber because it could be operated independent of outside weather and lighting conditions. It also made possible more precise instrumentation for data accumulation. During the development of the EA Column, such a large number of sled tests had to be run that a sled test simulator had to be constructed (Cichowski 1963). The simulator consisted of a hammer, divided into seven load areas to represent different regions of the torso, dropped on a steering system aligned to a proper driver/column angle. By 1963, Saginaw engineers were aiming for a compression load of 1000 pounds, which the Invertube was capable of achieving. However, when it was dimensioned to the proper wall thickness and diameter to reach this load, the torsional strength was reduced to a level well below anything that had ever been used to steer a full-sized car. Other problems were also appearing. In some impact tests, the tube wall tore causing the column to simply collapse without absorbing energy. In other tests, if the dummy struck the wheel sufficiently off center, there was a tendency for the telescoping jacket to bind up and not compress. Also, there was concern about a potential danger of the Invertube separating from the shaft, possibly due to electrolytic corrosion between the aluminum and steel parts, thus leaving the driver without steering.

CO^ESSO«-^ Figure 26: Impact Sled set-up. For these reasons, the Invertube steering shaft design was dropped in early 1964, and all the dies received from Alcoa were scrapped. Although the Invertube Column never made it past the experimental stage, it was very important in the development of the EA Column that eventually did go into production, because it set up certain technical design considerations: 1) provide approximately 6 inches of compression distance; 2) eliminate binding of telescoping components; 3) allow passage of the column under the instrument panel; 4) preserve steering function after moderate frontal impact; and 5) provide a strong mounting to minimize bending effects influencing axial compression (Marquis 1967). Saginaw engineers also decided from the work on the Invertube shaft that the energy absorbing element should be in the mast jacket, because the shaft and shift tube already performed specific moving functions whereas the mast jacket only had a static support function under normal conditions. Saginaw had investigated a few other methods of energy absorption during their involvement with the Invertube System, so when that project was dropped, they already had some knowledge of alternative mechanisms. In early 1960, they tried pressing a hexagonal shaft into a round tube (Figure 27) which showed good torque capacity, but its compression load of 3000 pounds was too high to be used in an EA steering column. A second design attempt was a jacket with slits cut longitudinally, resulting in local expansion of the diameter when compressed axially (Figure 28). Figure 27: Hexagonal shaft into round tube. Figure 28: Japanese Lantern jacket. 1830</page><page sequence="14">Called the Japanese Lantern, the design was first conceived in 1960 by a Saginaw engineer originally assigned to the project. It was not tested however, until August, 1963 when a technician at the Proving Ground asked for permission to work on an EA column design during his spare time. It was then that he ran the first tests of the Japanese Lantern on the Impact Sled. Another design was tried in late 1964 in which a mast jacket of two concentric interfering tubes would absorb energy when it telescoped (Figure 29). By this time, however, most of the testing at the Proving Ground and design work at Saginaw was going into development of the Japanese Lantern concept. By early 1965, Saginaw had defined what they thought were the necessary parameters for implementing the Japanese Lantern mast jacket in an EA steering column (Figure 30). In early 1965, Saginaw Steering Gear presented a Japanese Lantern design to the Corporation that would compress up to 6 inches under a 700 pound load. A week later, an Impact Sled and Barrier Crash testing program was set up for this column at the Proving Ground. These tests were proposed for mid 1965 but before they could be run, a telescoping shift tube and steering shaft had to be designed. The first shift tube design consisted of two concentric tubes joined by a press fit hexagonal overlap for torsional stability during normal function (Figure 31). This had problems with space and durability so other designs were attempted (Figure 32). Finally, a telescoping design containing two key-hole stamped recesses (Figure 33) injected with acetal resin plastic for torsional and axial integrity was settled upon. An axial force of approximately 100 pounds was required to shear the plastic keys and allow telescoping to occur (Marquis 1967). The proposed steering shaft, known as the "Double D", was made up of two rods with cold- formed, half-rounded ends connected by a tubular element that was magnetically shrunk in place (Figure 34). This design allowed the shaft to telescope when loaded from either end, and maintained steering function after compression had occurred. However, excessive shaking problems were discovered in testing, prompting the development of other designs (Figure 35). Although not ready for the mid 1965 tests, a flattened upper shaft in a flattened lower tubular shaft design was settled on in the Fall of 1965 (Figure 36). Plastic was injected into the annular space to eliminate noise caused by looseness at the connection (Marquis 1967). After the testing of the Japanese Lantern Column was completed, the results were carefully examined. A compressed column assembly from one of these tests is shown in Figure 37. The column performed well in reducing steering column load on the dummy and limiting relative rearward displacement, but it was not known if 6 inches was enough compression distance when load was applied to both ends by occupant contact and front-end deformation. In a July meeting it was decided that more compression was better, so the 6 inch Figure 29: Telescoping EA jacket. Figure 30: Complete column with Japanese Lantern. Figure 31: Telescoping shift tube with hexagonal overlap. Figure 32: Other telescoping shift tube designs. 1831</page><page sequence="15">distance was increased to 8 inches (Figure 38). It was also decided that jacket diameters of 1-1/2 inches, 2 inches, and 2-3/8 inches accommodated all GM models. A meeting between engineers from Saginaw Steering Gear and other parts of the Cor- poration defined that as much as 11 inches of compression distance might be needed to prevent rearward displacement and provide energy absorption for all GM cars and light trucks. It was then decided that they would simultaneously pursue programs of 8 inch and 11 inch compression distances. In order to make the EA Steering System available on 1967 models, which came out in September of 1966, preparation had to be made immediately in order to tool the plant for production. The Corporation suggested that since the Japanese Lantern performed reasonably well in tests, that Saginaw begin tooling for that design with a 6 inch compression distance. However, the engineers argued convincingly that more development was needed, so the design and testing iteration continued. ^ / 7 I ^ D==0 oc= ) v ' &lt; Figure 33: Key-hole stamped recesses in shift tube sections.

This prompted revised designs of the Japanese Lantern idea (Figure 39), which eventually led to the development of the diamond-shaped Mesh Column jacket in the Fall of 1965 (Figure 40). The Mesh Column with its multiple convolutions was an improvement over the Japanese Lantern in that the compressed diameter was not as large, and also that another convolution could be added if more compression distance was found to be needed. In late 1965, the Corporation approved Saginaw Steering Gear tooling for a 10-1/2 inch compressing Mesh Column with six convolutions (Figure 41). Two months later, however, a need for more structural stability led to the reduction from six to five convolutions, which lowered the compression distance to 8-1/4 inches (Figure 42). Not only did the jacket have to be redesigned, but so did the steering shaft and the shift tube. Also, a substantial amount of production equipment had to be scrapped. The design was finally completed by the end of 1965 for the first Energy Absorbing Steering Column, to be produced by General Motors for its 1967 model cars and also those of Chrysler and American Motors. The final design comprised: 1) the Mesh Column mast jacket (Figure 43), which would compress up to 8-1/4 inches at loads of approximately 500 pounds; 2) the three-piece telescoping shift tube (Figure 44), held together by injected plastic keys that would shear under a 150 pound axial load; and 3) the telescoping steering shaft (Figure 45), which was similar to the design settled on earlier (Figure 36). The instrument panel mounting bracket (Figure 46) was held in place at three attachment points by injected plastic keys, which would shear under relatively small loads, allowing displacement in the forward direction only. A design issue for the system was that the load to initiate compression would be the sum of the compression load of the mast jacket, the load to break the plastic keys of the shift tube, the shaft, and the bracket, and the inertia load needed to accelerate the upper mass of the wheel/column assembly. This summed load was higher than the compressive force of the column, but it became possible to sequence the breakaway and yield so the maximum load was significantly less than the sum. A static load-compression diagram for the Mesh Column (Figure 47) demonstrates this sequence as it relates to column displacement. Dynamic loading averages the peaks and valleys to give more of a square curve, but the relative spacing of the events does not change (Marquis 1967). Another major issue with the column was the large number of different column assemblies that had to be designed, tooled and produced. Since the 1967 models did not undergo a major body change, the columns had to be fitted to available structures, which precluded standardization. There Figure 39: Revised Jacket designs.

Figure 42: 8-1/2" compressing mesh jacket with five convolutions. 1833</page><page sequence="17">were also many special features that added to the number of necessary assemblies. Whereas some steering assemblies were fixed and not adjustable, there were others that could tilt up and down for driver comfort, and others still that could not only tilt but also telescope axially. Most cars had the gear-shift lever on the steering column and a shift tube inside the mast jacket, but some sportier models with manual transmissions had the gear-shift mounted on the floor and thus had no shift tube. Most cars had rearward mounted gearboxes and crushed as shown in Figure 48, but others had forward mounted gearboxes and required an additional telescoping section in the shaft, as shown in Figure 49 (Skeels 1966). These various factors combined with the numerous different models that had to be equipped led to the large number of assemblies that had to be designed, tooled, and produced. The task of tooling a plant for production of the new EA Steering Column was a tremendous one, especially with the large number of different assemblies and parts and the short amount of time available. For all of the cars using the new column, including those of Chrysler and American Motors, 101 column assemblies comprised of over 1100 different parts were needed. To produce all of these assemblies, a completely new 570,000 square foot plant facility employing 1400 workers was constructed in Saginaw, and more than 300 pieces of major capital equipment were purchased. Dies, molds, fixtures, and other special assembly equipment had to be purchased for 600 different parts. Another 400 parts were produced by and purchased from over 100 vendors. Fulfilling these needs required a major effort from construction workers, machine tool builders, vendors, and various skilled trade shops, especially considering their already heavy workload during this period of a booming economy. Coordinating this effort was truly remarkable in that it was mostly accomplished within the six month period between the finalization of the design at the end of 1965 and the beginning of production in June, 1966. The 1967 model year automobiles with the new General Motors EA Steering System (Figure 50) were introduced in September, 1966. EARLY BIOMECHANICS AT GMR When GM Research became involved with the development of their Invertube Steering Wheel Assembly in 1959, they recognized the need for basic biomechanics data on the human body, especially for the chest. This information was needed by engineers working on EA steering systems in order to set the load at which the system should yield and deform. The concept was adopted that the steering system should remain intact at relatively low loads that do not cause injury to the chest, but compress and absorb impact energy to keep chest loads below injury tolerance. Once this injury tolerance was known, the steering system could be engineered to compress at a slightly lower load. RIPORI IMPACT 1 I I - ' 1 I {&amp;&amp;£?

The tests would be carried out at the Biomechanics Research Center in cooperation with the Wayne State Medical School. The Wayne State Biomechanics Research Center was started in 1939 when Drs. E.S. Gurdjian and J.E. Webster, neurosurgeons at the Medical School, teamed up with Professor H.R. Lissner of the College of Engineering to perform concussion experiments on animals (Stapp 1964). Professors Lissner and Lawrence M. Patrick, then directors of the Center, were approached about GMR's proposed drop tests. They were quite interested in the project and subsequently became biomechanics consultants to GMR. A decision was made for GMR to design and build a full-scale crash simulator that would be used at Wayne State to expose cadavers to actual collision conditions. The design and construction process took many months to complete, but in early 1963, after some trial tests at GMR, the crash simulator was moved to Wayne State and installed at the College of Engineering. The crash simulator was composed of a test sled riding on rails mounted to a heavy, rigid base (Figure 51). The sled could be used for either a cadaver or dummy and was equipped with an automobile bench seat, an inclined toe board, and load cell supported impact targets for the head, chest, and knees - all of which were adjustable (Figure 52). A large air cylinder, supplied through a quick-acting valve from an accumulator, was used to accelerate the sled through a ten foot stroke. The piston and rod assembly of the cylinder was then stopped by means of an Invertube, allowing the sled to coast at constant velocity for several feet. Either a large Invertube or a hydraulic piston was impacted by the sled at the end of the track, bringing it to a stop within three feet or less. Design capacities for the simulator were a maximum sled velocity of 40 miles per hour and a maximum deceleration rate of 35 g for a 1600 pound sled (Kroell, Patrick 1964).

The tri-axial load cells supporting the impact targets had to be specially designed, fabricated, and tested. The many transducers for measuring the displacement, velocity, deceleration, and decelerative force of the sled and the accelerations, stresses, and strains at numerous points on the cadaver or dummy all had to be wired into the main instrumentation consoles (Figure 53). Providing the proper transducer responses and working out the bugs in this extensive instrumentation proved to be quite a large task. Also, the hydraulic decelerator was not giving the desired square wave pulse and had to be reworked by the manufacturer, during which time the Invertube decelerator was used. When the simulator seemed to be functioning properly, dummy tests were run as a final check of the completed test equipment. The first full-scale impact tests of human cadavers were run at Wayne State on the crash simulator in early 1964. New problems were encountered with cadaver subjects. These included providing articulation of the normally stiff joints in the anatomically embalmed subjects. Physical manipulation was necessary to obtain realistic movement. Also, a special chest deflectometer was developed to measure the compression of the rib cage (Figure 54). Initial studies concentrated on skeletal damage to the knee-thigh-hip complex. When Charles Kroell of GMR and Professor Patrick of Wayne State first reported on the crash simulator at the Eighth Stapp Conference in October, 1964, they presented some of their early results on the leg. Figure 51: Crash simulator at Wayne State. Figure 52: Cadaver positioned on sled. Figure 53: Instrumentation consoles for crash simulator. Figure 54: Cadaver fitted with chest deflectometer. 1836</page><page sequence="20">By the end of 1964, the biomechanic studies at Wayne State were concentrating on the more complicated and important matter of chest impact. The first studies looked at static loading of the chest using both cadavers (Figure 55) and human volunteers (Figure 56). Dynamic loading of the chest was then analyzed by testing cadavers on the crash simulator at impact speeds up to 23 miles per hour. Figure 57 shows a photographic time history of one of these chest impact runs which also included targets for measuring knee and head impact loads. The test shown was at 16.8 mph sled velocity and produced a maximum chest load of 1350 pounds and a maximum chest deflection of 1.7 inches. Preliminary results on the tolerance of the chest were presented in October, 1965 at the Ninth Stapp Conference (Patrick et al 1965). From this and subsequent testing, guidelines for the Energy Absorbing Steering System were given to Saginaw Steering Gear - a maximum chest load of 1000 pounds distributed over 30 square inches of contact area. After the Impact Sled testing of the Japanese Lantern Column at the Proving Ground in June 1965, it was believed that the chest was experiencing high loads due to inertia forces needed to accelerate the 19 pound moving portion of the column assembly. A dummy with its chest plate mounted on load cells was completed by the first of September, and in tests that followed using this dummy, inertial force spikes of approximately 2000 pounds and 3 milliseconds duration were measured. It was hoped that this spike was due to the stiffness of the dummy chest and that the more compliant human chest would not show this high load. In late 1965, a prototype of the new Mesh Figure 55: Static loading of cadaver chest. Figure 56: Static loading of human volunteer. Figure 57: Time history of cadaver tolerance test. 1837</page><page sequence="21">Column was installed on the crash simulator at Wayne State, and a cadaver test was run (Figure 58). In this simulated 25 mph crash, four inches of column compression was achieved, and minimal chest deflection and no skeletal damage were observed. Extensive dummy testing of the Mesh Column over the next few months still indicated these high chest forces, so in 1966, two additional cadaver tests were run with EA Columns using more sophisticated instrumentation. Results of these tests showed that the direct load to the chest was in the range of 500 and 700 pounds ~ much less than that registered by the hard-chested dummies and well below the limit of 1000 pounds determined earlier. It was also determined that the shoulders and other body areas were taking an additional 1000 pound load through the wheel rim and outer spokes. The distribution of load over other parts of the body was very important in limiting the force directly to the chest, primarily the function of the steering wheel. The most important result of this testing was that after the first test, no injuries were observed by x-ray examination of the cadaver. The same subject was used in the second test, following which 3-4 rib fractures and a sternal fracture were noted, but these were judged not to be life threatening. This work experimentally certified the collision performance of the new EA Steering Column, and helped demonstrate the critical need for human-like dummies to design and evaluate safety hardware and components. This understanding led to extensive programs in GM to develop improved test dummies resulting in Hybrid's I, II and III (Foster et al, 1977). EA STEERING SYSTEM INTRODUCTION The General Motors Energy Absorbing Steering System was introduced in September, 1966 on the 1967 model passenger cars built by GM, Chrysler, and American Motors. GM used this and other new safety items such as the dual master brake system, the four-way hazard warning flasher, and the lane change signal as selling points in many of their advertisements. An ad featuring the EA steering system for the new '67 Chevrolets is shown in Figure 59. Although the EA column was a primary feature, anti-intrusion and improved steering wheel load distribution were additional aspects of the EA steering system. The first known real-life accident involving a 1967 car equipped with an EA Column occurred in Detroit in October, 1966. A 33 year old man was driving a 1967 American Motors Ambassador Hardtop (Figure 60) at an estimated speed of 50-60 mph when he ran into the rear end of a stationary tractor-semitrailer (Figure 61). The car suffered major front end damage and had its roof nearly ripped off, as shown in Figure 62. In the impact, the 3,334 pound Ambassador moved the tractor- semitrailer and its 32,000 pound cargo load over eight feet. Impact by the torso of the 130 pound driver compressed the steering column of the Ambassador 5-3/4 inches (Figure 63). The only injuries sustained by the driver were shallow lacerations on the face due to broken glass particles and a bruised left hip from wearing his seat belt. He suffered no cracked ribs or other broken bones and did not even receive a bruised chest. Several of the doctors who attended the patient were of the opinion that the Energy Absorbing Steering Column and the use of a seat belt were responsible for saving his life (Hanson 1966). During late 1966, when these first accident reports were coming in on the field performance of the EA steering system, the Federal Government was busy preparing its initial safety standards for passenger cars, which would include a standard for the steering assembly. The Ambassador-semitrailer accident and two similar crashes involving the EA Column were all that were known about by early December. More data was needed quickly in order to write effective standards and meet the January 31, 1967 deadline. In early January, Dr. Alan M. Nahum, Director of the Vehicle Trauma Research Group and Assistant Professor of Surgery at the UCLA School of Medicine, reported on 17 additional crashes of 1967 models equipped with the EA steering system in which none of the drivers had sustained significant chest injuries (NTSA 1967). These cases convinced government officials that the EA steering system was a major safety improvement and was a motivation for them to write steering system standards based on the GM Energy Absorbing Steering system that was already in use. Dr. Nahum, along with Drs. Irving I. Lasky and Arnold W. Siegel, also of UCLA, presented a comparison of the collision performance of different steering system designs at the Automotive Engineering Congress of the Society of Automotive Figure 58: Cadaver test of mesh column on crash simulator. 1838</page><page sequence="22">Engineers (Lasky et al 1968). No driver fatalities were reported in frontal impact accidents involving cars with the EA steering system, and the injury severity was rated as dangerous in only 2 of the 27 cases. They stated that the EA steering system "represents an advance in the safety design of wheel-column configurations and as such deserves special commendation." Other accident investigators were similarly documenting the life-saving effects of the EA Steering System. A study by Dr. Donald F. Huelke and William A. Chewning (1968) of the Highway Safety Research Institute of the University of Michigan analyzed EA Column performance in fatal and non-fatal accidents. Twenty-six cases were presented in which the column compressed and the driver escaped death and received minimal injuries to the chest. There were only two cases in which the driver died of chest injuries from contacting the steering assembly. Similar studies with promising Figure 59: Advertisement of the 1967 Chevrolets featuring the EA steering column. 1839</page><page sequence="23">results were being performed by Dr. B.J. Campbell of the University of North Carolina Highway Safety Research Center (UNC 1967) and by Professor Patrick (1968) of Wayne State University. These early reviews on the Energy Absorbing Steering System were all quite positive, but a few possible side effects appeared after a larger number of cases was investigated and the data was more closely analyzed. The study by Patrick (1968) at Wayne State suggested that knee impacts were more prevalent from interaction with the instrument panel, although most of the impacts did not produce injury. It was also observed that the column did not compress in some crashes, when the steering wheel deformed, sometimes significantly. This observation led to an early misunderstanding about column compression performance largely because the analysis did not include a consideration of driver injury or the level of force needed to deform the steering wheel. An analysis by General Motors of accident data from Cornell's ACIR and reports filed by Motors Insurance Corporation concluded that the EA Steering System significantly reduced injury severity in front end collisions, but that more head injuries were occurring (Lundstrom et al 1969). The increased head injuries were accounted for as mostly being fractures of the facial bones due to contact with the padded instrument panel ahead of the steering wheel and were not life threatening. The GM report also noted that the column might not have compressed in a few cases when it possibly should have. These early investigations of the performance of the EA steering system indicated a significant advance in automotive safety. The protection the column gave the driver in a crash due to its energy absorption properties was becoming widely known, and its application to other situations of impact protection was considered. In April, 1968, the U.S. Navy began to use the Mesh mast jacket of the EA Column for shock protection chairs and deck platforms on its river patrol boats used by troops in Vietnam (Hawkins, Hirsch 1968). Saginaw Steering Gear and the Navy Ship Research and Development Center in Washington, D.C. jointly developed the chairs and platforms, each of which was equipped with eight of the Energy Absorbing Jackets. 1840 Figure 60: Typical 1967 Ambassador Hardtop.

Roberts of Alabama, chairman of the House Subcommittee on Public Health and Safety. In 1956, Roberts set up a Special Subcommittee on Traffic Safety to undertake an extensive study of the highway accident problem. During the first session of the 86th Congress in 1959, Roberts (1963) introduced bill H.R. 1341 which required passenger-carrying motor vehicles purchased by the Federal Government to meet certain safety standards. The bill failed to pass the 86th and 87th Congresses, but after years of work by Roberts, it finally became Public Law 88-515 on August 30, 1964 (Abersfeller 1965). These standards were prescribed by the General Services Administration (GSA), the agency responsible for purchasing cars for the U.S. Government. The GSA was assisted in writing their standards by representatives of the auto industry, the Department of Commerce, the U.S. Public Health Service, the medical profession, engineers, and safety experts. Federal Standard 515, composed of 17 detailed standards (Figure 64) was published in the June 30 Federal Register (1965) and took effect September 28, 1966. An important consideration was that these were performance rather than design standards, meaning that they specified what was to be accomplished but not the mechanism to be used. This gave design freedom to the manufacturers and thus kept automobile technology from stagnating (Abersfeller 1965). Standard 515/4 dealt with the steering system. At the Ninth Stapp Conference, October, 1965, H.A. Abersfeller of the GSA stated that 515/4 "is the most controversial subject we have included" and noted particular disagreement over the limit of rearward displacement. Some experts felt that absolutely no displacement should be permitted whereas others advised "that a certain amount of displacement is beneficial and will actually help cushion the body and prevent the build up of forces." It was decided after much analysis and debate to limit the maximum load to the driver from the steering assembly to 2500 pounds and the rearward displacement to 5 inches. The standard specified that the force developed in a load cell mounted directly behind the wheel could not exceed 2500 pounds when impacted by a body block at 22 feet per second (15 mph). Dimensions and materials of the body block, known as a "blak tuffy", were given in the standard, as shown in Figure 64. GM used a pendulum impact facility for these tests (Figure 65). The 5 inch limit on rearward displacement was to be evaluated in a standard SAE J850 barrier impact test. GM had been working on its Energy Absorbing Steering Column since 1959 and therefore was able to meet standard 515/4 by the deadline of September 28, 1966. Not only were the require- ments for its GSA government contracts met, but also for all of its 1967 model year passenger cars. Chrysler and American Motors did not have systems developed by this time so they purchased EA Columns from GM to install in their cars. In 1966, the traffic safety issue was a focus in Washington. Amidst the urgings of safety activist Ralph Nader and Senators Gaylord Nelson of Wisconsin, Abraham Ribicoff of Connecticut, and Warren Magnuson of Washington, President Lyndon B. Johnson worked up a transportation program which included a traffic safety bill (Drew 1972). On September 9, President Johnson signed into law the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966 (Public Law 89-563). This law provided for the creation of the National Traffic Safety Agency ÍNTSAÍ and the National Highway Safety Agency (NHSA), which later joined to become the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA). NTSA was set up to prescribe safety standards applying to all passenger cars sold in the U.S., not just those bought by the government (NTSA 1967).

NTSA issued their 20 initial Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards on January 31, 1967. The only change made from GSA steering system standard 515/4 was dividing it into number 203 for chest load and number 204 for rearward displacement. The success stories that NTSA had received from the field on the new Energy Absorbing Steering System certainly influenced their decision not to change the 2500 pound steering wheel load and 5 inch rearward displacement limits. These standards went into effect January 1, 1968, nearly 16 months after GM introduced the EA Steering System on its 1967 model year passenger cars (NTSA 1967). 2ND GENERATION EA COLUMN During the development of the Invertube, Japanese Lantern, and Mesh Columns, General Motors engineers investigated other methods of energy absorption. Oldsmobile was the GM division with lead responsibility for the steering system, and they did^ design and testing of EA Columns before the engineering work was completely shifted to Saginaw Steering Gear. Beginning in late 1964, at the same time Saginaw was investigating the Japanese Lantern, Oldsmobile designed a mast jacket that absorbed energy by tearing a longitudinally scored metal strip from the jacket - similar to the action of opening a pull top soda-pop can or an old style key-operated coffee can. In an Impact Sled test in early 1965, the assembly telescoped but the metal strip broke off and the energy absorption properties were lost. Further tests showed that the tearing force was difficult to control, and therefore this idea was dropped. Oldsmobile also did some work at this time on a flexible steering shaft designed to limit rearward displacement by buckling into an 4&lt;S* shape when loaded axially. However, this too had problems in early tests, and the idea was dropped when a new concept came along. During 1965, a new EA device was conceived and tested by Oldsmobile. In this design, the mast jacket was composed of two telescoping tubes, in which the upper tube had two rows of three dimples each that formed an interference with the lower tube (Figure 66). The jacket was assembled by pressing the two tubes together. It absorbed energy when loaded axially by deforming the metal in the lower tube with the dimples in the upper tube. ^ Laboratory drop tests showed that under dynamic ^ conditions, the resulting load-deflection curve had a nearly constant force characteristic (Figure 67). Oldsmobile then combined this jacket with their own designs of a telescoping steering shaft and shift tube to create a complete column assembly. Impact Sled tests at the Proving Ground indicated that the new type of EA column was feasible, and after changes were made in the compression load, the tube overlap, and the instrument panel mounting bracket, barrier impact tests were run. These tests showed that the column performed well in preventing rearward displacement due to front end crush while still absorbing the energy of the driver. Oldsmobile appeared to have a competing design for an EA column, but late in 1965, the Corporation decided that undivided responsibility should be given to the EA steering system program, and consequently transferred Oldsmobile's development work over to Saginaw Steering Gear. Saginaw engineers knew that the Mesh Column could have insufficient rigidity and thus, problems with column shake. This led to the addition of structural reinforcement in order to provide sufficient bending strength, which corrected these problems, but at the expense of increased bulk, weight, and number of manufacturing procedures. Even with this reinforcement, there might be potential fatigue life problems with the Mesh section or a potential need to change the compression load of the column, depending on the results of accident field studies and possible changes in future Federal regulations. For the Mesh Column, a change in compressive load would require a major design change and a large and costly retooling job. If the load were reduced, this change would only exacerbate the existing bending strength problems. For these reasons, a new energy absorbing method was being looked for, even before the Mesh Column was introduced (Marquis 1970). •• j0-' - -0- ttCTlON A-A Figure 66: Telescoping jacket with interfering dimples. / flr Compression / Load I 1 1 i 1 1 1 1 Compression distance Figure 67: Load-displacement curve of dimpled column. 1842 J.Horsch</page><page sequence="26">A Saginaw engineer learned from a NASA publication about an energy absorption mechanism similar to Oldsmobile's dimpled tube column, but instead of using sliding friction caused by the dimples, it had a rubber torus fit between the tubes that absorbed energy on compression by rolling deformation. However, the machining needed to produce the necessary tolerances for this design proved to be too difficult and costly. This led to an idea of placing metal balls in an interference fit between the two tubes (Figure 68). This new design, known as the Ball Jacket or Ball Column, used balls that were 0.0075 inches larger in diameter than the space into which they were fitted. Energy was absorbed in the deformation of the metal tubes by the balls, which occurred with axial compression. The first jackets that went into production for the 1969 model year had 16 balls arranged in two circles of eight, spaced two inches apart, with each ball operating in its own individual longitudinal track. A static compression load in the range of 450-600 pounds and a maximum available compression distance of 8-1/4 inches were also specified (Marquis 1970). The Ball Jacket provided improvements com- pared with the Mesh design. Its greatest attribute was its design flexibility and adaptability to changing needs. If the compression load needed to be decreased, the tubes simply had to be fitted with smaller-sized balls. The measurement of compression force during assembly resulted in a 100% inspection of the column's EA characteristic. Tests showed that for each 0.001 inch decrease in interference, the average compression load decreased by 70 pounds. Increased load could be accomplished by providing greater interference and/or more balls and more longitudinal ball tracks. To increase bending strength and decrease column shake, a heavy concentration of balls was placed at the six and twelve o'clock positions, since most of the loads that cause bending and shake are in the vertical plane. If more bending resistance was desired without increasing the compression load, individual ball positions could be reinforced by placing a second ball close to the first and in the same track. Changing ball sizes, numbers, and positions provided a relatively simple means of altering column parameters without extensive redesign and testing or a large retooling job. Besides the adaptability advantage over the Mesh Column, tests of the Ball Column showed it to have greatly improved structural characteristics. Laboratory test stand and in-vehicle analyses of rigidity and natural frequency along with various tests of bending strength and shake gave results for the Ball Column that were equivalent to those for the solid 1966 non- E A columns. Long-term vibration testing at natural frequency indicated a two to three times increase in fatigue life over the Mesh design. This improved stability allowed the removal of the bulky structural reinforcements that were added for the Mesh Column, meaning less weight, less cost, and more available space. This extra space facilitated the addition of the column- mounted anti-theft locking system on the new 1969 model cars, which permitted the locking of ignition, steering, and gearshift all with one key (Marquis 1970). There were still other areas in which the Ball Column was found to be superior to the Mesh. Whereas the Mesh Jacket had a somewhat sawtooth load-displacement curve due to the staggered compression of the different sections, the Ball Jacket exhibited a nearly ideal, square curve (Figure 69). Also, the Ball Column reduced the number of assembly operations, making its production and installation more efficient and less costly, and lessening the chance of misassembly. For example, the instrument panel mounting bracket had two attachment points rather than three, requiring less tooling and the installation of one less breakaway capsule. Another advantage of the Ball Column was that the load characteristics could be checked at assembly for all columns, since the load to press the balls between the tubes was the same as that to compress it upon impact. One potential disadvantage with the Ball Jacket was that it could only telescope to one half of the length of the column that was clear of attachments, whereas the Mesh Jacket could compress by essentially this entire length. The Ball Column did provide 8-1/4 inches of compression distance, however, which was indicated by a large quantity of Mesh Column accident data to be sufficient for system performance (Marquis 1970). The testing program for the Ball Column far exceeded that conducted on the Mesh prior to its production release. Hundreds of Ball Columns were Figure 68: Cut-away view of ball jacket. v v V v u COMPRESSION DISTANCE Figure 69: Comparison of load-displacement curves for ball and mesh columns. 1843</page><page sequence="27">tested in barrier impact. Proving Ground Impact Sled, Blak Tuffy mini-sled, and laboratory drop tests - all with collision performances equal to or better than the Mesh design. Barrier tests on the Ball Column indicated a slightly better compression distance and rearward displacement and chest loading values in the same range as the Mesh Column. Sled tests were run with both belted and unbelted dummy drivers in straight-on, angular and offset impacts. Various torsion, tension, compression, and salt spray tests were performed in the laboratory on over 500 Ball Jackets and Column assemblies. No problems developed in six cars driven on Saginaw Steering Gear's annual cold weather trip during the winter of 1967 or in a car driven in a 5000 mile road test on the Proving Ground's tough Belgian Block course. This list of tests along with several others indicate the very thorough testing job that was performed on the Ball Column before it was released for production. Although the initial field studies indicated that the Mesh Column was performing well in reducing driver crash injuries, the Ball Jacket had several engineering advantages and also appeared to be slightly better from a safety standpoint. A rigorous testing program verified these claims, and in September, 1968, the second generation Energy Absorbing Steering Column, featuring the Ball Jacket, was introduced on General Motors 1969 model automobiles. The EA Columns on today's GM cars feature a Ball Jacket compressible element. Front wheel drive cars do not mount the lower end of the column to the front of dash and therefore do not require as much available column compres- sion or ball spacing in the EA element. FURTHER BIOMECHAN1CAL RESEARCH During the development and testing of the Ball Column, Oldsmobile initiated and directed a major study of the overall performance of energy absorbing steering systems. This was a multi-faceted, corporate effort and included further cadaver testing at Wayne State. The main objectives of this project were: 1) to aquire additional human tolerance data for the chest and torso; 2) to correlate this human cadaver data with that from dummy testing in order to establish a more realistic and meaningful laboratory steering system test; 3) to obtain a performance comparison between Ball and Mesh Columns using cadavers; and 4) to establish design recommendations for steering system components involved in energy absorption. In October, 1967, the major part of this study was contracted through GM Research to Professor Patrick at the Wayne State Biomechanics Research Center. From January, 1968 to May, 1969, 38 tests were run of cadavers and Sierra Stan dummies impacting 1968 Mesh Columns and two Ball Column designs at velocities of 16, 22, and 30 mph. A total of six different steering wheel designs were used on the columns. Wayne State used their own impact sled, in which a dummy or cadaver in a moving seat was propelled into a stationary vehicle body section with mounted steering assembly. The results of this study showed no significant differences between the impact performances of the Mesh and Ball designs based on peak upper torso load. The Sierra Stan dummy chest was found to give different results than the cadaver chest, but test values correlated well enough to develop guidelines for testing with the dummy. Also determined by this study were peak load tolerances for the frontal thorax and the upper torso, both of which were found to be dependent on the steering wheel used. Understanding for the role of the steering wheel were developed in this study. Work on designing a compatible wheel for the EA Column had actually been going on for years, mostly through the efforts of Inland Division, GM's manufacturer of steering wheels, along with Oldsmobile, the Proving Ground, and GM Research. In designing a wheel from a crash injury point of view, some changes were obvious, but in other cases, a trade-off had to be made. Pieces that could potentially break off and others with sharp edges clearly should be removed. However, there were many arguments over how stiff to make the wheel rim. On one hand, the rim needed to be very stiff to support the shoulders and protect the chest, but on the other hand a soft rim was needed to minimize abdominal and facial injuries. Many tests were performed on wheels of various sizes, spoke numbers, and rim stiffness, and on others with built-in EA elements. Deep dish wheels with a recessed hub, which were used on cars for several years before the EA Column came out, were also tested with the EA Column. The understanding that was developed by 1969 was therefore the result of years of testing, and attempted to make the steering wheel function with the EA Column as a system to minimize injuries. The tolerance data acquired from these Wayne State cadaver tests were used by GM engineers in the development of a new dummy. This dummy, called the Hybrid II, was an improvement over previous dummies in that it better simulated human biomechanics. It also had improved repeatability, durability, and serviceability. The Hybrid II was evaluated by NHTSA and subsequently adopted as the standard dummy for crash testing. However, work on development of a more human-like dummy than represented by the Hybrid II was already in progress, leading to the Hybrid III dummy. At about the same time that GMR became involved in these latest cadaver tests at Wayne State, they also initiated a cadaver testing program at the University of California. When the first Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards were being written during late 1966 and early 1967, and Dr. Alan M. Nahum of UCLA was convincing the NTSA of the safety value of GM's Mesh Column via his accident studies, Nahum became interested in the biomechanics program at GMR. In early 1968, a collaborative biomechanics research program at UCLA was initiated to further study impact tolerances of human cadavers. Their first work concerned impact tolerance of the skull and facial bones (Gadd et al 1968), and during the ensuing twelve years, a variety of biomechanics studies were carried out. The main thrust of the GMR/U of C 1844</page><page sequence="28">program, however, concerned blunt impact to the thorax; and unembalmed subjects were now used for enhanced biofidelity. The thoracic tolerance studies were begun at the University of California at Los Angeles (UCLA) in 1969 then transferred to the San Diego campus (UCSD) in 1971. The tests were run using an elastic cord propelled horizontal impactor with a six inch diameter, flat, rigid impact face to apply a midsternal blunt loading to the cadaver chest (Figure 70). In the first phase of this study (Nahum et al 1970), which consisted of static tests of four embalmed and six unembalmed cadavers, the force-deflection characteristics showed a significantly higher chest compliance for the unembalmed subjects (Figure 71). For this reason, only unembalmed cadavers were used to acquire chest tolerance data for the remainder of the UCSD studies. The next phase of the study consisted of an additional fourteen cadaver tests and seven volunteer tests (Kroell et al 1971, Lobdell et al 1972). Live human volunteers were used to analyze the effects of muscle tensing on chest compliance as it was believed that this occurred during many crashes. From this data, thoracic force-deflection response corridors were developed (Kroell et al 1974) for two combinations of impactor mass and velocity (Figure 72). Combining this data with that from twenty-three more cadaver tests at UCSD, Raymond F. Neathery (1974) of GMR's newly formed Biomedical Science Department then developed scaled response corridors for 5th, 50th and 95th percentile dummies. Prediction equations for maximum force and normalized compression were also determined, using dimensional analysis. Neathery's response corridors for the 50th percentile male dummy chest were used in the design of the Hybrid III (Figure 73), which is a biomechanically improved frontal impact dummy introduced in 1977 by GM's Safety Research and Development Lab (Foster et al 1977). Neathery, Kroell, and Mertz (1975) also used the UCSD data to develop a normalized chest deflection criterion for predicting injuries from dummy responses, which they showed to be more appropriate than the current criterion based on spinal acceleration. In re-examining the UCSD data, GMR's David C. Viano (1978a) showed that a good correlation also existed between injury level and the initial kinetic energy of impact. In a further analy- sis, he also proposed that the difference between moderate and life-threatening injury was associated with a specific limit of normalized chest deflection (Viano 1978b). In order to assess the physiological responses to impact trauma that could not be measured on cadavers, GMR's Biomedical Science Department has conducted many other thoracic loading studies on live subjects, including anesthetized laboratory animals and human volunteers. In 1971, the thoracic tolerance to whole-body deceleration was analyzed by instrumenting professional high diver Ross Collins with accelerometers and having him dive from heights of up to 57 feet and land supinely into a foam pad (Figure 74). He experienced no discomfort in withstanding a 49.2 g Figure 70: UCSD cadaver test set-up. Figure 71: Embalmed vs. unembalmed cadaver chest load-deflection characteristics.

Another volunteer study involved 70 year old stunt diver, Henri LaMothe, who dove from heights of up to 15 feet while "wearing" accelerometers and 34.5 feet without instruments, landing "belly flopper" fashion into 13 inches of water and providing further data (Viano et al 1975) on human response and tolerance to dynamic loadings of the torso (Figure 75). The first thoracic impact studies of animals at GMR were done by Schreck and Viano (1973) on fresh pig carcasses. Figure 73: Hybrid III dummy. Figure 74: Diver Ross Collins (a) fully instrumented and (b) preparing to dive. Another GMR collaborative research program was initiated - this time with Professor Charles Y. Warner of the Mechanical Engineering Department at Brigham Young University (BYU) in Provo, Utah. Live, anesthetized pigs were used in a series of blunt, frontal thoracic impact tests. This work was done at BYU over a seven year period using experimental set-ups such as shown in Figures 76 and 77. These studies included: 1) a determination of the thoracic impact response of live pigs (Viano, Warner 1976); 2) a comparison between the responses of living and postmortem sibling pigs (Viano et al 1977); 3) a comparison of various thoracic impact sites (Viano et al 1978); 4) a comparison of impact responses in the spine vertical (Figure 76) and spine horizontal (Figure 77) postures (Pope et al 1979); and 5) an analysis of the interrelationship between impact velocity and chest compression (Kroell et al 1981). Figure 75: Sequence of events in Henri LaMothe's high-dive performance. 1846</page><page sequence="30">Laboratory research was also conducted at the Biomedical Science Department. Anesthetized rabbits were used to develop a theoretical relationship to assess the severity of thoracic impact based on velocity of impact and normalized chest compression (Viano, Lau 1983). A viscous tolerance criterion represented by the maximum product of velocity and compression was developed by Viano and Lau (1985) as a supplement to the chest compression criterion currently used to measure impact severity in GM's crash testing of dummies. The main objectives of these chest impact studies of cadavers, volunteers, and anesthetized animals were: 1) to determine the impact tolerance and response of the human chest; 2) to use this data in the development of anthropomorphic dummies; 3) to establish predictive criteria for these dummies to assess the probability of injury to live humans exposed to similar loading conditions; and 4) to use the dummies and test criteria to design safer vehicle interiors and restraint systems for automobiles. EA STEERING SYSTEM EFFECTIVENESS Since the introduction of the General Motors EA Steering System in 1966 and of the various designs which have followed, many different accident investigators have been trying to answer the question, "Just how effective are EA Steering Systems in preventing injuries and saving lives?" As already mentioned, the early reports on the Mesh Column were very favorable, although a few questions arose concerning its possible failure to compress when the investigators thought that it should have. The Ball Column provided an engineering improvement on GM's 1969 models. Since that time, many more studies covering larger data bases have been published on the effectiveness of EA Columns, with somewhat mixed reviews. In 1970, UCLA's Nahum, Siegel, and Brooks (1970) presented a study of 178 injured drivers of 1960-66 pre-EA Column cars and 328 injured drivers of 1967-69 cars equipped with EA Steering Systems. Their data indicated a 61 percent decrease in fatal and dangerous injury rates for drivers striking the steering assembly. A study by Levine and Campbell (1971) at the University of North Carolina showed that EA steering systems reduced serious injuries by 14 percent among drivers not wearing seat belts. They also showed that when drivers wore seat belts in cars equipped with EA steering systems, serious injuries were reduced 52 percent over drivers without either safety feature. A report by Anderson (1974) of Calspan Corporation indicated that from a subset of drivers that wore seat belts, EA systems still reduced serious injuries by 14 percent. Although the effectiveness values given by these and other studies covered a large range, there was a general consensus that compared to previous systems, the EA Steering Columns were protecting many drivers from serious and fatal injuries (Figure 78). A few reports began coming out in 1973, however, of alleged performance failures with EA steering systems. A majority of the criticism was coming from a British group at the University of Birmingham's Department of Transportation and Environmental Planning, headed by G.M. Mackay and P.F. Gloyns. Mackay first presented their findings in June, 1973 at a conference in Amsterdam (Gloyns, Mackay 1973), in which he stated that axial compression steering systems, such as the EA Column, were not performing as well in real-world crashes as systems with a solid column and a deformable hub element just behind the steering wheel. They blamed this performance difference on the testing procedures outlined in Federal Safety Standards 203 and 204, which tended to favor the axial compression systems. However, the differences in injury level between the two systems were not found to be statistically significant, and also, the small British cars were not similar to GM cars equipped with the GM Ball Column. Gloyns and Mackay (1974) presented the same arguments in December, 1974 at the Eighteenth Stapp Car Crash Conference. Garrett and Hendricks (1975) of Calspan investigated 549 frontal accidents and found that the EA Column compressed less when the impact was at an angle rather than head-on. They incorrectly concluded that the decreased compression was generally associated with increased injuries. They did show, however, that GM's Ball Column achieved the most com- pression of any design tested.

Huelke and O'Day (1975) of the University of Michigan classified them as being only "partially effective" and called for the development of new standards. Quality control expert J.M. Juran (1976) labelled the entire set of safety standards łia failure" from a benefits/costs standpoint. In 1981, NHTSA came out with an evaluation of their own standards. This report, by Charles J. Kahane (1981), was the first investigation of its kind that was based on a large number of crashes and with a greatly reduced bias for selection of cases. It found the Steering Assembly standards (MVSS 203 and 204) to be effective in that for frontal crashes, the driver's overall risks of fatality and serious injury were reduced by 12% and 17.5%, respectively, while only $10 was added to the lifetime cost of owning and operating a car (Figure 79). At the same time, A.C. Malliaris, Ralph Hitchcock, and James Hedlund (1982) of NHTSA developed a method for establishing priorities in crash protection based on human Harm. Harm was defined as aia cost-weighted sum of the number of people injured or the number of injuries sustained, whether fatal or not," with "cost" based on injury severity. Part of this study focused on the source of injury, and the steering assembly was found to be the area of contact representing the most Harm. Steering assembly contact was associated with 27% of the total Harm to car occupants, with the instrument panel next at 11% (Figure 80). Subsequent analysis demonstrated that the steering assembly is highly represented in injury data due to high exposure and not "negative" benefit, Park (1984) and Horsch et al (1985).

One result of studies such as the Harm paper was an expansion by General Motors of its on-going efforts to further improve the steering system through a coordinated corporate effort. Several column features, initially developed in air bag programs, were evaluated for unrestrained drivers and were subsequently introduced in appropriate passenger vehicles. These features were: 1) the quick-release shear capsule which reduced the release forces from the anti- intrusion bracket especially in non-axial loadings, and 2) the ramped jacket, which increased the force of compression and energy absorption after the initial part of column compression which has an inertial component related to column acceleration by the forces of driver impact (Figure 81). GMR's Biomedical Science Department also expanded its activity to provide an improved understanding of the issues and mechanics of the driver interaction with the steering system in car crashes. As part of the critical review of the literature, the "popular" criticisms based on analysis of car crashes and various hypotheses were evaluated in sled tests with dummies and human cadavers. This effort resulted in a series of papers dealing with the steering system impact performance. GMR addressed the assertion of a poor safety performance of the EA column due to a "frequent" failure of the column to compress. The position in the literature was developed from laboratory tests which observed less column compression in off-axis impact than in axial loadings; and, it was supported by analysis of crash data which involved less column compression in the EA device than the author expected from the general severity of the accident. Because driver injury is highly associated with the steering assembly, the conjecture of a "frequent" failure to compress was embraced by some authors as a flaw of the EA steering system. However, the laboratory studies did not consider the severity of the loading nor did the crash data analysis consider injury outcome of the driver. The analysis of FMVSS 203 and 204 by Kahane 11981) continued the presumption of a "fre- quent failure to compress" by concluding that ģ's failure of the energy absorbing devices to compress" occurred in about half the crashes in which they were heavily impacted by drivers. He speculated that the columns "tend to bind rather than compress when they are exposed to nonaxial loads." Because he was among the first to recognize that the primary reason for noncompression in most cases was insufficient impact force resulting from lower severity crashes, he proposed a criteria to indicate "heavy" driver loading based on steering wheel deformation in which a severely deformed wheel and less than one inch EA element compression was considered a failure, irrespective of injury outcome. However, Kahane failed, as did previous researchers, to evaluate if occupant injuries were associated with their proposed criterion of "failure to compress." This was one reason why GM (1981) stated in its official comments to NHTSA on the Kahane Report that the number of cases of noncompression due to "failure" was greatly overestimated. Figure 80: Distribution of crash injury harm by contact source and by body region for steering system impact. 1849</page><page sequence="33">GMR's Biomedical Science Department used analysis of accident data and an understanding of impact mechanics to show that no direct correlation existed between wheel deformation or column compression and injury outcome. When various "failure to compress" criterion were applied to a large set of accident data, Horsch et al (1982) found that no greater percentage of steering-related injuries existed in the "failure" group than for the overall data set (Figure 82). In fact, most of the injury was associated with cases in which the column did compress and that these were typically the more severe crashes. Sled tests were used to evaluate the mechanics of the various non-compression hypotheses and developed an understanding of the impact mechanics. These tests demonstrated that the ball- sleeve column would compress at loadings of more than 50° from the column axis (Figure 83). These studies also confirmed that less column compression was associated with off-axis loading and driver off- set impacts, but most importantly, little or no change in injury risk was associated with this reduction in column compression as energy absorption was shifted to steering wheel deformation. Reduced column compression in off- axis and off-set impacts was shown to be due to geometric effects and shifting force limiting and energy absorption to the steering wheel and not due to increased column compression force for the GM ball column. A dramatic demonstration of the wheel and column interaction and energy absorbing defor- mations was accomplished by bracing the dummy's arms on the wheel (Figure 84). When the arms were braced between the spokes, the wheel required less force to deform than for the column to compress. Thus, for this situation, the wheel experienced large deformation and the column had almost no compression. In contrast with the arms braced at the spokes, the wheel was stronger than the column and the column fully compressed. Impact force and dummy responses were similar in the two tests, steering assembly deformation was completely different. Sternal impact from a typical seating position also resulted in full column compression but with greater impact force and dummy response amplitude due to a greater acceleration of column and wheel mass. Locking column compression greatly increased impact force and dummy response amplitude with minimal deformation of the steering wheel. Although the intent of the experiment was not to study "bracing" by the driver, the forces measured with the dummy's arms braced were similar to reported arm forces from a "stunt" driver who braced in a staged crash (Wagner 1979). The GMR research was able to demonstrate in laboratory tests that the ball-sleeve column would compress in off-axis impacts, that the column would compress less in such impacts, that the wheel would provide force limiting and energy absorbing functions in these situations, and that these facts did not greatly increase the risk of injury based on dummy responses.

However, this analysis did not explain the high association of injury with steering assembly impact. Determining this cause-and-effect was critical. Park (1984) and Evans and Frick (1987) have shown that the driver has a lower or equal risk of injury compared with a right-front passenger, indicating a possible protective benefit of the steering system. Seventy percent of car occupants are drivers and frontal crashes comprise the most frequent injury category. This indicates that frequent exposure and not defective performance was the reason for the association of injury with steering assembly impact. Horsch and Viano (1984) evaluated the mech- anical surrogates or test dummies available for laboratory testing of the steering system and its safety performance. These studies demonstrated that the Hybrid III dummy was the most appropriate test device based on a more human-like construction, biofidelity in frontal impact responses and an extensive injury assessment capability related to the viscous and compression mechanisms of injury in addition to "traditional" acceleration based criteria. In contrast, the SAE J-944 body block was shown to be an inappropriate test device (Figure 85) based on its non-humanlike con- struction, a fundamental lack of biofidelity, and no injury assessment capability. The study demonstrated that FMVSS 203 which requires an impact evaluation of the steering system using the SAE body block cannot assess improved occupant protection features of the steering system because of the inherent limitations of the test device responses and methods and that these limitations could result in a counterproductive design. The available surrogates were also used to determine how various design and test parameters such as steering column mass, steering wheel load distribution and test severity would be rated as affecting injury (Horsch 1982). These tests demonstrated that the choice of surrogate and test response is crucial to identifying which design strategy best protects car occupants (Figure 86). Thoracic stiffness is important for the peak impact Figure 85: Blunt frontal thoracic impact responses of the SAE J944 body block, the Part 572 dummy, and the Hybrid III dummy for the recommended test method and compared to recommended response envelopes. 1852</page><page sequence="36">force, primarily due to acceleration of the column and wheel mass. The excessively stiff body block caused 57% greater impact force than did the more human-like Hybrid III dummy. Perhaps more importantly, only the Hybrid III dummy with chest compression biofidelity could distinguish the importance of steering wheel load distribution on the upper torso. A standard steering wheel was compared with a "disk" which applied the impact loading only to the rib cage. The body block and Part 572 dummy indicated minimal difference between these wheels. However, the Hybrid III demonstrated that applying all of the impact force to the rib cage increased chest compression by 80% and injury risk from very low to a high risk of severe thoracic injuries at a test severity well below that of a 50 kmph frontal barrier crash. These tests provided an additional understanding of the importance of load distribution by the steering wheel on the upper body. These are among the reasons that GM developed a "similar" test but substituted a Hybrid III torso at almost three times the impact energy of the 203 test. In spite of significant advantages in using the Hybrid III dummy, it also has limitations in mimicking an occupant's interaction with the steering system. One limitation was addressed in a GMR sponsored series of dummy and cadaver tests conducted at Wayne State University (Begeman et al 1990). The experiments involved sled tests with a steering wheel mounted on a rigid (non- compressible) steering column and chest impacts by the unrestrained driver at severities sufficient to result in inversion of the steering wheel in cadaver tests, a situation sometimes found in fatal, severe frontal crashes. Sled velocities approaching 50 kph with the full velocity change occurring before steering wheel impact resulted in significant thoracic injuries in cadavers and significant deformations of the steering wheel (Figure 87).

In comparable tests, the Hybrid III and Part 572 dummy produced much lower deformations of the steering wheel in spite of significantly higher impact forces. Although the Hybrid III dummy provided the most representative wheel deformations of the test devices evaluated, it was unable to invert the steering wheel because of the dummies' non-deformable steel spine structure. Fortunately, these types of tests are well beyond the standard evaluation of the steering system and forces would have been limited in real applications by the EA column. The experiments did quantify one deficiency in even state-of-art test dummies to duplicate a fatal injury mechanism by steering wheel impact. Figure 87: Deformed steering wheels from WSU tests at 42 km/h with a non-compressible column. 1853</page><page sequence="37">In summing up the GMR work, the studies demonstrated that following recommendations in the literature to improve the consistency of EA device compression was not the key for improvement in driver protection. Additionally, it was demonstrated that the "standard" test could not be used to improve design strategies in preventing severe to fatal flail chest and internal organ trauma. Thus, the GMR studies looked at factors in car crashes that were associated with steering system contact injuries (Horsch, Culver 1983). These investigations found that injury was associated with a wide range of crash directions and severities, driver alignment with the steering system, and injury mechanisms in body regions involved. This new understanding suggested a shift in focus from the EA column to the steering wheel. A review of fatal crashes involving driver interaction with the steering system showed the possibility of significant steering wheel deformations with the plane of the wheel rim sometimes below that of the hub by occupant loading (Figure 88). This situation would result in a more concentrated sternal loading on the occupant which would reduce the load sharing and distribution between chest and shoulders. This would lower the occupant's tolerance to steering wheel force. One obvious countermeasure to this situation in fatal crashes would be to increase the stiffness of the spokes and rim of the steering wheel. Such increases would reduce a tendency for the wheel to deform during severe occupant loadings and thus maintain the balance of shoulder and chest impact forces. Although a stiffer steering wheel would likely improve thoracic protection in very severe loadings, it might inadvertently increase injuries for other body contacts. Figure 89 shows the force tolerance for the chest, abdomen and face for steering wheel loading. The higher tolerance of the chest indicates its ability to withstand impact forces on the rib cage that are well above those necessary to cause soft tissue injuries in the unprotective portion of the abdomen. A similar lower force tolerance can be expected for a facial impact which may occur during driver interactions with the steering system. These biomechanical data suggested the need for a systematic improvement in steering wheel design. While stiffening the steering wheel may reduce the risk of crush injury of the chest in severe driver loadings, this design direction did not match the need for lower forces associated with abdominal and facial impact. On this basis, there was a conflict in requirements of the safety performance of the steering wheel depending on the body region in contact. DEVELOPMENT OF THE SELF-ALIGNING STEERING WHEEL In frontal and oblique crashes, the driver contacts the steering wheel. Although the column limits the overall impact of force, injury risk for the driver depends on the location, distribution and magnitude of impact forces transmitted by steering wheel contact. In addition, the driver impact with the steering wheel occurs from various positions and directions in a real-world crashes because of a range in alignments with the steering system prior to and during a crash, belt restraint use being one important factor. The difficulty in designing an optimum steering system to cover the wide spectrum of impact situations was further compounded by the need to protect various body regions having widely different impact characteristics and tolerances. In addition, some important body regions such as the abdomen were not routinely evaluated in even the state-of-art test devices. Thus, the effect of design changes on the risk of abdominal injury would not be included in the evaluation of system performances and not part of steering wheel criteria for overall safety.

The research focused on the mechanism of blunt impact injury of the chest, abdomen, face and head and considered opportunities to improve the built-in safety of the steering system for both the unrestrained and lap- shoulder belted driver. The research addressed the conflicting requirements for steering wheel deformation which included a "stiff" steering wheel plane to assure sufficient energy management and load sharing between the chest and shoulder thus maintaining tolerable loads on the sternum in severe frontal crashes, and a "soft" wheel rim to reduce the risks of injury to abdominal organs or the face related to the initial contact with the steering wheel. A Hybrid III torso impact test was developed by a corporate task group as a means to assure good upper body load distribution for an unrestrained driver (Figure 90). This test was more relevant to car occupants and real world crashes than the FMVSS 203 body block test due to a more human-like surrogate, a wide range of injury assessment instrumentation, and almost three times the impact energy. Pivotal to the development of the self-aligning steering wheel was continued GMR research on the mechanisms of internal organ and soft tissue injury in blunt impact. Anesthetized animal experiments provided the only opportunity to determine life- threatening injuries. By the mid 1980's, Viano and Lau (1985) had developed the theory and experi- mental support for chest and abdominal injury by a viscous mechanism. They subsequently extended their analysis of injury mechanisms by merging in a crushing mechanism due to high forces squeezing organs and tissues against the spine in frontal impacts. Complimentary research was conducted by Kroell et al (1981, 1986) using high velocity impacts on anesthetized pigs and body region specific studies on mechanisms of liver injury and lung trauma (Lau, Viano 1981 a,b,c,d,), all of which substantiated a rate-dependent mechanism of injury. The final tolerance relationship (Figure 91) emphasized the importance of the amount and velocity of body deformation on injury risk (Viano, Lau 1988). A reanalysis of earlier UCSD cadaver data (Lau, Viano 1986) provided additional support for the viscous criterion so that by 1988, the viscous injury mechanism was being routinely used in the assessment of safety systems and had an established procedure and recommended tolerance level. The criterion effectively demonstrated not only injury risk but the time of greatest injury potential (Lau, Viano 1988). Knowing the time of injury risk in an impact exposure helped to further focus attention on countermeasures that would be effective in improving driver safety in a crash. In contrast, spinal acceleration continued to show no statistical or practical relation to injury causation or risk. This was most evident in a study of abdominal injury by steering wheel loading which showed that maximum injury risk to abdominal organs occurred prior to sufficient force to initiate column compression and prior to peaks in spinal acceleration. Both of these responses would falsely indicate that injury was associated with events later in the impact (Horsch et al 1985). The data led to an evaluation of steering wheel deformations occurring early in an impact exposure at the time of the peak viscous response (Figure 92); and before the maximum forces are developed by the chest impacting the steering wheel and initiating column compression (Lau et al 1987, Lau, Viano 1988). Concepts for energy-absorbing steering wheels had been well known and some designs have been used; however, the criteria for an effective EA wheel Figure 90: Hybrid III torso impact test to evaluate steering assembly EA management and steering wheel load distribution on the upper body. 1855</page><page sequence="39">and hub were not available until analysis of dummy, cadaver, and animal test data. The new understandings provided a set of performance criteria which would be effective in improving driver safety for a range of impact exposures in body regions involved. In 1979, the Inland Division of General Motors developed an energy-absorbing steering wheel by a unique design of a multi-finger hub element which provided a flexible attachment between the steering wheel and column. This EA hub provided a design concept that could resolve the conflict between a "stiff" and "soft" steering wheel for the protection of different body regions. Conceptually, the EA wheel provides the deformation performance given in Figure 93. A prototype self-aligning steering wheel was evaluated in 1983 using sled tests with the Hybrid III dummy. The experiment successfully showed that the self-aligning steering wheel provided improved protection for a range of initial seating positions and orientations of the driver dummy (Figure 94). Not only were impact forces better distributed in the experiments, the tests showed that one possible negative aspect of the self-aligning feature was, in fact, an advantage. There was a concern that the aligning feature would allow the driver to slip off the steering wheel in oblique impacts and thus increase secondary contacts within the vehicle. However, in oblique and off-axis loading the aligning feature used in this wheel actually helped maintain better contact with the driver and more uniform load distribution on the thorax over the range of exposures. Additional experiments were conducted to address the potential improvement in head impact with the EA hub used in the self-aligning steering wheel. Drop test experiments with the Hybrid III head indicated a reduction in head HIC with the new steering wheel (Figure 95), while further demonstrating the feasi- bility of limiting force and absorbing impact energy remote from the impact location. The experiments clearly supported the efficacy of the self-aligning feature and increased wheel stiffness in a range of tests. It also demonstrated the improvement provided by a consistent rim deformation force around the perimeter of the steering wheel, which was controlled by the tipping force of the hub element remote from the rim. In contrast, standard steering wheels could have greater than a 2 to 1 range in rim deflection forces depending on the relative position of rim loading with respect to spoke attachments. Thus, the self- aligning feature reduced the sensitivity of rim loading to the location around the steering wheel. To further verify the safety potential of the self-aligning steering wheel, Horsch et al (1985) conducted experiments using anesthetized pigs in Hyge sled tests with the self-aligning steering wheel concept compared to the same steering wheel without a self-aligning feature. These tests marked the first time that the Hyge sled installed in the Biomedical Science Department in 1979 was used for animal experiments.

Using a exposure severity of 9.0 m/s, anesthetized animals impacted by a "stiff steering wheel experienced severe life- threatening abdominal injuries due to rim loading on the abdomen. Analysis of data showed that injuries were associated with a viscous mechanisms of injury and that injuries were occurring before sufficient forces had been developed by chest impact to initiate column compression (Figure 92). Tests with the self-aligning steering wheel resulted in minimal injury to the abdomen with lower levels of chest injury for a comparable exposure. These data helped validate the self-aligning steering wheel concept and define wheel stiffness guidelines. The biomechanical data supporting the self- aligning steering wheel concept were presented to the Corporation in early 1985. Its endorsement of the concept subsequently led to a corporate-wide Task Force headed by CPC to consider the broader aspects of production feasibility of the self-aligning steering wheel. Task Force members represented a cross section of General Motors Divisions and Staffs. The Inland Division had the major role for a series of evaluations to refine the concept for the other many product functions, requirements, and manufacturing considerations for the self-aligning steering wheel. The demonstration of a production feasible prototype for the wheel was completed in 1988 and the first production installation of the self-aligning steering wheel manufactured by Inland Division was in the 1989 Cavalier with an accelerated phase-in for steering wheels in non- airbag vehicles. During the final development of the self-aligning steering wheel, a series of analyses was conducted on the cost-effectiveness of the new safety feature in relation to other safety considerations for vehicle improvement. These comparisons showed a significant advantage for the self-aligning feature over other more costly ideas largely because of its effectiveness in improving safety for a wider range of crash environments and potential body region contacts involving both unrestrained and belt restrained drivers. 3-ms Maximum Thoracic Spine Sled Test Conditions Chest Resultant Velocity Compression Acceleration Configuration (km/h) Wheel (mm) (g) 27 Baseline 42 28 Self-Aligning 38 24 15* Column Angle 33 Baseline 41 34 Self-Aligning 41 30 27 Baseline 33 24 125 mm Off-set Self-Aligning 16 28 15* Column Angle 33 Baseline 33 31 Self-Aligning 19 31 27 Baseline 39 22 Self-Aligning 32 25 30* Column Angle 33 Baseline 64 32 Self-Aligning 42 36 Figure 94: Comparison of Hybrid III thoracic responses for a "typical" baseline steering wheel and a prototype self-aligning wheel over a range of alignments with the steering assembly demonstrating improved load distribution (reduced chest compression).

The early data has shown success in improving passenger protection while not demonstrating any durability or reliability problems with the new feature. A significant crash occurred shortly after introduction in which an unrestrained driver survived a severe driver-side frontal crash with minimal fractures of chest ribs and extremities. The self-aligning feature performed as designed and helped manage the dri- ver's impact energy. In contrast, the unrestrained right-front passenger was fatally injured by instrument panel and windshield impact. A SCIENTIFIC BASIS FOR SAFETY ENGINEERING The role of the steering system for protecting drivers is changing due to increased belt use and wider availability of supplemental inflatable restraints. Work has continued to improve head and facial protection for the belted driver (Viano et al 1986, Melvin and Shee 1989). Much of the technology developed for the energy absorbing steering system remains important for continued advancement of occupant protection. Steering system energy management and intrusion control features developed for unrestrained drivers have been applied to driver air bag systems. Improved understanding of human tolerance and dummy injury assessment which were developed concurrently with steering system designs are keys for further occupant protection. A scientific basis for safety engineering, which links biomechanical relevant laboratory tests to real world performance has evolved with the many tests and evaluations of the energy absorbing steering system over thirty years. Investigations to determine the tolerable impact force for the torso led to the understanding that tolerance depends on how force is applied to the human. This led to new injury assessment technologies in dummies and injury criteria which could distinguish load distribution and lead to designs with good load application. These needs led to the Hybrid III dummy which has injury assessment based on a biofidelic compressible chest. The development of the energy absorbing steering system has demonstrated the need for relevant laboratory tests with sufficient injury assessment capability to evaluate primary injury risks to car occupants in a similar exposure. This is critical and provides a foundation in assessing crash safety improvements. However, these tests are not the final link to real world performance. Laboratory tests represent specific, well controlled conditions; the real world consists of large ranges of many parameters such as crash severity and car occupant tolerance to impact. The presumption that a crash test represents real world performance can be highly misleading because it represents the injury risk for only one of many crash situations. Consideration of injury types, frequencies of occurrence, distribution in tolerance and crash situations led to a strategy for steering wheel design which could not have been developed from routine tests. The analyses of occupant injuries by Malliaris et al (1982, 1985) showed that although "high" injury risk is associated with "severe" crashes, much of the injury is associated with crash severities having "low" risk of injury but a "high" exposure associated with "low" severity crashes (Figure 96). Laboratory tests over a range in crash severities provide more information on the distribution in injury risk. The association of exposure frequency must come from additional analysis. An analysis which considers the range of tolerance in terms of a risk of injury and the exposure frequency associated with particular test or exposure situations provides a better extrapolation to real-world performance (Horsch, 1987, Viano 1987). Research continues on these safety strategies, since they appear to provide an enhanced approach to improve crash protection in real-world crashes.

He completed the story of the early years of development through studies of the effectiveness of the EA system in field accidents. The results of more recent studies were added to make the review current, including studies leading to further improvements in safety design and evaluation. This comprehensive history is meant to portray the continuous process of design, evaluation, and review of the built-in safety of General Motors products and the technical and scientific analysis of occupant protection that is an important part of that process.
