MACCORMACK, NAOMI F. MILLER, AND JILL A. WEBER Abstract The 1996 and 1997 seasons of the Hopkins-Amsterdam project in the Jabbul plain, western Syria, have gener- ated new results on Bronze Age urbanism at Tell Umm el- Marra and elucidated longer-term settlement patterns in theJabbul region. Excavation results have documented the foundation of Umm el-Marra as a regional center in the Early Bronze Age, provided new data on a period of decentralization in Middle Bronze I, and supplied evi- dence of the regeneration of urbanism in MB II. Faunal and archaeobotanical analysis broaden our understand- ing of these developments, attesting to an economy over- whelmingly dependent on the steppe environment, with an emphasis on large-scale onager hunting in MB II. Finally, a regional survey provides data on long-term de- mographic and socioeconomic trends, furnishing an ex- pansive time range and spatial context for our under- standing of developmental patterns in the region. The survey results supply new information on the limits of the Uruk expansion, cycles of Bronze Age urbanization, changing patterns of steppe exploitation, and demo- graphic and agricultural extensification in the Byzan- tine and Early Islamic periods.* INTRODUCTION In recent years Syria and upper Mesopotamia have served as an important laboratory of research on ear- *We wish to express our gratitude to the Directorate-Gen- eral of Antiquities and Museums, Syria, for its continued sup- port and encouragement of the Hopkins-Amsterdam joint expedition to Umm el-Marra, with especial thanks to Sultan Muhesen, Director-General, Adnan Bounni, Director of Exca- vations during the 1996-1997 field seasons, and Wahid Khaya- ta, Director of the Aleppo Museum.

Investigation of the development of ur- ban societies in this region serves to expand our appreciation of early urban variability, allowing us to progress beyond assumptions of ancient Near East- ern urbanism as a uniform phenomenon.' In the Johns Hopkins-University of Amsterdam Umm el-Marra project, we aim to investigate the ear- ly history of complex societies in western Syria, a rel- atively underinvestigated region whose potential has been amply demonstrated by the results from Ebla (Tell Mardikh). Conceived as a long-term program of archaeological research in the Jabbul plain,2 the project's primary goal is the investigation of the de- velopmental trajectory of complex societies in the region in the Early, Middle, and Late Bronze peri- ods (ca. 3000-1200 B.C.). Moving beyond the tradi- tional emphasis on the elite and monumental, we aim to focus on domestic as well as public contexts, lower social strata as well as elites, issues of economy and subsistence as well as political history, and re- gional issues as well as site-specific problems. codirectors; Sally Dunham, site supervisor and small finds ana- lyst; Ryan Byrne, Matthew Johnson, John McHugh, John Nichols, Alice Petty, and Daniel Rogart, site supervisors; Jill Weber, zooarchaeologist; and Nel Loosbroek, ceramics analyst.

Map of Syria withJabbul plain inset Located between Aleppo and the Euphrates val- ley, the Jabbul plain served historically as an impor- tant conduit between western Syria and Mesopotamia (fig. 1). Our research locus, Tell Umm el-Marra (fig. 2), is the largest Bronze Age site in the Jabbul (ca. 25 ha) and is perhaps to be identified as ancient Tuba. The first stage of the project (1994-1995) consisted of broad horizontal excavations in five major areas and two perpendicular transects of 2 x 2 m excavat- ed squares. In general, these results revealed a se- quence of EB, MB, and LB phases succeeded, after a hiatus, by Hellenistic and Roman settlement (table 1).

In May-July 1996 and 1997, we implemented the project's second research stage, with the following goals: broadened exposure of EB remains and inves- tigation of the EB-MB transition, sampling of previ- ously uninvestigated components of the site, intensified analysis of archaeobotanical and faunal data, and initiation of regional and environmental studies.

Tell Umm el-Marra First is the emergence of complex, urbanized soci- ety in the Syrian EB ca. 2600-2500 B.C., an issue that has received considerable attention for the Syr- ian Jezireh but less so in the west, with the notable exception of Ebla. Explanatory paradigms advanced for this phenomenon have focused on the effect of southern Mesopotamian contacts, the mobilization of agricultural surpluses by emerging elites, and the role of wealth, finance, and international trade, but more data and models of greater sophistication are needed.4 Second is the hypothesized collapse of urban societies at the end of the EB. Since it has become apparent that complex societies are not inherently stable systems but are subject to episodes of insta- bility and decentralization, collapse has become an 4Weiss 1983, 39-52; Schwartz 1994, 153-74; Peltenburg et al. 1996, 1-28. 5Weiss et al. 1993, 995-1004; Wilkinson 1997, 67-106. 6van Loon 1992, 103-7; Cooper 1998, 271-80; Wilkinson issue of great interest in the study of early complex societies. The precise character, explanation, and even existence of urban collapse at the end of the Syrian EB, however, is a subject of considerable de- bate.5 At present, we can observe large-scale deser- tion of sedentary occupations in the upper and lower Khabur regions, reduction or abandonment of urban centers in the middle Euphrates, and sig- nificant material culture breaks in western Syria (e.g., Hama). In the early second millennium (= MB I in western Syria, ca. 2000-1800 B.C.), evidence from the middle and upper Euphrates indicates that small, self-reliant communities survived in an environment largely devoid of urban centers and regional site hierarchies.6 Our third problem of interest concerns the next 1990; Weiss et al. 1993.

"turn" of the developmental cycle: how do complex societies revive and regenerate themselves after ur- ban and state disintegration? And why do some so- cieties recentralize while others do not? To address this issue, we aim to investigate the resurgence of complex, urban societies by the MB II period (ca. 1800-1600 B.C.), when powers like Yamhad, Mari, and the extensive kingdom founded by Shamshi- Adad emerged. While discussions of the regenera- tion of complex societies are still in their infancy, several approaches have been offered. In her re- view of the life histories of urban-based Mesoamer- ican states, J. Marcus observes that such entities typically expanded early in their lifespans, after which provincial centers broke away and eclipsed their former overlords, becoming the capitals of new and more powerful states.7 The Syrian data, howev- er, do not conform comfortably to this model, since MB political centers largely replicate those of EB. Other approaches hypothesize a survival of diverse aspects of state societies in the period of collapse, allowing for their subsequent reconstitution. G. Schwartz, for example, has advanced a model for the period following the Uruk expansion in Syria in which lower-level administrative structures sur- vived as smaller, simpler polities that re-formed into states through competition and conflict.8 P. Wat- tenmaker hypothesizes that state economic and ideological structures (e.g., economic specializa- tion) survived state disintegration in post-EB east- ern Anatolia, allowing for the eventual resurgence of state societies.9 Arguing along similar lines, Graf- fam proposes that the smaller-scale polities that emerged after the collapse of the Tiwanaku state retained and intensified organizational strategies of the collapsed state.10 Individual variables that also may have been instrumental in the regeneration of complex so- 7Marcus 1989, 201-8; Marcus 1992, 392-411; 1998, 59-94. 8 Schwartz 1994, 153-74. 9Wattenmaker 1994, 193-208.

Apart from these specific research foci, the broad time span afforded by survey results and the occu- pation sequence at Umm el-Marra allows for a con- sideration of long-term developments in the region and site. In this context, the shifting cycles of urbanization and deurbanization, and central- ization and decentralization can be studied over the "longue duree." The following report presents the results of the 1996-1997 seasons of excavation and survey. The discussion of architecture, stratigraphy, and pot- tery, while decidedly preliminary, provides data on the foundation of the site in EB and on the transition from EB to MB, allowing for a consider- ation of urban collapse and revival. Botanical and faunal analyses address similar developmental is- sues; they are also significant as the first studies of ancient plant and animal utilization in the Jabbul. Widening our focus, the survey data supply a broad- er chronological and spatial range for the consid- eration of changes in human societies in theJabbul.

The Acropolis East produced a sequence of EB and MB II levels with a conspicuous occupational gap in between. In this area, excavations were conduct- ed in two 8 x 10 m units that had yielded LB and MB II phases in the 1995 season (1314/3882 and 1314/3870).13 Immediately below the MB II levels excavated in 1995, we encountered domestic architecture asso- ciated with EB ceramics of the late third millenni- um BC (Umm el-Marra IV). This result suggests a hiatus of two centuries or more in the occupation of the Acropolis East. In the latest EB phase a, the southern excavation unit (1314/3870) contained at least seven rooms of residential character with pottery vessels and other domestic paraphernalia such as grinding stones and spindle whorls in situ (fig. 3).14 Debris outside one of the rooms yielded a flat-bladed leaf-shaped copper/bronze dagger and two apparent chisels. In contrast to the archi- tecture exposed in the southern unit, an open space 13In 1997 removal of MB II domestic architecture previous- ly exposed in the northern unit 1314/3882 (Curvers and Schwartz 1997, fig. 10, rooms 6-7) revealed a piglet skeleton below the house walls and the pit burial of an infant in the area south of room 7. 14Almost all the excavated architecture referred to in this of pits and midden strata were contemporary with phase a in the northern unit. The ceramic assemblage associated with phase a (fig. 4) included "EB IVB" types comparable to those found at Mardikh IIB2, Amuq J, and late Selenka- hiye such as goblets with collared necks (fig. 4.1), shallow bowls with vertical rims (fig. 4.8), brown plat- ters with pitted bases,'5 Painted Simple Ware calic- iform goblets (fig. 4.2-3), and Smeared Wash Ware, in addition to more general later third-millenni- um (EB IV) types, such as gray spiral burnish ware (fig. 4.4), corrugated caliciform goblets,16 and cook- ing ware jars with triangular lugs (fig. 4.11). In the preceding EB phase b, domestic struc- tures with lime-plastered floors sometimes in- stalled above a layer of cobbles were identified both in the northern and southern excavation units, with an open zone in between. Four earlier phases (c-f) were uncovered in limited sound- ings in the southern excavation unit associated with mid/late third millennium pottery (Umm el-Marra V-EB IVA and perhaps earlier) includ- ing fine thin-walled sherds with painted horizon- report consisted of stone substructures with mudbrick super- structures.

If the figurines were used for apotropaic rituals, one might expect that they were ritually broken, but we could not discern whether the breakage was deliberate.20 An alternative interpre- tation might entail the pious burial of divine im- '9Although they are usually found out of context, examples of figurines discovered in situ are attested in houses at Selen- kahiye on the middle Euphrates, east of Umm el-Marra. An- thropomorphic figurines were found under room floors in three cases, inside a room niche, and below a doorsill (van Loon 1973, 148; 1979, 99-103). 20According to Voigt's cross-cultural survey, complete or frag- mentary figurines used as vehicles of sympathetic magic "may be deposited within the fabric of domestic structures (within walls or floors, beneath floors, especially at thresholds)," (Voi- gt 1983,190). ForNeo-Assyrian epigraphic and archaeological data concerning the ritual burial of apotropaic figures below house floors, see Wiggermann 1992; Green 1983,87-96. Note also the discovery of unbaked fragmentary clay figurines and miniature vessels below the floor of the main hall in the LB ages revered by individual households.21 Acropolis West: MB I Occupation. In the Acropolis West area, excavations were renewed in the 10 x 20 m trench 1228/3860, where the 1995 excavations had revealed MB II domestic architecture. Below the MB II houses was a 0.8-1.9 m deposit of ashy strata associated with MB II sherds. Given the results from the Acropolis East, we had expected to encounter third millennium (EB) re- mains directly below MB II. This expectation was confounded, however, by the appearance of two ar- chitectural phases with pottery of the early MB peri- od (MB I = Mardikh IIIA, Umm el-Marra IIId). We conclude, therefore, that some parts of the site (e.g., Acropolis East) were abandoned in the early sec- ond millennium, while others remained occupied in this transitional period. The later of the two MB I phases included a multiroom rectilinear house (fig. 7) and an open area to its north. The MB I pottery included large closed vessels with a thick everted rim and a horizontal raised ridge below the neck (fig. 8.1-4). Attested with some fre- quency are comb-incised decorations, including a distinctive design consisting of alternating horizon- tal registers of undulating lines, horizontal combed bands, and diagonal lines of punctate incisions (fig. 8.12). Thin-walled goblets with a slightly rounded biconical shape and everted bead rim were also com- mon (fig. 8.8-9). Shallow carinated bowls with thick walls and triangular rims formed another frequent type (fig. 8.10-11), and cooking pots had angular everted necks, as in later MB contexts at Umm el- Marra.22 Painted sherds belonged to the Syro-Cili- cian group well-known from Alalakh as well as other west Syrian categories (fig. 8.13-16).23 Below the MB I occupation were late EB strata (Umm el-Marra IV and perhaps V). Most of the ex- cavated area had no visible architectural traces, but two building phases were noted on the east and northwest. Excavation below the earlier EB archi- tectural phase in the east yielded hard red soil with- Hammam et-Turkman VIII palace, interpreted as an apotropa- ic or votive deposit (Rossmeisl and Venema 1988, 571-3). 21 For this interpretation, see Liebowitz 1988, 27-32; van Loon 1973, 148. 22 Curvers and Schwartz 1997, fig. 24.7. 23Tubb 1983, 49-62. While there are points of general sim- ilarity, the assemblage departs in some ways from that of Mardikh IIIA, suggesting regional differentiation. E.g., the carinated bowls with concave upper bodies so common at Ebla are absent at Umm el-Marra. Comparing the Umm el-Marra MB I assem- blage with that ofEbla, L. Nigro (pers. comm.) identified many Ebla MB IB types (ca. 19th century B.C.), as well as MB IA examples (ca. 20th century B.C.). Cf.

City Wall Trench, West Area A. Significant results were obtained with respect to the fortification of the site in the EB and MB periods in West Area A. Investiga- tion of the history of the city wall area, begun in 1995, continued in 1996 and 1997 with the extension of a 2 m wide east-west step trench 52 m from the top of the rampart area to the base of the tell slope (fig. 9). The trench was enlarged to a width of 5 m in the vicinity of a mudbrick pottery kiln. While we had previously concluded that red and brown vertically oriented bricks distributed along 7 m of the 2 m-wide trench were fallen remnants of an MB II city wall,24 the 1997 excavations revealed a layer of upright gray bricks below them oriented in a direction perpendicular to the bricks above. Such 24Curvers and Schwartz 1997, 215. 25 Cf., e.g., the Nippur Ur III Enlil temple, level V (McCown and Haines 1967, 6, pls. 7B, 25.2,3); an early second-millenni- a situation indicates a deliberate construction rath- er than a collapsed wall. As a result, we now inter- pret the evidence in terms of an MB II city wall consisting of alternate courses of bricks standing vertically, a technique attested from a diversity of third and second millennium contexts elsewhere.25 No evidence of any LB fortification has been de- tected. Downslope and to the west of the mudbricks, ex- cavation recovered evidence of two earth and pebble glacis constructions built against what appears to be an earthen rampart dating to the EB period. The latter construction had a clearly defined, smooth upper surface and consisted of brown soil with peb- bles and regularly spaced lenses of ash sloping down from east to west at a 45? angle. The EB date of this feature is clear, since the firebox of a pottery kiln containing EB ceramic wasters was dug into it.

MB I (Umm el-Marra IIId) house, Acropolis West unit 1228/3860. The view is toward the southwest. The earlier of the two glacis constructions, des- ignated the "red" glacis because of its reddish-brown soil, was built up against the outer face of the EB rampart (see fig. 10). This structure had a battered (i.e., outward sloping) revetment of stone boulders at its outer base standing 1.4 m high and 1.6 m thick, and horizontal "tongues" of gray clay were noted inside the exterior face of the glacis above the revetment. The later, or "white," glacis, so called because of its lenses of white limestone fragments and pebbles, was constructed against the red gla- cis. Like the latter feature, the white glacis had a stone revetment, measuring ca. 1.5-2.3 m high and 5.3 m thick, but the outer face of the revetment was not battered or sloping. Excavation on the inside of both revetments indicated that they consisted of boulders and cobbles heaped up against the earth and pebble material of the glacis and were not walls 26 Moats or ditches surrounding third- and early second-mil- lennium urban sites in Syro-Mesopotamia have been identi- fied at sites like Ebla, Selenkahiye, Titrish, Chuera, and Leilan. 27 In addition to red material with the appearance of natu- ral, virgin soil ostensibly from outside the tell, the glacis con- structions also contain ashy organic material presumably from the tell itself. The freestanding rampart at Ebla, dated to MB I, has a similar composition (Matthiae 1997a). 28 For MB glacis examples, see especially Gezer (field IV), with flush interior faces. The reddish, chalky soil or white limestone materials in the glacis constructions were probably dug just outside of the tell, resulting in the ditch or moat now encircling the site.26 Dating the two glacis constructions is difficult at present. Although it contained only EB sherds (EB IV, without any evidence of IVB types), the soil from the constructions might have been removed from elsewhere in the tell and need not signify an EB date.27 Since the red glacis appears to have been installed subsequent to the construction of the EB pottery kiln, is heaped against the EB rampart, and is unlikely to postdate the MB II city wall (see fig. 9), a late EB to MB II date is indicated. The white glacis must postdate the red glacis. Given the nu- merous parallels for similar constructions in both EB and MB, stylistic or architectural comparanda do not resolve the issue.28 which has "tongues" of clay, andAbou Dann6, west ofUmm el- Marra in theJabbul (Seger 1978, 34-45; Tefnin 1979, 49).

The kiln itself was a double-chamber updraft construction. The firing chamber was a domed rectangular structure built of mudbricks and mud (1.1 m extant height), whose 0.5 m thick mudbrick floor was perforated with holes to con- duct the heat from below (fig. 11). A coating of yellow and green vitrified layers was apparent on the inner faces of the superstructure and in the holes in the floor, and segments of vitrified clay were also found in the fill of the structure. Underneath the firing chamber was the firebox, a subterranean mudbrick structure dug into pre- existing tell deposits. Narrower than the firing chamber and 1.5 m high (fig. 12), the firebox had a circular stokehole located in the narrow- ing, eastern end of the structure. The inner fac- es of the firebox walls were vitrified with a yellow and green coating; ceramic slag, later third-mil- lennium (EB IV) pottery wasters, and a small gray spiral-burnished goblet were found inside.

The proliferation of specialized, more elaborate kilns may also signal an effort to increase fuel efficiency in the face of increased demand and a diminishing fuel supply resulting from deforestation (see "Plant Remains," below).30 Exploratory Excavations Four previously unexplored areas of the tell were investigated to determine whether extant remains had functional or chronological characteristics that differed from those previously encountered. Acropolis North. A sequence from MB II to the Hellenistic period was documented in the 8 x 10 m trench (1270/3936) opened west of the Belgian sounding SE in the Acropolis North Area. Below the fragmentary Hellenistic level (Umm el-Marra Ib) was LB domestic architecture (Umm el-Marra II). Much better preserved was the MB II phase 29 Examples occur at numerous Euphrates sites, such as Habuba Kabira North, Tell el-'Abd, Halawa, and Lidar Hoyfk, as well as Chuera and Leilan (lower town) in the SyrianJezireh (Strommenger 1980, 76-7; Bounni 1979, 50-2; Orthmann 1981,61-2; 1989,55-6). The shape of the Umm el-Marra kiln's firebox resembles that of Tell al-'Abd; a subterranean firebox smaller than the firing chamber above it as at Umm el-Marra is (upper) segment depicted above western (lower) segment. Note beneath (Umm el-Marra IIIa-c), which included two rooms of a domestic character in the eastern part of the trench, with two storage jars, grinding stones, and other implements in situ in the north- ern room (fig. 13). Against the exterior wall of the southern room were two small adjacent circular clay ovens, one of which had a clay andiron standing at its edge whose exterior face was incised with a large "x" surmounted by a "u." In the northwest corner of the northern room was a large block of mudbricks facing a niched construction to the west and form- ing an apparent entryway, suggestive of larger-scale (public?) architecture. Northeast Area. A northeast city gate had been identified by the Belgian excavations in area SF, with several phases dated tentatively to MB and EB.31 In order to expand this area and clarify the chronology of fortification, excavations were con- ducted north of the gate in 1997. Stratified prior to a Hellenistic wall was a large-scale MB II con- struction oriented NW-SE consisting of one or attested at Halawa, oven 1. Kilns are often located on site edg- es; although a location on the western limit of a site as at Umm el-Marra would seem to defeat the purpose of avoiding the kiln smoke, given northwesterly winds, the site ramparts to the east may have served as an effective buffer. 30Alizadeh 1985, 48. 31Tefnin 1983, 143. 990 I 2000] 429</page><page sequence="12">GLENN M.

In the corner formed by these two structures was an earth and pebble "massif' containing EB sherds; it is not clear if the two perpendicular constructions cut the earth and pebble massif (a rampart or glacis?) or were erected adjacent to it in a contemporaneous context. A 2 m-wide exploratory trench cut through the 12 m- wide brick and earth construction revealed another earth and pebble massif below it containing EB sherds. While the chronology and complete plan of these constructions remain to be clarified, evidence of large-scale MB fortification associated with the north- east gate seems clear. Southwest Area.

Below was LB domestic architecture, two phases of which were also exposed in small soundings to the east. Southeast Area. Two Hellenistic and two LB phas- es were excavated in the southeast in an 8 x 10 m unit (1373/3760). In the later LB phase was a mul- tiroom building of specialized character. Its north- eastern room had four brick cubicles with a cruciform channel between them (fig. 14). The surface of the brick cubicles had been covered with pebbles that were in turn overlain by a relatively thin deposit of fine black ash. To the west, an adja- cent room only partly excavated had a similar de- posit of fine black ash in association with a circular clay oven. The southern room of the building had been badly disturbed by modern burial pits and did not yield any specialized features. An interpre- tation of the activities taking place in this building might involve baking bread with heated pebbles on a flat surface, a practice attested in Iran.33 Just outside this building against the stone substruc- ture in the northeast corner, a small terra-cotta mold- made figurine of a seated god was found (fig. 15). The deity sports a long beard and wears a multi- horned crown surmounted by a crescent enfolding a disk probably representing the sun and moon; his hands rest on his knees, and his garment includes two long straps across the shoulders. The crown is reminiscent of that worn by the figure of the "Jabbul head" now in the Louvre.34 Although three-dimen- sional metal representations of enthroned males are well known in MB/LB Syria, and stone examples are attested (e.g., at Ras Shamra), clay specimens are rare. Summary The 1996-1997 excavations at Umm el-Marra have begun to provide evidence for the earlier pe- riods of occupation at the site. The foundation of the community in the mid-third millennium is now apparent, and the data suggest that the site quickly attained the status of a large and fortified commu- nity. In the late third millennium, at the end of EB, some areas of the site were abandoned, while oth- ers survived in the minimally documented MB I period. MB II sees the community reoccupied on a large and prosperous scale, accompanied by the for this reference. 34Dussaud 1926,341.

Phase 1 entails taxonomic identifica- tion, counting and weighing of all fragments, and taking mea- surements when possible. Identifications were facilitated by an extensive modern comparative collection and reference literature. Comparative material was generously supplied by Curvers, who transported the collection from Beirut to Umm el-Marra, from a collection created and maintained at the Beirut Archaeological Centre. Phase 2 (notyet begun) involves iden- pie derives from the Acropolis East and West; the majority of the LB material is from the large trash pit in West Area B. Field analysis consisted of phase 1 of M. Zeder's two phase system.36 The preliminary results of this analysis have raised many interesting questions about the eco- nomic focus of the ancient population at Umm el- Marra. Most strikingly, the data indicate that the inhabitants of this community heavily exploited resources found in an open steppe environment, a trend that increased steadily from EB to MB. The focus of this exploitation appears to have been the hunting of onagers, which reached a peak in MB II. In the LB period the faunal assemblage reflects a greater diversification in the subsistence economy, with a shift away from the hunting of onager and a greater reliance on cattle. Throughout the se- quence, the ancient inhabitants do not seem to have been particularly choosy about their diet: all sourc- es of protein, including dog, appear to have been consumed. Bronze Age Animal Exploitation Sheep, goat, equid, cattle, gazelle, pig, and dog (see following discussion) comprise the major food animals in all periods of occupation (table 2). Oth- er mammals, such as hare, tortoise, fox, and deer, are only minor components of the faunal assem- blage. Few birds were found, but those identified include ostrich, goose, bustard, and pigeon or dove.37 The single ostrich first phalanx (from an MB II deposit) adds Umm el-Marra to a growing list of MB sites from which bones, rather than eggshell, of this animal have been found.38 A comparison of the different periods within the Bronze Age shows gradual change over time in the relative abundance of different species. Sheep and goat are nearly always the most numerous animals relative to the other major species. Their contribu- tion to the total assemblage decreases over time, however, from ca. 65% in EB to 50% in LB. Equids are always the next most common animal. Unlike tifying such variables as age and sex as well as bone modifica- tions such as butchery and burning. 37Avery small sample (6 samples) of bird bone was brought back from Syria.

Equids are far more significant rela- tive to sheep and goat when quantified by weight (as opposed to counts of NISP, that is, number of individual specimens). The greater weight of the equids is a reflection of the larger size of those ani- mals, and a greater amount of meat per animal, than the smaller sheep and goat. It also reflects the dep- osition of large portions of individual equids (sev- eral elements of a single animal) in the same place, and thus possibly differential processing. Among the equids, onager, donkey, and, in MB and LB, horse are all present, but onager is the most nu- merous (see below). Cattle, pig, gazelle, and dog are the other major animals found. Although these species are present throughout the Bronze Age occupation, the pro- portion of pig and cattle steadily decreases over time, while the proportion of gazelle and dog in- creases. Of the wild animals, onager, gazelle, hare, fox, tortoise, and ostrich are all to be found in the steppe. The goose and bustard are animals of the field and grass, while the deer is the only animal that is to be found in a wooded environment. Clearly, the steppe was an important environment around Umm el-Marra, and it was exploited almost to the exclusion of any other. Deer is very rarely found and is mainly represented by antler frag- ments. Every other animal would have been either hunted or husbanded on either the steppe or on the agricultural fields surrounding Umm el-Marra. In fact, if it can be assumed that large herds of sheep and goat were herded in the steppe, then approxi- mately 85% (in EB) to 95% (in later MB II) of ani- mals in our sample were either hunted or husbanded in the steppe. This pattern is corrobo- rated by the botanical data, which show that wood fuel may have been scarce (see "Plant Remains," following) and indicates a steppic environment in the site vicinity. The complete lack of any lacustrine species is surprising, given the proximity of Umm el-Marra to the saline Jabbul Lake. Salt is of considerable im- portance for consumption and as an ingredient in leather tanning, which may have been an impor- tant industry at Umm el-Marra, as faunal data indi- cate (see "An MB Steppe Economy," following). Two possible implications are (1) the absence of the lake in the Bronze Age, or (2) inaccessibility to the resource. The latter could be a result of social or political boundaries or a lack of the labor, technol- ogy, or knowledge to exploit the lacustrine envi- ronment and mine the salt. 434 [AJA 104</page><page sequence="17">EXCAVATION AND SURVEY IN THE JABBUL PLAIN % NISP By Phase 100% 90% - 80% - ...... 70% - _____ 60% - - can 50% - I I _: I:_UIgaz EB MB I early MB 11 laIIter bos B1LIIIII 10% ...... 0% ~EB MB I early~MBl~ 1 l~IIaterMBII MBII- LBI 40%?? ...... --~~II ? miil ??????? jf ;r :i:~~~~~~~~s/ 30%~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~: - 20%?? -?; EB??? M B I . earlyM IltrM IMIL Fig. 16. NISP comparison An MB Steppe Economy: Specialized Onager Hunting The steppe became even more heavily exploited over time, a trend beginning in MB I but becoming much more pronounced in early MB II. Equids and gazelle increase in relative abundance to all do- mestic species except dog, which also increases (fig. 16). In later MB II on the Acropolis West, sheep and goat comprise less than 40% of the assemblage. Further, sheep and goat show a slight shift in ratio with respect to one another, likewise indicative of increased exploitation of the steppe. Although the ratio of sheep to goat closely approximates 1:1 in all periods, sheep slightly outnumber goat in EB, goat outnumber sheep in MB, and the pattern reverses again in LB. Because goats are generally more suit- ed to aridity than sheep, the overall pattern of change during MB is toward animals that are better suited to a drier environment. Interestingly, N.F. Miller ("Plant Remains," following) suggests that the area around Umm el-Marra was more steppic in the MB than in the EB. It is difficult to determine, however, whether the increased exploitation of the steppe was a result of climatic or cultural changes. The paucity of sites to the east of Umm el-Marra in MB revealed by the regional survey data (see "A Survey on the Jabbul Plain," following) might have opened the steppe to the Umm el-Marra inhabit- ants by removing social boundaries. Why did the steppe become more important in MB? One might suggest that climatic or environ- mental degradation expanded the steppe bound- aries, or that an opportunity arose to exploit valuable steppe resources. Interpretation of this shift in fo- cus rests in part on the species identification of the equid remains, because the proportion of equids in the assemblage is so high. A large number of donkeys may suggest the importance of long-dis- tance trade, while a large number of onager may suggest the importance of onager meat and hides. Species distinctions of bones of the genus Equus are difficult to make because of extreme morpho- logical similarity and overlap of absolute size of in- dividual bones between species. The proportions of certain elements, however, differ between don- key and onager.

Plot of equid astragali from Umm el-Marra: Y-axis = greatest breadth (GB)/greatest height (GH); X-axis = GB the astragalus protrudes farther in donkey than in onager, giving the donkey the appearance of great- er breadth to depth in the caudal view.39 That dis- tinction was thought to be manifest metrically by a greater ratio of the breadth of the facies articularis (Bfa) to the depth of the facies articularis (Dfa) in donkey;40 however, this ratio does not appear to dis- tinguish reliably between the two species. Instead, the distinction has been preliminarily found to be expressed as an index of the ratio of greatest breadth (GB) to greatest height (GH), plotted against the GB.41 A series of 24 astragali from Umm el-Marra were plotted according to this index. The plotted data (fig. 17) fall into two distinct categories, with a single outlier at the very top of the plot, and an indeterminable bone located midway between the two groups. Comparing astragali from known onager and known donkey (not included here), we can conclude that the group with the high- er y-axis value and lower x-axis value are donkeys. This correlates to the known interspecific morpho- logical distinction based on the medial tubercle. The group with the lower y-axis value and higher x-axis value are onagers. In the scatter plot for the Umm el- Marra equid astragali, only two bones fall between 39Meadow 1986, 266-301; Uerpmann 1986, 246-65; 1991, 12-33. 40 Meadow 1986, 266-301. 41 Weber (forthcoming). Equid measurements are after Eisenmann 1986, 67-116. 42 Onager x donkey hybrids are known to have existed in northern Syria from mid-third-millennium documents from both Ebla and Tell Beydar (Archi 1998, 1-16; Van Lerberghe the two groups. It is not clear to which species these belong. The bones are too small to have come from a horse, but the possibility that they come from an equid hybrid cannot be ruled out.42 Of the 24 astragali plotted, 18 are identified as onager and 4 as donkey. If the distribution of the astragali is representative of the assemblage as a whole, then ca. 75% of the equid bones come from onager.43 Further evidence supporting the identi- fication of these animals as onager rather than don- key is provided by the absence of bones from infants and the rarity of bones fromjuvenile animals. Young- er animals would be expected, if many donkeys were being raised at the site. Thus it seems that hunting became more important in MB than it was in EB. This conclusion is also supported by the increase of gazelle over the same time period. It is also noteworthy that dog increases through- out the MB along with the wild animals. The covari- ance between wild species and dogs may indicate that dogs were used to hunt the animals. Indeed, dogs are shown on third-millennium seals in what are interpreted as hunting scenes,44 and they are clearly depicted hunting onager on late Assyrian palace reliefs. Gazelle and onager sometimes form 1996,107-18). These particular "odd" bones derive from early MB II levels and therefore could be the hybrid of a horse and another equid. 43 It is not certain that the other elements will follow the same pattern. Differential butchering may result in a variable distribution of body parts for onager and donkey. 44Jans et al. 1998, 155-94.

Hides were economically im- portant commodities, and a focus on their produc- tion would probably be highly profitable. Both gazelle and equid bones have been found at Umm el-Marra that were fashioned into implements. In addition, a large number of awls were recovered at Umm el-Mar- ra by the Belgian team from MB deposits.46 It has been suggested that polish on the awl points was obtained by piercing leather. The timing of these awl finds correlates to the increased exploitation of equid and gazelle. Eventually, butchery evidence from the bones themselves may help to determine whether the hides were utilized. Flaying often leaves characteristic cut marks on bones such as the mandi- ble or on the distal portions of limbs. Extremities of equids were found together in the recent excava- tions, notably the phalanges, metapodials, and car- pals and tarsals. These bones are often removed as a "package" with an animal hide, and their disposal together may indicate skinning. This evidence, while only suggestive at present, makes the absence of evidence for exploitation of salt marsh resources all the more surprising, since salt was a major ingredient in tanning. Data culled from the mid-third millennium administrative ar- chives of Tell Beydar, however, indicate a high de- gree of specialization and segregation of production or acquisition of basic commodities such as salt, pig's fat, barley, and wine, which may have been the case in MB as well. Thus the inhabitants of Umm el- Marra may have specialized in producing animal hides, but some other entity may have specialized in producing the salt that was essential to the en- deavor. Conversely, the acquisition of hides may have been an industry independent of tanning. Whether or not the acquisition of hides was of prime importance, our evidence points to direct exploitation of the steppe for its economically valu- able resources. The steppe had been extensively utilized in EB, when the site was founded, and this practice simply intensified in MB. If increased steppe exploitation was the result of climatic dete- rioration in MB, then cattle should have exhibited a greater decline, and sheep and goat-which are relatively well suited to grazing on the steppe- should not have decreased as much. 45 Groves and Willoughby 1981, 321-54. 46Doyen 1986, 30-74. 47 Bates and Lees 1977, 824-41. Late Bronze Diversification In LB another shift in exploitation occurs. Cattle increase in significance, and sheep once again out- number goat. The large percentage of gazelle (ca. 8%) indicates that the steppe was still exploited. Horse and donkey are relatively more abundant among the equid remains, and onager exploited less intensively, while dog almost disappears from the LB assemblage. The correlation with a decrease in onager and dog but not gazelle may indicate that gazelle were not hunted with the aid of dogs but with a different technology than were the onager. Overall, there is a greater evenness in exploitation, with several species exploited in relatively large numbers. The majority of the LB sample studied in 1997 derived from a large trash pit in West Area B rather than from the Acropolis, where the EB and MB sam- ples originated. This does not seem to be the cause of the changes in relative abundance of animals, however, since a small sample examined from the Acropolis West-where the majority of the equid and canid remains were found in the earlier peri- ods-did not have a single equid or canid bone. Instead, sheep, goat, and gazelle constitute the majority of the finds in that area. The LB reduction in steppe exploitation may have been the result of a contracted steppe bound- ary, perhaps because of an effort to cultivate more of the land surrounding the site, made possible by an amelioration of climatic conditions. By the same token, onager herds may have been reduced, or their products may have become less valuable. The latter might be expected if regional economies were more generalized and locally focused during the LB, thus producing less for exchange.47 Dog as Food All of the animal species found at Umm el-Marra appear to have been used as food, including dogs and donkeys. Bones of the latter two species occur in the same contexts as other food waste and occur in the same condition. Specifically, many of the dog bones had been broken, butchered, and burned like the other, more traditional, food animals. In fact, 7.1% of the measured bones of dog had been burned;48 only the proportion of burnt equid bones (11.5%) was higher. While it is difficult to say what proportion of the burned equid material represents donkey, at least two donkey bones were found burned. Most of 48 In phase 1 analysis, burning is only noted on bones that are measured. 2000] 437</page><page sequence="20">GLENN M. SCHWARTZ ET AL. the other species showed burning on ca. 3% of their bones, with only pig bones having no signs of burn- ing. While cut marks are not usually noted in phase 1 analysis, their incidence on a large number of dog bones was observed, particularly on bones of the skull, neck, and pelvis, indicating butchery. Bro- ken, cut, and burned bones were typical of all ani- mals, suggesting that dogs and donkeys were accorded the same treatment as "regular" food ani- mals such as sheep, goat, cattle, gazelle, and onag- er. These bone modifications largely resemble the remains of kitchen waste. Individuals of every spe- cies were found in all states of deposition, however. Some had been thrown whole into the trash, while others had undergone processing consistent with utilization of various products, including hides and meat. It is clear that the predepositional condition of the dog and donkey bones was the same as that of the "typical" food animals. The only nonconsump- tive explanation for similar treatment of all animal bones would hold that they were cut up and burnt in preparation for disposal. However, chopping up the bones, in addition to burning them, would seem to be an excessive sanitary precaution, although not implausible. Alternatively, if the bones were used as fuel, then fragmentation may have afforded some benefit. The utilization of bone as a fuel is certainly a possibility, given the lack of wood fuel around the site (see "Plant Remains," following). The most parsimonious explanation at present, however, is that the dogs and donkeys were eaten, along with the other animals. Of course, the fact that dogs and donkeys were eaten does not necessarily mean that humans were doing the eating, or that the animals were eaten as a standard meal. Ur III period documentary sourc- es specifically mention donkeys as food for dogs, and meat, bones, urine, and feces of dog were used for medicinal and magical purposes.49 Finally, hu- man reaction to environmental stress is varied but often results in atypical behaviors such as eating foods outside the "normal" category.50 It is equally likely, however, that dog was simply an accepted, though infrequent, food source. Butchered bones of dog have been found at Neolithic Sabi Abyad, where they are also interpreted as food remains.51 Animals and Environment in theJabbul Plain For the first time, we have a picture of Bronze 49 Mander 1994. The Chicago Assyrian Dictionary notes several "uses" for different parts of dog. 50Forbes 1989, 87-97. Age subsistence practices in this area occupying a strategic position between the urban hubs of, suc- cessively, Ebla and the state of Yamhad, the north- western stretch of the Syrian "desert," and the Euphrates valley. The desert-steppe was a clear fo- cus of animal procurement strategies. Large num- bers of gazelle and onager were hunted, and sizeable herds of sheep and goat were readily avail- able. At the same time, the inhabitants of Umm el- Marra obtained meat from every available source, including animals not typically thought of as food animals, such as dogs and donkeys. Ultimately, increased resolution of the archaeo- logical record may be necessary to explain this pic- ture of shifting exploitation patterns. Seasonal cycles in the availability of specific resources may vastly affect patterns of exploitation. Also, social and functional differences within a site may result in unique patterns of animal deposition between site areas. Further research in the Jabbul plain will help to explain whether the patterns noted here are local phenomena or part of a greater regional design. PLANT REMAINS Umm el-Marra is located in the Syrian steppe zone at about the 300 mm annual precipitation isohyet in a region suitable for dry farming.52 In the past decade or so, massive irrigation works have dramat- ically changed the landscape, and so it is not easy to imagine the vegetation that would occur under tra- ditional agriculture and pastoralism. Scrub vegeta- tion around the site is affected and even maintained by human and animal activity, while the hills on the western edge of the plain are covered with trees characteristic of Mediterranean forest (oak, pine, and others).53 Twenty-five flotation samples from Umm el-Mar- ra were analyzed for this report. Of these, four de- rive from EB deposits, nine from MB fills, seven from LB fills, and five from LB burned architecture excavated in West Area A (table 3). Ordinarily, if one has enough samples, one can get an overview of "cultural fill"; if burned stored crop remains are found in a sufficient number of deposits, differ- ences with the cultural fill remains can further in- form interpretations. Plant remains from MB or LB sites have not been investigated on a large scale, but several reports on small groups of samples are available. These include results from Hadidi in the 51 Cavallo 1996, 475-520. 52 van Zeist and Bottema 1991, fig. 3. 53 Zohary 1973. 438 [AJA 104</page><page sequence="21">EXCAVATION AND SURVEY IN THE JABBUL PLAIN Table 3.

Hadidi, Hammam et-Turkman, Sweyhat, and Selenkahiye all lie in the Syrian steppe zone on or near the Eu- phrates. Unlike Umm el-Marra, none is close to the Mediterranean forest zone. Cultigens and Other Economic Plants The two main cereal types encountered in the samples are two-row barley (Hordeum vulgare var. dis- tichum) and bread wheat or durum (Triticum aesti- vum/durum). Barley outweighs wheat (4.43 g:0.58 g) and occurs in more samples (20:17). It consti- 54van Zeis and Bakker-Heeres 1985, 247-316; van Zeist et al. 1988, 705-15. 55 Miller 1997b, 95-122; van Zeist and Bakker-Heeres 1985. tutes about 95% of the identified cereal from the EB, and about 85% from the MB and LB periods. Barley also predominates in the cultural fill sam- ples at the other steppe sites in the rainfall agricul- ture zone, presumably because barley is more drought tolerant than wheat.57 Cereals are frequent- ly recognizable in fragmentary form, so weight rath- er than count is reported on tables 4 and 5. Rachis fragments of both bread wheat or durum and barley also occur at Umm el-Marra, along with those of emmer (Triticum dicoccum) or einkorn (T monococcum). Note that rachis fragments are likely to represent either crop-processing debris or re- mains of animal fodder. We can now say that in EB and MB samples, barley rachis fragments vastly out- number those of wheat. The situation is somewhat reversed in the LB samples, with wheat rachis frag- ments outnumbering those of barley.

Two samples in particular had un- usually high (at this point uncounted) amounts: an MB II ashy pit with dung ash (1320/3866-010) and an LB ashy pit (1242/3854-006). A small amount of lentil (Lens), three grasspea (Lathyrus), and a single chickpea (Cicer) suggest pulse crops were available. Similar low proportions occur in Hammam et-Turkman cultural fill. Puls- es commonly seem to be underrepresented in ar- chaeobotanical assemblages of mixed fill, and it is difficult to assess their economic or dietary signif- icance. At Hadidi, van Zeist inferred that pulses were significant crops there based on several con- centrations of the seeds.58 Several fruits are represented in small quanti- ties: fig (Ficus), olive (Olea europaea), and grape (Vi- tis vinifera). The fig could be wild, but the grape and olive are most probably from cultivated plants. Nowadays, an occasional olive tree can be seen on the road between Aleppo and Raqqa, but neither olive nor grape is well suited to the climate in the immediate vicinity of the site. The small number of such seeds may reflect the occasional deposit of fruit traded in from the west or north. Two other economic plants have been recognized: coriander (Coriandrum sativum) and safflower (Cartha- mus cf. tinctorius).

A few achenes have also been found at Hammam et-Turkman and Selenkahiye.62 Wild and Weedy Types Wild and weedy types constitute a significant part of the assemblage. Most have been determined to genus or family at best, and so it is not possible to provide a detailed discussion of habitat or use. Note, however, that none of the identified types is unexpected, for all are known from the floras of Syria and southeastern Turkey; indeed, most have been recognized in archaeobotanical assemblages from the region. Identified only to genus, most can- not be assigned to particular ecological niches. Al- though none show clear increases or decreases through time, a few types warrant some additional comment. Artemisia. Fourteen tiny seeds are tentatively iden- tified as Artemisia (sagebrush), a dominant plant in much of the steppe zone of the Near East. In some areas it is thought to have replaced native grass- lands through overgrazing, but such small seed numbers cannot illustrate any trends. Chenopodiaceae. As suggested by their English common names, many of the members of the goose- foot family are salt-tolerant plants (e.g., Salsola [salt- wort] and Suaeda [seablite]). One loose seed of Atriplex and several enclosed by bracteoles were seen in two EB samples. There is no reason to assume that these plants were associated with the salt lake, since many of the species grow on the steppe or in fields. Carex. Sedges (Cyperaceae), such as Carex, typi- cally are plants of moist ground and frequently grow along streams and ditches and in low-lying areas. Fabaceae. Many herbaceous members of the clo- ver family, both wild and cultivated, are favored as fodder. This is true of all of the genera reported here: Astragalus, Trifolium or Melilotus, Medicago, and Trigonella. Some could be field weeds, but many spe- cies of Astragalus and Trigonella are also established plants of the steppe. Prosopis is a small shrub. Thanks to a very deep taproot, once it becomes established in agricultural fields it is very difficult to eradicate. Sheep and goat eat the nutritious pods. In antiqui- ty it seems at least sometimes to have been collect- ed for human consumption, judging from a small collection of pods found at Assyrian Nimrud.63 A 62van Zeist and Waterbolk-van Rooijen 1992, 157-61. 63Helbaek 1966, 617. 64Feinbrun-Dothan 1986, 166. 65 Miller 1997b, fig. 6.7d, e. 66 Miller 1997b, fig. 6.4a. single pod segment of Alhagi (camel thorn) was also seen. Like Prosopis, it has a deep taproot. Most herbivores avoid its spiny branches. Poaceae. Grasses are generally plants of open ground. Some of those found would be native to the steppe; others would flourish in the disturbed ground of agricultural fields. Eremopyrum is the most numerous grass type in these samples. On phyto- geographical grounds, the most likely species is E. bonaepartis. This species grows in both steppe and field habitats.64 A very small grass seed designated cf. Phleum/Eragrostis is also quite numerous (equiva- lent to SW.Poaceae-15).65 Seeds designated cf. Tra- chynia distachya resemble closely the ones illustrated by Miller66 and van Zeist and Bakker-Heeres.67 A few seeds resemble SLK-B.68 Sanguisorba (=Poterium). One EB sample had 23 seeds that look like those of Sanguisorba; J. McCor- riston suggested this identification, and the seeds compare well with those illustrated by C. Townsend and E. Guest.69 Peganum harmala. Wild rue is represented by a two seeds. Because it is avoided by grazers, it tends to increase on overgrazed land. In archaeobotanical samples from northern Mesopotamia, it does not begin to appear until EB,70 presumably because graz- ing pressure had reached a critical point at that time. Discussion In interpreting charred archaeobotanical assem- blages, one first groups samples with similar pyric histories. At Umm el-Marra the samples from the West Area A burned architecture are not directly comparable to those from the deposits that did not result from general burning. The appropriateness of this separation is clear if one examines the data. Not only do the five LB West Area A samples have the most charcoal, and where measurable, the high- est densities of charred material, they also have the lowest seed-to-charcoal ratios. This is true when the weight of seeds, including cultigens, is used in the calculation, and when the wild seed count is used. That is, the burnt material is mostly from fallen roof beams or wooden furnishings. The remaining samples are from different kinds of cultural fill. Archaeobotanists generally consid- er a range of explanations for the occurrence of plant materials in cultural deposits, most commonly 67van Zeist and Bakker-Heeres 1985, fig. 7.1-3. 68van Zeist and Bakker-Heeres 1985, fig. 7.4-6; Miller 1997b, fig. 6.6e, f. 69Townsend and Guest 1966, pl. 26. 70Miller 1991, 156. 2000] 445</page><page sequence="28">GLENN M.

(in Near Eastern sites) crop-processing debris, fuel residues, burnt trash, or some combination of those substances.7 Attributing a cause of charring to any par- ticular seed or sample is virtually impossible, however. At Umm el-Marra none of the ordinary occupation de- bris samples stands out as individually interpretable, yet most are probably redeposited hearth sweepings. For example, an MB II oven area (1316/3880-008), where one might expect a high density of charred ma- terial, has a lower density of charred material than sam- ples from two pits and a room. Without reviewing all the arguments here,72it seems likely that most of the charred seeds from the cultural fill samples originated in dung fuel, with the exception of the fruit remains. Those samples have a mixed character, with varying proportions of charcoal and seeds of wild and cultivated plants. If crop food remains had been burnt accidentally, one might expect high concentrations relative to weed remains, yet seeds of wild and weedy plants are quite numerous relative to the quantities of cereal remains (for example, a wild-to-cereal [#:g] ratio of 800 is approximately equivalent to eight wild seeds to each cereal grain equivalent). Similarly, one might expect relatively high proportions of wheat relative to bar- ley, since wheat is generally preferred as food; at Umm el-Marra barley predominates in all samples with identified cereal grains. Given this line of reason- ing, one LB sample stands out as unusual (1373/ 3758-006, Southeast Area). From an ashy deposit, it had a low density of charred material (0.02 cereal/ volume [g/l]) but an unusually high proportion of seeds, both wild and cultivated. Tentatively interpret- ed as a bakery (see "Exploratory Excavations: South- east Area," above), perhaps this sample has a high proportion of crop-cleaning debris. There are still too few samples to allow firm con- clusions about any interpretation. Even so, it is worthwhile to compare some of the general charac- 71 E.g., Miller and Smart 1984, 5-28; Hillman 1984, 1-41. 72 See Miller 1996b, 526. teristics of the Umm el-Marra samples with those from other sites. In particular, at sites along the Eu- phrates, the wild and weedy-to-cereal ratio helps monitor ancient reliance on pastoralism (table 6). A high value, as at EB Sweyhat, is thought to indi- cate a heavy reliance on pastoralism, with herds being grazed in uncultivated land.73 Roughly con- temporary, the EB Umm el-Marra samples have a much lower value for this ratio, which suggests farm- ing was more important than at contemporary Swey- hat. The ratio is even lower in the MB and LB Umm el-Marra samples, which suggests even greater reli- ance on farming relative to pastoralism. The seed-to-charcoal ratio and the wild and weedy- to-charcoal ratio (table 6) have been used as a relative measure of tree cover at other sites.74 The numerator mostly consists of grain, and the ratio would reflect dung fuel relative to wood fuel. Consequently, lower values signify that more wood fuel was available. The higher seed-to-charcoal ratios of the MB could reflect the cutting of woody vegetation for fuel coincident with the revival of urban societies in that period (see "Introduction," above). By this measure, LB wood avail- ability was somewhat further reduced. There is some indication that the loss of woody vegetation started even earlier. Where EB Umm el- Marra appears to have had more wood fuel than in later times, it had less than Chalcolithic Hacinebi, although they lie in a similar rainfall zone. This result is perhaps not surprising, since fuel-inten- sive metallurgy developed during the years between the Hacinebi and Umm el-Marra occupations. Com- pared to EB levels at Sweyhat, Umm el-Marra seems not so poor in wood fuel. The environment around MB and LB Umm el-Marra, however, would have had even less woody vegetation than that at EB Sweyhat (table 6). If anything, the Umm el Marra seed to charcoal ratios are underestimates, because ratios of two samples were not calculable because of low 73Miller 1997a, 123-32. 74Miller 1990, 70-8; 1997a. 446 [AJA 104</page><page sequence="29">EXCAVATION AND SURVEY IN THE JABBUL PLAIN amounts of charcoal for the denominator. That is, wood was scarcer than the value of the average seed- to-charcoal ratios suggest. The values of the wild seed-to-charcoal ratio do not correspond to those of the seed-to-charcoal ra- tio, which reflects the amount of cereal rather than wild plants. With the small sample numbers in- volved, one can never discount random variation or functional differences in the deposits sampled. It is also possible that the wild seeds in some periods have high proportions of steppe plants, but in oth- ers field weeds predominate. Unfortunately, at the taxonomic levels of family genus (and sometimes even species) it is not possible to have a refined understanding of plant habitats. The salt lake is one habitat not represented in the plant remains. Several explanations can be pro- posed for the apparent lack of lacustrine types, the most obvious being that plants growing around the salt lake may not have been suitable for pasture or fodder and were thus unlikely to have been burned. Note that at the Euphrates river sites of the Bronze Age, there is little evidence of seeds of riverine plants, although the wood of the gallery forest was used.75 One might suppose that the primary use of the lake was salt production, which might not be reflected in the plant remains. If the examined samples accurately represent the plant remains and if the line of argument presented here is valid, one can argue for the following land use picture. In EB times relatively high proportions of wild seeds relative to cultigens suggest that ani- mals were pastured on the steppe; that is, there were large tracts of pasture land. Even so, grain fields were a significant part of the landscape (e.g., compared to the environs of Sweyhat). Relatively low proportions of seeds relative to charcoal suggests trees were present to some degree. The situation changes a little in MB and LB times. Low proportions of wild seeds suggest animals as well as people were eating grain, and ajump in the proportions of cultigen seeds relative to wood suggests that a broad expanse of agricultural fields lay on a plain essentially bare of trees because of earlier land clearance by humans. Orchards and vineyards are not part of this scene, although one might imagine individual tended trees or small plots maintained for fruit or timber. It is a little too soon in the analysis to integrate 75van Zeist and Bakker-Heeres 1985; Miller 1997b. 76The 1996 survey was planned as the first stage in a mul- tistage regional project. In the future we would hope to inves- tigate off-site features, land use patterns, and selected sites in the plant and animal data in anything approaching a definitive way, but it may be useful to report on the discussions between the archaeobotanist and the zooarchaeologist. Evidence suggests that simulta- neous with a significant increase in exploitation of the steppe for hunting between the EB and MB periods (the importance of equids rises), we see a decline in the use of the steppe for pasture (the wild-to-cereal ratio declines) and an intensification of agricultural activity (namely, growing fodder for the herds). Perhaps the steppe was reserved for hunting, while flocks of sheep and goat were herd- ed in proximity to the agricultural settlements. In that case, the decline in wild seeds in MB might represent a change in the division of labor (spe- cialized hunters coexisting with farmers). Alterna- tively, the change might reflect a seasonal distribution of labor, with flocks of domesticated animals being pastured on the steppe for some portion of the year. In either case, dung with abun- dant wild seeds would not have been brought to the settlement for use as fuel. Too few archaeobo- tanical and faunal samples have been analyzed to adequately address this issue, however. A SURVEY IN THE JABBUL PLAIN An archaeological survey of the region surround- ing Tell Umm el-Marra in the central and eastern Jabbul plain was conducted by the joint Johns Hop- kins-University of Amsterdam expedition from 5 May to 29 June 1996. Goals included the establishment of a regional ceramic sequence and the documenta- tion of changes in environment, settlement, and land use. While these objectives were only partly attained in this first field season, we are able to offer a prelim- inary overview of observed changes through time.76 The surveyed area extended from the Nahr edh- Dhahab watercourse east to the edge of the Euph- rates valley (ca. 35 km), and from the north and east shore of the Jabbul lake north to the arc of low hills bordering the plain (ca. 20-35 km) (fig. 18). The site of Tell Wasta, on a small island in the northwestern part of the Jabbul lake, was also visited, but the west- ern extent of the plain as it approaches Aleppo was outside our survey area. Topographically, the region consists of a flat limestone plain extending from the Jabbul lake to the arc of low rolling hills bordering the plain to the north; local soils are calcium-rich aridis- greater detail. Since surface collection of sites was sometimes hindered by abundant vegetation, we also hope to revisit rel- evant sites in a drier part of the year to obtain larger sherd samples. 447 2000]</page><page sequence="30">GLENN M.

Flowing south from the northern hills are wadis that incise the plain and empty into the saline Jabbul lake, forming an autonomous drainage system. Present-day annual precipitation declines from west to east, ranging from over 300 mm in the Nahr edh- Dhahab vicinity to 250-200 mm as one approaches the Euphrates valley.77 As the largest source of salt in Syria, Jabbul Lake enjoyed considerable economic importance in Medieval and subsequent periods, but earlier salt extraction remains to be documented. A total of 144 sites were identified, surface col- lected, and described. Since asphalt and dirt roads allowed access to many sites, travel in the plain was relatively unimpeded, especially after the harvests, when smaller side roads were no longer flooded from field irrigation. Sites were located using 1:200,000 maps, ground-level observation, and local infor- mants.78 Off-site reconnaissance was limited to the area immediately around each site; in a few cases, more extensive investigations were conducted when the limit of the site was unclear. In addition to 77Wirth 1971, map 3; Wilkinson 1994, fig. 1; van Zeist and Bottema 1991. We are grateful to T. Beach and S. Luzzader- Beach for the use of their geomorphological data. 78At each site a sketch map of the site and its immediate environs was produced, site area was calculated by pacing, and site location was established by a global positioning system. Diagnostic sherds and artifacts were collected from the site surfaces through judgment sampling without the use of transects or grids; multicomponent mounds exceeding 4 ha mounded sites or loci with surface artifacts, four underground water channels (qanats) and seven clus- ters of tomb shafts were also identified but are not included in the site totals per period listed below. The burial clusters, found in diverse parts of the survey region, included as many as 15 grave shafts dug into bedrock and are tentatively dated to the Hellenistic, Roman, or Late Antique periods. Of the sites located in 1996, 53 had been visited previously by the British team that conducted an archaeological reconnaissance of the region be- tween Aleppo and the Euphrates in 1939.79 The latter project was an important pioneering effort but was unavoidably hampered by limited knowl- edge of local ceramic chronologies. Survey data of varying quality are also available from adjacent re- gions including the Qoueiq valley to the west, the Madekh region to the southwest, Jebel Shbeit and Jebel Hass to the south, the Sajour drainage to the north, and the Euphrates valley to the east.80 Preliminary analysis of our data indicates the pres- ence of continuous occupation in the survey area were divided into quarters for more efficient collection.

It is possible that earlier settlement on the plain is underrepresented be- cause of aggradational processes as well as erosional forces that often affect smaller or more ephemeral sites. In the following discussion, we assume that sites significantly larger than their neighbors served as economic and/or administrative centers, but it must be acknowledged that site function need not corre- late with site size.8'Additionally, the possible pres- ence and significance of non-nucleated sites or nomadic pastoralist groups undetected by the sur- vey should be borne in mind. Five Ceramic Neolithic period sites were identi- fied (ca. 6000-5500 B.C.), characterized by Dark- Faced Burnished Ware and other materials com- parable to Amuq A-B.82Three Halaf sites (ca. 5500-5000 B.C.)83 and as many as six Ubaid sites (ca. 5000-4000 B.C.)84 were noted. In these early periods, settlement was primarily concentrated along the Nahr edh-Dhahab on the western edge of the survey region (fig. 18). The tall medium- sized mounds (ca. 5-10 ha, ca. 25-35 m high) of Tell Saba'in (site 57) and Tell Shirba (site 76) in this zone manifested relatively continuous evidence of occupation for most periods investigated in the survey. Abou Danne, just to the west of our survey region, also belongs in this category of medium- sized mounds with long occupation sequences. Other tells from the Ceramic Neolithic, Halaf, and Ubaid periods were small, measuring 2 ha at most, although the Ubaid occupation at Judeideh (site 81 Schwartz and Falconer 1994, 1-9. 82Braidwood and Braidwood 1960,46-99. The pottery is also comparable to examples from Tell el-Kerkh in the Rouj valley west of Idlib in western Syria (Tsuneki et al. 1997, 1-40). The assemblage includes Dark-Faced Burnished Ware hole-mouthed pots, collaredjars, and bowls, aswell as Dark-Faced Unburished Ware and Coarse Simple Ware. Collared and uncollared vessels generally have simple rounded rims, but there are some attes- tations of a plastic band below the rim. Decoration consists of pattern-burnish cross-hatching, incised lines (vertical and di- agonal), and fingernail impressions. 83The Halaf sites may not be contemporaneous: the paint- ed ceramics of site 42 are similar to those of Balikh phase IIIC (e.g., low-necked jars with pendant stripes on the interior of the rim), while the Halaf component at Tell Shirba (site 76) compares to the later Balikh phase IIID (e.g. Trichterrandbech- er rims and angular neckjars with squared-off rims). Cf. Akker- mans 1993,68-79,92-109,134-7; LeMiereandNieuwenhuyse 1996, 119-284. 84Ubaid ceramics included painted and unpainted mineral- tempered hemispherical plain-rim bowls, bead-rim bowls, and hole-mouth and collared-rim pots. General parallels for the wares and decorative schemes are attested at Hammam et-Turkman 66) may have occupied as much as 4 ha. An increase in settlement (13 sites) is notable in the Late Chalcolithic era (late fifth-fourth millenni- um B.C.), with communities distributed more even- ly over the entire region (fig. 18). Most sites were 1 ha or less, with the exception of Judeideh (site 66) and Tell Shirba (site 76) on the Nahr edh-Dhahab and Mahdum (site 101) in the east, the latter with significant later occupation probably responsible for the majority of the site's 5 ha. Typical Late Chalcolith- ic ceramics included jars with flaring necks and simple rim bowls in crude chaff-tempered ware com- parable to that of Amuq F (fig. 19.1-10).85 No evi- dence of southern Mesopotamian-style Uruk pottery was found, facilitating the important conclusion that the Euphrates was the westernmost limit of the Uruk colonial "expansion" from southern Mesopotamia,86 with the apparent exception of beveled rim bowls found at isolated large sites like Hama and Judei- deh (Amuq plain). This finding complements the results obtained by the Qoueiq survey to the west, which also failed to detect any evidence of southern Mesopotamian Uruk material culture.87 The absence of southern Mesopotamian Uruk materials in the Jabbul region also suggests that salt procurement at theJabbul lake was not central to the economy of the Habuba Kabira colonial enclave in the Euphrates valley to the east, contrary to G. Buccellati's hypothe- sis.88 In the succeeding early third millennium pe- riod (=Early EB), only five sites with Amuq G style pottery, such as reserved-slip jars or sinuous-sided bowls (fig. 19.11-18), were noted, distributed over a broad area extending from the Nahr edh-Dhahab to the eastern fringe of the surveyed zone.89 IV, Tell 'Abr levels 7-2, and Amuq E.

Mid-Late EB site distribution, Jabbul 1996 survey by the establishment of Umm el-Marra (site 31) as a large, possibly enclosed regional center in the east- ern part of the Jabbul. Umm el-Marra, ca. 25 ha., is larger by far in terms of area than any other site in the survey region but is modest in size compared to the best-known cities of Syria's early urban period, such as Ebla, Mari, and Leilan. Secondary centers of 5 ha or more can be hypothesized at Tell Shirba (site 76) and Saba'in (site 57) along the Nahr edh- Dhahab and at Mahdum (site 101) in the east, as well as at eight communities of 2-3 ha distributed evenly across the landscape, but the majority of set- tlements were small village-sized communities of 1 ha or less. The large number of sites in the eastern part of the region, beyond the present-day dry-farm- ing limit of 250 mm annual rainfall, may indicate relatively moist conditions in the mid-third millen- nium or a policy of agricultural maximization asso- ciated with the early urban societies of the period. Our preliminary results imply a degree of aban- donment in the early second millennium B.C. os- tensibly associated with the urban collapse hypothesized for the end of EB. Some 25 EB sites were deserted, primarily along the Nahr Deir Ha- fer and in the drier eastern zones. Sherds of MB I date (ca. 2000-1800 B.C.) were only recognized at four sites, although the latter figure is almost cer- 91 For MB and LB, the pottery types represented in the Umm el-Marra III-II sequence were used as the primary chronolog- ical diagnostics. Cf. Curvers and Schwartz 1997; Schwartz and tainly too low. A total of 33 MB sites were identified (fig. 21);91 when subperiods could be identified, MB II was by far the better attested of the two. Despite such indications of occupational gaps, 22 of the 33 MB communities were founded atop EB tells. In MB II (ca. 1800-1600 B.C.), the Jabbul was under the sovereignty of the Amorite-ruled kingdom of Yam- had centered in Aleppo. Umm el-Marra remained the largest settlement in the survey region and may have served as the capital of a Yamhad vassal king- dom, although the Nahr Deir Hafer showed curi- ously little evidence of additional settlement. Given the pronounced decrease in the number of sites in the drier regions east of Umm el-Marra, the site's position on the eastern fringes of the settled zone in this period may imply that it functioned as a "gateway city" controlling access between the steppe and agri- cultural zones. These data complement the evidence of the MB II intensified exploitation of the steppe observed by Weber in the Umm el-Marra faunal data (see "An MB Steppe Economy: Specialized Onager Hunting," under "Animal Exploitation," above). The Late Bronze Age (ca. 1600-1200 B.C.) sees a considerable reduction in the number of sites (11 sites; fig. 21), a common pattern for LB Syria perhaps associated with increasing nomadic pasto- ralism.92 Northern Syria was a common arena for Curvers under "Architecture, Stratigraphy, and Pottery" above. 92Wilkinson 1998, 1-23; Curvers 1991.

MB and LB site distribution, Jabbul 1996 survey struggles between the "great powers" of the day, such as Mitanni, Egypt, Hatti, and Assyria, a circumstance that may also be relevant to the decline in nucleat- ed settlement.93 Umm el-Marra was still extensively occupied in LB and presumably continued to serve as a regional center, while the dry steppe to the east remained nearly devoid of sedentary occupation. Settlement rebounded during the Iron Age (ca. 1200-300 B.C.), with a total of 34 sites identified (figs. 22-23). The upsurge in settlement after the LB decline is characteristic of regional patterns throughout Syria in the Iron Age.94 What remains to be clarified in our region is the degree to which this process can be associated with the Neo-Assyrian im- perial period, with its state-sponsored population displacements and resettlements, or with the pre- ceding phase of Aramaean and Luwian dynasts. As in other areas, the traditional Bronze Age center, Umm el-Marra, is abandoned, but no new large cen- ter takes its place. It is likely that the region came 93 For textual references to the effects of such insecurities at Emar on the Euphrates, just east of our survey region, cf.

Among the Iron Age diagnostics were bowls with club- or hammer-headed rims (fig. 23.1-7), occasion- al red-slip bowl and fruit-stand sherds, large storage jars with rope applique (fig. 23.11), and other types documented in the equences from Abou Danne, Tell Afis, Hama, and elsewhere.96 In sharp contrast to the relatively dense Iron Age settlement of the Jabbul is the scarcity of contemporaneous habitation in the Euphrates valley to the east.97 An increase in the number of sites in the survey region is visible in the Hellenistic (49 sites) and Roman (60 sites) periods (fig. 24).9 Characteristic enth-sixth-century B.C. assemblages rather than earlier Iron Age corpora.

Some of the brittle ware cooking pots can also be assigned to the Roman period on the basis of parallels with other Syr- ian sites." The majority of the Hellenistic and Roman sites fall within a 0.25-5 ha range, although Umm el- Marra reappeared as a large town of as much as 15-20 ha in the Hellenistic period. In the Roman era, Umm el-Marra was apparently much reduced from its Hel- lenistic extent, and theJabbul provides an ample man- ifestation of the Roman Near East as "a world of villages."100 Since the Euphrates served as the border between the Roman and Parthian empires until the Because of the preliminary nature of our data analysis, we have notyet been able to isolate Persian period remains from earlier Iron Age materials. 9Early brittle ware shapes have been found in excavated contexts at Palmyra and Dibsi Faraj (Bylinski 1995, 213-46; Harper 1980, 334-8, fig. C). Hellenistic and Roman material collected by the 1996 survey was also compared to excavated Umm el-Marra Ia-b material and to published data from Abou Dann6 (Curvers and Schwartz 1997; Tefnin 1980a, 179-201; 1980b, 1-57). 00 Kennedy 1999, 98. 11 Isaac 1990, 15. 102Jones 1971, 460. Late Roman C bowls, African red slip, and brittle ware cooking pots and casseroles were among the Late Antique types identified. For fine wares, see fig. 26.1-9; conquest of northern Mesopotamia by Septimius Severus, the survey area can be construed as a frontier zone in the earlier Roman period.101 In Byzantine times, historical sources indicate that the site of Jabbul, ancient Gabbula (site 68), was the seat of a bishopric, and our survey data reveal that the Late Antique/Byzantine period was a prosperous era for the region (53 sites; figs. 25- 26).102 In addition to the sites distributed across the plain, an occupation was established on a small island in the Jabbul lake at Tell Wasta (site 144), perhaps associated with a limestone quarry and with salt procurement.103In this and the succeed- ing Early Islamic period (52 sites),104 the dry steppe in the eastern part of the survey area was for brittle wares, see fig. 26.10-15. Common Late Roman C shapes were types Hayes 3 and 10 (cf.

Curiously, such large sites are primarily attested in the eastern steppe region. Small sites of 1 ha or less were also common and often appeared to consist of little more than a single house mound. A similar profusion of individual farmsteads or estates was noted in the Tabqa survey area of the Euphrates valley to the east.?08 Architectural elements were not infrequently found out of context in Late Antique sites, often reused as modern grave markers, including basalt column bases and column shafts, basalt door lin- tels, and limestone basins, sometimes carved in low relief.

Hellenistic and Roman site distribution,Jabbul 1996 survey Nahr edh-Dhahab in the sixth and fifth millen- nia B.C., a broader distribution in the fourth and early third millennium, and a dramatic increase in settlement in the mid-third millennium, ac- companied by the appearance of Umm el-Marra as a large regional center. In this and succeeding periods, the scale of urbanization in the survey region is relatively understated. In the Bronze Age, Umm el-Marra is the only site larger than 10 ha on a plain otherwise characterized by small villages, although secondary centers on the Nahr edh-Dhahab and elsewhere can be hypothesized. It is likely that the area was frequently part of larg- er regional systems whose most important cen- ters (e.g., Aleppo) were located outside the survey zone. The Jabbul's significance was most proba- bly linked to its strategic location along the east- west route from Aleppo to Mesopotamia. In this context, the role of Umm el-Marra might be un- derstood both as a regional center subservient to Aleppo and a frontier town monitoring and con- trolling access between steppe and sedentary zones, and between the Euphrates valley and the route west. The presumed importance of the Jab- bul lake as a source of salt, attested from medi- eval and later sources, is uncertain for earlier periods, although occasional sites are located along its north shores and the tell of Jabbul itself (site 68), historically associated with salt collec- tion, was occupied from at least EB times. CONCLUSIONS From excavation, ecofactual analysis, and survey- our main research foci-we have been able to ac- quire new data and pose new questions on various aspects of preurban and early complex societies in theJabbul region of western Syria. In particular, the alternating cycles of political and economic inte- gration and decentralization can be investigated, although much more research will be necessary in order to acquire a more substantial understanding of these phenomena. From at least the Ceramic Neolithic period, the Jabbul plain had attracted sedentary populations exploiting the dry farming capacities of the local environment. Settlement began in the rainier, west- ern part of the plain along the Nahr edh-Dhahab and expanded eastward by the fourth millennium B.C. In the mid-late EB, the evidence from the Jab- bul duplicates that of other parts of Syro-Mesopota- mia in the appearance of a relatively dense region- al settlement pattern dominated by a large center (Umm el-Marra) and its subsidiaries. With the foun- dation of Umm el-Marra and the extensive settle- ment of the plain, we see a relatively abrupt and simultaneous growth of both urban and rural com- 2000] 455</page><page sequence="38">GLENN M. SCHWARTZ ET AL. Fig. 25. Late Antique site distribution,Jabbul 1996 survey munities. Occupation of the drier eastern steppe regions implies strategies of agricultural maximiza- tion, perhaps with the encouragement or spon- sorship of central authorities. Agricultural intensi- fication is also implied by the trend toward deforestation manifested by the archaeobotanical data. This period marks the apogee of settlement in the plain until the Hellenistic period. Considering the issue of "collapse" in late EB and MB I, the decentralization observed elsewhere is apparent in the Jabbul region in the abandon- ment of numerous settlements as well as the deser- tion of parts of Umm el-Marra. Despite these changes, the ecofactual data do not suggest any clear disruption in economic strategies at Umm el- Marra from EB to MB I. Rather, MB I data exhibit continuity with the trends of the EB: third-millen- nium animal and plant exploitation patterns con- tinue, as does deforestation. Specialized pottery production also remains in force, with wheelmade, mass-produced vessels predominating, albeit in new styles. These preliminary conclusions may sug- gest that economic institutions or ideologies from the urbanized EB period survived into the MB I era of decentralization, along the lines of the models '09Wattenmaker 1994, 193-208; Graffam 1992, 882-904; Schwartz 1994, 153-74. advanced by P. Wattenmaker, G. Graffam, and Schwartz .109 In MB II the period of urban and state regen- eration, Umm el-Marra is refortified and inten- sively reoccupied, and its animal economy shifts to a focus on onager hunting. An emphasis on the exploitation of wild animal species is surpris- ing in a "second generation" complex society, given expectations of increasingly specialized pastoral economies.'10 The role of the Jabbul with- in the powerful Yamhad kingdom remains to be explored more fully. In LB, a period of imperial contentions over northern Syria, the economy at Umm el-Marra shows signs of localization and self-sufficiency, with the abandonment of large-scale onager exploitation. The architecture of the site is concurrently small- scale and domestic in character, with little evidence of central authority or communal fortification. This trend toward localization, along with the reduction of settlement in the plain, may indicate increasing pastoral nomadism as well as the depredations of external powers like Mitanni, Egypt, Hatti, and As- syria conflicting in the region and exacting tribu- tary requirements. 110 Zeder 1998, 55-67. 456 [AJA 104</page><page sequence="39">EXCAVATION AND SURVEY IN THE JABBUL PLAIN 44&lt; I \'1 * 1 7 93 ----v~~~ I - J5 6 / 8 a.' ) /9 J K 10 7. - N13 4, I ' ll Fig. 26.

We have hypothesized that Umm el-Marra con- sistently served as a Bronze Age regional center and as a frontier community mediating between the steppe and sedentary zones.l"Although the site's large-scale fortifications in the EB and MB II periods imply urban pretensions, the absence (thus far) of palaces or temples as well as the rela- tive scarcity of elite artifacts might suggest a com- munity emulating urban styles but without a large elite component. In subsequent periods from Iron Age to Early Is- lamic, the cyclical trend of retraction and expansion of settlement shifts to a pattern of continuous exten- sive occupation. Perhaps the inclusion of the survey region within vast imperial polities contributed to a stable sedentary population. Even the struggles be- tween the Parthians/Persians and the Romans/Byz- antines failed to result in a significant reduction in the number of settlements in the Jabbul, despite its "' For examples of frontier communities in recent Syrian history, see the remarks on Sefire nearAleppo and Dmeir near location at the frontiers of both worlds. While the utilization of the steppe's resources is common throughout the periods under consider- ation, there is surprisingly little evidence for the exploitation ofJabbul Lake, contrary to expectations of its economic importance as a source of salt. The botanical and faunal analyses both fail to reveal plant or animal species associated with marshy or saline environments, raising questions of cultural or polit- ical restrictions to the lake environment-or to the very existence of the lake in the Bronze Age. In almost all cases, more data are required to eval- uate and refine the above interpretations. Our con- clusions on EB and MB I occupation at Umm el-Marra, in particular, are based on small samples that require significant expansion. In future we hope to intensify investigation of the EB to MB tran- sition and the important but rarely examined prob- lem of urban and state regeneration.
