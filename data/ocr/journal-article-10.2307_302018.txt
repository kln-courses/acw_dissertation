<plain_text><page sequence="1">Surfiction: Plunging into the Surface* Doris L. Eder What is surfiction? Raymond Federman has chosen the word by analogy with surrealism; like surrealism, surfiction goes beyond realism. It is, says Federman, "the kind of fiction that constantly renews our faith in man's imagination and not in man's distorted vision of reality - that reveals man's irrationality rather than man's rationality" (p. 7). Unlike surrealism, surfiction does not necessarily mine below the surface; it may rise above it, but more frequently it remains on it. It is often called metafiction, fiction about fiction-making, which proclaims and rejoices in its own fictiveness. It no longer attempts to represent or to recreate reality, for reality itself is a fiction. Surfiction is thus anti-realist. It arrogates to itself a certain autonomy by abjuring mimesis; when fiction no longer attempts to represent life, it begins to exist for its own sake, not as mirror or allegory. In an age of mass journalism and of still and motion photography, the writer's aim cannot be to reproduce the world. In any *Raymond Federman, ed. Surfiction: Fiction Now ... and Tomorrow. Chicago: The Swallow Press, 1975. 153</page><page sequence="2">case, writers with a truly contemporary sense of reality find their consciousness has passed beyond, has exhausted, and is betrayed by tra- ditional realism. John Barth has declared there is no point in a writer's ad- justing his woofers and tweeters for higher and higher fi to a realism that is no longer authentic. Ronald Sukenick, in his anti-novella, "The Death of the Novel," writes: Realistic fiction presupposed chronological time as the medium of a plotted narrative, an irreducible individual psyche as the subject of its characterization, and . . . the ultimate, concrete reality of things as the object and rationale of its description. In the world of post-realism ... all of these absolutes have become absolutely problematic . . . Reality doesn't exist. God was the omniscient author, but he died; now no one knows the plot, and since our reality lacks the sanction of a creator, there's no guarantee as to the authenticity of the received version .... Reality is, simply, our experience.... .1 Since we all know that life has imitated art, as well as art life, traditional fiction - even some belonging to the period we now call modern and acknowledge to be over - not only falsifies our experience on paper but in life too. Conventional realism has in some ways obstructed our vision of reality, even usurped it. William Spanos has argued against such "anthropomorphic objectification"2 and for fiction that feelingly recreates the contingency and chaos of life. What a revolution in consciousness might be wrought by our ceasing habitually to regard ourselves as characters in novels! There is a definite need for the kind of book Raymond Federman has put together in Surfiction. Several of its best essays are reprinted, several are very awkwardly translated, and one can think of excellent articles on the subject of postmodern fiction that might have been included. Nevertheless, some of the pieces are exciting, most are thought-provoking, and the collection as a whole should inspire other writers, critics, and editors to similar, perhaps better ventures. Of the diverse essays in Surfiction, some are committed to spatial form, while others embrace the temporal-existential form to which boundary 2 appears to be dedicated. What descriptions of and prescriptions for postmodern fiction emerge from Federman's Surfiction? As Marcus Klein notes, in "John Hawkes' Experimental Compositions," many tenets of contemporary fiction are negative reactions to conventional realism (anti-novel, anti-hero, etc.). In Federman's introduction, "Surfiction - Four Propositions in Form of an Introduction," two of his four propositions about postmodern 154</page><page sequence="3">fiction concern the abolition of plot and of character, as usually portrayed. Sukenick, in his essay, "The New Tradition in Fiction," defines postmodern fiction by means of a whole string of negatives: it "has no plot, no story, no character, no chronological sequence, no verisimilitude, no imitation, no allegory, no symbolism, no subject matter, no 'meaning' " (p. 43). This definition is too sweeping; Sukenick's own fiction has not dispensed with chronological sequence, verisimilitude, and imitation, for instance. But it is worth examining these assertions point by point and considering what Federman's collection of essays has to say about them, beginning with abolition of plot. Dispensing with plot or story is in part a response to exhaustion or disillusionment with these elements. As Barth eloquently points out in "The Literature of Exhaustion," it seems at this late date as though all the stories have been told. In the last quarter of the twentieth century, all the writer can do is skillfully allude, play self-consciously with new permutations and combinations, place old plots in new contexts or view them from new angles and perspectives, and, above all, parody what has already been done. But disillusionment with plot or story is perhaps more widespread then exhaustion or the sense of ddjc lu. ("La chair est triste, hilas! et j'ai lu tous les les livres.") It derives from all the frustrations felt with a linear medium in the Space Age. These have been catalogued by Marshall McLuhan. Such media as radio, television, and movies are felt to capture better the simultaneity of consciousness in the Global Village than linear, temporal narrative, moving from beginning through middle to end. Sharon Spencer, in Space, Time and Structure in the Modern Novel, defines what she calls the "architectonic novel," which abandons temporal for spatial form based, like modern poetry, on the principle of juxtaposition or cinematic montage.3 Spencer shows how the visual and plastic arts, particularly Cubism at the turn of the century, have influenced literature. This influence has been reinforced by that of science, specifically Einstein's theory of the relativity of space/time, that of cinematography and the electronic media, and that of psychology and the fascination with dreams. Literature's excursions into oneirism, cinematic techniques, viewing subjects from multiple or moving perspectives, and sci-fi have all tended to liberate it from chronological sequence; time and space are treated discontinuously or they are fused. Thus, Federman calls for the substitution of chaotic, digressive fiction for conventional well-made plots; Sukenick says postmodern fiction is necessarily abstract, opaque, and improvisational. Certainly, modern art became abstract in reaction to the feeling that the ne plus ultra of realism had been achieved. But there is a deeper, more interesting reason for this call to abstraction in the arts. As Worringer pointed out in Abstraction and Empathy (1908), the arts tend to become abstract whenever man does not feel at home in the world. Abstraction is a defense against reality. The abstractness of modern art, however, coexists with concreteness; it is not nebulous, misty, 155</page><page sequence="4">or vague, but hard, sharp, sometimes mathematically or geometrically particularized. The novels of Beckett and Joyce, for example, may be seen as based on principles of doubling or triads; some postmodern fiction shapes itself around geometrical motifs - consider Pynchon's V. Opacity is linked to abstraction. Why has character as we used to know it disappeared from postmodern literature? In general, because there has been a crisis of confidence in character. The self is no longer considered either potent or integral. Character has become attenuated because authors are less interested in it for its own sake than they are in character as perspective, persona, or voice expressive of the author's Weltanschauung. In modern literature, people merge into setting or theme, becoming ventriloquial puppets or masks of the author. This tendency was anticipated in modern poetry. Eliot's notes to The Waste Land inform us that Tiresias, though only a spectator, not a character, is yet "the most important personage in the poem, uniting all the rest." A reader confronting this statement for the first time might be excused for responding like Pynchon's Benny Profane, "Wha?" Further, the dehumanization of art noted by Ortega y Gasset is a reflection of the dehumanization of life. Mass industrialized society has shown us how easy it is to regard people as objects to be manipulated. Jean Ricardou's Surfiction essay, "Nouveau Roman, Tel Quel," has most to say about what has happened to character in postmodern fiction. New fiction leaves psychoanalysis of the individual to psychologists and the study of group behavior to sociologists. Most contemporary writers mistrust psychoanalysis and no longer believe in the integrity of the self. The self is either shattered into myriad fragments or reduced to a minimal, irreducible, impersonal core. The first strategy is exemplified by such writers as Hesse, Pirandello, Pinget, Barth, and Nabokov; the second by, among others, Beckett and Kosinski. Consider what fun Barth has with the notion of the integral self, playing off in novel after novel a personality who considers his self as stable against another whose nature is so protean, shifting, and multifaceted that he doubts whether he can be said to possess a self at all. In Barth the two alternatives are frenetic role-playing (mythotherapy) or inertia, a sinking back into that immobile, impersonal void Virginia Woolf images in To the Lighthouse as "a wedge-shaped core of darkness." Ricardou, in a brief but penetrating discussion of Robbe-Grillet's La Maison de rendez-vous, shows how the dissolution of self and the multiplication of roles are complementary strategies in postmodern fiction. Multiple identity often turns out to be nonentity. The assault on character comprises two phases: the dissociation of an individual into incompatible fragments; the distribution of the pieces according to completely new units. As is the case in the phenomenon 156</page><page sequence="5">of animal mimicry, where disruptive spots disperse the specimen into new figures by analogy with the variety of the environment, so here the problem is to dissolve a unity, then to amalgamate the various parts. (p. 103) The fission of personality is followed by a fusion, whereby a single name serves as the umbrella for a diversity of roles, or a diversity of names is attached to a single role. Thus, in Robbe-Grillet's fiction, remarks Ricardou, "the reader's thirst for identification is constantly frustrated . . . as no one is ever exactly himself, everyone is always more or less everybody else" (p. 106). Ricardou notes several other trends in contemporary fiction. Characters who have ceased to be "wellrounded" become mere apparitions and can be mass-produced. Thus we have fiction like Pinget's with casts in the hundreds or Pynchon's with casts of over a thousand, as in Gravity's Rainbow. Ultimately, names, in the fiction of the movement called Tel Quel, give way to nouns and pronouns. Again, people become objects. One of the distinguishing characteristics of chosisme is that things seem more alive than people. No reader of contemporary fiction or poetry can fail to notice how often the animate is de-animated and the inanimate animated. Confusion of life and death is characteristic of decadence. In his comparison of two Nouveau Romanistes with two Tel Quelistes - Robbe-Grillet and Pinget with Jean-Louis Baudry and Philippe Sollers - Ricardou concludes that, while both movements produce fiction that is intensely self-reflexive and full of internal mirroring, the Nouveau Roman is much less radical than Tel Quel: "The former subverts . . . character, the latter abolishes it. The former tends to formalize its fiction, the latter, with more violence, its narration. The former turns the process of representation against itself, the latter nullifies it" (p. 133). Both movements exhibit postmodernism's dislike of dualism. Ricardou echoes Federman's opening salvo: "All forms of duality will be negated" (p. 8). The form/content duality is not the only one metafiction negates. As Beckett remarked of Finnegans Wake, "Here form is content, content is form. . . . [Joyce's] writing is not about something; it is that something itself." In ceasing to be Stendhal's mirror dragged along the roadway, the novel no longer confronts the life/art dichotomy. Writers are released from the duty of representing life; henceforth fiction is autonomous. Formerly, the writer had the choice of representing the world (realism) or the self (expressionism). These fictional poles were but mirror images of each other. Surfiction is concerned with the interaction of self and world in a fictional force-field in which these become indistinguishable. Finally, surfiction strives to overcome the separation of writer from reader. Several essays in Federman's collection view artist and audience as engaged in a transaction in which both are active partners inextricably interdependent. 157</page><page sequence="6">Richard Pearce's essay, "Enter the Frame," provides a useful, brief history of what has happened to narrative point of view since the turn of the century. Pearce examines its evolution in fiction by James, Conrad, Faulkner, and Beckett. James and Conrad shunned the sham of omniscience, realizing there is no such thing, that reality is not absolute and does not, as Ortega y Gasset expresses it, possess "independently of the point of view from which it is observed, a physiognomy of its own."4 The Jamesian central intelligence and the Conradian spectrum of subjective impressions of a single figure or event, filtered through an "objective" narrator (Marlow), are both examples of carefully chosen fixed viewpoints, however seemingly fluid and mobile, and of frames ultimately capable of insuring clarity and objectivity. (Pearce distinguishes between ambiguity and vagueness. Both James and Conrad are ambiguous; Conrad is vaguer than James.) In fact, James in The Turn of the Screw and Conrad in Heart of Darkness and Lord Jim provide frames within frames, which have the effect of commenting on and correcting one another. An important difference between the two writers is that for Conrad, unlike James, the meaning of a story lies not within the story, like the kernel in a nut, but outside - in the different meanings perceived in it by many outside observers. Hence meaning in James is bound to be clearer than in Conrad, for James usually invests meaning in the viewpoint of a central intelligence within the fiction. From a consideration of Heart of Darkness, which Pearce calls transitional between modern fiction and surfiction, he goes on to examine Faulkner's Absalom, Absalom!, which does not, like The Turn of the Screw, contain a series of frames nested within one another like Chinese boxes, but instead "four partially overlapping and constantly shifting frames attempting to enclose a subject that is not there" (p. 54). Pearce argues that the subject of Faulkner's novel is beyond the apprehension of its storytellers and of its readers. As in Beckett's trilogy (Molloy, Malone Dies, The Unnamable), in Faulkner interest has shifted from the story to the manner of telling it; in Faulkner these are still distinguishable to some degree, whereas in Beckett they have become indistinguishable. Pearce calls Absalom, Absalom! and Beckett's trilogy surfiction because surfiction no longer interposes a single identifiable narrator between author and subject or between subject and reader. Instead the author-narrator or narrator-character "enters the frame," thus making it impossible to separate what is narrated from who narrates it and how. The modernists' complex mastery of controlled, delimited points of view gives way to the surfictionists' liberated, freemoving and shifting, overlapping perspectives and frames. In his introduction, Federman's first proposition calls for new freedom of format and typography in surfiction. Fiction should no longer be forced into the straitjacket of bound pages of solid type to be read from top left to bottom right of the page. Federman would also like to revolutionize syntax, again in the cause of enabling readers to find new, 158</page><page sequence="7">multiple, simultaneous ways of reading books. The medium is the message. Curiously, Federman says language is neither audible nor visible, but he believes the medium, the printed word, can be enhanced by making it more visual or more audible. Surfiction cites novels-in-boxes, printed on pages to be shuffled and rearranged in whatever order the reader pleases (Saporta); novels which may be read forwards or backwards (Cortazar's Hopscotch); fiction liberally interspersed with concrete or found poetry and graphics like comicstrips (Handke); fiction based on mathematical formulae or spatial motifs (in Sukenick's Out, for instance, numbers of lines and lines of space vary inversely until language vanishes into space); and fiction based on or adorned with rebuses, puns, and metagrams (Baudry; Roussel). Such manifestations are a response to dissatisfaction with the linearity and temporality of fiction. In a multi-media age, the book strives to liberate itself from its old, constrictive format and incorporate features of other media. Fiction has become non- or cross-genetic, if not multi-media. As Sharon Spencer observes in Space, Time and Structure in the Modern Novel: Technologically considered, the book reflects in its structure the sequential chronology of the past. Its numbered pages are held fast in a binding, and they clearly designate a movement from the past toward the future .... Does not such a structure naturally frustrate the desires of a novelist who wishes to shatter linear organization into quick, vivid, simultaneous instants of experience, related one to the other by their content, not by the order in which they took place? . .. One must ask whether the book is capable of expressing the fusion of space and time, which endows both with meaning; and one must bear in mind the attendant proposition that nothing can be seen fully that is not seen either from a moving point of reference or from a great many perspectives simultaneously .... 5 A reader wishing to examine a fiction employing visual techniques which dispose of words as though they were images might look at Federman's Double or Nothing.6 In this "real fictitious discourse," as the author calls it, a first person records how a second person holes up for a year to write the story of a third person. Later, a fourth person is postulated, a sort of camera eye who oversees the other three. All four persons or personae are fragments of the author. One notices that, in abolishing the distinction between life and art, surfiction overrides that between autobiography and fiction. Hence, much of this new fiction - Sukenick's is a good example - is autobiographical, but in a peculiar way. It is authorial stream-of-consciousness or stream-of-action, but deliberately 159</page><page sequence="8">kept flat and on the surface. And one cannot be sure when factual glides off into imaginary reportage. Life and fiction bleed together. In Federman's Double or Nothing, the third person, Boris, is himself when a young immigrant in the United States. The second person, the writer, is Federman some twenty-five years later, planning to write the story of his younger self. This second person has to be distinguished from the first, the recorder, because Double or Nothing is much more about the writing of Boris' story than it is about the story itself. Words are scattered in different visual arrangements over two hundred pages; scarcely two pages look alike. (The novel has been typed and then photo-offset.) In Surfiction, Federman says the old consecutive method of writing and reading is boring, but aside from the interesting notion on which Double or Nothing is based, it is hard to conceive of anything more boring than its cute typographical antics. Does this fiction convey "quick, vivid, simultaneous instants of experience?" No. Instead, we are given a sense of the tedium of writing - and of reading - which no amount of visual gymnastics can relieve. While keeping an open mind on the subject, one should always ask if current visual or multi-media techniques in fiction are integral to the text or mere distraction and frippery. How often are graphics an excuse for the absence of any real talent with words? The essays in Federman's collection which insist on new formats for fiction are the least persuasive. Highfalutin theory may degenerate into a mask for mere whim or slobbery when authors really know neither the reasons for nor the effects of disrupting texts with mathematical formulae, visual objects, and typographical games. Examination of typographically limber fiction like Federman's and Sukenick's raises doubts. Who is going to bother to read a page of mirror-type printed backwards from lower right to upper left corner of the page? Should not prose which incorporates poetry be as choosy about its line-endings as free verse? What is the point of splitting up words as follows: together they try to mak e it work eventhough it is a senseless hopeless situatio n? (This is taken from Double or Nothing, p. 71 - a typical page, chosen at random.) The retort that there is no point only exacerbates a reader's irritation. When all is said and done, language is linear and temporal, as William Spanos keeps insisting in his essays; at what point does victory over linearity and temporality become pyrrhic? Again, playing with syntax is fine if it has a point, but sense easily become nonsense and, while some nonsense is funny, enlightening, even edifying (Barthelme's for instance), 160</page><page sequence="9">in quantity there is nothing more stultifying. Also one questions whether linear print and the solid block of the printed page is really an impediment to simultaneous, polysemous meaning. What Forster in Aspects of the Novel calls the lowest common denominator of fiction, story, that "naked worm of time," can, as he shows, be overcome by anticipation and memory and shaped into something radiant with significance and value by the brooding imagination and intelligence of writer and reader. Anyone who teaches or studies modern literature knows how complex, many-layered, and spatial it is. Without resort to typographical juggling, techniques of allusion, juxtaposition, discontinuity, ellipsis, leitmotiv, and incremental repetition work against strictly temporal reading. It may be argued that no one really understands, say, Heart of Darkness, The Waste Land, A Passage to India, To the Lighthouse, or The Sound and the Fury until those works exist as single, complex images in his head. And surfiction, it should be added, though anti-realist, is not necessarily anti-formalist. Much of it is still strongly influenced by modernism's predilection for spatial, poetic, often static form. However, Sharon Spencer distinguishes between closed and open forms in modern and postmodern fiction, as Spanos has discerned two streams of postmodern literature - one descending from Symbolism, the other from existentialism. Albert Guerard has rightly pointed out that contemporary writers neglect memory in order to court presentness, existential encounters with people and objects now.7 Surfiction proclaims itself an art of the surface which denies the surface/depth dualism, among so many others. Robbe-Grillet insists surfaces are no longer masks - appearances are all we have; they do not conceal some hidden reality. According to Robbe-Grillet, we should shun heights and depths and live among surfaces because interiority leads always to transcendence and transcendence is a lie. One questions this, asking whether literature should give up the particular strengths inherent to the medium. As Sukenick observes in "The New Tradition in Fiction," "There is some indefinable line beyond which the art you are working in becomes some other art, or no art at all" (p. 39). While movies can express presentness with much more impact than fiction, they can in no way emulate fiction's capacity to penetrate surfaces (pace Robbe-Grillet), to render the feeling behind expression. Nothing can probe so deeply or convey so lively and inward a sense of Lebensgefihl as the novel. Perhaps, then, surfiction's emphasis on surface and here- and-nowness is misplaced, an awkward phase fiction will grow out of. The last and most troublesome of Federman's proposals for surfiction is that new fiction need mean nothing. It will be deliberately incoherent. "The new fiction will not create a semblance of order, it will offer itself for . .. ordering" (p. 14). Thus it will call for active reader participation. Writer and reader together may be able to invent, project, or 161</page><page sequence="10">extrapolate a meaning for or from a text, but not necessarily. Federman insists on spontaneous creation; meaning does not pre-exist the act of writing but emerges in that act, or in the act of reading, if at all. This is true to the existentialist creed that existence precedes essence. In "The Detective and the Boundary," Spanos affirms that ends that are pre-existent, implicit from the beginning, should no longer be imposed on fiction. Since life knows no ends, in the sense of either goals or grand finales, the Aristotelian well-made plot is an act of bad faith. Despite their common attack on Aristotle, however, Federman's and Spanos' aims are different. Federman, for all his rebellion against traditional forms in fiction, seems to be an inverted formalist who delights in verbal playfulness for its own sake. Spanos believes literature should reflect and enhance life. He wants to see the modernist commitment to spatial form give way to contingent fictional forms which actively engage us in the chaos and absurdity of existence. Several of the essays in Surfiction raise this question: Must the writer begin writing with a blank mind, so to speak? Is it possible or desirable for him to have no preconception of what he wants to say or of its meaning? Jacques Ehrmann, in an essay in Surfiction portentously entitled "The Death of Literature," conducts the most radical assault on meaning. He asks when and where meaning resides. Using the analogy of film, for example, is meaning prior or subsequent to the projection of images, or is it during projection attached to some particular image or sequence? Ehrmann concludes that it is "an error to look for meaning within movement itself, for movement is only the condition of its possibility" (p. 250). Essentially, meaning never is, but is forever shifting with change and movement in perceiver and perceived. Ehrmann says: The "meaning of history" (and of literature) is therefore only a myth to which we have clung - perhaps out of our weakness and cowardice or of some visceral desire to believe that life has a foundation that could justify it, out of some . . . need to orient ourselves and thereby attempt to protect ourselves from ... madness. (p. 253) Ehrmann announces the end of the cult of the artist, priest-prophet and hero-victim of art as a religion, as the modernists (particularly the Romantics and Symbolists) saw him. For Ehrmann originality, intentionality, and mastery are all passed. Instead he is interested in automatic writing and "found" texts - magpie thieveries of lines taken from novels, plays, poems, newspapers, magazines, advertisements, comics, signs, labels, mathematical equations, then juxtaposed in weird collage and set in a new context to capture the reader's attention. Ehrmann meets head-on the objection that anyone can create such texts, by positively glorying in the prospect of everyman his own artist. Texts these days may 162</page><page sequence="11">be made by anyone and everyone for anyone and everyone. As an example, he invites us to contemplate the telephone book. Barth's "The Literature of Exhaustion," the opening essay in Federman's collection, implies the current literary scene is full of fakers and charlatans. For every true artist (for Barth the word retains validity and virtue), there is an army of faddist camp followers happily splashing around ink, paint, clay, film, tape, etc. Barth declares his own preference for "the kind of art that not many people can do: the kind that requires expertise . . ." (p. 21). I must do the same, and confess to not having outgrown a fascination with spatial form, especially as this seems to reflect the blessed rage for order. Readers will know then from what perspective Federman's book has been examined and may judge according to their own lights. Whether one is a devotee of temporal or of spatial form, however - and the two do not appear rigorously mutually exclusive - there is one question one cannot shirk. If fiction need no longer mean anything, why bother either to write or to read it? Even if one acknowledges existence to be absurd and chaotic, why should postmodern literature, which has abjured mimesis, insist on slavishly imitating life's meaninglessness? Reading has always afforded pleasures life could not: the pleasure of viewing people, events, and situations from all round, and of knowing characters au fond, as one cannot often in life. In other words, literature has been compensatory to life. It is probably true that it became too compensatory, too much a substitute for living, during the modern period. The postmodernist notion of fiction's role as being to teach people how to compose their own reality is an attractive and vital one. Still, what sustenance may be derived from fiction devoid of significance? "Meaning does not pre-exist creation, and afterward it may be superfluous,"8 quips Sukenick. How true of life - but how untrue of any literature worth the name. For some purpose must precede the act of writing, and meaning may outlast the act of reading. Federman's emphasis on spontaneity seems mistaken, perhaps disingenuous. He insists fiction is based on experience that is not anterior to, but simultaneous with, the process of writing. Therefore, "writing fiction will be a process of inventing, on the spot, the material of fiction" (p. 12). Federman's fiction certainly stresses the process of writing - in itself rather a boring process (except to the practitioner), the more so as it lacks ardor, arduousness, or purpose. But shouldn't "the material of fiction" be the experience of a lifetime - vicariously, of many lives and times? Federman is an expert on Beckett, who has told us "there is nothing to express, nothing with which to express, no power to express, no desire to express, together with the obligation to express." What to make of this obligation? Nothing, or the confrontation with the void, has been the obsessive subject of modern literature. And Beckett is right: "Nothing is so real as nothing." But the experience of nothingness or 163</page><page sequence="12">death which underlies existence, and paradoxically gives it such value and meaning as it possesses, must be artistically rendered, significantly shaped. Beckett sees the writer's task today as finding a form to accommodate the mess. On the surface, such plenty; underneath, nothing. In literature, one suspects, -he less you have to say (the less expression means), the more elaborately you have to say it. Consider Joyce's Ithaca. Perhaps meaning diminishes in proportion to the increase in the number of objects over which it is spread, out of which it must be made. The greater the breadth of the vision, the less will be its depth. What is meaning, after all, but the perception of connections? The more people, objects, events, institutions proliferate, the harder - and the more necessary - it is to perceive their interrelatedness. The sheer massiveness and complexity of the material world induces anguish and poverty of spirit, defying the shaping imagination. William Spanos has observed, "The investigator and monstrous proliferation: these are the presences of contemporary life."9 It is still the artist's vocation half to perceive and half to create some order in "the immense panorama of futility and anarchy which is contemporary history." Mere reportage is the province of journalists; even that is very difficult these days. If an author neither apprehends nor creates order, why should his reader try to deduce it? We may ask this same question of the universe. The answer? The world seems a labyrinth, death or nothingness the minotaur, the void at the heart of the plenum. The construction or threading of such a heartless labyrinth may seem pointless, an exercise of skill without object. However chaotic life is, though, it is full of many different orders, and man, a pattern-making and finding animal, must keep seeking and finding meaning in it. This is the project of his being.
