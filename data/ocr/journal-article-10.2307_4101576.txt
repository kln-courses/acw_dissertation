<plain_text><page sequence="1">No Drama Costumes and Other Japanese Costumes in The Art Institute of Chicago MARY V. HAYS and RALPH E. HAYS Los Gatos, California The Japanese costumes in the permanent collection of The Art Institute of Chicago that are presented here range from a sixteenth-century Momoyama period nuihaku, a rare early N6 costume, to an informal outer coat, haori, of the twentieth century. As a group, these costumes comprise one of the finer collections of Japanese garments outside Japan. Each of these costumes will be described following an introduction that is in two parts. First, the aesthetics of Japanese costume is discussed in relation to the origins of the motifs seen in textile patterning and the symbolism inherent in these designs. This is followed by a brief summary of the development of the NC theater with an emphasis on the importance of the costume in the crea- tion of a role. Symbolism and the Japanese Aesthetic Dramatic expression is an integral part of the patterning of Japanese costume. The motifs in the patterning and the colors used create not only a beautiful design or picture but often silently in their symbolism they convey hidden meanings. They may refer to a well-known legend, liter- ary work, or folk tales. The symbols used may create a mood, evoke a season, or express an ideal. Humor is sometimes present in sly allusions to recognizable objects or events. Since the Japanese language is rich in homo- phonic sounds, the pronunciation of a word or character while sounding the same can have more than one mean- ing. Therefore, motifs may be puns. The wordless expression of latent emotions or intel- lectual concepts is rooted in the animism of the ancient beliefs of an agricultural society. After the advent of Buddhism in Japan, in A.D. 538, in order to distinguish the native beliefs from Buddhist doctrine, these earlier beliefs and rituals were called Shinto, the "Way of the Gods," with worship centered on the gods who dwelt in mountains, hills, and rocks; valleys, plains, and rice pad- dies; in water in the form of rain, mist, clouds, lakes, rivers, and waterfalls; and in the seemingly supernatural forces of wind and fire. By the early fifth century, Chinese cultural influences, such as the practical ethics of Confucianism, the Taoist dualism of the Yin and Yang, and the Five Elements of Wood, Earth, Fire, Metal, and Water had begun to affect the social customs and the legends of the Japanese. During the Nara period (710-794), the ancient leg- ends of the gods responsible for the genesis of Japan were compiled in the Kojiki (The Record of Ancient Matters) and in the Nihon Shoki (The Beginning of Japan), also called the Nihongi. The purpose of these chronicles was partly to legitimate the lineage of the Japanese sovereigns, and in so doing they emulated the Chinese dynastic historians.2 In time, certain creatures-animals, birds, and insects-became associated with the gods of these FIGURE I.

Such motifs became a part of the traditional vocabulary of Japanese design. Akihiko Takemura wrote, "Since there are no images for the Japanese gods of Shinto origin, their individuality has been expressed indirectly through the motifs used to identify them."3 Many of these motifs are associated with N6 dramas that are based on Shinto leg- ends and as symbols have become a part of the patterning of NO costumes. They are motifs also used in the pattern- ing of the formal kosode worn by the people. The Chinese influence on Japanese design during the Asuka period (552-7lo) has been succinctly described by Ken Kirihata, Researcher of Weaving and Dyeing, Kyoto National Museum: In Japan karayo (Chinese style) was the dominant style of beauty until the Nara period, 710-793. For example, in the designs of the flowering plants, h6soge and karahana, are flowers no one has ever seen. They are imaginary flowers that bloom in mountains inhabited by immortals, the Pure Land of Buddhism or in the Persian paradise. The people living in the world dominated by karayo loved these flowers as symbols of eternal life.' Although by the Heian period (794-1192) the life of the court society and the intellectuals was firmly grounded in Buddhist doctrine and the principles of Confucianism, the leisure and prosperity provided by a period of prolonged peace permitted the development of a distinctly Japanese aesthetic. There was a turning away from artistic inspiration derived from things unseen or not native to Japan and a reawakening of the innate Japanese sensibility to the beauty of their own natural surroundings and the animism that had been retained from their early beliefs. Mr. Kirihata points out that by the middle of the Heian period the preference of the courtiers was for this Japanese style of beauty, way6. He illustrates this by a quotation from "The Broom-like Tree" chapter of Lady Murasaki's Heian novel, The Tale of Genji,5 in which the effect on the viewer of the two styles of painting popular in that period are contrasted. The Chinese style that uses vivid, fanciful images of unknown or unreal subjects is startling to the viewer because they are "neither real nor true." Ordinary sce- nery sketched "almost to rival Nature.. .carries the spec- tator in imagination to something beyond them." This is the Japanese style of beauty to be found in familiar things realistically drawn and easily recognizable. It is prefer- red because these universally recognizable objects of Japanese origin express something beyond their explicit delineation that can deeply stir the innermost psyche. This preference underlines the romantic nature of the Japanese people who throughout history, even in the modern industrial age, continue to delight and find meaning in the natural beauty of their homeland. The common people have always embraced the beliefs of Shintoism and the romantic symbolism of beautiful things, whether of nature or created by man, which has its roots in the original Shinto beliefs in the anthropomor- phic powers assigned to natural phenomena. The pattern- ing of the N6 costumes and the other kosode in the current exhibition, most of which date from the Edo period (1603-1868), is based on a distinctly Japanese idea of beauty and the drama that may be hidden in the com- position of the design. Objects that recall various aspects of Heian culture and scenes illustrating episodes of the literature of the period, especially The Tale of Genji, were used fre- quently in the Edo period for the patterning of kosode. The influence of Chinese Confucianism, however, was dominant once again in this period because the Tokugawa shogunate considered Confucian ethics necessary as a justification for their totalitarian regime. Consequently, the literati of the late Edo period were well versed in the culture of China, especially the Confucian Twenty-Four Tales of Filial Piety. Objects associated with these and other Chinese legends appear in kosode patterning. The dragon, the phoenix, and other supernatural animals, as well as imaginary floral forms, all introduced when Chinese culture first influenced Japanese design, also Japanese Historical Periods TUMULUS C. 2J0- 552 ASUKA 552- 710 NARA 710- 794 HEIAN 794- 1192 KAMAKURA 1192 - 1336 MUROMACHI 1336 - 1568 MOMOYAMA 1568 - 1603 EDO 1603 - I868 EARLY 1603 - I716 MIDDLE I716 - 1789 LATE 1789 - 1868 MEIJI I868 - I912 TAISHO I912 - 1926 SHOWA 1926 - 1989 HEISEI 1989 - 22 HAYS AND HAYS</page><page sequence="4">were used. Even these motifs were subtly transformed to comply with the Japanese style of natural beauty pre- ferred for kosode patterning. No Drama and Its Development as Related to Costume In order to appreciate how the twenty or so types of No costumes are used for various roles and why their color or patterning may determine the choice of costume, it is necessary to understand both the nature of No drama and how it developed. No is a highly stylized music drama in which the revelation of the truth and beauty of the story is achieved through the constant building-up of a single emotional experience or the creation of the atmospheric conditions essential to the dramatic action. Although the music and the plot are the framework of the action, the dramatic experience shared by the audience is brought to a climax by the principal actor, the shite, through the many move- ments of the dance. Donald Keene, who has written extensively on the N6 drama, analyzed the relationship between the slow-moving poetic quality of N6, the long periods in which there may be no action whatsoever, and the dances involving extraordinary movement: The No repertory comprises a great variety of works, ranging from virtually static celebrations of the glories of a particular shrine to pieces of violent movement in which devils assert their terrible powers. It includes works which are almost purely poetic and symbolic, suggesting the loveliness of plum blossoms or the snow, and others of betrayal and vengeance... the slow-moving poetic works give N6 its meaning and ulti- mate appeal.6 Keene points out the significance of the actor's movements in the dance: "The final dance is extremely important in No, and may make reading the plays seem only a shell of the whole work, but the dance itself is not so much a display of agility or brilliance of movement as a continuation in a different idiom of the mood created by the motionlessness."7 To achieve this very purpose, the masks and costumes worn have been refined in every detail of color, pattern, and style to conform with the manner in which these moods will be expressed. They are major works of art from which the actor makes his choice after deciding how he will interpret the role. The many types of costumes worn today gradually developed over the centuries as No changed from a shrine ritual to the ceremonial entertainment of the Tokugawa shogunate. No originally meant "a performance." The Chinese character for NO means "to be able," which can be interpreted to mean "possessing an ability" and, as applied to a drama, "possessing the ability to perform."s Until the latter half of the fourteenth century, No drama consisted of plays performed as rituals at shrines. These plays were called Sarugaku no No, "Monkey-music per- formance." Originally this strange name was used to facetiously describe the licentious buffoonery that was performed as an antidote to the solemnity of the Shinto song-dance called Kagura. Before the middle of the four- teenth century, however, Sarugaku no No had become a serious dramatic performance and was a rival of Dengaku no No, a "Field-music performance," another serious musical drama that had originated in the rustic exhibitions of acrobatics and juggling. Eventually, Saru- gaku no N6 became a "new kind of performance, includ- ing elements of the Dengaku; the K5waku, a recitation, accompanied by rhythmical tapping with the fan; the Kuse-mai or chanted-dance...; the K6uta or danced popular-ballad...; and the Bugaku or Chinese Court dance."' The actors were inner members of the shrine and the purpose of the plays was to recite the legends of the shrine; to pray for peace, a bountiful harvest, and contin- ued prosperity for future generations; purification by vanquishing evil spirits; and to tell folk legends and stories of a mother's sufferings at the loss of a child. In the early part of the Muromachi period (1336- i168), the third Ashikaga shogun, Yoshimitsu (1358- 1408), and the upper echelon of the military class became interested in the Sarugaku no No, and became patrons of the finest actors. Under the influence of the actors Kan'ami (1333-1384) and his son Zeami (1363-1443?), Sarugaku no No was developed into the drama known today as No. The military aristocracy of the Muromachi period felt inferior to the old court aristocracy rooted in the culture of the Heian period. By using such Heian court literature as the Tales of Ise and The Tale of Genji as inspiration for his NO dramas, Zeami attempted to immerse the military class in the culture of the Heian period. Of course, the actors who played the roles of Heian court officials needed luxurious garments. Ken Kirihata wrote that, when a No performance was especially well received, the shogun and feudal lords present would rise, strip off their own garments and donate them on the spot. According to the Tadasu-gawara Kanju Sarugaku Nikki (records of the sarugaku performances on the riverbank near Tadasu) of 1463, in three days no fewer than 273 garments were donated in this fashion.' In time, these "strippings" were designated according to the kind of garment removed. The act was referred to as "stripping kosode," "stripping suo," and so on."1 NO costumes worn for aristocratic roles in the medieval period did not differ from the garments worn everyday by the members of the upper classes. After the third Tokugawa shogun, lemitsu (r. 1623-1I651), No cos- tumes "began to have certain characteristics different from the everyday wear which previously had made up NO DRAMA COSTUMES AND OTHER JAPANESE COSTUMES 23</page><page sequence="5">part of [the] wardrobe of the actors. They came to be produced specifically for the stage and within the context of the high art of noh."" This change came about because No drama changed from simply an entertainment to a solemn ceremonial art performed for the ruling military class. Over the years, the names given to the various cate- gories of N6 plays have varied. Today the plays usually are divided into five groups: (I) God plays, kamino; also called waki N6. (2) Warrior-courtier plays called shuran6, after the battlefield in hell where the ghost warriors replay their battles. They are also called shura mono. (3) Plays about women, named after the wig, katsura, worn for female roles. They are called kazuran6, using a dif- ferent spelling of katsura, and also katsura mono. (4) Some sources call this group zatsu n6, miscellaneous plays. They are also known as genzaimono, the contem- porary category. Since many of the plays in this miscel- lany concern deranged women, they are known also as kyojo mono, the crazed women category, or monogurui, which means literally "mad women" plays. (5) Plays concerning demons are called kichiku mono and are performed at the end of a program. They are known also as final plays, kirino. A contemporary performance usually consists of three N6 plays, each play from a different group, per- formed in a prescribed order. In addition, there is one comic interlude of a Ky6gen play. There are five schools of No: Kanze, H6sh6, Kita, Komparu, and Kongo. "Each has slight differences in atmosphere, acting style, libretti, and use of masks and costumes.""1 The Significance of the Actor's Choice of Mask and Costume A N6 drama requires very few performers and the stage has no scenery except a painting of the ancient Y6go Pine (at the Kasuga Shrine in Nara) on the wall behind the main stage. Donald Keene wrote of the importance of the costume under these austere circumstances: The brilliance of the N6 costumes relieves the performances from any impression of excessive severity that might be created by the astringent barenness of the stage, the harsh cries of the musicians, and the formal gestures of the dancers. 14 Because the costume and the mask are so important, "A No actor often spends days contemplating the mask he plans to use for a single performance, choosing and re- choosing the costume he will wear with it. The final ensemble is similar to a painting or a musical composi- tion."'5 The minute an actor appears on the stage, a person in the audience versed in the N6 drama can tell from the mask and the costume chosen by the performer and the manner in which it is worn exactly how the actor will interpret the role. In her essay "Color in Noh Costumes," Monica Bethe describes the importance of the colors of the costumes: On the bare, unadorned noh stage, the costumes stand out for their resplendent colors. The rich hues of the garments.. ..fill the stage, evoking an atmosphere of spring or fall and mirror- ing the hearts of the characters portrayed. Colors indicate rank, age and occupation. Colors also carry symbolic impact within the context of a play. 6 For example, karaori costumes with red in the ground weave worn by an actor playing the role of a young woman are designated as iro iri, meaning "with color," but those worn for the role of an older woman are described as iro nashi, meaning "without color," which indicates that red is not used in the ground weave (al- though there may be some red in the patterning). No Costumes in The Art Institute of Chicago Collection Most of the No costumes in the Art Institute's collection are of the late Edo period, but one outstanding costume is a sixteenth-century nuihaku from the early part of the Momoyama period (pls. 1-3; cat. no. i). According to Iwao Nagasaki, Curator of Textiles in the Department of Applied Arts at the Tokyo National Museum, "This is the only example of a Momoyama Period Noh costume in overseas collections .... The design and quality indicate that it is equivalent in value to the one in the Tokyo National Museum.""17 The styling of this nuihaku is typical of the kosode of the Momoyama period with its wide body, close- fitting collar, long neck band, and the original width of the sleeves, which were very narrow. At a later date, pieces of another Momoyama nuihaku were added to the sleeves to widen them so that they would conform to the style of a later period N6 costume (see pl. 2). Thus the Art Institute is fortunate to have not only an entire gar- ment made of the sixteenth-century fabric called nui- haku but also large fragments from another nuihaku garment of the same period. The all-over patterning of this nuihaku is unusual in its variety of motifs. The large, tiered lozenges remi- niscent of pine bark, called matsu kawa bishi, are red on the left side of the garment and filled with embroidered willow branches laden with snow. In contrast, the loz- enges on the right side are white and filled with a variety of embroidered plants and flowers (see pl. 3). On the side with red lozenges, the interstices are white and embroidered with flowers; on the side with white loz- enges, the interstices are red and embroidered with tiny vignettes of rural scenes, each one illustrating some epi- sode in a well-known literary work. 24 HAYS AND HAYS</page><page sequence="6">The manner in which the patterning is arranged on this nuihaku is called katamigawari, meaning "one side differs from the other." This is one of the three types of sectional placement of patterning on kosode that was popular in the Momoyama and early Edo period. A second style called dangawari, "levels different," is seen on a sixteenth century Momoyama nuihaku No costume in the Tokyo National Museum (fig. 2). This costume has red and white squares that alternate the length of the fabric. When the fabric lengths were sewn together, a red square was placed next to a white square. These two squares of the same color are never side by side. They are always are at "different levels." Some of the motifs on the Tokyo National Museum's nuihaku are similar to those on the Art Institute's nuihaku, but the Art Institute's has an almost infinite variety of designs and a richness of detail that gives an impression of no design area in the interstices being repeated. There is a unity of patterning that borders on somoy6, "a complete design." The many vignettes probably illustrate some ancient story. The third type of sectional placement of patterning on Momoyama kosode is katasuso, "shoulders and bottom," meaning that the kosode is patterned only in those areas. A sixteenth-century nuihaku No costume from the Kasuga Shrine, Seki City, Gifu Prefecture (fig. 3) has this type of patterning. This nuihaku uses only the two dominant motifs seen on the Art Institute's nui- haku-the tiered lozenges, matsu kawa bishi, and the willow branches laden with snow, yuki mochi yanagi. The elegant simplicity of the design on the Kasuga Shrine nuihaku is an interesting contrast to the varied and extremely detailed patterning of the Art Institute's nuihaku. The fabric used for the Art Institute's Monoyama nuihaku is called nerinuki. To create the patterning of this nuihaku, lengths of white nerinuki were dyed red in FIGURE 2.

This nuihaku has a design of flowering plants, tanzaku paper, and plank bridges on a red and white checkered ground. A feature of this costume is its dangawari ("levels different"), which is the second type of sectional placement of patterning on kosode. See pls. 1-3, cat. no.

NO DRAMA COSTUMES AND OTHER JAPANESE COSTUMES 25</page><page sequence="7">Types of No Costumes In terms of style, N6 costumes can be divided into three categories: kosodemono, 6sodemono, and bakama. The following descriptions of each type of N6 costume are based on Ken Kirihata's listing in his article "Special Features of Noh Costumes."1 There are various costumes for roles of minor importance, such as the kitsuke, that are not listed; many of these costumes are similar to the garments worn in everyday life. For those costumes represented in The Art Institute of Chicago's collection, the relevant accession, plate, figure, and catalogue numbers are given. i. Kosodemono. Kosode with sleeves made of a single width of fabric and having a small opening for the arm. Note: Kosode are the garments the Western world calls "kimono." The individual name of each of these kosodemono is derived from the name of the fabric used to make the kosode. The various types of kosodemono are: karaori A kosode made of warp-float faced 2/I twill weave with supplementary brocading wefts of long floats that resemble needlework. Worn as an outer robe primarily for female roles.

The patterning may be simple or it may consist of large motifs in strong colors that are used to create startling contrasts. Worn mainly for male roles. atsuita karaori A kosode made of an atsuita fabric but with a bold patterning woven with the longer supplementary weft floats used for karaori. An atsuita karaori is used as an under robe for male roles and as an outer robe for female roles.

The patterning is in stripes, shima, used either horizontally or in plaids. suribaku A kosode of either plain weave or a monochromatic figured satin weave, usually either white or red, on which the patterning is created by impressing gold or silver foil on an adhesive that has been applied to the fabric through a stencil. It is an inner robe worn for the role of a woman tormented by a demon.

Worn either as an outer robe or an inner robe. Can be worn in the koshimaki manner (see below) over a suribaku robe. For a male role, it is an inner robe worn by an emperor, or a noble of high rank, or a youth. Acc. nos. 1928.814, 1964.272, 1930.19 PIs.

The kosode can be two nuihaku, or an inner suribaku and an outer nuihaku, or an inner karaori and an outer nuibaku. The softer and more pliable satin weave outer robe, the nuibaku, is folded down at the waist so that the sleeves hang over the hips. ii. Osodemono. Outer garments with wide sleeves and a large opening for the arm. Some overlap in the front; some do not. The various types of 6sodemono are: ch6ken Literally "long silk" A free-falling, unlined dancing cloak usually made of gauze weave fabric. It does not overlap in the front. The front and back panels are attached only at the shoulders. Used mainly for female roles, but can be used for the role of a nobleman.

The front and back panels are seamed partway down the sides. It is longer than the chbken and worn belted. Used for female roles. mizugoromo Literally "water cloak." An unlined traveling cloak in a single unpatterned color, or with checked or striped patterning. It is sewn at the sides and overlaps in the front. For both male and female roles. kariginu Literally "hunting silk*" A round-necked cloak, either unlined or lined. It is unseamed at the sides except where the sleeves are attached to the back. Narrow ornamental cords are threaded through the edges of the sleeves and tied in a knot below the cuff. Worn for the role of a nobleman or a male deity.

On each side at the hemline it has a wide band to hold together the front and back panels, which are not seamed on the sides. It does not have ornamental cords on the sleeves. Originally, it was an informal costume for court nobles. Today kariginu are usually substituted for n6shi. happi A lined or unlined short coat that does not overlap in the front. The front and back panels, which are not seamed on the sides, are held together at the hemline with a wide band in the manner of the n6shi. Since bappi are worn to imitate armor in the roles of military generals, the most favored fabric is kinran; sometimes colored silk thread is added to create nisbiki. The No costume bappi is different from the bappi worn by commoners. sobatsugi A sleeveless version of the bappi. It also simulates armor but is worn by soldiers, not generals. It is worn also for the roles of Chinese men. hitatare A short lined coat similar to the bappi but with the sides seamed and made of a resist-dyed, patterned hemp fabric. May be worn separately or with matching trousers, bakama, as formal military dress, an outfit that is also called bitatare.

The gathering of a vast number of petals and their processing to make the dye was very time consuming, as were the many times the fabric had to be dipped into the dye to get the desired color. Therefore, only the wealthi- est people could afford garments dyed with beni, the common name for this safflower dye. The present color of the red areas, a light orangish-red, is the result of fading, which occurs when silk dyed with beni is exposed to light. The red areas were originally a bright scarlet. When the edges of the dyed patterning of this nui- haku (pl. i) were observed under a microscope, no needle holes were seen. Therefore, this patterning was not done by the resist-dyeing technique called shibori. When the manner in which the lozenge design is repeated was care- fully analyzed, it became obvious that the patterning was produced by the resist-dyeing technique called itajime. This is a technique in which the fabric is clamped between two wooden boards on which the pattern is carved. Dye is then poured into the carved-out areas of the boards through previously drilled holes, but the dye cannot penetrate the cloth tightly pressed between the sections of the board that are not carved.1 The silk thread in the finest Momoyama and Edo period garments is different from that used in later periods. In researching the fabrics used in Edo period No costumes, Akira Yamaguchi has discovered that, Generally, Edo silk thread had a more beautiful luster and whiteness than the silk of today: it was both finer...and exceedingly strong. Silkworms, however, were weak and cocoons so small.. .that they yielded little thread. Further, while there is no wav to calculate the twist of thread.. .we may assume it was minimal.2C In the earliest methods of hand-reeling the cocoons, there was very little twist in the thread. As more efficient reeling tools were invented, a discernible though slight twist was created in the reeling. The best-quality thread had the least twist and was unwound by hand from cocoons a day or two after they had been spun, while the pupa was still alive within the cocoon. Since this had to be done within a two-week period in the spring before the pupa became a butterfly and broke out of the cocoon, only a relatively small amount of thread could be pro- duced using this method and it was very expensive. Later in the year, the thread taken from cocoons in which the pupa had been killed was not as glossy or resilient. A textile analysis of the Art Institute's Momoyama nurihaku showed that the warp threads in the white undyed areas retain the sericin. The range of colors used in the needlework is limited. It is embroidered in shades of red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white; only a few NO DRAMA COSTUMES AND OTHER JAPANESE COSTUMES 27</page><page sequence="9">FIGURE 3.

This nuibhaku, which has a pattern of pine-bark lozenges and snow-covered willows, has been designed with the third type of sectional placement of patterning on kosode: katasuso ("shoulders and bottom"), meaning that it is patterned only in the upper and lower areas of the costume. To compare this type of pattern with that of other nuibaku, see fig. 2 and pls. 1-3. embroidery stitches are used, namely satin, single satin, surface satin, stem stitches, and couching. Outlines of motifs to be embroidered were drawn in black sumi ink. The gold foil was impressed over an adhesive that was applied with stencils after the needlework was worked. This is evident because minute fragments were left in the embroidery floss when the gold leaf was removed. A few areas were re-embroidered at a later date.21' The Art Institute has two other nuihaku, one from the middle Edo period with additional needlework added in the late Edo period (pl. 4; fig. 4; cat. no. 2), and another dated late Edo period (pl. 5; fig. 5; cat. no. 3). On the middle Edo period nuihaku, the needlework added later was done to make the garment conform to the taste of the late Edo period, when it was fashionable to put as much embellishment as possible into an allotted space. The late Edo period nuihaku was carefully studied and precisely dated by Iwao Nagasaki, who wrote that this nuihaku "displays the premodern style of tightly arranged patterns lacking broad, empty spaces. It is con- sidered to have been made at the beginning of the 19th century, as there exists an equivalent example which bears an inscription of its production date, 1826, and is owned by the Itsukushima Shrine in Hiroshima."'' In the needlework of this nuihaku there is gold- wrapped thread.23 Four rows of this thread are laid side- by-side, and couched together, two rows at a time. Such a lavish use of gold-wrapped thread is typical of the period. A flat gold thread is also used in Japanese needle- work and weaving. When used in weaving, this gold thread can have the appearance of surihaku, which is the technique of pressing thin sheets of gold foil onto a paste applied directly to the fabric. On both of the Edo period nuihaku kosode, the surihaku technique used with the embroidered motifs was applied after the needlework was completed. 28 HAYS AND HAYS</page><page sequence="10">The squares of silver foil on the surihaku back- ground of the dark blue satin nuihaku (see fig. 4) create a dramatic effect that could well be considered sufficient patterning for a kosode without any needlework added. The No costume called surihaku are patterned with just the impressed gold or silver leaf. The Art Institute's red satin surihaku kosode (pl. 6; cat. no. 4) also uses the checkered pattern, ishidatami. These squares, however, are only on the skirt and are arranged as lozenges. In contrast, the bodice has a curvilinear design of overlap- ping waves, sei-ga-ha. The surihaku kosode is worn as an inner robe, and, if the outer robe is worn koshimaki style (see "Types of No Costumes"), most of the patterning on the skirt is hidden. The technical analysis of the fabric revealed that the adhesive on which the gold foil is impressed is only lightly sponged on the fabric of the skirt. The gold foil used is quite thin and, when applied on the adhesive, only partly covers the surface of the squares. On the bodice, a thick layer of gold foil is applied over a substantial amount of adhesive. Karaori kosode are the NO costumes most often seen in Western collections. As early as the Heian period, karaori, meaning "Chinese weaving," was a term used to designate textiles imported from China (Kara). In the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, sumptuous textiles imported from Ming Dynasty (1368-1644) China were used for NO costumes. In time, one of these Chinese imported textiles came to be known as karaori, and NO costume kosode made of this fabric were also called karaori. While the early karaori No costumes were made of fabrics imported from China, shortly after 1578 the weavers of Kyoto were producing karaori, a warp-faced 2/I twill patterned with long floats of supplementary brocading wefts that resemble needlework stitches. In this weave they were attempting to imitate the needle- work of the Momoyama period. The Art Institute's karaori NO costume (pl. 7; cat. no. 5) is a classic example of a karaori patterned with autumn grasses against a background of large red and white squares. The patterning in one square spills over into the adjoining square in a manner typical of the latter half of the eighteenth century. On earlier kosode with this type of patterning, the motifs were contained within the square. The red and white squares are created by dyeing the warp threads before weaving them. Weaving done with pre-dyed warp threads is called warp ikat or rung dyeing. The red in the ground weave of this karaori is the iro iri, "with color," that makes it an appropriate costume for the role of a young woman. The autumn flowers are used either to indicate the season or to evoke a sense of the passage of time. In this karaori, there are, in addition to the silk brocading wefts, flat-gold paper thread brocading wefts bound by the main warps in a 1/2 weft-float faced twill. Akira Yamaguchi described the making of this thread: In the Edo period, the washi, paper used for backing was superior torinoko made in Eichizen (Fukui Prefecture); for adhesives they used first class kudzu [kuzu, arrowroot] paste FIGURE 4.

The gold was beaten into foil by hand and was fairly thick. Since the paper was also cut by hand, the resultant strips were not of strictly uniform widths.24 The other karaori kosode (pl. 8; cat. no. 6) also has a 2/1 warp-faced twill ground weave in checkered ikat squares but the colors are reddish brown and blue, iro nashi, "without color," meaning no bright red, and are appro- priate for the role of an older woman. The brocading wefts that create the patterning of water plants are in subdued colors such as yellow-green, green, three shades of blue, two of purple, two of brown, off-white, and white. The ground weave is almost entirely covered with horizontal rows of water plants broken at intervals with a stylized trailing mist in flat gold paper thread to relieve the austerity of the color scheme. The Art Institute has three atsuita karaori kosode (pls. 9-11; cat. nos. 7-9). All of them are patterned in long weft brocading floats that resemble needlework.The motifs are very large and repeated over and over in closely-spaced horizontal rows. They could be worn as an outer robe for the role of a woman of strong character or as an under robe for a male role. The textile called atsuita is a stiff, heavily patterned fabric. Its name is derived from the thick board, called atsuita, around which this fabric was rolled when it was imported from China in the sixteenth century. The No costume atsuita is made from this type of fabric. At Nishijin in Kyoto during the second half of the seven- teenth century, the weavers began to weave atsuita pat- terned with the long supplementary weft brocading floats used for karaori. The atsuita karaori costumes in the collection of the Art Institute are made of this type of fabric.25 Today some textile authorities call this fabric karaori. The variation in the subtle colors of the checkered background within the large ikat dyed squares of the atsuita karaori (see pl. 9) is as important a part of the aesthetic appeal of the patterning as the large motifs. The motifs used for the patterned background of both karaori and atsuita karaori are usually geometric motifs based on the traditional Heian yusoku patterns of Japanese court costumes. Over the centuries, these motifs have acquired symbolic meanings usually relating to prosperity, wealth, or some desirable personal attribute. They may be chosen because they express a sentiment compatible with that expressed by the larger motifs. Another No costume (pl. io) is patterned with flower carts against a geometrically patterned back- ground. Kosode with this patterning can be found among karaori and atsuita karaori No costumes. To positively identify a N6 robe as atsuita karaori, it is necessary to know the role for which the actor chooses to wear it. The patterning of another atsuita karaori costume (pl. II) is very unusual and possibly inappropriate for a NO cos- tume because it has motifs associated with wedding cere- FIGURE 5.

There are the origami, folded-paper butter- flies, the male butterfly, 5cho, and the female but- terfly, mech5. In spite of this unorthodox patterning, this kosode is tailored as a No costume. The ch5ken, an unlined patterned gauze weave cloak with very wide sleeves, is a very graceful dancing garment worn mainly in female roles or for the role of a courtier to express his refined elegance. The Art Institute has two ch ken. Usually a ch ken is patterned with widely scat- tered "palace motifs," gosho mon, that may refer to a classical story. On eighteenth-century choken, the indi- vidual motifs on both the back and front at the chest and shoulder level are large, with much smaller motifs that are sometimes a variation of the larger motif on the skirt and the lower part of the sleeves. The Art Institute's choken are later. One of these choken (pl. 12; cat. no. io) has an all-over pattern of large fan papers across the top of the cloak from which fall trailing vines of fuyu aoi in a manner similar to early twentieth-century kosode patterning. To weave gauze requires great skill, and the complex weave of the white chaken (pl. 12) and the Art Institute's other chbken (pl. 14; cat. no. i i) are both tours de force of the weaving art. This red swastika-patterned gauze choken has the same large motif or a mirror image of it scattered over the entire garment. It is a motif similar to that seen on mid-nineteenth-century obi. This choken has been retailored and a lining has been added at a later date. The cords that add weight to the sleeve ends are missing from both of these chaken. The Art Institute has two patterned gauze weave costumes (pls. 13 and 15; cat. nos. 12-13) that are not tailored to conform with any of the wide-sleeved outer No costumes. The length of each garment approximates that of the maiginu and both overlap in the front as does a maiginu. The sides are not seamed and there are bands on each side at the hemline to hold together the open sides. These two features are characteristic of the No happi (see "Types of No Costumes"). The happi, however, does not overlap in the front and is a shorter garment. Although these garments came into the Art Institute's collection as No costumes, it is impossible to assign them to any specific style of No costume. It is possible that they are an outer summer garment worn by the warrior class on a ceremonial occasion. The flat gold-paper thread used in the patterning of these costumes (pls. 13 and i5) is unusual because it has gold foil on both sides of the paper core. On darker gauze weave costumes, the glow of the gold-paper thread through the gauze weave would give an added sheen to the fabric. Researchers who have examined hundreds of No costumes say they have never seen this type of gold thread on a No costume. Hakama, skirtlike trousers, are tailored in many different styles. Each style has its special name. The oguchi and the hangiri both have stiffened fabric at the back, but the hangiri is stiffened with an interlining of woven reeds.26 The Art Institute's white satin weave han- NO DRAMA COSTUMES AND OTHER JAPANESE COSTUMES 31</page><page sequence="13">FIGURE 7.

This patterning is very similar to that of an eighteenth-century oguchi in the Tokyo National Museum with a design of chrysanthemums floating on water. The patterning on the red satin weave hangiri (pl. 17; cat. no. 15) is of clouds and the sacred wheel, rimbd. This is the type of ydsoku motif patterning usually found on hangiri. On the underside of the hangiri fabric in areas where there is no gold thread in the patterning, there are bound white strips of paper thread without gold foil to maintain the consistent texture and weight of the fabric. In 1940, the Art Institute acquired as a single gift three pieces of a costume worn for the role of a courtier: an awase kariginu, a round-necked lined outer coat fash- ioned after the Heian hunting cloak; sashinuki, pleated trousers gathered and tied at the ankles; and a koshi obi, the sash used to adjust the length of the kariginu (pls. 18- 20; cat. nos. i6-i8).The koshi obi is the only NC costume accessory in the Art Institute's collection. It should not be confused with the narrower embroidered headbands, kazura obi, that cover the cords that hold the mask in place. A Ky6gen is an informal play performed without masks. It supplies comic relief to offset the austere, concentrated, emotion-charged atmosphere of the No play that precedes it and the one that will follow. The story usually involves a humorous conflict between the master, a member of the lesser nobility, and his servants. The Art Institute's two-piece Kyogen costume, a kami- shimo (pls. 21-22; cat. no. 19) would have been worn over a noshime (see "Types of N6 Costumes") by the master. The inappropriate fabric used for the kamishimo is an unspoken comment on the provincialism of the master and suggests his social ambitions that will lead him even- tually into various humorous situations. This all-over 32 HAYS AND HAYS</page><page sequence="14">pattern of dragons amidst stylized clouds is a classic design reserved for garments of great dignity such as Buddhist priests' robes, kesa, or the outer coat, dobuku, worn by the highest military officials. The silk and cotton fabric of which this kamishimo is made is patterned with a comic version of this classic design. Other Japanese Costumes in the Art Institute In the Western world, the casual observer of Japanese costumes, seeing only the general appearance of the outer garments, calls most of them "kimono." To the Japanese people, "kimono" means simply "clothing." As with Western costume, each Japanese garment has a specific name depending upon subtle variations in styling and color or whether it is worn for a special occasion or in a certain manner. The word kosode, which specifically designates a full-length robe with a shorter sleeve that has a small opening for the arm, has also come to be used as a generic term. The Tokyo National Museum divides its "kosode dress" into kosode,furisode, uchikake, koshimaki, kata- bira, hitoe, aigi, ubugi, and yogi.27 The Art Institute has four types of "kosode dress": uchikake, furisode, aigi, and kosode. Each of these kosode was originally a length of plain or damask woven white silk fabric. When various lengths of the white silk were sewn into a kosode, it became "a painter's canvas," on which the designer outlined his "picture." The kosode was then taken apart and various textile artists would execute this "picture" with dyes, needlework stitches, and painting. Since so many "artists" were involved in the creation of these works of art, they were not signed. Even as the N6 actor's selection of his costume was made according to certain accepted rules regarding its use, women had to select their items of dress according to their age, social position, marital status, and the occasion on which a garment would be worn. Bright colors and elaborate patterning were the privilege of the young. Until married, a girl wore the long, swinging sleeves of thefurisode and, after marriage, the shorter sleeves of the kosode. Economics and social practices controlled the use of luxurious fabrics expensively patterned. These were reserved for the upper classes. The use of certain motifs also indicated the social status of the wearer, such as the yusoku motifs or objects and scenes from literary sources that revealed the wearer's intellectual accomplishments. In the introductory section on symbolism, the devel- opment of the Japanese idea of beauty, way&amp;, in textile design was discussed. This aesthetic is foremost in kosode design. Tomoyuki Yamanobe, in discussing the develop- ment of the "variety in patterning and delicacy of expres- sion" of fukusa design, wrote that in the Edo period the fukusa had many similarities to kosode: "They both FIGURE 8.

That is to say, both have pictorial patterns with an asymmetrical realistic quality based on nature. The contemplation of nature has been part of the Japanese aesthetic from ancient times."'- Most kosode are worn belted with a sash, an obi. The Art Institute is fortunate in having an uchikake (pl. 23; fig. 7; cat. no. 20) that is worn as an outer coat without an obi. The very large fuki, an extension at the hemline of the lining covering a thickly padded roll, weighted the uchikake so that it trailed gracefully over the tatami matted floor. The delicate needlework illustrating scenes from the The Tale of Genji would be destroyed if an obi were wrapped around it.The light blue color, the pattern- ing, and the long, swinging sleeves of a furisode indicate that this uchikake is a garment for a young unmarried woman. The Art Institute has four other furisode. Three of these would be worn with the left side folded over the right side and held in place with an obi. The fourth may be an uchikake. All are made of rinzu, a satin damask weave. Extremely skillful yuzen dyeing was used to create the patterning on the first of these furisode (pl. 24; fig. I; cat. no. 21) At various times in the dyeing process, areas to remain white were kept from absorbing the dyes by applying a paste resist by hand. A paper cone was used to apply free-hand the paste used to resist the white lines of the tree. The resist paste that created the imitation tie- dyeing, surihitta, used for some of the tachibana, manda- rin oranges, was applied to the cloth through the stencils. Many other stencils were used for the grain of the cypress wood of the fan guards and in some background details of the scenes from The Tale of Genji. These scenes and other areas were hand-painted with dyes. Then all these patterned areas were covered with another resist paste and the brown background dye was brushed on. After all the paste was removed by immersing the fabric in run- ning water, the needlework was added and additional details painted in sumi ink. The motifs in the patterning of this furisode (pl. 24) express wishes for a long and prosperous life. The tachi- bana tree is an auspicious symbol of longevity, and the unfolding cypress fans, hi6gi, suggest ever-expanding prosperity. These fans carried by Heian courtiers were chosen as an appropriate motif on which to display scenes from The Tale of Genji. These scenes of the cultural attainments of Genji express a wish that the wearer of the furisode may continue to live a life of equal refinement. The shorter sleeves of this furisode, the darker background, and the rather subdued coloring of the patterning make it appropriate for an older person. The patterning of clouds and scattered aoi leaves on anotherfurisode (pl. 25; fig. 8; cat. no. 22) is very simple when compared with the intricate designs on the brown furisode discussed above. When the edges of the red clouds are examined under a microscope, there are none of the needle holes required for the running stitches necessary for the most common type of the resist-dyeing technique called shibori. The dyed areas were created by a more difficult type of shibori, oboshi shibori. The fabric was gathered together with the fingers against a circular disk inserted beneath the fabric; then the gathers were held in place by wrapping string around the disk. The cloth not to be dyed was resisted by covering it with bamboo husks. For example, the red areas were dyed, while the rest of the fabric was covered with the bamboo husk.Then the red areas were covered with bamboo husk resist and the blue areas were dyed. When the dyeing was completed very fine undyed white lines were left between the red and blue areas, and these were covered with couched gold-wrapped thread. The informal pairs of this type of aoi, asarum, leaves in the patterning of this furisode (pl. 25) suggests that it would have belonged to a member of one of the branches of the Tokugawa family that had been awarded the priv- ilege of using a crest, mon, of paired thirteen-veined aoi leaves.29 In the Edo period, upper-class families some- times incorporated their crest into the patterning of a textile. In the late Edo or early Meiji period, the family crest was placed on the center back, the back of the sleeves, and on the chest at the left and right sides of the garment. At this time, the common people also began to use a family crest in this manner. The realistically drawn blossoming plum tree on the red furisode (pl. 26; fig. 9; cat. no. 23) is yet another type of furisode patterning. The carefully delineated picture of a tree embroidered from shoulder to hemline on the back of this furisode shows the influence of Western art on Japanese design. Needlework typical of this period was used to portray realistically the contours of the tree trunk. First the edges of the trunk were padded with a heavy thread and, over this padding, gold-wrapped thread was couched with red silk thread. This furisode belonged to a family whose crest was the tachibana. Since these large crests are placed as described above, this furisode would be worn on formal occasions, probably as an uchikake, an outer coat worn without an obi. An obi worn over this furisode would interrupt the flow of the patterning. Another use of the family crest is seen on an aigi (pl. 27; cat. no. 24). Aigi are full-length kosode worn under an uchikake and are usually patterned by kanoko, "fawn spot," tie-dying. Here the large tie-dyed design of tea plant fruit crests, chanomi mon, are scattered over the flowing water design, called Kanze mizu. Iwao Nagasaki wrote, "This stylized design of flowing water is said to 34 HAYS AND HAYS</page><page sequence="16">FIGURE 9. Furisode (detail of pl. 26). Late Edo period, nineteenth century.

The Art Institute is fortunate in having three winter kosode because they are garments seldom found in collec- tions. Two still have their inner padding of silk floss. The source of this wadding, mawata, is the pierced cocoons, degara, from which the moth has emerged.3' After being soaked, the pierced cocoon can be stretched into a large flat square. The tenth print in a series of woodcuts by Utamaro entitled Women's Work in Silk Culture (Joshoku kaiko tewaza gusa) shows women stretching this waste silk floss on wooden posts (see, in this issue, James T. Ulak, "Utamaro's Views of Sericulture," fig. 7c). The patterning of the woven fabrics used to make these winter kosode provides a brief glimpse of the eighteenth-century skills of the Nishijin weavers of Kyoto. The fabrics used for these winter kosode also would have been used for kesa, the Japanese priest's mantle, usually considered a robe. One of the winter kosode (pl. 29; cat. no. 25) has an all-over pattern of rows of large clusters of fanciful fruits and flowers. This pattern may be a late eighteenth- century Japanese version of the Western bizarre-type silks woven in Europe in the early eighteenth century. The lining of this kosode is missing, but it still has an interlining. Another winter kosode (pl. 30; fig. o0; cat. no. 26) has an all-over pattern of dragons chasing the sacred jewel amidst clouds.

As recently as 1914, this type of fabric was called Yezo (i.e. Ezo) nishiki, "Produced at In-u, one of the Northern Provinces of Japan. Pattern: Banreki-Ryu (celebrated Ming pattern of dragons)."33 One version of this pattern was incorrectly assumed to have been "copied from an original Ainu design."34 The Japanese version of this pattern, called Ezo nishiki, was considered one of the most prized productions of the Nishijin looms during the Edo period. This fabric was especially prized for campaign coats, jinbaori, for a gen- eral; kesa for high-ranking Buddhist monks; and temple furnishings. There are many variations on this pattern, including a humorous one used for the Art Institute's kamishimo (pl. 22), a Ky6gen costume, in which the dragons searching amidst the clouds seem unable to find the sacred jewels. The third padded winter garment is actually a furi- sode (pl. 28; cat. no. 27). The ground wefts of this fabric are strips of narrow, flat gold-paper thread of various widths, which means they were cut by hand, not by machine. They were inserted one at a time and pulled from selvage to selvage by a hooked bamboo stick. Against this plain weave background with its soft, almost indiscernible golden glow, supplementary patterning weft floats weave undulating trunks of blooming plum trees. Although it is difficult to believe that this fabric was woven on a draw loom without a Jacquard attachment, this device did not come to Japan until 1873. Both the patterning and the technical analysis of the gold paper indicate an eighteenth-century date. The Art Institute has both a woman's haori and a man's haori, which are informal three-quarter-length outer coats. Haori are lined to the waist with a patterned fabric. The black plain weave fabric of the woman's haori (pl. 31; cat. no. 28) gives no hint of the luxurious pink satin weave lining patterned with clematis, tessen, and scrolling vines and leaves in a spiraling meander, kara- kusa, literally "Chinese grasses." These patterns, some- times called arabesques, have hardly changed since the eighth century. The man's haori (pl. 32; cat. no. 29) is one of the finest pieces of weaving among the garments discussed in this article. It is plain weave double cloth (see Glossary). It has been woven with two different patterns. Most of this haori is woven in a wavy pattern resembling ikat, but an area extending from the chest to the hip line is an extremely fine lattice pattern, mijin goshi. No robes for the most dignified characters have lat- tices on which the horizontal stripes predominate. On the outside of this haori, the strips are vertical, but inside on the lining, known only to the wearer, there are bold horizontal strips. Perhaps a sly symbolism exists in the patterning of this haori. In the N6 drama Okina, the old man wears a noshime, an under robe, with the top and bottom of a plain color but with a lattice pattern, Okina goshi, around the waist, which is just barely visible under the kariginu. Although the lattice pattern, mijin goshi, on this twentieth-century haori is not the Okina goshi lat- tice, it may have been chosen for this haori because the wearer was a devotee of the No drama. If so, he would understand that it conveyed a prayer for good fortune and happiness, just like the No dance of the sacred elderly man, Okina. Possibly this warm padded haori was a gift to an elderly man at the New Year. 36 HAYS AND HAYS</page><page sequence="18">Notes BETHE, "The Use of Costumes in No Drama," pp. 6-i9. I.
