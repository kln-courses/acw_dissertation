Gesprache fir Freimiiurer "To keep the secret is evidently to tell it as a nonsecret, inasmuch as it is not tellable." Maurice Blanchot -The Writing of the Disaster Patricia Anne Simpson In Ernst und Falk. Gesprdchefiir Freimdurer Lessing speculates in the form of five Socratic and scholastic dialogues about the capacity of language to tell the truth. The two figures, Ernst, a young, aspiring, and eventually disillusioned free- mason, and Falk, a seasoned freemason who has mastered the rhetorical ability to speak in figures, discuss the role of freemasonry within and without society. Within a carefully structured time frame, marked by the natural movement of the sun, Ernst and Falk raise questions about the moral, social, political, and peculiar principles and practices upheld by the Orders. The two friends both thematize and dramatize the relationship between the theory and practice of freemasonry in the development of the dialogues, attending as well to the larger context of so- ciety. Lessing laces the dialogues with self-commentary, referring not only to the content, but to the form of argumentation. The truth is not as important as how it is told. Lessing stages these scenes of speaking, thereby setting the dialogues in a dramatic frame in which the thoughts, mediated by language, lead to action: theory is put into practice. The secret of freemasonry involves the performative function of language. The truth as such cannot be told: it must be either figured, told as a nonsecret, or performed, thus becoming public and losing its status of secrecy. Throughout this discourse about the relationship between freemasonry and society, Lessing posits a theory of figurative language in which the sign and symbol, two uninterchangable linguistic figures, become charged with the sig- nification of truth. It is troublesome, however, that the truth must be told in fig- ures, which prove to be epistemologically unstable. Language cannot guarantee truth: the words themselves perform no cognition of what they say. In the con- text of these dialogues, Falk, especially, is often able to articulate what he means, but Ernst misinterprets the figurative language used. Language seems somehow out of control. In the Gespriche, Lessing establishes a correspondence between words and Patricia Anne Simpson 17</page><page sequence="2">deeds, originally the principle of freemasonry (governed, one hopes, by a moral conscience). If we enlarge the frame, we can include moments from Lessing's biography, suggestive for the argument of language's performative capacity. Lessing himself became a freemason. In 1771 he was accepted into the Hamburg "Loge zu den drei Rosen." He was, like Ernst, bored and disappointed with the Order; he refused to participate in the founding of a lodge in Wolfenbiittel. In- stead, he wrote these dialogues and dedicated them to the Herzog, himself a free- mason.' Lessing inscribes himself into the text in the figure of Ernst, but also in the figure of the "Third," or the narrator. The first two dialogues were published in 1778: four and five came out two years later, and Lessing included the threat of censorship in the second preface. These critical pieces did indeed effect reform within the lodges, underscoring the potential of language to refer to and even change the world. The application of Lessing's Sprachskepsis, or his doubt about the ability of lan- guage to "express all true truths" is misguided in regard to these dialogues. It is not sufficient to refer to the documented dislike of language's shortcomings to account for something in language which is itself unaccountable. Rather than question the instrumentality of language, Lessing explores the relationship be- tween specifically figurative language and the truth, between rhetoric and episte- mology. Rhetoric and the successful manipulation of signs and symbols become the most significant linguistic faculty in these dialogues. It is not skepticism, but fear of the power, and therefore the danger of figurative language that is at work in Ernst und Falk. The sign and the symbol occupy a central position in Lessing's speculation about the dialectical structure of language. The issues of "arbitrary" and "natural" relationships within language led to the privileged classification of the symbol over the sign in eighteenth-century semiotics. The natural relationship between the signifier and the signified in the symbol takes precedence over the arbitrary bond of the sign. The natural element implies a causality that cannot be attributed to language without risking phenomenalization. Nor is the sign static. A nostalgia for some original linguistic state when words and things had the abil- ity to coincide propels the sign into symbol. The figurative language in this particular discourse erects an aesthetic model of the state with reference to an aesthetics based on a mimesis of nature. Elsewhere in Lessing's work, Laokoon, for example, he concentrates on the generic capacity of poetry and painting to signify: he remains in an aesthetic realm.2 In Ernst und Falk, however, I would suggest that the stakes are even higher, for in these dialogues Lessing posits a theory of the state based on an aesthetic model; he tests the rhe- torical capacity of language to signify in an ethical, as well as in an aesthetic mode. From our perspective in the latter half of the twentieth century, we sense a certain danger in confusing the state of nature and the nature of the state. I would like to sketch briefly attempts both remote and recent to define or regulate sign and symbol; next I will attempt to locate Lessing along this itiner- 18 Lessing's Theory ofLanguage</page><page sequence="3">ary. A tropological description of the five dialogues will focus on specific ex- amples of Lessing's use of figurative language. I will conclude with some general comments on the difficulty Lessing had in coming to terms with his own modernity and how he anticipated the aesthetics of Romanticism. We understand eighteenth-century sign theory largely through the work of Ferdinand de Saussure. His attempts to systematize the work of historical linguis- tics led him inevitably to the question of the relationship between the sign and the symbol. I begin at the end because Lessing in some ways anticipated Saussure's point, but did not spell it out. "No one," Saussure writes, disputes the principle of the arbitrary nature of the sign, but it is often easier to discover a truth than to assign to it its proper place. . . . The word symbol has been used to designate the linguistic sign, or more specifically, what is here called the signifier. .... One characteristic of the symbol is that it is never wholly arbitrary; it is not empty, for there is the rudiment of a natural bond between the signifier and the signified.3 Saussure focuses on the relationship between the sign and the symbol without specifying the nature of the difference between them. The nature of the sign is ar- bitrary, whereas that of the symbol is not. The "natural bond" occurs between the word and the image that word evokes. Saussure does not speculate on the im- plications of this definition. Derrida's reading of Saussure takes this definition to task and to its logical con- clusion: In Saussurian language, what Saussure does not say would have to be said: there is neither symbol nor sign but a becoming-sign of the symbol.4 We can conclude, perhaps a bit blithely from the preceding quotations, that the sign and symbol mutually interfere with each other, and vie for privileged status. The sign is potentially more dangerous than the symbol, precisely because it func- tions independently of the natural properties of its referent: it "uses" or "cites" examples without being beholden to them.5 Lessing elaborates his own theory of verbal and visual signs in Laokoon (1766), in which he concludes that the signs of art must be motivated (in order to have imitation or mimesis); the signs of painting are extended in space, and those of poetry in time; painting, therefore, can only represent what is extended in space, and in poetry, what unfolds in time.6 Based on these and comments made else- where about the higher order of the naturally motivated sign, the symbol, ono- matopoeia, etc., we witness in Lessing a need to regulate the arbitrariness of figu- rative language, to control or correct figurality in general. In spite of this compul- sion, Lessing succeeded in placing the sign and an unmotivated relationship be- tween the signifier and the signified at the center of aesthetic questions. With this preface, I will turn to the text itself. The five dialogues share similar Patricia Anne Simpson 19</page><page sequence="4">structures and narrative strategies. Each dialogue is self-exemplary; it ends with a figure that accounts for and literalizes the speculative contents of the dialogue itself. This tactic demonstrates the ostensible theme of the Gespriiche, namely the relationship between words and things, thought and deed, and, on a larger scale, nature and the state. These dialogues are not only Socratic, but scholastic as well. Throughout the text, Ernst and Falk make oblique references to the tenets, truths, and secrets of freemasonry without ever revealing the contents of these truths. It is not that language cannot tell the truth, but that language cannot tell the truth as well. Lessing marks certain moments on the way to understanding with figures from the natural world, presumably motivated; and from the opposite, cultural world, including the use of etymology and translation in the mistaken inscription of the signs and symbols of freemasonry. He ends the dialogues with an image of light, drawing on both the natural and arbitrary, motivated and unmotivated sign to characterize the role of freemasonry in the political life of the state. This is the critical moment in the discourse when the sign and symbol become indistinguish- able. The moment is motivated by the need to account for the existence of the in- stitution by positing some kind of natural need for freemasonry within society. Lessing exposes this relationship as acquired, arbitrary, in the moment he con- verts the symbols of freemasonry back into signs. The "natural" relationship be- tween the Order and society, the "truth" and "essence" of freemasonry turn out to be unspeakable secrets. The "Vorrede eines Dritten" ("Preface of a Third") contains a textual history of the manuscript at hand and a summary of its contents, "Die wahre Ontologie der Freimaiurerei."7 Ernst visits Falk, who is on a water-cure. The first dialogue opens with an innocuous question about thought and language: "Woran denkst du, Freund," asks Ernst. "An nichts," is Falk's reply. He later says: "Wenn ich an etwas dichte, worde ich darfiber sprechen. Nichts geht oiber das laut denken mit einem Freunde" (43). Thinking aloud with a friend is a pleasure, according to Falk. Ernst, whose curiosity and relentless questioning about the truth of free- masonry are burdensome but tolerated, enjoys this process less, for he is on the outside. This "thinking aloud" is the thematic crux of the dialogues, for it points to the problem that thought must be represented. Lessing, throughout the dia- logues, refers to the sartorial trope of language as the dress of thought: thought is somehow interior, and language, its representation, exterior. This inside/outside metaphor relates thematically to the interplay between the exterior symbols of freemasonry and its true essence. The dialogue proceeds with a series of questions that are not questions, answers that are not answers. The linearity of the discourse is interrupted by Falk's evasive procedures. Ernst at one point cries: "Freilich! -Aber antworte mir gerader zu. -Bist du ein Freimiurer?" The equivocal response is "Ich glaube es zu sein" (43). Falk is a freemason not because he believes in the outward signs of the Orders, the "Worte und Zeichen und Gebriuche" (44), to which Ernst is initially attracted. 20 Lessing's Theory ofLanguage</page><page sequence="5">Freemasonry becomes an allegory in this dialogue. Falk defines it as follows: "Die Freimliurerei ist nichts willkiirliches, nichts entbehrliches: sondern etwas not- wendiges, das in dem Wesen des Menschen und der biirgerlichen Gesellschaft gegriindet ist" (44). It is neither arbitrary nor dispensible: it is internal in man and in his organizations, says Falk. Its true nature, like some transcendental signified, is inaccessible, unspeakable. The reference in this dialogue to rhetoric is significant. Ernst uses the metaphor of the cogs in the wheel of a machine to describe the relationship between motiva- tion and action: this leads Falk to comment on his friend's rhetorical skills: Freund, sei billig! - Hyperbel, Quidproquo [Verwechselung] juner schalen Reden und Lieder! Probewerk! Jiingerarbeit! Ernst: Das will sagen: Bruder Redner ist ein Schwaitzer. Falk: Das will nur sagen: was Bruder Redner an den Freimriurern preiset, das sind nun freilich ihre Taten eben nicht. Denn Bruder Redner ist wenig- stens kein Plaudrer; und Taten sprechen von selbst (46). Falk emphasizes the emptiness of rhetoric that does not persuade the recipient into action. Rhetoric is on the outside; the anthropomorphic "speaking deeds" (one could be tempted to call them speech acts) are the essence of freemasonry, not the self-satisfying inflations of the almost allegorical "Bruder Redner." The first dialogue ends and the second begins with Falk going off to chase a butterfly, and Ernst contemplating an ant colony. The butterfly symbolizes Falk's evasive strategy in the first dialogue. The ant colony becomes a figure for an egalitarian society, when contrasted to the organizational principle of the bees, namely mon- archy. Ernst is tired of freemasons and their word play, and wants to talk about something else. Falk suggests the relationship between the individual and the state as a topic for conversation. Naturally, they end up talking about free- masonry without talking about it. The figure of the ants provides an aesthetic model for the state. (One may think ahead to Schiller's description of the state as an English dance, by way of contrast.) Ernst proves himself to be half a freemason when he comments on the telling of truths: "Eine Wahrheit, diejeder nach seiner eigenen Lage beurteilet, kann leicht gemiBbraucht werden." Falk says in delayed response: "Der Weise kann nicht sagen, was er besser verschweigt" (50). Only in figures can these two speakers address indirectly the role of freemasonry in society. Within this figurative discourse, the truth can be told, but it is kept silent by the wise man who knows the performative power of language. The second dialogue revolves thematically around the relationship of the indi- vidual to society, or the parts to the whole. At the end of the dialogue, Falk turns to freemasonry, saying what he didn't want to say. After piquing Ernst's interest, Falk responds to the call for breakfast: "Komm! Dort, in der gr6Beren Gesell- schaft, werden wir bald Stoff zu einer tauglichern Unterredung finden. Komm!" (57). The third dialogue begins with Ernst having followed Falk to his bedroom, after he spent all day in "society." Ernst wants proof that the freemasons really do Patricia Anne Simpson 21</page><page sequence="6">good because they are so good-intentioned. Falk refuses to speak about inten- tions; he encourages Ernst to hold onto the belief that freemasons correct the nec- essary evils of any state. Ernst comments on Falk's position: "Ich fdirchte, du ver- kaufst mir deine Spekulation fiir Tatsache" (60). Here we see the problem of "thinking aloud with a friend," as well as the problem of citationality, which authorizes the elevation of speculation to truth. There is an apodictic tone in Falk's pronouncements; he speaks in figures, which can and must be interpreted, perhaps misinterpreted. In fact, at the end of the third dialogue, we witness meta- phor run amok. Falk ironically offers a series of figures to dissuade Ernst from joining the freemasons. This speaking in tongues has misfired, for Ernst does indeed join up. Falk's powers of persuasion include the use of irony. The strategy of this type of argumentation is lost on Ernst, who does the opposite of what Falk intended. Lessing incorporates the historical lapse of time and the attempt to censor him into the narrator's preface to dialogues four and five. The publisher, purported not to be a freemason, could hardly suppress the manuscripts that contain such "herrliche Wahrheiten" (62). The truth will out, if the truth must be told. Lessing uses the figure of light, the possibility of vision, to describe the function of publication. Light, both natural and artificial, will figure prominently in the subsequent dialogues, as it has up to this point. We meet a disillusioned, disappointed, and bitter Ernst, who has become a freemason. Long after Falk's water-cure is over, the two meet again, shake hands significantly, and debate the relative merits of the institution to which both now belong. Ernst was attracted to the egalitarian potential of freemasonry, and found, true to "form," that freemasons built their own walls within the cult. He hoped to find tolerance, and found a politics of exclusion, mentioning that free- masons did not, for example, accept Jews as members. Ernst has witnessed the worst: the occultists, the alchemists, the quackery, and the abuse of power; each endeavor points to the misguided attempt to turn words -by magical incantation or by political parlance-into something of tangible value. He blames Falk for having misled him. Falk, however, criticizes the institution, not the essence of freemasonry, which he compares to the role of the church and religion. Falk ad- monishes Ernst not to concentrate on the outward signs of the Orders, "Schema, Hiille, Einkleidung" (70), but . . . it is midday, and Falk's guests are about to arrive. Ernst is growing accustomed to such cliffhangers. The anticipated guests and the meal promise Ernst a "doppelte Saittigung" (70). This moment of doubling is a critical point in the development of the text. Ernst, by learning to defer, has discovered both the literal and figurative capacity of language. He has acquired a taste for explanation by exemplification. The fifth dialogue opens with the relief that the guests, presumably un- acknowledged brothers, are gone. The fourth dialogue focused on the flaws of the freemasons, and seems to have invoked their presence at the table. Early in the dia- logue about the political role of freemasonry, Lessing collapses the natural and artificial source of light to conflate symbol and sign: 22 Lessing's Theory ofLanguage</page><page sequence="7">Sei ohne Sorge, der Freimfiurer erwartet ruhig den Aufgang der Sonne, und laesst die Lichter brennen, so lange sie wollen und k6nnen-Die Lichter ausl6schen und, wenn sie ausgel6scht sind, erst wahrnehmen, daB man die Stiimpfe doch wieder anzUden, oder wohl gar andre Lichter wiederaufstecken muB; das ist des Frei- maiurers Sache nicht (70-71) This summary figure describes and defines the role of freemasonry within society. The freemason awaits the rising sun, and allows individual lights to burn and burn out. He marks the passage of time and luminaries, but plays no active role in rekindling the flames, presumably those of referential politics. Freemasonry re- mains in an apolitical sphere, but its very existence implies a critique of the politi- cal system whose ills it corrects. In this summary figure of light, Lessing combines both the sign and the symbol to define the ideal role of freemasonry in society. The natural source of light serves as a model for artificial, even reflecting flames. Here Lessing stresses the independence of the symbol from the sign, and the dependence of the sign, derivative of the symbol. In its theoretical state, ulti- mately an impossible condition, freemasonry enjoys a natural relationship to its host. Once Falk has made this point, he turns to the history of freemasonry, the roots of the secret cult, and the tone of the dialogue shifts. Freemasonry in its various forms can be recognized in symbols, which must be interpreted. Falk offers an etymological explanation of the word mason itself, derived, he insists, from the word meaning "table," in order to establish a connection to the Round Table complete with associations of brotherhood, strength, and good-will, all of which is potentially and inevitably corruptible. Equally significant is the reference to the symbolic function of a common practice: sitting at a round table where no one knight outranks the other. Even more important than the content is the gesture of this form of argumentation in Falk's strategy. The true meaning lies in the his- tory of the word, and the visual signs. Ernst asks, "Und was hindert, diese Tradi- tion endlich einmal durch schriftliche Verzeichnung zur Geschichte zu erheben?" (76). It is time to tell the truth. In response, Falk recounts the history of Christo- pher Wren, architect of the St. Paul Church, and founder of freemasonry as we may or may not know it. The important point is the degradation of the word from its origins to it misinterpreted incarnation. "Die wahre Bedeutung," says Falk, "des Wortes Masoney war bei dem englischen Volke vergessen, ver- loren-" (77). The accident of freemasonry, the arbitrary origin, is about to be revealed. The truth seems to lie in the history of the word. Wren, explains Falk, had a plan for a society of sciences whose truths would assist society in general. Suddenly the opposite model occurred to him, which would raise the practices of bourgeois life to the level of speculation. The useful in truth and the truth in use would be explored-in other words, the interplay between theory and practice. And what would it be like, thought Wren, to make these principles exoteric: in- scribe them in hieroglyphs and symbols, and in those of masonry. The symbols Patricia Anne Simpson 23</page><page sequence="8">convey no specific meaning: they are rather the generalizations of the problem of meaning itself. They symbolize the possibility of signification. At this moment, Ernst is blinded by enlightenment. Falk blames his faulty memory for some inaccuracies, and suggests that Ernst take to the books. At this moment of realization, the sun goes down. Ernst says: "Eine andre ging mir auf" (78). The ultimate reference to light returns the dialogues to the realm of the symbol. This account is somewhat spurious. Significant in this context is the reference to language - the uncertainty of translation, the process of degradation, the lin- guistic accidents from which we deftly and dumbly discern meaning. Lessing leaves us with the realization that language has the power both to make and make up meaning. The priority he accords the symbol anticipates Romanticism and Hegel's theory of art, which informs his theory of state.8 For the symbol, accord- ing to Hegel, assumes a natural, motivated relationship between the idea and its sensual appearance, between form and content. Tragedy, for Hegel, constitutes the genre in which ethical substance and symbolic action are fused: the medium is the stage, which assumes a civic responsibility for the performance of exemplary action. Hegel insists on the relationship between the subject in art and the subject in the state. The stage becomes a locus for mimetic activity which, in turn, sets an example. The imitation is motivated, just as freemasonry, in Lessing's Gesprdche, sets an example for model behavior for the individual in the state.9 Lessing's Ernst und Falk does not finally decide the importance of freemasonry; nor does it reveal the true truths. The dialogues point to the relationship between aesthetic and ethical discourse. We read Lessing testing the limits of language: to posit, to negate; to make models of society, of the state; to persuade and dissuade. Moreover, the Gesprdche thematize the capacity of language to tell secrets and truths, even if the truth can only be known as a secret. University of Michigan/Ann Arbor Notes 1.
