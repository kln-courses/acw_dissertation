<plain_text><page sequence="1">HOMEOSTASIS, NEED REDUCTION, AND MOTIVATION1 Ross Stagner Wayne State University Max F. Meyer once wrote an article entitled "That Whale among the Fishes—the Theory of Emotion." At times, I have been tempted to para phrase him and call this paper "That Whale among the Fishes—the Theory of Motivation." Like Captain Ahab with Moby Dick, one can become fascinated by the impressive problems of motivation theory, and if not destroyed by them, at least one takes a severe drubbing. Today psychologists generally agree that the task of motivation theory is to explain the energizing of activity. The concept of instinct, with its incorporation of an innately determined action pattern, has largely dis appeared; and the new instinct theorists, such as Cattell (10) and Mas low (23), have confined themselves to the problem of arousal and mainte nance of behavior. Motivation is involved, of course, in the question of how behavior is directed, but here again psychologists seem to agree on the desirability of distinguishing between cue functions and reinforcement functions. I am therefore simplifying my task somewhat by confining my analysis to the conceptualization of energetics: an examination of certain logical aspects of need theory, drive theory, and homeostatic theory. It would be possible, but not fruitful, to consider the history of motiva tional theories. I am going to refer to Young's book, Motivation of Be havior (35), which does this job capably, and ignore these historical ques tions. In the same way I propose to avoid the problem of the neurological basis of motivation. This is a field that is rapidly changing. Hebb (19), for example, has recently told of how he had to revise his conception of drives from the 1930 model nervous system to keep in contact with the 1954 model. In any event, what we need at this moment is better concep tualization rather than more physiological theorizing. The new findings from brain stimulation are exciting, but, instead of clarifying the theo retical issues, they have merely made matters more confusing. The current saying is: "If you do not think matters are confused, you are just unin formed." Certainly this has some applicability to motivation theory. I am not so optimistic as to believe that I can offer a theory to end all theories in this area; and indeed, I do not propose to offer any ideas which 1 Presidential Address, Midwestern Psychological Association, St. Louis, Missouri, April 29, 1960.</page><page sequence="2">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY can properly be labeled "original," although the pattern in which they are placed may perhaps help some of you to see common elements where previously everything appeared to be in conflict. Perhaps I can venture to say that I come as a peacemaker, trying to establish a logically defensible harmonization of disagreements. This is not likely to be effective; it is the familiar fate of the peacemaker to be shot at from all sides. My approach to the multiple problems suggested by my title is, first, to consider how we go about identifying and labeling psychological con structs, and, second, to examine the problem of merging constructs derived from different defining operations. I assume that we are all agreed that a psychological construct is ar rived at inductively, i.e., as the precipitate of a common element from a series of observations (Figure 1). Thus the construct, drive, finds its origin Fig. 1. The concept of drive as the common element in a series of events. in a series of observations of organisms in which energy has been mobil ized (14). The common language gives these specific events a diversity of names, such as hunger, thirst, sex, and pain, but the scientist notes that there are certain attributes in common among these instances: close re lation to physiological mechanisms, major determination by hereditary influence, universal (or virtually universal) appearance in the animal king dom, effects on behavior, and so on.</page><page sequence="3">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation In defining a construct, however, it becomes incumbent upon the theo rist to use reduction sentences, i.e., to state the necessary and sufficient attributes of an observation which determine our assigning it to the class of this construct. Thus we might say, "If the organism has been deprived of food for 24 hours, a hunger drive is operating if, and only if, an increase in behavioral activity occurs." By custom, reduction sentences are nor mally anchored to both the stimulus and the response side of such an intervening variable. In this sense all psychological constructs are response inferred. If we are fortunate, we identify stimulus conditions which have a very high probability of eliciting the anchoring response, and in such a case the scientist may claim that he has defined his construct in terms of antecedent variables only. The problems created by attempting to use exclusively an antecedent variable definition can be well illustrated by the fate of Hull's construct of deprivation (21). In this case Hull sought to define a dynamic variable (the energy mobilized by the organism in a task situation) by reducing it to an antecedent condition (hours of deprivation of some needed sub stance) which was symbolized by the letter H. Unfortunately, as the ex perimental literature shows, H does not give an adequate representation of this phenomenon. The organism's normal eating cycle, for example, inter feres with the manifestation of a monotonie effect of hours of deprivation. Hull deserves a great deal of credit, of course, for boldly attempting to offer operational definitions for concepts which all too often have been lacking in clarity. I sometimes think, however, that his great prestige has made him a kind of modern-day Aristotle; you will recall that, for over a thousand years, scholars preferred to believe Aristotle's statements rather than accept the evidence of their own observations. One occasionally won ders if such a danger exists among the Hullians! Along with operationism there are other considerations which affect the value of a scientific construct. One, of course, is generality or inclu siveness. Why was Newton's formulation of the principle of gravitation so widely acclaimed? Because he embraced, within a unitary concept, so many diverse instances: The mutual attraction of masses covered the falling of the apple, the tides, planetary motion, and perhaps even molecular phe nomena. Instead of independent concepts for each category of observa tion, Newton offered a single, all-inclusive concept. Related, but not necessarily identical, is the criterion of parsimony. We should attempt to devise concepts which require a minimum of unverified assumptions. Generally speaking, particularistic constructs such as Hull's deprivation require fewer assumptions than widely inclusive constructs such as Freud's concept of instinct. Obviously we shall seek for an optimum balance between the highly molecular, or atomistic, constructs which re quire few assumptions but also include few observations, and the molar, global constructs which incorporate a wide range of data but at consider able cost in precision.</page><page sequence="4">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY These are some of the guidelines I laid down for myself when begin ning to explore the concepts of homeostasis, need reduction, and motiva tion. It seemed to me that a logical exploration of these constructs might help to clarify my own ideas and hopefully might lead to greater mutual understanding, if not actual agreement, among proponents of diverse views of motivation. MOTIVATION The problems of defining a motivational state have been thoughtfully explored by Ritchie (28). He points out, for example, that you can lead a horse to water but you can't make him drink; or in more formal ter minology, that if X is presented with water, X is thirsty if and only if X drinks. This is a concession to the obvious fact that motivational states are not controllable with precision by external manipulations and that the ex istence of the state is demonstrated conclusively by the occurrence of the expected consummatory response. This means—as I think most psychol ogists now agree—that drive states are response-inferred, not stimulus inferred. An act provides evidence of motivation by its energy level, per sistence, and variability if blocked. I would further agree with Ritchie that many of our problems in the field of motivation have arisen because we have failed to treat drive as a dispositional attribute. Ritchie comments that we do not ask if solubility is somewhere inside the lump of sugar. Solubility is simply an attribute of sugar. In the same way, he suggests, drive or motivation can be treated as an attribute of behavior rather than as a dynamo concealed somewhere within the organism. Instead of asking, "How can we observe a drive?" our problem becomes one of ascertaining the conditions under which be havior shows the attributes which are agreed upon as identifying drive (14). The fallacy of assuming that drive could somehow be identified if we had suitable methods may be called reification; this phenomenon is well known to philosophers who argue about whether ideas have real existence independent of the concrete instances from which they are inductively de rived. Reification, I think, accounts for the popularity of the instinct theory of fifty years ago. It was easy to think of an inborn pattern of some kind which guided and energized behavior. Observing mating behavior, the scientist felt impelled to hypothesize a mating instinct. I shall propose instead that we deal only with attributes which can be abstracted from such observations, without implying that there is some kind of underlying reality which could be labeled an instinct. NEED REDUCTION A step in this direction was taken when the early behaviorists replaced instinct theory with the theory of need reduction. Activity in certain peripheral organs could be correlated with energizing of behavior and like</page><page sequence="5">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation wise with a deficit of substances essential for survival. This gave rise to the concept of need as the generalized condition of energetic arousal. In its most sophisticated form, need-reduction theory is associated with the name of Clark L. Hull. In his Principles of Behavior, Hull defined a pri mary need as follows: "When any of the commodities or conditions neces sary for individual or species survival are lacking, or when they deviate materially from the optimum, a state of primary need is said to exist" (21, p. 17). Further, he considered that such need states give rise to a volley of stimulation, and that primary reinforcement could be defined in terms of the "diminution in the receptor discharge of a need" (21, p. 80). The theory is thus variably called a need-reduction theory or a drive reduction theory. Dollard and Miller went somewhat further than Hull in identifying drive and drive stimuli. They said: "Strong stimuli which impel action are drives. Any stimulus can become a drive if it is made strong enough." And they also proposed that "hunger can be defined objectively in terms of the effects of food deprivation" (13, p. 30). The need-reduction theory grows out of a solid Darwinian tradition. It is typical of the American functionalist approach; and it is very close to the implicit theory of the man-in-the-street who must necessarily have a theory of motivation regardless of his failure to verbalize it. Hull's theory is, of course, a long distance from the naïve notion that "naturally, need compels man to put forth effort." I have already referred to Hull's effort to define deprivation operationally, and to the concept of drive stimuli. This definition represented a substantial advance because it put drive into a conceptual formulation in which it could plausibly inter act with a sensorimotor process such as a habit. According to this view, need, a biological state, affects receptor cells and initiates drive stimuli which energize and maintain activity until the needed substance, a rein forcer, is attained. The reduction in drive stimuli is conceived to be the effective agent insofar as reinforcement of habits is concerned. The advantages of this kind of theorizing about motives are obvious. While the Darwinian arguments based on survival value are maintained, the drive stimuli provide a device by which the need affects the sensori motor mechanism. The stress on peripheral mechanisms was in conformity with the behaviorism of the 1930's. Empirical data on stomach contrac tions, on the dryness of the mouth in thirst, and similar phenomena seemed at the time to support this kind of theory. The troubles of motivational theory based upon needs are many. Let us note some of the more important. First, there is an unknown number of needs, defined as substances essential to the continued existence or efficient functioning of protoplasm. We know that there are many needs which are silent, i.e., do not elicit drive stimuli. Second, there are many situations in which the operationally defined attributes of motivation—i.e.,</page><page sequence="6">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY increased activity, persistence, energy mobilization—appear, and in which no such need can be identified. Some simple examples of this type have been stressed by Young (36) in his hedonic theory of motivation. The organism may be incited to action by, and show reinforcement effects consequent upon, stimuli which are clearly not need-reducing (27). Third, the peripheral organs involved in a need (e.g., the stomach) may be re moved and the motivational effect of deprivation is still evident. In ad dition to these weaknesses, we know that efforts to define drive strength operationally in terms of hours of deprivation have failed. And finally, there are many instances in which the presumed reduction in drive stimuli does not occur, and yet reinforcing effects are observable. These instances in clude the familiar class of behaviors in which organisms seek an increase in stimulation as opposed to a decrease; in human beings we describe these as cases in which the organism shows reinforcement effects consequent upon contacting a sign of drive reduction as contrasted with reduction in a biological sense. For example, Sheffield et al. (30) found that allowing a male rat to mount a female, even though copulation was not completed, served as a reinforcer. On an anthropomorphic basis we might assume that this increased rather than decreased tension; but on an expectancy basis we could argue that approaching the goal has some reinforcing value (3). In Lewin's terminology, entering the goal region may be a reinforcing event. Drive-reduction theory has been ably defended by Brown (8), who offers an interpretation of pleasure-seeking behavior (which manifestly does not fit the theory as to the reduction of drive stimuli ). Brown points out that, if the habit strength of an ongoing response is high, so that com peting responses are not raised above threshold value, an increase in drive strength may simply energize the response, not end it in favor of an alternative. There is little doubt in my mind that Brown's arguments are valid for certain situations. I feel equally certain that there are situations in which Brown's arguments are unsatisfactory. My purpose is neither to praise need-reduction theory nor to bury it, but to ask whether a broader con ceptualization can save what is useful in the theory without running into some of these problems. Perhaps the most significant statement in Brown's paper is the fol lowing: "Drive level, defined either in terms of deprivation time or stimu lation conditions, can be maximally useful only if additional data about an organism's previous experience, momentary states, and responses are taken into consideration" (8, pp. 176-177). Essentially this is what critics of drive theory had been saying for some time. The concepts of drive and drive stimuli can be useful, but they must be used in a theoretical frame work which takes the rest of the organism into consideration. They cannot be defined in independent, physicalistic terms as Hull sought to do.</page><page sequence="7">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation Essentially, this admission by Brown amounts to rejection of the molecu lar, peripheralist conception of drive which has annoyed so many psy chologists. It does not amount to accepting the rather mystical, animistic formulations which have been propounded by some of the so-called holistic psychologists. It does seem to invite a reformulation of the problem in terms which attempt to take the total organism into consideration. Specifically, let us ask ourselves: What are the "additional data about an organism's previous experience, momentary states, and responses" to which Brown refers? Must we simply list these, or can we fit them into a conceptual framework? Essentially, what I wish to argue is that we can devise a framework which incorporates the valuable features of need-reduc tion theory and also the corrective factors to which Brown has referred. I suggest that homeostatic theory can cope adequately with the prob lems cited above, and that it is not in contradiction to drive theory. I shall argue that drive reduction is a special case of homeostasis, and that the detailed machinery devised by Hull and others for this purpose, e.g., the role of drive stimuli, is usable in homeostatic theory too. In other words, I believe that a somewhat broader framework can capitalize on the ad vantages of the drive-reduction view without encountering some of its problems. HOMEOSTASIS Let me begin by saying a few things about the concept of homeostasis as I employ it. Homeostasis appeals to me because it is inclusive and cuts across various levels of observation (31). But by this same token it tends to require more unverified assumptions than more particularistic approaches to motivational phenomena. The concept first acquired prevalence in psy chology when it was pointed out by Cannon (9) that organisms show a variety of steady states, and that disturbance of such a steady state tends very often to be followed by action which restores the prior state. This seems to provide a substitute for the concept of need, avoiding as it does the questions of whether only needs are energizing, and of whether all needs are energizing. Other problems have arisen, of course, with the meaning of homeostasis. Some psychologists have reified homeostasis, treating it as a force like the Freudian libido. This usage I reject. Homeostasis is only a concept, abstracted from numerous instances in behavior which illustrate restoration of equilibrium (32). It is a principle like gravitation; nobody says gravita tion causes an object to fall, but falling objects illustrate gravitation. Other writers have identified homeostasis with the response mechanism itself (12). I would likewise reject this view. There are some important implications for motivation theory, however, which can be developed by examining the question of homeostatic response mechanisms.</page><page sequence="8">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY The simplest homeostatic mechanism would appear to be that of the buffering systems in the blood stream. For example the pH of the blood— the acid-alkali balance—is held remarkably close to a uniform value. Devia tions to either side are countered by substances in the blood stream which bind in a nonionized form the excess material. This kind of equilibrium maintenance, however, is of limited utility unless the organism has a second line of defense upon which to fall back if the deviation exceeds the capacity of the buffering mechanism. As we shall see, the more complex levels of homeostatic process are characterized by multiple thresholds and by successive mechanisms which are brought into action as each threshold value is exceeded. We can illustrate this notion of multiple thresholds most readily by reference to the problem of temperature control. Body temperature of warm-blooded animals tends to vary only within a narrow range; for man, the mean is close to 98.6° F. There is, however, a range of variation for each individual around his own mean. We may label the limits of this normal variation as an upper and a lower threshold. Should environmental variations cause an increase in body temperature which exceeds the upper threshold, certain restorative processes are triggered. First are certain changes mediated by the autonomic nervous system. The peripheral blood vessels relax, allowing more heat to be lost to the air; and the sweat glands excrete moisture, further cooling the skin. Finally, the normal tem perature is restored and the mechanism shuts off. If homeostasis amounted to no more than this, it would have no interest to psychologists. We become intrigued, however, when we learn that persistence of heightened body temperature activates a new set of mechan isms. These include hormonal effects to reduce heat production by metabolism (e.g., pituitary thyrotropin diminishes, slowing thyroid hormone production) and other bodily changes. If the temperature still persists beyond the upper threshold, the animal moves restlessly about until a cooler environment is located. I have represented these relationships in Figure 2 by a succession of thresholds. If the internal body temperature rises above the threshold value labeled A, one mechanism is activated; should it continue to rise, exceeding value B, another mechanism or set of processes comes into action; and should it exceed value C, a third or voluntary homeostatic response is triggered. (I assume it is clear that I am not postulating three such thresholds for every state but only developing the notion of a succes sion or hierarchy of threshold values.) I also am assuming that the succes sive mechanisms may be triggered by a time threshold as well as by an absolute temperature threshold. This analysis enables us to clarify certain issues and to deal with certain critics of homeostatic theory. In a recent article Maze (24) made the very good point that the concept of homeostasis should not be</page><page sequence="9">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation treated as a disembodied force. However, he also proposed that homeo stasis should be restricted to those instances in which a specific physio logical structure mediated a specific process of restoring a specific steady state. To do otherwise, he argued, was mystical. But it is apparent even from the examination of this simple instance of temperature control that we must not limit ourselves to a specific physiological structure nor to a Upper threshold -C -Β -A Lower threshold -A -B -C Fig. 2. Multiple thresholds for corrective actions to restore essential steady state. specific response process. In the first place, the persisting disturbance of equilibrium can activate successive levels of neural integration. While we are not sure as to the exact nuclei involved in some of these regulatory processes, it is certain that failure to achieve equilibrium by a simple re flex mechanism leads to activation of centers controlling more widespread response systems. Secondly, failure of these second-line restorative mechan isms is followed by activation of skeletal muscles and "voluntary" move ments. Unless we wish to ignore completely the spread of reflex response from the first simple mechanisms to the more complex systems and the ulti mate involvement of the voluntary system, we cannot accept Maze's limita tion of a specific structure or a specific process. The continuity of a homeostatic mechanism must be defined in terms of the continuity of the disequilibrium, not in terms of a specific nerve nucleus or response mechanism (32). The construct, then, must be molar rather than molecular. Potentially, if not in every instance, it involves the total organism. I would therefore propose a reduction sentence for a homeostatic mechanism as follows: If a bodily steady state is disturbed by more than a determinable threshold value, then a homeostatic mechanism is</page><page sequence="10">MERE π J -PALMER QUARTERLY activated if, and only if, persistence of the disturbance leads to involve ment of additional response systems. I am sure that my purpose here is clear. The definition proposed draws a clear-cut distinction between simple reflexes and complex motivational phenomena. If the organism had no resources, other than the vascular mechanism, for dealing with heightened temperature and similar deviations, homeostasis would still be a useful concept for physiologists, but it would have little bearing on psychology. The diagram shown in Figure 2 offers another clue to an important point about homeostatic action. It is necessary to postulate that every disturbance of a steady state is communicated to some control center. I have no desire to get off into neurological speculation. What I do wish to suggest is that this concept of an information input, be it through receptors as we usually understand them or be it through direct biochemical in fluence upon the anterior pituitary or upon nerve centers, provides a link to Hull's concept of drive stimuli. Clearly, in the example of temperature, a heightened temperature can be conceived of as a drive stimulus in a rather direct sense. Even a lowered temperature can be thought of as a drive stimulus, since we phenomenally experience cold as qualitatively different from heat. Suppose, on the other hand, we consider a steady state such as the sodium-potassium balance, the oxygen-carbon dioxide equilibrium, or the concentration of vitamin B. These are normally "silent" disturbances since they do not give rise to consciously experienced disequilibrium. On the other hand, it is well established that these and other similar disturb ances can function as motives for experimental laboratory situations and probably also have motivational significance in daily life. The concept of a control center, therefore, which is sensitive to threshold changes in these steady states and which exerts dynamogenic effects on response mechan isms, seems to be necessary. The problems which arise from identifying drive with drive stimuli can thereby be avoided. With Morgan (25), I propose to refer to the drive state by the initials "c.m.s.," meaning a central motive state. The c.m.s. is not the same as the inflow of afferent impulses from stomach, viscera or vascular mechanisms, although it is related in an orderly fashion to these afferent impulses.2 This amounts to little more than the familiar observation that the conscious threshold for stimulation is considerably higher than the absolute 2 The question has been raised: Can we measure the "level of arousal" of the c.m.s.? My answer is in line with that given by Ritchie (28); c.m.s. is a hypothetical construct which is inferred from certain inputs and certain outputs of the organism. "Level of arousal" may then be correlated with the nature of the external situation and with bodily responses, fantasies, interference with ongoing patterns, etc. If it be argued that this is circular logic, I would note that a reinforcer is defined as an event which reinforces; in other words, circular definitions may be useful even if not logically elegant.</page><page sequence="11">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation threshold or the threshold under special instructions. The drive state is not always or even necessarily conscious; Freud has taught us that many dynamic processes are not. The concept of multiple thresholds is a familiar one which seems to bring order into this particular chaotic situation. Obviously these thresholds may vary substantially for different steady states and different kinds of input. It is perfectly possible that some "needs" will prove fatal to the organism before they activate the central drive state. The danger from nuclear fall-out is a case in point; man lacks an information mechanism for warning him of such threats, and he seems to lack the intelligence to take precautionary measures in the absence of such physical stimulation. Maslow (23) has stressed a similar notion with his concept of basic needs. He argues that these are innately determined, but some are—he alleges—so weak that they may never dominate the response mechanism. If the person is constantly busy just satisfying survival needs, his wish for affection or for sensory experience may never attain expression. These needs are silent, and the person is not aware of lacking anything essen tial; yet, his personality may show damage from this frustration. I am not prepared to argue about the nature of the information input which activates the c.m.s. in the case of these silent steady states. I only want to emphasize the importance of building our motivational theory around the central concept of arousal, rather than around the peripheral concept of drive stimuli. RESTATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM A number of psychologists have preceded me in proposing that we combine homeostatic theory and drive theory. Seward says, "by drive I mean an excitatory state produced by a homeostatic disturbance" (29, p. 195). And Bindra (6) repeatedly refers to drive stimuli as impulses aris ing from homeostatic imbalances. It should be easy to reach agreement that the need-reduction theory and homeostatic theory are, at least in some areas, verbal equivalents. Can we combine them in such a way as to cover the whole field of motivation? Figure 3 represents diagrammatically the common usage of need reduc tion, homeostasis, and motivation. Homeostasis is frequently used to in clude the very simple biochemical phenomena such as buffering, to which I have already referred. We are not sure that these phenomena have any motivational significance, and so I have represented them as not over lapping either need reduction or motivation. Then we have a broad range of phenomena which are commonly labeled need-reducing, or homeostatic, or motivating, more or less indifferently. These phenomena would include hunger, thirst, pain, and similar events. It is the phenomena at the right-hand end of the diagram which cause us the most difficulty. Among these are behavior (3) based on sex, affective</page><page sequence="12">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY preference, exploratory need, manipulative need, and the complex goal seeking behavior associated with personality and clinical studies. Can homeostatic theory handle these, and if so, how? Need Reduction Homeostasis Motivation Fig. 3. Overlapping phenomena commonly labeled need reduction, homeostasis, and motivation. I assume that I need not spend much time on the fact that these be haviors cause excruciating difficulties for a need-reduction theory. Hebb (18) has done a thorough job of demolishing the notion that sex drive can be treated as need reduction. Harlow (16) has done equally well in demonstrating the motivational effects of sensory exploration and manipu lation of the environment. The problems of dealing with ambitions and aspirations, religious values and political ideologies, are familiar to us all. I have adopted a kind of compromise position in the diagram and shown homeostasis as embracing most but not all of motivation. Actually, I intend to argue that it can be extended to cover the entire range of moti vational process, but the diagram represents common usage rather than my own picture of the situation. Before facing the problems of the behaviors to be assigned to the right-hand end of the diagram, let me note why I prefer homeostatic theory as the way of conceptualizing the center of this range of observa tions. I have already identified the two major considerations involved: inclusiveness and parsimony. Homeostasis is particularly well adapted to include a variety of phe nomena. It applies to events ranging from the acid-base balance in the blood to phenomena of food-seeking behavior, house-building, air condi tioning, and so on (31). As to parsimony, I think it is clear that we need to make several assumptions, but I believe all of these are essential like wise to need reductionists: (a) homeostatic imbalance gives rise to in formation input, which may be hormonal or neural; (b) a central control mechanism receives this information and is activated thereby; (c) this mechanism has multiple thresholds, triggering successively more extensive response mechanisms; (d) behavior shows the attribute we call motivated, so long as this mechanism is activated. The main difference between my view and both drive theory and earlier homeostatic theory, therefore, is my emphasis on a central moti</page><page sequence="13">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation vating mechanism. This is the common center to which all kinds of needs, hunger, thirst, etc., and all kinds of disturbances which do not meet the definition of need, such as sex, sensory deprivation, and the like, are connected. Informational inputs, neural or hormonal, activate this center. The center's activity energizes behavior and modifies perception (19). As already noted, this concept is borrowed from Morgan (25) who labeled it c.m.s. It seems to me that we are forced to postulate some such mechanism in order to face up to the data. Various other authors have accepted the c.m.s. concept in one form or another. Brown (7) and Färber (15), for example, seem to have abandoned drive stimuli in favor of a central state as the essential mechanism of energizing and reinforcing behavior. Seward (29) throws out rather casually the notion of a non specific goal tension as an intervening construct between the stimulus and motivated behavior. This seems equivalent to Morgan's c.m.s. Hebb, of course, endorses the idea of a central motive state, and a similar view is expressed by Murphy (26). "Motives," he writes, "are assigned to regions of high tension, or unstable equilibrium, inside the body." He feels, however, that it is not feasible to select certain orgaii systems and identify these as the sources of motivation. "All tissues are rather un stable," he comments. "All points in the body are at all times the site of chemical reaction, of energy changes, that pass, gradient-wise, in many directions. The nervous system is no mere connection system; it is itself the site of many tensions" (26, p. 88). The necessity of assuming a c.m.s., instead of stressing the feedback from peripheral states as the essence of drive, may be supported by a number of lines of evidence. Berkun, Kessen, and Miller (4) fed animals through a stomach fistula, or conversely, allowed sham feeding which did not get food into the stomach. Greater reinforcing effects were obtained by the latter procedure than by inserting food into the stomach. Clearly, neither the ending of a need state nor the restoration of glucose balance in the bloodstream is occurring here. I suggest that the c.m.s. is aroused by the homeostatic disturbance but is reduced by feedback from the consummatory response (eating), not by the restoration of glucose equi librium (27). (In the long run, of course, equilibrium restoration is essen tial to prevent rapid rearousal.) Similarly, Adolph (1) demonstrated that dogs will drink an amount approximately equal to that required to restore the water balance, even though the water is not reaching the animal's stomach. Here again it ap pears that the control—of satiation at least—depends on feedback from the consummatory response canceling some central state of activation. Evidence critical of the need-reduction view, but compatible with the view outlined above, is that of Sheffield, Wulff, and Backer (30), who found that the sex drive could be used to motivate and reinforce behavior in male rats; the animals were simply allowed to mount receptive females but not to reach orgasm. In such cases, it would seem that an increase in</page><page sequence="14">MERBILL-FALMER QUARTERLY drive stimuli would result, but reinforcement was nevertheless demonstrated. I would argue that some stimuli are innately capable of disrupting a central equilibrium—just as pain can—and that this activates the c.m.s. Certainly we all know that the appearance of an attractive sex object can disturb equilibrium and energize behavior. In the case of the Sheffield example, and the observations reported by Young (36), I would argue that "attrac tive" or "palatable" stimuli can alternatively activate and reduce the c.m.s. irrespective of any need-reducing function (27). Appearance of the attrac tive object arouses tension; contact with it reduces the c.m.s. Whether all of these stimuli have innate connections to the central arousal mechanism or whether some prior learning is necessary, I do not pretend to know. Harlow's work on infant monkeys (17) suggests that some kinds of in formation input have an innate value in reducing motivational arousal. How can we deal with the phenomena of exploratory drive, mani pulatory drive, etc., which have been pointed out as obstacles to either a need-reduction or a homeostatic theory? Need reductionists can, of course, postulate an innate need for stimulation, but this gets into difficulties, especially with the fact that high intensity stimuli have negative rather than positive incentive value. On the other hand, it is clear from the work of Bexton, Heron, and Scott (5) on sensory deprivation that a sharp reduc tion in the normal level of exteroceptive stimulation has decided arousal value. To handle this question I would have recourse to the concept of optimal level of stimulation, as suggested by Hebb (18) and formally stated by Leuba (22). I suggest that such a central equilibrium can function in the same way as other steady states, and that disturbance of this level can activate the c.m.s. A relevant consideration is Helson's concept of adaptation level (20), but in the context of motivation rather than perception (although the arbitrary boundary between these two ought to be erased). Infants vary at birth in the amount of stimulation they seem to prefer, and there is substantial evidence (11) that the kind of mothering they get may deter mine the preferred level in later childhood. It seems entirely plausible that a deviation from this level of stimulation, either toward sensory depriva tion or toward intense afferent arousal, may activate the c.m.s. In this case, satiation, or drive reduction, is accomplished purely and simply by restoration of the preferred level of stimulation. It is further appropriate to consider here the phenomenon of stimulus expectancy and the extent to which equilibrium is disturbed simply by the failure of an expected event to occur. Seward (29) has proposed the term tertiary drive, which seems to mean only that an act set in motion has a tendency toward completion. Blockage of the act induces arousal. ( Compare Lewin's concept of the effect of barriers on valence and tension. ) Seward's tertiary drive does not seem to be an appropriate term, but it is clear that blockage of an anticipated act or stimulus has arousal value.</page><page sequence="15">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation It appears, then, that an equilibrium concept is more useful here than a need concept. Let us move from this to another kind of behavior which has often been presented as negating the homeostatic conception of motivation. Allport (2) is fond of citing the explorer who leaves his home and family, physical comforts and devices for protecting his body equilibria, to enter conditions of pain, discomfort, and possible death. I would reply that the explorer's equilibrium is disturbed by sitting around home, that this situation is discrepant with his self-image, and that he can restore equilib rium only by engaging in the activity he perceives as appropriate to himself. In a sense this is an extension of the adaptation-level argument; presumably the explorer has built up, over a period of time, the percept of himself as the kind of person who goes adventuring. Failure to act in this manner is disturbing, just as the retired businessman is upset by being cut off from his accustomed activities. Let us consider briefly another facet of the explorer problem. Allport asks how the proponent of homeostatic theory can explain an action which threatens acute disruption of many important steady states. The answer to this, of course, is that almost every action threatens to disrupt some equilibrium. Davis (12) has coined the term heterostasis to refer to the fact that any homeostatic action may disrupt some other stable function. Consider the temperature problem; perspiring may disrupt the water balance or the salt balance. Homeostatic action to keep body tempera ture down sets off a thirst drive. Heterostasis implies that the body has a hierarchy of steady states, and that those in the upper ranges are preserved even at the cost of disruption of one or more in the lower levels. Such a concept is of course essential to any theory of motivation, holistic or molecular. Maslow (23) has pro pounded the notion of a hierarchy of needs, one of which dominates behavior until it is satisfied, after which the one next in the hierarchy takes over. Maslow does not suggest by what mechanism this is accom plished. The concept of a hierarchy of thresholds capable of triggering a central arousal mechanism seems to be one workable approach to this problem. It seems reasonably certain that one kind of hierarchy of steady states is built into the organism, i.e., hereditary. Warden (33) used an indirect method of demonstrating such a hierarchy with his obstruction box. The choice technique, as used in Young's preference studies (36) or in those pitting hunger against thirst, gets more directly at relative standing in the hierarchy. I conceive of this mechanism as being basically like the principle of the final common path, namely, that there is a gating mechan ism which permits one and only one activating mechanism to function at a given moment. According to this view, the steady state, disturbance of which elicited the most intense c.m.s., would dominate the final common</page><page sequence="16">MERRILL-PALMER QUARTERLY path, and action would be undertaken to reduce this c.m.s. In accordance with the notion of heterostasis, we would expect that steady states lower in the hierarchy might be disturbed; as soon as the dominant one has been reduced, the one next in the series takes over and controls behavior. White (34) has objected to this kind of description of behavior as moving through a series of "episodes of homeostatic crisis." While registering disapproval of the word crisis, which implies a higher peak of motivational arousal than is common, I would argue that ordinary behavior is characterized precisely by serial episodes of homeostatic adaptation. White, of course, was criticizing the notion that all behavior is based on biogenic drives—hunger, thirst, pain, and sex; he might find less fault with the more flexible concept I have built around the term homeostasis. The importance of a hierarchy of steady states can be illustrated by reference to an article by Brown (8). Brown's favorite illustration is that of a man learning to drink straight whiskey. He argues that, because ingestion of alcohol is regularly followed by reduction of various drives, there is no contradiction for drive-reduction theory in this situation. Yet he admits that "straight whiskey, when first ingested, typically elicits rather violent defense reactions" (8, p. 173). Since the drive reduction to which he refers may occur late in the training series, not on the first or even the fifth occurrence of such drinking, it is hard to see how this is plausible. Brown has not asked what motive impels the drinking in the first few trials. A little observation would have indicated that other energizing stimuli, for example, questions about the masculinity of the novice, are involved here. It is not suiBcient, in other words, to rely upon a hierarchy of established responses and upon the notion that a high dominance response, once activated, will persist in the face of aversive stimuli. How did this response attain its dominant status? What kind of reinforcement operates to main tain responses in the face of nausea and hangovers? We know observa tionally that for most men masculinity is a major goal and that implied lack of masculinity is a major disturbance to equilibrium. This, it seems to me, makes much better sense than holding that the person will somehow keep drinking until he learns that alcohol provides favorable as well as disturbing consequences. Before closing, I would like to note that the concept of the c.m.s. seems to me useful in dealing with personality and clinical phenomena such as substitute gratification. If each biological drive had its own unique tension, we could hardly explain such cases as eating to relieve anxiety (or to fulfill a need for affection), or sexual behavior motivated by security needs. The postulation of a c.m.s. which is a common intervening construct for all motives makes such behavior easier to explain. Consummatory re sponses appropriate to reduction of c.m.s. in one context may have tempor ary value in cases of arousal on some other basis. I would stress the word</page><page sequence="17">Homeostasis, Need Reduction, and Motivation "temporary" here because, if the basic equilibrium is not restored, rearousal will occur shortly. This is precisely what happens, according to the clini cians. Because the substitute activity does not restore the highest ranking steady state, resdess, seeking behavior recurs within a brief interval after the reduction of tension. SUMMARY Let me briefly summarize the point of view which has been developed by the foregoing arguments. First, the terms homeostasis, need reduction, and motivation have in common a reference to the energizing and main tenance of behavior. Need reduction has been widely accepted as provid ing a useful conceptualization for dealing with the phenomena of motiva tion, but it has also encountered severe criticism. Second, homeostasis has been proposed by some authors as an alternative to need reduction, but in its early forms it has been subject to many of the same criticisms as need reduction. My intent, therefore, has been to offer a reformulation of homeostatic theory which seeks simultaneously to incorporate need reduc tion as a special case and to evade some of the criticisms affecting both ways of viewing motivation. The essential points in the reformulation are as follows: (a) Homeo stasis is not a force, but is a general term identifying the fact that most— perhaps all—motivational phenomena possess in common the attributes of disturbance and restoration of equilibrium, (b) The concept of steady state is extended to include not only the familiar phenomena of the internal biochemical states (temperature, water balance, and glucose bal ance) but also preferred levels of stimulation, adaptation level, and other perceptual phenomena such as expectancy, (c) Disturbance of any steady state results in an information input to a central mechanism. This input may be neural or hormonal. Multiple thresholds regulate the energizing effects of the disturbance, (d) Activation of the central mechanism is con ceived as a central motive state; as long as this state persists, the organism is in a condition of heightened activity. While there is an orderly rela tionship between the information input, or drive stimuli, and the c.m.s., the two must not be identified. It is likely that certain stimuli, such as pain and sexual objects, disrupt the central equilibrium and activate c.m.s. Persistence of c.m.s. corresponds to the maintenance of a high degree of arousal, regardless of the level of stimulation; and a reduction of c.m.s. corresponds to what is variously called satiation or reinforcement, regard less of the level of stimulation. Originally, c.m.s. is reduced by restoration of the steady state, but after learning, stimuli associated with such restora tion will reduce the c.m.s. prior to actual need reduction, (e) Action to restore one steady state may require disturbance of other steady states of lower hierarchical value; in other words, there exists a hierarchy of steady states. The term heterostasis refers to the fact that a high level equilibrium</page><page sequence="18">MEHR TT ,T -PALMER QUARTERLY will be protected or restored at the cost of disturbing lower level balances. These will be restored in turn, dominance of the response mechanism being determined by hierarchical value. Motivation is firmly rooted in biological attributes of the organism, but it cannot be identified with peripheral mechanisms. Homeostasis is char acterized by involvement of the total organism. The concept of need is treated as a subclass of the category of steady states, and the concept of drive stimuli is treated as a matter of information about disturbances of steady states. The nuclear concept is that of central motive state. By avoid ing the peripheral emphasis of earlier need-reduction and homeostatic theorizing, the reformulation is brought closer to the facts of the labora tory and of the clinic. In this framework, the tasks of empirical research can be stated clearly. What are the steady states, disturbance of which can lead to arousal of the c.m.s.? What is the hierarchical arrangement of these states? What external stimuli and what internal processes disturb given states? What are the modes of information input in each case? What are the most useful indices of the extent of c.m.s. arousal? What are the external and internal condi tions reducing c.m.s.? The foregoing questions are phrased in general terms. But it is obvious that differences in human personalities are related to differences in these variables. People vary in the specific steady states they protect; they vary in the extent of disturbance they can tolerate; they vary in the intensity of arousal; they vary in the kinds of stimuli which lead to satiation, grati fication, or reinforcement. Motivation is the most difficult, and the most important, area in psycho logical theorizing today. I have tried to present a way of thinking about the key problems of motivation in a fashion that may lead to more satisfac tory solutions than those now available. At the very least I hope that I have disturbed the equilibrium of anyone who is satisfied with the present situation and motivated him to re-examine the problem. REFERENCES 1. Adolph, E. F.
