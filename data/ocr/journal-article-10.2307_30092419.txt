<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE MEANING OF EVOLUTION. WHATEVER judgment may ultimately be passed on the views inaugurated by Charles Darwin, it will remain for ever true that we owe to his inspiration that wonderful quickening of science which marked the second half of the nine teenth century. Few will now admit that his work on The Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection (1859 explains the origin of species ; but it certainly ushered in a period' of enthusiastic research which has influenced every department of knowledge. Darwin introduced his simple hypothesis into the supersaturated mass of biological observations ; and at once the facts began to crystallise out in orderly array, clicking into their places, ranging themselves in har600ious sequence. Instead of being confronted by an amorphous heap of Baconian instances, men of science had now an object in working, a definite scheme to be proved or disproved. Thus, Darwinism provided the necessary psychological cue for action ; by an ideal simplification of the problem, it allowed provisional schedules into which otherwise intractable facts could be classi fied. But here, as in other branches of science, the brilliant nazvets of the pioneer-whether it be Thales, Paracelsus, Galileo, or Darwin-while fully justified by the successful re searches to which it has led, must pale before the light of completer knowledge. " When we reflect on the intricacies of genetic problems as we must now conceive them," writes Mr. Bateson,1 " there come moments when we feel almost thank.. ful that the Mendelian principles were unknown to Darwin. The time called for a bold pronouncement, and he made it, to our lasting profit and delight. With fuller knowledge we pass once more into a period of cautious expectation and reserve." It is with a feeling akin to the half-wonder and half-envy with which we watch the gambols of a child, that we recall those strenuous days when Huxley, the episcopophagist, couched his l Darwin and Modern Science (z9o9), p. g6.</page><page sequence="2">1912. The Meaning of Evolution. 33 lance against the swine of Gadara ; when workingmen stood by in awe to see Herbert Spencer, the great Conjuror, put the universe into the melting-pot ; when Tyndall, the new Lucretius, grew poetic as he discerned " Plato, Shakespeare, Newton and Raphael potential in the fires of the sun." Alas those simple days of solar myths have vanished " like streaks of morning . . . into the infinite azure of the past." Facts have sobered us, as they sobered the alchemists ; biology has burst its swathing-bands of evolutionary formuhe. " We do not know very much about evolution at all," confesses Dr. Driesch ;1 " in this field we are just at the very beginning of what deserves the name of exact knowledge." Must we then suspend our judgment and await develop ments Such a negative attitude seems neither practically possible nor specidatively necessary. Evolution is not a ques tion which concerns biologists alone, and to which the layman may remain serenely indifferent. The issues at stake cover every field of human interest, and the questions raised must be answered by every thinking man. And it is fortunate that, to a great degree, these questions can be answered by the light of those broad general conclusions which have been definitely ascertained, without reference to those minutiae and com plexities which are still the strife of specialists, or beyond the present bourne of science. In a word, the really human and philosophical import of evolution need not be sought in tech nical or microscopical details, but is to be had through a low potwer view of the whole field of inquiry. After all, it matters very little whether this or that law of evolution be correct ; what is of vital significance is the fact that there may be a law of evolution at all. It may be interesting to investigate the particular rate at which the great world is spinning down the ringing grooves of change ; but, philosophically speaking, it is far more important to discover the pre-suppositions and con sequences of the existence of any groove. Such an inquiry into the meaning of evolution can be effected only by regarding evolutionism in its context, i.e., as part of a wider mechanical view of nature. That evolution is so conceived is clearly shown by the definitions of its votaries. Thus, Prof. J. Sully defined it as a " natural history of the cosmos, including organic beings, expressed in physical terms as a mechanical process." Huxley, too, in a famous passage,2 1 Science and Philosophy of the Organism (19o8), vol. i., p. 2!. 2 Darwitsiana (Coll. Essays, II.), The Genealogy of Animals, p. xio. C</page><page sequence="3">34 The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR" tells us that " the fundamental proposition of Evolution .. is, that the whole world, living and not living, is the result of the mutual interaction, according to definite laws, of the forces possessed by the molecules, of which the primitive nebulosity of the universe was composed. If this be true, it is no less certain that the existing world lay, potentially, in the cosmic vapour ; and that a sufficient intelligence could, from a know ledge of the properties of the molecules of that vapour, have predicted, say the state of the Fauna of Britain in 1869, with as much certainty as one can say what will happen to the vapour of the breath in a cold winter's day." On this view-to consider it first in its broadest aspect-the universe is an aggregate of particles in motion, and all history is but a spatial shuffle. There is nothing very novel in this theory, for it is at least as old as Empedocles who wrote (Frag. 8 : More will I tell thee, too ; there is no birth Of all things mortal, nor end in ruinous death ; But mingling only and interchange of mixed There is, and birth is but its name with men. This is also th-6-view of all so-called atomists from Democritus to Gassendi and Descartes, and their modern successors who still believe in a world of hurtling billiard-balls. If we are logical, indeed, we shall not stop at these atomic billiard-balls ; for these, too, we must strip of the qualities with which our senses " clothe " them. So we are finally left with a collection of moving shadow-shapes, geometrical ghosts playing at Euclid. There is, unfortunately, one great difficulty about this process of simplification. It would seem that we have relieved the atom (or electron, it matters little until there is nothing left to relieve-as a child might lick a sweet until it is " gone." For must we not make a clean sweep of shape and figure also And, in that case, we have reduced reality to algebraic smoke, to a weird dance of symbols and equations " pinnacled in the dim intense inane." We must not think that there is anything spontaneous about the dance o these infra-atomic spooks. No. Radical mechanism cannot afford to allow the tiniest dust-grain or ather-kink to stray from " law." Nothing new can ever happen, for the future is " given " in the present, and the world was finished at the start. Hence this so-called evolution is but a delusive show engendered by the imperfection of our human minds. For a</page><page sequence="4">1912. The Meaning of Evolution. 35 mind which could grasp the present motions of all the world particles " nothing would be uncertain ; the future, as well as the past would be present to its eyes."1 This Super-astronomer might write a nautical almanac recording every stir and thought of every human being, dead, alive or unborn. To describe the Siege of Troy, or to delineate the New Zealander standing on the ruins of London Bridge, is equally easy ; it is merely a question of putting minus or plus before the time.2 Thus, in a thoroughly mechanical world, time does not count, for such a world is essentially reversible. We might reverse the handle, and the tune of life would be played backwards into initial silence. This rather startling conclusion is really the strongest refu tation of the mechanical premises on which it is based. For no one can seriously conceive the universe as working back wards-chairs becoming trees, cows calves, chickens eggs, this article flowing back into the inkstand, our reasonings reversed. Even Mr. Wells' Time Machine did not again uncrumple the Jurassic limestones, or restore the Devonian giant-ferns, or revivify the Permian 600sters crawling in primeval slime. These things have perished never to return ; for there is no Promethean heat that can relume the light of life when once it has been quenched. Hence, Matthew Arnold was right when he wrote of his dog, " Geist " : Not the course Of all the centuries yet to come, And not the infinite resource Of Nature, with her countless sum Of figtires, with her fulness vast Of new creation evermore, Can ever quite repeat the past, Or just thy little self restore. So even the life of a little dog cannot be played backwards; other dogs may come, but this dog never. Even if this dog 1 Laplace, at the beginning of his Essai thilosophique sur le calcul des lrobabilites (1812). 2 All this Laplacian mythology seems to be self-contradictory. For, either this Intelligence is a part of the world, and 80 its very prophecies and retro spects are absolutely determined-and in that case they might be a rigid undiscoverable lie. Or else it is not part of the world ; and in that case it is outside Time (as God is), and we cannot say that it reasons past and future from the present.</page><page sequence="5">36 The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR., were restored to life, he could not re-live his past ; he would simply start afresh. If these objections be valid, it follows that the ordinary view of evolution explains everything ex300t evolution. It deals with a static world capable of being exhaustively described in terms of mechanical laws-a universe in which the presence of quality, change, or life would be an insoluble mystery. Such a view is manifestly insufficient to grapple with the real problems of life. This being so, it seems, at first sight, strange that this mechanical view should have always found such wide spread ac300tance. Moreover, each one can verify in himself the instinctive inclination to regard the world as a finished pre determined datum, and to look upon a.11 change and growth as the mere to-and-fro of changeless motes. Some philosophers1' would explain this instinct as due to a confusion between time and space, i.e., we regard an interval of time as analogous to a line in space, which can be seen at once and traversed in either 'direction. But this explanation seems to be simply a re statement of the problem. The question is : Why do we thus, try to spatialise time Whence comes this anomalous ten dency towards a pseudo-explanation of time and evolution Our initial reference to the pragmatic function of an hypo thesis at once suggests an answer to this question, viz., that the genesis of the mechanical view is due to practical psychological factors. That this is really the case we can see by a brief analysis of the psycho-economic problem of time. This pro blem arises from the fact that those things or aspects of reality which are psychologically and socially of importance are those which do not change with time. We may thus explain, for instance, the origin of the ordinary man's view that every object has its own special colour. Few people realise this wonderful faculty, which we possess, of regarding the colours of things as approximately constant. Yet, without it-as Hering points out-a piece of chalk on a dull day would have the same colour as a bit of coal in the sunshine, and, in the course of a single day, would pass through all gradations from black to white. Unless this invariancy of colour was con structed, we could no more attribute whiteness to chalk or blackness to coal than hotness or coldness to iron. But, thanks ......... 1 For instance, Guyau, Le genlse de l'idee de temps, Paris,R 1-90. The substance of this book of Guyau (who died in 1888 had already appeared in the Revue philosophique before the appearance of M. Bergson's Essair sur tes donnies immediate: de la conscience (1889), which has similar ideas. The view given in the text is similar to that developed by Prof. Royce and others.</page><page sequence="6">1912. The Meaning of Evolution. 37 to this convenient capacity, we can now regard the colour of a thing, not as a sign of the nature of the illumination, but as a mark of the thing itself ; we have rescued colour from time. In its social aspect we find the genesis still clearer. To take a simple instance, it is essential for the traditions of a craft, or for the continuance of an art or manufacture, that men should regard matter as so much passive stuff perfectly plastic to human purposes. Thus a pot, a painting, or a tool are to be regarded as temporally immutable, as things embodying a definite human purpose for all time. Yet, it is notorious that such objects do change; the pot is abraded, the painting fades, the tool becomes blunted. To account for these changes so that they should still be, theoretically speaking, socially verifiable, men imagined the alteration as simply a spatial re distribution of the unchanged materials. In this way the fiction that every change can be controlled and reversed is still main tained. It is for the same reason that the " primary qualities " are regarded as pre-eminently real. For spatial determinations are, in fact, the only sense-data which can serve as a social standard ; they are the only phenomena which can be simul taneously perceived by a community, and which can be reproduced at will by other men-. It is this same differentiation of social emphasis which gradually categorises the baby's world into those distinctions of primary and secondary qualities which have become stereo typed in the adult mind. To the baby, at first every colour and taste has its full share of reality-was there not for each one an age when everything, firom toe to rattle, went into his mouth But the economic exigencies of nursery-existence gradually eliminate the riot of tastes and colours, and introduce the child to that drab metromaniac world which is our social inheritance. We have dwelt thus long on the psychology of determinism because we believe that it is to the instinctive social reference above described that we must attribute the otherwise inex plicable' reluctance of so many men of science to see aught in vital phenomena ex300t changes of motion. Only in some such way can we account for this persistent attempt to explain away all the growths, adaptations and novelties in the world in favour of the identities, conservations and effects ; or, to use Prof. Baldwin's terms, the tendency to replace the longitudinal by the " cross-sectional " study of things. That this attempt is nugatory _we have already shown from the essential irreversi bility of time. As elaborate efforts-too technical to be dealt</page><page sequence="7">38 The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR., with here-have been made to reply to this argument, we shall reinforce our reasoning by a more direct refutation of the mechanistic interpretation of evolution. Literally, of course, the word " evolution " means unfold ing, and, in the eighteenth century, for instance, the term was used to denote that view which regarded the biological develop ment of an individual as analogous to the unrolling of a carpet, or the inflation of a balloon. On this theory, the embryo pre existed in the fertilised egg as the butterfly in the chrysalis or the flower in the bud. For the preformationist, therefore, there is no real becoming ; growth is but spatial expansion ; the in crease in heterogeneity is merely apparent-the emergence into sight of what was present all along.' Brevity has compelled us to be somewhat crude in our exposition ; but, as an example of contemporary preformationism, we may quote the following passage from Prof.' E. Hering2 :-" If, with our corporeal or intellectual eye, we could penetrate the minutest internal struc ture of the substance of germs-if we could comprehend the arrangement and motion of the molecules and atoms-we should discover that the living germ-substance of each animal species has its specific properties, and the substance of each single germ has its individual properties, by virtue of which, in a further evolution, a special and peculiar type must mechanically develop." We must first point out the curious irrelevancy of all such statements. It is calmly assumed that if we could " see " the molecular architecture of a germ, we should know its future career. Similarly, we are told by other writers that, if a human brain could be preserved, a sufficiently accurate histological examination could, at any future time, tell us the thoughts and emotions which the individual experienced during life. How ever explicit these expressions of faith may be, they can hardly be called arguments. Such hypothetical formulations may be neglected until some evidence is forthcc ming to explain to us how, from the position of the players in any one scene, we could tell the whole play of life's drama. However, let us waive this objection, and let us suppose that we did see these far-famed ' Logically speaking, such a view should not be confined to the indivi dual, but should extend to the -whole species, so that the germ of the first ancestor contained the models of all his descendants. Such a theory of encasement seems a reductio ad absurdum of all attempts to account for life by physico-chemistry. 2 The Specific Energies, Eng. Trans. (Chicago,3 1902), p. 34.</page><page sequence="8">1912. The Meaning of Evolution. 39 particles-call them ids, determinants, biophors, if you will. We should then simply have a group of mechanical facts in addition to the vital facts. The study of an organism could, at most, lead us to infer the kind of experience which either had been or was to be its ; but it could not re-iterate or forestall its experience. Hence, to all such arguments, we can reply that the future contains unique events for every individual. My life has never been lived before ; it cannot be anticipated or re produced ; it can neither be shut up like a telescope, nor opened out like a concertina ; it must be lived. There is, then, a real sense in which time is incompressible, and the future is not " given " in the present. These remarks are sufficient to dispose of the mechanical theory of evolution as a 'complete presentation of reality. But it would be true to say that not even in its own province of biology does mechanism afford any adequate account of develop ment. For how does this theory view the organism Simply as a congeries or constellation-a mere arithmos as the Pythagoreans put it. In this way it is quietly assumed that the only unit in existence is an atom, or rather a point ; and that what appears discontinuously distributed through space (e.g., a living being cannot be one, but is a mere sum, an aggregate of disparate entities. The mechanistic view of evolution stands or falls with this assumption. If we can adduce one single fact which is irreconcileable with the supposition that a living being is simply a spatial manifold, then there is an end of all matter in-motion views of evolution. For in that case we should have proved that a living being was an organic whole, which is not the mere sum of its parts, but a unity transcending spatial diversity and distance. We shall mention one such fact out of many. At a certain stage of development, the sea-urchin's egg is a cluster of about Soo cells. If such an embryo is chopped up into bits, each chance fragment will develop into a perfect larva. Thus, by a mere scissors-operation, we obtain a multi tude of tiny individuals instead of one large larva. We can best realise the strangeness of this result by imagining the disjecta membra of an exploded engine developing into a brood of Liliputian locomotives. This interesting experiment, if carefully examined, will be found to be quite decisive in prov ing that an organism is not an extended mechanism like an engine. For if it were, i.e., if the organism could be regarded as an intensity or structure distributed spatially a600g its parts, it would be impossible to conceive how the arbitrarily selected</page><page sequence="9">40 The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR., parts could, when separated, become different from what they would have been in conjunction. They do, however ; and herein lies the significance of the results of experimental embryology. In the light of these results we can no longer be satisfied with resolving the universe into atoms in motion. For the constitutive unity of the parts of an organism is far closer than can be represented by their spatial arrangement ; and the gap which divides one living being from another cannot be expressed in terms of spatial separation. It follows from this that, in a certain sense, every living being is unique, it is a hapax legomenon in the book of nature. At least, every indi vidual life is a new event in the world ; every birth a gain, and every death a loss of reality. And thus we finally arrive at the important negative conclusion, that even if we tear our mechanical theories to tatters, to very rags, they cannot be so pieced out as to cover the facts of life ; for all real Becoming lies beyond the ken of mechanism. That such real Becoming takes place, we have already proved from the very nature of Time and of the Individual. But we must now extend our inquiry and examine the scope and significance of evolution, not merely in the individual, but in the species. The chief evidence for the evolution of species is to be found in the facts of palaeontology. And certainly any one who is familiar with the record of the rocks as a whole, will be impressed with a vague general conviction that there has been an evolution of some kind. Yet we shall meet therein little evidence for any of our a priori schemes of evolution. We find many independent surging streams of life, flowing some times in opposite directions, some increasing in volume, others diminishing and coming to an end. , We find no generalised types ; the Cambrian trilobites, for instance, are all highly specialised. Neither do we meet with " links " ; the Jurassic archaeopteryx is at once a perfect bird, and a perfect reptile ; there are no plants connecting algae and mosses or mosses and ferns. Of course, it is easy to fill in phylogenetic gaps by " creatures whose skeleton was not . sufficiently solidified to be preserved," and we might suppose many " origins " to have been lost in Silurian darkness. But, as the broad admission of evolution is sufficient for our present purpose, it seems hardly profitable to, discuss these efforts of the " scientific imagination." On the strength of the palxontological evidence, we may, therefore, ac300t the general fact of evolution (the word need</page><page sequence="10">1912. The Meaning of Evolution. 41 not frighten us). At the same time, it is only fair to add that, if anyone believes simply that life was progressively introduced ab extra, so to speak, at certain intervals, we do not see how he can be shown to be in error. Perhaps the seeming con tinuity of life is really due to a series of discontinuous extrinsic impulses, just as the wheels of a motor-car are turned by a succession of explosions Instead of a slow spiral creeping up the stairs of life, there may have been a series of sudden steps. Who can tell There certainly seems to be a necessity for some such impetus at life's start on earth. And with absolute certainty we may assert that man's introduction implies a new creative act. If anyone denies this, while he may be convicted of philosophical ineptitude, he cannot be refuted on zoological grounds. On the other hand, the brute-origin of man's body can never be proved. For everyone admits that quaternary man appears at the exact epoch when the anthro poids had reached their present high development. But whether the first man's soul was inserted in an existing anthropoid body, or whether a body was organised for it de novo-this is a question which neither science nor philosophy can ever answer, for the simple reason that they can never have any evidence to decide it.' These serious limitations constitute an almost insuperable difficulty in any attempt to discover the actual ancestry of an animal-group. Yet, the difficulty has been strangely overlooked even by men of the rank of Huxley or Kowalewsky, who con fused the actual genetic sequence of a series of animals with a series of genera displaying an increasing functional development 1 Cf.' Wasmann, Modern Biology (x9xo), ch. xi., p. 438 note, and Sertillanges, Les sources de la croyance en Dieu (x9o5), ch. iv., pp 145 ff. We know no evidence for the simian origin of man's body. The Java ape bones and the Neandertal cranium prove nothing ; while the hunters of the Mousterian Age are already big-brained men, superior to the Australian aborigines. ' As for Freudenthal's blood-reaction " proof," it can only be characterised as a chemical joke. It is to us simply inexplicable how Geddes and Thomson (Evolution, x91 x, p. 63/. could reproduce this as " experimental evidence of blood-relationship, and this in the most complete and literal sense." We may soon expect to see hydrophobia adduced as a " proof " that we are descended from dogs [Since the above was written, a prehistoric human skeleton, found near Ipswich, has been stated to be preglacial and of a high cranial type. Though we are not dealing with the theological aspect of the question, we may mention that the hypothesis of the brute-derivation of man's body is theologically temerarious; witness the canon of the approved Council of Cologne, x86o, (Collectio Lacensis, vol. V., col. 292), and the condemnation Of Leroy's book (Civilta Cattolica, 7 Jan.,' 1899, p. 49)</page><page sequence="11">42 The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR., of an organ. Have we not all seen, adduced as proof of evolution, a list (not always chronological showing the pro gressive reduction of the lateral toes of certain quadrupeds Similarly, the development of the bicycle, steam-engine, etc., are quoted ad nauseam as " illustrations of evolution." But all such arguments are utterly irrelevant to the question of genetic derivation. In the first place, primitivity of structure or function is quite a fallacious guide to antiquity in time. Brachiopods, like crania or lingula, and foraminifers, such as lagena or rotalia, are the same to-day as they were in the Silurian age ; and the modern sub-order hyracoidea has many primitive features resembling those of several small Eocene ungulates. In the next place, there are indubitable instances, to prove that many different animals have arrived at indepen dent solutions of the same problem. We have a simple example in the processes by which the lobster wriggles out of his armour, and. those by which a newt splits his " skin.' Another striking resemblance of function occurs in a siluroid fish (arm. boakei and in a Chilian batrachian (rhinoderma darwinii), both of which possess the extraordinary habit of buccal incubation (formation of a brood-pouch by the male). These instances, in which no one would dream of seeing any evolutionary significance, ought to make us more than cautious in swallowing the ordinary arguments from " homology," which deduce genetic relationship by ignoring the alternative explanation of independent correspondance. Objections such as these-and we could urge many more will help us to realise the extraordinary facility with which, given a little good will, biologists can see " evidences " for evolution everywhere. There is more joy a600g biologists over one genetic explanation than over ninety-nine instances of indepen dent development. We must confess that, to us, this has always been something of a psychological puzzle ; for the so called " explanation " is simply a mysterious hypothesis added to what is to be explained, so that our last state is worse than the first. For instance, polydactylism in horses is cer tainly a curious phenomenon ; but how is it made more intelligible by attributing it to reversion to Miocene ancestors That a child should have a distinct premaxillary bone may reasonably be explained as due to arrest of normal develop ment ; but to say that it is due to " atavism " only makes the problem uncanny. The type of mind which revels in such " explanations "</page><page sequence="12">19i2. The Meaning of Evolution. 43 may be illustrated by a question asked in a recent book' : " Unless the coccyx is a tail, what can it be And if it does not represent a reduced counterpart of the tails of other mammals, what does it represent ?" To which, of course, we can only blandly reply that the coccyx is the coccyx, and that it does not " represent " anything in particular ex300t itself. How curious that the anti-teleologist should ask such questions What mental comfort can we derive from knowing that the coccyx " represents a tail."2 Such phrases can soothe only those minds which find a solace in presenting a gallery of ancestors to the horse, in adding atavistic reminiscence to the " teeth " of the foetal whale, and, in making an embryo in the womb give a private performance of the cosmic drama. It may be all true ; but let us not apply the term explanation to a process which doubles all our mysteries. For the scope of this article, we have now sufficiently sketched our reasons for rejecting the ordinary proofs and schemes of evolution. Basing ourselves exclusively on the facts of palaeontology, we think that there is overwhelming evidence-yet always hypothetical-for the existence of some evolution of species. It is unnecessary to delay on the familiar details of this evidence ; our present object is rather to gauge the significance of this admission. At the outset we must assert that this evolution has not been simply an accumulation of randon variations, as Darwin and others assumed. This view is clearly the expression of that mechanistic con300t of life which we have already refuted. From what we have said, it is evident that the atypical agents of the environment play the part of condition rather than cause ; they lubricate or retard, but do not constitute, the wheels of life. The simple Spencerian view of organisms, as mere plastic nothings, really carries us back to the days of the alchemists, who thought that every metal 1 Crampton, The Doctrine of Evolution (19x1), ch. v., p. 168. 2 Personally, we are quite content to regard it simply as a fulcrum for the gluteal and other muscles ; just as we regard the initial' eye-symmetry of flounders as a topographical necessity of growth, or the dorsal cord of mammalian embryos as a stimulative-nucleus for the formation of the back bone. The limits of space prevent us from discussing the " law of recapitulation," but we may refer the reader to Vialleton"s excellent work : Un probleme de revolution, (600tpellier, i9o8). Prof. Sedgwick rightly maintains that " the recapitulation theory originated as a deduction from the evolution theory, and as a deduction it still remains " (Darwin and Modern Science, pp. 175-176). The whole argument is, therefore, a petitio principii.</page><page sequence="13">44 The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR., and jewel was but a chance-donned vesture of the ubiquitous prothyle, that the dia600d, for instance, was simply a worked up form of the same metaphysical putty as underlay bone. So, too, to read some biologists, one would imagine that Dame Nature formed organisms just as the she-bear was fabled to lick her cubs into shape ; living beings are but worked-up lumps of protoplasmic jelly. But to regard the present fauna and flora as the outcome of the struggle and interaction of such primitive dough, would reduce the world of life to the economic condition of that famous island whose inhabitants lived by tak ing in one another's washing. Natural selection, therefore, is essentially unproductive and eliminative ; it may account for the disappearance of what is not, but it cannot by itself explain the appearance of what is. This we must seek' in some inner impulse of life itself. The experiments of Mendel and de Vries have shown conclusively that all variation is due to the actualisation of given Anlagen, the working of intrinsic factors. Sex and colour, for instance even certain deformities-are but the expression of inherent tendencies determined at fertilisation. These developments have, of course, nothing to do with genuine species-formation ; but they may at least shed some light on the latter problem. For, must not the species, too, have its own law of develop ment, to be unfolded not in the short stretch of an individual existence, but in the cons which span the life of a race We are here using the word " species " in its longitudinal (chrono logical sense, i.e., to denote a genetic succession of individuals ; whereas the term is com600ly employed for the cross-sectional (geographical comparison of animals, i.e.,. to distinguish spatially-distributed groups of ' living individuals. It is to a confusion of both these senses that we must attribute such ques tions as : " Is not a species timeless and inviolable How can it unspecify itself, commit suicide, as it were ?" Such queries treat the distinction between, let us say, hipparion and a horse as identical with that between an ass and a horse. But surely this is an enormous assumption ; for the one thing certain about an ass is that he will never become a horse ; he may " evolve," but the only evolution possible is to increase his asininity. What we really mean to assert by the evolution of species is, that a set of genetically connected individuals would, if they were contemporaries, be specifically distinct. Yet they are not contemporary, but successive ; and to ignore this vital fact seems like begging the whole question of the nature of evolution. It</page><page sequence="14">1912. The Meaning of Evotution. 45 was this fact which led us to suggest that the species at any one period is really the partial expression of a wider dynamic reality which includes countless generations in its sweep. Many objections may be raised to this wider con300t of species as essentially inclusive of time. It will be urged that, as we can, by suitable crossing, drop the colour-factor out of peas or rabbits, or segregate a dominant characteristic, so we may come to control real species-formation.. But that this argument is inconclusive may be shown by an analogy in the non-living world, where we can form new compounds and syn theses, but are no nearer to controlling the process of atomic disintegration. There may be some things which essentially involve a time-factor ; they take their own time, so to speak. For instance, we can accelerate a red light, but in doing so we have made it yellow. , Perhaps each " species," too, has its own period, its time of ebb and flow. Are there not rhythms of change and permanence in the life of a species Evidence is not at all wanting to,show that life beat faster in the days of the ichthyosaurus, though at present We seem indeed To have slipped the world's great leaping time, and come Upon its pinched and dozing days. But as to the laws or causes of this apparently rhythmic evolu tion we are in profound ignorance. A sincere admission of Ignoramus is better than a laboured attempt to conceal our nescience by metaphors and verbalities'. As Owen said long ago,, " the sole consequence of vague generalities or figurative impersonations, propounded to show how transmutation may go on, has been to prejudice calm and sound judgments against any ac300tance of, or favour towards, the grounds of a belief in secondary creational law."" And, ' thirty years later, St. George Mivart declared : " After nearly forty years' medita tion and examination of the subject, .I remain convinced that the cause of specific characters still remains an unsolved enigma."2 Ten years after Mivart, another distinguished. biologist, Prof. Hans Driesch, gives the same verdict : " Every thing about a real theory of phylogeny must be left to the taste of each author who writes on the theory of the Living. You may call that a very unscientific state of affairs, but no other is 1 Anatomy of Vertebrates, vol. iii. (x868), p. 804. 2 Amer. Cath. Q. Review, xxiii.

We ourselves feel absolutely incapable of adduc ing anything specific to the general statement that there must be an unknown principle of transformism, if the hypothesis of descent is justified at all."' In developing the philosophical implications of the existence of this unknown principle, we have concluded that the species has a law according to which it unfolds itself in time. It would seem to follow from this that the species has an entity of its own. Or, at least, it would appear that the species has more unifying influence than is usually recognised by that ultra individualistic view which is due to an over-emphasis of the nutritive " struggle." We can see the increasing claims of the species exemplified in the 600otreme, marsupial, and placental mammals, and finding their culmination in human self sacrifice. Indeed, if we look at the individual purely as indivi dual, it seems utterly incomprehensible why it should ever produce other individuals, why it should-so to speak-go out side itself. Surely there must be a phylogenetic principle in the organism itself, which finds its expression in the uninter rupted chain of successive individuals in time, just as there is a principle of the developing egg-nvoriv Kat 8npuovp7ofw, Aris totle calls it-which makes a chicken out of a semi-fluid globule. In both instances we have a law which is a function of the time, a development into which time enters as an indispensable agent. So, if our analogy is correct, there would seem to be a priori no more objection to a mastodon becoming an elephant than there is to a blastula becoming a larva. In the last analysis, both ontogeny and phylogeny are equally" inex plicable ; but this should not blind us to .their real parallelism. For we may say that just as the fertilised egg contains a real Anlage (potency for individual development, so does the species for specific evolution. To this extent we may admit that Samuel Butler2 did well to lay side by side that mysterious bond of memory which unifies the life of the individual, and that still more enigmatic chain which binds together the life cycle of a species. It would be foolish, however, to see more than a metaphor in this racial reminiscence. If we do, we must, with the Platonist Cudworth, regard the species as the organism writ large. It is, indeed, curious to find that those who deny all 1 Science and Philosophy of the Organism (19o8), vol. i., pp. 291-292. 2C!. his Life and Habit (191o, ed.), ch. xv., p. 297, ch. viii., p. x3o.</page><page sequence="16">1912. The Meaning of Evolution. 47 real unity in the individual often regard the species as a real organic whole ; so prone are men to strain out a gnat and swallow a camel The difficulty in discussing such an ultra realistic con300tion of species is to see what exactly it means if it is taken as more than an analogy. How, we may ask, are we to perform the intellectual somersault required for the in tegration of cats into Cat How can we conceive ourselves as spokes in the wheel of the Absolute Juggernaut, as segments in a great crawling Annelid As we are not here dealing with the general problem of universals, we may leave this theory with the remark that, as a scientific hypothesis, it has every thing but evidence, and as a philosophical interpretation, it has every advantage ex300t intelligibility. It is unnecessary, then, to hypostasise species in order to believe in a law of evolution. And we can maintain a progres sive development without picturing life as a huge organism, like the mighty ash, Yggdrasil, the old Northman's symbol of the Cosmos. We need not, with M. Bergson,1 regard life as a current which, " traversing the bodies it has organised one after another, passing from generation to generation, has become divided a600gst species and distributed a600gst individuals without losing anything of its force " (p. 27). Such language might suit the description of some city's waterworks, but can only be characterised as crude when applied to the history of life on earth. Beneath all these metaphors of trees and streams we must seek the plain unadorned fact that life began on earth, and that it is ever increasing, growing, rioting in spontaneous energy. The general nature of this progression has occupied us so far ; there remains a final stage of its interpretation. Can we regard this evolution as an orderly scheme, " a mighty maze yet not without a plan " Or must we view life as " emerging with blind gropes from impercipience," as an irre sistible dlan rushing willy-nilly into the future Let us see the latest answer of M. Bergson. " We must get beyond both points of view," he tells us, " both mechanism and finalism being, at bottom, only standpoints to which the human mind has been led by considering the work of man " (p. 94). This invitation to " get beyond " these standpoints is somewhat disconcerting ; we feel as awkward as if we were asked to take a stroll along the fourth dimension. M. Bergson comes to our help ; and, like all philosophers who try to 1 The references are to Creative Evolution (Eng. Trans., x9n).</page><page sequence="17">48 The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR., transcend intelligence, he tells us that not knowledge but life will solve the riddle. " In default of knowledge properly so called, reserved to pure intelligence, intuition may enable us to grasp what it is that intelligence fail to give us " (p. 187). There remains, we are told, `_ around our con300tual and logical thought, a vague nebulosity, made up of the very substance, out of which has been formed the luminous nucleus that we call the intellect. Therein reside certain powers that are comple mentary to the understanding, powers of which we have only an indistinct feeling when we remain shut up in ourselves, toit which will become clear and distinct when they perceive them selves at work, so to speak, in the evolution of nature:' (p. xiii.). This is the mysterious " pure duration " in which we must plunge ere we can grasp evolution. Herein we are bathed in the very flux of life A silver stream Breaking with laughter from the lake divine Whence all things flow. This mystic bath will make all things clear ; ,we shall see how the busy bee builds nests, and how the lilies grow-but, alas,, these things can never be told. Intuition scorns all predicates ; it must be lived rather than thought ; communicable meaning is merely a by-product, and so cannot grasp the scheme of things entire. " Intellect, such at least as we find it in our selves, has been fashioned by evolution during the course of progress ; it is cut out of something larger, or, rather, it is only the projection, necessarily on a plane, of a reality that possesses both relief and depth " (p. 55). And so we are smilingly dismissed with a metaphor Sic alt atque animum pictura pascit inani. It seems to us, as it will to many others, that this state of intuition is but a state of aideism-the limit of an indefinitely narrow reason. The progressive impoverishment of all pos. sible epithets is simply the straight road to the unconscious. M. Bergson would have us stop just on the brink. And what have we then The incipent stage of nitrous-oxide anaesthesia, an asymptotic approach to a swoon. We feel sure, however, that the unfeeling tests of literal criticism ought not to be applied to M. Bergson's charming descriptions. Rather should we say with old Sir Tom Browne : " There are many things delivered rhetorically and many</page><page sequence="18">1912.] The Meaning o f Evolution, 49 expressions therein merely tropical . . . and, therefore, also there are many things to be taken in a soft flexible sense, and not to be called unto the rigid test of reason." Take, for instance, his "creative evolution." Interpreted literally, it would be an irrational, inexplicable improvisation ; and M. l3ergson's system would be perilously close to an apotheosis of the Unexpected. In fact, when an individual gets a large share of this "creative evolution " in hire, when his future actions become "essentially indeterminate and contingent," we usually provide him with a keeper. Hence, Bergsonism can hardly be called satisfactory, if this is its answer to the question, which, modernising Moliere, we put to M. Bergson Demandabo causam et rationem quare Evolutio facit res creari ? The Doctor Bachelierus replies Q uia est in ea, virtus creativa Cuius est natura, omnia produire. Which is a very brave, if not a very enlightening answer. It seems, however, to be the gist of M. Bergson's philosophy there is no explanation of evolution, it simply is. With the big-eyed wonder of Walt Whitman, he feels that the ocean of being is too deep to be fathomed by our human plummets I lie abstracted, and hear beautiful tales of things, and the reasons of things; They are so beautiful I nudge myself to listen. I cannot say to any person what I hear--I cannot say it to myself it is very wonderful. Unquestionably, all this is very admirable as far as it goes. The only question is, why it does not go farther. We find the reason, in M. Bergson's case, to lie in his misinterpretation of "radical finalism." The doctrine of teleology, we read, "implies that things and beings merely realise a programme previously arranged. But if there is nothing unforeseen, no invention or creation in the universe, time is useless again. As in the mechanistic hypothesis, here again it is supposed that all is given. Finalism thus understood is only inverted mechanism... It substitutes the attraction of the future for the D</page><page sequence="19">5o The Meaning of Evolution. [MAR., impulsion of the past. But succession remains none the less a mere appearance, as indeed does movement itself " (pp. 41-42). Thus, on this view of finalism, God is supposed either to stand at the beginning of the world and to give it a push, or to stand at the end and administer a pull. The world is " run " either by the pressure of the past or by the suction of the future. While determinism asserts that the initial plane determines all, this pseudo-finalism declares that everything depends on the last plane. This kind of teleology, however, must be regarded as a huge anthropomorphic bogey. For it is not the colophon any more than the title-page that determines the book of nature ; it is the meaning fpfthe Whole. Both views are involved in the same error, the assumption that all reality is in time. Both imply that " they one far-off divine event to which the whole creation moves " is merely a particular event in time. But to assert this is to quash all initiative and all contingency. It means ac300ting the 600istic " block universe," wherein everything has been done, and nothing new can ever happen. In such a universe, time would be a meaningless delusion ; for the con300t of time implies a reference to purpose, an end not yet attained. The very notion of time presupposes a duratio stans, and the very meaning of evolution implies a standard and a plan. But if this be so, the plan is not in time; it is that which gives time its meaning and its flow. Man, indeed, can partly glimpse it, for he alone can look before and after, and he alone can grasp the sequence and the rhythm. But there is One outside the flux of things who sees the scheme entire. Mark, however, he neither retrospects nor foresees ; for the Eternal is conscious not in time, but of time. We may fully admit that we can never adequately conceive the relation of the Timeless to events in time. But it does not follow that we are at liberty to revel in confusion, to employ indiscriminately slipshod modes of expression. We can pre cise and analyse our docta ignorantia. There is no need to take off our shoes half a mile from the burning bush. The mystery is plain enough when we come close up : how can we reconcile God's absolute timeless self-existence with the space confined, successive lives of mortal men To throw every thing into the insatiable maw of the Bradleyan Absolute is to deny all progress, and to stultify experience. And, on the other hand, to exaggerate the pluralism of life into a chaotic .congeries of independent disparate entities means contradiction</page><page sequence="20">'912. The Meaning of Evolution. 51 and irrationality. Must man's mind then for ever be tossed between a system of petrified absolutism and a theory of uni versal evolutionism Christian theism, pace M. Bergson, mediates these ex tremes. To the Christian, evolution appears neither as the phosphorescence on a decaying Absolute, nor as a lifeless whirlgig of clashing atoms, but as the time-expression of God's purpose, the unfolding of an eternal plan. Becoming is, there fore, real, but it is founded on Being. The mistake of the moderns lies in their taking as their standard of Being the puny half-potential beings of earth. Forgetting that Eternal Energy which spans the stretch of time, they understand Our natural world too insularly, as if No spiritual counterpart completed it, Consummating its meaning, rounding all To justice and perfection, line by line, Form by form, nothing single, nor alone, The great below clenched by the great above.
