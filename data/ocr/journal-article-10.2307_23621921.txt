<plain_text><page sequence="1">FROM ARAD TO CARTHAGE HARVEST RITES AND CORN-DOLLIES 1 Richard D. Barnett* The origins of agriculture have formed the object of intensive study in the last fifty years since World War I. They began with researches organized in Russia by Professor N. Vavilov and made known to the West in 1926;2 and the study may be said to have culminated recently in a joint symposium and research plan, organized jointly by the Royal Society and British Academy, and partly published in 1976.3 The discovery of the art of agriculture by early man is now clearly seen as a feature of and perhaps the decisive factor in the so-called 'Neo lithic revolution". British and American research ers, in the course of excavations of classical impor tance, have shown that the beginnings of the domestication of wild cereals (barley and emmer) go back to the archaeological levels labelled by them (perhaps rather clumsily) 'Pre-Pottery Neo lithic A' at Beida in Jordan, dated to the 7th millennium BCE and at Jericho dated to 8340 7300 BCE. A similar picture emerges at Jarmo in Kurdistan (Iraq) and at Alikosh in Khuzistan (SW Iran). So it does also in Turkey at Cayönü in the Taurus foothills, at Subeyde and at Catal Hüyük in the Konya plain. In Egypt, wheat and barley were both grown from Neolithic times, which may be placed in the 6th millennium BCE. We need hardly go into the question here why this revolutionary development should have taken place through this particular area, labelled by Charles Breasted the 'Fertile Crescent5 — a somewhat hypothetical cul tural area, arching from Egypt through Palestine *At the time of Dr. Barnett's death, this article was among his papers and it is published in the state in which it was found. Dr. J.E. Curtis of the British Museum kindly undertook to prepare it for publication. and Syria into Turkey and across Iraq into Iran — we need merely to remark on it. What we may ask, however, is: what can we recover or postulate about early man's thoughts on the control of agri culture? It hardly needs to be stressed that matters which concern procreation, fertility and reproduc tion, whether of the fields and forests or of human kind itself, belong by timeless and instinctive tradition, in the first instance certainly at the popu lar level, to the area of women's magic — to the sorcery of witches and lay-practitioners, or to the ritual of priestesses. Who knows what magical practices and rituals (as we would describe them), intended to safeguard the agricultural harvest from its hazards and anxieties, were evolved as the Chalcolithic Age proceeded? Catal Hüyük is now famous not merely for its urban structure and its amazing frescoes, but also for its series of magnifi cently stylized figures in the form of fat women, suggestive of fertility. Later a youthful male figure is added. These ideas of the role of women certainly continued to survive into subsequent ages. At this popular level (i.e. as opposed to priestly circles in urban societies) we may be sure that the most important danger points in the agricultural process, which had to be anticipated and guarded against by the use of magic, were the ploughing and the sow ing, the fertilization of the seed by rain and the harvesting. A small bronze group from Luristan, exhibited in the Reza Abbasi Cultural Centre in Teheran, represents a naked woman ploughing with a team of oxen, with three birds sitting on the yoke — a ritual or symbolic group without a doubt.4 This emphasis on the prime role of women in matters of fertility and procreation is in keeping</page><page sequence="2">2* RICHARD D. BARNETT with the apparent emphasis laid by these early societies on the power of a female deity.5 Primitive man was accustomed to explain the things that passed ordinary understanding by postulating the existence of an outside physical or spiritual force, objectively existent, which directed, inspired or controlled them. Only this could explain his fear and justify his reactions, and by conciliating this force the situation could be brought under some degree of control. Thus in the area of agriculture, there had to be a spirit of the corn. Such a spirit or force might be named or have many names. Gods and Goddesses of the Harvest As society advanced and a priestly class was evolved, rituals were devised, systematized and organized, and names were sanctified for the corn spirit, who tends to be regarded now as a male. When we first meet a spirit of corn and harvest in the third millennium BCE in Sumer, these rituals were no doubt already ancient. The Sumerian god dess of fertility is Inanna, and the corn spirit is by then identified with Dumuzi, later known as Tam muz. His story and the mythology surrounding him have evoked a substantial literature.6 In Anatolia, the god of fertility and procreation is the ancient Hattic god Telipinu, of whose disappearance and annual sleep a charming tale was told.7 In it, it is to be particularly noticed that it is the mother of the gods, DMAH, who at last finds him by sending her special animal, the bee, to sting Telipinu in the foot and wake him up. On the procession of the gods carved in the great rock sanctuary of the Hittites at Yazihkaya in Central Turkey, Telipinu holds as his symbol a hieroglyph or symbol that, it has been claimed, appears to be a stalk of corn.8 Often the function of protection of the corn is split between two figures. Thanks to Schaeffer's energy and bril liant successes at Ras Shamra, priceless texts have been recovered from the levels of the 14th century BCE, describing among many other things the ritual drama of Ba'al, son of Dagan, perhaps the corn god of the Amorites. Ba'al 'the lord' is the same as the Syrian Haddu, the storm-god; he plays the leading role in a drama of fertility with his beloved sister Anat, the virgin goddess,9 but the details are still somewhat obscure. Whether Ba'al or another deity, his enemy Mot, represented the spirit of the grain is unclear. No certain illustration of Mot exists but we may plausibly consider that we have an illustration of this spirit of the corn on a stele found at Ras Shamra, which depicts a human figure whose head is replaced by what appears to be a plume or a feather or even a stalk of corn.10 Here this figure might be that of Mot, who is said to be ground and crushed like corn, and it in fact repre sents the corn itself. In Egypt there are fertility cults enough: Min of Koptos and Osiris who in death is associated with corn growing." In Egyptian stelae representing the Syrian triad, we see commonly Min (replacing Canaanite Mot) combined with Ba'al or Sutekh in support of Ashtart.12 Popular Harvest Practices in the Chalcolithic and Early Bronze Periods In the Neolithic and Chalcolithic periods in Syria and Palestine the evidence of the practice of agri culture and associated practices is constantly increasing. In the Beersheba district the remarkable excava tions of Jean Perrot have unearthed in subterra nean dwellings astonishing ivory and bone figur ines representing both a male and females: one of the latter was found in an empty grain silo.13 But no Chalcolithic or Early Bronze Age site has been so systematically and patiently laid bare as the city of Arad excavated by Ruth Amiran during 18 seasons between 1962 and 1984. Her devotion was re warded in 1971 by a highly interesting discovery, one of the most singular in the field of popular religious beliefs: a graffito scored on a stone slab 24 cm high, found in the vicinity of a temple of the Early Bronze Age.14 It lay upside down on the floor of a large room, possibly part of a public building, in the centre of the city. Two stylized human figures are shown, simplified to mere 'matchstick men', their hands uplifted with outstretched fingers, one lying within a rectangle, the other at right-angles across it (111. 1). What does this strange but carefully delineated design signify? A couple of scarecrows? That hardly seems a sufficient explana tion. Ruth Amiran suggests that it may represent a divine being in two different situations, one live and one dead, logically a cyclic deity, and calls it a representation of 'Dumuzi-of-the-grain', i.e. the</page><page sequence="3">FROM ARAD TO CARTHAGE: HARVEST RITES AND CORN-DOLLIES 3* 111. 1. Cult stela from Arad. From 1EJ 22 (1972). p. 87 corn-spirit. It does indeed suggest stalks of some kind, and the parallels that she brings from Egypt are not at all wide of the mark. The name she gives it is, of course, a pure guess based on the appel lation of the contemporary Sumerian deity, though it remains true that the cult of Dumuzi, in the form of Tammuz, was practised in Jerusalem itself (and in Palestine)15 but hardly at so early a date as this. Personally, I would prefer not to confer on this Arad figure the name of any special deity wor shipped in a priestly cult, only to suggest that it depicts the nameless corn-spirit of ambiguous sex, probably honoured then as now at a popular level, which has survived until today largely because it is nameless. Let us first look at the modern parallels. Popular Harvest Practices in Modern Palestine If we look into the customs of the Arab countryside in Israel and Jordan we find much still to learn, even though these customs are disappearing fast or are said (sometimes incorrectly) to have already disappeared — through mechanization, modern rationalism, dispersion and other influences that are inevitably wreaking their destructive effects. In his study of Palestinian-Arab rural customs and life published forty years ago, Gustav Dalman tells us of the harvest customs still in use in western parts of what is now Jordan and was once ancient Moab.16 The account of Dalman supplements that of Jaussen, made in 1908.17 It is June at the height of the harvesting; the reapers stand at work in a long line forming the corn-bundles, called semal. Four or five of these bundles make up a sheaf called gömer — this is the same as the Biblical 'omer or wave-offering of first fruits which the Hebrew priest was required (according to Leviticus) to wave before the altar.18 The portions left over in the corners of the field are (i.e. were) called gorah at Madeba, and are left uncut as described in the Book of Ruth. Gradually the harvesters approach the last sheaf (called rimr). It is deemed male and is called 'the old man of the harvest' (es säib el haside)■, at first in sympathy for his coming fate they say es-säib mrid 'the old man is ill' then es-säibbinäze ('the old man is dying') and finally es säib mat alläh yirhamo ('the old man is dead, God forgive him').19 Then the last bundle is cut, the 'old man' or sheaf is laid in a mock grave like a good Moslem and covered with a stone and the con fession or a short prayer is recited over him. Dal man notes that this custom of burying the last corn bundle was observed in the villages of el-ikbebe, hezma, der endäm, ez-zib, b$era, 'en gidi, däträs, es-söbak, gifna, el-lubban, el-kerak and et-taflle. All lie in the hills east of Jerusalem. Jaussen adds that in the village of Iraq after the cutting a sacrifice was made to el-khalil, i.e. Abraham. Further, Dal man adds that from the new corn each year one made an artistic weaving called must (a comb), i.e. a 'corn-dolly', and hung it over the door20 — but always, he notes acutely, with the corn-ears point ing downwards so that their magic influence should re-enter the ground. For primitive and so too for untutored man, his counterpart in modern times, great anxieties were felt to surround the dangerous moment of harvesting, when the corn was cut and the seed-corn with its vital potential for next year's harvest and survival had to be saved and carried over the summer's and winter's dangers. The risk of offending or even killing the corn spirit was at its greatest when the last sheaf was cut — and it is the last sheaf into which the last animals of the field take refuge: it can be seen to be still full of life, though doomed — but by cutting, the last sheaf becomes the first fruit of the harvest. Here then, I suggest, we have already at Arad a representation of 'the old man', first lying in his grave, then</page><page sequence="4">w 111. 2. 'Corn-dolly' from Buseirah (Photo Israel Museum) 111. 3. 'Corn-dolly' from Buseirah (Photo Israel Museum) revived and upright, more or less as envisaged in the beliefs of Dalman,s day. Of course this latter point is only conjecture. It is commonly claimed that the 'corn-dolly' or must no longer exists in Eretz-Israel. This is not quite true. It certainly can still be found in Jordan (1974) and I succeeded in obtaining some examples of two slightly different types from Buseira (Bseira), thanks to the kind help of Crystal Bennett, who got them for me in 1975 from a workman employed in her excavations (Ills. 2-3). I under stand that he told her he made them himself.21 Further investigation in the same area would doubtless produce others. Another example was obtained from an Alaouite village in the Golan, from a workman employed on the excavations at Tel Dan in or about 1972 (111. 4). I owe the illus tration of it to the kindness of Dan Bahat, who drew my attention to it. The custom of making such objects certainly appears to survive only in the most conservative corners of Israel and Jordan, naturally only in Arab areas, since it belongs to the culture pattern of the fellahin. Examples are known from Jericho which go back in date to 1898,22 but research might extend the area of record in Israel and nearby regions.231 found one still in use in the Beersheba district; it was made by a lady named Wadfa, otherwise Umm Ibrahim of the Abu 111. 4.

This example, she told me, was made for baraka ('good luck') and hung in her tent.

Popular Harvest Practices in Ancient and Modern Egypt It may perhaps be thought utterly far-fetched to attempt to explain a sgraffito of the Early Bronze Age by a rural custom practised over forty centuries later. Nevertheless it is a custom admitted or assumed to be of great antiquity with some reason, as we shall see; and there is some other evidence besides that from Arad of the existence of the popular ritual of 'corn-dollies' in antiquity. For these we have to turn to Egypt, where they appear to be illustrated in the tomb frescoes of the XVIIIth Dynasty. In the Tomb of Nakht at Thebes25 is a series of well-known frescoes which show contem porary scenes of harvesting: the corn already reaped is now being winnowed before a 'crescent shaped object' hung on the wall. Davies had some difficulty in explaining the 'crescent-shaped object' which he suggested might represent the moon at the turn of the harvest festival, when 'Ernutet, lady of the granaries' is worshipped, shown as a cobra in a basket. He noted further the presence of other illustrations of the same object in Tomb 38, where Djeserkaresonb, scribe of the corn of Amon, makes a burnt offering to Ernutet while a crescent-shaped object above a triangle is said in the accompanying dedication to Amon to be 'on the threshing floor'.26 Yet another scene similar to that of Nakht occurs in Tomb 57, belonging to Khäemhet, where the 'crescent-shaped object' is set upright at the side of the threshing floor, and its ends appear as two hands grasping the ears of corn set before it as an offering on a dish. In 1922 Winifred Blackman wrote a striking and, in my opinion, convincing article,27 arguing that this mysterious object in the tomb-paintings must be an ancient Egyptian 'corn dolly' or 'corn-maiden', as she preferred to call it, assigning it, as is done in many parts, to the female sex. To support her point she drew comparisons with the contemporary Egyptian practice of making 'corn-dollies' at El-Lahun in the Fayum and in Asyut province and described their use and meaning with a wealth of valuable detail. She also noted that this figure is known in Egypt as the 'arüseh or 'arüseh el-kamh (the bride from the corn), 'arüseh meaning properly a bride but also a doll, thereby assigning it firmly to the female sex. Miss Blackman illustrated her point with an 'aril seh from El-Lahun and I was able to identify her actual example28 (together with others illustrated by her)29 in the Pitt Rivers Collection at Oxford. 'Corn-dollies' of the same type are still made at Tanturah, home of the Osireion, but appear to have now become an item of the tourist trade.30 They are, however, still indistinguishable from those of fifty years ago. The Origins of the 'Tanit' Sign — possibly a 'Corn-Dolly' It need hardly be asked why actual examples of corn-dollies have not survived from antiquity, to be discovered in excavations. Conditions of preser vation in the soil must inevitably make the chance of survival of such fragile things exceedingly doubt ful, even if the excavators were sufficiently lucky to happen on them. It is only in conditions of extreme dryness as in caves or tombs that they might pos sibly survive. We are thus driven to fall back for their recognition on other illustrations in antiquity. Of this I suggest we have one more example, though reflected only in a highly stylized form. I refer to the well-known sign, the so-called 'Tanit symbol' or 'sign of Tanit', a familiar feature of Carthaginian archaeology.31 An example has now been found by Dothan at Akko,32 stamped on the shoulder of a vase found in the stratum of the Hellenistic period. This sign is manifestly partly based on an elabo ration of the well-known Egyptian ankh symbol, of which the base has been spread out so that the 'body' forms a more or less isosceles triangle (in fact just as it does in the XVIIIth Dynasty tomb representations commented on above) and with the arms ending in hands, but now upraised as if in prayer: it is in any case not unusual for ankh and djed symbols in Egyptian art to develop arms and hands but the assimilation to the ankh could give the crescent-shaped symbol a round head it never possessed.33 This 'Tanit symbol' appears carved on (literally) hundreds of Punic stelae — some 400 examples are cited or illustrated in the Corpus Inscriptionum Semiticarum alone — chiefly from</page><page sequence="6">6* RICHARD D. BARNETT '':n, 111. 5. Punic stela, BM 125117. Reproduced by per mission of the Trustees of the British Museum the sanctuaries of the goddess at Carthage, Sousse and elsewhere34 (111. 5). These stelae usually bear a laconic dedication to Tanit pene ba'al (a phrase of obscure meaning), Ba'al or Ba'al Hammon and are commonly associated with child sacrifices in a tophet. The cult of Tanit is attested at Carthage in the shrine of Tanit from the 5th century BCE, though (as has been often pointed out)35 it seems to be virtually unknown in the Phoenician homeland before the 5th century BCE. In explanation, it seems likely that in the late 6th or in the early 5th century BCE, Carthage began to develop on a more extensive scale than ever before the vast potentialities of corn-growing in her North African coast and hinterland. Herodotus36 speaks of the richness of the crops of Libyan Cyrene and Carthage need not have lagged behind. If new and large areas were being put under the plough to feed a rapidly growing population and to export abroad, it seems likely that the Carthaginian priesthood felt a need to create — possibly in association with this policy — a new symbol of magical power like the ancient Egyptian ankh or the eye of Horus, but one of wider application than these had become. For this purpose, they adopted and adapted in a new form from their original home or from Egypt an old popular practice, that of the corn-figure, to make the Tanit sign whose cult they imported from the Lebanon. Cintas in fact points out than the earliest version of this symbol is headless, as in the Egyp tian form; further it is male and associated with Ba'al in the accompanying inscription.37 It seems that the corn figure of Ernutet was assimilated to the ankh, acquiring the loop head from the latter, the figure's hands being turned upwards as the ankh''s sometimes do, the whole being reduced by stylization to a geometrical abstract figure. In this way the Punic priesthood succeeded in taking under their wing the age-old rustic rite of the peasant agriculturalists of both regions, Egypt and Phoenicia, linking it with the worship of the female deity Tanit, to which was added the (to us obscure) pene Ba'al. This mysterious title they possibly de rived from a cult-figure evolved in the land of Palestine, since it appears as Phanebulos on coins of Ascalon of the 2nd century CE, referring to a male figure (111. 6).38 In Carthage at Salambo the combined cult figure of Tanit pene ba'al, now female from the 5th century BCE on, supersedes the worship of Ba'al himself. (I shall anticipate my 111. 6. Coins from Ascalon, reproduced by permission of the Trustees of the British Museum</page><page sequence="7">FROM ARAD TO CARTHAGE: HARVEST RITES AND CORN-DOLLIES 7* argument by remarking that such sexual ambiva lence is part and parcel of the history and nature of the corn-spirit.) This adaptation or annexation of the 'corn-dolly' or symbolic figure of the corn-spirit was particularly appropriate since it represented the survival of that spirit, the element of suste nance for mankind and its reprieve from death, which can be traced back in ritual texts to Ras Shamra-Ugarit and the struggle of Ba'al aided by his sister Anat. On stelae at Carthage, the 'Tanit sign' is often depicted in association with a variety of objects of daily life — boats, tools, ploughs, etc.;39 very com monly, however, it is shown associated with em blems suggesting fertility, such as corn stalks or plants, naturalistic or stylized, recalling the 'sacred tree'.40 It is also depicted not only on stelae, but on floor mosaics in the entrances of houses at Cap Bon, at Nora in Sardinia and at Delos.41 Most recently it has made its most notable appearance in the remarkable series of terracotta figurines of a girl in Greek style, discovered in the sea off the coast of Israel at Shave Zion near Haifa in 1972,42 where a ship carrying some hundreds of these figures, each marked with the 'Tanit sign', appears to have sunk possibly in a storm in the late 5th century BCE. It seems to me that the full significance of this find and of these figures has not been as yet fully appreciated. For the first time — and at an early date — the 'Tanit sign' is firmly associated with a figure who may be a goddess and indeed may even represent Tanit herself. If so, for the first time we may now learn how Tanit was supposed to look in the late 5th century BCE. She was visualized as a Greek girl or young woman, apparently in the early stages of pregnancy — a link both with ideas of fertility and with the tradition of the goddess Anat in Egyptian texts. The underwater discovery of this precious cargo of terracotta figures of Greek type also coincides neatly with the observation of the late Pierre Cintas, that after the great Carthaginian defeat in the Battle of Himera in 490 BCE, Carth age suffered a Greek invasion of religious as well as cultural character. This was reflected particularly in the cult of Tanit, who assumed the aspect of the Greek goddess Kore, the maiden Persephone, wor shipped in Sicily. Accordingly, we find that Greek terracottas representing a standing or seated figure as standardized in Sicily, were placed in Punic tombs at Carthage and elsewhere. The mythologi cal associations of the maiden Kore, her disappear ance, death and association with the underworld and re-emergence make her and her mother Demeter most appropriate figures for such funer ary purposes. The tradition of Tanit worship finally was strong enough in the Carthaginian countryside to survive the fall and destruction of Carthage at the hands of the Romans at the conclusion of the Second Punic War in 201 BCE. Tanit, now revived, became known and identified as Juno Caelestis.43 Numer ous inscribed neo-punic stelae, evidently originally 111. 7. Neo-Punic stela, BM 125102. Reproduced by per mission of the Trustees of the British Museum</page><page sequence="8">8* RICHARD D. BARNETT designed as grave stones, though most unfortu nately they are without archaeological contexts, survive from the Ghorfa, the rich corn-growing depression in the centre of northern Tunisia. They are ascribed to the 1st century BCE and the early Roman period.44 They are commonly inscribed in neo-punic script with dedications (still using the older punic formula) to 'the Lady, to Tanit pene Ba'al, to Ba'al Hammon', and are in the form of an often elaborately represented temple or naos facade. They may throw a little fresh light on the interpretation of the 'Tanit sign'. In the gable of the temple facade is shown the chief subject of the stela, a group of divine figures, the central one of which is easily recognizable as a development of the 'Tanit sign'. While still retaining her triangular base, Tanit is now equipped with garlanded head and arms extended to hold fruits of the earth or of the trees, the proofs of her abundant fruitfulness (111. 7). The ultimate derivation of this figure, now half-humanized, from the roughly schematic figure of the 'Tanit sign', is obvious. Indeed it is difficult to resist the belief that this figure is the represen tation of Tanit herself. The anthropomorphic deve lopment of head and arms tells us plainly at least that this is how the extremities of the symbol were by then understood, but we seem to be going back in time, for the distance from the Egyptian rep resentation in the tomb of Djeserkaresonb is not so great. Nevertheless, in due course Tanit-Juno Cae lestis and neo-punic Carthage passed into limbo and were forgotten in their turn. But the simple corn-dollies, it would appear, lived on. Conclusions Thirty years before Dalman, J.G. Frazer, the great doyen of British anthropology, published in three parts his classic masterpiece of comparative reli gion and ethnography, The Golden Bough (London 1890), and followed this up with Adonis, Attis and Osiris (London 1907). In The Golden Bough (with reference to the corn-mother in many lands) he describes the traditional harvest customs of Ger many, Austria, Galicia, Poland, Scandinavia, Rus sia, France, England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland. In the section entitled 'Lityerses' he discusses, too, the song of the Phrygian corn-reapers, the Phoeni cian Linus-dirge, and the killing of the corn-spirit. He notes that in these harvest practices there are no priests, no temples or sacred places: these are simple, rustic, magic rites performed directly by ordinary folk seeking to propitiate spirits rather than gods — and that is perhaps why they have survived throughout so many ages. We need not discuss Frazer's possible overstressing of the 'dying god' who is (he believes) slain, then resuscitated and revived in the Tammuz and Osiris stories. The recovery of Sumerian and Ugaritic literature have shown the picture to be slightly more complicated; the first at least has provided us now with a 'dying goddess'. It cannot be denied, however, that in so magisterially drawing together this vast material into a single whole, Frazer performed a unique service to learning and indeed deeply influenced modern thought in general; but in discussing the corn-figures and their part in harvest rites, and through dwelling only on the countries mentioned above, he gives us a somewhat unbalanced and unduly Europo-centric picture. It omits the modern peoples, both Semitic and non-Semitic, bordering on the Mediterranean and occupying the Near East today, although comparisons are appro priately instituted, in deference to good anthropo logical principles, with rice-growing customs in India and Malaya. Frazer after all based himself on materials published by others, and these areas of the Mediterranean littoral were and still are an almost untouched field. In fact my own modest enquiries have enlisted from other observers the evidence that corn-dollies are made and still are to some degree in use over a very much wider area even than that mentioned by Frazer. Nearly all of them are of the familiar must or 'comb type', though a spiral type also occurs (111. 8)45 We have them from Morocco,46 Tunisia,47 and Algeria48 (where the practice of making them is reported among the Berbers), in addition to those already cited from Egypt, Israel and Jordan. They are also known in Cyprus (111. 9)49 and can be followed across onto the mainland of Turkey.50 In Iraq they are encountered at Sheikh Adi, the traditional cult centre of the Yezidi sect of devil-worshippers (111. 10).51 In Iran they have been met in Azerbaijan52 and a 'woven-type' is reported to be used among the great tribe of Bakhtiaris53 who are partly settled as agriculturalists. The spiral type, however, is</page><page sequence="9">FROM ARAD TO CARTHAGE: HARVEST RITES AND CORN-DOLLIES 9* stated to be common among the Lurs.54 Thus, while there is much here which can be added to the distribution-map of the corn-dolly, one comes across some curious gaps. Corn figures, it appears, are unknown in Sicily, the very home of Demeter and Persephone.55 In nearby Malta, too, they are also absent, though other somewhat primitive fer tility practices survive there.56 For some other Mediterranean countries — Spain, Portugal, the Balearic Islands, Italy — I have no information except that it was formerly known in Reggio di Calabria. 1! 111. 8. 'Corn-dolly' from Greece (Photo D. Bahat) We have, I think, made clear the extraordinary conservativeness of the 'corn-dolly' and of the sur vival of certain predominant types.

Was there indeed such a carrier and when was it carried? It is to be suspected that it origi nated in the Late Neolithic or Chalcolithic period in the Near East, perhaps in Canaan itself. It is the view cautiously expressed by Winifred Blackman57 that the 'comb type' of'corn maiden' is to be traced back to Egypt as its distribution-centre in the Medi terranean area. This view certainly requires to be treated with respect, and indeed Egypt is admirably placed to have been an important centre of distri bution: how and when this was done and spread, by what steps and peoples, remains and is likely to remain somewhat of a mystery. a 111. 10.

" The Hebrew equivalent of the cutting of the last sheaf from which the corn-dolly is made is the 'wave-offering' of the first fruits which has to be cut on the first day of the work, i.e. on the 16th of the month (Leviticus 23:9-14). No part of the new crop is to be used until the offering to Yah weh has been made: the harvest festival takes place on completion of the corn harvest (cf. Numbers 28:26-31). "And when ye reap the harvest of your land, thou shalt not wholly reap the corners of thy field, neither shalt thou gather the gleaning of thy harvest" (Leviticus 23:22). " In eS-Söbak they add the words "min 'awäidki efina sälemin" ("we live from thy incoming") and ask one another for forgiveness "shmfiu ahjet"). 20 By this, as we shall see below, the 'corn-dolly' is meant. Unfortunately, Dalman gives no illustrations. Some Arabs call it a 'comb', others a 'cage'. 21 The originals are preserved in the Israel Museum, Eth nographical Department. I am obliged to Miriam Tadmor for the photographs, published here by courtesy of the Museum. In collecting this sort of material, the greatest importance must be attached to recording fully all infor mation about the use, or imagined use, the occasion, author ship of manufacture and any names, sayings, beliefs, traditions or customs connected with them. In this respect, as in others, the Pitt-Rivers Museum sets an excellent exam pie, elsewhere often ignored, noting whatever was known concerning the object on a label. Thus two excellent exam pies exist in the Palestine Exploration Fund's collection, but all information about them is lost. 22 Pitt-Rivers Museum (Oxford), 1898.29.5. Donated by F.T. Elworthy in 1898, and said to be the first fruits given to the landowner and hung up until next year. The Pitt-Rivers Museum has another example from Jericho, donated by O.G.S. Crawford in 1956. 22 Corn-dollies (it is rumoured) have been seen in recent years still in use in the Hebron and Mt. Carmel areas. 24 Gillian Hundt introduced me to Wadfa in March 1977 and interpreted for me. Thirty years ago Wadfa's father-in law had a large property and grew wheat, barley, beans and lentils, to harvest which some twenty families used to meet. The landowner took three-quarteri of the crop, and the reapers one quarter. The corn-dolly was made for baraka and was called mash( or diqnu (beard). It was never given a head or hands; she did not know of songs or sayings about it. Normally, it would appear, these figures are not made by bedouin. 25 N. de Garis Davies, The Tomb ofNakht at Thebes, New York 1917, PI. XX. 26 Ibid., Fig. 11 and p. 64, n. 3. 2' Winifred S. BLackman, 'Some occurrences of the corn 'araseh in ancient Egyptian tomb paintings,' JEA 8 (1922), pp. 235-240. 21 1933.58.24 from El-Lahun. An earlier corn-dolly in the same museum (1898.29.6) is said to go back in date to the harvest of 1896. It was presented by Mr F.T. Elworthy (in Miss Blackman's article his initials are mistakenly given as</page><page sequence="11">FROM ARAD TO CARTHAGE: HARVEST RITES AND CORN-DOLLIES 11* 'E.T.'). Unfortunately the only provenance given is 'Egypt', where it was said to be "hung over the doorway in Arab house till following year, then burnt". I know of no surviving corn dolly of earlier date than this. I owe this and the following details from museum records to Lynne Williamson. 29 1898.29.4 from Larnaca, Cyprus. 30 An example was kindly presented to me by Vronwy Hankey, and another example was shown to me by J. Ruffle, Gulbenkian Museum of Oriental Art, Durham. 51 It has been shown that the correct vocalization of TNT is probably Tinit or Tennit, (cf. Albright, Yahweh and the gods of Canaan, Winona Lake 1968, p. 135, n. 63), but I have retained nevertheless the customary if incorrect rendering for the sake of convenience. 32 M. Dothan, 'A sign of Tanit from Tel 'Akko,' IEJ 24 (1974), pp. 44-49. This example of the 'Tanit sign' has a smaller version of itself stamped inside the triangle. 33 This derivation of mine of the Tanit symbol from a corn-dolly differs from that of other scholars. Cintas, in a sketch of its history, cf. 'The sign of Tanit,' Archaeologia Viva, 1,2(1968-69), pp. 4-10, points out that the name 'sign of Tanit', which goes back to Clermont-Ganneau (1909), has assumed an association with that deity that was not really justified. Lagrange and others wished to see in it a represen tation of the conical stone of Astarte. Ronzevalle derived it from the ankh. Cintas considers that it embraces five or more different derivations combined and hospitably accepts them all: "From its first appearance the symbol was complete ... comprising all the allusions the scholars have deduced, all of which are well-grounded, but above all permitting the further inclusion in its design of the whole oecumenical repertoire of representational imagery The cast of mind which tries to combat the greatest number of evils simultaneously by pit ting against them an array of different protective powers, sometimes highly complex, is at the heart of pentacular practice". To this complex of diverse elements we may now, I suggest, add the 'corn-dolly' or 'corn-maiden'. In the 'Tanit sign' Cintas would thus see a generalized magic symbol not specifically attached to Tanit. 34 Cintas (/oc. cit.) points out that the 'Tanit symbol' (which he denies is a symbol of 'Tanit' at all) appears at the shrine of Baal Addir and Baal Hammon at Constantine where it would appear Tanit was not specifically worshipped. 33 E.g. by Dothan, loc. cit. (above, n. 32). 36 Herodotus IV, 199. 37 Cintas, loc. cit. (above, n. 33), Fig. 15. Cintas points out that it is in this period in the 5th century BCE that Tanit (who, in his view, "appears to be the result of an ill-defined African syncretism") began to take over and ultimately annex the sanctuary at Carthage, which had hitherto belonged to Baal Hammon. I believe that this takeover can be explained by the title pene Baal which I translate "appear ance of Baal" and refers to Anath's appropriation of Baal's weapons of war.

Pre sented by F.T. Elworthy in 1898. Hung in the entrance to a house of the landowner. Taken down and given to F.T.E. because the harvest was nearly ripe and another would soon be made. b) Cyprus Folk Art Museum. A. Diamantis, the curator, kindly informed me (25.5.1976) that it is still in use, but chiefly in the Mesaoria plain where corn is abundant. It is made from the best crop and is used to decorate the house, especially to commemorate the year when the harvest is good. It has no religious meaning. 30 From Kusadase, spiral type ; from Samsun or Trabzon, must type; from Bilecik, must type. All obtained in 1967, collection of Peter Andrews. 31 Collection of Jeffrey Orchard, Birmingham. 32 Collection of Peter Andrews, obtained in 1974. 33 Information from David Brooks (Durham University). Mr. Brooks kindly informed me that among the Bakhtiaris on the Isfahan side the last person to bring in the wheat from the field has to provide a funereal feast, i.e. is held guilty for killing the corn. Also, at the beginning of the harvest the Bakhtiaris hum a song apologizing for killing the corn while the women turn in a circle to avert ill-luck. 34 Information from D. Bradshaw. See also C.G. Feilberg, Les Papis, Copenhagen 1939. 33 Information from Professor Antonio Uccello, Pitre Museum, Palermo. 34 After the harvest, the fields are ploughed and manured; an upright phallic symbol is made out of manure and left for the rains to wash into the fields. It is called arus (?bride groom). Information from J. Caesar Pullicino, Valletta. 37 Blackman, loc. cit. (above, n. 27).</page></plain_text>
