<plain_text><page sequence="1">verse Pierre Emmanuel. Sophia, Paris. Seuil. 1973. 432 pages. Sophia crystallizes the "Unite Diversite" which characterizes Pierre Emmanuel's quest for the unification of heaven and earth through a poetic transfiguration of man. While Sophia means Divine Wisdom and Supreme Virtue on a primary level, the image also personifies a fusion of the two tradition- al aspects of woman: on the one hand, Sophia is Eve, the mother of things, the temptress of man into sin, yet as the first woman created she remains the thought of a loving God; on the other hand, Sophia is Mary, the mother of souls, who rehabilitates Eve by giving birth to the Incarnate Word and is thereby capable of God. Sophia as the base and the pure, the emotional and moral is metamor- phosized beyond the biblical Eve and Mary into concrete anthropomorphic woman; union with woman echoes the source of all creation and unity: Je suis le germe Qui depuis l'origine Cherche . . . Une chair celeste Sophia Firmament interne De Dieu Voila ce qu'il veut par moi dans les femmes # Attendre de . . . naitre De toi. The 93 texts of Sophia are arranged accord- ing to seven sections whose titles are drawn from various parts of a cathedral: "Porche," or entry which depicts the seven days of Cre- ation; "Tympan," the panel which relates the fall of man and his second origin in sin; "Abside," the projecting part of the choir where Mary is juxtaposed with Eve; "Choeur" in praise of Mary, Mother of God; "Dome," a prayer by which man seeks redemption; "Nef," introduction of real woman; "Rosace," the glorious reconciliation of flesh and immor- tality. These subdivisions recall the byzantine cathedral, Santa Sophia, dedicated to Divine Wisdom, and, by extension, they refer to the universality of the Church as Mother, which in turn represents an opening to heaven. Sophia may well be Emmanuel's most beautiful and most lyric consecration of hu- man transcendence: "Toi Moi." Virginia A. La Charite University of Kentucky</page></plain_text>
