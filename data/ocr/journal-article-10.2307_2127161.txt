<plain_text><page sequence="1">VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA* LEE S. GREENE The University of Tennessee AS IN ALL THINGS, there are fashions in the presidential address. One of its most essential and proper features is the practice of opening with some degree of personal deprecation. In truth, this is a sort of insurance, a form of hedging, for if humility is not voluntarily assumed by the deliverer it will most probably be en- forced upon him by his audience, no matter how great the courtesy shown. And so I begin, appropriately, with apologies, delivered no doubt, as most apologies are, with a certain degree of insincerity. In embarking upon this particular subject this evening I am aware that I run the risk of finally saying with Falstaff, "I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass." This is a risk assumed- or so I do justify myself-by all who assume this office, and it is a fate which I accept the more willingly in that I have felt keenly what I am about to say. I compound my felonies, by necessity, by speaking without full knowledge, informed principally by my own experience. I realize, too, that almost every sentence that follows is an over-simplification. This is part of the enigma. I address myself this evening to the problems of liberal edu- cation, to the role and future of the liberal arts college, to the politics of universities, and the character of vocational training. We are all, or nearly all, as political scientists, bound up with the liberal arts college. This attachment is more than a mere structural imprisonment. Most of us, I assume, are also attached to the view- points of the liberal arts college. In any event, we are not indifferent to its future. It would be very convenient if this presidential address could be equipped with a crisis. Any respectable crusader, with a little experience, can find a crisis handy. But let us not say that the liberal arts college faces a crisis. Let us merely say that its condition occasions a certain anxiety, a condition partially concealed by generally increasing enrollments everywhere. Let us suggest only that the effective survival of the liberal arts college may call for some adjustments in viewpoints. *The Presidental address, delivered before the Southern Political Science Association at Gatlinburg, Tennessee, November 7. 1958. [ 179 ]</page><page sequence="2">180 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [Vol. 21 Our liberal arts college is a rather fuzzy institution and the aims and purposes of liberal arts education remain obscure and uncer- tain. Attempts to define the liberal arts are generally lacking in specificity and are, therefore, at least to me, quite unsatisfactory. In my view, the liberal arts college does not hold to a particular version of goals. Instead, very mixed motives guide its faculties and students. In our day, the typical liberal arts college is composed of the natural sciences, the social sciences, and the humanities, although this classification, like most classifications, presents some embarrass- ments. TIhere are bonds within the liberal arts college which make for unity, but divisions also exist. Such divisions are understandable, and perhaps inevitable, for some very diverse interests and goals are forced to remain in the liberal arts alliance. I submit, first of all, that the goal of the natural sciences is primarily a vocational one. The natural scientists are hell-bent (perhaps a true word) on the training of scientists. I do not much believe in their claim to truth for truth's sake. Their wide-ranging curiosity undoubtedly exists, but, in addition, has always had, I suspect, and still has, the ever- increasing mastery of nature for its goal and the support which the natural sciences draw from the general public is based upon the hope that this mastery will be forthcoming. The social sciences share, to some extent, this concern for utilitarian goals. The recent publication, National Support for Behavorial Science,' is filled with pleas for, and proofs of, the immediate usefulness of the behaviorists' findings. Indeed, the very origins of modern science were vocational, for, revolting against unrestricted rationalism, it found roots in a union of experiment, thinking, and handcraftsmanship. The approach of the natural scientist to the provision of a so-called liberal edu- cation is to require all candidates for the liberal degree to spend two years in the laboratory learning the rudiments of the methodol- ogy which has burst his own bonds asunder. The natural scientists are not, apparently, unsure of themselves. Their approach is by no means passive or contemplative. Students are not taught to "appreciate" the scientific achievements of others. On the contrary, they are expected to spend substantial portions of their time in performing experiments and learning the craftsman- lIssued by a group of leaders in various fields in pamphlet form, dated February, 1958.</page><page sequence="3">1959] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 181 ship of the field. General education is a by-product. Were the same approach taken to music and art, all liberal art students would be practicing scales and wielding brush or pencil. The liberal arts fields loosely labeled the humanities are less sure of their grounds. Unable to resist completely the glamor of the specific they put forth occasional claims to usefulness. One large and supposedly secular university suggests in its catalogue that language courses have, among other things, the objective of meeting "the practical needs of future teachers, businessmen, missionaries, and government workers." That the teaching of one's own language has a vocational pur- pose can certainly be demonstrated by many documents-from student themes to presidential addresses. But this limited and rather vague vocational attraction is insufficient to support the curriculum requirements of the humanities and they seek to justify their fields by values more generally expressed-as in the words "liberal edu- cation," "broad background," "the cultivated person," and so on. Defenders of liberal arts education are often forced into such generalities, a position which many undergraduates and their parents must find extraordinarily inadequate in view of the sacrifices which educational costs place upon them. I think it is interesting, in this connection, to explore the psychology of the artist as represented by the musician. The musi- cian does not seem to me much troubled by a need to justify his existence. His attitude is one of curious self-satisfaction. Somerset Maugham pictures this well in his story, Tke Alien Corn. In this tale Lea Makart, a concert pianist, says, speaking to an ambitious amateur: "Art is the only thing that matters. In comparison with art, wealth and rank and power are not worth a row of pins . . . [Artists] are the only people who count. We give the world significance...." Or, put more poetically: "All passes. Art alone en- during stays to us. The bust outlasts the throne; the coin, Tiberius." A somewhat different concept of the arts is disclosed by the author of the section on insects in the Encyclopaedia Britannica: In the protoplasmic organic world the male has developed in both plant and animal kingdoms. . . . He is needed, but in animals at large is useful only once, at mating. . . . The problem of the male is a real one in the animal world. In most birds he inherits mother care of the young and helps in domestic affairs.... In Homo sapiens he disposes of his excess energy in art, science, literature, horse racing and war....2 2Encyclopaedia Britannica, 1956, XII, 417C.</page><page sequence="4">182 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [ Vol. 21 Views of the purpose of art vary, but to the artist a vague pretense of moral or spiritual values seems unnecessary. The study of a literature, or better still, the production of literature, or its performance, can have a sufficient justification in pleasure. But this has not seemed sufficient to the embattled humanities. They have shored up their case for existence by claims of being the mechanism for conveying knowledge. The scientists seem to have escaped from those claims quite thoroughly. No one now claims to teach natural science effectively by the study of great literature. That this was not always so is reiterated by the recent book A History of Educa- tion in Antiquity by H. I. Marrou. I rely on a review by James R. Newman in Scientific American. In the Hellenistic era according to the reviewer education was conceived as something more than a technique for fitting a child to be a man; it was a lifelong dedication to the supreme values of culture and to self-realization. "The higher Hellenistic culture," writes Marrou, "remained faithful to the archaic tradition and based itself on poetry, not science." This is reflected in secondary and higher education whose principal aim was not so much "to develop the reason faculty as to hand on its literary heritage of great masterpieces." [As the] Greco-Roman period advanced, literature began to elbow out the sciences. Marrou states that in the end mathmatics was practically eliminated from the secondary-chool syllabus. . . . Even in the teaching of astronomy, science was invaded by the "literary grammarian." The most popular text in the field was not any one of the several straightforward astronomical handbooks which were available, but a poem of 1,154 hexameters by Aratus of Soli. ... His poem has no mathematics, no numbers and very little of astronomical theory. It is mainly descriptive, and its explanations of planetary motions and kindred phenomena are anthropomorphic. It also con- tains numerous errors of observation.3 Natural science is no longer taught in this manner. Social science, however, still has strong ties to literature as literature and the humanities teacher often makes claims to afford the student a view of life which goes beyond the realm of beauty and pleasure and which pretends to provide a knowledge of the social studies. Knowledge of artistic endeavors can, of course, add to one's grasp of a particular kind of society, although whether this contributes to a science of society may be open to question. But I am convinced that a science of society cannot be built out of a practice of an art 3Scientific Anmerican, CIXVII (November, 1957), 165ff.</page><page sequence="5">1959 ] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 183 nor can it be secured from the reading of a literature alone. The agreeable sounds which make up a Strauss tone poem convey no more, by themselves, than a pleasing emotional state. As Bernstein says, the real meaning of the opening bars of the Fifth Symphony is simply-Ba, ba, bmmm.4 The liberal arts college is an outgrowth of a kind of society. Like other institutions it must live in a society and it must, in order to survive, adapt, to some degree, at least, to that society. I assume that an educational system must have a relationship with the economic and social system within which it operates. It would be most difficult and probably foolhardy to lay down hard and fast dogma regarding this relationship. I can conceive that an educational system may be deliberately designed either to bring about or con- tinue a revolutionary trend in a society. It may be designed to meet the needs of one which is fairly stable. Most commonly, I judge, it may tend to perpetuate a society which is passing away. Like generals, the educators may be preparing to fight a war al- ready passed. Political scientists as educators must conduct their activities within the society in which they are placed. In the setting in which we find ourselves the decision-maker (whoever this mysterious per- sonage may be) will insist that youngsters receive preparation in the skills supposed to be useful. Lip-service, certainly, will be paid to the provision of "cultural" education, and there is good reason! to believe that something more than mere lip-service will be secured. Indeed, our economy should permit a great deal of non-vocational work. If we do not see a crisis in the liberal arts college, and I have firmly denied myself the solace of a crisis, still we must admit that all is not well. Somehow the liberal arts college has not fully met the demands made upon it. Many will say that the demands have been too great, that many persons now seeking degrees have no business in college. This may be true, but it is beside the point. We have moved towards a large college enrollment. We are a degree- collecting society. Manipulative skills of all sorts have been fitted to the pattern of letter-collecting. Pianists have long since become 4Henry Brandon, "A Conversation with Leonard Bernstein," The New Re- public, (June 9, 1958), p. 16.

Office personnel have become bachelors of office administration. We ourselves have left the history departments, while the historians themselves have forgotten the comparative recency of their own academic halos. This is the same type of up- grading which has made public relations personnel out of press agents and given us humane officers in place of dogcatchers. In becoming a degree-collecting society, the pursuit of the vocational has by no means been abandoned. Young Americans have insisted and will continue to insist on going to college and at the same time preparing for almost immediate earning power. For various reasons the demand for vocational preparation could not be met in the liberal arts college. Itself once instituted to prepare for a few professions, the college was unable or unwilling to accommodate itself to new pressures. Academic administrators found it desirable to create new specialized schools, divorced from the old liberal arts college. This process has been going on a long time, and it is by no means complete. Typically the liberal arts faculties and their friends have a vast contempt for the professional schools. The words "practical" and "vocational" in the liberal arts field are terms of disdain and dis- approbation. There are, of course, exceptions. The obvious difficulty of engineering and medical subjects lends them a respectability which other professional schools have not attained. On the other hand, business administration colleges, agricultural and home eco- nomics schools, journalism schools, and, above all, colleges of edu- cation receive the full force of the animosity and suspicion of the liberal arts college. In some respects the liberal arts approach to education tends to be a contemplative and passive approach. This strikes me most forcibly in the attitude towards music and art, two subject-matter fields which are latecomers to the American colleges. When they first appear in a particular institution they are likely to be attached for want of a better place to the liberal arts college, where their presence is by no means universally welcomed. Liberal arts spokes- men are uncomfortably aware that the "well-rounded" persons which the colleges attempt to produce should know something of music and pictorial art. What they are to know, however, is to be produced by observing, not by participating. Music and art appre- ciation courses are seen as sufficient for the purposes of the liberal</page><page sequence="7">1959] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 185 arts college. It does not seem to occur to those who hold these views that the practitioner of art is necessary to provide the basis of appreciation nor that real appreciation is possible only by some degree of actual participation. The passive view of education ob- viously cannot satisfy the needs of the student who wishes to do something. Let us pass for the moment the question of the rightness or wrongness of the liberal arts viewpoint. Looking at the matter from the crass attitude of voting-power, it is evident that the liberal arts have lost a major portion of their political strength. University government is characterized by a struggle between the so-called administration and the faculty. Where the faculty is triumphant or partially triumphant, the resulting scheme is presumed to be democratic, but more realistically viewed, the typical university is like the United Nations without the -benefit of a charter, a struggle of ill-defined, shifting, and unstable power-groups busily manufac- turing curricula and struggling for budgets. Educational requirements are not imposed exclusively as the result of a careful study of needs and means. They are set forth in part as a consequence of the activities of the political machines of the academic world. These machines or groupings, for the word machine implies a submergence of individuality which is not readily achieved among academicians, work within the framework set by the organizational structure of the academic institution. In the power structure of the university, there is little to offset the in- dependent power of each individual school. Few presidents or vice- presidents are powerful or knowledgeable enough to resist the cur- riculum demands of the individual school. Academic committees and senates have proved generally unavailing; they tend to become diplo- matic assemblies where it is bad form and bad politics to resist too forcibly the curriculum proposals of one's colleagues. Curriculum- building in such circumstances becomes a caucus race at whose conclusion the Dodo awards a prize to everyone. Of course, it would be an exaggeration to say that in the edu- cational struggle the consumer, that is to say, the student, is forgot- ten. It is in his name that changes are made and policies adopted. It would be a cynical view, indeed, which held that the needs of student and society received no attention in curriculum planning. Still, the student is without formal representation. He must mnake his will felt by the techniques of the market place. In such circum-</page><page sequence="8">186 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [ Vol. 21 stances students, faced in the liberal arts college with the deter- mined efforts of entrenched, independent, and virtually ungoverned pressure-groups to maintain the traditional scheme of higher educa- tion, have moved out in droves. William Whyte disapprovingly describes this trend in the follow- ing words: It is among undergraduates that the business bias against the liberal arts sets up the most far-reaching chain of consequences. When the upper-classman finds at first hand that the recruiters prefer men with the technical specialties, the word gets around the campus very quickly indeed. To the freshmen and sophomores who are pondering a choice of major, this is the real world talking. Why, then, the liberal arts? Sales work, they hear, is about the only slot they would qualify for if they took English or history or politics or such, and they have the strong feeling, not entirely erroneous, that the offer is made only because the recruiters can't interest the preferred ones in sales. So they listen politely when an occasional alumnus or speaker at a career- counseling meeting speaks glowingly of the liberal arts and the full man, the need for culture, and so on. Then they go sign up for some- thing practical . . . At the rate things are going, it would seem, liberal arts is well on its way toward being made into a specialty- a preprofessional training considered useful only for those who intend to lead the gentle life.5 The vocationally directed student and his advisors are not, of course, completely resistant to cultural education. However, the student in the professional school gets only a limited degree of contact with the cultural subjects and this in the form of a rather hurried hodge-podge forced on him by the self-denial of accrediting organizations and associations of schools, such as the American Association of Collegiate Schools of Business and other similar bodies. It is rather doubtful whether individual schools by them- selves could resist the pressure for further professionalization. Once he has departed from the lower division courses in the liberal arts college, the future leader of business and the professions seldom returns for more. Indeed he probably cannot, for his schedule is crammed to the gunnels with business administration and other professional cargo. The demands of the liberal arts curriculum are such that pro- fessionally minded aspirants for degrees are often forced out. An example can be found in the preparation for music performance. I question whether there has ever been a time when the Western 'William H. Whyte, Jr., The Organization Man (New York, 1956), pp. 104, 105.</page><page sequence="9">1959 ] VTARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 187 world was as filled as now with top-notch musical performers. As Rachmaninoff once said, with a certain air of desperation, "Nowa- days everyone plays the piano." Technical competence in musical performance, like certain sports, has been driven towards the very acme of perfection. The young person who enters music faces this type of unrelenting competition. Under such circumstances, he can- not spend much time in cultural or liberal subjects. Music depart- ments, for this reason, will inevitably free themselves from the restrictions of liberal arts. Quite aside from the question of the values which should be observed in curriculum building the battle of the liberal arts college was lost when separate schools of professional character were allowed to secede. Power structures have been created in which the liberal arts colleges no longer hold the majority place; they can be and are readily outvoted by professional schools which are politically in- formed and self-conscious. The colleges of education furnish an unusually appropriate illustration, for their curricula and standards are under general "sniping," not only from the traditionalists within the breached and battered ivory towers, but from the public at large. Yet the colleges of education have entrenched themselves and their friends in highly strategic spots. They occupy the teaching profession, the schools' administrative posts, and, frequently, positions of power in uni- versities. From these positions they have drawn students not only from the liberal arts colleges, but from other professional schools. What has happened, in various places, to music education is a case in point. I shall be greatly astonished if the bastions of the education colleges fall, even under the most vigorous assaults. Only limited changes can be expected and probably then only under considerable and prolonged pressure. The political weakness of the liberal arts college is made greater by the divisions within the college itself. As the liberal arts college is lacking in a common purpose, it also lacks a common clientele or common interest groups. The typical music school con- tains students united by a common interest in ordered sound. The engineers and the agricultural schools have common professional outlooks which assist them, although, it must be admitted, such assistance can turn into domination. Business schools have fairly clearly realized clienteles, avenues of placement, and alumni con- nections. The liberal arts college has no unifying forces of this kind</page><page sequence="10">188 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [ Vol. 21 and most attempts to produce them are utter failures. Rather, the liberal arts college is typically a group of self-conscious, assertive, and vocationally inclined natural scientists (on whose abilities and training we are dependent, as is all too clearly apparent), a group of humanities with vague aspirations and an uncertain future, and the social scientists, divorced organizationally from their natural colleagues and uncertain of their aims. Now, I think I am aware that the picture I have drawn is more likely to be true of large univer- sities, perhaps particularly of state universities, than of the smaller colleges which are either exclusively or primarily liberal arts in- stitutions. It certainly does appear that the small institutions, con- taining, among their numbers, places of outstanding quality and outlook, will exercise an influence on American higher education out of proportion to their enrollment. Nevertheless, the proportions of students attending small colleges of excellence will probably decline because of restrictions of enrollment. The universities which do not practice -restrictions will exercise, through sheer size, an enormous influence on American education. The smaller colleges are by no means immune to the pressure for vocationalism. It is evident even to the proponents of liberal education that jobs must be found. Sometimes a solution is found by advising the liberal arts graduate to do further work, but some of the independent liberal arts colleges, particularly the weaker in- stitutions, have attempted to set up schemes combining some years of the liberal arts with pursuit of professional courses elsewhere. Such attempts generally result in five- or six-year schemes of education. The careers and the teaching opportunities of political scientists have grown up inside the liberal arts college and continue to be centered there. Perhaps we could say that the discipline is im- prisoned there. Attempts to create special schools of political science, government, or citizenship have not caught on widely. In a few instances separate departments or degrees in public administration have been tried, but even these activities have engendered or exacer- bated animosities. In 1951, a committee of the American Political Science Associa- tion attempted to ascertain the goals of political science and a volume under this title was issued. In spite of some criticism, I believe the volume, whatever its shortcomnings, may be taken as representing the views of many of our colleagues. This book states flatly, "The training of citizens is one of the major goals of Ameri-</page><page sequence="11">1959] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 189 can political science."6 It is evident that such an admission brings a feeling of unclean discomfort to some of our colleagues, but, nevertheless, this remains, I think, an acceptable goal. Chapter IV of this same report begins: "In a world in which the art and sci- ence of government bear such heavy responsibilities for the good or evil of human relations, the training of future governmental leaders takes on a significance which yields to nothing in relative impor- tance."7 Although this particular book gave little attention to a matter which has increasingly captured the attention of political sciences, namely, the creation and development of a science and a discipline which, many feel, is now full of holes, such creation and development remains a major goal. Thus, three possible justifica- tions can be established for our field, as a teaching discipline; namely, the development of a science, the training of practitioners of this science, and the general education of citizens. Whether or not the study of politics can be a science, what kind of science it can be, and what methods should be used in its de- velopment are all questions which have, in our profession, been debated with considerable spirit. At the moment, I do not wish to add to this debate. I should think we could agree, leaving aside questions of methodology for the moment, that we think it desirable to extend the frontiers of knowledge in our field. We should be compelled to agree, also, I should think, that the research in this field must be carried on with heavy reliance upon persons who teach. In spite of the increasing role of foundations, they are not yet a substitute for the college and university budget. Government support, aside from the teaching budget, is a long way distant, and may in any case be undesirable. Industrial or other private support seems unlikely. The teaching budget, as well as the research budget, is depend- ent upon enrollment. From this view alone, a substantial number of customers is an economic necessity. But the case for students is not based upon this alone. The political scientist has something to give the student. Any political scientist who has had much to do with the general public, including its supposed leaders, will realize rather quickly that the extent of information and knowledge of govern- mental procedures, ideal or actual, is remarkably limited.

Generally speaking, it seems to me that political scientists are rather modest in their attempts to remedy this situation. They do not make extensive claims to cures, which is probably just as well, but they are also rather circumspect in pressing for academic requirements in their field. Their success in achieving such requirements is also limited, although some of this is attributable, no doubt, not to personal modesty, but to an unfortunately weak position politically. At present, great masses of university and college students are being graduated annually with little or no contact with courses in government. Some of the professional schools, such as engineering and home economics, rarely send students into government classes. This is particularly significant in the case of engineers, for their work is of a kind which frequently throws them into situations where they will affect or make governmental decisions. Engineers seem to feel the lack of training in letters and the humanities more keenly than they sense deficiencies in the social studies. Other fields, such as agriculture, business administration, and education will get tastes, at least, of the beginning course in government but not too much more. In the liberal arts college itself the government course often shares a competitive place with other social sciences, so that even the so-called "broadly educated" person may have had no contact with governmental questions. It does not make sense, in our society, in my judgment, that this "broadly educated" person should spend two or three years on a foreign language and a year on European history and no time at all studying his own govern- ment. Political scientists are, for the most part, engaged in teaching a subject for which there is no employment outside of further teaching. In such a case, our justification for existence must be found, teaching-wise, in the contribution we may make to the general education of persons who specialize, vocationally, in other fields. Political scientists have attempted to establish a beachhead, in a vocational sense, in the training of governmental servants, and in the training of a fringe of persons who can fill research posts for private agencies. But the claim of political scientists to this field was not easily established and is not easily maintained. The con- tributions of political science in this area are not exactly disputed</page><page sequence="13">1959] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 191 by other disciplines; they are merely disregarded-by business administration colleges, by engineers, by psychologists, and by lawyers. One might say, especially by lawyers. Jacob Viner has noted that the lawyer is not only on tap but on top. Lawyers, he says are omnipresent, omniscient, omnipotent, and omniverous.8 Furthermore, the attempts of certain political scientists to carve out a vocational domain in this general field have met with not a little opposition from other wings of political science itself, whether from attachment to an older literary tradition or because of pre- occupation with the establishment of a new and more precise science. Altogether, the would-be vocationalists have not had an easy time of it. I think it plain that the liberal arts college is in a position of weakness and I believe this weak position is shared by political science. But what to do. I, like others, find it easier to consume time in expressions of dissatisfaction than to call up proposals for remedy. But, a sense of obligation compels me beyond the stage of merely adverse comments. However critical of so-called "liberal" ideals my remarks may have sounded, I do not, in fact, deny the importance of much that is contained in the liberal arts curriculum. It is not possible to lose complete contact with the concepts and problems which lie at the base of the activities of the so-called practical and vocational. Any sensible reform of university aims and structure must maintain what is essential and basic in the scheme of education. Indeed, the need to save essential elements furnishes the most pressing reason for seeking reform. But we need to reassess the values and contributions of the liberal arts curriculum. As matters now stand only a fraction, per- haps an increasingly smaller fraction, of the student body secures what the arts college is supposed to offer. Of the fraction who secure the A.B. degree, a considerable number are thinly disguised vo- cationalists, a certain number are seeking a general education, and all too many are there simply because they do not know what else to do. This does not seem to me to be a healthy situation. I know quite well that voices are raised today in increasing volume demanding a limitation of the numbers who seek an edu- cation. I confess a distaste for this approach. Granting that not all 8Jacob Viner, "The Short View and the Long in Economic Policy," in The Long View and the Short: Studies in Economic Theory and Policy (Glen- coe, 1958), p. 109.</page><page sequence="14">192 THE JOURNAL OFI POLITICS [ Vol. 21 persons are capable of absorbing a college education, I still cannot accept the notion that, in our society, a specially favored class (and I say favored, not gifted) should be broadly educated and the remainder left untouched by the process. The liberal arts college can scarcely turn aside from the demands of our population unless it expects to be neglected. At the same time, I do not believe that we can expect or demand that the great mass of our students will spend four years in purely cultural, non-vocational pursuits, however much educators may insist upon a broad background. The young student of 20 or 21 will not willingly spend too many added years in education. He wants to be in a position to make a living, to marry, and to establish a family. In this respect, I am sure, he does not differ from students the world over. Too often the attitude of the liberal arts professor or admini- strator has been one of insisting that four full years be given to general education, with the professional school tacked on as an addition. Even the combined degrees such as A.B-LL.B. are widely regarded in the liberal arts college as bastardized programs, to be tolerated, as bastards are, but by no means encouraged. A burden is transferred, by lengthening degree programs, to students and parents, which they are ill-equipped to bear and which they will avoid, if they can. Yet even the vocationalists themselves are willing to recognize some values in so-called broad backgrounds. I do not place much stock in the pious talk of corporation presidents in such matters for their words are clearly belied by the actions of their personnel departments, but I do believe that students and teachers, as well as society generally, are willing to keep in the vocational curriculum some degree of general education. We have the problem of selecting what must be in this so-called "general" category and of making it an effective part of the total educational program. The realm of knowledge has grown incredibly vast, and friend- less, indeed, are the subjects which cannot find some defenders. In a recent article entitled "Atoms with Hooks and Eyes,"9 Werner 9Werner Heisenberg, "Atoms with Hooks and Eyes: Thoughts on Humanis- tic Education, Science, and Western Culture," published in a pamphlet entitled Four Essays on Germany prepared in honor of the visit of President Heuss to the United States and Canada, June, 1958. This is a translation by Richard and Clara Winston of an essay in the Deutsche Encyklopddie, Vol. 8, under the title Das Naturbild der heutigen Physik, published by Rowahlt Verlag, Hamburg.</page><page sequence="15">1959] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 193 Heisenberg praises a classical education as a foundation for the study of modern science and suggests strongly that the modem scientist should be familiar with Greek. But I do not believe we can keep all of the vast accumulation of the past in our scheme of edu- cation. The possibility of creating a generally educated individual is, in the circumstances of our day, exceedingly doubtful. In any case, we would do well to restudy our concepts of what is basically valuable educationally. Both at the high school and college level the current furor over education has generally resulted in proposals which do not greatly differ from what has heretofore been advocated. As I read them, the recent proposals for federal scholarships lay heavy emphasis on natural science and foreign language. This seems to me a mere thoughtless repetition of past practices. I think we have to admit that it is difficult to justify some of the current and traditional requirements. Proficiency in our own language would be generally admitted as a requirement, I should suppose. Recently we have had a rash of proposals to stiffen the foreign language requirements. The foreign language at the college level (and apparently at the high school level, as well) seems to be viewed not only as a desirable cultural addition, but also and per- haps especially as a way of weeding out the untalented. I have failed completely to sense the justification for the foreign language requirement, widely applied. If an obstacle to degree-getting is sought, any number of difficult courses may be instituted. A moder- ately stiff course in constitutional law would have excellent "weed- ing-out" properties and certainly would appear to be widely needed in the United States. As a tool the foreign language is generally not useful in this country. Where it is useful as a tool it can be acquired by those who need it, but this is quite a different matter from generally insisting upon it. The importance of mathematics and science to our society's survival is sufficient warrant for seeking out and training all those who are capable of and can be interested in this training. The discovery of talent may cause us to institute rather broad requirements in these fields, but again this is a better reason for the action than a blanket insistence that everyone should have this particular diet. On the other hand, our society is such that a wide-spread understanding of the social studies is highly desirable. So far, these have lagged in the respect of the community as ele- ments in the scheme of education, as recent federal legislation all too clearly indicates.</page><page sequence="16">194 THE JOURNAL OF POLITICS [ Vol. 21 The kind of education offered by liberal arts colleges is supposed to give "breadth." Educational issues like other issues can be ob- fuscated by a choice of words with emotional overtones, as political scientists, above others, should certainly understand. In the field of education, "breadth," "depth," "culture," "liberal" and the like are plus words and those who have or seek such are on the side of the righteous. "Vocationalism," "training," and their kind are bad; the devotees or practitioners in these quarters have been thoroughly "sold" on their own unworthiness. They are aware that they are really educational lepers even though their sores are clothed in the raiment of academic degrees. I should prefer to forget such words, in an attempt to seek a clearer approach to goals. They are emotionally charged and they do not promote understanding. The word "breadth" is a term fairly devoid of precise meaning. A musician, to be thoroughly competent, should play an instrument, perhaps two, should be able to sing, to read orchestral scores, to conduct, to write harmony and counter- point, to arrange for orchestra and chorus-altogether a fairly large-sized demand. Yet musicians are generally supposed to be "narrow"; they have even convinced themselves that they are "narrow." On the other hand, the man trained in languages and written expression is assumed to be broadly educated, even though his knowledge of music is limited to purely passive pleasure in sound. This distinction seems to me absurd. Any attempt on the part of any group to choose certain areas of knowledge and to maintain that these constitute the core of an education seems to me foredoomed to failure. We would do better, I think, to abandon the notion of the cultivated man and to ask instead what is useful, not in the im- mediate money-making sense alone, although one must live, first of all, but useful for the preservation of society, and useful in terms of enjoying life. With standards of this sort, I think a new per- spective can be found towards requirements and electives and, without worrying at all about accusations of special pleading, I say that the social sciences would loom much larger in such an approach. I should, if I were recasting the university curriculum, take a new approach to the relationship of the strictly vocational and the non-vocational. The vocational schools often require a year or so of background material. This is true of the schools of business ad- ministration of law, and of medicine. In -this scheme education is</page><page sequence="17">1959] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 195 divided sharply into the pre-vocational and the vocational. Were I able to recast this scheme, I should mingle the two elements more closely, without a sharp division in time, and even without sharp divisions in courses. Separation of the pure and the applied has had evident attrac- tions for some college administrators. The separation of the applied has helped give rise to Schools of Social Work, to Schools of Public Administration, Schools of Hospital Administration, and other types of similar ventures. The separation in our own field is exemplified principally by the division between political science and public administration. Impulses towards such separation are perhaps inevitable in the diverse aims of individual teachers, in their differing personalities, and their diverse connections with the non-academic world. But to reinforce these divergencies by an organizational separation seems to me to be an unsound policy. Under such circumstances, the theoretician, cut off from work-a-day problems and frustrated be- cause the non-academic world rejects or disregards him, submerges himself in the narrow group of his fellows, united in their contempt for the practical world. The practitioner loses contact with doctrines and ideas which should properly serve as his foundation and plows a soil rendered thin by the separation. The rivalries and animosities engendered by such separation are distasteful and harmful to both. Aside from the field of public administration, political science offers little vocational opportunity other than teaching. If, therefore, the political science field is to have an enrollment large enough to keep it in existence, it must make connections with other vocational fields, for the vocational aspect cannot be avoided. As for myself, I do not wish to avoid it, for I am always appalled at the prospect of the jobless graduate. All of this implies to me a need for university reorganization. I have made it clear, I assume, that I regard the liberal arts college as a rather odd structure. The diversity of its aims and interests is but ill-concealed by the somewhat crumbling facade of broad general education. I should organize our universities in a somewhat different way. Political science and the other social sciences have a strong community of interest with the vocations represented by business administration and law. A considerable portion of their natural clientele is in these areas. This is particularly the case as one moves towards the vocational end of political science. As matters now</page><page sequence="18">196 THE JOURNAL OP POLITICS [ Vol. 21 stand political science maintains no better than a very weak hold on public administration, for a considerable proportion of its natural subject matter lies in business administration and law. Even outside public administration, narrowly considered, the natural ties of poli- tical science are much closer to law, finance, economics, economic policy, and statistics, than they are to physics, botany, or literature. I know of no other system of university organization outside the English speaking world in which the organizational scheme holds to the liberal arts pattern and it seems to me we may well reconsider a pattern which has merely developed by nothing more logical than continued secessions from liberal arts. Of course, the seemless web of knowledge, both pure and applied, does not fit readily into an organizational pattern, no matter what choice is made. No matter where political science is placed, and this is of course true of many other subjects, it will have contributions to make beyond its own particular organizational unit. Nevertheless, political science belongs in an organizational structure which will give it a voice in its own activities. The secession of the professional school has robbed the liberal arts colleges and with them, the departments of political science, of some of their voting strength. Requirements in political science are now heavily dependent upon decisions in quarters where the political scientists themselves have no vote. If we admit that one of the goals of political science is properly the training of citizens we are a long way from reaching the clientele which should be reached. A re- organization should seek to alter this situation. A reorganization of the university structure might facilitate a redesign of the curriculum. The business administration student might be taking constitutional and administrative law at the time that he is taking mathematics and statistics, or accounting. The civil engineer might be taking municipal government. The lawyer might be taking political theory. Instead the usual diet for the specialized student is the general survey of American government and no more. I do not suppose that these suggestions will find ready accept- ance or early adoption. Indeed, an affection for realism which, I have been often enough reminded, goes deep into pessimism, com- pels me to admit that they will probably find neither acceptance nor adoption. Nevertheless, this seems to me no reason for my refraining from making them. We cannot, I judge, reverse the tendency of stu-</page><page sequence="19">1959] VARIATIONS ON AN ENIGMA 197 dents to insist on the practical and vocational. We do not have the kind of society which can support a wide-spread adoption of the idea of a gentleman's education. Lacking the votes and the con- viction to enforce the so-called "liberal arts" view of education on the public at large, we shall, I fear, be compelled to wage an in- creasingly hopeless rear-guard action against more popular and powerful and perhaps more valid concepts of education. If we are to save for ourselves and others that which is truly sound in our educational system, we should, I think, abandon some of our current prejudices; we ought if we can, at this late date, to convince our colleagues of the essential usefulness of the fundamental knowledge contained within the liberal arts structure; and we need to seek a reorganization of the university appropriate to the aims and possi- bilities of our society.</page></plain_text>
