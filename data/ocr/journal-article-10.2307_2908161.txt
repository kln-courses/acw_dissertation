<plain_text><page sequence="1">ST. AUGUSTINE'S THREE VISIONS AND THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMMEDIA FRANCIS X. NEWMAN At the beginning of Paradiso Dante tells us how the poem will end: La gloria di colui che tutto move per l'universo penetra e risplende in una parte piu e meno altrove. Nel ciel che piu della sua luce prende fu'io, e vidi cose che ridire ne sa ne puo chi di la su discende .... (Par., i, 1-6) The Comedy is the narrative of a journey through a universe whose parts are distinguished by the degree to which they " re-glow " with the divine Light. The end of the journey comes in a heaven which is filled with that light, and its climactic event is therefore an act of seeing, a vision which the pilgrim attains, but which the poet, "chi di la su discende," cannot describe. The language of these opening lines of Paradiso points clearly to the source from which Dante drew the conception of a supreme vision about which it is impossible to speak: "I know a man in Christ: above fourteen years ago (whether in the body I know not, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth), such a one caught up to the third heaven. And I know such a man (whether in the body, or out of the body, I know not: God knoweth): That he was caught up into paradise and heard secret words which it is not given to man to utter." (II Corin. xii, 2-4) That the conclusion 56 M L N</page><page sequence="2">M L N 57 of the Comedy is modelled on St. Paul's flight to the third heaven would be evident enough even if Dante himself had not made the connection explicit in the letter to Can Grande,1 but the relevance of this fact to the structure of the poem has not been clearly recog- nized. Paul's account of his experience (the Middle Ages never doubted, incidentally, that the "man in Christ" was Paul himself) mentions a third heaven and in so doing it set a classic exegetical problem. There was no question of Paul's being in error; therefore what were the three heavens that he mentioned? There are a num- ber of answers to the question in the commentaries, but the most influential was given by St. Augustine in the final book of his De Genesi ad litteram. What I wish to propose in the following pages is that the theory of vision advanced by Augustine in his exegesis of Paul's raptus eventually exercised a significant influence on the structure of Dante's Comedy. To speak baldly of the " structure " of Dante's poem is, of course, to raise a virtually inexhaustible question, but I want to discuss only the most obvious of the multiple patterns of the poem: the division into three cantiche. The apportioning of the Comedy into Inferno, Purgatorio, and Paradiso constitutes the primary aspect of the " form of the treatise," a form given the poet by conventional eschatology. But eschatology merely provided the premise of the narrative; it did not tell Dante how to make the experience of each realm distinct for the pilgrim and thereby for the reader. Nothing is clearer about the Comedy than that Hell, Purgatory, and Heaven are more than places with different kinds of souls in them. Indeed, so striking is the difference between successive realms that we can describe the pilgrim's journey as a passage through three different kinds of experience. That is the essential argument of this essay. While Dante differentiates the three kingdoms in many ways, the most pervasive pattern of distinction lies in his handling of the images of light throughout the poem. As the opening lines of Para- diso assert, the universe of the Comedy is one which "re-glows" with the light of God, here more, there less. And so Hell is a place of profound darkness (though the gloom is never absolute, for to be utterly without light in a poem where light is the sign of being could only signify annihilation). Purgatory, the middle kingdom, is alternately bright and dark, subject to the cycle of night and day. 1 Epistolae, x, 28, ed. Paget Toynbee (Oxford, 1920), p. 192.</page><page sequence="3">58 M L N Heaven is filled with light, a brilliance that grows progressively more intense as the pilgrim approaches the Empyrean. The ulti- mate moment of the pilgrim's journey through the three realms is an explosion of illumination-Dante's word is fulgore-that is the vision of God unmediated. No reader of the Comedy needs to be told that progress toward God in the poem is progress toward light, but a corollary fact is sometimes neglected: as light increases in intensity during the journey's course there is a corresponding and progressive dematerialization of the things which reflect or transmit that light. As he approaches the transcendent and incorporeal God, the objects of Dante's vision grow ever more translucent or, con- versely, less corporeal. On the whole this double pattern of in- creasing brilliance and decreasing corporeality is a continuum, for the journey is a single journey, but it is also true that each of the three realms is essentially different as a place of vision, for the journey is three journeys. The Comedy depicts the journey of the pilgrim through a series of experiences which are meant to prepare him for a final centripetal moment of vision, but the separate can- tiche are patterned in the same way. Each of the three major divisions of the action is arranged to lead the pilgrim to a climactic moment of seeing, so that in order to understand the structure of the poem we must perceive that it has three points of climax, three centripetal moments of vision, within the larger movement toward finality. The first two of these visions are not terminal, but point beyond themselves and require the pilgrim to journey further until he reaches the third and final vision which is an end in itself. Let us now turn to Augustine, where, I suggest, we find the ulti- mate, if not the proximate source of this pattern. De Genesi ad litteram 2 is just what its title promises, but something else as well. The first eleven books of this commentary are a consecutive analysis of the opening chapters of Genesis, but the twelfth and last book is an explication of the single word paradisus. The problem Augus- tine frames for himself in Book XII is this: what did St. Paul mean when he spoke (in II Corin. 12: 2-4) of being carried up into the third heaven? Are there three heavens and, if so, which of them is paradisus? He handles the question at length, but his solution can be briefly summarized. The three Pauline " heavens " are really figures for the three kinds of human vision, that is, the three funda- 2 Ed. Iosephus Zycha, CSEL, 28 (1): 1-456.</page><page sequence="4">M L N 59 mental modes of human awareness. The first of these is the visio corporalis, the literal sight of the eye or, more generally, knowledge by means of the external senses. The second is the visio spiritualis or imaginativa, knowledge by means of the imagination. In " spiri- tual" vision we do not see bodies themselves, but images that have corporeal shape without corporeal substance. Dreams, for example, are a sub-class of the visio spiritualis. The third and highest of the classes of vision is intellectualis, the direct cognition of realities such as God, the angels, caritas, etc., which have neither corporeal sub- stance nor corporeal shape. Whatever man knows he knows in one of these three ways, but Augustine is particularly interested in how we know God. In this regard he asserts that man can know God by means of any of the three visions: Moses gazing on the burning bush "saw" God with corporeal sight; John in the Apocalyptic vision saw Him by means of the figures and images of visio spiri- tualis; and St. Paul's raptus is the great exemplar of the visio in- tellectualis. Only the last, however, is a direct intuition of God Himself; the others are indirect visions by means of bodies or images. While he speaks of three different visions, moreover, Au- gustine is also at pains to emphasize that vision is essentially a con- tinuum, in which corporeal, spiritual, and intellectual vision are related in a hierarchical system. In normal human experience, that is to say, sensation is primary, but its data are transformed into and stored as the phantasms of imagination, and these in turn are the material from which are drawn the imageless ideas of intellectual vision. The structure of the De Genesi ad litteram itself invites comment. In the first eleven books Augustine limits himself to the portion of the Genesis narrative that concludes with the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise. The twelfth book, while it opens almost as if it were a philological treatise, is really a meditation on man's return to Paradise. Hence the choice of the Pauline rapture as the central text. As Augustine explores the text, the " questio paradisi," as he calls it, becomes a discussion of vision, for man's return to Paradise will not be a literal return to the garden of Genesis, but the vision of God in "the third heaven." To speak of Paradise is therefore necessarily to speak of vision, because Paradise is vision, and Paul's account of being carried up to the third heaven is the central Biblical paradigm of man's hoped-for destiny: the " intel- lectual" or unmediated vision of God.</page><page sequence="5">60 M L N The schema of visions that Augustine proposed in the De Genesi ad litteram was widely influential throughout the Middle Ages. We can get a taste of its influence if we open Alanus de Insulis's Distinctiones Dictionum Theologicalium (a kind of Bible lexicon) to the entry for visio: " Visio est perceptio alicujus rei, mediante visu, et haec visio dicitur corporalis. Dicitur imaginatio, unde Daniel de Nabuchodonosor ait: Somnum tuum et visiones capitis tui, et haec visio dicitur imaginaria vel spiritualis. Dicitur exstasis qua homo rapitur ad contemplationem coelestium, unde: Visio Isaiae prophetae, et haec dicitur intellectualis vel mentalis: prima dicitur primum coelum; secunda [read: tertia] tertium; unde Paulus: Scio hominem raptum usque ad tertium coelum." 3 This is the entire entry, but its brevity is only a sign of how conventional a notion Augustine's three visions had become by the twelfth century. Exegetes found the triple vision particularly useful in the explica- tion of Biblical visions, especially the Apocalypse 4 and, of course, II Corinthians, xii, 2-4,5 but it also appears in a variety of other contexts (particularly in places where a tripartite division was a useful analytic tool).6 One appearance of the formula that is 8 PL, 210: 1007. 4For examples, consult the commentaries on Apocalypse by: Alcuin (PL, 100: 1089); Aimon of Auxerre (PL, 117: 938-40); Rupert of Deutz (PL, 169: 851-852); Glossa Ordinaria (Biblia Latina [Basel, 1498], VI, sig.

The informing metaphor of the treatise is the scala paradisi which the true Christian ascends in order to come to the vision of God. As Honorius elaborates the alle- gory, the ladder to Paradise is composed of three sets of hierarchi- cally arranged steps, corporeal, spiritual, and intellectual vision. By climbing this series of steps the Christian eventually reaches the third heaven of beatific vision. A similar instance of such structural use of the Augustinian formula may perhaps be found in the popular satire Apocalypsis Goliae.8 In this curious poem a be- wildered narrator is granted a series of three visions: the first is a brief glimpse of a great crowd of pagan auctores, who represent the liberal and practical arts; the second is a parodic pseudo- Apocalypse; and the third is a burlesque version of Paul's elevation to the third heaven. Critics of the poem, who have complained of its incoherent structure, have failed to notice that the obvious clue to the arrangement of the narrative is the very common use of Augustine's doctrine of vision in the exegesis of the canonical Apoca- lypse. The apparently random set of three visions in the poem becomes coherent when we perceive that the satirist is mocking not only Apocalypse but the vision form itself. The vision of the pagan sages, representing the artes, is a parody of corporeal vision (knowl- edge derived from sense-data); the pseudo-Apocalypse and burlesque Pauline flight are parodies of conventional instances of spiritual and intellectual vision. The structure of the poem is thus precisely the kind of learned joke that " Golias " was so fond of. The variety of instances that have been cited indicate the wide- spread currency of Augustine's schema. We can now return to the Comedy. The first cantica of the poem leads us through a realm Salisbury, De septem septenis, vi (PL, 199: 959-960); Alanus de Insulis, Summa de arte praedicatoria, vii, xlviii (PL, 210: 126, 195-196); Innocent III, Sermones de tempore ii, Sermones de sanctis, xxxii (PL, 217: 319-324, 592-593); Bonaventura, In libros sententiarum, II, dist. x, art. iii, quaest. 3, In Hexaemeron, III (Quar- racchi, III, 271; V, 347); Thomas Aquinas, Summa theologica, I, quaest. lvii, art. 1 (citing the Glossa), II-II, quaest. clxxv, art. 3 (citing the De Genesi ad litteram); Vincent of Beauvais, Speculum naturale, XXVI, lxxv-lxxvii (Duaci, 1624, cols. 1885-1887). 7PL, 172: 1229-1240. 8 Die Apokalypse des Golias, ed.

Corporeality, however, is more than a matter of poetic texture in Inferno; it also is the key to the structure of Hell as a place. As Dante and Virgil descend further into the pit they move ever closer to that point in the uni- verse which is the center of corporeal weight: " lo mezzo / al quale ogni gravezza si rauna " (Inf., xxxii, 73-74), " il punto / al qual si traggon d'ogni parte i pesi" (Inf., xxxiv, 110-111). In other words, Dante conceives the bottom of the pit of Hell as both cosmically peripheral (at the maximum distance from the source of all being) and cosmically central (a mezzo or attracting center for everything in the universe that is weighted). It is not patently anachronistic, given the association of the pit with gravezza, to say that the law of descent in the Comedy is the law of gravity. Indeed it is possible to understand Inferno as a poetic realization of what Augustine and Gregory called the pondus of evil,9 or the gravitas of the sinner.10 As Ciacco explains when Dante inquires after some fellow Floren- tines: "Ei son tra l'anime piu nere: diverse colpe giu li grava al fondo: se tanto scendi, la i potrai vedere." (Inf., vi, 85-87) It is consistent with such a conception of the descent that the least culpable inhabitants of Hell, the trimmers and the lustful, are spun round and round in windy circles, while the worst sinners, the traitors, lie frozen and immobile in the lake of ice. All of this emphasis on corporeality in Inferno is not, as some classically- minded critics have asserted, merely a sign of Dante's medieval fascination with "Gothick" grotesquerie; it is rather the poetic means of displaying the essential meaning of Hell. To be in Hell 9 On the idea of pondus in Augustine see W. J. Roche, " Measure, Number, and Weight in Saint Augustine," New Scholasticism, XV (1941), 362-376. 10 " Plerumque anima amoris Dei desiderio accenditur; sed quia gravi pecca- torum pondere premitur, eo citius ad ima labitur, quo admissorum conscientia interius gravatur," Gregory, In septem psalmos poenitentiales, iii, 4 (PL, 79: 569-570).

By choosing Hell, the sinners reject the Creator for his creation and accept a contingent reality in place of true substantiality. In Inferno Dante presents this fact in realized action: the sinners condemn themselves to live forever in the kind of material world they were meant to trans- cend.11 To turn from God, then, in Dante's poetic universe, is to be afflicted with gravezza and to plunge downward into corporeality. The plot of Inferno is thus a movement toward a center, and at the center the pilgrim discovers the meaning of the realm in a cli- mactic and synoptic moment of vision. Regarding the action as a process of vision, we can say that the emphatically tactile imagery of Inferno is all preparative, a way of readying the pilgrim's eyes to see what they see at the bottom of the pit. This explains one particularly striking scene that might otherwise seem anomalous: E mentre ch'andavamo inver lo mezzo al quale ogni gravezza si rauna, e io tremava nell'etterno rezzo; se voler fu o destino o fortuna non so; ma, passeggiando tra le teste, forte percossi il pie nel viso ad una. (Inf., xxxii, 73-78) At the very moment when the poet announces the pilgrim's ap- proach to the center of weight, he offers what amounts to a visual demonstration of that fact. The pilgrim not only stumbles over the protruding head of the traitor Bocca, but even seizes it and rips out handfuls of hair. This despite the fact that Bocca is only a shade, still to be joined with the body he left in the grave.12 Bocca's 1 Dante's conception of Hell as the realm of corporeality may also have been influenced by the neo-Platonic interpretation of infernus as this sublunary world of time and space; e.g., Macrobius, Commentarius in Somnium Scipionis I, x-xii, ed. Iacobus Willis (Lipsiae, 1963), pp. 42-51; Hugh of St. Victor, Didis- calicon, I, viii (PL, 176: 746); Bernard Silvestris, Commentum super sex libros Eneidos, VI, ed. Guilielmus Riedel (Gryphiswaldae, 1924), pp. 29-30. In his commentary on the Comedy, Dante's son Pietro applies Bernard's explanation of descensus ad inferos to the descent of Dante andc Virgil: Super Dantis ipsius genitoris Comoediam commentarium, ed. V. Nannucci (Florentiae, 1846), pp. 13-16. It is also worth observing, in the collection of texts concerning the regio dissimilitudinis assembled by Pierre Courcelle (AHDLMA, XXIV [1957], 24-33), how frequently the notion of bondage to corporeality is linked with alienation from God, the perversion of His image in man, and immersion in Hell. 12 Dante had performed a similar act earlier when he ripped a branch from a tree in the Wood of Suicides, but it does not seem so immediately anomalous</page><page sequence="9">64 M L N tangibility is neither an error on the poet's part nor a casual drama- tic device; it is a metaphor, an identification of image and the moral condition which the image signifies. It is also an adumbration of and preparation for the concluding vision of Inferno, the encounter with a Satan whose condition is even more anomalous than that of the tangible shade. Before his fall Lucifer was the angel of light, created but incorporeal. Nevertheless, although he never had a body to lose to the grave or regain at the judgment, the Satan whom the pilgrim sees in Giudecca is in cosmological position the heaviest thing in the universe. Once utterly incorporeal, he is now the most corporeal of beings, having sunk to the center of the earth, where he remains, hairy, rime-encrusted, and forever fixed in place. At the end of Canto xxxiv Dante tells us that when Satan fell he dis- placed the earth that formerly occupied the cave of Hell and in consequence thrust up the mountain of Purgatory. Now the name Lucifer is only a bitter parody, for the Satan Dante gives us is a fallen star, embedded like a frozen and blackened meteor in the bowels of the earth. Satan, in fact, is " lo punto / al quale si traggon d'ogni parte i pesi," a lodestone of evil who draws the sin-weighted souls downward. In Dante's universe, then, the opposite of light is not darkness, but body: at one pole stands the " luce che da se e vera" and at the other Lucifer, heaviest of all the inhabitants of Hell. It may be that Satan's corporeality explains the very shape that Dante gives him. To see how this is we must go back to the beginning. The Comedy opens with Dante, the confused pilgrim, wandering in a selva oscura. Landino may have been the first (though not the last) of the commentators to suggest the connection between this originating image and the use of the word silva as a philosophical term.13 In Chalcidius most notably, but also in Bernard Silvestris and others, silva is the customary translation of the Greek viX7: prime matter, the unformed chaotic stuff of which all corporeal beings are made.14 Silva itself is unintelligible; Chalcidius, in fact, as with Bocca since the inhabitants of the "dolorosa selva" appear in meta- morphosed shapes. 13 [Divina Commedia] (Venice, 1491), sig. a2-a3. See also Antonino Pagliaro, Linguistica della "Parola" (Roma, 1955), pp. 101 ff. and Marianne Stauffer, Der Wald: Zur Darstellung und Deutung der Natur im Mittelalter (Bern, 1959), pp. 143 ff. I owe these references, and a number of other helpful suggestions, to Professor John Freccero. 14 See Timaeus a Calcidio translatus commentarioque instructus, cclxviii-ccclv, ed. J. H. Waszink (London, 1962), pp. 273-346; J. Reginald O'Donnell, "The</page><page sequence="10">M L N 65 says that our knowledge of it is "obscurus." 15 If Dante intends the selva oscura to carry a philosophical resonance, it suggests the state of chaotic indirection in which the pilgrim finds himself at the outset, but it also suggests the character of the place through which he will move. Hell is silvestris: gloomy, rude, and corporeal. What the opening lines can mean, then, is that insofar as we, in our life, choose to turn from God we live in a world of corporeality and are ourselves corporeal.16 Read in this way, the opening of the cantica points toward its conclusion. The final canto of Inferno begins with an inverted allusion to the "Vexilla regis," the great liturgical hymn in praise of the wood of the cross. The allusion is not random, for Dante does show us a cross in the canto, not the "arbor decora et fulgida" of the "Vexilla regis," but its parody, the towering trunk and huge branching wings of Satan.17 He is the perversion of the lignum vitae, a sterile tree set upside- down in a frozen anti-paradise, and therefore an appropriate terminus for the journey that began in the selva oscura. If, as some have suggested, the selva is a philosophical pun, then the shape of Satan identifies him not only as anti-type of salvation, but also as the synoptic symbol of Hell's corporeality. The confrontation with Satan is the ultimate exercise of the visio corporalis since Satan is the ultimate center of corporeality. Meaning of Silva in the Commentary on the Timaeus of Plato by Chalcidius," Mediaeval Studies, VII (1945), 1-20; Bernard Silvestris, De mundi universitate, I, i-ii, edd.

Waszink, p. 337: "Itaque sensus quidem specierum in silva constitutarum clarus est, ipsius autem silvae, quae speciebus subiacet, obscurus et consensus potius quam sensus est." Chalcidius goes on to suggest that our knowledge of silva is comparable to our physically sensing such empty things as shadows, "ut si quis dicat tenebras quoque sine sensu videri." Elsewhere he says that error is another name for silva (p. 275), and that silva is the "regionem quae perceptis corporum formis exornata est" (p. 339). 16 Cf. Purg. xxxii, 100: when Beatrice tells Dante he must remain on earth for a little while she puts it as follows: "Qui sarai tu poco tempo silvano." Beatrice's word has two meanings: Dante will be silvestris, that is, rude and uncivilized, in that he will be an exile from the city; but he will also be an exile from the heavenly city, compelled to wander the selva oscura of this earthly life. In the second sense all men still in the flesh are silvani. 17 On Satan as a cross see Charles S. Singleton, Commedia: Elements of Struc- ture, Dante Studies, 1 (Cambridge, 1957), pp. 36-42 and John Freccero, "The Sign of Satan," MLN, LXXX (1965), 11-26.</page><page sequence="11">66 M L N But Augustine said that it is possible to see God in each of the three modes of vision and that is true even in Inferno. To look upon Satan is to look upon a body, but a body stamped with the sign of God. In his three heads we discern the Trinity, in his parody of the Cross we discern Christ. And so it is that the act of vision at the end of Inferno is not terminal, but leads inevitably beyond itself, just as Satan is himself a scala whom the pilgrims climb in order to ascend from Hell. Satan is a mock ruler, a parody figure, and, as with all parodies, to recognize him as such is at the same time to recognize what he apes. In seeing God's enemy and opposite, the pilgrim also sees God: as Augustine said we can see God even in corporeal vision. The passage from Hell to Purgatory is an entry into the light and thereby into a realm which calls for a different kind of vision. The culminating action of Purgatorio is not a vision of corporalia, but of spiritualia, in Augustine's sense of the terms. We get a sense of this new pattern almost immediately, when the pilgrim encounters his old friend Casella: lo vidi una di lor trarresi avante per abbracciarmi, con si grande affetto, che mosse me a fare il simigliante. Oi ombre vane, fuor che nell'aspetto! Tre volte dietro a lei le mani avvinsi, e tante mi tornai con esse al petto. (Purg. ii, 76-81) The episode is to be compared to the encounter with the quite tangible Bocca only a few cantos earlier. Casella, like all the inhabitants of Purgatory, is a shade without a shadow, empty save in appearance. Since he is nothing but " aspetto," Casella is aptly described by Augustine's formula for spiritualia: corporeal form without corporeal substance. Dante was obviously concerned with the reader's conception of the shades who populate Purgatory, since he devotes a long passage in Canto xxv to Statius's explanation of their nature. The passage is worth pausing over, for it is a sig- nificant clue to the character of Purgatorial vision. After describing how the vegetative and sensitive souls of man are generated, Statius explains that the rational soul, created di- rectly by God, absorbs these lower souls to itself, and the result is the single, undivided human soul. After the moment of death this</page><page sequence="12">M L N 67 soul is assigned to a place in one of the kingdoms of the afterlife. Therefore, though deprived of its proper body, the soul still exists in a place and as a result of this localization acquires a kind of new body: Tosto che loco li la circunscrive, la virtui informativa raggia intorno cosi e quanto nelle membra vive: e come l'aere, quand' e ben piorno, per l'altrui raggio che'n se si reflette, di diversi color diventa adorno; cosi l'aere vicin quivi si mette in quella forma che in lui suggella virtiialmente l'alma che ristette . . . (Purg. xxv, 88-96) Statius's language throughout his discourse is heavily scholastic, but his meaning in these lines, the heart of his speech, is elusive. It is customary to summarize what Statius says in the words " aerial body," but this phrase, though accurate enough, is still ambiguous. For example, Etienne Gilson in a very recent discussion under- stands " aerial body " as meaning a body made of air: " Leur corps est fait d'air humide, ou de vapeurs semblables a celles dont sont fait les nuages. Bien que Dante en parle parfois, pour faire com- prendre leur nature, comme de 'reflets,' les ombres ne sont pas simplement des images analogues a celles qui se forment a la sur- face des miroirs. Leur corps est reel. . . . La fabrication de ce corps factice n'est possible que parce que l'ame du mort dispose du materiau necessaire, l'air charge d'humidite comme il l'est apres une pluie: I'aer piorno." 18 It seems to me, however, that the text itself gives a different reading. Statius says that just as rays of light, reflected by moist air, adorn that air with the splendor of the rainbow, so the souls impress on the environing air a shape which conforms to the "informative virtue" they still possess. Unless Statius is careless in his simile, what the analogy of the 18 " Trois etudes dantesques," AHDLMA, XXXII (1965), 94-95. Despite Gil- son's advice that we ought to take the text as it stands, he himself, in the pages cited, treats Statius's simile as if it were literal statement. Statius does not say that "humid air" is the necessary material for the shades; the mention of " 'aer piorno " is part of his rainbow simile. We might recall that Statius is critical of himself for forgetting " nostra vanitate, / trattando l'ombre come cosa salda." (Purg. xxi, 135-136.)</page><page sequence="13">68 M L N rainbow means is that the shades are images created by reflections in air. The ombre, in other words, are not made of air, any more than the rainbow is made of vapor. Such an interpretation is reinforced by returning to the two similes that Virgil uses before turning the discussion over to Statius. To understand what the shades are, he says, Dante ought to consider two things: first, how the body of Meleagar wasted when the wood was consumed by the fire and, second, how his own image in a mirror moves when he moves. Meleagar was not made of wood, nor Dante of glass: the point is that these are images, reflections. When Dante confronts the shade, say, of Casella, what he is seeing is the image of the body Casella once bore, reflected in the air: corporeal form without cor- poreal substance. Bocca and Casella are separated by only a few cantos in the poem, yet the pilgrim's encounter with each one is sharply different; the difference is that between corporalia and spiritualia1.9 Perhaps we need not debate over the merits of " by " versus " of" so scholastically; the important point is that the shades are some- how like reflections, empty except in "aspetto." The importance of the point lies in the fact that it draws our attention to the char- acteristic pattern of vision experience that Dante has in Purgatory. To put it as directly as possible: the dominant note in Dante's experiences as a seer in Purgatory is the perception of images. For "1 Professor Freccero has suggested to me that Dante's treatment of the shades as spiritualia should be connected with the neo-Platonic tradition of imagination as the "subtle body" of the soul. The history of this tradition, as well as Dante's connection with it, is outlined by Robert Klein, "L'Enfer de Ficin," Umanismo e Esoterismo, Archivio di Filosofia (1960), pp. 47-67. Among the sources Klein cites, the following from Hugh of St. Victor is particularly appo- site: "Ergo imaginatio nihil aliud est quam similitudo corporis .... Haec autem in rationabilibus purior fit, ubi ad rationalem et incorpoream animae substantiam contingendam defecatur; tamen illic quoque extra substantiam illius manens, quia similitudo corporis est et fundatur in corpore. Rationalis autem substantia corporea lux est; imaginatio vero, inquantum corporis imago est, umbra est. Et idcirco postquam imaginatio usque ad rationem ascendit, quasi umbra in lucern veniens, et luci superveniens, inquantum ad eam venit, mani- festatur, et circumscribitur; inquantum illi supervenit, obnubilat eam, et obum- brat, et involvit, et contegit. Et siquidem ratio ipsa sola contemplatione eam susceperit quasi vestimentum, ei est ipsa imaginatio extra eam, et circa ear quo facile exui et spoliari possit. Si vero etiam delectatione illi adhaeserit, quasi pellis ei fit ipsa imaginatio. ... Hinc est quod animae corporibus exutae, corporabilibus adhuc passionibus teneri possunt, quia videlicet a corruptione corporalium affectionum [cf. Purg., xxv, 107] nondum mundatae sunt." (PL, 177: 288)</page><page sequence="14">M L N 69 example, it is only in Purgatory that Dante dreams. The Middle Ages had many theories about dreams, but the theorists were virtu- ally unanimous in assigning dreams to the faculty of imagination. As we noticed above, Augustine made dreaming a species of the visio spiritualis, because in dreams we apprehend neither physical bodies nor incorporeal ideas, but images of bodies. While at night in Purgatory Dante dreams, during the day he undergoes a similar form of experience (also unique to the realm) -instruction by means of the various "whips" and "reins" appropriate to each ledge. The inhabitants of Purgatory are taught the nature of their sins by contemplating historical instances of the vice itself and its opposing virtue. Though drawn from Biblical and secular history, there is no sense that these events are witnessed by the pilgrims as actual occurrences. They are exempla, the visual or auditory re-presentation of events for didactic purposes. dinanzi a noi pareva si verace quivi intagliato in un atto soave, che non sembiava imagine che tace. (Purg. x, 37-39) This is Dante's reaction to the first of the "whips ": the sculpture is so realistic that he almost believes it is not an " imagine." 20 In successive ledges the mode of representation changes to visions, voices, and recitations by the sinners themselves, but always the "whips " and " reins " are historical images of virtue and vice. All of the pilgrim's experiences with the shades, dreams, and exempla on the mountain comprise a distinctly novel kind of appre- hension for him, which constitutes a preparation for the culminat- ing moment of Purgatorial vision. Inferno concludes with the vision of God in a body; Purgatorio with the vision of God in an image. The setting for this climactic vision is appropriate: a gigantic allegorical pageant of imaginary shapes. If the climax of Paradiso recalls the Pauline raptus, the masque which concludes Purgatorio recalls Apocalypse in its imaginative splendor. In the course of the procession Dante is given to see such incorporeal realities as the theological and cardinal virtues, not as they are in themselves, but as beautiful ladies dressed in symbolically colored clothes. The Bible appears in the shape of thirty-one old men and 20 Cf. Purg., xii, 61-69.</page><page sequence="15">70 M L N Christ in the form of the griffon, a figure that with centaurs, golden houses and other such composites, was a perennial medieval exam- ple of a creature existing in imagination alone. It is in the midst of this profusion of imaginary shapes that Dante has his second vision of God. As in Inferno the vision has two aspects, but pre- sented here in two separate stages. The first is the vision of Christ: Dante sees in Beatrice's eyes the reflection of the Griffon: Come in lo specchio sol, non altrimenti la doppia fiera dentro vi raggiava, or con altri, or con altri reggimenti. Pensa, lettor, s'io mi maravigliava, quando vedea la cosa in se star queta, e nell'idolo suo si transmutava. (Purg. xxxi, 121-126) The mystery of the incarnation appears to Dante as a shifting idolo reflected in Beatrice's eyes as the sun is in a mirror. The second stage of the climactic vision comes when Beatrice turns her face directly to Dante and unveils her smile: "Per grazia fa noi grazia che disvele a lui la bocca tua, si che discerna la seconda bellezza che tu cele." O isplendor di viva luce etterna, che palido si fece sotto l'ombra si di Parnaso, o bevve in sua cisterna, che non paresse aver la mente ingombra, tentando a render te qual tu paresti la dove armonizzando il ciel t'adombra, quando nell'aere aperto ti solvesti? (Purg. xxxi, 136-145) In describing the revelation of the second "bellezza" Dante uses images of veils rather than mirrors: standing before a man who has lived beneath the shade (of Parnassus), Beatrice "dis-veils" and stands revealed under no other shadow but the sky. But the veil and the mirror are really synonymous, as we can discern in the word that Dante uses to describe what he sees when the veil is removed-isplendor. The customary gloss on the word is from the Convivio: "Ma pero che qui e fatta menzione di luce e di splendore, a perfetto intendimento mostrer6 differenza di questi vocabuli, secondo che Avicenna sente. Dico che l'usanza de'filosofi</page><page sequence="16">M L N 71 e di chiamare 'luce' lo lume, in quanto esso e nel suo fontale principio; di chiamare ' raggio,' in quanto esso e per lo mezzo, dal principio al primo corpo dove si termina; di chiamare 'splendore,' in quanto esso e in altra parte alluminata ripercosso." 21 When, therefore, Dante turns his gaze to the brilliance of Beatrice's smile what he sees is not the living and eternal Light " nel suo fontale principio," but the splendor of that light " in altra parte allumi- nata ripercosso." That is to say that Beatrice unveils, but is her- self a veil and a mirror, through whom Dante perceives the Light of the Godhead. The figure of Beatrice is the highest of the ombre that occupy the eyes of the pilgrim in Purgatorio. The concluding moment of centripetal vision in Purgatorio, then, is the vision of God by means of images and the vehicle is the corporeal form of Beatrice: the visio spiritualis vel imaginaria. Perhaps the best gloss on the cantica is Dante's own exclamation in the center canto of Purgatorio: O imaginativa che ne rube tal volta si di fuor, ch'om non s'accorge perche dintorno suonin mille tube, chi move te, se'l senso non ti porge? Moveti lume che nel ciel s'informa, per se o per voler che giu lo scorge. (Purg. xvii, 13-18) Purgatory is the realm in which the pilgrim begins to see the heavenly Light, but his eyes are not yet ready to look upon it directly. He still requires media to shield him from its full bril- liance. In Paradise Dante will see God face to face; here in Purga- tory he still sees per speculum in aenigmate: through a glass and in a sign. Images are neither wholly corporeal nor wholly incorporeal, as Augustine said. Spiritualia are intermediate entities, not only epis- temologically, but also ontologically. Dante's emphasis on the image in Purgatorio is thus perfectly suited to the transitional character of the realm. Even the physical design of the place, an immense mountain whose massive base tapers to a peak, is symbolic of the fact that Purgatory mediates between the shadowed cor- poreality of Hell and the lucid incorporeality of Heaven. The 21 Convivio, III, xiv, 5, ed. G. Busnelli and G. Vandelli, 2nd ed. (Firenze, 1953), I, 419-420.</page><page sequence="17">72 M L N design is the precise reverse of that of Hell: there the descent is into an ever-narrowing cave toward a point where the souls are buried in matter; here as the pilgrim climbs, the mountain itself- quite literally-grows less corporeal at each stage. And so does the pilgrim. At the base of the mountain his step is weighted and the climb hard. With the removal of the first P, however, the pil- grim feels lighter, as if some "cosa greve" (Purg. xii, 118) has been lifted from him, the reverse of the system of Hell.22 He grows still lighter as he climbs until, when he has passed through the refining fire of the last ledge, he feels himself ready to transcend gravity completely: " ad ogni passo poi / al volo mi sentia crescer le penne" (Purg. xxvii, 122-123). As the angel of the first cornice said, flight is man's true destiny (" o gente umana, per volar su nata," Purg., xii, 95) and it is the function of Purgatory to cleanse the sinner from the encumbering sin that holds him back. To be cleansed is to be freed of the pondus that weighs down the souls in Hell, so that " mondi e lievi " (Purg. xi, 35) the saved may ascend to the stars. Therefore when Dante reaches the peak of Mount Purgatory he is at the nexus of the corporeal and incorporeal worlds, the appropriate locale for the visio spiritualis that takes place there. The vision of God is not in a body nor direct, but as reflected by and through the veil of Beatrice's corporeal form. When Dante passes from Purgatory to Paradise he enters a world that is light-filled throughout, but even here there is progression toward a moment of climactic brilliance. Though movement upward is as swift as that of light itself, Dante nonetheless consumes thirty-three cantos of poetic time in reaching the summit point,23 and we should be aware of the enormity of his narrative problem. He was writing a poem made of finite words and images about a realm that transcends time and space, a narrative of the human actions of a "transhumanized" actor. Dante's solution to this narrative problem is simple in conception though astonishingly complex in execution. Throughout the poem the core of the narrative has been the gradual purification and strengthening of the pilgrim's power of vision, but in Paradiso Dante makes the very possibility of narrative depend on the capacities of his eyes. At the start of his flight, and, in fact, until its very conclusion, the 22 Cf. Purg., xxii, 7. 23 Compare Beatrice's remark that the rebellious angels fell from Heaven to Hell in less time than it would take for one to count to twenty, Par., xxix, 49-51,</page><page sequence="18">M L N 73 pilgrim is still seeing (that is, knowing) with a mind conditioned to corporeal forms. For this reason, although the inhabitants of Paradise are properly incorporeal, they are given a perceptible shape of light-now not ombre, but luci-in order that the pilgrim may be prepared gradually for the final truly incorporeal vision. Beatrice explains the procedure in Canto iv when she tells Dante that the saved souls have their true home in the Empyrean but appear in the various spheres in order that the pilgrim may be instructed: Qui si mostraron, non perche sortita sia questa spera lor, ma per far segno della celestial c'ha men salita. Cosi parlar conviensi al vostro ingegno, per6 che solo da sensato apprende ci6 che fa poscia d'intelletto degno. (Par. iv, 37-42) The souls function as signs (" per far segno ") adapted to the capa- cities of a knower whose faculties are still sense-oriented and not yet ready for an act of intellectual intuition, a mode of instruction Beatrice compares to the anthropomorphic techniques of Scripture, which attributes hands and feet to a transcendent God.24 The arrangement of Paradise, then, as a place to be seen, is the result of an act of divine benevolence which adapts the process of illumina- tion to Dante's limitations. Beatrice reminds Dante of this near the end of the journey as they enter the Empyrean. They come upon a river of light (" lume in forma di rivera" Par. xxx, 61) whose banks are lined with flowers and whose waters scintillate with living sparks. The river is grace, the flowers the souls of the saved, and the sparks angels. Beatrice explains: " I1 fiume e li topazii ch'entrano ed escono e'l rider dell'erbe son di lor vero umbriferi prefazii. Non che da se sian queste cose acerbe; ma e difetto dalla parte tua, che non hai viste ancor tanto superbe." (Par. xxx, 76-81) Her language reveals the paradoxical nature of Paradisal imagery: even these brilliant forms, which are themselves lights, are " umbri- 24 Richard of St. Victor also uses the example of Scripture in discussing the way in which imagination is a bridge between sense perception and the under- standing of invisibilia: Benjamin Minor, xv (PL, 196: 10-11).</page><page sequence="19">74 M L N feri prefazii," shadows and prefaces-shadows because they are pre- faces. Throughout Paradiso lights are shadows, reflections of the true Light. After Dante bathes in the river these light-shadows undergo a visual metamorphosis. He compares the change to the way the mask worn by someone at a festival might be dropped in order to reveal the masquer's true identity. So the "sembianza" of the river of light vanishes to reveal a greater festival. cosi mi si cambiaro in maggior feste li fiori e le faville, si ch'io vidi ambo le corti del ciel manifeste. (Par. xxx, 94-96) Dante's metaphor here is compressed and suggestive. The masked revellers at a festival are gay partly because of the personae that their masks allow them to adopt. The putting off of the masks is a sign that the festival and its rejoicing are ended. Dante tells us, however, that it is different in the kingdom of Heaven; there unmasking is our joy, and the true face of reality is more intoxicat- ing (cf. 1. 67) than its shadow. But Dante's image of the two festivals further alerts us to the fact that the pilgrim has still not come to the vision of the fully revealed light. Even though the heavenly courts are now "manifeste," the greater festival still in- volves a kind of masking. The souls and the angels are transformed from the flowers and sparks of the river into a single flower and swarm of bees. Dante does not dispense with images; he simply exchanges one image for a new and more transparently revealing one. The rose of souls itself rests on a compound of reflected lights and each face in it is a reflector that transmits the Light of "another" (xxxi, 48). Dante's vision of the river and its metamorphosis in Canto xxx is a helpful guide to the understanding of the way the poet makes us experience the pilgrim's progress through Paradise. The climax of Purgatorio depicts an encounter with dazzling brilliance, yet Dante manages to convince us at every stage of the way through Paradise that the pilgrim is apprehending an even more intense level of illumination. The essential difference between the objects of vision in Purgatory and in Paradiso is that in the middle king- dom the " shadowy prefaces " are images of bodies, while in Para- dise the shadows are lights, as Beatrice points out. The method of Paradiso, then, is to have the Light veiled by lights. So it is that</page><page sequence="20">M L N 75 Dante can begin Paradiso at the brilliant peak where Purgatorio ended and trace the pilgrim's encounter with a series of always more brilliant lights which are nonetheless only semblances and shadows of God's transcendent reality. The climactic shadow- light in Paradiso is the Mystic Rose, and the highest glory of the Rose is Mary, ". .. che a Cristo piu si somiglia, che la sua chiarezza sola ti pu6 disporre a veder Cristo." (Par. xxxii, 85-87) In this pilgrimage of the eye, not even the vision of Mary can be an end in itself, but is given to Dante as the highest human similitude of divinity. The pilgrim looks on the Mother of Christ as on everything he sees: to prepare himself to see God, for she is "di Dio tanto sembiante " (Par. xxxii, 93). It is only at the very end of his journey that Dante's eyes are ready for the vision of God without semblances, the visio intellec- tualis that tradition associated with St. Paul. As in the other two realms the climactic vision takes place in an appropriate envi- ronment, the Empyrean or heaven of "pura luce: / luce intel- lettiial" (Par. xxx, 39-40). It is here that Dante is finally allowed to look upon the " alta luce che da se e vera " (Par. xxxiii, 54). We should notice how carefully Dante depicts this supreme confronta- tion. When Mary turns her eyes toward God and Bernard com- mands the pilgrim to imitate her example, the poet does not imme- diately narrate the moment of visio intellectualis. Dante the pilgrim, even here, is not yet beyond the vision of images. As his eyes begin to penetrate the raggio of divine Light he first sees a series of figures: the Book which is the unity of many leaves (an image of the transcendence of substance and accident in God), the three-in-one circle of light (an image of the Trinity), and the union of the human shape with the circle of the Son (an image of the Incarnation). He has still not reached the direct intuition of God as He is, but he has come at last to the end of the prepara- tive vision. The point to be recognized about this final series of semblances is that they are all symbols of mysteries which tran- scend merely human understanding. The human mind can con- struct analogies of these facts, it can reason out the necessity of their existence, but it cannot understand them as they are in them-</page><page sequence="21">76 M L N selves so long as it still operates within the categories of space and time. The simplicity of God, the Trinity, the Incarnation are, in Augustine's word, intellectualia-realities which are utterly beyond space and time. The moment when the pilgrim confronts this vision is a crucial one and the poet pauses to describe his reaction: Qual e '1 geometra che tutto s'affige per misurar lo cerchio, e non ritrova, pensando, quel principio ond'elli indige, tal era io a quella vista nova .... (Par. xxxiii, 133-136) The simile is exact. The intellectual fact that the pilgrim is seek- ing to apprehend evades the measuring of the mind. The geometer may manipulate images of square and circle and may cover sheets with his calculations, but none of this will allow him to see, to apprehend intuitively, the square circle itself. The simile warns us that we cannot see God by thinking about Him; rather God must reveal Himself to us by raising us to a transhumanized mode of knowledge. It is grace that lifts us beyond thinking to the intel- lectual vision of God. It is while Dante, in the fashion of the geometer, struggles to know, that the moment of grace comes: ma non eran da cio le proprie penne: se non che la mia mente fu percossa da un fulgore in che sua voglia venne. (Par. xxxiii, 139-141) His own wings are too weak to lift him up to the final height, but the Light descends from above with the suddenness and inten- sity of a lightning bolt. This is the moment of visio intellectualis: a fulgore, an enveloping explosion, a blow to the mind. The image of the lightning flash conveys the sense of an experience of light- that is, of intellectual reality-so encompassing that the mind can- not contain it; it contains the mind. Dante fills the final canto of Paradiso with confessions of his inability to render the final vision of God in words. These profes- sions are not mere instances of the topos of authorial modesty, but acknowledgments of the Pauline injunction that it is not licit for man to describe what he sees in the " third heaven." The con- cluding lines of the poem, we should realize, do not violate the</page><page sequence="22">M L N 77 Pauline prohibition. Even though everything that has gone before has only been preface to the moment of supreme vision, Dante nevertheless refrains from describing that final vision. He tells us that he saw, but he does not tell us what he saw.25 He simply says that to look on God directly is to be overwhelmed as by lightning. Here alta fantasia, the expressive power of images, fails, because the experience of God in the visio intellectualis is utterly beyond similitudes. All the poet can do is what Dante does in the poem's final lines: suggest the effect of the vision on his will (and by impli- cation on his subsequent actions) and then end his poem. These notes on the structure of vision in the Comedy have been necessarily schematic, and I have avoided attendant problems in the interest of bringing a view of the narrative's framework into clear relief. When Dante chose to write a poem about how we, in our life, can discover God, he chose as his essential narrative action the act of seeing. The classical model, reflected in the choice of Virgil as guide, is not the voyage of Odysseus, but the underworld tour of Aeneas, for the most significant thing about the journey is not what the pilgrim does, but what he sees. The mark of progress in the journey is therefore the growth of the pilgrim's power of vision, the education of his eyes. This growth in visionary capacity is continuous, but it is also divided into three stages that corre- spond to the three realms of the afterlife through which the pil- grim passes. At the climactic point in each realm the pilgrim experiences a moment of epiphany which is a vision of God (both as Christ and as the Godhead). In Hell Dante sees God in a body; in Purgatory in an image; in Paradise in Himself. The first two 25 It is interesting to compare the conclusion of the Comedy with that of the Apocalypsis Goliae, which also ends with the narrator's reaching a Pauline vision of the " third heaven." Golias, too, heeds Paul's injunction and does not say what he saw at the summit of his flight, but he manages the matter differently. While in the third heaven, he says, he grew hungry and made the mistake of downing a meal of poppy bread and Lethe water, with the result that he now forgets everything he saw there. The poem ends with a sly expres- sion of regret: O quanta dicerem et quam mirifica de rebus superis et sorte celica, nisi papaveris cena sophistica mentis vestigia fecisset lubrica! (strophe 110, ed. Strecker, p. 37.) The difference in tone between the two poems is immense, but the narrative problem was the same: how not to narrate the experience which Paul said could not be narrated.</page><page sequence="23">78 M L N epiphanies are indirect, representing the knowledge of God by means of something other than Himself; only the third vision is direct and intuitive. In ordering his poem in this way, I suggest, Dante was respond- ing to the tradition of commentary that flowed from Augustine's De Genesi ad litteram XII.26 While the classical prototype for the pilgrim of the Comedy is Aeneas, the Biblical prototype is Paul, concerning whose vision of the "third heaven " Augustine's is the conventional medieval exegesis. Augustine proposed the sequence of three visions, corporeal, spiritual, and intellectual, as the solu- tion to a specific exegetical problem, but he also asserted their uni- versality as the essential modes by which man can know God. What I have tried to show is that this Augustinian pattern gives us a very direct clue to the structure of the Comedy as an act of vision. Dante begins in a dark wood, apprehending reality as a chaos of materiality, obscurely without meaning; in the subsequent action he passes from the condition of seeing reality as a corporeal mass to seeing it as incorporeal substance. The Comedy is therefore the narrative of an act of total vision which penetrates through the apparent substantiality of this world of time and space to the God who transcends time and space and is "true of Himself." The Augustinian tradition provided Dante with the essential clue to how such an act of total vision might be structured. Harpur College 26 A connection between the Comedy and the Augustinian modes of vision was proposed by Joscph Mazzeo in Structure and Thought in the Paradiso (Ithaca, 1958), Chap. 4. Mazzeo, however, focusses almost exclusively on Paradiso- a mistaken emphasis in my opinion-and his discussion has little in common with the present essay.</page></plain_text>
