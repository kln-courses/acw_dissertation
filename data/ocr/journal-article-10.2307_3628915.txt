<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PUEBLO KACHINA CULT: A HISTORICAL RECONSTRUCTION' FRANK G. ANDERSON LONG AGO Hermann Haeberlin wrote, in referring to the conceptual aspects of the Pueblo kachina cult, "From the ideas we find associated with this wor- ship today, we cannot, of course, draw any inferences whatsoever as to its probable origin or its historical development." The investigation of these problems, there- fore, and of the "phenomena of assimilation and reinterpretation which have doubtlessly taken place, as well as the discrimination of primary and secondary elements necessarily fall outside of the scope of our considerations."2 If we were to accept this position as applying to all aspects of the kachina cult, which would imply that historical reconstruction from modem data is impossible or invalid, the only sources of historical information would then be archaeological remains and documentary materials. For the kachina cult these sources are very poor. Archaeol- ogy does not even provide us with absolutely certain evidence of the existence of a pre-Conquest kachina cult, and the documentary material gives us essentially only a static description of parts of it at one point in time, the mid-seventeenth century. Fortunately, however, it is not necessary to take the extreme position, which indeed Haeberlin himself did not occupy. Distributional data are available, and many clues to history may be found therein. Their implications, moreover, may be checked by other tools of the "inferential method," such as the associations of cultural traits and complexes, and linguistic data. By these means something of the history of the kachina cult may be inferred, at least in its broad outlines. This is all that will be attempted, and even the inferences here drawn are not advanced with any claim to certainty. I believe, however, that they follow from the facts as they are known today. There is much variability in the kachina cult from town to town, but its under- 1 This paper presents the conclusions of a survey of published and unpublished materials on the kachina cult.

It is most complex in the western Pueblos (Hopi, Zufii, Western Keres), becoming simpler to the eastward. Among the Tiwa (Isleta, Taos) it all but disappears, since there is here little objective observance of the cult, and only the rudimentary conceptual background. Omitting the Tiwa as definitely marginal, the general character of the cult may be outlined as follows. The beliefs concerning the kachinas are everywhere much the same. They are benevolent, anthropomorphic beings, living in mountains, springs, or lakes, and bringers of various blessings, particularly rain and crops. Offerings are made to them, corn meal (and other food) and prayer-sticks or prayer-feathers being most important. Even masks are "fed" and treated reverently. Everywhere the kachinas have a special association with "spruce" (Douglas fir), which is used in many ways in kachina dances and ceremonies. The definition of these spirits is everywhere difficult due to their confusion in varying degree with other super- naturals, particularly the Cloud spirits and the Chiefs of the Directions. Though generally benevolent, the kachinas can also be dangerous if not properly treated, and some of them are always dangerous, as disease-bringers or cannibals. Some are severe disciplinarians, of children and adults. Masks also may be dangerous, in keeping with the fact that the mask is the most important part of the costume, transforming its wearer into the real kachina, who today thus visits the pueblos. Aside from the masks, dance costume presents few variations from town to town, and this is true also of group dance steps and figures, the behavior of the indi- vidualized "side dancers," the characteristic calls of the kachinas (who do not speak, as a rule), and music. In general only men participate in kachina observ- ances, and everywhere clowns are much in evidence in connection with them. An association of the kachinas with the human dead is common, but apparently not universal. Their origin is accounted for in various ways. Kachina mythology in general is best developed in the west, as are also kachina ceremonies, masks, and dolls. With regard to organization, the most striking feature is the extent to which it is integrated with the general socio-ceremonial structure of each town, so that the cult is served by a wide variety of types of associations - clan, moiety, kiva group, or medicine society. Everywhere, however, participation in the kachina cult is a minimum religious requirement for men, and it involves an initiation which follows essentially the same pattern in all towns.3 As Hawley has pointed out,4 the age of the cult is difficult to determine, since direct evidence is so scanty. The best archaeological data seem to indicate the 3 For fuller descriptive material on the kachina cult as a whole, the reader is referred to Parsons, 1939, passim, and the works cited therein. 4 Hawley, 1937, p. 644.</page><page sequence="3">406 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY existence of masks like those of today as early as the Salado occupation of the Gila area, perhaps in the fourteenth century,' and since masks seem the most char- acteristic material concomitant of the kachina cult, the cult may also have existed then, and perhaps much earlier. This bit of evidence receives added significance from the fact that the existence of the cult in the same area and at the same time is suggested by the rather clearly Pueblo-linked elements of the Pima-Papago mask complex,6 hardly to be interpreted as derived through the Apache. From Luxin's account of the Espejo expedition,7 we may infer the presence of a well-established kachina cult on the Rio Grande in the late sixteenth century, and its flourishing condition in the middle of the seventeenth century argues for some antiquity (see below). Bandeliers believed the "cachinas" to be aboriginal, even arguing that, though unobserved or unreported, they were performed by the Zufii when Coronado was there. But Bandelier's interpretation of the term "ca- china" was not that of today. He says, The origin of the word is found in the Tehua language, where "Ka-tzin-a" signifies the spirits of the fetiches of game. To dance a Katzina was therefore to perform some animal dance with the object of performing an incantation, either for purposes of the hunt, or for war, or some other work of public utility. The deer dance, . . . the dance of the mountain sheep, the much discredited snake dance, in fact, all animal dances, are the original Cachinas. But the name was very soon extended to all idolatrous dances in general, including even the scalp dance.9 This understanding of the word may very well reflect that of the Spaniards of the seventeenth century, and if so, we are again somewhat in the dark as to the true extent of the modem form of the kachina cult at that time. That it existed seems certain, however. The linguistic evidence, such as it is, seems either noncommittal on the point of age or seems to imply relative recency, but this need not be construed as neces- sarily indicating origin in the immediate past. That the cult in its full development may well be very recent is indicated, however, by other evidence. For example, Herzog says,1' The fact that neither the corn-grinding songs, nor their Pima parallels show anything comparable to the split into a double stanza so characteristic of kachina songs . . . may strengthen the view that the exuberance of the kachina development among the Pueblos is a comparatively recent matter. 5 Haury, 1945, pp. 198-200. 6 Parsons, 1939, pp. 1000-1004. 7 Hammond and Rey, 1929, p. 79. 8 Bandelier, 1893, p. 195. 9 Bandelier, 1890-92, pp. 151-152, 153. 10 Herzog, 1936, p. 320.</page><page sequence="4">KACHINA CULT 407 Other indications are found in the known cases of the invention of new kachinas, their borrowing, and the multiplication of dances and their repetition. That the cult in its beginnings was very much simpler than that of today is therefore obvious, and something at least may be said as to its probable "original" form. Everyone seems agreed, regardless of their theories as to the origin of later developments, that there has long existed in the Southwest and Mexico a set of beliefs and practices which preceded the specific development of the Pueblo kachina cult - and other similar cults elsewhere - and which prepared the way for the acceptance and flowering of that cult. Bunzel, for example, accepts Parsons' suggestion that it received impetus from contact with Catholicism, but that the larger patterns or the underlying concepts are of European origin seems more doubtful. Communication with the supernatural through impersonation, the use of masks in spectacular ceremonies for rain, fertility, and healing are widely distributed in aboriginal America, and many of the most striking features of the cult flourished in pre-Columbian Mexico.11 Parsons herself, however, has indicated in much greater detail the elements making up this substratum of belief and ritual which presumably underlies the kachina cult. It included the following: rain or weather spirits of the directions, still vaguely distinguished from the kachinas proper; the mountain-dwelling cannibal giant; animal dances of mimetic character; war societies with clown traits; perhaps masks - at least elaborate "make-up" and headdress.12 She suggests, specifically, that the kiva groups were originally war groups . . . ; that upon their initiation of the youth as warrior was based kachina initiation . . . ; that sex restrictions imposed upon kachina impersonators derived in part from sex taboo in war . . . ; that the ideology of the kachina was basically that of the Chiefs of the Directions or Cloud spirits with a flavor of Catholic hagiology; and that kachina dancing grew out of saint's-day dance, war dance for the dead, and hunt or animal dance. Impersonation of the Spirits with dramatization was a very old practice which lent itself to impersonation through the mask; the god or priest-chief mask was also an old trait, but the dance mask or general mask usage may have been encouraged or developed comparatively late. War or hunt burlesque . . . was probably the basis of clowning and burlesque in connection with kachina dances.13 All of this would give the kachina cult a rather broad base of old and widespread elements. Looking specifically at the Pueblos, it would be necessary to assume the existence of a proto-kachina complex no more developed than that at Taos, which is indeed very simple. Parsons has noted that the Taos cult, if such it may be called, 11 Bunzel, 1930, p. 903. 12 Parsons, 1928, p. 596; 1929, p. 280. 13 Parsons, 1939, pp. 1120-1121.</page><page sequence="5">408 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY may be interpreted as the result of diffusion to the margin of the Pueblo area, or as representing the original cult which came to be highly developed in the western pueblos but remained unchanged at Taos. In support of this there is evidence elsewhere that the ideology of the Chiefs of the Directions or of the Cloud boys underlies that of the kachina; and the Shiwanna or Storm spirits of the southern pueblos have some distinction, however confused, from the kachina. Parallels between Taos and Zufii are mentioned - six kivas with each boy initiated into one; initiation "tempered by the kachina cult"; Zufii kachina society conducts pilgrimage to lake; association of kiva groups with rain-making. Zufii "kachina efflorescence" is stated to be due to Catholicism, and in Parsons' opinion, if the results of such outside influence on Zufii are removed, "we are left with a striking parallelism between Zufii and Taos in their ceremonial life."'4 I am inclined to think, however, that this is no more than a "parallelism," partly fortuitous, partly the result of similar antecedents. The parallels cited seem to me unconvincing, questionable, and not sufficiently specific. The best is similarity in the number of kivas and the affiliation of each boy with one. But at Taos girls too are affiliated, and there is a seventh kiva, apparently used somewhat differently from the others, so that even this parallel is none too precise, and it requires supplementary hypothe- ses to explain the smaller number of kivas in the intervening area. Moreover, if one strips Zufii ceremonialism down to something resembling Taos, why not go farther? By sloughing off complexities and reinterpreting what remains, the possi- bilities are boundless. For our purposes, then, it seems better to accept as the sub- stratum of the kachina cult those elements which have a wider general distribution than the Pueblos alone. We have then a list of traits essentially common to all Pueblos and many other peoples of the Southwest and Mexico, and including some which are found over an even wider area. On this basis the kachina cult was built up. There are logically three possible sources for it: (1) local inventiveness among the Pueblos themselves, (2) other Indian groups, and (3) Whites. These will be briefly considered in reverse order. Parsons at one time15 attempted to derive almost the whole of the kachina cult from Spanish Catholic sources. Her hypothesis was that it was largely post-Spanish, starting with Spanish clown masks such as are worn by the Grandfathers [of Isleta, etc.] and then developing, in the western pueblos (particu- larly Zufii) into the efflorescent, anti-church mask system of today. [In another place, she says] Presumably, in the beginning, the Friars contributed deliberately to the 14 Parsons, 1936, p. 115. 15 Parsons, 1930, p. 347 fn.</page><page sequence="6">KACHINA CULT 409 process of assimilation. Finding their pagans given to dancing, war dance or mimetic animal dance, would they not seek to substitute for these the religious dances of the Church? They would have been aided by Mexican Indians who came with them and later by Mexican colonists. Of the latter, there have always been more in the east. After 1680, the Hopi had no missions, and at Zufii the mission was withdrawn early in the nineteenth century. "My guess is," says Parsons, "that a great deal in the nature of ceremonial adaptation followed the withdrawal. . . . The kachina cult throve and blossomed." Though having the same foundation as in the east, it became thoroughly distinctive and was no longer recognized as derivative."1 Later, Parsons modified her stand so as to allow for a considerably greater native element in the cult, and Spanish elements were then seen as having been assimilated into a fundamentally aboriginal complex. With this view I think we may agree, though the role of Spanish Catholicism may have been less important even than Parsons finally admitted. The problem of the precise extent of such influence will be exceedingly difficult to solve, if not impossible, because of the thorough reworking of whatever material may have come to the Pueblos from this source. Beals17 and Brew have discussed the possibility of influences from native Mexico as the origin of the kachina cult. The parallels between the latter and the Tlaloc cult of the Aztec are strongly suggestive, and if diffusion occurred, the route probably lay through northwest Mexico, but the difficulties of this interpre- tation are numerous, chiefly because of the lack of detailed information on the peoples responsible for the alleged transmission. It is also difficult to be sure what, if anything, was transmitted. As Brew has said,is The Southwestern manifestations referred to above are not obviously similar to Mexi- can traits. . . . If the Katchina cult came from the south it was modified to fit Pueblo ceremonialism to a much greater extent than seems to have been the case with the "cult" referred to in the Southeast. There are, however, other possibilities to be considered in investigating the theory of Katchina-Tlaloc connections. Some or much of the change from Tlaloc to Katchina may have taken place in Northern or Western Mexico. The question must be regarded as open. The third logical possibility - that of wholly local development of the cult - impresses me as most unlikely. The elements it shares with a large area of western 16 Parsons, 1928, pp. 596-597. 17 Beals, 1932. 18 Brew, 1944, pp. 244-245.</page><page sequence="7">410 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY North America and Mexico are too numerous. But that whatever was borrowed was thoroughly reworked is very clear. There is nothing really like the kachina cult outside of the Pueblos, except among peoples, like Navaho or Pima, who have influenced or been influenced by them. A combination of the three hypotheses seems indicated. To a substratum of widely distributed elements have been added a few, probably including masks and some elements of clowning, from the south. Later, elements from Spanish Catholic belief and practice were taken over, and the cult was stimulated by this contact. But integrative forces, which seem strong in Pueblo culture, and native invention have played highly important roles in producing the modem kachina cult. It is, then, to be regarded as the unusually well developed local form of a widespread type of religious cult. Once the kachina cult was established in its center of distribution, which has always been located among the western pueblos, the process of diffusion to other towns began. Parsons envisioned this process as follows: The kachina cult spread from Zufii, whence in fact it is still spreading, to the Hopi, through the associations with the immigrant group probably Keresan, that had settled at Sichumovi after living some time at Zufii; to Acoma, where there was no resident missionary; to Laguna; likewise to the Eastern Keres, to Jemez, and circling out, to the Tewa, and even to Isleta and Taos. No doubt even in the eighteenth century this process had begun, but it was in the first half of the nineteenth century, I surmise, that a great impetus was given to the distribution. It met with opposition from the Church and even from natives (as at Laguna where the Chakwena was opposed). As early as 1553 there was a law in Spain against wearing masks. In 1716 and 1745 more drastic laws were enacted [resulting in] that secretiveness of the kachina cult which precludes all Mexicans from looking on at kachina dances, and in the East all Whites. Further inquiry into the history of religious dancing and other religious folk prac- tices in Spain, . . . and inquiry into medieval survivals of Mexico as well as into Fran- ciscan missionary records in the Southwest, will throw light, I trust, on what took place there in the Spanish-Pueblo religious life of the eighteenth century and early in the nineteenth.1" This inquiry has not yet been made, and interesting though its results might be, they probably would throw little light on the diffusion of the cult, since the earlier documentary material - that of the mid-seventeenth century - seems to indicate the presence of a flourishing kachina cult everywhere in the east at that time. 19 Parsons, 1928, pp. 597-598.</page><page sequence="8">KACHINA CULT 411 Parsons' dates, therefore, are too late by a couple of hundred years at least. Also she underrated, I believe, the position of the Western Keres as co-leaders, with Zufii, in the cult's development. Otherwise, I believe this statement of the diffusion process is probably fairly accurate. The role of the Western Keres is most clearly indicated by the fact that the word "kachina" is itself, apparently, of Keresan origin, and by the distribution of many individual kachina impersonations. The Keres were not as important as the Zufii, but they merit more attention as disseminators than they have so far received. The explanation of the disparity between west and east in the development of the kachina cult by the relatively simple hypothesis of diffusion from Zufii to the Rio Grande has been questioned. As Bunzel says,20 It has been suggested that the katcina cult is of western origin and never took deep root in the east; and, conversely, in the east it has been crowded out by church worship while it continued to flourish in the west, where Catholic influence was less strong. Either or both may be true in the absence of any conclusive evidence. Parsons, in line with her hypothesis of Spanish derivation of the cult, found a way of combining the possibilities in a very plausible explanation: 21 This is, I think, what happened: the beginnings of the acculturation between Pueblo and Spanish . . . took place in the eastern pueblos as well as in the western, or at least at Zufii. In the East, assimilation did not develop beyond a certain point: with the continuous presence of the Catholic missions, and an increasing number of Mexican neighbors, Catholic ideology and Catholic rituals held their own distinctively; whereas at Zufii the European influence was comparatively slight, so that early in the nine- teenth century even the mission lapsed. Catholic theory and practice were taken over into the native life and made over much more thoroughly than in the East. From Zufii the assimilated product spread, to the Hopi, to the East. In other words, we find in the East two layers of acculturation, so to speak . . . , the older, Eastern layer, and the layer from the West, of which the mask cult is the most notable part. In a specific case, too, that of the Turtle dance and other maskless kachina dances, Parsons22 has allowed alternative explanations - that they are the original forms to which Zufii added masks, or that in the east the Zufii dances were copied with- out mask. I believe the second alternative to be preferable. These are the basic kachina dances and presumably the oldest. If they spread to Zufii, why would masks have been added to them unless masked dancing were already established there? On the other hand, the dropping of masks in the Church-controlled east is 20 Bunzel, 1930, p. 900. 21 Parsons, 1929, p. 283. 22 Parsons, 1928, p. 587.</page><page sequence="9">412 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY easy to understand. This explanation, moreover, is practically required if Parsons' (former) hypothesis of Spanish derivation of the cult is rejected, as I think it must be. The diffusion of the cult involved strains of various kinds in the different towns, as it impinged upon different conceptual and socio-ceremonial systems. As Beals has said,23 "Unquestionably . . . the kachina cult did not obliterate older religious concepts, nor was it unaffected by them." This process of integration may be seen in connection with kiva groups, clans, moieties, and societies. Its result has been a considerable variation in the types of organization found associated with the cult, except in one respect. Everywhere it is associated with the kiva - but I believe that this association, though primary among Zufii and Keres in the func- tional sense, is everywhere secondary in the historical sense. It has been suggested to me24 that the application to kivas of the term estufa (oven) by the Spaniards was not merely a joke. For it undoubtedly referred to the nature of these buildings as sudatories, linking them with similar structures over a vast area from northern California at least to Yucatan. These were used as men's dormitories, meeting rooms, council chambers, workshops, ceremonial rooms, etc. Now the kachina cult is almost exclusively in the hands of men, all adult men. What could be more natural, then, than that it became (or remained -see below), everywhere, associ- ated with kivas? It could not well be otherwise. All of the evidence - ethnological, archaeological, and linguistic - points to a considerable age for the kiva. On the age of the kachina cult, though it seems clearly pre-Conquest, there is no such conclusive evidence. But its association with kivas is secondary, and though we do not know when or where such association was first made, the Zufii-Acoma situa- tion suggests that area as a very likely possibility (see below). If kivas are found in an archaeological site, then we may say that if a kachina cult existed at that place, it was probably associated in some way with the kivas, but without further evidence we cannot postulate the existence of the cult. The relation of the kachina cult to the medicine societies, particularly among the Keres where these societies are most prominent, should receive some attention. White's original position on the matter may be summarized as follows: though the medicine men seem very necessary to the rain-kachina cult, these functions are secondary to their curing practices and later in development. The small number of kachinas directly associated with the societies indicates an earlier condition when none were so associated. As the kachina cult has grown, masks have naturally been adopted for use in many new ways, and in this growth the societies have become 23 Beals, 1944, p. 250. 24 Orally by Leslie Spier.</page><page sequence="10">KACHINA CULT 413 involved, since "almost all important functions in the pueblo are shared by all the important officers and societies." The societies did not originate the kachina cult, however, and their custody of masks is recent. Kachina dances were attached to the esoteric retreats, and these associations have led to the use of masks at curing and initiation rites. All of these traits, which show little uniformity among the societies, are secondary to their curing activities, which are much alike.25 I believe this to be a very fair statement of the case. White's later views, however, may be somewhat extreme, perhaps as influenced by the peculiar situation at Santa Ana, where the societies appear to have complete control of the kachina cult and it has no associations with the kivas.26 Curiously enough, Parsons has used the Keresan data to arrive at a very differ- ent conclusion. Pointing to mask use at society initiations, and possible general con- trol of masks by Keresan medicine men, she concludes,27 "I have little doubt that the effiorescent mask cult . . . developed out of the more restricted society use of masks." I believe, however, that White's interpretation is fundamentally more sound, partly because it is apparently almost entirely societies of the Keresan type (however far afield) which employ masks. Such societies are rare and relatively unimportant precisely among those western groups - Zufii and Hopi - where the general mask cult flourishes most notably, and Parsons' hypothesis thus seems to put upon them a burden in diffusion out of proportion to their strength. The integration of the kachina cult with kiva organization and with medicine societies are merely aspects of the problem of its integration with the total socio- ceremonial system. A few remarks regarding this broader perspective may be in order. Kroeber's suggestion of a dichotomy in Zufii ceremonialism, communal vs. fraternal, is basically sound, I believe, though admittedly it disregards some of the details. The most significant fact about it is that it holds elsewhere as well-- very clearly, for example, among the Hopi, though here it is differently expressed. Kroeber says,28 That this cleavage is a conceptual and largely a conscious one, does not of course make it original in Pueblo religion. It may have been so; or again, it may have developed only gradually out of a former more economical state of undifferentiation. There is no doubt that the dualism which pervades the modern Pueblo system of ceremony, is one of partial repetition, and that it is connected with the evident tendency toward exacting elaboration. 25 White, 1930, pp. 617-619. 26 White, 1942, pp. 207 ff. 27 Parsons, 1923, p. 164 fn. 28 Kroeber, 1916, p. 270.</page><page sequence="11">414 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY This is carried out more fully at Zufii, partly because of concentration in one town, "a circumstance almost predestined to emphasize the solidary communal aspects of life." Elaboration of the kachina cult here may thus be partly explained, but it might be pointed out more specifically that this complexity, as compared with Acoma, for example, where the fundamentals are much the same, may be due to the inclusion at Zufii of cult observances derived from at least six ancestral towns. This, obviously, would tend to crowd the calendar at Zufii, while Acoma, with no such history of fusion, retained a series of rites conceivably comparable in num- ber and type with those which might have been found at a single Zufii town in the sixteenth century. One further type of integration should be mentioned, namely, that of the assimilation of foreign, particularly Spanish Catholic, elements into the cult. Par- sons, after abandoning her earlier views, described this process as follows:29 The evidence remains baffling, but I am tentatively concluding that the clown and kachina mask, the Kachina cult, is of independent Indian origin combining with Catho- lic contribution. Also I believe that the history of all the other ritual elements men- tioned as jointly Catholic and Pueblo has been that of the mask, the end product is a convergence rather than an out-and-out borrowing well acculturated. Aboriginal usage or rite has been fed or stimulated by the Catholic rite. From the present viewpoint, this is an essentially unexceptionable statement. Due to the scantiness of older documentary material, there is little direct evi- dence of the extent or types of change in the kachina cult, except for the last seventy-five years or so. Even for this period, we have relatively little. The changes have been for the most part additive, resulting in the observed efflorescence of the cult, even while its strictly religious significance has been diminishing. Parsons has well summarized these recent changes, and there seems to be no reason to suppose that those in the more remote past, though probably fewer in the simpler cult, were of an essentially different nature. The same factors appear to have been operating for a long time. Parsons says,30 "Innovations are constantly occurring in the kachina cult, which is very hospitable to novelties; new impersonations, new dances, new songs, new details of costume or array." "Involution by budding," she remarks further, "is lively." Changes in details of an impersonation create a new kachina, as Upikaiupona from Kokokshi at Zufii, or a new one may be asked for, as one may be asked for from Pautiwa, the Zufii kachina chief. "Buffalo was novel but as a kachina he was comfortably familiar, like a newly canonized saint from another nation." This is a characteristic type of change, within the pattern. 29 Parsons, 1939, p. 1073. 30 Idem, p. 1122.</page><page sequence="12">KACHINA CULT 415 In connection with changes in the get-up of kachina it has been pointed out that they occur more readily among recently introduced or borrowed kachina. . . . The same principle applies, I surmise, to the Kachina cult as a whole in comparison with the society rain or curing cults, the older and more conservative cults. Besides, the society cults deal with smaller groups. The efflorescence of the Kachina cult may be due in part to the inclusiveness of kachina dance groups. . . . When newly introduced kachina become prominent, old kachina may lapse in popularity or even disappear. The kachina come and go in popularity. . . . Again kachina may lapse in one town but not in another, [as Natashka among Hopi]. On the whole, however, the kachina dance cult has been everywhere in the ascendant, since the turn of the century, if not before.3a It is precisely the earlier period which constitutes the problem. Parsons has made some suggestions with regard to earlier forms or emphases of the kachina cult - that it was once not all for rain, for example, Zufii Shalako being also a hunt and war ceremony, kachina initiations having been perhaps originally war- riors' initiations, and the kiva-kachina groups originally war groups or war-dance societies, as are even today the Hopi W*wachim societies.32 But it is difficult to prove these points. Boys' initiation rites and men's societies may well be in the background, but that the kachina cult was ever specifically a war cult, or that kiva groups were originally war groups, is very doubtful. Documentary evidence would help greatly, but so little has been found that it is more significant in showing resemblances to the modem cult than in showing differences - i.e., even in an imperfect description familiar items may be recog- nized, but the unfamiliar may be such merely because of the imperfect record. From the documentary material, the following rather impressive list of elements of the modem kachina cult seem traceable back to the mid-seventeenth century: masks "like hoods" used in dances, whipping by dancers, use of kivas by dancers, kachina races for food prizes, kachina calls, fasting before dances, masked figures as impersonators of the dead, offerings of prayer-feathers and meal, participation by men only, female impersonations, storage of masks in kiva, horned masks (?), dance kilts (?), dancing performed for all sorts of blessings (food, water, health, etc.), announcement of arrival of dancers, use of spruce (?), masked figures to bring together working parties, figures of water serpent (?), but, according to some accounts, no "idols.""33 What happened, however, during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries? We do not know, for the details recorded by Domin- guez in 1777 are those common to almost all Pueblo dancing, and do not refer 31 Idem, pp. 1124-1125, 1161-1162. 32 Idem, p. 1149. 33 Anderson, 1956, passim.</page><page sequence="13">416 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY specifically to the kachina cult. On the basis of this material, the most that could be said is that if kachina dances were performed, they probably resembled those of today. Except for the very recent period, then, we must rely upon indirect evidence to show the nature of change in the kachina cult. This indirect evidence is pro- vided in the modem descriptive material, which shows very clearly that there is endless variation in the elements comprising the cult and in their combination in the several towns. Since the complex itself forms a definite historical unit, the variations existing today must be the result of differential change, and they con- stitute our safest criteria for such change. The nature of these variations has already received some attention. Particularly significant, I think, are (1) those in the complexity of the cult, which show very clearly the elaboration it has received - at Zufii, for example - largely through the repetition of patterns of organiza- tion and activity in the several dance groups, and of patterns of costuming and behavior in different specific kachinas; (2) the variations in the mode of integra- tion of the cult with other aspects of the differing socio-ceremonial systems, show- ing that adaptive changes have occurred widely, in the cult itself, and, to a lesser extent, in the preExisting systems; and (3) the variations in the specific kachinas impersonated, showing more clearly than anything else the operation of the proc- esses of borrowing and of invention, since many of the individual figures are wide- spread, while many others are more narrowly confined, even to single towns. It is gratifying to note that the present reconstruction agrees fundamentally with that suggested, on different grounds, by Hawley.34 The principal source of disagreement, I believe, is that she would apply the term "kachina cult" to what I have here referred to as the "substratum" of that cult. She sees it, therefore, as very early, coming in, probably from Mexico, at the same time as agriculture, and being first established in the Mogollon area of southeastern Arizona and south- western New Mexico in conjunction with big kivas. Later it, and these kivas, spread northward and eastward, carried by ancestral Keresans and Zufii. Little kivas, in Hawley's view, are northern, associated with Tanoans and Hopi, and having originally uses different from those of the big kivas. The two strains have now blended, somewhat differently in different areas. My view of the kachina cult as something more specific, and later, implies that its spread postdates the develop- ments leading to the distribution of modern kiva types, so that their history, interesting though it is, has essentially no bearing on that of the kachina cult. That the modern big kivas (of the Eastern Keres) pertain exclusively to cults involving costuming and dramatization and whose purpose is to produce crops, 34 Hawley, 1950, passim.</page><page sequence="14">KACHINA CULT 417 rain, and fertility - kachina, Koshare, Corn dance, etc. - I will not deny, but I hold that the kachina cult is merely a relatively late specific manifestation of this more generalized set of beliefs and practices. If Hawley's view is accepted, however, her reconstruction seems sound. It is supported by various pieces of archaeological evidence from the general Mogollon area, including anthropomor- phic pictographs and pottery designs, and the presence here in cave deposits of numerous prayer-sticks. The latter seem to be specifically a part of the kachina cult in Hawley's generalized sense. If it is remembered, then, that her reconstruc- tion refers for the most part to events of a period earlier than that covered by the reconstruction presented here, it will be seen that they are on the whole in agree- ment or are complementary. (Recalling Parsons' suggestion that Hopi clan masks may be very old, and the clan associations of Hopi kivas, it might be suggested that the "line dancers" may be the specifically southern, Mogollon, contribution, while the "side dancers" or kachina chiefs, may be of northern derivation, at least in part, so that the modern cult is a fusion of two earlier cults - but this must be for the present mere speculation.) In summary, it may be said that conservatism in pattern, frequently coupled with hospitality to innovations in detail, has been the theme of the history of the kachina cult. Conservatism in pattern is shown in three ways. In the first place, there has apparently been retained everywhere among the Pueblos a characteristic set of concepts concerning the kachinas or similar beings - concepts which, be- cause of their wide distribution through the Southwest and Mexico, we may safely assume to have a respectable age, an age certainly greater than any developed kachina cult. In the second place, wherever this cult has spread, it has been modi- fied, particularly in its organizational aspects, to fit the prevailing socio-ceremonial pattern. It has been caught up, so to speak, into the existing systems, so that its position today relative to various types of social groups is as varied as are the positions of those groups relative to each other. Third, once each tribal cult had attained the formation of a pattern of its own, new elements were forced to con- form to that pattern, as in the case of the addition of masks to dances recently borrowed by Zufii from the Plains, or the picking up of clan associations by Sio (Zuiii) Shalako on First Mesa, or moiety associations by borrowed Tewa kachinas. That these many adaptations are made, however, emphasizes the hospitality of the cult to innovation in detail, whether borrowed or invented. It would appear that almost anything can somehow be fitted in. It seems astonishing, given this power of adaptation and the common ideology, that variability in the kachina cult from town to town is as great as it is. Two inferences may be drawn from this, I think: first, that the cult is not very old, though definitely pre-Conquest, and</page><page sequence="15">418 SOUTHWESTERN JOURNAL OF ANTHROPOLOGY second, that it has been everywhere an active, vital cult in which change has re- cently been so rapid that the diffusion of new elements cannot proceed fast enough to level the differences. The changes, however, remain within the framework of the general ideology and the specific socio-ceremonial patterns of the several towns.
