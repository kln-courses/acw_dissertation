<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS H. W. F. SAGGS : The encounter with the divine in Mesopotamia and Israel. (Jordan Lectures in Comparative Religion, xII.) xviii, 243 pp. London: University of London, Athlone Press, 1978. ?8.50. A book written by a scholar who is an expert in the Mesopotamian field and which takes the form of a comparison of certain aspects of Mesopotamian and Israelite religion is potentially of great value and Professor Saggs does not disappoint the expectations of the reader. The book is well written and produced and only three small typographical errors have been noted (p. 112, 'staeg' for 'stage '; p. 130, 'exta' for 'extant'(?); p. 161, 'apostacy' for ' apostasy '). Those who are principally concerned with Meso- potamian studies will have their critical powers teased and provoked by what Saggs has to say about Mesopotamian religion. The present reviewer has looked more closely at the critical positions adopted by the author in respect of Old Testament material and the influence which these have exercised on his comparative study of the two religions. In the opening section on method his state- ment on the function of form criticism (' To get back to the setting of the religious litera- ture in the cult ', p. 13) is not one to which general assent will be given. It is true that the form-critical method has been largely used in this way and that alleged demonstrations of original cultic Sitze im Leben for Gattungen have been achieved by means of it. This, however, is no more than a particular applica- tion of the method, and form criticism in principle is concerned with the Sitz of a Gattung, whatever that Sitz may be. When Saggs says that ' the Gattung is the framework in which the idea is preserved, not necessarily the setting in which it was created' (p. 14), the point which he is making is not clear and his illustration 'Zounds! ' does nothing to relieve this obscurity. The circumstance that one can discover from the OED that ' Zounds ! ' is an abbreviation of 'By God's wounds!' will not inform us how the expletive functions in the particular literary contexts where it appears. The important discovery is not that it has this etymology and that it may once have been used with a solemn intention. The necessary consideration is rather the function- ing of 'Zounds! ' in any piece of literature where it appears. Thus the suggestion that the setting is in some way merely a container and the ' conceptual meaning' is more funda- mental than the meaning within the setting and is to be had by abstraction from it is a misunderstanding. The idea itself or the essential idea will not be reached by discovering the setting in which it originally appeared, although such a Gattungsgeschichte is histori- cally valuable, nor by disengaging the 'con- cept' from any setting in which it appears. The reference to Paul Radin carries the discussion beyond the limits usually accepted by form critics and there is no harm in that: 'Any manifestation of religion in the form of a religious text must have come in the first place (to use the terminology of Paul Radin) in answer to a psychical crisis within a religious man' (p. 13). This is a consideration which ought not to be neglected, although it is likely that it has simply been assumed by those who hold that the Psalms are cultic and are designed for public, liturgical use. When it is said that the Sitz of the book of Psalms is cultic there is no suggestion that they were composed by a committee of priests rather than by individuals who were gifted in composition. The issue is rather whether they were composed in the first place for liturgical use or whether they were effusions of private religious experience which were subsequently adopted for cultic use. The main differences between Gunkel and Mowinckel, however, do not arise in this area. They are connected rather with a difference of opinion as to whether extant psalms are, for the most part, cultic and liturgical compositions or whether they are original cultic compositions which have been ' spiritualized' and captured as private expressions of individual piety. The other interesting question which arises in the section on method concerns the nature of the account of Israelite religion which is preserved in the Old Testament. Saggs observes that what we have in the ' canon' is a prescriptive account of OT religion or a definition of normative Yahwism. The docu- ments are not principally occupied with actual, empirical manifestations of Israelite religion and these are allowed to appear only as aberrations in relation to the norm. Hence Saggs says, 'To obtain a valid picture for comparison, it is Yahwism as it was (the Yahwism of historical fact), not Yahwism as it should have been (the Yahwism of theolo- gical judgement), nor Yahwism as it ultimately became in consequence of the repression of certain features, that we must consider' (p. 22). There is a measure of validity in Saggs's affirmation, but the distinction between ' actual ' and' theological ' or between empirical Yahwism and an expurgated Yahwism should not be pressed too far. The normative Yahwism has been determined in decisive respects by the actual Yahwism and is not simply the creation of canonical thinkers, reformers, and expurgators-an ideal religion which was never practised. However it may have been refined and subjected to norms of orthodoxy, it still had to be recognizable as a particular, historical religion. In fact Saggs's procedures cannot tolerate too much of a divorce between 'the Yahwism of historical fact' and 'the Yahwism of theological judgement '. If the actual, histori- cal religion has been entirely superseded in the OT by 'the Yahwism of theological judge- ment', the OT cannot be used in order to reconstruct the history of Israelite religion. But Saggs has greater confidence in the OT</page><page sequence="2">370 REVIEWS as a source of Religionsgeschichte than many OT scholars and he draws conclusions about ' Mosaic religion' and 'Patriarchal religion ' from which some would abstain. Thus he holds (pp. 36-8) that the particularism of the final form of the Moses traditions justifies a con- clusion that the religion of the historical Moses must have displayed a similar, narrow nationalism, and that the universalist ten- dencies in the final form of the patriarchal narratives are an indication that patriarchal religion itself contained the seeds of such universalism. Some of the practitioners of Oberlieferungsgeschichte would argue with good reason that what a corpus looks like at the end of its development does not enable us to make historical conclusions about the religion of Moses or the religion of the patriarchs. The main topic of ch. ii is creation doctrine and the bearing of this on the widening of the horizons of Israelite religion. Whether or not Saggs is right in supposing that Jer. 27: 4-6 derives from the historical prophet Jeremiah is a critical nicety which may be left aside, but in any case he makes this single passage bear a heavy burden of interpretation. In the context of the chapter the reference to Yahweh as creator in 27: 5 has an incidental character which one would not suspect from the weight which Saggs attaches to it and the conclusions which he builds on it. He makes everything turn on the claim by Yahweh to control kingdoms and world history, loosed from any reference to Israel's election and her special position over against Yahweh's dominion. The significance of any new departure in Jer. 27 : 4-6 is surely over-estimated. These verses have to be seen in connexion with the theme of the chapter which is 'the yoke of Nebu- chadnezzar'. This is connected with the symbolic wearing of the yoke by Jeremiah and the encounter between Jeremiah and Hananiah described in Jer. 28. The particular point of all this is to supply a reason why Judah should submit to the Babylonian king. Yahweh created the world and peopled it, and he has the power to dispose of nations as he will. He has resolved to set Nebuchadnezzar at the head of a world empire and it is pointless for Judah to resist. Hence it is not clear that, as an advance in creation doctrine, Jer. 27: 5 is so momentous as Saggs's account would lead us to suppose. However, he finds similar ideas in Deutero-Isaiah (45:12-13) and since most scholars have supposed that Yahweh's status as ' cosmic creator' is a significant part of the teaching of that prophet, the case can be made out on that basis. All the more so since the destination of the argument was that Jer. 27:4-7 perhaps furnished evidence of the influence of Babylonian religion on Israelite religion; that the doctrine of Ashur, the Assyrian God, was modified relative to cosmic creation as a consequence of an encounter with Marduk, and that 'Jeremiah was taking over for Yahweh claims he found already made for Marduk of Babylon' (p. 43). It is understandable that the emphasis on creation theology in Deutero-Isaiah might be partly attributed to the influence of Babylonian religion, if it is supposed that he was a prophet of the Babylonian exile. It is not obvious that passages which Saggs cites (pp. 48 f.) in fact demonstrate that Nebuchadrezzar is emperor of the world in virtue of Marduk's cosmic plan and not because Marduk fights for him. This is a distinction so nice that it is difficult to discern. Thus in connexion with an affirmation of Nebuchadrezzar ('The widespread people, with whom Marduk the Lord filled my hand, I made subject to Babylon') Saggs comments, ' In the last passage quoted, we see a specific distinction between Marduk's granting control of the people to Nebuchadrezzar, which was the god's plan and must come to pass, and the implementation of the plan by warfare, which was Nebuchadrezzar's doing' (p. 49). If the case which Saggs has presented for the influence of Babylonian religion on Yahwistic creation doctrine is complete, it does not appear that the Babylonian con- tribution was a major one. It might have been supposed that something would be made of the creation narrative in Gen. 1:1-2:4, since an exilic provenance may be assumed. Saggs's view is that far from influencing the thought of this passage Babylonian concepts have had the effect of driving the writer towards antithetical positions. He has gone out of his way to emphasize his differences with Babylonian religion and so the narrative is ' a reaction to Babylonian concepts ' (p. 52). There is a deliberate separation of light from the sun and moon, 'so that what the Baby- lonians thought of as astral deities, or the symbols of astral deities, might be seen as mere physical instruments working the purpose of the one God' (p. 53). The supposition that teham preserves the faint recollection of a conflict associated with the process of creation is mistaken and there is no necessary connexion between conflict and cosmic creation. Such a conclusion has rested on a particular interpretation of Eniima Elis which, however, is a composite work, analysed by Saggs into six separate myths. The mytho- logical fragments in the OT which allude to conflict may not be used in order to reconstruct a Canaanite or Israelite creation narrative of which conflict was an element. When we reflect at the end of this chapter on ' The Divine in Creation', we are left with a question about the sources of OT creation theology. Saggs says that Deutero-Isaiah achieves his universalism by developing a creation doctrine which features the deity El and he suggests that this is a reintroduction of 'a universalism latent in patriarchal religion but largely lost in the mainstream of Mosaic Yahwism, despite occasional protests by earlier prophets' (p. 51). But this is to turn away from Babylon and focus attention on Canaan. Eissfeldt has argued that Yahwism was enriched by El creation theology, not in connexion with the religion of the patriarchs, but in connexion with a syncretism of Yahwism and El religion subsequent to the settlement in Canaan, for it is this that we are to infer from the references to El in the patriarchal narra- tives. More particularly, any account of OT creation doctrine must devote attention to the book of Psalms. The 'Kingship of Yahweh ' psalms are rich in creation doctrine and if one</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 371 is to look for a historical moment when El creation theology decisively affected Yahwism, it must be the occasion of the capture of Jerusalem, the appropriation of a Jebusite sanctuary whose deity may have been El Elyon, and the symbiosis of the old cult and the new one. Saggs opens his chapter on 'The Divine in history ' with severe criticisms of Gerhard von Rad in the course of which he alleges that von Rad has forced OT evidence 'into a Christian straitjacket' (p. 68). The effect of this long attack (pp. 64-9) is to postpone the opening of the chapter and a detailed con- sideration of it would introduce elements of disproportion into a review. Saggs's principal concern in this chapter is to examine Lambert's view that events were not supposed to be decreed so absolutely in Israel as they were in Mesopotamia, and he introduces a distinction between individual concepts and their categorization: 'There is evidence suggesting that though Israelites did not achieve the categorization of the concepts regarded as divine decrees, the concepts themselves existed' (p. 73). There may have been no general concept of destiny, but there were specific divine decrees by which particular aspects of life were predestined (burial, Gen. 3: 19; seasons, Gen. 8: 22; length of life, Gen. 6 : 3; blood revenge, Gen. 9 : 6; sabbath, Gen. 2:3; labour pains, Gen. 3:16). It is questionable whether the intention of 3: 19 is to decree burial as opposed to other possibilities such as 'being cremated, mummified, eaten cannibalistically or exposed to creatures of the wild' (p. 75). There may be an allusion to burial, but the main thought is that man is composed of dust and will decompose into dust. Again, 8: 22 appears in a context where the emphasis falls on God's promise not to resort again to a judgement which calls in question the integrity of the created order. It is not therefore so much the promulgation of a particular decree as an assurance that no arbitrary act of God will henceforth disturb the stability of the created order. Saggs's conclusion is that no difference in principle can be detected between Mesopo- tamian and Israelite attitudes to destiny as constituted by divine decrees: 'One may certainly feel that there is a greater emphasis upon direct intervention in history in Israel and upon destiny in Mesopotamia, but this impression can hardly be quantified, and even if it is factually based, represents differences of degree, not of principle' (p. 76). With the discussion on destiny so rounded off he takes up the consideration of another of Lambert's dicta that a concept of history which includes the working out of a plan is not found in the Mesopotamian cultural area (p. 79). Saggs presents evidence which, in his view, demon- strates that Sargon II was used by Ashur in order to prosecute a plan (pp. 81 ff.). The citations contain references to a renewal of the cultus and to world dominion: 'He (Ashur) fully made over the land of Assyria into my hands for administration and direction; he made my weapons bitter over the four (world) regions' (p. 81). There is evidence of a belief in an enduring dynasty 'a century before King David' (p. 82): 'You have given to him his lordly destiny for power, and said that his high-priestly seed should stand for ever in the temple Ehursagkurkurra' (p. 82). Saggs's response to Lambert's opinion is that 'the gods, in particular Ashur, were pro- moting Assyrian imperialism, not in terms of a destiny decreed in primeval times, but as an activity within history relating to extending the might of the nation Assyria and per- petuating the dynasty' (p. 85). Albrektson and Saggs have perceived that the distinction made between Israelite religion and other ancient Near Eastern religions, in terms of the purposeful, historical activity of Yahweh in the one and the non-significance of history as a sphere of divine purpose in the others, has acquired a schematic tidiness or even absoluteness which does not arise from a careful weighing of the evidence. There is, however, a suspicion that ambiguities asso- ciated with the word 'plan' need to be teased out further. Those who have argued that history is seen as an area of special significance in OT religion have not simply had in mind the ideology of Davidic monarchy--the en- during dynasty and the programme of world dominion attached to the Davidic king. The evidence which Saggs produces of 'a con- tinuing dynamic plan' (p. 85) in Assyrian religious thought would not be regarded by them as comparable to the OT 'plan' con- summated in and through historical existence, because it lacks a teleological element. What is being argued is that in the OT history is viewed as aimed at a goal and that the direction which it takes is meaningful, because its unfolding is the means chosen by Yahweh to implement his plans and bring them to fulfilment. Saggs does not appear to be dis- cussing a divine plan and its relation to the historical process in this sense and his Assyrian evidence does not demonstrate the existence of such a plan. In the concluding part of the chapter (pp. 87-92), which is occupied with the relation of Yahweh to nature, Saggs's mode of argu- ment recalls his treatment of Gen. 1: 1-2: 4. The Mesopotamian tendency is to equate deities with heavenly bodies, or, at least, to blur the distinction between numen and phenomenon. The approximation of deity to heavenly body is not characteristic of the OT, where sun-worship is regarded as apostasy : ' The sun is merely a part of Yahweh's creation, and wholly distinct from him. Yahweh is never regarded as being immanent in the sun' (p. 91). Saggs prescribes a via negativa as a way of distinguishing between Yahweh and Mesopotamian gods. The intention of such a procedure will be to deny to Yahweh what is attributed to the gods of the ancient near east: he is not manifested plurally; he is not present in natural phenomena; he is not representable in human or animal forms. This is a type of approach which is associated particularly with von Rad. It is a recognition of a 'hiddenness of Yahweh' which dis- courages familiarity or a presumption of knowing too much about him. OT religion is marked by a growing awareness of the distance between God and men and by an appreciation</page><page sequence="4">372 REVIEWS that thoughts and words will not contain the mystery. In the chapter on 'The Divine in relation to good and evil' as also in the following chapter on 'Communication with the Divine' Saggs's expository gifts are exercised to very good effect and he achieves an enviable clarity in his explanations of difficult concepts. In a discussion about the relation between demons and deities in Mesopotamia he notes the suggestion that Enmesharra originated as an abstraction ' to comprehend the totality of the concept included in the formless nameless numina known as "the Seven "' (p. 101). According to this view the suppression of ' the Seven' represents a stage at which the anthropomorphic form of Enlil arose. Saggs observes that the accommodation of demons to the gods gave rise to theological problems to which aetiological solutions were attached, sometimes contradictory in character. The depredations of Lamashtu or pdSittu, directed particularly against nursing mothers and babies, could be explained as an activity which was contrary to the will of the gods (she was a rebel daughter of Anu) or on the assumption that she was employed by the gods to limit the numbers of the human race. Saggs's opinion is that the demons were ' originally independent of the gods and some- times hostile to them' (p. 105). They were subsequently represented as agents of the gods or hypostases of them and this movement 'represents a theological process in which there was a progressive denial of the place of the irrational in life' (p. 105). The coexistence of good and evil in Yahweh is not to be explained in terms of the absorp- tion of a demonic element into the nature of Yahweh (pp. 106 if.): the equation of 'god' with 'goodness' and 'demon' with 'evil' is a type of dualism which does not correspond with the texture of Mesopotamian religion and which obstructs the process of comparing it with Israelite religion. While Mesopotamian demons might be a source of evil, whether as the instruments of a god, or independent of a god, or contrary to the will of a god, it was also possible for a god to initiate evil. In Mesopotamian religion the demons were originally expressions of randomness and blind chance in human existence, and so their malevolence was represented as unmotivated. Their incorporation into the divine scheme of things served the ends of a type of piety which could not tolerate an irrational residue in human experience and which strove to explain everything in terms of the will of the gods. Saggs detects a somewhat similar develop- ment in several OT passages. A story which was originally about the unmotivated attack of a demon has been rewritten in terms of a purposeful attack by Yahweh (Gen. 32 : 24-30) and there are other accounts of ' evil spirits ' under Yahweh's control and acting as his agents (pp. 110 ff.). But is Satan in 1 Chr. 21 : 1 indeed a ' hypostatization of the sinister side of Yahweh ' (p. 113) ? For the most part, Saggs is describing a process which brought originally independent demons under the control of gods, but 2 Sam. 24 : 1 (1 Chr. 21 : 1) will not fit into this pattern. If it did, the conclusion would have to be that 1 Chr. 21: 1 represents an earlier stage than 2 Sam. 24: 1, but this would certainly be an erroneous conclusion. Satan is introduced in Chr. because of a piety which will not attribute the incite- ment of David to Yahweh and which is con- cerned to disengage Yahweh from this act of provocation and to attribute it to Satan. It is a piety which in this instance finds a monistic position intolerable and which takes a step towards dualism. In Ludlul bil nemeqi Saggs finds a latent denial of the value of the cult and an agnostic tendency; in the 'Babylonian theodicy' he discerns a conclusion that all men are evil, that it is men who create suffering and not the gods (pp. 118-120). But is this latter conclusion one at which thought can come to rest ? If the gods created men as they are (' With lies and not truth they endowed them for ever '), they made injustice and suffering inevitable. If the chaos in human society is caused by a funda- mental lack of benevolence in the gods, to an ill-willed determinism of which they are the authors, what is the point of saying that the only recourse which man has 'is to throw himself upon the divine mercy' (p. 120) ? The problem of Yahweh's benevolence and the justice of his ways arises in a particularly sharp form in the OT, because he is brought into immediate connexion with the experiences of individuals and is made accountable for everything that happens to them. These are the matters which are raised in Gen. 18 : 22-33 and which are explored more thoroughly in the book of Job whose author may have been acquainted with Ludlul and 'The theodicy' and may owe something to them. The author of Job does not deny the fact of unmerited suffering and he does not follow either of the Mesopotamian solutions. He does not even attempt to solve the problem 'but on the theological level he transcends it' (pp. 120-4). According to Saggs's view the author of Job abdicates from mental strife and rests in a personal communion with the divine where suffering dissolves into nothingness ' (p. 124). There are, however, also important agnostic indications in the book of Job and the lines which Saggs cites from Ludlul (' Who knows the will of the gods in heaven ? ... Where have mortals learnt the way of a god ? ') express significant aspects of Job's complaint. The insoluble problem of the book is at least as theologically significant as the intellectual surrender which, according to Saggs, is the price of release and rest. An important part of the dialogue is the realization that men do not know God and his ways nearly so well as they affect to do. The analogical language which makes God the judge who guarantees justice to individuals assumes an intimacy of superintendence which is divorced from ex- perience. It is a reasonable expectation that a judge in a court of law will dispense justice and access can be had to him, but a theodicy cannot be constructed out of the language of the law courts and the enterprise should be given up. Men do not have this kind of access to God: they do not have the opportunity of engaging in legal arguments with him and</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 373 demanding justice from him. To use analogies which make it appear that God is accessible and accountable as those who hold offices in human society are, is to make a claim to knowledge where the truth is better served by agnosticism and reserve. The question to which Saggs first addresses himself in the chapter 'Communication with the Divine' is whether Mesopotamian divina- tion is fundamentally 'deistic' or 'non- deistic', and he concludes that in essence it has more to do with a concept of causation than with theism or revelation (pp. 125 if.): 'The omen thus represented not a god's decision upon a situation but rather a recog- nized correlation between past and future phenomena. The gods came into the matter only as the divine beings able to intervene to cut the web' (p. 132). It appears, however, from Saggs's subsequent account that the breaking of the chain of causation, brought to light by an evil omen or a bad portent in a dream, 'might be effected by the non-deistic technique of a magical ritual and spell, or by the overtly deistic means of prayer to the Sun-god, or by the two techniques jointly' (p. 134). While evil omens or portents do not predict an ineluctable fate, they do establish a causal nexus which will produce an effect unless extraordinary measures are taken to disturb and override the normal sequence of events. Only a few accounts of dreams, in a personal, historical context, in which messages from a deity to individuals are conveyed, are preserved. Apart from these, which should be regarded as theophanies in the form of dreams, the correlations of portents and consequences in Dream Books are comparable with omen literature. This whole area of prediction arises from what was regarded as a science rather than communications from gods. Whereas good omens or portents do not necessitate any apotropaic activity, bad omens or portents call for measures to ward off the evil con- sequences which are predicted, whether these measures take the form of magical rituals or prayers to gods or a combination of both. Such a portent as 'If (in a dream a man) does the work of a seal-cutter, his son will die ' requires anyone who has had such a dream to take urgent measures in order to prevent the otherwise certain eventuation of what is predicted. 'If he does the work of a fuller, for a poor man (it means) his misfortunes will leave him' does not demand any defensive measures. The happy chain of circumstances which is predicted can be left to eventuate. The argument that divination is fundamentally non-theistic allows that ' divination was taken under the umbrella of deistic religion at a fairly early date, certainly not later than the Old Babylonian period, though probably not earlier than that either ' (p. 137). Apart from dream theophanies, personal communications about future events are com- municated through oracles. These are attested for seventh-century Assyria in the reign of Esarhaddon and are principally spoken by women. The inspired person (ragintu, 'one who calls out') is evidently in a state of ecstasy but the form of inspiration is not known. In some cases the ragintu is a cultic official but in others the oracle would appear to have been uttered by a 'private ecstatic'. The Mari evidence is particularly important: it consists of letters which refer to messages from deities, some of which are dream theo- phanies. In twelve of these letters there are references to messages given through a mahhum 'frenzied person' or 5pilum 'one who gives an answer'. In some places there are indica- tions that the prophet was in an ecstatic state (immahud). Some of this prophesying was a cultic activity but it was not invariably so, since one oracle is spoken by the 'wife of a freeman' who would not have been so designated if she had held a cultic office. Usually Mari oracles consisted of a message of encouragement to the king or contained instruction about religious rites. A striking aspect of all this, and one on which Saggs does not comment, is that all the oracles appear to have been spoken out of the hearing of the king, sometimes at a distance from the court, and to have been subsequently reported to him in letters. This is entirely at variance with the direct delivery of the oracle by the prophet to the person or persons whom it concerns which is the rule in the OT. When he turns to OT prophecy Saggs does well to question whether the present con- sensus of scholarship about certain passages (Amos 5:21-7; Hos. 6:6; Mic. 6:6-8; Isa. 1: 11-17; Jer. 7 : 22-8), to the effect that there is no root and branch condemnation of the cultus by the canonical prophets, is so admirable and satisfactory as is supposed. His employment of Deut. 13: 1-5 is, however, puzzling (p. 149), since there appears to be no appreciation in this passage of the difficulty of distinguishing between 'true' and 'false' prophets, where all prophets speak in Yahweh's name and claim his authority. It is assumed that any prophet who speaks in Yahweh's name is a true prophet, and the Deuteronomic passage turns rather on a true prediction made in the name of' other gods ', maintaining that the accuracy of such a prediction is not a guarantee that it was spoken by a true prophet. The difference between Mesopotamian oracles and those of the OT prophets is, according to Saggs, one of scope. Mesopota- mian oracles relate principally to royal affairs and divulge the will of a god for a particular person in particular circumstances, and there are prophets of this type (e.g. Nathan) in the OT. The oracles of the canonical prophets possess a greater generality and are 'not merely about the behaviour demanded from a particular man in a particular situation but about the behaviour demanded from mankind, not about the intentions of the gods for the immediate circumstance but about God's very nature ' (pp. 151 f.). While Saggs is to be followed in so far as he is indicating that there has recently been an under-estimation of the originality of the prophetic contribution to OT religion, his descriptions of the concerns of the canonical prophets and the spheres in which they operated will not gain general assent. One has the impression that he is representing them as principally teachers of a general, universal ethic. In fact their main concern was with</page><page sequence="6">374 REVIEWS 'immediate circumstances ' and, for the most part, they addressed their messages to urgent, contemporary issues. It is true that rarely did they address individuals, but it was not their practice either to direct their words to 'mankind'. They addressed foreign nations (in so far as the foreign oracles which appear in the books bearing their names are attributable to them), but these bear no resemblance to a universal ethic for mankind. Some passages (e.g. Amos 1:1-2:16) may bear this inter- pretation, but their concern was taken up mainly with their own community which they saw under the threat of disintegration and whose doom they predicted as a theological judgement. Certainly they speak about the future, perhaps even a future which will contain restoration rather than judgement, but all their words arise out of their appreciation of the present state of the community in which they live. Although the final chapter has the title 'Universalism', the subject is not reached until p. 176 and is departed from on p. 183, so that the principle of coherence in the chapter is not obvious. Nevertheless, it has interesting features, not least the indications that ancient men may not have been as different from their modern counterparts as has been sometimes supposed, that they did not after all live in a world dominated by gods, and that secularity is perhaps not so new as has been alleged. We learn that administrators of temples in Erech writing letters to the authorities in Babylon are more concerned with practical problems than they are with theology or mythology and that when negligence or embezzlement are mentioned they appear as cases of in- capacity or dishonesty rather than sins against the gods who, nevertheless, according to the theology, are the owners. Although there are allusions to religious indifference in the OT (Amos8:5; Isa. 56:2; 58: 13; Zeph. 1:12; Jer. 5:12), references to religious practices disapproved by normative Yahwism are more typical of the book, and Saggs concludes that the attitudes of the common man were more dominated by religion in Israel than in Meso- potamia (p. 163). Saggs observes (pp. 165 ff.) that a principal difference between Sumerian and Babylonian creation myths is that only in the Babylonian examples is the blood of a god an ingredient of human nature. This is not intended to convey a theological doctrine-that man's nature partakes of the divine. The questions which give rise to these creation narratives lie within human society and they are attempts to supply answers to these questions: 'They are intended to explain the existence of man himself, ghosts, and various customs of birth and death and other features of human society' (p. 168). The doctrine that man was created to serve the gods is the reflection of a social organization which was characteristic of Sumerian city-states of the first half of the third millennium, where the most powerful institution was the temple estate. This doctrine that man was created to supply labour for the gods, which is absent from OT creation narratives, has as its corollary that the gods are dependent on men who therefore possess bargaining power over against them (p. 170). Saggs accepts Oppenheim's view that there is no personal religious involvement present in Mesopotamian cultic prayers, but he finds evidence of prayer which has a personal intensity outside the cultic sphere. He remarks that since Eli thought that Hannah was drunk, her prayer could not have been accompanied by any recognizable posture or other external features which would have enabled him to recognize that she was at prayer. It was therefore a spontaneous, private approach to God rather than one through recognized cultic channels, although it happened at a cult place (1 Sam. 1:10, 12-13). If, however, we are to argue in this kind of way, it would also follow that private prayer must have been a rare phenomenon, since the high priest would not otherwise have misconstrued it as a state of inebriation. Saggs approaches the topic of universalism through a consideration of Deut. 32: 8-9, although it is arguable that this passage is more concerned with monotheism than it is with universalism, and Saggs's comment, ' A monotheism precludes such a view ' (p. 176) is perplexing. It is probably correct that Elyon is, in the original conception, the supreme God who delegates responsibilities to other gods of whom Yahweh is one, but an attempt has been made to make this council of gods compatible with monotheistic Yahwism by identifying Yahweh with Elyon and by repre- senting the other deities as angels or as heavenly beings who are less than deities. This is obscured by i8 n l (MT), but is indicated by a Qumran fragment (ft -:21) and by LXX (Kara dppat v cy d,y)oWV 0OEo). Saggs's main contention that monotheism must necessarily lead to universalism is not particu- larly well served by Deut. 32: 8-9. Nor is the Assyrian royal inscription by a contemporary of Isaiah of Jerusalem which he cites necessarily an expression of universalism : ' Peoples of the four regions, of foreign tongue and diverse speech, living in mountains and plains, as many as the Light of the gods, the Lord of all, shepherded, at the command of Ashur my lord ... I took captive' (p. 179). The reference to the 'shepherding' of all peoples by 'a member of the Assyrian pantheon', even if some universalist signifi- cance is attached to it, is incidental in a context where everything leads up to the words ' I took captive', and where the weight falls on the subjugation of the world by the Assyrian king 'at the command of Ashur my Lord'. It may be observed that the so-called universalism of Deutero-Isaiah reserves a place of supremacy for Israel and that the aspect of the homage of the nations to Israel is not excluded from it, but the elements of universalism and subjection are there some- what differently proportioned. Saggs sees Israelite society as less tolerant than Mesopotamian and less willing to tolerate the coexistence of incompatible beliefs and traditions. This is the consequence of the differing tempers of polytheism and mono- theism: the one accepts an accretion of incompatibles, while the other operates a more</page><page sequence="7">RIEVIEWS 375 rigorous selectivity. It is doubtful whether Saggs's definition of 'immanence' will be acceptable or his way of distinguishing between 'immanence' and 'omnipresence'. The im- plication of his definition is that where there is an affirmation about the unity of God, an antipathy to plurality of divine manifestations, and a prohibition of images, transcendence is given but immanence is excluded. Saggs has written a book from which much is to be learnt. He achieves lucidity and incisiveness in the exposition of difficult ideas and those who are not specialists in Meso- potamian studies will lean on his expertise. His judgements about the OT are bold, pro- vocative, and sometimes uneven and question- able, but all his work has a freshness and integrity which command respect. WILLIAM MCKANE</page></plain_text>
