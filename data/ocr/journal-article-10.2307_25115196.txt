<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sex Isn't Everything (But It Can be Anything]: The Symbolic Function of Extremity in Modernism Joyce Piell Wexler Joyce Wexler is professor of English at Loyola University Chicago and the author of Who Paid for Modernism? and Laura Riding's Pursuit of Truth. In the era of Sex and the City it is almost impossible to imagine how shocking the sex in modernist fiction used to be. Modernist form may have been difficult, but readers kept returning to Kurtz's "monstrous passions," Molly Blooms monologue, and Lady Chatterley's trysts in the woods. In one critic s judgment, "No aspect of human life changed more in the transition from Victorian England to modern England than the way Englishmen thought about sex" (Hynes 1968, 171). The same might be said about the difference between modern England and todays world.Jaded by increas ingly permissive attitudes, we tend to read sexual scenes as realistic accounts of ordinary behavior. As a result, we lose the symbolic indeterminacy that descriptions of sex pro duced when they were transgressive. The</page><page sequence="2">Joyce Piell Wexler 165 critical response to D. H. Lawrence s fiction illustrates the consequences of this loss. In 1915 The Rainbow seemed so transgressive that it was suppressed, but as explicit sex came to seem less extreme, its symbolic meaning was often limited to ideas Lawrence expressed elsewhere. By daring to write about the unspeakable, however, D. H. Lawrence and other modernists were also rep resenting the unsayable. The conviction that there is more to life than science can explain sur vived the late nineteenth-century demise of faith. As empiricism under mined religious belief, writers looked for other ways to articulate immateri al experience. In 1880 Matthew Arnold proposed that poetry of "truth and seriousness" (1973, 171) could be a substitute for religion: "More and more mankind will discover that we have to turn to poetry to interpret life for us, to console us, to sustain us" (161). Poetry was to be science's new partner: "Without poetry, our science will appear incomplete; and most of what now passes with us for religion and philosophy will be replaced by poetry" (161 62). By the turn of the century, Arthur Symons viewed literature as the opponent rather than the partner of science. The Symbolist movement, he wrote, fought "against exteriority, against rhetoric, against a materialistic tra dition" (1919, 9). In contrast to symbolism in the past, the new movement was "conscious of itself" (3) as it created "a literature in which the visible world is no longer a reality, and the unseen world no longer a dream" (4). Emphasizing the "conscious" construction of symbols, Symons characterized Symbolism as a response to the period's epistemological crisis. Symbolist lit erature assumed the functions of religion: "in speaking to us so intimately, so solemnly, as only religion had hitherto spoken to us, [literature] becomes itself a kind of religion, with all the duties and responsibilities of the sacred ritual" (9). Reading literature as religion became so common that in 1928 T. S. Eliot remarked: "Our literature is a substitute for religion, and so is our reli gion" (1964, 32). Having become an Anglo-Catholic, Eliot wanted to restore the distinct functions of each: "Literature can be no substitute for religion, not merely because we need religion, but because we need literature as well as religion" (36). Speaking from a position of faith, he was unwilling to grant literature the authority of religion or to permit religious texts to be inter preted as freely as literary texts are. As Eliot implies, conflating religion and literature obscures an important difference between them. Although both express immaterial experience by departing from ordinary reality, one through miracles and the other through secular forms of extremity, religious texts attempt to stabilize the meaning of symbols through creed and ritual. Belief limits the symbolic meanings of a religious text the same way that empiricism limits the referentiality of a real ist text. While a symbol can evoke many referents?sexual, aesthetic, politi</page><page sequence="3">166 College Literature 31.2 [Spring 2004] cal?when any one is called a "new religion," the others disappear. The sym bol solidifies into a ritual, becoming a formula for attaining the experience. The literary text assumes, in Symons s words, the "duties and responsibilities of the sacred ritual." When readers allow this to happen, they judge the social impact of the ritual as if it were an act in a realist text.1 Taking the symbol as a path to the non-empirical experience it conveys, critics can argue that modernists made a new religion of sex or art or poli tics.2 This conflation of literature and religion may be intended as praise, but it reduces the indeterminacy of modernist symbols to tendentious formulas. By recovering the extremity of these symbols, however, we can restore their indeterminacy. Indeterminacy makes it possible for symbols to represent the immanence of non-empirical experience in everyday life without grounding it in any fixed belief. At a time when many "new religions" were proposed to challenge science and materialism, the indeterminacy of modernist sym bols expanded readers' sense of interiority without demanding belief. I use the term "non-empirical" to encompass all the discourses that offered sup plements to empiricism. "Spiritual" would be too mystical, "ideal" too meta physical, "beautiful" too aesthetic, "ideological" too political, "uncanny" too fantastic, "unconscious" too psychological. Modernist symbols were indeterminate and non-empirical as a result of the linguistic structure of the symbol and the rhetorical effect of extremity. Although every symbol begins with empirical referents, Roman Jakobson s structural definition of symbolism accounts for its capacity to generate non empirical meanings as well. Jakobson locates syntax on a horizontal axis of combination and semantics on a vertical axis of selection (Jakobson and Halle 1956, 60). He proposes literary parallels to each axis. The principle of conti guity in syntax corresponds to metonymy as used in realism (78). Realism is m?tonymie because the text refers to a particular time and place; meaning depends on contiguity between word and thing. The principle of substitu tion in semantics corresponds to metaphor as used in symbolism (77-78). Symbolism is metaphoric because the text generates multiple possibilities in each structural position. These possibilities extend from empirical to non empirical referents.3 In The History of Sexuality Michel Foucault provides an explanation for the indeterminacy of extreme symbols. Although the aim of his argument is to show how repression of sexual discourse serves "the regime of power knowledge-pleasure that sustains the discourse on human sexuality in our part of the world" (1978,11), his "repressive hypothesis" also accounts for the shock value of sexual discourse.4 According to this hypothesis, psychological and social repression of sexual discourse gives it transgressive power: "If sex is repressed, that is, condemned to prohibition, nonexistence, and silence,</page><page sequence="4">Joyce Piell Wexler 167 then the mere fact that one is speaking about it has the appearance of a delib erate transgression" (6). Releasing what is repressed produces the pleasure of transgression: What sustains our eagerness to speak of sex in terms of repression is doubt less this opportunity to speak out against the powers that be, to utter truths and promise bliss, to link together enlightenment, liberation, and manifold pleasures; to pronounce a discourse that combines the fervor of knowledge, the determination to change the laws, and the longing for the garden of earthly delights. (Foucault 1978, 7) Foucault does not limit the effects of transgressive sexual discourse to sexu ality. Extremity pushes the reader beyond the empirical referent: "Something that smacks of revolt, of promised freedom, of the coming age of a different law, slips easily into this discourse on sexual oppression. Some of the ancient functions of prophecy are reactivated therein" (7). From politics to religion, Foucault indicates the range of meanings transgression can evoke.5 When the extreme becomes the norm, however, this proliferation of non-empirical meanings stops. The indeterminacy of extremity was theorized long before Foucault in psychoanalysis and Expressionism. In The Interpretation of Dreams, first pub lished in German in 1900, Freud makes indeterminacy fundamental to his method of analyzing discourse for unconscious meaning. Focusing on dream narratives, he distinguishes the flexibility of psychoanalytic interpretation from two popular traditions of dream analysis. One is the symbolic method illustrated in the Bible when Joseph analyzes Pharaoh s dream through a point-by-point allegory that preserves its unity. Freud also rejects the method of systematic decoding that analyzes parts of a dream separately but applies a fixed key of meanings (1900, 97). Instead, Freud encourages patients to asso ciate freely to any element of the dream. He welcomes multiple associations, even if they are contradictory, because dreams "regularly have more than one meaning" (149). Freud turns from the question of how to analyze discourse to the prob lem of how to decide what is worth analyzing in a 1909 paper, "Notes Upon a Case of Obsessional Neurosis," the Rat Man case. The extremity of the patient's fantasy, both in its content and recitation, signals a node of uncon scious ideas. Freud dramatizes the patient's hesitant account of his signature fantasy: "... the criminal was tied up..."?he expressed himself so indistinctly that I could not immediately guess in what position?". . . a pot was turned upside down on his buttocks. . . some rats were put into it. . . and they. . ." ?he had again got up, and was showing every sign of horror and resist</page><page sequence="5">168 College Literature 31.2 [Spring 2004] anee?". . . bored their way in. . ."?Into his anus, I helped him out. (Freud 1909, 166) The patient can barely utter the words, so unspeakable is the torture. In the course of analyzing the patient s multiple associations to the fantasy, Freud explains that one of the signs of the unconscious is a disparity between an emotional response and its apparent stimulus: I took the opportunity of giving [the patient] a first glance at the underly ing principles of psycho-analytic therapy. When there is a m?salliance, I began, between an affect and its ideational content (in this instance, between the intensity of the self-reproach and the occasion for it), a layman will say that the affect is too great for the occasion?that it is exaggerated. ... On the contrary, the [analytic] physician says:'No. The affect is justified. The sense of guilt is not in itself open to further criticism. But it belongs to some other content, which is unknown (unconscious), and which requires to be looked for." (Freud 1909,175-76) Freud takes the patients exaggerated reaction as a reliable indication of unconscious turmoil.The "m?salliance," that is, the disparity between an ordi nary situation and excessive or extreme behavior, alerts the analyst to the presence of latent meanings. Freuds interest in extremity as a sign of multiple unconscious meanings had a contemporary aesthetic parallel in Expressionists' use of shocking imagery to represent intense subjective feelings. Albert Ehrenstein s poem "Dunkel" ["Dark"], which is cited in Walter Sokol's classic study of Expressionist literature, The Writer in Extremis, even contains the same fanta sy as the Rat Man case. The speaker cries out, "Ratten! Fresset meine Eingeweide!": Rats! Eat up my bowels! Break me, rock, and river drown me! Why did I not die before my birth? Never for me will shine the land of joy. (Sokol 1959, 84)6 Although the symbol is rooted in the speaker's psychological state, its extremity keeps it indeterminate. It conveys the intensity of the speakers feeling but does not specify the cause of his anguish.7 The figurative mean ings of the title extend from the speaker's mood to his inability to account for it. Defining "Expressionism proper" as "subjective, dreamlike, visionary rather than object-centered, intellectual, and linguistically experimental" (1959, 30),8 Sokol distinguishes Expressionist symbols from other types of symbolism. Unlike Goethe's mimetic symbols, Expressionist symbols are sub jective and indeterminate:</page><page sequence="6">Joyce Piell Wexler 169 Dream images are not symbols in Goethe's sense, since they do not repre sent general or public truths, but they are extended metaphors uprooted from their context. They are hieroglyphic signs, a pictorial script, which expresses, without revealing, the essence of a hidden situation. In fact, the dream image disguises as much as it expresses, and its expressive function is identical with its veiling function. (Sokol 1959, 47) Dream images and hieroglyphs with hidden meanings recall Freud's metaphor of the rebus, a picture puzzle that is interpreted by substituting a referent unrelated to the meaning of the whole for each of its parts (1900, 278). Sokol further differentiates Expressionist and Realist symbols: The great Realists of the nineteenth century, above all Flaubert and Ibsen, took a decisive step toward absolute art by making individual events, objects, or persons in their works symbolic not of universal forces or ideas, but of the aesthetic idea of the work itself. Although it still retains its self evident "realistic" existence as an independent individual event or object or person, the symbol also becomes a function in the work. (Sokol 1959, 31) Modernist symbols, however, retain the empirical object of Realism to over come the subjectivity of Expressionism. The modernist synthesis not only represents more than an individual subjective state, but it uses objective real ity to symbolize aesthetic ideas. From Flaubert and Ibsen, modernists learned to preserve the empirical "event or object or person," and from Expressionists they learned to evoke non-empirical meanings through extreme instances of empirical reality. Extremity also gestures beyond material reality by violating formal con ventions. The Expressionist painter Wassily Kandinsky articulated the aes thetic principle that unrealistic forms represent non-empirical reality. In Concerning the Spiritual in Art (1912), Kandinsky explains that he uses abstract form to symbolize what cannot be seen. He admits that the meaning of this strategy is elusive: "No such theory of principle can be laid down for those things which lie beyond, in the realm of the immaterial" (1977,12). Although he gropes for language to express his ineffable objective, he has no difficulty describing its antithesis: "Our minds, which are even now only just awaken ing after years of materialism, are infected with the despair of unbelief, of lack of purpose and ideal.The nightmare of materialism, which has turned the life of the universe into an evil, useless game, is not yet past; it holds the awak ening soul still in its grip" (1-2). To end the "nightmare of materialism," Expressionism represents the desire to transcend our immediate circum stances, a desire Kandinsky calls the "inner need" (26).To express "the 'inner' by way of the 'outer'" (17), artists distort empirical reality. They violate the conventions of realism to signify "inner" meaning: "The more obvious is the separation from nature, the more likely is the inner meaning to be pure and</page><page sequence="7">170 College Literature 31.2 [Spring 2004] unhampered" (50). Modernists absorbed the principle that departing from realism was a way to convey non-empirical experience, but they also react ed against the vagueness of Expressionism. Using extreme empirical acts to symbolize multiple, indeterminate meanings, they situated inner meaning in the outer world. Like other modernists, D. H. Lawrence chafed at the limits of empirical realism. Despite his early success with Sons and Lovers, he abandoned the real ism of its "hard, violent style full of sensation and presentation" (1981,132). He told his editor that the "first half of the Sisters," which became The Rainbow, was "written in another language almost" (132). Symbolic scenes written in this language begin with an empirical description of characters and setting, but sensory details fade as the narrative introduces repetition, contradiction, alliteration, abstract terms, bald assertions, and rhythmic phras ing. Keen empirical observations are interwoven with evocations of charac ters' conscious and unconscious feelings. Ordinary events are heightened by a psychodrama whose intensity is out of proportion to the actual situation. Like Freud's "m?salliance" the incongruity is a cue that such passages are to be interpreted symbolically. These scenes symbolize the capacity for non empirical experience without specifying what constitutes such experience. Writing at a time when sexual discourse was vigorously censored, Lawrence benefited from the symbolic indeterminacy that Foucault's "repressive hypothesis" predicts. Although Lawrence connects the erotic to a multitude of emotional or spiritual states, readers tend to choose one and regard it as his message. Even critics who recognize Lawrence s symbolic intention often thwart it by interpreting his symbols as expressions of a par ticular belief rather than a general capacity for belief. Thus indeterminate symbols acquire the stability of religious symbols. Reading sexual passages as symbols of a new religion, critics interpret them as a call for more sex and better sex to attain personal fulfillment. Lawrence's use of religious imagery and his obvious desire to change readers' lives have allowed critics to cast him as a prophet of sex. He certain ly believed that his writing had an evangelical purpose: "I think, do you know, I have inside me a sort of answer to the want of today: to the real, deep want of the English people, not to just what they fancy they want" (1979, 511). Much of this "want" was sexual: "And I am so sure that only through a readjustment between men and women, and a making free and healthy of the sex, will [England] get out of her present atrophy" (544). Such statements strengthen the critical tendency to conflate Lawrence's representation of non-empirical experience with religion. Peter Fjagesund voices the widespread view that Lawrence replaced God with sex: "A religious quest which has abolished all transcendent objects of</page><page sequence="8">Joyce Piell Wexler 171 worship has to find a substitute, and in Lawrence sex has largely usurped the position previously held by God" (1991, 81). Fjagesund explains, "Whenever Lawrence makes an attempt to describe the sexual act, he has recourse to a religious vocabulary connected with the salvation of man and the world, an apocalyptic-millennial imagery of a new heaven and a new earth" (83). Fjagesund points out that Lawrence's "view of the sexual act as a source of salvation and renewal is probably acknowledged to be the most conspicuous, and the most controversial, feature of his entire work" (79). These statements illustrate the consequences of interpreting Lawrence's symbolism as a new kind of religious writing. Believing that Lawrence makes sex a path to salva tion, Fjagesund regards Lawrence's symbols as a formula for attaining what is symbolized. Like religious rituals that lead to God, sex in Lawrence's novels is taken as a path to "salvation and renewal." Nor is Fjagesund an isolated example. Paul Poplawski also reduces the symbol to religious ritual: The central experience for the characters in The Rainbow, moreover, and the experience that pre-eminently leads them to realize their true selfhood and their potential for creative development, is the sexual experience. And sex in this novel is typically presented as an intense form of religious expe rience, invested with religious significance by the fictional context (often an actual church), or by the language and imagery in which it is couched. (Poplawski 1993, 36) Although Poplawski documents the wealth of meanings sex symbolizes, including the realization of selfhood and creative potential, he invests sex with the efficacy of ritual, as if it were a way to attain this realization. Paul Delany s version of the argument that Lawrence regards sex as a new religion recognizes that the meaning of sex is unstable, but Delany accounts for multiple meanings by positing an antinomian religion: "In the antinomian system, the same act may be sinful or blameless; it all depends on whether the person acting is in a state of grace" (1996, 81). He dismisses Lawrence's statement, "I hate sex, it is such a limitation," as an "obsession with distinguishing between good sex and bad sex?that is, between the sacred and the profane. Joyce, on the other hand, wants the sacred and pro fane to merge, in bed, chamber pot, or individual pair of trousers" (81). I would formulate Delany s point differently: whether sex is sacred or profane depends not on being blessed or damned, but rather on the meaning the act acquires in a particular context. In The Rainbow Anna Brangwen illustrates the variable meaning of sex. It is not a question of good sex or bad sex?she always seems to have good sex?but the physical gratification is "sacred" in some scenes and "profane" in others. Neither Joyce nor Lawrence effaces the distinction between the sacred and the profane; both detach these value judg</page><page sequence="9">172 College Literature 31.2 [Spring 2004] ments from their conventional associations to use them for their own sym bolic purposes. Lawrence's religious rhetoric conveys the value of non-empirical expe rience, but not its source or content.9 Lawrence does not proselytize for sex as a good in itself, a natural function, or a path to enlightenment. In his fic tion (if not in his essays) sex is like a cipher. Sometimes sex expresses inti macy, but at other times it expresses antagonism, self-assertion, self-oblitera tion, or power over the other. Emphasizing the symbolic duality of Lawrence's use of sex, Janet Barron qualifies Mark Kinkead-Weekes's com ment, "Sex is a way of talking about something else," by noting that "when Lawrence discusses sex, sex is often what he is talking about, however much endowed with mystical significance" (1990, 13).10 As a symbol, sex has empirical and non-empirical meanings. Thus in The Rainbow sex symbolizes a holy "transfiguration" of Lydia and Tom (Lawrence 1989, 91), but also a "sensuality violent and extreme as death" for Anna and Will later in their marriage (220), a bond of "dark corruption" between Winifred Inger and Ursula's uncle Tom (322), and "a developing germ of death" for Ursula and Anton (429). If sex can symbolize transcendence or degradation, it cannot be a path to either. Anna and Will's evolving relationship demonstrates the range of emo tional and spiritual states that sex can symbolize. When they are first married, their lovemaking is barely described in sexual terms: As they lay close together, complete and beyond the touch of time or change, it was as if they were at the very centre of all the slow wheeling of space and the rapid agitation of life, deep, deep inside them all, at the cen tre where there is utter radiance, and eternal being, and the silence absorbed in praise: the steady core of all movements, the unawakened sleep of all wakefulness.They found themselves there, and they lay still, in each other's arms; for their moment they were at the heart of eternity, whilst time roared far off, forever far off, towards the rim. Then gradually they were passed away from the supreme centre, down the circles of praise and joy and gladness, further and further out, towards the noise and the friction. But their hearts had burned and were tempered by the inner reality, they were unalterably glad. (Lawrence 1989, 135) In this passage sex symbolizes the spiritual expansion their love brings them. It carries them "beyond" empirical limits of time and change, to a place of "utter radiance, and eternal being, and the silence absorbed in praise." Not sex but this state is sacred, a place of "praise and joy and gladness." In contrast, after Will's adventure with Jennie, the girl he meets in a music hall, sex expresses hostility between Anna and Will. Anna guesses that he has been on the prowl, and she responds in kind: "He was the sensual male</page><page sequence="10">Joyce Piell Wexler 173 seeking his pleasure, she was the female ready to take hers: but in her own way. A man could turn into a free lance: so then could a woman. She adhered as little as he to the moral world. . . . They abandoned in one motion the moral position, each was seeking gratification pure and simple" (Lawrence 1989, 218). The narrator explains what their lovemaking symbolizes now: "This was what their love had become, a sensuality violent and extreme as death. They had no conscious intimacy, no tenderness of love. It was all the lust and the infinite, maddening intoxication of the senses, a passion of death" (220). Thus sex symbolizes joy and gladness as well as "a passion of death." Sex in itself means neither. Veering from tenderness to rage, Anna and Will overreact to common place situations.The disparity between their feelings and their situation illus trates the kind of m?salliance Freud regards as a symbolic site of unconscious meanings. In church, for example, they argue about a stained glass window that depicts a yellow lamb holding a flag. The fight not only makes the ques tion of symbolic interpretation explicit, but it also shows how a conversation about art can express innumerable latent meanings. Will savors the symbol ism and mystery of religious imagery: "In church, he wanted a dark, name less emotion, the emotion of all the great mysteries of passion" (Lawrence 1989, 147). Will's "real being lay in his dark emotional experience of the Infinite, of the Absolute" (147). Will's experience is dissociated from belief in God, yet the religious setting indicates that it is non-empirical. Lawrence prevents the reader from regarding this state as a transcendent substitute for religion by comparing Will in his pursuit of mystery to a burrowing animal and to Hades. Will's soul is like "some strange, underground thing, abstract" (148). There is "something subterranean about him, as if he had an under world refuge" (149).These images suggest that non-empirical experience is not necessarily positive. Anna is equally capable of mystical experience, but she resists it. Will's pleasure in finding symbolic meaning in ordinary things enrages her: "In a way, she envied it him, this dark freedom and jubilation of the soul, some strange entity in him. It fascinated her. Again she hated it. And again, she despised him, wanted to destroy it in him" (Lawrence 1989,148). Anna insists on the physical reality of objects, refusing to treat them as symbols. Admiring the church window, she fights Will's way of interpreting it: Suddenly it gleamed to her dominant, this lamb with the flag. Suddenly she had a powerful mystic experience, the power of the tradition seized on her, she was transported to another world. And she hated it, resisted it. Instantly, it was only a silly lamb in the glass again. And dark, violent hatred of her husband swept up in her. (Lawrence 1989, 148-49)</page><page sequence="11">174 College Literature 31.2 [Spring 2004] If Will is too abstract, Anna is too literal. She separates the ordinary object from all symbolic meanings. Laughing at the Lamb as the symbol of Christ, she insists that things should not be treated as symbols: "'Whatever it means, it's a lamb,' she said. 'And I like lambs too much to treat them as if they had to mean something'" (150). Will counters her mockery with insults: "It's because you don't know anything," he said violently, harshly "Laugh at what you know, not at what you don't know." "What don't I know?" "What things mean." (Lawrence 1989, 150) Although Anna wins the fight, she loses something more valuable: "She had broken a little of something in him. And at length he was glad to forfeit from his soul all his symbols, to have her making love to him" (Lawrence 1989, 151). When Anna deprives Will of his "mystic" dimension, the mean ing of his lovemaking changes: "He came to her fierce and hard, like a hawk striking and taking her. He was no mystic any more, she was his aim and object, his prey. And she was carried off, and he was satisfied, or satiated at last" (151). Here the physical satiation of sex expresses not love but aggres sion. Instead of endorsing either Anna's or Will's view of the lamb, the nar rator comments, "They were very well matched. They would fight it out" (152). Dramatizing the deficiencies of symbolism and realism in the couple's quarrel, the novel works toward a synthesis of the two. Lawrence calls on religious, aesthetic, and sexual symbols to develop this synthesis. Visiting Lincoln Cathedral, Anna and Will both feel a spiritual expansion. Will's non-empirical experience is expressed in terms of a sexual consummation: "His soul leapt up into the gloom, into possession, it reeled, it swooned with a great escape, it quivered in the womb, in the hush and the gloom of fecundity, like seed of procreation in ecstasy" (Lawrence 1989,187). Although Anna "too was overcome with wonder and awe," she resents the cathedral's claim to be complete and eternal: "she remembered that the open sky was no blue vault, no dark dome hung with many twinkling lamps, but a space where stars were wheeling in freedom, with freedom above them always higher" (187-88). Her response affirms a world beyond art and a sense of the infinite apart from religion: "But even in the dazed swoon of the cathedral, she claimed another right. The altar was barren, its lights gone out. God burned no more in that bush. It was dead matter lying there. She claimed the right to freedom above her, higher than the roof. She had always a sense of being roofed in" (188-89). Unable to believe in God, she still experiences something limitless. Will, the more mystical of the two, also dis tinguishes his response from religious faith: "Still he loved the church. As a symbol, he loved it. He tended it for what it tried to represent, rather than</page><page sequence="12">Joyce Piell Wexler 175 for that which it did represent" (191). Despite their different ways of reading symbols, both Anna and Will express the secular Zeitgeist of modernism, the conviction that the essence of life can neither be separated from its physical manifestation nor reduced to sensory knowledge. In the next generation, different ways of reading symbols become differ ent ways of living. Anna and Will's daughter Ursula careens from spirituality to sensation until she finds a way to combine them. She has her family's capacity for non-empirical experience as well as a modern desire for sensa tion. Like her parents, she freely invokes religious symbols to express secular beliefs. In the absence of faith, the words of Genesis still affect her: "Yet the words continued to have a meaning that was untouched either by the knowl edge of gateways or hyperboles. The historical, or local, or psychological interest in the words was another thing. There remained unaltered the inex plicable value of the saying" (Lawrence 1989, 258). Belief in God is impossi ble, but she responds to "the non-literal application of the scriptures" (258). Religious discourse is valuable because it has "at least this rhythm of eterni ty in a ragged, inconsequential life" (261).Yet it must be superceded because "it was becoming a mechanical action now," having lost "the hope and the fulfillment," the "passion of the human heart" (261). Ursula's spiritual capacity shrinks as she grows up. As a young woman, she expects education to expand her world: "There was always a magic in [books]" (Lawrence 1989, 251). But she learns that school instills obedience to authority rather than wonder. She equates maturity with the need to renounce transcendent aspirations and accept everyday life: "And the girl had come to the point where she held that that which one cannot experience in daily life is not true for oneself" (263). She becomes an empiricist, studying botany and teaching school. She "denied the vision," which "had spoken far off words that ran along the blood like ripples of an unseen wind" (264). Although becoming a teacher allows her a degree of independence, it also separates her from her family's spiritual reserves. Disappointed by religion and education, Ursula attempts to expand her consciousness through sex. Unable to sustain her belief in immaterial reality, she reduces her longing to carnal desire: "This was a shame to her. The con fusing of the spirit world with the material world, in her own soul, degrad ed her. She answered the call of the spirit in terms of immediate, everyday desire" (Lawrence 1989, 267).The narrative explicitly discredits the idea that sex could be a new religion in its comment on her behavior: "It was a betray al, a transference of meaning, from the vision world, to the matter-of-fact world" (266). It is futile to seek the infinite in a finite sexual act. Seeking the right man, Ursula finds the right way to live. Lawrence adapts the conventional courtship plot of realistic fiction to symbolize her</page><page sequence="13">176 College Literature 31.2 [Spring 2004] inner development. Each man that she considers as a lover represents anoth er kind of consciousness. She initially pursues Anton Skrebensky because he is "unknown," but he proves to be all too knowable: But under it all, was a poignant sense of transience. It was a magnificent self-assertion on the part of both of them. . . . And after all, what could either of them get from such a passion but a sense of his or of her own maximum self, in contradistinction to all the rest of life? Wherein was something finite and sad, for the human soul at its maximum wants a sense of the infinite. (Lawrence 1989, 281) Like other abstract terms in the novel, "a sense of the infinite" evokes what is missing without saying exactly what could supply it. Disappointed by Anton, Ursula flirts with her friend Maggie's brother Anthony, a homegrown foil to Anton. Anthony is a farmer still untouched by the alienation of modern life. Ursula is inflamed "with sensation of him," but she dismisses him because he "had no soul" (Lawrence 1989, 386). He is too unconscious, too close to nature: "All this so beautiful, all this so lovely! He did not see it. He was one with it. But she saw it, and was one with it" (386). While Anton and Anthony occupy opposite poles of consciousness, Ursula sees and feels. She learns that sexual passion is neither a means to the infinite nor a substitute for the infinite. It can at best be a symbol of the infinite. Although the novel ends before Ursula finds the ideal mate, she does reach an understanding of the kind of life she wants. She expresses it nega tively as dissatisfaction with what she knows and positively as desire for the unknown: [Anton's] body was beautiful, his movements intent and quick, she admired him and she appreciated him without reserve. He seemed completed now. He roused no fruitful fecundity in her. He seemed added up, finished. She knew him all round, not on any side did he lead into the unknown. Poignant, almost passionate appreciation she felt for him, but none of the dreadful wonder, none of the rich fear, the connection with the unknown, or the reverence of love. (Lawrence 1989, 438-39) Since Anton no longer expands her sense of life, she rejects his marriage pro posal and returns to her parents' home. Anton departs for India. Then empirical reality impinges on Ursula's inner being: she discovers that she is pregnant. Her initial response is to resign herself to marriage. She writes to Anton, telling him about their child and offering to join him in India. Although she capitulates to conventional morality, she is still restive. Burdened by her decision and her pregnancy, she goes for a walk in a rain storm. Suddenly she feels the presence of horses behind her on the path: "She knew without looking that the horses were moving nearer. What were they? She felt the thud of their heavy hoofs on the ground. What was it that was</page><page sequence="14">Joyce Piell Wexler 177 drawing near her, what weight oppressing her heart? She did not know, she did not look" (Lawrence 1989, 451). Externalizing the "weight oppressing her heart," the horses are felt but not seen. They chase Ursula and block her path. Trapped, she realizes that she "must beat her way back through all this fluctuation, back to stability and security" (451). She runs toward the horses: "In a sort of lightning of knowledge their movement travelled through her, the quiver and strain and thrust of their powerful flanks, as they burst before her and drew on, beyond" (452). Combining the possible and the impossi ble, the passage uses the visual and kinetic description of horses to show that Ursula is pulled "beyond" her prior life. As "their movement travelled through her," she absorbs their strength: She knew they had not gone, she knew they awaited her still. But she went on over the log bridge that their hoofs had churned and drummed, she went on, knowing things about them. She was aware of their breasts gripped, clenched narrow in a hold that never relaxed, she was aware of their red nostrils flaming with long endurance, and of their haunches, so rounded, so massive, pressing, pressing, pressing to burst the grip upon their breasts, pressing forever till they went mad, running against the walls of time, and never bursting free. Their great haunches were smoothed and darkened with rain. But the darkness and wetness of rain could not put out the hard, urgent, massive fire that was locked within these flanks, never, never. (Lawrence 1989, 452) This passage mingles sensory details (the log bridge, red nostrils, rounded haunches darkened with rain) and projections of anthropomorphic feeling (breasts gripped, clenched, never relaxed; nostrils flaming with long endurance; going mad; burning with a hard, urgent, massive fire). Images of power held in check, ready to burst free, magnify the threat. The repetition of "pressing, pressing, pressing" and "never, never" conveys the intensity of her feelings. Ursula pushes on and finds a way to escape: "Her body was weak but her hands were as hard as steel. She knew she was strong" (Lawrence 1989, 453). Resisting the attack, she finds a constant self that can withstand the impact of external events: "As she sat there, spent, time and the flux of change passed away from her, she lay as if unconscious upon the bed of the stream, like a stone, unconscious, unchanging, unchangeable, whilst everything rolled by in transience, leaving her there, a stone at rest on the bed of the stream, inalter able and passive, sunk to the bottom of all change" (454). The scene describes the visible setting in terms that also apply to Ursula's feelings. The physical characteristics of the horses, especially their strength and deliberate pursuit, suggest Ursula's feelings; the physical danger symbolizes a threat to her psy chological independence. Being charged by horses is unlikely but possible.</page><page sequence="15">178 College Literature 31.2 [Spring 2004] The extremity of the scene symbolizes Ursula's fears as well as her ability to overcome them. The symbolic meanings of the horses are assimilated to the realistic level of the novel as an illness. Ursula is feverish and delirious, but the outcome of the visionary experience is not lost: "Under all her illness persisted a deep, inalterable knowledge" (Lawrence 1989,455). Escaping from the horses gives her the strength to escape the "compression which enclosed her" as the hors es surrounded her: "The compression was Anton and Anton's world" (456). She now feels that Anton has no reality in himself: she "had created him for the time being"; he "was something of the past, finite. He was that which is known" (457). Analyzing her vision, she finds a way to expand her essential being by breaking away from social convention: "'I must break out of it, like a nut from its shell which is an unreality'" (456).The narrator explicates the simile: "She was the naked, clear kernel thrusting forth the clear, powerful shoot, and the world was a bygone winter, discarded..." (456). As a result of this ordeal, she reaches a new sense of herself, a new consciousness. She resolves to consider the child "her own affair" (455). She will not marry Anton after all. The unwed mother, seduced and abandoned, is a staple of realistic nov els, but Lawrence overturns this convention. The narrative function of his symbolism is to explain how a pregnant woman might choose not to marry the father of her child. The extremity of this scene locates Ursula's shocking decision in indeterminate non-empirical experience. No higher power, no systematic belief supports her decision; it is the result of an emotional trans formation symbolized in her escape from the horses. Her inner victory is val idated at the realistic level of the narrative as well. The pregnancy ends in a miscarriage, and Anton cables that he has married someone else. While critics agree that the scene is symbolic, the diversity of interpre tations reflects the indeterminacy of extreme symbols. As Cornelia Nixon points out, "Nearly everyone who has written on The Rainbow has tried to lay a finger on the full meaning of the horses, and the variety of the results testifies to the irreducibility of the symbol" (1986, 88). The horses have been glossed as Ursula's sensuality, as male potency, and as her own nascent self. Nixon adds that the horses are associated "with the exclusively female mys teries of pregnancy, labor, and birth" (93). After the miscarriage, Ursula feels that she gives birth to a new self?a "psychological rebirth" (96). Thus the horses "embody the savage, irrational divinity that Ursula must recognize in her own being before she can 'come forth' as 'that which she was, positively. . .'" (98). An extreme symbol can accommodate all these possibilities, but Nixon ultimately treats the horses as a religious symbol:</page><page sequence="16">Joyce Piell Wexler 179 Lawrence's pantheistic God is primarily characterized as the source of life, and the representation of this divinity appropriately incorporates powerful animals and the idea of birth, since these are among the most spectacular manifestations of the life force. Metaphoric leopards and tigers abound in The Rainbow as representatives of a deity denied by rational humanity, though charging horses are the best Lawrence could muster, realistically, in the English countryside; and birth, both as metaphor and event, is closely associated in this novel with ontological revelation. (Nixon 1986, 98) Grounding the symbolism of the horses in a pantheistic God, Nixon unnec essarily limits the meaning of the scene. Lawrence uses the extremity of sex to escape limits. At the end of the novel, Ursula wants "the unknown, the unexplored, the undiscovered upon whose shore she had landed, alone, after crossing the void, the darkness which washed the New World and the Old" (1989, 457). This refusal to accept limits is not based on any idea of what is beyond those limits. Ursula only knows that she wants more. Expressing this longing as a search for the ideal mate, she rhapsodizes: "It was not for her to create, but to recognise a man created by God. The man should come from the Infinite and she should hail him" (457).The "Infinite" is as far as she can get from what she already knows. She symbolizes it with the biblical image of the "rainbow forming itself" (458), but the term does not have religious meaning associated with a supernatural or divine being. "Infinite" simply means without limit. Elsewhere Lawrence uses terms such as "mystery," "unknown," "beyond," and "unabateable" to convey a vast capacity for inner experience without speci fying its content. Like the biblical rainbow, Ursula's rainbow is a promise of new life. It is an alternative to what she knows, but what it will be remains open. If Kurtz makes us feel the "horror" of unlimited desire, Ursula makes us feel its wonder. Lawrence may not specify the content of non-empirical experience, but he clearly indicates what it is not: it is not subjective, not transcendent, not based on a particular belief. As Foucault argues, repression raises the voltage of sexual discourse, making it available for many purposes. The duality of sex ual discourse as a transgression of cultural taboos and as a description of physical acts conveys the immanence of non-empirical experience in ordi nary life. By recovering the function if not the shock of extremity, we can rouse ourselves from the nightmare of materialism as well as the daydream of idealism. Notes 1 I discuss the consequences of reading modernist texts as realism in Wexler (1999, 60-73). A recent example of the bias toward realism is Andrew Harrison's use of the paradigm of "writing the body" in his reading of The Rainbow. Harrison con</page><page sequence="17">180 College Literature 311 [Spring 2004] eludes that "the futuristic style which appeared in the final draft of The Rainbow expresses an extraordinary and raw awareness of body and self in Ursula Brangwen," though his next sentence acknowledges that "the willingness or desire to move with the style to something beyond it separates those who return time and again to The Rainbow from the novel's detractors" (2001, 53). 2 For example, M. H. Abrams's classic study Natural Supernaturalism cites James Joyce's epiphanies as a "systematic translation of religious formulas into a compre hensive aesthetic theory, in which the artist, or artificer, undertakes to redeem both life and the world by recreating them into a new world. Joyce's new world, howev er, is radically opposed to Wordsworth's, for it is no other than the work of art itself" (1971, 422). And in Modernism and Mass Politics Michael Tratner argues that mod ernists on the left and the right sought collectivism rather than individualism, accept ing Gustave Le Bon's claim "that all crowds, even those forming socialist movements, are essentially religious, with a deep need for gods and priests" (Tratner 1995,33).To understand the "the relationship of modernism, politics, and the unknowable," we must recognize that "in the early twentieth century, the trope of speaking about and appealing to what is beyond consciousness was a commonplace of political debates and functioned to promote diverse ends" (11). 3 David Lodge extends Jakobsons remarks in a detailed comparison of realism and symbolism (1971). In a study of D. H. Lawrence's aesthetics, Anne Fernihough develops Lodge's argument by offering poststructuralist definitions of symbolism and realism based on reading strategies rather than textual features. A realistic reading focuses on the relationship between the text and a particular set of referents outside the text, between the story and the specific time and place the story describes. A symbolic reading multiplies referents beyond those of a specific time and place (1993, 49). 4 Foucault cites a passage from The Plumed Serpent, one of D. H. Lawrence's most extreme novels, to illustrate the centrality of sex as a node of meaning in Western culture and comments: "So we must not refer a history of sexuality to the agency of sex; but rather show how 'sex' is historically subordinate to sexuality We must not place sex on the side of reality, and sexuality on that of confused ideas and illusions; sexuality is a very real historical formation; it is what gave rise to the notion of sex, as a speculative element necessary to its operation" (1978, 157). Lydia Blanchard believes that both Foucault and Lawrence understood that talking about sex did not make it more understandable: "By bringing sexuality into the clear light of language, Foucault argues, we have succeeded only in controlling and thus repressing it," and Foucault points out that "our sexuality is trapped by the language meant to free it" (Blanchard 1985, 18). But Blanchard also notes that freeing sexuality is not Lawrence's only aim: "Lawrence was certainly interested in the full conscious real ization of sex, but that interest was, for him as for Foucault, part of a broader con cern with what it means to bring sexuality into discourse, part of a broader interest in the relation between language, sexuality, power, and knowledge" (21). 5 When Foucault describes the effects of power on the subject, he uses "soul" to designate the "non-corporal":</page><page sequence="18">Joyce Piell Wexler 181 This real, non-corporal soul is not a substance; it is the element in which are artic ulated the effects of a certain type of power and the reference of a certain type of knowledge, the machinery by which the power relations give rise to a possible cor pus of knowledge, and knowledge extends and reinforces the effects of this power. On this reality-reference, various concepts have been constructed and domains of analysis carved out: psyche, subjectivity, personality, consciousness, etc.; on it have been built scientific techniques and discourses, and the moral claims of humanism. (Foucault 1977, 29-30) The religious connotations of "soul" link religious institutions to his other examples. 6 Sokol's translation. "Dunkel" appears in Ehrenstein (1920, 148). 7 In contrast to my reading, Sokol finds a specific meaning in the poem, inter preting it as an example of Expressionist poets' "deep conviction of unworthiness" (1959, 83). He claims that Ehrenstein turns "in hate against the world, and especial ly against the women who torment him" (84). 8 Sokol dates the Expressionist period from the turn of the century to the 1930s but divides it into two segments: "The crest of the Expressionist wave is always asso ciated with the German revolutions of 1918 and 1919, and Expressionism was the target of Hitler's attacks upon 'degenerate art' and 'cultural bolshevism'" (1959, 2). The second part of the movement coincides with high modernism, and Sokol includes writers such as Franz Kafka, Thomas Mann,T. S. Eliot, and James Joyce who are usually considered modernists in the Expressionist canon. 9 In D. H. Lawrence and The Bible,T. R.Wright examines the pervasive influence of the Bible on Lawrence's writing. Wright argues that The Rainbow is "a kind of counter-Bible, designed to loosen up interpretation of the Bible, to develop Christianity beyond its unnecessarily rigid dogma and morality. ... In Derrida's words, he 'supplements' the Bible, not simply adding to it but at times attempting to supplant it, to replace the traditional text with his own" (2000, 85). 10 Barron rightly points out that Lawrence's "aesthetic achievements are always far more subtle than his polemic" (1990, 20).
