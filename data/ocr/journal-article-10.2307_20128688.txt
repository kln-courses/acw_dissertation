<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS* AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 25, No. 1, January 1988 Global Moral Commitment, ALAN H. GOLDMAN The question addressed is whether and how a philosopher who views moral truth in terms of coherence between a judgment and other settled moral convictions and principles can justify commitment to an entire system of such judgments and principles. If moral realism were correct, then the question would not arise. Several arguments against realism in this domain are therefore presented. Next, the Wittgensteinian sugges tion that global, as opposed to local, justification is in principle impossible is considered and rejected. Entire moral systems can be assessed both in terms of internal coherence over time and in practice, and in terms of coherence with other norms properly seen as evaluative, but less relativis tically so than purely moral norms. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 25, No. 2, April 1988 Volition and Action, DOUGLAS ODEGARD Actions can be divided into primitive and nonprimitive and the latter can be explained volitionally. Nonprimitive actions are actions which have constituents. Speaking roughly, a nonprimitive action consists partly in willing an event to occur and partly in the event's occurring as a result. The existence of suitable volitions can be defended against famil iar objections in Ryle and Taylor. The volitional account of nonprimitive action can be sustained in the face of potential difficulties raised by Da vidson, Thomson, Hornsby, Brand, and others. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of the Review.

Copyright ? 1988 by the Review of Metaphysics</page><page sequence="2">862 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Morality, Potential Persons and Abortion, JOHN BIGELOW and ROBERT PARGETTER Abortion is such a confusing issue because it raises three distinct concerns: a concern that we should not harm anyone unnecessarily; the problematic status of a being which has the potential to become a person, but which is very different from a human adult; and a concern that our actions should not make the world into a worse place, overall. It is argued that we cannot harm non-actuals, or for that matter benefit them. The actuals which count are to be determined not merely by their potentialities but also by the intrinsic natures of the bases which underly such potential ities. The decision about what action to perform must take account not just of the levels of happiness in those worlds, but also of whether we harm anyone with a morally relevant intrinsic nature in the process of achieving such levels. Some Contributions of Existential Phenomenology to the Philosophy of Natural Science, JOHN J. COMPTON Following suggestions from Husserl and Merleau-Ponty, a view of human perceptual practice in the pre-scientific life-world is outlined. The central thesis is that the practice of scientific inquiry is parasitic upon this more fundamental practice and, thus, that the world for science just is the perceptual world refined, interpreted, and enriched in special ways for special purposes. On this view it is found possible to understand (1) why scientific research programs function historically as they do; (2) how ex planatory hypotheses suggest themselves in the course of inquiry; (3) how the typical criteria by which we validate explanatory theories are moti vated; (4) how the realistic intentionality of theoretical claims may be explicated; and (5) how assertions of the existence of some new physical entity or structure may be justified. On Emotions as Judgments, ROBERT C. SOLOMON A common objection to cognitive theories of emotion is: "If an emo tion consists of cognitions (such as beliefs, judgments, thoughts,) A, B, C (whether these are construed as constitutive of the emotion, causal pre conditions of the emotion or in terms of the logical presuppositions of the description), then a counter-example to a (pure) cognitive thesis would be a person with cognitions A, B, C who does not have emotion E." And, of course, there are a great many such examples. Anger, for instance, is analyzed (in part) in terms of "judging that one has been offended." Considerations are raised, from which one might conclude, anger cannot wholly consist of the cognition that one has been offended. Such cogni tion may be part of anger, but it is at most a necessary but not sufficient condition for being angry. This article provides six arguments against this objection.</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 863 Gratitude and Obligation, CLAUDIA CARD The ethics of friendship requires clarification of the relationships between gratitude and obligation. The paradox in the idea of a debt of gratitude is unraveled by means of a distinction between two paradigms of obligation: the debtor paradigm and the trustee paradigm. Kant's and Aristotle's views on the obligations incurred to a benefactor are rejected in favor of Hobbes's on the ground that only Hobbes's account remains con gruent with the spirit of gratitude. The trustee model of obligation is then used to clarify misplaced gratitude, especially in relationships of unequal power. Science in a Different Style, JANE ROLAND MARTIN This paper explores the implications for the philosophy of science of the "different style" of doing science that the author abstracts from Eve lyn Fox Keller's account of Barbara McClintock's scientific practice and June Goodfield's account of Anna Brito's. It is shown that this style is not represented by our metatheories of science and argued that, even if philos ophy of science is defined to include discovery, there is no reason to expect it to be represented because it calls into question the very definition of the subject matter of the discipline. A discussion of gender is introduced to illuminate the problem of definition and, in conclusion, the values of rede fining the boundaries of the philosophy of science are addressed and the importance to that endeavor of a continuing sensitivity to gender is af firmed. The Paradox of Loyalty, PHILIP PETTIT This paper formulates and claims to solve a paradox raised by the ideal of loyalty. The paradox is that loyalty simultaneously requires the impartiality of a moral agent and the dedication of a devotee. The solu tion comes of recognizing that a reason for action can be at once a univer salizable consideration and a consideration particularized in favor of an individual person. Heidegger and the Intentionality of Language, RODERICK M. STEWART INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 28, No. 1, March 1988 Suffering, Soul-Making, and Salvation, WILLIAM HASKER This article sets out the general requirements which must be satisfied by a successful theodicy, and applies them to two contemporary theodicies</page><page sequence="4">864 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS for natural evil: John Hick's "soul-making" theodicy, and Eleonore Stump's theodicy of "suffering for redemption." It is concluded that Stump's theodicy encounters serious problems both of factual plausibility and of moral acceptability. The soul-making theodicy, on the other hand, is able to meet objections which have been raised against it with impres sive success. Is the Principle of Double Effect Morally Acceptable?, HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN The article presents and argues against three related formulations of the Principle of Double Effect. The Principle's basic formulation places four restrictions on the permissibility of acting when some of the conse quences of one's action are evil. These are: (1) the act is not intrinsically evil; (2) the good consequences are not the effect of the evil consequences, but (3) are commensurate with them, and (4) are alone intended. The Principle's second formulation replaces premise (3) with a foreseeability condition. If supplemented with the condition that the intended good must outweigh the act's unintended but foreseen by-product, as well as with a sixth, complex condition, the second formulation is transformed into the third, most plausible formulation. Abortion and Moral Development Theory: Listening with Different Ears, JANET E. SMITH Many studies have been done involving interviews of women who have had abortions; they provide invaluable data for those studying the effect of abortion on women. This article seeks to evaluate Carol Gilli gan's In a Different Voice. Gilligan uses abortion as a paradigm case to evaluate the moral development of women. The validity of her conclu sions is seriously undermined by the fact that she views abortion as a morally acceptable act. Her position on abortion has led her to fail to ask many pertinent questions of the interviewees. Those who hold abortion to be an intrinsically immoral act would "hear" these interviews "with different ears." This study seeks to demonstrate that claims that abor tion is an experience fostering moral growth cannot be sustained on the basis of Gilligan's study and, on the contrary, that they demonstrate that the women having abortions are not skillful moral reasoners. A Contemporary Bridge From Facts To Values: But Will Natural Law Theorists Pay The Toll?, PETER TUMULTY The alleged gap between facts and values supplies one of the more serious objections to natural law theory (NLT). Maclntyre shows in his book, After Virtue, that the emergence of the fact-value gap is tied to modernity's denial of a place for functional concepts in moral arguments. So, if a functional concept central to morality can be recovered, the basis will have been laid for bridging the gap between facts and values. The</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 865 concept of the self situated within a community that is the bearer of a tradition provides such a concept. However, this particular way of bridging the fact-value gap has implications for our understanding of NLT. NLT will be necessarily general in its formulations and always depend upon the virtues of historically situated selves for its proper in terpretation and application. These limitations of a revised NLT will perhaps be resisted by some natural law theorists. Moral Denial, Moral Weakness, and the Complicity of the Self, ALAN PASKOW How is it possible to be morally weak or morally denying? A morally weak person voluntarily acts against what she believes to be most right in that situation. A morally denying person seems not to notice that the action she performs is inconsistent with a moral principle to which she subscribes. Two opposing explanations of each kind of conduct have been repeatedly considered by philosophers. The morally weak person or the morally denying person is either ignorant of the true significance of her actions or she is aware of them. Yet if she is ignorant, then presumably she is not responsible for her conduct. Alternatively, if she is aware of her actions, then how could she have chosen what she believes to be wrong? This article attempts to find a solution to this dilemma?a prob lem unsolved by such ancient thinkers as Plato and Aristotle and by such contemporary thinkers as Donald Davidson, Am?lie Rorty, and David Wiggins. Hinduism on the Morality of Violence, JOSEPH A. MAGNO Despite the seemingly contradictory views expressed in the Vedas on the morality of violence?termed the "dharma-view" (which condones vio lence for a just end) and the "a/wmsa-view" (which condemns violence even for a just end)?it is argued that Hinduism yet embraces an ahimsic moral ideal. This is essentially done by showing that Hinduism equates the ahimsic ideal with the law of love, and that it enjoins fulfilling this law by following one's personal dharmic path (conditioned consciousness of this law). Whence, to follow one's personal dharmic path, even if it be not perfectly in accord with the ahimsic ideal, is deemed the most direct and efficacious means of realizing the ahimsic ideal. But this conclusion itself requires justification. This is supplied by arguing that to follow faith fully one's dharma is effectively to eat away at selfishness, the antithesis of love, and so to move ever closer to realizing the law of love and the ahimsic ideal. Did Darwin Destroy the Design Argument?, JAMES A. SADOWSKY</page><page sequence="6">866 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 26, No. 2, April 1988 Analytic and Synthetic Method According to Hobbes, RICHARD A. TALASKA Hobbes wanted to achieve in all philosophy the rigor he saw in geome try. He was particularly careful to explain and exemplify his under standing of geometric method, but these explanations and exemplifica tions are almost universally ignored. It is impossible to understand Hobbes's science, which is supposed to imitate geometric method in some way, without understanding Hobbes's interpretation of geometric method and his understanding of how something like geometric method can be applied to physics. This article (1) explains Hobbes's concept of method and its kinds; (2) presents his formal understanding of geometric method and offers a translation of a generally ignored Hobbesian text on the analytics of geometry; (3) explains Hobbes's understanding of how the paradigmatic geometric analysis is applied with its own proper degree of rigor to physics; and (4) discusses the relationship between the rigor in physical proofs and the role of hypothesis. The Intellect, the Will and the Passions: Spinoza's Critique of Descartes, JOHN G. COTTINGHAM This paper examines Descartes' theory of judgment and Spinoza's well-known criticisms of it. It is argued that, despite some important differences, there are many ways in which Spinoza's views, so far from being anti-Cartesian, can be seen as a natural development of those of Descartes. It is further argued that Spinoza's general critique of Des cartes' theory of the will does not take sufficient account of what Des cartes actually claimed, and that if the Cartesian concept of freedom is properly understood, Spinoza can be shown to be closer to it than he himself realized. The paper concludes with a brief account of the relation between the will and the passions; here again it is argued that Spinoza tended to misinterpret Descartes' true position and as a result exagger ated the difference between his own views and those of Descartes. Is Herbert Spencer's Law of Equal Freedom a Utilitarian or a Rights-Based Theory of Justice?, T. S. GRAY The law of equal freedom (LEF), a principle which is often held to be the central doctrine of liberalism, is the cornerstone of Herbert Spencer's political theory. However, considerable controversy surrounds Spencer's attempt to justify the LEF. John Gray has interpreted it in terms of utilitarianism, but Hillel Steiner has argued that Spencer, like Kant, pos tulates the LEF as a basic moral axiom of right. This paper offers a third view?that Spencer characterizes the LEF in terms of the notion of the moral sense. The moral sense originates the ethical intuition of the LEF and then the reasoning faculty evaluates and applies it in the light of</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 867 considerations of both utility and equity. As a result Spencer's theory may be seen as an ingenious attempt to reconcile two sets of urgent moral demands?the good and the right. HusserVs Position Between Dilthey and the Windelband-Rickert School of Neo-Kantianism, JOHN E. JALBERT All too frequently, the still vital debate over the relationship between the Natur- and Geistes/Kulturwissenschaften is elaborated only as a mat ter of metaphysical or methodological concern. This essay argues that Edmund Husserl, more than either Wilhelm Dilthey or the Wilhelm Win delband-Heinrich Rickert school of neo-Kantianism, brings more sharply into focus the problems associated with the ethical issue underlying the debate. How one gets from the factual to the normative, from the de scriptive to the prescriptive, is a central question in the Geistes/Kultur wissenschaften. The essay attempts to exhibit how the Husserlian methods of epocln?, eidetic variation, and eidetic reduction address the question while simultaneously bridging the gap between Dilthey's efforts to keep the Geisteswissenschaften in contact with "life" and the neo-Kant ian attempt to avoid the twin perils of relativism and historicism. The Wage of Sin is Orthodoxy: The Confessions of Saint Augustine in Bayle's Dictionnaire, RUTH E. WHELAN The purpose of the paper is twofold. It provides a detailed exegesis of the article "Augustin" in the Dictionnaire and challenges the mechani cal conception of intellectual influence, which causes Bayle to be read simply as a precursor of the Enlightenment. Bayle's emphasis on Au gustine's moral weakness is explored and attributed to five theological and political concerns buried in the article. The article concludes by arguing that Bayle, like Montaigne, must be read in terms of the sources and evolution of his thought. Citation functions as a kind of shorthand for Bayle and his well-read contemporaries but its allusions must now be painstakingly reconstructed. That reconstruction reveals that an essen tially anti-Catholic historiography is transformed by the creative miscon ceptions of its eighteenth-century readers into an anti-Christian polemic. Ergon and Eudaimonia in Nicomachean Ethics 1: Reconsidering the Intellectualist Interpretation, TIMOTHY D. ROCHE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 11, November 1987 Personal Autonomy and the Paradox of Feminine Socialization, DIANA T. MEYERS Some feminists maintain that traditional feminine socialization is antithetical to personal autonomy, yet other feminists have valorized the</page><page sequence="8">868 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS autonomy of the traditional woman. The account of personal autonomy in this attitude is designed to reconcile these views. Although the tradi tional woman lacks global autonomy, she displays episodic autonomy, nar rowly programmatic autonomy, and partial access autonomy. Thus, au tonomy is a matter of degree. Moreover, conceiving of personal autonomy as the exercise of a competency best explains the lesser forms of autonomy characteristic of the traditional woman's life, as well as global autonomy. Defective autonomy skills prevent the traditional woman (and many other people) from controlling the overall direction of their lives, but, since they have some proficiency with respect to these skills, they are able to achieve a measure of personal autonomy. Rel?vent Alternatives and Demon Scepticism, BREDO C. JOHNSEN It is argued that the recent insight that knowledge claims can be correctly evaluated only contextually?relative to relevant alternatives to the putatively known proposition?leads, when correctly understood, to the conclusion that scepticism about the external world is correct. Showing this involves showing both that the relevant alternativists have misunderstood the thrust of their own principal insight, that that insight is nevertheless genuine, and that once it is clearly understood, it can be seen not to undermine scepticism (as has been universally thought), but to support it. Aristotle's Solution to the Problem of Sensible Substances, EDWARD HALPER This paper advances evidence that Aristotle regards form or essence as both individual and universal. As usually understood, these characters are inconsistent, but when we examine Aristotle's arguments closely, what we find is that form is individual because it is one in number and universal because it is one in formula. These two types of unity need not be incon sistent. Aristotle ascribes both to form as a means of determining its nature. To be one in both ways form must be actuality. Because nothing else is able to meet these unity requirements, form must be actuality. An actuality is one in both ways because it is an entity that, though it happens to be present in a plurality of composites, exists to some extent separately from them. Enlightenment and Rationality, AXEL HONNETH The article discusses the broad front that has emerged in the critique of reason and would appear to have robbed enlightenment of its innermost rational medium. This critique is reconstructed in three stages: (1) the accusation that reason is exclusive in character, an objection countered by an anthropological relativization of rationality; (2) the suggestion that reason is instrumental in character; self-critical enlightenment had al ready parried this assumption by a self-differentiation of the categories it draws on; (3) the critique of reason has turned on the all-unifying com</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 869 pulsion inherent in the concept; this indictment has been answered by the formalistic self-restriction of the current concept of rationality. The au thor wants to demonstrate that in the process of self-critique, enlighten ment has already found an answer to each respective objection raised by the critique of reason. Mind Matters, ERNEST LE PORE and BARRY LOEWER Public Policy and the Allocation of Scarce Medical Resources, RICHARD L. BARBER Hylomorphism in Aristotle, CHARLOTTE WITT The Disclosure on Modernity: Hegel and Habermas, FRED DALL MAYR JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 85, No. 1, January 1988 Biological Functions and Perceptual Content, MOHAN MATTHEN Perceptions present objects as red, as round, etc: in general as pos sessing some property. This is the "perceptual content" of the title, and the article attempts to answer the following question: What is a material istically adequate basis for assigning content to what are, after all, neuro physiological states of biological organisms? The thesis is that a state is a perception that presents its object as F if the biological function of the state is to detect the presence of objects that are F. The theory contrasts with causal and informational theories, and with internalist theories, for example, those which assign content on the basis of introspected feel. Its advantages are that it permits perceptual error while at the same time allowing content to be expressed in terms of external properties. The argument of the paper is illustrated throughout by examples from biology and computational psychology. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 85, No. 2, February 1988 Logical and Analytic Truths That Are Not Necessary, EDWARD N. ZALTA Many philosophers believe that logical and analytic truths are para digm examples of necessary truths. In this paper, the author develops</page><page sequence="10">870 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS simple examples of logical and analytic truths that are not necessary. The examples reveal that there are contingent truths known a priori that do not result from "reference fixing." The examples also reveal that the popular variant of Kripke's definition of validity for modal languages frequently used by intensional logicians (namely, truth at all worlds, for every interpretation) is not equivalent to Kripke's. The author also shows that the other standardly cited examples of logical and analytic truths that are not necessary do not really identify the first point at which the notions of logical, analytic, and necessary truth diverge. Second-Order Logic Still Wild, MICHAEL D. RESNIK George Boolos has recently argued theories formulated within sec ond-order languages need not be committed to classes, sets or other sec ond-order entities: we may avoid that by interpreting second-order quan tifiers in terms of the plural quantifiers of ordinary language, which commit one only to members of the individual domain of one's theory. The article questions Boolos's logical and linguistic intuitions and points out that he is involved in a circle: he explicates plural quantification in terms of second-order quantification and that in turn in terms of plural quantification. That is not fatal in itself, since the standard explication of first-order quantification is similarly circular. However, while the first-order circle is an acceptable one, Boolos's is a dubious one at best. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 85, No. 3, March 1988 Tachyons, Time Travel, and Divine Omniscience, WILLIAM LANE CRAIG There is an intriguing but rarely appreciated parallel between dis cussions concerning the possibility of tachyons and time travel going on in philosophy of science and discussions concerning theological fatalism being carried on in philosophy of religion. The author shows how the opponents of tachyons and time travel often commit the same logical fallacy as the proponents of theological fatalism. The solution to theolog ical fatalism applied analogously to tachyons and time travel does result in some counter-intuitive consequences; the author suggests that a proper understanding of things "within one's power" can, however, miti gate these. Ducking Harm, CHRISTOPHER BOORSE and ROY A. SORENSEN Often A can transfer a threatened harm to B in two ways: by ducking, or by directly thrusting B into harm's way. For example, A, behind B at the end of a theater line, sees X about to fire a gun at him. A may either</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 871 jump aside, or "sacrifice" B by grabbing B as a shield. A knows that B will die either way. Common-sense morality approves ducking but dis approves sacrificing?or at least disapproves ducking less. Why? The puzzle affects law as well as ethics; but by standard doctrines, duckers and sacrificers are either both murderers, or neither. Six theories of the moral difference are examined and attacked: fair competition, included wrong, act and omission, causation, double effect, and Kantian exploita tion. A seventh option is to reject the distinction. Whatever one's con clusion, the sacrifice-duck distinction is an interesting act-omission ana logue within the realm of acts. The distinction itself needs further analysis. MIND Vol. 96, No. 384, October 1987 Two Conceptions of Coherence Methods in Ethics, MICHAEL R. DePAUL The method of reflective equilibrium defended first by John Rawls, and later by Norman Daniels, is the most widely discussed, most carefully specified version of a coherence approach to moral inquiry. However, it remains open to a conservative or a radical interpretation. The conserva tive interpretation essentially presents a procedure for resolving conflicts between beliefs on the basis of degree of commitment, while the radical conception goes on to endorse both revisions that do not rely on initial commitments as well as revisions that are not required in order to resolve conflicts inherent in a person's system of moral and philosophical beliefs. The radical conception, therefore, has a rather different look from other methods of inquiry. However, it accords more closely with the actual practice of moral theorizing than the more traditional conception. In addition, it leads a person to avoid types of irrationality to which the conservative conception is insensitive. Epistemic Virtue. JAMES A. MONTMARQUET In this paper a theory is offered of the epistemic virtues and their possible role in epistemological theory. These virtues are conceived as qualities of epistemic character (e.g., openness to the ideas of others) which an epistemically conscientious (i.e., truth-desiring person) would want to have. On this view, an epistemically virtuous person must be more than merely "epistemically responsible" (truth-desiring or falsity averse), as Lehrer and Kornblith tend to construe this notion. For he will have to have, in addition, the traits of character which such a conscien tious (responsible) person would want to have. These additional qualities need not, however, actually be truth-conducive (as this raises problems of Cartesian demons who make a world in which, say, wishful thinking is, unbeknownst to all, truth-conducive).</page><page sequence="12">872 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS The Imprecision of Impredicativity, ALEXANDER GEORGE Common mathematical wisdom holds that the natural numbers are not predicatively definable. By considering a (corrected) definition of the natural numbers first offered by Quine, the author shows that this view is tenable so long as we countenance imprecision in what our (already im precise) test for impredicativity is applied to and so long as we adopt a particular view about what is conceptually intrinsic to the notion of natu ral number. This is of interest not only in itself, but also in showing how the philosophy of mathematics should proceed: by identifying and refining a number of conceptions drawn from mathematical experience and bring ing them together, perhaps modifying each in the light of the others, to form a stable and comprehensive view. In this note, it is shown how a bit of mathematical lore, a conception of impredicativity and a judgment about conceptual truth are all knitted together in a self-reinforcing manner. Tacit Knowledge and Semantic Theory: Can a Five per cent Difference Matter? M. DAVIES Independence and Transcendental Idealism, M. LIPSON MIND Vol. 97, No. 385, January 1988 Personal and Impersonal Identity, T. L. S. SPRIGGE Philosophers differ as to whether transtemporal personal identity is more, less or equally as good a case of real identity than the transtemporal identity of ordinary physical things. The mood of Derek Parfit's philoso phy suggests he thinks it less of such a case, but his arguments may establish only that it is not more of one, and this is much less destructive of our ordinary views than his philosophy sets out to be. For one must distinguish destructive analyses of transtemporal identity as such from those especially of personal identity. It is argued here that once trans temporal identity is seen as in all cases the reexemplification of a concrete universal in fresh momentary instances, personal identity can take its place with other sorts of transtemporal identity as a quite genuine iden tity, though its ultimate significance is easily exaggerated. Logic and Meaning, MICHAEL KREMER This paper discusses the philosophical significance of Gentzen's se quent calculi and his "cut-elimination" theorem, focusing in particular on the idea that the introduction rules of a sequent calculus may be taken as "defining," or "giving the meaning of" the logical constants of that cal</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 873 culus. The history of this idea is traced through the writings of Gentzen, Dummett and Hacking. Critical analysis of their views leads to a sharp ened form of the thesis, which is applied fruitfully in a specific case?the theory of truth and the semantic paradoxes offered by Kripke. The Context Principle and Some Indian Controversies over Meaning, B. K. MATILAL and P. K. SEN Recent controversies about the exact significance of Frege's Context Principle (weak, strong and intermediate) are suggested, and the possible relevance of it to Russell's contextual definition is noted and refuted. The (Kantian) point about the unity of thought is raised and shown to be irrelevant. Next the controversy between two subschools of India's clas sical philosophy is discussed: primacy of what, words or sentences? The Indian argument for word-atomism is given and refuted. The argument for contextualism is given. The sentence-holism of Indian grammarians is also mentioned briefly. Finally, the point of contrast is this: Frege suggests that the meaning of a word is what it contributes to the meaning of the sentence (hence it has no meaning in isolation). The Indian Contex tualists say that a word might have a meaning in isolation but we can cognize its meaning only when it is connected with another word (i.e., imbedded in a sentence). Cognitive Significance without Cognitive Content, HOWARD WETTSTEIN THE MONIST Vol. 71, No. 1, January 1988 Progress and the Value of Space, BONNIE STEINBOCK The article criticizes "space enthusiasts" as unjustifiably optimistic about the ability of space exploration to improve the lot of mankind. Moreover, their purely instrumentalist outlook results in a warped view of the value of the natural world, and hence of what counts as progress. Space enthusiasm should be tempered with appreciation of the intrinsic value of the universe and a concernful respect for the natural envi ronment. The Ethics of Space-Based Ballistic Missile Defense, ANTHONY J. GRAYBOSCH This paper discusses the ethical and strategic dimensions of space based weapons and information systems. The evolution of the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI) from population defense to urban or point defense is addressed, as well as the efficacy of SDI in nuclear strategy. The</page><page sequence="14">874 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS author argues against the deployment of space based weapons and anti satellite systems because they contribute to instability in the arms race without compensating benefits. However, it is concluded that a limited, ground based, antiballistic missile system should be deployed immediately as an enhancement of deterrence. The discussion of space based systems is preceded by a defense of the morality of deterrence on utilitarian grounds. Moral Behavior and Rational Creatures of the Universe, LAURENCE THOMAS This article aims to show the importance of non-verbal behavior (bodily movements, especially facial expressions, and the character of one's voice?pitch, steadiness, and the like) to moral behavior. It is not simply that non-verbal behavior facilitates moral interaction, but that in the absence of such behavior most forms of moral interaction would not be possible. For instance, sincerity cannot be communicated in the absence of non-verbal behavior. It is argued that the problem with interacting with other rational creatures who are non-human is not that we would not aim to do right by them, but that, because their patterns of non-verbal behavior would be radically different from ours, it is highly unlikely that we would be able to determine whether or not they are interacting with us in morally appropriate ways. Space by Design: Aesthetic and Moral Issues in Planning Space Communities, ARNOLD BERLEANT and SARAH B. FOWLER The purpose of this paper is to reflect on the place and nature of art and the aesthetic in future human environments, specifically those envi ronments that humans will be creating in outer space. In the first part of the paper the authors argue for the normative nature of this enterprise, showing that the moral and the aesthetic are factors in the design proce dure for any community. The particular ramifications of this fact for extraterrestrial environmental design is also discussed. The second part of the paper considers more directly what the nature and role of art, in the form of artifacts and events, might be in outer space. It is argued that these changes extend far beyond the possibility of new materials and techniques to the fundamental nature of the artistic act. Radio Astronomy as Epistemology: Some Philosophical Reflections on the Search for Extraterrestrial Intelligence, ANTHONY WESTON This essay argues that despite its scientific veneer and plausible radio-astronomical rationalization, the contemporary conception of ex traterrestrial intelligence is wildly anthropomorphic. Some of this anthropomorphism is avoidable?science fiction writers like Stanislaw Lern do far better than the scientists?and avoiding it would leave us with a much more promising openness not only to alien forms of life, but also to nonhuman terrestrial life and finally also to ourselves.</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 875 Space Travel and Challenges to Religion, DEL RATZSCH It is commonly, although often uncritically, felt that the human con quest and colonization of far reaches of space on any significant scale would lessen the attractiveness and plausibility of traditional Western religious belief. In this article, several possible bases for that position are examined, and a number of related logical, moral, epistemological and psychological issues discussed. It is argued that the challenges are not powerful, and that in some cases they involve only new versions of familiar and ineffective traditional challenges to religious belief. A LHsentropic Ethic, DONALD SCHERER Labor Relations in Space: An Essay in Extraterrestrial Business Ethics, FREDERIC C. YOUNG THE MONIST Vol. 71, No. 2, April 1988 Art and Its Diachronie Dimensions, JULIUS MORAVCSIK This article argues for a new approach in aesthetics, taking as a fundamental starting point a pre-theoretical notion of art, including crafts, dancing, painting, and singing as paradigm types, and positing that art is a cultural universal. Within this approach, defining "art" is not a central task, nor is it crucial to examine aesthetic terms of evaluation within any particular natural language. What is central is to look for aesthetic universals on a sufficiently abstract level; possibilities are ex plored in the paper. Furthermore, within this approach, art-history is primarily comparative and interacts with anthropology. While exploring the possibilities of certain cultural and psychological contexts being more or less conducive to the development of art, such issues as stress on novelty and on individuality are placed within the proper perspective. Essence, History, and Narrative: T. S. Eliot on the Definition of Poetry and Criticism, RICHARD SHUSTERMAN The persistent failure to define (in any generally agreed-upon way) such basic notions as poetry and criticism has led some radical theorists to deny that poetry and criticism exist as distinct and proper disciplines. This paper shows that the definitional failures which generate this hasty conclusion derive from attempting to define and delimit these fields in terms of invariant and unchallengeable essences enduring through his tory, for poetry's and criticism's histories are rife with change, diversity, and debate. But it is further argued that such histories or traditions of pluralistic debate, rather than precluding the definition of these fields, can be seen as themselves constituting their definition and demarcation. The case is made by a close analysis of Eliot's treatment of the definition of poetry and criticism.</page><page sequence="16">876 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Plato and the Mass Media, ALEXANDER NEHAMAS The scathing attack on poetry in book 10 of the Republic is still, by turns, both incomprehensible and disturbing. A close examination of Plato's argument, however, reveals that it depends on assumptions which, though peculiar and controversial, are still made today, and by people who denounce Plato as vehemently as he denounced the poets. These assump tions underlie the current attack and disdain of television and of the mass media in general. In relation to popular entertainment, against which Plato's original argument was in any case intended, we are most of us still Platonists. Television is also the target of an additional argument, which denies it any aesthetic value. The paper concludes with an examination, and a relatively negative evaluation, of that argument. Engaging Emotion in Theater: A Brechtian Model in Theater History, PAUL WOODRUFF Brecht distinguished epic from Aristotelian theater in terms of its emotion-engaging properties. This article attempts to build on that model a new theory of the different modes by which theater can engage emotions. The analysis of these modes clarifies the nature of empathy, and affords the critic with distinctions among kinds of theater that are more durable, and less culture-dependent, than the genres of traditional criticism. Theater may engage emotions tonally (after the analogy of music), through fantasy, or in a cognitive mode. This last is the most theatrical, and what it engages is emotion in the fullest sense. On the Concept of the "Historically Authentic" Performance, PETER KIVY A growing number of musicians, musicologists and critics urge the performance of music in an "historically authentic" manner. The pur pose of the present paper is to explore the concept of historical authentic ity in musical performance, reveal some perhaps unsuspected conse quences of it, and to argue that some so-called historically inauthentic performances may, in a certain important respect, be more historically authentic than the "authentic" ones. Authentic Performance, STAN GODLOVITCH Should early music be performed on instruments and in the style typical of its time? Is authentic performance possible? If so, are histori cally authentic performances preferable to modern renditions? This paper surveys arguments by those favoring modern and liberal approaches to performance through the critical gaze of the purist, one who finds it quite unacceptable to perform early pieces on anything but historically appropriate instruments. The purist's position is then briefly developed with the implication that it is maximally consistent with (a) the com poser's intentions, (b) the functional bearing of instrumentation upon per formance, and (c) the very identity conditions for musical works.</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 877 What's Special About Photography?, TED COHEN Two seemingly obvious facts about photography are (1) with a camera it is much easier to make recognizeable likenesses than it is in any other picture-making art, and (2) the camera is an automatic machine. The paper attempts to say how these facts combine to make a peculiar charac teristic of photography as an art. Art, Practice, and Narrative, NOEL CARROLL Paradigms and Masterpieces: Rationality in Art and Science, S. J. WILMORE Gavin Hamilton's Oath of Brutus and David's Oath of the Horatii: The Revisionist Interpretation of Neo-Classical Art, DAVID CARRIER THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. 62, No. 2, Spring 1988 Participation in Plato's Dialogues, LEO SWEENEY The aim of this paper is to give a synthetic and overview interpreta tion of what Plato intends by "participation" in several dialogues. In Phaedo, lOOd ff., participation is the effect of the Forms' presence in things and of their having something in common. At Parmenides, 248e-249d, participation consists of things "being-caused-as-images-of Forms," where "cause" will in later dialogues be disclosed to be the Forms as models and goals and intellects as agents. In Sophist, 219b ff. and 226a ff., by productive art, intelligent agents?humans and divine?cause prod ucts to participate through contemplation of Forms as models. At Ti maeus, 26b-30d and 47e ff., working with the receptacle as the participant underlying all participation, the divine craftsman uses the Forms as models and telic causes in producing individual souls and bodies, together with the entire visible universe itself. Finally Symposium, 210e-211b, Phaedo, 79d, and Republic, 6.511d suggest that Plato's philosophy is not a phenomenology. St Thomas Aquinas on Necessary Moral Principles, JANICE L. SCHULTZ This paper shows how, according to Thomas Aquinas, basic descrip tive moral principles can be both substantive and necessarily true. Aquinas's position on reference (the function of the subject term) is simi lar to that of the contemporary logician, Saul Kripke, who argues for necessary informative propositions. Such propositions in Aquinas (which are analyzed in detail in the paper) include definitions and property state ments. The latter encompass those concerned with natural inclinations. From this foundation the necessity of fundamental moral principles is</page><page sequence="18">878 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS explained. Still, moral principles can be refined as we discover more about human nature; if true, such statements will be necessarily true. The paper ends with an explanation of how basic moral principles can be considered to be not simply per se, but also per se nota. Aristotle on Deliberation and the Practical Syllogism: Interpretations and Disputed Texts, ERIC W. SNIDER, JR. Alfred R. Mele has argued that deliberation can be represented prac tical-syllogistically. This paper argues, through an examination of inter preters (G. E. M. Anscombe, John M. Cooper, Martha Craven Nussbaum) and texts (De Anima 434al6-21; De Motu Animalium 701al7-25; Nicoma chean Ethics 1112bll-12, 15-20, 1147a24-28), that Mele's reasons do not suffice. There is a dialectic between one's position on the relationship between deliberation and the practical syllogism, and one's view of which texts are primary. An interpreter aims to interpret all the data (texts) in light of his theory (position). It is shown where these interpreters are mistaken and where their theory seems to lead to a misreading of the text in question. As a result this paper will have: (1) shown that Mele is wrong to suppose that deliberation and the practical syllogism are two distinct phenomena; (2) given better reasons for why deliberation is representable in the form of a practical syllogism; and (3) examined texts of Aristotle which can be shown to illuminate both deliberation and the practical syllogism. The Definition of Person: Boethius Revisited, PETER SIMPSON This paper defends the relevance and usefulness of the Boethian defi nition of person as an individual substance of a rational nature. There are two parts to the paper. In the first, various criticisms of Boethius's definition implied in the many contemporary alternatives in analytic and continental philosophy are raised and elaborated. While these criticisms are serious and weighty, they are not in the end successful. The second part of the paper shows that, properly understood, Boethius's definition embraces all that these other definitions embrace, and more. It is thus a richer as well as more accurate definition. Learning the Emotions, HAROLD W. BAILLIE This paper argues that the emotions exercise a limiting function on ethical choices, and that they also provide positive direction for those choices. Drawing on Aristotelian ethics and psychology, these claims are based on the fundamental unity of reason and emotion present in human life. The ground of this unity is nous, a type of life activity characterized by intentionality and epistemic realism. Nous is not fully present in either reason or the emotions taken alone, but expresses itself through both. Thus, a correct moral view can issue only from an orientation that is developed from both cognitive and emotional claims. The article at tempts to explain and illustrate the role of the emotions in limiting and guiding the range of choice. In so doing, the focus of the article is on the precognitive moral orientation of the emotions, not on the subsequent</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 879 development of moral habits. Examples are taken from commutative justice, friendship, parental love, and political life. PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 37, No. 149, October 1987 Expressions of Passage, GILBERT PLUMER It seems a contradiction to hold of something both that it took a while and that no time elapsed or passed between its start and finish; there is a connection between the ideas of temporal extendedness and passage. The article develops this connection into a defense of the passage view of time and shows how without this sort of defense, conclusions of arguments putatively in support of the passage view may be reinterpreted as not in fact being expressions of that view. Transcendental Arguments, Transcendental Synthesis and Transcendental Idealism, QUASSIM CASSAM Transcendental arguments are best seen as consisting of two compo nents: (a) a conceptual component, which claims that self-conscious expe rience requires the possession and exercise of specific conceptual capaci ties; and (b) a satisfaction component, according to which these capacities could only be possessed and exercised in a world of a particular kind (for example, a world of spatial objects). This proposal casts light upon the notion of "transcendental synthesis," and the role played by transcenden tal idealism in the "Transcendental Deduction." If transcendental argu ments are to be viable, what is required is an adequate account of the modal status of the conceptual component and a defence of the uniqueness claim made by the satisfaction component. Trying, J. F. M. HUNTER The main contention of the paper is that the word 'try' is not the name of an action, and hence that such questions as which action it is in a particular case, or whether it is an inner or an overt action, do not arise. 'Try' has various uses, chief among them being to indicate with what ambition an action was performed, or what action one would have per formed, had it not been for some impediment. Nomic Necessity and Contingency, GEORGE N. SCHLESINGER PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 38, No. 150, January 1988 Anscombe on 'Ought,'CHARLES R. PIGDEN The article attacks Anscombe's thesis that the moral "Ought" should be dropped as the senseless survivor of a defunct conceptual scheme</page><page sequence="20">880 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS (Christianity) and that we should operate (in future) with a less preten tious non-moral notion (an "Ought" which can be derived from "Is"), using it to build a virtue-based neo-Aristotelian ethic. It is argued (1) that the only nonconventional "Oughts" derivable from "Is" will be hypothetical; (2) that if these are to generate an ethic, it must pay to be good, which is (as Anscombe now seems to realize) implausible; (3) that a certain soph ism is commonly used in selling the virtues; and (4) that Anscombe's conceptual claim?that the moral "Ought" is senseless?is based upon historical errors. The Consequentialist Can Recognize Rights, PHILIP PETTIT There is a serious problem about reconciling consequentialism with rights, especially when rights are understood as trumps. But the problem is soluable. Provided that the goal meets certain specifications, provided in particular that it is an "essential by-product," a policy of promoting the goal can call for certain rights to be taken seriously. On the Consistency of ' Jeffreys's Simplicity Postulate, COLIN HOWSON Jeffreys's Simplicity Postulate has been charged with inconsistency by Popper and Watkins. In this paper it is shown that the charge is based on a misreading of Jeffreys, and that the Simplicity Postulate as stated by Jeffreys himself is consistent. Popper's argument for his own equation of simplicity with improbability is also examined and rejected. It is then argued that, although consistent, it is arbitrary, and should not be in cluded within the corpus of Bayesian methods. The paper concludes that all so-called objective priors are equally arbitrary, and that the Persona list Bayesian theory nevertheless furnishes just as objective a logic of inductive inference as first order logic, say, furnishes for deductive in ference. What It Is Like, GREGORY McCULLOCH What Justifies Restoration? S. J. WILSMORE PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 48, No. 3, March 1988 Vico on the Production and Assessment of Knowledge, ROBERT J. TRISTRAM The role of each of the faculties in cognition and the sorts of method that must be employed in acquiring and testing knowledge have been central problems in both ancient and modern philosophy. This paper</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 881 examines Giambattista Vico's solutions to these problems by means of a detailed account of his discussion of the faculties of sense, memory, imagi nation, ingenuity, and reason; of the operations of perception, judgment, and reasoning; and of the arts of topics, criticism, and method. It is claimed that both in his early work, "On the Ancient Wisdom of the Italians" and in his New Science he believes that the three arts regulate, respectively, the three operations, each of which has a special relevance to one or more of the faculties. Indeed, it is argued that, for the Vico of the New Science, there is a dialectical and an historical logic in the relation ship between the faculties, operations, and arts. The paper shows, more over, that this logic provides crucial insights into how knowledge, espe cially of a philosophical and scientific kind, is produced and must be as sessed. Kant's Fourth Paralogism, C. THOMAS POWELL The Fourth Paralogism is, in a sense, something of a stepchild, either passed over in silence or given a minimal treatment in any discussion of the Paralogisms proper. This is done, of course, with some justice: the Fourth Paralogism in the A edition of the Critique is directed toward refuting the thesis that we cannot be sure of the existence of the external world, and this task is shifted in B to the Refutation of Idealism; while in B the Fourth Paralogism appears to be reduced to a few remarks on what Sellars has called Kant's ignorabimus about the mind-body problem. The purpose of this paper is (1) to examine the two versions in order to deter mine what Kant himself takes the Fourth Paralogism to be, (2) to suggest likely sources for this Paralogism, and finally, on the basis of this reading, (3) to consider in what way Kant's critique of the Fourth Paralogism contributes to the attack on "rational psychology." Frege on Cardinality, LILA LUCE There is a great motivation within Frege's theory to construe the cardinal numbers as quantifiers, which are higher-level concepts. But Frege argued that the cardinal numbers are objects, not concepts, and defined them accordingly. Moreover, Frege's hierarchy of concepts pre vented him from construing the numbers as concepts. The purpose of this paper is to bring out the quantificational nature of the numbers in the face of these obstacles. The quantificational view is pressed onto Frege's concept of number as it traces its development from the Begriffsschrift, through the 1880s, into its formalization in the Grundgesetze. The theory yields surprisingly easily under pressure from the quantificational view and one sympathetic with that view may take encouragement from the fact that it was Frege's hierarchy of concepts, not his actual arguments, that prevented his construing numbers as quantifiers. Conditioned Autonomy, STEPHEN ENGSTROM The aim of this paper is to show that, although there are passages in Kant's writings that suggest the presence in his moral theory of a rigorous</page><page sequence="22">882 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS distinction between good and evil and an unacceptable associated view that all human agents are, without distinction, evil, there is nothing in his basic conception of morality as grounded in the autonomy of practical reason that commits him to rigorism or the unacceptable associated view. In the first part of the paper, some preliminary remarks are made about the idea of autonomy and a setting is furnished for it by outlining Kant's view of the practical context of deliberation and choice. In the second part, Kant's descriptions of two conditions of human character, namely, frailty and impurity, are examined as a means of dissociating the idea of autonomy from the rigoristic distinction. A notion of conditioned autonomy is developed that does not involve rigorism and so allows us to draw moral distinctions between human agents. In conclusion some close connections between the idea of conditioned autonomy and Kant's notions of virtue and impurity are indicated. Virtues and Principles, JOHN WAIDE This paper responds to the following assertion: It is sometimes said that any virtue judgement (that JTis a virtue or that P is a virtuous person) always presupposes some moral principle (e.g., concerning the goodness or Tightness of acts typically performed by people with the character trait X) which cannot be articulated as part of an ethics of virtue. Therefore, virtue ethics is always derivative from principle ethics. The paper focuses on an underlying assumption of this assertion: that a principle is the only thing which can count as a good reason supporting a moral claim. It examines the assumptions Kant makes about the role of principles in morality and O'Neill's recent claims that Kant gives us primarily an ethic of virtue rather than rules. Finally, a possible justification for virtue claims that do not rely on principles is suggested. Actions and the Body: Hornsby vs. Sartre, KATHERINE J. MORRIS Hornsby claims that actions are tryings which cause bodily move ments. This theory has certain presuppositions and consequences which are incompatible with Sartre's phenomenological observations on the body. It makes room for scepticism about other minds; it involves gener alizations from aberrant to ordinary cases; and it treats the relation be tween a person and her body like the relation between a person and an instrument. That Hornsby's theory falsifies the phenomenology of the body does not ipso facto show her theory to be wrong; but it raises very general questions about the nature of philosophical inquiry and philosoph ical claims, including the claim (central to Hornsby's theory) that actions are events. Scientific Psychology as Hermeneutics? Richard Rorty's Philosophy of Mind, JOHN FURLONG Richard Rorty's view of the nature of mind suffers from the tension between his strategy of hermeneuticizing epistemology and his local tactic</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 883 of replacing folk-psychological explanations with a scientific taxonomy. Strategically, Rorty will say, science is just one of a number of well-en trenched practices, none of which exceeds the others in illuminating the truth of things or facts of the matter, since there are no such truths or facts. This "pragmatic" or "holist" approach should lead one to expect Rorty, at the local, tactical level, to be suitably soft?nonreductionist, tolerant of folk psychology, and neutral regarding versions of scientific materialism. Yet he is a self-confessed functionalist and eliminativist. Such a "hard" local view, it is argued, is inconsistent with Rorty's "soft" strategic architecture and bodes ill for any commensuration between "ho list" and psychophysical functionalist positions. Against Naturalizing Preconceptual Experience, HANS SEIGFRIED This paper tries to demonstrate that scientific, theoretical knowledge cannot be judged empirically by measuring it against either preconceptual or pretheoretical experience. It can and must be judged transcenden tally. It is argued that a theory is justified transcendentally by its suc cess in methodically reorganizing natural experience in terms of the trans parency required for the calculating and planning of human action. The development of theoretical understanding, both in the natural sciences and in philosophy, turns out to be an "unnatural," even "anti-natural" affair. For it tries to achieve completely and transparently what in every day life has already globally but darkly been accomplished by simply and passively submitting to inherited concepts and beliefs, and by accepting loose ends. In order to attain its "unnatural" end, theoretical under standing must in each case artificially deconceptualize what is pretheore tically given and in controlled small steps, i.e., methodically reorganize it from scratch. Parfit and the Buddha: Why There Are No People, JIM STONE This paper argues that there are no persons (in Locke's sense of the word 'person'). It begins by arguing that Reductionism with regard to people is incoherent. Two of Derek Parfit's arguments for Reductionism are examined. The Spectrum argument turns out to support an Elimina tivist stance as much as it supports Reductionism. The Fissioning argu ment alleges to show that identity is not what matters in survival?but the argument begs the question and a counter-argument shows that if identity is not what matters, nothing matters. This conclusion is used to show that a consequence of Reductionism is that there is nothing which can consider itself as itself in different times and places?there are no per sons. Now we must choose between Realism (the view that persons are ontologically extra to bodies, brains, and psychophysical events, and Eliminativism (the view that there are no persons). The paper argues that the Realist ontology is both unscientific and theoretically unsatisfy ing (e.g., it leads to an infinite regress). Eliminativism follows from a consistent naturalism. The Humean and Buddhist views are compared; they complement each other in diagnosing the source of the conviction that persons exist.</page><page sequence="24">884 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS That Obscure Object of Desire, ERMANNO BENCIVENGA Verbs of desire and search are more difficult to account for than (other) intentional contexts because, whereas what we think of may well be nonexistent, what we desire cannot be. This difficulty is treated here as an anomaly for the traditional philosophical paradigm based on the conceptual priority of objects, and the possibility is explored of dealing with the anomaly in a different (Kantian) paradigm which attributes conceptual priority to experiences. Moral Realism and Dummett's Challenge, JAMES C. KLAGGE If the truth-values of certain sentences from a disputed realm can only be decided on the basis of evidence, and such evidence does not exist because of gaps in the auxiliary class of sentences, then we cannot, even in principle, be in a position to decide the truth-values of those disputed sentences. Because of evidential gaps, some sentences about mathemat ics, character traits, fictional characters, and so forth, are undecidable in principle. Michael Dummett has challenged realists about such realms to explain how we are supposed to have so much as a conception of a state ment's having a determinate truth-value in the absence of any evidence that would help decide the matter. But this challenge cannot be brought against all forms of realism. In particular, it cannot be brought against moral realism, because no particular moral judgments (about actions or states of affairs) can be shown to be undecidable in principle. A "Semantic Realist"Response to Dummett's Antirealism, ANDREW WARD In his "What is a Theory of Meaning? (II)" Michael Dummett argues that a truth-conditions theory of meaning, such as Donald Davidson's, cannot account for the meaning of many natural language sentences. This failure leads Dummett to adopt a verificationist, and so antirealist theory of meaning. In this paper, the author argues that by distinguish ing the roles played by a coherence and correspondence theory of truth in his theory, Davidson can answer Dummett's argument. PHRONESIS Vol. 32, No. 2 L?gica e sem?ntica nella teoria aristot?lica della predicazione, VINCENZA CELLUPRICA The first part of this paper deals with the problem of predication as that of how a thing can be "one" and have "many" names (Plato, Sophist 251a-c, and Aristotle, Physics 1.185b25-186a3). It is argued that the view that words are names of some thing and predication consists in applying</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 885 names to things leads Aristotle toward a consideration of different mean ings of on, hen, tauto to solve the problem. A new interpretation of the distinction between Kath'hauto legesthai and kata sumbeb?kos legesthai is supplied which permits the understanding of the Aristotelian solution. The second part examines the role played by the distinction in the heis logos-polloi logoi theory in De Interpretatione with regard to different claims in Metaphysics 5.6. PHRONESIS Vol. 32, No. 3 Why Justice and Holiness are Similar: Protagoras 330-331, JEROME WAKEFIELD As the first step in his attempt to demonstrate the "unity of the virtues," Socrates argues at Protagoras 330-31 that "justice is like holiness and holiness is like justice." His premises are "holiness is holy," "justice is holy," "holiness is just," and "justice is just." The standard view is that Socrates' premises are intended to establish that justice and holiness share some properties, and therefore are similar. This fails to explain Socrates' specific choice of premises; moreover, it makes the argument patently fallacious, contrary to textual indications that it is considered sound by both Socrates and Protagoras. This paper offers a fresh analy sis which explains both the force of the argument and Socrates' precise choice of premises. It shows how the argument, construed as being about states of character and their powers to produce virtuous actions, fits nicely into Socrates' overall goal of arguing for the identity of the virtues. Aristotelian Powers, WILLIAM CHARLTON Aristotle distinguishes between active and passive powers, between two kinds of active power, and between a narrow conception of power which excludes and a wider conception which embraces what he calls nature. The article clarifies and elaborates these distinctions. It is ar gued that the distinction between active powers is between powers of an object in its formal aspect, which are not strictly speaking causal, and powers of it in its material aspect, which are. Powers which make up an object's nature are identical with rather than owned by its matter and form. They are neither active nor passive in a causal way, but in a non-causal way material powers are passive, and formal active. Skeptical Homeopathy and Self-Refutation, MARK L. McPHERRAN There are two time-honored cornerstones of anti-sceptical argumen tation: (1) the charge that the sceptic cannot "live his scepticism" and (2)</page><page sequence="26">886 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS the charge that the claims and argumentative practices of the sceptic involve him in "self-refutation." One of the few sceptics to deny (1) but accept?and even embrace?(2) is Sextus Empiricus. Unfortunately, Sextus does not attempt to offer much more than metaphorical accounts to explain how it is that the Dogmatists' case against the Sceptic is not aided?and that the Sceptic emerges unscathed from?a successful charge of self-refutation (e.g., we are told "as a purgative expels first bodily humours then itself, so the Sceptic's arguments first refute Dogmatic claims and then themselves"). This paper offers an interpretation of these metaphors, and with it, constructs a defense of Sextus against the popular charge that his acceptance of self-refutation is either insincere or incoherent. Causes and Empiricism: A Problem in the Interpretation of Later Greek Medical Method, R. J. HANKINSON The article addresses the question of what precisely was the attitude of the Empiricist doctors towards causes, and in particular antecedent causes; the sources give apparently conflicting accounts, some suggesting that they accepted evident or antecedent causes, rejecting only "hidden" causes; others that they adopted a universally Pyrrhonist position. The article attempts to show that, with a suitable analysis of their general methodology, and in particular their attitude towards signs and their views on linguistic propriety, a coherent and indeed powerful account of the role of antecedent causes can be attributed to the Empiricists.</page></plain_text>
