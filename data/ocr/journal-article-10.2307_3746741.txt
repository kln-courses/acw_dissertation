<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY deprived it of its personal and anthropomorphic attributes. This also serves to explain Bodin's particular antipathy for the dogmas of the Trinity, the incarnation and the redemption. GUIDO DE RUGGIERO. (Translated from the Italian by CONSTANCE M. ALLEN.) PHILOSOPHY IN RUSSIA. IN U.S.S.R. dialectical materialism is still the only subject discussed by writers on philosophy. Philosophical publications during the last year include Lenin's Philosophical Note-books; Dialectical Materialism and the Theory of Balance, by Selektor; Marx's Philosophical Development, by Lipendin; A Course of Dialectical Materialism, by Markuse; Dialectical Materialism and Social Democracy, by Rudash; The Idealistic Dialectic of Hegel and the Materialist Dialectic of Marx, by L. Axelrod. On the occasion of the fiftieth anniversary of Marx's death the Communist Academy Institute of Philosophy has published a Symposium containing papers on materialistic dialectics, on the relation of Marxism-Leninism to culture and natural science, and discussion of those papers. A number of small textbooks on dialectical materialism, or Diamat as it is called for short, are issued for university schools not only in Russian but also in some of the languages spoken in the Soviet Union. The only philosophical publications on other subjects are a booklet by Bogdanov, a professor of mathematics, on A ctual Infinity, with reference to Zeno, Newton, and Cantor; D. Zuev-Insarov's Handwriting and Character; a translation of Kuno Fischer's Hegel and of Giordano Bruno's Della Causa, Principio ed Uno. The revival of interest in the Hegelian philosophy after the publication of Engels's Dialectics of Nature in I925 held a hope that Soviet writers might outgrow their materialism and develop some new line of thought. For the last few years, however, they have done nothing but repeat over and over again the stale arguments used by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and even Stalin! The reason for this state of things is obvious to anyone who understands the conditions of life in U.S.S.R.-but this does not help to make Soviet philo- sophical writings more interesting. The utter absence of independent thought, and constant appeals to the authority of Lenin &amp; Co., makes them weary reading. Lenin's Philosophical Note-books, a volume of 472 pages in fine red binding, contains synopses that Lenin wrote of philosophical books he had read, and his comments upon them. Most of the space is devoted to Hegel's Philosophy of History and to his dialectical method, of which Lenin thought very highly. Other parts of Hegel's teaching do not seem to have made much impression on Lenin's mind; thus, he takes Hegel to be defending materialism whenever Hegel speaks of objectivity. The Note-books have no philosophical value whatever but throw some light on Lenin's personality. Apparently the least reference to God made him lose his temper. Thus Hegel remarks apropos of Epicurus that his system is lacking in the conception of a world-purpose, of the wisdom of the Creator; Lenin copies out the remark and writes in the margin, "Sorry for God, are you ? You idealist scum!" Soviet Russia did not send any delegates to the Congress of Philosophy in Prague last September. An article about the Congress appeared in the magazine Under the Banner of Marxism (Nos. 5 and 6). The author, Z. Kalandar says that modern bourgeois philosophy is suffering from "atomization, disruption, 222</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHICAL SURVEY and general decay." The Congress has shown, he thinks, that the only concern of the "scared, rotten, and impudent bourgeoisie" is "to leave the world unchanged." It is, of course, only natural that Soviet philosophers should have kept away from such a congress. All who want to know what dialectical materialism is ought to read an excellent little book by Professor Lossky on the subject, just published in Paris. Unfortunately, it is so far only available in Russian and in Czech trans- lation. Lossky begins by an examination of mechanistic materialism, which is sharply contrasted by Soviet writers with dialectical materialism, and then goes on to discuss Hegel's dialectical method, so essential to the latter theory. He criticizes Hegel's conception of the identity of opposites, pointing out that unity is not the same thing as identity and that the law of contradiction is in no way cancelled by the real process of change. Passing on to a detailed examination of dialectical materialism, he shows that it is full of self- contradictions which are supposed to be a legitimate result of the dialectical method. Matter is endowed with qualities utterly inconsistent with the original meaning of the term; "motion" is taken to mean every conceivable kind of creative activity and development. Matter is declared to be "all that is" (see Byhovsky, Ocherk filosofii dialecticheskago materialisma); "it is extremely rich in content and has a multitude of forms. It does not receive its qualities from spirit but can itself create spirit as well as all other qualities" (see Yegorshin, Yestestvoznanie, filosofia i marxism). Lenin speaks of it as a "creative force, endowed with a power akin to sensation." Why this god-like, all-embracing entity should be called matter remains a mystery, but evidently Soviet writers have to be materialists at all costs. Both the "dialectical" and the "mechanistic" materialists insist that all being is spatial and temporal in character; both hold that knowledge arises through the impact of material particles upon our sense-organs; both deny freedom and are strict determinists. Lossky has made a careful study of dialectical materialism and his account of it is lucid and straightforward. He scrupulously points out every element of truth that he can find in it, and his fair-mindedness makes the book par- ticularly valuable. An interesting work has been published in Prague by the German Society for Slavonic Research and the Slavonic Institute, Hegel bei den Slaven (494 pp.), under the editorship of Tchizhevsky, who contributes an article of 250 pages on Hegel in Russland. Hegel's influence was very strong in Slavonic countries and particularly in Russia. Tchizhevsky points out that Russian thinkers have been very much alive to the concrete character of Hegel's thought. He proves this by reference to I. Ilyin's famous book on Hegel and to the works of Losev, Lossky, Frank, and Florovsky. All these writers maintain that Hegel's method is one of intellectual intuition and that questions raised by him are of vital importance for the further development of philosophical thought. This is well brought out in Florovsky's article, The Crisis of German Idealism, in Orient und Occident. Two new books by Berdyaev have been published in Paris, Ya i mir objectov (The Self and the World of Objects) and Sudba cheloveka v sovremennom myre (The Fate of Man in the Modern World). In the first, "an essay in the philosophy of solitude and of communion," as Berdyaev calls it, it is argued that the isolation of human beings from one another brought about by their ego- centrism dooms them to solitude which can only be overcome "on the spiritual plane, in mystical experience where all is in me and I am in all." The natural man tries to escape from his solitude through knowledge, but all he can know is an impersonal and lifeless world of objects with which there can be no 223</page><page sequence="3">PHILOSOPHY communion. His fellow-creatures, in so far as they too are regarded by him as objects, form a society which tends to crush the individual and is inevitably in conflict with his inner spiritual life, The only way out is to rise to a higher plane and discover, through mystical knowledge, not mere objects but other personalities with whom the self can enter into living communion. In so far as man recognizes his own self as a person he cannot be reduced to the level of a mere organ of the social whole. In the course of the book Berdyaev says many brilliant and profound things, and his defence of personal freedom against all forms of social tyranny is admirable; but some of the problems he is struggling with are of his own making. There is nothing in the nature of cognitive activity to confine it to the apprehension of "lifeless objects," nor is there any difference in kind between sensuous and mystical knowledge, since both rest upon a direct perception of the reality before us. Epistemology is not Berdyaev's strong point; he is at his best in dealing with questions of practical philosophy. His second book, The Fate of Man in the Modern World, short as it is, is an excel- lent analysis of the impasse to which mankind has come in this "de-humanized and de-Christianized" age. The conception of the inherent value of human personality is fast disappearing; a plaything of irrational forces and instincts, man is valued merely as part of a social whole, as a member of a certain class or race. After drawing a gloomy but very convincing picture of modern civilization, Berdyaev shows that the only hope for mankind is Christianity, which alone stands for the value and dignity of personality, for freedom, brotherhood, and social justice.
