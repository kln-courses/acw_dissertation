Mr. Winter's portion of the book contains a translation of Nicolaus Steno's Prodromus and four introductory chapters on the life and work of that early "geologist." The book is splendidly illustrated with eleven plates. It reminds one somewhat of Dr. Singer's earlier Studies in the History and Method of Science, but its appeal, even among students of science history, is considerably restricted, owing to its more specialized subject matter. ALBUREY CASTELL UNIVERSITY OF MINNESOTA The Wisdom of the Body. By WALTER B. CANNON. New York: W. W. Norton &amp; Co., 1932. Pp. xv +312. A superior distillate, for the educated layman, of modern investigations of the complex chemical and physical factors at work in the body of man and other animals, by a master in this field. In the healthy adult man these diverse forces lead to a dynamic equilibrium or relatively steady state (e.g., the blood pressure, blood volume, heart rate, body size, body weight, etc.), called by Dr. Cannon "homeostasis." The analysis of home- ostasis is the central theme, rendered somewhat anthropomorphic by a title borrowed from the late Professor Starling. The volume, as a whole, is a model in accuracy and lucidity. But the final chapter ("Relation of Biological to Social Homeostasis") is an anticlimax, an excursion into sociological speculation. Argument by analogy may have some merit, if the conclusions lead to experimental tests; otherwise it appears to the re- viewer an infantile pastime if not a nod. This danger of nodding, even on the part of our ablest scientists, when talking too persistently to laymen, crops out but seldom in the scientific chapters of this book. But the head- ing of the Bibliography list is so worded as to make the reader think that all the discoveries and generalizations in physiology of the last hundred years have been made in the author's laboratory in Boston. This is a nod, completely contradicted by the scientific chapters. A. J. CARLSON UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO Medicine and the State: The Relation between the Private and Official Practice of Medicine with Special Reference to Public Health. By ARTHUR NEWSHOLME. Baltimore: Williams &amp; Wilkins, 1932. Pp. 300. Considering the number of books and periodicals published on medical subjects in England and America, literature in these countries has had</page><page sequence="2">652 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY singularly few examples of volumes dealing with the public aspects of medicine. Books by Sir William Osier, W. W. Keen, Richard C. Cabot, and others have been widely read by other than physicians, but these have dealt with personal rather than public relationships. In this country medical scientists and practitioners alike appear to have been absorbed in the study and care of disease and to have failed to investigate, or to express themselves upon, the economic facts and the problems of social organization upon which the actual application of medical knowledge to the service of human beings largely depends. Some books on public health in this country have touched the subject on certain sides, and in England may be mentioned Dr. W. A. Brend's notable volume, Health and the State (published in 1917). Sir Arthur Newsholme's recent series of "International Studies," re- viewing social and economic aspects of medicine in European countries, has been a needed addition to the scanty literature on this subject in Eng- lish. The fourth volume of this series represents Sir Arthur's interpreta- tion of medicine as it functions, or should function, in the modern world. This, like the three preceding volumes, is the result of studies undertaken by the author at the request of the Milbank Memorial Fund. Bringing together in brief compass a wide range of facts and presenting also the mature opinions of a personage of authority and experience, this volume should, and undoubtedly will, command a wide range of readers and sub- stantial influence on both sides of the Atlantic. The author is chiefly con- cerned with the problem of payment for medical care, with which sickness- insurance systems and tax-supported plans for hospital care or other forms of medical service have primarily dealt. He appreciates also, though this point is subordinated in his discussion, that the technological develop- ment of medicine with its high degree of specialization and the increasing dependence of the physician upon equipment and technical personnel compels changes in the organization of medical practice itself. Sir Arthur recognizes this when he says, "If the family is to continue to be the unit of medical practice, then a team of medical practitioners and not an iso- lated practitioner should be the unit on the medical side" (p. 78). No one recognizes more fully than he the need of extending preventive methods as the most humane measure for relieving suffering and disabil- ity and as the most economic measure for reducing their costs. He is not in favor of administering general medical services by government, and this volume, as well as his preceding books, makes clear the fallacy, too widely disseminated among the medical profession in America, that for- eign sickness-insurance systems are "state medicine." Group methods of</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 653 paying for medical care rather than the traditional payment by individu- als at the time sickness befalls must be the primary economic basis for dealing with the uncertain and unpredictable costs of illness, or, as he puts it (p. 58): "The problem of medical care has ceased to be one that can be solved by direct family payments and has become one of determin- ing the best method for securing satisfactory medical care, when needed, by provident measures, supplemented perhaps by communal aid [taxes]." The problems of determining the best methods (for obviously there is no one best method) are succinctly discussed in this book from the point of view of both the public and the professions involved. While the ap- proach is that of the physician, sociological and economic factors are largely recognized. The importance of competent public administration in any matter affecting the sensitive relationships between physicians and patients is emphasized as one would expect from this author, and carries its warning to Americans who would suddenly place upon administrative bodies in this country demands which few are prepared to meet. MICHAEL M. DAVIS JULIUS ROSENWALD FUND The Physician of the Dance of Death: A Historical Study of the Evolu- tion of the Dance of Death Mythus in Art. By ALFRED SCOTT WAR- THIN. New York: Paul B. Hoeber, Inc., 1931. Pp. xvi+142. $7.50. A bit of dramatic irony is connected with this review. Soon after re- ceiving the volume the reviewer wrote the author, and received a formal notice of his death. The volume, which approaches the curiosa of the bibliophile catalogues, represents a hobby of a famous specialist of the University of Michigan staff. It consists of illustrated and scholarly descriptions with some ana- lytic commentary on the changing attitudes toward death evidenced in the artists' "definitions of the situation." While there is no evidence of oral tradition associated with this art pattern, the word "mythus" is not overstretched in describing it. Its gradual modification as it is imitated through several cultural epochs has much in common with other folk lore and legend. The origins are unknown, probably French, though France contributed little to its development. In its earliest form the dance of death was a didactic religious device for social control. Representations of the dead, however, gradually become representations of death. During the Renais-</page></plain_text>
