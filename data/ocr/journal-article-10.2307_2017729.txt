<plain_text><page sequence="1">RECENT CATHOLIC VIEWS ON ART AND POETRY A LL poetry is divided into two parts: the coming into being and the shaping up. Those concerned with poetry have realized this at least ever since Socrates, commanded in a dream to make poetry, worried because-though he could fit words musically to- gether-he could not invent. Trying to clear his duties during his last days in prison, he "composed"; but he had to borrow the original substance from Aesop, being himself sterile. Recently Catholic writers, artists, and lovers of art have poured a new in- tensity into the meaning of these two parts of all art and their mutual adjustment. The freshness of their views comes from the thoroughness with which, reviving old thoughts and observing new agonies, they have made the "coming into being" into travail and birth out of a "dark night," the "shaping up" into rightly -ruled construction in any material; and the final fusion of the two is negotiable only by Divinity. The most dramatic assertion of the constructive half of art is Eric Gill's: "I say that to make a drain- pipe is as much the work of an artist as it is to make paintings or</page><page sequence="2">RECENT CATHOLIC VIEWS ON ART AND POETRY 655 poems."' "Artists belong in the class of all workmen, doing useful jobs." The second part, the mystical birth of poetry, is best described by Jacques Maritain: "In a way, . [ . [the artist] is not of this world, being, from the moment he begins working for beauty, on the road which leads upright souls to God and makes invisible things clear to them by visible." 2 Neo-Catholic theorists of the artistic process might display an emblem to pic- ture their paradox: a drawing of Christ as the divine carpenter. The suggestion receives support from a sentence in Art and Scho- lasticism: "Pondering the art or activity peculiar to the artifex, * . . [the Doctors of the Middle Ages] pondered the activity which Our Lord chose to exercise throughout His hidden life; they pondered also, in a way, the activity even of the Father; for they knew that the virtue of art is to be predicated peculiarly of God, like Goodness and Justice, and that the Son, plying His poor man's trade, was still the image of the Father and of His action." 8 Let us follow the Catholic breaking-down of the two crucial concepts, "craft" and "inspiration," into elements, and examine the nature of that final element which is used to bring them to- gether. As craftsman, an artist is a human being especially impelled to work himself outward. In contrast with the thinker, whose habit is introspective, the artist belongs with practical men, who deal with things, and whose attention is directed to the environ- ment. In the insistence that art, by nature, makes a work, a work that stands by itself outside the workman, the Neo-Catholic ac- cents his typical realism. Modern estheticians, it is asserted, "penetrated with subjectivism and the doctrine of empathy,"' have missed the essential feature in the creative operation of artists. At the base of all authentic explanation of the artistic act is placed its pure objectivity. The literal meaning of the word "objective" is emphasized: "ob-jective" equals "thrown over against''-jete dans l'etre. In the background of these phrases of the Neo- Thomists is Book VI of the Nicomachean Ethics where the line is drawn between the artistic virtue and intelligence of man and his moral character or prudence. "Art . . . has its excellence (or perfect development] in something other than itself, but this is not so with prudence." Prudence fulfills itself in the good of the agent. In St. Thomas this becomes: "Making is an action passing into outward matter- whereas doing is an action abiding in the 1 Erie Gill, Art (John Lane, 1935), p. 4. 2 Jaeques Maritain, Art and Scholasticim (New York, 1930), p. 38. a Ibid., pp. 20-21. .4 Mareel de Corte, Bevue Thoimste, Vol. XLII (1937), p. 392.</page><page sequence="3">656 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY agent." The free gloss of Maritain on the Thomistic definition of such "making," "poiein," "poeticite"' is as follows: Art as such has for its end, not to know, but to produce or create,-not in the mode of nature, as radium produces helium, nor as one living being en- genders another, but in the mode of spirit and freedom. . . . [Art] is con- cerned with the productivity of the intelligence ad extra. . . Because of . . [intelligence 's] superabundance it has an intrinsic tendency to express and manifest itself in the world [au dehors], to sing.5 This native propulsion or need of speech must, in the next place, submit itself to training in order to become art. So St. Thomas makes art not an ephemeral adjective of a human being, but a persisting habit. The native propensity beeomes a fund of energy and expertness always at the owner 's disposal. In the days when art was actually identified-with craft, the apprentice learned his trade in a workshop or studio, and "copied line upon line the very living and varied action of his master." There was thus built into the youthful organism a skill that could be relied upon to furnish through the years well-made objects for human use. But as the master adapted his habit to the shape of the event, so also the pupil learned to do. The life and mobility of the skill was presumed to pass into the apprentice along with the fixed out- lines of the tradition. In this sense art as craft was action upon matter as free as disciplined. Maritain calls the artist's habits living rules. The last element named in our analytical process, viz., the freely swinging pointer of the craftsman's habit, inevitably limits the number of craftsmen. But on the whole, wherever there is working reason employed in shaping matter to useful ends, there is, in the view before us, the artist. In other words, the definition of craftsman, in the main, concerns only broad human traits: the will to produce, submission to discipline, and the possession of the right rule in the mind. The specifications'do not call for rare gifts or extraordinary powers. The making of shoes, ships, and painted pictures alike becomes art, differentiated only by the dis- tinctions of material and place of future service. In a word, art is continuous with all trades and skills. Eric Gill's whole autobiography might be called a free com- mentary on the Neo-Scholastic conception of the artist's process. Cutting letters in tomb-stones was his special craft. He turned to this when he became disgusted with his place as a young archi- tect's draughtsman for the Ecclesiastical Commission in London, and sought elsewhere an honest job and a true art. What made 5Jacques Maritain, Situation de la poeie (Paris, 1938), pp. 96-97.</page><page sequence="4">RECENT CATHOLIC VIEWS ON ART AND POETRY 657 him rebellious in the architect's office was the perception of lack of integrity in the business that went forward. There the work- man was not in the work. The practice of drawing went on in utter independence of, and even ridiculing, what the drawing was for. The draughtsmen made "twiddles on paper," and the work- men somewhere else were supposed to turn the twiddles into lively sculptured ornament, he complained. The end or rule was out of joint with the means or manufacture. The ecclesiastical intention was that the drawing should realize itself in stone for the glory of God according to the Anglican confession. But the draughtsmen never touched stone and they were agnostic. Gill said that he wished to "be a workman and demand a workman's rights, the right to design what he made; and a workman's duties, the duty to make what he designed." 6 All the canons of Thomist doctrine he believed to be satisfied by the art of carving letters as he intended to follow it: a right form coming directly from a right rule in the mind; no imitation, no sprawling emotion; a thing made, not the image of a thing; the "making" conducted accord- ing to the controlling conditions and regulations of a "trade," the production of an obvious utility. These are his words: Lettering has this . . . advantage over other arts; at its very base, con- joined and inseparable, are the fair and the fit-most obviously useful and de- pending for its beauty upon nothing but man's musical sense. The shapes of letters do not derive their beauty from any sensual or sentimental remi- niscence. No one can say that the 0's roundness appeals to us only because it is like that of an apple or of a girl's breast or of the full moon. We like the circle because such liking is connatural to the human mind. And no one can say lettering is not a useful trade by which you can honestly serve your fellow men and earn an honest living. Of what other trade or art are these things so palpably true? Moreover it is a precise art. You don't draw an A and then stand back and say: there, that gives you a good idea of an A as seen through an autumn mist, or: that 's not a real A but gives you a good effect of one. Letters are things, not pictures of things.7 In accenting the homo artifex, i.e., the artist as good workman and shaper, the Neo-Catholics have gone as far as possible into precedents, and, some might feel, into speculative regions. For the skilled maker, in his religious orientation, acknowledges descent from God, the prime Maker and Builder. The infinite God, to be sure, makes all things by the simple effluence of His Wisdom. His light rays out, giving form and being to all creatures, just as physical light gives visible boundaries and spatial relatedness to the common objects of natural vision. Of course, in this sense, 6 Eric Gill, Aiutobiography (London, 1940), p. 115. 7 Ibid., p. 120.</page><page sequence="5">658 THE JOURNAL OP PHILOSOPHY man can not make. But even so, the craftsman fashions his habit on the habit of Deity. Having pursued the analysis of art as craft to its religious fruition, let us follow the Catholic analysis of art as inspiration. The first condition of poetizing, says Maritain, is the interior silence. There is a recoil from the senses upon the center of the self and a long germinating slumber. The poet's retreat to the interior of his soul is as natural, he tells us, as the return of the bird to its nest. And when the soul returns to its center, it car- ries with it to "the mysterious nest of the soul" the whole world which it has put in fee. How has it put the whole world in fee? By collecting much experience and then hoarding it. His collection of much experi- ence is the result in the first instance of the poet's peculiar capac- ity for suffering, not merely "suffering" in the sense of "feeling pain," but in the sense of suffering things. To "suffer" things, to receive their signature, is a relationship to the environment more emotional and intimate than knowing, more speculative and removed than loving. That it is the latter precludes absolute consummation in mysticism, which implies complete absorption in the object. The "suffering" of the poet is a special synthesis of affection and vision, but distinct from either alone. The verbs used by Maritain mean "take," "seize," or "capture," and the process becomes reciprocal. The sight or sound that "takes" the soul becomes in its turn captive. The artist "suffers" the impact of the active energies of things only in his turn to "embowel" them. The Neo-Catholic alters and elaborates artistic impressionabil- ity almost beyond recognition, for he relates it not to the semblance or appearance but to the actual Presence or true meaning. The suffering involved in the poetic emotion, Maritain says, follows from the poet's kinship with the very secret of the concrete, the inwardness of essences, the "quiddit6s, qualit6s, talit6s, haecceit6s, ipseites" with which single and real existences teem. The poet has a voracious appetite for Being, and Being as such. Marcel de Corte describes the poet's penetration of Being thus: "There is something really existent which poetical experience seizes and ravishes mysteriously." 8 Thus, we see, it is not the mere sense- less flux-the world's foolish weather, so to speak-that the poet suffers, but rather Meaning motion fans fresh [his] wits with wonder. He captures the formative actions of things that he, with his pe- culiarly formative capacities, inclines to. He grasps a thing's 8 de Corte, op. cit., p. 368.</page><page sequence="6">RECENT CATHOLIC VIEWS ON ART AND POETRY 659 intention or direction, its number, weight, proportion, analogy. His own tense individuality and realized energy make him more than any other human being "infinitely aware" of the "typical existent" in its full flowering or at its being's crown. The sensitiveness of the artist, then, means in the view now before us that the life and energy in man meets and assimilates the life and energy in things. The phase of collection is followed by the phase of recollection. Or to be more accurate, the phase of harvesting impressions is fol- lowed by the phase of their storage in the phantasy and memory. Memory's title, Mnemosyne, Mother of the Muses, implies the transition of potential poetry from an external place and relation to the poet's mood to an interior residence. It signifies the con- version of sense-impact, culled events, into spiritual substance. Memory gives the Muse a thesaurus of forms. What the inspired artist has turned in this way into coin of spirit, and memorized or "learned by heart," he holds long in reserve and cherishes as a rich fund of individual shapes and im- pressions. This hoarding temperament is in sharp contrast to the normal way of the practical man who spends experience as fast as he gets it. The life of the man of affairs goes forward in a process of quick exchange with the environment. He does not mull over the impressions that he receives, but passes them out again to the busy human congregation in which he spends his time, much in the form in which he receives them. The result is that the normal practical man is almost always in play at his surface, and at different points of his surface. He is distracted in the sense that his occupation calls for lively adaptation to varied external demands. T. S. Eliot reminds us of the strained, time-ridden faces Filled with fancies and empty of meaning Tumid apathy with no concentration Men and bits of paper....' The poet, on the other hand, is ill-adjusted to surface calls, be- cause his life is within. His major function is, so to speak, to sleep. Only he must be a good dreamer. Indeed, the words "slumber," "retreat," "ingathering" spell inactivity only from the point of view of the comparatively insignificant conscious activity we are most used to. The soul in retreat has its own kind of peculiar intense activity. "In poesy man is concentered at the base of his human reality. There he yields to quietude-but not in the least to the illusory quietude of the inactivity and vacancy of thought, 9 T. S. Eliot, Collected Poemna, 1909-1935 (New York, 1936), p. 217.</page><page sequence="7">660 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY but to this infinite quietude in which all the energies and all the relations are in activity." 10 What, then, is the intense activity of the recoil? The collected and storied energies continue to operate when they are in the poet's mind. They engage, there, with the general psychic power. The psyche as a whole swells within the wider Spirit that moves through all things. In this way the Inspiration of the poet re- veals its identity with the Prime Craftsman, the Architect of the World. What has happened, indeed, is convergence from different di- rections u-pon a paradigm of Creativity. A maker of ships or shoes models his craft, however much he molds matter and coa- lesces with the "practical man," in the last resort on Pure Essence or Productive Intelligence. A singer of lyrics feels the stirrings and pressure of this same Productive Intelligence far within his spiritual bowels. The ideas that seem so far apart-methodical skill and ecstatic imagining-come together because both involve engendering and direction by the same Being. This common spring and law makes them commensurable, and the craftsman, however humble, weaves an analogue of poetry in his coat, and the poet, however bubbling and inflamed, abides by the lines and rules of technique. Anyone who follows this theory sympathetically must be im- pressed by its' esthetic insight, moral sensitiveness, and dialectical subtlety. But difficulties remain. The two conceptions seem to get together partly because they are themselves ambiguous, and partly because they are subsumed under a vague all-mothering Idea. This vague concept is that of Pure Act or Being Itself, which grounds both craft and the "factive idea," or inspiration, of the poet. In part, Being is treated as the "luxury " or " abound- ingness" of whatever is, i.e., analogical Being. One might even go for light on this Catholic concept to Santayana's gloss on Spi- nozistic Substance: "the realm of essence in its omnimodal im- mensity-in its capacity for infinite variation of forms." Or one might think of Goethe's observation on the elements in Be- ing that nourish Genius: "All is influence except ourselves.1" Cocteau himself in "Professional Secrets" says: "The poet is a believer. In what? In everything." M. Maritain 's drift at times seems this way, for example, when he is discussing the theory of poetry of M. de Corte. De Corte insists that poetry has nothing to do with the conceptual understanding, but bears directly on pure Being. Yes, replies Maritain, always remembering that 10 RaYssa Maritain, " Sens et non-sens en po6sie " in Jacques Maritain, Situation de la po6sie, p. 46 n.</page><page sequence="8">COMMENTS AND CRITICISM 661 Being, as the poet's intuition grasps it and is moved by it, is in- finitely varied, generous, and rich. The Being which the poet cognizes, and which burns and lives and springs in him, is the heart of all that is intimate and the delicacy of all that is fragile. The reality of Being must not be confused with a naked abstraction. However, interfering with this concept of Being, infinitely wide, deep, and colorful, is the concept of the God-man. The artist's productive soul then becomes the theatre of a moral com- bat, and a good and wise analogue of himself is seen at war with a Devil, who is, in a quasi-human fashion, bad and foolish. Or if these two major protagonists are not stirring the poet's depths, angels, black and white, are. This is, of course, picture-thinking, the approach by myth to the reasons for things. A complex theory, such as the present one, may well display a paradoxical emblem that brings together in a pictorial metaphor a carpenter and God. But a flickering concept that unites and separates pure Being and an anthropomorphic God is hardly a stable basis for a philosophy of poetry. KATHARINE GILBERT. DUKE UNIVERSITY.</page></plain_text>
