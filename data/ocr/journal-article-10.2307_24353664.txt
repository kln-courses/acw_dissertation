<plain_text><page sequence="1">Journal of Applied Philosophy, Vol. 4, No. 2, 1987 165 Aggression: myth or model? ALBERT VAN EYKEN abstract The word, aggression, refers in general usage to unjustified attack, and any serious writer who uses it extensively in some figurative or newly-coined technical sense should leave his meaning in no doubt. Unfortunately some ethological writers fail to do this and deceive themselves into the bargain. They somewhat naively claim to find aggression built into the fundamental nature of animals, a kind of instinct which cannot be resisted, indeed which must figure in their social cohesion. If the word really retains the moral connotation which I have indicated, then much animal biology is vitiated. Not only are animals misjudged, but, since conclusions are then applied to our human selves, we too are misjudged and rec ommended to adopt false moral principles. It is possible that ensuing armchair pseudo-cures may be responsible for a real increase in human violence. Moral Implications of Aggression There has been a multitude of books about aggression, but a singular lack of either careful definition or analysis. Anthony Storr once wrote that it was difficult to write about human aggression "because the word is used in so many different senses". I would say, on the contrary, that it is easy to write a popular book about it precisely because people now customarily use it in a most elastic fashion. Storr himself suggested that it ought to be dropped or else more closely defined. The title of the book in which he said so is Human Aggression [1], but in fact one looks in vain in it for a clear definition. Aggression may be seen, he said, in the red-faced infant squalling for the bottle, the concentration camp guard, the suicidal neglected wife, and the footballer. Already the need for definition becomes apparent, for, on the face of it, there seems to be little connection between on the one hand the yelling infant and the suicidal wife, and on the other the concentration camp guard and the presumably unsporting footballer. The fair-minded but perhaps naive reader may feel that the baby has a case and the wife at least an excuse, unlike the other two examples! Now I have by this last sentence brought in a moral factor such as is too often considered irrelevant in scientific discussion; I must therefore immediately justify myself, for certainly science must consider phenomena dispassionately and objectively. But the fact is that the word, aggression, cannot, as it is currently used both in common speech and in the practice of many ethologists, be readily divested of its moral significance. Nor is it by any means carefully used by a considerable number of specialists and popularizers, to the extent that Professor S. R. L. Clark, a very careful observer, is able to say: "The term 'aggressive' is now hopelessly obscure" [2]. In scientific practice a writer is entitled, within limits, to give to words a specialized meaning, provided it is so understood by the reader and a fortiori by the writer himself. If the word chosen is already widely current in general non-specialist use the new</page><page sequence="2">166 A. van Eyken distinction should be left beyond doubt. I propose therefore to clarify the customary implications of the word, aggression, and then to show how extensively some very well known ethologists continue, in spite of their claims to be speaking technically, to retain these same customary implications. On the second issue it may be noted that Konrad Lorenz' book entitled On Aggression is known in its original German as Das Sogen annte Bose [3]; yet nowhere in the text is there any explanation of the omission of sogenannte, (i.e. so-called), but, paradoxically enough, an indication on p. 7 that he intends to deal only with 'real aggression' as opposed to predation. Surely there must be a clarified difference between diamonds and so-called diamonds! But let us consider first the customary meaning of the word, aggression. It might perhaps be pointed out that, at least according to Cassell's German—En glish Dictionary, the meanings of Bose are given almost exclusively as bad, evil, malevolent, etc. Might Lorenz therefore have legitimately added sogenannte (so-called) to his title, and might he or his translator have thought that aggression could fairly be used unqualified, being perhaps less exclusively bad? But this, far from sufficing, even emphasises the error; the fact that the German word is apparently so loaded with moral taint indicates that in German at least it is not so readily disinfected. Nevertheless Lorenz uses it although there was available the slightly less hostile word, Angriffslust. I do not insist that aggression or any other word must be capable of rigid definition without nuances. Language must have a degree of elasticity, and words may legiti mately be used in a figurative fashion. Nevertheless some words have a really obvious central core of meaning at any given stage of their evolution. I take the Pocket Oxford Dictionary and, without surprise, I find the only definition given for aggression is unprovoked attack. No doubt this entry was chosen as the central meaning of the word in general acceptance, without prejudice to our right to use it in more extended and metaphorical ways. We might talk of playing aggressive chess, for example, without necessarily suggesting that a player knocks the pieces from the board or even merely makes an angry exclamation. We could have said that he played in a dominant fashion, with his opponent desperately on the run; here our last three words make a further use of metaphor, though I think the average listener will understand quite well what we mean. But that aggression still retains the central meaning which I have quoted—unless the context clearly implies some departure—is really obvious. If we say that Hitler was the aggressor in the last war it is beyond question that we mean something more than that he was dominant, or that he had his opponents on the run. I repeat therefore that unless we stipulate or clearly imply to the unprejudiced reader that we are using our key-word in a specialised manner we shall create confusion. Suppose then that a jeweller draws no distinction between diamonds and so-called diamonds! The general reader assumes the central meaning which I have indicated, and no better vindication of his right so to do may be found than in a peculiar suggestion made by Bach &amp; Goldberg in their book bearing the equally peculiar title, Creative Aggression. They say: "To most people aggressiveness is synonymous with unpro voked, senseless, and hurtful hostility". This is beyond doubt, but the authors proceed immediately to add, "This horrific definition of the term, which we believe is a distortion of a potentially constructive process, has embedded itself rather firmly in the consciousness of most people" [4]. Indeed, it has so embedded itself, and indeed it is at least unpleasant, if not always horrific, but such is its meaning, and one has no right to hi-jack it and deny its previous function, for it will certainly mislead many a reader as well as often beguiling the writer. We should now take a closer look at the word, unprovoked, for it indicates in a</page><page sequence="3">Aggression: myth or model? 167 striking manner a confusion which lies at the heart of much popular ethology. When there is talk of animal aggression we are directed to consider a certain kind of intraspecific behaviour in which one member of the species seems to have a strong tendency to resent the proximity of a fellow-member for no obvious other reason. Few writers would invoke aggression to explain why a dog chases a rabbit; the word is generally retained for more obvious conundrums—those widespread tendencies to quarrel, which, when they appear in civilized humans, would be regarded as unneces sary and inappropriate to situation. Certainly if I were to shout in a rage at anybody who passed my garden gate I could legitimately be regarded as aggressive; and of course this is because I do not have any justification. On the other hand, if I shouted at somebody who persistently threw rubbish over my hedge I would not so readily be called aggressive, the whole difference being in the matter of justification, and this is so definite that we may generally be content to talk of aggression without actually prefacing it with the redundant adjective. Notice that this must be a moral considera tion rather than a purely scientific one. Justification, or its absence, cannot refer to a merely physical or biological reason since there can be no question that everything, whether in pure physics or chemistry, or indeed in human or animal behaviour, must have a reason of some sort. Animal Aggression and Territoriality Now, apply this argument to the behaviour of animals; they too behave in response to causes even if these are often obscure to humans. If we say that they behave aggressively, that must mean without justification in the moral sense since as reason able scientists we cannot doubt that there must be some explanation, whether physical or psychological, whether determinist or according to some less rigid philosophy. In fact I believe it is only because some ethologists see animal pugnacity so often exemplified without apparent explanation that they are tempted to classify it as aggressive—not seeing an obvious explanation they rashly resort to an ethical term without really examining it. For indeed there is a prevalent vague assumption that an action which is unjustified is an action without an explanation, particularly as we all have an accepted practice of saying, for example, that some people may become hostile for no reason whatsoever, meaning thereby no adequately justifying reason. Yet in a strictly scientific context all identified causes are ipso facto scientifically adequate. Any ethologist who fails to get his distinctions clear is now lost! He is confusing cause concealed with cause unjust and failing into the bargain to understand that even unjustified acts have causes adequate as explanation but inadequate as justification. In the event he invokes an aggressive impulse in vacuo. In general speech of course we do talk of, say, a bad dog, or a vicious shark, thus attributing to them a moral shortcoming, but this is, quite pardonably perhaps, to import into their world standards which can only be demanded of humans. I do not wish to estimate the moral awareness, if any, in an animal other than human. Quite obviously however, our speech often over-estimates their power to appreciate moral considerations. But when we are trying to be scientific we ourselves must make distinctions, and I suggest that few animals, perhaps none, can be aggressive in the generic sense of the word. This is because they cannot see so deeply into the implications of their behaviour. Much of their activity would, if imitated by humans, be very wrong, but of course it cannot be arbitrary even though it may often look pointless to us, particularly in their intraspecific hostilities. Self-evidently however,</page><page sequence="4">168 A. van Eyken there must be an adequate cause for everything that they do, and to say that the explanation of their intraspecific hostilities must begin with an appeal to an inborn and fundamental aggressiveness (an urge to fight or threaten for no other reason than its own satisfaction) is really no kind of an explanation. It merely lends a pseudo scientific validity to the false idea that, when an animal, for example, bares its teeth, or growls, or makes grimaces of resentment at a conspecific, it does so without any trace of reason being implicit therein to match behaviour to the realities of the situation as apprehended by the animal. It is worse to suppose a similar pointless urge in men, and even to recommend its occasional expression as a safety device (i.e. mere release of pressure without reference to fittingness). I grant of course that appeal is made to evolution to explain how such a mysterious aggressiveness first arose. Failing to see the relevance of some kind of behaviour to situation it is always a temptation to push the obscurity back into the past and say that the behaviour was inherited through the selection of similar behaviour over the generations; in this way no real explanation need ever be called for, beyond chance variation and the blind selection-process of environment. I do not say that, for example, Konrad Lorenz, when he talks of animal aggression, specifically means that animals other than humans lack a moral sense (although in fact he does not seem to think that they are entirely without it, and neither do I). I would say rather that the mistaken use which he makes of the word aggression, leads him, like a number of others, to attribute to man a kind of aggressive instinct shorn of an ethical component. We humans are certainly animals, and if there is an aggressive instinct in animals, then I do not doubt that we have it; but I argue that animals do not have an aggressive instinct anyway, at least not in the sense of a mere urge to kill or to be hostile! Lorenz and some other ethologists assume that here we have a fundamental drive (accompanied no doubt by various inhibitions equally genetic) whose only raison d'etre is that it has proved useful though blind in other contexts. Fighting and killing are useful in the competitive search for food, but, since they are counter-productive in those frequent encounters which occur within the species whenever there is no real call for intense rivalry, their full manifestation is said to be impeded by inhibitions, so that they express themselves merely in aggression rituals, and are thus appeased. We have all observed how animals threaten each other and how their quarrel is then so often resolved without bloodshed; Lorenz and other ethologists concentrate on these encounters and bring to our attention many interesting aspects of the manner in which one or other of the participants in a threatening-match signals submission and thereby paralyses the wrath of his opponent. But, as pointed out by Stephen Clark in a contribution to the book, In Defence of Animals, "The wolf does not (generally) kill [his rival]—but that is evidence that he does not wish to, and perhaps never did wish to" [5]. This is a very important observation, reminding us that it is not necessary to assume that intraspecific threats are signs of an autonomous urge—there are reasons for them, though these might not be appropriate for humans. When a dog growls at another dog we may not immediately see the rationale thereof since we perhaps do not see the territorial limits claimed or trespassed upon (which may be marked out by smells or merely by some sense of the propriety of a certain distance to be main tained); these are no doubt the equivalent of our own fencing and doors, whose reasonable importance is well understood, by us in our human comprehension, as by the dog in his more modest fashion. We humans have no need ourselves for crude displays, simply because we generally have enough understanding of our situation to settle disputes and rights by peaceful negotiation through speech, but the other animals</page><page sequence="5">Aggression: myth or model? 169 can see less profoundly into problems; it suffices for them to realize that any conspecific is a potential rival for commodities and should be warned off in the only manner available at their level of intelligence. They are not expressing an aggressive urge, they are negotiating over a meaningful point, although the point may not be concretely presented to the human observer. We need not therefore learn from them any lesson as to the desirability of some kind of aggressive demonstration, however attenuated, in ourselves. We are more intelligent and can resolve our differences more subtly than by sparring or by slanging matches. If all just and peaceful solutions escape us we may perhaps resort to force, as for example, if I jump on a thief. But the only aggression illustrated here is on the part of the thief (obviously unjustified in the ethical sense), whereas my own use of force is justified, and indeed nobody in ordinary parlance would think of calling my action aggressive! The matter of territory is perhaps the most striking field in which the short sightedness of some ethologists may be revealed. Robert Ardrey, for example, has written a whole book entitled The Territorial Imperative, where he asserts, "The territorial nature of man is genetic and ineradicable." And he continues, "We shall see, further along in our enquiry, a larger and older demonstration of its powers in our devotion to country above even home" [6], Now this matter is extremely important since it connects with the question of warfare, which might reduce all territory to a radioactive desert, with nobody left to quarrel over it. Of course it is now part of the stock-in-trade of popular ethology, and yet a little common sense, and even platitude, may also be relevant. Territory then is the land, water or air wherein embodied beings live and move. It is the envelope of life, and if we leave this envelope without taking some of it with us we are dead. By way of second platitude we remind ourselves that as living beings we take up space, and that no two bodies can be in the same space at the same time. So therefore territory is a necessity of logic and of practice for everyone. Further, it is naturally desirable that this territory which we occupy should be comfortable, i.e. that we should be able to occupy it without intrusion upon us. From these platitudes a number of profundities follow: such as that a fragment of grit in my eye is intruding on my living-space, and I shall naturally take action to rectify matters; my eye will water, I shall be careful about the movement of my eye lid, and I shall use my hands and my reason to get rid of the intrusion. Again, I require a little air, preferably that which has not entirely lost its oxygen in the lungs of another person. I want an area long and wide enough to lie in at night, and sufficient range to be able to cultivate, or to hunt for my food without, if possible, too many competitors. Add to these matters the fact that I am not inclined to wander too far into the unknown, since I have neither the energy to do so nor the reasonable assurance of finding another suitable bed or suitable sustenance. Hence I associate myself with a piece of territory, and this, it would seem, is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. If I did wander too far too carelessly I would in fact sometimes be trespassing where another creature might legitimately or illegitimately take exception, since he too wants food, a bed and living-space. All this is common sense, but a number of writers, having come to call my property-sense an instinct, have now reduced it to incomprehensibility, a drive of the genes, the prompting of a blind, though profitable, accident of evolution, a 'territorial imperative', inevitably a kind of aggression that means the delights of war, or riot, or some Olympic substitute. This is supposed to derive from a million years, and thus we forget that any creature, even if it</page><page sequence="6">170 A. van Eyken sprang fully developed from the dust, would also have a sense of territory, and also make some slight effort to retain it, even if only by breathing! He may need it for further functions of course, e.g. food-gathering, socialising, or sexual rituals. It might be objected here that air is not territory, but it certainly is so for the birds. In any case ethologists will tell us how some animals take about with them an obvious but less well defined frontier, such that they do not allow proximity within a certain distance. This underlines the fact that fixed territory is but one kind of property, and there is really nothing more mystical about it than the desire of all creatures to enjoy their world unmolested. Let us agree however that fixed territory is the securest of all property and therefore has our best understanding, and our most immediate response. If you take away my food I may find more on my territory, if you take away my books and pictures I may buy more, but if you take away my territory I shall get no food (unless I trespass) nor shall I have anywhere to keep my new books and pictures! I allow therefore that we have a strong interest in real estate combined with an almost mystical attachment to tribal, racial and national soil; but this feature is not just a territorial imperative genetically determined. In Africa one is aware of tribal attachment to soil; hence for example the matter of Mau Mau in Kenya. At the same time one is aware of movement away from the soil; hence the urban squalor of shanty town. Men are not so simple as limpets or jewel-fish, or wolf-packs which mark with urine the boundaries of one hundred square miles. With men, only one territorial imperative exists; they want a given place to live, and it is a much more obscure problem (though not beyond the writ of reason) why they want this place or that, and what specific activity they may associate with it. Seen from this angle the territorial imperative is remote from any suggestion of necessary hackles, necessary collisions, necessary demonstrations, or necessary substi tutes when peace raises a provocative head. Nobody can want to have undisputed possession of any territory in the way that certain ethologists would have us believe. For undisputed territory is only relatively so, and its possession is amenable to reason, permanent in principle, often in fact. In general, men may like to say that they have undisputed possession of their home and country. They may well prefer to be home owners rather than tenants, and they would resent dictation by a foreign power. This is normal and reasonable; yet we cannot but see that the tenant is temporarily an owner, and the owner is not undisputed master, for he pays rates, he has to respect his neighbour's rights of access to light across his garden, nor can he allow his own dog to become a barking nuisance even though it may be still on his own territory. Similarly a state must grant overflying rights, tourist rights, transit rights, an endless list, for, if it refuses, there will be a like set of forfeits imposed by the aggrieved parties. Thus therefore we see that territorial claims are neither absolute nor blind; with men they are, or can be, a compromise, and promises do not have to be mechanical or genetic, but simply reasonable. It comes to this, that property, including territory, has often been fought over and may often be fought over again, but it does not have to be so. Even if the whole world turns communist, the territory will still be there, and the choice will still remain whether to fight over it or negotiate. But if we follow Ardrey and declare that negotiation is a form of aggression we shall have practically decided to fight and find reason in the trumpet. Now the test of arms and violence is indeed a kind of reason, although reason is not one kind of violence. Animals rely on violence or the threat of it simply because they lack fuller reason. They fight or demonstrate for territory. Is this a reason for saying</page><page sequence="7">Aggression: myth or model? 171 that man must also do so, precisely when he has that more comprehensive view of mutual tolerance and rights in a context which goes beyond might? Let animals settle their problems in their own simple way; it will never do for us—the bad will want more, and the good will prefer reasoned solutions or even sometimes relinquish just claim for fear of a greater evil. Territorial fights among animals work well and reasonably at their level. A dog which barks furiously at another is not ridiculous. Moreover, he soon gives up and is often friends again on neutral ground. Humans who claim the right and necessity of aggression will not know when to stop. There is no guarantee that they will not fight over the moon, unless they simply resolve not to, against whatever fury boils inside them. All this is human common sense, as animal threat is animal common sense. It helps moreover to remove the mystification imported into ethology, fascinating enough without fictitious problems. The animal knows what is good for him and does it to the best of his lights. So could we, according to the better light of fuller reason and fuller knowledge. The animal is directly aware of his own simple needs. For him therefore a precise territory must be fought for, or at least demonstrated for; he cannot negotiate a rental or an exchange, and he avoids the risk of an unsatisfied, uprooted existence by demonstrating, fighting or dying. Though we humans may do better we may still admire! But let us not think that territoriality is some evolutionary accident that accidentally stimulates pugnacity. Territory is defended with pugnacity by animals because it is worth defending, not because pugnacity has found a releaser. Hence it is an empty puzzlement to say to oneself, as Ardrey does: "Why the possession of territory should be the source of extra energy in the proprietor is a mystery" [7], Ardrey has in the very same paragraph given himself, and then rejected, the beginning of an answer: "confi dence in the familiar, fear of the strange". He rejects this because not all animal territories are large enough to be more familiar to the owner and more strange to the outsider. But this is to be misled by size. The animal's territory may be limited by his practical ability to occupy it, but its features are not merely spatial or even limited to its physical frontiers. In a real sense his territory may extend visually far beyond his physical reach, through the space above the territory of another animal. And even within his physical frontier there may well be familiarities for him which remain unknowns or threats for the stranger. I do not expect to specify all these, but I can think immediately of the odour which the possessor may already have imparted to his lair, and also the more imponderable fact that priority in time constitutes a prima facie and legitimate advantage. The necessity of seeking a new home will not recommend itself to the creature in possession; once is enough if possible. At the same time the newcomer may be in a more tentative mood, not from some mysterious lack of reinforcement, but just because there may still be unoccupied sites not far off. Moreover he may have some awareness of the desperation of the animal in occupation; if he insists, the defender may be obliged to bite! Therefore, though the intruder may think an exploratory incursion worth trying, he will generally soon settle for some alternative. There might even be some sense of rough justice, but I venture no further for fear of the imputation of anthropomorphic thinking. At any rate, I see no evolutionary mystery here, content to think that for the animal there is little distinction between me and mine, so that the possessor has a distinctly greater presence (self plus territory) than the intruder. But again, although this may generally work for animals it patently does not work safely for men. For with us greed can be measureless, and external aggressors can enlarge themselves monstrously with armies</page><page sequence="8">172 A. van Eyken and arms. It may in the long run be a miscalculation to attack a small enemy on his territory, but short-term advantage may be long enough for a bully nation and too long for the victim. How is this to be checked except by uncompromising rejection of aggression? Even on the humbler scale this is important, as every homeowner knows who has been beaten over the head by a burglar. But it is Ardrey who provides us with the reductio ad absurdum of his own particular standpoint on aggression. First, however, it must be clear that he holds essentially the same view of aggression as Konrad Lorenz, and he too fails to realize the moral distinction which I have already made. He says: "Aggression, then, places emphasis on primary, unprovoked impulse" He continues: "When Lorenz writes of aggression, he considers the innate (unprovoked) drive to dominate" [8]. What is this, in its context, but a meaningless recourse to an impulse (from within or without)? Ardrey is not meaning morally unprovoked and so he is really reduced to the 'concept' of an impulse without any kind of cause at all! Moreover he enlarges this already shapeless impulse to all-inclusive proportions. He writes: "We seek self-fulfilment. Within the limits and the directions of our individual genetic endowment we seek such a state of satisfaction as will inform us why we were born. We have no true choice. The force that presses on us is as large as all vital processes, and were it not so, then life would return to the swamp. If there is hope for man it is because we are animal. 11 This is the aggressiveness that many would deny. It is the inborn force that stimulates the hickory tree, searching for the sun, to rise above its fellows... It is the force, brooking no contradiction, directing the elephant calf to grow up, the baby starfish to grow out, the infant mamba to grow long" (italics mine) [9]. Now if this is the case then really aggression is the one fundamental explanatory phenomenon for all life, not merely one impulse (fictitious as it must already appear) among many others. But we are entitled to ask why this 'aggression' should ever need soothing by any kind of ethological, psychological or biological wisdom. One of the chief purposes, if not in fact the chief purpose, of such books as those which I have quoted is to show us ways of assuaging our aggressive urges, but if every bit of behaviour is by definition aggressive, how can we find a substitute for it? Or why would we need to do so? Pseudo Cures The real answer is of course once again that when aggression is glibly invoked it changes in meaning like those pictorial novelties which are altered completely by a slight variation of plane. What we all really want is a reduction (ideally an elimination) of aggression properly so-called, and indeed the examples of behaviour which are generally presented to us as requiring elimination are mainly such. Unfortunately the proposed cures are themselves misconceived. Lorenz, for example, suggests, "smashing a not too expensive object with as resounding a crash as the occasion merits" [10], This may be a fairly (though not entirely) innocuous expedient, but it does not really work, although Lorenz with undoubtable hyperbole suggests that it has, on occasion, prevented a man from killing his friend! There are still more questionable expedients such as the Japanese ploy of making available to the workers suitable dummy figures of the management which they may knock about. Again this may seem innocent but I think it fosters a false and ineffective procedure and, for full measure, diverts the</page><page sequence="9">Aggression: myth or model? 173 attention from considering truly appropriate resolves never to condone injustice. In popular literature one may read how an irate husband may spare his wife a beating by substituting some vigorous spade-work in the garden. Neither statistics nor common sense supports it; an angry man may well display his spleen with a spade or a shoe thrown against the wall, but there is no evidence that without such a demonstration he would otherwise have done something worse. Remember the wolf1. Even Mary Midgley, whose book, Beast and Man, does so much to adjust the balance, seems to be misled. She says: "When they [animals] thirst for blood and cannot catch their enemy, they work it (italics mine), by mock attacks on empty air or pieces of wood or the surrounding scenery, or by making noises, or by driving off neighbours or casual passers-by whom they do not usually hurt. This is called redirection. Alternatively they turn vigorously to some apparently irrelevant activity; this is called displacement. It is very clear that without these devices most living creatures would long ago have pined away or burst from disappointment" [11]. But surely it is not clear, it is surmise fostered by a favourite convention both of literature and of folk psychology. It is pure assumption if by working off we mean removing some urge which would otherwise have found a more direct manifestation. These so-called workings-off unquestionably occur, but they have no inhibitory effect, setting aside of course their efficacy simply as signals. Slamming the door will no wit alleviate a man's rage (which would normally disperse anyway) but of course it may tell his wife how he feels! Similarly, if a bull paws up the turf when he cannot reach you through a hedge, he is not necessarily working it off, he is giving you a meaningful and appropriate message. I think that the whole question of aggression is confused by semi-jargon, such as 'redirected activity', 'appeasement gestures' and 'displacement'. Lorenz tells us that behaviour motivated by aggression may be turned into a means of appeasement and even into a love ceremony. Then he says, "This means neither more nor less than converting the mutually repelling effect into its opposite" [12]. But here non jargoniferous care is called for. When a smile is used to denote friendship we should realize that this is not a hostility turned into its opposite, notwithstanding that there are obvious analogies between it and a scowl or a baring of the teeth; it is rather an alternative for a scowl! This is not merely a hair-splitting word-game, for I wish to indicate that there is no hostility concealed in the smile any more than we can say that when a doctor reassures a child by some such remark as, "I shall not hurt you", there is a threat to hurt converted into its opposite. If the negative had not been there it would have been a threat, but the negative is there and so there is no suspicion of an incipient threat or a threat converted. The simplest way to show your friendship or regard for another on first encounter, and later, is precisely to say something like the doctor's remark, although not necessarily in so many words, or even words at all. A soldier may present arms, men may smile (this being unmistakably a negation of a scowl by means of significant modifications), and other animals may perform their own specific signals; these are almost inevitably related to hostile signals but how else may an individual indicate that he does not wish to hurt, other than by conveying a negation of hurtfulness? Later he may perform acts of benevolence, but in the first instance a kind of smile is most appropriate. Normally humans will not misunderstand it although when we observe animals we may fail to note the subtleties which for them convey negation; then once again there is the danger of reading into their behaviour a paradoxical idea that they are at one and the same time expressing and almost reluctantly suppressing an urge to attack; thus Lorenz comes to say: "There is no love</page><page sequence="10">174 A. van Eyken without aggression". There was and is in Jesus—unless perchance 'Love your enemies' only means, 'Express your hate in a displacement activity'! I am not suggesting that men are not aggressive, merely that they do not need to be, either directly or indirectly. Common experience of other people and of ourselves suggests that aggression will continue to be part of the human scene, but at least it is not a genetic necessity. It is in us by human default, and no amount of sociobiological engineering will eliminate it automatically. Crowded men (like rats) may fight (though it is more meaningful to explain this by the simple fact that they are then more likely to tread on toes, rather than to say that they are then triggered into hostility by proximity). However, dispersal will not automatically bring peace. Some ethologists have blamed dispersal as well as overcrowding, and said that we even need to invent strangers so as to have somebody to hate! Enthusiasts for genetic aggression would sharply distinguish themselves from the behaviourists, denying the claims of the latter that suitable sociological and psychologi cal manipulation would eliminate aggression. Whereas the one group insists that inborn aggression (always vaguely conceived) requires diminution to approximate zero by redirections and substitutions which are not always beyond suspicion, the other insists that, as aggression is only induced by society and circumstance, we have but to change these to make it disappear completely. But this difference is a little elusive. Society and circumstance will always at times present us with frustrations, so that unless we bring into action our own moral striving against alleged compulsions, from within or from without, neither the ethologist nor the behaviourist can help us. I will not elaborate an argument against mindless behavourism, but suffice it to say that it, together with much aggression ethology, really excludes comprehension and reason from the natural endowment of either man or beast. Both systems regard us as equipped with urges which we humans cannot really explain except as being acciden tally advantageous in the sequence of the centuries, and which reason, as an intrusion on the natural scene from some nebulous elsewhere, must manipulate either (a) by redirection or (b) by reinforcement and aversive control. Never does the urge itself seem to contain any reasonableness or any appropriateness within itself. The most extreme view of genetic aggression leads us to Desmond Morris's 'Ten principles of dominance' [13], and the most extreme view of behaviouristic social engineering leads us to B. F. Skinner's Beyond Freedom and Dignity [14]. My strictures on the imprecise uses of aggression are really motivated by a suspicion that they lead to cynicism, not of course in Lorenz himself or in Ardrey, but in the general outlook of our society, so that we do not set our sights as high as we otherwise might. Possibly the influence trickles down along elusive channels (perhaps television), to hooligans and muggers who never read but somehow complete the logic. In between stand all the rest of us who take it for granted that we are fundamentally selfish and cannot help but thrust ourselves upon the world. Desmond Morris says: "In any organized group of mammals, no matter how co operative, there is always a struggle for social dominance" [15]. He then lists his ten commandments, of which it will suffice to quote the first four: (1) You must clearly display the trappings, postures and gestures of domi nance. (2) In moments of active rivalry you must threaten your subordinate aggressively. (3) In moments of physical challenge you (or your delegates) must be able forcibly to overpower your subordinates.</page><page sequence="11">Aggression: myth or model? 175 (4) If a challenge involes brain rather than brawn you must be able to outwit your subordinate. Such claims as these have been given a disproportionate currency in the general thought and philosophy of our western world, so that, not only is aggression in its central significance too readily accepted as a necessary part of human genetic equipment, but it is also taken for granted that the mainspring of all living activity must be egoistic (i.e. a fundamentally, though less spectactularly, aggressive). We have already seen it really in Robert Ardrey's claim. Some sociobiologists have even produced a definition of altruism tantamount to making it a deceptive variant of aggression! Perhaps, however, by this point the reader will agree that we must beware of such rash departures from common understanding. We have therefore no genetic need to bestow on ourselves opportunities for aggressiveness to compensate us for the frustra tions of protracted peace! But we humans have little or no hope of escape if we accompany the aggression popularizers, of whom another exponent is Professor E. O. Wilson, his examples, as in the case of so many others, being largely drawn from the world of physical violence. In his book, On Human Nature, he writes, "Are humans innately aggressive?... The answer is yes Only by redefining the words 'innateness' and 'aggression' to the point of uselessness might we correctly say that human aggression is not innate" [16]. The reader may be reminded of my very first opening paragraph, for Wilson, rather than be precise, chooses neither to define nor to redefine, although innate is yet another word which may be almost as elastic as caprice. He is thus inevitably vague as to the interplay of such genes and environmental factors as contribute to the particular forms of aggression observed in various human societies. Moreover he treats human responses to danger or difficulties of situation, not as perfectly intelligible processes, but rather as mysteries only recently realized and explained by sociobiology. Thus the Western Shoshoni (North America) do not as readily resent intruders on their home range as the Owens Valley Paiute do. This realization is attributed to the recent study of animal ecology, and yet the ordinary non-expert surely realizes how natural, according to simple reason, this difference is—the Shoshoni, being hunters, do not so regularly live on or need a home range, and the Paiute do! Wilson concludes: "To recapitulate the total argument, human aggression cannot be explained as a dark-angelic flaw or a bestial instinct. [Why then the insistence on its innateness or the frequent illustrations in the realm of violence?] Nor is it the pathological symptom of upbringing in a cruel environment. Human beings are strongly predisposed to respond with unreasoning hatred to external threats and to escalate their hostility sufficiently to overwhelm the source of the threat by a respectably wide margin of safety. Our brains do appear to be programmed to the following extent: we are inclined to partition other people into friends and aliens, in the same sense that birds are inclined to learn territorial songs and to navigate by the polar constellations. We tend to fear deeply the actions of strangers and to solve conflict by aggression" [17]. Of course we are inclined to fear strangers and to solve conflict by aggression, but these are hardly analogies with bird-song or migration; they are an intelligible comprehension of situation even though sometimes carried to the extent of injustice, whereas the two cases of bird behaviour are stereotyped responses still not understood by us. No doubt our genetic make-up is involved in all our behaviour, but there is no special help in insisting that aggression is innate.
