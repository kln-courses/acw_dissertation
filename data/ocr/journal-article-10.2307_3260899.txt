I A, (CA 94709 HE quarter century since the publication of Willi Marxsen's Der Evangelist Markus has witnessed a proliferation of studies on the theology of Mark, once considered the least theological of the NT writings.1 Major motifs of the gospel such as christology, eschatology, discipleship, and the meaning of the cross have been examined, both as independent themes and in mutual interrelationship.2 From the theology of the text, studies have moved to examine the social and community factors which lie behind the text and often aspects of Mark's theology are seen in conflict with each other.3 Debates range over the purpose of Mark's theological project whether the work serves to bolster the faith of a community shaken by the horrors of the Jewish war of A.D. 66-70 or to counter the misinterpretation of these events which issued in renewed apocalyptic speculation about the return of Jesus in consequence of these events.4 It would be consoling to say that the time has arrived to declare a consensus on the major issues of Mark's theology and to attempt a synthesis of this consensus.

Rather than assay a consensus, the present essay may even add to the mix by calling attention to a neglected factor in Mark's theology. In a short but significant essay published in 1975, Nils Dahl called attention to "The Neglected Factor in New Testament Theology."5 The neglected factor is "any comprehensive or penetrating study of the theme 'God in the New Testament.'"6 Dahl notes that few articles in journals or Festschriften are devoted to this theme and underscores this neglect among major NT theologians such as Bultmann and Cullmann.7 He also calls atten- tion to the many causes of this neglect: christocentrism in theology since Ritschl, suspicion of metaphysical language, an emphasis on the "specifically Christian" elements in the NT, with the corresponding view that the concept of God in the Old Testament, as interpreted by late Judaism, is taken for granted, along with a great diversity in the NT itself in language about God. While recognizing the theological problems inherent in objectifying God and in language about God, Dahl calls for renewed attention to this neglected factor with the caution that: "Any representation of New Testa- ment Theology has to take account both of the unity and of the variety, whether the order of presentation is thematic or treats the individual writings."8 What Dahl says of the NT as a whole would readily be confirmed by a survey of writings on Mark. The present essay represents an attempt to address this neglect by turning to Mark's the-ology in the strict sense and asks whether there is a distinct understanding of God in the gospel. This project is undertaken with the caution that a gospel which begins as "the good news of Jesus Christ, Son of God" is manifestly christolological and that a focus on the question of God can 5 Reflection (Yale Divinity School) 73 (1975) 5-8.

A more recent collection of essays, La Notion biblique de Dieu (BETL 41; ed. J. Coppens; Gembloux: J. Duculot; Leuven: University, 1976), contains no essay on the synop- tics. Two students of Dahl have addressed this "neglect": J. Bassler, Divine Impartiality: Paul and( a Theological Axiom (SBLDS 59; Chico: Scholars, 1981) and H. Moxnes, Theology in Conflict: Studies in Paul's Understanding of God in Romans (NovTSup 53; Leiden: Brill, 1980).

However this latter question has so dominated the discussion that such a bracketing is necessary. We will attempt an initial survey of God language in Mark, then turn our attention to three pericopes in chapter 12 which, for rea- sons to be indicated later, provide a hermeneutical key to Mark's understand- ing of God and then suggest some implications of this understanding for other aspects of Mark's theology, mainly christology and discipleship. The text of Mark contains the term theos forty-eight times. There are fourteen kingdom of God sayings of which thirteen are on the lips of Jesus, and five appellations of the phrase Son of God, of which three are on the lips of demons, one is in the superscription and one is in the final reference by the centurion.9 Apart from the kingdom sayings Jesus speaks of God directly seventeen times and theos is explicitly used in seven OT citations on the lips of Jesus while in two citations God is the presumed speaker without being explicitly mentioned (7:6 = Isa 29:13; 11:17 = Isa 56:7).10 There are five other usages of theos, two by the narrator (1:14, 2:12) and three by others in the gospel.11 There are sixteen usages of kyrios in the gospel of which six are citations by Jesus of the OT and two by the narrator.12 In 13:20 Jesus refers to God explicitly as kyrios and there are three other references which are ambiguous allowing a translation as "lord" or "master" but suggesting the presence of the Lord (5:19; 12:9; 13:35). In 12:37 Jesus refers to ho Christos (12:35) as David's lord. In two places Jesus refers to himself as kyrios (2:28; 11:3) and he is addressed as such (7:28) by the Syrophoenician woman.13 Four times in Mark Jesus refers to God as father !)

Uses in OT citations: 12:23, 3 times citing Exod 3:2; 12:30, citing Josh 22:5; 15:34 (= Ps 22:1), the cry of dereliction. The citation of Zech 13:7 as it appears in Mark 14:27 makes God into the agent of the passion (see n. 83, below). 11 2:7, scribes say "Who can forgive sins but God?"; 5:7, demoniac invokes God in an oath; 12:14, scribes say that Jesus teaches the way of God. 12 kyrios in explicit OT citations: 12:11 = Ps 118:23; 12:29-30 (3 times) = Deut 6:4-5; 12:36 (twice) = Ps 110:1; by the narrator citing the OT, 1:3 = Isa 40:3; 11:9 = Ps 118:36. :1 On the problems surrounding kyrios as an ascription to God and a title of Jesus, see F.

Finally, passive verbs suggest divine agency either as the "theological passive" or more generally, as in the effecting of a miracle.15 Of themselves these statistics and citations serve mainly to give an overview and general impression of the texts. As one would expect, most references to God are on the lips of Jesus. Jesus speaks of God as the creator of the world and the human family (13:19; 10:6), who will bring human history to a close (13:20) and who prepares a place for the elect (13:20, 27; cf. 10:40). God has power to do what is beyond human conception (10:27); is alone good (10:18); issues commands and has a will which is to be followed (3:35; 7:8); is to be addressed as father in prayer (11:25; 14:36); and is the living God of Abraham, Issac and Jacob (12:27). The observation that there is nothing distinctively new or Christian in this picture of God in respect to the OT or Jewish thought of the time may be true. What is significant, however, is that in Mark, Jesus speaks of God without attributes or ascrip- tions. With the exception of 11:25 (ho en tois ouranois), derivatively in 12:27, theos zonton, and 9:37, ton aposteilanta me, theos stands without attributes or ascription, a fact which makes Mark almost singular in the NT.16 Aramaic Essays (SBLMS 25; Missoula: Scholars, 1979) 115-42. Fitzmyer (138, n. 42) claims that kyrios in Mark 5:19 and 13:20 is a name for Yahweh. 14 See R. Marcus, "Divine Names and Attributes in Hellenistic Jewish Literature," Proceed- ings of the American Academy of Jewish Research, 1931-32 (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America, 1932) 43-120, dynamis and cognates, 66-68. 15 Zerwick defines the theological passive as "the passive used in order to avoid directly naming God as agent" and cites Mark 2:5 as an example, Biblical Greek (Rome: Pontifical Biblical Institute, 1963) 76. BDF # 130,1 lists Mark 4:24-25 as such a passive. Matthew's altera- tion of Mark 10:40 hetoimastai to hetoimastai hypo tou patros mou (Matt 20:23) indicates that Mark 10:40 is also a theological passive. Examples of passive verbs which suggest such divine action are (MS = miracle story): 1:15; 1:42 (MS); 2:5 (MS); 2:20, 27; 3:5 (MS); 3:28; 4:11-12; 4:24-25; 5:29 (MS); 6:2, 14, 16, 53, 56 (MS); 7:34 (MS); 8:12; 9:2, 31, 47; 10:33, 40; 12:10 (= Ps 118:22-23); 13:11, 13; 14:27-28; 16:6. (i theos zontbn, strictly speaking, is not an ascription. However this is the only use of the substantive of zao in Mark and the construction suggests not only the God of the living, but also the livinig God. See Zerwick (Biblical Greek, 14-15) on the "Hebrew genitive." M. McNamara, (Targum and Testament [Grand Rapids: Eerdmans, 1972] 123) finds the biblical conception of the living God behind this verse of Mark. See also H.-J.

Herzog; Nashville: Abingdon, 566</page><page sequence="5">DONAHUE: THEOLOGY OF MARK Such reserved speech about God is strong especially in contrast to the anthropomorphism of Matthew and the interventionist or salvation history perspective of Luke. Though Matthew uses the surrogate "the heavens" in Mark's kingdom sayings, in his own use of Father (forty-four times) he presents a much more "human" and immediate picture of God. God is primarily the Father in heaven, but is to be addressed with confidence in prayer by the disciples (5:45; 6:5-13; 26:41). This Father in heaven knows how to give good things to those who ask (7:11); sees what is done in secret (6:18); cares for the birds of the air (6:26; 10:29); wills that not one of the little ones should perish (18:14); reveals to Peter what flesh and blood can not reveal (16:17); and ratifies the decisions of the community (16:19; 18:16). Only in Matthew are disciples urged to "be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect" (5:48) and only in Matthew are disciples called to be huioi tou patros hymon (5:45, cf. 5:9). While thus emphasizing the nearness of God to human life, Matthew, in taking over the Q material and in parables from his own tradition, stresses that this same Father will be judge at the end time of that kind of life which is commanded for people on earth; that is, Matthew explicitly unites an understanding of God to ethics and eschatology.17 Luke uses theos 122 times, but in contrast to Matthew speaks of God as father only 17 times. The distinctiveness of his naming of God appears in the Infancy Narratives. The gospel begins with a picture of Zachary and Elizabeth "righteous before God" (1:6), prior to the intervention of the angel of the Lord in their lives (1:11)-a pattern which characterizes the appear- ance to Mary. The initial appearance to Mary sets the theological and christological tone of the gospel "he will be great and be called the Son of the Most High" (1:32), "and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God" (1:35). The hymns of the Infancy Narratives, the Magnificat (1:46-55), and the Benedictus (1:68-79) are virtual summaries of OT salvation history. Certain differences from both Matthew and Mark characterize Luke's lan- guage about God. Where Matthew writes "be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" (5:48), Luke writes, "be merciful as your heavenly Father is merciful" (6:36). The Lukan parables, especially the Good Samaritan with its stated application that the neighbor is the one who shows mercy (10:37), and the parables of finding in Luke chapter 15 stress the role of Jesus as proclaimer of God's mercy. In handing on the Marcan miracles and in the concluding verses to certain of his own miracles Luke stresses an aspect of God, found in Mark and Matthew, but not with the same emphasis.

This characterizes the announce- ment of the birth of the Christ who is savior and Lord (2:14, 19-20). The healing of the paralytic (5:25-26, the sole reference to giving glory in Luke's Marcan source, 2:12), the raising of the son of the widow of Nain (7:16), the healing of the woman sick 18 years (13:13), the cleansing of the leper (17:15) and the healing of the blind man at Jericho (18:43)-all occasion giving glory to God. In Luke the reaction of the centurion to the death of Jesus is not a christological confession as in Mark (15:39), but "he praised (edoxazen) God" (23:47). Luke's whole portrayal of God, thus, takes its impetus from the hymns of the Infancy Narrative. God is the Most High who enters human history to show his mercy and to call for a response of praise and glory. The gospel ends with the disciples in the temple "praising God" (24:53), so that from beginning to end it has a liturgical tone. While it is beyond the scope of the present essay to attempt the kind of examination of other parts of the NT, which Dahl calls for, a brief look at certain Pauline usages helps to put Mark in perspective. Though Mark and Paul use the term gospel of God (Mark 1:15; Rom 1:1; 15:16; 1 Thess 2:8-9), their respective language about God is significantly different, a difference not explained simply by Paul's post-resurrectional perspective. Also one major by- product of the rich debate on the meaning of "the righteousness of God" has served to underscore the theocentric character of Paul's theology.18 In Paul, God is a God of love (Rom 5:5; 2 Cor 13:11) and of mercy (Rom 12:1; 2 Cor 1:3; Phil 2:27), and shows kindness and forebearance (Rom 2:4; 3:26). Even when not using specifically Christian language of God's saving event in Christ, Paul refers often to the activity of God. God is the creator (Rom 1:25) who makes light shine out of darkness (2 Cor 4:6); at the end of history all creation will be subject to God (1 Cor 15:27-28). The pagan nations are judged because they did not know God in creation (Rom 1:18-32) and this universalism characterizes the final judgment when God will render to Jew and Gentile alike according to their works (Rom 2:5-10), and in the present time God "in everything works for those who love him who are called according to his purpose" (Rom 8:28). The initiative in election is due to God who chooses a people "to be conformed to the image of his son" (Rom 8:29), and God does not go back on the promises to Israel and can again graft them to the vine (Rom 11:23). Though in his exhortations to the community Paul urges his hearers to have the mind of Christ (Phil 2:5) and to put on Christ (Gal 3:27), portions of his parenesis are without specific christological intent. At the beginning of Romans 12 the community is urged to offer their bodies as a living sacrifice pleasing to God to do the will of God, and to act according to the measure of faith given by God (Rom 12:1-3) and in 2 Cor 9:6-15 the lS Literature cited in M.

Despite the familiar way in which Paul speaks of God, he stands in awe before the unsearchable judgments and inscrutable ways of God (Rom 11:33) and sees God's plan as a secret and hidden wisdom "which God decreed before the ages for our glorification" (1 Cor 2:7). Even such a cursory survey shows the marked contrast between Paul's and Mark's ways of speaking about God. Such a survey could be extended to the intertestamental literature and even a rapid glance at the 11 columns of references to God in the Index to Charles' Pseudepigrapha would underscore the sober and reserved way Mark speaks of God. Among the intertestamental literature the works which come closest to Mark's usage are 4 Maccabees and the Wisdom of Solomon, both of which exhibit, according to Bousset, that tendency of Hellenistic Judaism to move away from anthropomorphism and to stress the transcendence of God.19 Nor does Mark have a strong emphasis on God as active in the saving events of Israel's history, with the reference to the covenant and the Passover in the supper narrative (14:12-26) providing the major exception. Moses is primarily a lawgiver in Mark (1:44; 7:10; 10:3, 4; 12:19, 26), and the core of discipleship is doing the will of God (3:35), rather than responding to God as present in the "little ones" (Matthew, esp. 25:31-46) or in the neighbor (Luke 10:37). The transcendence of God is stressed also in Mark's relation of the kingdom to the ministry of Jesus. While the kingdom is imminent (engiken) in Jesus' proclamation (1:15), Mark has nothing like the Q interpretation of the miracles that "the kingdom of God has come upon you" (Luke 11:20 = Matt 12:28), or the Lucan statement that the kingdom is in the midst of the hearers (17:21). The final words of Jesus, "My God, My God why have you forsaken me," (15:34) stress the absence of God in the mystery of the cross, and the conclusion of the gospel itself, "they were afraid" (16:8), reinforces the numinous awe with which one should respond even to the resurrection proclamation. The comparison of Mark, the other synoptics and Paul underscores the singularity of language about God in Mark. While Mark is closest to Paul in affirming the transcendence and mystery of God, his language is not as rich and nuanced as that of Paul. At this point a methodological problem arises which cautions against further conclusions. One cannot argue simply from silence that because an evangelist does not contain certain expressions or conceptions, he explicitly rejects them. One must ask the further question of whether the language about God in Mark has a definite function and how it coheres with other aspects of his theology. While many points of entry suggest themselves as a way of addressing this question, for example, a fresh 19 W.

In 11:1 almost in chiastic fashion the evangelist indicates the beginning and end of this ministry, "Jerusalem ... Mount of Olives." Though the section is made up of traditions of different provenance, they are integrated by the author into a thematic and literary unity with clear sections and subsections.22 Chapters 11-12 describe the public teaching of Jesus, while chapter 13 is a private discourse to his disci- ples. Throughout the whole section goes the thread of mounting opposition to Jesus at Jerusalem, which the readers know clearly from 8:31 will be the locale of suffering and death. At the same time while Jerusalem is rejecting him, Jesus is also rejecting Jerusalem. The temple cult yields to the house of prayer for all nations; the vineyard will be given to others and temple and city itself will be destroyed.23 Within chapters 11-12 there is a major subdivision at 12:12.24 The vocal opposition to Jesus which has been mounting since 11:18 reaches its culmina- tion in the parable of the tenants (12:1-12). By his redactional addition of 12:6 the author lets the readers know that the real issue is the rejection of 20 N. 18, supra. For example does kingdom of God have the nuance of the power which God possesses by which he can be called king or does it mean the active exercise of that power on earth? Conversely the kind of analysis given by Perrin (Jesus and the Language of the King- dom [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1976] 15-31) of kingdom as a "tensive symbol" could well be applied to the discussion of dikaiosyne theou. 21 The references to the teaching of Jesus in 11:17-18, in close connection with criticism of the temple cult, 11:17b and 12:41-44 provide a virtual inclusio for the whole section and help to carry through the motif of Jesus the one who teaches with power (cf. 1:27 didache kaine kat' exousian). Mark 12:13-34 is thus put under this larger aegis. Theos is used 13 times in 21 verses, the most intense concentration in the gospel. 22 1.

The questioners in 12:13 are a different group last seen at 3:6 and the exact locale of the next three pericopes is unspecified, so the author must indicate in 12:35 that Jesus was teaching "in the temple," a return to the setting of 11:15, 27.26 In the section 11:1-12:12 there is also thematic unity. In general terms the issue could be called that of messianic authority, i.e. concerned with person and role of Jesus.27 The tone of the debates is hostile and Jesus' answers are enigmatic or parabolic (11:17, 33; 12:1-11). The three pericopes of 12:13-34 are more directly theological. They are concerned with the nature and demands of the one God, and the explicit christological thrust recedes. In contrast to the first section where the authority of Jesus is questioned, his authority to interpret the Torah is implicitly recognized, and two of the three pericopes are clear Schulgespriiche rather than Streitgespriche. In 12:35-37 the issue again becomes messianic with the question about the Son of David. There are also literary and thematic considerations which suggest that the three pericopes themselves are to be read as a subunit. In her study of concentric patterns in Mark, Joanna Dewey has uncovered elements of a "ring composition" in this section.28 Both the first (12:13-17) and the third pericope (12:28-34) exhibit a similar structure of debate where a comment is added to the simple question-response structure. Though all three peri- copes contain the address to Jesus in the vocative didaskale (12:14, 19, 32), only the first and third mention that Jesus speaks ep' aletheias and they both contain complimentary addresses to Jesus (12:12, 32). While the first and third pericopes are more "ethical" dealing with a way of acting consequent 25 12:6 huion agappton (cf. 1:11; 9:7) along with 12:11-12 make the parable explicitly into an allegory of the rejection of Jesus and betray a post-resurrectional perspective.

The questioners are schematized groups who, Lohmeyer notes, could just as easily appear in a synagogue in Galilee. Taylor (The Gospel According to St. Mark [London: Macmillan, 1966] 478) says that 12:13-17 may belong to the Galilean period, followed by Cook (Jewish Leaders, 42). 27 The question which dominates this section is over the origin of the exousia of Jesus, esp. 11:27-33. 28 J.

Finally, the structure of the subunit shows the clear Marcan characteristic of triadic narration in the form A B A'.29 Therefore 12:13-34 is a quasi-independent sub-unit, which, we will see, has a distinct provenance, but which has been placed here by the Evangelist. Paying Taxes to Caesar (12:13-17) The almost exhaustive discussion of this pericope has been concerned over exegesis of it as a bit of church-state parenesis possibly emanating from the historical Jesus and used by the early church to affirm its simultaneous disassociation from the Zealot movement and prudent obedience to the state.: 3 But there are indications that the major thrust here may be theologi- cal and christological with equal stress on the relation of Jesus to God as on the Christian to the state. The pericope begins with the stakes clearly drawn. The Pharisees and Herodians are trying to "catch" Jesus by what he says. Rather surprisingly, and perhaps with a touch of irony, there is an over- accumulation of complimentary terms applied to Jesus; he is addressed in the vocative of respect as "teacher" described as personally true, one who cares for no one, no respecter of persons and one who teaches the way of God in truth (12:14). Three of these attributes are rather surprising when applied to a human being, that Jesus is true used as an unmodified attribute (alethes ei),31 that he has care for no one and is no respecter of persons. The latter expression is applied in biblical writings normally to God.32 29) On triadic narration see Pesch, Markusevangelium, 2.15-19. Lohmeyer also favors triadic divisions in this section, Markus, 249.

The use of peirazein here is significant. In Mark the word group peirasmos/peirazein evokes the Old Testament usage of the testing of a human by God to see if one remains faithful to God.34 Jesus is led into the desert to be tempted (1:13); the Pharisees "test him" seeking a sign from heaven (8:11); the question about divorce whether Jesus will abrogate the law of Moses is a test (10:2) and in Gethsemane the way of the cross is seen as a testing (14:38). The counter question of Jesus here suggests that the issue is more serious than whether Jesus will come down on one side or the other of a controverted political debate, an interpretation which is more in accord with Luke's redaction of Mark (Luke 20:20) "so that they might deliver him up to the authority and jurisdiction of the governor." The question touches as much who Jesus is as what resolution he gives to the dilemma. The action of Jesus in asking for the coin, in pointing to the image and inscription and his aphoristic answer, "render to Caesar the things of Caesar, and to God the things of God" (12:17) has perhaps been as important (and controverted) as any saying from the Jesus tradition. Without entering into detailed discussion we can affirm that a consensus of opinion would deny that Jesus is sanctioning a complete separation of God from worldly rulers.35 Whether the things of God are the image of God in humanity or whether it embraces all reality, with the secular order implicitly included, exegetes would admit that Jesus is affirming the sovereignty of God over all spheres of life, an exegesis which would find echoes in Rom 13:1-13. In reaction to this rather enigmatic saying, there is the statement, "They were amazed at him." Such a reaction to Jesus is a distinct element of Mark's composition. It is a conclusion to the miracles of Jesus, a reaction to the teaching of Jesus, in narratives of divine epiphanies, a reaction of fright over the prediction of suffering, and characterizes even Jesus' opponents.36 Such reactions accom- pany the manifestation of God in Jesus and leave the reader with a sense of the numinous in face of this. God as no "respecter of persons" see Acts 10:34; Rom 2:11; Eph 6:9; Col 3:25; Jas 2:9. This language (and that of Mark 12:14, cf. Luke 18:2) suggests judicial impartiality and, in Acts and Romans, is used to undergird God's acceptance of the gentiles. :3 Explicit references to Jesus' knowledge of interior dispositions are found at 2:8; 8:16-17; 11:31; 12:15; 14:4; (cf. 3:22; 5:30; 10:41). :4 Seesman, "peira, ktl" TDNT 6 (1968) 23-36; cf.

See Donahue, "Jesus as the Parable of God in the Gospel of Mark," Int 32 (1978) 381. 573</page><page sequence="12">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Thus, these three elements of the pericope: (a) the description of Jesus by attributes normally evocative of divine impartiality, (b) the picture of the encounter as a testing of Jesus and (c) the reaction to his saying (12:17) in language usually characteristic of the manifestation of the power of God in miracle stories (cf. 2:12 and 5:20)-all suggest theological dimensions to the pericope more significant than a bit of church-state parenesis. The test to which Jesus will be put is how he will speak of God and in so speaking how he implicitly defines his own relationship to God. This relationship is dialect- ical. The attributes and the reaction of the crowd show clearly the presence of God in the teaching of Jesus. Yet this presence remains veiled. Jesus explicitly accepts none of these attributes and the reader must be engaged in learning how they are true of Jesus. In the miracle stories titles of dignity which are addressed to Jesus and then put under the messianic secret are paradoxically true, that is, they are understood in a sense different from that intended by the speaker in the gospel.37 So here, the reader knows that Jesus has those attributes with which the scribes address him, but knows they are true in a sense different from that of the speaker. These attributes remain hidden under the veil of the human Jesus and the nearness to God which Mark attributes to Jesus must be affirmed without compromising the sover- eignty of God. Jesus himself is, then, the prime example of one who renders "to God the things of God" (12:17). We can also assess the importance of 12:13-17 in relation to what pre- cedes and what follows. Most remotely the pericope takes us back to the inauguration of Jesus' ministry as one who teaches with authority (1:27 didache kaine kat' exousian) and has more immediate links with the debate on authority in 11:27-33. The unanswered question of 11:33 is now answered; Jesus speaks with the authority of God. The pericope also picks up motifs of the preceding Jerusalem ministry. In 11:17 Jesus relativized the temple as the privileged locale of God's presence and proclaimed a house of prayer for all nations (ethnesin, also "gentiles"). The vineyard which was under the care of Israel is to be given to others (12:9) and now even the gentile Caesar will have a role in God's plan. As R. Pesch notes, here Jesus affirms the sovereignty of God without adopting the theocratic or sectarian implications of that sovereignty.38 The pericope comes also at a strategic moment when Jesus will offer a vision of God and of discipleship which has implications for the mission of the church.39 In the two following pericopes, as we will see, Jesus presents an understanding of God (the God of the living, 12:27) and of obedience to his will (the dual command) in a way 37 E.g. 3:11; 5:7.

In the final speech of his Jerusalem ministry on the Mount of Olives where this ministry began Jesus will say that the mission of the church prior to his return is to proclaim the gospel to the gentiles (13:10). The Question About the Resurrection (12:18-27) The question of the resurrection provides the centerpiece of Mark's theistic creed. As R. Pesch notes, the pericope is particularly ort- und zeitlos and owes its present location to the author.40 In the pericope itself there is evidence of Marcan reworking of an earlier bit of traditional material. The introduction with a schematized arrival of questioners in the historic present and the tautologous use of eperoton with legontes is characteristic of Marcan pericope introductions.41 The description of the Sadducees who "deny there is a resurrection" helps to clarify the issue since their stated objection is not directed at the possibility of resurrection as much as it is a parody of a rather materialistic conception of resurrection.42 The substance of the tradition comprises vv 19-25 where Jesus' answer to the Sadducean position affirms that marriage as we know it is an institution of the present age and that in the new age the risen will be "like the angels in heaven," both conceptions familiar to contemporary Jewish apocalyptic.43 The relation of vv 26-27 to the older tradition is less clear. The use of planasthe and its repetition by poly planasthe in v 27 betrays the familiar Marcan technique of tautologous repetition to underscore the insertion of material which may either be of different origin or convey a different thrust from the surrounding material.44 The use of Exod 3:6 as a proof text for the 4() Pesch, Markusevangelium, 2. 229. 41 (Cf. 5:9; 8:27; 9:11; 12:18; 14:60; on historic present see J. Hawkins, Horae Synopticae (Grand Rapids: Baker Book House, 1968); on pericope introductions, K. Grobel, "Idiosyncrasies of the Synoptists in Their Pericope-Introductions," JBL 59 (1940) 405-10. 42 According to Acts 23:8 the Sadducees say there is no resurrection, angels or spirits. Josephus, JW 2.8.14 ?165 says that the Sadducees do not believe in the persistence of the soul after death (psyches diamonen); Billerbeck (Str-B, 1.888) calls the statement "eine Frucht sadduzaischen Spottes." The example he gives of a similar objection is by the gentiles of Alexan- dria, and no contemporary Rabbinic text affirms resumption of married life at the resurrection. Therefore, we may have here not a pre-Easter debate with Sadducees, but an answer to prob- lems with the Christian proclamation of the bodily resurrection shared by both Christians and non-Christians (cf. Acts 17:32; 1 Cor 15:35-50). Nineham (St. Mark, 321) says this passage "will have been of the greatest significance in suggesting a spiritual view of the resurrection, free from crudely materialistic traits." 43 The answer of Jesus addressed two implicit questions: will there be a resurrection and what will it be like? "Like the angels in heaven" conveys the eschatological thrust of the saying since the angels participate in the inauguration of the new age, Mark 8:38; 13:26; also 1 Enoch 51:4; 2 Apoc.

In v 25 the dead "rise up from the dead," (anastosin) while in v 26 they are raised up (egeirontai).46 The view of resurrection is also different from that of one of the earliest testimonies to the resurrection 1 Cor 15:35-41 since in Mark there is virtually no hint of the resurrection and/or transformation of the body, but rather a way of speaking closer to a doctrine of immortality. We would suggest that the evangelist joins vv 26-27 to an earlier scholastic debate which affirmed the church's defense against often crass Sadducean objections to the resurrection. In so doing he constructs an ascending response of Jesus; the Sadducees misunderstand scripture and the power of God; the condition of the risen transcends materialistic conceptions; they are raised up by the power of God and God is a God of the living not of the dead. In constructing this answer Mark brackets the final section of the tradition and his own addition with the reference to the Sadducees as not simply being in error, but being deceivers to underscore the gravity of their misunderstanding of both scripture and the power of God.47 Mark's understanding of resurrection here should be seen in relation to perspectives on life after death in other parts of the gospel. In 6:14-16, a passage fraught with textual and interpretive problems, Mark records the reaction of Herod and his court to the miracles of Jesus.48 The opinions 4, J. W ellhausen, Das Evangelium Marci (Berlin: George Reimer, 1909) 95: From the founda- tion that God was a God of the living, the OT concluded that the dead were separated from (od, citing Ps 6:5, also Nineham, St. Mark, 322. The idea of the continued existence of the patriarchs is attested: Luke 16:19-31; T. Benj. 10:6; T. Isaac 1:4; and especially 4 Macc 7:19 (the martyrs do not die but live unto God as our patriarchs Abraham, Isaac and Jacob did not die); 16:25 (they themselves knowing well that men dying for God live unto God, as live Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.) Given the strong Hellenistic flavor of 4 Maccabees this view of resurrection in Mark 12:26 suggests such a setting. 46 \Mark uses egeirein of Jesus' resurrection in 16:6, of John's purported resurrection in 6:14- 16 and of people after healing (1:31; 2:9-12; 3:3; 5:41; 9:27; 10:49). He uses anastanai in 8:31; 9:9; 9:31; 10:34 of Jesus. For an excellent discussion of the background and nuances of these terms see C. F. Evans, Resurrection and the New Testament (SBT 2/12; London: SCM, 1970) 20-31. egeirein in the passive suggests divine agency and is used in the earliest resurrection formulael (1 Cor 15:4; Rom 4:25, cf. Acts 3:15; 4:10). 47 planan in 13:5, 6 characterizes the actions of the eschatological deceivers who claim to re- present Jesus. On the term see Braun, "planao ktl." TDNT 6 (1968) esp. 241-44. 4S If the plural elegon is read with B, W and some Western \iss, the opinions proffered in 141)-15 are those of Herod's court. If the singular is read with X, A and the majority of the \iss lHerod alone states that John is Jesus redivivus (cf. 6:16). See B. Metzger, A Textual Commen- tary on the Greek New Testament (London/Nes York: United Bible Society, 1971) 89. Also confusing is what Herod hears in 6:14. Most immediately it seems to be the mission of the tsselve, 6:6b-13, but the reference to "the name being known to him," as xwell as the issue involved, suggests that he heard about the miracles of Jesus. For the eschatological expectations behind this passage, see Pesch, Markusevangelium, 1. 333-36.</page><page sequence="15">DONAHUE: THEOLOGY OF MARK proffered by the court in 6:14b (egegertai ek nekrbn) and by Herod himself in 6:16 (houtos egerthP) imply that Jesus is a John redivivus, a view which comes close to a theory of reincarnation. In 13:5b-6, 21-22 false prophets and false messiahs will appear (egerthpsontai) who not only claim the authority of Jesus (epi tQ onomati mou) but appropriate that title (ego eimi, 13:6) which, in Mark, designates an epiphany of Jesus (6:50; 14:62).49 Mark calls their view deception (planan), the same term used to describe the error of the Sadducees (12:24, 27). Finally, while the visible appearance of Jesus was part of the earliest resurrection paradosis (1 Cor 15:3-8) and is found in the other gospels joined to the empty tomb tradition, Mark recounts no appearance of the risen Jesus, although the allusions in 14:27 ("I will go before you into Galilee") and in 16:7 ("there you will see him") suggest that Mark knew of such a tradition. The theology of resurrection in 12:26-27, rooted in the authority of a saying of Jesus, thus affirms the reality of resur- rection (12:26, egeirontai), and is in accord with Mark's own sober procla- mation of the resurrection of Jesus (16:7 egerthe, ouk estin hbde). Resurrec- tion is victory over death but it is not to be confused with materialistic understandings of it whether voiced by Herod, or the Sadducees. Nor can the presence of the risen Jesus be appropriated by false prophets and false messiahs. Mark's perspective on resurrection is also in accord with the spiritualizing tendency of Hellenistic thought which found in bodily resurrection a source of controversy (1 Cor 15:35-38, cf. Acts 17:32). The saying of Jesus in 12:26-27 also touches on the nature of God. God is the one who speaks through scripture and affirms his enduring power over death. At the center of his theological treatise on God, the Marcan Jesus reaffirms the core of Jewish monotheism, that God is a God of the living and a living God. This affirmation becomes an equally firm foundation of Christian faith. Resurrection is not return from 4' Pesch (Naherwartungen, 107-25; 154) says that 13:5b-6, 21-22 are an inclusio due to the evangelist. In Markusevangelium 2.277 he limits 13:6 to the evangelist. Whatever the relation of tradition and redaction the structural significance of these passages holds. They bracket the major part of the discourse and show that parousia deceivers are associated with the end time. We are not asserting that egerthesontai in 13:22 is used in the technical sense of resurrection from the dead. However, a number of commentators hold that in 13:6 the deceivers who come are in some sense claiming to be Jesus, who, from Mark's perspective, would obviously be the risen Jesus. Taylor (St. Mark, 504) says that the view that the deceivers are false prophets who claim to be Jesus Himself returning from on high does justice to epi tQ onomati mou and ego eimti, but says there is no independent evidence for such a view. He does however, relate this passage to Mark 6:14-16 and 8:28. Grundmann (Das Evangelium nach Markus [Berlin: Evan- gelische Verlagsanstalt, 1959] 263) says they may be claiming to be the returning Jesus. Kelber (Kingdom, 115) gives a careful survey of the possible meanings of epi tQ onomati mou opting for its use as an identity formula in conjunction wvith ego eimi and writes "Those who use the formula of theophany assert the identity of the very one in whose name they come. But anyone who approximately forty years after death claimed Jesus' presence must have claimed the appearance of the crucified one of the past." Therefore underlying 13:5b-6 is not only errone- ous eschatology but a wrong understanding of resurrection. 577</page><page sequence="16">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE the grave, but enduring life hidden in the power of God. God is not met primarily in figures who return from the dead, but in the one who has power over death.50 The Great Commandment (12:28-34) The third pericope on the true teaching of the way of God (12:32, cf. 12:14) is like the first in structure and content. In both an original question and answer is followed by a further statement, and in both the questioner is summoned to a double responsibility-to God and to some other (Caesar, v 17; the neighbor, vv 31, 33). The tradition behind this pericope is complex and admits of no easy delineation.51 While Mark has the initial Schulge- sprdch culminating in the pronouncement of v 31, which is then followed by a further dialogue, Matthew (22:34-40) omits the secondary dialogue, while Luke (10:25-28) is more like the secondary dialogue and omits the expression of the double command on the lips of Jesus.52 In Mark the two halves of the pericope do not easily match since the answer of the scribe extends the confession beyond the affirmation of the one God to one of the only God, and the love command is exalted above burnt offering and sacri- fice (vv 32-33). The OT citations are based on the LXX but they do not correspond exactly to any of the texts cited and thus betray the marks of oral transmission.53 Though the command to love the neighbor is well 5() E. Schweizer, The Good News According to Mark (Atlanta: John Knox, 1977) 249: "He [Jesus] points to God's power which goes beyond the limits of our imagination and to God's present promise which exceeds our power of comprehension and will therefore be stronger than death." 51 There is growing consensus that the double command of love took shape in an environment strongly influenced by Hellenistic wisdom, rather than in Palestinian Christianity.

Edwards (A Theology of Q [Philadelphia: Fortress, 1976]) does not list Luke 10:25-28 among the Q Material. 5:3 Berger, Gesetzesauslegung, 177: "Die zahlreichen Varianten des Textes Dt 6, 4.5 innerhalb der synoptischen Tradition und auch der HSS zeugen davon dass hier jeweils das Hauptgebot 578</page><page sequence="17">DONAHUE: THEOLOGY OF MARK attested in the New Testament, only in 1 John 4:19-21 is it joined with the command to love God and, rather surprisingly, given the language of Mark 12:30-33, the command to love God is rarely attested.54 Those intertes- tamental sources which are adduced as background for the double command of love do not have explicit allusions to those OT texts found in Mark.55 All this suggests that, though giving the impression of a carefully handed on tradition of the historical Jesus, the traditions behind the pericope were handed on quite freely. Whatever the exact wording of the tradition prior to Mark, there are clear evidences of Marcan redaction. The question by an individual scribe is found only here in Mark, and the favorable picture of him is in strong contrast to the generally negative view, most proximately in 12:38-40.56 The comment that the scribe overheard and approved (kalos 12:28) the previous discussion makes the scribe in agreement with the teaching on the resurrec- tion, and possibly with the saying of 12:17. The address of Jesus in the vocative (12:32) links the pericope with the two previous ones. There is an almost exact parallel between the scribe's approval of what Jesus has taught (12:28, idon hoti kalos apekrithe) and Jesus' approval of the scribe's confes- sion (12:34, idon hoti nounechbs apekrithe) which unites the beginning and end of the pericope. The kingdom saying in 12:34 is almost in the form of a blessing (sy ei) and the description of one being "near" to the kingdom is found in no other saying.57 The Marcan redaction, therefore, touches mainly on the person and function of the scribe. He is the one who approves the nach der Form der katechetischen Praxis zitiert wurde, unabhangig vom Wortlaut der LXX."

Nineham, among others, notes that the intertestamental places may be of Christian origins (St. Mark, 324). 56 Cook (Jewish Leaders, 51) calls attention to the different picture of the scribes in chapter 12. They are more active, almost Pharisaic, in contrast to their presence in the Passion Narrative. 57 A.

Ambrozic points out the difference between 12:34 and the "toroth of entry" sayings. The distinction between the confession required of one who is "near" and the demands to enter or to follow, may reflect an institution like Christian "god-fearers" or catechumens.

The significance of this will be noted shortly. The pericope as we have it, especially in the second half, has a strong Hellenistic flavor, and the stress not only on the one God, but on the only God would be important in a polytheistic environment.58 The condensing of pseuches and dianoias to syneseos as well as Jesus' use of nounechos gives an intellectualistic flavor to the pericope.59 The exaltation of the ethical monotheism beyond cultic rites is characteristic of Hellenistic Judaism in its missionary apologetic and the tendency to summarize the whole law under two headings roughly corresponding to dikaiosyne (obligation to God) and philanthropia (obligations to neighbor) is also characteristic of Hellenistic Judaism.60 The implicit universalism in all three pericopes counters a charge of exclusivism.61 Thus all three pericopes show signs of an apologetic to a non-Christian world. Christians are to worship God, but not directly to oppose the state; the resurrection is an affirmation of the power of the living God, and worship of this God is radically theistic. There is strong evidence that behind the whole complex of 12:13-34 stands an early Christian apolo- getic which is in debt to the missionary preaching of Hellenistic Judaism (esp. in 12:28-34). The question of the Marcan use of these traditions can now be addressed. In the three pericopes Mark presents a schematized picture of Jewish leadership groups which have been in dialogue and debate with Jesus in the public ministry. This is the last section of the gospel where such debate will take place since from now on Jesus speaks in a monologue, gives private teaching to his disciples, or answers hostile questions by his accusers.62 In these pericopes, Jesus is portrayed as instructing official Judaism on the true meaning of the Jewish scriptures and beliefs. Jesus speaks the language of a Hellenistic missionary preacher giving a proper 5 ep' aletheias; only one god; greater than sacrifices or burnt offerings; nounechos. Furnish (Love Command, 29) following Bornkamm writes: "When the distinctively rationalistic vocabu- lary here is coupled with the emphasis on the oneness of God (vss 29,32), the result is material which would have particular merit and meaning within the context of Hellenistic Jewish and Christian apologetic directed against Greek polytheism." 59 Gerhardsson ("Hermeneutical Program," 132) calls attention to the many "expressions of reason" which give the pericope "an Hellenistic atmosphere." 6) Berger, Gesetzesauslegung, 143-65. 61 For an excellent survey of this charge against Judaism see J. L. Daniel, "Anti-Semitism in the Hellenistic-Roman Period," JBL 98 (1979) 45-65; the famous passage from Tacitus Ann. 15:44 notes that Christians were persecuted "odio generis humani" (because of their hatred of the human race). J. Weiss (Earliest Christianity: A History of the Period A.D. 30-150 [Harper Torchbooks; New York: Harper and Row, 1959] 2. 839-40) notes similar charges of atheism and superstition. The "love command" would well serve as an apology to such charges. 62 Though 12:35-38 is often called a Streitgesprich or a Schulgesprich, it is really no conver- sation at all since Jesus himself quotes the scribal opinion and comments on it; 12:38-13:37 are monologues; 13:4-37 and 14:12-42 are to the disciples alone, and hostile accusations occur in 14:4-5. 580</page><page sequence="19">DONAHUE: THEOLOGY OF MARK interpretation of Judaism. He does this at that stage in Mark when the institutions and claims of official Judaism are being transformed. The temple will be the house of prayer for all nations (11:17), and prayer rather than cultic worship will provide access to God (11:21-25); the doctrine of election is relativized in the parable of the vineyard workers where the vineyard will be given to others (12:9) consequent on the rejection of Jesus. The didache of 12:13-34 comes precisely at that time when a positive theology is needed as a replacement for the older theology.63 Mark 13:9 gives a clue to the setting of such theology; before the end time the gospel must be preached "to all the nations (gentiles)," a gospel which is not simply the good news of Jesus, the Messiah (1:1), but the gospel of God, (1:15). The scribe who is not far from the kingdom in affirming the kernel of Jewish faith as articulated by Jesus is a symbol of the properly disposed hearer of this preaching. Most significantly the major thrust of this teaching is theistic rather than explicitly christological. Jesus in effect teaches that belief in the one God and service of him is the foundation of any further belief. Though the sayings on entering the kingdom of God in Mark have the distinct flavor of discipleship as following Jesus on the way to the cross, the scribe who is yet to embark on this way is still "near." There emerges therefore in Mark a dual emphasis, the kerygmatic, the following of the crucified one, and the apologetic, following Jesus is belief in the one God.64 Mark explicitly allows Jesus to be the foundation of this emphasis by having Jesus speak of God throughout the gospel in the language of rever- ential transcendence, while at the same time speaking for God with a unique authority which is the teaching of the way of God in truth (12:14).65 III Both the general picture of the way Jesus speaks of God in the gospel of Mark and the short theological treatise which Mark offers in 12:13-34 indi- cate that Jesus speaks authoritatively for God and summons his hearers to a 63 Donahue, Christ, 103-38; Kelber, Kingdom, 87-128. 64 "Dual emphasis" is not used in an exclusive sense. Other traditions integrated by Mark into his gospel have other purposes often oriented to the internal need of the community such as providing a rationale for the destruction of the temple by use of Davidic motifs. See Donahue, "Temple, Trial and Royal Christology," in The Passion in Mark (ed. W. Kelber; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1976) 61-79; D. Juel, Messiah and Temple (SBLDS 31; Missoula: Scholars, 1977) esp. 117-40; 211-15. 65 Though in his commentary Pesch holds Mark to be a very conservative redactor who rarely alters the traditions he receives (in contrast to his earlier position in Naherwartungen), he does hold that as an author Mark compiles the material in such a way that clear motifs emerge. One of these is the authority of Jesus shown in his teaching (1:27). The one speaking "for God," suggests a prophetic motif in Mark. Such motifs are well described in C. H. Dodd, "Jesus as Teacher and Prophet" in Mysterium Christi (ed. G. Bell and A. Deissmann; London: Longmans, Green, 1930) 53-68 and C. K.

The one who assents to the proper monotheistic confession is the one who is not far from the king- dom of God. This aspect of Jesus' teachings has implications for two central concerns of the Second Gospel, discipleship and christology. Discipleship The question of discipleship is one of the areas most intensively studied over the last decade.66 E. Schweizer and Klemens Stock have called attention to the structural importance of the discipleship pericopes which inaugurate major sections of the gospel.67 Norman Perrin has shown that the whole central section of the gospel is organized around the theme of passion prediction, discipleship misunderstanding and further instructions on the demands of following Jesus on the way of the cross.68 A still ongoing debate has emerged on the role or function of the disciples in Mark and how this addresses the concerns of the Marcan community. One school of which Weeden is the most thorough exponent sees the disciples as negative para- digms moving from misunderstanding, to incomprehension of the necessity of suffering to outright denial. This group with Peter as the head represents those in the community who would want to substitute a theologia gloriae for a theologia crucis and who pride themselves on their pneumatic identifica- tion with the risen Jesus. Mark is seen to discredit their view by the negative view of the disciples, by his stress on the cross, and by the denial of a resurrection appearance.69 Kelber sees the disciples in similar vein as expo- nents of a false eschatology which wanted to identify the destruction of Jerusalem with the parousia, and finds their position equally discredited by pointing to the arrival of the kingdom in a new place, Galilee, and at a new time, at the parousia, which is imminent, but not yet present.70 Another group of interpreters admits the unfavorable view of the 12 and disciples in Mark, but hesitates to cast the disciples in the role of negative dramatis per- sonae in conflicts abroad in the Marcan church.71 The unfavorable picture (i( Mlonographs by K.-G.

This, we feel, constitutes a narrowing of Mark's understanding of discipleship. In fact "discipleship" itself is a somewhat infelicitous term since in Mark those who respond to the gospel of God (1:15) are a group wider than the disciples (mathetai) or the twelve and from observation oi this group and particular sayings associated with them we can get a more comprehensive picture of what it means "to convert and believe in the gospel" (1:15). Throughout Mark there are a curious number of places where other people do those very things which the twelve are summoned to do, "to follow Jesus," "to preach" "to do mighty works."73 In 1:45, the healed leper begins to proclaim many things (keryssein polla) and spread the word (ton logon used absolutely almost as equivalent to gospel, cf. 4:13). Many toll collectors and sinners "follow him" (2:15 pkolouthoun) and the Gerasene demoniac begins to proclaim (keryssein 5:20) as do the witnesses to the healing of the deaf and dumb man (7:36). An exorcist who is explicitly designated a non-follower is for Jesus (9:40) and blind Bartimaeus follows Jesus "on the way" after the disciples fail to comprehend the way of suffer- ing (10:52). The scribe who answers rightly is, as we have seen, not far from the kingdom of God and a widow fulfills the true cultic worship. (12:41-44). A woman anoints Jesus before his death and will be heralded wherever the gospel is proclaimed (14:1-9). Women accompany Jesus to the cross (15:41) and a Jewish member of the council who "was waiting for the kingdom of God" (15:43) performs those burial duties which the disciples of John per- formed for him (6:29). A gentile centurion utters the proper Christian confession (15:39) and women are recipients of the paschal message (16:1-8). Clearly Mark does not limit positive response to the gospel nor to the teach- ing of Jesus to the example of the twelve or those originally called to be with him and to do the things he did. While the above examples are taken mainly from the narrative portions of Mark's gospel, there are a number of sayings on the lips of Jesus which indicate that Mark roots this wider view of discipleship in the voice of Jesus teaching); "Peter in the Gospel of Mark," CBQ 40 (1978) 547-58; Peter in the New Testament (ed.

The key saying and one which provides a hermeneu- tical key for the others is in 3:35. This saying concludes the pericope where Jesus is charged with being an ecstatic prophet under the power of Beelzebul (3:21-22). Though 3:31-35, the sayings on the true relatives of Jesus, seem at first to be an appendage to the Beelzebul controversy more strictly speaking (3:20-30), they are related to it by Mark through the reference in 3:21 that close associates of Jesus come out to seize him.74 What is at stake here are the conditions by which one is truly related to Jesus. At the end of the pericope on the true relatives, Jesus states: "Whoever does the will of God, this one is my brother and sister and mother" (3:35). In its context this saying is a direct counter in both form and content to the malediction of 3:29: "Whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit, never will receive forgiveness but is guilty of the eternal sin." For Mark the issue is radically juxtaposed, doing the will of God, or blaspheming against the Holy Spirit. The sayings of 3:35 (and 3:29) exhibit formal characteristics found in a number of sayings in Mark (3:29, 35; 6:11; 8:35(2); 8:38; 9:37(2); 9:41, 42; 10:11, 10:15, 10:43-44; 11:23). Formally they involve the use of the conditional relative (hos) with an and a verb in the aorist subjunctive in the protasis. The greatest variation takes place in the apodosis with a mixture of the present tense (3:29, 35; 9:37, 42; 10:11) and the future (6:11; 8:35, 38; 9:41; 10:15, 43-44; 11:23). Many of the futures have a gnomic quality "to express that which is expected in certain circumstances," and thus establish a generic relation between the protasis and apodosis.75 Performance of a certain action results in a corresponding effect or state. Similar to these are sayings which use another form of the condition in the protasis (4:25) or a pronominal relative clause (9:40; 10:30), or a participle (13:13).76 Bultmann classes such sayings as "legal sayings," and Kasemann charac- terizes one of them among his "sentences of holy law."77 However, the most extensive examination of them is by Klaus Berger who questions whether they can really be called legal sayings.78 He finds the closest parallels to them in the wisdom tradition in sayings such as Prov 13:13, "He who despises the word brings destruction on himself." Berger argues persuasively that such sayings are not really "legal" but rather function in ethical pare- nesis and are of a gnomic quality describing a general condition with a 74 J. D.

The sayings in Mark which imply some kind of future judgment consequent on an action are not rooted in the OT lex talionis (a la Kasemann) but in the transformation of the wisdom by apocalyptic.80 In Mark those sayings exhibiting such formal characteristics are divided fairly equally between those addressed to the twelve or mathptai explicitly named (e.g. 9:37, 40, 41; 10:30; 10:43-44; 11:23; 13:13) and those addressed to a wider audience (e.g. 3:29, 35; 8:35; 10:11, 15). Even in the former group however there are hints that a wider audience is envisioned. Though 9:35-37 records instruction to the twelve, the initial saying, "If anyone (ei tis) wishes to be first of all, let that one become last and servant of all," is a variation of the widely attested generic saying "the first shall be last and the last first."81 The saying on being for us in 9:40 and on offering a drink of water "in the name of Christ" in 9:41 are in a context rejecting the claims of the disciples to exclusiveness, so that 9:37 should be seen as looking beyond the twelve to a wider audience. The saying in 10:43-44 exists in a like context of countering claims of pre-eminence on the part of disciples, and 13:13, though in a discourse addressed to disciples, refers to any believer caught up in the eschatological turmoil. Therefore on the basis of formal analysis (gnomic statements), background (wisdom parenesis) and context (discipleship instruction for a wide group) these sayings provide a more universal catechesis on discipleship than those pericopes explicitly concerned with following Jesus. In content they also present a picture of discipleship quite different from that of the ministry of the twelve. The summons of Jesus in 1:15 is to believe in the gospel and 3:35 states the fundamental condition of that belief, doing the will of God. The other gnomic sayings then provide concrete instances of such doing the will of God. This involves respect for God's creative intent in marriage (10:11); losing one's life "for the gospel" (8:35); forsaking riches (10:30); enduring persecution (13:13); welcoming the powerless children (9:36-37); living a life of service (10:43-44); performing the duties of hospitality (9:41); and trust in the power of prayer (11:23). Even though the motivation at times seems christological, the addition of "for the gospel" in 8:35 and 10:29, the view that the one who is not consciously a disciple is "for us" (9:40) and the indication that the one who receives Jesus receives the one who sent him (9:37), all suggest a theistic grounding for discipleship which is response to the gospel of God and fulfilling God's will. Though the original disciples are called to close 79 Ibid. 15-19. s() Ibid. 19-25. 81 Mark 10:31; Matt 19:30; Matt 20:16; Luke 13:30.

(13:9-11). Mark's view of what it means to respond to the gospel is, therefore, wider than either an imitatio Christi or even an imitatio discipulorum. The essence of responding to the gospel is doing the will of God and the Marcan Jesus is one who summons people to such obedience rather than to literal imitation of his own life. Mark's understanding of God thus provides the way for a more comprehensive theology of discipleship. This latter point raises the question of suffering and the gospel of Mark. There is a virtual unanimity that Mark presents a theologia crucis. The passion dominates the gospel and from 8:27 the way of following Jesus to Jerusalem is the way of the cross.82 In the apocalyptic discourse Jesus pre- dicts that the kind of suffering he underwent, betrayal, trials before legal authorities and death will be the lot of the church (13:11-12). While the centrality of suffering is clear in Mark, its theological significance is less clear. Those authors who stress discipleship failure portray the way of the cross as countering an enthusiastic Christianity which wants to live in the spirit or power of the resurrection. Mark is seen as presenting the following of Jesus on the way of the cross as the only Christian option. Suffering becomes almost equated with believing in the gospel. While affirming the importance of suffering, we would claim that it has a different theological function. The key texts center around the failure of Peter. In 8:31-33 after the first passion prediction Peter begins to rebuke Jesus, which elicits a strong counter rebuke in which Jesus calls Peter, "Satan." He then says "you do not think the things of God (ta tou theou) but the things of men (ta tou anthropou)." Peter's fault is not lack of courage nor any fascination with a theologia gloriae. It is rather that he does not see the passion as a thing of God, especially after the prediction is couched in the form of the divine dei. In the foreshadowing of Peter's denial (14:27- 31), Jesus calls the defection of the disciples "scandal," and Peter's protesta- tion that he will not be scandalized confirms that this is exactly what his denial involves.83 In Mark scandal is something which will emerge in a time of tribulation or persecution "for the sake of the word" (4:17).84 In 6:3 the people of Jesus' own town "are scandalized" because they cannot reconcile 82 W. Marxsen, Introduction to the New Testament (Philadelphia: Fortress, 1968) 134-35. Anticipations of the passion are found as early as Mark 2:19-20 and 3:6. (3 The citation of Zech 13:7 in Mark 14:27 "I will strike" with pataxo instead of the LXX and the Hebrew imperative makes God the agent of the passion who thus occasions the scattering. On the relation to the OT text, see, Taylor, St. Mark, 548. s4 This view of scandal in Mark is close to the Pauline understanding of the word of the cross, Christ crucified, as the skandalon to the Jews.

In contrast to Peter, in his prayer in Gethsemane, while recognizing God as having the power to spare him (14:36), Jesus prays that he may follow the will of God (ou ti egb thelo, alla ti sy). Jesus is, in effect, the one who fulfills the conditions of 3:35, doing the will of God. Therefore Peter's defection, characterized as scandal, is like scandal in other parts of the Gospel; it is a failure to see things from God's perspective; it is a thinking of the things of man, a failure to see suffering as the will of God. Therefore the problem of suffering for Mark is one of theodicy; the cross becomes the stumbling block because it cannot be reconciled with the way one thinks of God. Mark does not canonize suffering in itself as an absolute good or as the unique form of Christian discipleship. Jesus predicts that suffering will come as a concomitant to preaching the gospel (13:11), but the posture during suffering is to be one of faithful endurance (13:13) and watchfulness before the end (13:34-36). Jesus is not simply a model to be' followed on the way of suffering, but a model of one who in the midst of suffering can address God as abba, and who can see in suffering the will of God, even with the awareness that this will could be otherwise (14:34-36). The conjunction of suffering and discipleship leads one to the mystery of God and not simply to a contemplation of the cross of Jesus. Therefore attention to the neglected factor of Mark's theology sheds a different per- spective on one of the least neglected factors of that theology, the question of discipleship. Christology To class the question of christology under an "implication" of Mark's understanding of God is an obvious understatement. It is rather the axis of the problem, but an axis around which revolve all aspects of Mark's varied theological perspectives.85 At present we can call attention to only three sayings of Jesus in Mark which, though not at the center of recent studies on Christology, throw light on the perspective being presented here. The choice, however, is not simply arbitrary since in these sayings Jesus speaks directly of a personal relationship to God. Mark 9:37. After the second passion prediction, the twelve exhibit their usual misunderstanding of the necessity of the passion and bicker over who will be the greatest. In 9:35 Jesus then "sits" (4:1; 13:3; cf. 14:62) assuming the position of authoritative address, and delivers the long dis- course of 9:35-50.86 The tradition history of the initial verses of this s5 On varied christological perspectives see Donahue, "Jesus as Parable" 369-75 and literature, supra, n. 2. The view of D. Moody Smith ("The Presentation of Jesus in the Fourth Gospel," Int 31 [1977] 375) that John offers a multidimensional christology is no less true of Mark.

Matthew omits Mark 9:37b as well as the following incident of the exorcist who is not a disciple (9:38- 41). Luke retains Mark 9:37b, but adds to it in 9:48 a saying much like Mark 10:43-44. The Marcan saying itself is found in so many different variations that Lohmeyer characterizes it as "wandering in different forms through the gospel tradition."88 Taylor suggests that the Matthean form of the pericope may be the earlier version so that we are justified in assuming that 9:37b has been attached by Mark through Stichwort composition (dechesthai) to the original saying on receiving a child.89 Sayings exhibiting a similar form and content are found in the following places: (a) Luke 9:48, the parallel to Mark 9:37b; (b) Matt 10:40, ho decho- menos hymas eme dechetai, kai ho eme dechomenos dechetai ton apostei- lanta me; (c) Luke 10:16 ho de eme atheton athetei ton aposteilanta me; (d) John 13:20 (cf. 12:44; 5:23) ho de eme lambanon lambanei ton pemp- santa me. In all of these sayings the reception or rejection of Jesus is the reception or rejection of the one who sent him. Such sayings incorporate the prophetic motif of the one sent as the authoritative speaker for the sender, and the saying on rejection in Luke 10:16 suggests also the rejection of wisdom's messengers.90 Such sayings evidently represent a rather free floating mode of expression which was incorporated by the Evangelists at places pertinent to their own theology. The sayings also exhibit that gnomic form discussed earlier, and all of them have a clear chiastic structure where the verb of receiving (or rejecting in Luke 10:16) provides the middle term, and the agent and object, the end terms. The Lucan form of 9:48 is a clear illustration: (A) hos an eme (B) dexetai (B') dechetai (A') ton aposteilanta me. The Marcan form of the saying with the addition of ouk eme dechetai, followed by the ellipsis breaks the chiastic pattern. Therefore, we would claim that Mark alters an original chiastic saying found throughout the tradition, by the explicit mention that the one "who receives me, does not receive me." Such an addition is called by Kuschke a $' Taylor (St. AMark, 405-6) points out that Mark 9:37 may not be original to its present context since it fits better with 10:15-16.

El) Edwards (The Theology of Q, 106) points out that "The phrase 'the one who sent me' co(uld be interpreted as a prophetic motif. But the sage is also the one wsho feels sent by wis- dom .... Thus prophetic and wisdom tendencies cannot be clearly distinguished from one another in this saying." See also Mark 6:2, "the wisdom given him" and 6:4 "a prophet is not without honor, except in his own country." 588</page><page sequence="27">DONAHUE: THEOLOGY OF MARK "negative assertion," that is, "an emphatic statement which is clothed in the form of a negation or exception, so that the statement, since it pre-supposes another one or an exception is made to it, does not mean all that it seems to."91 The "sending" terminology of 9:37 indicates that the other statement presupposed or behind the negation is the reference to the sending of Jesus in Mark 12:6. What appears as a saying in 9:37 is narrated in parable in 12:1-12. The addition of 12:6 makes the parable clearly refer to the sending and rejection of Jesus so that the "negative assertion" of 9:37 lets the reader know in advance that the rejection of the son who is sent (12:6) is not simply the rejection of God's legate but of God himself. The phrase also communi- cates a nuanced christology. On the one hand the authority of Jesus as mediator and faithful representative is enhanced. He re-presents the sender perfectly. On the other, the rejection or acceptance of the messenger himself is lessened since the addition of "does not receive me" moves the attention from the fate of the messenger to the authority of the sender. In effect the role or function of Jesus as faithful messenger is heightened, while his personal fate seems somewhat less important. Such a transformation of an original saying in 9:37b by Mark fits in with the view of christology and discipleship present in the larger Marcan con- text, 9:14-50. Immediately after the transfiguration Jesus returns from the mountain to find that, though the disciples were commissioned to exorcise (6:7), they could not cast out a demon (9:18).92 After performing the exor- cism Jesus explains privately that such a demon can be cast out "only by prayer" (9:29). The power to exorcise is not rooted simply in the exousia communicated by Jesus (6:7), but is dependent on the power of God which is evoked through prayer (cf. 11:23). Immediately following the passion prediction (9:30-32), and the sayings of 9:33-37, we have an incident where an exorcist who is not a disciple possesses that very dynamis (9:39) which the disciples lacked previously. The bracketing of 9:30-37 by these two exorcism stories sheds light on the christology of 9:37. Though Jesus empowered the disciples to exorcise, he is not the distributor of this power; only contact with God in prayer evokes it. One can be empowered to exor- cise without being an explicit disciple of Jesus. The important thing is con- tact with "the one who sent me." Such a christology maintains the Marcan emphasis on the transcendence of God, while not minimizing the role of Jesus as the one who uniquely speaks for God and points through himself to God. Mark 10:40. The final pericope in the passion prediction sequence of 8:27-10:52 is the epitome of discipleship misunderstanding in the face of the 91 A.

After the third and most vivid prediction of 10:32-34, James and John request positions of authority "at the right and at the left" when Jesus enters into his eschatological enthronement (10:37).93 In response Jesus says that they will share in his cup and baptism, an allusion to the future martyr- dom of the sons of Zebedee.94 He then adds "but to sit at my left or my right is not mine to give, but it is for those for whom it has been prepared." Both Matthew 20:23 and some of the Marcan MSS add hypo tou patros mou, making explicit the theological passive of hetoimastai. In content, then, Jesus affirms that the disciples can follow his way of the cross and at the end of the pericope, 10:45, he will say that this is his reason for "coming." He can summon them to service and martyrdom, but not even he has the power to allot positions of honor at the end time. Therefore we see that in each case where discipleship misunderstanding is being countered, there is not only a statement on the proper meaning of discipleship (bearing of cross, 8:34-36; receiving of little ones, 9:35-36; being willing to be baptized and drink the cup, 10:38-39), but there is also a significant statement about God and Jesus' relation to him. Peter does not think the things of God (8:33); the one who receives Jesus receives the one who sent him (9:37); and Jesus is not the one who assigns the places of honor in the new age (10:40). This disclaimer of Jesus about a role attributed to him equal to God at the end time is paralleled in Mark 13:32 by the state- ment that "not even the son" will know the day or the hour, a statement which also comes at the conclusion of a long section of instruction to disciples.95 Mark constantly relates proper instruction on discipleship not only to a proper understanding of the necessity of suffering but to a proper understanding of the relation of Jesus to God. Mark 13:32. A text which has provided a major crux interpretum for a discussion of the relation of Jesus to God is Mark 13:32: "Concerning that day or hour, no one has knowledge, neither the angels in heaven, nor the son (oude ho huios), but only the father."96 It stands in stark contrast not only to the "high christology" of John, but also to the wisdom christology of Matt 11:25-27. Rather than attempt a thorough study of it as a stage in a develop- ing christology, we will comment on its function in Mark. Such a saying is unique in Mark in its absolute use of ho huios. Also the normal triad associated with the events of the end time are God (father), Son of Man and the angels (e.g. 8:38, cf. 13:26; 14:62). Such considerations have led to the postulate of an earlier form of the text which either omitted reference to "the son" or which spoke of lack of knowledge of the end time 9:3 Lohlmeever, Marku.sevangelium, 222. 9)4 Pesch (Markusevangelium, 2.159) holds that the passage served to counter the claims for privileged status by the sons of Zebedee, and holds 10:39d to be vaticinium ex eventu. 95 Pesch, loc. cit. 9(r The problems of this verse wvere felt as early as the Matthean \xss tradition which omitted the phrase. Taylor (St. Mark, 522) feels that the original Matthean text omits it as does Luke. 590</page><page sequence="29">DONAHUE: THEOLOGY OF MARK by the angels and the Son of Man.97 Even if the saying is an editorial rewrit- ing of an earlier saying, the question remains as to its function in the context of chapter 13 and the Marcan christology as a whole. Recent research on chapter 13 while differing on details views the final form of the chapter as emerging in the events following the destruction of the temple.98 The chapter represents simultaneously a correction of misinterpretations of the events of A.D. 66-70 by stating that the destruction was not the end and that Jesus did not return in those who claimed to speak in his name, and a re-apocalypticizing of the tradition stressing that the end is near and one must read the signs of the times.99 What is communicated in the discourse itself through prophecy is restated in 13:28-29 through parable. The parable of the fig tree with the stress on tauta ginomena (13:29, cf. 13:4) stresses the nearness of the end. The appended sayings of Jesus in vv 30-31, especially with the solemn "amen" formula stress that the words of Jesus are true and provide the only enduring guide for discerning the time. The final parable provides an exhortation to constant vigilance and watchfulness. The "knowledge of the day" saying provides the bridge between those sayings which exalt the authority of Jesus and his exhortation to watchfulness.100 The saying of 13:32 thus represents Marcan redaction which serves to counter a possible misunderstood christology emanating from the discourse. Though Jesus is the true prophet whose words have been fulfilled in the history of the community, and though they have eternal validity, he is still subordinate to the Father in knowledge of the end. Such a perspective also puts to an end possible misuse of the words of Jesus for speculation about the day or hour of the end. If even the son does not know, then his sayings should not be used for this purpose. The christological perspective here is somewhat similar to that of 1 Cor 15:27-28, "when all these things are subjected to him, then the Son (kai autos ho huios) will also be subject to him who put all things under him." In both Mark 13:32 and 1 Cor 15:28, the phrases dealing with the son are underscored by an intensive particle (oude, kai) which calls explicit attention to the relation of the son to the Father. Schweizer suggests that these statements about the son "serve to warn against 97 Pesch (Markusevangelium, 2.310) attributes oude ho huios to the evangelist. 9( Kelber, Kingdom; Pesch in Naherwartungen and Markusevangelium; Lambrecht, Die Redaktion des Markus-Apocalypse (AnBib 28; Rome: Biblical Institute, 1967); and most recent- vl F.

'9 Hahn, "Rede," 260-61. 1)() The "bridge" quality of the saying is illustrated by its position in the new editions of the Greek text-United Bible Society, 3rd ed. as the first sentence in a new paragraph beginning at 13:32; Nestle, 26th ed. as a separate paragraph between 13:31-33. 591</page><page sequence="30">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE a misunderstanding of Christ, the Lord of the end time, as a second God alongside the Father."101 While such a view may be implied in Mark, I think there is a more positive reason for the text. This text and 14:35-36 are the final places in the gospel where Jesus speaks of "the Father." In each place the image of Jesus as son is one of faithful trust in the Father, even in face of mystery, the mystery of the end time and of the passion. In Mark also the two places where a heavenly voice addresses Jesus as son (1:11; 9:7), the adjective used is agapetos, and the son sent in 12:6 is also agapetos. Since agapetos in the LXX often translates yahid, commentators tend to say that by agapetos Mark understood "only."102 While the nuance of "only" may be there, the more obvious sense of "beloved" should not be overlooked. This usage appears in Wis 4:10, "there was one who pleased God and was loved by him, and while living among sinners he was taken up."103 We are not claiming that the Marcan usage is a direct allusion to this text. However Mark does show contact with a closely related motif in the Wisdom of Solomon, the suffering just one who remains faithful even amid trial (2:12-20; 5:1-5).104 Also Berger has adduced considerable evidence to suggest that the father/son terminology reflects similar traditions.105 There- fore we would suggest that Jesus is the son who is loved by God and who remains faithful even amid testing and trial. The ignorance of the day in 13:32 as well as the submission to the will of God in 14:36 are not ways of describing an ontological relationship but of portraying Jesus as a model of trusting fidelity. Even though Jesus will sit at the right hand of power (14:62) and share in the final judgment (13:26), and even though in his life he was the one who spoke uniquely for God, he still stands before the myste- ry and transcendence of God. Conclusion We have attempted to open examination of the neglected factor in Mark's theology, the question of theos. In surveying the ways Jesus spoke of 1() l Schweizer, \alrk, 282. 102 Taylor, St. Mark, 161-62, citing also Lagrange and Swete. 1(): K. Berger ("Die koniglichen Messiastraditionen des Neuen Testaments," NTS 20 [1973] 29) calls attention to a use of agapetos, T. Levi, frag. 58 in the sense of both beloved and "preferred." 104 I,. Ruppert, Jesus als der leidende Gerechte (SBS 59; Stuttgart; Katholisches Bibelwerk, 1972). Kuppert points out that this motif which is rooted in the psalms underlies the fourth scrvaIt song of Isa 52:13-53:12, extends through the suffering of the pious in Daniel (11:33-35; 12:1-3) and finds its fullest pre-Christian expression in the Wisdom of Solomon. Pesch (Markus- c('Lag(lium, 2.13) sees this motif at the substructure of the pre-Marcan passion narrative. The miost extensive discussion of the influence of this motif on Mark is D.

In his Jerusalem didachp Jesus comes closest to theological statements on the nature of God. God is the sovereign who demands attention to the things of God, a God of the living and the one who is worshipped not by sacrifice and burnt offering, but by the dual command of love. This God makes his will known through scripture, and following the will of God is entry into the family of Jesus (Mark 3:35). Even though he is the beloved son (1:11; 9:7, agapetos with the nuance of "only"), Jesus does not know the secrets of the father (13:32) and stands in obedience to his will (14:36). Yet, to receive Jesus is not simply to receive him, but the one who sent him (9:37) and his life, teaching and death are given to those near him as "the mystery of the kingdom of God" (4:11).106 Jesus, then, does not simply stand before the mystery of God; he embodies it and can be called "the parable of God" who summons the hearers or readers of the gospel to open their ears and hearts to "the good news of God" (1:14-15).107 The ways in which the mystery of God come to expression in Mark raise questions about the purpose and destination of the gospel. With the caution in mind that the NT writings are often multipurposed, we can suggest that ()(i p. Achtemeier (Mark [Proclamation Commentaries; Philadelphia: Fortress Press, 1975] 69- 70) "The mystery of the kingdom of God given to Jesus' followers is also clearly Jesus himself." Also, P. von der Osten-Sacken, "Streitgesprach und Parabel als Formen markinischer Christo- logic," in Jesus Christus in Historie (supra, n. 7) 386-91, who argues that the use of Isa 6:9-10 in a clear christological sense in Acts 28:26-27 and John 12:40 is evidence for its similar use in \lark 4:12. M. Boucher (The Mysterious Parable: A Literary Study [CBQMS 6; Washington: Catholic Biblical Association, 1977]) argues that the mystery of Mark 4:12 is a "mystery of application" and that "The mystery has to do entirely xith one's willingness to receive the eschatological and ethical teaching of Jesus" (pp. 83-84). 1() The description of Jesus as the "parable of God" was first suggested to me by L. Keek's statemnent i propos of the historical Jesus: "This character and role of the parables supports our suggestion that Jesus is himself a parable. Just as the parable has as many points as there are situations into which it is spoken, so Jesus' life has as many disclosure opportunities as there are contexts in which it is used-as the history of Christology clearly shows"; in A Future for the listorical Jesus (Nashville: Abingdon, 1971) 244. In another place ("Jesus as Parable") I have tried to show that the Marcan Jesus is parabolic. "Ears and hearts": Concern for perceptive listening and well-disposed hearts characterizes the gospel of Mark at important places. The gospel begins with the cry of a voice to prepare a way (1:3) and Jesus' first public act is that of heraldic proclamation (1:14-15). The parable chapter is structured around the command to hear (4:3, 9, 23, see also 7:14; 8:18). At his baptism Jesus is presented by a voice from heaven (1:11) and at the transfiguration the disciples are summoned to "hear him" (9:7). The gospel concludes with an announcement (16:6, "he has risen") and a command in the imperative (16:7), just as it begins (1:2-3). Likewise outsiders are those who hear but do not understand (4:12) and those symbolized bv the first seed simply hear but the word is "immediately" taken away (4:15). The disciples who misunderstand the teaching on the leaven like the outsiders of 4:11 "have ears, but do not hear" (7:18). Similarly rejection or misunderstanding of the gospel is due to "hardness of heart" (3:5; 6:52; 7:6; 8:17) and often the heart is the center of evil (7:16, cf. 2:6-8). In contrast true faith is "not doubting in the heart" (11:23) and the two motifs of hear- ing and heart converge in the proclamation of the great command which begins with the sumnmons to "hear, O Israel," (12:29) and embraces love of God with a whole heart (12:30, 33). 593</page><page sequence="32">JOURNAL OF BIBLICAL LITERATURE Mark also addressed diverse concerns. Recent studies of Mark, especially those which focus on chapter 13, suggest that Mark wrote after the destruc- tion of the temple of Jerusalem and wanted to provide the Jewish members of his community a rationale for the destruction.108 Jesus himself predicted the destruction which is in consequence of the rejection of Jesus by Jerusalem leaders (12:1-12). God's presence is found no longer in the temple, but in the teaching and story of Jesus and the community which possesses this good news is the temple not made with hands (14:58).109 At the same time Mark counters those who would want to see in the destruction the arrival of the end time. The present of Mark's community is a time of fidelity and watchfulness, but this is not to involve simply a sectarian ethic of inner community concerns. This time is also a time when the good news is to be preached to all nations (13:10). In his study of the sea voyages of Mark 4:35-8:21 where miracles and teaching in both gentile and Jewish territory are carefully juxtaposed, Kelber suggests that Mark thus roots the outreach to the gentile world in the ministry of Jesus.ll0 Recently, R. Pesch has made a strong case that Mark is primarily a Missionsbuch where the acclamations of Jesus' dignity in the miracle stories anticipate the acclamation of the gentile world symbolized by the centurion (15:39).1ll We would claim that Mark's understanding of God with its strong emphasis on transcendence and the avoidance of anthropomorphisms serves a similar function. Likewise, the incorporation of the Jerusalem didache in 12:13-34, at that precise moment when the vineyard will be given to others (12:9) provides a fundamental missionary catechesis for these others. The section begins with Jesus, who is no respecter of persons like God who accepts the gentile Cornelius (Acts 10:34), teaching the way of God in truth and concludes with the acceptance of one who affirms the core Christian belief, wholehearted love of God and neighbor. Discipleship is wider than imitation of Jesus' way of the cross and is grounded in the quest to seek and do the will of God. Mark's gospel, therefore, is directed to those who have been converted and believe in the gospel (1:15) but also reaches out to those who may be seeking the way of God in truth and therefore are not far from the kingdom of God.112 108 Supra, n. 64. 109 Donahue, Christ, 112-13; Juel, Messiah and Temple, 208-9. 11 Kingdom, 45-65. 111 Markusevangelium, 1.53-63.
