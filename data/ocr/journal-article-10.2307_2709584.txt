<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Scottish Influence on French Aesthetic Thought: Later Developments James W. Manns In a previous article I examined the influence of Thomas Reid's aes- thetics on the theories of art and beauty put forward by two of France's most important early nineteenth-century philosophers, Victor Cousin and Theodore Jouffroy. There it was shown how they both developed theories which followed Reid's thinking in all major and most minor respects and that it was precisely by this route that expressionism gained entry into France. As should be expected, given the considerable power which Cousin and Jouffroy wielded as authors and as academicians, an expressionist aesthetics with distinctly Reidean overtones continued to expand within the French intellectual community throughout much of the remainder of the century. It is this succeeding development which I pursue here. My aim is not just to indicate who the individuals were who carried forth the tradition and in just what manner this tradition is embodied in their writings; I will also show that genuine development does occur and that it leads, by the end of the century, to a much more viable theory. Certain problems inherent in expressionism, when detected, prompted various attempts at resolution. Some of these attempts were ineffectual, others undisputably reactionary; the version offered by Sully-Prudhomme, how- ever, truly "modernized" expressionism and anticipated many of the re- finements normally credited to various twentieth-century theorists. In this connection we can observe the career of Scottish expressionist aesthetics in France passing through three phases. First there was its original formulation, bold and blithe as it was, which I dealt with in my previous paper. Here we begin with the second phase, in which the theory confronts critical scrutiny and its supporters attempt to insulate it against such criticism. This can lead either to the death of the theory or to a third 1 James W.

Manns phase in which it is reformulated more successfully. This latter, I aim to demonstrate, is what in fact occurs. In pursuing this examination I have, for the sake of clarity, placed the thinkers who are under consideration into two groups: (1) the academic community, students of Cousin and Jouffroy who themselves went on to become instructors in the French educational system, and (2) the intellec- tual community, writers, poets, clergymen who published opinions yet were not academics. This manner of grouping the relevant individuals, I must emphasize, is merely an organizational expedient and does not repre- sent factions within the movement; nor is the interplay of ideas restricted to these artificial boundaries. The Academic Community Within this category I treat of five individuals: Charles Leveque, Adol- phe Garier, Francisque Bouillier, Joseph Tissot, and Emile Saisset. The work of Leveque merits extraordinary attention since it exerted propor- tionately that much greater an influence than did the writings of any of the others, and since it reveals a much deeper concern with the problems in the theory. Charles Leveque, a professor of Greek and Latin philosophy at the College de France, who became a member of the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques in 1865, was without a doubt the principal academic perpetuator of the Scottish aesthetic doctrine. His version of the theory was presented in a two-volume work entitled La Science du beau, etudiee dans sesprincipes, dans ses applications et dans son histoire.2 To understand where Leveque stands with respect to the tradition, let us look first at his understanding of the notion of commonsense-the term by which Reid's philosophy had come to be known-for Leveque makes frequent allusion to common sense (le sens commun) or to "the man of common sense." For Reid a commonsense judgment was one which carried its own evi- dence with it and thus required no rational justification. Indeed, such a judgment would not even permit of any rational justification, since this would imply that there were other more basic principles from which a commonsense judgment could be shown to follow. But commonsense judgments are themselves the most basic principles possible. They can be recognized and elucidated but not demonstrated.3 Examples of such 2 Charles Leveque, La Science du beau, etudiee dans sesprincipes, dans ses applications, et dans son histoire (2 vols.; Paris, 1861). A second edition was produced, slightly amended, under the title La Science du beau; ses principes, ses applications et son histoire (Paris, 1872). Prizes awarded the work by the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, the Academie Franqaise, and the Academie des Beaux Arts are mentioned in the appendix to the second edition. 3 For a detailed treatment of this topic see Edward H. Madden, "The Metaphilosophy of Commonsense," American Philosophical Quarterly, 20 (1983), 23-36.</page><page sequence="3">French Aesthetics 105 judgments in the epistemological domain are that objects appear to us in space and time, or that events in the world are always the effects of certain causes. There is no proving the spatio-temporal aspect of experience or the causal interconnectedness of things, according to Reid, for there is simply no way we can fail to experience things under these aspects. In the aesthetic domain there seem to be only two propositions to which Reid is willing to grant the status of first principles of commonsense: that beauty has first principles and that beauty (like any quality) is properly attributed to the beautiful object and not the judging subject. Leveque bases many of his conclusions on what common sense dic- tates, or on what "the man of common sense" would accept or reject, approve or disapprove. Further, he adopts an addendum to the theory, introduced by Dugald Stewart and developed by Jouffroy, which calls upon ordinary language to be the arbiter on various philosophical issues. Abuse of ordinary language, they believed, could only lead to absurd philosophical positions.4 Strict obedience to the dictates of ordinary lan- guage constituted, therefore, a necessary condition of the adequacy of any philosophical explanation. So Leveque repeatedly finds support for his views in virtue of the fact (or at least the claim) of their conformity with the way people normally speak about works of art or beautiful things. Nevertheless, we find Leveque's "common man" assenting to more propositions, and to a more controversial set of propositions, than Reid's ever did. Examples of these are the idea that beauty has an internal principle-a much more metaphysical and obscure notion than Reid's "first principles of beauty"-or that this principle involves the manifesta- tion of some spirit or life force (a component of Reid's overall theory, to be sure, but decidedly not one of its commonsense principles).5 It can be concluded, therefore, that while Leveque still stands within the common- sense metaphilosophical tradition, his own understanding of that tradition includes some post-Reidean developments, unfortunately combined with a certain diminution of philosophical rigor. Yet on the whole the basic aesthetic theory outlined by Reid and developed by Cousin and Jouffroy remains alive and well in Leveque's version of it. For all of them beauty is directly and literally attributable to the moral interior of man, of nature, and of art. The normal manner by which we become aware of this interior is for it to be expressed through external signs, and the normal recipient of our attribution of beauty is the object on whose surface these signs appear. This alleged inner-outer relationship comes to receive much of Leveque's attention, for it consti- tutes the element in the theory which is most susceptible to criticism. 4 For more on this see Edward H. Madden and James W. Manns, "Theodore Jouffroy's Contributions to the Commonsense Tradition," Journal of the History of Philosophy, 25 (1987), 574-77. 5 Leveque, Science du beau (2nd ed.), I, 8.</page><page sequence="4">106 James W. Manns Another area in which Leveque adds something of his own to the tradition is his list of eight elements which anything beautiful will be said to possess.6 The list itself, drawn from his contemplation of a lily, is somewhat banal, amounting almost to the union of the sets of properties singled out by any number of aesthetic theories as being central constit- uents of beauty. It includes grandeur, unity, variety, harmony, proportion, color, grace, and suitability (convenance). Perhaps to enhance the credibil- ity of these eight, he explicitly rules out a few others-magnificence, simplicity, elegance, majesty-or rather, he absorbs them into one or another of the original eight; and he divides them into two major categories in each of which one dominant idea prevails. One such category is that of "grandeur," which contains itself as well as unity, and variety; the other is "order," which contains harmony, proportion, color, grace, and suitability.7 While none of his predecessors had produced anything like such an enumeration, the basic commitments of the Scottish theory never- theless appear throughout Leveque's arguments. For example, the gran- deur of the lily is a sign of the "vital force or activity of life,"8 while unity is also a sign of life une unite vivante), etc.9 The entire second volume of Leveque's work is devoted to an applica- tion of this expression theory to the several arts. Art in general is held by him to be "the interpretation of the beautiful soul or the beautiful power by means of their most expressive signs, that is to say, by means of ideal forms."10 The notion of ideal forms owes some of its inspiration to Cousin's aesthetics. Although there is little in this analysis of art that would be of any great surprise to the reader, credit is nevertheless due Leveque for being the first thinker within this tradition to produce a thorough, orderly treatment of this aspect of the theory. And like many a nineteenth-century theorist, he cannot resist ranking the arts in the order of their importance. Considering the interaction between the degree of beauty possessed by the soul or power expressed and the power with which such an expression is effected,11 Leveque manages to come up with an order which follows precisely the same sequence as that reached through considerably different means by Hegel, ascending from architecture at the lower end to poetry at the higher. Concerning the inner-outer relationship and the problems which sur- round it, Leveque tries out a few different approaches in an effort to deal with some of the criticism it had been receiving. With respect to human beauty the problem, simply put, is this: how can it be that Socrates is ugly and Alexander is handsome? If the outer man really expresses the inner 6 Ibid., 18-49. 'Ibid., 49-51. 8 Ibid., 19. 9 Ibid., 28. Translations, unless otherwise indicated, are my own. 10 Ibid., II, 8. "Ibid., 14.</page><page sequence="5">French Aesthetics 107 man, then Socrates' beautiful soul should presumably show through, while Alexander's exterior should bespeak only his bellicose ambitiousness. To begin with, Leveque urges a distinction between physical and moral beauty. Both do express the soul, but they are held to express different functions or aspects of it, the former manifesting some "force vitale" through "health, ... vigor ... proportion,"12 the latter revealing the power of moral righteousness. Alexander's lust for conquest might, in those days at least, have translated into a certain physical beauty, while Socrates' conduct might represent moral beauty. Can the theory survive this simple division? In recommending a two-dimensional iconography, Leveque appar- ently lays a foundation for placing the two kinds of beauty at odds with one another, while offering no suggestions as to how such a conflict might be resolved. Quite briefly, some very sickly people can exhibit great moral resolve, while some very healthy, energetic people are extremely greedy and ruthless. Are individuals of each type both beautiful and ugly? This would not be acceptable to most of the proponents of the theory (even Leveque himself speaks against it elsewhere, as we shall see), for they want to hold that, at bottom, inner moral beauty somehow renders the whole person beautiful. Thus even if it were clear and undeniable that the soul does have these distinctly different faculties, the Socrates-Alexander problem would not be resolved by this first distinction. A second point brings us no closer to a solution of the present diffi- culty. Leveque argues that the discrepancy between the outer Socrates and the inner Socrates actually confirms the general contention of the expression theory, since the mere fact that we do register a certain discord between the two indicates that we take certain facial configurations to be expressive of certain states of mind. If we had no disposition at all to "read" faces in this fashion, we would never come to acknowledge that any discord actually exists. Yet in any case the discord still exists. A third position that Leveque offers and seems to take very seriously views the body not as the immediate and necessary expression of the soul, but as contingently linked to it-almost like a shell (my characterization) through which the soul must at times struggle to manifest itself. As a result, it turns out that "not all faces are equally suitable for the manifesta- tion of moral beauty."13 Clearly, one with pronounced irregularities, such as Socrates', would be disadvantaged from the outset. "Mozart observed," he tells us "that the same music would sound better on a better instru- ment,"14 implying that moral resolve, say, would show up more clearly on a regular face than on a distorted one. This position seems ill taken for a couple of reasons. For one, it can 12 Ibid., I, 286. 3 Ibid., 67. 14Ibid., 306.</page><page sequence="6">108 James W. Manns only weaken the already disputed "language of natural signs" thesis: now we are being called upon to decide whether a certain feature truly reveals a particular state of mind or whether it is in fact concealing or at least obscuring another (perhaps contradictory) one. In addition, the irregulari- ties are sometimes needed to bring out a certain virtue. The severely handicapped person who succeeds in life and achieves what his "normal" cohorts cannot quite manage is lauded precisely because of the way in which he has overcome his handicap. Were he less disadvantaged as a person, his achievements would be less laudable. This might even be the case with Socrates. Perhaps Leveque fares best when he simply asserts that Socrates was beautiful after all. A cold, stone bust of Socrates might not convey too full an impression of him, but "when he became animated in conversing with his disciples, it requires very little effort on our part to imagine him as being beautiful."15 Indeed, it does reflect a pathological shallowness on our part to regard only regular features, glassy blue eyes (now available at any optometrist's), and dimpled chins as hallmarks of beauty. The aberrant sense of "beautiful people" which has sprung up in recent years can easily be overridden by a much longer tradition of calling beautiful those who bear the stamp of virtue or moral resolve. The principal diffi- culty with Leveque's four different approaches to this one problem is deciding which is the preferred one. They are not all compatible with one another, yet no grounds are ultimately given for treating one of them as the definitive resolution of the problem. Natural beauty proves no less problematic than human beauty. In fact it is a bit more so; for while we have at our disposal any amount of non-aesthetic testimony as to Socrates' nobleness, against which we can check and confirm his aesthetic traits or which at least invites us to "look closer" to find his real beauty, nature offers us only its surface and nothing more. Leveque's loosening of the bond between body and spirit, damaging as it was in the human domain, becomes positively bizarre when applied to nature. He claims, for example, that in the case of the lion the inner-outer relationship is at its most accurate and appropriate, while in that of the elephant, in whose crude form is contained (allegedly) a noble interior, it is at its worst.16 One wonders, from this, just what should an elephant look like? And where could we possible go in order to find out? For a theory which holds that God expresses himself through nature, the ugly in nature poses a special problem-in effect the aesthetic correla- tive to the problem of evil in theology. Leveque gives this matter more attention than any of his predecessors, but he again manages to come up with a pair of answers that are not easily reconciled. One approach shows clearly the imprint of Leibniz, whose philosophy enjoyed a bit of a revival 15Ibid., 64. 16Ibid., 332-33.</page><page sequence="7">French Aesthetics 109 among spiritualists in France around mid-century.17 Leveque claims "there are thus active, immaterial forces throughout matter [Jouffroy, note, always spoke of "la force" in the singular], ... but the action of these forces is not equally powerful in all bodies [just as monads, for Leibniz, perceived at varying levels of efficacy and comprehensiveness] ... and it is in their varying degrees of active power that we measure the beauty of inanimate bodies."18 And obviously since animate, non-human nature is governed by "infallible instinct,"19 a similar gradation should follow from the distribution of active powers, following Leibniz's hierar- chy, which rises from sensation through apperception and consciousness to rationality. Since the ugly is seen as the opposite of the beautiful, it is easy to arrive at the conclusion that it would consist in the privation of beauty.20 Yet Leveque argues elsewhere that the ugly is not pure negation but has something positive and definite about it: "the ugly is a force acting or living with a certain power," but acting "in grave disorder," indeed "real- izing by all its powers all the disorder that it can realize without perishing immediately."21 Leveque's two accounts of the ugly in nature thus boil down to the absence of vital force and vital force gone berserk. As with his different approaches to human beauty, there are no obvious grounds on which to decide whether or why he might have preferred one over the other. In a word, then, many aspects of the Scottish expressionist theory remain problematic, despite Leveque's considerable efforts to resolve them. Among other academic figures in this tradition, Adolphe Gamier was probably Jouffroy's most devoted pupil, "present," as Garier himself remarked, "at his first and at his final lecture."22 He was a professor of philosophy at the Ecole Normale and the Sorbonne, and he moved on finally to the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques, assuming the position vacated by Toqueville. His writings are strongly laced with intro- 17 "Spiritualism is the name of the school of thought to which most of the philosophers owing some debt to Reid belonged. The term was first employed by Cousin, who offered it as a substitute for "eclecticism," the name which he had originally attached to his philosophy. For Cousin's own rationale for this change in appellations see Victor Cousin, The True, the Beautiful and the Good, tr. O. W. Wight (New York, 1860), 9-11. Of course different individuals imparted different shadings to spiritualism (including some pejorative ones from their critics), but they all seem to agree in their rejection of materialism, nineteenth-century positivism and idealistic pantheism. 18 Leveque, Science du beau, I, 351-52. 19 Ibid., 297. 20 And, we might add, given the Leibnizean tone, the whole System of Nature would still be supremely beautiful precisely because of the infinite diversity of its constituent forces, all unified in the divine consciousness. Leveque never got quite this far, though. 21 First quote from Leveque, Science du beau, 202; second quote, Ibid., 205-6. 22 Adolphe Garier, "Sur les travaux philosophique de M Jouffroy," College de France etfacultks: discours d'overture (Paris, 1842), V, 4-5.</page><page sequence="8">110 James W. Manns spective, psychological analyses, which represented the aspect of the Scot- tish philosophy passed on to him by Jouffroy. Gamier devotes considerable attention to aesthetic matters in the fourth book of his five-volume Traite desfacultes de l'ame (under "Inclina- tions which relate to non-personal objects").23 There he outlines the ex- pression theory characteristic of the Scottish school: "The elements of beauty which can be perceived are grandeur, form, color, movement, and sound.... These elements ... come to be beautiful only when they are exterior signs of a moral or intelligible beauty."24 He finds some moral or intellectual element underlying all that we find beautiful in nature, man, and art. As we might expect, where irrationality and evil make themselves manifest, we find ourselves in the presence of the ugly.25 It is art which receives the bulk of Gamier's attention, as he attempts to show how the peculiarities of each artistic medium conduce in different ways to the expression of some spiritual content. It bears noting that of all Reid's French followers, Garier is the most emphatic in reaffirming Reid's claim regarding the objectivity of beauty: "We must not," he asserts, "confuse the quality of the object with the pleasure or love that it arouses in our soul."26 A few other individuals merit at least brief acknowledgment. Joseph Tissot was a professor of philosophy who ultimately became dean of the University of Dijon. His principal contributions to French philosophy were his translations of most of Kant's major works. He also authored a biography of Jouffroy. His dissertation, prepared under Jouffroy's direc- tion, is entitled Du Beau, particulierement en litterature.27 In this disserta- tion, it is worth noting, he adapts Reid's argumentation concerning the objectivity of beauty to a demonstration that beauty is not merely objective but absolute. Francisque Bouillier was an important academic figure-director of the Ecole Normale from 1867-70 and a philosopher very much in the Scottish tradition. His modest treatment of aesthetic matters, which ap- pears in Du Plaisir et de la douleur, has to do with the essential role played by sympathy in aesthetic response.28 Thus it must be judged that his debt in this area is owed more to Jouffroy than to Reid. Emile Saisset was one of Cousin's many disciples. He taught philoso- phy first at the Ecole Normale then, beginning in 1853, at the College de France. He published a lengthy essay on "L'esthetique franqaise," which 23 Adolphe Garier, Traite desfacultes de l'ame (3 vols.; Paris, 1852), I, 233-95. 24Ibid., 234. 25 Ibid., 275. 26Ibid., 290. 27 Joseph Tissot, Du Beau, particulierement en litterature (Dole, 1831), 28. 28 Francisque Bouillier, Du Plaisir et de la douleur (Paris, 1865).

I consider here works from four individuals: C. A. Saint-Beuve, Alphonse Dumont, Prosper Gaborit, and Rene F.-A. Sully-Prudhomme. Although each represents a quite different set of intel- lectual (and spiritual) commitments, the four nevertheless share a com- mon perspective regarding the question of what makes beautiful things beautiful. Charles-Augustin Sainte-Beuve was a poet early in his life and a critic later on. It is principally for his criticism, however, that he is known to posterity. His Causeries du Lundi and Nouveaux Lundis-critical essays which appeared regularly in, first, the Constitutionnel, then subsequently the Moniteur and Temps-constitute twenty-eight volumes of insightful reflections ranging over a remarkable variety of topics from individuals to works to movements to events. In addition, he produced several vol- umes of literary portraits and (perhaps his magnum opus) the immense Port Royal, a religious, literary, and intellectual history of the seventeenth century in France effected through a "biography" of the convent at Port Royal. A member of the Academie Franqaise, he was for some time a librarian in the Mazarine. Sainte-Beuve was a student of Jouffroy's-one of that select band of auditors who regularly squeezed into Jouffroy's apartment-and he did attend the latter's lectures on aesthetics. As a result of this exposure 29 Emile Saisset, L'Ame et la vie, suivi d'un examen critique de l'esthetique franqaise (Paris, 1864), 91-167. 30 One other individual who likely should figure into this enumeration is Philibert Damiron. Professor of philosophy first at the Ecole Normale (from 1821), then later at the Sorbonne, Damiron was an ever faithful follower of Cousin and was Jouffroy's closest friend. He was present when Jouffroy offered his aesthetics course, and was responsible for the publication of this course after Jouffroy's death. He did apparently put forward something of an aesthetic theory, which occurred at the end of his Memoire sur Diderot (Paris, 1852). The memoir was presented as a series of lectures at the Academie des Sciences Morales et Politiques and was also published among their Seances et travaux (Paris, 1852). Given Damiron's alliances and allegiances, it is hard to imagine that his theory did not contain strong elements of the Scottish tradition, hence I signal its existence here. However, all printed versions of the memoir terminate with the following notice: "The memoir concludes with an extended discussion of Diderot's aesthetics, and a general appreciation of his philosophy, which lack of space prevents us from printing." Thus, unless the original manuscript one day surfaces, his contributions to the tradition are lost for good.</page><page sequence="10">112 James W. Manns elements of Jouffroy's teaching are detectable both in Sainte-Beuve's criti- cism and especially in his reflections on critical method. Actually the strongest intimations of the Scottish tradition are to be found in one of Sainte-Beuve's earliest works, his Vie, poesies etpensees de Joseph Delorme. There, among the pensees, is a virtual precis of Jouffroy's aesthetic theory (poetically enriched, of course): The artistic sentiment implies a lively and intimate feel for things. While the majority of men rest content with surfaces and appearances; while the philoso- phers, properly so called, recognize a certain something [je ne sais quoi] beyond phenomena, whose nature, however, they cannot determine, the artist, as if endowed with a separate sense, quietly goes about feeling, beneath the world of appearances, the other world-wholly interior-of which most are ignorant, and whose existence the philosopher no more than asserts; he is present amidst the invisible play of forces, and sympathizes with them as with (genuine) souls; he received at birth the key to the realm of symbols and the knowledge of forms; what seems incoherent and contradictory to others is for him only a harmonic contrast... .31 In Sainte-Beuve's post-1849 critical writings that aspect of his thinking that remains in line with the tradition under examination here has to do with his search for some kind of spiritual interior which an artist expresses through his work and which a critic must then try to bring to the surface. While apparently no theist in the mold of Cousin or Jouffroy, Sainte-Beuve nevertheless finds this notion of a hidden inner self indispensable in crit- icism. Yet too often it seems that readers of Sainte-Beuve are taken up with his emphasis on amassing great amounts of information about an author and the environing circumstances of his creation, and tend to see him as something of a deviant positivist ("deviant" because he still believes criti- cism will always have an element of "art" to it) rather than a maverick spiritualist. He did characterize himself as a "botanist of minds," and suggested that "it is to [the study of medicine] that I owe the philosophical spirit, the love of precision....."32 But his love for-or need for-mpreci- sion traces back to Jouffroy. In a well known piece on Chateaubriand in which Sainte-Beuve dis- cusses critical method he sounds very much like a nineteenth-century positivist in recommending: "It is useful at the outset to begin at the beginning, and wherever possible, to place the superior or distinguished author in his homeland, within his race."33 The same is true when he offers a long list of questions that we should ask about any author: 31 C.-A. Sainte-Beuve, Vie, poesies et pensees de Joseph Delorme, ed. Gerard Antoine (Paris, 1954), Pensee No. 18, 150. 32 Both citations occur in Lander MacClintock, Sainte-Beuve's Critical Theory and Practice after 1849 (Chicago, 1920); the first, 30; the second, 28. 33 C.-A.

How was he affected by the spectacle of nature?-How did he behave where women were concerned? Where money was concerned?-Was he rich? Was he poor?-What was his diet, his day to day style of life? etc.-Finally, what was his principal vice or weakness? Every man has one.34 Yet in posing such questions he does not intend just to spin off a few facile generalizations and be done. Instead, he believes that such a procedure recommends itself because of the valuable light it sheds on "la qualite secrete et essentielle des esprits."35 Reid and his earliest French followers allow this quality to remain secret (recall, in the long quotation from Sainte-Beuve the quality "whose existence the philosopher no more than asserts"). The spiritualist move- ment, however, grew increasingly anxious to "know" the secret. And as was the case with Leveque, they occasionally turned to Leibniz for an- swers. Sainte-Beuve seems to have remained in touch with the movement, as from time to time he waxes quite Leibnizean. Indeed, the previous quotation, in addressing an essential quality of this or that mind, sounds quite Leibnizean (since Leibniz theorized that each individual substance or soul had an essential nature, and from this nature followed the totality of its states). Placing the passage in question alongside one in which Sainte-Beuve refers to the poet's "Miroir a lui... sa monade individuelle unique ..." strengthens this impression.36 This Leibnizean turn which Sainte-Beuve and certain of the latter day spiritualists took goes beyond the limits of fruitful inquiry as proposed by Reid. Nevertheless, it is not in any strict way incompatible with Reid's convictions, and it does constitute an interesting corollary to an expression theory of art. Among the other versions of expressionism, a small Etude sur l'esthe'- tique was published in 1876 by one Alphonse Dumont. It offers a concise statement of the theory and perhaps aims to reaffirm Jouffroy's stance over and against some of its subsequent "refinements." Dumont strenuously affirms that beauty must always have some perceptible component and can never be apprehended by the intellect alone. This is true, he holds, for what would be termed moral beauty, and even for God; inasmuch as God is imperceptible, to speak of him as beautiful is to fall into anthropo- morphism.37 God may be the principle behind all natural beauty, but the principle itself is in no way to be termed beautiful. Although there are moral beauties, it is noteworthy that Dumont asserts that there are morally upright spectacles that are not at all beauti- ful-the sight of a peasant cultivating his field, for example.38 He thus 34Ibid., 28. 35Ibid., 18. 36 Ibid., VIII, 93. The word "monade" is in fact emphasized in his text. 37 Alphonse Dumont, Etude sur l'esthetique (Paris, 1876), 42. 38 Ibid., 29.</page><page sequence="12">114 James W Manns "de-moralizes" beauty, analyzing it only in terms of the expression of power and order, although surely "human nature that we deem beautiful must ... in no way contravene the moral law."39 And he stresses the role of rationality as a necessary though never a sufficient condition for discerning beauty; it is our senses which bring expressive signs to our attention, but our reason which is responsible for interpreting them.40 Prosper Gaborit, though a teacher for most of his life, nevertheless deserves to be treated separately from the other academics. While all those previously considered here taught philosophy in the French educational system, Gaborit taught design and architecture at a small seminary in Nantes. It is thus doubly surprising to find him upholding the Scottish aesthetic tradition. In strictly chronological terms it is he who carries it furthest, as his shorter treatise on the subject, La Connaissance du beau, appeared in 1899, while his major work, Le Beau dans la nature et dans les arts, first published in 1871, was reissued as late as 1913. In elaborating the basic tenets of expressionism, Gaborit is most likely to cite Cousin or Jouffroy, but in refining the theory it is Leveque toward whom he remains principally oriented. This is not to suggest that Gaborit is an obedient follower of Leveque, for indeed he often endeavors to smooth out difficulties embedded in the latter's version of expressionism. Proceeding from the fundamental conviction that "la beaute est l'expres- sion de l'activite qui s'est developpe selon la loi,"4' Gaborit subdivides beauty, taken generically, into three categories: (a) the graceful (gracieux), that which develops in accord with its own nature, as do animals, plants, and even minerals; (b) the beautiful (strictly speaking), free intelligent activity, human activity; and (c) the sublime, nature taken as a whole, surpassing human comprehension.42 He appeals to this categorical scheme several times as a means out of one difficulty or another. Human beauty-beauty in its strict sense-is linked to moral activity. Wary of the problems Leveque had in this area, Gaborit goes to consider- able length to reaffirm a strong connection between inner (moral) states and their outward expressions. Though he finds the claims of phrenology to be unacceptable, he still argues for a close correspondence between the "look" one's face projects and one's moral character-a correspondence which he takes, as did Reid, to have been established by God. Perhaps Gaborit overstates his position when he claims that "a person's carriage, voice, and gestures never contradict one another,"43 for more often than 39Ibid., 30. 40 Ibid., 4. 41 Prosper Gaborit, La Connaissance du beau (Paris, 1899), 39.

Gaborit deals with the Socrates-Alexander problem considered earlier by appealing to the distinction between the graceful and the beautiful. Alexander, being physically well proportioned and conforming favorably with our typology of what a human being should look like, could be proclaimed graceful, but Gaborit reiterates that it is only where moral qualities come into consideration that judgments of beauty become appro- priate; hence we might well refrain from calling Alexander beautiful but should have no qualms about finding Socrates so. In dealing with natural creatures which we find beautiful, Gaborit takes care to avoid the kind of anthropomorphism (his term) to which Leveque fell prey.45 He distinguishes between those qualities we detect in, say, a lion or a horse and those we attribute to them. We can detect a certain measure of intelligence in such creatures; but reason, apperception, and will are nowhere to be found and therefore are merely attributed. Such attributions may serve poetic ends, but in this fashion they would only function symbolically and should never be taken to constitute a direct expression of the moral temperament of the animal. Under the threefold schema Gaborit recommends, such beauty as we do apprehend in certain creatures falls into the category of the graceful. The question remains why we do not find slugs and bacteria even to be graceful, since they too develop "selon la loi," and they too reflect the divine order as adequately as a horse or gazelle. Nor is it clear why the attributions we do make can ever function symbolically-the ground of such symbolism has yet to be laid. A final aspect of Gaborit's thinking which deserves to be underscored is his moralistic approach to the beautiful. This is present in certain of his predecessors, notably Cousin, but is developed much more fully and emphatically by Gaborit. "Love of beauty," he holds, "can only be salu- tory," "beauty lights up our intelligence .. ." and "leads us to love the good."46 And good art-from which (again following Cousin) he excludes moralistic, "preachy" art-is "a great power, and can contribute in large to strengthening our moral sense and leading us to admire what is truly worthy of our love and esteem."47 Expressionist aesthetics received its most significant reinterpretation 44Ibid., 41, 52. 45 Ibid., 23-25. 46Ibid., 64-67. 47 Gaborit, Le Beau dans la nature, II, 49.</page><page sequence="14">116 James W. Manns from Rene F.-A. Sully-Prudhomme, who first dared to interpret "expres- sion" in a manner that did not require in any literal sense a spirit of some sort exteriorizing itself through material reality. For the first time in the tradition, therefore, an expressionist aesthetics is offered which does not demand a theistic metaphysics as a necessary correlate. Following this bold innovation, he rearranged the key notions within the theory so as to retain a consistent doctrine. Known principally as a poet not a philosopher, Sully-Prudhomme was the first recipient of the Nobel Prize in literature in 1901. Born in 1839, he was a student neither of Cousin nor Jouffroy; however, the parallels between the aesthetic theory which he develops in L'Expression dans les beaux-arts and theirs-particularly Jouffroy's-is too striking to be writ- ten off as coincidence. For Sully-Prudhomme expression still involves the relationship between the exterior of a thing (taking "thing" in a sense broad enough to include people, plants, rocks, statues, symphonies, etc.) and its "interior," a term which he restructures considerably. He prefers the term "interior" (he speaks of "interieur" or "fond") over Jouffroy's "l'invisible," reasoning that we can apprehend the exterior of an object through any of our senses, not just sight, so a visible-invisible distinction might be misleading."48 But even "interior" turns out to be more a meta- phor than a technical term to be taken literally. In the years since Cousin and Jouffroy were active, the materialist- positivist element in French thinking had grown considerably in influence. From this latter perspective souls or life forces are nothing other than philosophical fictions. Sully-Prudhomme was no positivist, but neither was he a spiritualist; he simply refused to set foot on this particular battle ground, claiming "c'est affaire aux metaphysiciens." Yet he is promulgat- ing an expression theory of art which seems to demand that he adhere to some interior-exterior distinction. How does he manage this? He observes that we do systematically distinguish in the language between two classes of phenomena-the mental or spiritual and the mate- rial. Indeed, we have at present no vocabulary which effectively material- izes mind and its activities. Therefore, whichever side eventually wins (if any final victory is even possible), speaking in terms of some exterior- interior relationship can not only be understood by anyone regardless of philosophical commitments, it is in fact the only effective means at hand for dealing with a huge class of highly significant phenomena. In Sully- Prudhomme's own words, "[w]hen we thus speak of the soul and the body, of the faculties of the soul, of spirit and matter,... these terms have no metaphysical significance to us, and serve only to distinguish, within 48 Rene F.-A. Sully-Prudhomme, L'Expression dans les beaux-arts (Paris, 1883). See 55, and especially 190. Note also that he does not refer to Jouffroy by name here or anywhere else, nor does he mention the name of a single other philosopher throughout the entire book.</page><page sequence="15">French Aesthetics 117 the domain of human activity, between two empirically distinct classes of phenomena...."49 Even today reductionistic materialism is hardly in a position to make a stronger claim than this. With such an adjustment to the inner-outer distinction, Sully- Prudhomme is obliged to adjust the concept of expression accordingly. While Reid, Jouffroy, and the others saw expression as effected through natural signs both in nature and in human activities, Sully-Prudhomme urges a sharp distinction between the processes of signification and expres- sion. Signs, he claims, can be purely conventional, as in most of our verbal discourse; or they may be habitual and associational, as with certain gestures such as a shake of the head indicating negation or disapproval, but neither of these can properly be called expressive. This clearly anticipates another important refinement to expressionism which has been urged many times this century (by Collingwood and Dewey among others), that betraying emotions through natural signs or symptoms is quite different from expressing emotions through works of art. This has now become commonplace, but in Sully-Prudhomme's time it constituted quite a radi- cal departure. Sully-Prudhomme contends that for genuine expression to occur, there must be some identity of character between the vehicle and the object of expression.50 This identity is shared by two distinct domains, those of sensible perception and of consciousness or affection (etats moraux).51 These two states might not initially appear very distinct, but let us keep in mind that sensible perception links us to and informs us of the outer world. In characterizing the apprehension of external nature, Sully- Prudhomme develops a theory reminiscent of Reid's position on the sec- ondary qualities of bodies when he refers to the causal interaction between a subject and the world which produces certain sensations in that subject, who then reasonably attributes the quality of this sensation back to the occasioning object.52 Therefore, while the most succinct statement of his theory presents sense perception as one essential component of expression, it is not surprising that in his characterizations of expressive situations he frequently refers to items we normally regard as independently existing objects: the tree which droops limply as we do when we are sorrowful and is thus called a weeping willow; the melody which bounces about as we do when we are in high spirits and is thus termed a lively melody. Briefly, 49Ibid., 181. 50 These points are developed in Chapters 6 and 7 of this work, 71-91. 51 Ibid., 79. "Etats moraux" is a broader term by far than what we might understand by "moral states." It comprehends, according to Sully-Prudhomme, "ideas, volitions and passions"-all, that is, that is linked to the three faculties of intelligence, will and "le coeur." 52 Ibid., Chaps. 2-4, 47-63. Concerning Reid's treatment of secondary qualities, see James Manns, "Beauty and Objectivity in Thomas Reid," British Journal of Aesthetics, 28 (1988), 120-28.</page><page sequence="16">118 James W. Manns for object A to be expressive of emotional state S, there need only exist a certain congruence between A and S, and there need not be any conscious effort on the part of some subject to express S through A. Therefore nature itself may be seen to have expressive qualities without being regarded as the vehicle through which God makes himself manifest. To support this revised notion of expression, Sully-Prudhomme reaches into the language itself-"an unimpeachable witness for human- ity"-to testify to the "profound and subtle analogy which exists between sense perception and our affective states."53 He comes up with an immense chart detailing just where the descriptions we apply to what we sense are carried over into the domain of human feeling and indicating which senses are the principal carriers of which ascriptions.54 However, this analysis contains a potentially grave problem, for while Sully-Prudhomme alleges that expression is dependent on the identity between perceptual and affective states, identity is itself a reflexive rela- tionship. If a certain kind of tree can be seen as expressive of a certain feeling state, there seems to be nothing to prevent this feeling state from being construed as expressive of a certain kind of tree. An absurdity of this magnitude would surely render the theory unacceptable, but Sully- Prudhomme wards off this threat by posing as the other essential compo- nent of expression the notion of sympathy. Sympathy involves "a tendency, on the part of the affective component of the soul, to recognize something of its own properties in a physical sensation," and Sully-Prudhomme alleges that it constitutes the "founda- tion of all expression."55 Indeed, in his approach it does occupy a pivotal position, for without sympathy we would apparently have but two parallel isomorphic states coexisting in isolation from one another (even though occupying positions, in some sense, in one and the same conscious subject). Our disposition to sympathize, however, produces a felt recognition of the congruence between these states, and only where such a felt recognition is involved are we justified in attributing expressiveness to the object sensed. Our feeling states could therefore never be expressive of the tree because the tree lacks the capacity to sympathize. Only for a conscious, affective subject could an object such as a tree prove expressive. And so, while identity might indeed be a reflexive relationship, expression is strictly one directional. Not just our fellow man, but virtually anything is capable of eliciting a sympathetic response from us. Indeed, herein lies the secret power of art which enables stone, paint, and clusters of sound to become expressive for us. Sully-Prudhomme distinguishes between subjective and objective art 53Ibid., 80. 54Ibid., 80-87. 55 Ibid., 95.</page><page sequence="17">French Aesthetics 119 but not between expressive and non-expressive art: "all art is expres- sive. ..; every artist is thus moved, through sympathy, to endow his work with expression."56 When the work expresses feelings proper to the artist himself, it is termed subjective; when the feelings expressed by the work are not the artist's own (however much he must be in sympathy with them to produce the work), it is objective. Painting and sculpture, from this perspective, are the most inherently objective arts, for their representa- tional nature most easily imposes certain objective necessities upon the artist; music and architecture, accordingly, are the most subjective, allowing the interior of the artist to make its way most directly into the medium.57 This distinction opens the way for non-romantic expressionist theories-those which acknowledge that not everything which a work can be said to express emerges directly from the private consciousness of the artist. We have seen many such theories offered in the present century. In sum, Sully-Prudhomme's most salient innovations involve carving out a theory which allows us to speak meaningfully about the expressive- ness of all manner of objects without thereby committing ourselves to a particular set of theistic beliefs; drawing a sharp distinction between be- traying emotion and expressing it, in the aesthetically relevant sense; insisting that there be some congruence detectable between the emotion expressed and the object that expresses it; and distinguishing between objective and subjective approaches to art. Throughout his study Sully- Prudhomme remains closely oriented toward the Scottish tradition: art and beauty are still meaningfully termed expressive, expressiveness is still seen to involve, in some sense, an inner-outer relationship, and the concept of sympathy is still assigned a critical role in the overall theory. However, a number of his most important conclusions land him somewhat beyond the bounds of that tradition. Viewing his contributions retrospectively, it appears that he has done what any good heir does-inherited the family fortune and passed it on to the next generation somewhat the richer. The result was that expressionism shook off its cobwebs and stood ready to confront the twentieth century with renewed vigor. University of Kentucky. 56 Ibid., 230. 57 Ibid., 271.</page></plain_text>
