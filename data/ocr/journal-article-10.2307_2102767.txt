New York, Live- right Publishing Corporation, 1940. Pp. viii, 158. Wolfgang Kbhler's two latest books deserve the attention of phenomenologists for several reasons. Relations between Gestalt psy- chology and phenomenology have always been friendly, if not very far developed. As far as they have met on psychological ground, the two schools have worked along parallel lines and largely with concord- ant results. Christian von Ehrenfels' "Gestaltqualitaten" had their equivalent in Edmund Husserl's "figurale Momente" or "Einheitsmo- mente."' Gestalt psychology proper, fighting both against behavior- ism and against a prejudiced introspectionism, which attempted to re- duce all phenomena to pure sensory elements, has energetically upheld the part of unadulterated immediate experience.2 By the use of phe- nomenology in the sense of descriptive psychology, as it had been de- veloped in psychology long before phenomenology as a philosophical movement had been started, Gestalt psychology has investigated a large group of hitherto neglected phenomena, notably those designated by the term "Gestalt." But in addition to that, by stressing the part of "insight" in mental processes, it has come close to the phenome- nological concept of insight into essences ("'Wesenseinsicht") and has moreover demonstrated its significance for real thinking and for other psychological problems. Yet, there has been little explicit contact between the two groups. It may be that the anti-psych6logism of Husserl's "Prolegomena" to the Logische Untersuchungen had an unduly deterrent effect. Any- how, from the side of Gestalt psychologists there had been, until re- cently, only occasional and passing references to phenomenology3 and 1. Logische Untersuchungen, 2nd ed., Halle, 1913, vol.

From with- in the phenomenological camp, studies of the relations between Gestalt theory and phenomenology have been offered only in A. Gurwitsch's dissertation on "Phdnomenologie der Thematik und des reinen Ich."4 Kdhler's book on The Place of Value in a World of Facts, an elaboration of the William James Lectures which the author gave at Harvard University in 1934, is noteworthy among other things both for the explicit discussion of phenomenology as a philosophical move- ment, and for concrete phenomenological contributions. Dynamics in Psychology, an enlarged version of the Page-Barbour Lectures de- livered at the University of Virginia in 1938, also contains a few per- tinent passages. The first of the two books, however, is much more ambitious. In its ultimate scope it is a study in natural philosophy. As such it under- takes to determine the locus and the significance of value in the uni- verse. It starts with an eloquent imaginary indictment of science by a layman who argues that science, since it has done away with value ("Wertfreiheit"), is unable to deal with the vital issues of value in life. It is only capable of handling facts, and the facts of science seem to occur indifferently without any regard for values. It is against this conception of science and the resulting anti-intellectualism nowadays so rampant in Europe that the rest of the book is directed. Kbhler realizes that the "crisis of science" has its deepest root in its unwilling- ness and its inability to do justice to values. So his first concern is to make sure of the phenomena of value. The second chapter on "The- ories of Value" sets out to show that the phenomenon which Kbhler calls "requiredness" cannot possibly be denied nor reduced to a mere indifferent natural fact. In the third chapter, "An Analysis of Re- quiredness," Kdhler undertakes to elucidate the structure of this phe- nomenon. But he is not satisfied with the result of such phenomeno- logical analysis. For in his view the world does not consist of phenom- ena alone. Epistemologically he advocates a critical realism that, at least for practical purposes, involves a sharp dualism between a phe- nomenal and a physical world. Value, he pleads, has a place even in this transphenomenal sphere. The basis for this hypothesis is supplied by the principle of isomorphism, according to which there is a certain resemblance between the phenomenal and the physical world in their essential macroscopic structures. Such an isomorphism would also have to obtain in the relations between perceptual phenomena and the physical correlates in the cortex. Eventually, this principle is also ap- plicable to the phenomena of requiredness. Especially in the field of memory Kohler believes that he has definite evidence for requiredness 4. Psychologische Forschung, vol. XII (1929), pp. 279 ff.</page><page sequence="3">REViEWS 375 as residing and operative even in the physical traces: It is, as he calls it, "amphibian" in cases such as that of successive comparison (where a relation is judged with regard to a first term which is no longer pres- ent in our consciousness), or in attempts to recall a forgotten name (where our tentative solutions are judged to be right or wrong by some valuing agent behind the phenomena). A cautious discussion of the facts of organic fitness, it is true, yields no conclusive argument in favor of value as a particular operative principle in the field of biology. It would seem that, if requiredness has any place among the events of organic nature, it must coincide with some known feature of the phys- ical world. In fact the correlates of phenomenal requiredness are eventually identified as specific forces and fields of forces in Faraday's sense. It is obvious how such a parallelism between phenomenal de- mands and physical selective tendencies (411) extends the domain of value by linking it up with the realities of the physical world. This is not the place to discuss the far-reaching implications of such a theory, which is advanced throughout in the spirit of a carefully weighed hypothesis that avoids any dogmatic claims to a "monistic" solution. Kbhler's familiarity with the facts and theories of the nat- ural sciences enables him to support his theory by vast and colorful evidence. This familiarity is equalled only by his keen interest in the phenomenological aspect of the problems. Methodologically, this combination is perhaps most characteristic of the book. On the whole, he avoids successfully the obvious danger of being carried away by either of these interests. Naturally this review proposes to examine only the phenomeno- logical aspects of the book. There are some explicit statements ex- pressing Kbhler's attitude towards phenomenology in general. He looks upon it chiefly as a method (105), consisting in "looking at things themselves," as expressed in the celebrated watchword "Back to the things" (46), and directed against empiricist misinterpretations of phenomena as mere results of habit and learning as well as against evolutionary ones identifying the nature of phenomena with their or- igin. Phenomenological description, the core of this method, has to make sure of the nature and the properties of things before explaining them (70). For "no explanation can change a phenomenon or its lo- cation" (71). K6hler defends phenomenology against the "phobia" of introspectionism, i.e., the distortion of our direct experience by the dogma that such experience is an aggregate of primitive sensory ele- ments plus indirectly attached meanings which the psychologist has to discard (47). He finds, however, some justification in the criticism that Husserl has no clear criterion for the separation of genuine phe- nomenological material and hypothetical additions. Thus Husserl wants</page><page sequence="4">3 8 0 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH us even to "discard" as a "foreign ingredient brought in by naturalistic habits . . . any conviction about existence and occurrence." (Inci- dentally, it is not quite safe to say that Husserl's phenomenological re- duction wants to discard existential beliefs; it wants only to suspend them and remains interested in investigating them as phenomena.) Husserl's evidence for excluding these convictions from the pure phenomenon appears questionable. Nevertheless in Kdhler's view too phenomenology has to precede any attempt at explanation. Both pos- itivism and behaviorism skip this stage which really should be the basis of a consistent positivism., His final expression of qualified adherence should be noted-and heeded: "For our purposes phenomenology is not to be restricted to the realm of logic and timeless entities. If, furthermore, some exponents of phenomenology tend, by their work, to make us believe that their occupation is necessarily sterile, this is their fault, not that of the procedure as such. Even more important, the very vaguest speculation has sometimes found a shelter under the roof of phenomenology. With such aberrations we cannot wish to have any connection" (68). Kbhler's own phenomenological analyses are mostly given in chapters II and III, which form the basis for the transphenomenolog- ical part of the book. These chapters are chiefly concerned with the phenomenology of value or, more generally, of requiredness, a term in- troduced by Max Wertheimer.5 It is meant to include "logic" as well as the values in the narrower sense of the word (37). Kbhler begins with a discussion of a few outstanding theories of this value-phenomenon. Plato's account is rejected as actually elimi- nating value from the real world and confining it to a separate realm of its own without clarifying the essence of the phenomenon under consideration. Kant, who did admit "values" among the facts, never- theless thought that their locus was in the structure of the human mind; and he failed to account for the concrete forms that required- ness assumes. Naturalism, being unable to account for such a phenom- enon, tried to get rid of its last remains with notoriously disastrous results, not only for our civilization but for science itself. It was, in Kdhler's view, Husserl's lasting merit that he reinstated the "intrinsic requiredness" of logic as something more than a mere fact. In an ad- mittedly simplifying statement of Husserl's most relevant insights, special stress is laid on their timeless ideal nature as represented by such truths as "Purple is a visual quality which as such has its place between the red and the blue." Against this modernized Platonism Kbhler 5. "Some Problems in the Theory of Ethics" (Social Research, vol. II, 1935, pp. 353 ff.) The term does not seem to have any definite equivalent in the preceding German literature; it would have to be rendered by "sachliche Gefordertheit."</page><page sequence="5">REVIEWS 3 81 raises two objections. The time-indifference of these truths would not preclude their occurrence in the world of facts unless the meaning of the term fact is unduly restricted. And, secondly, ideal truth has immediate bearing upon the world of facts as exemplified by the tech- nician's calculations: Truth is in this sense "amphibian" (54). Incidentally, it might be pointed out that Husserl's position in this matter is not quite unambiguous. To be sure he is not an outspoken representative of an "amphibian" Aristotelianism. Certainly, "eidos" and individual, though in strict correlation, belong in general to two different spheres. However, when Husserl traces the intuition of these reide" back to the process of ideating abstraction, by which we extri- cate species from individuals (Therausschauen"), one must suspect that they were already somehow inside the individuals. There follows a discussion of various psychologistic attempts to explain away autonomous intrinsic requiredness. K6hler demonstrates their inadequacy by confronting them with very telling counter-ex- amples which fulfil the conditions of the psychologistic accounts while failing to result in requiredness. Chapter III, which gives the actual analysis of requiredness, is of more direct phenomenological significance. It begins with a discussion of Ralph B. Perry's subjectivistic reduction of value to interest and of his biological interpretation of interest itself, a theory which appears to be incapable of doing justice to the phenomena. A real phenomenolog- ical analysis in Kbhler's sense, which penetrates the "cover of everyday staleness," shows interest to possess the peculiar structure of a dynamic Gestalt-organization with a vector directed from a self to an object as its target. At first sight this might seem to be nothing but the familiar structure of intentionality, as developed by Husserl, with its "ego co- gito cogitata mea." Kdhler's view, however, goes beyond Husserl inas- much as in such a context the vector is characterized as a property of the organized system, and the ensuing value-qualities as dependent properties (83, 85). Once this structure has been revealed, there ap- pears, however, to be no reason why such a vector should issue only from the valuing subject, as the subjectivistic theory of requiredness assumes. Besides this subjectivistic account certainly does not agree with the plain man's convictions about value, which Kbhler himself espouses, for instance the value-convictions as represented in love or political hatred. Demands and the accompanying values may just as well issue from the object, though there are definitely cases where value appears as the result of our interest. Accordingly Perry's attempt to explain away objective values as mere "tertiary qualities" projected by the self into the-object and liable to yield to a proper effort of our at- tention, is found to be a case of objectionable introspectionism (80 f.);</page><page sequence="6">3 82 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH phenomenology precludes any such explanation by unconscious projec- tion (80). The Gestalt-structure of requiredness also admits of situ- ations where the demanding vector does not start from the self but from other people who expect us to behave in a certain way. And finally there is requiredness within objective contexts as exemplified by that occurring between the notes of a melody. To refer to a pathetic fal- lacy all the vectors which phenomenally issue from objects is simply a falsification of the phenomena. The analysis of requiredness is further developed in the ninth chapter on "Facts and Forces" (336 if.). This presentation, being more concise and no longer complicated by the parallel discussion of the interest-theory, seems, from a systematic point of view, to deserve preference. According to it, requiredness occurs only within a con- text of other data; it is a dependent characteristic; it has a transcend- ent reference from one datum to others in the context; it shows de- manding character either as acceptance or as rejection; and it some- times assumes a correctionist" attitude (this last feature reminds one to a certain extent of Nikolai Hartmann's "aktuales Sollen"). In view of the lack of adequate analyses of the inner structure of phenom- ena such as oughtness (Sollen) even in phenomenological literature, these accounts of requiredness represent definite phenomenological progress. Admittedly this phenomenological analysis of requiredness and value is a simplified outline, which draws no more distinctions than necessary for the following studies in natural philosophy. If, as here, these limitations are explicitly stated, such a procedure is perfectly legitimate. Yet, in some cases, a more detailed analysis might have affected even the transphenomenal results. Thus by subsuming value under the term requiredness, simple value-predicates receive an over- complicated structure. Aesthetic or ethical value-qualities in them- selves do not imply any requiredness, although they might entail it. Nor would it be plausible that they form the dependent characteristics of a requirement-system. And such value may inhere in any real ob- ject; in fact it occurs primarily here and is not relegated to any ideal realm of values, the connection of which with reality appeared to be so problematical. The situation is certainly different in the case of requiredness as it occurs in the ideal laws of logic which in their essential structure are definitely segregated from reality. Here the problem does arise as to how far such ideal entities can communicate with reality. For instance, once such ideal laws are established and investigated, the question of their significance for real thinking will arise. And a psychology of thinking will certainly have to consider how it is possible that ideal</page><page sequence="7">REVIEWS 3 8 3 entities can direct real thought. The investigations of Gestalt psy- chologists have even supplied definite evidence that in this respect right thinking shows a different structure from wrong thinking, and that in the case of insight time-indifferent logical relationships determine largely, if not exclusively, the course of our thinking.6 This position no longer involves a psychologistic conception of logic but could rather be called a logistic interpretation of psychological data. So long as it is the psychologists themselves who requisition logic for this service, there is no reason to object to such "trespassing." A similar situation arises'from the fact that Kbhler, to this extent still conforming to the subjectivistic account, includes the phenome- non of interest within the scope of requiredness, and that sometimes little distinction is drawn between demands (demanding vectors) and requiredness (which, strictly speaking, could be only the result of such demands). Whereas it is comparatively plausible that interests, valuations, or demands have an isomorphic equivalent in selective forces within the cortex, such an equivalence would still have to be substantiated for value, oughtness, or the ideal laws of logic to which they refer. Furthermore, certain differences among the various types of re- quiredness seem to be somewhat underrated. In cases where we try to remember a name and the one we find is judged as "right" or "wrong" from somewhere behind the phenomena, or in attempts at successive comparison between something absent and something pres- ent we are faced with a requiredness which is only a function of our arbitrary interest in certain data. In other words such requiredness is dependent upon a subjective requiredness, i.e., a requiredness the vector of which issues from the subject. The words "right" and "wrong" as used in such cases of reaching or missing an arbitrarily proposed goal have a meaning entirely different from the case where we apply them to logical conclusions in relation to their premises or to acts of charity or truthfulness; their requiredness seems to be independent of any subjective interests. It might be comparatively easy to conceive of an isomorphic equivalent to requiredness as conditioned by subjective in- terests. But the situation would be at least much more complicated in the case of 'purely objective requiredness whether directed from the object to the subject or confined to the relations of objects among themselves. In such cases further buttressing would be necessary in order to substantiate and to strengthen the isomorphistic theory of re- quirement. Still whatever the isomorphic place of value and objective requirement in the physical world may be, this does not affect their 6.

Another section of the book which deserves the special attention of phenomenologists is Kdhler's transition from the phenomenal to the physical world, which forms the basis of his dualistic critical realism. For, unless the physical world is completely denied, as the phenomenal- ists would have it, even the phenomenologist will have to admit that the scientific world of the physicist looks rather different from the phenomenal one. Kbhler takes great pains to justify this step "beyond phenomenology" (chapter IV) by pointing to "transcendent refer- ences" in the phenomena themselves. And he emphasizes that in our inferences to such a physical world we are confined to the building materials and models supplied by the phenomenal world (143). This point is made particularly clearly in a discussion of Eddington's theory of pointer-readings. As transcendent references which, like bridges, rest on one side on the phenomenal world while their other end remains in the darkness beyond, Kbhler mentions the case of our recall of things to which we have temporarily no access, although we do know that they exist beyond our phenomenal range, and later the case of the in- fluence of the absent term in successive comparison (273). In these particular cases, the indications are that the transcendent entities are memory-traces in our brain-tissue (123). Certainly such examples prove the existence of entities beyond the horizon of our actual phenomena. Yet, this does not imply that these entities are, ultimately and in principle, beyond all possible ex- perience and that they can never become actual phenomena, especially since, according to Kbhler, even the physical constructs are built from phenomenal material. The physical world may be ever so remote from our phenomenal data: the dualistic separation of phenomenal and transphenomenal world can hardly be upheld as something final. There is good evidence to believe that Kbhler would not claim this either. Even from the examples of the book, the cut looks more like a fluctuating and temporary border line based either on the limitations of our momentarily occurring field of perception or recall or on our limited human possibilities of obtaining direct access to certain types of objects. Elsewhere Kbhler offers a very ingenious answer to the phenom- enalistic puzzle of how it is that we perceive objects as something outside our bodies (126 if.). Even the dualistic critical realist can account for this fact, once he distinguishes clearly between our phe- nomenal body and our physical organism. The argumentation is a de- velopment of earlier discussions of this point by the author. Another feature of interest to phenomenologists is Kbhler's phe-</page><page sequence="9">REVIEWS 3 8 5 nomenological vindication of the concept of force, which was to serve as the isomorphic correlate of requiredness. Although no exhaustive analysis is given, a number of essential characteristics are enumerated (342), and the concept of objective force is effectively defended against the charge of anthropomorphism (388). Dynamics iil Psychology is a purely psychological study of a more technical character. Its main interest is directed toward the trans- phenomenological field. It gives some remarkable experimental results on the structure, organization, and dynamics of visual perception and discusses their significance in the biological context of isomorphism. Faraday's concept of fields of force is found to throw new light on the situation, since perceptual organization shows dynamical features of a structure similar to that of electric currents. There can be little doubt as to the existence of such field-action in the brain-tissue. Some methodological considerations in the first chapter, "The Ways of Psychology," are, however, not without phenomenological in- terest. Kdhler starts out by raising the question of how it is that psy- chology cannot rival the other natural sciences in the impressiveness of its results. His answer is that, as distinguished from physics for exam- ple, psychology cannot discover any totally unknown facts. All its real discoveries concern "facts of functional relationships" between phe- nomena which as such are known to everybody. A large and important section of these relationships are hidden and can be discovered only by inductive, i.e., by indirect procedures. On the other hand these hidden relationships may contribute to an understanding of how and why our various experiences originate (3 ff.). For instance, the discovery of certain hidden relationships might make it intelligible why even reasonable preferences and aversions are changed by satiation (38). The kind of understanding which the author has in mind here is explanation by scientific theory as illustrated by physical examples (119 if.), in the case of retention and recall for instance, in terms of the dynamics of memory-traces; no teleological intelligibility is en- visaged. In cases where there is no obvious coherence among our phenomenal data and where for reasons of principle some kind of connection must still be assumed, even the phenomenologist must definitely allow for inductive theories of the physical links among the brain-correlates of our phenomena. Such explanation by inductively established hidden relationships certainly means an important addition to our knowledge. Kdhler himself points out that there are also among our phenom- ena directly observable intelligible relationships which are indispensa- ble in our investigation of the hidden relationships. Thus the appli- cation of such concepts as causal relationship could not be justified</page><page sequence="10">3 86 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH except on phenomenological grounds (38); and K6hler does affirm that we often experience one event growing out of another, not mere- ly following it (37). Even the term "functional dependence" would not make any sense, unless a corresponding phenomenon had been ex- perienced somewhere (38). Thus it appears that in Kbhler's view, despite the lack of spec- tacular results, phenomenological psychology forms the basis of trans- phenomenological psychology with its more striking achievements. One might add that to throw the full light of phenomenological an- alysis and description upon phenomena is often more important than to discover facts which are hidden somewhere beyond our present range of phenomena. The significant thing brought out with such gratifying explicitness in the two books remains the fact that psychol- ogy and in particular the inductive psychology of hidden functional relationships will have to resort to phenomenological intuition as the ultimate justification of whatever hypothetical constructions it might have to introduce.
