<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Delirium of Praise: Bataille, Blanchot, Deleuze, Foucault, Klossowsku By Eleanor Kaufman. Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001. xii + 224 pp. $42.50 It's not the easiest job reviewing Eleanor Kaufmans book on this gaggle of major French "theorists": her work is, after all, essentially about reviewing, or reviewers reviewing each other. Any reviewer, then, inevitably is encom- passed (and embarrassed) by Kaufman's argument - to praise her book is to enter into the affective and intellectual economy that she has already ana- lyzed. Til try to refrain from "deliriously" praising the book, however, thereby remaining tenuously outside the network of "major" thinkers that is her subject. As with the surrealists, and the beats, the group of thinkers analyzed in Kaufman's book all knew each other (although I don't think Deleuze or Foucault ever met Bataille, and it's unclear who Blanchot, in his reclusiveness, ever met, if anyone at all), often hung out with each other, mentioned each other, and mentioned hanging out with each other. They refer often to each other's work, and if one has spent much time reading this bunch one has developed the habit of bracketing their remarks as inconsequential - of value mainly in indicating other authors of interest, those who play a role in a certain intellectual genealogy. (Bataille and Klossowski first came to the attention of many American readers, for example, through references in Derrida, Deleuze, and Foucault; for that reason translations of their works actually lagged behind that of their younger contemporaries. Bataille in fact died six years before May 68.) Kaufman has the audacity to turn to these seemingly minor, sometimes almost embarrassing bits of praise (Fou- cault on Deleuze, for example), and study them in their own right.

A common-sense overview of critical praise, as it's usually practiced, would, I think, conclude that it: 1) strives to be informative (the reviewer wants to inform us about the "content" of the work in question; 2) it af- firms, in practice, the difference between reviewer and author (since the review is external to, at a critical distance from, the work it analyzes); 3) in the best sense it's personal, because it recognizes the individuality of the work it studies; and 4) in the worst sense it's personal, because often (and not always, of course), it's self-interested - if I praise this work, its author will eventually praise me, or do me some other kind of favor (cite me, help me get a book published, etc.). Now Kaufman goes against all these assumptions of what reviewing, and praising, are all about. At first it would seem that her book is among the most trivial productions ever issued by a major university press; she makes it clear that she is not interested in discussing the "content" of, say, Bataille and Blanchot s work, but rather the emptiness of their mutual praise (the second chapter, for example, is entitled "Chattering Silences"). But as we read on we realize that the "excessive praise" in question goes to the heart of the theoretical project of all these writers; at stake in critical praise is not simple information, or back-scratching, but instead a model of inter- personal relations inseparable from reading, theorizing, writing, spending, and, the offer of hospitality. Take, for example, Kaufman's take on Bataille s notion of "expendi- ture." Rather than concerning herself with expenditure among the Kwakiutl as Bataille does (following Mauss), Kaufman examines the economy of praise among her group of authors. Their mutual praise - their reading and writ- ing of each other - is "so replete with energy imbalances and excesses that the text is at best an insufficient and thus all the more poignant trace of an energy expended without reserve, one that is irretrievably lost and beauti- fully irreparable" (121). For Kaufman, in other words, the most important instant of excess in an economy is the moment of imbalance of praise; it is not a question of these authors reading each other accurately, but, precisely, of their misreading of each other, their delirious mutual praise that says nothing while attempting to say everything, but that says nothing in differ- ent, hyperbolic ways. In this, ironically, they affirm not their differences from each other, but rather their identity: Deleuze and Foucault, for ex-</page><page sequence="3">458 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES ample, praise each other in very different (but, it seems to me, symmetrical) ways; at the same time, by appropriating the other's terminology, they come to repeat, double, each other: "Ultimately, however, it is impossible to com- pare the relative energy imbalances of the Foucault-Deleuze economy be- cause the defining feature of this economy resides in the irrecoverable loss of boundaries between the entity Foucault and the entity Deleuze. By speak- ing with the other and through the other s terminology so that it becomes one's own, the difference between one thinker and the other is no longer measurable in terms of one distinct person versus another. At issue is a variable multiplicity of articulations of the Same" (122). A general economy of praise (for Kaufman, it seems, the most important general economy in post-traditional societies) entails, therefore, both a squandering of energy (in the imbalances of relations) and the putting in question of the writerly subjectivity, if we can use that term, of "individual" authors. Kaufman goes on to refine this point in her conclusion, where she moves from the Mauss-Bataille problematic of gift-giving to that of the Klossowski-inspired one of generosity. She associates the gift with exchange and reciprocity, no matter how excessive; hospitality, then, would entail a fundamental non-reciprocity, or, in Klossowski's paradoxical (and nonsen- sical formulation) an "absolute reciprocity." Kaufman writes: "Whereas the gift economy is based on distinction and exchange between known entities, the relationship of hospitality is more firmly predicated on the mdistin- guishability between guest and host and the possibility of encountering an unknown entity" (137). This, however, does not seem that far from what Kaufman has already said about Bataille s general economy. Bataille's vision, directly inspired by Mauss, as Kaufman herself implies, also entails differential energy expen- ditures and the breakdown of simple difference between guest and host, sacrificer and sacrificed. Perhaps what Kaufman favors in Klossowski is this emphasis on host (with all the ambiguities of the term - Vhote - in French), which seems to imply a welcoming and sheltering, even when that movement is fundamentally impersonal. Bataille's vision of expenditure is, after all, a more Sadean, apocalyptic one, involving less simulation and more (fantasized) frenzied destruction. In any case this model of hospitality would seem to "break down the clear distinctions between self and other" (138). If that is the case, however, one wonders why this relations of doubles needs to be so rigorously inter- personal. For Kaufman, as for Mauss, hospitality, exchange, is always be- tween two people. Be it two "primitve" chiefs, destroying goods to impress</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 459 each other, or two Parisian sophisticates reading each other's work, and writing on it, it's always a question of individuals - even as individual iden- tity is put in question. Kaufman's sacred is one of community; is there, however, an energy expenditure even more impersonal than the one she sketches out? One thinks here of Bataille s model of the expenditure of the sun: at certain points in Bataille's text, at least, one gives as the sun does, without concern for the other, without the anthropomorphism of any kind of exchange at all. A Bataillean solar religion implies not only a giving without return, but also a giving to no one or to nothing. This raises all kinds of questions concerning religion, and indeed Klossowski reproached Bataille, in the first version of Sade mon prochain (1947), for ignoring the Catholic implications of his (Bataille's) model of the atheological sacred. One of the aspects of the mutual reading process that Kaufman tends to ignore is the problem of religion; what happens, between the first and second editions of Sade mon prochain, to Klossowski's Catholicism? Why? Does Klossowski change his view of Bataille after his notion of the sacred - and the simulacrum - changes? Does Klossowski still depend on an interpersonal model of the sacred - a relation to God, in other words - while Bataille's sacred is so rigorously impersonal that the Other, be it God or even a literary interlocutor, tends to die, or to wither away completely? Does Deleuze's praise of Klossowski involve a certain affirmation - or, on the contrary, an ignoring of - the fundamental reli- gious impulses behind Klossowski's work, and, most paradoxically, behind his readings of Nietzsche and Sade? Or is there a sacred element, a funda- mentally religious moment, in Deleuze as well? And Foucault (himself a reader of Deleuze and Klossowski)? It would be interesting to consider further the religious resonances of Deleuze and Foucault in particular, these writers whose work, on first reading, seems so rigorously secular. Another question is that of sexuality, never that far, in these writers, from questions of the sacred. Kaufman never openly addresses the obvious fact of all the "homosocial" bonding going on here - the boy's club whose praise more than once goes over the top, even gets to be a little campy, a little parodie (Deleuze: "What will they think of us?"), but which remains, in principle, straight. What is the meeting point between the homosocial and the homosexual? Foucault, for example, was as we know rigorously gay, and Deleuze (as far as I know) fairly straight. Can one read traces of this difference in their mutual encomia? On the other hand, the apparent node of the diffÃ©rend between Klossowski and Bataille is Sade; the two authors disagree in some fundamental way over readings of Sade, who valued, as his</page><page sequence="5">460 COMPARATIVE LITERATURE STUDIES highest sacrilegious-philosophical moment, homosexual sodomy. . . an ob- vious point strangely absent from both Bataille s and Klossowski's texts. Could their disagreement, their "tit for tat" dispute (the one exception to the generalized praise among these authors, the exception that proves the rule, as Kaufman notes), ultimately turning around Sade, be the mark of a certain anxiety concerning the status and stability of homosocial bonding itself? These questions aside, Kaufmans book is a remarkably astute work that manages to do the impossible: read these elusive authors together, identifying at the same time the specificities of their remarkable sameness and their concomitant radical difference. It's quite a feat of intellectual history: a book that at first glance at least ignores the "content" of these author's works, focusing only on a group "friendship" based on mere chat- ter, on exaggerated and empty praise - all the more to enact that "content" in its analyses.
