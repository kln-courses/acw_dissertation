I wish to thank the many participants who interacted with my ideas there. I also extend my sincerest thanks to Robert Rezetko and Anna Zernecke for providing useful feedback on earlier drafts of this article. 11 assume that the following thirty-nine Hebrew psalms are laments of the individual: 3; 5; 6; 7; 13; 17; 22; 25; 26; 27:7-14; 28; 31; 35; 38; 39; 42; 43; 51; 54; 55; 56; 57; 59; 61; 63; 64; 69; 70; 71; 86; 88; 102; 109; 120; 130; 140; 141; 142; and 143, following Hermann Gunkel, Introduction to Psalms: The Genres of the Religious Lyric of Israel completed by Joachim Begrich (trans.

This study is limited to those explicitly labeled a suilla in an attested rubric. 303</page><page sequence="2">304 Journal of Biblical Literature 129, no. 2 (2010) often consisting of nothing more than a word or two. Several influential biblical interpreters have attached great significance to this difference, making comparative and even theological generalizations that inevitably exalt Israel over its imperial Mesopotamian neighbor. Although this difference between the Hebrew and Akka dian prayers is unmistakable, I argue in this brief study that the comparison is ill formed. Based on a well-known social model of prayer and an idea formulated in ritual studies that the level of formality in ritual is often directly related to the social distance or proximity between the parties involved, I offer a more anthropologically grounded explanation for each form of invocation and the comparative contrast noted above. Turning to the observation that the brief invocation in the Hebrew laments of the individual is actually more comparable to the invocation in the Akkadian dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers?supplications for the abatement of a personal god s wrath,21 suggest that the invocations in both the Hebrew laments of the indi vidual and the Akkadian dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers are brief because both reflect a more familiar connection between the supplicant and the deity entreated than do the suillas. This interpretation provides further support for seeing a personal aspect to the god presented in the Psalter s laments of the individual. Besides countering improper comparative generalizations and thereby contributing another example for the critical assessment of theological bias in the history of our field, this brief study exemplifies a methodological paradigm that may prove fruitful for future comparative work. I. Prayer Invocations and Past Interpreters In most laments of the individual in the Hebrew Psalter the invocation is sim ply mn\ "O Yahweh" (see, e.g., Pss 3:2; 6:2) or, as would be expected in the Elohistic Psalter, DTl^N, "O God" (see, e.g., Pss 43:1; 51:3). Other invocations are just as short, consisting of a single word (Ps 59:2, "O my god"), or only slightly longer, made so by placing two very brief invocations in parallel in the opening line or two (see Pss 28:1, m?/nin\ "O Yahweh/my rock"; 70:2, mm/DTl^N, "O God/O Yah 2 This fact is oft-noted but little developed. See, e.g., Rainer Albertz, Pers?nliche Fr?mmigkeit und offizielle Religion: Religionsinterner Pluralismus in Israel und Babylon (Calwer Theologische Monographien, Reihe A, 9; Stuttgart: Calwer, 1978; repr., Atlanta: Society of Biblical Literature, 2005), 99; Patrick D.

Dalglish, Psalm Fifty-One in the Light of Ancient Near Eastern Patternism (Leiden: Brill, 1962), 259. Anna Zernecke has recently completed a dis sertation at Johannes Gutenberg University in Mainz (Germany), comparing the Hebrew laments of the individual and the iwz7/a-prayers. She and I come to similar conclusions about the formal proximity of the laments of the individual and dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers but from a slightly differ ent perspective. I thank Dr. Zernecke for the fruitful correspondence, sharing of papers, and the opportunity to sharpen one another's work.</page><page sequence="3">Lenzi: Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments 305 weh"; 25:1-2, T?K/m?T, "O Yahweh/my god"; and 130:1-2, *rrK/mn\ "O Yahweh /my lord"). The longest invocations consist of only three words: Ps 5:2-3, which places mrn in parallel with "O^D, "my king and my god"; Ps 22:2-3, showing ^N, "my god, my god," in parallel with "O my god"; and Ps 88:2 and its questionable formulation, TliW Tfrtt mn\ "O Yahweh, god of my salvation."3 Put simply: the invocations in the Hebrew laments of the individual are brief and direct. Sw/Z/a-prayers in Mesopotamia, on the other hand, the prayers to which the Hebrew laments of the individual are most frequently compared, typically have a very different, extended hymnic invocation. For example, a prayer to Ea begins with the following: O wise king, perceptive creator, Lofty prince, ornament of the Eabsu, Enlilbanda, artful, venerated one, Hero of Eridu, sage of the Igigi, Lord of the E[engur]ra, protection of the Eunir, Bringer of the high waters (that cause) abundance, who makes the rivers joyful, In oceans and in reed thickets you make plenteous prosperity, In the meadows you create the livelihood of the peoples. Anu and Enlil rejoice because of you, The Anunna-gods bless you in their holy places, The peoples of the land extol your weighty command, You give counsel to the great gods. O Ea, the moribund need not die, thanks to your life-giving spell.4 Similarly, in a prayer to Nabu the petitioner begins: O [Nab]u, eldest (son), rightful heir, [Holder] of the tablet stylus, of profound intelligence, [Who ... the days], who examines the years, [Who safeguards] life, who requites good, [Foremost one] of the gods, of eminent name! The father who begot him does not change his command, Tutu does not change the utterance of Nabu his son, His word is supreme among the gods his peers.

One early idea that attracted both admirers and detractors came from Joachim Begrich. Writing in 1928, Begrich labeled the intro ductions a captatio benevolentiae, "a quest for favor," a term used in rhetoric to describe an orator s attempt to capture the goodwill of the audience via flattery. He wrote: The embellished salutation and the description of grandeur are none other than its [i.e., the prayers] captatio benevolentiae. The supplicant, who stands before the deity as an ardu, "slave," is looking to make a connection to this high lord that can serve as a foundation for his prayer. He is seeking to ingratiate himself to him. That is the purpose.7 But not everyone agrees. Walter G. Kunstmann, an Assyriologist, and Geo Widen gren, a biblicist who takes Begrich to task at some length, do not interpret the hym nic introductions in suilla-przyers as flattery to prod the deity into giving a favorable audience; rather, they see them as genuinely pious attempts at expressing trust in the deity s ability to help.8 Alongside this idea, others have noted that the particular epithets included in the hymnic introduction may be directly related to the supplicants need or request (see, e.g., the hymnic introduction to the Nabu suilla cited earlier).9 With Tzvi Abusch, I see an element of truth in all of these ideas but will return to this point below to develop another perspective on the matter.10 6 The generalization is clearly established by Mayer, Gebetsbeschw?rungen, 39-45; for an exception, see, e.g., his Marduk 4. 7 Begrich, "Die Vertrauens?u?erungen im israelitischen Klageliede des Einzelnen und in seinem babylonischen Gegenst?ck," ZAW 5 (1928): 221-60, here 234: "Die ausgestaltete Anrede und die Herrlichkeitsschilderung sind nichts anderes als seine captatio benevolentiae. Der Beter, welcher dem Gott als ardu, als Sklave gegen?bersteht, sucht eine Beziehung zu diesem hohen Herrn herzustellen, die als Grundlage seiner Bitte dienen kann. Er sucht ihn sich geneigt zu machen. Das ist die Absicht." The same expression is used by Walter Beyerlin to describe the Mesopotamian invocations {Die Rettung der Bedr?ngten in den Feindpsalmen der Einzelnen auf institutionelle Zusammenh?nge untersucht [FRLANT 99; G?ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1970], 156; cited also in Mayer, Gebetsbeschw?rungen, 45 n.13). 8 Kunstmann, Die babylonische Gebetsbeschw?rung (Leipziger semitistische Studien n.E 2; Leipzig: J. C. Hinrichs, 1932; repr., Leipzig: Zentralantiquariat der DDR, 1968), 12; and Geo Widengren, The Accadian and Hebrew Psalms of Lamentation as Religious Documents: A Compa rative Study (Uppsala: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell, 1936), 42-43, 86-92, who cites Kunstmann appro vingly (pp. 42, 86, 90).

For a detailed treatment of several hymnic introductions to suillas and how various divine epithets therein connect to other parts of the prayer, see Joel Hunt, "The Hymnic Introduction of Selected Sullia Prayers Directed to Ea, Marduk, and Nabu' (Ph.D. diss., Brandeis University, 1994). He treats on pp. 17-87 the suilla to Ea cited above. 10 Abusch, "Prayers: Mesopotamia," 353.</page><page sequence="5">Lenzi: Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments 307 The contrast between the long hymnic introduction of the suillas and the brief, direct invocations of the Hebrew laments of the individual could hardly be more striking. Given such a stark contrast, it is no surprise that several major and influ ential biblical scholars have attached a great deal of significance to it, making com parative and even theological generalizations that imply the superiority of Israelite prayer over that of their Mesopotamian neighbors. In order to demonstrate the interpretive ramifications of this ill-conceived comparison, I quote Claus Wester mann and Hermann Gunkel at length. Speaking in a context dealing with the structure of Babylonian psalms, Westermann writes: If praise, as in most of the Babylonian psalms, precedes lament and petition it can only be a general, timeless, descriptive praise. This is the basis of the fact that in Babylon declarative praise is so insignificant in comparison with the descriptive that it almost vanishes entirely. In this way the real difference in the manner of speaking to God in these two settings now becomes completely clear. In both cultures the one praying stands within the circle of petition and praise; in both the turning point is the vow of praise, which leads from petition into praise. The difference lies in the fact that in the Babylonian psalm the emphasis lies entirely on the praise which prepares the way for the petition [i.e., precisely what is lacking in the Israelite individual laments], and in the Psalms of the O.T. it lies entirely on the praise that looks back on the wonderful help of God in intervening. In Babylon the psalms primarily praise the one who exists, the god who exists in his world of gods. In Israel they primarily praise the God who acts marvelously by intervening in the history of his people and in the history of the individual member of his people. The gods praised in Babylon have their history among the gods. In Israel's praise from the beginning to end the basic theme is the history of God with his people.11 On the basis of a different location for the element of praise in the two forms of prayers, Westermann draws conclusions about the ontology of divinity in each cul ture! He may be correct in his statement that Israel tends to glorify Yahweh for past divine acts in history. But if the contention of this paper is correct, he cannot draw out such an implication from the contrast between the long hymnic introduction of the suillas and the brief, direct invocations of the Hebrew laments of the indi vidual. Gunkel also makes far-reaching claims based on the same comparison, offer ing these words about the noted contrast: One should observe that these names to [sic] not appear to be heaped upon one another in the Psalms [i.e., the epithets in the hymnic introduction of suillas]. Israelites related very differently at this point than the one praying in the Baby lonian material. The Babylonian incorporates an abundance of honorific names 11 Westermann, Praise and Lament, 41-42.</page><page sequence="6">308 Journal of Biblical Literature 129, no. 2 (2010) for the divinity, to which a portrayal of the majesty of the summoned God [sic] is attached. The Babylonian thereby desires to put his gods in a favorable mood, or to flatter them and seek to convince them to do what he implores. The Israelite acts differently to YHWH. From the outset, he trusts that YHWH will hear him and refuses to depend upon the external means of convincing by flattery. This difference coincides with the fact that the Israelite address, in contrast to the Babylonian, does not use the hymn-like expansion using the relative sentence or the participle. This expansion helps explain what the heaping of addresses has expressed, and serves the flattering of the gods. However, the Israelite genre scorns this expansion.12 In this case, Gunkel finds two very different understandings of the relationship between supplicant and deity exemplified in these prayers. Israelite supplicants are confident about approaching their deity (as Christian supplicants ought to be [Heb 4:16]); Mesopotamian ones, it seems, approach with trepidation and only after heaping up flatteries. However, if this comparison is indefensible, then the impli cations he wants to draw from it do not follow (without support from elsewhere). One cannot help but wonder if theological concerns to distinguish Israel from its polytheistic neighbors have displaced careful comparative method in these influ ential interpretations of the data. Rejecting Gunkel and Westermann, of course, does not solve the comparative and interpretive issue. How are we to interpret this very clear formal difference between the brief invocations of the Hebrew laments of the individual and the long hymnic introduction of the Akkadian suillas* II. Theoretical Retooling for Understanding Invocations in Prayer I think the way forward lies in equipping our comparative approach with at least two explicit theoretical perspectives; these will allow us better to understand the differences we see in the data already presented. Moshe Greenberg has noted in his brief book on prayer that supplicants (i.e., humans) approach the supplicated (i.e., a god) in much the same way that an indi vidual human in need approaches a social superior able to provide for that need.13 In other words, people anthropomorphized their deities as if they were their social 12 Gunkel, Introduction to Psalms, 153. Similarly, Sigmund Mowinckel writes about the suillas: "The naive idea of flattering the deity by means of ascriptions of honour shows through everywhere. That is why so many of these hymns are a dull and unending enumeration of hon orific titles and phrases of homage, often in endless repetition." After discussing a few exceptions in the Hebrew Psalter, he says, "As a rule the hymn is a true outcome of'disinterested piety"' (The Psalms in Israels Worship [trans. D. R. Ap-Thomas; Oxford: Basil Blackwell, 1962], 180-81). 13 Greenberg, Biblical Prose Prayer as a Window to the Popular Religion of Ancient Israel (Taubman Lectures in Jewish Studies; Berkeley: University of California Press, 1983). "The closest</page><page sequence="7">Lenzi: Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments 309 superiors?only supersized.14 Greenberg was concerned with prayers embedded in biblical narrative. Moreover, his social situations are petitionary address, con fession, and expressions of gratitude. Thus, he does not consider the issue of the lament of the individual. But his general point is indisputable: when people prayed in Israel, they called out to their deity through the application of a social practice deemed an appropriate analogy for the situation with their god. These analogies may have seemed quite contemporary or antiquated to the supplicants at various times of the analogy's use; nevertheless, the manner in which one called to ones deity was modeled at some time or other on an acceptable sociocultural practice.15 Looking at the Mesopotamian data through this theoretical perspective, I think that Begrich was basically correct when he interpreted the hymnic intro duction of the suillas as a rhetorical device rooted in social practice, that is, in a slaves attempt to gain an audience with a social superior. But "flattery," as Gunkel called it, may be too strong and derogatory a word to describe it. With Erhard S. Gerstenberger, I would prefer to call the hymnic introductions of suilla-prayers a protocol?a protocol analogous to the ones that people used when addressing human authorities.16 The content of the introductory exaltations may have been tailored to the addressee for the situation at hand, as some interpreters have men tioned, but the most basic point about the inclusion of these hymnic introductions in the sw/Z/a-prayers is that they are the formal protocol necessary for addressing an authority. If such a formality was expected among humans addressing their supe riors, how much more so when addressing the gods? human analogy to petitionary prayer," he suggests, "will be a petitionary address to a king or some other powerful person" (pp. 20-21). Generalizing the point further on, he says "the biblical nar rators all portrayed speech between man and God on the analogy of speech between humans" (p. 36). 14 See Karel van der Toorn, "Sources in Heaven: Revelation as a Scholarly Construct in Second Temple Judaism," in Kein Land f?r sich allein: Studien zum Kulturkontakt in Kanaan, Israel/Pal?stina und Ebirnarif?r Manfred Weippert zum 65. Geburtstag (ed. Ulrich H?bner and Ernst Axel Knauf; OBO 186; G?ttingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 2002), 265-77, here 266. Humans generally think of deities as if they were people, despite the objections of theologians. The cognitive scientific branch of religious studies is empirically establishing the cognitive basis for this universal religious conception. It is, in a sense, therefore natural for people to look to their own social conventions for interacting with the gods. See Todd Tremlin, Minds and Gods: The Cogni tive Foundations of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006); and Stewart Guthrie, Faces in the Clouds: A New Theory of Religion (New York: Oxford University Press, 1995), the latter of whom sees the very root of all religion in the prodigious human propensity to attribute agency and anthropomorphic characteristics to inanimate and unseen things. 151 have worded this carefully to allow for the possibility?indeed, the likelihood?that cer tain social practices upon which a religious practice was modeled became obsolete among the general populace but continued to be used in the religious sphere. 16 Gerstenberger, Der bittende Mensch: Bittritual und Klagelied des Einzelnen im Alten Tes tament (WMANT 51; Neukirchen-Vluyn: Neukirchener Verlag, 1980), 97.</page><page sequence="8">310 Journal of Biblical Literature 129, no. 2 (2010) The second theoretical generalization to help us understand the difference between the opening of the Akkadian sw/Z/a-prayers and the Hebrew lament of the individual concerns formalization as it has been understood in ritual studies. In 1972, Mary Douglas made the observation in her now famous article "Decipher ing a Meal" that there is a relationship between the level of formality in certain social interactions, for example, "eating a meal" versus "having drinks," and social proximity. In her study, Douglas generalizes that people who are merely acquain tances are likely to get drinks and eat finger foods at a pub or restaurant (i.e., not at someone's home) in order to interact. As one gets to know the person, an invi tation to a sit-down meal in one's home might follow. In other words, social prox imity (viz., intimacy) is directly related to the level of formality (e.g., standing at a bar versus sitting at a table) in acquiring nourishment.17 Mario Liverani's interpretation of the Akkadian Adapa Myth through the rubric of hospitality points to a similar idea about the relationship between for mality and intimacy in ritual behavior. When Adapa ascends to heaven, Ea advises him to accept the oil and garment that the gods will offer him but to decline their food and drink. Liverani suggests that the oil and garment are outer forms of hos pitality applied to the body?marking physical admittance to the general realm of the gods. Food and drink, on the other hand, are inner forms of hospitality entered into the body?marking social admittance to the actual company of the gods. Because he obeys his master Ea, it seems that Adapa is permitted to go only halfway into the community of the gods. He accesses their domain (via outer forms of hos pitality) but not their ranks (via inner forms of hospitality), and thus he is not granted immortality.18 These two particular cases, although using different notions of intimacy and formality, support a general claim made by Catherine Bell. In her discussion of for malism in ritual, Bell considers formality (or informality) in speech, greetings, and table manners. She then generalizes about table manners as follows: As in many ritual situations, the more intimate the social relationships that are involved, the more casual the behavior. So a mother feeding a child on her lap is apt to ignore the usual table etiquette, but a group of relative strangers dining 17 The article originally appeared as "Deciphering a Meal," Daedalus 101 (1972): 61-82.1 cite the article according to the pagination in Douglas s volume of collected essays, Implicit Meanings: Essays in Anthropology (London/Boston: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1975), 249-75 (the essay has been reprinted elsewhere, for example, in Food and Culture: A Reader [ed. Carole Counihan and Penny Van Esterik; New York: Routledge, 1997], 36-55). Note esp. p. 256 where she writes, "Drinks are for strangers, acquaintances, workmen, and family. Meals are for family, close friends, and honored guests. The grand operator of the system is the line between intimacy and distance. Those we know at meals we also know at drinks. The meal expresses close friendship. Those we know only at drinks we know less intimately." 18 Liverani, Myth and Politics in Ancient Near Eastern Historiography (ed. and intro. Zainab Bahrani and Marc Van De Mieroop; Ithaca, NY Cornell University Press, 2004), 3-23.</page><page sequence="9">Lenzi: Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments 311 together tend to be more scrupulous. The greater the social distance experienced or desired between persons, the more their activities abide by those conventions that acknowledge social distance. Likewise, however, dropping some of these conventions can collapse some of the social distance and alter the relationships.19 III. Applying the Theory Before taking our theoretical perspectives back to the Hebrew laments of the individual, let us first apply them to two different kinds of Akkadian prayers, the suillas and the dingir.s?.dib.bas. Looking at the Akkadian suillas collectively, one sees that these prayers are generally offered by individuals to high gods in the pantheon who are clearly named, gods like Samas, Marduk, Istar, Nabu, Ea, Anu, and so on. The actual con tent of the hymnic introduction includes cosmic imagery, the deity's relationship to other gods in the pantheon, the deity s position with regard to temples or cultic rites, and/or epithets related to the diety s attributes that are relevant to the petition. Moreover, the suillas are quite often prayed for the purpose of resecuring the pro tection of the supplicants personal god and goddess, who are not named. There are of course other elements, such as lament, confession (often of ignorance), and petition for healing included in the prayer. But the named, high gods intervention with the supplicants unnamed, angry personal deities is a very important compo nent in many of these prayers. These features suggest that the gods invoked in the suillas are being addressed in an official capacity as cosmic authorities. The social model that these features evoke is that of one petitioning a city official or king to help in ones domestic problem (e.g., a property dispute with a neighbor, a divorce, etc.). As Annette Zgoll has persuasively argued, the ritual actions that generally accompany the suillas make this very same point. Schematically presented, the sup plicant sets out an offering of various items, lifts the hands in a gesture of greeting, bows to the ground, rises up again, and then speaks the prayer (usually multiple times). All of this is intended to move the beseeched superior?whether human or divine-?to be obligated to the supplicant and extend a helping hand.20 19 Bell, Ritual: Perspectives and Dimensions (New York: Oxford University Press, 1997), 143. Earlier, Bell states, "For the most part, high degrees of formality force people to state or affirm very generalized and rather impersonal sentiments about relatively abstract concerns" (p. 139). From this perspective, it may not be entirely wrong for interpreters to sense an emotional distance between the god of a suilla and the supplicant. 20 Zgoll, "Audienz?Ein Modell zum Verst?ndnis mesopotamischer Handerhebungsrituale: Mit einer Deutung der Novelle vom Armen Mann von Nippur? BaghM 34 (2003): 173-95. Zgoll has persuasively interpreted the ritual actions associated with suillas in light of the general actions one would use in seeking help from a social superior in a nonreligious context, analyzing the interrelationship between supplicant and benefactor into ten parts (see her comparative chart on</page><page sequence="10">312 Journal of Biblical Literature 129, no. 2 (2010) In the dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers, on the other hand, the supplicant addresses the personal deity directly, beseeching the deity to abandon wrath.21 In these prayers, the most common invocation is a simple "my god" {ill). Sometimes this is extended by brief epithets, like "pure one" (ellu) or "mighty one" (surb?), or a cou ple of brief participial modifiers, such as "who created my name" (b?n? sum?ya), "who gives life" (q?Hs bal?t?), "who renders verdicts" [garnir d?n?)&gt; or "who begat/ bore me" (?lidu/?littu). It is striking how often these participial phrases concern the supplicant personally. Despite the inclusion of several such phrases or epithets in a prayer, it is still obvious, as W. G. Lambert pointed out in his edition of the texts, that there is no extended hymnic introduction in these prayers as there is in the suillas. Lambert interprets this lack in terms of the generic use of these texts: the prayers could be directed to any personal god, so precise epithets were not inserted into the prayers.22 But this practical result of the absence of epithets need not be the only explanation. We might also interpret the lack of hymnic introduction in terms of the fact that the dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers are directed not to a high god as an offi cial member of the cosmic pantheon but to the supplicants personal god, a deity who is presumably much closer to the supplicant than the high gods.23 p. 196). Although she draws on various textual sources to substantiate this analogical interpreta tion, the supplications of the poor man of Nippur are her primary parallel from the nonreligious sphere. Zgolls fifth act in this complex of activity is called "the supplicants words of greeting" (Gru?worte Bittsteller). In acts involving two humans, generally the socially inferior individual offers blessings or praise to the socially superior individual. This particular act finds its parallel, according to Zgoll, in the hymnic invocation of the suilla. (I thank Anna Zernecke for alerting me to Zgolls article.) 21 For an introduction to and provisional edition of these prayers, see Lambert, "DIN GIR.S?.DIB.BA Incantations," JNES 33 (1974): 267-322; he notes that the label is not applied in an entirely consistent manner to generic personal gods since occasionally a dingir.sa.dib.ba-prayer addresses a high god such as Sin or Marduk and Zarpanitu (p. 268). See van der Toorns discus sion of the purpose of these prayers in his Sin and Sanction in Israel and Mesopotamia: A Com parative Study (SSN 22; Assen: Van Gorcum, 1985), 121-24. Although the dingir.sa.dib.ba- prayers represent personal religion, they were also incorporated into royal rituals and series like Surpu and Bit Rimki. Margaret Jaques at the University of Zurich is currently preparing a fuller edition and study of the dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers, which will address their reception history and reuse. 22 Lambert, "DINGIR.S?.DIB.BA Incantations," 270. 23 The choice of ones personal god was related to the personal god of one's parents and may also have been contingent on other local or occupational factors (e.g., many scribes took Nabu as their personal god). Personal gods were usually minor, or at least not top-tier deities in the pan theon (e.g., Ninsubur, Istars vizier, was a common personal god; Istar herself is never attested as a personal god, nor is Anu). There are exceptional instances, however, where a high god such as Enlil was an individuals personal god. Whatever the god's identity and position in the official cult of temple or palace, the personal god as personal god was venerated within a familial context.

The personal god would have had a special rela</page><page sequence="11">Lenzi: Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments 313 Elaborate formal epithets and an extended hymnic introduction to the peti tion are not necessary to a prayer directed to the personal god, because the deity and the supplicant have an established and close relationship. Unlike addressing some one in an exalted position of authority, who requires a formal protocol when seek ing an audience, the supplicant and the deity involved in a dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayer are more familiar and therefore on more informal speaking terms. If one envisions the personal god as a kind of parent figure (note ?lidu/?littu), as Thorkild Jacobsen did,24 the analogy is particularly clear. One does not address ones mother in the same way as one would address a mayor, a governor, or a world leader. One may simply call out "mother," "mom," or "mommy" to get her attention. There is no need to pile up titles or preface the vocative with rhetorical niceties. The estab lished mother-child relationship permits informality and directness.25 As is clear from this formal contrast between the sw*7/a-prayers and the din gir.s?.dib.bas, ritual formality and personal intimacy are related and affect a prayer s manner of opening address. When we consider the Hebrew laments of the individual and their short invo cations, we are reminded of the dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers and their brief invoca tions.26 Although there are differences between the two kinds of prayers that we will not discuss here,27 this formal similarity with regard to the prayers invoca tions suggests that the two kinds of prayers are a better comparative match. Con versely, there seems to be no precise match to the Mesopotamian suilla among Hebrew forms of prayer. Applying what we have learned from the dingir.sa.dib.bas above, I suggest that the brief invocations in the Hebrew lament of the individual are brief simply because the supplicant is addressing the deity in more familiar terms. Yahweh cer tainly is addressed at times as a national deity and in those cases is often addressed with a formality and/or the epithets that such a position would deserve (see, e.g., tionship to individuals, but there was always a communal element, too, since groups often shared the same personal god.) For the best discussion of "personal god," see van der Toorn, Family Reli gion in Babylonia, Syria, and Israel: Continuity and Change in the Forms of Religious Life (SHCANE 7; Leiden: Brill, 1996), 66-87, esp. 80-81 for the exceptional character of a high god in the role of an individual's personal god. 24 Jacobsen, Treasures of Darkness: A History of Mesopotamian Religion (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1976), 157-60. 25 Unfortunately, the rituals of the dingir.s?.dib.ba-prayers cannot enter into our discussion here because they are still too poorly known. It is hoped that the next text edition of these prayers will be able to use more sources that include the incantations' ritual prescriptions (see Lambert, "DINGIR.S?.DIB.BA Incantations," 269). 26 See n. 2 above for other scholars who have made this observation. 27 For example, anger of the god seems to play a minor role in the lament of the individual compared with the dingir.s?.dib-ba's; see Albertz, Pers?nliche Fr?mmigkeit und offizielle Religion, 39, 48.</page><page sequence="12">314 Journal of Biblical Literature 129, no. 2 (2010) Psalm 89 and Nehemiah 9).28 But Yahweh is also a personal deity and as such would be addressed in more familiar terms. A brief vocative is entirely appropriate. This interpretation is quite in keeping with what others have suggested about the famil ial Sitz im Leben and personal content of the laments of the individual.29 I do not wish to be misunderstood. This suggestion regarding the relation ship between social proximity and the formality of invocations is a formal-social argument and does not address the psychological state of the supplicant at all? that is inaccessible. The formal characteristic that we have seen and compared to the dingir.s?.dib-bas merely supplies another indication, based on the theoretical perspectives discussed above, that the prayers were intended, at least at some point in their life cycle, for addressing the Israelite deity in rather personal terms?as a personal god. This idea, derived by means of comparative work, is congruent with other features of the individual lament obtained through internal analysis (i.e., per sonal content and familial Sitz im Leben), and thus it adds a new element to our working model of the genre. Having considered this idea in terms of the individual laments, one might consider testing its generalizability via the manner in which the Israelite deity is addressed in the communal laments. Although this is not the place for a full treat ment, the communal laments provide general confirmation for the present findings. It should be noted from the outset of this discussion that a communal lament does not necessarily imply that the deity is perceived as a national deity or auto matically has a more formal relationship to the group of supplicants than is evi dent in a lament of the individual. "Communal" does not necessarily equal "formal." Other factors need to contribute to our determination of this, especially the Sitz im Leben of communal laments, which is open to much discussion, as well as the psalms' contents.30 The label of this genre, therefore, should not prejudice our expectation. We also need to identify which psalms we are talking about when we discuss the genre "communal laments." Although opinions can vary quite markedly, a wide range of scholars agree on including the following seven in the category: Psalms 44; 60; 74; 79; 80; 83; and 89.31 A survey of the content of these psalms indi 28 In both of these prayers, the praise comes at the beginning (compare Westermanns com ments cited above). Furthermore, the praise in Psalm 89 does not focus on Yahwehs acts in his tory, whereas the praise in Nehemiah 9 is almost entirely concerned with history. 29 See Albertz, Pers?nliche Fr?mmigkeit und offizielle Religion, 23-49. 30 For a brief statement about the Sitz im Leben of communal laments, see Walter C. Bouzard, Jr., We Have Heard with Our Ears, O God: Sources of the Communal Laments in the Psalms (SBLDS 159; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1997), 204-11. 31 For a helpful discussion and a tabular chart of the many different psalms that thirteen scholars have variously identified as communal laments, see Bouzard, We Have Heard with Our Ears, 101-45.1 have adopted his position that these seven psalms are the only communal laments in the Psalter. Other psalms have similar features, but they do not qualify for the specific label. For a more inclusive understanding of communal lament in which "thought and mood as indicated</page><page sequence="13">Lenzi: Mesopotamian Prayers and Biblical Laments 315 cates that Yahweh is in fact addressed as a god in charge of cosmic and national political affairs.32 Psalm 89, a prayer intensely concerned about kingship, is strik ing in this regard. If we apply the theory discussed above in light of such content, we should expect more formality in the way the Israelites address their deity than we saw in the lament of the individuals. We therefore expect an invocation to work in tandem with something like we saw in the suillas, namely, hymnic elements, that intend to move the social superior to be obligated to the supplicant. When we sur vey the psalms again, we see that four out of the seven have such a hymnic element as part of their structure, though significantly not always at the beginning along side the invocation (see Pss 44:2-9; 74:12-17; 80:2-3a, 9-12;33 and 89:2-19).34 Based on various comparable corporate lament genres in the ancient Near East, this is what we would expect to find.35 It is also generally congruent with our the ory of formality and social distance. IV. Conclusion There is still a mountain of work to be done on the comparison of the prayers in the Hebrew Psalter with those from Mesopotamia. This brief study, although limited to a very minor point about invocations, suggests the path ahead. We must resist facile comparisons and unself-conscious interpretations that seize upon obvi ous differences in order to distinguish Israel from its neighbors. There were dif ferences, obviously. But we must be careful about how we discern the differences. And we must be vigilant not to overstate them, especially in service to a theologi cal agenda. Keeping socially and anthropologically oriented theoretical perspec tives in the forefront of concern as we sift, compare, and interpret the data from different ancient cultures, this study suggests, is the way ahead. by content takes priority over but does not exclude matters of form," see Paul Wayne Ferris, Jr. The Genre of Communal Lament in the Bible and Ancient Near East (SBLDS 127; Atlanta: Scholars Press, 1992). Ferris identifies Psalms 31; 35; 42; 43; 44; 56; 59; 60; 69; 74; 77; 79; 80; 83; 85; 89; 94; 102; 109; 137; 142; and Lamentations as communal laments (p. 14). For a critical assessment of his methodology, see Bouzard, We Have Heard with Our Ears, 15-17 and 105-7. 32 See n. 28 above. 33 Note the epithet r?lNl? Dt6n, "god of hosts," throughout the psalm. 34 See Bouzard, We Have Heard with Our Ears, 124. Bouzard rejects, correctly in my opin ion, Westermann's Procrustean view that certain elements found in communal laments (such as the praise of the deity) are additions that have skewed the form away from its original purity (com pare Westermann, Praise and Lament, 52). 35 See Bouzard, We Have Heard with Our Ears, 156. Why there are three other psalms with out any hymnic element in them is difficult to say. But the point has been made repeatedly throughout the history of form criticism that not every individual example of a form will attest all of the forms typical elements and that the order of elements in a psalm may vary.</page></plain_text>
