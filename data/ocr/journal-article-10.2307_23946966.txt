<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Journal of Theological Studies October, 1904 ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY My Father used, not infrequently, to discuss the merits of two different ways of judging a man. Take, he would say, the case of a great statesman, set up on high before the world; the object both of hatred and of love. If we rule out of court the view of enemies, there remain two different possibilities. There is first the view of the ' impartial' historian. He looks on the statesman in the perspective of history, weighs—from outside as it were—-the merits or shortcomings of the statesman's policy; and pronounces a weighty verdict, in which, probably, praise and censure have each a considerable place. On the other hand, there is the view of the wife or the devoted private secretary. They have lived with the statesman through public crises. They have seen into his mind with peculiar intimacy. They may be lacking in knowledge, lacking in power, lacking in impartiality; but they have seen, with the insight of sympathy and of love, right into the inwardness of the great man's actions, as they appeared to himself. According to the offhand opinion of the ' man in the street', the first of these is the true view, and the second is partial or prejudiced. In this opinion my Father did not share; and I have often heard him dwelling on the merits of the ' inside' view. Now, whatever may be their first hasty opinion, most men would admit, on reflection, that both these views have their legitimate place in the rounded fullness of truth; and that neither can be ignored without loss. But it is the former alone which is most usually given to the world. It must therefore be a matter VOL. VI. Β</page><page sequence="2">2 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES of concern to those who have been close to a man and a thinker in his lifetime, that the ' intimate' point of view may also be represented. In the Church Quarterly Review of April 1904, there appeared an article, entitled ' Robert Campbell Moberly', which is an excellent example of what we may call,—without meaning to disparage it—the ' external' point of view. It seems worth while to attempt to give some idea of what seem to be its omissions and misunderstandings to those who approach the matter from the other side. I wish to make it quite clear at the outset that this is the object of this paper; and that it makes no claim to be of the nature of a final judgement. For such a judgement far greater knowledge and ability, and—perhaps—a different temper would be necessary. But to represent the more humble point of view, which is here claimed, I believe that I have some right; in that, during the last three years of his life, I was continually in the closest association with my Father, who spoke freely to me of his philosophical and theological views. I may therefore be said to have been familiar with the thinker ' in his shirtsleeves'. I hope therefore that I may now proceed to give my personal impressions of the Church Quarterly article, without appearing absurdly presumptuous. In the first place, it is evident that the reviewer does approach the subject from outside. For his account of the personality— which account, though slight, is extremely appreciative and fair— he makes it clear that he is largely, though not entirely, indebted to others. And the main theme of the article is an attempt to construct a theory of my Father's developement from his books, and quite apart from a personal knowledge of his mental history. Such a knowledge would, I believe, have inevitably modified the reviewer's theory. But, though it is obvious that the review belongs to the first of the two classes mentioned above, it is, in many ways, marked by unusual insight. Thus the reviewer recognizes, on the first page, the fact that the explanation of many of the peculiarities in my Father's books must be sought in his character. Again, on p. 76, 'Most scholars spend their leisure time in reading, Moberly seems to have spent his in thinking. The range of book knowledge displayed in his writings is surprisingly narrow.'</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY 3 This is essential; and the advantages and disadvantages of the trait are well pointed out. On the one hand, there are the inconveniences of a new terminology and the likelihood that the pioneer will often waste much time in forcing his way through dense forests, when, if he only knew it, a clear path has long ago been cut. On the other hand, there is no 'half-digested erudition; Moberly's books are all his own'. Again, on p. 80, my Father's attitude towards the logical intellect is dealt with. 'He was never content to discuss a particular problem without first considering the presuppositions on which both sides based their arguments. And if he protests against assuming a purely intellectual basis for religious faith, it is not in order to degrade the intellect into the position of an advocate retained by the will, but because he was convinced that faith must be a matter of the whole personality acting in harmony, and that the truth when fully known, must satisfy both our moral and our intellectual faculties.' And on p. 93, in the final summing up, the reviewer speaks of him as a representative of' the tendency towards Greek, and especially Platonic, methods of thought, towards a theology definitely Johannine and Pauline, and a religious philosophy strongly anti-deistic and anti-individualist'. With regard to these and many other passages, one can only feel thankful for the clear expression of such illuminating thoughts. It is most pleasant to dwell on points of harmony. But it is more profitable for one who comes after to dwell on the points on which he thinks he can either supplement or criticize. A dis proportionate length allotted to criticism need not therefore be taken to mean that one disagrees with the article criticized, as a whole. It will be best then to proceed to challenge points, on which the reviewer seems to shew a less complete insight. The main thread of his article appears to consist in a theory of developement. He holds that my Father, at the beginning of his career as a theologian, was inclined to insist chiefly on a blind obedience to tradition and authority; and that, from that time onwards, he was more and more inclined, in each new book, to shift the centre of gravity from authority to experience. The further inference is drawn, that—had he survived—he would have progressed yet further ' in the direction of Mysticism'. The object of this paper is to suggest that the theory of develope b a</page><page sequence="4">4 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES ment is—at least—considerably exaggerated; and that the exaggeration is based, partly on an ignorance of my Father's actual psychological history, and partly on an inadequate insight into the religious philosophy of his books. First, as regards his psychological history. In his later years, he might have been correctly described as a Liberal High Churchman. Now there would be some truth, but not, I think, very much, in saying that his High Churchmanship was born with him, while his Liberalism was a gradual growth. It is true, as has been beautifully said, that he was brought up under the shadow of the Tractarian movement, and among those whose motto was ' He shall not strive nor cry'. But the instincts which developed into a kind of Liberalism were there from the first, especially an earnest belief in the essential reason ableness of all Truth. And it must be remembered that his father, Bishop Moberly, stood in a somewhat independent position towards the older Tractarians; e. g. he entered into a controversy with Dr. Pusey in the early seventies on the Athanasian Creed. Of course, I cannot speak of personal know ledge of the earlier years, but I believe that my Father's most intimate friends, whilst unanimous in declaring that there was a remarkable developement right up to the end, would say that it was rather a developement in force and in power of articulate expression, than a developement from one position and to another. It is possible that, at the time of the Lux Mundi essay, he may have been inclined to lay more exclusive emphasis on obedience to tradition than he was at a later stage. But, in making so great a contrast between this essay and the later pronouncements, the reviewer gives the impression that he is selecting, out of a rather complex thought, one aspect in one book and one in another, and so creating a somewhat artificial antithesis. That this is so in the contrast which he tries to make between the teaching of Ministerial Priesthood and the teaching of Atone ment and Personality, I am certain. There was an interval of only two and a half years between the time when Ministerial Priesthood was off my Father's hands and the completion of Atonement and Personality. He was a slow worker; and he did not touch the books in term time. Practically the whole interval was taken up with the actual writing of Atonement and</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY 5 Personality. The thought was not new to him, and the thinking was not done in that short time. The book was, in a sense, his life work. The main ideas had been simmering in his head for years before he began Ministerial Priesthood. Much of the book is based on sermons preached many years earlier. He himself was conscious of no change of opinion on the great question of the relation of inward and outward, during these last years. He thought that he had one consistent and wide reaching theory on the subject. It is possible that there may be a slight difference of emphasis in the two books. But this may be easily accounted for by the fact that the earlier book is written chiefly in antithesis to Bishop Lightfoot and others, who insisted somewhat exclusively on the importance of the Inward; while the later one, so far as it is polemical at all, is written in antithesis to Dr. Dale, whose insistence is upon the objective aspect of the Atonement. My first contention then is, that the reviewer's theory of developement does not fit the facts of my Father's life, as known to his more intimate friends; and that some of the aspects of his work, which incline the reviewer to that theory, are to be explained otherwise. On the other hand, I should wish to guard myself from seeming to deny that there was any truth in the theory at all. But it is time to turn to what is more important, my Father's religious philosophy. Now it is very true, as the reviewer and others have pointed out, that his first-hand acquaintance with the writings of philosophers, and especially of modern philosophers, was exceedingly scanty. No one can regret this more than he did himself. And yet there was one modern philosopher, Hegel, with whose spirit he was very closely in sympathy. And a recognition of this fact, and of all that it implies, might have afforded some critics a certain illumination, of which they stood much in need. Hegel's famous dictum,' The rational is the real', is very near the heart of my Father's philosophy. It may all be said to hang from this central identification of fact and idea, as twin aspects of a single whole. To the ' common sense' point of view, this attitude is like a fairy story. It resembles nothing so much as a continual attempt to stand on one's head. At any rate,—</page><page sequence="6">6 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES whatever else may be said about it—audacity must be reckoned one of its most strongly marked characteristics. To understand my Father's philosophy, it is essential to realize that this audacity was his also. Again and again, critics seem to misunderstand him, simply because they cannot credit the full extent of that audacity. I ought perhaps here to guard myself against a misunderstand ing. My Father was not a Hegelian pure and simple. The weakness of Hegelianism, to his mind, was that it was throughout too intellectualistic. In making thought or mind the centre of the universe, he considered that it gave too little place to will and emotion; and that, consequently, a certain amount of abstraction ran through the whole system. This abstraction he would have remedied by making the pivot of the system, not thought, but personality: i. e. the concrete whole, in which thought, will, and emotion are equally blended. This boldness, on which it is necessary to insist, was manifested at least as much in the application, as in the original grasp, of the principle. It has been truly said, that my Father's method of thought was deductive rather than inductive; i. e. that it was his habit to argue downwards from principles to facts, rather than upwards from facts to principles. In any case, every one would acknowledge that, when a principle is once obtained, it is necessary to re-interpret the facts in the light of it. This was the case with my Father. He believed in the general principle that, in the light of absolute truth, the real and the ideal are one; i. e. he was an optimist on the grandest possible scale. It results from this, that, at every point, judgements of value and judgements of reality coincide. This carries him far indeed from the point of view of the ordinary man. But he applied this principle unflinchingly. It is therefore necessary for all criticism—favourable or unfavourable—to recognize this fact, if it is to fulfil its first duty of understanding. The principle acts as a most powerful solvent to all ordinary ideas and standards. And so a criticism which simply criticizes on the basis of the ordinary standards, without going back to first principles, is simply moving in another world, and never gets into touch with him at all. But, before going on to shew some instances of this in the concrete, it is necessary to say something on another point,</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY 7 which has given rise to misunderstanding; viz. my Father's view of the relation between the philosophy which is based on experience, and the theology which is based on revealed truth. It has often been said,—and it is said in the Church Quarterly article—that 'modern men trained in other sciences', or even those accustomed to modern Philosophy and Theology, feel themselves in a strange atmosphere, as soon as they take up one of my Father's books. They seem to be quitting the light of the sun, and to be plunging into some strange mediaeval cloister. The terminology is unusual, and seems to them to be hopelessly out of date. There is an impression that he wished to begin by the uncritical acceptance of certain revealed truths, or to confine his philosophy to deductions from them. He was thus supposed to be returning to the methods of the Schoolmen, and to be degrading reason to the position of a mere ' ancilla fidei'. The Church Quarterly reviewer indeed sees that this is far from true of the later writings. Yet he speaks of my Father as ' starting from the assumption that the dogmas themselves are exempted from criticism'. And at the time of the Lux Mündt essay, it had not yet occurred to him that dogmatic symbols contain certain words which cannot have a rigid connotation, and which therefore must be interpreted as well as ' accepted'. Of the Lux Mundi essay I cannot speak of my own knowledge. But this would be a ludicrous travesty of his mind at the time at which I had contact with it; and I am sure that he did not believe himself to have changed so fundamentally. His general attitude may be described as follows. Experience is the ultimate test and criterion: this he acknowledged most fully. All the revealed truths of religion, first principles as well as details, stand or fall ultimately according as they are, or are not, capable of satisfying the demands of experience ; under which head are included the demands of reason. In so far as the merely logical understanding is depreciated, it is only with a view to replacing it by the higher reason, which represents the whole personality. But the philosophy of experience, in so far as it takes no heed of revelation, is unreasonable. It seemed to him to end in certain demands and questions, the answers to which it failed to supply. In Hegelian phraseology, it ends in unreduced difference. But to take no heed of Revelation is unreasonable. It is there. It is,</page><page sequence="8">8 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES in a sense, within experience; and it clamours to be correlated with the rest of experience. But, when the philosopher, starting from experience in contradistinction to revelation—which ex perience is after all a mutilated form of experience—has failed to get satisfactory results; he will, if he brings in the truths of revelation, find that they supply the key to the enigma. They supply what is wanting. Apart from experience, they are nothing. But, when brought within experience they supply the missing link. They are like the sun which illuminates a whole country. So at least it seemed to my Father. And it always used to puzzle him that a philosopher like Τ. H. Green, in whose philosophy he believed as philosophy, stopped just short of the central Christian verities, such as the Incarnation. For these verities seemed to him exactly what that philosophy required to make it intelligible. Hence sentences which alienated many because they seemed intolerably reactionary and narrow, e.g. A. and P. p. 243,' Vainly to the end of time .. . will philosophy, otherwise than in conscious dependence upon Christian theological truth, attempt to read the riddle of existence, whether in external phenomena, or in man, or in God'. ' Revelation', says the reviewer,' is regarded as something so purely external that it may be said to transcend experience absolutely.' This is precisely one of those attempts on the part of the critic, to dot an author's i's, as the author himself does not dot them, which give a wrong turn to the whole. The word 'external', and the word ' absolutely ' which the reviewer italicizes, are words which my Father would have repudiated, for they would have been fatal to his philosophy of religion. With regard to the question of terminology, the language of religion appeared to him to be concrete, where that of technical philosophy was needlessly abstract; e.g. in the word ' God' he meant to include all that the philosopher includes in the idea of the absolute, but the former seemed to him more concrete and helpful. I have spoken of my Father as sharing with Hegel the central principle of the identity of the real and the ideal. This is the Omega, which was to become the Alpha, of both their philosophies. But he is also like Hegel, when viewed—as it were—from below. When faced with a concrete difficulty, it is always his effort, not to reject wholly either of two alternatives, but to pierce to a unity</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY 9 behind the differences. He attempts to play the part of a judge rather than of an advocate ; and of a judge who believes that there is some, though not necessarily equal, truth on both sides. Here then it may be seen why his general principle acts so much as a solvent. If he is successful in piercing to a unity behind two seemingly contrary alternatives, neither of those alternatives can be left in its former independent hard and fastness. They are seen to be mutually dependent fragments of a whole. Thus, in his philosophy, human personality as a whole, and the faculties of human free-will, Jhuman reason, and human love, are robbed of the independence and completeness which are usually attributed to them. The negative and in complete character of the human continually drives us on to the Divine. When we have reached this, we can turn round and see that such positive meaning as the human has, arises solely from its being a part—albeit an infinitesimal part—of a larger whole, which is Divine. This prevailing tendency of my Father's position is well illustrated by a few playful sentences at the end of the supplementary chapter in Atonement and Personality·, in reference to Archdeacon Wilson's Hulsean Lectures. He considered that the Archdeacon had minimized unduly the objective aspect of the Atonement. ' Yet,' he says, ' if I rightly understand him, I fancy that I can sympathize with every single thing which affirmatively he either means or desires. . . . This then is the effrontery of my audacity ; that, though whilst rejoicing in his spirit, I am unable to accept his exposition as it stands, I do not see why he should hesitate to accept mine.' Now Ministerial Priesthood is, as the reviewer recognizes, just such an attempt at synthesis. It finds two rival theories of the priesthood in possession of the field ; the Roman and the Pro testant. It attempts to exhibit the Anglican theory, as one which does justice both to inward and to outward, which pierces to the unity behind ' the unqualified sacerdotalism of modern Roman Catholicism on the one hand, and the theory of simple delegation adopted by English Nonconformity on the other'. It was an attempt to get beyond the ordinary partisan lines of demarcation. My Father hoped accordingly that it would be viewed as an eirenicon ; and was correspondingly disappointed, when the critics of all complexions simply treated it as a High Church manifesto.</page><page sequence="10">ΙΟ THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES This was far more markedly the case with the greater work, Atonement and Personality. This book may almost be said to contain a philosophy of religion. That philosophy was, to the mind of its author and of those who agreed with him, a unity behind—and containing—the different aspects which are usually insisted on as contraries by different parties. In going behind the ordinary shibboleths and standards, it at once renders them inadequate. Thus minds which are still moving within the circle of the ordinary presuppositions must fail to grasp it. Now many of the criticisms of my Father's philosophy—among which, I fear, the Church Quarterly article must to some extent be included— make a curious impression on one who views the matter from the author's standpoint. They remind one of the contemporary criticisms of Kant. Kant's philosophy was one which went behind and transformed all ordinary landmarks; so his contemporaries did not know what to make of him. They kept trying feebly to classify him by standards which he had transcended. So with my Father. When the reviewer raises the question of his view of the relation of tradition to experience,—and raises it, as it appears, on the old basis that they are two contradictory opposites—and when he goes on to suggest that my Father was gradually changing from one position to the other; the whole discussion seems beside the mark to one who believes that his exposition transcends these ordinary differences, and that within it each side finds a place. It is, of course, open to any one to suggest that the attempted synthesis is a failure, either wholly or in part; and to hold that it was completely successful and beyond the possibility of correction would be to hold that he was superhuman. But a criticism which simply bases itself upon the old distinctions, as though nothing had happened, and ignores the vital fact that the book, and the philosophy which it contains, attempt to transcend those distinctions, can hardly be very valuable or illuminating as criticism. I should not wish to suggest—what I do not believe to be true—that the reviewer wholly fails to realize this : but I do suggest that there is a good deal in the article which could not have been there, if the reviewer had had anything like a full comprehension of the real aim of the philosophy which he is criticizing. This kind of misapprehension may be illustrated from the</page><page sequence="11">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY IX reviewer's remarks about Atonement and Personality. The first instance is perhaps rather a slip of the pen than a serious mistake. On p. 90, the reviewer, in attempting to interpret my Father, says: 'Jesus Christ's humanity is impersonal, hence its unique capacity of universal relation.' Now it is true, of course, that he did make a distinction between the humanity of Christ and that of the ordinary individual; and the distinction consists precisely in this unique capacity of universal relation. But his whole object was to break down the ordinary conception that the essence of personality consists, to some extent, in exclusiveness and impenetrability. In so far as these qualities are attributes of our personality—and this is the case much less than is generally imagined—they are accidents belonging to its imperfection. The humanity of Christ in its universality is the sole type of perfect human personality. It is far more, not less, personal than our humanity. Thus, to mark the universality of Christ's humanity by the negative formula ' impersonal' is to shift the emphasis, and in effect to obscure the point, of my Father's argument. And in fact my Father himself says (pp. 93, 94) 'To deny the human personality, however in some contexts necessary, is not without its own risks. There is, and there can be, no such thing as impersonal humanity. The phrase involves a contradiction in terms.' ' Of necessity, He is a person : and He, the Person, is human . . . There was in Him no impersonal Humanity (which is impossible) ; but a human nature and character which were personal because they were now the method and condition of His own Personality: Himself become human, and thinking, speaking, acting, and suffering as man.' Another instance of the same kind of misapprehension is the reviewer's treatment of my Father's relation to Mysticism. The reviewer assumes that we know what Mysticism is; e. g. that it is an attitude at an opposite extreme to Dogmatism and Scholas ticism ;—and speaks of him as having ' travelled a long way in a few years towards a purely mystical theology'. Now in the twelfth chapter of Atonement and Personality Mysticism is dealt with directly. The tendency there is to accept Mysticism as representative of the truth and of the whole truth ; but to shew that, truly interpreted, it is nothing partial or one-sided, but</page><page sequence="12">12 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES a recognition of the work of the Holy Spirit throughout the whole of life. But, thus viewed, the term Mysticism is no longer capable of being used as a party label. Hence it is unfortunate that the reviewer should attempt to use it so. It is of course open to him to disagree with my Father. He may condemn either any attempt to reach a unity behind the difference of inward and outward, or this particular attempt. But it can hardly conduce to a proper understanding, to treat—without argument to shew its failure—what is an attempt at a higher synthesis, as merely a step on the way towards one of the opposed extremes. There is another point, on which it seems necessary to say something ; and that is my Father's treatment of presuppositions. Nothing that he wrote has been so widely attacked as wholly perverse and absurd. Mr Henson speaks of the two prefaces to Ministerial Priesthood as ' the confessions of relentless and disqualifying prejudice. They preach a doctrine of intellectual impotence and point the moral of scientific despair'. And this attitude is a typical one. The Church Quarterly reviewer is not so uncompromising in hostility; but he speaks of the 'singular part' which presuppositions play in the preface. And he concludes his discussion by saying: ' A comparison of ecclesiastical histories written by Protestants and Catholics, by Anglicans and Dissenters, should surely suffice as a reductio ad absurdum of the theory that dogmatic presuppositions are a trustworthy auxiliary to "historical and exegetical methods".' Yet much of this opposi tion seems so gratuitous, that it is necessary to say something in explanation of the prefaces. But it is probably a vain task ; for nothing could be clearer than the second preface itself. And it has, seemingly, failed to convince the world. My Father did not think that he was advocating anything very new or startling in these prefaces. He thought that he was merely recognizing obvious facts. He did not raise the subject as an advocate of presuppositions against those who did without them. He raised it in order to point out that his opponents' position was in the main the result of presuppositions, and of presuppositions which he considered mistaken. These pre suppositions he enumerates and attacks. His view of the matter was, briefly, this: A man without presuppositions is as much an abstraction, a psychological</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY 13 monster, as a man without a character. Presuppositions are the result of a man's past experience as a whole. To demand that he shall divest himself of presuppositions, is to demand that he shall view each new question without the least reference to that past experience. And this is an impossibility. For, apart from conscious reference, the very capacities which a man has for dealing with a new experience are inseparably connected with his past experience. And, in the second place, it is unreasonable to treat these presuppositions as necessarily a handicap or hindrance in the endeavour to arrive at truth. If it be true that reality is determined by the ideal, then a knowledge of the ideal must be a guide to a knowledge of reality. And if reality is all of one piece, the knowledge that we have should help us to the knowledge that we have not yet. At this point the reviewer—who is more appreciative of my Father's point of view in this matter than are most of the critics— would part company with him. He speaks of our presuppositions as concerning' matters of fact which no doubt are ultimately deter mined by the natural and spiritual laws of the universe, but which only an absolute knowledge of those laws could enable us to deduce from them'. This my Father would admit; but he would deny the inference that, because all deductions based on partial know ledge are imperfect, they are therefore to be eschewed altogether. Indeed such a ' self-denying ordinance' could only be carried out at the cost of an absolute paralysis of all advance in knowledge whatsoever. The scientific method is not so. The scientist uses generalizations based on imperfect knowledge. The truth of the law of gravitation is a presupposition which every scientist carries with him into the examination of any phenomenon that appears to bear on that law. But no sane person contends that the scientist would be more likely to arrive at truth, by abstracting from his previous experience, and treating the new phenomenon as though that experience had never been. Of course, no one contends that we can never change our opinions, that no new experience can be of sufficient importance to overthrow these presuppositions. But each new datum must be correlated with our knowledge and experience as a whole; and, unless it bulks sufficiently large or important in the new whole to cause a modification, it will have to be modified itself in case</page><page sequence="14">14 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES of contradiction. My Father expressly disclaims any desire ' that theological preconceptions as such should tyrannize over the interpretation of the text'. He would have been the last to deny that, with many theological and historical writers of the past, they have done so unduly. But that is not the point. We cannot permit ourselves to be paralysed by the past. And the writer in the Church Quarterly cannot really need to be reminded that' abusus non tollit usum'. The practical question then will not be one of presuppositions or no presuppositions; for they are natural and inevitable. It will be a question of right or wrong presuppositions. And the best way to secure the right ones, and to prevent those we have from becoming over-rigid and tyrannical,—and also, one would have thought, the way least open to the charge of obscurantism,— is to avow one's presuppositions publicly, to have them ever before one's mind, to be continually confirming, modifying, or correcting them by a correlation with new data as they arise. Thus the only safe way to deal with presuppositions is to bring them to clear self-consciousness ; and it is so that both writer and readers are least likely to be misled. This is the method which my Father attempted to put into practice ; and it is their failure to do this, which is the reason of his quarrel with those whom he was criticizing in Ministerial Priesthood. How far he was successful in his attempt to do justice to both elements in experience, the old and the new, may reasonably be matter of controversy. A decision depends on the use made of the method in detail. And this is not the place for such a discussion. But the general principles of method which he professes in the prefaces are surely, when we consider them, not only fair and reasonable, but even obvious and necessary. There are one or two minor points about which it may be worth while to add a few words. On p. 78, speaking of the relation of faith and reason in the Lux Mundi essay, the reviewer says ' We desiderate some clear principle of delimitation, which might help us to fix the frontiers of the understanding . . . and the higher reason'. With this may be compared, p. 84, 'The "combination of obedience that is concretely practical with thought that is speculatively patient" is not the best attitude for dealing with obscure events in past history, when we are trying</page><page sequence="15">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY 15 to discover what actually occurred.' In these two places, the reviewer assumes as axiomatic, that there is a point where idealism can go no further, that there is a region of hard fact, in which the spiritually informed reason is not only not superior, but even inferior, to the logical understanding. Now this ' presupposition' of the reviewer's would have been denied by my Father. Of course, he would have acknowledged that, in some subjects, it is possible to abstract from all moral and spiritual influences with less harm than in others. But the possibility of a ' delimitation of provincesor the existence of a region where the abstract understanding, as such, is a better guide to truth, was utterly foreign to his thought. This is another of those places, where the reviewer seems to fail, because he does not realize the audacity of the thought. The writer is attacking some of the root presuppositions of the ordinary man. It is therefore necessary for the critic to go further back, and to defend, not to assume, those presuppositions. The next point is almost the converse of this. My Father maintains throughout the inseparability of fact and idea. The reviewer has just before been attacking this inseparability from the side of fact. He now attacks it from the side of idea. He draws a contrast between the historical and the philosophical method of treating the question of the ministry, points out that the latter was the more congenial to my Father, and continues: ' The book would have been stronger, if he had frankly set on one side the historical problems about the ministry in the primitive Church. He was not specially well qualified to deal with them as a historical student, and he neither possessed nor desired to possess the kind of impartiality which the investigator of Christian origins must impose on himself, if his work is to rank above an ex parte statement of the evidence.' On the question of impartiality, I have already spoken. And I am not in a position to discuss the more purely historical qualification. But my Father's object, in not ignoring the historical problems, is clear. Though to him mere fact was dead fact, though the ideal element much transcended the factual; idea in total separa tion from fact remained nevertheless barren. Thus the historical facts of the Incarnation were, to his mind, representations in the phenomenal world of eternal truths far transcending those facts;</page><page sequence="16">l6 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES but apart from the facts, we at any rate could have no know ledge of those truths. They would remain merely transcendent and other-worldly. Their own inherent majesty might be untouched; but there would be no guarantee that we had any part or lot in them. The same holds good of the question of the ministry. Any treatment of this, which wholly ignored historical fact, would remain fundamentally incomplete. It would simply hang in the air. We are reminded of this on p. 91, when the reviewer desiderates a fuller discussion of the relation of historical fact to eternal truth. ' If any presence of Christ other than a spiritual presence would now be by comparison unreal, why was it not so always ? What was the use of a historical Incarna tion?' Does not the reviewer here refute his own objection on p. 83 ? The question of presuppositions seems to be involved again in the discussion of my Father's criticism of Bishop Lightfoot. The reviewer accuses him of misunderstanding the Bishop, in holding him to maintain that' the organized Church is not much more than a necessary evil'. According to the reviewer, Lightfoot does not uphold the theory of a purely spiritual Church. ' Church order is a means, not an end. But this declaration is combined with the fullest recognition of the necessity of " appointed days, set seasons, and a ministry of reconciliation", so long as the Church is militant here in earth. In short there are no priests or sacraments in Heaven, but we are not there yet. There is nothing in this to which a Catholic need object; the question is only one of emphasis.' Here one may ask whether there is such a very great difference between holding the ministry to be a necessary evil, and holding it to be a necessary accompaniment of the Church's career on earth, but abolished in Heaven. The reviewer seems to treat it as an axiom, that the ministry is incompatible with the ideal immediateness of the relation between God and the individual, which we must imagine to exist in Heaven. And this is to make it dependent upon the weakness of human nature, and to make it vanish with the disappearance of that weakness. This is not the place to discuss such a presupposition. But it is necessary to point out that it was not my Father's; and therefore that to criticize him on the assumption of this common basis is unjustifiable. He would certainly have declined to</page><page sequence="17">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY 17 dogmatize on the degree of transmutation of the ministry in the ideal reality. But he would not, I think, have accepted as axiomatic the theory that it is, ultimately, to be ' destroyed' rather than ' fulfilled'; or that destruction is the only fulfilment possible to it. To his mind it was not obvious that the existence of an intermediary involves separation, save on a rather crude and mechanical view. It seems permissible then to return a verdict of'Not proven ' to the reviewer's charge of misunder standing Bishop Lightfoot; for between the Bishop's view and his own there is a wide gulf. One other minor criticism of the reviewer's seems to involve some slight misunderstanding. On p. 90, speaking of my Father's discussion of the doctrine of the Trinity, he says: 'He seems to prefer the word persona with its unfortunate legal associations, to the Greek νπόστασις, of which it was an admittedly unsatis factory translation.' This is not the case. What he does prefer to νπόστασίί, is not the Latin word persona, ' with its unfortunate legal associations'; but the English word ' person', with all the fullness of meaning it has come to have for us. He expressly admits that, historically and in the first instance, the translation may have involved some intellectual loss (cf. A. and P. p. 160). It may or may not be worth while to add, that, whereas the reviewer speaks of him as reaching ' the centre of his subject and the meaning of personality' in ch. 9, which is entitled 'Human Personality '; he himself would, I believe, have been inclined to hold that the centre, both of the book as a whole, and of the meaning of personality in particular, was rather to be found in the discussion of Divine personality in the preceding chapter. Throughout the article, my Father's position is represented as something of a compromise, and so somewhat unstable. Thus we are told that Lux Mundi as a whole had * the character of Vermittelungstheologie—of a transitional phase that could hardly be permanent'; and his essay is said to suffer ' from the weakness or inconclusiveness of all arguments which, while professing to be unprejudiced, are conducted without any explicit indication of their ultimate premisses'. Of Ministerial Priesthood we are told that ' it shews that uncertainty of touch which indicates a transitional period in the writer's thought'. And, even as regards Atonement and Personality, 'the book does not VOL. VI. C</page><page sequence="18">18 THE JOURNAL OF THEOLOGICAL STUDIES give the impression that the author's views had quite reached, their final form. If his life had been spared, he would assuredly have discovered that the scholastic and the mystic in his own mind were not in complete harmony.' It is on this central issue that the view of this paper most joins battle with the view of the Church Quarterly article. Those who approached the matter as ' intimates' were impressed, whether in the books or in conversa tion, by nothing more than the completeness and coherency of the philosophy as a whole. Whatever else might be said about it, it could not, they thought, fairly be said that it was not completely worked out. The author might be wrong; consistency might be bought at too dear a price; but at least he had one consistent and far-reaching philosophy. He knew exactly where he stood in every detail. Thus where the reviewer only sees the uncertainty of touch incidental on a' half-way house' theory, pro ceeding from one groping his way he knows not exactly whither; the other view sees a harmonious philosophy, which does not fall between the extremes of ordinary controversy, but goes behind and includes the truth of each. It is obvious that, while this difference as to the general nature of the matter to be criticized exists, there is not likely to be much harmony or mutual understanding, with regard to criticisms in detail. It is, perhaps, necessary to add one word of caution. It is only possible, within the limits of a paper such as this, to dwell in the roughest way on general features. It is impossible not to produce a picture which is, in some ways, one-sided and exaggerated. It would be most unfortunate and untrue if an impression were given that my Father was inclined to pursue logical consistency at the cost of ignoring or slurring over difficulties. Even if his unification prove not to be finally satisfactory, it is not cheap and easy. In this connexion may be noted his insistence on the place of abstractions, such as force or love in our conception of God, and their superiority to a crude anthropomorphism. I have already said that this paper does not pretend to accomplish the impossible, i.e. to be written in a really judicial frame of mind. It is an attempt to represent the impression made by a view such as that of the Church Quarterly article on one who approaches the matter from the other side. And, of course, it has been mainly necessary to dwell on points</page><page sequence="19">ROBERT CAMPBELL MOBERLY ig of difference. But that should not be allowed to obscure the gratitude due to one who has given us, what all must feel to be, on the whole, a sympathetic and illuminating bit of criticism. Moreover, it is obvious that anything like a dogmatic tone in this paper would be in especially bad taste. An apology is perhaps due for faults in this direction. With regard to the very fragmentary treatment of a few points in my Father's teaching, which is all that is attempted here, there is of course no serious effort to appraise the value of that teaching. The attempt has been to indicate on some few points what are the questions which he actually raised; and to point out some directions in which criticism seems, at least, applicable; together with some others in which it appears to be a little beside the mark.
