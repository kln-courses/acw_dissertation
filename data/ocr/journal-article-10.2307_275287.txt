<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EARLY MAN The Bureau of American Ethnology, Smithsonian Institution, continued its investigations at the Lindenmeier Site in northern Colorado during the period from June 15 to September 15. Excavations were carried on in several new portions of the site. In addition to Folsom points and implements similar to those found in previous years, several new types of scrapers were obtained and two tubular bone beads, one of them decorated with series of incised lines, were uncovered. These are the first bone beads to be found in association with the Folsom complex. Numerous animal bones were obtained. Most of these are from the large extinct bison, Taylori, but quite a few are from smaller creatures. Identification of the latter has not been completed but it seems likely that the range of faunal associations will be broadened as a result of the summer's work. No human bones were found. (F. H. H. R. Jr.) ARCTIC AREA A joint expedition of the University of Alaska and the National Museum of Denmark, represented respectively by Dr. Froelich G. Rainey and Mr. Louis Giddings of the University and Mr. Helge Larsen of Denmark, excavated at Point Hope on the Arctic coast of Alaska during the summer of 1939. A large underground house of Thule age was excavated at Jabbertown, about four miles south of Point Hope, and two cuts were made in the old midden at the Point. More important, however, was the discovery of a much more ancient site, Ipiutak, representing a new and distinctive culture, differing in many respects from any previously known Eskimo culture. Nine houses were excavated at this site and a large number of artifacts recovered. The houses were square or rec- tangular, about five meters on a side, constructed probably of sod, some logs and poles, with no stones or whale bones. Unlike other Eskimo houses, there was no entrance passage; the houses all had an open hearth in the center in which wood and oil were burned together. Among the most striking features of the Ipiutak culture may be mentioned the absence of slate blades, lamps, and pottery, and the abundance of chipped flint implements, including numerous new and unusual forms. Of some fifty implement types recognized in the col- lection, about one-half are characteristically Eskimo, about one-half are new. There are two types of harpoon heads. One, with open socket and trifurcated basal spur and small side blades of flint, is generally similar to the Birnirk but closer to the type from Geist's "Old Punuk" site on Punuk Island, at the eastern end of St. Lawrence Island. The other type has a closed socket, blade slit at right angles to the line hole and an unusual form of basal spur, triangular in cross section. Many of the artifacts are decorated, the style of art being closest to the Old Punuk with a single example of Old Bering Sea style 2. Students of Eskimo prehistory will eagerly await a full description of this 233</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY important discovery; a preliminary report will be issued within the next few months. Following the work at Point Hope, Mr. Giddings continued work on St. Lawrence Island for the Universitv of Alaska. Dr. Rainey continued his investigations of Indian sites in the interior of Alaska in May and June and succeeded in locating a half legendary flint work shop on the Mosquito fork in the Upper Forty Mile country between the Tanana and the Yukon. The site, which is known as Betsetai, will repay sys- tematic excavation. (H. B. C.) Incidental to his work as assistant to Dr. George M. Stanley on a University of Michigan survey of post glacial beaches along the east coast of Hudson's Bay, George Quimby, Jr., made an incomplete archaeological survey on behalf of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Chicago. Archaeo- logical investigations were most fruitful on the Belcher Islands. A campsite and cemetery were located on Inetelling Island, two campsites on Tukarak Island, and a campsite and cemetery on Flaherty Island. From Eskimos on Tukarak and Inetelling Islands were obtained collections containing open and closed socket harpoon heads, harpoon foreshafts, foreshaft sockets, slate ulus, slate knives, slate projectile blades, a nephrite drill, a soapstone lamp, stone fish hook shanks, bird dart prongs, fish spear prongs, snow knives, bladder dart heads, bone arrow heads, swivels, buttons, harness toggles, bone and slate beads, decorated ivory problematical objects, carved ivory figures, decorated ivory pendants or hair plates, and other objects. The decorated specimens have engraved upon them designs employing such elements at the Y, a double ended Y, curved lines, straight lines, triangles, ladders, spurred lines, dots, independent short lines, and X, and a V. Two problematical objects were decorated with zoomorphic and anthropomorphic figures. The artifacts are representative of Thule and Dorset and unique Belcher Islands features. Dr. Diamond Jenness has suggested the possibility of a decorative similarity between Belcher Island ornaments and Beotuk art. (George I. Quimby, Jr.) NORTHEASTERN AREA Wendell S. Hadlock reports that "During the summer of 1939 the Robert Abbe Museum of Bar Harbor, Maine, carried on excavations at Sorrento, Maine, completely excavating a small shell heap on the property of the Hall Estate and starting excavation on a very extensive shell heap on the property of Mr. Thomas Ewing. "Both shell heaps appear to be similar in their formation and in the types of artifacts that were brought to light. Such artifacts consisted mostly of bone awls, harpoon points, projectile points, needles, and other bone weaving im- plements. Among several highly decorated bone implements was a comb. 234 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND NEWS "Chipped and pecked stone implements were very similar to other shell heap finds of Frenchman's Bay. "Pottery was found throughout the various horizons of the two shell heaps and appears similar to pottery taken from the upper horizons of Taft's Point Shell Mound." The Champlain Valley Archaeological Society, according to John H. Bailey, continued to excavate on the Jesse Rivers site at the junction of Dead and Otter creeks, 4 miles east of Vergennes, Vermont, during 1939. The work brings to a total of 91, the pits explored, and to 9, the number of burials found during the past two seasons. A superposition of cultures seems indicated, the earlier ap- parently occupying a sand bar between the streams. Pits of this period are nearly indistinguishable and contain large side notched quartzite points, cal- cined bits of bone, but no pottery. Bailey attributes this level to the Laurentian Aspect. Clearly more recent pits and the overlying humus produced triangular points; fewer notched points, scrapers; perforators; fragments of conoidal based, corded twig impressed, or rarely incised, grit-tempered pottery; bone awls; antler arrowpoints; a copper awl, as well as other objects. Evidently all the burials pertain to this culture. Edward Brooks, reporting for The Massachusetts Archaeological Society, states that the first work of the organization was on a shell heap site, adjacent to a dry pond basin on Nantucket Island. The shell stratum, consisting princi- pally of quahog valves, with a sprinkling of oyster and scallop, was almost uni- formly 10 cms. thick. Twenty-eight square meters were thoroughly investigated this season to a depth of over 60 cms. Artifact types include trianguloid blades, lozenge-shaped points, gorget fragments, small shell or sand tempered cord impressed potsherds, a pipe stem fragment, and hammerstones. No burials were found. An expedition from the Rochester Museum of Arts and Sciences, in active charge of William A. Ritchie; explored, by permission of the town of Union Springs, a portion of Frontenac Island, in Cayuga Lake, New York, uncovering a rich Laurentian Aspect village and burial site. Ninety-four extended, flexed, bundle, semisitting, and cremated skeletons came to light, 37 accompanied by grave goods consisting principally of bone awls; harpoons of several types, fish- hooks; long flutes; a dagger; an effigy antler comb, turtle shell rattles; deer scapula scrapers; flaking tools, perforated dog, bear, and elk canines; beaver incisor knives or engravers; stone plummets; a bannerstone, many projectile points of various types and sizes; scrapers; drills, celts; adzes; a ground slate point-the first so far known from a New York grave-; various marine shell beads and pendants; and occasional deposits of hematite. In several instances skeletons of both the large and small variety of Indian dog occurred with the human burials. 235</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Additional industrial traits from the refuse mantle and pits comprise the bone gouge, antler arrowshaft straightener, antler arrowpoint, chert spearhead, long narrow chert blade, whetstone, sinewstone, bannerstone, anvilstone, shal- low mortar, muller, chopper, netsinker, steatite vessel, and grit-tempered dentate-stamped pottery, the last two items from the upper zone only. Study of the large series is now under way and apparently the bulk of it pertains to a single occupation. There is good evidence from this and the Brewerton sites excavated in 1937-38 to indicate a temporal overlap between the Lamoka Focus, Archaic Pattern and the Laurentian Aspect. W. J. Wintemberg, of the Division of Anthropology, National Museum of Canada, assisted by Mr. P. M. Pringle, of Toronto, excavated a prehistoric Woodland site in the Grand River valley, near Dunnville, Ontario, during July and August. Considerable instructive material including pottery (some of it Iroquoian), was obtained. Dr. Frank G. Speck has been continuing his field research in religious beliefs and rituals among the Delaware-Munsee and affiliated groups in Ontario, the Cherokee and Catawba in the Carolinas, and the Houma in Louisiana. The Hudson Valley Archaeological Survey, conducted by Vassar College under the direction of Dr. Mary Butler, tested 14 sites in Dutchess County, New York. "Of four sites tested on two islands, Goat and Cruger's, about 25 miles north of Poughkeepsie, three had a black top-soil characterized by a high broken- shell content. These sites yielded a prehistoric culture sequence and semilunar knives in situ. A fourth shell-refuse site, near Poughkeepsie, is eighteenth cen- tury. "In addition to excavating, we started a small museum of local archaeo- logical material, a site survey, files recording local collectors and collections, and a Northeastern archaeological bibliography with emphasis on eastern New York. We got in touch with other groups working in the valley, and found that Mr. William Carr, Director, and James Burggraf, of the Trailside Museum at Bear Mountain, had assembled fine local collections from Orange and Ulster counties, in the west-central part of the Hudson Valley; that the Van Epps- Hartley Chapter of the New York State Archaeological Association was excavating in the northwest, and a group from Hudson was working in the northeast. All of these people, as well as the Poughkeepsie collectors, John Hennessey, Jr., Almon Beneway, and Lawrence Flewelling, to whom we owe our knowledge of Dutchess County sites, went out of their way to help and co- operate with us, and we feel that we have a chance, through our combined efforts, of turning in, in a few years, an outline of prehistory in the Hudson Valley. "Summarizing what we know from the summer's work, we can say that Folsom points are known from this area, three having been found on the surface 236 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="5">NOTES AND NEWS in adjacent fields in Orange County. We have evidence of a yellow soil culture level so far characterized by long narrow projectile points, chipped red slate and grey quartzite tools, lack of pottery and bone implements, underlying a black shell refuse level characterized by broad projectile points, bone imple- ments, and pottery, both plain and decorated. We have seen a site that may yield seventeenth century contact material, and tested an unmistakably eighteenth century one. Hudson Valley sites include rock shelters, camp-sites (sparse material, post-moulds of shelters), shell-middens (much broken shell in black topsoil), and shell-heaps (layers of whole shell, with very little as- sociated soil)." The following brief report on recent work is from Dr. Dorothy Cross: "During the past summer, the archaeological work of the W.P.A. Indian Site Survey, sponsored by the New Jersey State Museum, has been concen- trated on the Delaware River bluff, south of Trenton. An attempt has been made to obtain material for comparison with that of the Abbott Farm, by excavating along the bluff above and below this site. Results indicate that the entire bluff between Trenton and Bordentown at one time or another had been aboriginally occupied, with the Abbott Farm the most densely inhabited. "Allan H. Smith, the State Supervisor of the Project, resigned in September to take up his new duties as a member of the Department of Anthropology at the University of Texas and Nathaniel Knowles Jr., of the University of Penn- sylvania, was immediately designated the new State Supervisor." The Eastern States Archaeological Federation held its Annual meeting at the American Museum of Natural History, New York City, on October 20th and 21st. The Federation is composed of the Archaeological Societies of the Eastern Seaboard States. Formed six years ago with an initial membership of four states, the number has increased to twelve with the admission of Mas- sachusetts and Maine at the present Meeting. It now includes all the states within this area which have organized Archaeological Societies, and enjoys a total membership of over 1500. (W. A. R.) SOUTHEASTERN AREA The University of Kentucky-Works Progress Administration Project com- pleted excavations on two shell heaps along Green River during the summer and continue excavation at Indian Knoll. In the north-central area of the state, excavation of three Fort Ancient village sites was completed; none of them showed any evidence of trade material. In the central area, investigations have gone forward on a large circular earthworks which has proved to be Adena. Laboratory study and analysis, including skeletal restoration has increased with an increase of the staff and workers. Skeletal study attempts to define the Adena physical type and the shell heap types. A recurring trait in the Adena seems to be head deformation by binding with a cord or strap about the fronto-occipital circumference. 237</page><page sequence="6">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY During the summer a- large rock shelter, named Hooton Hollow in apprecia- tion of certain Harvard men doing physical anthropology in this region, was excavated to determnine the stratigraphic occurrence of pottery. In this par- ticular site, whose total depth attained six feet, pottery occurred only in the uppermost foot. Five burials, including one dog, were found in bark and mat lined pits. (William G. Haag.) The L.S.U.-W.P.A. Archaeological Survey of Louisiana moved into its new quarters at the University on October 9. Laboratories, a small museum, offices, and a darkroom are in one wing of the new geology building. The laboratory operations are in charge of George I. Quimby, Jr. Dr. Andrew Albrecht is in charge of the ethno-historical division, and Stuart Kneitzel and Edwin Doran are conducting the field excavations. Mr. James A. Ford, research associate in archaeology, is director of the survey. The survey has just completed excavation of several shell middens around Lake Pontchartrain. The culture of these middens, which are below sea level, seems to show affiliation with Stallings Island in Georgia and the older com- ponents in shell middens in Kentucky and Alabama. This shell midden culture has been placed in the Tchefuncte horizon and is stratigraphically older than the Marksville horizon. At present writing, one report is in press, two more reports nearly com- pleted, and a fourth in preparation. Two sites are being excavated, one a late Coles Creek period mound near Baton Rouge, and a new Marksville period mound group and village site south of Marksville. (George I. Quimby, Jr.) NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AREA The Department of Archaeology of the Ohio State Museum carried on a restricted amount of field work during the past Summer. Holmes Ellis collected comparative material for the Iithic Laboratory from quarries and outcrops in Union County, Illinois, Delaware County, Oklahoma and Harrison County, Indiana. He also gathered additional material in Illinois concerning the cultural affiliations of Hopewellian type flint disks. In Oklahoma, investigations were continued in regard to the so-called "eccentric" points. Excavations were made at two separate localities in Ohio. Three weeks were spent at Fort Ancient in an attempt to recover more evidence relating to the builders of the mounds and earthworks. This work was part of a plan for a systematic re-examination of the entire area. During the course of the work, village site material was found belonging to both the Hopewellian and Fort Ancient cultures. While no definite conclusions can be drawn at this time, the evidence seems to indicate that the earthworks were constructed by Hopewell peoples and later occupied by peoples of the Fort Ancient culture. Following the work at Fort Ancient a week was spent in excavating on a site near Coshocton, Ohio in an endeavor to locate a burial ground which according 238 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="7">NOTES AND NEWS to local traditions had produced "pygmy" burials. No burials or artifacts were recovered but it is thought that the reported burials may have been those of children belonging to the Moravian settlement of Lichtenau. (Richard G. Morgan.) The Division of the Great Lakes of the Museum of Anthropology, Univer- sity of Michigan, brought the second season in the Manitoulin district, Ontario, to a close on September 15. The work for the summer just past involved both excavation and survey. The most important results in the former category are two geologically dateable sites, one beneath a post-Nipissing beach at an eleva- tion of 27 feet, where Woodland pottery was found in water-laid gravels, and another, a non-ceramic site, where several circumstances combine to provide basis for the belief that the site was occupied when the Great Lakes in this locality were about 50 feet higher than at present. Survey work indicated the presence of mounds of stone in the region from Little Current to French River, and also mounds of earth. (E. F. Greenman.) Work was continued in the Jersey County, Illinois Bluff Focus, this being the 9th season of approximately 30 days.each. Ninety-two burials were un- covered, which brings the total up to 661. No new major features were found. The finding of two examples of the os penis of the raccoon with a burial is the only new minor feature. All of the work to date points toward a mixture of a Woodland and a Middle Mississippi Culture. The grave material is more than that usually found with the Woodland and less than that with the Middle Mississippi. The traits of the Woodland Culture that have been found are conoidal, cord-imprinted, grit-tempered pots; Anculosa Beads; flexed burials (82.3%); and cremations. Those of the Middle Mississippi Culture are Marginella, Olivella, disc and cylindrical shell beads; split bone awls; discoidals; extended burials (5.4%) and a shell-tempered pot. The position of 11.4% of the burials could not be de- termined on account of cremation and disintegration; .7% of the burials were secondary. There is a third group of traits that has not been classified. It is composed of handled pipes, pairs of hammer stones, compound burials and burials covered by or associated with limestone slabs or chunks of chert. The most interesting feature has been the pottery. Fourteen restorable pots have been found, the restorations having been made by the Milwaukee Public Museum. Thirteen are grit-tempered and one is shell-tempered. The majority of the grit-tempered pots is typically Woodland with the conoidal base and the cord-imprinting, but there are three in which the bases are definitely rounded and two in which they are not as pointed as usually seen in the average Wood- land pot. The shell-tempered pot has a rounded base and shoulders and a flaring rim with a square opening in the top. An occasional grit-tempered, cord-im- printed sherd has been found in practically all of the mounds opened. 239</page><page sequence="8">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY No village site work has been done because the fields are in crops at the time excavation is possible. (P. F. Titterington.) The Mississippi Valley Federation of Archeological Societies had their first meeting in southern Illinois October 14 and 15. The group convened at the Cahokia State Park and the following sites were visited Saturday: Fort Chartres, Fort Gage, Prairie de Rocher, and dinner and a discussion were held at the lodge of the Giant City State Park. Next day the Mill Creek Quarry and workshop were visited. The trip ended at the Wickliffe Mounds, Wickliffe, Kentucky. The following states were represented: Illinois, Missouri, Kentucky, Indiana, Kansas, and California. Dr. J. B. Ruyle, 9 Main Street, Champaign, Illinois was elected president and Irvin Peithman of Southern Illinois State Normal University, secretary and treasurer. (Dr. J. B. Ruyle.) The Indiana Historical Society and the Historical Bureau have, during the past eight months sponsored a W.P.A. archaeological project which has con- fined its activity to the Angel Mounds Site located in Vanderburgh County, Indiana. The site, purchased by the Indiana Historical Society during 1938, is extensive and important. Although considerable headway has been made with exploration during the season, a great deal of time was devoted to the many preliminaries coincident with a large excavation project. As bad weather approaches we are taking steps toward the erection of a building which will permit laboratory work on the grounds during the period when work outside is out of the question. The site has been extremely prolific but due to the fact that the material has not as yet been studied, little can be said regarding cultural affinities. It is known, however, that the site will represent a relatively pure manifestation of Middle Mississippi with a suggested affinity to the southeast rather than to the south and southwest. An abundance of painted ware having complex design elements has been one of the unexpected features of the excavation to date. House sites are square with the wall posts set in trenches. Round corners are formed by placing small posts in individual holes. Burials are, so far, both flexed and extended and totally devoid of grave artifacts. It is hoped that, before the date of the next issue of AMERICAN ANTIQUITY, some statistical data relative to the material culture of the site will be available. Field work outside will continue as long as the weather permits. (Glenn A. Black.) Through its sponsorship of the state-wide W.P.A. Museum Extension Proj- ect, the Illinois State Museum has had an interest in five archaeological sites in Illinois this past field season. This program has been under the general direction of Dr. Thorne Deuel, Chief of the Illinois State Museum, and Harriet M. Smith, State Supervisor of the Museum Extension Project. Historical sites at Cahokia and Fort Massac were investigated under the co-sponsorship of the Illinois State Parks, Division of Architecture and 240 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="9">NOTES AND NEWS Engineering. Paul Maynard supervised the work, first as a W.P.A. superin- tendent, and later as the staff archaeologist of the Division of Architecture and Engineering. The excavation program at the Kincaid site, under the direction of Dr. Ed- ward Spicer, made use of W.P.A. Museum Project personnel this year under the cooperating sponsorship of the University of Chicago, Department of Anthropology, and of the Illinois State Museum. A similar cooperating sponsorship between the University of Chicago and Southern Illinois State Normal University Museum was responsible for the excavation of two sites in the Carbondale area, as follows: A supposed Hopewellian site at Boulder was dug by W.P.A. labor under the direction of Joseph Chamberlain and Roger Willis of the University of Chicago. Excavation of the rock shelter at Cove Hollow was completed this season under the direction of Moreau Maxwell of the University of Chicago, as W.P.A. superintendent. Maxwell is continuing an archaeological survey of the carbondale area through the fall and winter seasons. (Thorne Deuel.) Field work in Iowa during the 1939 season began in early June and is to continue until about December 1. Work has concentrated on two Mill Creek sites, the Broken Kettle and the Kimball, the former on Broken Kettle creek about a mile from the junction of this stream with the Big Sioux river, twelve miles northwest of Sioux City, and the latter two and a half miles south of the Broken Kettle on a terrace of the Big Sioux. Mr. Ellison Orr is field supervisor of the crew of from six to ten W.P.A. workers. To date (November 9) more problems have confronted us than have reached a solution, a fact that makes it necessary to begin in 1940 (provided W.P.A. holds out) where we leave off in 1939. The cultural residue on each site being from eight to ten feet in depth, progress is necessarily show. (Charles R. Keyes.) The field party of the Department of Anthropology of the University of Minnesota, under Dr. L. A. Wilford was comprised of three students and from four to ten W.P.A. laborers. The season lasted from July 19 to September 21. The first site studied was a rock shelter in the base of the standstone bluffs facing the Mississippi River, southeast of La Moille, near Winona, Minnesota and lying across the river from the mounds of Elemental Hopewell culture at Trempeleau, Wisconsin. The site was covered by a deposit reaching a maxi- mum height of 15.2 feet above the floor, and containing animal bones, quanti- ties of fish bones, charcoal and hearths. Only nineteen artifacts were found; a few thick sherds decorated with cord-wrapped paddle markings were found in the middle and top layers. Pottery and artifacts were unquestionably Wood- land, but too few to permit classification into any of the divisions of the Wood- land pattern or to show any cultural sequence. No materials of Oneota culture, the last prehistoric culture of this area, were present. It is concluded that this was primarily a fishing site of peoples of Woodland culture, and that the shelter 241</page><page sequence="10">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY was filled and covered over before the arrival of the peoples of Oneota culture. Two large mounds on the Rainy River west of International Falls, Minne- sota, were than studied. These mounds are known as the McKinstry group, and the larger has been dug into sporadically by amateurs for more than forty years. Only the eastern end of this mound was excavated. It yielded 213 arti- facts and quantities of potsherds, all clearly of the Laurel focus and had been built over a habitation site of people of that culture. Only disturbed burials were encountered. The smaller mound contained 95 burials, mass burials concentrated in three small localized areas of the mound. These were primary burials in a slumped kneeling position. In most cases a portion of the occipital bone was removed, a Laurel feature, but none of the long bones were tapped for marrow in the Laurel manner. Fires built on the surface had baked the black clay of the mound until it was hard and crumbly and of a brick-red color, to a depth of a foot or more. Where an area of baked clay was above a burial group the bones beneath it were calcined, some very thoroughly so. Two of the groups were thus affected, in each case part of the skeletons of the group being calcined, while the re- mainder were not. Some of the crania had their eye sockets filled with yellowish clay; in the calcined skeletons these had become hard plugs of pottery. There was a large amount of potsherds, almost equally divided into Laurel and Blackduck types. The Laurel focus is the only focus in the Rainy River aspect and is found thus far only along the Rainy River which forms part of the international boundary. The Blackduck focus is the sole focus of the Head- waters Lakes aspect, and it centers around the large lakes at the headwaters of the Mississippi River, about seventy-five miles south of the Rainy River. Both aspects belong to the Lake Michigan phase of the Woodland pattern. There were 268 artifacts. Those not associated with burials were Laurel types. Association with the burials were twenty-five small mortuary pottery vessels and small copper ornaments. The mortuary vessels were not characteristic of the pottery of either group but more nearly resemble the Laurel. It is concluded that both mounds were built of material taken from a former Laurel habitation site, but the culture of the builders of the mounds awaits upon a further study of the materials for its determination.(L. A. Wil- ford.) PLAINS AREA The Department of Anthropology of Columbia University continued its archaeological investigations in the Plains area last summer by excavations in two village sites near Pierre, South Dakota, and surface collections at several other sites along the Missouri River between the Cheyenne River and Chamber- lain, South Dakota. The excavations were made in cooperation with the Uni- versity of South Dakota as a part of the state-wide Works Projects Administra- tion archaeological program of that institution. The Columbia work was under the supervision of Mr. Albert Spaulding. A party of five Columbia students was in the field from June to September. 242 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="11">NOTES AND NEWS The first site excavated was a very large prehistoric village surrounded by a ditch having regular bastions. Both round and subrectangular houses were present. The pottery is basically of the Upper Republican type, but other in- fluences are present. This is the first time a fortified Upper Republican site has been reported. On the basis of ceramic and architectural details it would appear to be late prehistoric and perhaps transitional between Upper Republican and Lower Loup Aspects. The second site is probably protohistoric Arikara, dating from the period shortly before the visit of Trudeau to the region in 1794. (W. Duncan Strong.) The Archaeological Survey of the Nebraska Historical Society, A. T. Hill, Director, was continued during the field season of 1939 w ith the aid of the Work Projects Administration of Nebraska. Work in the field began during the month of March and continued till the latter part of October. Two units were in operation the majority of the season. In April, May and June, a site was dug in Chase County, in the southwest part of Nebraska, under the supervision of Perry Newell, University of Nebraska, and Carlyle Smith, Columbia University. This was a large village site which proved to belong to the Dismal River culture, and in view of the area excavated, data recorded, and specimens recovered may well become the "type site" for this culture. The scarcity of trade material indicates that this was probably one of the very early contact sites. A few round houses were found, and a great many irregular pits. This field had been plowed and it is possible that originally there were houses above these pits. One unit supervised by Perry Newell spent the last half of June and the month of July digging on Barn Butte, a site in Garden County in western Nebraska. This butte has a covering of about three feet of windblown soil in which artifacts had been found. Trenches were cut through to bed rock and material was taken out by levels. Most specimens were found in the bottom 8-10', but no cultural stratification was apparent. A very few sherds were found, but artifacts of flint were in the great majority. No attempt to tie this site in with any other culture has been made as there has not yet been time for a laboratory analysis and comparison of specimens. During the months of June, July, and August, one unit of the project, super- vised by John Champe, Columbia University, concentrated upon two "contact" sites on the south bank of the Platte River, southwest of Linwood, in east central Nebraska. Site #1, at the mouth of Skull Creek, contained an abundance of trade material indicating excellent trading facilities. Earth lodges, storage pits and burials were excavated at this site. Another "contact" site two miles south of Skull Creek contained less trade material and more pottery. The traits present at these two sites were similar, the main difference being, the lesser quantities of European objects in the latter. Both were apparently occupied by a people bearing the material culture of the early Pawnee Indians. One rock shelter was excavated during the early part of July under the 243</page><page sequence="12">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY direction of Mr. A. T. Hill in Garden County in southwestern Nebraska. Several occupational levels were excavated with definite pottery types which seem to confirm previous conclusions as to the relative age of the principal Plains cultures. From July till the latter part of October one unit supervised by Carlyle Smith, Columbia University, and Marvin Kivett, University of Nebraska, excavated prehistoric sites on Davis Creek, thirty miles north of Grand Island, in central Nebraska. Approxmiately thirty earth lodges, seventy burials, and many storage pits were excavated in this vicinity. These sites contained a mix- ture of the "Nebraska" and "Upper Republican" culture traits. One of these sites was excavated intensively. The remainder were tested by means of the excavation of two or three houses so that a comparison of traits might be made. Skeletal material was excavated and definitely linked with these cultures in at least two sites. One site in Valley County on Mira Creek in central Nebraska was ex- tensively excavated under the supervision of Marvin Kivett. Cultural materials differed from those of "Nebraska-Upper Republican" types usually found in that vicinity. The pottery tended toward larger vessels, with coarse grit temper- ing, conical base, heavy cording and straight or very slightly flaring rims. Shallow oval semi-subterranean basins with and without fireplaces were exca- vated. The entire cultural pattern is apparently more closely connected with some phase of the "Woodland" culture of Eastern United States than with the remainder of the material excavated in that locality. (A. T. Hill) The summer's work of the Division of Archaeology of the National Museum involved a continuation of the Museum's archaeological survey of Kansas. There were two primary objectives: First, a determination of the degree to which Puebloan influences had penetrated western Kansas and second, an attempt to inject time perspective into the archaeology of the region. A month was devoted to explorations in and near Scott County State Park where Willis- ton and Martin excavated a Pueblo ruin about forty years ago. Middens about the structure yielded pottery, chipped stone, much bone work and a few pieces of copper, iron and glass. Charred corn and squash or gourd rinds indicate some horticulture but great quantities of animal bones suggest that subsistence was based primarily on the chase. Contrary to expectations, Pueblo influences were almost negligible. The ruin itself and near by irrigation canals are presumably of Southwestern origin; otherwise there was a bare handful of possibly painted sherds and a few tubular clay pipes of late Pueblo style. Most of the material recovered shows close relationship to the Dismal River Culture sites concur- rently investigated by the Nebraska Historical Society in southwestern Nebraska. Roasting and large irregular trash pits were plentiful but no house sites were found. In general, the complex is much more suggestive of Plains than of Southwestern origin. From the evidence available, it would seem to be at- tributable to an early historical group with semi-horticultural habits. The exact 244 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="13">NOTES AND NEWS relationship between this material and the Pueblo structure itself is not yet clear. It is perhaps permissible to suggest an Apache or Comanche provenience for this material. Just outside the north entrance to the park, a small burial ground yielded two long-headed skeletons and several secondary interments. Accompanying the skeletons were broken tortoise shells, chipped knives, flints and scrapers and a few bone beads. There was no contact material but one large stemmed projec- tile point suggests the common "Woodland" type of the plains. Persistent search failed to disclose any evidence of an associated village or camp site. Another month was spent on Salt Creek in Lane County about twenty miles farther east and about six miles northwest of Healy. The principal site proved to be stratified. On and just below the surface was Upper Republican material quite similar to that previously found in the Republican Valley of southern Nebraska. Two small pithouses, each with four center posts, were worked out. Along with shallow midden deposits, they yielded Upper Republican pottery, arrowheads, a bone fish hook, etc, but no direct proof of horticulture. Beneath this horizon was a sterile stratum varying up to a foot in thickness which was underlain by a second cultural layer. The yield from this was comparatively light but thick cord-roughened sherds and stemmed projectile points contrast sharply with materials from the top stratum. This second horizon, evidently linking with some plains "Woodland" manifestation, had been intruded by both Upper Republican houses. Beneath one of the pithouses and definitely in- clusive in the "Woodland" horizon was a rocker roughened sherd, strikingly reminiscent of those found in 1937 at Hopewellian village sites near Kansas City, Missouri. Time and funds were inadequate to permit investigation of what may be a third culture horizon underlying both of those above mentioned. It is interesting to note that local collectors report the finding of Pawnee as well as of shell tempered potsherds, together with some copper, glass beads and catlinite on the wind-eroded surface of this site. Tentatively summarized, the researches of the National MIuseum would seem to show that in Lane and Scott Counties there were at least two groups of prehistoric pottery-making peoples and that on stratigraphic evidence those bearing the "Woodland" culture preceded others with Upper Republican af- filiations. So far as now known, neither of these was in contact with South- western peoples. Still later, in protohistoric times, a third complex attributable to the Dismal River Culture, occupied the area. This sequence parallels that previously established, and further strengthened this summer, in western and southwestern Nebraska. It might be added further that western Kansas, be- cause of the very limited occurrence of reliable springs and consequent repeated use of desirable localities by successive peoples, would appear to offer unusual opportunities for the determination of culture sequence through stratigraphic methods: (W. R. W.) During the summers of 1938 and 1939 the University of South Dakota Mu- 245</page><page sequence="14">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY seum has sponsored archaeological surveys of the state with W.P.A. labor. During the summer of 1938 Mr. E. E. Meleen supervised a project on Fire Steel Creek, Mitchell, Davison County. Two house sites and three mounds were excavated, the latter yielding, aside from poorly preserved skeletons, little material which would aid in determining the cultural relationship between the builders of the mounds and the early occupants of the village. The house sites yielded abundant material, both on the old floors and in the "cache" holes, the latter scattered over the floors and around outside of walls, including numerous bone arrowpoints and peculiarly shaped bone knife handles in which blades of flint had been inserted. The type of pottery appears to be similar to that found in Iowa and later may show that these people migrated here from the east. The Lions Club of Mitchell is reproducing a replica of one of the rectangu- lar lodges in the old village. During 1939 a state-wide project was approved and three parties have been in the field during the summer. Mr. E. E. Meleen supervised work at the Brandon site along the Big Sioux River, Minnehaha County for six weeks, excavating six house sites and two mounds. Meager material was taken from the house sites which may indicate an occupancy of short duration. The mounds on the opposite side of the river appeared to exhibit a longer period of occu- pancy but their cultural relationship is not clearly established. By September first Mr. Meleen moved to what is known as the Twelve Mile Creek Village, six miles east of Dimmock, Hutchinson County. This site is on the second floodplain of a small creek running east into the James River. It is entirely surrounded by hills or the higher terraces. The lodges were found to be rectangular in shape. The first one excavated contained more than thirty "cache" pits which were rich in artifacts and pot- sherds. Four nearly whole pots were found. A nearby mound yielded about forty skeletons, all in a poor state of preservation, no potsherds, and only a few small shell beads. Work at this site has been discontinued for the winter and Mr. Meleen has charge of the archaeological laboratory at the University Museum. The rock shelter project of the Black Hills was supervised by Mr. J. J. Pruitt. Evidence may suggest a connection with some part of the mountainous region to the southwest but more work will be necessary to determine this. Mr. Pruitt and the writer spent several weeks in photographing and drawing cliff markings and paintings on rock walls. The material found by all parties was sent to the archaeological laboratory at the University Museum where it was classified and catalogued for future reference. (W. H. Over.) The North Dakota Historical Society did not have any large parties or large projects in operation the past summer. ?We did, however, have one man on a W.P.A. project who did a considerable amount of work. Included in the work 246 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="15">NOTES AND NEWS done was a survey of the west bank of the Missouri for a distance of some 150 miles, in which a dozen or more new village sites were discovered and accurately described and located. In addition a considerable amount of intensive work was done on the Huff village site belonging to our State Historical Society. In the course of this work it was somewhat surprisingly discovered that instead of the usual round earth lodge which has been the type always heretofore found in the village sites of North Dakota, the house remains definitely show that the buildings were rec- tangular throughout all of the site so far as can be now determined. One house was entirely worked out to the floor level; corners of several others were opened to determine that the rectangular characteristic was present. Our State Historical Society is hopeful that a larger project and more ex- tensive work can be done during 1940. (George H. Will.) SOUTHWESTERN AREA The third annual anthropological conference sponsored by the University of New Mexico was held at Chaco Canyon August 26th, to 28th, with an at- tendance of ninety-nine, Dr. Leslie Spier reports. Although the majority were archaeologists there was a fair representation of ethnologists and others specializing in the Southwest. A running survey was made of the area from central Mexico to Colorado and Utah, and from Texas to southern California, with informal reports on current field investigations and discussion of their implications. By reason of the presence of a number of workers from each of the regions, special attention was given to cave and other cultures of the Big Bend, Texas, to early horizons of southern Arizona and west Texas, and to a new set of discoveries in Michoacan and neighboring states in central Mexico. (It is worth noting for other conferences that the survey approach was favored by participants as against that of discussing set problems.) Dr. E. B. Renaud writes that the University of Denver took its usual two weeks' student trip through northern New Mexico beginning in June, and that for the fourth time he again went, with six assistants, to southwestern Wyoming for supplementary field work in the Black's Fork Basin. More exploration was done, adding some new sites and a systematic collection of artifacts by terraces at important sites. Twenty-five sites were visited, with eighteen boxes of speci- mens collected which are now being studied in the laboratory. A report of the field and laboratory work is now in preparation, to be Number 12 in the Survey Series of University of the Denver. Dr. C. T. Hurst reports that during May the Museum of the Western State College of Colorado completed the excavation of a small rock shelter in Sa- guache County. It is a shallow open cave, the deposit in which is only about eighteen inches deep. Without exception the material proved to be Ute, and indicated the cave was used by hunting parties over many centuries. Evidences 247</page><page sequence="16">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY of chipping, of food, of the preparation of meals and the dressing of hides were found, and all projectiles were arrows and not darts. Only one level showed de- finite occupation. In August, a project was begun on a large cave in Tabeguache Canyon in Montrose County. The site is affiliated with Basket Maker culture, although it lies outside of what is usually considered to be Basket Maker range in this part of Colorado. The work done has only succeeded in scratching the surface, because of the difficulties of excavation due to the hundreds of tons of fallen rock. The cave was the summer home for a corn growing people, much of the corn found indicating it had been eaten in the milk stage. All weapon ma- terial was definitely atlatl. An archaeological expedition of the Colorado Museum of Natural History, headed by Marie Wormington, in July and August, completed excavation of a rock shelter southwest of Delta, Colorado, where investigations had been con- ducted for the past two seasons. The site shows evidence of a previously unre- ported people with a hunting economy, supplemented to some extent by the gathering of wild foods. A rich stone and bone complex was found, but no in- dication of any knowledge of agriculture, and no pottery or masonry. During this season, basketry was found for the first time. There is some suggestion that it may be prehistoric Ute. Additional work was done on a series of sites on the A. J. Turner ranch in the Book Cliffs, thirty miles northwest of Cisco, Utah. They include a circular fort, a series of low stone circles, presumably used as lookout points, numerous cists under shallow overhangs, and a rather large vil- lage site. In the latter were found circular structures of crude masonry, and slab- lined cists. Pottery types include Fremont ware, Deadmans Black-on-white and Black-on-red, and Classical Chaco. Two burials were also found. Dr. H. P. Mera of the Laboratory of Anthropology writes that excavation of a series of caves in northeastern New Mexico was undertaken in the spring and is being carried through the fall months. This is a continuation of a proj- ect begun several years ago. Excavation is being done by E. T. Hall, Jr. Joe H. Toulouse, Jr., has written that the Museum of New Mexico has just closed its excavation and repair work of the Mission of San Gregorio, where the first restorable pieces of Mexican maiolica ware in this neighborhood have been found. It has also shown that Tewa Polychrome, Chupadero Black-on- white, and an early form of Tsia Polychrome were contemporaneous with this period, of from 1629 to 1672 or 1678. The architecture of the mission is a unit with very few additions. Animal refuse material was predominantly Bison, and domestic sheep and goat. Privately he has been at work on a series of early sites in west central New Mexico, which consist of hearths and artifacts found in situ. The small round muller, or mano, has been found with an oval bowl metate, as well as end and side scrapers, gravers, and in some instances (which are be- lieved later than others), side notched points with expanded base drills. Other projectile points of interest are some which are heavy and crude and of a type [3, 1940 248</page><page sequence="17">NOTES AND NEWS not yet described, as well as some similar in nature to the Pinto Points of southern California. No pottery has been proven to be associated. Dr. Kirk Bryan has expressed interest in, and hopes to do some work on, the geology of these sites. Concerning the W.P.A. work in New Mexico Erik K. Reed has reported that after Hendron finished his work on the kiva at Pecos it was carried on for a short while by Mrs. Tichy, and now by John Corbett, who thereby was re- moved from Quarai, where the work he has been doing was continued by Wes Hurt. The work at Presidio, Texas, under Kelly and Lehmer, is extremely im- portant and interesting, he reports, for it ties into the historic period. The site was visited by Espejo both coming and going, and one of their horizons is that of the historic Patarabueyes at La Junta. The first horizon is that of El Paso Polychrome. In addition Kelly and Dr. Claude Albritton, Jr. (geologist of S.M.U.), have worked out in the region of Alpine a good succession of erosion and deposition intervals which have been correlated with types of archaeologi- cal sites. In Arizona the W.P.A. continues with the state-wide project at the Museum of Northern Arizona, where a small group of laboratory assistants are at work on restoration and preparation problems, at Pueblo Grande where like work is being done, and at the University of Arizona at the State Museum. Regarding similar activity at Globe, Mrs. Irene Vickrey writes that it consists at the pres- ent time only of laboratory work, where pottery and bone material from the Salado site of Besh-ba-gowah (excavated 1935-1938), is being prepared for analysis and display in the Gila County Museum. A Hohokam site at Inspira- tion was also excavated during the past year, to reveal superposition of Salado houses over early Hohokam dwellings, and substantiate sherd findings showing Hohokam in Gila County by 400 A.D. (as dated by the series worked out at Snaketown). Data from this site is being compiled for a report, and materials are being studied and reconstructed. Most of the work of the National Park Service, as reported by Reed, is in the nature of stabilization, which has been distributed throughout several monu- ments. Recently J. H. Tovrea has done such work at Montezuma's Castle, and additional work is planned at Tonto Cliff-dwelling National Monument. The Indian C.C.C. unit under Gordon Vivian has done a good deal of stabilization at Chaco Canyon National Monument, particularly at Pueblo Bonito, Pueblo del Arroyo, and Kin Klizhin, as well as at Aztec. J. W. Hendron, with a small C.C.C. crew has been stabilizing ruins in the Rito de los Frijoles in Bandelier National Monument, on which he is to report shortly. This year Robert Lister has conducted the work in this section. Last August Charley Steen similarly repaired Inscription House in Arizona. In the Grand Canyon National Park archaeological Reconnaissance-survey work has been under way for several years. Edward T. Hall surveyed sites in the Valhalla Plateau in 1937, and during the past year Carlton Wilder has been surveying in the western portion of the canyon in the vicinity of the Thumb. 249</page><page sequence="18">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY Other work has been done from time to time with the assistance of C.C.C. en- rolles. From southern Arizona W. S. Fulton writes that he and his organization have completed their field work at a site near Gleeson, Arizona, and are now studying the material with a view to publishing the results. The next field ef- fort will be at a site on the San Pedro River between Pomerene and Cascabel, where the surface indications are most promising. For a good many years Southwestern Archaeologists have been interested in the problem of tracing back the history of certain local living groups. (This has elsewhere been termed the historical approach to archaeology.) The first serious investigation of this type was on the Pueblos, but more recently, work has been directed to unraveling the history of such groups as the Pimas, Papagaos, and Navahos. The University of Arizona is now engaged in an examination of the early history of the Pimas, but several institutions, agencies, and individuals are now at work on the historical Navaho problem. In a complete report, which is only briefly summarized here, Richard Van Valkenburgh has sent the editor a summary of the history of Navaho Archae- ology. He states that the work started in 1935 in the Canyon de Chelly and Tsehta'tah Canyons, in which historic sites were examined. Three types of pottery, Navajo Plainware, Navajo Red, and Navajo Polychrome were recog- nized, as well as three house types, sticks forked together (semi-pit); flat roofed hogan, and circular laid stones. In 1936 the study expanded and work was started in the upper forks of Largo Canyon, Blanco Canyon, and the mesas forming the rim of the Chaco drainage. This work, portions of which have al- ready been reported on, was carried on to the summer of 1939. A number of sites were excavated by Malcolm F. Farmer. These are to be described in a forthcoming publication. Paramont among the culture criteria is the hogan type, which in many cases is associated with rough stone watchtowers and breastworks. In 1937 Roy L. Malcolm, under the direction of Dr. Clyde Kluck- holm made a survey of the possibilities of Navaho archaeology in Chaco Can- yon, which has been reported in AMERICAN ANTIQUITY. During the same year Elizabeth Murphy, of the School of American Research, made surveys in the Huerfano region, upper Largo Canyon, and Crown Point regions. In 1938 Van Valkenburgh studied a late historic site in Mexican Canyon near Cove, New Mexico, and surveyed as far north as Dove Creek in Colorado. In the summer of 1939 he investigated sites which appear to be early Navaho on the western slopes of the Blue Mountains in southeastern Utah. In June and July of this year Dorothy L. Keur writes that she and John Keur, under a grant from Columbia University, surveyed and excavated sites in Guadelupe Canyon, Sandoval County, New Mexico. The types of sites ex- amined consisted of hogans or house sites (of which over 90 were excavated) lean-to's, caches, fortifications, and sweat houses. Two basic types of hogans were found, one of forked sticks, the other of stone rings. The lean-to's were poles placed against trees. Caches were formed by walling up natural openings. 250 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="19">NOTES AND NEWS Fortifications varied from impressive twelve-foot walls with peepholes across defensible necks, to irregular piles of rocks. Sweat houses were evidenced by piles of fire reddened rocks and firepits. Artifacts found on the surface and in fills consisted of both plain and painted Navaho pottery, chipped and ground stone, and bone. Anasazi trade pottery was rarer. Several wood specimens were collected. Van Valkenburgh has suggested that the most interesting phase of this work is the informal group who are engaged in it. Some six individuals now in- tegrate their work and plan a central sherd and tree-ring specimen depository. Eventually a symposium on Navaho archaeology is also planned. (J. C. McG.) PACIFIC COAST AREA During July new archaeological research was begun in central Washington by Mr. Alex D. Krieger, formerly with the University of California and the University of Oregon, but now with the University of Texas. Coulee Dam of- ficials having stipulated that no unauthorized digging could be done in the future flowage above the Dam, it was not until Mr. Krieger began operations that any serious excavation was undertaken. The survey was made possible through the generosity of Mr. Joel E. Ferris of the Spokane and Eastern Bank, Spokane, Washington, who furnished expense money, and through the active support of J. E. Miner, Acting Supervising Engineer at Coulee Dam, and his assistant, Mr. N. E. Halder. Through the engineers a stationwagon and credit cards were obtained and every possible courtesy cheerfully extended. From July 6 to July 23, both banks of the Columbia from Coulee Dam to the Canadian border, a distance of 150 miles, were rather thoroughly scouted for sites. Twenty-one large sites which should yield valuable materials were mapped on the Columbia itself, while a few smaller ones on the lower reaches of the Sanpoil, Spokane, and Kettle rivers were also seen. During all this work, Mr. Krieger was given invaluable assistance by Mr. William Andrews, Indian, of Wellpinit, Washington, who acted as interpreter and succeeded in extracting a large amount of information regarding burial sites and former burial customs from Indians on Colville Reservation. It developed that here is an unparalled opportunity for excavating and at the same time checking data with informants whose memories are still surprisingly vivid. Test-pitting was conducted at some sites. Near the mouth of the Sanpoil eight graves were discovered in two days; on the Spokane graves were found in good preservation in a rock slide. The testing revealed with certainty that there are large amounts of skeletal remains to be found. These will be particularly valuable in view of the utter lack of documented skeletal remains from the Middle Columbia area. The only archaeological records to date on this vast area are those of Harlan I. Smith in Yakima Valley, Herbert W. Krieger at Wahluke, and the well-known paper by Strong, Schenck, and Steward in The Dalles-Deschutes area. All are 150 miles or more to the southwest of the present 251</page><page sequence="20">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY study. The survey revealed that practically all materials are imbedded in enor- mous sand banks, often a half-mile long and six feet deep, and in graves made in the bases of equally enormous rock slides. Since Mr. Krieger's departure for Texas in late July the work has been car- ried on under the direction of Dr. Philip Drucker, assisted by Messrs. Allen H. Murphy and Arlo Ford, of Oregon. The National Youth Administration is furnishing from eight to twelve men to do the work, which is being carried on under the auspices of the Department of Anthropology, University of Wash- ington, and the Eastern Washington State Historical Society. Excavation will take place throughout the entire extent of the flowage area, and all possible types of sites will be investigated. Specimens will be brought to the Spokane Public Museum for study and preparation. Dr. Arthur Woodward reports concerning the summer's work of the Los Angeles Museum of History, Science and Art: "During the months of July-August, 1939, the Los Angeles Museum con- ducted a biological and archaeological survey of four channel islands, San Nicolas, San Miguel, Santa Rosa and Santa Cruz. The archaeological work con- sisted mainly in locating and placing on maps, as many village sites as possible. This was done by tramping on foot from midden to midden, making surface collections, digging occasional test pits and studying the problem of site erosion. "On San Nicolas Island where we were encamped from July 22 to July 28, I noted approximately 48 sites from the east end sand spit to the west end and thence south and southeast across the top of the island. Type collections of shells, bones, and likewise of artifacts were secured. The latter were limited in number and type of specimen, shell fishhooks predominated. I obtained one regular cremation burial on the extreme eastern end of the island which was ac- companied by two tubular pipes and burned beads. "All sites on San Nicolas are badly eroded. It is my personal belief that we shall not find any sites of extreme age on any of these islands. Likewise I noted an interesting natural phenomenon which seems worthy of recording. "On San Nicolas one sees great beds of land snails (Micrarionta tryoni, Newc.). These are found both on and away from kitchen middens. At first glance it would appear that the Indians had been feasting but the truth of the matter is that these snails cluster on certain plants such as lupine, stragulus, etc. Here the snail colonies breed, live and die. The dead shells pile up under the plants and in time a respectable 'shell midden' is built up. After sheep were introduced many of the favorite food plants of the snails were entirely destroyed leaving only the beds of whitened shells exposed to the sun and wind. On the northwest side of San Nicolas Island are literally millions of land snails arranged in neat, irregular patterns by the wind on sandy barren surfaces. The only indications that this area was once covered with vegetation are these snails and the lime-like casts of the root network of the herbage that existed here prior to the advent of the hungry sheep. 252 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="21">NOTES AND NEWS "A similar condition prevails to a lesser extent on San Clemente Island where a different species of land snail lives (Micrarionta intercisa). During the period when the Indians occupied the midden sites the food plants of the snails no doubt grew in profusion along the slopes and unoccupied portions of the sites. Hence, the deposition of dead snail shells was a continuous process even in pre- historic times. Therefore, the discovery of these shell deposits mingled with regular midden is not surprising and I believe may safely be judged natural rather than man-made midden. "Approximately forty sites were located on San Miguel and a similar number on Santa Rosa. On the latter island, I found two small sites where the inhabit- ants had apparently done nothing except manufacture olivella shell beads. I surfaced over 1700 small chert drills, a number of beads, bead blanks and recent Canalino type arrowheads and knife blades. "Very little work was done on Santa Cruz Island. "Our expedition returned to Los Angeles, August 19. "We expect to continue this survey with more intensive excavation work on the different islands over a period of five years." President J. B. Lillard of Sacramento Junior College, writes as follows: "The Sacramento Junior College Archaeological Field Party with President J. B. Lillard as director and Franklin Fenenga as field supervisor has been ex- cavating on the Cosumnes and Sacramento rivers. The work done during the past seven years has been mainly in Early and Transitional sites but the college transferred its attention this fall to Late and Historic sites to check as far as archaeology can against written historic data and ethnological reports." (E. W. G.) MIDDLE AMERICAN AREA On November 16, 1939, Dr. Paul Schellhas celebrated his eightieth birth- day. Dr. Schellhas is probably the oldest living Maya student. He published his first article in 1886 and many others in subsequent years. The decipherment of the Maya hieroglyphs owes much to his work. Another of the older generation of Maya students. Erwin P. Dieseldorff, who was intimately associated with Dr. Schellhas and who has also published ex- tensively in the Maya field, celebrated his seventieth birthday on June 10, 1938, at Coban, Guatemala. It was my great pleasure to be present upon that date. Walter Taylor of Harvard University made an archaeological reconnais- sance through the slightly known and sparsely inhabited arid state of Coahuila, Mexico. He covered a good part of the western half of this state. It is probably the least favorable area in Coahuila for archaeological work, and sites are few and difficult of access. But the number of sites and the signs of occupation in the better-watered areas give high promise of easier and more productive work in the future. No excavation was done, the artifacts secured having been found on the surface. 253</page><page sequence="22">A MERICA N A NTIQ UIT Y Sixty-three sites were located, almost all of them caves, many of which con- tained pictographs; the remaining few were pure pictograph sites, chipping areas, and mescal-pit areas. Bed-rock mortar-holes were found in several places. The pictographs can probably be spearated into three types, two of them probably prehistoric, the third historic. Stone artifacts show certain re- lationships to Texas, there being projectile points which closely resemble the Pecos River, Big Bend, and Wichita types. Thumb-nail scrapers, metates and mullers, a three-grooved throwing-stick, twilled mats, a crude sandal, and at least one burial were found. In the absence of excavation, little fiber material was secured. Potsherds of eight types were found, most of them of still unidenti- fied or new wares, but the connections all seem to point towards Texas, espe- cially towards the Conchos-northeast-Chihuahua area: some may be identical with or closely related to El Paso Plain ware and Wichita Buff ware. There are manifestations of several time periods and undoubtedly of several cultural groupings, but it is impossible to determine these until considerable ex- cavation has been done in this and surrounding areas. Mr. Taylor has the feel- ing that the pottery that resembles El Paso Plain ware goes with the cave ma- terial, and that the cave people, who seem related, however distantly, to those of Texas, possessed pottery; they were therefore probably relatively late, pos- sibly after 700 A.D. He believes that the later prehistoric pictographs probably belong with the mortar-holes and the mescal pits and possibly might be ascribed to the nomadic Apache or Comanche; the earlier cave pictographs can be dis- tinguished from these. Dr. Isabel T. Kelly again made researches in the important but little known region of the Pacific Coast of Mexico, conducting a surface survey from Sinaloa to the borders of Michoacan for the Department of Anthropology of the Uni- versity of California in collaboration with the Instituto Nacional de Antro- pologia e Historia. In 1934 she discovered evidences of ancient civilizations of a high order in Sinaloa. Her work at Chametla has been published, and that at Culiacan is in press. Last year she worked further south in the states of Naya- rit, Jalisco and Colima where she discovered extensions of the Sinaloa civiliza- tions as well as new cultures. Her season lasted from January 1, 1939 to the on- set of the rainy season when she shipped some five tons of archaeological ma- terial, mainly pottery, to Mexico City, where she is now engaged in studying it. The work was partly supported by Mrs. Marian Cummings, who accompa- nied Dr. Kelly during part of the work, as did Dr. Sauer. The collection is of particular interest inasmuch as it comes from an area heretofore almost entirely unknown archaeologically. Remains are continuous and plentiful the full length of the coast. The material will permit the deter- mination of several cultural provinces, and appears to offer definite clues as to time differentiation within several of them. The northern coast of Nayarit proves to affiliate with southern Sinaloa (Chametla); the southern coast of Nayarit appears to constitute a separate local province; the coast of Jalisco has 254 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="23">NOTES AND NEWS Sinaloan ties via the Aztatlan complex, although in a large measure the culture is local. The area from Colima to Michoacan comprises a distinct major prov- ince. Of especial interest is the possibility of a chronological tie between Colima and the Valley of Mexico. From a tomb despoiled by pot hunters fragments of a restorable vessel of thin orange (Teotihuacan III) was taken, associated with a series of local Colima wares. The latter include several vessels of an entirely new lacquer-like (al fresco) ware. A tentative date of 1100 for this Colima tomb is suggested by this association. Brief excavations in Colima are planned for the spring in the hope of estab- lishing a local chronological sequence and equating this to known chronologies of the Plateau. As reported by Bertha P. Dutton in El Palacio for last May, a party from the School of American Research, consisting of Miss Dutton and Misses Hulda Hobbs and Barbara Loomis, excavated at Tajumulco, Department of San Mar- cos, in southwestern Guatemala during the period from December 1938 to March 1939. Tajumulco is a highland site at an altitude of 2225 meters (almost 7500 feet). The main ruin embraces an area of about 110 X 180 meters (ca. 360 by 600 feet). It consists of three principal mounds with a main plaza in which are carved monuments; tripod tables, zoomorphic and anthropomorphic fig- ures, cylinders, an octagonal stela, and other stones, grouped around a large sculptured fount. One of the mounds had already been trenched and the con- tents of a stone-enclosed chamber removed. The site is still used as a sacred precinct. As the region was practically unknown archaeologically the results are of the greater importance. Unfortunately, attempts to make stratigraphic tests proved fruitless. One mound and a small plaza were excavated. The mound stands 4.29 m. (ca. 14 ft.) above the plaza and resembles a typical plain Maya pyramid with four terraces, and a stairway on the north side. The terraces were built of irregular stones, without obvious trace of stucco plastering. Trenching revealed that it was built by the usual process of accretion, enlarged at suc- cessive periods. Fireplaces, altars, tombs and various structural features were encountered. Fourteen altars, most of which were sculptured, and two zoomor- phic figures were unearthed in the plaza. Twenty-two tombs were excavated in scattered locations, and without par- ticular orientation. These were stone-lined and covered with stone slabs; the mortuary furniture consisted of pottery vessels, small celts, obsidian knives and points, spindle-whorls, seals, beads and pendants, copper bells, tufa mirror back etc. In most, only the teeth remained, but skeletal material was recovered from three tombs. As the sculpture was of a soft stone most of it was badly eroded; the art seems to show elements of Maya and Pipil, together with local peculiarities. No hieroglyphs were observed. The pottery also shows several influences; red-and- buff ware like that at Zacualpa, polychrome ware like El Salvador, orange ware 255</page><page sequence="24">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY like the southwest coast, black ware like Zapotec, and plumbate ware. Some European copper objects and bits of majolica indicate that the site was occu- pied in early colonial times. Plans have been made to continue the work in De- cember 1939. Frans Blom of Tulane University has prepared a very full report on anthro- pological work in Middle America during 1938 for the Handbook of Latin American Studies. I have been favored with a copy of this manuscript from which the following notes have been transcribed or digested. Mrs. Doris Zemurray Stone of the Middle American Research Institute of Tulane University conducted basic archaeological work in the Sula-Uloa region of the Republic of Honduras, and made a fundamental study of the cultures of the northern coast of Honduras. Archaeological work was done at two sites, Travesia, in the Departamento de Cortes, and in caves at San Nicolas, in the Departamento de Santa Barbara. Some pottery material was secured at Travesia but no stratigraphy existed. Most of the objects excavated were of Maya type with Lenca influence; however, a few pieces of "Playa de los Muertos" type were unearthed, and one object which may be pure Pipil. In the San Nicolas caves were found numerous potsherds, of a culture as yet unidentified. Two publications are being prepared upon this work. Work in connection with the Huasteca of the states of San Luis Potosi and Vera Cruz was carried on under the direction of E. J. Palacios and W. du Solier of the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia. Several tombs were dis- covered in the City of Zamora in the State of Michoacan. Sr. du Solier also dis- covered a cave painting in the Cerro de la Cruz near San Cristobal Ecatepec, a short distance from Mexico City. General Augustin Melgar, Governor of the Territory of Quintana Roo, ex- plored the Castillo at Tulum, including its substructures, the Temple of the Frescoes, and Temples 9 and 16. He found several new paintings, well-pre- served, and made copies of them. Sr. M. A. Fernandez discovered new paint- ings in Temple 5 and others in the vicinity of Tuncah, all of which he copied. At Tapapulum a ball-court was discovered. In another zone called Chalagtiite, constructed in the form of four great rectangular patios are some very large monoliths representing deities, shells, tigers, etc. It is hoped to explore this site during 1939. Dr. Alfonso Caso made a topographical plan of the archaeological zone of Cerro Negro, in the Mixteca. Explorations comprised two temples and three patios, three tombs and twelve burials and numerous objects, some of them of excellent art quality. At Mitla, reconstruction was carried on in connection with the "System of the Columns," and the "System of the Tombs." Detailed drawings of the monuments were made. Sr. Luis Cuadra Cea of the National Museum of Nicaragua made several archaeological expeditions into the interior. One of the primary sites at which some excavation was carried on was Santiago de los Caballeros de Le6n, on the west side of Lake Managua. 256 [3, 1940</page><page sequence="25">NOTES AND NEWS During 1938 our Middle American field suffered severely through the death of three of its greatest students, Drs. Thomas Gann, Karl Theodor Preuss, and Walter Lehmann. The outstanding publication of 1938 was Dr. Sylvanus G. Morley's The Inscriptions of Peten in five large volumes. ANTILLES Dr. Irving Rouse of the Peabody Museum of Yale University has supplied the following digest of the results of his last few seasons of work in Puerto Rico. While in Europe in the summer of 1939, he located two important unpublished reports on archaeological work in the Lesser Antilles; one of them describes stratigraphical excavations in Trinidad, the first work of this kind in the Lesser Antilles. Drs. Rainey and Rouse are preparing two publications on their work in Haiti. "Field work on the archaeological survey of Puerto Rico being undertaken by the Peabody Museum of Yale University, in cooperation with the University of Puerto Rico, was completed during 1938. As a result of three consecutive summers of work, two hundred and eighty-one sites in Puerto Rico and the ad- jacent islands of Mona and Vieques have been located, mapped and described. Excavations four meters square have been sunk in forty-four of the more im- portant of these sites. Taken in conjunction with the four sites excavated by the Peabody Museum previous to the inception of the survey, this gives a total of forty-eight stratigraphical cuts, from which it is hoped that a definite chronol- ogy can be established for Puerto Rico. "Preliminary study of the material bears out the assumption underlying previous work, that the culture of Puerto Rico was essentially homogeneous, there being no important local developments of culture in various parts of the island. Most of the observed differences in culture in Puerto Rico seem to have been the result of chronological rather than geographical factors. "The data from the survey corroborate the conclusion suggested by previous work, that there were four principal periods in prehistoric Puerto Rico, one in which pottery is lacking, and each of the others defined in terms of a particular type of pottery. The priority of the first period is assumed on typological grounds; stratigraphic tests in at least ten sites support the sequence of pottery types. As in the case of the excavations which Hatt made for the Danish Na- tional Museum in the Virgin Islands, the earliest Puerto Rican type of pottery is similar to a certain kind in the Lesser Antilles and the latest type resembles the later kind in the remainder of the Greater Antilles. The pottery of the inter- mediate period is more or less transitional between the other two types. "The completion of the survey makes it possible to study population dis- tributions in Puerto Rico. Non-pottery sites, as well as sites containing the earliest type of pottery, have been found only on the coast. Pottery of the in- termediate type is common on the coast, but also occurs in a few of the larger sites in the interior. Pottery of the latest type is distributed throughout the 257</page><page sequence="26">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY island, particularly in a large number of small sites in the interior. It would seem therefore, that the Indian population was confined to the coast during the first two periods, the interior being opened up during the third period. The whole island, apparently, was occupied during the last period. It is hoped that further study of this sort will lead to determination of centers of population in the is- land during each of the four periods. "Little progress has yet been made in correlating the pottery sequence with other aspects of Puerto Rican culture. It is expected, however, that laboratory study of the results of the survey will demonstrate the chronological position of the so-called ball courts, stone collars, three-pointed stones, and petroglyphs, as well as of other cultural elements. At present, it can only be suggested that the elements just listed occurred relatively late in the pottery sequence." Sr. Adolfo de Hostos, Official Historian of Puerto Rico, conducted extensive researches and excavations in 1937 at Caparra in the Bay of San Juan, Puerto Rico, on the site presumed to be that of the Villa of Juan Ponce de Leon, built in 1509. His careful excavations and the study of the artifacts found clearly indi- cated the verification of this hypothesis. Stanley H. Boggs of Harvard University spent some time this (1939) spring excavating on the island of Haiti. First he investigated a site near Limonade Bord de Mer which was suspected to be that of Navidad, the first settlement in the New World, established by Columbus in 1492 and destroyed before his re- turn on his second voyage. The site was excavated with scientific thoroughness. The study of the artifacts encountered is not completed, but no certain evidence of the identity of the site with Navidad was found, and some negative evidence; most of the artifacts were definitely French colonial or later in date. Following this, a large number of rather thin pre-Columbian shell-heaps were investigated, some completely, others tested or trenched. Three groups of from six to twenty mounds were examined in the region of Ft. Liberte and Manzanillo Bay on the north coast. In none of the mounds examined was the cultural deposit in excess of 25 cm. in depth; the great majority of the finds were ceramic. The stratigraphic location of each object was noted and the material is now being studied with probability of publication within a year. From October 1937 to February 1938, Herbert W. Krieger, Curator of Eth- nology of the National Museum, conducted archaeological investigations in the Bahaman Archipelago under a Smithsonian grant. He excavated kitchen mid- dens and burials on Long Island, Inagua, and New Providence Island and un- covered data pointing to a close cultural contact between the Lucayan Indians of the Bahamas and the Arawak of Hispaniola and to the tribal migration of the Lucayans at a comparatively recent date from the island of Hispaniola.
