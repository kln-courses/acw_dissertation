Pp. xvi + 338. (Forschungen zum Alten Testament, 15.) Tubingen: Mohr, 1996. isbn 3 16 146598 9. DM 258. Aniconic religion can take several different forms, as Τ. N. D. Mettinger has shown in his important work, No Graven Image? Israelite Israelite Aniconism in its Ancient Near Eastern Context, Coniectanea Biblica O.T. Series 42 (Stockholm: Almqvist &amp; Wiksell International, 1995). Within Mettinger's framework, the canonical theological stance of the Old Testament is one of 'pro grammatic aniconism': images of the deity are banned as a matter of principle. This is the way that we have been brought up to think of Old Testament religion. The study of the actualities of ancient Israelite religion can prove from epigraphic and iconographic evidence that Israelite religion was never actually as simple as this and that conversely what we have in the Old Testament is a rather sanitized view of religious belief and practice in ancient Israel. Indeed the polemic against illicit religious activity, plain enough within the Hebrew Bible itself, carries with it the inevitable implication that such activity must have been very common, and some illicit religious</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 187 practices (principally those associated with magic) continued into medieval Judaism. But even if we concentrate our attention on the biblical canon, a little reflection on the phrase 'no image of God' soon reveals that it is only valid in the narrow sense of 'no cultic image'. Images of God—anthropomorphic and zoomorphic—are com monplace in the Old Testament and this is more than a play on words, since it is clear that even if the orthodox did not allow statues or pictures of God, they had no hesitation in imagining the deity and speaking of God in highly imaginative terms. Equally we should note that Israel's was not the only deity in the ancient Near East whose cult was aniconic. Mettinger has compiled the evidence, but a single example may suffice: the author of the description of the cult of the Atargatis temple at Hierapolis in the Syrian Goddess tells us that neither the sun nor the moon deities had any image. Podella's book is concerned with this important theme of the image of God in the Old Testament and specifically with the theme of clothing. It begins with a general account of theophany and clothing imagery in the Bible, including such paradigmatic texts as Ps. 93, Ps. 97:2-3 and Ezek. 1:26-8. There is also discus sion of some New Testament passages such as Eph. 6:13-18. Different methodological approaches to the question are discussed in some detail, with considerable attention being given to a com parative method involving other ancient Near Eastern traditions and especially iconography. The essential relation between person and clothing has fundamental consequences: abstract character istics of a deity can be regarded as his clothing, and clothing presupposes corporality. The three main chapters are concerned with 'Das Kleid im religiosen Kontext', 'Gotterkleider und Gottergestalt im Alten Orient' and 'Die Konigsgestalt JHWHs'. The first of these exam ines in great detail the symbolism of clothing (in such expressions as 'grasping the hem of the garment', and in relation to priestly functions). There is a detailed discussion of the Ρ Sinai pericope, and the chapter concludes with a discussion of the theology of clothing (with reference to E. Peterson and K. Barth). The middle chapter, on the ancient Near Eastern gods, constitutes the heart of the book and is a masterpiece of textual and iconographic research (judiciously illustrated), dealing mainly with Egypt and Mesopotamia. The emphasis is on such rituals as the clothing of statues of gods and the relation of this to theophany. Such rituals are at the centre of temple cults and the real presence of the deity in his sanctuary. There is much detail on the technical terminology</page><page sequence="3">188 REVIEWS of divine clothing and the nimbus used to indicate the divine radiance (Akkadian melammu) iconographically. The third chapter concentrates on Yahweh presented as a king. Here a large number of Old Testament passages are the subject of detailed exegesis in the present context (Jer. 10:1-16; Isa. 40:12-26; Deut. 4-5; Isa. 6:1-5; Ps. 93; Ps. 104:1-9 etc.). The 'glory of the Lord' is thus set in the comparative context. The theme of the clothing of God and of clothing in the religious context is one that could be taken up also in later periods of Jewish and Christian tradition. The appearance of God is import ant in the hekalot literature (mentioned at the end of the volume), while Syriac authors, like Ephrem the Syrian, made the notion of the garment of glory put aside kenotically by the Son and lost by Adam and Eve the foundation of their understanding of soteriology. This is a fine book, with a mass of concentrated argument and discussion. An iconographic catalogue and some illustrations, as well as full indexes and bibliography, are appended. John F.
