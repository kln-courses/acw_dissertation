<plain_text><page sequence="1">"An Undiscovered Song": John Clare's "Birds Poems" Sehjae Chun Hanyang University The purpose of this paper is to approach John Clare's "Bird Poems" from an environmentally oriented perspective. Clare's interests in ornithology and its effect on his poems have been largely disparaged and minimized, as if being a reliable naturalist would somehow prevent him from being a satisfactory poet. Undeniably, Clare is under the influence of the sentimental conceptualization of nature, but his unique achievement lies in combining a scientific sense for the natural world with poetic sensibility, which leads to his potent environmental advocacy. Not as a sentimental writer of nature but as an expert naturalist and environmentalist poet, Clare symbiotically succeeds in poetizing birds with a naturalist's eye, by demonstrating the mutually constituent relationship between ornithology and poetry. In fact Clare has not drawn much critical attention from the conventional litany of Romanticism including works such as M. H. Abrams's The Mirror and the Lamp and Natural Supernaturalism, Marilyn Butler's Romantics, Rebels and Reactionaries, and Jerome McGann's The Romantic Ideology, many of which simply ignore or barely mention John Clare.1 Furthermore, Harold Bloom in The Visionary Company, burying him in the ranks of "Beddoes, Darley, and Thomas Hood," makes the degrading comment that Clare's vision is simply in the shadow of "Wordsworth's and Coleridge's" (434). Raymond Williams, John Barrell, and David Simpson, however, attempt to rescue Clare from this obscurity, emphasizing Clare's unique political represen- tation of country life. Raymond Williams, in The Country and the City, makes a distinguishable correlation between "a projection of personal feeling into a sub- jectively particularized and objectively generalized Nature" in William Words- worth and John Clare on the one hand and a "close observation and description ornature" in Gilbert White's work on the other (166).2 John Barrell, in The Idea of Landscape, sees that Clare's sense of place is "to suggest what it is like to be in each place" (166) and comments on the metaphoric representation ornature in the poem "The Lamentations of Round-Oak Waters." Barrell writes that "It is the landscape as itself, where it was, that is being regretted here; and from here onward the poem leaves Clare's melancholy behind, and becomes more like a direct political statement against enclosure" (116). David Simpson, in The Aca- demic Postmodern and the Rule of Literature, on the one hand, views Clare's "microscopic detail and immersion in place" as class-bound rejection of aristo- cratic landscape poetry, but, on the other hand, he disparagingly criticizes _</page><page sequence="2">Clare's particular understanding of the local environment as only the reflection of his nostalgic longing for the past, a mere "hallucinogenic particularity" (158). Therefore, his view is that "Localism and localization in neither case provide any empirical certainties of being and belonging in place, but instead stimulate uncertainties of meaning and disposition" (158). 3 The risk in new historicists attempting to brand Clare's political views lies in losing the complexity of Clare's poems. However, Barrell's valorization of Clare over the Romantics in light of the historicity of representation provides that valuable insight to explore Clare's potential importance to environmental literature. He argues Clare discovers "new form," "expressive of his own idea of landscape, in the poems . . . between about 1822 and the middle of the 1830s" (154). Furthermore, David Simpson in "Is the Academy Ready for John Clare?" also suggests with much reservation that "probably ecocriticism will be Clare's passport to wider recognition" (72) for "Clare can offer, it seems, an opportunity for positive identification, a model for an admired form of being in the world" (75). David Simpson's reserved acceptance of John Clare is in fact also influ- enced and anticipated by the critics who make an effort to read Clare's poems in light of an environmentally oriented perspective. In 1991, James McKusick, in "'A language that is ever green': The Ecological Vision of John Clare," pio- neered ecological readings of John Clare. He traces the origin of the ecological consciousness in Clare's time, by comparing him to William Wordsworth and Gilbert White, and argues that Clare's ecological vision is expressed in his "im- provised ecolect" (240), which McKusick sees as "a powerful and suggestive model for contemporary ecological writing" (245). Similarly, John Holloway deplores the neglect of the dimension of John Clare as a nature poet and reads him as "the leading 'Green Poet' of his own time and ... for our time also" (132), by emphasizing Clare's innovative use of Northamptonshire dialect to relate to the essence of the nature. Further, W. John Coletta in "Ecological Aes- thetics and the Natural History Poetry of John Clare" rereads Clare's poems with modern-day ecologist Eugene Odum's concept of climax community and B. E. McLaren and R. O. Peterson's tropic cascade model to show that Clare's under- standing ornature is ecologically correct in the modern ecological sense. Environmentally oriented critics' valorization of Clare's ecological sense counterbalances the much discredited value of Clare's poetry. However, their emphases mainly lie on the function of language, which privileges the reference over the referred. Interestingly, this is the main point of the eco-critics' critique of New Historicists, whose constructivist tendency of language they try to over- come, while adhering to their faith in the constructivist nature of language. However, this critical tension between new historicists' and some ecocrit- ics' tendency to privilege discourse over the materiality ornature seems to come ^8</page><page sequence="3">from the interdisciplinary approach to nature by Clare himself. As modern day environmental writers, such as Rich Bass and Rachel Carson, successfully apply their professional knowledge on geology and marine biology to their literary works, Clare, as a naturalist, in the Northamptonshire village of Helpston, effec- tively utilizes his local knowledge in his poems by maintaining the balance be- tween science and poetry.4 In other words, Clare's symbiotic understanding of nature, with naturalistic and poetic sensibilities, affects his environmental advo- cacy for the preservation of natural landscapes and wild creatures.5 Undeniably Clare's understanding ornature is influenced by the naturalistic taste of the period, during which many nature lovers wanted to collect speci- mens for their observation. In the case of Clare, his scientific understanding of the natural world enormously influences his poetic understanding of nature. Therefore, Clare might serve as a good example of the nature poet William Hazlitt valorizes. Hazlitt writes: Let the naturalist, if he will, catch the glow-worm, carry it home with him in a box, and find it next morning nothing but a little grey [sic]; let the poet or the lover of poetry visit it at evening, when beneath the scented hawthorn and the crescent moon it has built itself a palace of emerald light. ("On Poetry in General" 13) In fact, Clare is easily fit into the category of an environmentalist from the mod- ern perspective and his advocacy for the preservation of natural landscapes and wild creatures offers an exemplary model for modern environmental activism. His first poetry collection, Poems Descriptive of Rural Life and Scenery, out- spokenly denounces the improvement of the local landscape by which the com- mons, marshes, and wastelands are increasingly vanishing. Furthermore the en- closure movement is critiqued in "The Lament of Swordy Well," "The Village Minstrel," "The Shepherd's Calendar," and "The Rural Muse" for its disruption of the communal ecosystem.6 When his favorite trees were cut down, he la- mented in his letter to Taylor, "a green wou[l]d not be plough[e]d a tree or bush wou[l]d not be cut for firing or furniture &amp; every thing they found when boys would remain in that state till they dyd [sic] - this is my indisposition" (56). 7 Further, these poems are ultimately a statement of political protest of the loss of the landscape. Birds Poems Considering that the scope and originality of Clare's ecological vision emerge from this commitment to his local environment of Northamptonshire, Clare's ecological vision is exemplified in many passages. For Clare, one of the main poetic subjects about his extensive knowledge of the interaction and mu- tual dependence of various species in his local region is animals. 8 Poems like _</page><page sequence="4">"My Rover," "The Marten," "The Fox," "The Badger," "The Bull on the Pas- ture," "The Hedgehog," and "The Lament of Swordy Well," to name a few, ex- emplify his deep interest in the lives of animals. However, these animals have been ignored and devalued by critics and the public. As M. M. Mahood observes, Clare's publisher Taylor excised animals from the poems "whenever he had the chance," reducing "November" in "The Shepard's Calendar," for instance, to half its original length, "by driving out successively its ass, cows, cat, turkey cock, hogs, steer, geese, carthorst, bull" (219). To the publisher, the animals seem not to be the major poetic subjects or at best the backdrop of the poetic self, whose stance echoes what New Histori- cists argue about Clare's animals as the social construction. Many poems, such as "The Badger," "The Marten," "The Fox," and "The Hedgehog," describe animals as victims of humans who harass, torture, hunt, and kill them. For example, in "The Vixen," the foxes are harassed by the hu- man inhabitants of the poem who appear thoughtless and cruel: "The shepherd sees them and the body goes bye / And gets a strick and progs the hole to try" (9-10).9 Undoubtedly, his poems about victimized, vulnerable animals are strongly associated with Clare himself and his class status both represented as marginal figures. Both of them are harassed and wronged by the society and remain on the margins. Here the weakness and helplessness of animals in suffer- ing foster sympathy with Clare as a marginalized victim. Critics such as Johanne Clare, Eric Robinson, Hugh Haughton, and Richard Fitter, highlighting Clare's tendency to identify with animals, agree that animals in Clare's poems are the sympathetic reflection of his sense of self, encompassing his loneliness, timidity and even persecution by society. The danger in the simplistic identification with animals through sympathy lies in the suppression of animals as the mere mirror image of Clare. In fact, Clare's keen interest in animals as others seems to resist the direct mirroring or projection through the sympathetic imagination. What makes Clare's vision of animals distinguishable from others is the ways in which he poetically engages himself with animals. In particular, in his poeticization of birds, he shows another possibility of the sympathetic exchange of feelings, through which he spectator can take the perspective of the birds. But the spectator can have a sense of certain similarity between oneself and others without necessarily identifying with those others. In particular, Clare appropriates his naturalistic understanding in his poems about birds, minimizing sympathetic identification with the victimized animals. He demonstrates his unique accomplishment in combining his poetic sensitivity for natural phenomena with his local knowledge of ornithology, and challenges the view that animals are merely presented in order to show the increasing dominance of man as a positive force in the shaping of the environment. Fur- thermore, his interest in ornithology and its effect on his poems have been</page><page sequence="5">largely ignored, as if being a dependable naturalist would somehow prevent him from being a poet. In fact, ornithology emerged as a discipline in natural history in the 1760s and gained momentum to be one of the major scientific disciplines. Paul Lawrence Färber writes: "Although the increased rigor of the study of birds and the specialization that demarcated ornithology as a separate department of natural history was evident in the first two decades of the nineteenth century, it would be inaccurate to speak of the discipline of ornithology coming into being" (90). 10 To illustrate the symbiotic dimension of birds in Clare's poetry, comparison with Romantic poets' appropriation of birds might be illuminating. Clare's "Birds Poems" challenge the Romantic's privileging of reference over the refer- ent in appropriation of the birds in terms of symbolism, relying on poetic deco- rum of the bird imagery. For instance, valorization of the poet's subjectivity in the poem, mediated by birds, displaces and colonizes animals, as if Keats' "viewless wings of Poesy" in his "Ode to a Nightingale" depend on the tradi- tional referential system in which the nightingale symbolizes ruined love, and Shelley's skylark is seen as a message for spiritual enlightenment. Questioning the use of birds as simply a backdrop for one's emotional projection, Clare writes: "we saw a gentleman &amp; lady listning very attentive by the side of a shrubbery &amp; when we [del, passed] came up we heard them lavishing praises on the beautiful song of the nightingale which happened to be a thrush" (NHPW 37). Here Clare mocks a gentleman and a lady who mistook a thrush for a night- ingale. In fact this type of misrecognition seems to ignore implicitly the neces- sity and the importance to recognize a bird as it is. The identity of the bird does not matter. Rather the spectator or the listener can freely exercise the imagina- tion. Similar to a gentle man and a lady, described above, Romantic poets, mis- taking a thrush for a nightingale, are "indulged in fancys but they did not wish that those matter of fact men the Naturalists should take them for facts upon their credit - What absurditys for a world that is said to get wiser &amp; wiser every day" (NHPW 42). Obviously, his comments reveal the tension between poetic use of birds and naturalistic understanding of the birds. Here what Clare criticizes is the fact the poetic misconception of the birds actually distorts our understanding of birds as they are. Clare's way of birding is very similar to that of modern day birders. In fact, his letters, journals, and field notes collected in NHPW show that his local knowledge of birds' behavior in Northamptonshire is largely dependent on his actual observation, not from the widely popularized books on birds such as Bungay's a Natural History of Birds, John M'Diarmid's Sketches from Nature (1830), and Robert Mudie's The Natural History of Birds (1834), among others. In his "Natural History Letter VI," he writes that "an able Essay on objects in nature that would beautifye descriptive poetry might be entertaining &amp; useful to _</page><page sequence="6">form a right taste in pastoral poems that are full of nothing but the old thread bare epithets of 'sweet singling cuckoo' 'love lorn nightingale' 'fond turtles' 'sparkling brooks' 'green meadows' 'leafy woods' &amp; с &amp; с these make up the creation of Pastoral &amp; descriptive poesy &amp; every thing else is reckond low &amp; vulgar" (NHPW 51). Here Clare problematizes the representation ornature in "Pastoral &amp; descriptive poesy," which, to him, are full of conventional descrip- tion of nature. To Clare, who knows nature from a naturalist's perspective, the natural description even in poetry is in fact the falsification ornature itself. Clare seems to emphasize the fact that the true love ornature cannot be felt in this type of poetry. Rather this type of poetry blocks the appreciation of nature by disso- ciating the reader from the physical nature. In his "Birds Poems," he debunks the myth of the nightingale by observing that bird: "Hath made me marvel that so famed a bird / Should have no better dress than russet brown / Her wings would tremble in her extacy" ("The Night- ingale's Nest" 20-2). Similarly, Shelley's skylark in "To the Skylark," thought to be in ecstasy, flies high above, moving up and down, as with Clare's skylark. However, Clare informs the reader that the hectic movement of the skylark is caused by the nest ravaging school boys who surprise her from "her half-formed nest" ("The Sky Lark" 13). Here Clare targets to rectify the misconception of birds behavior in poetry. In describing the cause of the skylark's movements, he deeply understands the natural behavior of the birds. As Eric Robinson and Richard Fitter argue, Clare is "in the double opera- tion of re-creating what he experienced in the past by focusing more directly upon what he experiences in the present" {John Clare's Birds IX). His freedom from the poetic decorum, which alienates the birds from their own essence, is gained from his ornithological approach to nature. Observation When Clare was young, he "lov[e]d to employ leisure when a boy in wan- dering about the fields watching the habits of birds to see the woodpecker s[w]eeing away in its ups and downs and the jay bird chattering by the wood side" (JCBH Ъ1).и Не roamed around Helpston not to hunt the birds but to "sit to watch" them ("The Autumn Robin" 6). As James Fisher notes, Clare is so well- versed in birding that he recognizes "from personal observation about 145 wild birds, of which 119 can be identified with reasonable certainty as country records- 65 of them 'first records'" (JCB XII). His field note style observation of the birds is very similar to the modern day ornithologist. For example, he observes the deft manner of the thrush feed- ing on snails by "taking them to a stone where they break them in a very dexter- ous manner" (NHPW 76). 12 To observe this kind of scene requires different ~52</page><page sequence="7">approaches to the scene from those of Sir John Denham, Alexander Pope, and James Thomson, who adopt the wide range prospective perspective in landscape poetry.13 In fact just as a spectator of landscape tends to secure the objectivity by observing the landscape from a vantage point removed from the scene, the poet about landscape wants to achieve aesthetic distance from the subject. Similarly, in his "Natural History Letter XI," Clare observes the bird's soli- tude in terms of privacy: "They [nightingales] are very jealous of intrusions on their privacy when they have young &amp; if one goes in their haunts at that time they may a great chirping &amp; buring &amp; will almost perch close to you noising &amp; chirping as if to fright you away at first" (NHPW 67-68). 14 In fact, Clare is ex- tremely cautious of his possible threat to the privacy of birds and tries not to disturb them. Rather, the focus of his attention lies in the autonomy and peace the birds are maintaining in their nests. Away from the immediate danger and intrusion mainly made by humans, birds maintain their own privacy. Clare's respect for the privacy of birds explains his cautious approach to birds' nests and shows the autonomy of birds. When he observes birds, he maintains the earth-level of non-intrusive ob- servation enough to capture the "trembling grass" ("To the Snipe" 5) and meets the eyes of the birds as well. Moreover, unlike Audubon, who captures and stuffs birds for classification right after he observes them, Clare leaves the scene without attempting to capture them. Here his observation style is symbolic and crucial for his writing in that his field observation replaces hunting or different types of recreational sports as an exercise of the imagination within the physical environment, which leads to ecological thinking about the natural world.15 Further Clare shows his consistent interest in translating the careful obser- vation of individual birds in their habitats into the substance of poetry, but Clare here resists the urge to transform his observation into metaphor, and instead struggles simply to come to grips with what it is that he actually sees. Juxtaposition between a Naturalist and a Poet As a naturalist, Clare is good at identifying and categorizing what he ob- serves with the series and structure of conventional natural history, as are most of his contemporary naturalists, such as Gilbert White.16 For instance, a juxtapo- sition of Clare's description of the woodlark with that produced by Gilbert White, one of the most famous naturalists in the eighteenth century, shows the strength and accuracy of Clare's observation. In Natural History of Selborne, White observes the woodlark's motion, which is described as "suspended in mid air" (104) and notes that "In January, and continues to sing through all the sum- mer and autumn" (105). Studying its flying movement, White notes "most small birds hop; but wagtails and larks walk, moving their legs alternately. Skylarks 53</page><page sequence="8">rise and fall perpendicularly as they sing; woodlarks hang poised in the air; and titlarks rise and fall in large curves, singing in their descent" (201). Similarly Clare, observing a woodlark with an ornithologist's eyes, records: "it has an odd way of singing as it flyes from tree to tree dropping down a little way &amp; then rising up with a jerk &amp; when the[y] fly up they are silent singly everfy] time the[y] drop trembling their wings till they jerk up agen &amp; when they are weary they either stuntly drop on the ground or settle on a tree where their song ceases" (NHPW 139). Further Clare's observation in his natural writ- ing seems to be more detailed and accurate and connects the woodlark' s singing pattern with its movement. Although he attempts to minimize the personal sen- timent in his observation, he also uses some type of anthropomorphic language. For example, when he sees a woodlark drop on the ground, he interprets that a woodlark may be "weary" from flying. However interestingly in "The Wood- larks Nest," the above naturalistic observation is interpreted into poetry quite literally: The woodlark rises from the coppice tree Time after time untired she upward springs Silent while up then coming down she sings A pleasant song of varied melody Repeated often till some sudden check. (1-5) Here a woodlark's movement is translated into a poem rather directly. He is not deluding himself or projecting his own emotions upon a woodlark. Here "a pleasant song of varied melody" does not show the mental status of a woodlark as in anthropocentric anthropomorphism. But it reveals the fact that the pleasure is felt to Clare, not the woodlark. In the second stanza, he is amazed by its nest- ing place: How birds could be So wise to find such hidden homes again And this in sooth oft puzzled me - thy go Far off and then return - but natures plain She giveth what sufflceth them to know That they of comfort may their share retain. (23-28) The observation of a woodlark's dwelling in such an unlikely place leads him to be aware of the sufficiency and autonomy of the ecosystem. At the same time, he recognizes the bird's sentience and even intelligence. From his observation, Clare cannot simply project his own imagination onto birds to flatter his own imagination. Neither simply a naturalist nor a poet, he is more concerned with balancing and synthesizing both visions. Not isolating its own behavior, he looks at the situation holistically. The ba- sis of such sensitivity in observation is in fact his knowledge of ornithology. Those who have a naturalistic understanding of birds can use their ornithological 54</page><page sequence="9">knowledge to draw holistic vision and aesthetic satisfaction from actual observa- tion. The local knowledge of birds in particular reciprocally reinforces and struc- tures the experience. The birds observed here poetically and prosaically are aes- thetically satisfying, less for what is literally observed than for what is known or schematically imagined of the Northampton ecology. Gravitation of the Poetry Clare, however, is not a professionally schooled naturalist or ornithologist. He knows that "I am not wonderfully deep in s[c]i[e]nce or ... nor so wonder- fully ignorant as many may have fancied from reading the accounts which my friends gave of me" {JCBH 59) and his publisher, Hessey, discourages Clare from "venture[ing] in Prose [you] may get into hands that will not be very care- ful of your Name, &amp; you may injure your Poetical Name by a Prose attempt" {NHPW XXXVIII).17 In autumn 1824, he found that in Walton's Complete An- gler, "the descriptions are nature unsullied by fashionable tastes of time they are simply true and like the Pastoral Ballads of Bloomfield breath of the common air &amp; the grass &amp; the sky" {NHPW 174). The following week he again notes in his Journal, that he "continued reading Chatterton in search for extracts to insert in my natural history" {NHPW 177). In a similar impulse, he records, "if I had the means to consult &amp; the health to indulge I should crowd these letters on Natural History with luscious scraps of Poesy from my favorite Minstrels &amp; make them [deleted] less barren of amusement &amp; more profitable of perusal" {NHPW4Ì). Here Clare seems to follow Hessey's advice to focus on poetry. But Clare is clearly aware of the necessity of the symbiotic and interdisciplinary, in modern day terms, approaches to the natural world. He writes: "to look at nature with a poetic feeling magnifies the pleasure yet Naturalists and Botanists seem to have little or no taste for this sort of feeling they merely make a collection of dryd specimens classing them after Lienneus into tribes and familys as a sort of curi- osity and fame. ... yet I have no desire further to dry the plant or torture the Butterflye by sticking it on a cork board with a pin I have no wish to do this if my feelings would let me" {JCBH 62; my italics). The significant confluence of Clare's naturalist and poetic impulses focuses on an ecological understanding of the relation of one species to its surroundings. Here he condemns the current practice of the naturalists for their lack of "poetic feeling." In the above context, this poetic feeling overlaps with the ecological non-intrusive understanding of nature. As opposed to the cut and dry practice of collecting specimens, Clare's "poetic" dealing with a butterfly aims at observing it without killing. Here, the natural world is translated by the reciprocity between scientific and poetic lan- guage to articulate his experience. Clare's poems do not transcend or ignore the 55</page><page sequence="10">actuality of the materiality of the earth, and bring the readers to the natural world and to its dwellings. Therefore, his poems are the ecological expression of his poetic engagement with the natural world. He envisions that "wilderness" is the imaginary meeting place with the pre- vious poets where "the bards and prophets of old days / Met in the wilderness to glad their praise / And in these summer walks I seem to feel" ("The Moorehens Nest" 57-59). To Clare, the spirit of the poets dwells in the bosom ornature and the wilderness. His poetic voice seems to be morally obligated to utter the voice ornature, not colored by the poet's own image or scientific factual observation. Rather, it is the sound of symbiotic engagement. Therefore, listening to the sound of the nightingale, he imitates its sound as if a "spell struck the wondering boy / Listens again - again the sound he hears / And mocks it in his song for very joy" ("The March Nightingale" 12-4). Simi- larly, in the comparison of his poem with the song of the robin, he deplores that the song of the robin is eclipsed by "cold public praise" and humbly confesses that "could my notes steal aught from thine / My words but imitate thy lay" ("The Autumn Robin" 98, 1 13-14). In this effort, his diction attempts to capture the immediacy of his experi- ence with the birds. However, it is questionable how ornithological taxonomy might enhance his ecological understanding of the animals. In fact, Clare is nei- ther bound by the scientific taxonomie terminology nor by the traditional poetic dictum. This problem leads him to contrive his unique language which is strongly rooted in the local diction. Similar to the Wordsworthian language "of men speaking to men," his insistence on the local diction is consistent with his preference for the local terms to the Linnaean diction for generating names for birds and plants. His unique use of grammar, spelling, punctuation, and other aspects of lan- guage demonstrates his deliberate effort to free the human-centered imagination to embrace a merged subjectivity which goes beyond the alienated relationship between the spectator and the spectacle. As Onno Oerlemans suggests, what they reveal is "a kind of shared or overlapping subjectivity of the observer and the observed" (142). 18 With vivid and characteristic terms, for example, he devises many ono- matopoetic words in describing a bird's song, which might be easily accepted by the locals. Nightingales are making sounds of "jug, jug jug" (9) in "The Sweet Nightingale"; a firetale, "tweet tut" (14) in "The Firetails Nest"; a pewit, "chewsit as she flyes" (9) in "Birds in Alarm." Here Clare's subjectivity is in- termingled with that of birds through the language he employs. 56</page><page sequence="11">Animal Cruelty Clare's poetic identity, symbiotically invented in his poetic diction, is in fact closely related to his conceptualization of animal others. What triggers him to be aware of animals as autonomous subjects is the issue of animal cruelty. Clare struggles with the question of animal cruelty and where to draw the line. Obviously, he joins the gypsies in catching wild animals and seems to enjoy hunting. On May 13th, 1825, when he encountered a vixen with her four cubs, who "instantly approachd towards me growling like an angry dog," he playfully "tryd all I coud to fright her by imitating the bark of a fox hound which only irritated her the more and if I had not retreated a few paces back she woud have seized me . . . when I set up an haloo she started" (JCBH 227). Earlier in his career, Clare accepted fox-hunting and badger-baiting as part of rural life, nei- ther totally condemning nor approving of these pursuits. Certainly, those cruel- ties to animals are culturally accepted by rural folks and the urban poor as a part of ordinary life or a means of redirecting their social anger to blood sports. Fur- thermore, in many early poems, as in "In Summer Evening," he shows a lacka- daisical opposition to killing wild animals. In fact, Clare is not only the rural victim, but he also participates inadvertently in the degradation of nature like many rural laborers in the early decades of the nineteenth century. Interestingly, in "Birds Poems," he maintains an unswerving opposition to animal cruelty, based on his profound understanding of animal sentience. In fact, his "Birds Poems" are not a sentimental condemnation of animal cruelty. Rather, they poetically reveal animal subjectivity, sentience, and their symbiotic way of living. . A Sign of Animal Subjectivity With the detailed and situated local knowledge and description of birds, Clare views them as sentient beings that possess rights and can feel. Poems like "To the Snipe," "The Moorehens Nest," "The Wrynecks Nest," "The Robins Nest," and "The Nightingale's Nest" detail how these birds, as sentient beings, are able to experience emotions. In particular, "The Wrynecks Nest" registers the sense of terror which a wryneck in danger feels: The sitting bird looks up with jetty eye And waves her head in terror too and fro Speckled and veined in various shades of brown And then a hissing noise assails the clown And quick with hasty terror in his breast From the trees knotty trunk he sluthers down And thinks the strange bird guards a serpents nest. (8-14) 57</page><page sequence="12">Clare observes the intelligence and emotions of fear and bravery in the hissing sounds it makes to protect its nest from peeping people. Here it is important to note that the fear and the bravery, the words used for humans, are not simply the results of the projection of anthropomorphic imagination. The wryneck's situa- tion evinces that it feels the danger from humans, and the wryneck's hissing sounds drive humans away. It is possible to speculate that the wryneck's hissing technique is the result of the evolutionary and ecological necessity. However, the most important bird feeling Clare highlights is their sense of fear around humans. In Clare's observation, the major threat to the birds is not from nature, but from "Boys" and "the very breath of man" "With searching dogs and gun" ("To the Snipe"), and humans are "the only object that distrains / Earths garden into deserts for his gains." ("The Moorehens Nest" 35-36). For that reason, the snipe attempts to avoid the area "where fear encamps / Around thy home alone" ("To the Snipe" 3-4). The ways in which Clare reads birds might implicitly aim at critiquing hu- mans' way of living in the natural world. Clare writes that robins "find them like old tenants peaceful still" ("The Robins Nest" 67). This idea of birds as tenants, not masters or owners of the forest, symptomatically signifies Clare's deliberate attempt to go beyond anthropocentrism. He understands that the natural world is not something humans should manipulate or exploit but rather something they should just borrow temporarily, without disturbing or intervening in the stabi- lized natural ecosystem. The bird's strong sense and will to survive in the face of the incessant threat of humans is accessed through his symbiotic observation. Unlike the intervening humans, the birds position themselves in the context of the whole ecological community, which is organized as an intricate corporate society where plants and animals occupy "niche," the ecological role or fonction of the species, by relating the place of their nests to the surrounding habitat. The bird's "niche" is said to have its own distinctive role within both biological clas- sifications and environments, in which case the placement is envisaged as being not only conceptual but also material. Just as the birds in naturalistic observation are located in a specific space in the environment, the birds in Clare's poetic discourse embody his poetic engagement with them. From a model of coopera- tion drawn from the ecosystemic "community," the birds have value only in their proper nests among all the species that surround and nourish each other. Another example of this symbiotic relationship in light of community is found in his observation of a raven's nest. The oak tree provides a safe haven for the raven, which is threatened by humans. Clare notes: "account of a tame one builds on large trees whose bodys are destitute of branches and difficult to climb it is a large nest built in the collar of the tree which tre they keep as there annual home for many years its eggs are olive green blotchd with bluish grey and liver colored spots do great damage to sheep in the fens" (qtd. in JCB 9). 58</page><page sequence="13">This symbiotic relationship between the ravens and the "huge old oak" is symptomatic of his ecological understanding of nests and birds. Even though the oak tree is not healthy enough to have a lot of branches, the dearth of branches prevents humans from climbing it to ravage the raven's nest. But it is not clear how Clare gains close enough access to the nest to describe the detailed charac- teristics of the raven's eggs. Nevertheless, his perspective on the symbiotic rela- tionship between oaks and the ravens focuses on the relationship between ra- vens, oaks and the sheep. From this perspective, he notes the influence of ravens on the local sheep as well. Furthermore, the oak tree and the raven's nest, as ecological indicators, be- come symbolic figures that maintain and strengthen the sense of place for the villagers. "Old men" jokingly advise how to climb the oak tree to boys who at- tempt to steal the raven's nest, but the old men are also amused to see that "the very bird that owned the dwelling then" ("The Ravens Nest" 16) reminds him of past memories which are associated with his childhood: the two ancient birds at their old task Repairing the huge nest - where still they live Through changes winds and storms and are secure And like a landmark in the chronicles Of village memory s treasured up yet lives The hugh old oak that wears the ravens nest. ("The Ravens Nest" 43-8) Unlike the boy Wordsworth who climbs trees for egg stealing (1805 Prelude Book First 333-50), Clare sees the tree as a material presence which has formed a sense of place, by which the past, the present, and the future unite together in the memories of those who remember this tree. The villagers' memories and experience with the ravens bring an aesthetic satisfaction only to those who share them, and this forms a sense of community by keeping memories alive and being aware of the tree's past meaning and pre- sent significance. Therefore, the awareness of the human's position in the con- text of the whole ecological community changes the role of humans from con- queror of the natural world to member and citizen with respect for every single member of the community. Further, in "The Moorehens Nest," the oak tree be- comes a shelter for the various animals who are seemingly natural enemies of one another, such as a badger, a fox, and a hen. Therefore, nature's guardianship emphasized in his many bird poems implies his respect for it as a self-governing realm. Along with the sense of community, Clare's poems illustrate an aestheti- cized healing principle in nature. His song ornature, engaged in Clare's poetry, cures the wounded heart by "Thy songs thy little joys repeat / My loneliness relieves" ("The Autumn Robin" 7-8) and loads the heart with warmth and joy by "renewing] my heart to feeling as the rain / Falls on the earth and bids it thrive 59</page><page sequence="14">again" ("The Moorehens Nest" 27-8). This perception of joy, pleasure, solace and its moral effect in "Sand Martin," "The Yellow Wagtails Nest," "The Rob- ins Nest," and "To the Snipe" are different from what the scientist might feel by classifying and categorizing the birds. Likewise the "picturesque" scenes he celebrates in "The Moorehens Nest" and "The Yellow Wagtails Nest" are simi- lar to what William Cowper uses for the natural effects, different from the artifi- cial picturesque landscaping of Gilpin and his successors. Role of the Nest Clare's poetic engagement with birds seems to mimic the process by which birds build their nests. The bird's nest is conceivably made of natural elements. A nest made of leaves, pinks, linnets, hedge, grass, and moss in "Birds Nests" and built "in years remote" in "The Wrynecks Nest," is "suited" to the environ- ment as in "To the snipe." The natural elements in the very detailed description of the structure of the nest in "The Yellowhammers Nest" symbiotically work to fit with nature enough to protect its nest from any kind of dangers to its autonomy. In his natu- ral history writing, Clare observes that the yellowhammer: "builds its nest on the ground &amp; in low bushes of dead grass &amp; twitch &amp; lines it with horse hair lays five eggs of a fleshy ash color streaked all over with black crooked lines as if done with a pen &amp; for this ... it is often called the 'writing lark'" {NHPW 135- 36). Here a yellowhammer builds its nest, hidden from human intrusion, by camouflaging it in the bushes. The camouflaging technique is itself the survival skill, which is also translated into that of being in the world. Adapting itself to the environment, a yellowhammer builds its nest accordingly and lays eggs which look like the stones or pebbles with "black crooked lines," commonly found near its nest. To Clare, the yellowhammer' s being in the world is similar to a poet's. A yellowhammer lays: - Five eggs pen-scribbled over lilac shells Resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads As natures poesy and pastoral spells They are the yellow hammers and she dwells A poet-like. (13-17) Both a yellowhammer and a poet, indistinguishable from the environment but each fulfilling its niche, are poetically engaged in nature, as if they were a poetic embodiment ornature. __</page><page sequence="15">Conclusion Clare works to find poetic value in the object being represented, and strives to deflect value away from the self, an aesthetic pattern that is based on anthro- pocentric representation. Further, Clare's "Birds Poems" thematize the revela- tion of what nature holds in it. Clare writes that poetry's role is to capture "which nature tries / To keep alive for poesy to prize / Upon whose mossy roots my leisure sits" ("The Moorehens Nest" 39-41). Clare's poems reveal the es- sence of the birds which is not yet, not realized in our common observation. To discover the hidden bird's nest and to be surprised at its mystery are the proc- esses of revealing the "undiscovered song" of nature. Through his symbiotic view of poetic and naturalistic impulse, he attempts: To find her nest and see her feed her young And vainly did I many hours employ All seemed as hidden as a thought unborn And where these crimping fern leaves ramp among The hazels under boughs. ("The Nightingale's Nest" 14-18) Expanding from a particularized perception of specific species to a poetically holistic envisioning of the natural world, Clare's poems maintain the symbiotic intensity of the natural world with a poetic strength. Clare symbiotically suc- ceeds in poeticizing birds with a naturalist's eye by demonstrating the recipro- cally constituent relationship between ornithology and poetry. As Lawrence Buell, in The Environmental Imagination, holds, "Literature functions as sci- ence's less systematic but more versatile complement" through "imagination's free play," which is "regulated by encounters with the environment both per- sonal and mediated through the unofficial folk wisdom to which one has been exposed" (94). A symbiotic understanding of ornithology and poetics leads Clare to his ethical attitude toward animals. Discovering value in an enlarged sense of com- munity and humans' duties toward it, Clare's symbiotic approach leads from poetic and naturalistic observation of the birds to the ethical questions raised by humans' dwellings. The essential feature of human existence is to find a place, as a bird finds a niche. To dwell is to make room for others by recognizing that we become who we are as humans in response to a complex community beyond human existence and comprehension. Becoming aware of the ecosystem and its interconnectedness and fostering deep respect for the natural world in poetry is not just a complex linguistic per- formance pointing at ecological facts. New Historicists' suppression of the ref- erent, in turn, makes no sense, once the existence of a materiality of nature dis- appears. As Kate Soper argues, "it is not language that has a hole in its ozone 61</page><page sequence="16">layer" (151). Therefore, just as Bate calls "ecopoetry" "not a description of dwelling with the earth, not a disengaged thinking about it, but an experiencing it" (The Song of the Earth 42), Clare's symbiotic engagement with birds actually becomes the basis for an environmental ethic of dwelling and a sustainable read- ing of non-humans as well.

Alan Liu also makes similar but more complicated comments on cultural criticism's detailism by identifying the contact between Romanticism and Post- modernism. See Liu, Alan.

Modern efforts to bring science into literary criticism are exemplified in the works of the paleontologist Niles Eldredge, the microbiologist Lynn Mar- gulis, and the biologist Steven Rose, whose works emphasize non-dualistic, and potentially more salubrious arguments. 5Here the symbiotic relationship in a narrow sense represents the mutually beneficial relationships between different types of species, where usually neither organism can live without the other, though in some cases one or the other of the partners may also be able to lead an independent existence. 6Clare's response to enclosure is more fully discussed by John Barrell.

The rising interest in ornithology seems to be transcontinental. In North America, Alexander Wilson's American Ornithology (1808-1814) and John James Audubon's The Birds of America (1826-1838) were published in the early nineteenth century, although it is doubtful whether Clare read them. "John Clare by Himself '996. Hereafter it is indicated as JCBH unless oth- erwise indicated. This passage originally appeared in Pet. MS A49. P.74. The same is ap- plied to a blackbird as well. A black bird "dexterously breaks them [snail's shell] agen a stone or any hard substance that it can find the readies the black- bird has" (NHPW 133). "Thomson's Seasons and Miltons Paradise Lost . . . are the only books of Poetry that I have regularly read" {JCBH 56).

Raymond Williams contrasts the de- tailed study of nature by Gilbert White of Selbourne with the "self-involved" appreciation of nature to be found in Clare. See his The Country and City pp. 133-34. In a similar tone, Eric Robinson in "John Clare's Learning" argues that "The truth is that Clare often sounds just as 'detailed' as White and that White could be as 'self-involved' or 'poetic' as Clare and both acquired their knowl- edge and their love of nature through a long and regular discipline of observa- tion" (15). 17Regarding the failure and incompetence of Clare as a naturalist, see Ray- ment, Nigel. "The failure of John Clare's 'Natural History of Helpstone,'" Criti- cal Survey. 1 (1990): 36-41. McKusick in '"A language that is ever green'" notes that "Clare's ecolect - his development of an alternative 'language that is ever green' to ex- press his ecological vision - offers an increasingly influential model for the cur- rent generation of ecological writers" (245).
