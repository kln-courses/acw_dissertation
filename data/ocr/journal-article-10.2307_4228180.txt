<plain_text><page sequence="1">J JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC ISSUES Vol. XXXIX No. 3 September 2005 Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony Graham Cassano Thorstein Veblen was, perhaps, the first theorist of the "post-modern era." By saying that, I do not mean to impose our belated historical categories upon his work; the hazards of such an abstract historicism are well known. But Veblen himself used the phrase "post-modem era" as early as 1918 to describe the Occident at the dawn of the twentieth century.1 Clearly, Veblen did not mean what jean-Francois Lyotard or Fredric Jameson meant by that same phrase. Nonetheless, the historical accident of this particular "per- spective by incongruity" proves revealing. As the intellectual historian John Patrick Diggins has noted, while Veblen cannot accurately be described as a poststructuralist (after all, during Veblen's lifetime, structuralism itself was only coming into being in the works of Emile Durkheim, Marcel Mauss, and Ferdinand de Saussure [19591), his work seems premised upon an uncanny prefiguration of many poststructuralist themes. "As if he were a proto-poststructuralist, he sought to deconstruct the conventional hierarchical oppositions that privilege the former term over the latter: male-female, civilization-barba- rism, leisure-labor, reason-instinct, practicality-curiosity, normal-abnormal" (Diggins 1999, xxxiii). While not reducing Veblen to suit the categories of contemporary thought, this essay attempts to take seriously Veblen's prefiguration of the poststructuralist atti- tude through a critical consideration of the constitutive power of his literary style. The guiding concept of these investigations is that "style" need not be considered a mere addendum to content-that the style and content of a work are coextensive and mutually determinate (Goodman 1978, 23-40). From this broad perspective, style is not considered simply as a technique but as a constituent element in the "intention" of the work. That is to say, style impacts upon meaning. Georg Lukacs put it this way:2 The author is a member of the Department of Sociology at Southem Connecticut State University and sits on the Steering Committee of the Union For Radical Political Economics (URPE). A shortened version of this essay was read at the 2003 URPE summer conference in a workshop titled "Literature as Political Economy: Political Economy as Literature" that he gave with Germai Medhanie. He would like to thank Germai, James Berger, and Brian Schuth for their helpful comments on earlier versions of this work. 741 (? 2005, Journal of Economic Issues</page><page sequence="2">742 Graham Cassano It is the view of the world, the ideology or weltanschauung underlying a writer's work, that counts. And it is the writer's attempt to reproduce this view of the world which constitutes his "intention"3 and is the formative principle underly- ing the style of a given piece of writing. Looked at in this way, style ceases to be a formalistic category. Rather, it is rooted in content; it is the specific form of a specific content. (1963, 19) Because style is "rooted in content," style and content can never be completely disentan- gled; it is senseless to speak of a text's content analytically drained of style. And, since Veblen's dominant stylistic trope is irony, this essay examines the effect of an ironic style upon scientific discourse, as well as upon Veblen's very (ironic) conception of science itself.4 If Veblen "wrote by indirection, in a style designed to disguise his own thoughts" (Diggins 1999, xvii), as I think he did, then a revised understanding of Veblen's work may be accessible through a careful examination of his style. Perhaps we might unmask the thoughts that he hoped to disguise. Of course, this method makes sense only if it proves fruitful. And, I think, it does.5 At this point I need to clarify a methodological issue. I intentionally read Veblen against the grain of conventional interpretations. By doing so, I do not mean to dis- count or supplant previous understandings of his work; rather, I believe this sort of criti- cal rereading opens his text to new possibilities. Without a doubt, the "center of gravity" for Veblen's work lies in his critique of capitalism and his insistence upon the "matter of fact" point of view promulgated by modern science, technology, and industry. Conse- quently, I take for granted the so-called "Veblenian dichotomy":6 the distinction that Veblen made between instinct of workmanship and the more predatory drives that lead to private ownership. Capitalism, the "price-system," the rule of the market, and supply and demand are ultimately incompatible with the smooth and efficient operation of industry and science as autonomous social and technological forms7 and thus ultimately incompatible with the common good conceived in utilitarian terms. At the same time, I am attempting to peel back layers of ossified meaning that conceal what I take to be another, equally important, critique within his work: the critique of the machine age itself, apart from the deformations of technology and science produced by the capitalist mode of production and exchange. In short, while Veblen accepted the necessity of modern science and found a kind of dialectical hope in the possibility of the disentanglement of technology and industry from capital, he did not stop at that point but continued into an only partially concealed critique of the machine age. Although I think this reading stands up to the evidence pro- vided by the text, it remains an interpretation and, as such, only one of many possible versions of Veblen's argument. Yet, this interpretation has a purpose. By uncovering an often obscured element of Veblen's discourse, I hope to indicate a line of thought that we as cultural critics and social scientists may pursue: a question concerning technology that has important implications for our understanding of social change and its direction.</page><page sequence="3">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 743 The interpretive mode that animates the present essay opens the way to a new understanding of Veblen's theory of the machine age and his reliance upon so-called "objective" scientific methods. The argument I make in the following pages is that we cannot take for granted Veblen's ostensible zeal for modernity's scientific machines, that beneath Veblen's resignation in the face of modern industrialization lay a deep dis- trust of modernity itself, and that this distrust of modernity has important implications for his theoretical arguments. In particular, a careful examination of Veblen's style, and its ironic foundations, leads to a revaluation of his seemingly clear-cut notion of science. Veblen's stylistic irony conceals a deep discourse that calls into question (but does not necessarily reject) the very project of modernity, industry, and even enlightenment itself.8 Irony and Sabotage I am hardly the first reader to recognize the ironic structures in Veblen's writings. From the beginning, commentators have underscored this aspect of his style. Let me offer one passage as a representative of this understanding. In The Engineers and the Price System Veblen sets forth the industrial and eco- nomic situation out of which an association and group consciousness of techni- cians, presumably recruited from the middle class, might arise.... The modern technological system is indispensable to modern populations, and only the engineers can run it.... They are essential for any successful line of revolution- ary action. But Veblen does not detail the means by which an association of engineers might come about. He does not examine the political and class pur- view. On this crucial point he is ambiguous by irony, and behind this guise he states that, although they are indispensable to any overthrow, the technicians will not engage in such a line of action. (Mills and Gerth 1942, 56) C. Wright Mills and Hans Gerth discovered in Veblen what so many other commenta- tors have found so difficult: his resolute and uncompromising stylistic irony, introduced at essential moments within his argument. It is this problem, the problem of irony-which is, at the same time, and essentially, a problem concerning style-that forms the basis of the questions the following pages hope to answer. And the answers to those questions seem to suggest that the ideas Veblen developed in the course of his scientific research demand an ironic presentation, that irony is not incidental to his writings but essential, and that style itself, as disruptive irony, becomes, and must become, a formative principle in his representation of the real. For Veblen, irony represented legitimate stylis- tic sabotage.9 Veblen began his linguistic analysis of "sabotage" by distinguishing the crass use of the term to describe "forcible obstruction, destructive tactics, industrial frightfulness, incendiarism and high explosives" from its more appropriate use as the "conscientious</page><page sequence="4">744 Graham Cassano withdrawal of efficiency" ([19211 1990b, 38). It is this latter use that Veblen developed in the course of his discussion. Rather than applying the term exclusively to the tactics of anarchists, socialists, and trade unionists, Veblen claimed that sabotage is and always has been an intrinsic part of business strategy. The word first came into use among the organized French workmen, the mem- bers of certain syndicats, to describe their tactics of passive resistance.... But the tactics of these syndicalists, and their use of sabotage, do not differ ... from the similar tactics of friction, obstruction, and delay habitually employed . .. by both employees and employers to enforce an argument about wages and prices. ... Such maneuvers of restriction, delay, and hindrance have a large share in the ordinary conduct of business. (39) Notice, Veblen not only applied the term "sabotage" to strategies of the business interests as well as to the strategies of organized workers; more intriguingly, he identified sabotage as a method used to "enforce an argument about wages and prices." Sabotage, the consci- entious withdrawal of efficiency, becomes a method of argument, a rhetorical device. Now I would like to suggest that at the same time Veblen made an important point about the role of sabotage in political economy, he was offering an ironic allegory of his own method, style, and purpose. Veblen used language as a hammer tossed into the gears of capitalism's machinery. His rhetoric disrupted the smooth and placid surface of the busi- ness enterprise by delving into the depths of the mechanism and examining the manner in which it destroys the very community that it purports to serve.10 Technology and the Sociology of Knowledge Veblen built his theoretical edifice on a sociological foundation. Like Karl Marx before him, he rejected Robinson Crusoe's self-reliant and solipsistic universe in favor of the idea that the human subject is always a social subject engaged in communal action. The isolated rational actor is not the beginning of the social world; rather, in Veblen's words, "the individual is a product of group life" ([1914] 1990a, 138). Without social forms, there can be no economic subject. Moreover, the economic and social cos- mos provides the isolated individual with the requisite tools for survival. These histori- cally developed material necessities form the basis for the so-called "state of industrial arts" within the community. "The scheme of technological insight and proficiency cur- rent in any given culture is manifestly a product of group life and is held as a common stock, and as manifestly the individual workman is helpless without access to it." Eco- nomic life does not begin with an individual's personal accumulation of wealth but with the social subject's share in and access to a communal wealth.11 In a real and serious sense, it would be wrong to say that the individual actor "possesses" this "scheme of tech- nological insight and proficiency." The scheme, as a pre-existing social order, educates, selects, and, in fact, possesses the individual. Of course, the individual is a productive fac-</page><page sequence="5">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 745 tor in social life, but only after being produced by society. The self becomes through a process of productive re-production. When Veblen wrote that the "individual is a product of group life," he meant these words to be taken in the strongest possible sense. In order to understand the full import of his claim, I need to turn to his notion of consciousness as an emergent phenomenon. For Veblen the self is not merely the psychological product of a given institutional scheme; more importantly, the individual's very relation to the world of external fact depends upon the mediation of these pregiven social forms. Social forms habituate the mind to a certain perceptual scheme, and this scheme, in turns, selects and determines what is to count as a material "fact." In "The Instability of Knowledge and Belief," an essay that seems to follow directly from C. S. Peirce's piece "The Fixation of Belief," Veblen presented an abbreviated version of his sociology of knowledge. He wrote, "History teaches that men, taken collec- tively, learn by habituation rather than by precept and reflection; particularly as touches those underlying principles of truth and validity on which the effectual scheme of law and custom finally rests" ([1919] 1964, 15). Taking this passage by itself, I do not sup- pose it seems particularly radical or unsettling. Yet within a single sentence the author cuts into the heart of the modern mind's self-satisfaction. Veblen, logician and scientist, rejected the notion most dear to logic and science: that the human mind progresses through careful "reflection" to an ever more certain understanding of the physical uni- verse. No, says Veblen, it is not the mind's careful analysis of "fact" that determines what comes to be called "reality"; rather, habitual human attitudes sanctified in institutional forms produce the perception of reality. Already, in an earlier work, Veblen had offered a radical challenge to the very notion of an unmediated external reality, and, in doing so, he more or less obviously invoked Immanuel Kant's authority. All facts of observation are necessarily seen in the light of the observer's habits of thought, and the most intimate and inveterate of his habits of thought is the experience of his own initiative and endeavours. It is to this "apperception mass" that objects of apperception are finally referred, and it is in terms of this experience that their measure is finally taken. (Veblen [1914] 1990a, 53) Things may well exist in themselves. But the mind only perceives the "object," the "fact," the event, in terms of prestructuring social habits of thought. These internalized social structures give rise to a perceptual schemata, a veritable Kantian structuring of the "apperception mass" that measures and evaluates sensual experience. Facts exist. But for the human mind, every fact is always already a socially mediated interpretation. "The material facts never cease to be, within reasonable limits, raw material; though the limits may be somewhat vague and shifting" (61). Human agents could not continue to survive without a pragmatically adequate rela- tion to the external world. Still, pragmatic adequacy does not mean eternal verity. Mate- rial facts, external to the socialized mind, provide the raw material for perception, but</page><page sequence="6">746 Graham Cassano perception itself works over the material, and the limits of things in themselves become relatively "vague and shifting," at least when conceived in transhistorical or cross-cul- tural terms. The world that exists for one society or culture located within a given histor- ical and industrial nexus need not necessarily be the same world that exists for another society with different historical and economic requirements and conditions. Perhaps Veblen's ideas were not so foreign to his French contemporary's claim that the social world "is itself nothing but a fabric of hallucinations."i13 But Veblen was decidedly not a subjective idealist. Reality is not merely a collective dream but a dream grounded in an inescapable-if "vague and shifting"-relation to material fact. It is evident that these principles and standards of what is right, good, true, and beautiful, will vary from one age to another and from one people to another, in response to the varying conditions of life; inasmuch as these principles are always of the nature of habit; although the variation will of course range only within the limits of that human nature that finds expression in these same prin- ciples of right, good, truth, and beauty. (Veblen [1919] 1964, 3) Once again evoking the ghost of Kant by taking up the "principles and standards of what is right, good, true, and beautiful"-the principles and standards that stand as the basis and goal of Kant's three critiques-Veblen pointed to two limiting factors that bound and circumscribe the efficacy of representation: "human nature" and "the varying conditions of life." Of these factors, Veblen seemed far more interested in the latter. While it might be true that the representation of reality by the socialized mind has only a tangential basis in the "raw material" of things themselves, it is not thereby baseless. No, the material con- ditions that determine a society's technological scheme also ground and affect the repre- sentational schemata through which the world comes to be known. That current technological scheme has an intimate relation to society's representational schemata. Let me be clear upon this especially important point: the mind's representational system is nothing more, nor less, than an aspect of the technological scheme. The world exists for the human mind only as it may be turned to use. In the broadest possible sense, what cannot be taken in hand and put to use does not seem to exist. It disappears from perception, if not from reality conceived or imagined in some absolute or transcendental sense. Cumulatively, therefore, habit creates usages, customs, conventions, precon- ceptions.... Whatever passes current in this way as knowledge of facts is turned to account as far as may be, and so it is worked into a customary scheme of ways and means, a system of technology, into which new elements of information or acquaintance with the nature and use of things are incorporated, assimilated as they come. (Veblen [1914] 1990a, 39) What Veblen called the "system of technology," or the "state of industrial arts," forms "the habitual acquirements of the race" "handed on from one generation to the next, by</page><page sequence="7">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 747 tradition, training, education" (38). These acquirements take on the form of an inte- grated and "customary" institutional system that structures and mediates experience. New information may be attained within this structuring system but only to the extent that it is incorporated and thereby modified by the system itself. Within certain limits, "new information" has the effect of transforming the system but almost never in a funda- mental or radical way. Radical transformations do of course occur, and always as the result of transformed material conditions. But such transformations produce new struc- tures and systems; they do not allow for an unmediated and pure access to facts as such. "Self" and "Science" during the Handicraft Era For Veblen, perception is a matter of training. Consciousness emerges from habit- ual labor performed under a certain technological regime. In The Instinct of Workmanship and the State of the Industrial Arts, Veblen posited several technological modes that pre- cede the modern industrial organization of labor-most importantly, the predatory and handicraft modes. Capitalism begins before heavy industry. And, as Veblen took pains to explain, Adam Smith's theoretical speculations belong to a premodern, precapitalistic social for- mation. 14 That is to say, the first great prophet of capitalism spoke in a voice and with a language still enmeshed within an era when "handicraft," not industry, lay at the base of most commerce. Moreover, the intellectual attitudes and epistemological habits born in the handicraft era continued to hold force well into a historical period marked by a very different organization of technology and production. The values that we tend to identify as essentially modern owe their genesis to this premodern period. Notions of "natural rights," empirical science, causality, and reason emerge together, as a cultural complex, from the ruined dust of medieval darkness. And the lever for this emergence is a new conception of human agency. Earlier, "predatory," cultural forms, where states took shape under the tutelage of priests and warriors, accompanied a form of life and consciousness based upon servitude and mastery. 15 For reasons that have as much to do with the environmental and geographical peculiarities of England as with technological or historical "necessity," predatory culture gave way to the handicraft era, which proceeded to reshape first the Occident and eventually the entire world.16 Again, without tracing the historical specificity of this technological and social transformation,17 I wish to bring out the sensible effects that accompany a new order of technique. In particular, I am interested in two aspects of this transformed sen- sibility: (1) the new conception of personal "agency" and (2) the new conception of a rational and explicable universe. The handicraft economy depends, first, upon restructured habits of labor. No lon- ger does the workman rely upon the unquestioned and unquestionable authority that lay within the purview of warrior chiefs and the priestly caste.</page><page sequence="8">748 Graham Cassano In the technology of handicraft the central fact is always the individual work- man, whether in the crafts proper or in the petty trade. In that era industry is conceived in terms of the skill, initiative and application of the trained individ- ual, and human relations outside the workshop tend also by force of habit to be conceived in similar terms of self-sufficient individuals, each working out his own ends in severalty. (Veblen [19141 1990a, 234) The "central fact" upon which predatory culture depends is always the mastery of a privi- leged and divinely sanctioned ruling body and the servitude of the great mass of the com- munity. With the emergence of the craft guilds and petty traders, a new "central fact" comes to the fore: the individual workman. This individual worker becomes precursor to a new and very nearly modern sense of self-hood. Under earlier technological schemes, the individual lay more or less embedded within the community; he or she found iden- tity not in the distinctions that we associate with contemporary individualism but in the bonds of similitude and subservience that tied all individuals into a single, mutually reli- ant social group."8 Communal bonds anchor the self to soil and blood. That is not so when the handicraft era begins to achieve dominance. "The position of the craftsman in the economy of that time is peculiarly suited to induce a conception of the individual workman as a creative agent standing on his own bottom, and as an ultimate, irreducible factor in the community's make-up" (234-35). Notice that the "position of the craftsman in the economy"-that is, the habits and practices of a new technological regime-induces a new conception of subjectivity. No longer primarily conceiving himself as a member of a social totality or community, the workman, as "creative agent standing on his own bot- tom," becomes an "ultimate" and "irreducible" social fact. The self begins to conceive itself as its own foundation, as an absolute reality, and, as Friedrich Nietzsche said, it pulls itself out of the swamp of being by its own hair. The individual represents a new metaphysical center, but this metaphysical edifice is built upon eminently pragmatic foundations. The man who does things, who is creatively occupied with fashioning things for use, is the central fact in the scheme of things under the handicraft system, and the range of concepts by use of which the technological problems of that era are worked out is limited by the habit of mind so induced in those who have the work in hand and in those who see it done. The discipline of the crafts incul- cates the apprehension of mechanical facts and processes in terms of workman- like endeavors and achievement; so that questions as to what forces are available for use, and of how to turn them to account, present themselves in terms of muscular force and manual dexterity. (236) This new technological and economic form of life induces an epistemological scheme in which the world comes to be known through the categories of habitual labor. The "disci- pline of the crafts" creates a new sense of self, but it also produces a new relation to exter- nal reality. No longer conceived through purely mystical or magical categories, the world</page><page sequence="9">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 749 becomes a world of "mechanical facts and processes" conceived in terms of "workman- like endeavors." Through the force of anthropomorphic projection, the socialized mind discovers a reality in which divine providence governs a lawfully ordered universe explica- ble through cause and effect. In short, with the rise of the handicraft era comes the first glimmers of the modern scientific imagination. Although this concomitant rise of science may seem a bit mysterious, Veblen explained it by the conceptual diffusion of the handicraft scheme. 19 This technological modality became what Veblen elsewhere called a "tone-giving factor" in the society at large ([1904] 1978, 355). Because of its intimate relation to the industry that supports the entire community's well-being, the new discipline affects even those remote from practical labor and "acts as an overruling formative guide in shaping the current habits of thought" (Veblen [1914] 1990a, 238). According to Veblen, the prevalent scientific point of view within a society cannot be separable from the broader attitudes and aptitudes induced by communal habits of life. This question of a scientific point of view, of a particular attitude and animus in matters of knowledge, is a question of the formations of habits of thought; and habits of thought are an outcome of habits of life. A scientific point of view is a consensus of habits of thought current in the community; and the scientist is constrained to believe that this consensus is formed in response to a more or less consistent discipline of habituation to which the community is subjected, and that the consensus can extend only so far and maintain its force only so long as the discipline of habituation exercised by the circumstances of life enforces it and backs it up. (Veblen [1919] 1961, 38-39) The scientific point of view depends upon and elaborates on the pregiven cultural scheme, which in turn determines the constituency of perception. But more than that, scientific authority itself relies upon the authority of intellectual habits enforced by con- tingent circumstance. Rather than being the pure and unmediated revelation of a con- stant reality, scientific knowledge remains rooted in customary norms and the consensus of the community. Veblen seemed unwilling to differentiate scientific truth from ideo- logical fabrication. If the values and perceptions of a community can be classed as ideo- logical, then science, from beginning to end, remains bound by the limits of ideology. "The fabric of institutions intervenes between the material exigencies of life and the spec- ulative scheme of things" (44). That is to say, between the representation and the thing itself there is a third term, the institutional fabric.20 With the new, proto-modern conception of self, and its attendant anthropomor- phic approach to the external universe, two ideas emerge that deserve special attention: the modern scientific notion of causality and the notion of productive intentionality. Early scientific endeavors depended upon both these ideas, so central to the representation of the creative worker. During the handicraft era, this institutional fabric is woven from the threads of the individual worker's endeavor.</page><page sequence="10">750 Graham Cassano In this early phase of modern science its central norm and universal solvent is the concept of workmanlike initiative and efficiency. This is the new organon. Whatever is to be explained must be reduced to this notation and explained in these terms; otherwise the inquiry does not come to rest. (Veblen [1919] 1961, 50-5 1) This "universal solvent" takes form "under the style and title of the 'law of causation"' (50). Just as the workman stands as the certified origin of the handicraft commodity, just as expended labor serves as the foundation for price (the labor theory of value), so too an absolute and determinant cause must stand at the origin of every scientific event. Notice Veblen's language at this point. This new scientific spirit depends upon a fundamental mode of thought that itself relies upon a mode of expression or notation. Hence, this mode of thought depends upon a certain style (i.e., mode of expression or notation). "Whatever is to be explained must be reduced to this notation and explained in these terms," and what cannot be reduced to the notation of elementary cause and effect by definition does not exist. There is a language of science, a style and a notation, and what cannot be translated into its semiotic categories cannot be conceived. The institutional fabric that lies between representation and reality is an essentially linguistic cloth that codes, categorizes, and sorts the world according to its requirements. A language of intention forms the necessary complement to this early scientific lan- guage of causality. Just as the world is governed by ultimate cause, so production lies embedded within a notion of ultimate intent. This language reveals itself in Veblen's discussion of the early conception of the machine. In their beginnings the new mechanical appliances are conceived as improved tools, which extend the reach and power of the workman or which facilitate or lighten the manual operations in which he spends himself. They are, as they aim to be, labor saving devices, designed to further the workmanlike efficiency of the men in whose hands they are placed. ([1914] 1990a, 238) At first machines seem to be extensions of the worker. Or, put another way, they are extensions of the worker's productive intention. They serve that intention primarily by abridging labor. Now, most obviously, Veblen seemed to be writing about devices akin to looms or early steam engines. But he did not limit himself by specifying what machines he meant. No, a machine is any invention that extends the "reach and power of the work- man." That is to say, the machine is any invention that facilitates the smooth working out of productive intent. Certainly, the loom or the steam engine fit this definition. But in a sense, so does the scientific text. After all, scientific language is nothing if not a tool kit for expressing the specific and specialized results of research. And research is always the product of labor, a very material and practical process. Scientific texts represent "labor saving devices, designed to further the workmanlike efficiency of the men in whose hands they are placed." Texts are machines that produce knowledge, and under the</page><page sequence="11">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 751 regime of the handicraft industry, they are conceived anthropomorphically as extensions their author's intention. (See also Veblen [1919] 1961, 66.) With the rise of a new industrial regime, however, there emerge very different notions of production, intent, invention, and science. And it is within this new order that Veblen must situate his own scientific endeavors. Accountancy, the Price System, and the Machine Process The almost insensible transition from small-scale handicraft capitalism to the heavy industry of the modern period begins with a new emphasis upon pecuniary consider- ations. That is to say, the "price system" as it emerges from the handicraft era lays the intellectual groundwork for a new training, the discipline of the machine age. Wherever the handicraft system reaches a fair degree of development the daily life of the community comes to centre about the market and to take on the char- acter given by market relations.... The price system comes into the foreground. With the increase of traffic, book-keeping comes into use among the mer- chants; and as fast as the practice of habitual recourse to the market grows gen- eral, the uncommercial classes also become familiar with the rudimentary conceptions of bookkeeping. (Veblen [1914] l990a, 244) With handicraft technology's new dominance, the world shifts upon its axis. If, at the close of the feudal period we could say, with Shakespeare, that all the world was a stage, then with the rise of this new economic form of life, all the world becomes a marketplace, and all its players become traders. In order to survive, the master craftsman must now necessarily enter into the most debauched economic transactions. But the logical struc- tures induced by his habits of labor, based on the notion of a personal agent at the center of all productive activity, come into conflict with the logic of the marketplace. The logic and concepts of accountancy are wholly impersonal and dispassion- ate; and ... its effect is unavoidably in some degree to induce a statistical habit of mind. It makes immediately for an exact quantitative apprehension of all things and relations that have a pecuniary bearing; and more remotely, by force of the pervasive effect of habituation, it makes for a greater readiness to appre- hend all facts in a similarly objective and statistical fashion, in so far as the facts admit of a quantitative rating. (244-45) Here we begin to perceive the first hints of a fundamental shift, a silent revolution that will shape the trajectory of the modern world. From the logic of the crafts, a logic that is in all its aspects a logic of personality, there begins to grow a new logic, a logic dictated by the demands of the market and pecuniary considerations-a logic that is "impersonal and dispassionate," statistical and quantitative. Although it materializes in the marketplace, this logic, based as it is upon new habits of life, begins to pervade the socialized subject's intellectual world. By "force of the pervasive effect of habituation, it makes for a greater</page><page sequence="12">752 Graham Cassano readiness to apprehend all facts in a similarly objective" fashion. What cannot be quanti- fied, what cannot be conceived through the lens of the impersonal mechanical and pecuniary glass, turns to dust. Accountancy is the beginning of statistics, and the price concept is a type of the objective, impersonal, quantitative apprehension of things. Coincidentally, because they do not lend themselves to this facile rating, facts that will not admit of a quantitative statement and statistical handling decline in men's esteem, considered as facts, and tend in some degree to lose the cogency which belongs to empirical reality. They may even come to be discounted as being of a lower order of reality, or may even be denied factual value. (245) Consider carefully these chilling words. With the rise of this mechanistic and quantita- tive point of view, a new order of reality is born. And that phrase, "new order of reality," is no mere figuration. A new logic has come into force, and that new logic re-orders the world, re-interprets reality, and re-evaluates all previously existing "facts." Those former aspects of reality that "do not lend themselves to this facile rating," that cannot be counted and quantified and sorted according to the demands of impersonal statistical apprehension, "lose the cogency which belongs to empirical reality." Because they vanish from the sphere of perception, in a certain sense they vanish from the sphere of being. 'What cannot be counted must be "discounted." This new training, this new discipline, produces new capacities and insights.21 But at the same time, it induces a new blindness. As a trained capacity, it becomes, simultaneously, a "trained incapacity." Now I can begin to indicate the true depth of Veblen's irony. His is not simply the irony of an occasional turn of phrase like "trained incapacity" or "legitimate sabotage." No, Veblen's whole attitude, his scientific stance, and his scientific logic are thoroughly infused with ironic sensibility. For instance, in this historical transition from a logic of handicraft to the mechanical logic of modernity, Veblen did not find an "evolutionary advance," at least not in the traditional sense.22 The rise of mechanical logic does not sig- nify the movement from illusion into truth. Rather, society merely throws off one insti- tutional fabric, one set of trained incapacities and necessary lacunae, in favor of another. And there is no guarantee that the latter social forms serve human needs any better than those discarded and archaic structures.23 Shadow of the Modern Machine Through a process of economic survival of the fittest, heavy industry displaces handicraft production as the basic technological and economic mode of life and the modern era proper begins. The modern era is the age of the machine. And, just as with the handicraft era before it, the age of the machine brings into being certain necessary epistemological arrangements. These configurations develop out of a new training, a discipline based in impersonal, objective, and mechanical processes. "The machine pro- cess pervades the modern life and dominates it in a mechanical sense. Its dominance is</page><page sequence="13">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 753 seen in the enforcement of precise mechanical measurements and adjustment and the reduction of all manner of things, purposes and acts, necessities, conveniences, and amenities of life to standard units" (Veblen [1904] 1978, 306). Modern life means mechanical life. And this is no mere irony. Through the force of the machine, reality finds itself transformed. It becomes measured, calculable, and rational, and what cannot be measured, calculated, or rationed disappears. This external transformation is at the same time an internal process for the worker. As the world becomes rational, mechanized, so too the worker becomes an aspect of the machine. During the handicraft era, the machine was conceived as a "labor-saving device," an extension of the worker. The machine era inverts this division between machine and human, so that the worker becomes an extension of the machine. "The machine ... compels the adaptation of the workman to his work, rather than the adapta- tion of the work to the workman" (Veblen [1914] 1990a, 310). Elsewhere, he wrote The share of the operative workman in the machine industry is (typically) that of an attendant, an assistant, whose duty it is to keep pace with the machine pro- cess.... His work supplements the machine process, rather than makes use of it. On the contrary the machine process makes use of the workman. The ideal mechanical contrivance in this technological system is the automatic machine. (306-307) With the dawn of the machine age, a new form of subjectivity comes into being. The worker is no longer the central fact of production. And the intention of the worker no longer rules the machine. Rather, the worker him- or herself becomes a supplement to the machine process; he or she becomes the machine's labor-saving device. The machine process "makes use of' the worker. If productive intention remains, it is the intention of the automatic machine and the worker serves as an extension for the machine's purpose. This decentering of the worker is a pragmatic industrial event with profound psy- chic and epistemological consequences. As the dominant "tone-giving factor" in mod- ern life, the implications of the machine process diffuse throughout society and touch areas of life otherwise seemingly unaffected by industry. In particular, the anthropomor- phism of everyday life slowly falls away. In science, this means that the simple eighteenth century idea of causality-a notion based upon the anthropomorphic imputation of workmanlike endeavor to the course of nature-finds itself challenged. Perpetual process displaces final cause. To the technologist the process comes necessarily to count, not simply as the interval of functioning of an initial efficient cause, but as the substantial fact that engages his attention. He learns to think in terms of the process, rather than in terms of a productive cause and a product between which the process intervenes in such a manner as to afford transition from one to the other. (Veblen [1904] 1978, 368)</page><page sequence="14">754 Graham Cassano Thinking in terms set by the discipline of mechanical objectivity, the technologist, and later the scientist, conceives reality as a series of inter-related and cross-cutting processes, as complex structural events rather than linear sequences defined by primal causation. Causation remains but takes shape within a complex set of systemic and structural cir- cumstances that themselves influence outcome. During Veblen's life, these new scientific speculations were only beginning to take root.24 Trained incapacities from a previous technological and industrial order con- tinue to infect the thought of scientists with anthropomorphic and subject-centered conceptions, and necessarily so, since cultural change, for Veblen, is very nearly always of a relatively slow evolutionary sort and not radical renovation. Yet, beginning already with Charles Darwin, Veblen seemed to find a new scientific spirit at work. True, an older generation of thinkers continued to work with outmoded and archaic scientific conceptions. But that work of research which effectually extends the borders of scientific knowledge is nearly all done under the guidance of highly impersonal, mechan- ical, morally and aesthetically colorless conceptions of causal sequence. And this scientific work is carried out only in those communities which are in due contact with the modern mechanically organized industrial system, -only under the shadow of the machine technology. (Veblen [19041 1978, 372) In this passage, as elsewhere in his writings on science, Veblen seemed to be indicting the older scientific formulations and calling for a new scientific regime. Under that new regime, anthropomorphic and subject-centered ideas concerning cause and effect fall away, to be replaced by more epistemologically adequate tools created "under the guid- ance of highly impersonal, mechanical, morally and aesthetically colorless conceptions of causal sequence." Yet, this is decidedly not Veblen's science. His work cannot be con- ceived as "highly impersonal, mechanical" and most certainly not "morally and aestheti- cally colorless." No, in this moment of high moral and aesthetic irony, what appears to be the demand for a new science may well reveal itself as an intellectual despair over the course that science will take under the shadow of the machine. Symbols and Inventions. Let me return for the moment to Veblen's discussion of "inven- tion." Earlier, I intimated that among mechanical contrivances or inventions can be classed the scientific work. I believe this classification to be entirely accurate, since Veblen made no distinction between the cotton gin and the theoretical text. Both are equally inventions. And concerning "inventions" and "inventors," Veblen wrote that it will commonly be found that any single inventor contributes but one radical innovation in any one particular connection; which may then presently be taken up again as a securely objective element by a later inventor and pushed forward by a new move as radical as that to which this original invention owed its origin. (Veblen [1914] 1990, 241)</page><page sequence="15">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 755 When contemplating this passage, it is difficult not to call to mind Veblen's most impor- tant teacher, Charles Sanders Peirce, and his remarks about the "symbol." Symbols grow. They come into being by development out of other signs.... We think only in signs.... If a man makes a new symbol, it is by thoughts involving concepts. So it is only out of symbols that a new symbol can grow. Omne symbolum de symbolo. A symbol, once in being, spreads among the peoples. In use and in experience, its meaning grows. (CP: 2.302)25 Inventions are symbols and symbols, inventions. Peirce meant symbol in the broadest and most limited sense, from a single word to an architectural edifice, from a sentence to a book, from a perception to a philosophical system. And every symbol, once invented, leaves its producer's hand. It grows beyond the intention of its creator. Veblen thought along these Peircean lines when he wrote that "the ulterior consequences of any one of the greater mechanical inventions have in the main been neither foreseen nor intended in the designing of them" ([1914] 1990a, 317). Between the inventor and the life-course of his or her invention, history intervenes and consequences, quite unintended by the originator of the mechanism, transform the nature of the invention. Systems and pro- cesses take the invention and turn it to new uses. In fact, the invention itself can become the inventor's master. "The more serious consequences, especially such as have an insti- tutional bearing, have been enforced by the inventions rather than designed by the inventors." An invention, seized by the fabric of institutions that order the world, turns back upon its creators and turns them into its own supplement.26 Remember, all perception, reality itself, depends upon habits of thought and life in force within a community. Hence, whether text or machine, an invention's efficacy depends upon its relation to the community at large. That is to say, the inventor must share a common language with the community for the invention to carry within it any sense or meaning for that community. For the scientist, this means that all scientific research must be reduced to the language and "notation" of the scientific community. As we have seen, even the most epistemologically sophisticated scientific discourse relies upon the machine's language. But Veblen, as a scientist, questioned the machine age itself, and, by doing so, he risked losing the authorization upon which that science depends. Neither in the physical conditions which it imposes, therefore, nor in the habit- ual ways of observation and reasoning which it requires in the work to be done, is the machine age adapted to the current native endowment of the race.... Not least convincing is the fact that a considerable proportion of those who are held unremittingly to the service of the machine process "break down," fall into premature decay. Physically and spiritually these modern peoples are better adapted to life under conditions radically different from those imposed by this modern technology. (Veblen [1914] 1990a, 320)</page><page sequence="16">756 Graham Cassano Modern workers, as mechanized women and men, work in service to the machine. But "physically and spiritually ... modern peoples are better adapted to life under" radically different and less mechanized social conditions. Since they have become mere biological contrivances, the industrial demands made upon their lives cause "premature decay" and incessant "break down." All of which goes to show, what is the point in question here, that however exacting and however pervasive the discipline of the machine process may be, it can not, after all, achieve its perfect work in the way of habituation in the popu- lation of Christendom as it stands. The limit of tolerance native to the race, physically and spiritually, is short of that unmitigated materialism and unremit- ting mechanical routine to which the machine technology incontinently drives. (320-21) The dominance of the machine era cannot achieve perfection within the Occidental pop- ulation, as it stands. I'd like to pay particular attention to this phrase, "as it stands." Despite his discussions of more or less archaic notions like "race" and "instinct," Veblen cannot be called a biological determinist. The limits of the biological subject are as vague and shifting as the limits of facts themselves. That's not to say there are no biological lim- its to human adaptation; we imagine there must be. But we do not know what those lim- its actually are. They define a horizon of possibility, always expanding in unexpected directions. No, when Veblen wrote of the "physical and spiritual" limits of the western worker's adaptive potential, he specifically indicated that he meant the population "as it stands." The fearful possibility that lies behind these lines is the possibility that the machine order might call into existence a new race of workers, better adapted to its requirements-a race of mechanical supplements, biologically produced. I think Veblen's deepest concern lay in the fact that every day we become more like the machines that once served our needs. (At the same time, unlike, say, Max Weber, Veblen was not a fatal- ist who perceived the machine age as an iron cage. The very concern that he evinced in this passage indicates the possibility and indeed the necessity of transforming humanity's relations to its products. But such a transformation can begin only once we recognize the danger at hand.) No longer merely labor-saving devices, the machines that populate our world rule us in the most fundamental sense. They rule our actions, our minds, our very reality, by transforming not only our epistemological outlook but our practical circumstance. The largest secure result of these various modern contrivances designed to facil- itate and abridge travel and communication appears to be an increase of the vol- ume of traffic per unit of outcome, acceleration of the pace and heightening of the tension at which the traffic is carried on, and a consequent increase of ner- vous disorders and the shortening of the effective working life of those engaged in this traffic. But in these matters invention is the mother of necessity, and within the scope of these contrivances for facilitating and abridging labour</page><page sequence="17">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 757 there is no alternative, and life is not offered on any other terms. (Veblen [19141 1990a, 316) Invention becomes the mother of necessity. Our lives increasingly depend upon our con- trivances, and the gods we serve are machines. Moreover, "there is no alternative, and life is not offered on any other terms." This last line seems to me particularly significant for Veblen's science. Life is not offered on any other terms. The only language we have is the language of the machine age. This is true for the social reformer. This is true for the scien- tist. Wlhatever we have to offer, we offer in these terms alone. As the world stands, all lan- guage, all discourse, necessarily depends upon the epistemology of this machine age. Yet, I would contend, these passages make it clear that Veblen will not accept this seeming metaphysical necessity. His persistent and unyielding paraliptic scientific irony consis- tently undermines the very metaphysical structure his analysis reveals. Irony as Negation I think Veblen revealed something of his own ironic method when he addressed the claims of socialism in The Theory of the Business Enterprise. He wrote There is little agreement among socialists to a programme for the future. Their constructive proposals are ill-defined and inconsistent and almost entirely nega- tive. The negative character of the socialistic propaganda has been made a point of disparagement by its critics, perhaps justly. But their predilection for shifty iconoclasm, as well as the vagueness and inconsistency of their constructive pro- posals, are in the present connection to be taken as evidence that the attitude of the socialists cannot be expressed in positive terms given by the institutions at present in force. ([1904] 1978, 337-38) Now, it can hardly be denied that to some extent Veblen's depiction of the socialists describes his own work.27 Certainly, the reader finds over and again a "predilection for shifty iconoclasm." In fact, this shifty iconoclasm seems the essence of Veblen's style. His texts continually shift the ground upon which the reader stands, shattering our idols and leaving little of constructive value in their place. And Veblen used this stylistic technique precisely because his "attitude" toward modern history "cannot be expressed in positive terms given by the institutions at present in force." He could not posit. Therefore, he negated. Sabotage Redux At this point, I need to return, very briefly, to the question of sabotage. Veblen defined sabotage as the "derangement of the industrial system, such as to entail hard- ships on the community at large or on some particular section of it" ( [19211 1990b, 99). Sabotage is perpetrated daily by the so-called "vested interests": corporations, govern-</page><page sequence="18">758 Graham Cassano ments, unions.28 In each case, the corporate group seeks its own profit "at more than a proportionate cost to the rest of the community." Since the community depends upon the machine process, any derangement of the machine will "entail hardship on the com- munity at large or on some particular section of it." Sabotage "does not afford either the spiritual or the material ground for a popular overturn" (98). Such a ground requires the intervention of historical forces beyond the agency of the saboteurs. At best, sabo- tage derails the system or some part of it. "But sabotage is not revolution" (99). And, for Veblen, scientific language cannot effect a revolutionary overturn. Science depends upon the scientific community. And that community depends, in turn, upon the broader social world based in the epistemological presuppositions of the machine. Sci- entific discourse cannot hope to overturn science, any more than organized sabotage can overturn the economic system. At best, scientific discourse, as sabotage, deranges an already deranged system. It can be, and for Veblen it was, a hammer thrown into the works. Veblen's scientific aspirations were entirely negative. He hoped to "entail hard- ship," "derange the system," to break open the smooth operations of mechanized thought. And he did so through a consistent and inescapable stylistic irony. Summary and Conclusion Thorstein Veblen based his political economy on a sociology of knowledge in which emergent consciousness produces an epistemological point of view. That point of view, born from socially shared habits of life and work, sets the boundaries for what comes to be called reality. It selects significant perceptions and structures them into posi- tive fact. An institutional fabric weaves reality into its web of signification, and the infor- mation available to the reasoning and socialized mind depends upon this metaphysical web. Every human society produces such a semiotic architecture, but the edifice built upon the ground of the machine seems particularly unfit for human habitation. At the same time that he indicted capitalism, on another front Veblen radically questioned the semiotic and psychological structures imposed by mechanized, modern life. And, yet, in doing so, he seemed to cut the ground away from his own critique, since science itself depends upon the epistemological values inculcated by the machine. For the scientist, as for the "common man," "life is not offered on any other terms." Veblen compensated for this linguistic lack by holding to the terms of scientific dis- course, but turning them back upon themselves; he used the scientific stance to critique the limitations imposed by the machine age's scientific point of view; and this critical negation took the form of a logical and stylistic irony. In this sense, by negating science and yet clinging to the tenacity of its norms, Veblen turned scientific ideology on its head and transformed its propositions into a kind of objective "negative mysticism.,"29 Still, Veblen did not reject science. He did not reject the machine age. But he called them into question. He examined their limits and the limitations they impose upon the architecture of human consciousness. And, in that questioning, he guided us toward an</page><page sequence="19">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 759 unspoken understanding of the tasks that must be undertaken if we are ever to move from the "machine age" to a new age, a "post-modern era," in which a socialized human- ity might be finally unbound, if not unbounded. Notes 1. "But it has been only during the later decades of the modern era-during that time interval that might be fairly called the post-modern era-that this mechanistic conception of things has begun seriously to affect the current system of knowledge and belief' (Veblen [19191 1964, 11; emphasis added). 2. Georg Lukacs has applied this notion only to "literary" creation, but I think it aids in our understanding of the "literary" character of a scientific text. 3. Lukacs has carefully distinguished an author's conscious "intention" from the "intention" of the text as a linguistic artifact. 4. In the context of an essay, it is, of course, impossible to recount the voluminous literature on Thorstein Veblen's work. For a very good discussion of Veblen's interpreters, I refer the reader to Diggins 1999, 208-224. There is not much I can add to John Diggins' chapter, but I will cite several texts that had a decisive influence on my own view of Veblen's project. Doug Dowd's Thorstein Veblen ([1964] 2000) serves as a very able introduction to his political econ- omy, as well as to his social theory. In addition, Dowd's later work, The Twisted Dream: Capital- ist Development in the United States since 1776 (1974), uses, as its theoretical architecture, a fascinating hybrid of Veblen's and Karl Marx's theories. E. K. Hunt, in his classic Property and Prophets: The Evolution of Economic Institutions and Ideologies (2003), situated Veblen's theories within the political economic tradition and went some way toward demonstrating the rela- tionship between those theories and the historical forces that shaped Veblen's times. Among the many other contributions to Veblen studies by political economists, I would like to men- tion the fine work of Adil Mouhammed. (See, for example, his essay, "Veblen and the Busi- ness Cycle: A Marxist Perspective" [19941.) As good as many of the older works are, none of the many sociological readings of Veblen really equal Diggins' monumental study, unless we consider Theodor Adorno a sociologist. His essay on The Theory of the Leisure Class, "Veblen's Attack on Culture" (1981), captures much of what is best in Veblen by highlighting the strength of Veblen's myopic perspective. Although Adorno's work does not resemble the present essay in method or style, it is very much in the spirit of these inquiries. 5. I need to emphasize that while this is a useful method for unpacking Veblen's dense insights, I would not privilege it as the single best or only method for interpreting his work. After all, the- oretical inquiry moves upon multiple fronts, and each method has particular strengths and weakness. Each method can highlight different aspects of a theory, a work, a text, or a life. In this sense, I need to distance the method pursued in these pages from the "esoteric" inquiries produced by Leo Strauss (1988) and his school, who claim, through such readings, to get at the "true" or "authentic" meaning of a work. (Compare Strauss 1988.) 6. "The instrumental-ceremonial distinction is an essential aspect of institutionalism. It also is characterized as the technological and institutional distinction: that between making goods and making money, between workmanship and ownership, between serviceability and profit- ability. It is most often associated with Veblen, and frequently is identified simply as the Veblenian dichotomy" (Miller 1998, 18). 7. Let me make one further clarification: While it is true that both capitalism and industry can occur in various combinations in various social and cultural forms, in the works I address within this essay (especially The Theory of the Business Enterprise, The Instinct of Workmanship, and The Vested Interests) Veblen's subject is capitalism and industrywithin the Occidental con- text. In this particular context, modern industry and modern science emerge through a pro-</page><page sequence="20">760 Graham Cassano cess intimately connected to the development of capitalism. While it would be too strong to say that capitalism produced the modern scientific spirit, I attempt to demonstrate below that capitalism and commerce and, in particular, what Veblen called the "logic and concepts of accountancy," which emerged during the "handicraft era," had a decisive effect upon the development of modern science in its present (western) form. (See the following section, "Accountacy, the Price System, and the Machine Process.") Furthermore, this same logic, with its impersonal methods, produced "a greater readiness to apprehend all facts in a simi- larly objective ... fashion." In other words, just as this statistical and objective habit of mind grows out of commercial experience, it prepares the social subject for a scientific attitude and technical point of view that ultimately comes into tension with the necessary waste associated with capitalism (that is, industry under the rule of the "price-system"). Or, put more simply and, admittedly, too strongly, capitalism produces the forces of its own potential dissolution. In this argument, Veblen's irony achieves a certain dialectical elegance. 8. Nonetheless, Veblen's distrust of modernity has less to do with the reactionary dream of returning to some perfected past than with a romantic and revolutionary utopianism akin to the spirit that animates the work of Walter Benjamin, Adorno, and the Frankfurt School. Veblen's attitude toward modernity can be most readily recognized in the repressed utopia that haunts his irony. Although I think Veblen's understanding of cultural prehistory is nei- ther self-evident nor as obvious as it seems, Adorno got at something important when he found Veblen's utopia in a primeval golden age. "It is deeply ironic ... that Veblen's loyalty is compelled to take the form which he so vigorously condemns in bourgeois society, that of regression. In his mind, the only hope lies in the prehistory of man. All the happiness which for him is excluded by dreamless realism, by pliant adaptation to the conditions of the indus- trial world, is reflected in the image of a paradisical golden age" (1981, 87). My only argument with Adorno's reading is that I think for Veblen this golden age may never have actually existed, and therein, perhaps, lies Veblen's irony. Veblen's "image of a paradisical golden age" has as much or as little reality as the utopian image Benjamin posited in "On Language as Such and on the Language of Man." (Compare Benjamin 1978, 314-32.) 9. "Sabotage" is a derivative of "sabot," which is French for a wooden shoe. It means going slow, with a dragging, clumsy movement.... So it has come to describe any maneuver of slowing-down, inefficiency, bungling, obstruction. In American usage the word is very often taken to mean forcible obstruction, destructive tac- tics, industrial frightfulness, incendiarism and high explosives, although that is plainly not its first meaning, nor its most common. Nor is that its ordinary mean- ing as the word is used among those who have advocated a recourse to sabotage as a means of enforcing an argument about wages or the conditions of work. The ordinary meaning of the word is better defined by an expression which has latterly come into use among the I.W.W., "conscientious withdrawal of effi- ciency"-although that phrase does not cover all that is rightly to be included under this technical term. (Veblen [19211 1990b, 38) 10. Since Veblen revealed this ironic attitude through his use of rhetorical figures, a word needs to be said about rhetoric. In their semiotic textbook, Oswald Ducrot and Tzvetan Todorov offered some twenty examples of the technical rhetorical terms. Of these, there are three dom- inant tropes that Veblen seemed to utilize. First, he often used irony, in the proper and limited sense, as "the use of a word to express the meaning of its antonym." But Veblen also tended to favor hyperbole, or "a quantitative augmentation of one of the properties of an object, a state, and so on," as well as, and especially, paralipsis, "a formula by means of which one declares that one is not saying what one is saying in the sentence itself' (Ducrot and Todorov 1979, 277-78). These rhetorical figures, or tropes, form the scaffolding upon which Veblen built his architecture of irony. 11. "The state of the industrial art is a joint stock of knowledge derived from past experience, and is held and passed on as an indivisible possession of the community at large. It is the indis-</page><page sequence="21">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 761 pensable foundation of all productive industry, of course, but. . . this joint stock is no man's individual property" (Veblen [19211 1990, 56). 12. I mean, of course, the essay was published in C. S. Peirce's lifetime. In fact, it was published very near the time when Peirce instructed Veblen on logic atJohns Hopkins. (Compare Coser 1979.) 13. Emile Durkheim self-consciously located his work as a revision of Kantian epistemology. Like Immanuel Kant, Durkheim understood the life of the mind as symbolic life. But unlike Kant, he claimed that these symbols or representations are not individual products of eternally valid propositional norms; they are, rather, collective representations built up into a system of com- mon understandings by social agents engaged in social activity. "Thus, in all its aspects and at every moment of its history, social life is only possible thanks to a vast symbolism" ([1912] 1995, 233). These collective representations become a systematic grid of intelligibility laid over the material realities of existence. And our only access to such so-called material facts are through these distorted and distorting representations. The whole social world seems populated with forces that in reality exist only in our minds.... From a physical point of view, man is nothing but a system of cells, and from the mental point of view, a system of representations.... There is a sense, of course, in which our representations of the external world is itself noth- ing but a fabric of hallucinations. The odors, tastes, and colors that we place in bodies are not there, or at least are not there in the way we perceive them. After a fashion, they do express the properties of particular materials.... But collective representations often impute to the things to which they refer properties that do not exist in them in any form or to any degree whatsoever.... [Slocial thought, with its imperative authority, has a power that individual thought cannot possibly have. By acting on our minds, it can make us see things in the light that suits it; according to circumstances, it adds to or takes away from the real. Hence, there is a realm of nature in which the formula of idealism is almost literally applicable; that is the social realm. There, far more than anywhere else, the idea creates the reality. ([19121 1995, 228-29) Durkheim reconstructed the basis of Kant's critique, but it is still Kantian in the stron- gest possible sense. Things, as they exist in themselves, disappear beneath a socially con- structed conceptual schemata, or "fabric of hallucinations." Social life is a collective delirium that recasts the world's facticity in its own terms. The media through which social life exists, collective representations, possess an "imperative authority" that transforms existence as it is into an idea, a shared dream that becomes what we take as reality. The individual agent has no choice in these matters. She or he is born into a world that always already exists as meaningful. And to become a truly socialized agent, subjectivity must take in these meanings and partici- pate in the systems of representations that extend and substantiate the life of signs. Acquisi- tion of a mind means acquisition of a language, and every language is always already a system of social institutions. Max Weber was more reticent when it came to taking an overt and radical position on these recondite issues. Yet, as his methodological writings demonstrate, he, like Durkheim, felt it necessary to confront and revise Kant's ideas. (Compare Schluchter 1981.) But for the purposes at hand, I will leave aside Weber's methodological inquiries and turn, rather, to his most practical analysis of contemporary capitalism. Like Durkheim, Weber figured contem- porary society as a system of relations that exist before the individual subject and to which that individual must accommodate him- or herself in order to survive. The capitalistic economy of the present day is an immense cosmos into which the individual is born, and which presents itself to him, at least as an individual, as an unalterable order of things in which he must live. It forces the individual, in so far as he is involved in the system of market relationships, to conform to capitalistic rules of action.... Thus the capitalism of to-day, which has come to dominate eco-</page><page sequence="22">762 Graham Cassano nomic life, educates and selects the economic subjects which it needs through a process of economic survival of the fittest. ([ 1920] 1958, 54-55) Although Weber did not refer specifically to symbolic life at this point, there is still an important correspondence between this passage and Durkheim's words. Capitalism, or mod- ern capitalist society, presents the individual qua individual as an "unalterable order of things." Furthermore, this unalterable social order, with its imperative authority, "educates and selects" social agents appropriate to its functional requirements. In order to survive, the social agent must become fluent in the language of capital. Educated by and through the rigor- ous disciplines of the capitalist economy, the biological individual becomes a social self. Now, I do not mean to imply a perfect correspondence between these two textual moments. Clearly, Durkheim's concerns with symbolic or semiotic conditions lay quite apart from Weber's more seemly and staid comments on the institutional economic necessities of contemporary life. Yet it does seem worthwhile to emphasize Weber's use of language in this context. Always a man to choose his words with care, Weber called capitalism an "immense cosmos," an "unalterable order of things." Furthermore, the monograph which produced these lines, 7he Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism, represents the most acute analysis of the symbolic and ideological preconditions for the emergence of the contemporary world. True, even in his methodological writings, Weber never really confronted the disruptive ques- tion of language. But it lies in the background of his work, in the same way that political econ- omy serves as an underpinning for Durkheim's own writings on symbolic systems. Nonetheless, I think it would be fair to characterize Weber's epistemological position as a sort of neo-Kantian pragmatic materialism, while Durkheim's stance appears to be a neo-Kantian semiotic idealism. It is this context that underscores the import of Veblen's work. In a vital sense, Veblen's semiotic pragmatism presents a mediating position between Weberian materi- alism and Durkheimian idealism. (For a thorough discussion of Veblen's relationship to the so-called "classical" social theorists, compare Diggins 1999, especially part 2.) 14. Veblen [ 19141 1990a. 15. "In the course of this further elaboration of a predatory civilisation, the institutions proper to a large scale and to a powerful despotism and nobility resting on a servile people, were devel- oped into a finished system; in which the final arbiter is always irresponsible force and in which the all-pervading social relation is personal subservience and personal authority" (Veblen [19141 1990a, 168). I need to emphasize that "predatory culture" does not refer to a historical "stage," at least not in the Marxist or Hegelian sense. Rather, it is a technological mode, and, as such, does not necessarily lead to a "next step." In fact, Veblen is quite clear on this point: more often than not, predatory cultures end historical or technological develop- ment. And "the mechanic arts make little if any progress under such a discipline." No, for Veblen the rise of commerce and the handicraft era seems to be a happy historical acci- dent-explicable, but not necessary. 16. Veblen 119141 1990a. 17. "In a passably successful fashion the peoples of Christendom made the transition from a frankly predatory and servile establishment, in the Dark Ages, to a settled, quasi-peaceable sit- uation resting on fairly secure property rights, chiefly in land, by the close of the Middle Ages. This transition was accompanied by a growth of handicraft, itinerant merchandising and industrial towns, so massive as to outlive and displace the feudal system under whose tutelage it took its rise, and of so marked a technological character as to have passed into history as the 'era of handicraft"' (Veblen [19141 1990, 231-32). As compelling as it would be to trace this temporal passage, especially with an eye to the Marxist or even the Weberian narrative con- cerning the same historical moment, I must limit myself to Veblen's description of the handi- craft era that rises from the ruins of medieval despotism. 18. In the beginning, that is to say, in the European beginning, men lived in small and close groups. Control was close within the group, and the necessity of subordinat- ing individual gains and preferences to the common good was enjoined on the</page><page sequence="23">Stylistic Sabotage and Thorstein Veblen's Scientific Irony 763 group by the exigencies of the case, on pain of extinction.... The needful sense of solidarity would touch not simply or most imperatively the joint prestige of the group, but rather the joint material interests; and would enforce a spirit of mutual support and dependence. Which would be rather helped than hindered by a jeal- ous attitude of joint prestige; so long as no divergent interests of members within the group were in a position to turn this state of the common sentiment to their own particular advantage. (Veblen [19171 1998, 49-50) 19. The discipline of the handicraft industry ... touches first, and most intimately and coercively, the classes engaged in the manual work of industry, but it also nec- essarily pervades the community at large and gathers in its net all individuals and classes who have to do with the facts of industry, near or remote. It gives its specific character to the habits of life of the community that lives under its dispensation and by its means, and so it acts as an overruling formative guide in shaping the cur- rent habits of thought. (Veblen [1914] 1990, 237-38) 20. Once again, recall Durkheim's "fabric of hallucinations." 21. "The discipline exercised by the mechanical occupations . . . is a discipline of the habits of thought" (Veblen [1904] 1978, 312). 22. E.g., as progressive development. 23. At this point it becomes clear that Veblen's irony represents a form of dialectical thinking in precisely Kenneth Burke's sense. For Burke, "irony" and "dialectic" are interchangeable terms. And although Veblen made little or no use of the term "dialectics," he used his irony in a (Burkean) dialectical way. (Compare Burke 1969.) 24. "The older preconceptions are, of course, not wholly eliminated from the intellectual appara- tus of scientific research and generalization. The cultural situation whose discipline gives the outcome is made up of inherited traditional notions at least as much as of the notions brought in by the machine process. Even among the scientific adepts there has been no com- plete break with the past; necessarily not, since they are, after all, creatures of their own gener- ation" (Veblen [1904] 1978, 371). 25. All my citations of Peirce follow the referential conventions of Peircean studies. "CP" stands for "Collected Papers," "2" represents the volume number, and ".302" indicates the para- graph number. 26. In this theory of the inventor as supplement to her/his invention, we begin to perceive Veblen's understanding of human agency. Veblen is not a determinist in the strict sense. Human action has an impact upon the world. But between the act and its effect, an institu- tional fabric intervenes. That fabric determines the limits of the human agent's effectiveness. In other words, society changes because of human action, but those actions remain bound by the system of institutions that govern the social world. 27. It certainly describes C. Wright Mills' and Hans Gerth's description of Veblen's writings. 28. "The A.F. of L. is a business organization with a vested interest of its own; for keeping up prices and keeping down supply, quite after the usual fashion of management by the other Vested Interests; not for managing productive industry or even for increasing the output of goods produced under any management. At the best, its purpose and ordinary business is to gain a little something for its own members at a more than proportionate cost to the rest of the community; which does not afford either the spiritual or the material ground for a popu- lar overturn" (Veblen [1921] 1990, 98). Keep in mind that what Veblen said of organized labor he applied equally to the other vested interests (e.g., capital and the State). 29. What Lukacs said about the "objectivity of the novel" can usefully be applied to the "objectiv- ity" of Veblen's science. "The writer's irony is a negative mysticism to be found in times with- out a god.... [Iln it there is the deep certainty, expressible only by form-giving, that through not-desiring-to-know and not-being-able-to-know he has truly encountered, glimpsed and grasped the ultimate, true substance, the present, non-existent God. This is why irony is the objectivity of the novel" ([1920] 1971, 90).</page><page sequence="24">764 Graham Cassano References Adorno, Theodor. "Veblen's Attack on Culture."
