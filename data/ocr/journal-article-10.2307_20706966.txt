Manuscripts submitted for consideration are reviewed by academic readers before being accepted for publication. Address all correspondence to The Editor, Journal of the Polynesian Society, Department of Anthropology, the University of Auckland, Private Bag 92019, Auckland, New Zealand (E-mail j. huntsman@ auckland.ac.nz). Manuscripts should be typed on A4 or similar papers, on one side of the paper and with all material double-spaced. Submit the original plus a photocopy but keep a further copy to guard against loss. Manuscripts will not be returned to authors unless requested. Simple references to literature should be placed in the text giving only the surname of the author, the date of publication and the page number in the following form (Best 1924:184). Endnotes should be kept to a minimum, and they must be numbered consecutively throughout the text and placed together on a separate sheet at the end of the text. Any figure captions should likewise be on a separate sheet. On a further sheet complete references to all works cited must be listed, arranged in alphabetical and calendrical order, as in the following examples: Best, Elsdon, 1924. The Maori, Vol. 1. Wellington: Polynesian Society. Firth, Raymond, 1936. We, the Tikopia. London: George Allen and Unwin. -1940. The analysis of mana: An empirical approach. Journal of the Polynesian Society, 49:483-510. Howard, Alan, and John Kirkpatrick, 1989. Social organisation. In A. Howard and R. Borofsky (eds), Developments in Polynesian Ethnology. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, pp.47-94. If two or more works by the same author published in the same year are cited, they should be distinguished in both citations and references by small letters immediately following the date of publication (e.g., 1960a, 1960b). Maps and line illustrations must be drawn in black ink on heavy white paper. Lettering of a professional standard is required and must be legible when reduced to JPS page size. Photographs submitted for publication should be of high quality, printed on single-weight glossy paper. Manuscripts, photographs, drawings and maps which do not meet JPS format and technical requirements will be returned to authors and will not be considered for publication until they are brought into conformity with the instructions set out above. The views expressed by contributors are their own. In publishing them, neither the Editor nor the Society necessarily endorses them.</page></plain_text>
