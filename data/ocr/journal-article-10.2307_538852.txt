<plain_text><page sequence="1">Myth, Literature and the African World. By Wole Soyinka. (Cambridge: Cambridge Universi- ty Press, 1976. Pp. xii + 168, preface, appendix, and index. No price given.) This book is Wole Soyinka's testimony to the validity of the African worldview and its distinct existence as "self-apprehended" by the African sensibility and as expressed in myth, ritual, and literature. It is also largely an elaboration of the thesis already propounded in the author's earlier essay, "The Fourth Stage (Through the Mysteries of Ogun to the Origin of Yoruba Tragedy)," which is included here as an appendix. The author's immediate motiva- tion is a desire to discard his increasingly uncomfortable reputation as an anti-Africanist, earned with the facetious but famous dismissal of nigritude as analogous to tigritude. The arguments are accordingly strident and sometimes sensational because Soyinka feels "stabbed in the back" by his European ideological cocultists whom he accuses of exploiting his anti- negritude stance to advance their own racist denial of distinct Africanity. Appropriately, his auto-rehabilitation begins with the concession of some significant achievements to the nigritude movement-the vision to reinstitute and reforge the racial psyche after centuries of relentless European assault, the attempts to establish a distinct and glorious identity for the race, and the efforts toward effecting a "universal alliance with the world's dispossessed." His objections, revised and refined, are to the movement's tendency toward oversimplifications, and its strategic blunder in basing its racial affirmations on the same dia- lectical premises employed by European deniers of the race. Unlike Jean-Paul Sartre, in other words, he does not see the appropriation of the very weapons of racism to combat it as a credi- ble strategic coup. Of special interest to the folklorist are the first two of the four essays that comprise the core of the book, "Morality and Aesthetics in the Ritual Archetype," and "Drama and the African World-View." The other two form a two-part discussion on modern African writing that might easily be regarded as the most scintillating and impressively intelligent dissertation on the subject as far as it goes. In the essay on morality, a dichotomy is established between the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 85 African (specifically Yoruba) and the Western conceptions of divinity. By contrasting the por- trayal of the Yoruba arch divinity, Qbatdld (brisha Nid or 6bsha-ild), in Obotunde Ijimere's play, The Imprisonment of Obatala, with the portrayal of the same divinity in the Brazilian Zor Zeljan's The Story of Oxala, Soyinka concludes that Yoruba gods exist in the most immediately accessible part of the "cosmic totality" -Earth-while their Western counterparts are sky- gods. Further, Yoruba gods are anthropomorphic, especially in their proneness to excesses and blunders, while Western gods are clothed in infallibility because of a Christianity-induced "at- tenuation of terrestrialism." (The point, simply, is that African gods are more humane, because more human, than Western gods.) Despite this characterization of Yoruba gods, Soyinka consistently refers to QObthlb as a saint and rationalizes i~gn's bloody lapses as creative urges. The dichotomy is extended to the realm of drama in the second essay in which Soyinka argues that the nonterrestrial essence of Western gods has robbed the Western world of the in- tense ritual drama that enables the African to "breach the fearful chthonic realm for meanings of existence and to transcend his human limitations," while simultaneously affording the gods, in keeping with a "cosmic principle of complementarity," the human contact without which they are incomplete. The arguments are fascinating, especially as they are couched in Soyinka's characteristically ornate, self-commemorative semantics. However, they self-atomize under close and disciplined analysis. Few of the author's assertions, even those about the Yoruba world, are not suscepti- ble to serious objections, and his analysis of the Western worldview is full of either serious misconceptions or deliberate, self-serving misrepresentations. The following are just a few of the many possible objections. (1) The choice of Obotunde Ijimere as an example of a "self- apprehending" African is unfortunate because, unknown to Soyinka, Ijimere is none other than Ulli Beier (a German who, one must admit, has been much involved in Nigerian cultural life), and his play is in very important respects (his blatant lewdness, for example) at variance with the African way. (2) Soyinka is guilty of card stacking in his unfavorable comparison of Western theater to the African; there can be no validity in juxtaposing the essentially social and pleasurable institution to Africa's cosmically awesome religious rituals and declaring the former imaginatively flaccid by comparison. (3) Soyinka ascribes to moral considerations what he sees as the "analytical aberration" of the Western theatrical convention "which claims that the right (actor's) wing of the stage is 'stronger' than the left." Soyinka is obviously unaware that the convention is explained not by morality but by the psychodynamics of visual percep- tion. Since the Western world reads from left to right, objects and actions located to the au- dience's left (actor's right) will assume primacy over, and thus be "stronger" than, those to the opposite side. The foregoing objections might be discounted when one remembers that Soyinka intends his book as an admittedly and unabashedly partisan manifesto of racial identity. The reader who accepts it as a reliable systematic exposition of the African world rather than as the highly speculative rumination it is does so at great risk. Finally, the Cambridge publishers deserve to be embarrassed by the dismal copy editing they did on the book. University ofNebraska OYEKAN OWOMOYELA Lincoln</page></plain_text>
