<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE Prepared by Sidney Glazer, Consultant in Near East Bibliography, Library of Congress. With contributions from: Elizabeth Bacon, Richard Ettinghausen, Sidney Glazer, Harold W. Glidden, Harvey P. Hall, Louis E. Leopold, Jr., George C. Miles, Leon Nemoy, M. Perlmann, C. Rabin, Mohammed Rashti, and Andreas Tietze. Note: It is the aim of the Bibliography to present a selective and annotated listing of peri- odical material dealing with the Middle East generally since the rise of Islam. In order to avoid unwarranted duplication of bibliographies already dealing with certain aspects and por- tions of the area, the material included will cover only North Africa and Muslim Spain, the Arab world, Ethiopia and Eritrea, Turkey, the Transcaucasian states of Soviet Russia, Iran, Afghanistan, and Turkestan. An attempt is made to survey all periodicals of importance in these fields. The ancient Near East and Byzantium are excluded; so also Zionism, Palestine, and Israel in view of the current, cumulative bibliography in this field: Zionism and Palestine, a publication of the Zionist Archives and Library in New York. Greater completeness of the Bibliography would be ensured if authors would be kind enough to mail offprints of their articles, especially when published in the less accessible jour- nals, to the following address: Dr. Sidney Glazer, I47-22 Village Road (Apt. B), Jamaica 2, New York, U.S.A. For list of abbreviations, see page 502. GEOGRAPHY (General, description, travel and exploration, natural history, geology) 5I2I GAULMIER, JEAN.

"Deux episodes des relations diplomatiques arabo-byzantines au Xe siecle." Bull. des Etudes Orient. I3 (I949-5I) 5I-69. Opening with a resume of the legal aspects of ambassadorial ex- changes between Muslims and non-Mus- lims, the article proceeds with the story of the Byzantine grandee Samonas and the situation in Cyprus. 5129 DUNLOP, D. M. "Aspects of the Khazar problem." Trans. of Glasgow Univ. Orient. Soc. 13 (I95I) 33-44. Saljuq was brought up at the Khazar court. His sons bear Jewish names.

Emendation of Chinese names which are faultily transliterated in the Persian text. 5I31 PRITSAK, OMELJAN. "Von den Karluk zu den Karachaniden." Z.D.M.G. IOI ( %95i) 270-300. The Turkic peoples in the 7th-8th centuries and their contacts with the Chinese. Islam's eastern neigh- bors, they ruled the steppes in the gth century.

"Lebanon: Israel's friendliest neighbor." Commentary (New York) 6 (Je '52) 551-9. While timid and self- effacing in foreign affairs ("they are mortally terrified of doing anything that Cairo might construe as rocking the pan- Arab boat"), the Lebanese are inept and corrupt in internal politics. The Communist snowball grows larger, as the professional and intellectual elite become angrier and more frustrated." 5137 ALEXANDER, MARK. "The Near East's communist-fascist front." Commentary 13 (My '52) 456-62. This alliance spells great danger for the West. The right-wing extremists are generally recruited from the middle class, the urban professionals and intellectuals (not from the very wealthy groups) who are intensely patriotic and anxious for social and political reform, which they feel can be accomplished only by a communist revolution. They do not fear Soviet domination, for they regard the USSR as ruled not by workers and peasants but by professionals and technicians co- operating with the party apparatus. Hence, the Arab intellectuals are persuaded that their political and economic status would not be lowered, indeed it might even rise, in a communist state. 5138 BOGOUTDINOV, A. M. "From the history of the socio-political thinking of the Tajik people." (in Russian) Voprosy Fil. (Mos- cow) I (I95I) 126-36. On the writings of Ahmad Donish, Sidiki, and S.

"The forces that have made the position of Great Britain difficult . . were not brought into being by a lack of planning at one moment in history. . They are the same forces that confront the West over far larger areas of the earth's surface: rampant nationalism and the threat of Soviet expansion." 5I40 CHARIYEV, G. A. "From the socio-political thinking of the Turkmen people." (in Rus- sian) loprosy Fil. i (I95I) 119-25. Con- centrates on the poet Mahtumkuli. 5141 EMERIT, M. "La crise syrienne et l'expan- sion 6conomique frangaise en I86o." Rev. Hist. (Ap '52). 5142 FISCHER, A. J. "Persia between feudalism and terror." Contemp. Rev. (London) 1040 (Ag '52) 74-80. No country this side of the Iron Curtain could be more unpleasant for a democrat to live in than Iran, if one is to judge by this gloomy report. 5143 GREENE, MARC T. "Morocco grows res- tive." Fortnightly (London) 1027 (JI '52) 24-9. Some disagreeable details on Ameri- can military construction operations. 5144 GUILLAUME, AUGUSTIN. "The French accomplishment in Morocco." For.

A vigorous and skillful</page><page sequence="3">BIBLIOGRAPHY OF PERIODICAL LITERATURE 493 defense of the mission of French colonial- ism, which has dedicated itself to perform the twofold duty of civilization: "to better the physical condition of the local popula- tions and to educate them." 5145 GUY, M. VIGNE. "Nationalism in French North Africa." Contemp. Rev. I040 (Ag '52) 84-7. The nationalist leaders are jealous of each other and unable to form a national front, even though they agree in disparaging the contribution of the French and in seeking their ouster. 5I46 EL-HASHIMI, SAYED. "Afghanistan re- visited." Contemp. Rev. 1039 (JI '52) 21-4. The author deems Afghanistan the hap- piest, least divided Asiatic country he has ever seen. And it is "taking to Western ways with a grace which other nations might well emulate." 5147 HUREWITZ, J. C. "Unity and disunity in the Middle East." Internat. Conciliation (My '52) I97-250. The author of this in- teresting study believes that the two main objectives of the West are at cross pur- poses. The strategic need for stability, which tends to freeze present political regimes, conflicts with economic and tech- nical development programs, which aim ultimately at changing the political, eco- nomic, and social structure. 5I48 HYSLOP, JOHN. "The Sudan." Contemp. Rev. I040 (Ag '52) 68-74. The author is convinced that the British, for a variety of reasons, will keep their promise to per- mit no change in the status of the Sudan without the consent of the Sudanese. 5I49 LEWIS, NORMAN N. "The Isma'ilis of Syria today." Royal Cent. Asian J. 39 (Ja '52) 69-77. A brief history and description of the Isma'ili community of Salamiyya in Syria. 5I50 LISLE, B. ORCHARD.

"Religious op- position to nationalism in the Middle East." Internat. Aff. (London) 28 (JI '52) 344- 59. Only in Turkey and Israel has anti- religious nationalism been powerful enough to arouse the resistance of religious groups, the Tijanis and the Jerusalem Guardians of the City, respectively. The author cites interesting details of these two organiza- tions and a plausible explanation for the absence of similar movements in Iran and the Arab world. 5I53 MONTAGNE, ROBERT. "Modern nations and Islam." For Aff. 30 (JI '52) 580-92. The evolution of the Arab world into modern states is impeded by the persistence of tradition, the "intoxication of racial and religious solidarity," and the predilection for terrorism made more dangerous by the alliance with communism. 5I54 NEEMAN, ZVI. "The U.N. General As- sembly's Palestine resolution and the Arab position." (in Hebrew, English summary) Hamizrah Hehadash (Jerusalem) 3 (Spring '52) 2I7-32.

"On the problem of the back- wardness of the East outside Russia at the beginning of modern times." (in Rus- sian) Foprosy Ist. (Moscow) 6 (i95i) 75-89. Although liberally peppered with references to Marx and Stalin, the article has some value for its broad sociological approach. 5156 SPANN, ROBERT E. "Calm settles over Middle East." World Oil 135 (Ag '52) 292, 294. 5157 STEVENS, GEORGIANA G. "Arab ref- ugees: 1948-I952." Middle East J. 6 (Sum- mer '52) 281-98. Concludes that there can be no short-term solution to the problem because until the Arab states "become economically and socially stronger . . . it will be both practically and psychologically impossible for them to liquidate the ref- ugee problem." Table and map of refugee distribution. 5I58 TADMOR, GIDEON. "The Syrian scene." Middle East. 4ff. 3 (Ap '52) I06-13. An interpretative review of Syrian history since I949. Delineates Shishakly's foreign policy, his internal supporters and enemies. 5159 TWEEDY, OWEN. "The Arab refugees." Internat. Jff. 28 (Jl '52) 338-43. On the basis of an on-the-spot investigation, the author suggests the contributions that all the interested parties should make to obtain peace between the Arabs and Israelis and thus solve the dangerous refugee problem. 5i6o ZIADEH, NICOLA. "Tunis and Libya." (in Arabic) al-A bhath (Beirut) 4 (D 'i1) 400-37. Compilation of general data; anal- ysis of the constitution of the new state of Libya.

The influence of labor in French North Africa will not only affect events there, but will also ex- tend to other Islamic countries. Tunisian trade unions are affiliated with the Inter- national Confederation of Free Trade Unions and thus enjoy the support of labor in other countries. This combined with widespread backing from all classes of the population gives the Tunisian nationalist movement tremendous power. 5170 BAER, GAVRIEL. "Land tenure in Trans- jordan." (in Hebrew, English summary) Hamizrah Hehadash 3 (Spring '52) 233-41. Important evaluation of the official sta- tistics for 1950 which reveal inter alia that the average family holding is only 40 dunams, that there exists a good propor- tion of large estates, and that 30%-40% of the villagers are landless. 5171 CRAIG-MARTIN, PAUL F. "Cotton and the Middle East." Middle East J. 6 (Summer '52) 299-31I4. Cotton production in the Middle East can be converted from a boom time crop to an integral part of the area's economy, but this will require coordinated attention to the whole process from plant- ing to marketing, and cooperation among producer, processor, merchant, and gov- ernment. 5172 DOWSON, V. H. W. "To Arabia in search of date-palm offshoots." Royal Cent. Asian J. 39 (Ja '52) 45-56. Perceptive description of Saudi Arabia, with date culture in Hasa.

N. "Agrarian problems of the Middle East." Middle East. Aff. 3 (Je '52) I65-70. Even more important than increas- ing agricultural production through utili- zation of neglected lands and introduction of modern techniques is the need of addi- tional people throughout most of the region. A fresh analysis, with some original in- sights. 5I8o SARC, OMER CELAL. "Growth of the Turkish rural population." Middle East. Aff. 3 (Mr '52) 7I-80. Discusses the effects of this growth on agriculture and certain phases of urbanization. 5181 SARC, OMER CELAL. "International Bank report on Turkey." Middle East. J. 6 (Summer '52) 336-40. Believes that the report does not provide sufficiently for direct productive investments, giving too much weight to investments which will bring returns only in the long run. 5I[82 SINGER, H. W.

"The conception of faith in the Koran." Oriens 4, no. i (1951) 1-20.

The Qur'anic use of the word shows it to mean, first of all, "to count true," being thus in keeping with the corresponding conceptions in Judaism and Oriental Christianity. 5I98 SIRAJ, AL-DIN, AHMAD.
