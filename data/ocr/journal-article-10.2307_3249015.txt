<plain_text><page sequence="1">ALEXANDER C. SOPER REPRESENTATIONS OF FAMOUS IMAGES AT TUN-HUANG O ne of the most remarkable of the finds made by Sir Aurel Stein at the Tun-huang cave shrines, the greatly damaged "remains of large silk painting with Chinese inscriptions, representing a series of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas" (fig. i), has achieved a curiously one-sided celebrityI. Restorers found it convenient to separate the painting into two halves. When the Stein objects were divided between Great Britain and India, the larger and more coherent left-hand portion was assigned to New Delhi, and so is housed today in the National Museum there. Its appearance has been long familiar through a good reproduction in Stein's album The Thousand Buddhas2. A series of scholars, Petrucci3, Stein, Waley4, and Rowlands, have studied the figures and the partially preserved inscriptions, and have agreed that the group as a whole was "intended to reproduce sculptural images worshipped at various sacred sites of India6". Of the eleven icons of various sizes, shown singly or with attendants, and with various attributes, four have been identified from the start. As the painting now hangs in its recon- structed state, the most certain of these is the squatting figure at the upper left corner. This seems unmistakably to show Gautama at the moment of his Illumination at Bodh Gaya, still wearing the Bodhisattva dress with rich ornaments. His seat, the Vajrasana, is the natural rock; his downstretched right hand performs the unmistakable mudra of calling the Earth to witness. The extraordinary triple headdress -a snarling human face in the center with a boar's head in pro- file on either side-apparently symbolizes his victory over the demon hosts of Mara. The partly preserved inscription that accompanies the figure is for the most part a conventional eulogy; but in speaking of a "light-emitting auspicious image in the country of Magadha" it at least adds an appropriate location. The erect Buddha at bottom right, standing against a background of conventionalized rocks, is likely to be Sakyamuni preaching in his best-known mountain retreat, the Vulture Peak at Rajagrha. There are two other very similar representations of this iconographic type among the Stein acquisitions. In one of these, as Sir Aurel has pointed out, "identification is made absolutely certain by the figure of the vulture painted above the grotto". The third of Stein's original proposals concerns the standing Buddha at top center, whose I Sir M.A. Stein, Serindia, Oxford I92I, II, pp. 1024-26 and pl.LXX (ch. xxii.0023). 2 Stein, The Thousand Buddhas, London I92I, pp. 26--28 and pl.

Here he follows Foucher's lead in seeing the figure as a reference to the miraculous multiplication of Buddha-bodies performed by Sakyamuni at Sravasti. The fourth identification covers the standing Buddha at the right end of the middle tier. The crucial detail is a miniature scene crowded into the apex of the aureole: a tiny, squatting Buddha with two human or divine attendants and two crouching deer. With this hint Stein proposed that the large figure below was intended as a reference to the First Sermon. The picture has in fact a cartouche, wrongly mounted in the bottom tier, which speaks of "the image in the Deer Park in the country of Varanasi in middle India". In addition Arthur Waley has suggested that the Bodhisattva at lower left, standing against another rocky background and identified as Avalokitesvara by a tiny Buddha in his crown, was meant as the image that was seen by the seventh century Chinese pilgrim Hsiian- tsang at Bodh Gaya, which stood "in a niche outside the triple gate of the monastery of the Bodhi Tree7". The small Buddha just above, who squats on a triple elephant-head throne, seemed to Waley to recall the "Buddha's triumph over the savage elephant-king at Rajagrha". Another of these small Buddhas of the middle tier he was able to identify as "a silver statue at Kapila- vastu" by reading fragments of the half-effaced inscription along-side8. Rowland, finally, has added a claim for the Bodhisattva richly garbed in something like the Gandharan fashion, who squats at the center of the panel. Here the key detail is presumably a dragon that coils around the throne; and so the figure "may be a replica of the image of the Buddha subduing the dragon of Nagaraharas". It seems, in other words, to be a reference to the legendary contest of powers which made the so-called Cave of the Buddha's Shadow near Hadda in Afghanistan a famous pilgrimage spot for centuries Io. During all this relatively brisk activity the right-hand portion of the scroll has gone almost unnoticed. Stein's original description of the fragments was abridged, rather than amplified, when Waley wrote his Tun-huang catalogue ten years laterII. No reproduction has ever been published, except of the small portion included at the top of Stein's photograph. Indeed, very few persons interested in Chinese painting or in Buddhist art can be aware that one of the silk panels in the British Museum's Stein collection contains a half dozen fragmentary figures which once belonged to the same painting as those in New Delhi. It is not hard to imagine why these scraps of silk have been prudently left alone for a half century. They furnish none of the clues that have been so useful in the left-hand portion. The figures have been cruelly mutilated, and the few remaining traces of writing are quite illegible (fig. 2). The one image which has been relatively well preserved, the Buddha standing with his right arm raised, "supporting red disk of Sun containing bird, two-legged, of phoenix type 2", can hardly have failed to catch the fascinated attention of every observer; but the iconographic 7 Op.cit., p. 27I. 8 Ibid., pp. 270, 269. 9 Op. cit., pp. II -I 2. 10 Soper, &lt;&lt;Aspects of Light Symbolism in Gandharan Sculpture)), Artibus Asiae, XII, I949, pp. 273-283, 3i4ff. 11 Waley, pp. 84, 95. 12 Stein, Serindia, II, p. I026c, pl. LXX. 35o</page><page sequence="3">riddle it poses must in the past have been insoluble (fig. 3). Today, on the other hand, sufficient peripheral information has been made available so that it is possible not only to attack the British Museum fragments with confidence, but also to find through them the probable expla- nation of the whole painting. The first step is now an easy one. A recent Chinese publication of the sculptures housed in the Shensi Provincial Museum at Hsi-an has revealed the presence there of a stele in T'ang style which might almost be called a duplicate of the Stein Buddha with the solar disk (fig. 4)I3. The pose of the body, the fall of the robe, the shape of the flaming halo, even the peculiar pendent loop of drapery under the right armpit, are the same. The one obvious difference is merely the re- sult of an enrichment of an otherwise identical idea. Where the Tun-huang painter symbolized the sun by the traditional Chinese bird (and the missing moon, one may imagine, by the hare or toad), the sculptor supplied a complete anthropomorphic statement in miniature. His two deities hold billowing scarves over their heads, in the fashion borrowed long before from Greco-Roman art. The upper, presumably Surya, is shown riding in a drastically conventionaliz- ed biga drawn by horses. In the lower disk the same function is performed for Candra by two swan-like birds. The inscription on the pedestal might be freely translated "the Buddha Sakya- muni's victory over heresy". From the stylistic standpoint the most striking feature of the stone at Hsi-an is its frank juxtaposition of Indian and Chinese elements. The sun and moon gods are entirely exotic, and doubtless derive from Central Asian or Indian ancestors. The Sakyamuni is just as unmistakably Chinese; it clearly belongs in the same highly sophisticated current as the silver Buddha of mid eighth century style in the headdress of the Fukukenjaku Kannon of the Hokkedo in Nara (fig. 5). With this composite character in mind, it is useful to turn back momentarily to the figures of the New Delhi portion of the Stein painting. They have always been explained as drawings derived from images of especial sanctity in India. There is of course no question that such records were made and transmitted. The familiar pilgrimage texts are explicit in this regard. The earliest great voyager, Fa-hsien, returning in 4I3 from India and Ceylon, brought with him "scriptures and images". The Northern Wei envoy Sung Yiin commissioned a craftsman in the Gandharan capital to make him a miniature replica of the Kanishka vihara, with the scenes that epitomized the four locally famous jtakas of Sakyamuni. The greatest pilgrim of all, Hsiian- tsang, brought back six statues in sandalwood, silver, and gold, copied from originals at famous pilgrimage sites. His contemporary, the T'ang ambassador Wang Hsuiian-ts'e, is known to have taken a Chinese artist in his entourage to India, doubtless to make as many on-the-spot draw- ings for record as possible. Our Stein painting, however, contains a number of major iconographic features which are not Indian at all. For example, the squatting Buddha-Bodhisattva at the center of the New Delhi panel has a flaming aureole surrounded by musician angels in flight, and topped by a small reliquary stupa: a combination whose only known source is the purely Chinese repertory of the sixth century Wei style. The same deity's throne is encircled by a creature which is not at all the semi-human and serpentine Nagaraja that would be proper to the Shadow Cave story 13 S eng Po- Shih-k'e Hsian-chi (A Selection from the Stone Sculptures Treasured in the Provincial Museum of Shansi), Peking I1957, pl. 37. 3 5</page><page sequence="4">as told in the West, but an authentic Chinese dragon. All but one of the other flaming aureoles of the large figures in the first and second tiers similarly follow Chinese designs. The notable exception surrounds the standing Buddha at top center, and this, though not Chinese in style, is certainly not Indian either. As has been observed ever since the painting's discovery, it is instead a close cousin to the scheme which Stein found emphasized among the standing clay Buddhas at the Central Asian site of Rawak, near Khotan 4. The standing Bodhisattva at lower left, which Waley-and later Rowland-have wished to identify with an Avalokitesvara statue at Bodh Gaya, wears a dhoti that is gathered around the hips like a short apron, and that flares coquettishly to left and right below. Such a fashion, again, is unmatched in Indian sculpture, but is quite in keeping with T'ang practise around the beginning of the eighth century. In addition the New Delhi painting is filled with minor icono- graphic peculiarities that so far as I know are impossible to explain by Indian practise: strange thrones, bizarre headgear, a halo with two crescent moons. One must conclude either that the Tun-huang painter had a very incomplete knowledge of the Indian originals he was asked to reproduce, and filled in many details from his own local tradition, or purely at random; or else that the images shown were not intended to be exclusively Indian at all, and were in fact faith- fully recorded. That the latter explanation is the correct one is argued by evidence that seems to me conclusive. The careful notes taken by Pelliot at Tun-huang reveal the presence in the ceiling decorations of six late caves-his numbers 64, 8i, 84, Ioz02, Io6, and II9-of painted groups of famous images identified by titles. In addition at least two of the Chinese manuscripts recovered by Stein, his numbers 5 65 9 and 211 3, the latter containing a date of A. D. 896, cover the same theme in writing alone, as image lists. The groupings are not identical throughout, but a large number of images recur frequently and are referred to in a standard phraseology. I must confess parenthetically that my control over this material is a good deal less than ideal. My own notes were taken in 1954 from a handwritten copy of the Pelliot notebook at the Musee Guimet, without any idea of using them for the present purpose. There are many gaps, due to my misunderstandings or to PeUiot's own failure to catch a half obliterated or scribbled char- acter. In the two detailed inventories of the Tun-huang caves that have been published by Chinese resident at the site, those of Shih Yai and Hsieh Chih-liu, the presence of only one group, that of Cave 8i, has been noted (by Hsieh alone) and its tituli printed15. The others were presumably so inaccessible or so badly effaced that their presence was overlooked. Pelliot's notes are at this time being methodically put in order for publication by a Chinese scholar in poor health in Paris. I have not wished to burden him with lengthy questions about material which he has probably not yet fully mastered. The two manuscripts have never been published or edited in any way, and their phraseology and script are not easy to decipher. Under these circumstances my remarks will be made with more than a little timidity. One can say, first of all, with confidence that the place names involved are chiefly the familiar Indian ones, though there is an interesting sprinkling of Chinese holy sites closer to hand in the Kansu area. It is clear, however, that a third region, Khotan, was of still greater importance. 14 E.g. by Rowland, p. I I.

Sometimes even the name of the Kho- tanese host temple is recorded. This remarkable insistence presumably reflects the political situation of Tun-huang in the tenth century, when communications with both central China and India were precarious or impossible, and Khotan was the nearest friendly power with a high standing in the Buddhist world. One should remember that a king of Khotan, as brother-in-law of the Tun-huang potentate Ts'ao I-chin, is shown painted as a donor of the big cave 74I6. Another Khotanese royal inscription has been found in cave 22 at the neighboring site of Wan-fo-hsia I7. At Khotan, conversely, the unending pressure of Arab hostility on the west must have encouraged an already strong local tendency to summon divine protectors. Striking corrobora- tion of the Tun-huang evidence is furnished by legendary histories preserved in the Tibetan Buddhist canon, which must have been composed at Khotan and which show the same fervent reliance on the guardianship of Buddha images. The lists of statues which were said to have flown from India to take up residence in temples of the Khotanese kingdom, run strikingly close to those found written in Chinese at Tun-huang 18. It may be noted in passing that the basic idea of transfer by flight was already in existence in the Khotanese sites visited at the mid seventh century by Hsiian-tsang. He names three statues that had come to their final homes by this miraculous avenue. In only of these cases, however, that of the wonder-working colossus at P'i-mo, was a famous origin claimed: it was said to be the very first of all images of Sakyamuni, made during his lifetime by order of King Udayana of Kausambi. One of the other two was said to have flown from Kashmir; the third came merely from the rival Central Asian city of Kucha 19. The extravagant claims made later, which implied a wholesale evacuation of Indian sites, could only have been supported in an age of isolation, when travellers with first-hand information came rarely or not at all. The groups of tutelary deities which have been preserved at Tun-huang are well worth studying thoroughly for their own sake, and for the light that they throw on the later develop- ment of Buddhist worship in Central Asia. For the present purpose it is sufficient to point out that they seem to account for the majority of the figures shown in the Stein painting. There can be no question, to begin with, that the so-called Vulture Peak Buddha of the New Delhi portion could correspond perfectly to the title given in identical form in at least three of the caves (numbers 8i, 84, and I02) and in both manuscripts: "The true image of Sakyamuni Buddha, which flew from Rajagrha through the air and came to the land of Khotan to dwell at the Lake's-eye Temple." This statue, incidentally, is the most clearly referred to of all those named in the Tibetan texts. The lake mentioned is there said to have covered the whole Khotan area in antiquity, and to have been still in existence when Sakyamuni paid a miraculous visit to the region to meditate and preach. At a climatic point in his sermon, 363 lamp-lit lotuses rose out of the water to circle 16 Hsieh no. 42, THI no. 98.

The Buddha of the First Preaching, just above in the New Delhi painting, is referred to in the tituli of caves 81 and 84 as "the auspicious image of the Deer Park Precinct at Varanasi in Central India": the phraseology used being virtually identical with that found in the painting's inscription. Again, the Buddha of Bodh Gaya, at the upper left, is present in the cave 81 list as "the auspicious image of the Maha Bodhi Temple in Central India". Caves 81 and 84 refer to "the Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara on Mount Potalaka, whose auspi- cious image brings salvation by the rays it emits". The rocky setting given the Avalokitesvara at the lower left corner of the Stein painting (fig. I) suits perfectly this fabulous island home. For the Bodhisattva at Bodh Gaya, suggested by Arthur Waley, it would have no meaning. Two other icons in the New Delhi portion may be at least tentatively explained by the written evidence. Rowland's "Nagarahara Buddha" at the center, with a dragon encircling its base, is perhaps the statue cryptically referred to in three caves, 81, 84, and I06, and in one of the manuscripts. There the phrase runs: "The Shadow Image from the western side of Chang-yeh R f; Prefecture, from the time of the Yiieh-chih king of old." The original Shadow Image was an apparition on the wall of a sacred grotto in southeast Afghanistan. We know that it was copied as early as the outset of the fifth century in central China by order of the great abbot Hui-yuan. The Tun-huang evidence suggests that another imitation was made in Chang-yeh Prefecture in Western IKansu. If we may judge from the look of the aureole in the Stein painting, the date is likely to have been the second quarter of the sixth century. Finally, the resemblance of the standing Buddha at top center to the many fragmentary statues found at Rawak, in the Khotan neighborhood, makes it plausible that this icon was intended to represent one of the several specifically Ihotanese Buddhas named in the texts: probably the colossal sandalwood figure at the pilgrimage site of P'i-mo, which must have been roughly contemporary with the Rawak sculptures. The mention of the P'i-mo Buddha in the titulus of cave I02 speaks of its as having flown to Khotan from the land of Kausambi; as we have seen, the same legend is mentioned in connection with the site by Hsuan-tsang. Turning to the British Museum fragments, we find what is surely a reference to the single well preserved figure (fig. 3) in the cryptic phrase found in three tituli (caves 81, 84, 106) and the shorter manuscript: "Image shown visiting [or pointing to; the verb is chih T] the sun and moon." The phrase used apparently recalls an iconographical oddity mentioned in the narrative portion of the Vinaya of the Mulasarvastivadin sect (and almost nowhere else). There both the Sanskrit and Chinese versions agree that when Sakyamuni won his sudden increase in super- natural powers after the defeat of Mara, he "sat cross-legged in the air as if on the ground, or soared through the sky like some bird. The sun and moon are mighty powers, yet he raised his hands and stroked their faces2,..." 20 Thomas, Tibetan Literary Texts, pp. 7ff. 21 The Chinese version translated in the 8th century by I-ching is accessible in the Japanese Tripitaka DaiZokyo, XXIV, 362</page><page sequence="15">If this explanation is valid, the inscription on the T'ang relief from Hsi-an (fig.4), "the Buddha Sakyamuni's victory over heresy", is likely to be in error. Its writing is larger and somewhat more careless than is usual on a T'ang stele, and so may have been added at a later period, when the true meaning had been forgotten. Why this extremely rare theme should have been so popular at Tun-huang, and should have been found also at the T'ang capital in virtually identical form, I cannot at this time explain. One of the most severely damaged portions of the British Museum panel, which survives only as a pair of standing figures with a ladder (fig. 6) seems explainable by two of the tituli and both manuscripts. What is involved is the story of a robber who coveted the jewel on the forehead of a Buddha image in central India. Though the writing is in every case difficult to decipher, all accounts agree that the statue out of pity bent over to offer the jewel as a present. In the lengthiest versions, those of cave Ioz02 and the longer manuscript, the details mentioned feature a ladder which the robber made to reach the statue's forehead, but which proved always to be too short, no matter how much he added to its height between one attempt and the next. A story of the same sort, though lacking the ladder, is told of a holy place in Ceylon by Hsiian- tsang22. The pair of standing Buddhas now mounted two groups to the left of the robber story (fig. 7) doubtless corresponds to the "two Buddhas side by side" who are present among the figures painted in cave 84-unfortunately without any titulus to explain their meaning. Finally a standing Buddha in the top tier (fig. 8), shown with an extraordinarily voluminous, toga-like robe whose weight is emphasized by its fall between his outstretched arms, may be one of the Buddhas described in the longer manuscript as having flown from India to Khotan with his ka.saya, or cassock, held in his hands. This process of interpretation has accounted for eleven of the nineteen or so subjects in the two portions of the Stein painting. I say "nineteen or so" because the British Museum segment has been rather arbitrarily and carelessly mounted, bringing together scraps of silk that in some cases seem to have no proper connection with each other. If a more careful reconstruction were carried out, other subjects which are now concealed might emerge. There is in the bottom row a hand holding a miniature stupa which as presently mounted seems to belong to a Buddha (fig. 9). No such attribute has so far as I know ever been assigned to a Buddha figure, however; normally the object would denote a Vaisravana, the King of the North. The latter, as the oldest guardian over Khotan, should certainly be present in the group; he is in fact named in three of the cave tituli. Perhaps it is his trident that one sees just to the left of the reliquary. A second look will show that both attributes are held by bare arms wearing identical jewelled bracelets: a costume detail quite proper to a Lokapala. The curious fact should be noticed that the majority of the images on which most sources agree are Hinayana in type: figures of Sakyamuni at various moments in his life, the two most recent of the Buddhas of the past, and Maitreya. Why this should have been so at two Buddhist as no. I450; the passage occurs on p. 123, c. The Sanskrit is quoted by G.Tucci in "The Tibetan 'White-sun-moon' and Cognate Deities", East and West, n.s.XIV, 3-4, I963, p. 137, n. 3. That the story is an old one is demonstrated by its occurrence in the biography translated in A.D. 197 under the title Hsiu-hsing Pen-chi Ching: Dai no. 184, p.47I, b. On the other hand its rarity is demonstrated by the fact that it is completely lacking in the many more familiar biographies analysed by E. Tuneld, Recherches sur la valeur des traditions bouddhiques palie et non palie Lund, I 9 I 5. 22 Beal, II, pp.249-250; Watters, II, p. 236. 363</page><page sequence="16">centers so strongly Mahayanist as Khotan and Tun-huang, is a difficult problem to resolve. Very likely the explanation lies in the desire to maintain a strong traditional link with India and its ancient pilgrimage cities. There, as we know from the testimony of Hsiian-tsang, almost all famous statues at the mid seventh century were still of the same, simple sort, tied to the Hina- yana past. The very images that were normally most popular in the late art of Tun-huang, the Thousand-armed form of Avalokitesvara, the paired Manjusri and Samantabhadra on their animal vehicles, and Ksitigarbha, are absent. The two most noticeable Mahayana exceptions are specifically located Avalokitesvara figures, one in the kingdom of Magadha, the other on the island of Potalaka. This last was of course mythical, but must have been imagined as a real island site, located somewhere off the south Indian coast. Thus both of these deities were thought of as much closer to the human world and more accessible through pilgrimage than a being like the Thousand-armed Avalokitesvara, who in a sense was both everywhere and nowhere. As survivals of Hinayana beliefs, at the same time, it is interesting to see that the group of deities have very little to do with the codified stage of iconography found in the varying con- cepts of the eight moments of Sakyamuni's life, as taught in India or the Far East. There is room for such apparently trivial references as those to the image and the robber, or to the painted figure in Gandhara described by Hsuiian-tsang, which was found miraculously divided above the waist into two bodies, so as to carry out the pious wishes of two donors23. There are no mentions of the birth or to the acts preceding it; only one to the descent of the jewelled stair from Heaven; and none to the entry into Nirvana. Of the two most specifically Indian events there is certainly no monkey's offering, and perhaps no subjugation of the elephant; Waley's proposed identification of the latter is questionable. There is no certain reference in the texts or proof in the pictures of Foucher's great theme, the miracle at Sravasti. The latter city is named as one whose Sakyamuni image did indeed fly to Khotan; but the same statement is made also about the images of the two Buddhas of the Past, Vipasyin and Kasyapa. Any listener who has heard these claims of Khotanese influence will naturally expect to be shown corroborative stylistic or iconographic evidence from the Buddhist art of the Khotan region. So far as I know, none at present exists. The few, badly ruined Buddhist sites uncovered by Aurel Stein, places like Rawak, Endere, and Dandan Uiluk, are a good deal earlier, are strongly Mahayanist in character, and offer no useful points of contact with our Tun-huang material. If the mainland Chinese were as interested in the archaeology of Turkestan as they are in that of China proper, one might look forward to revelations in the future. At the present there are no such indications, and so the problem must remain in the realm of conjecture. 23 In both mss. and in all caves except no. OZ102. 364</page></plain_text>
