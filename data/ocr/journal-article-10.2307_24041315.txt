<plain_text><page sequence="1">Some Relationships Between Landscape Science and Landscape Art in Britain at the Turn of the 18th Century Frank F. Cunningham" Geographers are accustomed to suppose that the only major concept which has emerged from their discipline is en vironmental determinism, and that even this has proved false. In fact, more than a century earlier the earth scientists (physi cal geographers if you will) had made fundamental contribu tions to the ascendancy of rationalism, which intellectually threatened religion and scientifically made possible the tech nological revolution to which we are heirs. Landscape Science That geological speculations from the late eighteenth century onwards provided the expertise for the accelerating extraction of minerals (especially coal and iron, those twin muscles of the Industrial Revolution) is clear enough. Perhaps more fundamental, because it gave sanction to the rape of the earth which has ensued, geological speculations inevitably cast doubt on the most hallowed beliefs and traditions of Christi anity, which had been the enduring pillars of European society for the previous 1,500 years. The mechanistic explanation of the processes shaping the earth's surface, the concept of self regulating interactions between constructive, tectonic forces from the earth's interior and climatically induced, destructive * Frank F.

This new interpretation of the physical world at once called in question whether God interfered at all in worldly aifairs. Cer tainly it seemed impossible that physical catastrophes were Divinely arranged for humanity's chastisement. The dual sig nificance of the Noachian Deluge was at once challenged, for not only had the Deluge been held to explain the main relief features of the earth's surface, but that surface had been inter preted as a ruin, a physical counterpart to the Fall of Man. Indeed the new geologists, led by James Hutton (1726 1797), "the Founder of Modern Geology,"1 denied catastrophist explanations altogether, insisting that substantially the same forces which can now be seen operating at the earth's surface have operated in the past. To accommodate all the palpable changes in the earth's surface without catastrophes required a vast interval of time, inconceivably longer than the orthodox eighteenth-century religious view which held that the earth had been created in 4004 B. C. Again this new thesis was inimical to Christian teachings. If the earth were so old, very much older than Man, was it feasible that God had a special interest in humanity? Although the influence of the earth sciences was of greatest consequences in firstly altering man's view of his place in the universe (suggesting to him that he rather than God was in charge of its day-to-day business) and secondly in providing humanity with the new technologies of steam power and metal smelting on an unprecedented scale, it is also important to note their effect upon the aesthetic interpretations of man in the landscape. 1 Facsimiles of Hutton's geological writings are available in George W. White, ed., Contributions to the History of Geology, Volume 5, James Hutton's System of the Earth 1785; Theory of the Earth 1788; Observa tions on Granite 1794; together with Play fair's Biography of Hutton (Hafner, 1973).

Just as Hutton was the first of a succession of British geologists who dominated their science for one hundred years, so Turner and Constable, young men when Hutton died, were the first and perhaps the last British artists to command international status. The obvious relationships between landscape science and the Industrial Revolution have been touched on. The relationships between landscape science and landscape art are less patent but very important. At the turn of the eighteenth century the British society, which its artists might be expected to mirror, was one of extra ordinary complexity and subject to a host of conflicting tensions. The British landscape had itself only recently been transformed by the conventions of the great landowners, and this had converted at least the more amenable parts of the country to an ordered and contrived pattern of estates. How ever, this revolution had quickly made a visual appeal which British artists and through them the public have since cherished as closely as if their man-made landscape were indeed an original Eden. At the same time the discordant and seemingly haphazard beginnings of industrialisation had begun their visible takeover. The Literary Reaction Unlike most of their political and commercial contempo raries, British artists and men of letters (there were no musi cians worth remembering, and this at a time when Mozart, Haydn, and Beethoven were composing) were generally pes simistic Romantics. It was typical in Britain that literary men first set the stage. Gray and Goldsmith were nostalgic about</page><page sequence="4">58 ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC COAST GEOGRAPHERS rural England before the middle of the eighteenth century. Blake deplored the loss of religion and of imagination to rationalism and science, and had deep forebodings about the onset of the industrial society as early as 1800. It is significant that Shelley not only epitomised resistance to authority and custom in his ideals, his politics, and personal life, but proposed in his masterpiece "Prometheus Unbound" that mankind will be free when it gives up allegiance to an anthropomorphic God and embraces Nature. Byron discerned through his own misan thropy a ruthless Nature impervious to man's most heroic efforts. The Artistic Reaction The painters were somewhat more subservient. Only gradually did the Byronic disillusionment with mankind and the praise of nature show itself amongst them. The new geology offered them on the one hand an enhanced knowledge and understanding of the operations of nature, and on the other a modest or even pessimistic evaluation of humanity. They were prompted to observe the world as closely as did naturalists, but increasingly saw man as divorced from nature. These changes in taste and preference clearly related to the challenge which landscape science offered to religion. The earth scientists were destroying the confidence in the idea that the earth as the home of man was of special concern to God. New knowl edge was gained at the expense of old faith. The British artists reacted variously to these threats from science except that, for most, landscape became the key issue. For the first time in all art history, interpretation of the land scape and man's relation to it became the principal concern of leading artists, and the popularity of some of them indicates a wider public acceptance of the significance of their subject. To Reynolds, the arbiter of taste in Britain immediately before the landscape "school," it was unthinkable that landscape art could be important and he considered its mere representation to be contemptible. Of course, his immediate successors were</page><page sequence="5">YEARBOOK • VOLUME 37 • 1975 59 by no means influenced only by the new geology, but its effects are clearly felt. Constable had a somewhat unique response, which in essence was to use the new science in order to understand nature better. He was an ardent geologist,2 and made endless studies of trees, clouds, and the minutia of nature. Constable thought of himself as merely a "natural" painter and would have been condemned by Reynolds for mere representation, but he painted better than he knew and was subject to many other influences. That he was an escapist is clear enough. He painted and repainted a very elegant area of rural England, and it is difficult to realise that he was contemporary with Blake's Satanic Mills, with Peterloo as well as Waterloo. None theless he most clearly represents a new view of landscape, landscape for its own sake, which was best being expressed by Wordsworth. To Constable as to Wordsworth there was a morality in the contemplation of nature which required no further message. Samuel Palmer and John Martin were outstanding repre sentatives among those artists who passionately denied the mechanistic, ungodly interpretation which science was posing for landscape. Palmer, whose studies reveal a literal draftsman ship comparable to Constable's, deliberately distorts nature in his famous Shoreham paintings to achieve a mystic, rev erential, pointedly nonscientific effect.3 Martin's religious quarrel with mechanistic explanation might appear inconsistent with his interest in applied science, but he most exactly touched a sensitive cord among the public at large which feared not only that there was something irreverent about denying God's continuous concern about the earth and mankind, but that He might react to such impiety. Martin's spectacular landscapes abound in portrayals of a vengeful God chastising sinful hu 2 R. B. Beckett, John Constable's Correspondence, in 6 vols., 1962 1968 3 A. H.

Above all others he is the artist who asserts the reality and indeed the purpose of cataclysms.4 J. M. W. Turner5 is the most interesting of all the British school of landscape painters, not only because his works em brace so many of the tendencies of his times, but also because his focus, unlike that of Constable, changed remarkably through his long and uniquely productive career. This uni versality arose not only from his talents but also from deliberate design, for he set out purposefully to paint in as many of the genres which were then appreciated as his talents would allow. He avoided portraiture, but tackled almost everything else: history painting because it was the most prestigious; archi tectural subjects; man in the landscape; landscapes, especially mountainous ones, without man; and, above all, sea and sky and light. He sought to outdo Van de Velde,6 the most famous 4 John Martin first fully revealed his theatrical and cataclysmic style in history painting (which made him for a time second only to Turner in fame) in his Joshua Commanding the Sun to Stand Still (1816). Though some of his spectacular paintings were difficult to sell, they at tracted unprecedented numbers of viewers, and the mezzotints Martin produced of them were popular and lucrative. Although his fame rested on sensational renderings of catastrophes, particularly from Biblical sources, Martin was closely interested in Brunei's railway innovations and he also designed a sewage system for the City of London. See Mary L. Pendered, John Martin, Painter, 1924, and T. Balston, John Martin, 1947. 5 J. M. W. Turner's art and life have prompted a vast literature, but there has been little consensus, except as to his undoubted significance, either during his lifetime or since. The best known sources about his life are A. H. Thorn bury's unreliable but indispensable Life of J. M. W. Turner, 1862, and A. J. Finberg's Life of J. M. W. Turner, 1939. Far more penetrating than either is Jack Lindsay's Turner, His Life and Work, 1966. Evaluations of Turner's art are legion and conflicting. John Rothen stein (in numerous works) probably has done most to crystallize modern opinion. Despite its enormous influence as art criticism, John Ruskin's Modern Painters failed in its intended vindication of Turner, in the judgment of both Turner and Ruskin (ultimately). "Willem van de Velde II (1633-1707), "the father of English marine painting," epitomises the debt which British painters owed the seventeenth century Dutch School. Van de Velde, after establishing a reputation as a painter of Dutch naval history, came in 1672 with his father to the Court of Charles II. Van de Velde II was later employed</page><page sequence="7">YEARBOOK • VOLUME 37 • 1975 61 painter of seascape; to outdo Canaletto in his Venetian work; and to outdo Girtin, the friend of his youth, in water colour. His 1807 Thames pleinair sketches are as breezy and spon taneous as anything Constable produced; he sought even to surpass the immortal Claude, an obsession he carried beyond the grave.7 Having sampled the field, Turner still had enough energy and imagination to venture beyond all others in his anticipa tion of Impressionism and, at the last, of Expressionism. But to all of these genres he brought not only vast talent but his deep pessimism and excessive touch. No other artist has so reveled in storm and avalanche, shipwreck and fire, death and disaster. Like Martin, Turner was by temperament disposed to Catas trophism, but in his case this choice does not seem to spring from moral indignation at mechanistic explanation. In fact he was well informed about those aspects of science which might affect his craft. So he bought the first two volumes of the Transactions of the Geological Society (1811 and 1814), which abound in examples of the Werner/Hutton controversy, and also a translation of Goethe's work on optics (Turner's annotations indicate a strong disagreement with Goethe on many points). Summary In attempting a summary of the influence of the geological revolution at the turn of the eighteenth century on contempo by James II. His work was highly regarded in England, bought by many collectors, and copied by artists and students. Turner is supposed to have spoken of him always in deferential terms. 7 Between 1806 and 1819 Turner produced his Liber-Studiorum, a collection of mezzotint prints intended to range the gamut of landscape art. Never fully successful, the project was abandoned when 71 of the intended 101 plates had appeared. The Liber was prompted partly by adverse criticism of Turner from as early as 1803; it was also directed at Claude's Liber Veritatis, to which it posed an unfair comparison, since Claude's collection was merely a private reminder of his works. Turner left his Dido Building Carthage and Sun Rising in a Mist to the National Gallery on condition they were hung between Claude's Seaport and Mill.</page><page sequence="8">62 ASSOCIATION OF PACIFIC COAST GEOGRAPHERS raneous and subsequent art, there are some clear pointers. Landscape art, and this for the first time, becomes the most important and most generally practised form of pictorial art. With this interest in landscape there is a progressive and re lated decline in the attention given to the representation of people, who are reduced in relative scale, may be only adjuncts of the composition, or even omitted altogether. Unmistakably the artist is seeing Man as distinct from his environment and alien to the rest of nature, and his patrons and viewers come to agree with him. This separation between man and environment poses sev eral variations. The assumption that man dominates all else led to the progressive, supposedly rational ethos which was the backbone of the competitive Victorian society. The first generation of nineteenth century British artists, as we have suggested from representative examples, seldom supported this view. Alternatively, one could accept that in the separation of man from environment, humanity became weakened and nature dominant, the replacement of God by Nature. This dominance might be benevolent and was so construed by Con stable (and by Wordsworth), but in the early nineteenth century was more often interpreted as a superhuman Nature either disinterested in us or even antagonistic to humanity. It is not difficult to see a displaced and wrathful God in this Byronic stance, a God displaced all intentionally by earth scientists such as James Hutton. Again, the John Martins reject the schism between man and God, and warn that, in Old Testament fashion, God will punish unbelievers. This latter opinion appears to have been widespread amongst the less "enlightened" of the British public at the beginning of the eighteenth cenutry.</page></plain_text>
