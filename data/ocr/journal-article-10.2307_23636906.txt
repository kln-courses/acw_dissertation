<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Corporations as Criminals. Edited by E. Hochstedler. [Beverly Hills: Sage. 1984. 168 pp. £7-95 paperback.] A version of economists' cobweb theorem may be observed in criminology. A particular conception of a social problem arises, theorising and research goes underway, but by the time that the new analyses emerge in print, "real life" has moved on to a different set of official social definitions. This book is a case in point. White-collar crime was a useful stick with which to beat conservatives like James Q. Wilson who argued that street crime was the only significant form of crime. Fighting it was also a source of kudos for ambitious lawyers and politicians who wished to show their skill at tackling the powerful. Major amounts of F.B.I, and regulatory resources were devoted to combating this supposedly new crime problem. Now—at some cost to their "street cred"—some on the Left are arguing that street crime is indeed very socially significant, and they were wrong to focus simply on crimes of the powerful (Lea and Young, 1984). Meanwhile, though commercial fraud continues to be a major problem in the public eye (though at least in Britain, this is not matched by policing resources), business deregulation has become vogue for Western conservative governments. The white-collar crime literature may be burgeoning, and law school journals may be full of articles on corporate criminal liability, but with the exception of massive human tragedies caused by toxic waste, does anyone in power much care anymore? Unlike many books that emerge from conference papers, this one is both thematically coherent and of a high general standard. Kramer commences with a clear and useful overview of that hardy criminological perennial: the development of the idea of corporate crime. There are then three essays which discuss corporate criminal liability. Non-specialists may find useful Parisi's short review of the theoretical justification for imposing such liability. More penetrating is Fisse's examination of the issues surrounding the dual criminal liability of individuals and corporations for corporate crime. However, I remain unconvinced by the anthropomorphic argument that corporations are morally blameworthy indepen dent of their agents. The fact that the corporation benefits from the crime and the pragmatic difficulties of assigning individual responsibility seem to me to be the strongest justifications for imposing corporate liability. Finally, Frank provides an excellent study of the interplay between legal principle and pressure-group politics in the enactment of health and safety legislation. The book ends with three interesting case studies. Cullen et al. use interviews with the prosecutor as well as published sources to illuminate the social context as well as the technicalities of the much-discussed and ill-starred prosecution of Ford for the exploding Pinto. The nursing-home fraud examined by Schudson et al. shows how a successful prosecution (of a less powerful adversary) can be mounted, and the Appendix contains a nice example of arguments relating to sentencing of individual commercial offenders. Finally, Lynxwiler etal. analyse the determinants of regulatory fines on mineowners, concluding that, although offence impact and offender culpability are the primary determinants of sanctions, a small indepen dent contribution is made by corporate size. Their otherwise subtle interpretation places undue stress on the role of power in enabling large corporations to escape more lightly, for it seems more plausible to me that greater fines are imposed on 291</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS the smaller "rogue" companies because they are believed to be susceptible only to formal penalties, whilst the larger ones are expected to respond more reasonably and bureaucratically to the fact of sanctions. If so, then it is less corporate power than corporate technocracy that influences the level of sanctions. From a retributivist viewpoint, this may be unfair, but from a welfare or utilitarian perspective, unless fines are increased (inequitably) to the point where they deter, the policy may be perfectly rational. However, I remain troubled by some of the arguments that are used in this book and in the white-collar crime literature generally. Kramer defines the problematic of corporate crime (p. 18) as "criminal acts (of omission or commission) which are the result of deliberate decision making (or culpable negligence) by persons who occupy structural positions within the organizations as corporate executives or managers. These decisions are organisational in that they are organisationally based—made in accordance with the operative goals (primarily corporate profit), standard operating procedures, and cultural norms of the organisation—and are intended to benefit the corporation itself." Unfortunately, however, this leaves a gap between it and the more self-interested rip-offs that fall into the other white-collar category of occupational crime. What about acts performed—often by subsidiaries—for perceived corporate benefit that violate standard operating procedures (see Braithwaite, 1983, for examples)? And how are we to define in practice what is meant by "culpable negligence"? Radical criminologists' conceptions of what constitutes "culpable negligence" (and data based on those conceptions which receive legitimacy from frequent repetition) do not necessarily correspond to general-public, still less to court-based conceptions. It is one thing to show that the public regards the wilful manufacture of dangerous automobiles as being extremely serious. It is another (as Cullen et al. demonstrate) to prove to jurors in court that the Pinto was one such case. Should we substitute our own views about Ford's culpability for those of the jurors? Moreover, though the effects on victims may be the same, public conceptions of the seriousness of wilful corporate misconduct cannot automatically be transferred to corporate "negli gent" behaviour, and Kramer makes the common error of eliding the difference between regarding a crime as serious and being concerned about it (a fortiori being afraid of it). Are the public as worried about dangerous cars and medicines or about health and safety violations as they are about burglary, mugging and rape? If not, why not? These fruitful questions remain to be explored, hopefully on an international comparative basis. Three Mile Island or the Union Carbide plant in India before and after they exploded would have been good places to start! Similarly, it is all very well to note that lower-class criminals (and, I would add, professional and amateur fraudsters) often morally neutralise their own conduct by pointing to the unprosecuted crimes of their social superiors. (Though generally, in my observation, they refer to fraud and corruption rather than corporate crime proper as discussed in this book.) However, if we were tougher on corporate crime, would there actually be less fraud, mugging and burglary? Research shows that corporate crime and fraud are viewed extremely seriously by the public, but this may not mean that they wish the State to indulge in an orgy of corporation-bashing. Seriousness surveys that are purely crime-based can be misleading, for attitudes towards crimes and the "appropriate" punishment of 292</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS criminals are likely to be affected by our attitudes towards "the sort of people" we believe are committing them. Whereas unemployed street criminals have little (except riots) with which to inhibit policing, corporate criminals have in their favour not only superior "fixing" power but also a positive overall social image as providers of employment and producers of desired goods. These respective trade-off power positions are a major brake on the movement for greater social and criminal justice, and this generally illuminating book, like many on crimes of the powerful, under-estimates the ambivalence for corporate crime control that arises from the fact that workers benefit—however unequally—from the general activities of corporate criminals and non-criminals alike.
