<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Gold Diggers: Projective Prose Nathaniel Mackey She could not offer herself up; she only told of herself in a preoccupation which was its own predicament. - Djuna Barnes, Nightwood Despite having said that he "would rather be a 'writer' than a 'poet' or a 'novelist' " (CP, 112) and repeated assertions to the effect that he feels equally given to prose as to poetry, Robert Creeley is known primarily as a poet. He's more specifically thought of as a Black Mountain poet, though this designation, with its suggestion of sprawling, open-ended structures a la Charles Olson and Robert Duncan, seems somewhat at odds with the clipped, "minimal" poems he has for the most part written. Creeley himself seems to have sensed that his characteristic terseness is a bit out of line with the "open" practices of the poets he's usually associated with. In 1968 in a postscript appended to the transcript of remarks he made at the Vancouver Poetry Conference of 1963, he commented apropos the drift of those remarks: "I had trusted so much to thinking, apparently, and had gained for myself such an adamant sense of what a poem could be for me, that here I must have been signaling to myself both a warning and the hope of an alternative" (CP, 41). He goes on to thank "Allen Ginsberg... Robert Duncan, Charles Olson, Denise 469</page><page sequence="2">Levertov, and the many others, who were wise, as they say, long before myself" for their part in the breakthrough signalled by Pieces the following year. Creeley, as his own sense of indebtedness suggests, wasn't alone in his dissatisfaction with his pre-Pieces poems. Duncan remarked in 1969: "There was nothing for me to take hold of in a mythology in the poetry, and the early Creeley was very stubbornly restrictive in his areas of operation...."1 Levertov, in her review of Pieces, comments that even in light of the new, more explorative direction seemingly hinted at by "The Door," an uncharacteristically long earlier poem dedicated to Duncan, Creeley went on writing mostly more conclusive poems: many of them are of a ravishing perfection, but sometimes it has seemed as if that perfection were a limitation, a sealing off when one wanted him to go on, to go further, not to be obsessed with refining what he had already done impeccably.2 Pieces she calls "Creeley letting his hair down.. . a breaking open." It's very interesting that Creeley himself views his prose, the novel The Island and the earlier The Gold Diggers and Other Stories, as having paved the way for this opening up. He remarked to Lewis MacAdams during an interview: That novel opened up a great deal of possibility for me. I remember Duncan saying, after he'd read it, "This really changes the whole formal occasion for you. Both rhythmically, and in the order of statement you previously had." And I think he's right. I think it permits poems like "The Finger" to be written .... And honestly, by the time I get to "The Finger" now, now the information is transformed. In the writing, and in the experience that the writing is getting to. And that's what was happening in that damn novel. (CP, 164-65) ("The Finger," one of the poems in Pieces, Levertov refers to as "a poem that does relate pretty closely to 'The Door.' ") Duncan seems to have felt similarly about The Gold Diggers; that is, that the stories were out in front of the poems, even if in no other sense than that he was able to "get to" them quicker: much of the tone of Creeley was one that I was not quick to pick up on. But Creeley's short stories I could read aloud and did in 1953, I guess, at a reading we had at that point, it sort of got Creeley across to the San 470</page><page sequence="3">Francisco poetic community. Again of course because of the punctuation in the short stories, you could carry across in the rhythms, and I realized that Creeley was the only artist since Lawrence, as far as I was concerned, in the short story. And I knew if a man could write short stories that way I must be wrong wrong wrong about the poetry. (Al, no pag.) Olson too seems to have been more excited by Creeley's stories than by his poems. In his letters to Cid Corman early in the fifties he calls Creeley "the most important narrative writer to come on in one hell of a time" and "the push beyond Lawrence," and insists that "Creeley's work is extremely important exactly as the push beyond the fictive."3 But one looks in vain for any such reference to the poems. Or compare the almost autistic tentativeness of his review of For Love (in which he's reduced to such pseudo-statement as "Creeley has had the wit to make the short poem do what any kind of a poem might be imagined to do if it was doing what a poem might"4) with the tone of confident endorsement, the more typically Olsonian assertiveness of his "Introduction to Robert Creeley," which has to do with the tales: "I take it there is huge gain to square away at narrative now, not as fiction but as RE-ENACTMENT ...."5 One of the most noticeable things about Olson's "Introduction" is the perfect consistency between the principles he brings to bear upon and sees exemplified in Creeley's stories and the basic tenets of his own Projectivist poetics (the articulation of which he worked out largely in his correspondence with Creeley). Creeley's narratives come off sounding like instances of Projective verse. The assertion in the "Projective Verse" essay that "man is himself an object," for example, gets echoed in the "Introduction" by the insistence that "the writer, though he is the control (or art is nothing), is, still, no more than - but just as much as - another 'thing,' and as such, is in, inside or out" (HU, 128). There are other such echoings as well. The overall drift of Olson's argument is that Creeley's prose performs the Projective act of situating its controlling intelligence in the midst of the objects to which its attentions attend: It is human phenomenology which is reinherited, allowed in, once plot is kissed out. For the moment you get a man back in, among things, the full motion and play comes back (not parts extricated for show or representation) but the total bearing, each moment of the going - as it is, for any of us, each moment, anywhere. (HU, 128) So if the designation "Black Mountain poet" is taken to refer to more than the fact of residence at Black Mountain College, is taken, that is, to be 471</page><page sequence="4">synonymous with "Projectivist poet" and to involve the formal pre- dilections and "stance towards reality" thus implied, Creeley's claim to it would appear, on the basis of Olson's, Duncan's and his own testimony, to rest as much, if not indeed more, upon his prose as upon his poems. Creeley's "Notes for a New Prose," which first appeared in the second issue of Origin in 1951, has much to do with the relationship between poetry and prose. With something like Olson's assertion that "narrative writing is ... wholly waiting for the advance of verse" (LO, 60), Creeley vindicates, as it were, the "poetic" potentialities of prose. He goes so far, in fact, as to contrast the projective possibilities of prose with the stasis towards which poetry, or so he takes it, tends: In prose, the lean toward a "solution" or a stasis of idea most usually marks the book as a failure; I mean, insofar as a writer of prose is willing to give space to this fixing of idea as the logical "end" of movement, etc., just so far we usually won't go along with him. And I would figure that we are right. But we deny him, even so, the way out of it, this fix, or what could get him beyond these "logics." . . . It is, then, that we are still confused by the idea of "reality" in prose. We do not as yet get the basic fact, that reality is just that which is believed, just as long as it is, believed. Poets are more used to this thing.... So how could a prose catch up? Difficult to make the competition actual .... The swing of idea, in stasis - is still poetry. But prose is the projection of ideas, in time. This does not mean that the projection must be an "actual" one, date by date, etc. The word is law, is the creator, and what it can do, is what any prose can do. There is nothing more real, in essence, about a possible prose than there is about any possible poetry. The ordering of conjecture will remain as "real" as the ordering of fact, given the right hand. (QG, 12-13) Worth special note, in light of the charge of premature closure that's been made against Creeley's poems, is his insistence upon the inconclusive or anti-conclusive nature of prose: Poetry, as the formulation of content, in stasis; prose, as the formulation of content, in a progression, like that of time. This is a simple way of putting it. But sufficient to show that while poetry depends on the flux contained, held within the form, in stasis, prose may intend such a limiting but cannot justify one. It has no beginning or end. It has only the length it happens to have. ... Just 472</page><page sequence="5">here is the key to its possible reach, that, in spite of itself, it has to continue, keep going - cannot stop. ... it is, by nature, against conclusions.... (QG, 13) It begins to appear that Creeley, somewhat ironically, found the medium of prose more amenable than poetry to the demands of an open poetics. However applicable or inapplicable as a universal principle, such, he later comes to argue, has been the truth of his particular case. In the course of his "colloquy" with Linda Wagner in 1965, he returned to the subject of the differences between poetry and prose: for me personally poetry is an intense instant which is either gained or lost in the actual writing. Prose is much more coming and going, though my own habits in writing prose are very much like those I do have in writing poetry .... Prose allows me a tentativeness which I much enjoy at times because it's a need. That is, I don't want to anticipate the recognition of what's involved so that prose gives me a way of feeling my way through things. Whereas poetry again is more often a kind of absolute seizure, a demand that doesn't offer variations of this kind. (CP, 107, 109-10) There's a danger, of course, of exaggerating differences, of pitting Creeley's narratives against his poems. The point I'm eventually making, however, is simply that aside from their intrinsic interest (the fact that they're some of the best writing Creeley's done and arguably some of the best by any recent narrative writer), the tales in The Gold Diggers merit attention also for their relationship to Creeley's and Olson's Projectivist poetics. A good deal of similarity in fact exists between the poetry and the prose. They both show Creeley to be a master of compression and both, very exactingly measured, have as one of their most salient features Creeley's habit of breaking each utterance into smaller, somewhat staccato bits (by way of a caesura at each linebreak in the poems and an almost percussive use of commas in the prose). One finds in the stories, that is, the same "practised stumbling" Duncan attributes to the poems (Al, no pag.). For example: I would have gone, or as I think, I should have in spite of it, simply slipped out, when the others weren't looking, just left and waited for her outside. I can't see that she would have been hurt. That is, I would think, or think I would have that right to, that it would make no difference to her, that is, that she would understand my 473</page><page sequence="6">going, seeing that it had begun to tire me, even became painful to stay. I think of it so, being such, that no difference could be in it, since she was enjoying it, or so it seemed. (GD, 30-31) This "stumbling" is shared on the thematic as well as the stylistic level,of course. Duncan, in the course of his remarks apropos "practised stumbling," refers to Creeley's attraction to Robert Graves's The White Goddess, a review of which appears in A Quick Graph (QG, 322-26). There is in fact no better illustration of this theme and this attraction than the very poem Creeley dedicates to Duncan, "The Door" (whose lines "The Lady has always moved to the next town/ and you stumble on after Her" [FL, 102] are probably the source of Duncan's phrase). This poem recalls Graves not only in its regard for the Lady but also by way of its title. Graves too has written a poem entitled "The Door," which Creeley in fact quotes in his review of The White Goddess. One passage in particular from The White Goddess stands out in my mind as relevant to Creeley's "theme" of woman-as-Muse. (His inclination in this direction seems so instinctual and constitutional, his having to do with "her" so fundamental and pervasive, I hesitate to use the word theme.) "Man is a demi-god," Graves writes, "he always has either one foot or the other in the grave; woman is divine because she can keep both feet always in the same place, whether in the sky, in the underworld, or on this earth."6 A certain "surefootedness," I'm trying to suggest, characterizes women as portrayed by Creeley, as opposed to an insistent awkwardness, a tendency to stumble, on the part of the men. The women in his tales strike one as much more solid, much more situated and at home with things than the men, who tend to be like Italo Svevo's Zeno, crippled by excessive thought (as when Zeno, reflecting on the com- plicated coordination of fifty-four distinct muscles in the simple act of taking a step, finds himself almost unable to walk, reduced to a limp). It can even be said that the female characters function as (pardon the expression) "straight men," foils against which the ruminations of the men get played. This is especially the case in "The Lover," "The Dress," "In the Summer" and "The Party": Of uncleanliness, he was saying, there are, one must come to think, a good many kinds. Or more, put it, than dirt on the hands. The wind shifted, slightly, pulling them down the lake and in toward the dock which he saw now as a line, black, on the water, lying out and on it. Not one, he said, not one sense would give you the whole of it, and I expect that continues what's wanted. 474</page><page sequence="7">But they sat quiet, anyhow, the woman at the far end, slumped there, and the length of her very nearly flat on the canoe's bottom. The man kept upright, the paddle still in his hands, but he held it loosely, letting it slap at the water, lightly, as the waves lifted to reach it. Nothing important, she said. Nothing to worry about, and what about tonight? We forgot that. He began to paddle again, but slowly, and looked back at her reluctantly, almost asleep. That doesn't please you, she said. You seem determined not to enjoy yourself. (GD, 55) The sense of women as somehow privileged or blessed, somehow exempt from the ruminative lostness, the mind-at-large-within-the-quandary-of- itself which afflicts the men, gives rise at times to slightly paranoid feelings of contempt. In "The Lover," for example, the male protagonist complains, "I don't do a goddamn thing, but think, do I?" and tells himself, "Stop thinking about it. Get out of it. Let go," yet resents and in his mind lashes out against his wife's apparent contentment, her presumed immunity to the ordeals of consciousness: talk, damn you, talk, he thought, say something, that makes sense, that won't leave me always alone, here or there, or nowhere I have chosen for myself, as I am now, here or there, but nowhere I would be. And the cats, he thought. The shell. The need for necessity, to have dependents. She liked them, she fed them. They were hers. And it was useless not to be angry anymore because he was and expected he would be, for a long time, that it would continue to be her that he didn't want or like or didn't want to have close to him, and always busy, he thought. Always busy. And could, then, scream, get away from me, you common thing! But she had rolled off and away, or he had, and lay there thinking, what was I thinking of. (GD, 70-71) Somewhat relatedly, the speaker in "The Unsuccessful Husband" at various points expresses a fear of his wife's cunning and surreptitious power: "And I wonder even now if her weakness, so persuasive in its own way, was not, after all, just another trick.... I had lived with my wife too long not to realize the infinite resources at her disposal . . ." (GD, 18). "The Gold Diggers," "A Death" and "The Boat" are also stories in which a controlling female presence figures, the last somewhat violating the pattern, however, in that a woman, Mrs. Peter, is the one who shoulders the burdens of thought: "do I now think what I think because I think other people have thought it" (GD, 111). 475</page><page sequence="8">The blurb on the back cover of New American Story asserts that "Robert Creeley's protagonists are caught in the exacerbated sensibilities of their own minds." This is true. Creeley's tales tend to have been given rise to by certain knots of sensibility. Such knots, in any event, seem to be what they're about. Which is not to say that any definite sense of issue or "plot" tends to emerge, even given the phrase "knots of sensibility" as an abiding malaise. Creeley has repeatedly warned against too easy an assumption of what the word subject entails: "I find myself increasingly less able to explain why it is that I write something. I have no sense of subject more than some elemental one concerned with the need for distinction and the fact we are all alive. The story, as it were, comes with its own occasion, and orders me as much as I may it."7 Or as the male speaker puts it at the beginning of "In the Summer": "I am not saying that it was ever to the point or that a purpose could be so neatly and unopposedly defined. Or that twenty-one or so years ago, on that day, or on this, he was then, or is now, there or here, that we could know him and see him to be what he is. I don't much care for that" (GD, 75). Some such disavowal of "subject" allows an indeterminacy to dictate what courses the tales might take: The story has no time finally. Or it hasn't here. Its shape, if form can be so thought of, is a sphere, an egg of obdurate kind. The only possible reason for its existence is that it has, in itself, the fact of reality and the pressure. There, in short, is its form - no matter how random and broken that will seem. The old assumptions of beginning and end - those very neat assertions - have fallen away completely .... (GD, 7) This indeterminacy, the randomness or brokenness of the world it seeks to disclose, can be said to be what aggravates or "knots" the protagonists' minds. "A Death" illustrates this tendency well, the characteristic coyness as to what's at issue. A distinct tension pervades the piece, though whatever events have given rise to this tension are left undisclosed: But what was to be done with James. His wife thought she knew, and yet he was strangely moved. The children were happy, they played behind them with the toys they had brought in the basket. So she attacked him directly, and asked him, what was it. He said he did not know. Is it your sister, she said, and looked down, and away, to the form still clear to them, a white odd shape on the top of the sea. He answered that he did not think 476</page><page sequence="9">it was. She said, you must see the difficulties. He was not sure that he did. (GD, 39) Nor are we, the readers, sure that we do. Some sense of rivalry between the wife and the sister appears to exist (even if nowhere other than in the wife's imagination), but the details of it - much less the reasons for it - are never quite gone into or spelled out. Such ellipsis or understatement actually increases the tension, in much the same way that undiscussed anxieties tend to grow more and more intense. When James's sister and her son Amos take their nude swim we are told quite casually that "James fumbled in his embarrassment" and that he "coughed, he wanted not quite to see," but Creeley avoids stating outright or seeming to make a big point of the fact that James is upset with his sister's daring. In fact, the probable cause of his discomfort, her nakedness, is never explicitly referred to as such. Neither the word nude nor the word naked is ever used, and the apparent impropriety of any such explicitness, the apparent un- mentionability of her nakedness, is perfectly consistent with and in fact instrumental to the air of repressed, inarticulate emotion to which the story gives rise. The reader is informed of James's sister's decision to swim naked in a very offhand and oblique manner, in such a way that her nudity is made incidental to the words which are used: Taking off their clothes, she put them in a pile, and then put a stone on top of it. Amos giggled. She had forgotten the bathing-suits, and they were in the basket, high up on the hill with the others. Even so she slipped into the water quietly, and calling softly to Amos, drew him in after her. (GD, 37) The fact that this nude swim crystallizes or catalyzes a whole host of anxieties, resentments and frustrations is allowed to sneak up on us (and on the characters in the story as well). When the man in the boat sees James's sister - or, more to the point, sees her nakedness - we are told that "at that even James was angry," but still no such explanation as that James's prudish, possibly incestuous protectiveness causes his anger is offered. In the next paragraph the sister is described as smiling after his swim and "not ashamed," the implication clearly being that in the minds of James and his wife she should have been. Finally the wife's questions "And the boat?" and "Did you see the boat?" - really meaning the man in the boat - and James's noticing "the tight thigh, and the brown, close flesh," beneath his sister's raised skirt brings things to a head: "She saw the faces all in front of her, and if she cried out at them, she was still in love with everything" (GD, 41). The indeterminacy at work in a story like "A Death" can be said to involve the absence of (to further overwork an overworked notion) an 477</page><page sequence="10">"objective correlative." The emotions portrayed seem in excess of, or at least incongruous with, the facts presented. (Why all the fuss over a naked swim?) This would in fact seem to be the point of the quotation from Lorca which serves as an epigraph to the story: Vestida con mantos negros piensa que el mundo es chiquito y el coraz6n es immenso . . . ("Dressed in black clothes she thinks the world is tiny and the heart is im- mense . . ."). In other words, feelings (coraz6n) are finally larger than the facts (el mundo) to which they attach themselves, and the absence of an "objective correlative" is not so much an artistic defect as a fact of life. No such naive adequation as Eliot suggests in fact exists - and the lack of any such adequation is what forces the mind (or heart) back upon itself, away from (by way of) the world and into the knot of self-apprehension - and Creeley is careful not to be presumptive as to which facts are to be seen as the source of the emotions he depicts. One can, of course, argue that James's and his wife's anxieties and James's sister's climactic outburst all derive from the stresses and strains of the recent death of the sister's husband. But it's worth noting that, even though the story's title leads one to expect otherwise, Creeley seems bent on discouraging any such focussing in on that death, any such taking of it as subject or underlying explanation. No outright mention of it is made until the story's next-to-last sentence, and even there it's given no more weight than the obvious fact that James's sister knows it's her brother's wife who's just asked about the boat: "Did you see the boat, his wife asked. She knew it was her brother's wife. She knew her own husband was dead" (GD, 41). Creeley seems less interested in depicting the emotions with which the story has to do as the issue of any conclusively determinable source than in insisting upon the diffuseness of feelings and of possible sources of feeling. He makes use of a field, rather than a focal, approach. The most readily acceptable explanations of why James, his wife and his sister feel and behave as they do - that the recent death has put them all on edge or even that James cares for his sister in some way that his wife is jealous of - are suspect and thus to be played down exactly because they are so readily acceptable, so pat. The fact that at the time of the writing of these stories Creeley was very much into the music of Charlie Parker, Dizzy Gillespie, Miles Davis et al. is not without significance. Creeley's narratives have a certain syncopated or "offbeat" quality, in that their emphases or accents tend to fall other than where one would expect them to. Notwithstanding its title, "A Death" pays no direct attention to its ostensible subject. Nor are the sorts of psychologizings one might expect indulged in. Unexpected transitions or abrupt changes of reference typify the prose: But what was so simple about it. Make me happy, she said. Don't please think of her. James was very much in the middle and began to know it. He knew 478</page><page sequence="11">love was not multiple, or could not be here divided. He said, be patient with her. He let it all rest on kindness. The water around them changed all that, on their bodies, very much on their bodies. Amos jumped up, shrieking, and she loved him more than she admitted. Look, she said. The small fish darted out, past their white feet, and then back again to the darker places. But Amos had seen them. It was lovely. (GD, 38) Here literally before we know it "them" is no longer James and his wife but James's sister and Amos. The further point being gotten at by this syncopated prose appears to be that not only are things not always where we look for them, things are not altogether where we find them either. Or, to borrow - as Creeley or Olson might - the language of physics, not only is a thing or event a corpuscle (discrete, particulate, local), it's also a wave (continuous, tumescent, dispersed). Again, the diffuseness of feelings and of possible sources of feeling. Creeley forsakes the flatness of explanation, of any reductive attribution of causes, for a vigilantly non-presumptive open apprehension of things, allowing the multiplicity of forces or influences which impinge upon any given event to make their presences felt. The reactions to a nude swim, say, are implied to be the issue of events (psychic as well as empirical events) other than the swim itself. The feelings which manifest themselves in response to the swim do not so much issue from that event as issue through it, their ultimate sources as much a mystery as those of life itself. Thus the speakers in Creeley's tales tend to approach things cautiously, to express themselves tentatively so as to give this mystery its due, dissociating themselves from the "certainties" entertained by the crowd: Other people, although I don't for a moment believe that what they say is true, at least claim a continuity in their lives, a going up or a coming down. The rise or fall which they maintain is their way of saying that they have lived and even those who stay in the middle suppose that they narrowly missed worse or very nearly achieved better. For me this does not apply, and I find it very hard to believe that it does even for others. (GD, 15) Or again: It's all right, or right is what they have said, that it's all right, but myself, I don't find their answers or even what 479</page><page sequence="12">they answer, to say it's all right. To her, or myself, or anyone, or even looking straight down at it, after it happens, what happens? (GD, 47) Relatedly, the preponderance of such qualifications as "I think," "so to speak," "like they say" and "I expect" bespeaks the provisional or non-definitive character of the assertions being made. "A reality, before it becomes our own, is often tricky and can be easily mistaken," the speaker in "3 Fate Tales" remarks (GD, 52). Olson's regard for Creeley's stories had much to do with this disdain for presumption. The "offbeat" or unsettled rhythms of Creeley's prose, the near stutter (or stumble) he gets from his use of the comma, mime a sense of apprehension, a certain nervousness or jitteriness not unlike that which Olson attributes to the Maya: "It was better to be a bird, as these Maya seem to have been, they kept moving their heads so nervously to stay alive, to keep alerted to what they were surrounded by ..." (HU, 12). This nervous alertness is in fact the gist of the field approach Olson espoused, that one not be "so astonished he can triumph over his own incoherence, he settles for that, crows over it, and goes at a day again happy he at least makes a little sense" (HU, 3). Creeley's protagonists tend to deny themselves the comforts (the numbing comforts) of any presumed or ready-made coherence, and instead approach experience with something like the humilitas to which Olson refers in "Projective Verse" (HU, 60). For example: A few nights ago I wrote down some of this, think- ing, trying to think, of what had happened. What had really happened like they say. It seemed, then, that some such effort might get me closer to an understanding of the thing than I was. So much that was not directly related had got in and I thought a little noting of what was basic to the problem might be in order. That is, I wanted to analyze it, to try to see where things stood. I'm not at all sure that it got to anything, this attempt, because I'm not very good at it. But you can look for yourselves. (GD, 23) The speaker in this story, "Mr Blue," not only eschews omniscience, but goes on to question his knowledge of those aspects of his life we'd expect him to be most knowledgeable about: But perhaps that's where I'm wrong, that I have that assumption, that I think I know what she is like. Strange that a man shouldn't know his wife but I suppose it could be so, that even having her around him for five 480</page><page sequence="13">years, short as they are, he could still be strange to her and she to him. I think I know, I think I know about what she'd do if this or that happened, if I were to say this to her, or something about something, or what people usually talk about. It's not pleasant doubting your own knowing, since that seems all you have. (GD, 25) Creeley's third-person narratives likewise shy away from any pretense of omniscience, offering very little comment upon or interpretation of the facts they report. The stories are often, in fact, similar in atmosphere and spirit to the French "New Novel." Creeley's seeming concern not with why things happen but that they happen recalls Robbe-Grillet's remark: "But the world is neither significant nor absurd. It is, quite simply."8 Likewise, his reluctance to engage in explications of motive, to rationalize or render actions transparent, has much in common with Nathalie Sarraute's Tropisms, where an insistence upon a pre-conscious, practically vegetative motility qualifies any "understanding" of human behavior.9 Creeley too is bent on evoking that primordial, mindless irritability we share with the simplest forms of life: Then she got into the bed, and lay down, coming to him, then, but nothing, he thought, and heard it, the cry, and got up himself to run to the door, pulling at it, and yelled, what, seeing the boy sitting straight in the bed, staring, and crying, screaming, the sound driving in on him as he came. What, he yelled, what, what, what, and got hold of the boy, by one arm, dragging him clear of the blanket, then bringing his own hand back, hard, to slap him, the head jerking back, and down. But useless, the screaming now louder, and he felt it useless, picking the boy up, to cradle him, holding him, and walking beside the bed's length, the moon still against them, a light, he said, and went back to the other room to find her waiting with the candle. (GD, 97) What The Gold Diggers's "Frenchness" has to do with Open Field poetics is this: both attempt a withholding of any anthropomorphic or solipsistic coverage of experience. Robbe-Grillet speaks of getting back to "hard, dry objects ... as alien as ever," just as Olson does of allowing objects "to keep ... their proper confusions." What this comes down to (the admission which opens or uncovers the field) is the acknowledgement of otherness - whether of unconscious impulses, inanimate objects, 481</page><page sequence="14">woman-as-Muse or the supernatural; of whatever, in sum, is beyond the reach of our appropriations - as a constituent of experience, as when the speaker in "3 Fate Tales" remarks: "I think we deal with other wisdoms, all more real than our own, which is to say, I think we have to do with others" (GD, 49). Or the male speaker of "In the Summer": "I am not sure that I speak now, even for myself, that I have not become the fact of much more than I intend" (GD, 80). In reference to the Sumerians and the Maya, Olson spoke of "a disposition toward reality which understood man as.. .force in field of force containing multiple other expressions."10 An Open Field aesthetic, he argued, would bring this "disposition" to bear upon writing, and it's clear that he saw Creeley's stories as an instance of this. The Gold Diggers allowed him the assertion that "narrative can take up that aspect of verse which is its multitude" (HU, 127), its admission of "multiple other expressions." The title story, in fact, reads like a deliberately graphic exemplification of this field approach. The setting in which the story takes place, that is, is literally an open field, and Creeley immediately, in the first paragraph in fact, stresses the unintentionality or unpredictability, the otherness of what can happen there: West of the mountains, the land rides out on a flat and open plain and continues for more miles than any one man ever knows of. The light is high, it comes from the farthest point of the sun. If you put a man here, already you find him lonely. If you put two, then what happens is not so much what either one man decides on, but what happens to them no matter. (GD, 119) Here two men live and shovel the ground for gold with a tractorlike machine. One of the two has gone into the city some distance away and returns with the story of a woman he took to bed while there. The weirdness of the tale is that the other man, the one who stayed behind, becomes helplessly caught up in his own idea of what this woman was like: "He thought of each thing, and could not even say who he was, or whether this had happened to him, or had not" (GD, 121). The next day while driving the machine he sees the woman, who after a moment floats clear of the ground and then disappears. That evening his sharing of this incident with his partner ends with him falling to his knees crying and the latter attempting to bring him back to himself by dangling a garment of some sort - the whore's presumably, and most likely lingerie ("the odor incredible but certain") - before his face: He went forward, grabbing at the cloth. The other man fell down still holding it, and then sat, on the 482</page><page sequence="15">floor. He kicked at him, and the other fell over completely and rolled flat on the floor, then quiet. The room was quiet. He bent over and picked up the table, and lifting it as high as he could, he let go. (GD, 126) There the story ends. Olson, in his "Introduction to Robert Creeley," distinguishes two possible narrative stances, one in which "the narrator stays OUT, functions as pressure not as interpreting person," and the other in which the narrator is a "total IN ... taking on himself the job of making clear by way of his own person that life is preoccupation with itself" (HU, 127), and argues that Creeley's stories are of the second type. It seems to me, however, that the tales in The Gold Diggers are of both types. One of the striking things about "The Gold Diggers" is the narrator's withholding of any interpretive comment (aside from the remark that "what happens is not so much what either one man decides on, but what happens to them no matter"). As in "A Death," no such explication as would familiarize the events, relieve them of their haunting peculiarity, is offered or allowed to intrude. Rather than clarifying or sorting things out Creeley seems bent on furthering a certain opaqueness, on allowing events "to keep.. . their proper confusions." This is especially evident in his use of pronouns (as in the above-cited use of them taken from "A Death"): One of them came up to him. He saw her head nodding under a high light, and some of it fell off the hair, glancing down to the glass in his hands. She was smiling at him or trying to also, and her hand had come forward enough to find his own. Speaking to her, his mouth was like the substance of his whole body, and twisted itself to answer. The low phrases continued, marking again and again each act of the meeting. In her room she went completely into him, against his own will tearing at him, so that he left her, he thought, unconscious. The obscenities were now actual, they surrounded him. He thought of each thing, and could not even say who he was, or whether this had happened to him, or had not. When he made supper, because the other man was too tired and hardly ate it, he went in a daze, and even the food which the other had brought was almost something he could not taste. (GD, 121) Though we don't find out so until the fourth and last sentence of this second paragraph, the third him ("they surrounded him") no longer refers to the man who'd gone into town but to the one who had stayed behind. 483</page><page sequence="16">(We know this because "the other" who brought the food has to have been the one who made the trip to the city.) This confusion of him's, however, is perfectly proper to a tale in which one man so totally appropriates the experience of another as to be put upon by a vision. Similarly, in the first paragraph an abrupt, unannounced shift of reference takes place: "Speaking to her, his mouth was the substance of his whole body, and twisted itself to answer. The low phrases continued, marking again and again each act of the meeting." Here two distinct instances of speaking, the man's answering the woman in the bar in the city and his later relating of the incident at home, are allowed to merge, thus confounding the two different time/space frames. This too is appropriate, of course, in that in the mind of the other man the two frames are the same. There are in fact, to my reading, more stories of the first than of the second type in The Gold Diggers. Of the sixteen stories only five ("The Unsuccessful Husband," "Mr Blue," "3 Fate Tales," "The Seance" and "The Dress") would appear to be of the "NARRATOR IN" sort. "Mr Blue" is the best example of this, the one to which Olson specifically refers. But Olson's distinction between these two narrative stances is finally more misleading than useful perhaps, in that it invests in and perpetuates the very objective/subjective dichotomy of which Creeley wants to be relieved. In "A Note on the Objective" he comments: A useless fight. However right it may be to damn the use of the subjective method as an excuse for emotional claptrap, it's apt to push us away from any understanding of the subjective in a more basic character, i.e., "belonging to, or of, or due to, the consciousness. ... " Impossible to write anything, lacking this relation of its content to oneself. Put another way: things have to come in before they can go out. Perhaps best to junk both terms, or at least to understand this necessary balance, one with the other. We can't stand outside our content and at the same time we can't eat it like an apple, etc. And perhaps, finally, more to the point than either of these two stances is that one which maintains: a man and his objects must both be presences in this field of force we call a poem. (QG, 19) (Or a story.) One of the most notable characteristics of Creeley's narrators, even when they're as introverted or introspective as in "Mr Blue," is a somewhat tense awareness of the possibility that things exist apart from the orderings of the mind. Creeley's tales, whether rendered as first-person or as third-person narrative, are "subjective" or "IN" in the sense of registering the movements and contents of consciousness, but also 484</page><page sequence="17">"objective" or "OUT" in that this registration constantly checks itself, keeps clear of self-indulgence or any loss of awareness of the possible discrepancy between actuality and thought. Conjecture is never allowed to lose consciousness of itself as such. In the first two paragraphs of the third of the "3 Fate Tales," for example, the phrase "I think" occurs five times, "I am not sure" twice, and "I would hope" once (GD, 49). This is typical of the air of tentativeness and critical self-consciousness which pervades Creeley's prose, the disdain for presumption I've already mentioned. The proliferation of qualifiers even in the reporting of what would otherwise seem incontestable is another sign of this, as in "The Suitor": Staggering back along what he took to be the path, he thought, long roads are happy roads, and continued. Somewhere inside the shape now looming beside him, like they say, was also the woman he loved, or had taken himself to, as she had apparently also taken him to. (GD, 129; my italics) Thus "Mr Blue" opens with the speaker announcing his intention to keep any "subjective" responses in check - "I don't want to give you only the grotesqueness, not only what it then seemed" (GD, 23) - to remain faithful to "what had really happened." His three assertions apropos dwarfs and the nature of size are offered with no small amount of self-effacement: "I'm not at all sure that it got to anything, this attempt, because I'm not very good at it." The tone throughout is humble, even apologetic, and his desire not to impose upon his audience pretty much ties him up in knots: My wife is also large .... But she is not so much large as large-boned. A big frame. I sound as though I were selling her, but I'm not. I mean, I don't want to sound like that, as though I were trying to impress you that way. It is just that I don't want to do. That is, make you think that I am defending her or whatever it is that I may sound like to you. In short, she is an attractive woman and I don't think I am the only one who would find her so. (GD, 24) This passage not only charts the movement of the speaker's thoughts but also registers the impact upon the rhythms of those thoughts of his apprehension of the other inhabitants of the field or space in which this articulation takes place. The allowance he makes for the sensibilities of his audience exemplifies a de-centralizing impulse, a field approach, his admission that not only other things but also other minds exist. This making evident of the impingement or impact of otherness upon 485</page><page sequence="18">consciousness, of a space occupied by other people, other things, even other places and other times, is what Warren Tallman means when he says of Creeley that "rather than think thoughts he thinks the world."1 1 The sensibility thus described or disclosed is a knotted one, yes, but is not to be accused of solipsism.1 2 The people in these tales so vigilantly reach out for the world, so relentlessly worry about the possible gulf between mind and world, as to make of their tension the dialectical "knot" which unites the two. Or to quote Tallman again: "Creeley is lost enough, his writing testifies, but he is lost on the near side of thought, in this world." How else to account for the specificity of his observations, the amazing grace of his stumbling prose? I looked, a flash, sideways, as it then happened. Looked, he looked at me, cut, the hate jagged, and I had gone, then, into it and that was almost that. But she said, then, she had seen him, earlier, that same day, as he was standing by a store, near the door, I think, as it had opened, and she, there, across the street, saw him motion, the gesture, then, a dance, shuffle, the feet crooked, and the arms, as now, loose, and it was before, as before, but not because of this, that made it, or I thought, so made it, was it, or it was that thing I hung to, when, the show over, they motioned us out, and I pushed a way for her out through the crowd.

Hammond's "Solipsism and the Sexual Imagination in Robert Creeley's Fiction" in Critique, Vol. 16, No. 3, 59-69. Such hardheaded throwing around of words like "solipsism," "delusion," "distorted reality" and "compensatory imagination" seems bent on denying Creeley and his characters that liminal or indeterminate space - dismissed by Hammond as a "private world" or "subjective reality" - wherein the actual is disclosed as a dialectical interpenetration of "objective" and "subjective," "public" and "private," etc. The word solipsism rests upon a static prying apart of these pairs, upon what Creeley himself calls "a useless fight" between inside and out. There can be no "answer" to Hammond's charge, of course, except to say that he speaks a language Creeley's tales have declared dead. 487</page><page sequence="20">?lacitas, iTew ,I.exico July 31, 1964 William latheson, Chief Rare Book Department Washington University Libraries St. Louis 30, .:issouri Dear 1.r iatheson: Thapk you for your good letter of July 29th. I am very pleased by your decision, and will let you have, in effect, first option on additional papers I will have for sale in the future. I am, however, most anxious that you understand the nature of the novel manuscript, i.e., that it U, in fact, a first draft (I am referring to the yellow sheets which you mention). Let me note, briefly, my working habits, particularly with respect to this book. I began each section with the thought of having each a division of five chapters, and I committed myself to writ- ing a chapter a day--so that actually the writing time of the book, literally was the number of chapters contained in it-- with one exception, if I remember correctly where a chapter took two days (but I cannot now remember which one it was). I had no 'plan' for the book more than the thought of centering it on my own involvement, at a specific time and and place (MLal- lorca), in what had proved an unhappy marriage. Of course, much more comes into the book, in a sense--but it comes in only as the direct process and/or effect of the writing. In any case, let me emphasize again that you do have the literal working manuscript of the book, in those yellow sheets. How the only possible qualification of that I can think of is this. At times, in beginning a chapter, I'd make a false start, to my own mind. That is the feel of the prose would go off-- nothing would prove to '4ollow'--and so I'd begin again. But these 'starts' would be, at most, no more than a paragraph er two, and often no more than a few sentences. Further my wife-- on whom I depended for a sense of initial coherence, i.e., as soon as anything began to come, I'd literally show it to her-- says there were only about five times when this happened, and only one where the false 'start' extended to a half page. She also notes that what I then did write was altogether different, so that what I then wrote was not a revision of the first start but rather a new one in all senses. (If I remember rightly-- since I don't of course now have the manuscript here--chapter five shows some clutter, at the outset, kept in the copy, and crossed out--and I remember chapter six as difficult to get going, etc.) In other words, what I would like again, to make very clear is that this typed yellow-sheets dradt is the orking manuscript.

The line of them wavered as it climbed in the blackness of the night, up the turning road of the hill in half circles, swinging in the darkness back and forth, slowly, up and up as their lights faded into the distance of the night. .The town left below them faded also with only the slurring wash of the sea and a donkey, left high on the hill, to break the quiet. Artie talked to the driver of his taxi, which the night's excursion might sooner or later lead him to purchase. It seemed that his own security lay in looking ahead, to an all but impossible pro- gram of providing. So that if the taxi crashed, he would already have set about a program for being himself its owner. So that no real loss might then be blamed upon him, the taxi being his. But he mumbled and his Spanish was imperfect. Half drunk, he wanted to reassure the driver, apparently an ordinary man though much ex- cited by the lateness of the hour nd the road,which grew worse. How to do that. Pocos momentos, said, nosotros son alli. But/AG whee, thought Artie, they had be tr be up and amiai, ecause the payment of this good fellow depends 4~on them. Dropping down into the valley, the carts, coming up, pulled over half asleep, as the driver of the taxi swept past them. The dropping road confused him and he expected each new curve to bring them to the flat of the road far below. So into the town they came in the wheezing car at a mighty clip, sweeping past the sleep- ing houses, until Artie yelled, it's the next road, and the driver braked hard and swung as the car leaped right and at last stopped in front of the house which Artie indicated. The barber shop, occupying the first floor, was oertainly closed, but the barber and his family were awake. They heard the car stop with old memories of half-light visits, and the silence which followed them, the disappearing friends. But this had to do with the Americans and so letting their door fall open a little, they saw Artie clumsily tip-toeing up the stairs to the second floor entrance of los Americanos. Artie waved a discreet acknowledgement of their presle nce. uMeman smiled back and Artie for a moment wanted to make that his destination. But he went on and coming to the door, knocked softly, then more desperately, then without question pounded and pounded. The barber called, they are still ed asleep, they sleep late, mister, you had better come back again later, they are still asleep. High above in the hall that made do as bedroom, the American John was waking up, hearing through sleep the pounding of Artie below. His wife moved heavily beside him, also waking, and they got up. Artie, waiting, had stopped pounding. John opened the door and looked straight into Artie's vigorous smile, the short, bandy figure, all of Artie that there was to see. He was there all the way, and was saying something like, awfully sorry, John, such an hour, but had to see you, get canned, you know, need to pay the chap, so obliging, such a long way, can you let me have the money, for the cab, pay you back this Friday. todforsaken Artie with his thin hopes, impeccable courage, such bare affronteries, all of it compounded in a jerky, wistful, beautifully wise and at times quite horrible Cockney, which wasn't at that authentic.

I don't know just where the sense of revisions being a necessary part of so-called litera1y composition has come from, as a term 9,1 of professionalism. I mayAthat I distrust it--feeling too often "&gt;l it masks the character of the original impulse-which is for me most signifloant. In fact, I feel this so strongly thet.I've emphasised it in a recent note for the Leonn Times i.e. for a supplement they are doing next month on avant garse writLng, etc., as followst "I have never explicitly known-before writing--what it was that I would say. For myself, articulation is the in- telligent ability to reoggnize the experience of what is so given, in words. I do not feel such a sense of writing is 'mindless' or 'automatic' in afbrative way...' As a younger man (and continuingly) Stendhal was much a center for me. He was and is my own measure, in point of 'what can be said' as writing. Somewhere in his work--peahaps in Henri Brula.rd (?)--he says "I write from the heart..." to meaE,he has no plan, no outlL e, etc. Nor do I--nor have I ever, that I can at all remember. ihere is the story also, that Stendhal was suddenly called upon by the printers to replace some 50 pages of manuscript from the Charterhouse, which had been mis- laid--and that he simply sat down and wrote 50 pages then and there, and that no one could then say, when all was together, just where they were. What I am trying to emphasize is this. I do not believe--at least not for myself--that revlsions serve any purpose more than to blur what has 'een articilkdd as a prrpary reconition, in the initial writing. Others may profit by reworking what is so given them, but I do not--and have never published either poetry or prose wherein such a process is definitive or even literally present in any sense. (Had you other manuscripts, either of poems or of stories, etc., this would be clear enough.) So I hope I have olarified that point for you. It is an import- 0 ant one, not only for myself in the instance of this manuscript-- but as evidence against, god willing, any assumption that what one calls inspiration, what is iven to write, is not the most important factor.
