This research must take into account evolutionary approaches; first, in terms of hominid evolution, for it is only by taking into con sideration work on symbolization, language development, the capacity to engage in metacogni tion and cooperation, the tendency to form hierarchies, engage in violence, sexual differentiation, and related topics, that one can hope to trace the emergence of certain relatively stable features of human behavior. But since symbolization and the other capacities mentioned above are exer cised in specific social circumstances—which themselves could not have come into existence were it not for the exercise of those capacities—it is essential to consider social evolution, espe cially insofar as this evolution leads to the appearance of stratified societies and to the kind of labor that prevails in them. Keywords theory, fashion, discourse, ideology, science In discussions of what "religion"2 may be—where it comes from, how one defines it, what it encompasses—it is not uncommon to come across remarks 1 The remarks that follow are, in a condensed manner, the speculations mentioned in the authors contribution to Contemporary Theories of Religion (see Benavides 2009a: 59; cf. 2000a, 2009c, 2009d). 2 The connection between reflexivity and the use quotation marks, explicit or implicit, in contemporary communication is discussed in Benavides (2009c: 24). In the present essay, the use of quotation marks around "religion" has to do with the fact that we are dealing with a con cept whose meaning is contested, rather than with having succumbed to political correctness or with being part of a "comedy of innocence," as claimed by Michael Stausberg (who has probably translated into English Unschuldskomôdie, an expression used by Karl Meuli in his work on hunting/sacrifice and later by Walter Burkert in the same context). Once started, the mise en abyme of reflexivity inevitably leads to embedding one's words in multiple—and potentially ) Koninklijke Brill NV, Leiden, 2010 DOI: 10.1163/157006810X531030</page><page sequence="2">240 G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 as to whether that contested category should not include sports. Sometimes the reference to a sport is used polemically to demonstrate that a given defini tion is misguided; as when, for example, someone says, "But in that case foot ball would count as 'religion too!" Most of the time, the reference is meant in a loose rhetorical fashion, to show how hopeless the whole definitional enter prise is—or, more fashionably, that "religion" is a Western invention. Some times, though, the reference to sports may be of a more positive nature; for instance, when baseball or football of the US variety are considered as ingredi ents of American "civil religion." In none of these cases, however, do the char acteristics of the sport in question receive more than a glance in terms of what light they may shed on the phenomenon of religion in general. This is a pity, for a consideration of sports can open an unexpected window onto the genesis of religious configurations. I. The Production of Superhuman Agency Consider the passion elicited in most parts of the world by the sport known as football, fútbol, futebol, Fussball, voetbal. That passion is present also in Italy, the country in which this sport is known as calcio, a term that, by referring to a game played in Florence from the thirteenth to the eighteenth century, emphasizes the importance of locality and thus of difference (De Biasi &amp; Lan franchi 1997: 88-89). As those who have visited Naples know, street altars abound in the old part of the city; and while most of them are devoted to the traditional denizens of the Catholic pantheon—la Madonna, San Gennaro and other saints—one of them is a shrine to the deified Argentinian football player Diego Maradona. On via dei Tribunali, part of old via Spaccanapoli, one can see his picture enshrined together with a framed hair, the label of which reads Sacro Capello Miracoloso di Diego Armando Maradona ("Sacred Miraculous Hair of.. .").3 Why is Maradona's hair deemed to be "sacred" and "miraculous"?4 Because, one surmises, football fans believe that he surpasses to an extraordinary degree the abilities of his fellow players, and even more so that of amateurs; in other words, because of the admiration his physical infinite— layers of quotation marks, inverted commas and the like— with the ultimate quota tion marks being those to whose absence one calls attention. Those interested in these games are referred to "Menelaiadin John Barths Lost in the Funhouse (1968). 3 I saw the shrine in December 1998. Several pictures of the shrine can be found online by looking for Sacro Capello Miracoloso... in Google Images. 4 Using "deem" in the sense in which this verb is used by Taves (2009; cf. Benavides 2010). As it should be clear from what follows, however, instead of just focusing on the cognitive aspea implied by deeming, one must pay attention to the processes whereby that which is deemed to be x or y is produced as x ory; this applies to persons as much as to practices and objetts.</page><page sequence="3">G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 241 agency—the agency par excellence—elicits. The "sacred miraculousness" con densed in his enshrined hair has been generated by the paradoxical coexistence of purposeful deed and apparent gratuitousness, both of them extreme. Vicar iously exercising through him a miraculous skill that seems to transcend the limitations of what is physically possible, while also appearing to be free from the dull instrumentality of everyday work and thus ultimately of need, the spectators reward Maradona, indeed, divinizing him.5 The issue that must be addressed now is whether, besides the combination of the perceived superhu man/counterintuitive nature and the gratuitousness of the hero's deeds, it is possible to identify in football other elements which, being also found in reli gion, may shed light on the genesis of the latter. It is. What astonishes observ ers is, first, the fanatical loyalty of fans to their teams, a loyalty that is frequently passed from father to son, as if it were a priestly office or even belonging to a species; a loyalty which, in the case of international competitions such as the World Cup, seems to reach paroxysmal proportions, as if the team did in fact embody the essence of the nation. The manner in which this loyalty is fed is significant, too, for it is not the case that fens increase their commitment to their teams only as a result of the teams' victories; on the contrary, for in many cases that loyalty increases in direct proportion to the team's failures. This is not unlike what may have happened when the disciples found Jesus' empty grave.6 Nor is the deferred fulfillment all that different from apophatic forms of mysticism, such as Gregory of Nyssa's, in which fulfillment is a never end ing process. "There are, then, the ritual means used to reinforce that loyalty. These go from the players' uniforms and the insignia worn or displayed by the fens to the violent confrontations with members of rival teams, these exclu sively male affairs being ruled by the elementary friend vs. foe antagonism, à la Carl Schmitt (1932 [1963]: 26ff.). No less important are the bodily means, used both to maintain the esprit de corps of the fans and to intimidate the adversaries. These comprise producing elementary sounds by beating on drums and blowing on the simplest of wind instruments;7 shouting slogans; unison chanting—all of this accompanied by coordinated movements: the 5 On the significance for Argentinians of Maradona, the pibe from the potrero, see Archetti (1997); what Archetti writes about the characteristics of the pibe—"neither reasonable nor responsible," embodying "a particular cultural construction of maleness," "creative, free of strong feelings of guilt" (1997; 33-34, 38)—is also relevant in terms of our discussion of how divinities are imagined. 6 See Stegemann &amp; Stegemann (1997: 174). Although his death was quite different from that of Jesus, one could nonetheless consider in this context the role played by the absence of the Buddha in the development of Buddhism as a religion; see Bareau (1974). 7 The exultation elicited by the sound of the cornetti and trombones used by Monteverdi and Schiitz in the seventeenth century is not different in kind from that produced by the vuvuzelas</page><page sequence="4">242 G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 corporeal, rhythmic ways of keeping identities and communities alive, to which Paul Connerton (1989), Jean-Claude Schmitt (1990) and William McNeill ( 1995) have devoted insightful studies. Rhythmic, too, is the sequence of the games, regulated as these are by embedded regional, national, interna tional and worldwide liturgical calendars, calendars that seem to be, for many men, more real than the ones that regulate their ordinary lives. But the most significant component is the game itself: the ritual—that is, rule-bound— nature of encounters constituted by the exercise of the players physical agency, whose goal it is to wrest the ball from his opponents and to get it past the goalkeeper. This requires physical strength combined with extraordinary skill, but it also demands having a theory of mind—that is, the capacity to generate at lightning speed metarepresentations about the other players' intentions, for without this metacognitive capacity it would not be possible either to cooper ate with ones mates or to trick one's opponents.8 The above exercise—proposed, it must be said, by someone who is as imper vious to the lure of sports as to that of religion—is not intended as a demon stration that football should be, after all, considered as "religion." Its purpose is to identify certain recurring clusters without which it would have been impossible for the overlapping configurations of religion and sports to arise. Addressing, first, the issue of agency, we can see how the sovereign display of purposefulness and gratuitousness, typical of sports, parallels the manner in which gods are usually believed to act: freely, irresponsibly, as if being subject neither to limitations nor to need. But where does the desire to act gratu itously come from? What limitations do these embodiments of agency—some imaginary, some real—seek to transcend? One set has to do with the kind of constraints that, being organisms, human beings have to deal with, regardless of their position in a hierarchy: being subject to pain, disease, ageing, death;9 being unequally endowed in terms of strength, sexual attractiveness and a used during the 2010 football world championship in South Africa, richer as the earlier instru ments may be in terms of their aesthetic elaboration. 8 The practice of sports would constitute, in a manner that is both extreme and relatively harmless, the enacting of how "the actor constitutes himself in the mirror of the others and ultimately understands himself to be how he understands the others" (Voland 2007a: 449); a German version can be found in Voland (2007b: 746): "Der Akteur konstituiert sich selbst im Spiegel der anderen und versteht sich schliesslich so, wie er die anderen versteht." These consid erations should not lead to the neglect the sheer physicality of the game, which, like other litur gical performances, must also be regarded from a gender-specific perspective. ' It is not surprising, therefore, that the first three encounters of the man who would become the Buddha involved an old man, a sick man and a corpse; and it is not surprising either that the Aggañña Sutta of the Digha Nikàya (27), after accounting for the appearance of bodies and sexual differentiation, goes on to deal with the appearance of sexual activity, work, accumulation of goods, physical attractiveness and ugliness (see Benavides 2005).</page><page sequence="5">G. Benavides /Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 243 variety of qualities.10 The other set of constraints is of a historically contingent, but, once established, no less real nature: having to engage in the coerced, exploitative work that emerged along with stratified societies; the kind that has afflicted most of humanity since the agricultural revolution; the kind of organized labor, furthermore, whose products have been appropriated by elites, especially by rulers. Much of what eventually coalesces into the configu rations named "religion" has to do with the symbolization, validation and contestation of the labor/hierarchy complex (Benavides 2000b). Not that all forms of work are coerced, far from it. At its freest and most creative, work is but the exercise—the unfolding—of one's capacity to act. If one's own experi ence is not a sufficient reminder of this fact, it may be pointed out that between the ages of nine and twelve months, infants are able to adopt an "intentional stance" (Kelemen 1999a: 279), being "obsessed with goals" (Csibra &amp; Gergely 2007), engaging in "promiscuous teleology" (Kelemen 1999b), attributing "goals even to biomecanically impossible actions" (Southgate, Johnson, Csibra 2008), as if they were mythmakers or proto-theologians (Kelemen 2004). II. Needs, Metarepresentations and Surplus But even considered as the free unfolding of one's innate capacities, activity is nevertheless inextricably linked to the satisfaction of a need, that is, of a lack, a lack whose presence is not infrequently regarded as a defilement. But why should something that affects other organisms be resented by humans? The reason for regarding lacks as defiling is the capacity to generate metarepresen tations, a faculty that burdens humans to a degree not found in other species. This faculty allows human beings to imagine future need, which in turn forces us to put aside leisure in order to work; it also makes possible to postpone consumption, without which it would be impossible to store food. However, being able to imagine alternative scenarios, means to be able to imagine not being subject to need.11 This leads to imagining beings who are free from that affliction, including in some cases—generally understood as belonging to the realm of the mystical—imagining being free from the limitations inherent in being a being: hence the recurring speculations about "god beyond being" and 10 That the likelihood of having to endure pain or early death depends a great deal on ones position in a hierarchically arranged society is an issue that cannot be considered here; the same applies to a consideration of the correlation between position in a hierarchy and the likelihood of being able to activate or even to have desirable intellectual and physical characteristics. 11 Imagining this possibility is more important for the appearance of delimited religion than imagining what Bloch (2008) calls "the transcendental social," a concept that ultimately refers to little more than to the capacity to generate abstractions, which then acquire an "as if" existence.</page><page sequence="6">244 G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 the like. It also leads some—generally labeled as mystics or ascetics—to want to recreate that condition, becoming free from the stigma of being afflicted by needs, above all, being free from those having to do with the desire for others' bodies. But being able to imagine oneself as not being subject to need also leads to imagining ways to force others to work for us. That is why, in stratified societies, elites and above all rulers, pretending to be untouched by need, dis tance themselves from productive work, the degree—the purity—of their nobility increasing in direct proportion to the number of generations that separates them from the defilement of labor. That is also why they must engage in wasteful displays; these, besides involving the deployment of desirable goods, demonstrate the elites capacity to compel others to work for them, the precious displays being also—and perhaps above all—the displays of con densed labor. What kind of labor is being displayed is an issue that requires further clarification, for in some cases what makes an object costly is the sheer laboriousness of its production, while in others it is the difficulty of obtaining it, be it because of its rarity or of its being available in distant, hard to reach places. In other cases, however, what determines desirability is neither labori ousness nor physical rarity per se, but rather the formal surplus that produces what is known as aesthetic appeal or beauty,12 a designation that is no more imprecise than that of "sacredness." This peculiar form of costliness can involve rare materials and demand hard work, but what ultimately determines its appeal is the coincidentia oppositorumASkz coexistence of purposefulness and gratuitousness we encountered as much in sports as in the realms inhab ited by gods. In the case of rulers and of elites in general, then, the need to signal having transcended need requires their being surrounded by aesthetic elaboration; this, to such an extent, that to speak of the aestheticization of politics is in many ways as redundant as to speak of the aestheticization of religion.13 And just as in order to free oneself from work one must appropriate the fruits of someone else's labor, so does elite access to aesthetic elaboration require that non-elite groups surrender it. This is what happened in the ancient Near East, when the appropriation of labor had as its counterpart the concentration of aesthetic production. As David Wengrow (2001) has shown, aesthetic produc 12 Essential in this regard is Boyd (1999), even though this author does not deal with the fact that aesthetic production can be accumulated by elites at the expense of ordinary people, a phe nomenon discussed later in this essay. 13 These displays can be understood along evolutionary lines in terms of the handicap prin ciple: see Zahavi &amp; Zahavi (1997); and from an economics perspective in terms of Veblen's theory of conspicuous consumption: see Veblen 1899; cf. Dunnell 1999—the biological and the sociological being complementary explanatory strategies for the same processes.</page><page sequence="7">G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 245 tion, which was widely distributed during the Neolithic, making up the fabric of everyday life, became concentrated during the period of state formation in Mesopotamia, from the fifth to fourth millennium BCE. An analogous situa tion is found in fourth millennium BCE Egypt, where, in John Baines' words, there is a "split between the groups involved in artistic production and con sumption on the one hand, and the rest of society on the other" (1994 [2007]: 336), the focus of artistic production being to serve the secret activities of ruler and inner elites (1994 [2007]: 335). And lest one thinks that the appropria tion of aesthetic value is confined to archaic societies, it must be remembered that this happens whenever one signals ones refined taste, since the signal ing—or even the unostentatious exercise—of aesthetic judgment presupposes having enjoyed the leisure without which it would have been difficult to acquire that taste in the first place, the leisure itself having been made possible by the work of those whose taste will most likely be dismissed as coarse.14 III. As If Being beyond need leads in some cases to the rulers being surrounded by taboos that render them incapable of most activities, including that of feeding themselves; but, as it also happens with gods—who oscillate between the two faces of omnipotence, namely arbitrariness and ataraxia—being beyond need also means not having to justify one's actions. Thus, unless they are paralyzed by taboos, rulers act as if they were the arbitrary gods imagined by Augustine and Calvin. Their decisions—grounded upon themselves, as if they had been made by gods—create a perpetual state of exception (Benavides 2004, 2008). "As if": that is the missing piece in the puzzle. Rulers act as if they were omnipotent gods, who are themselves imagined acting as if they were arbitrary rulers. On ritual occasions rulers engage in rituals involving make-believe labor, as if, through them, they made possible the real labor of the workers whose products they appropriate. Priests act as if they had privileged channels of communication to the gods, while ordinary worshipers behave as if they believed them. The worshipers themselves act as if the divinities ate the food placed in front of them; as if they enjoyed being bathed or presented with new 14 Unless this coarse taste is incorporated into the refined one; this can be done through radi cally opposite strategies: either by toning down the coarseness or, on the contrary, by intensifying it, the incorporation being regarded in this case as an act of transgression. The parallels between these procedures and those involving the relation between institutional and non-institutional forms of religion cannot be discussed here; suffice it to say that priestly castes tend to monopolize access to sources of sacrality, defining as "superstitious" practices not controlled by the priests.</page><page sequence="8">246 G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 garments; or as if they heard their implorations or songs of praise—as if, ulti mately, the statue were the god.15 Those who engage in magic act as if language or meaningless sounds or gesticulations had direct effects on the world (Bena vides 2009b). Whatever else religion may be, it crucially involves acting "as if." In religions in which faith in its Pauline sense plays a role, the situation involves even more complex forms of "as if-ness," because in this case having "faith in" means more often than not having faith in faith, believing that one believes, with the result that the gods are further removed from the ones who claim to believe in belief. The "as if" is crucial in the case of sports, too; for the football players act as if it really mattered that the ball reach its goal, bypassing the goalkeeper;16 while the fans behave as if there were a real connection between them and the team—as if, in fact, the movements of their bodies while watching a game were magically communicated to the ball in the field.17 Insofar as both players and fans have to anticipate what the next move will be, the "as if" world in which football fans generate their bodily fantasies ultimately intersects with that of the players who must generate metarepresentations about how the other player will act (and also about that players metarepresentations). What takes place in this sport, then, is the "as if" version of what happens in the hunt—the quintessential "getting"—that is central in Walter Burkert's theory of religion, as the hunter, besides deploying his physical strength and skill, must anticipate the moves of his prey, engaging in metacognition. But the hunt itself eventually becomes an "as if" scenario, a royal sport in which those who are above need can nevertheless engage in the wasteful expenditure of energy, thus demonstrating their leisure, while still having to anticipate the moves of the prey whose meat they no longer need in order to keep hunger at bay. The gods, the protagonists par excellence of "as if" scenarios, are also imagined as being masters of metacognition; that is, as masters of the capacity 15 The examples could be multiplied almost at will; for a recent treatment, involving Roman practices, see Ando (2008; 22-25, 144-148, 164). 16 It may be objected that in professional sports it matters a great deal that the goal be scored; but victory is immensely profitable because of the emotional investment of fans who, at some point in their own lives as amateur players or even as observers, acted as if the only thing that counted was the game. That this impulse is manipulated by advertisers, professional sports orga nizations, politicians and many others, goes without saying; but no amount of manipulation can conjure up passions that have no bodily foundations. The same applies, mutatis mutandis, to the processes that make up religious configurations. 17 These movements are not qualitatively different from the almost imperceptible ones gener ated by someone who while listening to music pushes it along (or from the voluntary movements of someone who in front of an imaginary orchestra acts as if he were conducting, say, a Brahms symphony).</page><page sequence="9">G. Benavides /Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 247 at which human beings excel: being able to see our most recondite thoughts (Bering &amp; Johnson 2005). Is this celebration of metacognition—which may have teleological origins18—the result of our puzzlement about what it means to be human? No doubt it is; but depending on when this capacity began to be attributed to gods, we could understand it also as the apotheosis of the rulers ability to control those whose work he needs to appropriate; but also as the Utopian projection of those who imagine themselves as able to elude his grip. IV. Circulation, Deferral, Accumulation Approached from the perspective of work and need, which necessarily requires approaching it from that of social organization and therefore of hierarchy, religion is not to be understood as being present all at once, with contours that would be recognizable by, say, post-Reformation Westerners, when the bound aries between sacred and profane were being redrawn;19 nor is it to be under stood as "invented" by Western discourses, least of all by scholarly ones, as it is uncritically claimed these days. What must be done if one is to deal in a responsible manner with this protean configuration is to trace the articulation among biological, psychological and social processes—assuming that it is jus tified to distinguish among these categories—seeking to discern, at their inter section (Benavides 2009c), the emergence of certain configurations, whose boundaries are necessarily blurred, and whose existence is contingent upon the manner in which the said processes coalesce. In addition to those men tioned at the beginning of this essay, the processes to be considered involve generation and production, circulation and deferral, consumption and accu mulation, debt and payment. When approached from the perspective of emergent religion, one needs to pay attention to the manner in which special ists of various kinds—priests, ascetics, mystics, among others—are involved in accumulation and circulation, in production and consumption. To give but one example: when officiating their rituals, Catholic and Orthodox priests are at the center of elaborate aesthetic displays, as if they were the loci of symbolic and economic accumulation; and as they move up in the ecclesiastical ranks, the intensity of the aesthetic surplus in which they wrap themselves increases, regardless of the ritual context, until in some cases it is reversed at the top of 18 See Csibra &amp; Gergely (1998); Gergely &amp; Csibra (2003); Csibra (2003). The literature on metacognition is listed in Benavides (2009c; 2009d); not listed there is Voland (2007ab). 19 See, among others, Cabantous (2002), esp. chapters VII and VIII.</page><page sequence="10">248 G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 the hierarchy.20 On the other hand, insofar as they man the channels of com munication between ordinary people and their gods, the same priests are also in charge of controlling the flow of prayers, repentance and grace. In fact, the central ritual of Roman Catholicism—the mass—can be understood as the celebration of circulation. This is accomplished through the ritual reenact ment of the removal of a blockage, the original removal having been achieved as the result of the cancellation of a debt, with the blood of Jesus, the divine victim, as the payment. The desire for unobstructed flow is embodied above all by ascetics of various types, who, because of their claim to be beyond need and desire, function as if they were the filters who purify the world from the impurities generated when ordinary people engage in the activities that keep the world going. By eating what they are given, Jain, Buddhist, Manichaean21 and to some extent Christian monks cleanse the givers and their world. Nei ther defiled by labor, nor obstructed by deferral, the consumption in which the monks engage creates an "as if" world in which neither coerced labor nor expropriation nor accumulation exist, a world which ordinary people can vicariously enjoy. If one focuses on one of the recurring components of the configurations regarded as religious, namely divinities,22 one must examine whether the pre disposition to project agency onto supernatural beings manifests itself differ ently according to the type of society in which it occurs; that is, one must examine how the divinities of hunter-gatherers differ from those generated by the inhabitants of the stratified, agricultural societies of the ancient Near East, and of complex archaic states in general,23 and how these, in turn, differ from 20 These displays are discussed from the perspective of "cosdy signaling" in Benavides (2009e), where the relevant literature is listed; this perspective is also used to make sense of the sartorial proclivities of Joseph Ratzinger, the current pope. Regarding the reversal, one can consider the contrast between the ostentatious garments of cardinals and field marshals, on the one hand, and the relative plainness of those worn by popes and dictators such as Napoleon, Hitler and Stalin, on the other. 21 On the Manichaean ritual meal of the elect, see BeDuhn (2000). It would be worthwhile to consider from an analogous perspective the Buddhist practice of feeding the monks, the most important component of dana, which is generally approached only from the perspective of merit making—that is, of accumulation. 22 Instead of speaking of "culturally postulated superhuman beings," as Melford Spiro does in his definition of religion (1966 [1987]), it may be better to think in terms of bodily generated agents; for whereas Spiro's definition seems to point in a culturalist and purely representational direction, "bodily generated" recognizes that for the kind of organisms human beings are it has been difficult to function in a world free from gods. These considerations apply also to the understanding of super human agents common now among cognitivists. 23 In the case of archaic states, religion must be regarded in the context of the emergence and proliferation of systems and subsystems discussed by Adams (2001).</page><page sequence="11">G. Benavides / Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 249 the meaning-dispensing gods imagined in contemporary Western societies.24 In terms of the role played by religion in the transition from egalitarian to non-egalitarian societies, one must consider, for example, James Woodburn's point about how male ritual privilege among the Hazda hunter-gatherers is a "weak point in the immediate-return systems and a possible opening for one of the potential routes to delayed return" (2005: 27); and, further, Wood burns opinion "that the religious route, tortuous though it is, is likely to have been a major route, perhaps even the major route, in the repeated historical transition from immediate to delayed return" (2005: 29). Whatever the trajec tories to be studied, it should be clear that one must take into account evolu tionary approaches.25 This must be done, first, in terms of hominid evolution; for it is only by taking into consideration work on symbolization, language development, the capacity to engage in metacognition and cooperation, the tendency to form hierarchies, engage in violence, sexual differentiation, and related topics, that one can hope to trace the emergence of certain relatively stable features of human behavior, including the configuration now known as religion.26 But since symbolization and the other capacities mentioned above are exercised in specific social circumstances—which themselves could not have come into existence were it not for the exercise of those capacities—it is essential to consider them in a social evolutionary framework,27 resisting the current tendency to equate evolutionary approaches with racism, colonialism or Orientalism. V. The Production of Religion Despite its changing contours, the configuration identifiable as religion is gen erated by our being subject to needs, needs that presuppose our being subject to lacks. Oscillating between the celebration of our capacity to satisfy our 24 See Dôbert (1973); Eder (1973); see also Benavides (1995), where references to the rele vant studies by Raffaele Pettazzoni, Ernst Topitsch, Burkhard Gladigow, Guy E. Swanson, Ralph Underhill and John H. Simpson can be found. 25 This requires overcoming what Ellis (1996) has called "biophobia," that is, the systematic neglect by social scientists of work that involves evolutionary biology; see also Lopreato &amp; Crip pen (1999) and Machalek &amp; Martin (2010). 26 For evolutionary approaches to religion see: Fehling (1974); Baudy (1983); Crippen &amp; Machalek (1989); Atran (2002); Wilson (2002); Bulbulia (2004a; 2004b; 2008); Sosis &amp; Alcorta (2003); Sosis (2004); Alcorta &amp; Sosis (2005); Sanderson (2008); Sanderson &amp; Roberts (2008). 27 A list of relevant publications would include (not listing articles): Gellner (1988); Upham (1990); Maryansky &amp; Turner (1992); Earle (1997); Trigger (1998); Boehm (1999); Bogucki (1999); Johnson &amp; Earle (2000); Sanderson (2001); Plotkin (2003); Dunbar, Knight, Power (2003); Carneiro (2003); Boyd &amp; Richerson (2005); Richerson &amp; Boyd (2005); Lenski (2005); Levinson &amp; Jaisson (2006).</page><page sequence="12">250 G. Benavides I Method and Theory in the Study of Religion 22 (2010) 239-253 needs through the exercise of our agency, and the realization that lacks defile, humans have generated imaginary beings, whose deeds are as mighty as they are gratuitous. What is true of imaginary beings is also true of real ones, espe cially of those who are able to generate metarepresentations concerning future need. Already among the hunter-gatherers who, deferring consumption, store food,28 those who, through a degree of accumulation, have managed to dif ferentiate themselves from their fellow humans, avoid at all cost having to engage in burdensome work (Testart 1982b: 70, 111), becoming instead regu lators of the flow of goods produced by others, until, as the result of increased production, made possible by coerced labor, they become the aestheticized embodiments of consumption, gratuitous power and metarepresentational prowess, just like the gods.
