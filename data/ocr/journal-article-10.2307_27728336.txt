<plain_text><page sequence="1">Protze ?age Carbeb &amp;tone, Carrickrobm X (See Frontispiece,) As mentioned in the survey of this Townland by Fr. Corcoran, C.C., there is a field called by Mrs. Mulholland, its owner, ''Gorry na Gorp."1 Lying propped up against the fence, Fr. Corcoran was shown a stone on which were " the marks of horses' hooves." On turning the stone over he found it to be the very interesting example of a Bronze Age carved stone, shown in the accompanying illustration. The field is a small one, only divided from the marsh surrounding Cortial lake by an often flooded cart-pass. It is low lying, slightly swelling in contour and seems an unusual position for a cairn and sepulchral chamber. In the higher end of the field close to Mrs. Mulholland's house, a stone lined passage was partly un covered some years back. The description given exactly agreed with that of a souterrain passage with one bend. Fr. Corcoran was told of what may have been a cist and bones discovered in the field 50 years ago, and also of a tradition of a battle and burial there. On the rocky knoll above the field there is the remnant of a circular earthwork, a small low ring bank in which are large stones. This might possibly be all that remains of the central core and burial chamber of a cairn from which all the stones had been carried away, but there is no tradition to support this. The stone is 3! feet high, 27 ins. wide and 5 ins. average thickness. It is said to have been found under the ground in ploughing operations. Other large stones were sunk so as not to catch the plough. In all probability this stone once stood upright, the ground level coming to the lower edge of the carvings. The type is usually associated with burial chambers of the Bronze Age. Before this, none was known between the Newgrange, Dowth Slieve na Calliagh group, and those in County Tyrone in the Seskilgreen district. This is the only one in County Louth. It is quite possible that this Carrickrobin example is the one remnant of a destroyed burial chamber. Its companions may be hidden under the surface? none could be found in the surrounding fences or fields. 1The position is marked on the Townland Survey Map of this issue, p, 3S3. I</page><page sequence="2">388 COUNTY LOUTH ARCHAEOLOGICAL JOURNAL. Prof. Macalister writes as follows :? " This very interesting stone is well worth looking after carefully and I hope it will be protected from destruction or theft. It seems to me quite an important example of its type. " The groove dividing the field into two parts is a feature not unknown else where, though I have never seen such a prominent one. At Seskilgreen in Tyrone it takes the form of a straight diagonal line of cup marks. Elsewhere it is imaginary, but the marks on one side are different from those on the other. So it is with this new example. There are complete circles on one side of the groove, not on the other. " The engravings are on the whole of ordinary cup-and-circle, or cup-ray-and circle type : certainly Bronze Age, but of their meaning we have no idea, and are not likely ever to have. " The carvings on this stone remind me of some of those in the south of Scotland rather than of other Irish stones. The little ring of dots between two of the circles under the groove is not necessarily a " fake "?there is something quite similar on a cup-and-ring stone at Cardoness, Kirkcudbrightshire?(see illustration). The same stone shows an example of the unusual broad cylindrical cup wTith flat bottom seen also at the top of the Carrickrobin stone. " Could it be erected on a pedestal with a little shed over it ??bars being placed on both sides to prevent cattle from sheltering in it." Mr. L. S. Gogan draws attention to the fact that one of the Newgrange stones has a similar zone-feature and says that there are reasons for regarding it as an adaptation of the girdle feature of the statue-menhir type of figure representing the Mother Goddess and that this stone might be a highly stylised version of that deity ? In the photograph the stone has been propped up on its end. At the top above the horizontal groove are (1) a flat-bottomed circular depression, (2) two concentric circles without a marked central cup and (3) a cup and single circle. There are also two isolated cups. Below the groove, on the left is a cup with " gutter " or " ray " running down from it, surrounded by two concentric circles, between the innermost of which and the cup is a ring of seven small holes. (It is this design which was, not unnaturally, compared to a horseshoe.) Then a large design of a cup and three circles with parts of a fourth (overlapped and encroached on by a lower set of two smaller incomplete circles), with two pits or cups neither of which is central. To the extreme right there is the trace of a further cup and two circles. For safety the stone has been taken to Father P. Corcoran's house in Kilkerley. It will be kept there temporarily and is open to inspection by those interested. H. G.

The statue-menhir is usually a large boulder with rounded top on which the features of a female figure are crudely indicated with certain details of dress, orna ment and a weapon or implement (probably a knife corresponding to the latter-day scissors as an emblem of housewifery) ; on the back the flowing hair is conventionally represented ; about the waist is a broad girdle or sash. In the numerous examples known to us all conceivable reductions and variations of the above details are to be found, sometimes only the breasts, sometimes little more than the eyes and brows are indicated, and the freestanding boulder may be replaced by a slab, or by the chalk-wall of one of the Marne catacombs. The girdle survives in quite a number and is frequently of the proportions and position of the broad band of the Carrickrobin and New Grange stones. Whether like the Continental figures these stones were felt to represent the Mother Goddess or not is difficult to say ; if so, the rest of the details are exceedingly stylised. This could have resulted through a gradual forgetting of the original design or to the use of poor drawings on skins with a mixing of separate figures, or a misplacing of the sectional patterns. The curvilinear motives would have arisen from the proto-typical figures representing the arms curved upwards on the breast, and from necklaces often in triple folds. The breasts originally indicated by hemispherical figures in relief may be here and at New Grange represented in the same misunderstanding way by cup figures. At the art-stage represented by the stones in question interfusion of various magical or divine figures would be normal and in this class one may place the various cyclic and helical types, spirals, etc. These may have arisen as pure ornament (as the Maltese grouped spirals) or from the influence of mat or basket designs, as the de scendants of the i^Egean octopus used in an apotropaic sense or /and from haruspicial charts showing the conformation of bird or other animal entrails from which omens were read. Such figures dominate the relevant Irish monuments in contradistinction to those of France and even Brittany, and their grafting on to the statue-menhir motive might be expected, and, is possibly illustrated by the two sculptured stones in discussion. It is surprising that no authentic model of the statue-menhir survives since it is clear that the religious conception involved did survive well into the Gaelic period. This fact may indeed furnish the explanation, for if the Christian missionaries found the rites (fertility and memorial in character) still associated with such figures being practised, a vigorous campaign of destruction would explain the absence of truly representational examples. Some actually hold to the view that the Sighle na gCioch type is the late descendant of the older conception, but there is little evidence for this notwithstanding the parity of function. The earlier goddess has been incorrectly defined as a ' goddess of death/ But we have actually to deal with an idealisation and anthropomorphism of Earth with its interchanging seasons of fruitfulness (youth) and barrenness (old age and death). The original type is certainly the Susan goddess of fertility. In passing, attention may be called to a boulder figure at the horsepond in front of Gormanston Castle which is locally known as the ' Granny ' and is conceivably an Irish version of the statue menhir.</page><page sequence="5">Photo] [H.
