The naivete with which many members of our society, including perhaps a few jurists and penologists, regard the relationship be- tween The Law and The Criminal is a source of occasional mis- givings to the reviewer. The Law assumes the form of an autono- mous machine, into which can be fed data of alleged transgressions of specific codes and from which issue infallible and inexorable pronouncements of punishment, which in some mysterious fashion become adequate treatment for that individual and social disease called Crime. The product of the machine, furthermore, is un- touched by human hands; a bit of lubricant (or sand) may be added from time to time by an inspired professional, and the setting of the dials may be readjusted by legislative fiat, but on the whole the machine-tender need not interfere with the intricately-grinding gears. This amazing automaticity is made possible by the fact that the machine utilizes a uniform and static raw material-Criminal Behavior. Criminal Behavior is the natural consequence of the per- versity of The Criminal, which may be counteracted most effec- tively by incarceration or threat of incarceration, the punishment varying proportionally with the degree of perversity as revealed by the seriousness of the Criminal Behavior. Thus is abolished the painful necessity of thinking out a solution of this problem. I suppose that the heavy-handed satire of this description would be rejected indignantly by most citizens who could be persuaded to consider the matter. Certainly those individuals labeled criminals are human beings with much the same system of drives and motives as the rest of us possess; certainly their behavior results from the interaction of a multitude of environmental accidents with an equally- complex physical and cultural organism; certainly these actions are as predictable and controllable as the actions of any human being; certainly no two criminals inherit identical original characteristics or are exposed to the same situational influences; certainly, there- fore, our understanding and control of criminal behavior demand a separate analysis of each unique case. But if the thinking citizen accepts the inferences of flexible and intelligent manipulation of the factors relevant to the lives of criminals and potential criminals, his acceptance is all too frequently at the verbal level. In his every- day and election day behavior he is apt to revert to the principle that the individual criminal is best handled by assembly-line (in some states, Assembly-line) procedures and that protection is most economically insured by means of an impersonal system of graded punishment. A book like Crime and the Human Mind is therefore to be wel- comed for its emphasis upon the individuality of each "criminal"</page><page sequence="2">728 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 31 and the reasonableness of his behavior. If the behavior of the judge and the jury, in court and at home, is the natural consequence of discoverable causal factors (as the psychologist believes), so is the behavior of the man in the dock. If his behavior seems to fly in the face of all the principles of normal behavior, it is only because we know too little of the experiences which have molded his cur- rent system of motivations. The task of the criminologist, which I hope is ultimately to be incorporated into the machination of The Law, is to delineate the unique constellation of forces which activate the individuals, so that appropriate (rather than solely traditional) forces can be added to redirect the stream of undesirable behavior, and so that as far as possible this guidance may be applied in potential cases before the final break with society occurs. This is indeed an individual problem. No two students select a given profession for precisely the same reasons, and so different forms of approach will be necessary if we wish to convince them that their choice has been unwise. Similarly with two embezzlers. Why does one young man select a career of law and another decide on medi- cine? For sets of reasons no more complex and dynamic than those eventuating in rape by one misguided chap and murder by another. The form in which Dr. Abrahamsen presents his ideas is not above criticism. Although he proposes to examine the psychiatric-psycho- logic aspects of the criminal's act, some of his concepts and term- inology are out of line with those commonly used by American psy- chologists. Some psychologists might even hesitate to read beyond the title, with its mention of the "mind" that the psychologists are said to have "lost" 30 years ago, and which Dr. Abrahamsen admits is largely terra incognita. Not only does the psychologist refuse to take the responsibility for such usage, but the legally-trained reader may with reason question the scientific validity of such abstractions as "the racial or collective unconscious" (p. 3), the "mind of the race" (p. 3), and the chronic urge for self-destruction (p. 107); may wonder how many criminals really have a "subconscious need for detection" (p. 33) and if the compulsive setting of fires has sexual significance (p. 106); and may speculate as to what the "instinctual drives" look like as they "are sifted through the ego and superego" (p. 137). It appears that Dr. Abrahamsen is writ- ing not as a psychologist (that is, as one trained in the department of psychology of a representative American university), but as a European psychiatrist with distinct leanings toward the theoretical position of Freudian psychoanalysis. There are other statements which may be questioned on more seri- ous grounds, namely, of lack of evidence, of tautology, or of self- contradiction. We may wonder how the writer defines "infantile," when he asserts that investigations have proved that (all?) crim- inals are infantile (pp. 9-10). How did Lombroso disprove the freedom of the will (p. 10) ? Of what predictive value is the form- T + S ula C =, where C stands for crime, T for tendencies, S R</page><page sequence="3">1945] BOOK REVIEWS 729 for the situation, and R for the individual's mental resistance (p. 27) ? It is stated that persons "with valuable personal traits will rarely yield to criminalistic tendencies" (p. 29), but the reviewer re- calls some very thorough experiments by Hartshorne and May which indicate that an individual honest in many situations (i. e., with reasonably valuable traits) may stray in certain specific situations from the straight-and-narrow as arbitrarily defined by society. The authority on intelligence and its measurement will demand a pre- cise definition of terms before he can accept the unqualified declara- tion that "Persons with a limited mental capacity may be brought up to an average mental level * * *" by exposure to favorable cir- cumstances (p. 36). I have come across nothing in the literature of psychopathology that makes clear the sentence: "Generally, it is easy to decide a person is psychotic if he represents a disintegrated personality, but it may be difficult to determine an individual's men- tal make-up if his personality traits are so intermingled that they render no explicit clue as to his mental condition" (p. 67). On page 118 Dr. Abrahamsen describes the "typical homosexual" but on the next page it turns out that there is no typical homosexual, for a recent investigation "seems to have disproved the claim that there are anthropomorphic differences between the homosexual and the heterosexual individual." I am afraid that false hopes will be raised in the breast of the criminal investigator when the techniques of electroencephalography are urged upon him (p. 215), for thus far there is little evidence recommending this as a fruitful approach to anti-social behavior, even though the brain wave tracing may be as objective a measure (of something-or-other!) as the basal met- abolic rate. Thus, some of the material in this book may be both mysterious to the uninitiated and distressing to the scientist. Yet these objec- tions are relatively trifling, for the salient doctrines ring true. To some readers it may seem that the first nine chapters are too cir- cuitous a path to the excellent concluding chapter. But the effect of the whole is coherent and arresting, and the implications for practical action are inescapable. The criminal behavior of an in- dividual is a function of his unique personality, which is in large part dependent upon the nature of the environment in which he has learned his repertoire of responses. Frequently, of course, the per- sonality pattern is so warped that the criminal is absolved of legal responsibility; in many other instances, in spite of the absence of juristic precedent, he is really no more "responsible," in a natural- istic sense. But in all cases the criminal act can be understood as purposive or adaptive. Frequently its motivation is obscure to the objective observer because of his failure to interpret the act in the light of the whole personality pattern; sometimes the motive can- not be expressed even by the offender. Only to a very limited extent is punishment anything more than treatment of surface symptoms, for it seldom can have a favorable effect in rearranging the underlying causal factors. There is no universal cure for anti- social behavior any more than there is for all physical ailments, and</page><page sequence="4">730 VIRGINIA LAW REVIEW [Vol. 31 the treatment of a specific offense must be in terms of its relation to the culprit's subjective world of values. As therapy in medicine should be secondary to hygiene, so in criminology the preventative aspect must be underlined as the most practical solution of the prob- lem. "* * * the largest number of criminals could, under favor- able conditions, have developed into normal persons" (p. 47). A "criminal hygiene" movement might well highlight the following objectives in its program: (a) every individual should have access to adequate biological satisfaction; (b) every individual has the right to a satisfactory home life, with the aim of developing a feel- ing of emotional security and the establishment of positive forms of inter-personal response; (c) guidance clinics are to be provided as an aid to the development of an integrated set of vocational and emotional goals; and (d) the institutions with which the individual has contact must strive to give him a maturing sense of real par- ticipation in and responsibility to society. As has been suggested, issue can be taken with Dr. Abrahamsen on many points of his discussion. But his basic premise that an insight into personality is a requisite for the understanding of the criminal's behavior is incontrovertible. Legislation cannot alter psychological fact, and a study of criminal codes is barren without some knowledge of the medical and social sciences. The signifi- cance of this for the training and thinking of the lawyer, the legis- lator, and the intelligent citizen, should be obvious. Frank W. Finger* CHAR.LOTZSVILLZ, VA.</page></plain_text>
