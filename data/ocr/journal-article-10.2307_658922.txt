CHAMBERLAIN GENERAL Azoulay (Dr) Sur la manibre dont a et6 constitu' le muse phonographique de la Socidt6 d'Anthropologie. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 305-320.) Account of the origin and development of the Phono- graphic Museum of the Anthropological Society, the foundation of which, on the suggestion of Dr Azoulay, was ap- proved May 3, 19oo00. The difficulties and imperfections of technique are noted. Phonograms of no fewer than 70 languages, dialects, and patois have now been collected. Among the speci- mens recorded are African war-songs, an Avar recitation from the Koran, the death-wail of the women of Oueled- Nail, the beginning of the Kalevala in Finnish, a Syrian reconciliation-song, etc. These records belong to what Dr Azoulay calls " the higher eth- nography." Gray (J.) Cephalometric instruments and cephalograms. (Journ. Anthrop. Inst., London, 1901, xxxI, II1-115.) General description (with directions how to use) of callipers and cephalo- graphs devised by the author. The first is on the sliding principle; the first kind of cephalograph on the prin- ciple of the pitch chain, the second one " in which contact plates are pressed against the head by radial pistons actu- ated by compressed air." The paper is accompanied by 3 plates and a figure showing the instruments in question and also " cephalograms," or outlines of the contour of the head obtained by them. Says the author of his investi- gations: " The results, however, show a considerable resemblance between persons of the same people and habitat." Gy. Der Transport und die Aufrichtung schwerer. Korper in vorgeschichtlicher Zeit. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 192-193.) Brief rdsumd, with 4 text- figures, of Watkins' article in the Smith- sonian Report for 1898. Klaatsch (H.) Ueber die Ausprigung der specifisch menschlichen Merkmale in unserer Vorfahrenreihe. (Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Miinchen, 1901, XXXII, 102-108.) The author discusses the upright position, the hand and foot, etc. Among the theses maintained by Dr Klaatsch are the fol- lowing: The human hand is not the transformed fore-limb of a quadruped, but a primitive inheritance from the common ancestry of man and the mam- mals; the common ancestry of the mammals and man had a half-erect position,-the majority of the mam- mals have become quadrupeds; the human foot is distinguished from the primitive form only by a secondary strengthening of the first toe to a great toe; the climbing-mechanism of the ancestor of man, as contrasted with that of the anthropoids, is one for as- cending single trees, not for climbing and moving from branch to branch in the thick forest, etc. This paper should be read in connection with that of Schoetensack. Kohlbriigge (J. H. F.) Gehirnwig- ungen. (Monatschr. f. Psychiatrie u. Neurol., Berlin, 19o0, x, 212-213.) Gives the body-weight, height, brain- weight, proportionate weight of brain to body, of 13 Semnopitheci from Java, two Macaci from Borneo, two Semno- pitheci from Borneo, a Hylobates and an Orang-utang from Borneo, a Cereo- pithecus from Java, a Sciurus notatus and a Tapaja javanica from Java, and a Cuscus orientalis from Ceram. The percentage of brain-weight to body- weight in the Semnopithecus maurus varied from o.6 to 1o.5. Lefdbure (E.) L'arc-en-ciel. (M6lusine, Paris, 1901, x, 193-199.) Concluding section of detailed discussion of the rainbow in poetry, dealing with the poets of classical antiquity. 153</page><page sequence="3">154 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Letourneau (C.) La,femme A travers les ages. (Rev. de l'Ecole d'Anthr. de Paris, go90, x, 273-290.) Under the following headings the author discusses the condition of woman past, present, and future : Before woman, the primary clans and their influence, the forma- tion of the " feminine" type, female subjection in marriage and the family, woman's mentality, the future of woman. The Pitkecanthropus (" the first man and the last monkey at one and the same time ") was so constituted physically and socially that the labors and duties of the sexes were not greatly divergent, and woman assuch did not yet exist. With the development of the clan and the spread of war " the weaker sex" ended by becoming Sman's domestic animal." This brought on gradually the development of a real "feminine type," and its reduction to the one career of mar- riage. Since all but the most primitive times woman has been more or less oppressed and exploited by man,-by turns beast of burden, slave, minor, subject, instrument of pleasure, ignor- ant companion. But the signs of her future equality with man in education, marriage, the family, society, are abundant and unmistakable. Then a natural equilibrium will be created and together men and women will transform social institutions, without woman be- coming less woman, while man will become more human. But there will always be a few " feminine men " and a few " masculine women." But evo- lution concerns itself with the mutual relations of the men and women of the real sort. Lovett (E.) The ancient and modern game of astragals. (Folk-Lore, Lon- don, 1901, XII, 280-293.) Treats of the game of " knuckle-bones," ancient and modern, the materials used, the rules, terms, names of the game, etc. Details are given of " chuckies," as played in Scotland, knuckle-bone as played in Switzerland, " snobs," as played in Der- byshire, " knuckledowns," as played in Essex, "dabbers," as played in Bucks. The Gujeratigameof oockarddo, played with tamarind seeds, is said to be the nearest Indian analogue of " knuckle-bone." In Switzerland, "we get a king, queen, jack (or knave), and pawns-a remarkable mixture of cards, chess, and astragals," while in Ger- many are to be found " the most prosaic and uninteresting machine-made ma- terials for this ancient game. Lumbroso (A.) Note sul numero 13 (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo, 1901, XX, 46-47.) Brief notes on superstitions, concerning the number 13. Cites opinions of Victor Hugo and M. Deschanel, the French parliamentarian. Mendenhall (T. C.) A mechanical solu- tion of a literary problem. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1901, LX, 47-105.) An attempt to identify authorship by ''study of the relative frequencies of the use of words of different lengths," with special reference to the Bacon-Shakespeare "theory." The curves plotted for Shakespeare and Bacon show "extraor- dinary differences," those for Beau- mont and Fletcher resemble closely Shakespeare's, while those of Marlowe are almost the same as his. von Negelein (J.) Das Pferd in der Volksmedizin. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 201-204.) General ac- count, with numerous references to lit- erature, of the horse in folk-medicine. Among the topics considered are cura- tive power of the body, head, flesh, milk, excreta, hoof, tail, hair, etc., com- panionship with the horse, etc. The excreta of the horse have an important r6le in Teutonic folk-thought. Horse- hair also has a wide field of supersti- tion. The skull of the horse is like- wise the center of many folk-beliefs. - Die Reise der Seele ins Jenseits. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, XI, 263-27 .) This third section treats of " attempts to hinder the return of the soul." Treatment of the corpse, arrangement of the house and contents, obliterating, blocking, etc., the path over which the dead was carried, tying the corpse's feet together, changing the door, carrying the corpse through a hole made in the wall or roof and afterward closed up, are some of the devices em- ployed. Peet (S. D.) Age and distribution of the monuments. (Amer. Antiq., Chi- cago, 19o0, XXIII, 291-306.) General discussion, with many illustrations, of the monuments of the Stone Age. Kitchen middens, lake-dwellings and crannogs, chambered tombs, chambered cairns, dolmens, are treated of more or less briefly.</page><page sequence="4">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 155 Peet (S. D.) Religious influence on an- cient art and architecture. (Ibid., 339- 551.) Treats in a general way, with il- lustrations, of Babylonian and Egyptian pyramids, Persian palaces, Phrygian tombs, rock-cut temples, etc., of India and Malaysia. Poteat (W. L.) Lucretius and the evo- lution idea. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1901, Lx, 166-173.) The author notes among other things Lucretius' " repre- sentation of childhood as the first hu- manizing influence, the origin and growth of language, religious beliefs and social order, the development of industries and of art, until the poet him- self appears ' to consign the deeds of men to verse.' " Ranke (J.) Ueber den Zwischenkiefer. (Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Mtinchen, 1901, xxxIT, 96-102.) Dis- cusses, with II text figures, the inter- maxillary bone and its occurrence in the lower animals, the anthropoids, and man. The conclusion arrived at is that " the double intermaxillary bone belongs to the general structure of the verte- brate (mammalian especially) skulls, but only among the lowest mammals and in man do its elementary components reach a more numerous individualization." Schuchardt (H.) Sichel und Sige; Sichel und Dolch. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 181-187, 204-209.) In this interesting and valuable article (with 31 text-figures) Dr Schuchardt discusses from an archeological and linguistic standpoint the sickle, saw, and dagger in ancient and modern times, their names in the various European languages, etc. As the toothed sickle is related to the saw, so is the smooth sickle to the knife, and the tool passes over into all sorts of sickle-like weapons, from the very curved affair of the Abys- sinians to the yataghan. The author considers the family of weapon-names to which English dagger belongs to be all derived from Latin daca, "a (Dacian) sword," from whose diminutive daculus, a larger number of Romance words have also sprung. Starr (F.) Notes upon the mandrake. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, xxIII, 259-268.) Treats of superstitions con- cerning the mandrake and its virtues, its anthropomorphic and sex characters, etc., among the peoples of antiquity, Germans, English, Slavs, Chinese, He- brews. Today "the center of man- drake superstitions appears to be Asia Minor." Thomas (A. C.) Mythology: a short presentation of the subject. (Ibid., 316-319.) Among other things the author believes that " the New World myths establish a visit of one or two white men at some very early date, these men coming presumably to teach the Christian religion," and that " there is some connection between the Bible and mythology." Thorndike (E. L.) The evolution of the human intellect. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1901, LX, 58-65.) Author con- cludes in this general discussion that man's intellect is " a simple though extended variation from the general animal sort, presaged by the similar variation in the case of the monkeys." The mind of man, therefore, leads among the minds of animals, " not as a demigod from another planet, but as a king from the same race." The men- tality of monkeys and children is briefly referred to. TissiM (P.) La science du geste. (Rev. Scient., Paris, 1901, 4e s., XVI, 289- 300.) Discusses the relations between cerebration and musculation in man, physical education, etc. Dr Tissid maintains that the "emotion of art," and not the excitation of combat" should be the key-word of physical education, which is not an athletic means but a philosophic end. Vaschide (N.) et H. Pidron. Le rave prophetique dans les croyances et les traditions des peuples sauvages. (Bull. et Mem Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 19o0, Ve S., II, 194-205.) An attempt at rdsum'ing in general fashion our knowl- edge about the dream in primitive re- ligion and folk-thought, with special reference to its mystical side. Examples of the beliefs of savages in all quarters of the globe are cited. The authors consider that " belief in. the prophetic value of dreams inherent in the first manifestations of the human mind is one of the most important factors in the mental condition of the races of man, in the beginning and through the ages." - Contribution A la simdiologie du reve. (Ibid., 293-300.) Resumes 13 observations of dreams of children, adults, and aged persons, suffering from</page><page sequence="5">I56 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.

Virchow (R.) Ueber den prahistorischen Menschen und Uiber die Grenzen zwi- schen Species und Varietit. (Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Muinchen, 1901, XXXII, 83-91.) Deals chiefly with the peculiarities of the Neander- thal skull, the craniology of the Ainos, Frisians, etc. Dr Virchow warns against drawing revolutionary conclusions from individual characteristics. - Die Markh6h]e in Mammuthkno- chen.

General discussion with results of measurements of 1,594 males over 20 of British descent. Author thinks that " the insane, criminal, and ' neuropathic' tend to be more dolicho- cephalic than the race from which they spring," and that " comparative doli. chocephaly means inferiority, while comparative brachycephaly is the hall- mark of mental superiority" ; also that there is in process a general evolution toward brachycephaly, all opinions finding large countenance in certain quarters. Woodruff (C. E.) An anthropological study of the small brain of civilized man and its evolution. (Amer. Journ. Insan., Baltimore, 1901, LVIII, 1-40.) An elaborate and ingenious marshaling (with tables and charts) of paleonto- logical, archeological, historical, socio- logical, cultural, somatolo gical1, ontogenetic and racial, linguistic and other evidence in favor of the theory that " man's brain developed by the laws of natural selection during hun- dreds of thousands of years, the 'fit- test' variations in each generation being the most intelligent. This pro- cess must have ceased in central Eu- rope about 20,000 to 40,000 years ago when the average skull was at its maxi- mum. Since then civilization has made it more and more possible for brains smaller than the average to be as 'fit' for survival as the larger, so that civi- lization gradually checks further evolu- tion of brain growth and replaces it by greater and greater normal surviving variations. Hence, for the last 20,000 years the average size and weight of the brain have been diminishing, yet vari- ations are getting normally farther from the average, and the longer civili- zation lasts the more certain it is that we will find larger brains than have ever existed before, and an increasing number of specimens below the average of the present lowest and smallest- skulled races. The change to modern conditions has been, of course, so slow that appreciable differences may have not occurred until the last 2,000 years." Dr Woodruff also holds that man de- veloped in the north where the very slow and gradual approach of the long cold of the glacial period found him a highly intelligent animal, who, as it receded, became a brainy man. Present civili- zation results from the fact that culture first arose in the south, whither the ear- liest men migrated from the north and where " evolution took the direction of dependent specialization." Then " the belated bigger and brainier men of the north . . . evolved their own civi- lization . . . and, when they re- ceived some hints from the south, they carried civilization to its present posi- tion." Brain made civilization, not civilization brain. In the post-plio- cene a rapid evolution of brain took place, and the " missing links" disap- peared. Early cessation of the process of natural selection of the brainiest "has been the eternal damnation of the people of southern Asia; they are fixed forever." The earliest to migrate southward were the earliest to develop civilization and the earliest to become "fixed." Hence only the Teutonic and the Mediterranean long-headed races</page><page sequence="6">PERIODICAL LITERATURE 157 Woodruff-Continued. have survived best and developed best -the former now rules the world. Its rule is due to the fact that "it came latest out of the north." It has reaped the advantage of all that its predecessors have done. Modern specialism is the result of selection of variations and not of acquired modifications, and explains many paradoxes in modern life. Vari- ation followed migration from the north, and the rate of movement in these suc- cessful migrations must have been very slow, for "rapid migrations are fol- lowed by extinction, there being no such process as acclimatization." The lower races are effectually barred out of real competition with the higher. EUROPE Amalfi (G.) Novelluzze raccolte in Te- giano, Prov. di Salerno. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo, 19ol, xx, 34-45.) Numbers 6-12 of folk- tales from Tegiano in Salerno, with notes and indications of parallels else- where. Anutschin (D. N.) Ergebnisse der an- thropologischen Erforschung R uss - lands. (Globus, Brnschwg., I90r, LXXX, 249-253, 269-273.) This excel- lent resume of the anthropology of Rus- sia is translated from Dr Anutschin's article in the Russian Encyclopedic Dictionary. After a brief historical introduction, the following topics are considered : Racial and other influences upon stature, color of hair and eyes, craniology, Russian and central Asian ethnology, brain-weights, etc. The primitive home of the Slavonic Rus- sians seems to have been in southwest- ern Russia, and by the time they began the colonizpition of European and Asiatic Russia they were already heterogeneous anthropologically. The mixture with the Turkic (partly Tranic) and Gothic peoples in the south has had different results from that with the Ugro-Finnish peoples of the north. Both by race-contact and by conditions of environment the differences between the " Great Russians" and the " Little Russians" have been increased. In Siberia the intermixture has reduced the stature, darkened the color, and made more prominent the cheek-bones, -in the Transbaikal region one can see together pure Russians, pure Buryats and m/tis. That a considerable varia- ation in stature is characteristic of the Slavonic peoples (over and above race- mixture) is evident,-the extremes are the " Little Russians" and the Poles. The difference in stature in favor of urban population does not hold for all the large cities (e. g., Warsaw). The recruit measurements for 1874-1885 seem to indicate in European Russia a retrogression in stature, but its exact nature is not yet apparent. Iri Russia brunettism increases toward the south and east. In early prehistoric times dolichocephaly was the rule in Russia, but a brachycephalic element appears during the Stone Age. Since then the population of Russia has been much mixed with western European, western and central Asiatic elements, both long - heads and short - heads. The studies of the brains of the various races of Russia indicate that the aver- age brain-weight of the Slavonic peo- ples is somewhat less than that of the non-Slavonic. Arenaprimo (G.) Dal giovedi al venerdi santo in Messina. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo, 19oI, xx, 96- IoI.) Brief account of the ceremonies of Holy Thursday night in Messina.

Reports (in brief) on archeological activity in various regions of Austria during 1900oo, by Straberger (Upper Austria), Petter (Salzburg), Jenny (Vorarlberg), Frankl (Carinthia), de Marchesetti (Trieste and littoral), Hovorka (Dalmatia, etc.), Cermik and Zelizko (Bohemia), Rzehak and Blansko (Moravia), Kaindl (Bukowina). Bertholot (M.) Sur une lampe prehis- torique trouvde dans la grotte de la Mouthe. (C. R. Acad. d. Sci., Paris, 19o0, cxxxIiI, 666.) From the ex- amination of the substance coating the inside of the stone lamp discovered by *M. Rivibre in the prehistoric station of La Mouthe, the author concludes that the material used for lighting was of animal origin, tallow or lard. Bervi (N. V.) 0 brabotka antropo- litcheskich nabludenii pri pomostchi teorii vyeroyatnostei. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1901, II, No. I, 41- 72.) Treats of the theory of proba- bility in anthropology. Bloch (A.) L'homme prdhistorique d'apres Buffon. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthrop. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 291-293.) The author cites from Buf- fon's " Supplement " to his " Natural History," his description of prehistoric man,-the volume in question was published in 1778. Buffon's description relates only to the Stone Age " but tells more about it than the authors who preceded him." Bliimml (E. K.) Vier Pestmittel des xvIIi. Jahrhunderts. (Mitth.d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 1901, XXX, 223-224.) Brief account, with text of prescrip- tions, of four remedies against the plague from a medicine-book (Ms.) of 1761 preserved in the Museum Fran- cisco-Carolinum at Linz in Upper Austria. Bolte (J.) Ein dinisches Mirchen von Petrus und dem Ursprunge der b6sen Weiber. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volks- kunde, Berlin, 1901or, XI, 252-262.) Dis- cussion, with resume from a folk-book of the 17th century, of the source and ramifications of a Danish tale of " the origin of the bad women." The tale is akin to the many satirical stories found in the Orient about the weakness and wickedness of woman and her origin (by transformation, etc.) from the lower animals. In some of the tales Jesus, St Peter, etc., figure as the transformers. Breiul (H.) See Capitan (L.). Calliano (G.) Zur Ethnographie des alten nieder-isterreichischen Wohn- hauses. (Sitzgber. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 1900, 205-215.) An interesting account, with 20 text-figures, of the Lower Austrian dwelling-house. The oldest house-form, material (stone and wood), ornamentation and ornament- motifs, favorite colors, house-inscrip- tions, old dress, etc., are treated in more or less detail. The oldest form of the house in this region (outside of that revealed by the prehistoric " hut- urns") is a simple, four-cornered wooden structure, which remained the typical one until stone-building was in- troduced by the Romans (and for a long time after that the stone house was one- roomed). Besides lines and geometric figures the ornamental motifs include figures of sun, moon, stars, heart, clover-leaf, etc. The " gable-man " is also very interesting, as also are the "' house marks."

Pop., Palermo, go9I, xx, 88-95.) Second section of article dealing with the Passion Play at Ob- erammergau. Deals with the history of the subject. It is worth noting here that Wetzstein's bibliography of the Oberammergau Passion Play enumer- ates some 2oo German, 14 English, and 5 French works, all belonging to the I9th century. The great public in- terest in this Passion Play dates only from 1830. Chamberlain (A. F.) Domestic animals of the lake-dwellers. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, xxIII, 268-270.)

(Rev. de l'Ecole d'Anthr. de Paris, 19goo, X1, 363-372.) The de- fective stability of neolithic pottery, due to the conformation of the base, led to the adoption of various expedi- ents (suspending the vessels, or add- ing to them feet, or hollowed out supports of some sort or other). To use such supports of terra-cotta or stone on which to place the more finely made and rounded vessels, may be regarded as a distinct advance over the ruder flat-bottomed pottery, which stood readily of itself. The article is illus- trated by 8 text-pictures of such sup- ports from various parts of France and Switzerland. Some of these supports are of very elegant construction and ornamentation. They seem to deteri- orate with the age of bronze. Musatti (C.) I gridi di Venezia. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo, 1901, xx, 72-87.) An interesting col- lection of the street-cries of Venice, with explanatory notes and comments.

During the neolithic period the population on river-plateaus was quite dense. The exploitation of iron-ore is pre-Roman. Pitr&amp; (G.) Di una Sacra Rappresenta- zione in Monreale nel 1793.

Nos. 75- 121 of songs (pastorals, love songs, etc.) in the Jura patois with phonetic tran- scriptions, notes, and indication of music. The comparison of many of these songs with old French folk-songs, and especially with the patois-literature of Montbeliard, shows the close rela- tionship existing between the Jura and Franche-Comt6. Of several of the songs a number of versions are given containing many interesting variations. Rozanov (V. N.) Ginekomastiya. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1900, I, NO. IV, 21-36.) In this article, which is illustrated by 5 text-figures and accom- panied by numerous bibliographical references, the author risumis the chief literature of the subject of gynaeco- mastia and reports his own observations (the anthropometric details of one case are given at page 34).

Geographie, 1901, XIII, 5-52.) Treats, with details of measurement and de- scription, the osseous remains of neo- lithic man (4 skeletons and skulls, a cranium, etc.) from Chamblandes, near Lausanne. From the " funeral arti- cles" discovered in the graves the remains at Chamblandes seem to be much older than those at Chitelard and Montagny sur Lutry. Certain points about them suggest a likeness to the re- mains from Moravia, the region of the Dniester, etc., discussed in 1895-1898 by Zaborowski. The men of Cham- blandes seem to have been, not very tall, well-muscled, dolichocephalic, or partly sub-dolichocephalic (the result of mingling of two races?).

An interesting discussion of Romance loan-words in Basque. Such words are makil (bacil- lum), artoa (hart6n in Spanish Gypsy dialect), quisalire (Spanish crisuelo), arruda (Bearnese arronde), whence the diminutive ardalz.

Pop., Paris, I901, XVT, 281-292.) Brief account of the district folklore Congress held at Abbeville in May, 19O0, in accordance with the resolution of the International Congress of 19oo00. Sm61ski (G.) 0 Kaszubach nadlebiani- skich. (Wisia, Warszawa, I190, xv, 320-339.) Continuation of account of the Kassubes of the region of Lake Leba. Speakman (Jean C. G.) Midsummer in the Pyrenees. (Folk Lore, London, 1901, XII, 315-317.) Brief account of the ceremony of the building and burn- ing of the Brandon at Bagn res de Luchon in the department of Haute Garonne, a curious survival of sacrifice and a strange combination of Chris- tianity and paganism. Sperino (G.) L'encefalo dell' anatomo Carlo Giacomini. (Riv. Sperim. di Fren., Reggio, I901, xxvII, 146-171, 548-581.) Details of examination of the brain of Giacomini, the well-known Italian anatomist, who died in 1898. The gyrus supramarginalis of the left hemisphere and the gyrus angularis of the right were particularly prominent. But the most noteworthy feature was the presence of a double fissure of Ro- lando, a peculiarity which Giacomini himself was about the first to describe. Its occurrence in a man of Giacomini's sanity and intellect is a blow to the ultra-Lombrosoan school. Stalin (G.) Curieux disques prdhisto- riques. (Rev. de l'Ecole d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, x, 326.) Brief description of ten chalk discs found some years ago at Mouy in the department of Oise. The author thinks they may have been intended for weights. von Stenin (P.) Die neuen Forschungen tuber die Baschkiren. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 150-157.) Resumes, with 6 text-illustrations, the recent investigations of Nikolsky in particular. Population, physical char- acters, houses and tents, folk-life, clothing, food, religion, burials, wed- dings, marriage, birth, education, fes- tivals, musical instruments, agriculture, hunting and fishing are briefly referred to. As to the origin of the Bashkirs, the author agrees with Bogdanoff, that "not only not the last, but not even the first word has been spoken." The Smountain Bashkirs " and the ' steppe Bashkirs differ in certain particulars,- the majority, however, lead a "nno- madic life" during the summer, but this " nomadic life" is now becoming largely fictitious. The Bashkirs are great consumers of tea,--" quite often a Bashkir will empty 50 to 60 cups at one meal." The native mollahs are engaged in a campaign against brandy and tobacco. The Bashkirs are Mo- hammedans, but generally non-fanati- cal. Polygamy is rare, but divorces are common. The school-attendance, both of boys and girls, is much greater proportionately among the Bashkirs than among the Russians, and the Mo- hammedan clergy are zealous for edu- cation. The attempt of the Russian authorities to force a change to agri- culturists in this still nomadic people has, Dr von Stenin thinks, been not at all a success. Plundering wild honey and hunting the wolf are even now more to their taste. Stoll (0.) Die Erhebungen tiber Volks- medizin in der Schweiz. (Schweiz. Arch. f. Volkskunde, Zuirich, 19O, v, 157-200.) Details for a questionnaire- investigation of Swiss folk-medicine, with introductory remarks and general comments. The investigations are to be carried on under the auspices of the Swiss Folklore Society. The rubrics enumerated by Dr Stoll cover every possible aspect of the subject. Strobl (J.) Von der diluvialen Fund- stelle auf dem Hundssteig in Krems. (Sitzgber. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 1901, 42-49.) Describes, with 32 text-figures, the investigations carried on in I90o-190oi at the diluvial " find" on the Hundssteig at Krems, where a considerable body of primitive men ap- pear to have been long settled.

(Ibid., 1900, 189-197.) Report on the Paris Congress of 19oo, with special reference to papers, collections, etc., illustrative of the remains of prehistoric man in France. Funde aus einem neu endeckten vorgeschichtlichen Bergbau im Ender- Sinkweik am Salzberg bei Hallstatt. (Ibid., 203-205.) Brief accounts of the finds (fragments of clothing, sacks, bones, etc.) in a new prehistoric "9mine" in the Hallstatt salt mountain. The Salzberg appears to be remarkably free from evidences of Roman civiliza- tion. The cretinism of Hallstatt has diminished, according to a remark of the author, since the workpeople have ceased using old salt-casks to put their little children in during their absence on the Salzberg. Talko-Gryntzevitch (Y. D.) Polyaki. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1901, 11, NO. I, 1-30.) In this paper, which is illustrated by 14 text-figures of an- thropological types, contains many an- thropometric data, and is accompanied by a good bibliography (pages 28-30), the author outlines the anthropology of the Poles (history, statistics, physical type, etc.). The mountaineers of Ta- tra are thought to be the best repre- sentatives of the Polish physical type. Tetzner (F.) Finnisch-ugrische volks- kundliche Studien. (Globus, Brnsch wg., 1901, LXXX, 233-235.) Chiefly a criti- cal resume of Krohn's recent study of Finnish " magic songs." Dr Tetzner emphasizes the influence of early Chris- tianity upon the Finno-Ugrian peoples, holding, with Krohn, that the magic poetry of the Finns has not yet been proved to be primitive with them. Teutsch (J.) Priihistorische Funde aus dem Burzenlande. (Mitth. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, g190, xxx, 189-202.) Gives, with 156 text-figures and one colored plate, the results of the archeo- logical activities of the author since March, 1897, in the southeastern part of Transylvania, the region immediately adjoining the city of Kronstadt,-the "Burzenland" as it is called,-in par- ticular. Fragments of pottery, clay- objects, implements of stoneand copper, artefacts of bone, figures of animals and human beings, etc., are discussed. The most of the specimens are from the late neolithic settlements around Kron- stadt. From the Gesprengberg and the Priesterhtigel numbers of " idols'" in clay (animal and human figures) were obtained, most of which are of two pieces set together before harden- ing. The author concludes that the culture represented by the Priester- higel remains (late Stone age and early Metal period) was considerably influ- enced by iEgean art. Thurman (J.) PargasmAlets ljud- ock formlira. (Svenska Landmalen, Stock- holm, 1900oo, xv, NO. 4, 1-175.) Treatise on the phonology and grammatical characteristics of the dialect of Pargas in Finland, a district which in 1898 counted 5,725 people speaking Swedish and 1,576 who used Finnish. The essay was a thesis for Ph.D. at Helsingfors. Tobler (G.) Der Salzbrunnen von Rig- gisberg. (Schweiz. Arch. f. Volks- kunde, Ziirich, 901oI, v, 228-242.)

Witches have many epithets among the southern Slavs. Ward (J.) Five-Wells tumulus, Derby- shire. (Reliquary, London, I901, vii, 229-242.) Gives an account, with 14 text-figures, of explorations carried on in August, 1899, and October-Novem- ber, 1900oo. Mound, galleries, cham- bers, contents are described. The mound itself was " built of thinly- bedded quarried limestones." The chambers, though of unusual form, have their analogues in the surrounding region. From the accounts of these and previous explorations of this re- markable tumulus of the bronze age, it appears that besides "remains of about 12 persons," calcined human bones (something rare in this district), fragments of pottery, flint implements, etc., were discovered in it. The crania seem to have been typically long-headed. There are proofs also of secondary in- terments within the mound. Weinberg (P.) K' voprosu ob ispolin- skom' rosty?. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1901, II, No. I, 31-40.) Treats, with three text-figures (of the subjects), two cases of giantism (poly- sarcia) in children,-8 years and 3 months, and 6 years and Io months old. Their heights are 1,356 and I,232 mm. respectively, their weights 198 and 16o pounds. Weinhold (K.) Sagen vom Riibezahl. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, XI, 336-337.) Seven brief tales of Rtibezahl collected in Bohemia by a German student in 1882. Wichmann (Dr) Ueber die Verbrei- tung und Bestimmung der Mare in Lothringen. (Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Mtinchen, 1901, xxxII, 78.) Brief discussion of the Mare (Mardellen or Mertel), as certain round depressions found in Germany, France, England, etc., are called. The author estimates that 5,000 such exist in the forests of Lorraine. They are thought to be the places upon which the round huts of the prehistoric inhabitants were once built. Widossichi (G.) Lettere folkloriche al Dott. G. Pitre. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Palermo, 1901o, xx, 51-59.) This first part of a series of "folklore letters" addressed to Dr Pitre contains the text of 27 brief " canti infantili " from Venetian Istria, with introductory notes and biblio- graphical references. The author remarks as generally absent in child- poetry the three elements that set folk- songs a-going,-the historical, the esthetic, and the mythical, although the last not infrequently has its last refuge in children's formulae. It may be said "the man no longer under- stands and forgets, the child does not try to understand and remembers." Wiercieiski (H.) Przycznek do osiad- fosci kraju naszego.

Anthrop., 1901, 194-201.) Treats, with two text-figures, of the monolith, or "high stone," of D8ben, which, the author is inclined to believe, marks an old cult-locus, such as Tacitus describes,-an Irmensfl perhaps. Wolfram (Dr) Die riumliche Entwicke- lung von Metz. (Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., MUnchen, 1901, xxxII, 67-70.) A brief account of the spatial development of the city of Metz, the Civitas ?Mediomatricorum of the Ro- mans, from the earliest times down to the present. Of the old Celtic town no remains are preserved; the Roman wall was pulled down in 1233. In the year 1552 a good part of Metz was razed by Karl V. The favor of the present Ger- man Emperor is relied upon for the re- acquisition of what was then lost and never since regained. - Die Entwickelung der Nationali- titen und der nationalen Grenzen in Lothringen. (Ibid., 78-82.) Discusses the development of nationalities and of national frontiers in Lorraine. The evidence from personal and place names is referred to.

Origines des popu- lations anciennes et actuelles de la Russie meridionale et du Caucase. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1901, 4e s., xlV, 385-393.) Resume of our knowledge concerning the peoples past and present of southern Russia and the Caucasus, including especially the researches of M. de Baye,-the crania were turned over to M. Zaborowski for particular study. The author holds that the first peopling of southern Russia took place from Europe (central, or north); that the population of that country was al- ways of the blond race indigenous to Europe; that the man of the oldest kurgans of southern Russia, the man of Mentone, and the man of Cro-Magnon had a common ancestry; and that the first introducers of civilization into southern Russia were the Egeans, relics of whose culture have been found in various parts of this region.

The author, who is a missionary among the Marotse, gives an account of a journey in July-August, 1898, from Naloloto the Victoria Falls on the Zambezi, called by the natives Mosioatunya. The canoes of the Zambezians and their construction, the physical characters of the negroid population, etc., are briefly touched upon. Buchs (V.) De Port-Said ' Aden. (Ibid., 58-83.)

Inst., Toronto, 1901, viI, 29-102.) The au- thor, who is well known by his at- tempts to discover in the Amerinds the descendants of many European and Asiatic peoples of old-time, advances in this lengthy article the theses that the language of the Canarians was of Celtic stock, that " the larger part of the Peru- vian vocabularies are Celtic," that " the Peruvian Aymaras are the Mexican Olmecs under a larger designation," that " these Celts [of America] came from the Canary islands, where they and Iberians once dwelt side by side, and from which as Olmecs and Toltecs they migrated in company." By an in- genious system of syllabic equivalences Dr Campbell "proves" his case lin- guistically and is satisfied. An im- mense amount of energy was wasted on this paper. In the " Transactions and Proceedings of the Royal Society of Canada " (1900oo, vi, sec. 2, 205-265) the same author had a somewhat simi- lar paper with the title "Mexican Colonies from the Canary Islands traced by Language." To both papers are ap- pended numerous comparative vocabu- laries. Chibbaro (L.) Le donne di Tunisi. (Arch. p. 1. Stud. d. Trad. Pop., Pa- lermo, 19or0, xx, 60-63.) Brief general account of women and their life in Tunis. Moors, negresses, and Jewesses are briefly referred to. The Moorish women are less moral than the Jewish. Christol (F.)

Contains some Basuto place- names with explanations. Esquisse sur l'art chez les n4gres du sud de l'Afrique. (Ibid., 141- 147.) The author, a missionary at Hermon, treats briefly of the art of the Bushmen, Congo and Zambezian ne- groes, etc. A spoon from the Congo, a Zambezian ivory pin with elephants carved at the head, a Haussa axe, an Angolese knife, a wooden pillow, a mat, the figure of a war-galley, etc., are referred to. The article has three pages of illustrations,-one full-page reproducing the colored cave-painting by Bushmen from Manholong. The Basuto, M.

Treats of the royal residence at Mandlakazi, the private life of King Gungungyan, the coronation, the army and its ceremonies, " war medicine" ceremony, the royal dances called nkwaya, the umteto, or popular as- sembly, domestic and foreign policy of the king, fall and exile of Gungungyan. An interesting account is given of the " last potentate of South Africa," Gun- gungyan the Zulu, who since his fall in 1895, has been in exile on the Azores, where he was sent after being shown through the streets of Lisbon in old Roman fashion. The author was medi- cal missionary at Mandlakazi. Lortet (M.) et Hugotinenq (M.) Re- cherches sur les poissons momifids de l'ancienne Egypte. (C. R. Acad. d. Sci., Paris, I9o0, cxxxIII, 613-616.) Brief account of the mummified fish of the ancient Egyptians. The Lates nilotus was a sacred fish, of which at Esneh and other places there was a special cult,-hence in the Graeco- Roman period Esneh came to be called Latopolis. Some of these fish are well- preserved although now at least 2,500 years old. Substances obtained from the natron-lakes and a covering of salty earth in which they were encased mummified them. - et Gaillard (M.), Les oiseaux momifids de 1'ancienne Egypte. (Ibid., 854-856.) Gives results of the exami- nation of more than 1,ooo bird-mum- mies from various parts of ancient Egypt now in the Lyons Museum. Two classes of bird-mummies are noted,-the sacred ibis and birds of prey (of these 38 species are listed). The ibis is mummified singly, the birds of prey sometimes in masses of 20-30 or even 40 together. Meinhof(C.) Ndalama. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1o90, 192-194.) The author traces the Bantu word ndarama or ndalama, "money," through Arabic dirhem (plur. darahim) to the Greek 8paXy '. The account of this alleged loan-word is very interesting. Myers (C. S.)

(Corrbl. d. deutschen Ges. f. Anthr., Mtinchen, 1901, XXXII, 112-117.) The author, who was the companion of the late Dr Passavant for some i4 years in the Cameroons, gives the results of his ob- servations of the Duala negroes. Physi- cal characters, hair-dressing, tattooing, child- birth, treatment of children, language, numerals, games, use of to- bacco, mental characteristics, occupa- pations, clothing, food, marriage, shamans, funeral ceremonies, dances, festivals, secret societies, etc., are re- ferred to, the first in considerable detail (at page 114 the pelvic measurements of 13 negro women are given,-they were taken in 1884). The numerals 1-Io and a few other words of the language are also given. According to Dr Pauli, the negro child is born quite light, gradually turning to yellow- brown (dark brown on the face) with a reddish tinge. The "impudence" of the negroes, the author thinks, is due to their contact with the whites, and is not native to them. Perregaux (E.) La c6te d'or comme pays aurif&amp;re. (Bull. Soc. Neuchat. de Geogr., 1901, xIII, 148-154.) Con- tains the translation of an account by a native of gold-mining in the Ashanti country of West Africa.

Resume, with 17 text-figures, of the results of excavations at El Amrah near the site of Abydos. This extensive cemetery ranges from the earliest " new race" period to the beginning of the "late prehistoric." Among the interesting objects found was a clay model of a house. It is possible to see the evolu- tion of the types of early tombs here from the very shallow round grave to the graves with niches walled-off. Roscoe (J.) Notes on the manners and customs of the Baganda. (Journ. An- throP. Inst., London, 190or, xxxI, 117- S 3o.) Extracts from letters to Dr J. G. Frazer by Rev. John Roscoe, for many years a missionary in Uganda. Tribal and clan names, birth, baptism, skin- markings, women (sex-relations, mar- riage, etc.), disease and death, mourning and funerals, death and burial of the king, are among the topics considered. Among the most interesting items is the following: " The men are said to have all the pains, while the women go on with their regular duties, perfectly happy until the time of delivery." Riitimeyer (L.) Ueber westafrikanische Steinidole. (Int. Arch. f. Ethnogr., Leiden, Igor, XIV, 195-215). De- scribes, with three plates (i8 figures), a collection of stone idols from the hinter- land of Sherbro, acquired early in 19or for the Basel Museum. The figures are found chiefly in a sort of tumulus or hill,-perhaps the site of an ancient fetish-place, for they are said to be modeled after the forms of gods and not after men. At pages 200-202 is given a report by Drs Schmidt and Preiswerk on the mineralogical and petrographic material of the idols, and pages 202-204 are taken up by descrip- tions of the 18 idols figured in the plates. Dr Rtitimeyer seems to favor ancient contact with Egypt as the stimulus for stone-sculpture in West Africa,-these idols probably represent a now extinct culture of negro peoples who have come under Egyptian in- fluence. Sharpe (A.) A carved stool and other objects from British East Africa. (Man, London, 1901o, 49.) Brief description (with plate) of carved stool, double gong, and perforated stone, of which the first came from the Lualaba-Mweru region, the second from Kazembe, the last from the " Mambwe" country. Similar stones have been found at Zim- babwe. ASIA Aristov (N. A.) Etnicbeskiya otnoshe- niya na Pamire, etc. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1900, I, NO. IV, 1-20.) This section of Aristov's paper on the ethnography of Pamir and the adjacent lands (after ancient Chinese authorities) deals with the period from the Han dynasties to the Ioth century A.I). The researches of Wylie, Specht, Hirth, Radloff, Tomaschek, etc., are referred to. Baelz (E.) Anthropologie der Men- schenrassen Ost-Asiens. (Verh. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthrop., 1901, 202-220, 245-248.) This interesting and valu- able paper treats (with 4 text-figures) of the following topics in relation to the peoples of eastern Asia, the Japanese in particular: The Japanese breast- groove (non-rachitic,-due to pressure of clothing, respiratory affections, etc.) ; the Japanese knee (deformed by " sit- ting ") ; effect of the sun's rays on dif- ferent races and the formation of pigment (pigmentation through heat is reticular and slow, through chemical influences diffuse and more rapid,-the Mongol browns in the sun, the clear- blond European "burns" reddish and blisters); the regrowth of the foetal lanugo and the hair-tufts on the back (the Ainos, a very hairy people, pre- serve the lanugo-hairs longer than other races) ; abdominal and thoracic breath- ing-types (Japanese women who wear a tight girdle have thoracic breathing); growth of the sexes at puberty (Japan- ese girls develop later than m/tis, and children of Europeans in Japan earliest of all); continuance of skull-growth (growth persists till about the fiftieth year) ; head-circumference of the same individual at different ages (little is known about this); correlation between forms of skull and pelvis (for functional</page><page sequence="21">172 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Baelz-Continued. purposes in child-birth a long-headed mother has a long-oval pelvis, etc.); the R8ntgen rays in anthropology (the X- rays serve to bring out the distinction between the flesh and the bony outlines of the face and head), the significance of the " supramamma " (a sort of rudi- mentary mamma), etc. Basset (R.)

De la transformation d'une race de couleur en une race blanche. (Bull. et MWm. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 240-252.) After discussing the terms "black Huns, and white Huns," " black Khazars, and white Khazars," "black Uigurs and white Uigurs," " black Bulgarians," " black Bulgaria," the author comes to the conclusion that " the black Huns, black Khazars, black Hungarians, black Bulgarians are all of the same Turko- Tatar family, and the white Huns, white Khazars, white Hungarians, white Bulgarians, are their respective descendants." The change of skin- color, which I)r Bloch thinks he can show to have occurred, he attributes not to any intermixture of races but to "transformation" pure and simple. But, as was pointed out in the discus- sion following the paper, the change is not at all proved, quite apart from the doubtful meaning of "black" in the cases cited. Bodsohn (P. L.) Reise im unabhingi- gen Sikkim. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 253-259.) Describes, with 6 text-figures, the author's travels in independent Sikkim, one of the most interesting Himalayan countries, with brief notes on the country, people, rul- ers, etc. Deniker (J.) Les taches congdnitales dans la region sacro-lombaire considd- rees comme caract~re de race. (Bull. et Mem. Soc. d'Anthr. de Paris, 1901, ve s., II, 274-281.) In 1873 Baelz noted the occurrence in new-born Jap- anese children of pigment-spots in the sacro-lumbar region, and in 1893 S6ren- Hansen reported them as frequently present in new-born Eskimo. In 1895 Matignon found them in Chinese chil- dren, and in 1896 a writer signing him- self R. M. reported them for several tribes in the interior of the Philippines. Dr Chemin (1899) found them among the Indo-Chinese peoples, and von Buelow (I900) noted their occurrence with the Samoans, and later still ten Kate states that he has confirmed their presence among Javanese, Hawaiians, and Koreans. They are said (without distinct proof) to characterize also the Malagasy of Madagascar. They are not known to occur among the Aino, Tungus, Kalmucks, Mongols, etc. The author suggests that these spots are a mark of the " Indonesian" race, either in its purity, or by admixture. A distribution-map accompanies the paper. In the discussion M. Atgier called attention to lumbar tufts of hair, etc.,-polycomia, as it may be termed. d'Enjoy (P.) Le pays d'Annam. Note historique et dynastique. (Rev. Scien- tif., Paris, 190r, 4e s., XVI, 557-56r.) This brief paper consists of an explana- tory list of the various names of the country of Annam past and present, and a table of the various dynasties and rulers from prehistoric times down to today, with names and reigns of mon- archs where known. Fawcett (F.) Notes on the D6mbs of Jeypur, Vizagapatam district, Madras presidency. (Man, London, 1901, 34- 38.) These valuable " notes" embody anthropometric observations of 25 in- dividuals besides discussion of general physical characters, tattooing (with re- production of designs), and briefer items about names, marriage customs, fertility, religion, taboo, death, etc. The D6mbs are "an outcast jungle people," akin to the Pan6s of the ad- joining Khond country. Fischer (A.) Ueber die Ureinwohner Formosas. (Sitzgber. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 1900, 215.) Very brief ab- stract of illustrated lecture. Frochot (H.) Le soroban, machine A calculer chinoise. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1901, 4e s., XVI, 303-305.)

Each tribe marks with its wasm (" brand," " seal," " mark ") its cattle, cisterns, pastures, paths, etc. Sub- groups, too, have their special wasm. There are simple and composite wasms. These property-marks have been thought by some to be pictographic in nature, by others to be modifications of old Himyaritic letters. Hartmann (M.) Die Frau im Islam. (Ztschr. d. Ver. f. Volkskunde, Berlin, 1901, XI, 237-252.) General discussion of the past and present position of women in Islamic countries. Among the topics considered are A'ischa (the favorite wife of the Prophet), pre- Islamic condition of woman, woman in the Koran, divorce, repression of per- sonality, influence of Persians, future of woman in Islam. According to Dr Hartmann, the results of Persian influ- ence upon Arabian society were bad, the insincerity of relations of all kinds common to Persia bearing hard upon woman. The inferior position of wo- man in the Orient is by no means alto- gether the work of Islam. The appearance in 1899 of Kasim Bey Amin's book, "The Freeing of Wo- man," raised a storm throughout the Islamic world, to which his later vol- ume, " The New Woman," has added, but the Egyptian Minister of the Inte- rior has declared his essential agree- ment with Kasim Bey's ideas about the improvement of woman's position and her education. Much is to be hoped from this good beginning. Hubbard (J. M.) Singan, the present capital of the Chinese Empire. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Washington, 19o01, xII, 63-66.) Brief account of the city on the Weiho, which the late Boxer troubles and the European interference made for the fifth time the capital of China. In Benares zur Zeit der Wasserfeste. (Globus, Brnschwg., 10or, LXXX, 137- 142.) Description, with 6 text-illustra- tions, of the famous water-festivals at Benares, one of the most remarkable religious ceremonials in India. Knosp (G.) Poetische Wettkimpfe in Annam. (Ibid., 277-279.) The au- thor gives the translation of the " poeti- cal contest" between a maiden and a youth as carried out at the Annamese Thrung-Thu or " children's New Year " festival. The girls begin and challenge the boys, who answer. Most of the verses are prepared beforehand and learned by heart, but sometimes they are extempore. Kon' (F.) Beremennost, rodf i uchod za rebenkom' i Katchinok. (Russk. An- trop. Zhur., Moskva, 19goo, , NO. 4, 58-61.) Brief account of pregnancy, parturition, etc., among the Katchines of western Siberia.

Einige ethnographische Gegenstainde aus Ceylon. (Sitzgber. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 19goo00, 197.) Brief notes on three wooden devil-dance masks, several clay vessels, a sword, etc., from Ratnapura, Ceylon. The ornamentation of the clay vessels sug- gests analogues of the Hallstatt period. Lehmann (C. F.) Der Tigris-Tunnel. (Ver. d. Berl. Ges. f. Anthr., 1901, 226-244.) Treats, with 4 text-illustra- tions, of the situation, structure, and exploration of the Tigris tunnel, the Assyrian knowledge of the " source- cave " of the Tigris, and the inscriptions on the rocks, especially those of Shal- manassar II. Lyle (T. H.) The place of manufacture of celadonware. (Man, London, 1901, 54-55.) Brief account of the making of celadon ware at the kilns of Sawan- kalok 200 miles north of Bankok, Siam. Mainov (I.) Pomyes russkich se ya- kutami. (Russk. Antrop. Zhur., Moskva, 1900, I, No. IV, 377-57.) This article (well-provided with tables and illustrated by 4 text-fgures) gives the details of the anthropometric investiga- tion of 186 male Russo-Yakut m/tis of various degrees of admixture. From the measurements taken it appears that the Russians surpass the Yakuts in height, length of leg, width of shoul- ders, size of foot and wrist; while the Yakuts surpass the Russians in length of trunk, length of arm, pelvic breadth, length and width of head, length and width of face. In general the Russo- Yakut m/tis resemble the Russians in height, proportions of body, etc.; while</page><page sequence="23">174 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.

I, 73-81.) Brief anthropological and ethnographical account of the Woguls, with two text-figures. At pages 77- 78 measurements of a number of skulls (all dolichocephalic) are given. Morrison (R.) Chinese characteristics. (Open Court, Chicago, 1901, xv, 551- 553.) Reprint from Rev. R. Mor- rison's book A View of China for Philological Purposes, which was pub- lished in 1817. The editor remarks, " his statement, though made almost a century ago, might have been written yesterday and not a word of it would lose its force." Contempt for the rude instead of fighting it, appeal to reason, and other qualities good and bad are noted. Pidron (H.) See Vaschide (N.) Read (C. H.) Relics from Chinese tombs. (Man, London, 1901, 17-18.) Brief account (with plate) of two pot- tery bowls, a bottle, and a mirror from an early medieval Chinese tomb. Regnault (J.) La m6decine en Indo- Chine. (Rev. Scientif., Paris, 1901, 4e S., XVI, 748-749.) The native phar- macopoeia is rich,- the author has noted and classified more than 450 remedies,- in Indo-China, and the "doctors" are perhaps not to be de- spised as much as some European writers think. The Chinese doctor seems to be preferred over the Anna- mite; the natives consult the European or American physician for surgical cases, but not otherwise. A fusion be- tween the Chinese and European phar- macopoeias is expected by M. Regnault to take place rather than the com- plete substitution of one for the other. The author is about to publish a book - Midecine et pharmacie chez les Chinois et les Annamites. Robinson (G. L.) The "high place" at Petra in Edom. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, XXIII, 229-241.) De- scribes, with plans and illustrations, what is said to have been " the chief religious sanctuary of the ancient in- habitants of Edom." According to the author this newly discovered " high place" at Petra dates from at least 300 B.C., but was evidently only the outward expression of religion long be- fore existing. The sun was probably worshipped there. Situation, pillars, the " fortress," the pool, rock-cut court, approach, altars, etc., are treated of. At pages 276-28I the editor supple- ments this paper by some remarks on " Rock-cut Sculptures." Schaffer (F.) Das heutige Cilicien. (Sitzgber. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 1901, 51-54.) A brief account of modern Cilicia, its people, religion, etc. The population is exceedingly mixed, each variety of race preserving still its individual peculiarities. Stenz (G. M.) Zur Pekinger Volks- kunde. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 273-277.) A brief account of Chinese folk-thought based upon Grube's recent work, and an appeal for the study by Aryan nations of the folk-life of China as the key to un- derstanding her. Domestic life and the customs connected therewith are briefly considered. Everyone who has any inclination to look upon the Chinese as " savages " or " barbarians " should read Grube's valuable and inter- esting book. Sumner (W. G.) The Yakuts. (Trans. Anthrop. Inst., London, 19o0, xxxI, 65-11o.) Abridged from Sieroshevki's Yakuty, published in Russian in 1896. Societal and industrial organization, marriage and family, marital usages and status of woman, etc., are discussed with more or less detail. Some later notes by the author and an additional note by Professor Sumner embodying new matter on terms of relationship conclude this interesting and valuable article. The Polish edition of Siero- shevski's work, which appeared in 1900oo, is entitled Twelve Years in the Land of the Yakuts. The Yakuts still number more than 200,000 scattered over a territory two-fifths as large as the U. S. Those in the more southern sections of the country are in many respects more conservative and devoted to archaic customs than those of the north. The shamanism of the Yakuts is particularly interesting,-" shaman- esses have greater might than the men." " Smiths stand in a close and peculiar relation to shamans." The nomencla- ture of relationship among the Yakuts is rich and complicated.</page><page sequence="24">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE r75 Sven Hedin's explorations in Central Asia. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Washing- ton, 19go, xII, 393-395.) Abstract from the London Times. Refers to the Lob Nor ruins. Sykes (Ella C.) Persian folk-lore. (Folk Lore, London, 1901, xII, 261- 280.) Records various items of folk- lore collected during a residence of over two years in Persia. Among the topics are : Rustum and Sohrab, ghouls, divs, finns and afreets, luck (dreams, omens, days, birds, animals), evil eye, favorite colors, sanctuaries, medicine (and charms), shrines, place-folklore, games, New Year's Day, Fire-Worship- pers, proverbs and saws. There are references to the Baluchis as well as to the Persians proper. Some of the Persian proverbs have an anthropologi- cal cast, e. g.," when you are in a room be of the same color as the people in it" (i. e., Do in Rome as the Romans do). One of the Baluchi conditions of saintship is " never to have robbed the poor." In Persia the stable constitutes a sanctuary. Although the number 13 is unlucky in Persia, the 13th day of all months (except Saffar) is white, or lucky. Vaschide (N.) et Pidron (H.) La valeur du rave prophitique dans la con- ceptionbiblique. (Rev. de Trad. Pop., Paris, 1901, xvI, 345-360.) Discus- sion of the data in the Hebrew Bible concerning the value of prophetic dreams. The authors conclude that the Hebrews believed generally in the symbolism of dreams, "but the pro- phets, seeing in them a possible rival, did not think too much of them "-so they came to hate and denounce divin- ation by dreams. Venkataswami (M. N.) Hindu Rhymes. (Folk Lore, London, 1901, xII, 333-335.) Six brief rhymes in use by children and youth in Secunderabad, Deccan. Webster (H.) Japan and China: some comparisons. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Washington, 19o0, xII, 69-77.) Gen- eral discussion of resemblances and dif- ferences between the Japanese and Chinese. Architecture, organization of charity, burial practices, war, food, law, morality, position of woman, etc., are briefly considered. The freedom enjoyed by women in Japan, something that seems to have existed from time immemorial, is one of the most marked differences. Their opinions of war are entirely opposite, also their work in practical philanthropy. INDONESIA, AUSTRALASIA, POLY- NESIA Adriani (N.) en Kruyt (A. C.) Ge- klopte boomschors als kleedingstof op Midden-Celebes en hare geographische verspreiding in Indonesia. (Int. Arch. f. Ethnogr., Leiden, 1901, XIV, 139- 191.) Valuable and detailed account of beaten-bark clothing in central Ce- lebes and its distribution throughout Indonesia. The article is well fur- nished with references to the literature of the subject and illustrated with 5 colored plates and 21 figures in the text,-the useful footnotes are the work of Dr Schmeltz who discusses the linguistic relations, etc., of the technical and other words involved in this study. Balfour (H.) A swan-neck boomerang of unusual form. (Man, London, 1901, 33.) Brief note (with plate) on a boomerang from McArthur river in the Northern Territory of South Aus- tralia. Three bambu trumpets from Northern Territory, S. Australi a. (Ibid., 33-34.) Brief description, with plate.

Antiq., Chi- cago, 19or, XXIII, 333-334.) Manila is held to be derived from the word nila (" indigo-tree ") a Sanskrit loan-word in Tagal, and the Tagal prefix ma-, the signification, therefore, being " place of indigo-tree." From the same word nila comes our aniline. Durands Besuch bei den Webias auf Neukaledonien. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 236-242.) Account (with 16 text-illustrations) from Le Tour du Monde of Durand's recent visit to the Webias of central New Caledonia. People, houses, implements and weap- ons, fetish-stones, m e d i c i n e-m e n, masks, marriage, fishing, etc., are briefly described. The Webias, who live in a state of independence in their</page><page sequence="25">176 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.

The parents (father in particu- lar) are very fond of their children and caress them a good deal. The hardest work in the fields is done by the men. The women, except when young, are quite ugly. The Webias have a sort of picture-writing on bamboo. The medicine-man has great power among them. The Webias never seem to have fallen upon the use of iron, al- though the land is very rich in that metal. They are skilful fishermen. Edge-Partington (J.) Note on the Matuatonga in the Art Gallery, Auck- land, New Zealand. (Man, London, 1901, 38-40.) Brief account, with 3 text-figures, of "a matuatonga or rep- resentation of the reproductive powers of nature,"-a stone image in the Grey collection. The material is foreign to New Zealand. - - Feathered arrows from Espiritu Santo, New Hebrides. (Ibid., 4I.) Brief note. These arrows are said to be " an indigenous production and without any foreign suggestion." Haddon (A. C.) The omen animals of Sarawak. (Pop. Sci. Mo., N. Y., 1901o LX, 8o-88.) Interesting account, largely based on Perham, of the birds and other omen animals among the Dyaks of North Borneo. This omen-animal cult seems indigenous to Borneo. Kruyt (A. C.) See Adriani (N.) Langley (S. P.) Diary of a voyage from San Francisco to Tahiti and return, 1901. (Nat. Geogr. Mag., Washing- ton, I9or, xII, 413-429.) This illus- trated diary contains notes on the Marquesans and Tahitians, the " himi- nies" (songs) of the native women, besides an interesting and valuable ac- count (with photographs) of the famous " fire-walk " of Papa-Ita. Ray (S. H.) Stories from the southern New Hebrides, with introduction and notes. (Journ. Anthrop. Inst., London, I901, xxxI, 147-I53.) Five brief stories from the islands of Tanna, Fu- tuna, and Aniwa, with notes on the names of the chief personages involved. Schoetensack(O.) Die BedeutungAus- traliens ftir die Heranbildung de Menschen aus einer niederen Form. (Ztschr. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1901, XXXIII, 127-154.) An argument for Australia as the environment where the precursor of man changed into man. Geological, zoological, cultural reasons are enumerated. The nature of the country (absence of the endless primi- tive forest), the presence of plenty of animal food (marsupials, etc.) easily obtained, and the absence of dangerous animals, all were favorable to the de- velopment of a higher form than the precursor. The climbing of isolated trees (not the life of the dense forest) had much to do with the making of man. The environment suggested many of the things of earliest culture. The boomerang and throwing-sticks are compared by the author with cer- tain paleolithic objects found at Lau- gerie-Basse, Mas-d'-Azil, etc., which belonged to prehistoric man in France. The absence of the bow and arrow points to its invention after man started to migrate from Australia. Be- tween the art of the Australians and that of primitive man in Europe Dr Schoetensack sees many points of con- tact. Some of the points brought out by theauthor are interesting and sugges- tive, others very doubtful and somewhat imaginative. The paper is illustrated with a map and Ii text-figures. Starr (F.) The Bernice Pauahi Bishop Museum. (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 1901, xxIII, 329-332.) Brief account of the Museum at Honolulu and its work. The plans include Polynesian natural history as well as ethnology. Two series, " Occasional Papers" and "Memoirs," are published. The Mu- seum is a monument to the worthy and accomplished Princess Pauahi. Thilenius (Dr) Die Fahrzeuge der Samoaner. (Globus, Brnschwg., 190i, LXXX, 167-173.) Detailed account, with 4 text-figures, of the construction, use, etc., of Samoan boats and sailing- vessels. Of boats there are three chief varieties with several intermediate and diverging forms of each. The amatasi, a characteristic sailing-vessel, is now extinct. Another sailing-vessel, the alia, is an old type and contains most of the general elements of the Poly- nesian boat. Of the alia many varieites exist. By means of alia or double- alia many of the long inter-archipelago voyages from Samoa have been made. They have been built to carry more than Ioo persons, making possible an extensive migration.</page><page sequence="26">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 177 Thomson (B.) Note upon the natives of Savage island, or Niue. (Journ. Anthrop. Inst., London, 19or0, xxxt, 137-r45.) Treats of religion, witch- craft, diseases, medicine, midwifery, abortion, funeral customs, warfare, land, justice, dress. According to the author, " in their industry and energy the Savage islanders are a great contrast to the other Polynesian races." We learn, however, that since contact with whites, " while their industry shows no symptom of abatement, there is a marked deterioration in their morality." Their villages are " the neatest and cleanest in the Pacific." A marked decline in the influence of the mission is also noted with " a consequent re- crudescence of heathen superstition." Under English control Niue " promises to be the most contented and prosperous little community in the Pacific." Woodford (C. M.) Note on tatu- patterns employed in Lord Howe's island. (Man, London, 1901, 4o.) Brief note, with front and back views.

Seneca and Tus- carora variants of the story are given with notes on Iroquois "medicine," drinking of "medicine water," etc. The author observes in conclusion : " I do not find the Indian more supersti- tious on the whole than some of his white neighbors." Benedict (A. L.) Has the Indian been misjudged ? (Intern. Journ. Ethics, Phila., 9Iqo01, XII, 99-113.) General discussion of the character of the Amerind. Domestic life, occupations, position of woman, etiquette, religion, language, government, war, etc., are AM. ANTH. N. S., 4-12 briefly considered. The author rightly concludes that " the aborigines were not in all respects our inferiors." de Carranza (J.) Arte de la lengua Mexicana. (An. d. Mus. Nac. Mex., 19or, Gram., 11, 109-124, 125-140.)

Folk-Lore, Boston, 1901, XIV, 165-171.) After discussing the etymology of the expression for " trans- late " in various languages, the author considers with more or less detail " translation words," words changed in meaning, words made up by the mis- sionaries with or without the aid of their converts, etc. The following words from Baraga's " Dictionary of the Otchipw6 Language" are treated of : Abide, absolution, Almighty, altar, annunciation, ark, blasphemy, brim- stone, Christian, cross, forgive, heaven, hell, Holy Ghost, hymn, marriage, Pope, Sabbath. Chavero (A.) Manuscrito antiguo en mexicano, in'dito. (An. d. Mus Nac. de Mexico, 1901, viI, 129-132.)

This concluding part of a paper on the " sun stone " treats of the signs tecpatl, quiahiutl, and xochitl. Dalton (0. M.) Note on a specimen of basket-work from California recently acquired by the British Museum. (Man, London, 1901, 23-24.) Brief account, with text-figure, of " a flexible cylindri- cal basket ascribed to the Umpqua Indians." On one side are human and on the others animal figures.. The note also refers to a collection of stone objects from graves in San Luis Obispo and Santa Barbara counties. Dissette (Mary E.) The future of the Pueblos. (So. Workman, Hampton, Va., i9o0, xxx, 641-645.) Author argues for compulsory education of In- dian children between four and fourteen years of age. This done " the future of the Pueblo Indian will take care of itself." With this should go the en- couragement of native industries. Du Bois (Constance G.) The mythol- ogy of the Dieguenios. (Journ. Amer.</page><page sequence="27">178 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Du Bois-Continued. Folk-Lore, Boston, Igqo, xIv, 181- 185.)

Workman, Hampton, Va., 1901, xxx, 486-493.) General account, with 7 text-illustrations, of the houses of the American negroes during the period of slavery. The chief sociologi- cal characteristics were lack of com- fort, hygiene, and thrift, and forced absence of mother and father. - The home of the country freedman. (Ibid., 535-542.) General description with 6 text-illustrations. The chief characteristics of the country freedman's home are: Poor light, bad air, lack of sanitary appliances, poor weather-pro- tection, crowding, poor food, lack of privacy, lack of beauty. The negro needs, above all, " ideals of home life." - The home of the village negro. (Ibid., 601-604.) General discussion with statistics. Early California history.

Notes on the Indians, their customs, language, etc., are included. At page 41 are given the numerals I-io and a few other words of the Santa Barbara Indians. Elliott (G. M.) Crime and criminality in the negro race. (So. Workman, Hampton, Va., 1901, xxx, 636-641.) Among the causes cited are unfortunate environments, idleness, intemperance, immorality, illiteracy. The remedies suggested are home-improvement, bet- ter pulpit instruction, general educa- tion, opening up of more business avenues, business training, industrial education. Negro crime is out of pro- portion with white crime so far as population is concerned, being much greater. Folsom (C. M.) Guiding the Indian. (Ibid., 6o5-61o.) Argues for more careful discrimination between the good and the bad in the Indian character, the cultivation of independence, indi- vidual teaching, " outing" system, more attention to home-life, etc. Fdrstemann (E.)

This deity, called mam ("grandfather"), is represented by an old bald-headed man, sitting or leaning upon a staff. Frederick (M. C.) Some Indian paint- ings. (Land of Sunshine, Los Angeles, 1901, XV, 223-227.) Brief account, with three text-illustrations, of the pic- tures in the " Painted cave," on an old Indian trail near Santa Barbara, Cal. The paintings are in red, white, yellow, and black, and " are as fresh and bright as though recently laid on." Tradition has it that one of these paintings re- cords a treaty between the Santa Bar- bara and the Santa Ynez Indians. Some may be records of a trading expedition, as Dr W. J. Hoffman, who saw the cave in 1883, thought. Besides human figures these paintings contain " various circular designs, maltese crosses, snake- like markings, parallel lines, a cross- barred pattern, tree-forms, something resembling a centipede, insects, etc." Freeman (Theresa J.)

Discusses, with six tables, the distribu- tion of the population (by nationalities, religions, geographical areas, etc.) among the classes styled by the author ideo-motor, ideo-emotional, dogmatic- emotional, critical-intellectual. Pro- fessor Giddings thinks "the mental 'mode' of the American people as a whole is ideo-emotional to dogmatic- emotional," a view confirmed by the classification of the annual output of books.</page><page sequence="28">PERIODICAL LITERA TURE 179 Grosvenor (G.

Every Iooo of the population now con- tains 511.8 boys and men and 488.2 girls and women; also 863 native-born and 137 foreign-born. By race every Iooo contains I Japanese, 2 Chinese, 3 Indians, 16 negroes, and 878 whites. The Amerinds show a decrease of 2.5 % from the figures of 1890, which does not prove a very rapid disappearance of the Red Man. Guevara (T.) Historia de la civilizacion de Araucania.

S., 4, 1902 Mooney (J.) Indian shield heraldry. (So. Workman, Hampton, Va., 1901, xxx, 500-504.) Brief account of the symbolism of the shield among the Kiowa. In 1892 only 6 out of 200 shields in existence 30 years ago were still extant, and of these but one is still with the tribe,-three are in the U. S. National Museum. Prophetic and illuminating visions abound in con- nection with the shields. The " buf- falo shield " is said to have originated from the fact that a woman, in fleeing from the enemy, saved herself from a prairie fire by crawling under a dried- up buffalo-skin. The shield was after- ward made by her husband under the guidance of-the buffalo spirit. Morice (A. G.) Dine surgery. (Trans. Canad. Inst., Toronto, Ig9oI, vII, I5- 27.)

The paper contains many new and interesting facts. Among other things' Father Morice notes that " Indian babies are almost always born with a full crop of hair, and more than once with several teeth." - Who are the Atnas ? (Amer. Antiq., Chicago, 190o, xxIII, 307- 312.) In this article, which is chiefly a criticism of other writers about the so-called " Atnas," Father Morice comes to the conclusion that " Atna, etc., is a Din6 word which means ' foreigner, heterogener,' and is used to qualify all races which are not Dend." The author replies to a recent article on the Atnas by H. Newell Wardle, in respect to the etymologies therein suggested. Peairs (H. B.) The need of compulsory education for Indians. (So.

Gives details of meas- urements (stature, head, face, mouth, nose, ear) of 8 male and 6 female Eskimo from the eastern coast of La- brador and the shores of Hudson bay, who were in Geneva during the summer of i9oo. The height of the men ranged from 1488 mm. to 1618 mm. ; of the women, from 1475 mm. to 1612 mm. The cephalic index of the men varied from 73 to 79.31, and of the women, from 73.o09 to 77.41 ; the nasal index, men 67.73-78.43, women 70.58- 78.72.

According to the author, who is a missionary at Colony, Okla- homa, it may be said of the Cheyenne and Arapaho of Oklahoma that " only one Indian art worthy of the name re- mains to them, and that is their bead- work"; and this of late years has degenerated. A few notes on picto- graphic and symbolic ornament are given. Rogers (F. K.) An all-round mechani- cal training for Indians. (Ibid., 459- 461.) Author thinks specialization should be rare, and emphasizes too- much the old-fashioned "all-round" idea. Sapper (K.) Speise und Trank der Kekchi Indianer. (Globus, Brnschwg., 1901, LXXX, 259-263.) Detailed ac- count of the food and drink of the Kekchi Indians of Guatemala, with the native name of the various materials. The greater part of the article is con- cerned with maize and its various products, including chicka and other liquors. The vegetables and fruits in use as food and the other native liquors are briefly referred to. l'he Kekchi boil but never roast turkeys The pre- Columbian cacao is now being more and more driven out of use by coffee.

The au- thor cites passages from Ruchamer's translation (published in 15o8) of an Italian rendering of the Portuguese ac- count of the voyage of Cabral, in which the Botucudos of Brazil are referred to. The Portuguese explorer, who saw them in 1500, characterized them as merry, peaceable, kindly savages,-- such were- they before contact with the culture of Europe. Scoville (Annie B.) Ogalala day schools. (So. Workman, Hampton, Va., Igoi, xxx, 646-649.) Brief notes on Indian schools "among the hostiles," " down in the sand hills," etc. The author in- forms us that the stronghold of all that fights against civilization is the "Omaha" dance-house,-" this Indian 'Omaha' is school and church, the center of social and public life for the pagan party." Seler (E.) Die Cedra-Holzplatten von Tikal im Museum zu Basel. (Ztsch. f. Ethnol., Berlin, 1901, xxxIII, o01- 126.) More or less detailed account, with 27 text-figures, of the wooden (cedrela?) plates from Tikal in the Basel Museum, and the hieroglyphs in- scribed upon them. The development of the sign for " eve " is considered in particular. The signs on the Tikal plates are compared with those at Pa- lenque, Copan, etc. These carvings are among the most perfect specimens of Mayan art. - Zwei hervorragende Stficke der alt- mexikanischen Sammlung der Christy Collection in London. (Globus, Brn- schwg., 1901, LXXX, 223-226.) Treats, with 8 text-figures, of Humboldt's " Aztec priestess," and a stone mask of the god Xipe now in the Christy col- lection (London). The former, Dr Seler thinks, is a representation of Chalchiuhtlicue, the goddess of water. A great center of worship of the vege- tation-god Xipe, was at Teotitlan del Camino, whence, perhaps, this mask was obtained. Steiner (R.) Observations on the prac- tice of conjuring in Georgia. (Journ. Amer. Folk-Lore, Boston, 19o01, XIV, 173-i80.) Among the topics treated of are : Witches, how " cunjer" doc- tors get patients, " cunjurers," etc. Pages 177-180 are occupied by " items relating to ' cunjer.' " At page 172 the same author has a note on " 'Seeking Jesus,' a religious rite of negroes in Georgia." Wardle (H. N.) Die Eskimos und die Schraube. (Globus, Brnschwg., g19O, LXXX, 226-227.) Discusses, with three text-figures, the origin of the screw- form spear-shafts, etc., of the Eskimo, about which, in previous numbers of Globus, v. Buchwald, v. den Steinen, Krause, etc., had written. The author believes that much can be said in favor of the independent discovery of the screw-principle by the Eskimo. The fact that all their known " screws'" are "lefts " may be explained by their "having had centuries before the com- ing of the white man (and the possi- bilities of subsequent acculturation) every day beneath their eyes a marked example of a 'left' screw-viz, the horn of the narwhal." Wintemberg (W. J.) Drills and drill- ing methods of the Canadian In- dians. (Reliquary, London, 19or, vilI,</page><page sequence="31">182 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 4, 1902 Win temberg-Continued. 262-266.)

(So. Work- man, Hampton, Va., g19or, xxx, 429- 435.) General discussion. Author holds that " the school and all that it contains must be within the circle of Indian sympathies," and the training " of such a simple and practical charac- ter as to win the approval of the Indian people." Moreover "the course of study, text-books, and manual features of the schools of Boston or Detroit are out of place in an Indian community." The inspiration of Indian life and the virtues of Indian character should be the core of text-books for the Indian. Education of the child should take place among its own people and not away from them. Zelizko (J. V.) Einige weitere Nach- trAige zur Geophagie. (Sitzgber. d. anthrop. Ges. in Wien, 1900, 205.)
