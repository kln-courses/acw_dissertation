<plain_text><page sequence="1">Through A Glass Darkly: Cause and Effect in Refugee Simon M. Fass Resettlement Policies As the ongoing debate among philosophers and social scientists suggests, interpretation of cause and effect in human action is often extremely difficult. Especially complicated for the policy analyst is the problem of determining whether causal relationships are inferred from the evidence or imputed to it. This dilemma characterizes certain types of government activity in which distinctions between policy and implementation, Abstract between decisions and actions, and between inputs and outcomes are unclear. The efforts of the federal government between 1960 and 1985 to assist refugees in securing employment illustrate how the flow of events may elude causal explanation, and how conclusions and recommendation for improvement derived from the evidence may prove highly ambiguous. In such instances the most rational course open to policy analysts may be to concede ignorance. Western thought from Aristotle onward contains lively but in- conclusive debate over whether either spectator or participant in human action can unambiguously identify cause and effect. One side of the debate, that represented by Hume, argues that human events, or at least certain categories of such events, have inherent properties susceptible to understanding. The other side argues emphatically that all such properties are imputed. The philosopher R. G. Collingwood, for example, asserted that all causal statements are anthropomorphic, and therefore cannot be rational in the strict scientific meaning of the word.' The import of this ongoing dis- cussion is to demonstrate the uncertainty in assigning causal ex- planations to human conduct. And it is unclear whether the un- certainty stems from the characteristics of observed phenomena or from the characteristics of the observer. Machiavelli left no doubt of his views in the accounts of military campaigns in his Discourses.

Treating the same subject, Tolstoy challenged such causal ex- planation, and the conjectures and prescriptions to which it gave rise. Examining the battle at Borodino, he observed that it would have been impossible for Napoleon or Kutuzov to know what was taking place from moment to moment along several fronts that stretched for miles away from them.3 Similarly it would have been impossible for the generals to make rational decisions on the basis of situational information that was obsolete by the time it reached them, or to send out appropriate orders addressing situations which could have changed dramatically by the time the message arrived at the front. Moreover, even if situations were stationary, the generals were always obliged to deal with a variety of intrigues, projects, counsels, threats, and theories that often had no bearing on battlefield events. In Tolstoy's view, generals, officers and footsoldiers were caught up in the flow of events, and neither they nor later analysts of the battle could explain why it progressed as it did. All the par- ticipants were decision-makers and action-takers at the same time. All the decisions and actions were based on circumstances that changed from one instant to another and that differed from one individual to another. Of no little significance was the fact that the generals wanted to win and the footsoldiers wanted to stay alive. Yet neither set of actors exercised much control over eventual results. Thus, Tolstoy argued, it was irrational, or at least an overstatement, to ascribe causal power to the generals. Retrospective suggestions about what the generals should have done, and how, and arguments that results would have been different accordingly, fail to take into account the actual circumstances of battle. Contemporary discourse about government activities often seems equally uncertain. In his Theory of Social and Economic Organization, the sociologist Max Weber described an "ideal" model of a highly structured bureaucracy controlled at the top by a small group of decision-makers whose policies were dutifully implemented by subordinate administrators.4 Subsequent students of public or- ganizations have steadily diminished the range of applications to which Weber's model can be applied. They note, for example, that implementors can sometimes be policy-makers.5 Their language of analysis nevertheless posits the existence of policy and pol- icy/decision-makers, and the existence of systemic cause-effect relationships through which implementation flows from policy and is carried out by a subservient category of actors. The essence of this language is Weberian, and uncertainty arises from the question of whether analysts adopt it after infering causality from</page><page sequence="3">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies the evidence, or whether they use it to impute causality to the evidence. Many analysts have a tendency to transform their inquiries into recommendations for subsequent action by decision-makers. If such recommendations result from inferred causality, they may be accurate or inaccurate, but in either case would be rational. Recommendations stemming from imputed causality, of the kind that Tolstoy challenged, would be irrational. I believe that there are categories of governmental activity, like Borodino, in which the flow of events are not susceptible to rational statements of cause and effect. One such instance is the federal effort between 1960 and 1985 to assist refugees in securing em- ployment in the United States. THE CUBAN RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM Refugees entered the United States in the 1940s and 1950s under a series of ad hoc legislative and executive actions.6 These federal actions were limited to opening or closing doors to refugee ad- mission. Efforts to help refugees adjust to life in the United States, including securing of employment, were the domain of private, volunteer agencies, their constituents and individual family spon- sors. And such private initiatives providing temporary income support, language and vocational instruction, occupational coun- seling, and job placement seemed to function adequately. However, in November 1960 private agencies in Florida found themselves overwhelmed by an influx of Cubans who were arriving at a rate of 1,700 a week. In apparent response to requests for assistance by the agencies, as well as by state and local governments, the Eisenhower Administration created a Cuban refugee emergency center in Miami the following month, and channeled federal funds to state, local, and private agencies through the center. A year later, the Kennedy Administration expanded federal involvement by creating a Cuban Refugee Program (CRP) within the Department of Health, Education and Welfare (HEW) to allocate and coordinate the use of federal funds by the agencies. Although documentation concerning Cuban resettlement is scarce and program evaluation did not become widespread until the late 1960s and early 1970s, evidence suggests that the CRP was not without its difficulties. In particular, officials could not recruit enough individuals and institutions with the skills necessary to assist Cubans in finding work. The supply of Spanish-speaking people in Miami with experience in training, counseling and job placement was limited. The CRP therefore required many of its staff to engage in a period of on-the-job learning to acquire the necessary proficiencies. Another difficulty arose as a result of growth and change in federal social programs. Resettlement efforts had to be modified constantly to accommodate new programs and changes in old programs. New skills were required to complete an ever-increasing load of monitoring and evaluation reports, as well as other documentation. Not surprisingly, the CRP came under criticism for being costly and, apparently, unmanageable. From the federal perspective the problem seemed to stem from 121</page><page sequence="4">122 THE INDOCHINESE RESETTLEMENT PROGRAM Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies inadequate state and local implementation capabilities, whereas local officials complained that federal top-down approaches were inappropriate to local circumstances.7 In fact, neither those involved directly in the program nor outside observers had evidence to suggest one way or the other how the CRP was accomplishing its goal of aiding the Cubans in finding work. Indeed, there was no proof that the Cubans would have been worse off without the CRP. No evaluation was possible because no basis of comparison existed against which to make a judgment. Such issues as funding, manageability, implementation and in- appropriateness had to do with program inputs. Critics failed to examine the relationship of inputs to program results, and so could not rationally claim that proposed changes in input char- acteristics would make a difference in employment. As in other policy areas during the 1960s and 1970s, proponents and critics of the CRP held to a belief in cause-effect relationships between interventions and outcomes despite a lack of evidence to sustain their hypotheses. The substantive evidence that did come out of the Cuban ex- perience was that 800,000 people who arrived between 1960 and 1975 eventually settled in comfortably.8 Early arrivals were better- educated and could find work more easily than later arrivals, who needed two to five years of income support before becoming self- sufficient.9 In general, refugees required 10 to 15 years of residence in the U.S. to achieve employment and earnings levels equal to those of comparable Americans. During this period, many early arrivals shifted from wage-paying jobs to self-employment, often creating businesses which served as sources of employment for later arrivals. This process tended to accelerate the pace at which the later arrivals found jobs.'0 With the exception of the need for temporary income support, this whole sequence was identical to the historical pattern exhibited by most immigrant groups who did not benefit from government resettlement programs.' The arrival of 4,000 Vietnamese per week in May 1975 marked the beginning of a second major resettlement program, this one aimed at helping over 600,000 Indochinese during the next six years.'2 Federal decision-making during 1975 and 1976 was hurried. In an attempt to avoid concentration of refugees in areas that presumably could not quickly absorb large numbers of unemployed, the government dispersed the Indochinese across a number of cities and towns where unemployment rates were low.'3 This dis- persal also seemed to promise the advantage of making available to the refugees a larger number of experienced service providers in state and local government and private agencies than would be possible with concentration. Although all providers would have to learn about and adjust to new types of clientele, a thin dispersal would, in principle, minimize the hiring of personnel who were also new to the intricacies of training, counseling and placement services.</page><page sequence="5">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies 123 The dispersal strategy may have made sense in terms of program engineering and as a tactic to minimize protests from areas heavily affected by initial refugee arrivals, but it contradicted historical social science research findings and certain aspects of the Cuban experience. Ethnic communities, for example, especially those newly arrived, prefer to stay close together for mutual support and as- sistance. They have the habit of helping each other, and do not have the experience of depending on outsiders, particularly gov- ernment, to help them. Therefore, the locating together of refugees and service providers would not automatically result in immediate service benefits to the arrivals, and the dispersal would not nec- essarily mean that refugees would remain in their assigned com- munities of settlement. These potential difficulties, however, were not evident in 1975 or 1976, and there was little time to speculate about them when the initial task of receiving refugees and finding them living quarters was such a monumental one. A more fundamental decision, one that evolved in fits as necessity demanded between 1975 and 1979, was to have the federal gov- ernment absorb all resettlement costs for the first 36 months after a refugee's arrival. This involved reimbursements to states for their AFDC contributions, Social Security Insurance supplements, food stamps and Medicaid; and provision of special refugee medical assistance and refugee cash assistance to cover needs of refugees who met income eligibility criteria for federal programs, but who could not meet family composition criteria. States also received social service grants to cover the costs of language training, coun- seling, and job placement. Although the CRP did not make a convincing case that these publicly provided services could hasten refugee employment, by the late 1970s such services had become standard within the U.S. welfare system to assist unemployed Americans on income support, and could therefore be easily ex- tended to cover refugees. Curiously, social service grants did not support vocational training and, more generally, services provided under the Comprehensive Employment and Training Act (CETA) were not made widely available to them. Research done on Manpower Development and Training Act (MDTA) programs and in process on CETA programs was beginning to suggest that certain types of training could make a difference in the short-term employment prospects of certain categories of hard-to-employ Americans, and that training often yielded superior outcomes than possible with counseling or place- ment alone.'4 Employment efforts may not have included the use of CETA because early arrivals were well-educated and hence ineligible or inappropriate for the program, or because the welfare system was dominated by social service-oriented caseworkers and language instructors who tended to overlook vocational training. It may also have been that matters were complicated enough without adding yet another component to the resettlement load. Whatever the explanation, the end result was that individuals and institutions with experience in finding work for seriously disad- vantaged people were not made part of the resettlement effort.</page><page sequence="6">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies By 1980, the Indochinese program was more or less in place and Congress, perhaps prodded by the arrival of almost 370,000 refugees in that year, institutionalized it under the Refugee Act of 1980. In this instance, if one chooses to interpret congressional action as a statement of policy, implementation preceded the making of policy. Actually, the act was a relatively trivial event in the evolution of federal action. What it did beyond institutionalization was to make the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) within the Department of Health and Human Services responsible for planning and coordinating domestic resettlement, an activity which the ORR was already handling. The act also served as a symbolic response to growing criticism of the resettlement program. Unlike the situation involving the Cubans in the early 1960s, the Indochinese arrived during a period when social programs had developed a following of program implementation analysts who did not appear to require either theory or meaningful data to draw conclusions or make recommendations. For example, or- ganization assessments by these analysts lamented the absence of systematic federal or state planning for resettlement activities, insufficient information upon which to base planning and eval- uation, inadequate state and local government leadership, and lack of participation by refugee self-help associations in program design. Management reviews pointed to weaknesses in staffing; in communication and coordination between federal, state and local, and volunteer agencies; and in ongoing monitoring and evaluation activities.16 Service evaluations called for increased federal funding in general, and for additional services based on more accurate assessments of refugee needs.'7 These evaluations also urged further expansion of language instruction and em- ployment services.'8 As was the case during the CRP, the conclusions suggested that the Indochinese program was not "good enough," and the rec- ommendations suggested that program staff do "more" or "better." However, in order to recommend more or better, the analysts would have had to provide tangible evidence that program per- formance was not good enough. The CRP experience had suggested a 10 to 15-year period before valid comparisons could be made with the native born, yet analysts of the Indochinese experience had not even the benefit of a five year examination period. Careful review of studies written in 1980 and 1981 also reveals that nearly all analysts failed to pay close attention to available data. For instance, although refugee employment rates in 1980 were lower than for the United States population as a whole, each cohort of arrivals was making significant year to year progress, and the 1975 arrivals had achieved higher labor force participation and employment rates than comparable figures for Black Americans.'9 The status of refugees could as readily be interpreted as bad or good depending on whether analysts compared them to the United States average or to minority group averages.20 Unfortunately, comparisons such as these, which might have shed light on the effectiveness of the programs, were not undertaken. 124</page><page sequence="7">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies 125 More importantly, if analysts were to make prescriptive comment, they would also have to demonstrate how changes in such char- acteristics as planning, information, leadership, participation, staff competence, communication, coordination, monitoring, evaluation, funding, language instruction, counseling or job placement services could yield swifter refugee employment. Causal relationships linking most of these hard-to-define program characteristics with outcomes did not exist. The only unequivocal facts were that by 1981 the federal government had a refugee act under which it was spending $2.1 billion a year, refugees were making slow but steady progress in finding employment, and there were no clear indications whether the portion of funds spent on employment services or the imple- mentation characteristics of services had any effect on refugee progress.2 The Indochinese program was therefore on no firmer footing than the CRP had been earlier. THE HMONG The luxury of time for contemplation and proper evaluative research PROGRAM did not present itself because an unfolding of events in 1981 and 1982 propelled the ORR into making more quick decisions to address problems presented by Hmong refugees. Indochinese arrivals in 1979 and 1980 had contained a large contingent of Hmong, a hilltribe people from Laos. These refugees, for the most part illiterate in their own language, lacking occu- pational skills transferable to the United States labor market, and having minimal exposure to Western culture, faced severe difficulties in finding jobs. Their 1981 labor force participation and employment rates, for example, were much lower than rates for other Indochinese who had arrived at the same time.22 These low rates were not unexpected, but they became a focus of concern during 1981 as an increasing number of field reports indicated that Hmong were moving from their assigned areas of settlement to California's central valley. ORR staff and Hmong leaders viewed this trend with concern because the receiving counties seemed to offer rel- atively few employment opportunities, and did not have a large contingent of service providers with experience in dealing with Hmong. At the same time, out-migration from assigned settlement areas was undermining whatever labor market footholds Hmong had obtained there, and whatever progress service providers in those areas had made in learning how to address Hmong difficulties. By early 1982, after consultation with Hmong leaders, the ORR decided that some action was required. ORR officials did not have adequate information upon which to base action, and therefore decided to authorize a "Hmong Resettlement Study" to examine the refugee's resettlement experiences, to identify successful pro- gram efforts, and to determine ways to improve them-including efforts which might increase the rate of Hmong employment more quickly. However, before the study could be carried out, the federal government announced in April 1982 that refugee cash assistance would be cut back from 36 to 18 months, and that the decision would take effect the following June. The effect of the ruling was</page><page sequence="8">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies to increase the rate of migration by Hmong fearful of losing income support in states which did not have AFDC or substantial General Assistance programs. At the same time the ORR requested and received a congressional appropriation of $32 million for an impact aid grant program.23 This action came in response to protests against the cutback from California, from other areas, such as Washington where the recession had severely constrained the capacity of state and local budgets to absorb refugee support costs, from refugee lobbying organizations, and from individual proponents of the refugee cause. The appro- priation was a supplement to $68 million already allotted to social services grants in FY 1982, and the ORR channelled the new funds to heavily affected states for the purpose of expanding language training, counseling and job placement services. States then real- located the grants to whatever relevant efforts were already serving refugees affected by the cutback. Underlying impact aid was the assumption that Hmong em- ployment rates were a function of the level of funding available to provide services to them. The ORR, with a staff that included social workers, linguists, managers, anthropologists and sociologists, but few labor market specialists, was not aware of the extreme competition for entry-level, minimum-wage jobs that characterized the labor market in 1982 as the recession deepened. Hmong had to compete for jobs with experienced Americans, and they tended to lose the struggle. Often, their only choice was where to be unemployed-in a small, isolated community or among friends and family in California. Impact aid did not produce the results that ORR had sought. The ORR then made a FY 1983 allocation request for $60 million to be passed to states as social services grants, and $20 million for a new targetted assistance grant program to replace impact aid. The new program would bypass the states, and would provide federal funds directly to local governments, private agencies and refugee self-help associations to use as they deemed appropriate to promote employment. In making the new program request the ORR assumed that impact aid had been ineffective because of implementation in- adequacies in state-administered services, an assumption supported by field reports from anthropologists, linguists and others working with Hmong. These specialists had termed the existing services "not good enough" in the style of conjectural assessment that by this time had become commonplace. The ORR also assumed that there were alternatives to state programs, and that the alternatives could serve better. Yet field reports indicated nothing more than the existence of independent projects; evidence that such projects could lead to superior results did not exist. Nevertheless, ORR officials found them attractive. As is often the case when bureaucratic approaches seem to foun- der, "creative self-help" at the "grassroots" level becomes a tempting alternative. In this instance the ORR knew only that a variety of projects, jointly administered by Americans and refugees, were 126</page><page sequence="9">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies pursuing novel approaches, such as craft sales, farming schemes, and small business development. Targetted assistance was thus something of a fishing expedition, with the promise of funding as bait. Congress not only approved the ORR request, but also increased social services appropriations to $80 million, increased targetted assistance to $75 million, and included in this last a $3 million Highland-Lao initiative to address the particular difficulties of Hmong and other similar groups.24 Demand for targetted assistance and initiative support came quickly. However, it emanated primarily from local government agencies and non-profit service providers, including refugee self-help associations, that wanted to hire staff to establish or expand their own language training, counseling and job placement agencies. As it turned out, few of the refugees applied for funds to support creative self-help efforts. At the end of FY 1983 only three Hmong craft projects and one farming scheme had received grants. In search of reasons for this result, the ORR turned to the Hmong Resettlement Study, commissioned several months earlier, which by this time had completed fieldwork that included identification and appraisal of some 90 self-help projects.25 HMONG SELF-HELP PROJECTS Interim findings of the study at the end of FY 1983 suggested that the origins, evolution and other characteristics of self-help projects were such that they did not seem to offer good prospects for short- term increases in refugee employment. Craft projects, for example, had started as a means of aiding psycho-social adjustment, pre- serving cultural identity, or fostering quasi-economic undertakings by American volunteers with backgrounds in social service, textile arts, language instruction or Third World development. The projects were small shops where Hmong women could bring needlework which they made at home, and earn income when the store sold the products. After the 1982 announcement of the cutback in refugee cash assistance, the women and Hmong community leaders put pressure on the Americans to shift priorities more to income- generation and to maximize earnings. Most Americans were willing to change project directions, but the results of their efforts were mixed. Although a few of the 2,400 Hmong women involved in the 30 projects could earn $3,000 a year or more, most made less than $200. It seemed that neither the Americans nor the Hmong had the business experience to improve income. The only measurable difference in outcomes among the projects was that those which had managed to secure substantial private grant support were providing each of their participants with an average of $303 per year, while projects with limited support were generating $117. The difference was not statistically significant. Moreover, all the endowed projects were money-losers and required $400 in support to generate $303 in annual earnings, while the others, money-makers, required $50 in support to generate $117 in earnings. 127</page><page sequence="10">128 Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies The evolution of farming projects was similar. With help from county agricultural extension services, community economic de- velopment organizations, refugee mutual assistance associations and church groups, Hmong began to engage in urban vegetable gardening schemes within months of their arrival. These efforts proved successful in generating in-kind and cash income, ranging from $200 to $500 per family each season, and in generating en- thusiasm about farming as a vocation for the refugees. Announce- ment of the federal cutback in refugee income support in 1982 led nine communities to expand the schemes into more substantial projects, which they hoped would provide significantly higher levels of income.26 A year later, 22 projects with 500 participating families were in or were about to begin operation. Participating Americans had backgrounds in social work, com- munity organization and development, language training and other areas peripheral to farming. Agricultural extension agents filled in some of the knowledge gaps in such areas as soil analysis and crop selection. With this technical assistance Hmong proved them- selves adept at growing vegetables in large quantities. Commercial farming nevertheless presented formidable challenges. To greater or lesser degrees every project was hindered by such obstacles as: limited knowledge of commercial farming practices and methods; scarce financial resources; uncertain cooperation by neighboring farmers and local extension services; limited marketing channels; uneven capability in intercultural communication; weak project management experience and community relations skills; and limited ability to maintain refugee interest without compromising their welfare benefits. One project could not overcome these hurdles and closed down in 1984. Another drew back from market par- ticipation and redefined itself as a training program. With one exception, household incomes did not exceed $800 per year. Although the study was able to enumerate lists of potential causes for difficulties in craft, farming and other projects, it could not attach relative weights to each of the factors. Moreover, despite the problems encountered, most projects reported improved fi- nancial outcomes each season. What seemed to be happening was that participants were learning how to increase their capabilities in skill areas familiar to them, and were gradually becoming aware of their need to acquire additional competencies as new difficulties arose. The critical aspect seemed to be this autonomous process by which refugees and Americans learned what they needed to know. In this sense, the projects were microcosms of the resettle- ment program. However, project participants had the advantage of being able to relate cause more clearly to effect, to link marketing activities with sales revenues, for example, and to modify actions accordingly. The ORR as a whole did not benefit from such sub- stantive knowledge. In brief, the study suggested that the ORR had not received funding applications from the projects for a host of reasons. Some participants did not know that funds were available to them, while those who did were often too embroiled in day-to-day work on their projects to apply. In other cases, groups that started to apply</page><page sequence="11">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies for support found their path obstructed by state and local officials who preferred that funds be used for employment services. And one of the most common difficulties was a sense of confusion about the application process. Each application needed management, financial, and operational plans, and projections of ultimate em- ployment and income results. Americans and Hmong who originally knew little about sewing, farming or other business activities and who had somehow muddled through lacked experience in making plans and forecasts, and knew less about the complexity associated with preparing grant proposals. Neither did they know how to obtain outside expertise to help them design funding applications, or to help them accomplish any one of a variety of tasks that needed attention. FEDERAL ASSISTANCE TO HMONG PROJECTS At the beginning of FY 1984 the study's labor economist suggested that regular employment services, administered by the states or supported through targetted assistance and the Highland-Lao in- itiative, held greater promise for increasing refugee employment than did the self-help projects. The economy was recovering, service staff had become better acquainted with Hmong characteristics, and the economic rate of return to such efforts was much higher than to the projects. Moreover, since research in CETA had dem- onstrated the considerable value of vocational training, and since the refugee program contained almost none, the economist thought that ORR might be wise in supporting activities which were backed by some modicum of empirical evidence. At the same time, funding did not appear to be the crucial constraint on projects. They had in any case done reasonably well without public support. Anthropologists, linguists and social workers who composed the rest of the study team did not agree. Their separate conclusions, taken from opinion surveys, were that employed Hmong were not satisfied with minimum wage earnings or with working conditions associated with such jobs and that the employment agencies they had looked at were not performing well in terms of quantity or quality of placement. Actually, the economist and the others agreed on the numbers. The disagreement was on interpretation of the numbers and on belief in the availability of alternatives. The econ- omist believed that the Hmong had few choices but the entry- level jobs. The others believed that there were alternatives, such as the projects; ORR staff, whose members were also drawn from the areas of anthropology, linguistics and social work, shared this view. The ORR was, in any case, already supporting employment services through social service, targetted assistance and initiative grants. It wanted to try something different. Focusing on the characteristics of projects described by the economist, the ORR began FY 1984 (after Congress raised targetted assistance and initiative appropriations to $81.5 million) by funding preparation of a national register of experts who lived near the projects and who could provide useful assistance in grant writing, in technical and managerial aspects of project implementation, 129</page><page sequence="12">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies or in helping to search about for necessary expertise. It backed up the register with funds to help projects pay for consultant help. In places where the register had not yet found names, ORR ad- ministrators visited project sites, helped Hmong outline their pro- posals, and looked for individual Americans or state and local agencies to translate the outlines into final submissions. Finding that American experts were limited by their inexperience with Hmong, and believing that existing projects provided a corps of Hmong and Americans who could share their acquired expe- riences with each other and with new ventures, the ORR funded a practitioners workshop in early 1984 that brought together all key participants from existing farming projects, their counterparts from 12 projects about to begin, several of the experts uncovered by the national register, and ORR officials who could help older and newer projects prepare funding proposals. Almost all farming projects would receive some Federal support during FY 1985 if they got their proposals in on time. Other projects, including craft ventures, were also beginning to receive managerial advice from private consultants and local government personnel identified by the national register. EVALUATION OF FEDERAL ASSISTANCE At the beginning of FY 1985, preliminary results of an ORR-spon- sored evaluation of targetted assistance and initiative funding during the preceding two years suggested that these programs had had a significant impact. Hmong migration had slowed down, and placement rates by employment service agencies had increased. Although most Hmong projects had not been able to make significant improvements in employment or earnings, an ever increasing number of them were successfully applying for and receiving federal grants. The ORR's evaluators (again, social workers, linguists and anthropologists) did not examine changes in local labor market characteristics, did not compare employment outcomes for Hmong with outcomes for Americans in the same communities, did not compare performance of independent employment service providers with performance by state employment agencies, and did not com- pare the pattern of increasing employment over time with the Cuban experience. The evaluation overlooked the possibility that most of the improvement in Hmong employment during FY 1984 and FY 1985 might have been attributable to general increases in employment following the end of the recession, and to the passage of time required for refugees to adapt and gain footholds in the United States economy. By 1985, knowledge of cause and effect within the Hmong program did not appear to be any more refined than it had been for the Indochinese program evaluations prepared between 1975 and 1980, or for the Cuban program between 1960 and 1975. Over a period of 25 years, one and a half million refugees came and integrated themselves into the United States economy at various speeds, while at the same time the federal government expended several billions of dollars on their behalf. And there was still no evidence 130</page><page sequence="13">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies to suggest that the funds, or the processes by which they were spent, made any difference to the rate of refugee employment. CONCLUSION My own early ruminations about resettlement led me to conclusions that were substantially the same as those produced by reviewers of the CRP and Indochinese programs. I thought, for example, that the Indochinese might have fared better if the federal gov- ernment had located its employment promotion efforts within CETA and its successor, the Jobs Training Partnership Act (JTPA). Such an arrangement might have increased the probability of program initiatives being based on a body of research that linked specific services with employment effects under various local eco- nomic conditions. At the least, it would have been advantageous for the anthropologists, linguists and others associated with re- settlement to become aware of the existence of this type of research in order to learn from it. Outcomes would also have been different, I speculated, if initial refugee dispersal strategies had been thought out more carefully, if better inter-agency coordination at the federal level had been able to reduce system shocks caused by surges of refugee arrivals and announcements of cash assistance cut-backs, if more competent evaluation had been used to guide policy decisions, and so on. My list of defects in the Indochinese program, and the requisite cor- rective measures, was quite long. The problem with the list was that, like other evaluators, I had no evidence or theory to suggest that alternative institutional locations, greater knowledge, improved coordination or competence would necessarily yield superior outcomes. Indeed, the Hmong Resettlement Study suggested that such causal claims were highly uncertain. Apparent differences in funding levels, marketing skills, communication capabilities, management skills and experience, technical expertise, cooperation, and a number of other variables, could not explain why some projects fared better than others. If this rare opportunity to examine and compare 90 small projects, each containing only a handful of actors, could not produce evidence of systematic relationships between input characteristics and outcomes, I thought it highly unlikely that my ruminations about cause and effect in a single large project, such as the Indochinese program, could be construed as rational. Moreover, if comparative analysis could not yield unambiguous causal explanations about projects, consider the heroism required to attempt such explanations for sequences of events covering a period of a decade or more. There were hundreds, perhaps thou- sands, of decision-makers in the policies, programs and projects associated with refugees. These individuals made many more thousands of decisions. Even if my simple conclusions, or those of the Hmong study, had been less ambiguous, it is hard to pinpoint which of the decision-makers "should have" made one or two different decisions. It is hard to describe how they "might have" reached such decisions. It is difficult to discern how their making 131</page><page sequence="14">132 Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies of the decisions "would have" made a predictable difference in a dynamic environment filled with constant demand for all manner of decisions and actions. After two years of participation in refugee resettlement I am able to describe a number of parts of the process in the way that any reporter can tell a story. I can sometimes attribute certain specific events to prior causes even though I realize that they may be irrational guesses. However, I cannot say with conviction that I understand why resettlement programs carried on in the manner they did. I therefore have little idea about how to alter the flow of events. In any case, I am not sure that there is a problem in resettlement that requires address. The refugees seem to be getting on reasonably well compared to their predecessors. What is lacking is evidence to suggest that this outcome is or is not associated with federal efforts. There is, therefore, nothing particularly ir- rational in continuing government expenditures on behalf of refugees. The ORR did in fact direct support to certain types of employment assistance which research suggests is often helpful. Although the many public and private participants in resettlement undoubtedly could have done "more and better," they could also have done "less and worse." For lack of rational reason to conclude otherwise, I am prepared to accept what they did as "good enough" in the circumstances. Although my emphasis on uncertainty in the study of policy and implementation may stem from an intellectual predeliction to impute uncertainty, or from inadequacies in my inferential capabilities, I prefer to believe that different categories of phe- nomena contain different degrees of inherent ambiguity. For ex- ample, the processes that provide roads, dams and traffic lights strike me as being more susceptible to causal explanation. Insofar as the objects themselves are concerned, relevant principles of causality are sufficiently well-established that uncertainty is min- imal. More elusive is a clear understanding of how or why such objects come to be funded, or not funded as in the case of nuclear power plants. At least, however, an analyst can say that absence of funding prevented construction of the dam, or that inadequate funding caused construction delays, or that poor design and quality control yielded an inferior product, and so on. Air transport safety, water quality, energy reliability and many other areas of government endeavor depend on such causal statements. Phenomena which are not based in whole or in part on established principles of causality are more uncertain, especially when causes and consequences both concern human action. If an individual kicks a ball into the air one cannot say why the action was un- dertaken, but one can say that the ball flew through the air as a result. If one individual orders another to do something, the actions of the latter cannot be unequivocably ascribed to the order because the second individual could respond in myriad ways, including inaction. The order itself could be the result of the approach of the second individual, hence reversing the positions of cause and</page><page sequence="15">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies 133 effect. Or, the second individual's action might be the same had there been no order. Facing two such individuals, a meticulous analyst might proceed to ask each of them what the actual sequence of events was. Answers provided by the individuals, as in the Japanese film Rash- omon, could take the form of two stories, each of which might be internally coherent and compelling in its own terms, but different from and perhaps incompatible with the other.27 Alternatively, the two stories might be absolutely identical. In both instances the analyst is dealing with answers which report the individuals' opinions about what caused them to do this or that. The opinions may not accurately reflect actual causal relations. Philosophical discussion about whether an individual can infer his or her own reasons for carrying out a particular action is no less lengthy and inconclusive than the discussion concerning inference from ob- servation of interactions between other individuals.28 Indeed, and on a much more practical level, recent works in the field of qual- itative program evaluation caution practitioners to qualify their statements of causality as speculation, conjecture, and hypothesizing.29 Observed interaction between two individuals therefore escapes unambiguous causal explanation, and it becomes increasingly dif- ficult to posit such explanations when the number of inter-actors is large, and when the period of observation is long. Foreign policy, social welfare policy, and resettlement policy may not be completely unintelligible, but they are certainly areas less intelligible than traffic lights policy. The impact of ambiguity upon the enterprise we call policy analysis is difficult to assess. I like to think of uncertainty as a general challenge to move towards a form of discourse which, as in the physical sciences, understands that uncertainty is a cor- nerstone of scientific inquiry. At minimum I would hope that analysts and evaluators like those who continually criticized refugee resettlement cease making "should or better" recommendations when they cannot support their judgments with unambiguous evidence. Such recommendations are neither better nor worse than those proposed by any other citizen, but they are not the product of what policy analysis is supposed to be about. However discomforting concession of ignorance might be, it sometimes constitutes the most rational statement a policy analyst can make. Tolstoy, it should be remembered, was an outstanding student of policy and implementation who sacrificed little of his reputation when he admitted that he could not determine why things happened as they did at Borodino.

Hume and Collingwood were only two of a great many thinkers who dealt with the philosophical premises of inquiry into human conduct.</page><page sequence="16">Cause and Effect in Refugee Resettlement Policies A good synopsis of their contribution, as well as those of others, is Brown, D.

"The Discourses" contain over 140 case studies, each of which presents the author with at least one certain cause-effect relationship. 3. Tolstoy, L. War and Peace (Simon and Schuster, 1942). Book Eleven, Sections 1 and 2, contain the basic elements of his thesis. To press his points further, Tolstoy also argued that such useful distinctions as could be made between cause and effect became obscured as soon as an analyst placed the battle within a broader historical context. If, for example, the French Revolution marked the starting point for analysis, the battle would register as little more than a trivial incident in a flow of history containing a vastly larger array of causes and effects. In such a context, the generals' orders to advance, viewed as statements of policy for the respective armies, were in fact acts of implementation resulting from prior events. 4. Weber, M.

Exclusion of California, suggesting to Hmong that they would not benefit from new, special funds if they moved, might stem the flow of migration. 25.
