<plain_text><page sequence="1">Christian experience and Hindu spirituality Since the creation of the Secretariat for non-Christian religions at Rome and the second Vatican Council's declaration on the Church's relation to these religions, by far the most important contribution1 made towards a better understanding of the great Asiatic religions in order to assume what is good in them into Christianity is the essay of Jacques-Albert Cuttat: Expérience chrétienne et spiritualité orientale in the volume : « La Mystique et les mystiques»2. The second Vatican Council took a positive attitude towards non-Christian religions by recognizing « what is true and holy in these religions »3 and by regarding « with sincere reverence those ways of conduci and of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in many aspects from what she [the Catholic Church] holds and sets forth, nevertheless often reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens ali men » *. The Church through the Council exhorts her children « to recognize, preserve and foster the good things, spiritual and moral, as well as the socio-cultural values found among the followers of other religions; this is done through dialogue and colla boration with them, carried out with prudence and love and in witness to the Christian faith and life » 5. Cuttat's study follows precisely this recommendation with amazing com petence. It includes in its perspective the whole of Asian religious ex perience, Hindu, Buddhist and Taoist. The first part deals with the method to be followed in the inter-religious dialogue (p. 828-856) and the second part with the Christian assumption (p. 857-1013). In the latter part, after analysing the fundamental doctrines which underlie the spiritual life, he examines the spiritual ways, both non-Christian and Christian, and the respec tive goal to which they lead. He concludes his essay with some striking examples of Christian assumption and considers the spiritual doctrines of St John, St Paul, and the Hesychast spirituality as particularly representa tive and significative for the Christian dialogue with the East. Cuttat's study is extremely rich in insights that are valuable for inter-religious encounter and missionary adaptation; but the manner of treating them is very personal and intuitive; it lacks scholarly precision in the interpretation of ancient 1 The Secretariat for non-Christian religions, realizing the importance of Cuttat's study, had asked Mons. P. Rossano to write a special review of it for their Bulletta. This review appeared in : « Bulletin », No. 2, October 1966, pp. 52-67. 2 Published under the direction of A. Ravier, S.

Instead of tackling the whole subject-matter of this ìmportant study, I have chosen to discuss the method followed in the inter-religious dialogue and the doctrinal presup positions, with respect to Hinduism to which the author devotes his principal attention I. The method of inter-religious dialogue Cuttat advocates the phenomenological method6 as the proper starting point for the inter-religious dialogue. It comprises, as Husserl proposed, two principles : the epoche and the eidetic vision. The first principle means a .suspension of preconceived judgement before the phenomenon itself in order to let it speak. The second principle, that of the eidetic vision, has as its aim the search of the essence (eidos) of the phenomenon. Applied to the religious dialogue, one studies the religious phenomena as they manifest themselves and find out their .signification, their essence. The prime re quirement of a comparative study of religione is the religious epoche7 which does not imply surrender of one's own spontaneous religious con victions not yet purified by the phenomenological ' reductìon ' but merely ' placing in parenthesis ' their incidental modalities. The essence of our religious convictions remains in implicit and latent form and opens out to new spiritual penetration. The inter-religious epoche, different from Husserl's phenomenological epoche, aims right away to reopen the parenthesis, once the proper essence (eidos) of different religions have been brought to light as objectively as possible. The purpose of the dialogue is not to remain at the philosophical contemplation of the religious phenomena or at the scientific analysis of the spiritual essence of each religion but to confront them at the centrai level as far as possible, to examine their inner reciprocai rela tions and to elucidate the assumptive capacity of each of the two types of religion with respect to the other. Cuttat aims at presenting the two religions (Christian and Hindu) as they exist in themselves, putting in relief their difference in nature, quality and spiritual climate. Now, while doing the phenomenology of religion as described, we have to bear in mind that such an approach is possible only in the light of one's own religious experience®. It would be quite legitimate for a Christian to start with his own religious phenomena. At first, it may appear that an inquirer should stand outside or above the object of inquiry and assume the existence of objective facts facing his intelligence. Such is not the case where there is question of the data of consciousness ; and of ali the data of consciousness religious experience lends itself least to such an ap proach from outside. β ρ. 828 ff; 857 ff. 7 Οη the religious epoche see G. Van der Leeuw, Religion in Essence and Manxf estation, (Engl. Tr.), Voi. 2, New York 1963, pp. 671-678 ; 683-689. 8 Convinced that an alien religion can best be understood when we deepen our own creed, Cuttat shows in his Encounter of Religions (New York 1960) how an authentic meeting of religions, a meeting based on a phenomenological ' suspension of judgment', enriches and broadens the various spiritual horizons of mankind, while stili preserving each one's special identity. (Ibid. pp. 16-83).</page><page sequence="3">778 MARIASUSAI DHAVAMONY, S. I. But, is not such an attitude coloured with subjectivism since any pre ference given to one particular religion would imply a judgement of value? Hence, some think that the only way to escape the accusation of partiality is to asserì a priori the fundamental equality of ali religions. Such a position, as we see clearly, is inadmissible because their a priori assertion itself implies a judgement of value, or rather begging the question. To assert a priori the fundamental equality of ali religions it would be nccessary to occupy a ' metaphysical locus' which would be above God who grants revelation and above man who receives it and such a perspective higher than the creator-creature polarity is obviously inconceivable and illusory because there exists absolutely nothing outside this polarity. Besides, a Christian does not begin by passing judgement on other religions but just takes his re ligious experience as the phenomenon to start with and analyses it objectively and tries to grasp its meaning. At this phenomenological level two extreme tendencies of religious ex clusivism and syncretism are to be rejected. Religious exclusivism refuses to acknowledge what is good in non-Christian religions ; it either ignores or misunderstands the principles : anima naturaliter Christiana; grafia non destruit naturami sed praesupponit et perficit illam. Religious syncretism on the other hand confuses what is general with the supreme, what is com mon with what is proper to each, and effaces the differences between Christian and non-Christian religions under the pretext that different ways lead to the same goal. Syncretism, as it originates from spiritual confusion and intellectual insufficiency, is not scientifically serious. II. A THEOLOGY OF CHRISTIAN ASSUMPTION Having acknowledged the differences between the Christian and non Christian religious experience, Cuttat seeks the intimate relations which link the two spiritual poles 9. Is there in the Hindu spiritual experience a fundamental attitude of man, a centrai orientation, which would be in com plementary relation to the fundamental attitude of Christian experience? Is it possible to connect in a unity of spiritual tension the two currents of spiritual experience without confusing or separating them, somewhat similar to the mystery of Incarnation in which human nature and divine nature are united without confusion or separation in the indivisible person of God-man? If so, a further question arises. Given the fact that the relation of tension between Christian and non-Christian religions cannot be one of simplq juxta position but one of hierarchical subordination, which of the two religions is capable of including the other without mutilating its essential positive values? More precisely, which of the two is comprehensive enough to as sume the other and perfect it? If there exists between man and God who is the Absolute Person a distance across which man is confronted with God who reveals himself to him, then the orientai spiritual experience can be assumed into Christian experience. There is no other metaphysical ' locus ' outside of this biblical confrontation for the meeting of religions. If the absolute distance between 9 ρ. 860 ff.</page><page sequence="4">CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE AND HINDU SPIRITUALITY 779 God and man is bridged effectively by grace, then the inclusion of non Christian spiritual experience is not only possible but real. And if such a grace is susceptible of being received, really welcomed by man, then the non Christian experience ought to be assumed de facto into the Christian ex perience. And this assumption will be realized in the measure in which super natural grace will be freely and concretely received and accepted by man. Cuttat does not go beyond merely alluding to the theology of Christian assumption of non-Christian religious values10. In other words, here is im plied a theology of missionary adaptationu, which we consider important to outline briefìy in the light of the teaching of the second Vatican Council. Missionary adaptation, as we understand it, is not merely one of ex terior accommodation, not just an attitude which would avoid judging un charitably and without sympathy other people's values, thougb these are no doubt comprised in it; but above ali, it is an incorporation of their cultural and religious values into Christianity by assimilating and elevating them, by perfecting them. It is not merely a pedagogical method by which the Gospel message could be imparted easily and fruitfully in a way best suited to the capacity and dispositions of the recipient and therefore could be con veyed by means of examples, forms of understanding and expressing, that are congenial to thesè people's mentality and way of thinking. Missionary adaptation consists essentially in assuming and elevating whatever is true, good and beautiful in non-Christian religions according to each one's specific character and genius12. The second Vatican Council's decree on the missionary activity of the Church clearly indicates that the missionary adaptation derives its true mean ing only when it is considered in the light of the Incarnation and the divine economy of salvation, and in the perspective of the Catholicity of the Church. « Equidem ad instar oeconomiae Incarnationis, Ecclesiae noveilae in Christo radicatae Apostolorumque fundamento superaedificatae, in admirabile commercium assumunt omnes divitias nationum quae Christo datae sunt in haereditatem »13. 10 ρ. 864. 11 Οη this subject see the following studies: Ο.

I. Any universal religion claiming to lead ali men to God must necessarily pQssess the efficacious means of uniting them to God and fulfìi the aspira tions of mankind; Christianity is such a religion because it was instituted by Christ, the universal Redeemer, and continues his redemptive work by virtue of his power in her. Jesus Christ through the instrumentai role of his humanity and of his «created grace» is the source of every grace, just as God is the source of ali being. As in God every perfection of being is found in a supereminent manner, so also in Christ is found the plenitude of grace and supernatural efficacy, by which he not only can effect every work of grace but also can' lead others to grace. « It was the good pleasure of the Father that in him (Christ) .should ali the fulness dwell »14. St Paul speaks of what God has done for ali men through Christ : « and through him to reconcile ali things unto himself »l5, and « in him ye are made filli ». The fulness of grace is in Christ and it is by him that this fulness is made available for ali men. New Testament scholars16 think that Paul might have used the term, fulness, in a quasi-technical sense of the Collosian ' heretics ' who were teaching that Christ was not the fulness of the Godhead but only one of many partial manifestations of the Godhead. Paul, com batting them, insists that the whole fulness of the Godhead was in Christ alone and that no other manifestation was necessary or even possible17. The Church according to St Paul is said to be « the fulness of him that fìlleth ali in ali » 18. Christ fills the whole universe ; « in him ali things hold together»19. Christ fills especially the Church and makes it a living whole through which he realizes his purposes and thus the Church is his body. Christ not only fills the Church but also is filled up or completed by the Church, for without the Church Christ would not be complete. The Church continuing the work of Christ and extending his efficacious presence in time and space is the pleroma of Christ. She is the pleroma of Christ not only because she undergoes the influence of Christ's grace fully but aso because she completes him by building up his my.stical body. Just as the soul cannot exercise its functions fully without the help of its body, so does also Christ by his own free choice need the Church to carry out his redemptive design20. See also Const.

The Church ought to make herself ali to ali to gain ali men to Christ21. She therefore ought to be supracultural, supraracial and supranational mater omnium gentium. In other words, she has to transcend the limits of every society. In fact, the catholicity of the Church demands that she be destined to ali peoples and possess power in herself to fulfil her salvific mission. As the pkroma of Christ she is both the channel of grace to ali men and the organ of completing the whole Christ. Christ's transcendence over ali other religious leaders of mankind and over ali other manifestations of the Godhead and the Church's catholicity provide therefore the ultimate reason why non-Christian religions have to find their fulfilment in Christ and in the Church and consequently are also the reason why not only ali other religions have to be adapted to the Church, but she also should adapt herself to ali of them. The necessity for the Church to assume and elevate the religious values of non-Christian religions would be better understood if we consider the problem of adaptation in the perspective of the relationship between grace and nature. By grace we here mean the whole supernatural economy of .salvation, including the supernatural revelation, incarnation and redemption, grace and the supernatural destiny of man. Nature is understood in the sense of historical man whose human and religious values are involved in the economy of grace. First, grace does not destroy nature but perfects it. Grace is not given to man in such a way as to undermine, much iless suppress, his religio moral perfections already rooted in the economy of salvation but to perfect them and to help realize them more fully. Hence the Christian religion has not to fili a void as if other religions have nothing good in themselves, nor should it arbitrarily impose on them a particular culture or way of life; but it has to perfect them by assuming them and elevating them to the supernatural order. Every non-Christian religion has its specific values of truth and goodness and these, far from being done away with for the sake of uniformity, have to be on the contrary respected, preserved and integrated into the Christian message. The Church, as universal and transcendent as Christ himself, embraces in her fold every diversity of race, language, culture and manners in order to complete Christ. The pregnant and complex character of the Church's universality itself indicates the ever expandable multiplicity of human forms which can become part of the unique mystical body of Christ. Secondly, grace perfects nature both by remedying nature's own de ficiencies and by giving its own perfections. If in non-Christian religions there are omissions, insufficiencies, errors and superstitions, it is the Church's mission to examine them and remedy them. The attitude in this is not one of sterile, wholesale condemnation but one of sympathetic understanding with the intention of purifying and enriching them. Besides, the religious values of non-Christian religions would reach their total perfection when they find their fulfilment by their insertion into 1 Cor. 9, 22.</page><page sequence="7">782 MARIASUSAI DHAVAMONY, S. I. Christianity. A phenomenological analysis of Hinduism, for instance, shows clearly that the Hindus have very often responded to the profoundest aspira tions of their religious nature through a variety of religious experience, through prayers and sacrifices, through deep meditation and contemplation, through love and self-surrender to God. Hinduism is known to insist on frequent experiences of the divine, inner striving for purity and asceticism, faith in and hope for final liberation, grace (prasàda), incarnation (avatàr) ; and above ali, it longs for mystical union with God. Hindu devotional litera ture bears ampie testimony to a hunger for salvation; the more significant fact in ali this is that they manifest forcibly a thirst for a good and gracious Saviour. It is the duty of the Church to probe more deeply and thoroughly into these manifestations and bring these religious strivings to fruition in Christ. Moreover, in the present historical order of salvation we cannot consider non-Christian religions as purely naturai or man-made. Every non-Christian people have been called to the supernatural end. By the fact that Christ has worked the salvation of ali men, they are ali related to him in some way. The incarnational presence of Christ in the heart of humanity has already consecrated the whole world; what is wanting is an individual's, a nation's, a culture's willful acceptance of, and submission to, the sovereignity of Christ. In the course of history non-Christian people with God's help have developed their own religion and have been unawares tending to Christ. Especially in higher religions there have been so many signs of .supernatural striving towards Christ without knowing explicitly the Christian message; e. g., great many mystics of Hinduism are no doubt God-filled souls ... Even doctrinally, there have been valuable insights into religious truths in these religions. Their deeply spiritual experience and religious truth cannot be ex plained except on the supposition that God has helped them in a special way. Thirdly, grace perfects nature not according to its own way but ac cording to the way of nature. Christianity cannot perfect the native re ligion merely by taking it as something common to ali but should take it as an individuai religion endowed with its,own specific way of responding to God's calling in Christ. The purpose of the mission is to constitute an indigenous Church not only with its own hierarchy but also having as its own ali that faith is capable of animating and making alive when it is as.similated to a new mentality22. Faith is a mystery of alliance between God and man; it results both from the speech of God and from the depth of man's soul. So does the expression and development of faith result from an alliance between the word of God and the special form of the mentality of the recipient23. It is this kind of adaptation that contributes to the variety that should be found within the unity of the Church. The human reality of Christ has played an essential role in the revelation of the mystery of God-man. Hence also the Church prolongs his mission of re demption of mankind by incarnating the Christian message progressively in ali peoples. The Church's intimate presence among the peoples and cultures she evangelises is ali the more necessary if evangelisation were really to 22 A.-M. Henry, Esquisse d'une théologie de la imissiott, Paris 1959, p. 206 ff. 28 Ibid. p. 209.</page><page sequence="8">CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE AND HINDU SPIRITUALITY 783 be the historical rooting of the mystery of Christ in the spiritual path of a people and be characteristic of the salvation offered to ali in Christ. The purpose of adaptation, then, is the building up of the mystical body of Christ according to the exigencies of nature and grace. It is not simply a cultural adjustment of human circumstances to Christ's message. III. Dialogue with Hinduism a) The phenomenon of spirituality : Spirituality is a basic human phe nomenon. There have been always and everywhere people who, not content with the ritual or moral observance, tend to prefer in a heroic degree the supraterrestrial to the terrestrial. Spirituality, as religion itself, could be defìned as the sum-total of ways and attitudes which are methodically pur sued and verifiable by the manifest progress in man's aspirations to union with an ultimate Reality24. Spiritual life does not imply only preservation from grave failures or mere occasionai intimate experience but a conscious and Constant union with the supreme Reality. Cuttat takes yoga as the archtype of Asiatic spirituality and analyses it phenomenologically 25. In the yoga-sutras eight limbs (atigas) or aids are prescribed for growth in spiritual life. The first two, abstention (yama) and observance {niyasma) pertain to the aspirante' moral attitude towards the outer world and towards himself. Abstention consists of five self-restraints described as non-injury, truthfulness, non-theft, sexual abstension, non-greed . Observance is five fold : cleanliness, contentment, austerity, study of sacred Scriptures, atten tiveness to God. The third step consists of various yogic postures (àsanas) the principal purpose of which is the total cessation of our consciousness of possessing a body. They are a prelude to cultivate poise and balance, to 'neutralize' the consciousness of the self and of the world. Once uni versalized, impersonalized, one's consciousness reaches more easily to transcend the cosmos in order to be totalised, to be liberated from body and non-self. The fourth step is the practice of pràndyàma which can be described as voluntary control of inbreathing, outbreathing, and holding the breath, the intended purpose being the levelling or ' appeasement ' of thought, sensations and sentiments. The control of breath prepares for concentration of mind, for the annihilation of fluctuations of consciousness. The fifth stage is the withdrawal (pratyàhàrrì) of the senses from their own functions; this is intended to produce bodily calmness. The last three degrees of yoga constitute the state of reintegration of the self; they are concentration (dhàranà), meditation (dhyàna) and con templation (samàdhi). The first is the application of the mind's attention to a particular thing or idea without wandering away from it. The second is the continuity of ideation; in it the play of thought goes on with re ference to the object of attention without passing away to other things. Finally, in the enstatic state of samàdhi the distinction between the subject and object is totally surmounted and there is pure objectless consciousness 24 Cuttat's study, ρ. 830. 25 ρ. 833-842.</page><page sequence="9">784 MARIASUSAI DHAVAMONY, S. I. and integration of the self. This state is described by O. Lacombe as enstasis of the act of knowing in the act of existing 2&lt;!. The state of the liberated yogin is called kaivalya (aloneness). Cuttat's phenomenological exposition of the spiritual experience of yoga is in general correct and praiseworthy. But his interpretation of the ulti mate stage of Yoga is far from clear and accurate. To begin with, he speaks as if Yogic samadhi, Buddhist nirvana and Zen satori were one and same experience27. Limiting ourselves to the main points, we make the following observations on this issue. Nirvana (in Pàli, nibbàna which literally means ' exstinguishing ' blow ing out ') according to Hlnaydna is said to be the cessation of suffering, earthly misery; it is a state in which desires and passions have been con sumed; in which cease ali activities (cittavrttinirodha) and ali becoming (bha vanirodha). But many passages in the Pàli Canon emphatically reject this negative notion of nirvana and identify it positively with the highest bliss 28. It is said to give happiness here and hereafter29. Logically such a state should imply complete cessation of consciousness ; but the Buddhists discuss whether in practice it is so. Practically, then, the ultimate nirvana means a happy death without fear of rebirth. For the Mahàyànist, on the con trary, the idea of nirvana is a mere illusion30. Besides, the Buddhists do not admit the existence of the self as a substantial being and therefore it does not seem to be accurate to speak of nirvana as the experience of the self in its profound ontological act of existing. In Zen Buddhism satori is psychologically interpreted as « an insight into the unconscious » and ontologically as « an encounter with the trans cendent ». Zen discipline consists in looking into one's own subjectivity and becoming the witness of creation where ali things come out of Emptiness, to use Zen terminology. Zen is a way of life to be attained by spiritual illumination (satori) and must be classed as a form of mysticism; only in its secularized form does it become a purely psychological technique. Satori in Suzuki's words can be described as follows : « A penetrating insight is born of the inner depths of consciousness, as a source of new life has been tapped »31. A japanese bonze expresses the nature of satori thus : Enlightenment is an overwhelming inner realization which comes suddenly. Man feels himself at once free and strong, exalted and great, in the universe. The breath of the universe vibrates through him. No longer is he merely a small, selfish ego, but rather he is open and transparent, united to ali, in unity. Enlightenment is achieved in zazen (Zen meditation), but it remains effective in ali situations of life. Thus everything in life is meaningful, worthy of thanks, and good — even suffering, sickness, and death. Enlightenment comes in zazen, where man becomes completely dedicated to the Buddha. 26 La Mystique nature Ile et l'Inde, in : Revue Thmniste, 1951, η. 1, p. 138. 27 p. 841-844; see especially p. 848. 28 The Dhammapada 203 : nibbànam paramani sukham. 29 Ibid. 18: idha nandati pecca nandati. 30 See E.

Indeed, en lightenment does not come from without, but only from within. The self is delivered through its own effort32. The Rimai sect of Zen Buddhism, as we know, concems itself little with morality but only with the spontaneous achievement of endightenment and the consequent unleashing of powers hitherto unsuspected. The kaivalya (isolation) of yoga is interpreted as the experience of ahsolute oneness, meaning no more than the isolation of one's individuai self in its own deep essence. It is also called samadhì (literally, ' concentration ' [of soul in soul] and described as a state of pure isolation in which there is no sense of Ί ' or * mine a consciousness of pure detachment both from the world and from other souls. I admit that this experience is some times interpreted as meaning that the soul in its innermost essence is identical with ali other beings but this interpretation does not appear to be in agree ment with the main doctrine of the Yoga-Sùtras. The main thesis of the Sàmkhya-Yoga metaphysics admits plurality of souls and their fundamental distinction from prime matter (prakrti). The text which Cuttat cites to prove that the Yoga-sùtras imply non-dualism33 does not mean necessarily that the yogin becomes an absoiute monist in theory. The translation of the text runs as follows : « [The mind-stuff] from which, as from a pre cious gem, fluctuations have dwindled away, is, with reference either to the knower or to the process-of-knowing or to the object-to-be-known, in the state of resting upon [one] of these [three] and in the state of being tinged by [one] of these [three], and [thus] is in the balanced state»34. This text means that the mind in concentration loses itself in the object meditated upon and that the object is the only thing which is seen in its place, teaching thus rather cognitional identity than ontological identity of the knower with ali that he knows. b) The Divergerne35 : The first difference between the yogic and Christian spirituality is that in the former the moral virtues of the first two steps are merely preparatory to the three last degrees of spiritual ex perience and in no way develop into mystical absorption; while in the latter mystical experience remains subordinate to ethical perfection. Ecstacy as such is never the criterion of spiritual progress in Christian spirituality; the marsk of sanctity are always increased humility, faith, hope and ardent charity. Secondly, in yoga the so-called moral virtues are means of liberation from the empirical self and the phenomenal world. But the Christian vir tues have a positive and objective value in themselves and make the Chris tian conform to Christ. The purpose of Christian virtues is not solely self control, self-mastery, but to contribute to the transformation of the Chris tian in Christ; by them the Christian abandons himself to the divine will. 32 Heinrich Dumoulin, A History of Zen Buddhism, Tr.

The abandonment to God (Isvara) recommended by yoga is only a passing means of attaining to higher perfection in which the object of abandon ment, namely, God, disappears. There is no mention of humility among the virtues of yoga; pride, the arch-enemy of Christian spirituality, is never mentioned in yoga as one of the obstacles of spiritual experience. Thirdly, the ascetical postures (àsana) of yoga are meant to lead to inner poise and balance by means of which the empirical consciousness of possessing a body has to be subdued. Christian spirituality, on the con trary, recommends ascetical practices as helps for prayer, for loving God and doing his will. What is evil is not one's finiteness or embodiment from which Eastern spiritualities seek to escape but aversion from God's will, which alone separates one from God. Christian withdrawal and mortifica tion bear essentially a character of oblation which is not to be found in yoga. The object of Christian renunciation is a gift of God, valuable and willed by God and therefore it could be offered to God in love. The radicai divergence between Christian and Hindu spiritual experience centres around two points : the origin of the world and the notion of person. According to Hindu cosmogonies, the origin of the world is an emana tion, not a creation. The world flows from the divine principle in a cen trifugai movement. Every being is degraded in the measure in which it is estranged from the originai ontological plenitude. Therefore, to go after the experience of the world would only alienate the spiritual being from the .supreme reality, whereas to escape it by asceticism and mental con centration would reintegrate it to the source of being. In the Christian view the world is willed by God and comes into existence from nothing; man goes back to God by making use of creatures; his attitude towards them is coloured by his orientation to God, for or against him, as the final cause. The second point of radicai difference has to do with the inter-personal relationship. Yogic experience is one of aloofness (kaivalya), of solitary interiority, without any relation to other persons. Each self (purtisa) realizes its spiritual, immortai, eternai essence in a timeless and spaceless manner. But such a spiritual realization does not phenomenologically explain the urge in the depth of the soul to commune with other persons, to live in inter-personal relationship with other persons. Other selves remain persons in the exact measure in which they remain as other; a reciprocai relation is established at the level of the most profound consciousness. It is the paradox of the personal 'thou' to be an 'interior' self which at the same time remains as the other for me in its interiority itself. Thus the rela tion to the other is constitutive of personality. Recognition of the neigh bour and of God as per.sons follows my own awakening to myself as person. Hence, yoga can become a solitary technique while Christian sanctification cannot, for in it there is always the exchange of liberties, inter-personal relationship, reciprocai interiority. Given these differences, is it possible to build a bridge between the two kinds of spiritual experience as two complementary poles of a unity of tension, not at the horizontal level as between two sexes, for example, but at the vertical level as between nature and grace? If the answer is in the affirmative, which of the two is capable of receiving the other in its orbit and of polarizing to fulfilment without excluding or diminishing</page><page sequence="12">CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE AND HINDU SPIRITUALITY 787 each one's supreme values? Hindu spiritual experience will not integrate the Christian without mutilating the Christian values because solitary in teriority ignores and excludes reciprocai interiority. De iure the more in cludes the less. Hence it is the Christian experience which is capable of fulfilling, perfecting the Hindu spiritual experience. The constitutive and specific trait of Christian spirituality in general is an experience in faith, faith in God who is the supreme Person. I be lieve him and in him because he reveals himself as a Person summoning me across the infinite abyss between him and me. In the Christian ex perience this divine self-disclosure becomes incarnate. Faith is the act by which I submit myself to God; if therefore God is what Christ shows, then Christian faith is a religious experience. The experience of faith is the most personal and free experience. The Christian believes that God acts in him whether he feels his influence or not; he knows it in faith. If the encounter of the two spiritual liberties — the liberty of God in freely bestowing his grace and the liberty of man in freely accepting it — is the most intimate and personal meeting that we can think of, then the encounter with Christ in faith gives an assurance of the highest degree of ' expe riential' depth. Thus it is the Christian experience as such, mystical or otherwise, which ought to be considered as capable of assuming Hindu spirituality. Can a Hindu practise the inter-religious phenomenological epoche and come to a different conclusion, starting from his own point of view? Cuttat rightly thinks36 that a Hindu cannot hold an inter-religious dialogue as we understand it, because of the very structure of his spirituality which does not permit a dialogue, because it consists of solitary interiority as opposed to open interiority. Actually, the Eastern savants like Dr Radha krishnan, Ananda Coomaraswamy and Suzuki tend to ' relativise ' what con stitutes the originality of the Christian faith and interpret it to suit their own conceptions. Christian experience consists essentially in the apparent paradox of total and, at the same time, mutuai interiority, of an interiority which is transcendent and reciprocai. And this the orientai either ignores or refuses to admit as being contradictory. Cuttat, borrowing the formula of the Chalcedon Council which desi gnates the union of two natures of Christ in one indivisible person, ex plains the dialectics of dialogue as consisting in distinguishing without separating in order to unite without confusion37. By distinguishing one discovers what is not Christian in the Hindu spirituality and by uniting one sees the good elements in it and reintegrates it into Christian spirituality. Distinction dissipates the vestige of syncretism, concordism and confusion and brings out the transcendence of Christianity, while integration is op posed to exclusivism and argues for its universality. It is because Chris tianity is transcendent that it is universal and can include infinitely more than what it excludes. Christianity is not universal in the sense Hinduism is, i. e., in an ' extensive ' and ' horizontal ' manner, absorbing other religions in its fold because of similitude, assimilation and equivalence. But it is »6 ρ. 858 ff. 37 ρ. 864 f.</page><page sequence="13">788 MARIASUSAI DHAVAMONY, S. I. universal ' vertically ' in its comprehension, i. e. by converting, transforming, assuming, ' recapitulating ' the religious values of non-Christian religions. c) The Christian assumption : Firstly, with regard to the conception of the Deity3S, the two religions, Christian and Hindu, differ considerably between themselves. Hinduism as proposed by its non-dualist metaphysicians, holds that the Absolute (Brakman) is supra-personal, has no name or form, no qualities, and is without a ' second ' because it is absolutely unconditioned. The Hindu believes that only the infinite of indetermination and unlimitedness merits to be called the Ahsolute. The God of the Christian Bible, for him, would be only a mode, however legitimate but relative and anthropomorphic, of the supreme Being. The basic reason for denying personal perfections to the Absolute is : omnis determinatici negatio est. Against this, Christianity believes in a living God who reveals himself as infinitely personal, as tri-personal, endowed with attributes because he is absolutely perfect. On confronting with the Hindu Absolute, the Christian view questions the non-dualist's refusai to confer reality to beings other than the Absolute, or to admit the possibility of communicating perfections to other beings. We cannot hold that God is in himself without qualities and cannot reveal himself as possessed of qualities just because we cannot qualify him properly and positively as he exists in himself. Conceding that God in his nature cannot be reached merely by a conceptual ascent, the Christian theologian points out that in the concept itself there is more than a conceptual or representative element, namely a dynamic affirmation of being, pointing to the Absolute. The two Christian categories that are capable of admitting the Hindu Absolute into the orbit of personal God are the ' negative ' theology and the presence of immensity. Human mind's ascent to God according to Christian theology consists of the dialectics of three ways : the affirmative way (af fermatici seu positio), the negative way (negatio seu remotio) and the way of eminence (eminentia seu transcendentia). The Hindu ascent is situated between the negative way and the way of eminence. The Hindu argues that the negative way is the only means of knowing and expressing the Supreme Being. He ignores that the negative way itself, to be intelligible, supposes the way of eminence which underlies both the affirmative and negative ways ali along the march of human knowledge of God. For example, we first affirm wisdom in God : God is wise (via affirmationis) ; then, we deny the same perfection in him : God is not wise (via negationis) ; namely, God is not wise in the way in which we represent wisdom. And therefore, we say : God is supra-wise (via eminentiae) ; namely, he transcends ali our finite wisdom; he is wise in an infinite way. When we pass thus beyond metaphor, and speak of God's wisdom, or of his goodness, though our words and concepts are human, they express perfections of God himself. The manner of our thought and speech is always human, involving composi tion and time, yet the perfections which we signify can be regarded absolutely. Removing the limitations and imperfections which characterize such per fections as they are found in creatures, and as they figure in human thought and speech, we can and do affirm the perfections themselves of God, in whose absolutely simple, infinite being they are realized eminently. The 38 ρ. 867-77.</page><page sequence="14">CHRISTIAN EXPERIENCE AND HINDU SPIRITUALITY 789 Hindu's negative way of knowing the supreme Being in its intrinsic structure implies and leads to the transcendent and eminent affirmation of God's perfections. We have to stress further that the real object of this transcendent affirmation is not the undifferentiated Absolute, imper sonal Principle, void Unity, universal possibility, but God who is the supreme Person. The Hindu ' impersonalism ' does not involve a concep tion which is anti-personal or even, properly speaking, impersonal but pre personal. The Hindu non-dualist ignores the personality of God but the spiritual structure of his theology, far from being virtually or actually ' deifugal ' as in the case of Western Agnostics, keeps its theocentric, natural ly 'deiform' orientation. He is to be made to understand that personality does not in its ontological structure imply limitation but inexhaustible per fection. The spiritual reality which we cali person, that is to say, the intimate mystery which is open to the intimate mystery of the other and the Other, does not split itself into two realms of individuai and empirical self (jivàtman) and universal self (paramatman) but, as a perfection, is open to other beings. Jacques Maritain discerns in the Hindu spirituality not only an experience of the substantial act of existing (esse) of the soul but also a lived, mystical experience of the via negationis, i. e., an experience of the presence of immensity of the divine Absolute in the soul. But the Hindu should realize that the soul in which this experience takes place is neither God nor any of the attributes of God but a privileged metaphysical ' locus ' of the presence of divine immensity and that the presence of one person to another is more immense, incommensurable and unlimited than the solitary presence of the self to itself. Secondly, the Hindu conception of ' creation '39 is admittedly different from the Christian notion of creation. The Sanskrit root srj means ' to emit from oneself, to beget, to emanate from oneself'. And from the axiom of Hindu theology: nothing can come from nothing (nà-vastuno vastusiddhih), we know that creation, as the Hindu conceives, is not production of a being out of nothing preexisting but out of some material cause. Crea tion, for a Hindu, is a centrifugai (deifugal) movement in which the pro duced being is a degradation of the originai, divine plenitude, whereas in Christian theology it is an act of the free will of God, effecting a being with its own new act of existing (novitas esseruii) which depends on him. What is valuable and true in the Hindu theory of creation is that the universe manifests and unfolds something of the divine. But this manifesta tion and unfolding does not imply that the produced thing enters into composition with the divine substance as a substratum but that it is a distinct, participated and dependent perfection. What creation manifests in the Pauline sense (Remi. 1, 19) of the word is not the substance of God but his will, his glory, his providential omnipotence. Thirdly, Cuttat brings in the Hindu doctrine of incamation40 (avatàr which literally means 'descent') to show that it is a desperate attempi to prefigure the Christian mystery of incarnation. He thinks that the doctrine of avatàr is a kind of Hindu docetism 41. But both from popular Hinduism 33 ρ. 877-90. « ρ. 891-97.</page><page sequence="15">790 MARIASUSAI DHAVAMONY, S. I. and from Hindu Scriptures, it is clear that Krishna, the ' incarnate God ' has a real human nature. In the Bhagavadgxtà, Krishna says : « Unborn am I, changeless is my Self ; of [ali] contingent beings I am the Lord! Yet by my creative energy I consort with nature which is mine, and come to be [in time]. For whenever the law of righteousness withers away, and law lessness raises its head, then do I generate myself on earth. For the protection of the good, for the destruction of evildoers, for the setting up of righteousness, I come into being, age after age » 42. Krishna, the Hindu God, does not consort with an apparent human nature but with a real human nature which is said to be his, for he says in another passage, « I dwell in human form » (mànusvm tanum àsritam)iS. The purpose of Krishna's incarnation (avatàr) is not cosmic as in the case of other Hindu incarnations but soteriological ; that is to say, his cnvatàr form allows Krishna to enter into direct and intimate relations with men as their friend and to reveal his love for and surrender to his devotees. But we know that historically Krishna was a mere human hero of the Yódava tribe and that he became eventually deified by the Hindu theologians to make their religion more concrete and personal. Their whole notion of the divine and human nature of their incarnate God is totally different from that of Christian doctrine. However, the Hindu incarnation can be a means of approach to the Christian mystery of Incarnation insofar as there has been a tendency within Hinduism itself towards a personal way of conceiving the religious relationship between God and man. In this context, it is important to point out that the best of what is genuinely religious in the Hindu .spirituality is the bhakti-marga (the way of love to God) by which a devout Hindu strives to love God for His own sake and to surrender to him entirely in total submission. It is unfortunate that Cuttat has not seen the importance of bhakti both at its lower level of devotion to God and at its higher level of mystical union with him in perfect love; thus he summarily dismisses the bhakti aspect of the Hindu spirituality as less conformable to the Christian attitude than jnàna (knowledge)44 In the Bhagavadgltà, bhakti is proposed both as the means and as the supreme end itself of ali spiritual striving. As a means of salvation, it implies detachment in activity (niskàma-karma)45, single-minded attachment to God46, and God-centred life. A whole-hearted self-surrender to God47 is an essential element of bhakti. Such a bhakti is shown to no one else but God in a steady and stable way. To adore, .serve, and love God, to be wholly dedicated to him : these are the marks of a genuine lover of God. True bhakti, for the Gita, includes jmna·. « To them, constantly disciplined, who revere me with love, I give that discipline of the mind 41 ρ. 891 f. 42 4. 6-8. 43 The Bhagavadgìtó 9.11. 44 ρ. 981 ff.

I destroy their darkness born of ignorance with the shining light of knowledge »43. Finally, bhakti reaches its full significance only after liberation; it is only after one has integrated oneself that one can advance towards God49. Bhakti is the supreme goal beyond the realization of one's transcendent self (Brahman) ; i. e., beyond the state unconditioned by space, time, change. Moksa (final salvation) is spoken of as ' the abode of Brahman ' M, ' the nirvana of Brahman ' 51, ' going to Brahman '52. But the GUS's Brahman is subordinated to, upheld by, Krishna because Krishna in his transcendent personality is the ' support of Brah man' 53. Hence, final salvation is above ali a 'going to Krishna', 'a dwelling in Krishna', entering into his substance in union54. This state of final bliss is best described as ' the felt participation of the soul in the total being of God '55. In conclusion, we have to admit that Cuttat's excellent essay merits serious attention and study on the part of those Christian thinkers who want to understand the religious riches of non-Christian religions and bring them to fulfilment in Christ.
