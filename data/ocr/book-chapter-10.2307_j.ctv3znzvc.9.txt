<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> chapter 4  ROBERT BREER AND  THE DIALECTIC OF EYE AND CAMERA S Like Stan Brakhage in the previous chapter, this analysis will illustrate how Rob- ert Breer is another exemplar of an avant-garde fi lmmaker working as a practical  psychologist who looked inwards to his own perceptual facilities. Taking sense as  muse, Breer produced work that compelled viewers to attend to their perceptions  in unique and enriching ways. While he was more casual than Brakhage about  his creative goals and theoretical concerns in interviews, and did not provide  theories on how to engage with his work in the way Brakhage did, the thresholds,  abilities and limitations of visual perception were evidently a creative concern  for Breer. His fi lms once attracted the interest of a perceptual psychologist: I had a scientist following me around at one point. He got excited by my fi lms  because he hadn’t thought of the consequences of this kind of rapid change. And I  never thought about consequences; I just thought about how it looked to compose  this way. (Breer, quoted in MacDonald 1992: 25–26) Breer, then, did not need to understand the scientifi c basis for the perceptual  capacities that he was challenging; he only needed to explore them for the pur- pose of aesthetic effect. Without needing to account for the capacities that he  challenged, he took to exploring perceptual ‘thresholds’, a concept central to  his aesthetic (Sitney 2002: 276), which is also important to psychologists, since  identifying a perceptual threshold teaches us when one mode of experience ends  and another one begins. This chapter will explore thresholds of cinematic mo- tion and depth perception in the context of Breer’s fi lms, illustrating some of the  unique perceptual experiences his fi lms offer. Since Breer is not discussed in detail as often as Brakhage, this chapter in part  seeks to remedy this disparity by conducting a lengthier analysis of his work.

Before Breer’s per- ceptual challenges are discussed, then, the artistic context in which he emerged  will be set in place, alongside an outline of his creative aesthetic. Robert Breer in Context In the years following World War II, Maya Deren, James Broughton, Sidney Peter- son, Kenneth Anger, Gregory Markopoulos and Stan Brakhage drew inspiration  from Greek mythology, Freudian symbolism, modernist poetry and Romanticism.  Robert Breer did not draw from these same sources, nor did he attempt to evoke  interior states in the same way. His early path was guided by twentieth-century  painters: the abstractions of Russian constructivists and German Bauhaus, the  absurdism of Dada, the collage art of cubism and Kurt Schwitters, Henri Ma- tisse’s spirituality and Piet Mondrian’s grid-based minimalism (see Obrist 2001).  Indeed, he began as a painter himself, becoming more interested in the aesthetic  potential of motion after working as a canvas-based artist for several years. Amongst fi lmmakers, Breer drew inspiration from European, geometric ab- stract fi lmmakers Hans Richter and Viking Eggeling. Contemporaries included  John and James Whitney, who developed a machine that could simultaneously  generate images and sound; Jordan Belson, who generated abstractions that were  loosely suggestive of macrocosmic and microcosmic imagery while drawing in- spiration from meditation and spiritual practises; and Harry Smith, who report- edly drew creative inspiration from his experiences on hallucinogenic drugs. As a  fi lmmaker, Breer found a kindred spirit in Peter Kubelka, who also saw the frame  rather than the shot as the fundamental building block of cinematic expression.  Breer, however, remained closely tied to his heritage as a painter. Lois Mendelson  comments on Breer’s painterly approach to fi lm: This relationship between the single frame and the moving image is especially im- portant in Breer’s work for it refl ects his ability to work comfortably within both the  pictorial and cinematic modes, and to use the one as a means of exploring the oth- er. For Breer, work on each individual frame is essentially the work of a painter or  draughtsman, and here he feels free to entertain himself with those options which  are opened to pictorial artists. He considers the striving for a cinematic result an- other part of the work, involving a completely different set of options. (Mendelson  1981: 40) Breer should not be understood exclusively as an animator, since he some- times used live-action footage, and also produced paintings as well as mobile  sculptures.

He used the tools of a painter to make his fi lms, exploring the  transformation of lines and brushworks when they are magnifi ed and projected  onto the screen. These included a self-sticking commercial plastic called ‘Zippa- tone’ (Figure 4.1), spray paint (Figure 4.2), crayon (Figure 4.3) and magic mark- ers (Figure 4.4), alongside collage materials – treated photographs (Figure 4.5),  home video footage (Figure 4.6), childhood pencil drawings (Figure 4.7) and  magazines (Figure 4.8). Formalistic concerns guide his aesthetic, and opposites are characteristically  juxtaposed: soft and hard lines, fi guration and abstraction, stasis and movement,  left to right, top to bottom and vice versa. Objects occupy the frame, making  fast and slow movements, sometimes in repetitions and other times in variations.  Objects are often dislocated from one another rather than moving around in pair- ings, as they would often do in Oskar Fischinger’s animated fi lms, or symmetrically  mirroring one another. Jennifer Burford astutely comments that Breer ‘cultivated  a fake clumsiness, giving his fi lms a recognizable signature’ (Burford 1999: 85). In Breer’s cinematic frame, one does not enter a surrogate space in the tra- ditional sense. Objects typically appear to fl oat on a blank picture plane, ac- knowledging (as with Brakhage’s frame) the cinematic screen as a fl at canvas.  A modernist painters’ strategy (as discussed in chapter three: Greenberg 1995  [1960]), this heightened awareness of the picture plane begins with his very fi rst  fi lms, which closely resembled his formative canvas paintings. The white ‘canvas’  of the cinematic screen was usually built from 4” x 6” fl ipbooks, which began as  a convenience, since they were quick and easy to draw on and lent themselves  to ‘riffl ing’ in order to preview the movement, but their appearance became one  of Breer’s aesthetic tropes. He used relatively simple apparatus – a table with a  camera above it, cards and drawing implements, and he did not use the tradi- tional technique of cel animation; instead he worked frame by frame with card.  While this may seem primitive (indeed, it is the same technique employed by  Émile Cohl, one of the pioneers of animation), Breer’s rationale for not training  Fig. 4.1 Fig. 4.2 Fig. 4.3 Fig. 4.4 Fig. 4.5 Fig. 4.6 Fig. 4.7 Fig. 4.8 Figures 4.1–4.8.

Breer also did not make use of techniques employed by his avant-garde con- temporaries such as direct fi lm, in which the fi lm strip is painted on directly (Len  Lye, Harry Smith), or the optical printer, which allows fi lmmakers to re-photo- graph strips of fi lm while adding visual effects (Ken Jacobs, Malcolm Le Grice).  However, he developed an arsenal of techniques, several of which he would use  in the same fi lm, such as collage, rotoscope, treated photographs, fl icker, tracing  artworks and found footage. He would take techniques learned from one fi lm and  rechannel them into subsequent works. When observing his oeuvre as a whole,  his career looks like an accumulation of techniques, which took confi dent form  by the mid 1970s. From then until his fi nal fi lm in 2003, he produced a range of  works that explored and further refi ned his distinctive style. Instead of building his work from a linear series of scenes, Breer would create  fi lms where images and sounds ‘skip around the way thoughts do’ (Breer, quoted  in Mekas 1962: 16). Figurative objects are as unstable and subject to transforma- tion as the abstract images, and both are treated with equal levels of interest. No  object seems more important than any other; images are treated in an ‘egalitar- ian’ fashion rather than hierarchically (Camper 1997). Daily sights become re-energized under Breer’s hand. Fred Camper comments: Breer argue[s] with the Idealism of painters like Mondrian. To the imagined unity  of things in a realm beyond the visible that Mondrian’s paintings aspire to evoke,  Breer counterposes his ‘kitchen sink’ approach, all the messy physicality of things  in the world. Yet just as Mondrian’s grids seem to stretch way beyond the edges of  the canvases, like pieces of some much larger unity, Breer’s inclusive approach cre- ates fi lms that seem to try to reach out and embrace everything – both the world of  objects and its opposite, the world of ideal forms. (Ibid.) Amidst the fl urry of objects, abstractions and movements, spectators are called  upon to pay close attention to the kinetic and colour-saturated imagery in a way  they do not typically need to in conventional cinema or everyday life. Instead of  providing the viewer with a space for quiet contemplation, Breer opts to create  ‘sparks’ off the screen by placing objects in ‘strenuous opposition’. He comments,  ‘I like violent energy coming off the screen. I think it’s temperamental. It’s how  I played football. I want impact’ (Breer, quoted in Moore 1980: 9). His kinetic  and jovial approach to the craft masks his sophistication, technical dexterity and  knowledge of the medium, yet his works remain relatively accessible while re- taining their integrity as experimental fi lms. The viewer is never far from being reminded that all cinema, including  the fi lm they are watching, is illusory. Filmmaking tools are never far from view.  Sitney comments that ‘[t]he weight of his interests as an artist lies in the crea- tion and breakdown of illusions. For Breer, this becomes clearest when the  materials of the illusions are revealed’ (Sitney 2002: 275). This refl exive self- This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

[Modernist artists] were  interested in the specifi city of their media as well as in the concrete nature of art  objects themselves. Thus they turned their energies to formal problems, creating  works of art which revealed rather than camoufl aged the materials and methods of  construction. (Mendelson 1981: 3) While Breer may have been working within the context of modernism, which  liberated him to create art that reveals its own artifi ce, this chapter will advance  the claim that his work also compels the viewer to pay attention to their own  perceptual thresholds as a means of aesthetic interest, and attend to their visual  perceptions in novel and unfamiliar ways. In the fi rst part of this analysis, the  concept of ‘the dialectic of eye and camera’ will be detailed. The rest of the  discussion will explore two primary aspects of cinematic visual experience that  Breer challenges: cinematic motion and illusions of visual depth. Both will be  considered within the context of research on visual perception. In addressing Breer’s unique use of cinematic motion and depth, the unique  characteristics of his work become apparent. Breer provides his spectators with  perceptual experiences that they will not experience in naturalistic contexts, or  from most other fi lmmakers.1 Once his viewers become accustomed to Breer’s  unique visual style and arsenal of techniques, they will be sensitized to new pos- sibilities for visual experience. Aside from the thresholds between cinematic motion and stasis, and visual  depth and fl atness, other dichotomies that Breer creatively destabilized include  high and low art; the screen as canvas and screen as surrogate environment; and  abstraction and fi guration. Rather than subscribing to the claim amongst ‘purist’  abstract artists that ‘red is red’, for Breer ‘blood is red, and red is red, and the  confusion is possible and right’ (Camper 1997). Breer created an ambiguous in- terplay between both. This ambiguity is evident in Swiss Army Knife with Rats and  Pigeons (1980), where Breer demonstrates how a Swiss army knife can look both  like a Swiss army knife, but also like a red oblong (i.e. how an artist might see it)  (Figure 4.9). In other words, the threshold is destabilized between J.J. Gibson’s  concept of the visual world, in which visual surroundings are engaged in light of  their semantic content, and the visual fi eld, in which surroundings are engaged  Figure 4.9.

With an  outline of Breer’s aesthetic in place, we can consider how his work will be ex- plored within the context of this analysis. The Dialectic of Eye and Camera The discussions of Brakhage and Breer in this book have both been informed  by William Wees’ Light Moving in Time: Studies in the Visual Aesthetics of Avant- Garde Film (1992). Wees coins the phrase ‘the dialectic of eye and camera’ and  uses it as his principal point of reference when discussing the visual aesthetics of  avant-garde fi lm. He begins by explaining that like the human eye, the fi lm cam- era is fundamentally an instrument for analysing changes in light fl ux over time.  As such, it provides some parallel with human vision. However, he also suggests  that the camera risks being tailored to satisfy socially determined expectations  about what an image of the world should look like, rather than capturing the full  range of possible experiences: Any cinematic expression of vision must emerge from the optical, photochemical,  and mechanical processes of making and showing fi lms. Although these processes  differ greatly from those of visual perception, they are designed to produce an im- age comparable to the world we see when we look around us. Hence the conven- tions of photographic realism accepted by the dominant fi lm industry. Because of  those conventions, most fi lms offer a very limited and highly standardized version  of ‘visual life’: focused, stable, unambiguous representations of familiar objects in  three-dimensional space. (Wees 1992: 3) Cinematic vision, in turn, can be erroneously understood as being synony- mous with human vision. What the human eye is capable of seeing and what the  camera is capable of sharing is alike in some respects, but they are also different  in signifi cant ways. While the visual experience of popular cinema bears some  resemblance to everyday vision, it does not capture the full range of possibili- ties, and so exploring the ‘dialectical relationship’ between the camera and the  eye means that you creatively explore the ways in which the two are both alike  and divergent. Collectively, avant-garde fi lmmakers have turned that dialecti- cal relationship between the camera and the eye into a positive, creative force,  producing fi lms that reveal and highlight the difference between the eye and  the camera. The suggestion, then, is that when exploring the dialectic of eye  and camera, the fi lmmaker as practical psychologist asks ‘how is my own vision  unlike cinematic vision?’ How might cinema become a tool to visually attend to  my perceptions in a way that I do not in the natural world? How is the camera  eye unlike the human eye? We are presented with unique visual experiences we  could not encounter in life, nor in commercial works of art.

In order to express some novel visual experiences, artists like Michael Snow  and Paul Sharits expose the mechanical nature of the cinematic apparatus, while  fi lmmakers Jordan Belson and John and James Whitney offer a range of visual ex- periences without making explicit reference to the cinematic machinery. Robert  Breer is another fi lmmaker who was interested in exploring aesthetic experience  by demonstrating the differences between human vision and the possibilities  of cinematic vision. He addresses this dialectic in a way that Wees’ other case  studies – Stan Brakhage, Kenneth Anger, Jordan Belson, James Whitney, Paul  Sharits and Michael Snow – do not. In the context of this discussion, artists  who attempt to provide visual experiences that are explicitly unlike visual ex- periences encountered in the natural world expansively offer the spectator the  opportunity to psychologically attend to visual stimuli in a way they might not  otherwise. Breer’s fi lms, and this chapter, exemplify another unique way in which  the visual system can be engaged. Note, however, that while Breer is being read through a niche set of ideas from  the study of visual perception, viewers do not need to know the science of percep- tion in order to appreciate the visual experiences provided in his fi lms – they only  need ordinary human visual capacities to experience their effects. The perceptual  research explains some of those capacities, and this chapter will illustrate how  Breer exploits them. But knowledge of these perceptual mechanisms is not neces- sary to appreciate his work in the way that Brakhage is understood more clearly if  the viewer has prior knowledge about Romanticism or abstract expressionism, for  example. With this said, the explanations offered here may still heighten one’s ap- preciation of Breer’s artistry, even if they are not required to appreciate his work. Now that the general framework for this analysis is in place, Breer’s work will  be explored in closer detail. This discussion will be split into two sections: the  fi rst will consider how Breer challenges motion perception; the second will ex- plore depth perception. Motion With Breer’s creative context in place along with an outline of his aesthetic and  an explanation of the dialectic of eye and camera, the perceptual challenges pre- sented in his fi lms may be examined. The differences between cinematic and  human vision will be considered, initially in relation to motion perception. Breer’s use of cinematic motion was unique because he never took it for  granted. He used cinema to address his own creative concerns with movement,  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

More than the painters-turned-fi lmmakers who predated him such as Oskar  Fischinger, Dwinell Grant and Walter Ruttmann, Breer did not rely on the  smooth motion, which traditional animators exploited (or aimed to accomplish).  Instead, in a dialectic of eye and camera, Breer explored the expressive potential  of pulling and stretching between the perception of movement and still images,  and balancing on the threshold between the two. In his early career as a painter, Breer followed the ‘neo-plasticians’ Mondrian  and Kandinsky, and practised a ‘severe kind of abstraction’ in which he would  limit himself to three or four hard-edged forms per canvas, each with its own  distinct colour. He comments: I was not entirely at home within the strict limits of neo-plasticism. . . I became  interested in change itself and fi nally in cinema as a means of exploring this further.  I wanted to see if I could possibly control a range of variations in a single composi- tion. You can see that I sort of backed into cinema since my main concern was with  static forms. In fact, I was even a bit annoyed at fi rst when I ran into the problems  of movement. (Breer, quoted in Sitney 2002: 272) His interest in motion assumed the forms of several different types of media. His  contribution to a Parisian exhibition in 1955 entitled Le Mouvement is marked as  a turning point in his career, when he became more fully committed to the artis- tic exploration of motion. In that instance, he contributed a fl ipbook to the ex- hibition entitled Image Par Images – designed to demonstrate the process taken to  arrive at a composition. A subsequent manifestation of his interest in movement  was realized in his motorized sculptures known as ‘fl oats’, showcased in Tokyo  in 1970, which would create an atmosphere rather than a spectacle by moving  imperceptibly slowly (Pardey 2011: 100–4). Breer also became interested in pre-cinematic optical toys. Aside from using  fl ipbooks to chart the creative process of an abstract composition and placing  them in a gallery context, he also built thaumatropes (two-sided panels that vi- sually fuse when spun) and mutascopes – hand-cranked motion picture devices  that worked on a similar principle to fl ipbooks. While the mutascope predates  cinema, it exploits the visual system in a similar way. For Breer, it has the added  appeal of making some of the ethereal elements of cinematic experience con- crete through a tangible object that requires physical participation. Similarly,  fl ipbooks, mutascopes and thaumatropes all have a material presence, and noth- ing is hidden from the spectator. Breer was conscious of the context in which his  fi lms were screened – the darkened room of a cinema hid the materiality of fi lm,  and he also considered the context to be somewhat ‘melodramatic’ (Breer 1973b:  57).

Comparable to Mi- chael Snow’s photograph of the ocean  that eventually overwhelms the frame in  Wavelength (1967), there is an inherent  paradox in fi lling the frame with a still  photo within a ‘moving’ cinematic se- quence, and a simultaneous acknowledge- ment that cinema is comprised wholly of  still images. Cinema itself is built around  creating the impression of motion with  the rapid succession of still images, and  Breer fi nds a variety of methods for doing  so. In Fist Fight (1964), he simply shakes  a photograph of himself in front of the  camera to give it movement. A similar  technique occurs later in Bang! (1986) to  crudely give the impression that an aero- plane is fl ying across the screen. The im- ages are accompanied by the sound of a  plane engine (Figure 4.10). Within this discussion of cinematic  motion, the analysis will be divided into  a series of subsections that describe some  of the techniques Breer developed that  challenge our visual capacities. These  techniques will also be related back to ex- isting knowledge about visual perception  to demonstrate how they challenge our  perceptual habits in unique ways. Flicker Fusion and Phi Movement To begin with, the basis of cinematic  motion will be considered, and how it is  different to motion perception in the nat- ural environment.

To do so, consider the story of a 48-year-old  woman who, in 1983, had suffered a stroke fi ve years previously and consulted  her neurologist with an unusual complaint: The visual disorder complained of by the patient was a loss of movement vision in  all three dimensions. She had diffi culty, for example, in pouring tea or coffee into  a cup because the fl uid appeared to be frozen, like a glacier. In addition, she could  not stop pouring at the right time since she was unable to perceive the movement  in the cup (or a pot) when the fl uid rose. Furthermore the patient complained of  diffi culties in following a dialogue because she could not see the movements of  the face and, especially, the mouth of the speaker. In a room where more than two  people were walking she felt very insecure and unwell, and usually left the room  immediately, because ‘people were suddenly here or there but I have not seen them  moving’. (Zihl, quoted in Hoffman 2000: 140) The subject had a condition known as akinetopsia. While she had good acu- ity perception (resolution), normal colour perception, could perceive depth and  could easily recognize objects, she could not see motion. This motion defi cit was  limited to vision, however; she easily perceived the movements of objects on  her skin, and the sound of objects moving around the room. The fact that her  sense of motion perception was affected without the rest of her visual abilities  such as colour or form changing tells us that there is a region of the visual cortex  that is devoted specifi cally to motion, and that motion is reconstructed by your  visual intelligence rather than passively received. While it may appear to be the  same process, the way in which the visual cortex engages with natural-world and  cinematic motion is different, even if they ‘look’ the same. The experience of  cinematic motion is made possible by two visual phenomena – fl icker fusion and  phi movement. Both of these will be detailed. In its early stages at Edison Films in 1895, fi lm ran at approximately forty  frames per second. This proved to be impractical because of the resulting ex- pense and weight of the fi lm stock. After further experimentation, the scientists  at Edison Films discovered that images photographed slower than 16fps resulted  in excessively jerky motion and a distracting fl icker. Finally, experimentation at  Western Electric led to 24fps becoming the industry standard, improving sound  quality and making mild speed fl uctuations tolerable (Anderson 1996: 55). If you  look at a strobe light that blinks twenty-four times per second, you would see a  discernible fl icker. Accordingly, you would also notice twenty-four fl ashes of light  per second in a traditional fi lm projector unless each individual frame blinks  multiple times. Flicker fusion occurs at about fi fty fl ashes per second, when the  retina is unable to discriminate between fl ashes and the luminosity appears con- sistent. If each cinematic frame fl ashes twice, it would fl icker forty-eight times  per second – which runs just short of the required fi fty. Instead, a three-bladed  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

To create smooth movement in fi lm, each frame should only vary a little bit  from its neighbour. This is common knowledge, but the reason behind it is less  widely known. Phi movement is an optical illusion that allows us to experience  continual movement instead of a rapid sequence of pictures. If the distance be- tween two objects in a frame is adequately close and the time interval between  their transition is suffi ciently brief, we perceive a single object. This does not  only occur in cinema – fl ipbooks, mutascopes and other optical toys like the zoe- trope and praxinoscope work on the same basis. If we were to see the fi ve frames in Figure 4.11 played out at standard speed  (24fps), the transitions from frame to frame would be too dissimilar to perceive  a consistent circle growing bigger and smaller. Instead we would see a rapid al- ternation between a large circle and a small one. In Figure 4.12, however, the  visual transitions are minor enough that we would experience phi motion, and  we would perceive a consistent circle growing rapidly. The visual system is unable to detect the difference between the successive  changes in the static frames of a motion picture and the continuous changes  of natural movement. We supply information when perceiving cinematic mo- tion that does not exist. Even though phi motion appears to be the same as the  movement we experience in the natural world, the visual cortex constructs it  differently. Psychologist Richard Gregory explains the foundation for this  phenomenon: The simple notion that the image-retina system is tolerant of gaps explains phi  movement. For vision needs tolerance, to cope with all manner of inadequacies. . .  This use of tolerance is a basic engineering principle. Moving objects can momen- tarily disappear, as when a running animal for a moment is hidden behind a nearby  tree; but it is useful for observers to see this as a continuous movement of the same  object. The image-retina system tolerates gaps, provided the jumps in space and  Fig. 4.11 Fig. 4.12 Figures 4.11–4.12. Comparison of fl icker (4.11) and phi motion (4.12).

As a fortunate pay-off, this tolerance in space and time al- lows cinema and television to be economically possible. (Gregory 2004: 118) As we shall see, both fl icker fusion and phi movement become pertinent when  considering Breer’s unique use of cinematic motion. While he never altered the  cinematic apparatus so as to expose the process of fl icker fusion, he visibly and  self-consciously used the frame rate of 24fps as a given structure within which to  explore creative options – one may speculate whether he might have fl uctuated  the shutter speed as an extension of his aesthetic if he had the means to do so.  He also found ways to challenge the illusion of phi motion, which will also be  considered. Thorough illustration is particularly valuable when discussing the work of  Robert Breer. A string of consecutive frames from a Breer fi lm elucidates the  method by which he creates his effects, because an individual frame carries a  small but vital unit of what is needed to create the overall experience. While per- ceptual ambiguity (balancing on the thresholds between stasis and motion, depth  and fl atness) serves as an expressive cornerstone of his fi lms, the individual frame  possesses a simple clarity when viewed on a page. Played in succession, however,  a new ambiguity arises. Robert Breer commented: ‘I think even in painting the  clue to what I do has something to do with ambiguity and controlling ambiguity  and making it dramatic . . . to get ambiguity as an expressive feature of the thing’  (Breer, quoted in Cote 1962: 17). The various techniques that Breer developed  to challenge the perception of cinematic motion will be schematized. Flicker The fi rst technique to be considered that Breer utilized when exploring the  camera-eye dialectic is the fl icker effect. He is not the only artist to employ this  technique, but he is closely associated with it. While the fl ickers of Peter Ku- belka, Tony Conrad and Paul Sharits feel ‘structural, turbulent, [and] sometimes  violent’ (Burford 1999: 100), Breer’s fl ickers feel jovial, like fl ipping through a  deck of cards. Discussing part of the rationale behind the fl icker effect in his fi lm,  Peter Kubelka said the following: Cinema is not movement. This is the fi rst thing . . . Cinema is a projection of stills –  which means images which do not move – in a very quick rhythm. And you can  give the illusion of movement, of course, but this is a very special case, and the fi lm  was originally invented for this special case . . . Where is, then, the articulation of  cinema? Eisenstein, for example, said it’s the collision of two shots. But it’s very  strange that nobody has ever said it’s not between shots but between frames. It’s  between frames where cinema speaks. And then, when you have a roll of very weak  collisions between frames – this is what I would call a shot, when one frame is very  similar to the next frame.

One reason Breer provides strong collisions, then,  was for the purpose of revealing the artifi ces of cinema instead of concealing  them. Drawing an analogy between the fi lmmaker and magician, he once sug- gested that ‘The hat should be transparent and show the rabbit.’ (Breer 1973a:  70). Exploring the dialectic of eye and camera by demonstrating how ordinary  vision and cinematic vision are different, Breer chose to dispel the impression  that we are looking at consistent objects in motion when viewing cinema. If each  visual collision is suffi ciently strong, the viewer will register each of the twenty- four frames per second, rather than relaxing the eye onto seemingly consistent  objects through phi motion. His fi rst fi lm to exploit this technique was the ten  second loop Image by Images 1 (1954), which was composed entirely of dissoci- ated shots lasting a single frame. This was followed by Recreation (1957), which  also contained frames suffi ciently different that they would be experienced as a  string of strong collisions, rather than a smooth passage of time with consistent  objects in motion (Figure 4.13). While the use of single-frame sequences had been used previously (in Man  Ray’s Retour á la Raison (1923) and Fernand Léger’s Ballet Mécanique (1924) for  instance), Sitney accredits Breer as the pioneer of the ‘fl icker fi lm’ and discusses  the implications of this style: conventionally, only tiny variations in the shape and position of images are per- mitted by animators to give the illusion of a continuous naturalistic motion. Breer’s  invention was to abolish all of the slight variations and to project a continuously  repeating strip of fi lm in which each frame was essentially independent of the oth- ers. Thus any sense of continuous movement would have to be replaced by a more  Fig 4.13 Fig. 4.14 Fig. 4.15 Figures 4.13–4.15.

(Sitney 2002: 273) Once visually accustomed to the visual speed of the fl icker effect, the viewer may  notice more details as the mind quickens and visually attends to the screen in  an alert state. Viewers pay attention to minute scales of time (24th of a second)  when encountering a fl icker fi lm – scales of time we do not typically pay atten- tion to outside aesthetic contexts. Here, the mechanical apparatus of cinema is  exposed in the fl icker fi lm. Wees comments: What projectors are designed to hide, the fl icker effect restores to visibility. It prevents  the smooth fusion of frames normally perceived during fi lm projection. Through this  rupture in the normal perception of the cinematic image, one can catch a glimpse of  the discontinuous and mechanical processes that underlie the seemingly continuous  and natural fl ow of images on the screen. (Wees 1992: 151–52) Breer used this technique throughout his career. In Eyewash (1959) live-action  frames collide, and in Rubber Cement (1976), sketched abstractions combine to  produce a fl icker effect (Figure 4.14). In What Goes Up (2003) Breer uses family  photos of his daughter and grandson playing in a park in rapid succession to cre- ate a fl icker sequence (Figure 4.15) Fusion Flicker The second technique that offers an unconventional perceptual experience re- sembles the fl icker effect, but will be termed the ‘fusion fl icker’. Like the conven- tional fl icker, each frame is radically different to the preceding one, creating a  series of strong collisions. The difference is that in the fusion fl icker, two or more  frames rapidly alternate back and forth, visually fusing with one another. In both,  the viewer pays attention to minute scales of time, but the effect is different. There are two ways in which the fusion fl icker is manifest. In the fi rst, solid  colours rapidly alternate, ‘[blending] together in the viewer’s eye’ to create ‘a  uniquely cinematic color fabric’ (Mendelson 1981: 23). While the frames appear  separate and distinct when observed as freeze-frames, they take on ‘a third colour  of electric intensity’ (ibid.: 4), which exists only in the spectator’s visual cortex  and not on the screen. Colours become pulsating and ephemeral, assuming a  ‘shimmering opalescent quality’ (ibid.) when experienced in rapid alternation.  This occurs in Eyewash (Figure 4.16). Seven years later in 66, a bulb-shaped por- tion of the frame shimmers in black and white (Figure 4.17). Alternation also occurs in Breer’s fi lms when two separate objects visually  fuse – the same effect created by the thaumatrope, in which two objects visually  superimpose by rapidly alternating (e.g. a bird in one image and a cage in another  fusing together). Instead of an ordinary superimposition, the two images pulsate  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

For instance, in Rubber Cement, a woman and a dog visually  fuse to create the impression that they are running towards one another (Figure  4.18). Later in the same fi lm, a lone bird fuses with a sketchy seashore, and ap- pears to inhabit the landscape (Figure 4.19). Some fl icker fusions feature more than two alternating sequences. In Bang!  Breer creates a unique and intricate visual experience in a three-way alternation  (Figure 4.20). Using footage originally rotoscoped in Fuji (1974), a bespectacled  face stares out of a window (A). This is layered on top of a forest (AB). The forest  Fig. 14.16 Fig. 4.17 Fig. 4.18 Fig. 4.19 Fig. 4.20 Fig. 4.21 Fig. 4.22 Figures 4.16–4.22.

Next, we see the face  staring out of the window without the forest, but  with the colours reversed (–A). Thus the alterna- tion goes: A1, AB1, B1, –A2, AB2, B2, –A3, AB3  . . . The spectator experiences a fl ashing, shim- mering scene in motion in which the background  seems partially dislocated from the foreground.  In Gulls and Buoys (1972), Breer ‘segments’ a cat  into three parts: its front leg, its back leg and its  body. Alternating rapidly between the three ob- jects, they fuse to create a fl ickering, shimmering  complete cat in motion (Figure 4.21). A similar  segmentation occurs in Bang!, where portions of  a scene from an American Football game visually  fuse to create a complete scene (Figure 4.22). Again, Breer offers a uniquely cinematic experi- ence of movement, fi nding an alternative to ordi- nary phi motion and inviting the viewer to refl ect  on their own perceptions of cinematic movement. Fluctuation Fluctuation (as it will be named here) is a tech- nique where the number of frames per drawing  varies. Producing smooth movement in anima- tion requires a small change in position with each  frame, although moving objects and characters  are often shot ‘on twos’ – meaning that each  drawing is shown for two frames. By commercial  standards, twelve drawings per second is the low- est possible number of images per second one can  use without being considered objectionably jerky  (Williams 2009: 75). For Breer, one drawing may  appear for seven frames, the following might ap- pear for three frames, the following for fi ve frames,  and so on. In LMNO (1978), for instance, we see  a tumbling spray can. Instead of seeing a new im- age every frame in a series of weak collisions, we  Figure 4.23.

The number of frames with which each image remains onscreen, therefore,  fl uctuates. Exploring the domain between motion and still pictures, Breer pos- sessed ‘a heightened awareness of the operation of the single frame as the locus of  the tension between the static and the moving’, according to Sitney (2002: 272).  This technique offers viewers occasion to consider how cinema plays upon their  perceptual capacities in order to create the impression of motion. In a Breer fi lm,  movement is staggered momentarily to show the viewer how the impression of  motion is created, before resuming back to ordinary phi motion. Sitney referred  to his work as ‘the fusion of stills into fl owing motion and then back again’ (ibid.:  276). Lois Mendelson suggests that Breer’s ‘creative limitation’ is the ‘relentless tem- poral fl ow’ of fi lm – continual movement is his constraint. She compares Breer  with the painter Paul Klee, who wanted to imbue static imagery with the feeling  of motion, while Breer conversely wanted to allow spectators to experience each  cinematic frame as a static picture in and of itself as well as part of a sequence: the attempt to defi ne the limits or thresholds of their respective media and to push  beyond them as a strategy for expanding their aesthetic options led both Klee and  Breer to incorporate ambiguity as a concrete feature of their work. (Mendelson  1981: 31) Again, Breer explores the dialectic of eye and camera by demonstrating how phi  motion may be pulled back to the threshold of perceptibility by providing what  appears to be a series of still images transforming into motion and back. Our  visual facilities are again engaged in a way that they are not in the natural world. Phi Disruption In addition to fl icker, fl icker fusion and fl uctuation, Breer offered a unique per- ceptual experience by creating a uniquely cinematic distortion of phi motion  with a technique that will be called phi disruption. This technique sits at the  threshold between phi motion and the fl icker effect with a series of pictures in  which objects might undergo strong collisions in colour, but weak collisions in  shape. Phi motion is neither conventionally exploited to achieve an impression  of smooth motion, nor is it discarded through strong collisions. Instead, it is ‘dis- rupted’. For example, in 69 (1968), a square moves downwards in a series of weak  collisions, prompting the perception of phi motion (Figure 4.24). However, the  colour of the square and the background changes with every frame. Thus, we are  presented with a perceptual ambiguity: the squares in the frame formally undergo  a series of weak collisions, telling us that we are looking at a consistent object,  while the use of colour creates a fl icker effect with strong collisions.

Instances of phi disruption: 69 (1968 4.24–4.25), Gulls and Buoys (1972; 4.26)  and Swiss Army Knife with Rats and Pigeons (1980; 4.27). Screen captures by the author. again in the same fi lm with a rotating cylinder. The colour of the object and the  background alters with each picture (Figure 4.25). Phi disruption does not only occur with inconsistent colours, however. It is  also accomplished by straddling a fi ne line between strong and weak collisions  with form. From one image to the next, objects are similar enough in colour to  be experienced as consistent, but loose enough in form that our perceptions are  called into question. In Gulls and Buoys, this effect is rendered with a series of  images of a young boy with a series of ‘medium strength’ collisions in form. He is  drawn relatively consistently, but just outside the ‘comfort zone’ with a series of  loose sketches (Figure 4.26). Phi disruption, then, can occur through an object’s form, and also through its  colour. A collision may be relatively strong in relation to one property, but weak  in relation to the other. On other occasions, both properties may cause phi dis- ruption. Swiss Army Knife with Rats and Pigeons, for example, features a loosely  sketched pigeon that walks across the screen (Figure 4.27). In each picture, the pi- geon is similar enough to be perceptually bound together as the same bird, but dif- ferent enough in its colour and form that our perceptions are called into question. This effect is accomplished with the use of a rotoscope – a tool used for tracing  from live- action footage. Patented by Max Fleischer in 1917, the rotoscope was  developed with the intention of rendering animated fi gures with a high degree  of realism. It was used in Fleischer’s own Minnie the Moocher (1932) and later in  Disney’s Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs (1937) for this effect.

As such, each frame is discernible due  to the strength of collisions. Our visual perceptions are pulled in two directions  at once: naturalistic motion is emulated, yet the collisions, as in the case of the  loosely sketched boy in Gulls and Buoys, are just about strong enough that the  frame rate visually registers – like a hint of naturalistic perception in an artifi cial,  explicitly constructed environment. Initially developed by animators to hide  their technique, the rotoscope becomes a tool for the reverse effect under Breer’s  hand. Fred Camper comments: the drawing and movement offers enough to suggest actual scenes and everyday  movements, but is rough enough . . . to also reveal the nature of the medium. Thus  our natural tendency to want to see realistic movements is constantly being argued  with, as we are returned to fi lm rhythms with our desire to ‘soar’ into some other  world taken apart. (Camper 1997) Again, Breer examines his own perceptual facilities, and in exploring the camera/ eye dialectic, he reveals the way in which our propensity to perceive consistent  objects can be stretched and stressed by creating visual arrays that are uniquely  cinematic in their perceptual ambiguity. Radical Phi Disruption In addition to phi disruption, Breer sometimes makes notably bold alterations  to the form of objects in adjacent pictures. In Gulls and Buoys, he rotoscopes a  sequence in which a man rides a bike towards the camera. Instead of drawing  a consistent head to match the body, he draws a series of comical faces, which  change with every image – a relatively consistent body with an inconsistent,  fl ickering series of heads. Again, perceptions are explicitly disrupted in a way  we do not experience in naturalistic contexts (Figure 4.28). In Swiss Army Knife  with Rats and Pigeons (Figure 4.29), we see a pigeon take fl ight. In each part of its  movement, the pigeon is drawn in a different style with a variety of inks, paints  and brushworks. T.Z. (1979) (Figure 4.30) features a series of bodies, which  roughly occupy the centre of the frame. They appear to be separate fi gures, but  are loosely bound together as a single object despite their radical differences, due  to the fact that they appear onscreen for such a short period of time. The visual  system never commits wholly to the idea that it is looking at a single fi gure, or at  a series of separate fi gures in rapid succession. In some instances, the object might be replaced for a single frame by another  object with a comparable shape. In LMNO, a fi sh is drawn in a variety of styles  and is momentarily replaced by a leaf (Figure 4.31).

Motion Summary Amidst the fl ickers, fl icker fusions, fl uctuations, phi disruptions and radical phi  disruptions, Breer includes pockets of traditional live-action movement as a part  of his expressive arsenal. Ordinary phi motion looks peculiar in Breer’s fi lms,  since it is always encountered within the context of his other unique applications  of cinematic movement. It appears sporadically throughout his career – in Eye- wash, an infant child turns his head, T.Z. features a misframed live-action shot  of a patio and What Goes Up features a leaf falling on a photograph of a forest in  ordinary motion. The seemingly ‘normal’ movement of phi motion is defamiliarized in Breer’s  fi lms, but also experienced anew by being reframed within the context of alter- native approaches to cinematic motion.

In doing so, through introspection, he touches on themes that have been  the subject of study by perceptual psychologists, gives his audience occasion to  refl ect on their own perceptual facilities, and expansively provides his spectators  with visual experiences that compel them to attend to their senses in ways that  they do not have the opportunity to when engaging with the natural environ- ment, or other fi lms. In addition, a series of creative techniques that Breer developed across his ca- reer has been schematized. In doing so, the general notion of ‘rapidness’ or ‘fl ick- ering’ may be replaced with a more nuanced set of expressive techniques. With a  clearer sense of Breer’s artillery of creative methods, his fi lms may be attended to  with greater sensitivity. Now that cinematic motion has been explored in detail, the next part of this  chapter will consider how Breer explored perceptual thresholds between fl atness  and depth within the dialectic of eye and camera. Depth Stan Brakhage and Robert Breer were contemporaries, and both constitute ar- chetypal examples of avant-garde fi lmmakers who drew creative inspiration from  visual perception. Both were also interested in the use and subversion of visual  depth in cinema. Brakhage was far more vocal about his rationale behind col- lapsing the illusion of depth in order to engage the cinematic screen with an ‘un- tutored eye’, and resisting the inherent nature of the cinematic lens, which had  been ‘[ground] to achieve 19th-century western compositional perspective’ (Bra- khage 2001c: 15). While Breer spoke less about the rationale behind his creative  goals, this analysis will demonstrate that he was inspired to creatively pull and  stretch between impressions of depth and fl atness – much in the same way that  he would shift between impressions of stasis and motion. While Brakhage fl at- tened the screen by ‘wrecking’ focal attention, spitting on the lens, painting on  the celluloid and applying other methods, Breer developed a different array of  techniques to challenge our perception of depth, which will be explored in detail. The self-refl exive acknowledgement of the tension between the fl atness of  the cinematic screen and inferred depth is not exclusive to Robert Breer. Emile  Cohl’s landmark Fantasmagorie (1908) features the artist’s own hands assembling  the animated characters, creating a ‘material layer’ on top of any inferred depth  from the original picture (Figure 4.33). In some of Breer’s fi lms, we see his hands  over the images, creating a second ‘photographic’ layer of inferred depth, while  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

Screen captures by the author. simultaneously fl attening the original layer. These include Recreation (Figure  4.34), Time Flies (Figure 4.35) and What Goes Up (Figure 4.36). Breer never took the illusion of depth on the cinematic screen for granted. He  originally treated the cinematic screen as a fl at canvas, just as he did the painter’s  canvas. Early work such as Form Phases IV (1954) followed the modernist tradi- tion of acknowledging the fl atness of the screen. In later work, Breer began to  create illusions of depth, only to undermine them, or play perceptual games with  his audience. LMNO features a rotating hammer, which initially appears to be  three dimensional when seen in profi le. As it rotates towards the screen, viewers  discover that the handle is fl at while the hammerhead is not (Figure 4.37). Breer  invites his viewers to be conscious of illusions of depth on the cinematic screen. In Swiss Army Knife with Rats and Pigeons, a second plane of depth is created  when a picture of a monk lifts up from its canvas, creating a ‘material layer’ – per- haps an ironic comment on the idea of religious transcendence. The monk then  turns around. Like the hammer, instead of giving the monk three dimensions,  Breer makes him fl at as he rotates, which could be interpreted as a reference to  the fl atness of Byzantine art (Figure 4.38). Sitney comments that Breer ‘system- atically alternates abstract, linear forms which affi rm the fl atness of the screen  upon which they are projected with forms creating three-dimensional illusions  and a sense of extreme depth in the screen’ (Sitney 2002: 8). Rules of Perspective Like his work on motion, Breer takes a fundamental perceptual facility that is  exploited by cinema and draws our attention to its illusory power.

As Joseph Anderson comments, ‘we only have to cross a  busy street to realize that our lives literally depend on our capacity to locate ob- jects accurately in space’ (Anderson 1996: 65). We are good at depth perception  because our ancestors lived and died on the basis of their ability to know what  occupied the space around them. Any time one experiences visual depth, however, it is reconstructed. The  brain uses a variety of cues to extract three-dimensional information from two- dimensional impressions. David Hubel and Margaret Livingstone explain: As we look around, most of us think we ‘see’ a three-dimensional world. Yet since  each retina is a fl at sheet of neural tissue, all the brain could possibly acquire  through the eyes are two fl at images (one from each eye). The brain must somehow  interpret these two fl at images as three-dimensional space. (Hubel and Livingstone  2008: 100) We do not always construct depth from a visual stimulus, however; we only do  so when the visual information we are presented with conforms to the appro- priate rules. Of Figures 4.39, 4.40 and 4.41, we more easily discern depth in the  ‘Necker’ cube (Figure 4.39), and not so readily with the Kopfermann cubes (Fig- ures 4.40 and 4.41). Even though all three objects depict a plausible impression  of a cube from various angles, only the Necker cube does so according to the  appropriate ‘rules’ (Hoffman 2000: 23–24). We do not perceive depth at any  given opportunity, and since the Kopfermann cubes can be perceived as fl at, sym- metrical objects, the visual system more easily interprets them as such. Of course,  the Necker cube can be experienced as fl at, and the Kopfermann cubes may be  experienced as three-dimensional, but with more of a specialized effort. In an attempt to identify and emulate the rules that the visual system operates  by in order to experience the world in three dimensions, Italian Renaissance  artists developed the rules of perspective, which offered a means of representing  Fig. 4.39 Fig. 4.40 Fig. 4.41 Figures 4.39–4.41.

With the rules of perspective, the artist attempts to represent the  shapes, colours and shading of the real world as if it were seen through glass.  The fi lm camera, like the photographic camera, embodies the principles for gen- erating images according to the rules of perspective. However, controversy has  ensued as to whether these rules, employed initially in drawing and painting and  later in photography and motion pictures, are a natural function of the eye or a  distorting cultural convention. William Wees, echoing Jean-Louis Baudry (1975) and Stan Brakhage (2001b  [1963]), argues that pictorial perspective is ‘a rather unscientifi c mixture of the- ory, experiment, and artistic convention’ (Wees 1992 37), and that the camera  is a machine tailored to satisfy socially determined expectations about what an  image of the world should look like. These are expectations that rest on assump- tions about image-making and visual perception that date back to Italian Re- naissance painting – predating the invention of cinema by several centuries. The  Renaissance theory of perspective ‘[encourages] an implicit equation between  seeing and picture making based on the presumption that vision operates ac- cording to the same rules that artists follow in producing pictorial perspective’  (Wees 1992: 42). Others disagree with this position, and argue that perspectival  painting and photographic imagery are not cultural distortions, but rather they  capture a basic truth about visual experience. Anderson, for example, suggests  that ‘perspective may not be merely a cultural convention, it may be a built-in  feature of the way we see’ (Anderson 1996: 72), since the human eye also utilizes  the same principles as the rules of perspective. The camera lens does not ‘distort’,  then, according to Anderson. It emulates human vision. Whether it is to be understood as a cultural convention or a fundamental  truth about human vision, exploiting and disrupting the rules of perspective be- came a fertile ground for experimentation and expression in Breer’s work. One of  the freedoms afforded to Breer as an animator is that he was not subjected to ‘the  perspectival biases of the lens’ (Wees 1992: 54) in the same way that live-action  fi lmmakers were; therefore, he could exploit and discard them as he saw fi t. Depth Cues In order to perceive three-dimensionality, we depend on depth cues, and these  can take two different forms. One depth cue called stereopsis relies on both  our eyes working together, and it arises from the fact that our eyes each have  a slightly different view of the world. The overlapping fi elds of vision create a  disparity, which helps us perceive our surroundings in three dimensions. Stere- opsis also reminds us that cinematic images, like paintings, are fl at. Most cues to  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

Artists who work with still paintings or photographic images are limited to the  use of monocular depth cues, and these might include foreshortening, motion  parallax, interposition, relative size, relative height, shadow, texture gradient, ae- rial perspective and linear perspective. Before some of Breer’s perceptual ambiguities generated by his use of depth  cues are explored, the conventional emulation of naturalistic perceptions of  depth should be considered. One such depth cue commercial animators apply  is shadows – the shape and angle of a shadow will depend on where the source  of light is situated. In a place with only one source of light (e.g. outside in the  sunlight), all shadows go in the same direction. Objects in Breer’s animation are  not typically illuminated by an imaginary light source, so they do not normally  cast shadows. Animators, particularly those using CG with a wider colour palette, may also  emulate naturalistic perceptions by applying a depth cue called aerial perspec- tive (also known as atmospheric perspective). Here, particles in the atmosphere  scatter light, and blue wavelengths of light are most easily scattered. This is why  the sky is usually blue in sunlight, although scattering also occurs for other wave- lengths of light as well. This has a bearing on our experience of depth. The fur- ther away an object is, the more its light will become scattered. As such, the  more distant an object is, the more vividly it will be cast in the same colour as  the sky. Distant objects also appear less sharp because most of their light particles  are being scattered. Breer never exploited this technique in his work, since he  did not attempt to re-create natural perceptions. Objects were seldom coloured  realistically, and using crayons, pens, felt tips and other ordinary consumer prod- ucts, a more limited range of colours was applied instead of a wide array of hues. For Breer, animation was not a medium to be modelled on live-action movies;  it possessed an expressive vocabulary of its own. As such, conventional depth cues  were not exploited. In the following section, the way in which Breer extended  his exploration of the camera-eye dialectic (exposing the difference between or- dinary and cinematic vision) by providing a series of perceptual ambiguities with  the use and subversion of depth cues will be considered. Like the previous section  on motion, each depth cue will be explored in a series of subsections. Relative Height One of the ways in which Breer generates perceptual ambiguities is with the use  of relative height as a depth cue. In western perspectival painting, the horizon  line is usually somewhere in the middle of the image. As such, the most distant  part of the sky and the ground are in the middle of the image, where the sky and  the land or water meet. In turn, the nearest part of the ground is at the bottom  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

In Breer’s fi lms, spatial  relations are less clearly defi ned, and there is seldom a coherent ‘landscape’, or  a horizon line, which creates the impression of a receding space. Occasionally,  landscapes with horizon lines do appear, briefl y creating spatial depth before  disappearing again. In Rubber Cement (Figure 4.42), the viewer moves laterally  along a beach. LMNO (Figure 4.43) features a boat fl oating along a river, in a  loose approximation of naturalistic colours. A sunset over the ocean features in  ATOZ (2000) (Figure 4.44). Creating a visual ambiguity in Time Flies (1997), an abstract line and circle  shrink, momentarily taking on the appearance of the sun and a horizon line. For  that brief period, the frame appears to spatially recede into the distance. Then,  the horizon line continues to shrink, undermining the momentary illusion of  depth (Figure 4.45).

As is the case with most depth cues discussed, the ambiguity in depth perception  lies not in the individual frame, but in the passage from one image to the next.  This often runs alongside the interplay between stasis and motion. Relative Size According to the relative size depth cue, the more distant an object is, the  smaller it appears to be on your retina. With a mechanism known as ‘size con- stancy’, the visual system does not perceive far-fl ung objects as ‘small’ because it  recognizes that the retinal impression of an object shrinks the further away it is.  We recognize, then, that a distant car is not a toy, but rather it is a normal-sized  car that is far away. Since Breer does not typically orientate his objects in a coherent space or with  a clear horizon line, it is sometimes unclear as to whether objects are big or close,  or whether they are small or distant.

Ambiguities in relative size and motion parallax: ATOZ (2000; 4.46), LMNO  (1978; 4.47), Swiss Army Knife with Rats and Pigeons (1980; 4.48), Bang! (1986; 4.49) and Fuji  (1974; 4.50).

Sandy Moore comments that there is a ‘miasmic’ deep space in LMNO, ‘where  things continually deport for, or arrive from a vague distant horizon’ (Moore  1980: 8). In LMNO, a man either shrinks, or he falls into an undisclosed horizon  and is fl attened with a hammer (Figure 4.47). What does he fall into? Is it a giant  hammer or a miniature man? Is the man in the background and the hammer  in the foreground? We are presented with another perceptual ambiguity that is  never made clear. In Swiss Army Knife with Rats and Pigeons, a knife rotates towards the viewer,  and then seemingly ‘stabs the spectator in the face’ by appearing to move towards  the screen (Figure 4.48). On other occasions, objects move through the empty  canvas of the frame, but are signalled as ‘getting closer’ rather than ‘getting big- ger’ by using implied forms of motion. In Bang!, a fi sh swims imposingly close to  the viewer through invisible water, approaching from the distant background.  Implied motion, then, can be understood as an additional depth cue that is inter- linked with relative size (Figure 4.49). This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

According to this principle, nearby objects move faster in the visual  fi eld than objects in the distance when you are moving through space. In Fuji,  the impression of visual depth is principally created by the speed at which the  objects in the background and foreground move along the frame. In sequence  where the point-of-view moves laterally along a fence and Mount Fuji, there is  minimal use of the rules of perspective (Figure 4.50). When the sequence is seen  in motion however, it becomes apparent that Breer uses motion parallax; the  fence in the foreground appears to move at a greater speed than the mountain  in the background. This abides by principles of everyday perception. To cre- ate this sequence, Breer rotoscoped footage taken from out the window of the  Tokaido Express, a 135 mile an hour train during a trip to Japan. He explains,  ‘What attracted me to the footage was the mountain in the background and the  possibility for motion perspective in the foreground. The fi lm plays with deep  space and the fl at picture plane of the screen’ (Breer, quoted in MacDonald  1992: 46). When the images in the sequence above are seen individually, then, they ap- pear relatively fl at. But in this sequence from Fuji, the spectator is compelled  to perceive depth when the images are experienced in rapid succession through  motion parallax. Our perceptual facilities are pulled in two directions at once  between fl atness and depth – the fl atness of the individual frames, and the depth  as it is evoked by the motion. Foreshortening The fi nal depth cue considered here is called foreshortening. On this occasion,  Breer exploits our perceptual abilities in an ordinary way, but its use becomes the  focus of aesthetic attention. Foreshortening is a depth cue that can be re-created  by closing one eye and using a pen. If you hold the pen at arm’s length and point  it towards your eye, its projected length is small. As you rotate the tip away, the  projected length grows until it is perpendicular to your eye. As you continue to  rotate the pen, the projected length shortens again. This demonstrates that any  line has its longest projection when it is perpendicular to your line of sight. Foreshortening serves as one of the principal aesthetic concerns in 69, where  viewers see geometric fi gures rotate and change in length (Figure 4.51). The ro- tation is not in the service of a larger narrative, or for the purpose of serving to  evoke a coherent surrogate environment in which a story is set. Breer gives his  spectators occasion to simply contemplate the impression, created by the pro- cess of foreshortening, that an object is rotating towards them and then into the  distance.

Foreshortening in 69 (1968; 4.51), Time Flies (1997; 4.52) and ATOZ (2000;  4.53). Screen captures by the author. This technique is a commonplace discipline for an artist. Since Breer works with  the moving image, we pay attention to the transformative process of an object  in its various stages of foreshortening. This occurs throughout Breer’s oeuvre,  such as in Time Flies (Figure 4.52), where an isometric, shape-shifting letter ‘A’  appears to rotate towards the viewer. Likewise in ATOZ, a giant ‘F’ appears to  fall in the direction of the viewer (Figure 4.53). In these examples, Breer’s use of  a depth cue is ordinary, but he gives us occasion to contemplate its effect instead  of using it in the service of a larger narrative. In summary, the ways in which Breer creates perceptual ambiguities for the  purpose of aesthetic interest have been considered. Since he does not usually use  clear horizon lines, it is sometimes diffi cult to discern whether objects are large  or up-close, or whether they are small or distant. We also considered how motion  parallax can create the impression of visual depth, even when images appear to  be fl at when seen individually. The transformative stages of foreshortening, it has  been demonstrated, become an independent object of interest in Breer’s fi lms.  Other depth cues such as shadows and aerial perspective are never applied. View- ers are called upon to attend to their perceptions in ways they would not in other  aesthetic contexts, or outside aesthetic experience. Illusions of Depth and Motion in Fuji Within the larger scheme of this book, the claim has been advanced that by of- fering spectators occasion to contemplate their own perceptual facilities, provid- ing perceptual experiences that are unrehearsed in cinema, and drawing creative  inspiration by exploring his own visual capacities, Breer can be understood as a  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

Providing novel percep- tual experiences, Breer’s fi lms expand our range of possible routes to aesthetic  interest by engaging with cinema in an unfamiliar or under-rehearsed way. In  advancing these claims, two aspects of visual perception have been considered  that Breer explored – motion and depth. In this discussion of motion, names  have been coined for a series of techniques that Breer developed: fusion fl icker,  fl uctuation, phi disruption and radical phi disruption. When exploring Breer’s  unique use of depth cues in order to provide perceptual ambiguities, the focus was  on relative height, relative size, motion parallax and foreshortening. With all of  these specialist terms in place, a single case study, Breer’s Fuji, may be considered  in light of the aforementioned analysis. All of Breer’s trademark aesthetic concerns that relate to motion and depth  appear in Fuji. Here, he negotiates the thresholds between representation and  abstraction, object consistency and inconsistency, motion and stasis, and a vi- sual space that is both explicitly fl at while simultaneously creating the illusion  of depth. At one moment the sonic rhythm slows, and then it picks up speed  again. Live-action footage operates as material for rotoscoping, and raw material  for studies in motion and form. As with his other fi lms, there is a clarity to each  individual frame, but ambiguity arises in Breer’s use of the passage from one frame  to the next, where illusions of depth and motion appear and disappear. The structure of Breer’s Fuji bears a closer semblance to that of a musical com- position rather than that of a narrative-dramatic fi lm. That is to say that a ‘mo- tifi c’ development takes place, using a limited range of short sequences as motifs  and fi nding variations in how each one can be re-created differently through  rotoscoping, and how they might be intercut with other visual motifs. James Pe- terson describes this pattern in the following way: A fi lm introduces a concept and subjects it to a series of permutations. For the  viewer, comprehending this form is simply a matter of tracking the similarities and  differences of the sections of the fi lm. (Peterson 1994: 49) At the beginning of Fuji, viewers are introduced to three visual motifs: a face by  the window of the train (Figure 4.54), a man running across the screen (Figure  4.55), and a fl icker fusion between alternating cylinders (Figure 4.56). Each se- quence is separated by black leader tape. Since there are no immediately obvious  causal links between them, the spectator can intuit that these images are being  used for their graphic qualities rather than narrative purposes. After the third motif is introduced and there is a fi nal brief roll of black leader,  the same image of the man running across the screen reappears; this time he is  rotoscoped. Each picture in the rotoscoped sequence lasts eight frames, breaking  visual continuity and the impression of a smooth passage of time (Figure 4.57).

The fi rst three images in Figure 4.57 visually register as the same man, and the  following two are increasingly abstracted. Viewers continue to perceive the fi nal  highly abstracted image as a man, even though if seen in isolation it looks more  like an abstract shape. Following this, two new motifs are introduced. This time, viewers are only  shown the rotoscoped images and not the original live action source material.  Three distant human fi gures approach, and this alternates with an abstracted  impression of a passing tunnel, which (unusually for Breer) casts a shadow (Fig- ure 4.58). Each image lasts for two frames, as they alternate between the visual  motifs. In a phi disruption, the approaching human fi gures are inconsistent in  colour, but the forms are consistent enough that viewers may assume them to be  the same objects. A three-way fusion fl icker also occurs between the human fi gures, the tunnel  and a train ticket inspector (Figure 4.59). The inspector is subsequently isolated  from his surroundings in the second freeze-frame from the right. All of the im- ages, as they continue to alternate, last either two or three frames each. By fi fty-fi ve seconds into the fi lm, viewers have been introduced to most of  the motifs and the visual techniques that Breer employs in the eight and a half  minute animation: temporal fl uctuations, alternations, and variations of the  same short sequences through reinterpretation with a rotoscope. Variations between the existing motifs are intercut until 1:55, when a new  motif is introduced – Mt Fuji. In this sequence, the visual collisions between  the forms of the mountain and fence are weak (implying consistency), but the  colouring is inconsistent (Figure 4.60). Using phi disruption, Breer provides the  spectator with a perceptual ambiguity in which two seemingly incompatible per- ceptions work in tandem. The form of the mountain remains consistent, but the  colouring assigns the sequence a visual rhythm comparable to that of a fl icker  fi lm. Where does the eye and its interpreting mind focus its attentions? On the  consistent shape of Mt Fuji, or the inconsistent use of colour and its impact on  the frame? Viewers may be more likely to focus their attentions on the consis- tent aspects of the frame, and defer the inconsistent aspects to the periphery of  their attentions. Pulling our perceptions in two directions at once, Breer offers  his audience a dual experience in which they register both the consistency of  Mt Fuji and also the fl ickering inconsistencies running through it. It is also here  where Breer exploits the use of motion parallax, creating visual depth by making  the fence move laterally at a greater speed, while the distant mountain moves  more slowly. At the same time, there is no use of shadowing, aerial perspective  or occlusion to give the impression that the screen is anything but a fl at canvas. Creating another perceptual ambiguity, birds are introduced into the fi lm at  5:10 and alternate frame by frame with Mt Fuji (Figure 4.61). As a fl icker fusion  sequence, it is clear by looking at the freeze-frames that they are drawn separately,  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

This might be interpreted as a playful reference to the thaumatrope – commonly,  the thaumatrope would feature a bird on one side of the disc, and a cage on the  other. When the disc was spun, the bird would appear to be inside the cage. David Curtis comments on the effect of perceptual ambiguity in his summary  of Fuji, stating: ‘The classic outline of Mount Fuji, fi lmed by Breer from a train,  then rotoscoped, becomes involved in an extended speculation on the bound- aries between representation and abstraction. Is it a mountain, or just another  of Breer’s geometric obsessions?’ (Curtis 1983: 19). At 7:10, for example, forms  isolate themselves and detach from their original place and move in their own  direction. In this instance, the snow cap on Mt Fuji becomes an autonomous  triangular shape that moves independently (Figure 4.62). Breer’s fi lm, then, is a rich exercise in the breakdown and re-establishments  of visual illusions one can create in animated fi lm. Object consistency is destabi- lized by fl uctuations, phi disruption and visual abstraction. Visual collisions are  simultaneously weak and strong, and images experienced during phi disruption  and slower fl uctuations appear fl at, while motion gives them depth. Conclusion According to evolutionary accounts, our present visual system had its beginnings  millions of years ago when sea creatures developed light-sensitive pits on the  surface of their bodies, and began to interact with the world on the basis of the  new information that was available to them (Anderson 1996: 26). There is an  adaptive advantage to vision, then. Creatures possessing little information about  their surroundings are at greater risk of being grazed upon by their predators,  while those that can see may take evasive actions, and become predators them- selves. Breer, then, stretches this core capacity for the purpose of aesthetic inter- est, rather than for adaptive or utilitarian purposes. The fi lms that he produced  may be characterized as continually playing at the edge of depth illusions and the  cinema screen’s actual fl atness, and between stasis and motion. Still images begin  to move, and then become isolated images again. The depth/fl atness threshold  functions in a similar way – when the illusion of depth is invoked, a two-dimen- sional shape enters the frame and ‘fl attens’ the screen. Fred Camper suggests that  sometimes Breer’s fi lms seem almost like toys that never quite succeed, contrap- tions that never quite ‘get going’, model planes that crash after only the briefest  of fl ights. But it’s never one ‘crash’: the ecstatic nature of his work is that his  fi lms are taking fl ight and ‘crashing’ at every instant of their unreeling, and the  ‘crashes’ are experienced as being every bit as pleasurable, just as cinematically  rich, as much a part of the fi lms’ unity-in-disunity fabrics as the ‘fl ights’ (Camper  1997).

Instead, the goal was to look at this characterization in close detail  and see how he creates the effects he evokes by schematizing them. All of this  was considered in light of existing research on perception so that his work may  be understood in the context of perceptual mechanisms that operate beneath  the conscious radar. A ‘pro-visual’ discourse was employed, discussing visual ef- fects while drawing from research on visual perception, and Wees’ discussion of  the camera-eye dialectic was extended by considering the ways in which Breer  reveals some of the similarities and disparities between cinematic and everyday  modes of visual experience. It was also demonstrated how Breer’s fi lms call upon the audience to attend vi- sually to the cinematic screen in an unusual way. Core perceptual capacities such  as motion and depth perception are challenged – Breer uses fi lm to challenge  these core capacities. An attempt was made to elucidate what occurs onscreen so  that the viewer might ‘see’ more of what they are looking at more clearly. In closing, other aspects of Breer’s aesthetic that may reward further consider- ation within a cognitive context will be outlined. Breer, characteristically for an  artist in the avant-garde, stated that visual expression ought to be allowed free  reign, and ‘not tied to some organization imposed on it coming from extra-visual  areas such as narration’ (Breer, quoted in Moore 1980: 11). For him, cinema is  fundamentally a visual medium, and a narrative can be detrimental to the visual  experience. He commented: One thing about narration is its effect on the fi gure-ground relationship. One com- mon form of narration is to have a surrogate self on the screen that people can iden- tify with. In cartooning it’s a cartoon fi gure. Grotesque as he or she might be, the  fi gure becomes an identity you follow. If that fi gure is anthropomorphic or animal,  it has a face, and that face will dominate, the way an active ingredient in a passive  landscape dominates the fi eld. It sets up a constant visual hierarchy that to me is  impoverished. I want every square inch of the screen potentially active, alive –  the whole damned screen. I don’t want any one thing to take over. The problem  with narration is that the fi gures always dominate the ground. (Breer, quoted in  MacDonald 1992: 22) There are other recurring elements to Breer’s aesthetic that would reward fur- ther consideration. For example, he had an ongoing interest in metamorphosis,  and would rapidly intercut between photo realistic imagery and cartoonish pic- tures (e.g. a real life dog and Felix the Cat in Rubber Cement). He also took an  interest in sounds and images, and their corresponding words – Bang! opens with  a banging sound over a black screen, followed by the word ‘Bang!’ over a silent  soundtrack. Also notable about Breer’s work is that ‘little cadenzas’ (Moore 1980:  This open access library edition is supported by Knowledge Unlatched.

These are  typically macabre and comical. In the climax to Swiss Army Knife with Rats and  Pigeons, a cartoon rat encounters a rat trap. Before realizing that it is a trap, he  reads the word ‘rat’ and does a celebration dance. He then realizes that he has  stepped into a trap and is killed. Parodying Mondrian’s transcendental creative  aspirations, the rat ascends to heaven via an upwards-moving Mondrian painting  (Figure 4.63). Elena Pinto Simon comments that his work ‘abounds in anecdotes and small  stories that erupt, dance brilliantly and briefl y before our eyes, and disappear  only to evolve into another brief narrative passage’ (Simon 1979: 185). Breer  acknowledges that he includes objects in his fi lms that would belong in a story,  but he refrains from providing one. Of T.Z., he comments: I thought the material could support a story, I didn’t think of a story supporting the  material, because that would be against all my principles. Just when you think there  is a story building, it gets sabotaged. I acknowledge an expectancy on the part of an  audience looking at something . . . they would expect to have . . . a story, it’s inevi- table if there are fi gurative elements . . . I’m much more interested in not excusing  the non-sequitur. The burden is on the viewer, let them fi gure it out. (Breer, quoted  in Moore 1980: 10) While fully realized stories are absent from his work, themes still arise in Breer’s  fi lms. Thematic, ‘extra-visual’ elements feature without distracting from the vi- sual experience. T.Z. is a portrait of his living space near Tappan Zee bridge,  in New York’s Hudson River valley. Camper interprets Swiss Army Knife as ‘a  metaphorical exploration of the work of an artist, seen as a knife which, through  Fig. 4.63 Fig. 4.64 Figures 4.63–4.64.

Bang! is an evocation of boy- hood recalled through fl ashes of memory – sport, Tarzan, toy aeroplanes, images  of World War II and a burgeoning interest in women. What Goes Up? can be  understood as a ‘testament’ fi lm, a portrait ‘of an artist who, desperately trying to  touch the world, realizes he can do so only through his art’ (Camper 1997). What  Goes Up? was made in the ‘autumn’ of his career, and so autumnal trees feature  heavily, including an abstraction of falling leaves. The word ‘fall’ also becomes  a pun, doubling up as a reference to autumn, but also the fall at the end of one’s  career, and the disastrous fall of a train that ‘falls’ to the ground (Figure 4.64). An  elegiac atmosphere is evoked, then, without compromising the visual dynamism  of the fi lm. The fi nal image in What Goes Up? is a still photograph of Breer lifting  a glass to say goodbye.
