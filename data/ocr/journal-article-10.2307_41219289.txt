<plain_text><page sequence="1">81 ASPECTS OF LATE IRON AGE ARCHAEOLOGY IN OMAN: THE SAMAD-CIVILIZATION Gerd Weisgerber In 1976 Miss de Cardi published material from Ras el-Khaimah which partly remained rather unexplained. The sherds had been collected on shell middens (de Cardi 1976), but only one part became well known to all of us working in this area (de Cardi 1976: fig. 4). The orange-red handmade ware, painted with red- brown - sometimes purple- decorations suddenly appeared during the first half of the first millennium B.C. everywhere both in the inland and at the coast. The most prominent sites are Rumeihla (Lombard 1979) in UAE where the French Mission is working, the upper-most layer of the so-called Tell Seeb in Oman and the hillfort of Lizq near Maysar near the road between Samad El-Shan and Mudeybi. The Lizq fortress seems to have been in use only for a short time because the pottery material is clearly uniform (Kroll, s. in Weisgerber 1981). There is so far no development visible and we suggest adopting the name of this site to characterize this widespread archaeological material, this civilization and the chronological period. Identical pottery had once been found in Bahrain and dated (to the Assyrian period,) about 750/650 B.C. There is new evidence that during this civilization the fai aj- system was introduced to Oman (Weisgerber 1981). But all this is not the subject of this lecture. What we are talking about are those embarrassing potsherds from Shimal (de Cardi 1976: 2,3) which were totally absent in Lizq and which are apparently unreported from elsewhere. They were not at all to be explained in terms of chronology or of civilization or culture. It was not until 1980 that A. Haupt- mann the metallurgist and mineralogist of the Bochum team discovered a site with identical pottery in the Maysar- val ley. We call it Maysar-34. Again the site is a fortress and again there emerged only one kind of pottery. Not one single sherd of the Lizq- type has been found there. During the last season the accompanying settlement of these people was discovered and last year digging of their graves was started at Maysar-9. The mudbrick houses at Maysar-43 were once situated along the falaj and only low mounds remained. Some of them were built on ruins of Lizq-houses so that on top of some mounds of the settlement, in contrast to the fortress Maysar-34, occasional different potsherds occur, but mostly it is only the type in question here. No house has been excavated so that we don't know any details of these dwellings except the fact that the settlement depended on the water from the falaj system and apparently continued to use the water facilities of their predecessors of the Lizq period. No fresh water had once been available in the fortress Maysar-34 and probably the fact of storing the water in vessels resulted in the big amount of pottery fragments on the hillsides. 300 m northeast of the village of Al- Maysar a 30 m high rocky hill borders a main branch of the Wadi Samad. The 30 m high hill is surrounded by two walls just 4 m below the summit. Theoutsidewall forms roughly a circle of about 35 m diameter, the inner one is about 32 m in</page><page sequence="2">82 diameter. Both walls are connected by short walls. This system of casemates is very common among fortification systems in general, but in Oman it was registered for the first time. The burial ground of the Maysar-43 people is situated in the North of the settlement on a low terrace. No excavation there took place. But the very large necropolis Maysar-9 of the (until now unknown) Samad al-Shan settle- ment was studied. Most of them apparently belong to the civilization in question one would like to suppose even if only a very few of a total of more than 2500 burials were excavated. (Detailed results will be presented in the next lecture by Burkhard Vogt.) The burial cists are dug in the ground, the dead are laid in a contracted position, and men and women are facing in different directions. No continuous tradition between these burial customs and those of the periods before can be registered which is really an important statement. Besides the specific pottery, iron occurs in swords, daggers and arrowheads. From the ethnological and demographical point of view the population totally differs from those known from the 3rd millennium and is similar to the Oman's population of today. Following this very brief outline of the settlement pattern, the system of fortification and the kind of burials, we should take a closer look at the materials marking this civilization. The pottery of settlements and graves seems to differ in the types of pots but is closely connected in style and details of decoration. In the graves occur predominantly jars, mostly with trefoiled spouts, big storage vessels and ponderous bottles, whereas flat bowls and amphora-like jars are more characteristic for settlement pottery. The ware is coarsely grit- tempered, never of fine paste and always handmade without a potters wheel. The colour differs from yellow to red or dark brown, but yellow, yellowish-rose or rose colours are typical for settlement ware whereas the grave pottery often is more darkish brown (fig. 5-10). Most of the ware is decorated by incisions, never by painting. The canon of patterns seems to be rather narrowly defined. Incised wavy lines in one, two or three zones are predominant, especially on necks or bodies of big jars or pitchers, the handles of which bear a kind of fish-bone incisions or stamped round circles. Fragments show more singular patterns of scratches probably belonging to pictographs as is obvious in an anthropomorph stick figure. Small vertical knob handles or knobs are also surrounded by incisions. From the top of a house mound comes the fragment of a heavy soft stone vessel. This clearly was turned on a lathe. The raw material is much darker than the light grey chlorite which is so typical for the Lizq period. Surface finds on the graveyard Maysar-9 produced some more fragments of turned stone vessels but their correlation with the material described here is not certain. The only metal find from the fortress is a small bronze arrow-head with markings. The graves yielded a lot of iron arrow-heads, iron daggers or swords and bronze clasps. There is not yet much evidence for the discussion of a chronological order. Some of the pottery was found in the Hellenistic E-Door on the Truci al coast (Boucharlat/Salles 1981: fig. 9). This date of 3rd/2nd century B.C. can be proven. Exactuaralelsto the iron arrowheads shown come from the Hellenistic fortress at Failaka, dated by coins to around 200 B.C. (Morkholm 1960). The iron arrowheads there were recently collected on the surface of the excavation dumps and are shown in the Failaka Museum (fig. 11). Of course more evidence is needed but presumably the centuries roughly following 250 B.C. can be accepted. To avoid the transfer of terms like "Hellenistic" to an outside area, and having demon- strated that this material is specific in all aspects which archaeologists normally use to define civilizations or cultures, and that this material obvi- ously covers a more or less closed period I am encouraged to suggest for this complex the names Samad culture and Samad time in order to have terms to work with. But that is not all , and I would like to come to the key point of these discoveries. We probably know who these Samad-people were:</page><page sequence="3">83 According to an old historical tradition the Arab population of Oman came as invaders to the country (Wilkinson 1977: 122 pp). Bottles from two graves at Maysar-9 and a single one from a contemporary grave at Batin bear Arabic letters or inscriptions. They were all incised before the vessels were burned. These signs prove the knowledge of writing in the South-Arabian manner by Samad people. These are the first South-Arabian letters from middle Oman and they are older than the inscriptions of Khor Rori (Pi renne 1978, Bees ton 1976). We presume that the Samad people belong to the first Arabian population in Oman. We therefore summarize the evidence for their immigration (based only on the Maysar/Samad results): 1. The material culture (Samad civilization) seems to occur suddenly, at least the pottery emerges without local tradition. 2. The burial customs cannot be derived from former ones, they are new. 3. From the anthropological point of view the population is different from former ones. 4. It seems that the people needed a fortress for temporary use. This happens usually with immigrants (1). 5. The people wrote Arabic, NOTES 1 See e.g. the "motte" of theNormansonthe island of Britain or the fortress Palaiokastro-Maa of the Achaeans on the island of Cyprus. REFERENCES 1 Beeston, A.F.L. 1976.
