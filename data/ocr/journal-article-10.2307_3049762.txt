<plain_text><page sequence="1">CHARLES DE TOLNAY, Disegni di Michelangelo nelle collezioni italiani, Florence, Centro Di, 1975. Pp. 132; 257 figs. L. 5500 Of the three exhibitions of Michelangelo's drawings held in 1975 to commemorate the quincentenary of his birth, the largest was that mounted in his native city by the doyen of Michelangelo scholars, Charles de Tolnay. It contained virtually all the authentic sheets in Italian collections, a large number of disputed drawings, and a selection of the more interesting copies. The bound documents from the Archivio Buonarroti, which contain many sketches, were represented by the 13th volume of letters, rich in drawings. Of the sadly few sheets in non-Florentine collections, the splendid head of the Cumaean Sibyl from Turin was shown, a magnificently vigorous black-chalk drawing touched with white lead, the most brutal version of the Fall of Phaeton from Venice, and the recently discovered red-chalk head studies from the Gabinetto Nazionale. Unfortunately, the Venice Madonna was considered too fragile to make the trip, as was, inevitably, the great cartoon fragment from Capodimonte; both, however, were discussed in the catalogue, the former illustrated both recto and verso. With almost 260 illustrations devoted to 200 sheets, the catalogue forms, at an amazingly low price, a valuable anthology of the drawings in Italy by Michelangelo or associable with him. The exhibition was divided: the sheets from the Uffizi were displayed there alongside the Doni Tondo; those from the Casa Buonarroti, with its incomparable ensemble of early sculpture and architectural and sculptural models, were arranged on two floors of the house in half a dozen rooms, beautifully spaced, with a poet's eye for the telling juxtaposition. For a moment Michelangelo was, if not precisely reinserted into the 16th century, placed in a setting that was informal, intimate, and Florentine. The encapsulated world of the strongbox showcase, of unnatural lighting, air-conditioning, and security guards could be temporarily forgotten. The drawings were arranged to bring out their interrelations and displayed with a lack of pretentiousness that made their function and meaning all the more accessible. Yet, unfortunately, the exhibition attracted little attention outside Italy. Perhaps in November and December even Florence seemed uninviting, or perhaps in Paola Barocchi's comprehensive catalogue of the Uffizi and Casa Buonarroti collections everything seemed to have been said. But of the three exhibitions this was the most revelatory, providing the opportunity to compare many drawings of the greatest beauty and importance whose status has never been fully elucidated. Exhibitions, however excellent, pass; catalogues remain and this one, apparently simple but in reality highly complex, is exceptionally valuable. The entries are succinct and clear, the stance is neutral: Tolnay never writes de haut en bas, and he makes no attempt to draw the veil of authority over the face of opinion. The resonances are multiple. In the first place, the catalogue is a commentary on the author's earlier work, of which it offers a radical reappraisal. After a phase of restrictive connoisseurship, according to the introduction a necessary stage in the definition of Michelangelo's drawing styles, has come the "desiderio di arrichire di sfumature l'immagine di Michelangelo disegnatore," leading to the revaluation of a considerable number of drawings, a trajectory that parallels, but does not repeat, that of Johannes Wilde. Tolnay's work contains a subsidiary commentary, on Barocchi's catalogue, whose conclusions are in many cases amplified, disputed, or corrected. It acts also as a forum for the discussion of recent scholarship, providing a preview of judgments on attribution, chronology, and purpose that we can expect to see developed in future volumes of the Corpus, and, in one case at least (No. 25/CB.52F r), it contains even a slight modification of a view expressed in the first volume, which was published to coincide with the exhibition. As for the exhibition, Tolnay chose drawings that he did not necessarily accept but whose status he wished to test, so the catalogue aims not at the definitive but at the suggestive. Like the exhibition, the catalogue makes space: it uncovers an exciting prospect of uncertainties and possibilities; it represents work in progress in which we are invited to share. It is in this spirit that I wish to discuss a few points here. The majority of revaluations of figurative drawings seem to me entirely convincing. The splendid leg studies in soft black chalk for the ignudo on the right above the Delphic Sibyl and that on the right above Isaiah, No. 25/CB.52F r, which have been fairly generally rejected, are given back to Michelangelo, with attention drawn to the "magistrale finezza" of the chiaroscuro. (One unfortunate conse- quence of the Uffizi/Casa Buonarroti division was that the former's partial copy of this sheet, Uffizi 18535F, could not be shown beside it to bring out its quality.) Similarly a drawing of a different type, the red-chalk sketch for the reading figure in the right background of the Crucifixion of Haman, No. 29/CB,12F r, is also restored to Michelangelo. It is broad and simple, a study of the basic volumes and the fall of light, because breadth and simplicity were precisely the qualities that Michelangelo required for the finished figure which is still further simplified; it was not to distract from the commanding gesture of Ashuerus. A black-chalk and pen study for a standing female figure, No. 2/CB.39F r, is also brought back into the fold. Its purpose is uncertain but it may have been an idea for one of the ancestors of Christ in the Sistine lunettes, which was not finally used, since there is, I think, a faint are on the right of the sheet, which would correspond to the window embrasure. In pen work it is very close to the British Museum's pen study for the Erythraean Sibyl (W. O10r), as Wilde pointed out. Particularly fascinating is the sheet of</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 175 1 Michelangelo, design for a window (here identified as for the interior of the drum of St. Peter's), ca. 1558-1560. Florence, Casa Buonarroti, CB.124A v and CB.103A v (photomontage John Heesom) 2 Michelangelo, partial ground plan for S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini and design for a wall tomb. Casa Buonarroti, CB.103A r (photo: Gabinetto Fotografico) black-chalk studies for Adam in the Expulsion, No. 19/CB.64F r (also partially copied in Uffizi 18535F). This, like the leg studies mentioned above (No. 25), has often been rejected, perhaps because the main figure, on the center right, is on the one hand too close to that in the fresco to be obviously an early sketch, but on the other is much less fully modeled than the elaborate and undeniably authentic red-chalk drawings (like the British Museum's Haman) which must shortly precede the cartoon. Tolnay reinstates the drawing with a brief reference to the characteristic treatment of the head. One can only wish that he had not been restrained by the cool formula of the catalogue because this, surely, is a drawing that demands enthusiasm. After the compara- tively unsuccessful first trio of narrative frescoes, Michelangelo was faced with the problem of enlarging and simplifying his forms and he began to place less stress on detailed internal modeling and strong continuous contour. He started to play the fullness and lightness of the central areas of the body against shadowed and relatively imprecise contours, so that the form would stand out massively against the high-key and drastically simplified background. In No. 19 Michelangelo has investigated this style, though the contours are still slightly too sharp. Adam turns away with a movement of fear and guilt, the enormous forearm, dramatically enlarged, carrying great expressive emphasis as its thrust seems to propel him forward. But this movement was too dramatic, too instantaneous. It forced too powerful a curve down the left side of the body and turned it too much into depth. The movement gave the figure simultaneously too much physical vitality and too much pattern. Michelangelo needed to turn Adam as flatly as possible into the picture plane in order that his figure would read clearly from the chapel's floor; he sought to create a kinetic equivalent rather than a dramatic rendering of the meaning of the Expulsion. So the figure was straightened, the gesture made less energetic, the movement slowed. The degraded Adam's awkward gait, as the point of the angel's sword almost jabs into his neck, actualizes his sickened awareness of the loss of Paradise. The Expulsion was not to be rendered with a movement of physical power and virility; it was made consciously awkward, consciously ugly. The drawing shows that Michelangelo's esthetic encompassed the sacrifice of plastic beauty as well as its creation. It also offers support for the view that Michelangelo did not approach the ceiling with images fixed and ready for transfer. He had to fight his way along it, questioning and criticizing, modifying his approach from area to area to satisfy the demands of legibility and expression. There are a number of other revaluations in the figure drawings but the point is clear: Tolnay has been prepared to consider the drawings afresh and with eye-opening effect. There are also several carefully considered redatings that will provoke much thought and discussion: e.g., Nos.1/CB.36F, 32/CB.70F, 33/CB.54F, 46/Uffizi 18721E Perhaps the most spectacular is the placing of No.5/CB.48F r next to No. 4/CB.23F r, and the sugestion that the former, always connected with the Medici Chapel figures, was in reality a study for the Virgin of the Doni Tondo. The observation was certainly striking but finally, in my view, the traditional date of No.5 seemed more convincing and its handling closer to Nos.61/CB.11F r and 64/CB.10F r. The pen strokes in No.4 (for the Christ Child in the Doni Tondo) round the form and contain the bones and muscles smoothly in the elastic envelope of the flesh. By contrast, in No.5 the pen strokes are choppy, short, and inelegant, changing direction and overlapping to bring out the structure of the thigh and knee. They are entirely at the service of the plastic form, which seems modeled from within; smooth continuity of surface is now a secondary consideration. Like the collections of the Uffizi and the Casa Buonarroti, the catalogue is organized into figurative and architectural sections, and in the latter we have a foretaste of the long-awaited sixth volume of Tolnay's monograph on Michelangelo, which is to deal with the architecture. There was one very important discovery made by the author, a slight sketch for the fagade of S. Lorenzo, on No. 123/CB.41A v, which had previously remained entirely unnoticed. By the time of the exhibition the discovery had been published but even so, it was overly self-effacing to exhibit the better-known recto. Annoyingly, the whole verso is illustrated in the catalogue, so that</page><page sequence="3">176 THE ART BULLETIN the small sketch is barely visible; it deserved a detail to itself. Among the major revaluations in the architectural section is that of the large, partially finished modello for the S. Lorenzo faqade, No.124/CB.45A. Here, especially in the figure drawing, one can see the technique of the contemporary (?) altar design at Christ Church (Byam-Shaw No.64r), which, though on a smaller scale, also contains statuary and relief sculpture. Unlike that drawing, however, No. 124 possesses elaborate underdrawing in black chalk, which includes elements never inked over: a faintly outlined central door with, I think, a triangular pediment and, more significantly, a figure in the round-headed niche immediately left of center. The figures are elongated, the gestures of the participants in the relief scenes exaggerated. The drawing was intended to convey the readability and relative scales of the forms (as with the Julius Tomb, Michelangelo intended to enlarge the figures on the upper stories); it was not meant to describe exhaustively every aspect of the final design. Characteris- tic of drawings of this type, the untouchables of Michelangelo scholarship, the niches are not shown to their proper depth, nor are the figures convincingly three-dimensional. Michelangelo's first concern was for overall plasticity, and the figures are subordinated to the grid of the architecture. It is as if he knew that his sculpture would grow in vitality and would gradually draw off the energies of the structure. Figures that he carved always took on their own life, and the inventiveness of his architectural forms was never so great as when statuary was absent; in the absence of sculpture the anthropomorphic thrust of his architectural imagination was less inhibited. In the discussion of this sheet Tolnay raises the question of the ruled framework, which, he suggests, may have been done by a collaborator, perhaps Baccio d'Agnolo. Personally I believe that the whole of this sheet is by Michelangelo himself, though certainly the idea of a collaboration at this particular moment is not at all implausible. But the observation raises a more general issue. It is something of a hangover from late Romantic ideas of Michelangelo as an untamable force of nature, a volcanic genius, that so many students (though not Tolnay) have been reluctant to believe that Michelangelo ever used a ruler, at least before his hand began to tremble with age. Ruled lines present an obvious problem in connoisseurship; we might wish to maintain that one ruled line looks more "Michelangelesque" than another, but it would be extremely difficult to articulate this precisely; a Morelli of the straightedge has not yet appeared. In the event, we are forced to employ our common sense. Complicated projects require elaborate finished drawings, the more so as the design approaches preliminary realization in a plastic model and actual realization in marble, which has to be cut to size; they cannot be drawn in the lively freehand of the broadly experimental phases. Unless one wishes to deny that Michelangelo ever did precise finished drawings for architectural and sculptural projects (which would be flying in the face of a considerable body of graphic evidence and the practice of his contemporaries), then it is hypercritical to balk at ruled lines. The prevalent rejection of many ruled drawings may be the consequence of an inappropriate esthetic of the spontaneous usurping the role of a broad-based functional analysis, an analysis in which the determinates of the project, the place the drawing can be assigned in a sequence, the qualities of the solution it represents, and the creativity, both esthetic and technical, that it exhibits should all play a part. It may at first sight seem a peripheral matter whether in a particular architectural study the framework was ruled by Michelangelo or by a pupil, but in fact it is important that a body of precise architectural designs should be accepted, since to deny them is to excise Michelangelo from the historical, the rational, and the practical and to place him in an ethereal realm of pure architectural idealism. To deny them is also to deprive oneself of some of the most beautiful of all architectural drawings. The ruled lines in an architectural drawing are not somehow extraneous to its essence: the fundamental qualities of many designs reside precisely in the spacing of their elements, in the proportions and relations of cornices, stringcourses, moldings, bases, pediments, etc. This preeminently is sculptural work and only precise ruled lines, plus a subsequent application of wash, can give an exact picture of the reciprocal rhythms of individual elements on which the effect of the whole will depend. For example, Tolnay's upgrading of a design for a door, No.152/ CB.96A r, is tentative, but it seems to me impossible that every element in this magnificent drawing (the verso of which is undisputed) should not be by Michelangelo himself. The ruling of the frame is of the utmost delicacy, with the spacing from level to level achieved with the greatest subtlety and care; indeed in the precision of the ruling lies the beauty of the frame. Close examination of the ruled structure also provides material evidence for the creativity of the drawing: there is a major pentimento in the positioning of the segmental pediment which was first drawn considerably lower. All this is apart from the luxurious, even voluptuous play of the wash on the forms, wash which varies in touch and texture from point to point, with gradual transitions from the deep shadow on the left side of the pediment to the lighter tones on the right and with delicate internal reflections within the shadow. The drawing lyrically and logically conjures the forms to life in volume and relief, in a summer light. The next drawing, No. 153/CB.111A, rather badly foxed, is less immediately attractive, though no less sensitive when examined closely. In favor of its status as a carefully constructed working modello for the door on the reading-room side of the Laurentian Library's entrance, which Michelangelo is scarcely likely to have allowed another to draw (it must follow closely upon W.37r in the British Museum), are the signs of a considerable amount of compass work and, in the lower right-hand corner, a braccia scale (cropped in most reproductions but visible in that in the catalogue) that helps to confirm the identification. Although in my opinion the revaluation of architectural drawings could have gone further, Tolnay has made a contribution of fundamental importance in wresting so many from unjustified neglect and ambiguous appraisal. Perhaps I may close with a chance observation of my own, punctiliously credited in the catalogue. Two drawings, Nos. 186v/CB.124A v and 143v/CB.103A v, always catalogued separately (the latter, indeed, usually denied to Michelangelo) are in fact halves of the same design (Fig. 1); this adds an attractive tabernacle frame to Michelangelo's late oeuvre. Palimpsest drawings of this type are never very easy to decipher and here not all the forms are finally fixed, but overall the design compares very well with the interior drum windows of the Vatican's large wooden model of 1558-1561 for the drum and dome of St. Peter's. This connection seems to be clinched when we note that at the bottom of the drawing the outer molding is separated by a wide space from the inner one, just as in the model and as executed. The study on the top half of the recto, No.186r/CB.124A r), is of course the most developed ground plan that we have by Michelangelo's own hand for S. Giovanni dei Fiorentini, which adorns the catalogue cover and the exhibition's poster, the loveliest perhaps of all his architectural drawings. On the recto of the lower half, No.143r/CB.103A r (Fig. 2), there are some faint and partial ground-plan sketches that, as Tolnay points out, are surely for S. Giovanni too. There is in addition a larger ruled tomb design that, he interestingly suggests, may also be a project for this church; he does not accept it as autograph, however, but suggests that it may be by Calcagni. To me it looks like an old man's drawing; in its combination of ruled lines, careful but slightly clumsy freehand for the volutes and shell and the small candelabra on the lower left of the frame (little drawings of candelabra can also be found by the pediment on Fig. 1), together with the wavering long parallel hatching lines on the sarcophagus, it seems to me characteristic of a definable type in Michelangelo's late graphic work. Similar hatching, for example, can be found on some of the late Crucifixion drawings, the underdrawing of No. 195r/CB.106A r for the Porta Pia, the unprepossessing fragmentary portal design No.196/CB.108A r (also, I think, by Michelangelo), and the study for a window, No. 151/CB.65A r, which Tolnay upgrades, but, following Barocchi, maintains at its traditional date of the mid-1520's, rather than what I would take to be its correct date of around the mid-1550's. (Perhaps, following an observation made in the catalogue, the last is a design for the upper story of the Palazzo Farnese courtyard.) At any rate Fig. 2 is a drawing</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 177 that requires further discussion. That the impulse for this has come from Tolnay is a further testimony to the way in which this stimulating catalogue has allowed air to circulate in chambers that might have seemed sealed.
