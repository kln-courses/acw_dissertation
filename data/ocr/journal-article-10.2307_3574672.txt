Res. 71, 269-283 (1977). Critical Human Organ Radiation Dosimetry (CHORD) probability density functions for A-P (anterior-posterior), P-A (posterior-anterior), bilateral, rotational, and iso- tropic radiation environments serve as insult-attenuation operators for cell-survival models based on target theory or the prediction of primary lesions according to the dual theory of radiation action. CHORD distributions plus simple depth-dose data also permit the rapid estimation of the insult profile and the mean insult to the active bone- marrow system of a mathematical analog of the ICRP Reference Man. The CHORD concept follows the variations in the microscopic processes of absorption, attenuation, and scattering on a macroscopic level so that it is not necessary to attempt detailed original calculations for each and every case of interest. Similar techniques have been applied to reactor-criticality calculations and the general logic of the CHORD process can be applied to any cause-response type situation which can be described in terms of variation with distance in the medium of interest. Doses to active bone marrow from exposures to photons and neutrons are presented and excellent agreement is shown with the available experimental results. INTRODUCTION TO THE CHORD CONCEPT When an organism is subjected to a radiation environment, a critical organ or region of greatest risk usually is irradiated nonuniformly if the linear dimensions of the critical organ are not small2 or the depth of the critical organ within the organism is not large1 compared with the mean-free path of the irradiating particles. Radiation-insult specific analyses are usually based on dose to cells, a small target site or cluster of cells within an organ such as the mandible, or a center such as the central nervous, or active bone-marrow system. For some effects, cells or sensitive sites within cells may not be irradiated uniformly be- 1 Research sponsored by the U.S. Energy Research and Development Administration under contract with Union Carbide Corporation. 2 The combination of insult specification, penetration depth, and the size of the critical organ influences the degree of nonuniform irradiation of an organ. Because the mutual ranges of these variables cannot be defined precisely, except for a specified irradiation, it is difficult to quantify more precisely than "not small" and "not large." 269 Copyright O 1977 by Academic Press, Inc.

On a more macroscopic scale, chronic effects such as bone sarcomas or even leukemia may, in some cases, be directly related to highly localized ex- posures such as are usually encountered in radiotherapy of tumors where the maximum absorbed dose at a particular site may be more meaningful than the mean absorbed dose to the complete active-marrow system (2).3 Detailed distri- butions of photon dose to specific active-marrow regions for A-P, P-A, rotational, and side (lateral) incidence have been published and could be readily applied to many situations of interest (3-5). For radiation protection and risk analyses from acute effects and those chronic effects where risk is thought to be propor- tional to the insult to the system such as is usually assumed for leukemia, it is often not possible or desirable to establish response versus insult-type correlations on a microscopic level. Therefore, it becomes necessary to assign a mean insult or risk to a nonuniformly irradiated critical organ. A radiation insult to the human body is a phenomenon that cannot be calcu- lated or measured directly. It is possible to simulate such a process in experi- mental and calculational analogs. The basic transport processes are often used in straightforward calculational simulations; however, adjoint methods are be- coming more widely used because of the increased computational efficiency of tracing rays from the detector to the source according to the simple equality (statistical wt X Pr of occurrence)unbiased = (statistical wt X Pr of occurrence)biased, which can serve as the basis of many adjoint methods. All of this simply means that all transport calculations are either forward or backward indirect simulations of actual events. If it is possible to establish insult versus depth curves4 for a human analog and a source field of interest, then it is possible to estimate the exposure to the active bone marrow by the use of a distribution function of penetration length. If a point is chosen randomly and uniformly within the active bone marrow, then the dose at this point may be estimated from the D(1) curve. The D(1) function describes the insult profile as a function of the penetration length 1. The method of CHORDS (a simple adjoint technique) depends completely upon establishing a response or insult versus distance correlation. Usually, any specific CHORD or p {1}dl probability distribution is obtained by assuming that the critical organ is simply a volume of constant density, and for each differential unit of mass dmn, chosen by Monte Carlo techniques, the minimum distance 1 to the closest irradiated air-tissue interface along a surface- normal vector (or in some cases, along the path of the incident radiation) is 3 A. R. Jones, personal communication to T. D. Jones, July 30, 1975. 4 M. P. Billings and R. W. Langley [Health Phys. 27, 581-588 (1974)] obtained distributions of penetration lengths for isotropic exposure to space protons. Their distributions were obtained by selecting volumes of detection within the bone marrow and then computing interception lengths over all solid angle. This approach was sufficient for heavy charged particles; however, the tech- nique must be generalized in order to operate on insults described by the transport process which are influenced by straggling in direction and energy.</page><page sequence="3">INSULT ASSESSMENT TO BONE MARROW 271 fORGANISM *dm .=J DETECTOR IONIZING RADIATION o e10 L INSULT PROFILE = D (f) DISTRIBUTION OFA P A D E T PD IST i N ii i~iiii i !iiiiiiiiii!iiiiiii!!iiii: iii: i ? : o - -Jo 11 PENETRATION DISTANCE PENETRATION DISTANCE Li=f00(i p{J}d fp~}.d FIG. 1.

The selection of I along the surface normal or along the path of the uncollided insult must correspond with the regression of insult on distance [i.e., I in p {1}dl and D(1) must be equivalent although not necessarily uniquely defined]. This process is continued until p {1} dl is well known statistically. The p { l} dl depends upon the angular properties of the insulting environment and the marrow distribution within the analog. Since this technique is a tool of simu- lation, its specific application must be adjusted to the type of insult versus distance relationship available.5 "Chord" usually implies a straight line through two points on the surface, e.g., the skin; however, in this application CHORD is an acronym or mathematical transliteration derived from Critical Human Organ Radiation Dosimetry and represents only a specific portion of a "true chord." The CHORD concept is illustrated in Fig. 1 and the CHORD or p {l}dl distribution provides operational factors, in the detection site, for an integration over a specific insult such as a multicollision depth-dose curve for the source geometry of interest. CHORD APPLICATIONS TO RED BONE MARROW Figure 2 illustrates the distribution of the active (red) bone marrow in the normal adult and the corresponding analog (6) for our Monte Carlo transport code. In the adult Reference Man (7) there are 1500 g of active red marrow and 1500 g of yellow marrow which are predominantly fat cells. Inactive yellow marrow may be transformed quickly into active marrow by a stimulus such as bleeding or infection; yellow marrow in bone shafts is known to contain some active cells but, in general, the proportion of active cells in adult yellow marrow P {ldl distributions in this paper have been computed for the depth-dose data to which they are applied, i.e., I is not defined in the same manner for all exposure situations.</page><page sequence="4">272 T.

Thus, for most situations of interest, only the red marrow receives major consideration. Although the distribution of yellow marrow is different from red marrow, the respective insult levels are equivalent for practical application. The importance of a risk estimate based on radiation damage to the active- marrow system cannot be overstated as bone-marrow damage usually is the major mechanism in radiation death or acute radiation sickness stemming from whole-body irradiation because it occurs at much lower levels (9, 10) than death or incapacitation due to radiation damage of the gut mucosa or the central nervous system. For sublethal criticality-accident exposure levels, levels of interest in radiation protection, and population-exposure levels, the most demand- ing recommendations of the ICRP (11) relate to the maximum-permissible doses to the gonads and the blood-forming organs. In radiation protection, the testicles are usually considered to be the critical organ of primary interest because of their shallow location and because of the difficulty of estimating the bone-marrow insult; however, if the exposure level subjects an individual to considerable risk or the individual is reproductively inactive, then an estimation of the insult to his active-marrow system could be more meaningful (10). The dose at a penetration depth of 4-5 cm (1l) is often chosen to describe the insult to the red bone marrow; however, for photon irradiation the "5-cm rule" can be in error by a factor of 2 or more and is expected to be less accurate for neutron irradiation because irradiating particles may have shorter mean inter- action distances. This approximation tends to retain popularity in spite of its inaccuracy, because the red marrow is distributed widely in the skeleton. The skeletal distribution shown in Fig. 2 illustrates the fact that, in general, no specific depth can be applied for different exposure geometries and different irradiating particles or even different energies of the same type particle. For internal dosimetry, especially for radionuclides deposited in or near the skeleton, a precise calculational analog of the active-marrow system requires some postulations about cavity-size variation and the distribution of these marrow</page><page sequence="5">INSULT ASSESSMENT TO BONE MARROW 273 cavities within the skeleton. However, for most situations of external exposure, the active marrow may be assumed to be uniformly deposited in certain regions of the skeleton. This simplification is possible because for external exposure, distance versus insult (dose) variation is much less than for internal radionuclide deposition where the insult (dose) usually varies more rapidly than the inverse square of the distance. There are two opposing effects that also influence the photon absorbed dose to marrow. These effects are the increased shielding by the bone structure and the enhancement of dose near the higher-atomic-number bone tissue (8, 2). As demonstrated later (e.g., Fig. 6), the net influence of these opposing effects is usually negligible (13) for external exposure although such is not always the case for internal emitters.

The peak at 2 cm for rotational and isotropic exposure is due to the shorter penetration distances to the upper-arm bones while the higher and broader peak at about 6 cm is predominantly from the vertebrae and pelvis. The CHORD distributions are influenced strongly by the pelvic region and the thoracic vertebrae which contain about 36 and 28%, respectively, of the total active marrow.

For isotropic exposures, 1 varies to 10 cm because depth-dose data are expected to be related to the minimum distance to the closest irradiated surface from the site of interest, i.e., along the surface-normal vector (expressed as OF OF aF N =--+-j + --- aX OY aZ where F, a function of X, Y, Z, describes the boundaries of the air-phantom interface). Hence I can never exceed the half-value thickness of the torso. For bilateral exposure, the A-P and P-A CHORD distributions were averaged and are used with plane-beam depth-dose data. Averaging takes into account equal intensities of opposing radiation fields and yet does not distort the proper dis- tribution of the marrow within the body as described by the distributions for A-P and P-A exposures. The CHORD distributions from Fig. 3 were used in conjunction with depth- dose curves' according to Dred marrow = D(1) .p({l) Al because all CHORD distributions were normalized to unity.

Experimental results were not available for higher energies. Monte Carlo results, calculated at the time of the cited reference (3) but not published previously, show excellent agreement in the photoelectric region (see Fig. 6) but seem to become increasingly inaccurate in the Compton region. This unexpected characteristic of the Monte Carlo results probably is due to certain approximations about dose contributions to bone or marrow and should be studied in detail. The important practical case of dose to the active marrow from a broad beam incident on a constantly rotating phantom is shown in Fig. 7. Experimental results from Wilson and Carruthers (2), Jones (17), and Facey (9) may have suffered slight disfigurations due to replotting, but all appear to have been normalized to the same ordinate at 250 keV. Much concern has been expressed (9) about whether marrow dose per unit exposure should increase monotonically with energy as noted by Wilson and Carruthers (2) or whether it should peak at about 100 keV as noted by Jones (17). The different shapes have been considered due to energy degradation within the phantom and the fact that the detector systems of Jones (17) and Wilson and Carruthers had energy dependences in opposite directions (9). At this time, it seems more probable that the different shapes are due primarily to the fact that if one considers the shape of the curve describing the ratio of the photon fluence per unit exposure as a function of photon energy (18, 19) then the dose-response curve must have a shape that peaks at about 100 keV because the fluence per unit exposure varies more rapidly with energy than does the absorbed dose to the marrow, and second to the fact that Wilson and Carruthers assumed that 60% of the active marrow received a dose similar to that measured in the thoracic vertebrae and that 40% received a dose similar to that measured in the sternum.8 The CHORD doses are in excellent agreement with Facey's results (9), 8 This method of averaging would tend to underestimate dose at lower energies because as Facey"o points out, the "pelvis dominates dose at higher energies followed by the thoracic vertebrae and sacrum down to 30 keV. There the ribs enter the second place and below 30 keV the ribs dominate." Faceyo10 attempted to resolve the difficulties in the rotational case and his results are shown in Fig. 7.</page><page sequence="10">278 T. D. JONES except for a consistent 12% overestimation. This deviation is attributed to (a) 13.1% of the active marrow is in the skull (see Fig. 2) which Facey did not include, (b) experimental results from Facey appear to have been normalized to other experimental results at 250 keV, (c) experimentally obtained doses to the active-marrow system necessitate the assumption of an "effective-mass center" of each important marrow region (4),9 and (d) the CHORD estimate did not allow for increased attenuation by bone tissue shielding the marrow (13). As seen in Fig. 6, this effect is small above 50 keV. At the low energies, dose to the shallow marrow becomes increasingly important, as is shown by the rapid attenua- tion of dose as a function of depth, and most experimental results are expected to be somewhat low because of the method of averaging. CHORD-dose values were normalized per unit exposure according to the Radiological Health Hand- book (18). In spite of factors a, b, c, and d, excellent agreement for A-P estimates (17)10 and rotational estimates (9) compared with the method of CHORDs is observed. Spiers and Overton (12) measured attenuation factors in an anthropomorphic phantom irradiated by 25 equal sources which "were distributed, five on each wall and on the ceiling of an empty room both in air and in the phantom. The sources were positioned, one in the center and four towards the corners of each area, so that each contributed nearly the same dose-rate to the center of the room and, moreover, the radiation was incident nearly uniform over a solid angle somewhat greater than 3w." They plotted their attenuation factors as a function of depth from the nearest body surface and then computed a weighted mean transmission'1 to the bone marrow for 0.2, 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, and 2.0-MeV photons. Transmission factors for isotropic exposure shown in Fig. 4 were compared to this "nearly omni-directional y radiation." Spiers and Overton's results were consistently higher than those obtained from the method of CHORDs by about 20%. Although the source geometries were different, this was thought to be good agreement and especially encouraging was the fact that CHORD values were lower whereas for the rotational comparison, CHORD values were slightly higher. Calculations of absorbed dose to the bone marrow for isotropic exposure to monoenergetic - rays have been published recently by O'Brien and Sanna (5). Their results compared with Fig. 4 according to: 5 MeV (8%), 2 MeV (4%), 1 MeV (4%), 500 keV (8%), and 200 keV (2%).

Facey commented, "As you can see, there are minor differences of slope, causing our P-A results to fall above yours at 5-10 MeV, and below yours at 1-3 MeV. Our A-P results are consistently higher than yours above 2.5 MeV. This makes the ratio of our P-A/A-P only 1.09 at 13.6 Mev compared with approximately 1.20 for your curves. Otherwise I think the agreement is remarkably good." " Spiers and Overton used the term attenuation factors; however, their paper indicates that they actually worked with transmission factors. One other point of some uncertainty is the exact location of the 25 sources. From their description it seems that each corner of the ceiling contained three sources of equal strength.</page><page sequence="11">INSULT ASSESSMENT TO BONE MARROW 279 TABLE II Dose to Active Marrow from Neutron Produced Recoil Ions as Predicted by CHORD Distributions Energy Free-spacea P-Ab A-P Bilateral Rotational Isotropic kerma 0.025 eV 2.1 2.1 1.2 1.7 1.6 0.70 1 keV 1.0 3.3 2.2 2.5 2.3 1.1 10 keV 10.0 4.1 2.6 3.3 2.8 1.6 100 keV 70.0 12.0 7.4 9.9 9.2 5.4 1 MeV 230.0 110.0 67.0 81.0 75.0 47.0 2.5 MeV 340.0 240.0 180.0 211.0 190.0 84.0 14 MeV 690.0 590.0 520.0 556.0 540.0 330.0 aX 10-s erg/(gram-fluence neutron). b X 10-11 rad/fluence neutron. energetic photons, suggests that if one is concerned only about protection of his bone marrow, he should not do the instinctive thing and turn his back, but instead should face the hazard while backing away. The same effect was also observed by Piesch (20) and holds for the neutron data in Table II. Some of the data in Table II are plotted in Fig. 8 for ease of application. Bilateral and rota- tional results are not shown in Fig. 8 because of their close agreement with the results for A-P exposure. Absorbed dose from neutron-produced recoil ions is usually characterized by the hydrogen atomic density, because 70-90% of the absorbed dose is due to interactions with hydrogen atoms for neutron energies below 14 MeV (14, 21). Muscle tissue contains about the same hydrogen atomic density per unit volume as bone tissue so that attenuation with penetration depth is nearly equal for the two types of biological tissue. Lung tissue has a specific gravity of only about 0.3 and the hydrogen atomic density, therefore, is quite different; however, most critical organs of interest are either distant from the lung tissue or closer to an irradiated surface so that the penetration distance in grams per square centimeter is less than the other portion of the ray that passes 1o3 P-A EXPOSURE A-P EXPOSURE 402 0 P-A, FACEY- DREO 74-47 - o A-P, FACEY-DREO 74-17 .T.404 'o C F-ISOTROPIC EXPOSURE oO -- I i i !

For P-A incidence, Mechali estimated 3.1 X 10-10; Facey and Clifford measured 3.7 X 10-10, and Table III shows 3.17 X 10-10 rad cm2 neutron-'. In Table III, the dose from A-P exposure to autogrammas from 2.5-MeV neutrons is higher than the dose from P-A exposure because as illustrated in NCRP (25), the integrated dose between 0 and 10 cm is less than the integrated dose between 10 and 20 cm. OTHER CHORD APPLICATIONS Dose distributions (26) inside cylindrical phantoms have been computed for the A-bomb produced radiation environments of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. The dose distributions for the spatially dependent neutron environments, varied symmetrically with depth from the air-tissue interface and indicated that multi- collision processes overwhelmed the first-collision processes; thus, the angular dependence of the source field was lost. This, plus the assumption of a 2-?r isotropic , environment, permits the estimation of the mean absorbed dose to the active marrow of an A-bomb survivor inside a typical Japanese house. This summation</page><page sequence="13">INSULT ASSESSMENT TO BONE MARROW 281 indicated that neutron dose to the active marrow relative to tissue kerma in air from neutrons was 0.26; autogamma dose to the active marrow relative to tissue kerma in air from neutrons was 0.07; and - dose to the active marrow relative to tissue kerma in air from y rays was 0.55. Size-dependent Japanese reference-person analogs have been developed and corresponding marrow insults do not vary significantly from these except for children where the insult levels may increase by an amount less than 50%. Spiers and Overton did a spectral weighted average for their monoenergetic "nearly omni-directional - radiation" and estimated that the mean transmission1' factor for fission product y rays was 0.67 which seems consistent with the difference in source geometries. Rossi and Mays12 suggested that leukemia incidence appears to vary linearly with neutron dose; however, leukemia incidence seems to occur as the square of -y dose. Therefore using CHORD factors as dose operators, the root-mean- square y dose was found to be 0.19 of the in-air value and the contribution from neutron-produced autointegral ,s was 0.025 of the in-air kerma from neutrons. Risk analyses based on these data indicate very high biological effectiveness factors for neutrons, relative to y rays. Work in progress, at this laboratory, includes the estimation of the insult profiles, according to various survival models. It seems likely that the insult profile to a significant fraction of the active marrow could reveal more about risk than the some total marrow mean computed over a wide range of insult levels. These profiles and several independent analyses of the risk from neutrons relative to risk from y rays for the A-bomb survivors should be available in the near future. For RF and microwave radiation, Ho and Guy (27) state: The specification of energy flux density alone may not be dosimetrically sufficient for relating results of biological effects experiments to radiation protection. It is suggested that the dosimetry in electromagnetic biological effects experiments could be more appropriately quantified in terms of absorbed dose. In addition, the dose-effect biological data, thus obtained, could be dosimetrically related to the radiation protection guide (in terms of energy flux density) by the additional determination of absorbed dose in human bodies due to a given exposure of electromagnetic waves. Ho and Guy (27) present normalized absorbed-dose distributions in units of watts per kilogram as a function of distance along the axes of tissue-equivalent spheres. Their spheres are irradiated from the -Z direction and dose profiles are presented along the X, Y, and Z axes for frequencies of 100, 1000, 2500, 5000, and 10,000 MHz. These insult versus depth distributions may be used in conjunc- tion with Table I in order to estimate the mean insult to the active bone marrow. Their dose profiles along the three axes could be averaged in order to approximate isotropic exposure. Of course, the precision of such an approximation will be unknown until more RF and microwave studies have been completed on systems involving bone/lung/tissue media in geometries more representative of man. 12 C.

JONES CONCLUSIONS Insult-attenuation operators, obtained by separating the geometrical charac- teristics of a biological detector from the basic transport processes, are directly applicable to the theory of dual action of radiation (28) and other well-known survival models. This approach can produce operational distributions for many types of insults which vary according to geometrical parameters such as penetra- tion distance, source distribution, etc. For detectors which have an insult profile which follows a continuous slowing down approximation the CHORD approach can be used to retain all the fundamental physical parameters as required in charged-particle tracking through the nucleus of a cell. For insults where straggling with energy and angle are important, CHORD distributions are limited to operators on robust-type functions such as absorbed dose. The CHORD process is also applicable to health protection because a personnel dosimeter measures the exposure at the surface of the chest; the measured exposure corresponds neither to the exposure in free space nor to the organ or whole body dose and area dosimeters determine only free space exposure (29). Jones (17) pointed out that a survey meter or personnel dosimeter may overesti- mate the insult to the active marrow by a factor of 10 or underestimate by a factor of 6. In spatially dependent radiation fields, or for exposure to broad beam sources having an orientation other than A-P, it is usually very difficult to have an accurate risk estimate because of normalization to an inaccurate or shielded reading taken at the location of the chest (13). In summary, the method of CHORDs permits rapid insult estimation to a nucleus, cell, organ, or organism and helps to circumvent some of the problems of relating insult or risk to readings from instruments of detection.
