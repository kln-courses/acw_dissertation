<plain_text><page sequence="1">CRIME AND PUNISHMENT: TITYOS, TANTALOS AND SISYPHOS IN ODYSSEY 11 Christiane Sourvinou-Inwood In Odyssey 11. 576-600 Odysseus describes the fate which Tityos, Tántalos and Sisyphos are suffering in Hades.1 My purpose here2 is to consider the nature of the transgressions committed by these three figures, and also the relationship of these transgressions to the form of punishment which the three 'sinners' are described in the Odyssean passage as enduring. Tityos3 is mentioned first - and the order, we shall see, is not without significance. Tityos was lying on the ground, over nine pelethra, while two vultures tore at his liver; he was presumably immobile, since, as Odysseus remarks, he did not ward the birds off with his hands. This was his punishment for having offered violence to Leto. By trying to abduct and rape a goddess, sexually violate her, Tityos offended first, and most obviously, against the divine persons and the honour of Leto, Apollo and Artemis, and Zeus - for the fact that Leto is referred to as Zeus' wife in this passage4 stresses that Tityos transgressed also against Zeus and Zeus' honour and against the family relationships connecting these four divine figures. This offence against their honour was also an offence against their authority as gods. In the case of 1 For discussions pertaining to all three see: A. Dieterich, Nekyia.

For reasons of space and the avoidance of tedium, I am not setting out the ways in which these discussions relate to mine except when it is necessary to counter specific arguments - especially ones which have gained some currency or otherwise affected significantly the discourse on the sinners - or to signal some especially significant agreement. 2 1 shall not consider here the problems relating to the composition of the latter part of Od. 1 1 or its relationship - and the relationship of Od. 1 1 as a whole - to the rest of the Odyssey. I hope to discuss these problems (including the ways in which Od. 11. 576-600 relates to the rest of the poem), and the question of Homeric afterlife beliefs, in a forthcoming paper (a version of which I delivered as a Kinchin Smith Memorial Lecture at the Institute of Education of the University of London and again at the École des Hautes Études in Paris). Here I shall only mention that in my view the passage Od. 1 1 . 576-600 is an integral part of the final composition of the Odyssey by the poet we may refer to as Homer. 3 On Tityos see: Sir James Frazer ed., Apollodorus, The Libraty (London, 1921), ad i.4.2; K.

Furthermore, by presuming to force sexual intercourse on an hierarchically superior being, a goddess, Tityos transgressed also against the sexual code which helps articulate the universe; men must keep within their proper (in this case sexual) station.7 Therefore Tityos transgressed also against the articulation of cosmos and the boundaries between men and gods,8 and thus offended against, and threatened, the cosmic order, as well as the gods who are its guarantors. His excessive and transgressive sexual activity and aggression against a goddess' body is punished through immobility and painful erosion of his organ of sexual desire through the savage excruciating (continuous) invasion of his body by vultures9 - a lower form of life (which is what the vultures are in the Greek hierarchy of the cosmos) - as he himself was a lower form of life when compared to the goddess whom he attacked. Moreover, precisely because the liver is the organ of desire and passion, the vultures' attack on it may have contained a metaphorical10 facet of sexual violence, sexual abuse to which he is submitting, unresisting - a reversal of his role as sexual aggressor. 5 Tityos: son of Gaia in Od. 1 1.576 and in Od. 7.324; schol. Od. 1 1.309 Dindorf. He is also perceived as monstrous in size, as the Giants are (cf. the Odyssean passage, and cf. also Eustath. Comm. ad Od. 1 1.575). On the gigantic and its significance in Greek mythology: C.Calame, 'Les figures grecques du giagantesque', Communications 42 (1985), 147-172. 6 1 have discussed this interactive process in 'Menace and pursuit: differentiation and the creation of meaning', in C. Bérard ed., Image et société en Grèce antique; V iconographie comme méthode ď analyse (forthcoming), section 3. iii, and cf. also 2 and nn. 5-8 for signification in general. 7 Cf. Pind. Pyth. 4.92 referring to Artemis' shooting of Tityos, and also Pind. Pyth. 2.33-6 commenting on Ixion's (attempted) offence against Hera. Men should not attempt to have sexual intercourse with deities. Peleus was, of course, different because he married Thetis with the encouragement of the gods; I have discussed this question, and some aspects of the sexual relationships between men and gods in: 'A series of erotic pursuits: images and meanings', forthcoming in J HS 107 (1987), section 4, and in 'Menace' (see n.6) 3. iii, where I argue that such relationships have dangers for mortals even when they have been instigated by deities. On Ixion cf. below and n.50. 8 Vermeule's (n.l, 120, 127) suggestion that Tityos' attempted rape was an attempt at gaining immortality, belonging to the category of stories in which men try to avoid the necessity of dying and obtain immortality, is, in my view, wrong. Though it is correct that this story belongs to the category of those involving the boundaries, and the testing of the boundaries, between men and gods, not all disturbances of the boundaries symbolize attempts to gain immortality; it depends on the meaning of the various interacting elements of each myth. 9 Radermacher (n.l), 553, suggested that this punishment - which resembles. that of Prometheus (on Prometheus' punishment and deliverance cf. W. Kraus, RE xxiii. 698-701; on the punishmenh^also Hes. Th. 521-32 and West acļ ļoc ) - originated with Tityos; and he remarked on the appropriateness of his being^pqnished for his attack on Leto through the liver, which is the seat of desire. Cf. also on this appropriateness Scherlihg^JÇEs^v. Tityos col. 1597, who connects the role of the vultures with the fact that they are associated with Apollo; tHi^ma^be one factor, but it cannot be the only one, for there are many birds associated with Apollo (cf. bibliography inCß 29 (1979), 239 nn. 41-4); a major factor must be the fact that vultures are carrion birds, and are therefore appropriate invadors of the (sentient) body of a dead man (cf. also below for their symbolic value). To think that Tityos should not have felt any pain (and Tañíalos any thirst or hunger) because the psychai in Hades were not physical bodies would be inappropriate rationalization of ambivalent (cf. on this ambivalence Vermeule (n.l), 8, 30 (though I find her distinction between folklore and religion dubious)) and ambiguous mythological images, brought about by the attempt to make sense of them through rationalizing perceptual filters. 10 A metaphor based on metonymy; on this trope cf., for instance, J. Culler, The Pursuit of Signs , Semiotics , Literature . Deconstruction (London, 1981), 188-209, with bibliography.</page><page sequence="3">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 39 The immobility, which is another aspect of his punishment, has, in my view, two important meanings. First, it is a reversal of his excessive and uncontrolled (transgressive) sexual activity and aggression. That this is not simply a culturally determined judgment, but was significant in the ancient Greek mythological mentality, is shown by the fact that the pair 'crime: attempt to abduct/rape a goddess - punishment: (complete or relative) immobility' is also found in the myth of Theseus' and Peirithous' adventure in Hades, in which their attempt to abduct Persephone resulted (in some versions) in a punishment (in Hades) involving a different, but comparable, immobilization." It is because immobility and impotence in the face of outside aggression contrast with the excessive sexual activity and aggression which characterizes aspiring rapists of goddesses that this punishment is appropriate for Tityos and (in a different form) Theseus and Peirithous.12 Thus Tityos' state in Hades relates to his crime through a series of reversals which clearly helped shape the form of the punishment. He is now passive while when committing the crime he had been active, a victim of aggression while he had been the aggressor, in a state of impotence while he had been in one of uncontrolled sexual overactivity, immobile instead of mobile. The last characteristic, immobility, also characterizes death. The normal movement of the living person contrasts on the one hand with the abnormal excessive movement of the psyche and on the other with the immobility of the corpse.13 And this is the second meaning of immobility in the Tityos myth: it is associated with death. Tityos' punishment in Od. 11.576-81 is based on, constructed through the reshaping of, the image of a corpse lying on the ground immobile and eaten by carrion birds - except that14 Tityos is sentient and suffering, and the suffering goes on forever. The image of Tityos' punishment, then, is, among other things,15 the articulation of a nightmare, a horrifying image of a corpse, and therefore also, potentially, of oneself as a corpse, a corpse with consciousness and feeling and capacity for pain, which is suffering the worst possible fate that a corpse can suffer according to the Greek collective representations: it is being eaten by birds.16 Thus, among other things, this image of Tityos' punishment articulates the secret horror and fear that after death one may be conscious and trapped in one's corpse, in the polarized form involving a corpse being eaten by carrion. This mythological representation exorcises and neutralizes the nightmare by 'marginalizing' it, presenting it as an exceptional occurrence, a terrible punishment for a sin of cosmic dimensions. This is one of the meanings contained in this image. The dominant meanings, of course, pertain to the offences against the gods and the cosmic order; they articulate the offence and frame the transgression, thus also helping to define the correct relationship between men and gods and the appropriate human behaviour, the proper observance of this distance. At a less exalted level, relating to the social rather than the "On Theseus and Peirithous in Hades: Apollod. 2.5.12 and Frazer ad loc. with list of sources; Epir. 1.23-4; Radermacher (n.l), 550; F.

An interesting mode of immobilization was that described by Panyassis (Paus. 10.29.9). In some versions of the myth of Theseus and Peirithous in Hades (cf. Apollod. Epit. 1.23-4; Gregor. Cor. in Rhet. vol. vii, 1312f), as in some versions of the Tityos story (cf. above n.3), snakes are the instruments of punishment, though in different roles in the two cases. 12 On Ixion's punishment see below n.50. '• Cf. J. Bremmer, The Early Greek Concept of the Soul (Princeton, 1983), 85; J.- P. Vernant, Mythe et pensée chez les Grecs (Paris, 1971), ii.74, 75-6. I shall be returning to this below. 14 It is unambiguously implied. 15 For myths are polysémie and are shaped by the realities, preoccupations and perceived answers, beliefs and ideological attitudes of the society which generated them and is deploying, redeploying and reshaping them. 16 1 have discussed the notion of the corpse being eaten by birds and its significance in 'To Die and enter the House of Hades: Homer, Before and After', in; J. Whaley ed., Mirrors of Mortality. Studies in the Social History of Death (London, 1981), 31-2.</page><page sequence="4">40 BICS 33 (1986) cosmic order, the myth's 'messages' articulate also the notion that it is necessary to respect the society's social code - including its established articulation. For in so far as Tityos' sexual aggression against Leto can also be seen as a polarized form of (aggressive) sexual activity directed at an inappropriate object, Tityos' crime is also a polarized instance of a transgression of the social sexual code, itself a (metonymically based) metaphor for the transgression of the social order in general, a transgression which threatens society with disturbance and disorder. Tañíalos,17 who is mentioned second in Odyssey 11, was standing in water which receded every time he tried to assuage his thirst, and under trees with fruit which the wind moved out of his reach every time he tried to pick some and eat them. In later sources Tántalos' punishment often takes a different form involving a stone hanging over his head,18 or sometimes the notion that he is lying under the Sipylos mountain.19 Tántalos' crime is not mentioned in the Odyssean passage. In some of the later versions he was the gods' dinner-companion and offered them the flesh of his son Pelops to eat.20 This is the version found in what is almost certainly our earliest surviving source for Tántalos' crime, the representation on the fragmentary metope 32 from the so-called Primo Thesauros (probably an abnormal temple) at Foce del Sele which belongs to the first half of the sixth century.21 17 On Tántalos: W.

In some sources Tántalos' Homeric punishment is combined with the overhanging rock of the other variant: Apollod.

Apart from the sources for Tántalos' crime and punishment mentioned in these notes cf. also the list in Frazer ad Apollod. 2.1, and Roscher s.v. (vol. 5 cols. 75-86) passim ; and cf. also TrGF vol. 2 Adespota fr.680a 1.12. 20 On the cannibalistic banquet offered to the gods by Tántalos: HN2 (n.17), 99-100. 21 On the representation of Tañíalos at Foce del Sele (on the building's function and date: Robertson (n.19), 116, and caption of pl.32e) see Simon Jdl 1967 (n.l), 281-7, who has shown that the figure in the tripodic vessel must be Pelops, and that the metope depicts Tántalos' crime - as other metopes of this temple represent Tityos' crime and death (cf. above), Sisyphos' punishment (cf. below) and Ixion's punishment. To the Tañíalos theme probably belongs also the representation of Zeus on metope 19 which Simon's reconstruction (fold-up pl. 15) places on the left of metope 32 (see Simon, op. cit., p.288). A case against this interpretation was put forward by M. Schmidt, 'Zur Deutung der Dreifuss-Metope nr.32 von Foce del Sele', in: U. Höckmann and A. Krug edd., Festschrift für Frank Brommer (Mainz, 1977), 265-75. Schmidt has persuasively connected the metope with a scene on a terracotta relief in Basle (her pll. 71.2, 72), in which the figure in the tripod is flanked by a male figure on the right and a woman holding a jug on the left; she believes that the presence of the woman with the jug excludes the Tántalos interpretation and suggests that the figure in the tripod is not Pelops, but either - the interpretation she prefers - Jason being rejuvenated, or Minos being murdered. In my view, the following considerations argue against this hypothesis and suggest that the scenes on the metope and the relief do indeed represent Pelops in the tripod, and therefore Tántalos' crime. First, the size and shape of the body of the figure in the tripod on the Basle relief, and especially the size of the head in proportion to the body when compared to the other figures on that relief, suggests not a young man, but a young boy of eromenos age; the same is true also of the figure who is shown in the tripod on some black figure scenes very similar to the Basle relief and the metope - if anything, the boy on the vases may be even younger than the Basle boy. (Black-figure scenes: Black-figure lekythos Syracuse 20936 (C. H. E. Haspels, Attic Black-</page><page sequence="5">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 41 figured Lekythoi (Paris, 1936), 227 no.38); Black-figure lekythos Leyden PC 32 (Haspels ABL 241 no. 5; CV A (Leyden 2) pl. 105-6); Black-figure lekythos at Chiusi, Bonci Cassuccini Collection ( MonAnt 30, 535, fig. 5).) The connection of these scenes with the metope and the relief is noted by Schmidt, 270 n.23. A sample of representations of eromenoi boys of a similar age in red figure vase-painting is in: La Cité des Images. Religion et société en Grèce antique (Lausanne, 1984), 79-81, figs. 113-7, 119. I am discussing certain aspects of the question of age denotation in Greek iconography in a book in preparation entitled Girls as Bears and other animals. This fits Pelops' age excellently; for he was, as the Poseidon episode shows (cf., for instance, Pind. 01. 1 .25-7), at precisely the right age to be an eromenos. But obviously, it does not fit the mature Minos, nor can it be made to fit a rejuvenated Jason. For whatever the exact form of that version of the Medea-Jason myth in which the rejuvenation mentioned in the hypothesis of Eur. Medea took place (on the variants which are alternatives to Medea's murder of her children see D. L. Page ed., Euripides' Medea (Oxford, 1938, 1952) xxi-xxv), Jason was a mature man and Medea's husband/lover to whom she would have restored his young manhood, not turned into a young boy. (The same argument, incidentally, shows that the male figure in the tripod cannot be Minos (on this hypothesis see also Schmidt, op. cit. with bibliography).) The iconographical motif 'boy in a tripod' has a long history (see, for instance, the mitra from Axos (Schefold (n.3), 32 and pl. 15a)), and its significance relates to the notion of 'rebirth' of one sort or another (see HN2 (n.17), 86-93, 99-102, 122-5). The rejuvenation of older creatures is one particular version, or rather variant transformation, of rebirth, and its articulation could have been modelled on that of the rebirth involving the boy. All that we are concerned with here is that the age of the figure fits Pelops but not his alternatives. Second, it is not true that a female figure with a jug has no place in the Pelops/Tantalos scene; for of the three alternative deities said to have presided over Pelops' rebirth, two, the only two which appear in the early sources, are women: Klotho in Pind. Ol. 1.26, Rhea in Bacchylides fr. 42 Snell - and Hermes in schol. Pind. Ol. 1.40. As Gerber (D. E. Gerber, Pindar's Olympian One: A Commentary (Toronto, 1982), 57 ad 26) notes, the Pindaric è'Çete KAxoťkí) suggests that it is she who presides over Pelops' rebirth in the version reflected in this passage. (The Moirai and especially Klotho are associated with birth and rebirth: B. C. Dietrich, Death , Fate and the Gods (London, 1965), 79-81; GGrR (n.l), 363 and n.3, 524; they are also associated with rebirth (of a different kind) in Plate Rep. x.616c-617e. I suggested elsewhere ( JHS 94 (1974), 126-37) that Klotho is associated with (a different kind of) rebirth on a South Italian representation). Klotho is also associated with the cosmic order (cf. GGrR (n.l); and see, for instance, II. 16.440-9, cf. 432-8; 20.127-8; 24.209-12; Od. 7.192-8, and 'To die' (n.16), 23). As for the jug, it obviously denotes the practical activity with liquids and the cauldron that led to Pelops' resurrection; the fact that Pindar Ol. 1 .26 describes the cauldron as Kaú(X7iòç (on the use of this word see Gerber ad 26 (p.57), R. Parker, Miasma. Pollution and Purification in early Greek Religion (Oxford, 1983), 367) surely implies that the cauldron has been purified; thus the jug in the hand of Klotho (or Rhea) makes perfect sense in the representation of Pelops' resurrection in the cauldron, which signals the restoration of order. Third, an argument which, in the absence of a detailed iconographical analysis, may appear subjective and therefore less compelling. Two of the scenes on the lekythoi cited above (those on the Leyden and the Chiusi lekythoi), with a majestic woman seated on a folding stool on either side of the boy in the tripod and a male figure framing the scene on either side, fit the circumstances of Pelops resurrection, but not, I think, its alternatives; that is, this schema appears to be a suitable iconographical articulation of the Pelops story, in which two majestic female figures, two goddesses, did play important roles (Demeter - or Themis - and Klotho - or Rhea). In the third scene (on the Syracuse lekythos) the role of the two women, their relationship to the cauldron, is differentiated: one is moving away from the cauldron and turning back - which would fit the role of Demeter/Themis - the other is moving towards it, which fits Klotho/Rhea. In these circumstances, the case for interpreting the nexus of scenes under discussion (the Basle relief, the metope and the black-figure scenes) as representing Pelops in the tripod seems to me very strong indeed. One thing which the scenes depicting the four sinners on the Foce del Sele metopes have in common is that they portray a moment after the endangered and disturbed order had been restored. This, in my view, is an important semantic connection which binds this group of metopes interpreted by Simon as representing sinners into a significant thematic category. With regard to Tañíalos, the selection of the particular moment portrayed is determined by the fact that what was most appropriate for decorating a temple was the reassuring fact that the gods are not cannibals but worthy guarantors of the cosmic order which had been endangered and which they restored - a restoration exemplified and symbolized in Pelops' resurrection. Since we know with certainty that the Foce del Sele metopes included Sisyphos and Tityos, and we have very good reason for thinking that Ixion was also represented, and since there is a scene which fits Tántalos in every way, and very much better than it does any possible alternative, we may conclude that, even if we leave aside all the other arguments in favour of Simon's thesis put forward above, the objection to the 'four sinners' identification relies on special pleading - and does not convince. I should note with regard to the Basle relief that, among its other scenes, the fights against the Giants fit excellently the context 'offence against the gods/threat to the cosmic order/reestablishment of order'. (The interpretation of the remaining scenes in the relief is so problematic that any attempt to interpret them in connection with one or other of the interpretations of the tripod scene would be in danger of becoming circular - especially since we cannot know whether or not there was any thematic connection between the different scenes.) I should stress that even if the hypothesis that this metope represents Pelops, and thus Tañíalos' crime, is incorrect, it does not affect my main argument; simply, the early date of the representation of Tántalos'</page><page sequence="6">42 BICS 33 (1986) In order to make sense of the myth of Tántalos' cannibalistic banquet we must consider the meaning of cannibalism in the Greek collective representations.22 The most important aspect of cannibalism is that it is savage food, characterizing beasts as opposed to men,23 and also characterizing humanity's uncivilized past, the stage of savagery and bestiality in opposition to the civilized present: the abandonment of cannibalism was considered one of the features which marked the passage from savagery to civilization.24 Thus, because cannibalism characterizes beasts in opposition to men, savagery in opposition to civilization and disorder in opposition to order, its practice implies, and threatens society with, reversion to bestiality, savagery and disorder. Consequently, Tántalos' crime in the cannibalistic banquet version, his transgression of the taboo against cannibalism and attempt to make the gods partake of human flesh, not only offended the gods but also broke the alimentary code which helped articulate the cosmos; it thus endangered the cosmic order, threatening to drag the gods, who are its guarantors, to the level of bestiality to which Tañíalos himself had drifted, to make the very guarantors of the cosmic order transgress one of the fundamental rules which help articulate the universe.25 Tántalos' transgression of the taboo against cannibalism also endangered human society, for it threatened the breakdown of civilization and a reversion to savagery, of which cannibalism was perceived to be an important characteristic.26 Given the symbolic potency and polysemy of cannibalism in Greek mythology, it is plausible that the statement about man's potential for cannibalism was also, and was perceived to be, a statement about man's potential for moral and other savagery, including the destructive impulses that threaten the social 'contract' and social order.27 Indeed, another aspect of Tántalos' transgression against the social order in this version of the myth - an aspect which represents this threat to the social order in a polarized form - is that he perverted, reversed, his role as a father: instead of nurturing and protecting his son, he killed him and offered him up as food. He thus perverted the values of the family, cannibalistic meal would reinforce my case further. But even without this evidence, the case for considering this variant of the myth as very early is, in my view, strong. On the cannibalistic meal version of Tántalos' crime see also Bacchylides fr.42 Snell and the references in Pind. Ol. 1 , on which see below. 22 On cannibalism: M.

Pind. Ol. 1.40; Lykophr. Alex. 152ff and schol. ad loc.)', according to another version it was Themis who transgressed in this way (schol. Pind. Ol. 1.40). Themis, of course, was a guarantor of the cosmic order par excellence, and her transgression endangered that order in an even more horrifying way. (On Themis: H. Vos, ©épiç (Assen, 1956), 39-78; F. W. Hamdorf, Griechische Kultpersonifikationen der vorhellenistischen Zeit (Mainz, 1964). Some MSS give ©étlSoc, but Themis was a much more appropriate deity: not only was she much more likely to have been thought to have been present at 1 antalos' banquet, but also, and most importantly, she was a most appropriate figure to have been represented as having been dragged into the horrible transgression, in order to illustrate the danger to the cosmic order most dramatically.) Cannibalism breaks down the differentiation between men and beasts: cf. Hes. WD 276-9 and above. 26 Cannibalism, incidentally, is one of the most general symbols of reversal from cosmos to chaos in liminal situations: H. S. Versnel, 'Destruction, Devotio and Despair in a Situation of Anomy: the Mourning for Germanicus in Triple Perspective', in Perennitas. Studi in onore di Angelo Brelich (Rome, 1980), 591 n.209. 27 On cannibalism as a political metaphor: Detienne, DS (n.22), 58-9; Detienne-Svenbro (n.22), 228.</page><page sequence="7">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 43 and therefore also threatened the social order; first, because the social order relied on the family unit, and especially on the father-son relationship and succession, and, second, because family relationships are also a metaphor for that social order. Thus in the cannibalism version of the myth, Tántalos transgressed against, and threatened, both the divine/cosmic and the human order.28 Another myth involving the offer of a cannibalistic meal to the gods in the context of a commensality between men and gods is found in the myth of Lykaon. This myth has many meanings - some of which it shares with the myth of Tántalos - and reflects also (which means it is also shaped through its relationship to) a particular Arcadian ritual.29 In both myths commensality with the gods leads to a drift to bestiality as represented by cannibalism, and to an attempt to contaminate the gods by offering them human flesh. In one of the variants of the Lykaon myth Lykaon is turned into a wolf, a mytheme which - among other things - articulates explicitly, in narrative terms, this drift to bestiality: the punishment for Lykaon's bestiality and attempt to contaminate the gods with bestiality, which endangered the proper articulation of the cosmos, was the loss of his humanity, his transference to the lower than human category of beasts, towards which he had drifted. To be more precise, this association of cannibalism and bestiality is one of the parameters governing the mytheme of Lykaon's metamorphosis - in interaction with the ritual material also reflected in, and shaping, this myth.30 Lykaon's and (in the cannibalism version) Tántalos' elevation to commensality with the gods ends up with the two men drifting to the pole of bestiality, reverting to a savagery which characterizes animals and differentiates them from men. Thus (in these two myths) when men come in close contact with the gods they drift to the opposite (from the gods') pole of animality. One of the meanings of the Tañíalos myth, then, is that men should not aspire to be the gods' companions, men and gods should not get too close to each other, because if that happens the boundaries between the categories gods/men/beasts into which the universe is articulated come under pressure and are endangered. That this meaning was indeed an ancient perception, and is not a modern culturally determined construct, is shown by the fact that the notion that the potentiality of bestiality as represented by cannibalism is something separating men from gods, in conjunction with the notion that the man who comes too close to the gods may drift to the opposite pole of bestiality symbolized by cannibalism, is also found, in a different form, in the myth of Tydeus. Tydeus lost the chance of becoming immortal because he sucked the brain of his dead enemy, an action with disgusted Athena and caused her to withhold the gift of immortality which she was bringing to him.31 This recurrence of the 28 Cannibalism primarily food for thought helping to define normality and the proper human behaviour: Detienne, DS (n.22), 53 and passim; cf. also Parker (n.21), 326. 29 On Lykaon: Ph. Borgeaud, Recherches sur le dieu Pan (Geneva, 1979), 41-66; HN2 (n.l7), 84-92. Cf. also Detienne, Mythes (n.22), 85; Piccaluga (n.17), passim. On a comparison of Tántalos to Lykaon cf.

As Burkert remarked (HN2, 99-104), the myths of Tántalos and Lykaon are connected to a ritual associated with a particular locality. This, of course, does not affect the fact that the mythological reflection of the ritual material was shaped also by the representations under discussion here. In some versions of these myths (cf., for instance, Borgeaud. 46 n.7) the ability to distinguish human flesh from animal is a divine characteristic (while we know from myths like those of Thyestes, Tereus and Klymenos that men cannot distinguish between the two), but in certain circumstances the gods are capable of eating human flesh without recognizing it, as did Demeter with Pelops" shoulder. This is itself another negative drift, another threat to the boundaries between gods, men and beasts, caused by cannibalism and brought about by Tántalos. 31 On this myth: Pherekydes FGrH 3 F 97; Apollod. 3.6.8 and Frazer ad loc. with list of sources; J. D. Beazley.

An important difference separates Tydeus from the other two cannibals: Tydeus committed cannibalism himself and disgusted Athena, but he did not attempt to contaminate the gods, drag them into cannibalistic bestiality as Tántalos and Lykaon did; thus his punishment was simply the loss of immortality, the reversion to the condition of ordinary mortal. All three myths are saying that men are always capable of cannibalism,32 always have the potential to revert to bestiality, and it is this which separates them from the gods; and because of this they must be kept at a distance from the gods, otherwise they can endanger the gods' status and the cosmic order. Men's proper place is between animals and gods; when they come too close to the gods they can and do drift to the other pole of bestiality, and this endangers the cosmic order. Too close a proximity to the gods is characterized as negative, and associated with cannibalism. Thus Lykaon's crime marks the end of the commensality between men and gods.33 Tántalos and Lykaon belong to the 'Golden Age', the 'primordial' past. In so far as in myth that past is a locus for defining and evaluating the present by differentiation, it is by necessity ambivalent and ambiguous. For it is negative to the extent in which it serves as a mirror for the present's positive self-image (civilization where previously there was savagery); and positive to the extent in which it is the locus where the desirable characteristics absent from the present (for instance the lack of close proximity to the gods) must be located so as to explain and legitimate their absence. It is in that 'space' that what may appear desirable but is impossible - such as the closer contact with the gods - is explored, and its impossibility defined and motivated. Thus the negative traits (savagery) came to be associated with desirable traits absent from the present, so that the present becomes partly legitimated through the presentation of an inextricable connection between the two, the negative and the desirable, a connection which leads to, and thus associates the desirable characteristics with, disorder and threat to the cosmic order. Since the realities and symbolic articulations of the present constitute the norm legitimated by 'the other' which is the primordial past, the shape and symbolic characteristics of that past are determined by those present realities and articulations. In this symbolic play, cannibalism is the counter representing savagery which threatens order.34 Pindar's discourse on Tántalos (Ol. 1.23-53) refers to the story of his cannibalistic crime (cf. 26-7, 35-52), but professes to refrain from ascribing cannibalism to the gods. In the version he goes on to recount in Ol. 1.60-4, Tañíalos stole from the gods the nectar and the ambrosia through which they had made him immortal and gave it to mortal men. However, line 36 suggests very strongly that until then the cannibalistic banquet was the established version of the story of Tántalos' crime - which fits the fact that it is the version represented at Foce dele Moreau, 'A propos d'Oedipe: la liaison entre trois crimes. Parricide, inceste et cannibalism', in S. Said, F. Desbordes, J. Bouffartique, A. Moreau, Études de Littérature ancienne. Homère. Horace. Le mythe d'Oedipe. Les 'Sentences de Sextus' (Paris, 1979), 107, 1 14, 118, 122 n.51. This myth dates from a period in which it was believed that some special men could obtain immortality (cf. below on the Pindaric version of the Tántalos myth). Thus Tydeus' immortality in this story is semantically correlative not only with Tántalos' immortality in the Pindaric version but also with Tántalos' commensality with the gods, which is part of the cannibalistic version in which there is nc mention of immortality. 32 In Orphic myth cannibalism is the 'original sin' committed by the Titans who ate Dionysos, were subsequently killed by thunder and out of their ashes men were bom. (On this myth cf. Detienne, DS (n.22), 68-94; also M. L. West, The Orphic poems (Oxford, 1983), 140-75.) 33 See Borgeaud (n.29), 46-7. 34 Commensality and cannibalism/bestiality go together, and both are related to an ambiguous Golden Age: cf. Vidal-Naquet (n.22), 43-4, 51-3; Borgeaud (n.29), 45, 65. They are excesses which help define the present through opposition.</page><page sequence="9">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 45 Sele. If this is correct, it was perhaps a change in attitudes such as that reflected in Ol. 1 , as well as, subsequently, the impetus of Ol. 1 itself, that gave rise to the alternative versions of Tántalos' crime - in the context of the literary exploration of the relationship between the divine and the human world and of the boundaries of the divine. The crime described by Pindar in Ol. 1 .60-435 is semantically very closely related to that of cannibalism; it is its reverse transgression.36 Like cannibalism, it involves Tántalos' commensality with the gods, and it is a transgression pertaining to the food which is appropriate to the different beings that make up the cosmos. While in the cannibalistic version Tántalos offered the gods savage food characterizing beasts, in the Pindaric version he stole the divine food and drink, the nectar and ambrosia,37 through which the gods had made him immortal, and gave them to his mortal friends. Thus in this version Tañíalos again abused the trust and hospitality of the gods, and also disturbed the articulation of the cosmos, the boundaries between beasts, men and gods, by using his position as the gods' dinner companion to break the alimentary code in a way that upset the alimentary articulation of the cosmos by mismatching categories, here by giving to humans the food of the gods which conferred immortality - thus usurping the gods' privilege to allow passage from one category to the other. In Eur. Or. 8-10 Tántalos is punished because, having been a dinner companion of the gods, he had an unbridled tongue, that is, revealed things concerning his divine dinner companions which he should not have revealed.38 The story that he revealed the gods' secrets to men also involves Tántalos in an abuse of his commensality with the gods, and a disturbance of the boundaries between men and gods. The same is true of the version39 according to which Tántalos was living with the gods, and his crime was that, when Zeus promised to grant him whatever he asked for, Tántalos asked for pleasures and a life like that of the gods. Zeus, bound by his promise, granted him his wishes but stopped him from enjoying them by hanging a stone over his head which prevented him from reaching any of the things lying nearby. Leaving aside Tántalos' generic immoderate love of pleasures, the important notion is that he transgressed the limits of his condition: though admitted to the company and dinner-table of the gods, he wanted to be more like them than was appropriate, and than they had already granted him. In all these versions, Tañíalos' commensality with the gods had dire consequences.40 In a different version of the story Tañíalos refused to return a dog belonging to Zeus which Pandareos had stolen and given to Tántalos to keep for him.41 This version appears to be a 35 Cf. also schol.

(See also Frazer ad loc. and list of further sources.) 39 Nostoi fr.[10] Kinkel [fr. dubium] [= Athen, vii.28 lb]. 40 It should be noted that Aleman also appears to be referring to a version in which Tántalos had been the gods' dinner-companion: cf. Calarne, Aleman (n.l8), p.494. 41 This is one of the versions in schol. Pind. OI. 1.90 Boeck; op. cit. 97. It is clear from fr. 573 Radt that the misbehaviour over the dog was mentioned by Sophocles in his Tántalos (cf. Pearson ii. 209-10). It has been</page><page sequence="10">46 BICS 33 (1986) transformation, an attenuated version, of the crime described in the Pindaric variant of the story, combining milder versions of the motifs 'offending the gods and transgressing against them': 'stealing/ (milder version:) accessory to stealing something belonging to the gods', and 'privileging one's relationships to men over those to the gods.' This is the only version in which Tántalos' crime does not involve his role as dinner companion of the gods, and it is interesting to note that it does not entail a punishment in Hades or in a cosmic setting, but a very particular, sui generis type of punishment, lying under Mount Sipylos.42 In these circumstances, and taking also account of the fact that the earliest attested version of Tañíalos' crime is that of the cannibalistic meal, we may conclude that it is extremely implausible that the version of Tántalos' crime underlying the Odyssean description could have been the offence involving the dog. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that, if it is accepted that Tañíalos' transgression in Odyssey 1 1 was indeed connected with his role as dinner companion of the gods, there is a perfect symmetry between his crime and his punishment. For Tantalos's violation of his privilege of commensality with the gods is punished through the reversal of this highest form of eating and drinking: hunger and thirst intensified by the immediate vicinity of food and drink.43 If, as seems to be the case, in the earlier versions his offence pertained to the breaking of the alimentary code which helps articulate the cosmos, and thus related to the food and drink he shared with the gods, the symbolic significance of the punishment is even stronger, and the symmetry even more striking. This is especially true if, as is likely to be the case, the crime underlying the passage in Odyssey 1 1 was the cannibalistic banquet, a radical and dangerous transgression of the alimentary code and the articulation of the universe which that code helps effect - as well as a horrifying offence against the gods. For in that case, in this version, Tántalos in Hades can no longer eat, and suffers eternally from intensified hunger and thirst, because he transgressed the taboo against cannibalism, and, most importantly, tried to make the gods partake of human flesh, thus threatening to drag down to bestiality the divine guarantors of the cosmic order - which includes the proper articulation between gods, men and animals, which is also reflected in the alimentary code. In Pind. 01. 1.60-4 Tántalos had attained immortality before his transgression.44 Correlative with this is the fact that his punishment takes place in a cosmic setting45 and not in Hades, and relates to something other than the inability to obtain food and drink. For the need of the latter characterizes men (and animals) and is associated with mortality.46 Tántalos' mortality - which is in harmony with the dominant attitudes to death reflected in the Homeric poems, that every one dies47 - corresponds to a punishment located in Hades; Tañíalos' acquisition of immortality results in his punishment being transferred to a cosmic setting; while the suggested (C. R. Post, The dramatic art of Sophocles as revealed by the fragments of the lost plays', HSCP 33 (1922), 37) that this may have been only one of the crimes ascribed to Tántalos by Sophocles in that tragedy. 42 The two are associated in schol. Ol. 1 .90 Boeck and op. cit. 97. 43 Segal (n.17), 39, considers Tántalos' eternal hunger as 'the reverse of the plenititude and feasting which follow proper sacrifice'. 44 There is a growing trend in the Greek collective representations of the archaic period towards ascribing some kind of immortality to heroic figures who in Homer would have gone to Hades. (I have discussed this in To die', (n.16), 20, 37; and in 'A Trauma in Flux: Death in the 8th Century and After', in R. Hägg ed., The Greek Renaissance of the Eighth Century BC: Tradition and Innovation (Stockholm, 1983), 36-7, 45.) 45 Cf. Eur. Or. 7-8, 982-5. 46 See Detienne, DS (n.22), 56. I now think that I was wrong to suggest (To die' (n.16)) that originally the setting of Tityos' and Tántalos' punishments was a cosmic one, and that it was subsequently transferred to Hades, perhaps by Homer (see next paragraph). 47 Cf. 'To die', (n.16); Trauma' (n.44), 36.</page><page sequence="11">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 47 transformation of his offence into something different - still involving a transgression against the gods but not of quite such a fundamental and threatening nature, went together with a transformation of the stone threatening him into Mount Sipylos under which he is said to be lying.48 In all but the latter version, Tántalos not only abused the trust of the gods and offended against them, but also threatened the cosmic order, disturbed the articulation of the cosmos by disturbing the boundaries between beasts, men and gods - mostly by breaking the alimentary code which articulates the cosmos. In this case, Tántalos' close proximity to the gods proved to have threatening and destructive results. This motif, we saw, is also found in other tales of men befriended by, and sitting at the same table as, the gods;49 besides Lykaon, a most notable example is that of Ixion, who, like Tántalos, was admitted to the gods' company and dinner table but, like Tityos, he tried to rape a goddess, Hera, for which offence he was punished, becoming one of the great 'sinners', together with Tityos, Tántalos and Sisyphos.50 Consequently, one of the perceptions and beliefs expressed in, and shaping, the Tántalos myth as a whole51 is the representation discussed above with reference to the cannibalistic version: that too close a proximity between men and gods is dangerous, that there must be a proper distance between the two, that this distance which exists defacto in everyday reality is not only inescapable, but also desirable. In these circumstances, we conclude that the form of the torment suffered by both Tántalos and Tityos in Odyssey 1 1 reflects the crime for which they are being punished. Sisyphos52 in Odyssey 1 1 is pushing a large boulder up a hill, but the stone keeps rolling back and Sisyphos has to start all over again, straining and sweating. In the dominant strand of the tradition Sisyphos' crime was that he tried to escape death, and managed to escape from Hades. This story appears in different variants, but all the variants ascribe to Sisyphos the same punishment as Od. 1 1.593-600. Alcaeus (fr. 38A LP, lines 5ff) refers to the fact that Sisyphos succeeded in returning from Hades thanks to his cunning, a version also mentioned by Theognis i.701-12 where Sisyphos is said to have persuaded Persephone.53 In Pherecydes FGrH 3 F 119 Sisyphos had incurred the wrath of Zeus by giving information to Asopos concerning his daughter whom Zeus had abducted; Zeus sent Thanatos to him, but Sisyphos bound Thanatos up; the result of this was that no one could die, until Ares freed Thanatos and handed Sisyphos over to him. However, before be died Sisyphos ordered his wife tá vevoptopeva pf| jréprteiv eíç 'Âiôou. Consequently, when in Hades, Sisyphos asked for, and obtained, Hades' permission to return to the upper world to censure her, but when he reached the upper world he refused to return to Hades until he died in old age; Hades then forced him to roll a stone in order to prevent him from escaping 48 In schol.

According to schol. Pind. Ol. 1.97 Boeck, Sisyphos was punished for deceiving Plouton: when he was about to die Sisyphos ordered his wife not to bury him, then when he arrived in Hades he asked Plouton to let him get back to the upper world in order to punish his wife for neglecting him; but when he reached the upper world he did not want to return to Hades; Hermes brought him back against his will and he was punished. Eustath. Comm. ad Od. 1 1.592 says that Sisyphos, having died and returned to life again through a ruse, did not want to go back to the nether world as he had agreed to do, until old age returned him to Hades, where he suffered punishment. The story of Sisyphos' escape from Hades and his punishment was also told in Aeschylus' play(s) Sisyphos drapetes and/or Sisyphos petroky listes. 54 Sophocles' Sisyphos probably included the story that Sisyphos escaped death through persuasion, reflected also in Sophocles' Phil. 624-5." The earliest known representation of Sisyphos' torment is on one of the metopes at Foce del Sele, dated in the first half of the sixth century;56 in this iconographical version a winged male demon is perched on Sisyphos' back as the latter is rolling the stone up the hill. As Simon has convincingly argued,57 this is not a different variant of the myth, but an 'emblematic'58 representation in which Thanatos is shown triumphant over Sisyphos. Obviously, therefore, here also the crime for which Sisyphos is punished is that he tried to escape death. Pausanias 2.5.1 and Apollodoros 1.9.3 claim that Sisyphos was punished because of the information he gave to Asopos, an incident which, we saw, is elsewhere the first link in the chain that leads to Sisyphos' escape from Hades. The following reasons show that the variant which makes the Asopos incident into Sisyphos' main crime is later, and that in all the early versions, and thus also in the one underlying Od. 1 1 .593-600, Sisyphos was punished for his attempt to escape death. Firstly, the variant according to which Sisyphos is punished for trying to escape death is not only found in the vast majority of sources, it is also the only one found in all the early versions, and over a wide geographical area. Secondly, the attempt to escape death through cunning and trickery fits Sisyphos' persona as a cunning man and trickster;59 the ultimate in cunning, the trickster's natural crime of excess, is to try to trick and thus defeat death.60 We should therefore expect Sisyphos' original crime to have involved trickery, the attempt to escape death by trickery, and this is indeed the version reflected in Alcaeus and Theognis, which may support the hypothesis that it was the earliest. If this is correct, the binding up of Thanatos would be a further elaboration, involving force because Thanatos is a violent figure61 and cannot be persuaded.62 The Underworld deities can be persuaded, and it is them whom Sisyphos 54 On Aeschylus' Sisyphos see S.

The</page><page sequence="13">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 49 persuades and tricks.63 The combination of the violent binding of Thanatos with the escape from Hades through persuasion and trickery intensifies the myth's central representation which concerns the inescapability of death. Moreover, the mytheme 'Sisyphos bound Thanatos and no one could die' intensifies the theme 'upsetting the life-death cycle and thus the cosmic order', also expressed in the basic motif of Sisyphos escaping death. The immobilization through which Thanatos is neutralized corresponds to the immobilization which death brings to the human body; Sisyphos and Thanatos' roles are here the reverse of the norm. Another argument suggesting that the version involving Asopos is a later development of the myth is the following. The Asopos incident pertains to the general theme 'offending deities' and it makes perfect sense where it stands in Pherekydes' version: Sisyphos offends Zeus who punishes him with premature death; Sisyphos revolts against this fate and tries to escape death. In Pherekydes' version, the wrongness of Sisyphos' action is to some extent deconstructed by the fact that it was Zeus who first disturbed the life-death cycle by (over-reacting to a relatively minor offence and) punishing Sisyphos with death before his time.64 Thus Sisyphos here does not attempt to gain a privileged extension of his life, but to regain what he would argue was his due. The story's centre, then, is not the inescapability of death, as it was, for example, in Alcaeus; the 'inescapability of death' motif is woven into another, here larger, theme: the confrontation between Zeus and Sisyphos, a god and human cunning, in which Sisyphos won the temporary reprieve from death which he was seeking, his 'due allotment of life'. The following elements are correlative in this version. 1) Sisyphos offends Zeus; Zeus disturbs the cosmic order (in a minor way) by trying to rob Sisyphos of his allotted time-span. 2) Sisyphos fights back through brute force and temporarily wins and upsets the cosmic order radically; subsequently he escapes death through cunning and manages to live on until old age. That is, correlative with the fact that Zeus began the disturbance and Sisyphos was, in some ways, at least partly 'right' to expect to live his full allotted span is the fact that he succeeds in doing so. Third, when Sisyphos eventually dies, his rolling the stone is presented (Pherekydes FGrH 3 F 1 19) as a means of keeping him in Hades where he belongs, and preventing him from escaping again and upsetting the cosmic order. That is, the fact that he escaped death once (to live out his full life), crossed the boundaries between life and death fraudulently once and stayed on in life while he belonged in Hades, opens up the possibility that he might do so again, and escape evolution of Charos in Greek tradition', in S. Vryonis ed., The 'Past' in Medieval and Modem Greek Culture (Malibu, 1978), 222-3. 62 Cf. Aesch. Niobe fr. 161 Radt ( TrGF vol.3). 63 The same two versions of the escape from death which are combined in the Sisyphos myth, and the antithesis between immobilizing Thanatos and persuading the Underworld deities, is also found in Eur. Ale., where they are alternatives (847-53, 1 140-2). The notion that Thanatos is the same as Hades in the Alcestis (cf. discussion in Garland (n.61), 58) is, in my view based on a misunderstanding of poetic language. Surely, TtxepcoTÒç AiÔaç in 262 is a metaphorical way of describing Thanatos, and in 268 7t^r|aiov Aiôaç refers both to this metaphorical reference and to the notion that she is near dying/going to Hades. 64 This differs from the theme 'deity punishes individual who neglects to honour him/her' in fundamental ways. First, neglecting to honour a deity is a much more serious offence in terms of Greek religious mentality; modern scholarship has often seen it primarily in terms of the god's Tipīļ; in fact it pertains also to the articulation of the cosmos through the pantheon of a polytheistic religion. Second, in those cases, at least in tragedy, the gods work through the offender who collaborates in bringing about his/her own doom; Sisyphos only collaborates in bringing about his punishment in Hades; as far as his death was concerned, Zeus gave him no 'choice', he simply sent Thanatos to him. Another tale-bearer who - when the number of people punished in the afterlife grew in the context of the trend towards an individual (as opposed to the earlier undifferentiated, collective) destiny of the shades (on this development; 'To die' (n.16), 22, 37; 'Trauma' (n.44), 36-7, 45-6) - came to suffer punishment in Hades is Askalaphos (on Askalaphos see Apollod. 1.5.3 and Frazer (n.3) ad loc; 2.5.12; and N. J. Richardson ed.. The Homeric Hymn to Demeter (Oxford, 1974), 286-7). The form of his punishment in the version in which Demeter placed a rock over him resembles that of Tañíalos.</page><page sequence="14">50 BICS 33 (1986) from Hades, and thus endanger the cosmic order and the life-death cycle in a radical way. Thus he is 'fastened' in Hades through perpetual motion and toil. This particular version of the Sisyphos myth expresses, and is articulated by - among others - the following perceptions. Life and death are under the control of the gods, and not of men; for men to attempt to control death is wrong and whoever does it will be severely punished. However, the gods must exercise that control wisely; if they do not they may also disturb the cosmic order - though only temporarily. This version, then, is the product of an age in which the inescapability of death had been somewhat loosened and had ceased to be the central 'message', and also an age interested in exploring the complex interplay between divine and human responsibility, action, retribution. This makes the first half of the fifth century an ideal context for the creation of this variant. Since the first known version of this variant is found in Pherekydes, it is not impossible that he may have invented it. But I think Aeschylus is a more plausible candidate for its creation. The overall treatment of the myth suggested here would fit Aeschylus - and what exiguously little is known about the Sisyphos play(s). In any case, the Asopos story belongs organically in this context, filling the required space 'relatively minor offence which attracts the wrath of Zeus who overreacts by punishing Sisyphos with death'. This suggests that the mytheme involving Asopos is the product of an elaboration (perhaps of the first half of the fifth century) of the theme 'Sisyphos attempts to escape death' rather than an original alternative of the escape from death. If this is correct, the complex version of the Sisyphos myth reflected in Pherekydes was later squeezed into a synoptic summary which missed out the middle portion - which was originally the myth's focus. This happened because the story was reworked and summarized by mythographers who did not share in the mythological mentality which had generated the myth and determined its archaic and classical articulations; the mythographers' funerary ideology in particular was very different from that in which the inescapability of death was a central tenet. It is significant that this version which misses out Sisyphos' attempts to escape death is only found in very late mythographical sources. Another argument in favour of the view that it is the myth involving Sisyphos' attempt to escape death which is reflected in Odyssey 1 1 is the following. When a dead person required the living to bury him or give him some other honour/offering in post-Homeric times, he returned to the upper world as a shade and manifested himself to the living to make his request (cf., for instance, Eur. Hec. 1-50 (49-50 entails that Polydoros is thought of as having already entered Hades); Soph. Polyxena. TrGF iv. 523). Of course, this mythological schema depends on a nexus of afterlife beliefs in which it is possible for a shade to return briefly to the upper world even after he had entered Hades. It is clear that in the Sisyphos myth Sisyphos returned to the upper world as a living person, indeed, the myth depends on this 'return to life' (as opposed to 'apparition of the shade') of Sisyphos. This suggests that the basic lines of the Sisyphos myth as we know it were articulated at a time, and in the context of a system of funerary ideology and beliefs, in which the obvious later model for a dead person returning to the upper world to request his due, that is the 'return of the shade', was not available, and the mytheme 'return to life in order to obtain some honour due to a dead person' made sense - as an exceptional extraordinary occurrence. Sisyphos' exceptional cunning and persuasion allowed him to convince Hades to let him return temporarily to the world of the living; but it is because there was no established model 'shade returns to request his due', and no room for such a model was allowed by the afterlife beliefs of the period, that he could use this request as a stratagem for returning to life.</page><page sequence="15">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 51 Consequently, in my view, the myth of Sisyphos' return to life could not have been created at a time when shades could - in certain circumstances - return to the upper world. Since the belief that once in Hades the shades could not leave it to return to the upper world is found in Homer and disappears soon afterwards,65 I suggest that the myth of Sisyphos' attempt to escape death by persuading Hades to allow him to return to life could not have been invented much after the date in which the Homeric poems took their final form, and was almost certainly the myth underlying the Odyssean passage.66 Because the myth was already established, and could only make sense in terms of Sisyphos' return to life, the exceptional character of Sisyphos' story allowed his exceptional return to life to stand in the new system of beliefs and attitudes. That is, it is possible to see how this return to life could have been left unchanged, subsumed into the overall spacing 'Sisyphos' exceptionality and abnormal attempt to return to life', after the model 'return of the shade to request his due from the living' had become established; but it is very difficult to accept that this myth could have been created at a time, and in the context of an ideology, in which it was believed that the shades could return to the upper world, and in which the model 'shade returns to the upper world to request his due' was established. The fact that in the Homeric system of funerary beliefs and attitudes the shades could not enter Hades until after they had been buried entails that the due which Sisyphos had returned to life to request could not have been his burial, as it is in some of the later versions; it would have been some omitted offerings of the erection of a stele or something of this kind.67 When beliefs changed and the shades could enter Hades even before burial (n.67), burial became the obvious omission on which to base a request to be allowed to return to the upper world. I suggest that we can perhaps distinguish two stages in the development of the Sisyphos myth. In the first, which corresponds to a funerary ideology in which it was believed that the shades entered Hades only after burial and could never return to the upper world, that is in the Homeric and earlier version, Sisyphos returned to life in the upper world in order to request some part of the due of the dead - but not burial itself - which, on his instructions, had not been given him. After the shades were able to enter Hades before burial, burial, which was the central 'due of the dead' and a focal preoccupation in the Greek funerary attitudes, became the omission ordained and used by Sisyphos as an excuse for his return to life. Od. 24. Iff68 gives us the terminus post quem for the relaxation of the rule that the unburied cannot enter Hades, and thus, I suggest, also for this second stage in the development of the Sisyphos myth. In these circumstances, we may conclude that the crime for which Sisyphos is punished in the early versions of the myth was the attempt to escape death, and that this was the myth underlying the description of his punishment in Odyssey 11. The consideration of the relationship between Sisyphos' escape from Hades and the punishment which he is described as suffering in Odyssey 1 1 will provide some confirmation for this conclusion. 65 Cf. Trauma' (n.44), 46. I am discussing the case for this view in some detail in a book which 1 am at present completing, entitled Charon who? An exercise in reading - focussing on death and epitaphs , section IV.3.b. 66 I am aware of the fact that this argument depends on postulating consistency between the different parts of the poems - normally an unwarranted assumption where the Homeric epics are concerned. However, in my view, consistency does exist as far as this particular belief is concerned (cf. 'To die' (n.16), passim: 'Trauma' (n.44), passim ; Charon (n.65), IV.3.b). 67 On the relationship between burial and entering Hades in the Homeric poems and in archaic and classical times see Charon (n.65), IV.6.

In some articulations of the myth (for example in Alcaeus) this inescapability of death is the story's centre. By escaping from Hades Sisyphos committed manifold offences. Obviously, he misbehaved towards, and offended against, Hades and Persephone. He also offended against the cosmic order, which was disturbed and threatened by his attempt to escape death. For in the ideology reflected in the epics the cosmic order included, we saw, the principle that everyone dies and goes to Hades and stays there. At all times it included the belief that there are proper boundaries between life and death and these boundaries must not be crossed except when appropriate. Deceiving the gods and returning to the world of the living when dead, crossing the boundaries at man's will, threatens the articulation of, the boundaries between, the world of the living and the world of the dead, between life and death, which constitute a fundamental aspect of the cosmic order. In some versions the motif 'Sisyphos disturbed the cosmic order' is made explicit and intensified: he upset the whole life-death cycle by bringing about a situation in which (temporarily) no one died. In addition, Sisyphos can also be said to have endangered the social order, which is based on death and the succession of the generations. In my view, the form of Sisyphos' punishment reflects the nature of his crime, in a way comparable to the cases of Tityos and Tántalos. Sisyphos escaped to the upper world and was brought down again. Moving upwards and being made to be brought down again is the basic structure of Sisyphos' punishment, this is what his toiling to perform an unfinishable task involves. Since this up and down movement constitutes the underlying structuring pattern, the central skeleton, of both his crime and his punishment, his punishment reproduces, and is structured by, the transgressive movement which constituted his crime - now endlessly repeated. In Greek funerary ideology and beliefs 'up' stands for the upper world and 'down' for Hades. Movement up a hill/mountain is the one most obvious representation of an upwards/downwards/upwards movement in terms of human experience. Rolling a stone up a hill is - among other things - an intensified, more strenuous, form of the upward movement. Thus the endless upwards and downwards movement of Sisyphos' punishment reproduces endlessly and in a physical form Sisyphos' crime, represents it through an image, and also symbolizes the impossibility of achieving what Sisyphos attempted, to escape death. Sisyphos' endless movement then, is, among other things, a representation of the inescapability of death - and of man's potent desire to escape death which he knows to be futile. Sisyphos' perpetual movement is made more strenuous, thus intensifying the punishment, by the fact that it takes the form of a task, pushing a boulder up the hill, a strenuous task from everyday life transformed into a punishment fit for a 'cosmic sinner' by its unfinishability. The fact that the upwards and downwards motion reproducing Sisyphos' crime in the representation of his punishment took the form of the stone-pushing task is correlative with, and thus was determined by, some or all of the following factors. First, given that a movement up a hill was the obvious imagistic representation of the transgressive movement, pushing a boulder up a hill is an obvious mode of intensification of the upward motion among the models offered by everyday life - - as the task is an obvious mode for expressing the punitive 'centre' of the activity. Second, the stone's symbolic association with barrenness, immobility and death makes it an appropriate instrument of post-mortem punishment.69 It is possible that, because of 69 There may have been an association of ideas between the inorganic stone's barrenness and Sisyphos' unproductive toil; the stone's symbolic association with permanence and lack of mobility makes it an appropriate symbol for</page><page sequence="17">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 53 the stone's symbolic association with death, Sisyphos' pushing the stone upwards in a movement in which upwards signified movement to the upper world was an important element in the symbolic identification of his punishment with his attempt to escape from Hades and death. The fact that stones were used as grave-markers70 may have been a contributory factor in that symbolic nexus. Sisyphos' punishment also relates to his crime through the following symmetries and reversals - which can thus be seen to have helped define the parameters for the creation of this myth, to have helped shape the form of Sisyphos' punishment in Hades. First, the contrast between his endless physical toil and his mental toil, the cunning expended in his attempt to escape death. Related to this is the fact that the form of Sisyphos' punishment involves the neutralization of his (dangerous) powers. The trickster with the cunning which deceived the gods is forced to perform physical labour where his mental agility can avail him nothing, involving inanimate objects (the slope, the boulder) which he cannot trick or persuade. This triumph of raw nature over Sisyphos' cunning and 'culture' is also correlative, is shaped by, and expresses, the notion also that in this case nature defeats culture, that all man's culture and cunning are powerless against the natural law of death,71 Of course, things are not quite as clear-cut as that, since death is part of the cosmic order guaranteed by the gods, and thus, in some ways, part of culture, and it was the Underworld deities who punished Sisyphos and ordained and controlled his confrontation with the natural elements. The futility of the toil which Sisyphos expended in his attempt to escape death corresponds to the futility of his physical toil in Hades. For, of course, one of the dimensions of his punishment is that, because the task is unfinishable, Sisyphos' toil is futile toil. This is another element helping to stress the abnormality of Sisyphos' condition as a sinner punished in Hades, through reversals and contrasts in which life is characterized by productive work, productive controlled motion, death is characterized by no work, abnormal excessive motion of the psyche/immobility of the corpse, while Sisyphos is characterized by unproductive work and perpetual uncontrolled/precontrolled motion. The basic idea expressed through these relationships is that Sisyphos toiled mentally to escape death in vain, and now he toils physically and equally in vain. Sisyphos' punishment also includes an almost symmetrical reversal of the motif of Sisyphos' immobilization and neutralization of Thanatos - which, we saw, itself involves a reversal (Sisyphos immobilized Thanatos as Thanatos immobilizes men): Sisyphos' punishment involves, among other things, a continuous motion from which there is no escape: he is trapped in perpetual motion which takes the form of the performance of an unfinishable action. It is in this context that we are to understand Pherekydes' notion that Hades forced Sisyphos to roll the stone as a means of preventing him from escaping: Sisyphos is tied inside the continuous cycle of motion - and this is symmetrical to his having tied up Thanatos.72 The futility of Sisyphos' toil results from its unfinishability, which expresses, and articulates in narrative terms, the endlessness of the task, the notion that Sisyphos is enternally moving up - down - up - down and so on, forever trapped in perpetual motion. Sisyphos' eternal, immutable, 'imprisonment' which involves perpetual motion, but is also fixed in one spot, the slope of the hill. 70 Cf., for instance, D. C. Kurtz and J. Boardman, Greek Burial Customs (London, 1 97 1 ), 56-7. 71 Sisyphos also used culture, the established burial rites, in his trickery. 72 If it is correct that the 'escape through trickery' is the earliest version of the myth, it would be Thanatos' binding that was modelled on the reversal of Sisyphos' perpetual motion in Hades.</page><page sequence="18">54 BICS 33 (1986) As befits a trickster, Sisyphos was an ambivalent figure,73 and for that reason his persona as sinner in Hades was felt by later commentators to be inconsistent with the rest of his mythological personality;74 for such commentators neither shared in the mythological mentality that generated these stories nor were aware, as we are, of the ambivalence and ambiguity which characterize mythological figures - especially figures of the trickster type such as Sisyphos. Trickster tales in other cultures are moral examples reaffirming the rules of society by showing what happens when social prescriptions are not obeyed; at the same time they give expression to men's darkest desires and anti-social feelings. Thus in many different cultures trickster tales help define the society's boundaries and rules.75 The function of the Sisyphos myth is similar. It is Sisyphos the cunning trickster who, by attempting to escape death and blur the limits between life and death, explores the limits of human enterprise and cunning, and helps draw the proper boundaries. This activity requires excess of cunning and involves the breaking of rules which characterizes trickster figures also in other societies. In early Greek ideology the cosmic order includes a radical and irreconcileable separation between life and death, involving rules which must not be broken, and the threat to which constitutes a threat to the cosmos and to all order. Consequently, Sisyphos fails, and he ends up symbolically trapped between the two worlds. It is clear, then, that (like the other two sinners' stories) the Sisyphos myth pertains (also) to the articulation of the human limits, the boundaries of the human condition - and of appropriate behaviour: men must not overstep the limits. Consequently, all three sinners in Odyssey 1 1 are punished for crimes which constituted offences against the cosmic order which they had endangered, as well as personal offences against the gods who are its guarantors, and also offences against the social order which the cosmic order grounds. All three transgressions relate to, and help define, the limits of humanity, are shaped by, and stress, the notion that there are proper boundaries between men and gods which must be respected.76 It is in myth that the limits of the human condition and of proper behaviour and the exploration of its transgression are explored.77 Tityos, Tántalos and Sisyphos are punished in Hades because they threatened the division between men and gods and the gods' status, and tried to usurp divine prerogatives for men (themselves and others). In all three cases the form of the punishment reflects, and is shaped by, the nature of the offence. If the conclusions drawn above are correct, the three offences committed by the three 'sinners' refer to the three most important areas of human experience pertaining to the most basic characteristics and needs of humanity: food (Tántalos), sex (Tityos), death (Sisyphos). Men have to eat, copulate and reproduce themselves and they have to die. But these 'natural' areas - and the giving of death, killing - are governed by rules, ordered not only by natural 73 On the figure of the trickster: M. Douglas, Purity and Danger.

Some modern scholars expressed similar views: Rohde (n.l), 53 and n.82, and Büchner (n.l), 115, for example, take Sisyphos' positive traits to indicate that he was not seriously thought of as a criminal sinner. 75 On these characteristics of the trickster and aspects of trickster tales: Street (n.73), 85, 86, 90, 103-4. 76 On the notion of metron in connection with the limits of humanity in early Greek thought: Calarne Gig.

SOURVINOU-INWOOD 55 laws but also by cultural edicts, perceived as being grounded in the cosmic order.78 In so far as Sisyphos used cultural conventions pertaining to death, society's mediation of the natural phenomenon of death, as a means for tricking Hades, Sisyphos also offended against the cultural rules pertaining to death - and not only the natural ones pertaining to the cosmic order. Thus the three 'sinners' in Odyssey 1 1 illustrate the offences of forbidden sex, forbidden food, forbidden life;79 as - among other things - paradigms of these transgressions they help articulate the existence of, and the need to respect, the cultural rules governing men's relationship with the gods, life and death and each other. The punishments inflicted on the three 'sinners' involve the most severe afflictions plaguing human beings, other than death in whose domain the action is taking place: hunger and thirst; pain and inability to move - which can also be seen as metaphors for, images of, illness - and continuous strenuous physical effort and exhaustion. The relationship between the offences and the punishments is also shaped by, and expresses - through its potential for reversal - without articulating consciously, the human hope that if men (individuals and communities) respect the human limits and the cultural rules they may avert hunger and thirst, pain and disease and lighten their continuous toil. The order in which the three sinners are mentioned is, in my view, not arbitrary. For each represents different aspects of humanity - if we take the 'human' to be equivalent with 'mortal (anthropomorphic)' here - in a scale which is descending if it is considered from the point of view of the person's relationship to the divine, and ascending if considered from the point of view of where he stands along the axis savagery - civilization. Tityos who is mentioned first was a son of Gaia, monstrous in size and Giant-like.80 Like the Giants, Tityos is an ambiguous figure - though with the emphasis on the monstrous and excessive: on the one hand he is savage and misbehaves violently towards Leto, on the other he is visited by Rhadamanthys {Od. 7.323-4).81 Giants stand between men and gods,82 but they are mortals.83 Like the Giants, Tityos is mortal, and thus belongs to the same mortal category as men, in contrast to the immortal gods; but (again like the Giants) he is also monstrous, and thus opposed to the category men/gods which defines the (cultural) pole of civilization and metron.84 It is interesting to note that the transgression involving the most intimate contact with the gods and the most violent and personal offence against a deity is committed by the most monstrous being among the three. This is on the one hand correlative with the monstrosity of the offence, and on the other stresses more strongly, shockingly, the overstepping of the proper limits - here through physical violence.85 Tañíalos was a man, but also a son of Zeus; he represents the mythical generation of diogeneis heroes who had privileged access to the gods and who (like the Golden Age with which some of them at least are in some ways symbolically correlative) are, from the point of view of the cultural values of 'the present', of civilization, ambivalent. Sisyphos in the context of Odysseus' visit in which he appears was a 'normal' man with two 78 On food, sex and killing taboos: Vernant in Cuisine (n.22), 1 15. 79 The life that Sisyphos enjoyed after his death was forbidden life.

(n.5), 148. 85 On men's sexual contacts with gods cf. n.7 above.</page><page sequence="20">56 BICS 33 (1986) human parents.86 Thus, clearly, the three 'sinners' represent a systematic articulation of the 'human/mortal' sphere, which allows different refractions of the exploration of the human limits and their transgression. Correlative with these differences in the three 'sinners" nature is the mode of their transgression, which is dependent on the reasons why these men were capable of coming sufficiently closely to the gods to offend them personally as well as endanger the cosmic order. The reasons for this access vary according to the persona of each. The three myths together are also exploring, in a polarized form, refractions of modes of human behaviour and of potential transgressions of a comparable kind, pertaining to offences against other mortals as well as the gods and the cosmic order. Tityos was able to offend against Leto thanks to his monstrous size and strength which enabled him to use physical force against her. Tántalos found himself in a position to abuse the gods' trust because the gods chose to bestow their favours on him. Sisyphos was able to offend because of his cunning, a human characteristic which he possessed in a heightened degree, and which allowed him to trick the Underworld deities. This, incidentally, is an ambiguous statement about human cunning. The central message that man must know his limits and not overstep them, that he cannot avoid death, and that he must not offend the gods, is somewhat deconstructed - at least at the edges - by the fact that human cunning can trick the gods. This is itself deconstructed by the perception that even if individual deities are tricked, the cosmic order - guaranteed by the totality of deities operating as a system of 'government' - eventually reasserts itself.87 All three punishments involve the continuous repetition of an action that can never be finished. Not the endless repetition of a complete action, but the continuous performance of one unfinishable action. This is obvious in the case of Sisyphos; the same is true of Tántalos' attempts to eat and drink. Tityos' punishment is presented as 'fixed in time', a 'keyhole view' of his situation, like the frozen shot of a film. This image presents Tityos as he stood at any particular moment in time. But if we articulate that image sequentially - as Odyssey 1 1 does with Tántalos' and Sisyphos' punishment - Tityos' punishment analyses itself into one continuous action, the vultures are continuously devouring his liver, which entails that, as in the case of Prometheus, Tityos' liver kept regenerating itself,88 so that the vultures kept devouring it, and Tityos kept suffering forever. In other words, here also we have a cyclical action that will never end. The action is cyclical because, though it had a beginning at some point in time, once begun is does not stop. Any point in the course of the performance of the action leads to another until the original point is reached again. This expresses the notion that the punishment will never end, will last forever; in other words, the unfinishable cyclical action is a means of expressing in narrative terms the notion 'forever', the abstract concept of eternity. Finite time is made up of finite units that can be expressed through a series of finite actions.89 Infinite time, 86 On Sisyphos' genealogy and family connections cf. M. L. West, The Hesiodic Catalogue of Women. Its Nature, Structure and Origins (Oxford, 1985), 63-4, and the genealogical tables on pp. 173-6. 87 One scheme that may underlie, and may have helped to structure, the nexus of the three 'sinners' (cf. also Calarne Gig. (n.5), 168) is some variation on the myth of the races comparable to, but not the same as, that presented to Hesiod in WD 106-201 (on which see M. L. West ed., Hesiod, Works and Days (Oxford, 1978), ad loc. (pp. 172-204)). One of the reasons for the differences must be because the 'present' viewpoint is different in the two cases: Hesiod's is that of his own day while the Odyssey's is that of the generation of the Trojan War, which is Hesiod's last but one race. The giant Tityos is equivalent to the race of bronze who, like him, had great strength and behaved in a violent and hybristic manner. Tántalos belongs symbolically (at least partly) to an ambivalent Golden Age - though not to Hesiod's golden race who lived in the age of Kronos; Sisyphos resembles the men of Hesiod's 'present': he shares with them not only his normal human ancestry, but, most strikingly, the constant toil which characterizes both the Iron Race (WD 174 ff) and Sisyphos in Hades. 88 Cf. also Feiten (n. 1 ), 35. 89 See, for instance, C. R. Hallpike, The Foundations of Primitive Thought (Oxford, 1979), 348, for the fact that 'primitive' time is frequently reckoned in terms of activities, such as a journey or cooking. (On 'primitive'</page><page sequence="21">C. SOURVINOU-INWOOD 57 eternity, can, of course, be expressed through an infinite number of finite actions, but this does not solve the problem of how to express 'infinite' in narrative terms. Thus, the mythological imagination has here transformed the model for finite time in a different way in order to express the notion of eternity: it expresses it through one action that cannot be finished, but has to be continuously attempted, in which the normal time-rhythm is totally disrupted in a cyclical and therefore endless action placed in cyclical endless time. All three punishments are structured according to this pattern; Tityos' involves the endless infliction of pain, Tántalos' the endless (frustrated) attempt to relieve a physical need which causes suffering, Sisyphos' the endless performance of a wearing physical task. Because his task is unfinishable, Sisyphos' activity belongs to the category of futile toil, and the futility of his toil is one dimension of the punishment.90 This image of futile toil was a potent one, especially when we consider that Sisyphos' endless labouring is itself a polarized, intensified, image of man's continuous and unending labour to produce food and to survive, as presented, for example, in Hes. WD 176-7. This probably caused the myth of Sisyphos' punishment to inspire, and serve as a model for, the generation91 of new post-mortem punishments involving frustrated toil, such as that of Oknos and the water-carriers.92 Because the most striking and potent element of the frustrated toil myths is the 'frustration' itself, the futility of the toil, it has often been (implicitly or explicitly) assumed that this 'futility-as-punishment' aspect is the primary element in the myths, their original nucleus and centre. However, since in Homer all three punishments involve the endless repetition of unfinishable actions of which only one involves futile toil, that assumption must be wrong. It is clearly the structuring schema 'unfinishable action', common to all three, that is primary, and expresses, is a (vivid) narrative articulation of, the notion 'for ever', eternity.93 Myths of transgression help define the normative. The eternal punishments of Tityos, Tántalos and Sisyphos in Odyssey 1 1 help define the human limits and stress the boundaries between men and gods. In articulating this central 'message' they also express, and are shaped by, other collective representations, such as the fear and horror of hunger and thirst and of notions of time see Hallpike, 340-83; D. F. Pocock, The anthropology of time-reckoning', in J. Middleton ed., Myth and Cosmos. Readings in Mythology and Symbolism (New York, 1967), 303-14; P. Bohannan, 'Concepts of time among the Tiv of Nigeria', in Myth and Cosmos , 315-29.) Even in the recent past Greek peasants often answered the question 'How long will it take me to reach point A from here?' with the information 'Three cigarettes' time'. 90 On the myths of futile/frustrated toil see Keuls (n.l), passim ; Feiten (n.l), 24-45; Radermacher (n.l), 541-7.

Paus. 10.29.3; cf. above n.l9) represents a different version of the Tityos myth, governed by linear time: Tityos is no longer being punished, having been reduced to an indistinct eidolon by the torture. That is, here his punishment was not eternal, but presented within the time-cycle. Polygnotos' perception of Hades and post-mortem punishment was different from Homer's; this depends on the fact that the funerary ideology and attitudes of which that perception was part was significantly different from those reflected in the Homeric poems.</page><page sequence="22">58 BICS 33 ( 1986) disease; the unpleasantness of continuous toil; the need to preserve order and respect the cultural norms that sustain it and to ward off disorder and savagery - here represented by the polarized image of cannibalism; finally, one of the representations expressed in these myths (part of the cosmic order and a fundamental characteristic separating men from gods) is that death cannot be avoided. The richness and potency of these myths is shown by the fact that Sisyphos became, in Camus' reinterpretation,94 a vehicle for the expression of the preoccupations of an important intellectual strand of the mid-twentieth century, and an image of great significance for our own times. 94 A.
