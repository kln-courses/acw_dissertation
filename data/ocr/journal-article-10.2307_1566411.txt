<plain_text><page sequence="1">POETRY IN THEORY BOB PERELMAN Home Movies When my wife and I went to Guatemala in 1975 for our honeymoon, our eyes were opened to novel states of affairs. Money, for instance, was not continuous, but was kept in place only sporadically and with the broadest hints of violence. In Guatemala City, sixteen- year-old Mayan kids in army camouflage with submachine guns were stationed on every street corner where there was a bank. But the local remained thoroughly distant from any would-be universal. An elderly middle-aged Mayan man at a market outside the capital balked rather indignantly when I gave him a paper bill to pay for the chair we had agreed I would buy; the woman at the stand next to him urged him to accept the money saying. "Se sirve! Se sirve!" (It-paper money-works! It works!) Nor was geography continuous. Knowledge of the country was both guarded and somewhat fantastic. It was impossible to obtain a map of the interior (guerrilla trouble). We spent one long afternoon negotiating our way into a bureaucratic building where, after signing our names in a notebook, we were allowed a glimpse at some antique maps that, in my memory at least, verged on watercolors. We hooked up with a Chinese archeologist from Iowa State who directed us to Sayache, which we reached after a six-hour busride and a trip across the Uxamachinto River in a mahogany dugout. There was one hotel in town, owned by a man who was also mayor, judge, and, clearly, king. He joined us for dinner. In the dining room we saw an old map that showed Guatemala with a large bulge stretching northeast to the Gulf of Mexico. The longlasting territorial dispute between Guatemala and Britain that resulted in the creation of British Honduras, which then became Belize, had been finally resolved, at least on this framed print which showed Belize as fully dissolved into Guatemala. When I asked the mayor about the map he replied that Belize belonged to Guatemala, had always been part of Guatemala. In response to some tentative question of mine about negotiation or tactics, he said of Belize, pounding his fist on the table, "Tomalo!" (Take it!) Alien, Point-Blank, Green, and Actual The vagaries of mapping and the intermittent condition of value that these old home movies demonstrate strike me as suggestive for figuring the relations between poetry to its institutional or generic neighbors, theory and literary criticism. In a larger and more theoretically committed piece I would want to specify the different discursive regimes with some precision, but here I will use "theory" as a shorthand for everything that goes on in literature departments, even though this shortcircuits the large conflicts currently raging about the nature of the profession; "poetry," in this same shorthand, should therefore equal what gets taught and reproduced in creative writing departments and writing workshops, though ultimately I will be proposing a differently oriented writing as what I want for poetry. But for now the words on the map will be "poetry" and "theory"--even if they also flood me with defensiveness and apathy, especially when it comes to theory. "Theory"? Postcolonial studies? Marxism? Queer theory? Deconstruction? Cultural studies? Film studies? It feels as if I were to introduce a specialist in gender in 158 diacritics 26.3-4: 158-75</page><page sequence="2">eighteenth-century German theater as someone working with "words." The desire to make discursive sentences wanders off... But one negative specific comes quickly to mind. I do not intend a binding allegory in which some primitive or pristine "Guatemala" stands for "poetry"-quite the contrary. There are, unfortunately in my view, many such constructions in which poetry is one or another brand of elemental exoticism. Poetry as a natural, irrational, sensuous, intuitive, musical, sonic bastion is an idea that is still widely diffused. One well-known example, which forced itself to mind as soon as I thought of those Guatemalan scenes, occurs in Wallace Stevens's "Arrival at the Waldorf," which ends by invoking an "alien, point- blank, green, and actual Guatemala." Of course, it is a complex poem and as I read it, checking the context of the remembered line, my sense of the signification of this use of "Guatemala" wobbles. On the ground in one of Stevens's poems, so to speak, the oppositions turn out to be slippery and sly. Or, more accurately, the opposition of Waldorf and Guatemala is brightly obvious, but the vantage assumed toward these opposed locales by the statements and tonalities of the poem is mutable, and the more minutely one reads the greater the mutability. In refutation of the critic (myself, often) who would figure Stevens as the Great White Insurer (however hemmed round by and riddled with quasi-sensuous, aesthetic longing for the Floridean, Venereal Other), one could note how difficult is his identifica- tion with the cosmopolitan world. The opening line sets up the opposition in a seemingly immutable way by ending the line with a period: "Home from Guatemala, back at the Waldorf." End of story. But the next line reverses things, with the Waldorf now occupying the pole of wilderness: "This arrival in the wild country of the soul." But then again this reversal is not all that thorough when one realizes that the soul's wilderness arises not from nature but from the perplexing conditions at the hotel where ironic versions of wilderness seem to be continually proposed and withdrawn. If the Waldorf is a wilderness, it is a vantage from which jaded affirmations issue: "the wild poem is a substitute / For the woman one loves or ought to love" and both poem and courtship are ersatz commodities: "One wild rhapsody a fake for another." Contact and immediacy are invoked casually, as if they were givens, "You touch the hotel the way you touch moonlight / . . . you hum and the orchestra / Hums.. ." but the result is vacuum and displacement: the "you" touching and humming along immediately pronounces an oblique and rather bitter commentary on the obliquity of the hotel, "'The world in a verse, // A generation sealed, men remoter than mountains, / Women invisible in music .. ."' This sad assertion of remoteness then leads to the punchline: "After that alien, point-blank, green, and actual Guatemala," with the "after" casting an Edenic pathos over the lost sensuous immediacy. Having gotten back to this initial negative touchstone, it seems glib to say that Stevens is equating "poetry" with "Guatemala." Isn't the "poetry" of "Arrival at the Waldorf' precisely-how instantaneously this Faustian adverb falls to the fingers!-precisely the difficult play between the overly self-conscious hall of mirrors that one encounters in civilization and the raw actuality of the material world? Wouldn't a responsible reading of the multiplicious gestures of the poem have to agree? But let' s face it, this is a poem for the Waldorf, not Guatemala, and the Stevensian faux-rhodomontade using simple elements to display difficulty is a one-way mirror. "That alien, point-blank, green, and actual Guatemala" is a, or I should say the, typical Stevens gesture: "The palm at the end of the mind." It could be called either an idealist affirmation of matter; or the self-hatred of nuanced poem; or one could say that Stevens's work is a colonialist recuperation of the unspoiled adjectival for cosmopolitan poetic delectation. It's a charming, powerful, and ultimately manqu6 gesture-socially, not poetically, manqu6. That the "actual" is "alien" is a comforting truth for customers at the Waldorf; the green of Guatemala can be invoked and kept exotic in a single vivid denouement. And diacritics / fall-winter 1996 159</page><page sequence="3">there is surely an erotic undercurrent at the end: instead of Jeanette MacDonald humming away in the hotel moonlight, fingers lightly brushing the tablecloth, how about a savage rendezvous with Guatemala? Let Nicole Brossard, not writing about this poem in the slightest, conclude the discussion of it with a mix of material reference, poetic phrasing, and the useful theory-word: "There is always a hotel in my life to make me understand patriarchy. I have to describe them all in order to understand the most banal entrance hall, the tiniest maid's room, the rented room. Laudatory flow of four stars in the bosom of the night" [24]. Diplomatic Communiques The two stances toward "Arrival at the Waldorf," the first granting it an autonomous, complex particularity and the second lumping it in with all manner of colonizing moments, exemplify the distances between poetry and theory. In the Aristotelian remark poetry may have been more philosophical (theoretical) than history because more general and imaginative; but now the valence is reversed: American poetry, both conservative and experimental, is consigned to a lesser rank due to its particularity, individuality, idiosyn- crasy. Over the past few years, I have been in the academy as poet, also publishing critical books, driven by ambitions to range across generic and institutional arenas. Ultimately, it's all for the glory of poetry, which will remain ornamental to the degree that it avoids the issues of power, history, bureaucracy, and class that theory addresses. But theory also is in need of the particularity and the sonic and rhetorical resources of poetry if its powerful but jargon-heavy insights are to travel effectively outside the circuits of conferences and graduate seminars. How this conjuncture-marriage? merger? war?-between poetry and theory is to take place is ultimately a question of circulation, audience, social rhetoric. So while I may publish "The Marginalization of Poetry," a poem in six-word couplets that discusses these issues along with margins and typography, both in a book of poems and as a chapter in a critical book, will this gesture toward intellectual currency actually circulate between the genres? Or is it akin to the phantasmatic map on the mayor's wall in Sayache, perhaps accompanied by a local fist on a local table? But while reception is crucial in determining these issues, they also take place on the page and are legible there. The writing of theory has developed its own protocols, rhetoric, traditions. Of course, the writing of individuals varies, but in general the level of reference loaded onto each word is, to a nontheorist, striking. And often it seems that such a deferral contains a utopian or fetishistic gesture toward some work of art, as a kind of other. I'll look briefly and schematically at three examples. In a response to Derrida's Specters ofMarx Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak introduces a description of "the feminization of labor" as a "taxonomy of the coded discursive management of the new socialization of the reproductive body: (1) reproductive rights (metonymic substitution of the abstract average subject of rights for woman's identity); (2) surrogacy (metaphoric substitution of abstract average reproductive labor power as fulfilled female subject of motherhood .. ." This is an extreme example, a "shorthand" as Spivak herself calls it that was "formalize[d] in the classroom" and offered "in the hope that Marxist-feminists active in global economic resistance will be able to reproduce the analysis" [67]. But other moments are equally involved in a web of reference, to the point where her writing presents little more than an index to an extensive range of other reading: "The reading of Hamlet-the visor-effect of history as the face of the ghostly father (an entire Derrida-LAvinasian cluster there), the irreducible 'out-of-joint'-ness of time, the rehearsal of justice as relation to the other, and, above all, the peculiar predications of ghostliness-is perhaps the best part of the book" [66]. 160</page><page sequence="4">For nonspecialists, such writing does not reproduce much on the page. One could discern a distant echo of the poetic in the invocation of the axes of metaphor and metonymy, which for Jakobson at least, are where poetry is born; but writing here is highly citational. It is diffused and systematic, as opposed to the compression and torsion that poetry brings to the present moment of reading. However, the trajectory of the article does lead toward a site or moment of authorial presence. The Gordian knots of history that entangle and obscure woman are almost, in Spivak' s representation, cut by Assia Djebar' s Far from Medina: "If only one could cathect that single spectator body that remains, encircle it more and more tightly in order to forget the defeat!" [78]. Reciprocal to that unified body is the single voice, which is to clarify and transform the conditions of history: "What Muslim woman of this city or elsewhere will perpetuate that inflamed eloquence which burned us, which held us in a state of heightened consciousness?" But of course since history has not been clarified, the eloquence is banked and these gestures are bracketed: Djebar's text continues, "No, I shall not take up the chain, I am not a woman of words"; and Spivak surrounds her own use of Djebar with analytic elements of conditionality: Djebar' s figures are a ghost dance, her wishes are in the future perfect, and she is, according to Spivak, not "an auteurist author" [82]. In "Shibboleth" Jacques Derrida places a similar utopian parenthesis around the figure of the poet. At times the parenthesis expands to include Derrida's own writing, as in the following passage, which while lecturing us on the proper way to read Celan, also erases the boundary between his poetry and the words of the lecture: "It makes no sense, as you may well suppose, to dissociate in Celan' s writings those on the subject of the date, which name the theme of the date, from the poetic traces of dating; to rely on the division between a theoretical, philosophical, hermeneutic, or even technopoetic discourse con- cerning the phenomenon of the date, on the one hand, and its poetic implementation, on the other, is no longer to read him" [6-7]. Such gestures are something of an underlayer, though; for the most part the specificity of Celan's poetry is hypothesized into impossi- bility. The poem is individuated into nothingness: "Singularity but also solitude: the only one, the poem is alone. ... This radical ad absurdum, the impossibility of which, each time once alone, has meaning only on the condition of having no meaning, no ideal or general meaning, or which has meaning only so as to invoke, in order to betray it, the concept, law, or genre, is the pure poem" [8, 13]. "Shibboleth" is a tortuous meditation, of course, and Derrida assembles a complex set of themes-circumcision, dates, passwords, ash-around Celan's work and ulti- mately around the Holocaust. The marking of presence in time, the date and the poem as specific utterance in time, is ultimately kept out of our grasp by the strenuous echoes of Derrida' s prose. Fredric Jameson' s writing, in contrast, provides a provisional knowledge sentence after sentence. Ultimately, however, the status of the individual work of art is also bracketed. The following rehearsal of Jameson's notion of cognitive mapping presents knowledge and art as mutually exclusive alternatives. Cognitive mapping "presupposes a radical incompatibility between the possibilities of an older national language or culture (which is still the framework in which literature is being produced today) and the transnational, worldwide organization of the economic infrastructure of contemporary capitalism. .... The result of this contradiction ... [is that] the truth of our social life..,. is increasingly irreconcilable with the possibilities of aesthetic expression available." The situation is chiastic: "If we make a work of art from our experience... then it is no longer true, even as individual experience; and if we can grasp the truth about our world as a totality, then we may find it some purely conceptual expression but we will no longer be able to maintain an imaginative relationship to it." Readers familiar with Jameson's work will not be surprised by the subsequent motion of the next sentences, where the work of art is given a radically split treatment. It is utopian in the prospective view: it is "a matter of more than intellectual curiosity to interrogate the diacritics / fall-winter 1996 161</page><page sequence="5">artistic production of our own time for signs of some new, so far only dimly conceivable, collective forms ... to replace the older individualistic ones (those either of conventional realism or of a now conventionalized modernism)"; but in the particular moment of the writing, it is deeply contingent: "it is also the perspective in which an indecisive aesthetic object and cultural phenomenon like Dog DayAfternoon takes on the values of a revealing symptom" ["Class and Allegory" 54]. Recently, Jameson has shown more nuance toward and less mastery over the artwork, insisting that a commitment to a totalizing method does not lead to "what has been thought as Hegel's 'master narrative"'; rather it commits one "with a desperate lack of perspective, to the local work at hand" ["Italy" 162]. The local artwork does not, however, attain the stability of a bearer of knowledge. In the passage which the last sentence concludes, it avoids the lowly status of mere symptom, but it takes on the more complex, almost monstrous characteristics of unresolved history. The particular context is film studies; as wider and wider frames are applied, they "show up... the shabby idealistic pretenses of an older intrinsic criticism: details that had been read as features of an aesthetic intention ... now prove to have been 'merely' what was required technically." That such technical necessities had been so misread now "strikes us as pitiful and humiliating." It is almost as if Jameson wants to call the art/theory marriage off: "chastened, interpretation packs its bags and vows to have nothing more to do with Janus-faced objects of this kind, which, approached as works of art, suddenly turn into machinery before your very eyes, and can best be abandoned to some second shift of engineering historians, who take the seats vacated by the aesthetes. Unfortunately, all cultural objects are ultimately dual in this sense: nor is the engineers' ... decipherment in any way an adequate substitute for interpretation, since it is not exactly reading at all, but something closer to symptomatology" [178-79]. Writing, Natural and Unnatural While theorists place works of art within varieties of parenthesis, poets across a surprisingly wide range often grant poetry the status of unmediated wilderness. For example: A. Poetry becomes an accelerated version of evolution itself, of that miraculous feedback among variation, selection, and heredity which produced the orchid, the sperm whale, the tobacco mosaic virus, the giant panda, the coral reef. B. To my mind writing has to do with uncovering possibilities rather than with codification. My key words would be exploring and maintaining: exploring a forest not for the timber that might be sold, but to understand it as a world and to keep this world alive. C. In a time of ecological catastrophe like ours, we say that wilderness areas must not only be preserved but also expanded.... The effect these wilderness areas have is not measurable by audience but in terms of the regeneration of the earth that benefits all of us who live on it .... I've never been to Alaska but it makes a difference to me that it's there. Poets don't have to be read, any more than trees have to be sat under, to transform poisonous societal emissions into something that can be breathed. I've set these examples up to look vaguely similar when in fact they come from widely separated areas of any poetic map. A moderately careful reader could determine that the first example claims a grandiose immediacy with nature in ways that the other two don't. 162</page><page sequence="6">And thus it might not be at all a surprise that the first was by Frederick Turner [21], a spokesman for the New Formalists who would go on to assert that meter is a neurological imperative. It is a profoundly reactionary, ahistorical demand and I won't spend more time on it. On the other hand, Rosmarie Waldrop and Charles Bernstein, the authors of the next two quotes, are quite conversant with theory and are committed to a writing in which genre, style, and syntax are queried in attempts to articulate the historical dynamics which surround and constitute the writing itself. Their work often obliterates any easy perception of a boundary between poetry and theory. But the residual trope of poetry as nature, even in work that may be highly inflected by theory, is ubiquitous. Here are the titles of a range of essays and books from the sixties to the present: "Hunting is Not Those Heads on the Wall" (Amiri Baraka); "Cultivate Your Own Wilderness" (Nick Piombino); "Some Notes on Organic Form" (Denise Levertov); The Forest (Susan Stewart); The Birth-mark: Unsettling the Wilderness in American Literary History (Susan Howe). Now none of these writers can be accused of, or complimented on, singing wood-notes wild; they are all politically and critically engaged, some to a very high degree. And a poetry that insists on immediate contact with nature will not escape a cultural positioning. For example, consider Gary Snyder's "What You Should Know to Be a Poet," which begins, all you can about animals as persons. the names of trees and flowers and weeds. names of stars, and the movements of the planets and the moon your own six senses, with a watchful and elegant mind. at least one kind of traditional magic: divination, astrology, the book of changes, the tarot; dreams. The poem is crisply efficient in laying out the elements and ethics of the counterculture of the sixties. The book the poet needs to study is the natural world, enlarged by shamanism to include the supernatural ("the illusory shining gods; / / kiss the ass of the devil and eat shit; / ... fuck the hag, / and all the celestial angels / and maidens perfumed and golden"). The would-be poet is then enjoined to "love the human," pay attention to "children's games, comic books, bubble gum, / the weirdness of television and advertis- ing"; accept and finally love "long dry hours of dull work" which, in the narrative of the poem, leads to the large perspective at the end: "the wild freedom of the dance, extasy / silent solitary illumination, enstasy II real danger. gambles. and the edge of death." Ignoring the masculinist condescension, I may agree with some of the opinions expressed. The American populace could use more information about the world, and the stoicism of the Zen stance can be valuable; nevertheless I find this poem, as a social representative of poetry, quite a problem. Perhaps some of my difficulties stem from the title. Would this be easier to take if it were called "WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW"? For a poem that wants to impart knowledge about the world as a whole, there are two main blank spots, both of them theoretical. "To be a poet" you apparently don't need to know anything about poems or poetics, and you don't need to know anything about theory. Except for the quite modest tip of the hat to the contemporary-bubble-gum, weirdness of television-this poem seems constituted by an ahistorical, antitheoretical stance: the know-nothing armchair bureaucrat, dilettante, intellectual, the theorist who has never bucked hay is the target of the poem's lecture. diacritics / fall-winter 1996 163</page><page sequence="7">164</page><page sequence="8">diacritics / fall-winter 1996 165</page><page sequence="9">As one counter to the calm, ponderous solidity of this logocentric stance, here is a passage from Lisa Robertson's Xeclogue. Nature has become a sexy, theoretical stage set: "We invented power. Power is a pink prosthesis in the forest. Between black pines we strap it on and dip our pink prosthesis in the pool. The plastic glitters with clips and buckles beneath the surface of the pool. Breasts are a buttoned wedge held by buckled straps. Freedom is this extra size. We display it to the creaking forest. Also ride horses between our giant new limbs. Our pink bodies are giant and they own us for playing. The glittering giantesses are playing in the dark." Imagine a poetry that is not necessarily contra naturam in some jejune transgressive sense, but one that does not take "nature" as an order to which poetry has privileged access. No special effects attributed to form; no organicism; no shamanism; no intuitive well of sonic richness. No impossibly present shibboleths preventing migration between the reader's presence at the page and the long dialectic tangles of history. Such poetry would be part of history taking place on the page, transforming the logos into a multicolored prosthesis and the prosthesis back into a word that has present legibility. A host of objections, tangles, that-is-not-what-I-meant-at-alls springs up at this point. Such poetry would not be a zero degree writing, if that is understood to be a pure writing. It would not be poetry by virtue of some literary essence to be found in language, literaturnost.' Like all other uses of language, it would be intricately involved in the battles between individual and group attention spans and the larger processes of history. It is not an alliance with or surrender to daily speech that I am advocating-the rather sad lowness of much contemporary conversational verse is not what I want; nor the escape from accusations of elitism. Rather, it's the abolition of the boundary line between poetry and theory. I realize that such a desire is quite possibly nothing but contradictions disguised as wishes. I could be simply pounding on the table saying, "The two are one!" And then there are further questions: why would poetry want to annex theory? There are the countless examples of its boilerplate, the aporias, the always-alreadys, the inscriptions on the bodies, etc. And is it theory that is the target and not the more usual goal of having some say in the literary history arena that after all will be the immediate judge and circulator of the poetry? Exhibit A Exhibit A is the opening poem of chapter 8 of my Marginalization of Poetry: Language Writing and Literary History. The chapter is entitled "An Alphabet of Literary History." Here, in public so to speak, I need to ask the production editor of Diacritics to forgo the magazine's usual practice of printing extracts in italics. The reason will I hope be obvious. A I will not attempt to determine the exact import of the promise 1. Barrett Watten defines the Russian Formalist notion of literaturnost as "the nature of literary fact. " His comment that "The devices used to construct a work are identical to that which separates it from the practical world" [8] points in exactly the opposite direction from my imaginary construct. 166</page><page sequence="10">that an Author in the present historical moment, publishing in a critical format, makes to the Reader; but I am certain it will appear to many that I am not fulfilling the terms of an engagement thus voluntarily contracted. They who have been accustomed to the gaudiness and inane phraseology of many modem critics, if they persist in reading this chapter to its conclusion, will, doubtless, frequently receive impressions of a naive verbal positivism: as if the act of writing could always keep its words particular. Those expecting reference to uniform discursive terms will be induced to inquire, by what species of courtesy these attempts can be permitted to assume the title of literary history, theory, or even of poetry. The above poem, as I hope will be easily recognizable, is prose from Wordsworth's "Preface to the Second Edition of Lyrical Ballads." To print this prose in italics would be to exoticize it, to make it green and alien, as opposed to the Roman imperial bureaucratized critical theory which the pages of Diacritics are made to serve with their narrow leading and modest margins. But printing these words in a standard typeface is far from striking a single, plain- sounding note. The poem sounds a fairly complex chord, not without dissonances. On the positive, or consonant, side, I intend to echo some of Wordsworth's gestures I find admirable and useful. The Lyrical Ballads is one of the first avant-garde works in English, and, to compress its highly complex class rhetoric into a generalization, it is committed to democratic language. The poem also supports Wordsworth's affirmation, in the preface, of the ultimate identity of prose and poetry: "there neither is, nor can be, any essential difference between the language of prose and metrical composition" [451]- although he later backs away from this, ascribing to meter a complex fort-da function regulating pleasure and pain, presence and absence. The "A is for Author" gesture I make by calling the chapter "an Alphabet" and using the large letters is meant to affirm a continuity between the pedagogical formation of the individual reader and the narratives of literary history. Those early alphabet books were, as I remember them, a pleasure. So: pleasure, learning to read, a democratic avant-garde, writing as a utopia where genres are no longer mutually hostile havens of class and gender. But this is to ignore the manifest contradictions of the poem. While its form may have a utopian front, it continues the campaign of resentment poets have been waging for centuries against critics (also read diacritics / fall-winter 1996 167</page><page sequence="11">"theorists") with their "gaudy and inane phraseology." But the phraseology is also an established "terminology," a mechanism of bureaucratic and epistemological power that the poet, having only radically particular words, is excluded from. If each stone is special, you can't build much in the way of a public structure. This anxiety makes the poem call itself "naive." It ends by doubting its power to proclaim literary history, dubious about the possibilities of its dissonances being in any sense "theory," and finally unsure of its own existence as a poem. Exhibit B The next letter-poem displays more confidence about its ability to stage knowledge, though note how the figure of Hegel looms as a real-enough bogy. I will only quote the first part. An "orrery" is an eighteenth-century physical representation of the solar system. I suppose the heliocentric replacement of the terracentric view is equivalent, in some stretched sense, to my asking poets to place nature in history rather than history in nature. A "theoretical" perspective, though note my constitutive anxiety about theory shows up in the seems/semes pun. The rhapsode as seamster underlies both words. The bovine iambs in the latter part of the passage are taken from a description of improvements in slaughterhouse techniques. B The concepts are surprisingly portable. What look at first like Boulders marking the genres, movable only by large groups in concert, break upon reading and writing into words, quick gatherings of air, the slightest social masses: these never appear in the literary orreries. Semes? I know not semes. I ply my needle, ply over ply. As you word each line, reader, and examine the lineaments of the phrases, feel as well the body reading, its present weather. I am mad for it to be in contact with us. But we'd better skip the finer points or we won't get a spot to watch the march of literature, 168</page><page sequence="12">a.k.a. the triumph of criticism. We've missed the first floats already-Look! the flowers seem so fresh. It must be because they're kept in past tense. Little John Milton sat in the center and sang to the center things never before attempted in prose or rhyme. He stuck in his morally oblique body, and pulled out an unchangeable ethics, which, unfortunately, needed gendered guywires to remain vertical. These thrummed in the wind. Their lengths were unequal: that's how iambs were born. They were led to meaning in mechanized rituals; but with the invention first of decorum, then of style, and finally of nature, the slaughter became more humane. They felt as little as possible, mooing and swishing their tails as they followed one another up the curving ramps to the moment of literary history. Ask your Mama. On the next float, Goodman Bob found himself in the forest, where an unholy host, possibly post-marxian, of syntactic displacements was boring the heck out of the (mono)culture, the zeitgeist, Hegel himself. ... Exhibit C This one is vulgar. But the vulgarities, "documentary" elements from real life, consis- tently have aligned themselves with the appeals to nature that I have been critiquing. For syntax to have an effect in contemporary gender wars, it will need the support of both theory and poetry. diacritics / fall-winter 1996 169</page><page sequence="13">FAKE DREAMS January 28: We were going to have sex in the stacks. We were in the 800's, standing eagerly amid the old copies of the Romantics. Looking at the thick dark blue spine of Wordsworth's Collected, I thought how the strength of his need to fully express his unplaced social being in sentences had produced publicly verifiable beauty so that his subsequent civic requirements seemed to have depth enough for him to become Poet Laureate and how his later leaden writing upheld that intensity and verifiability, only instead of searching wind and rocks and retina for the sentences of his social being, he chirped his confirmed lofty perch to other social beings in lengthy claustrophobic hallelujahs for the present second. There are devices for holding it still, long enough, and he had learned them. Rhyme was a burden, crime was unambiguously, explanably wrong, time had snuck around behind him. He had carved his own anxiety into a throne and now he was stuck on it, constantly remembering sadder days when he had wanted to be happy with a purity that made him blink, thinking about it from his frozen vantage. He couldn't bear to look at his past: he thought of it as unbearably happy. 170</page><page sequence="14">Our own more slippery, contrapuntal hallelujahs were planted in the immediate future, only a few buttons, zippers and a little elastic down the road. We had first snuck into the men's room but it had been crowded with two intensely separate urinators. As we turned to hurry out, you pointed at some of the big magic marker graffiti on the beige tiles: "This place needs a women's touch" answered by "FINGER MY ASSHOLE, CUNT!" which then had been modified by an arrow indicating that "CUNT" was to be moved in front of "ASSHOLE": "FINGER MY CUNT, ASSHOLE!" We were eager to to prove syntax was not mere vanity and that bodies could use it to resist the tyranny of elemental words. And wouldn't it be nice to get knowledge and pleasure on the same page. So we'd hurried out to the deserted 800's. Exhibit D The following, from the "Movie" section of Captive Audience, has been read by David Lehman in Signs of the Time as savaging the bogy-theorist Derrida. But I would hope in fact that the debt my theatricalization of presence owes to Derrida will be legible. The "freeze-dried prose" that accuses theory of antihumanist Leninism is meant to register my own accusation of the USA Today Reaganite perspective that, in the eighties, demonized Nicaragua for fighting for self-determination. While self-determination is always an undecidable issue, constituted by the mortal play between the terminable and the interminable, intrinsic and extinsic, it is also a necessary provisional task for writers. anthropomorphic, I know what happened next: Cary Grant walked out of his house, the movie was in color, a glorious day, diacritics / fall-winter 1996 171</page><page sequence="15">yellow sun pouring in under the out of focus green leaves.

Down the street, a firecracker went off inside a garbage can. It was the Fourth of July, garbage day, and July 14, 1987, all rolled into one swaggering twinkle, the copyright of an eye that looked out over its entire life with a happy willingness to be filmed, truly, anthropomorphically, at home. Everyone in the theater knows the plot from here: Cary Grant was married to Katherine Hepburn, a woman who thought Derrida was an idiot and repulsed his obscure advances whenever he came on the screen. But behind Grant's face and its European-savage-tamed-by-American- money smile (movies elongate the eternal sensual present of all adjectives) lay a nasty mortgage as big and secret as the reversed letters in Freud's middle name. So Grant had to in fact rent Derrida a room in his own home, which, however, Derrida actually owned, and thus it was Derrida's, not Grant's, bathtub that Hepburn reposed offcamera in (don't even think of looking there), talking about removing ticks from dogs and recipes for making flan. And it was Derrida, shockingly enough, whose arm reached in when she asked for a towel. If Grant tried to calm her down and talk to Derrida about leaving, Derrida would merely suggest that he read them the book he was working on, which the audience knew from bitter experience if not birth, they'd paid five bucks for a short escape from the taste of it, 172</page><page sequence="16">the book was really nothing but the unbreakable mortgage which would have them out on the street clothed but cloned, cold and improperly sexed in the dark. Brows knit, Grant was forced to come up with a plan: he went to work, which in his case meant buying a newspaper-the corporation, not the physical instance-and struggling against appearances (at this point the movie loses all touch with its conventions). At the office there's a beautiful secretary, but she's so rightwing she always thinks she's playing football. Grant is tempted (he's always tempted, and yields instantly, that's his charm but also what got him into trouble with Derrida). And soon we see him crouching down like a quarterback behind the secretary with his hands patient and puritanical under her bottom as she's spread in a three-point stance. This is the troubled part, but apparently for many husbands in shoulderpads who only stand and wait, it vibrates a lot of contradictions at once. Another deeper rationale is that in this posture they represent enough desire for one, shared between two, subject and object, proving that in a world of scarcity where repression is overabundant the value of internal restraint becomes incalculable, while attending to neurological sensation becomes more and more an anachronous luxury. A nation is a person (and if an utterly clothed Cary Grant doesn't convince you of this all by himself, then walk naked into the socialist future with your body the only badge of realism), and a nation never dies, except in the past diacritics / fall-winter 1996 173</page><page sequence="17">or by accident, though sometimes its processes of reproduction aren't all that pretty. So she snaps the ball to Grant who, though he loves his wife, has to take it, because inside it are four-color pictures packed in freeze-dried prose that prove Derrida's summer home is in fact a gulag in Nicaragua, with lines of people waiting for buses, for sugar, for paper. That night, when Grant comes home with the ball under his arm the smile on his face means the climax has begun. Derrida, who senses the storm brewing, takes out his manuscript and starts to speak. But now, thanks to Grant's sexualized, oppressive and glamorous hard work at the office, rather than being out in the cold, Grant and Hepburn rise knowingly and retire to the bedroom offcamera, to the accompaniment of Derrida's droning nuptials. The movie has scarcely ended and already I can hear the cries of "Focus!" The viewers have to face something the movie doesn't: continuity after the end. Nicaragua is still hanging by sensate threads. And if presidents still have charisma, it means that the viewers have been on hold so long they they've started to, if not live there, then camp out, sleep in cars, or under mortgages inconstant as clouds. It's like theorists opening three books at once and writing "vertiginous" somewhere near the end of the introductory paragraph. By now, one day after Bastille Day, young turks under erasure will always already have sprung up to the cry of "Gentlemen, start proclaiming the due date of the master narrative in your sepulchral verbs." Meanwhile, inside the Bastille itself, specially re-erected for the occasion by his own 174</page><page sequence="18">Herculean labors, C6line passes by his phantasm and has it say, "I am the Jew," which of course lets him reply, "I am C6line." In a gap that seems to have lasted two thousand years but really only began around 1848, they stare, frozen into a horrific equality, though the royalties, humiliatingly tiny as they are, still only flow toward the one with the proper name. ...
