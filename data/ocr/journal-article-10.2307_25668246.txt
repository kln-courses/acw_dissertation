<plain_text><page sequence="1">DANIEL A. DOMBROWSKI Discussion Note: Does God Have a Body? Richard Swinburne gives two different responses to this question, responses which appear, at times, in conflict. The purpose of this article is to defend one of these responses at the expense of the other. That is, I will defend, and expand on, Swinburne's notion of a limited divine embodiment. In this effort I will be borrowing loosely from Charles Hartshorne, who has also been defending (for several decades) the idea of a divine body. As Hartshorne puts the issue: in a way, all talk about God short of strict univocity contains some negativity, in that God does not exist, know, love, etc. exactly as we do. With regard to the divine body, however, almost all theists?not Swinburne?have allowed this negativity to run wild.1 The initial response Swinburne gives to the question in the title of this article can be found at several points throughout his trilogy.2 This response suggests that God is a person without a body, a spirit. "That God is a person," he claims, "yet one without a body, seems the most elementary claim of theism."3 What makes the claim elementary is partly the fact that most Western theists have held it, but Swinburne also holds this position for at least seven other reasons. First, the term "body" has an ordinary and nonambiguous use outside of theology, such that if this term is used analogously in too loose a way in theology one runs the risk of making difficult any proofs for the coherence of theism.4 Second, the claim "God is not embodied" is a denial that there is any limited volume of matter such that God can control only it, and knows goings-on elsewhere only by their effects on it (my emphasis?as we will see, Swinburne leaves open the possibility here for a different sort of divine embodiment).5 THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. II, No. 3, 1988. Published by The Pennsylvania State University Press, University Park and London. 225</page><page sequence="2">226 DISCUSSION NOTE Third, because personal identity (even in human beings) is not due to bodily continuity, and is unanalyzable into conjunctions or disjunctions of other observable properties, God's personal identity does not require a body.6 Fourth, God does not need sense organs to see things, as Newton suggested in saying that space itself was God's sensorium.7 Whereas human beings see directly images conveyed by sensory nerves and only see external objects indirectly through these images, God "sees" objects themselves directly.8 Fifth, to be embodied is to be limited to parts of the world through which intentions are executed and knowledge acquired. Hence a body is a (mere) instrument, such that an embodied agent is one whose conscious processes interact with instrumental, bodily processes.9 Sixth, God's control of the world is immediate, hence God is nonem bodied. It is for this reason that Swinburne would reject Hume's suggestion that, on the evidence of the argument from design, we postulate an embodied God. For Swinburne, dissimilarities between effects lead to the postulation of dissimilarities between causes.10 That is, the evidence of order in nature is too vast and complex to infer a giant, embodied man, as it were, as cause of this order. And seventh, if God's knowledge depended on the proper functioning of intermediaries (e.g., eyes and ears), divine omniscience might be compromised if God did not correct these malfunc tioning intermediaries.11 The issue of divine embodiment is complicated somewhat, however, in some key texts where Swinburne gives an apparently different response to the question asked in the title of this article.12 For Swinburne, there are five things being said when one claims that "this is my body": (1) Distur bances in it cause me pain, whereas disturbances in a table are unfelt by me; (2) I feel the inside of this body, as in the emptiness of this stomach; (3) I can move directly many parts of this body, whereas I can only move other things indirectly through this body; (4) I look out on the world from where this body is; and (5) My thoughts and feelings are affected by goings-on in this body, as when I drink too many beers.13 Swinburne states without argument that God is not embodied in senses (1) and (5). The tradition of Western theism apparently makes argument unnecessary, for Swinburne, on these two points. (In fact, in E, as opposed toC, Swinburne either omits (1) altogether or includes it in (5).) He takes an agnostic stance regarding (2) in that we do not know if God "feels" anything in any sense of the term close to our usual understanding of what feeling is. And he is skeptical regarding (4). Although God knows without inference about any state of the world, there is no one place from which</page><page sequence="3">DOES GOD HAVE A BODY? 227 God looks out on the world. But Swinburne is more than willing to admit that God is embodied in sense (3). In that God is supposed to be able to move any part of the universe directly, God can make any part move as a basic action.14 Herein lies God's limited embodiment, as well as a clue as to how we can perhaps render consistent Swinburne's different responses to the question "Does God have a body?" The initial response is not to be taken as a denial of divine embodiment altogether, but rather as a denial of more substantial embodiment, and above all the denial that God controls and knows about the material universe by controlling and getting information from one part directly, and controlling and getting information from other parts only by their being in causal interaction with the former part.15 Swinburne thinks that this notion of limited divine embodiment may well be compatible with traditional Western theism, even if traditional theists often seem to agree only with what I have called Swinburne's initial response. For example, although Aquinas never alleges that God is in any way embodied, he does equivalently talk about divine omnipresence, and this because he believes that God controls all things and knows about all things. As Swinburne notes, the medievals were careful to rebut the suggestion that God had in any literal sense a dwelling in "heaven."16 Nonetheless, Swinburne is aware of the fact that traditional theists have tended to overemphasize the extent of God's nonembodiment, an over emphasis which conflicts with some of traditional theism's other claims, e.g., that God acts in the world and keeps it in some sort of order. Swinburne believes that "in many ways God is not related to a material object as a person is to his body, but in other ways he is so related. "17 That is, God is embodied in the very limited respect that he can move and has knowledge of all parts of the material universe. But the claim that God has no body is the denial of more substantial embodiment, and above all, the denial that God controls and knows about the material universe by controlling and getting information from one part directly and other parts indirectly. So when the theist claims that he is arguing to a non-embodied agent, we must bear in mind that it would be perhaps less misleading to say that he is arguing to</page><page sequence="4">228 DISCUSSION NOTE the existence of a rational agent who is far less embodied (tied down to matter) than we are, but one embodied to the extent and in the ways which I have just described.18 One wonders, however, if Swinburne's notion of limited divine embodi ment is sufficient. to avoid some of the perennial problems found in traditional theism. Obviously Swinburne is correct in not using "M predicates" (those applicable to material bodies) like "weighs ten pounds" when speaking of God. Instead he refers to God by way of "P-predicates" (those applicable to persons). But when one looks at Swinburne's own examples of P-predicates it seems doubtful that they can be applied to God without a stronger notion of divine embodiment than Swinburne is willing to defend; for instance, "is in pain."19 Swinburne sidesteps the problem of how a God who is only embodied in a limited sense can also feel pain by denying that God suffers or experiences pain, a la traditional theism. This denial is made in spite of the fact that God cares for suffering creatures, a care which itself leads to a vicarious sort of suffering, unless, of course, "care" is used in a too loosely analogous or equivocal fashion (a situation Swinburne would otherwise want to avoid). Hartshorne's stronger defense of divine embodiment would enhance many of Swinburne's best insights, I think. (However, Hartshorne would not, because of his Buddhist-like denial of the substantial self, refer to his stronger sense of divine embodiment as a defense of a more "substantial" divine embodiment.) Consider that because embodied animal individuals like human beings must, to maintain their integrity, adapt to their environ ment, mortality is implied. But if we imagine an omniscient, omnibenevo lent, and omnipresent God (or what Plato and Hartshorne would call the World Soul), we must not consider an environment external to deity, but an internal one: the world body of the world mind. This cosmic, divine "animal" has such an intimate relation to its body that it must also have ideal ways of perceiving and remembering its body such that it can identify the microindividuals it includes. We can only tell when cells in our finger have been burned by the fire; we cannot identify the microindividuals as such. Hartshorne notes that in the Republic (462C-D) Plato makes it clear that if there is pain in one's finger (note, not the whole hand) the entire community (pasa he koinonia) of bodily connections is hurt; the organized unity of the individual is such that when one part is hurt there is a feeling of pain in the man as a whole (hole)</page><page sequence="5">DOES GOD HAVE A BODY? 229 who has the pain in his finger. Plato shares with Hartshorne the following analogy:20 SI : S2 :: S2 : S3 where SI stands for microscopic or cellular feeling, S2 for sentiency per se or sentiency in an embodied individual, and S3 for divine sentiency or feeling or caring. The universe is a society or an organism (a Platonic World Soul) of which one member (God, or the Platonic Demiurge) is preemi nent, just as human beings or other embodied animals are societies of cells, of which the mental part is preeminent. Hartshorne has taken the World Soul as a clue for present philosophizing about the divine body. For example, if God is omnibenevolent then God cares for the world, hence each new divine state harmonizes itself both with its predecessor and with the previous state of the cosmos. This is analogous to a human being or an animal harmonizing itself with its previous experi ence and bodily state, but with a decisive difference. The human being must hope that its internal and external environment will continue to make it possible for it to survive, whereas God has no such problem in that there is no external environment for God, as Swinburne would admit. But the differences between God and human beings-animals (e.g., God knows the microindividuals included in the divine life and God has no external environment) should not cloud the important similarities (e.g., the facts that self-change is integral to soul at all levels and that the soul-body or organic analogies used to understand God do not preclude the person person analogy, which allows a link between human beings and the divine person, a link integral to Swinburne's thought). The most important similarity lies in the fact that one's bodily cells are associated, at a given moment, with one as a conscious, supercellular singular, just as all lesser beings are associated with the society of singulars called God. In the case of the divine individual, where all entities are fully enjoyed, there can be no envy of others or conflict with them in that they are integral to the divine goodness. Less completely are an animal's cells internal to the individual. For example, bone cells in a finger are less internal and less fully possessed by an individual than are the brain cells. These considerations regarding divine inclusiveness also explain why the cosmos could not be held together and ordered by a malevolent God or by a plurality of gods, as in Hume, in that these deities are always partly divided</page><page sequence="6">230 DISCUSSION NOTE within or among themselves, and are incapable of an objective grasp of truth. The cosmos can be held together only by an all-sympathetic coordi nator. That is, God is the individual and organic (hence embodied) integrity of the world, which is otherwise a concatenation of myriad parts or a mere machine in need of a machine-maker, as Swinburne would seem to admit. Belief in a World Soul (God) is connected with a belief in a world body, which is superior to our bodies because there is nothing internal to it (e.g., cancer cells) which could threaten its continued existence, even if the divine body is spatially finite. Further, our bodies are fragmentary, as in a human infant's coming into the world as a secondary lifestyle expressing its feelings upon a mother's system, which already had a basic order among its cells; whereas the divine body does not begin to exist on a foundation previously established. When an animal body dies, its individual lifestyle no longer controls its members, yet the result is not chaos, but simply a return to the more pervasive types of order expressive of the cosmic mind body. The World Soul is aware of the divine body, and can vicariously suffer with its suffering members, but it cannot suffer in the sense of ceasing to exist due to an alien force. An individual can influence it (how else can we understand divine love and goodness?), but none can threaten it. Not even brain death can threaten the divine body because the soul body analogy cannot be pushed to the point where a divine brain is posited. The contrast between the brain and a less essential bodily part only makes sense because an animal has an external environment. Consider that the divine body does not need limbs to move about, for it is its own place, space merely being the order among its parts, as Swinburne might agree, as we have seen, in his favorable use of Newton. The divine body does not need a digestive system or lungs to take in food or air from without in that there is no "without." So it is with all organs outside the central nervous system, which, as we know but Plato did not, is the organ that adapts internal activities to external stimuli, a function which is not needed in the inclusive organism. Swinburne is close to Hartshorne here when he sug gests that God's power is not dependent on having a brain as opposed to having some other (instrumental) organ.21 The only function of the divine body is to furnish the World Soul with awareness of, and power over, its bodily members. In Hartshorne's refined use of the animal/body analogy, although there is no special part of the cosmos recognizable as a nervous system as opposed to some other bodily</page><page sequence="7">DOES GOD HAVE A BODY? 231 part, every creaturely individual becomes, as it were, not so much a finger or some other bodily part, but a brain cell directly related to the World Soul. I emphasize the word "directly" so as to show once again the similarity between Swinburne and Hartshorne, even though there is at least one major point that divides them. For Swinburne there is no overriding reason for God to make a universe. That is, there is no overriding reason for God to have even a limited embodiment. But for Hartshorne and I this would imply that there is no overriding reason for God to be omniscient or omnibenevolent. Without a world there would be nothing for God to know except divine thoughts and nothing for God to love except divinity. The gap between Swinburne and Hartshorne on this point is partially bridged by Swinburne's admission that, even though there are not overriding reasons for God to have a world (i.e., have a limited embodiment), there are nonetheless good reasons for having a world. For Swinburne, if God has a body it must be beautiful and orderly, allowing some ugliness so as to teach human beings the aesthetic merits of different states of affairs.22 In sum, I agree with Swinburne that divine embodiment includes sense (3), and that embodiment in senses (2) and (4) should not be predicated of God. However, much more coherence can be given to the notions of omnipresence and omnibenevolence, and to theism in general, if we also claim that God is embodied in senses (1) and (5). My disagreement with Swinburne is largely due to the fact that I take Plato's theism seriously, whereas he largely (and perhaps unwittingly, like many other traditional theists) follows Aristotle. Strange as it seems, although Plato developed a dipolar categorial scheme (where form is contrasted to matter, etc.), his cosmology is ul timately a psychical monism, where the World Soul holds the cosmos together as a universe. Aristotle, however, developed a single categorial scheme of embodied form. Paradoxically, from this emphasis on embodied form Aristotle ultimately constructed a more vicious dualism than any ever envisaged by Plato, in that Aristotle's divinities are completely self-suffi cient entities, unmoved, and separated from all change, multiplicity, and embodiment. The influence of Aristotle's nonembodied gods, I allege, extends long after Aquinas, and even touches Swinburne, as in his reluc tance to admit anything other than a limited divine embodiment.

The identity of S2 across the equation S1:S2::S2:S3 is essential for my thesis in this article, although I can only briefly suggest why this is so. Any analogy is an effort to move from something we understand well to something we see through a glass darkly. We have no alternative but to interpret subhuman reality (e.g., SI) and superhuman reality (e.g., S3) through the only samples of reality we know directly: ourselves as embodied animals. The trick is to use our own experience to bridge the gap between ourselves, on the one hand, and lesser or greater beings, on the other, without anthropomorphic orgies. The rest of my article indicates, I hope, that I am careful in how I analogize from S2 to S3.
