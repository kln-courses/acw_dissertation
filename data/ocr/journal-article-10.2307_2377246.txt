<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW WILLIAM ORTON Until comparatively recent times the problem of sover- eignty has been conceived mainly as a problem of authority. Even by those who inclined to a pragmatic view of the ques- tion the nature of the state as an instrument of power, rather than its function as an instrument of purpose, has occupied the forefront of discussion; and its ends have been stated in transcendental and general terms whose ethical connotation begs the question of authority at the very outset. The result is that our legacy of political theory has proved inadequate to the needs of a rapidly changing social order; and now the ac- tual progress of events has swung us round full circle, so that we find ourselves back in our speculation at a position corre- sponding almost exactly to that of Heraclitus. That is to say, we stand once more on the threshold of a "classical" era, to be marked in its social thinking by a second attempt to derive the principles of social relations, without adventitious aids, from the world as given and objectively apprehended; and (per- haps we may add) with our psychology in much the same rela- tive condition as Heraclitean physics. Of this circle of politi- cal theorizing we may imagine Cicero as marking the first quarter, with Seneca close after in the dawn of Christendom; the great sixteenth-century Jesuits at the farthest swing; Hobbes and Locke in the late afternoon of the Christian ethos;1 and Bentham, toiling away-though with different tools from ours-to re-establish a naturalis ratio of human affairs, somewhere near ourselves; while from time to time, contrary to all rules of the game, men like Carneades, Mar- siglio, Cusanus, Spinoza, Machiavelli, cut chords inside the circumference, and are usually penalized in consequence. 1Hobbes' view of nature is accurately Aristotelian; cf. Preface to the Rudiments and Nic. Eth., I, 13. '47</page><page sequence="2">I48 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS The most useful clue to this long process is, paradoxically enough, the idea of natural law-paradoxically since, as the unlearned might innocently remark, if law is natural, why all this fuss about enforcement? The answer to this foolish ques- tion indicts nature rather than human wits; reveals her com- plexity, rather than their naivete', as the cause of that unhap- py, and at last conflicting, dichotomy of natural and super- natural categories of being, in the second of which the idea of law raised the problem of authority in such peculiarly insid- ious form. Not by any means that we envisage nature as all of a piece and rational, as we conceive rational; but that we have lost the taste for categorical imperatives based on entities of which we have no certain knowledge. It may, in fact, be of use to our subsequent discussion to posit here two proposi- tions of a general order: First, that no rational statement can ever be made concerning a thing in itself; or, in other words, that a category can be made the subject of a real proposition only to the extent to which the proponent has experience of categories other than the one in question.2 Second, that while the categories of being to which life has access may be consid- ered not finite, it is the custom of those in which it has not at- tained, or maintained, the level of reflective co-ordination, to appear irrational, in so far as they appear at all. I The oldest and the most fundamental of all problems is that of the one and the many. Unity and diversity-order and chaos-direction and spontaneity-coexisting in the same time and space in the cosmos as a whole, in inanimate nature (if such there be), or in the community of mankind: that is the problem with which, in some phase or other, thought is perennially confronted. In its larger aspects the problem is probably insoluble; but in its successive restatements there is 2 For a classical statement of this position see the views attributed to Gorgias: Gomperz, Greek Thinkers, I, Book III, chap. vii, and Robertson, A Short History of Morals, p. IIo.</page><page sequence="3">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW I49 progress, and such progress constitutes new knowledge for each succeeding situation.3 Before attempting to analyze the phase of it with which political theory has been most concerned, it is desirable to dis- tinguish briefly three senses in which the term "law" has been, and sometimes still is, employed. The first connotation is that for which Karl Pearson has suggested the term "formula":4 a summary statement in "mental shorthand" of the observed recurrences in the relations between perceived facts or classes of facts. The second is that indicated by the Roman jus, for which perhaps our word "right" (as in "natural rights") may be deemed a rough equivalent: that which is supposed to be defended or secured by justice. Implicit in this, and supple- menting the notion of order or uniformity, is an ethical value- judgment arising from the disposition of the mind itself. In virtue of this value-judgment jus becomes background or foundation for the third connotation, namely, that of law (lex) in the Austinian sense, that of an explicit rule girt with authority and sanction. This distinction-historic, of course, rather than analytic-is as near general applicability as is worth striving after in this connection; but it is to be noted that even historically the scheme is liable to confusion owing to the constant tendency of medieval writers in particular to use lex in the first sense of formula, adding to its connotation a value-judgment based on neo-Platonic metaphysics, and thus the criterion of lex ( vPotos) in the familiar legal usage of that making it the logical precedent of jus, which in turn becomes much too-adaptable term. Now what the Romans took over from Greek philosophy was substantially a mode of transition from the first to the second connotations above cited: from formula to principle. This tradition in Greek thought starts with the attempt of the sixth-century philosophers to understand the external world 'Cf. Pearson, Grammar of Science, Preface to i9ii ed. 'Pearson, op. cit., chaps. i and iii.</page><page sequence="4">I50 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS -that is, to perceive system or order in it-in contrast to the mythical or semimythical cosmogonies of their predecessors. Heraclitus and Anaximander are objective in their attitudes, to the extent, at least, of not shirking the dilemma with which their senses present them. The dicta of Heraclitus concerning universal substance, polarity, and flow belong to the realm of fact and hypothesis-formula-rather than law or principle. But as his thought develops we trace the imputation of the value-judgment by which the transition from formula to prin- ciple is made. The idea of measure, for example, clearly fore- shadows the conception of political justice in Plato.5 The no- tion of an "invisible harmony" in which all coexistent discords are resolved marks a further advance; and the idea of univer- sal law existing from all time becomes clearly philosophical when we find the epithet "divine" imputed to it.6 The transi- tion from formula to principle by means of the value-judg- ment is complete in such dicta as: "Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things."' Here we have the first suggestion of that identification of reason in the mind with system in the cosmos which was later to attain such importance. In passing we may notice that in Empedocles and Anaxagoras we have the transition made in the opposite sense the facts or formulae of mental life car- ried over into the cosmos at large. Relevant to this early phase of natural law doctrine there is an extremely significant re- mark of Karl Pearson: "To speak of the universal validity of a law of nature has only meaning in so far as we refer to a cer- tain type of perceptive faculty, namely, that of a normal hu- man being."8 While it would be too sweeping to claim that the Greeks had no inkling of this fact, such traces of it as are to be 'Republic iv. 427-34. 8 Gomperz, op. cit., Vol. I, Introduction. 'Burnett, Early Greek Philosophers, chap. iii. 8 Op. cit., chap. iii.</page><page sequence="5">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW I5I found, for example, in Plato9 did not save them from that ob- jectification of the nature of mind which constitutes the essen- tial weakness of their tradition. Even in the illustrations from Heraclitus just cited there is a clear correspondence between wisdom in the mind and divinity in the cosmos. A necessity of thought is, as it were, projected into the phenomenal world, and because of its supreme interest to the thinker made the basis of a superlative and objective value-judgment. Thus early does the homocentric orientation govern the concept of nature-a fact of cardinal importance to all subsequent the- orizing. II At this stage the tradition is reinforced from another and an independent source in which the value-judgment is primary instead of secondary. The idea of eternal law in the ethical sense is perhaps traceable to the old concept of Moira, fate, which constrained both gods and men.'0 Its importance in both Greek and Roman thought arises from its subjective and emotional basis; as illustrated, for instance, in Antigone's famous appeal to the "unwritten and unfailing statutes of the gods,"" and in the choric hymn in Oedipus Tyrannos:`2 "May I never break the sanctity of the unwritten laws. Heavenborn, they live and move on high and are not made by man, nor shall they ever sleep or be forgotten. In them is a divine power which grows not old." Examples of this attitude from both ancient and modern speech could be almost indefinitely multiplied. It is the reli- -gious attitude, of course, in one of its many manifestations. Without attempting here to definO, that attitude, it will prob- ably be acceptable to remark that on the subjective side at least it springs from the conflict of impulses, and constitutes, 9Laws, iv. 714.

(Campbell).</page><page sequence="6">I52 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS in its intention toward peace, blessedness, the sense of sancti- fication, etc., a recognized and well-established means of re- unifying or reintegrating the personality. Just as the concept of nature previously referred to reflects the human effort to resolve the conflict of impressions and ideas, so the ethical concept in this second case reflects the effort to resolve the conflict of desires and emotions: the effort being in both cases projected on the cosmos or "natural" world and there objecti- fied. It may be added that just as in the first case the effort usually takes a form that is conceptually serviceable to others, so in the second case the form is apt to prove ethically service- able. The result is thus in both cases normally and pragmat- ically social; there being, however, no guaranty or inherent necessity that it should so prove, other than the natural selec- tion and survival of those instances relevant to the larger areas of like-mindedness. A third and most important constituent of natural-law doctrine has its first explicit formulation in Socrates:13 But now, are you aware, Hippias, of certain unwritten laws? Yes [he answered] those held in every part of the world, and in the same sense. Can you then assert [asked Socrates] of these unwritten laws that men made them? Nay, how [he answered] should that be, for how could they have all come together from the ends of the earth? And even if they had so done, men are not all of one speech. Whom then do you believe to have been the makers of these laws? For my part I think that the gods must have made these laws for men. It is to be noted that this position, though well defined as far as it goes, is philosophically incomplete, inasmuch as it indi- cates no firm reason, other than a simple ipse dixit, for imput- ing supreme ethical value to the universal. It is, in fact, log- ically open to precisely the development for which Ulpian was so severely castigated by medieval jurists"-the extension of 18 Xen. Mem. iv. 4 (Dakyns). 14 See e.g., Erdmann, Hist. Phil., Vol. I, par. 252.</page><page sequence="7">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW I53 the jus naturale to cover such universal practices as procrea- tion, in which even the animals partake. For a more reasoned statement of the argument from uni- versality, which avoids the possibility of such an indiscretion as Ulpian's, we naturally turn to Aristotle. We find, in the first place, a direct synthesis of the religious element of nat- ural law (the second above noted) with the appeal to univer- sality, attained by setting back the universality argument from the plane of overt act to that of the moral sense itself. After quoting Empedocles' reference to "a universal law stretching without break through the wide domain of the sky and through the vast earth too," the Stagirite adds: "For there is a certain natural and universal right and wrong, which all men divine, even if they have no intercourse or covenant with each other."'5 This is a distinct step forward. Philoso- phers, it is true, have never succeeded in giving much specific content to the natural law thus appealed to: Socrates as well as Hobbes had some little difficulty in the matter,16 and the solution of the jurisconsults was mainly empirical. But though modern comparative sociology may rejoin that the moral sense is specifically no more uniform than moral practice, Aristotle's logic had brought him at least to a dialectically safer position. This position, we may note in the second place, harks back to the datum of conflict or dualism (of rational and irration- al), both in the mind and in the cosmos,'7 and to the need of integration as the supreme interest, and therefore good, of man, both individually and socially.'8 The trouble with vice is that it clouds the clear discrimination of the ends of action which it is the virtue of temperance to preserve; practical wis- dom being "a true rational state of mind which is active in the 15 Rhet. i. 13 (Jebb). 16 Cf. Xenophon Mem. iv. 4, and Leviathan, chaps. xiv and xv. 17Nic. Eth.i. '3. 8I bid. ii. 6; cf. Pol. i. I, 2.</page><page sequence="8">I54 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS field of human goods."' When, further, Aristotle proceeds to explain "right," in the phrase "right reason," as meaning that which is accordant with practical wisdom,20 he is enunciating a definitely social philosophy in as secure terms as the state of knowledge could have permitted. He is thus, of course, restat- ing, more analytically and empirically, substantially the same philosophy that Plato had arrived at from the cosmological standpoint. In the Platonic cosmogony the god or demiurge or prime mover is not the creator, but the arranger, the imposer of order upon a chaos which he cannot wholly subdue. He works by the light of the ideas fixed in the eternal reason; and by this same reason man himself is guided toward the attain- ment of order, both in his individual and his communal life. Thus in the Republic2' we have the idea of justice as consist- ing in adherence to true nature or function because thereby social harmony ensues; and in a noteworthy passage of the Laws the whole position is summed up: How can there be the least shadow of wisdom where there is no har- mony? There is none; but the noblest and greatest of harmonies may be truly said to be the greatest wisdom; and of this he is a partaker who lives according to reason; whereas he who is devoid of reason is the de- stroyer of his house and the very opposite of a savior of the state: he is utterly ignorant of political wisdom.22 III It is worth while pausing at this point to review the ele- ments of the progress just outlined. The proposition that the real is the rational, implicit in Heraclitus, explicit in Plato, is in fact a piece of anthropomorphism not yet recognized as such, prompted by the human need to resolve the conflicts of sensory and reflective experience. From this proposition fol- lows a second basic element which we may roughly indicate by the phrase, "the right is the real": that is, right conduct is conduct according with the true (rational) nature of man and 9 Nic. Eth. vi. 5. ' Ibid., vi. 13. ORep. iv. 427-34. 22 Laws iii. 689 (Jowett).</page><page sequence="9">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW I55 the universe.23 This position, explicit in both Plato and Aris- totle, is also anthropomorphic in origin, springing from a simi- lar need to find for the conflicts of impulse and desire a solu- tion not merely dialectical, but backed by intrinsic authority and absolute sanction. The anthropomorphism of these posi- tions is not, of course, peculiar to the Greeks: it pervades most human logic and ethics and does no particular harm except when it is made the basis of an authoritarian system. It may well be that reality supports the particular construction thus put upon it, as one among many possible constructions. The logical importance of the anthropomorphic or homocentric ele- ment is determined simply by the distribution of emphasis in the developed systems, as between subjective and objective, humanistic or authoritarian sanctions. A third element of the Greek tradition, which we may schematically indicate by the phrase, "the real is the univer- sal," constitutes the basic ingredient of later juristic natural law. In this case we find in both Plato and Aristotle attempts at historical or empirical verification, which could not, how- ever, contribute very much to substantiate or test the posi- tion; and we are left confronting what is really an act of faith in the solubility of social conflicts through law based on a sup- posed "natural" solidarity of mankind. There are thus latent in the Greek heritage not one, but two, distinct possibilities: the first, a development of the orig- inal humanistic tradition, seeking, with a minimum of appeal to transcendental absolutes, a clue to the solution of individ- ual or social conflicts in the Platonic ideal of harmony; the second, a development of the projective tradition, placing the emphasis upon the objectified divine element, or casa cau- sans, and building thereon a deistic authoritarian system. The first possibility was realized to no small extent by the Epi- 23 Cf. Laws iv. 714: "We must hearken, both in private and public life, and reg- ulate our cities and houses, according to law, meaning by that very term 'law,' the distribution of mind" (Jowett).</page><page sequence="10">I56 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS cureans, and to a lesser extent, particularly in respect of the dogma of "spontaneous sociability," by the Stoics;24 the sec- ond, by Seneca and the church. But the dominant choice was not, of course, determined on logical grounds- else the Epicureans would not have had to wait until the twentieth century for their succession; it was determined, as such choices always are, by the cultural needs of the particular situation. We may regret that the authori- tarian interpretation of nature, with its inherent anthropo- morphic basis, precluded for centuries the idea of relativity in juridical philosophy and militated against a scientific applica- tion of what might have been a very useful method. On the other hand we must recognize that it furnished a basis of authority when other authority was insecurely founded, and thus played its part in the integration of human association. It is interesting to observe the eclecticism with which the early church selected, from the miscellany of ideas transmitted by Cicero and Seneca, just those elements upon which the the- ocratic system could most easily be founded. Cicero's affirma- tion of natural law as the manifestation of an active and divine administrator in the universe; his insistence on this principle as a sufficient prescriptive rule for mankind, even in the ab- sence of positive law; his attribution of the authority of jus to its divine source, and to that alone; his inclusion of the idea of sovereignty in the natural order-all these are, as it were, ready-made materials for a system which involved a progres- sive abandonment of the attempt at a scientific ethos,25 and culminated in a dogmatic identification of natural law with the gospel, pentateuch, and decalogue-that "epitome legis naturae."26 But while we can easily understand the rejection by official Christendom of the sceptical empiricism of Carneades and the ' Barnes, "The Natural State of Man," in Monist, January, 1923. a' Cf. Carlyle, Med. Pol. Th., Vol. I, chap. i. ' Nicolaus Hemming, quoting Erdmann, loc. cit.</page><page sequence="11">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW I57 Epicureans-which even to Cicero, as a "well-mannered and honorable-minded philosophic amateur," seemed anarchistic and subversive-it is not so easy to explain the fate which doomed the really constructive elements in Cicero to relative sterility for eighteen centuries. For those elements represent- ed the maturity of the less anthropomorphic side of the Greek heritage, and have been received by modern thought as a far safer basis for political thinking than the deistic and revela- tory thesis. Chief among them is the Stoic idea of human solidarity as a basis of prescriptive law.27 This is forecast in the description of right reason as that which cements society or maintains hu- man association, and the consequent censure of the man who violates this human fraternity.28 It is still plainer in the postu- lation of common human interests which the laws are estab- lished to subserve and from which the rules of right conduct can be derived.29 In point of fact it matters little whether hu- man solidarity be explained as due to divine reason in the uni- verse or a so-called "gregarious instinct" among men, so long as it is accepted as a primary datum for the principles of social procedure. Cicero frequently so accepts it in theory as the jurisconsults did in practice; and seeing how much of durabil- ity it contributed to the law, we are justified in asking why it received so little emphasis, as compared with other elements of the Greek legacy, in political theory. The answer raises certain considerations which apply not less to modern than to classical theory. In the first place, it was a comparatively late and a priori idea of the philosophers, and as such could not compete in dynamic import with the w De off. iii. 5, 6. ' De Leg. i. i5. ' De Off. iii. 6: Atque etiam, si hoc natura praescribit, ut homo homini, qui- cumque sit, ob eam ipsam causam, quod is homo sit, consultum velit, necesse est secumdum eandem naturam omnium utilitatem esse communem.

Verum autem primum; verum igitur extremum.</page><page sequence="12">I58 INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ETHICS older deistic, or quasi-deistic notions: the reason lying less in its content than in its motivation, though to some extent in both. The history of the period, as of all subsequent periods, shows conclusively that to attain dynamic importance in soci- ety an idea must spring from, and answer to, psychological re- quirements other than the purely intellectual. The notions of divine reason and divine justice-but especially the latter- fulfilled this condition much more completely than that of spontaneous sociability. Originating in a fairly common indi- vidual experience of intellectual or emotional conflict, the for- mer were well calculated to arouse, especially in their popular personified form, that affective reaction without which even the best-authenticated notions are doomed to social sterility. The idea of general or natural solidarity did not lend itself, as a theoretic datum, to personification or (except perhaps to some extent, and indirectly, under the pax Romana) to wide- spread affective reaction. There was, indeed, and is still in it a certain projective or anthropomorphic element (if the word may pass in this con- nection) somewhat similar to that which we noted in the deis- tic concepts: but it was a projectivism or anthropomorphism of the philosophers only. The philosophic mind, consciously relishing the good of peace and community in a limited circle of direct experience, is perennially tempted to objectify this good upon the background of humanity in general, making of it a "natural" element like the divine reason, and imputing the existence of it to that wider sphere of relations in which direct experience does not extend. It is a divine error-but an error none the less. Just as "gregariousness" breaks up empirically into membership of specific communities, so this general or "natural" solidarity breaks up into local or functional or kin- dred-interest groups. And just as "consciousness of kind" im- plies in actuality consciousness of difference, so this "spon- taneous sociability" involves, in its pluralistic and heteroge- neous reality, feelings of group rivalry and antagonism.</page><page sequence="13">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW I59 Any attempt at verification of the postulate, even in classi- cal times, would have met with grave difficulties; the philos- ophers themselves made no consistent effort to apply it. The admission as an ideal of the defended city-state, with its per- manent warrior-caste, relegates it to a rather abstract plane; and when we come to specific cases-the practice of infanti- cide, the relation of social classes or of subject and conquering nations-what we actually get is something suspiciously like a rationalization of the status quo. Thus Aristotle, upon slav- ery, Cicero, upon imperialism, fall back upon the alleged in- equalities of individuals or groups;30 while in Cicero is trace- able the germ of the doctrine stated by Seneca and developed by the church-that of the justification of social, including coercive, institutions by a "fall" of humanity from the pristine state of nature in which equality and spontaneous sociability had originally obtained. Quite logically this leads, in seven- teenth-century theology, to a jus naturale prius (ideal) ani- mated by innate reason, and a jus naturale posterius animated byprudentia.8' Thus the principle of universal solidarity proved inade- quate in just the way such highly generalized notions still do -that of "society" or "community" in modern thought is perhaps a case in point. On the subjective side it did not come sufficiently close to the conflict of interests arising in individ- ual experience to mobilize behind it the psychological drive which is a necessary constituent of any dynamic theory; while on the objective side it had no sufficiently concrete solution to offer to the concrete problems to which the conflict-of-interest groups gave rise. The common interests to which, as in Cicero, it sometimes professed to appeal were in fact logical, not psy- chological, realities; and the task of interpreting them in terms which shall "mean something" to the average man, es- "' Carlyle, loc. cit.

On the other hand, it is perhaps consoling to observe that the authoritarian position is open, in the final analysis, to much the same criticism. If the deistic synthesis triumphed for so long, it was because subjectively its terms answered the psychological needs of the time more completely, while objec- tively it provided a more serviceable basis for a functioning social structure. But the cessation of these conditions leaves it with no other sanction to fall back on. On any view, there is plainly no content, logical, ethical, or philo- sophical, in the formula that the ideal of virtue is God, when the idea of God admittedly varies with every believer, being, in fact, the mere apoth- eosis of the believer's notion of power and goodness .... . No God- idea whatever can add anything to our resources in grappling with the problem of evil. At the best it is made by the ethic which professes to found on it. The God-idea being necessarily a human construction, "the Brocken-Phantom of self projected on the mists of the Non-Ego," it mat- ters not for the purposes of ethics (save in respect of the moral concep- tions embodied in the practical doctrine) how the given deity is sup- posed to relate to human conduct, or how his existence or character is supposed to be made out. No ethic whatever can be justified to the intel- ligence merely by saying that the theorist infers the agreement of Deity with his views of right and wrong.32 The criterion of both the subjective and the social validity of any doctrine is after all the individual experience; and when we find authoritarian deism failing simultaneously as a prin- ciple of personal integration and as a sanction for social insti- tutions, the cue is clear for a different approach to both phases of the problem. In fine, we must fall back upon scientific empiricism. On the subjective side we must invoke the aid of analytical psy- chology for the problem of personal integration, including in its purview, so far as knowledge allows, those situations which often appear objectively as interest-claims. And we must be 82 Robertson, op. cit., pp. 87-90.</page><page sequence="15">THE SOURCES OF NATURAL LAW i6i prepared to face the possibility that the solution of this phase of the question may be somewhat less identifiable with posi- tive social theories and institutions than tradition has hitherto suggested; that it may call not so much for more or different social institutions as for fewer and less rigid ones. Mean- while, on the objective side, we must concentrate our attention upon interests that are psychologically as well as logically real; abandoning the attempt to find, in any generalized logi- cal ideal-even that of peace a sufficient and self-authenti- cating principle of social relations. This would suggest, as the task of social engineering, a broadening and interrelating of the areas of actual community and like-mindedness: to the end that human solidarity may become not merely an idea of the philosophers, but an experience of the average man. If from the solidarity of our material culture we cannot extract that basis of a golden rule, let us acknowledge our essential inferiority to the genius of the third century.
