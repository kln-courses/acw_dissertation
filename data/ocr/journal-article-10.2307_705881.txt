<plain_text><page sequence="1">MUSES AND SIRENS THE original Sirens, according to Buschor (Die Musen des Jenseits, Munich, 1944), were not those of Homer, which are only partially identifiable with Phorcys' daughters, the monsters of Greek sea saga, but rather infernal counter- parts of the heavenly Muses, who charmed the souls of the dead in Hades with their song, and acted as their escort from this world to the next.' It is the main purpose of this paper to suggest that this view, attractive though it may appear, can scarcely be maintained on the evidence. Also the very natures of the Muses and Sirens were so opposed that it seems misleading to describe one, however loosely, in terms of the other. It is true that both Muses and Sirens were primarily regarded as songstresses, but the differences between them seem to outweigh any superficial resemblances. The Muses' traditional home was Pieria, a land watered by the springs flowing from Olympus and neighbouring mountains. The Sirens, on the other hand, dwelt on an unspecified island which lay somewhere between Aeaea and Scylla's cave. The Muses again were the divine inspirers of poesy, whereas the Sirens charmed only to destroy. The two are entirely dissociated in Homer, and possessed distinct genealogies. The Muses are stated by Hesiod (Theog. 53 if-, 915 ff.) to have been the daughters of Zeus by Mnemosyne, while the Sirens were born of Phorcys (Soph. fr. 777 N.) or Achelous (for references see Wentzel, R.E. i. 215, s.v. 'Acheloos'), and Chthon (Eur. Hel. 168). It was not until Hellenistic times that they became rivals in an aetiological myth (Paus. ix. 34- 3; Steph. Byz. s.v. dirrEpa), and a Muse was said to have been their mother (for references see Zwicker, R.E. iii. 294 ff., s.v. 'Sirenen'). Finally, the Muses were represented as anthropomorphic in art,z whereas the Sirens were depicted as woman-headed birds. ' The equation had already been sug- gested by Wilamowitz, Glaube der Hellenen, i. 268-9, and Cumont, Symbolisme fundraire des Romains, 148. 2 The earliest known representation of a Muse occurs on a Middle Corinthian kotyle (600-575 B.c.) from Ithaca (B.S.A. xliii. 18, No. 39). Calliope is depicted on the Francois Vase.</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 61 The stages whereby the local divinities of Pieria were transformed into vehicles of inspiration are matter for surmise. Farnell (Cults, v. 434 if-), probably rightly, rejected the view that they were nature spirits in origin like the Nymphs, on the ground that their subsequent history, despite casual associations with Dionysus (Plut. Symp. 8 praef.) and Thrace (II. ii. 595; Eur. Rhes. 921 ff.), shows no trace of nature worship. It is true, of course, that their cult was established in a mountain fastness, and close to prophetic springs, but their name suggests that they had always belonged to the psychic domain, and that their traditional background may have been of less account (see Gruppe, Mythol. Io76 ff.). Although Pieria is not mentioned in relation to the Muses in Homer, it seems probable from the frequent references to their dwelling on Olympus that the poet connected them with that region. Their close association with Apollo suggests that their original home may have been even farther north,' a speculation not entirely unsupported by the statement that Zeus was their father. The relationship of the Pierides to the Muses of Helicon is uncertain, but if, as seems probable, the Muse cult moved south with Apollo, then, as A. R. Burn has suggested in a recent article (B.S.A. xliv. 323), the massif which was most accessible from the lowlands of Boeotia would have been most likely to recom- mend itself to the northern invaders as a centre of worship for their mountain goddesses. Certainly they were well established on Helicon in Hesiod's time, whose works did so much to augment their fame. The Sirens had no legendary associations with Apollo, although keledones crowned his temple at Delphi (Paus. x. 5. 12) and a bird-monster appears as his familiar in a vase-painting (from Olympia: C. V.A. London B.M. No. 3, pl. 38, Ia). They are frequent visitors, on the other hand, to the Dionysiac revels (see, for example, B.M. E. 14; Beazley, A.R. V. 99, Nikosthenes painter No. I62), and clearly reflect something of their abandon. This difference in mood is further emphasized by the association of the Muses with Orpheus (for references see Guthrie, op. cit., n. I to ch. iii), and by the legend of the Sirens' defeat at the latter's hand (Ap. Rhod. Arg. iv. 909 ff. ; Orphic Argon. 1288 ff.). Orpheus is not mentioned by Homer, although Circe refers to the Argo in connexion with Scylla (Od. xii. 69 ff.). The story of his victory over the Sirens may be older, as he is included among the Argonauts in a Delphic relief (P. de la Coste-Messeliere, Au Musde de Delphes, pl. xi. i8o) and by Pindar (Pyth. 4. 177). Weicker (Der Seelenvogel) held that all researches into the nature of the Sirens, up to his time, had erred in commencing with Homer's monsters, and even Buschor's analysis attempts to deprive the latter, in some measure, of their essential priority. Nevertheless, any unbiased investigation must commence with the oldest evidence available, even though it may appear at first to offer less scope for inquiry than the manifold Mischwesen of orientalized art. The information which Homer gives concerning the Sirens may be sum- marized as follows (Od. xii. 39 ff.). They bewitch men with their song. The fate awaiting anyone so bewitched is death. They dwell in a flowery meadow, on an ' The traditional view that Apollo pos- sessed a northern origin is unproved, but has at least as much to recommend it as the theory that he reached Greece from Anatolia.

They are two in number, and lay claim to some- thing very like omniscience. The description of the island provides Buschor with his main evidence that the Sirens originally dwelt in Paradise. But although meadows are sometimes associated with the dead (see, for example, Plato, Rep. 614 e), sea-meadows are well-known phenomena, and are a feature to this day of Gli Galli,' the ZELep-vovoaaL (Strabo 22, 23, 247, 251, 252, 258; [Arist.] Misc. Ausc. 103) of western Greek tradition. The presence of the victims' bones and mouldering flesh merely adds a touch of realism like the scattering of the sailors' brains in Polyphemus' cave (Od. ix. 290), and has no Underworld associations. The remaining features are well-known folk-lore elements, and hardly to be taken seriously. It is true, as Buschor insists (op. cit. 9), that the Sirens do not devour their victims like other monsters, Scylla for example, but it is hard to detect evidence of original benevolence in such forbearance. Much has been made of Alcman's (fr. 7 B Bergk) charming compliment to a maiden's song. Both Wilamowitz (op. cit. 268) and Buschor (op. cit. 5) regard it as evidence that 'Muse' and 'Siren' were virtually synonymous terms, as though the latter reference were not an afterthought whose very point de- pends upon its startling contrast to the sober Muse. Although aELpyv is employed in a playful sense here, and bears no sinister significance in some other passages (see, for example, Pind. fr. 84 (Schroeder), io-i i), there is no evidence to show that it originally possessed an innocent connotation. Their dual number separates the Sirens sharply from the Muses, who were primarily regarded as members of a chorus.2 In post-Homeric times their complement remained constant at three (for references see n. 4 below) until Plato increased it in order to provide a guardian for each of his eight mythical spheres. The latter instance troubled Plutarch (Symp. ii. 745 c), who supposed that Plato was loosely confusing Sirens and Muses in this passage. But there were nine Muses according to the latest3 epic tradition, and there was no precedent for transporting them from Olympus. It is merely fanciful to argue with Buschor (op. cit. I i) that Plato preferred the former in order to emphasize their historical priority, for that is what his argument amounts to. Probably such vagaries are often the result of individual caprice, like the conventional names bestowed from time to time upon both Muses (for references see Mayer, R.E. 694, s.v. 'Musai') and Sirens.4 The question of the precise relationship of Homer's Sirens to the bird-women of the orientalizing period of Greek art is complicated by the existence of bearded bird-men, which actually predominate among the earlier examples. Many of these are clearly decorative (see, for example, Buschor, op. cit., fig. 23, PP. 33 and 43 ff.), but others seem to represent amorphous powers5 of various kinds, including some of those (e.g. the KIpES) mentioned by Homer. The Sirens A good modern account of these islands is given by Norman Douglas, Sirenland, 42-43. 2 The frequent appeals to single Muses do not preclude the existence of others. See Stanford on Od. xxiv. 62. 3 Od. xxiv. 63, where, however, Stanford has suggested that the absence of the article may indicate an indefinite number. 4 e.g. IMEPOTTA on an Attic red-fig. stamnos (B.M. E. 440: Mon. dell' Inst. i, pl. 8; C. V.A. Lond., pl. 20. i) and the Hellenistic names Thelxiope or Thelxinoe, Molpe, Aglaophonos, and Peisinoe. But Parthenope, Leukosia, and Ligeia appear to be of geographical origin. Cf. Weicker, op. cit. 65 and n. 2. s See E. Kunze, A.M. Ivii. 135 ft.</page><page sequence="4">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 63 were evidently included among the latter, and as such assumed a similar physical and pictorial form. Their special association with music was emphasized in some examples by furnishing them with harps,' or by their inclusion in revel contexts (see, for example, Louvre E. 695; B.C.H., 1893, p. 238, fig. 6). Scenes from the Odyssey are rare in seventh-century art, and the earliest representation ofthe Siren story appears on a black-figured Corinthian aryballos which dates from the second quarter of the sixth century B.C. (Boston o 1.8I oo: Bulle, Strena Helbigiana, 31, fig. 17). Although the design includes some strange features (see Pollard, A.J.A. liii. 347 ff.), the main details are sufficiently clear. Later designs include the legend of the Sirens' suicide (for references see p. 62, n. 4), which is not mentioned in literature until Lycophron (712 ff., I463 ff.). If this sequel was part of the original version, as seems likely, then it marked the end2 of the monsters for all time, and it is difficult to see how they could be confused with members of a g6ttlicher Musenchor. The true nature of the K~XvA678VEs or ?vyyEg which graced Apollo's temple at Delphi and Sophocles' tomb (Vit. Soph. ix) has never been determined, but there is reason to suppose that they were Sirens (Paus. x. 5. 12). If this were so, a preference for such sobriquets suggests that attempts were made to humanize them even before Euripides (Helen 167 ff., fr. 911 N.). The origin of the custom of depicting Sirens upon tombs is unknown, but as such well-known examples as the pillar-perching Siren from Xanthos (Smith, B.M. Cat. of Sculpture, i. 93, pl. I2), and the monsters of the so-called 'Harpy Tomb' (ibid.) derive from the east, it seems probable that mainland examples drew their inspiration from that quarter. So that even if Buschor is right in suggesting that Orphism played its part in their creation (op. cit. 38), he is still far from proving the priority of such creatures to Homer's Sirens. The chthonian associations of the Sirens were well established by the end of the fifth century B.C. Euripides' Helen appeals both to the Sirens, daughters of Chthon, and to Persephone to join in a dirge (though the relationship between them, if any, is not made explicit), while Plato (Cratylus 403 d) tells how even their powers failed to persuade Pluto to release them from the Underworld. But it is hard to believe that such references were not suggested by the practice of placing Sirens upon tombs rather than by any independent tradition. The Siren cult at Naples undoubtedly possessed chthonian features, but the evidence for its existence cannot be traced before Strabo (246). Probably it represented a conflation by Greek colonists of the Siren legend with a local cult. The story, preserved by Hyginus (ed. Rose, 103), that the Sirens wept over the loss of Persephone and followed her into the Underworld is clearly aetiological and designed to explain the existence of the mourning Sirens into which the tomb Sirens finally degenerated. Such then, in outline, is the nature of the evidence upon which Buschor has based his thesis. Of the general quality and fascination of his work there can be no doubt, for its style proclaims the masterpiece. As a piece of critical scholar- ship it is open to the gravest suspicion.
