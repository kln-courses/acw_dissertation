<plain_text><page sequence="1">" THE WRECK OF THE DEUTSCHLAND" AND THE DYNAMIC SUBLIME BY JEROME BUMP I Attempting to understand the development of Hopkins' art by reading his works in the order in which they were written, we feel a sharp break between the last entry of his Journal (dated February 7, 1875) and his next work, "The Wreck of the Deutschland," conceived less than a year later. We feel almost as if we had turned from, say, Millais' " Ophelia " to Turner's " Steamer in a Snowstorm " and were asked to imagine that they were painted by the same artist in the same year. Reading the Journal we came to expect a Pre-Raphaelite preoccupation with nature's lights, colors, and sharply delineated forms, a surface more self-consciously impersonal and objective than similar journals of scientists of the time, a quiet stasis, and the occasional mention of God here and there in the midst of descriptions of nature. Turning to the poem we are confronted with a darkness which drowns all light, color and form, a violent collision of the great forces of nature, continual authorial intrusions and outbursts of emotion, and one of the most direct and intimate relationships between God, man, and nature represented in litera- ture. The title and epigraph of " The Wreck of the Deutschland" suggest a vision of nature different from that of the Journal: but there is nothing that prepares us for the astonishingly direct and personal address to God with which the poem begins. Though the first stanza may be regarded as within the bound of conventional invocations, the second stanza and the beginning of the third reveal something which, in its essence, is radically different from anything in Hopkins' previous prose or poetry: I did say yes 0 at lightning and lashed rod; Thou heardst me truer than tongue confess Thy terror, 0 Christ, 0 God; 106 " The Wreck of the Deutschland"</page><page sequence="2">Thou knowest the walls, altar and hour and night: The swoon of a heart that the sweep and hurl of thee trod Hard down with a horror of height: And the midriff astrain with leaning of, laced with fire of stress. The frown of his face Before me, the hurtle of hell Behind, where, where was a, where was a place? I whirled out wings that spell And fled with a fling of the heart to the heart of the Host. My heart, but you were dovewinged, I can tell.1 Expecting from the title and dedication a representation of the nuns and the wreck of the Deutschland, the reader finds instead Hopkins' personal response to " lightning and lashed rod." More- over, before the second stanza has ended the subject shifts from the terror of the storm to the " horror of height," a sensation ap- parently not related to a storm at all. At this point, with the poem barely begun and its modus operandi and intrinsic psy- chological progression already obscured, the reader may be tempt- ed to agree with previous readers who have felt that Hopkins' inability to successfully integrate " the objective physical literal- ness" of the wreck with the " subjective and spiritual matter that precedes and follows it" results in too much emotion and too little unity.2 " The Wreck of the Deutschland " has been called " startlingly unconventional " 3 because of the frequency with which it has defeated attempts to discover unity both within it and between it and other works of Hopkins. The poem is startlingly uncon- ventional-until we find the right conventions. Recognizing that 1 Citations from Hopkins' poetry in my text are to The Poems of Gerard Manley Hopkins, ed. W. H.

Romanticism, the poetry of meditation, Pindaric odes, and two versions of religious literature, the Ignatian and the Victorian, have been invoked as models which enable us to comprehend more fully Hopkins' aims and methods in the Surprisingly, one of the most pervasive and useful sets of con- ventions in the poem has been ignored: those features traditional- ly associated with the representation of " the sublime" in nature. Hopkins transforms his response to the snowstorm in which the Deutschland perished into a general response to the seemingly infinite power of the forces of God and nature, what Kant called the dynamic sublime. In the second stanza quoted above Hopkins adds lightning, for instance, and later in the poem he includes thunder, even though neither is appropriate to a snowstorm. The dove imagery of the third stanza quoted above, though it is an allusion to Psalm 54, also prepares us for the inclusion of the " Yore-flood " of Genesis. Similarly, the use of sweep and hurl in the second and thirteenth stanza, anticipating the Revised Authorized Version of Job 27:20-22s-" The east wind lifts him up and he is gone, it sweeps him out of his place. It hurls at him without pity"-suggests how allusions to The Book of Job in Part I will prepare us for the invocation of the whirlwind (13). The "&lt;horror of height " and "Hurtle of hell " phrases in the second and third stanzas bring in a related complex of conven- tions, expanding the speaker's response to include what Kant called the mathematical sublime, the sense of infinite space. The second and third stanzas also express the traditional response to the sublime: a sense of " terror " and " horror " that 'In The Central Self (London, 1968) Patricia Ball uses " The Wreck " as an example of the "egotistical" Romantic convention of self coalescing with object (p. 2924), though in her The Science of Aspects (London, 1971) she also considers Hopkins a relatively objective poet (pp. 133 if.). Louis Martz invokes the con- ventions of meditative poems in The Poetry of Meditation (New Haven', 1962), pp. 321-926. Bender suggests the relevance of Pindar's poetic methods (pp. 71-96). Many critics, including Pick, McNamee, Downes, and Heuser, have emphasized parallels between the poem and The Spiritual Exercises of St. Ignatius. Johnson has suggested that the nervous self-revelation in " The Wreck " makes it a Victorian version of religious poetry (p. 24); Alison Sulloway regards it as a Victorian Apocalypse in Gerard Manley Hopkins and the Victorian Temper (London, 19792), pp. 158-96. 108 " The Wreck of the Deutschland r"</page><page sequence="4">is unusually personal (note the prominent position of the '" I '") because the self is " astrain" with the effort to preserve itself in the face of annihilating infinity. In the more " objective " account of the shipwreck the passengers of the ship share this " horror of height Ias they fall from the shrouds " to the deck / (Crushed them) or water (and drowned them)." Psalm 54 (AV 55), to which Hopkins alludes in addressing his heart as dovewinged, expresses the ultimate source of this horror, the fear of death and infinite time: " My heart is troubled within me: and the fear of death is fallen upon me. Fear and trembling are come upon me and darkness hath covered me. And I said: Who will give me wings like a dove, and I will fly and be at rest? . I waited for him that hath saved me from pusillanimity of spirit, and a storm." The speaker's personal " fear and trem- bling" is made public in the wailing, shaking, and quailing of the passengers in that " frightful " night. Besides this conven- tional response, the direct representation of God, the proselytizing, and the emphasis on darkness at the expense of color and form in the poem are also characteristics of the traditional represen- tation of the " sublime " in nature. If we consider "' The Wreck of the Deutschland " as, among other things, a response to the sublime, all these features share a special interdependency as parts of a traditionally consistent approach to nature. We may thereby perceive a principle of unity which connects many features not fully assimilated by pre- vious models. The traditional psychology of man's response to the sublime also provides a somewhat more specific modus operandi for the poem, a kind of inner logic which suggests, as early as the second stanza, the presence of what Hopkins called " that dramatic quality by which what goes before seems to necessitate and beget what comes after." Moreover, the literary tradition of man's response to the sublime in nature supplies so many precedents for heightened emotion that Hopkins' intensity should no longer seem so " abnormal " as to require external bio- graphical explanation. Placing the poem in the context of the literature of the sublime does not exclude perceiving it in terms of other contexts and conventions, for the poetry of the sublime in nature could be defined as a species of the Romantic, the 5 Citations from The Bible are to the Douay version that Hopkins would have used. References for the Authorized Version are put in parentheses. Jerome Bump 109</page><page sequence="5">meditative, the religious, even the Ignatian lyric in that it deals specifically with the idea of infinity. Yet this kind of more precise definition enables us to move beyond vague statements about the coalescence of subject and object to a consideration of why and how Hopkins realizes the storm "so vividly that he is in it, and it is at the same time in him." 6 Reading the poem as a response to the sublime also puts our suspicion of an " unresolved dualism " in the poem, and the re- lated sense of sharp breaks with the works which precede and follow it, in a significantly different context. " The Wreck of the Deutschland " is seen as a movement in Hopkins' literary career parallel to the historical movement which led to the cult of the sublime: the transition from the ideal of limited, propor- tioned beauty to the ideal of the irregular, the infinitely great. This ability to switch from the beautiful to the sublime in nature is a capacity which not only James Thomson, Gray, and Thomas Warton developed, but which Byron, Shelley, Emily Brontei, George Eliot, Meredith and others in the nineteenth century had also cultivated. Hopkins' accession to it allowed him to achieve that depth and range of feeling, thought, and technique which makes his mature poetry so much more successful than his earlier work. II Four conventions associated with the pervasive invocations of the sublime in the poem-the direct representation of a present God, the evocation of terror and dread, the unusually personal response, and the choice of darkness for the setting-will be ex- amined in turn, but first two basic assumptions must be dis- cussed: (1) that the appreciation of dynamic forces and energies in nature, especially of ocean storms, is as much a response to the sublime as is the more familiar admiration of immeasurable heights and infinite vastness, and (2) that the conventions of the sublime were still current and accessible in Hopkins' day. In order to validate these assumptions and, more importantly, to define more clearly the theoretical context of sublimity, we need to review briefly the role of the ocean storm in the tradition of the sublime and extend the tradition to include the nineteenth as well as the eighteenth century. 6 F. R. Leavis, New Bearings in English Poetry (London, 1954), p. 176. 110 " The Wreck of the Deutschland "</page><page sequence="6">Kant was one of the first critics to distinguish clearly between thoughts of infinity prompted by immense size and those sug- gested by moments of absolute, overwhelming power in nature. He called the first mnathernatisch-erhabenen, the mathematically sublime, and identified it as a feeling arising when the size of an object is so great that the imagination cannot grasp it and thus experiences a sense of the infinite. He called the second dcyna'misch-erhabenen, the dynamically sublime, and discussed it under the heading " Von der Natur als einer Macht," defining Macht as a poxver which is superior to all obstacles. In the dy- namic sublime it is nature's expressions of poxver, such as storms and the ocean rising with rebellious force, which lead to a sense of the infinite in man and nature. Of course this appreciation of the sublimity of the great forces of nature existed long before Kant gave it a name. In the Hellenic tradition it can be traced as far back as Homer. Longinus was apparently the first critic to use the word we translate as " sub- lime" to describe literary response, and he may have been the first to associate the word with nature's destructive force. He noted that " by some natural impulse " we prefer to marvel at the ocean rather than at small streams, and he suggests the ulti- mate Hellenic ancestor of " The Wreck of the Deutschland" when he cites the following passage from Homer as a communication of genuine terror: " He fell on them as when a wave falls on a swift ship -/ Violent, made great by the wind, with the storm- clouds above it -/ And the whole ship is buried in spray, and the dread blast of the wind / Roars in the sail, and the sailors quake in their hearts / In terror: for they scud on at but a space out- from-under death." 8 Like the Greeks, the Engflish, from the days of the Wanderer and the Seafarer lays, were great celebrators of the power of the sea. But it was apparently not until the eighteenth century that the ocean storm became a common English example of " the sub- lime " in nature. Addison, in an issue of The Spectator, was one of the first to admit that the ocean affected his imagination more than any other subject: he found it " impossible to describe the agreeable Horrour that rises " from the sight of the ocean worked 7 g" Critik der Urtheilskraf 1," Immanual Kant's Sammthiche Werke, ed.

This awareness of the power of nature played a role in such early Romantic poems as Wordsworth's " Elegiac Stanzas " and Coleridge's " Dejection: An Ode," but becomes more pervasive in later Romantic poetry. Byron's " Childe Harold," for instance, expresses a desire to become a portion of the tempest, and the famous canto " Roll on, thou deep and dark blue Ocean " (IV. 179) would not be entirely out of place in " The Wreck of the Deutschland." It was Shelley, however, who was most preoc- cupied with the dynamic sublime. His poetic career begins with an exultation in the destructive power of the stormy sea; the speaker of "Alastor " is " rejoicing in the fearful war / Of wave ruining on wave, and blast / Descending. . . ." Shelley's desire both to submit to and identify with this dynamic sublime is evident in " Ode to the West Wind," in which the speaker wishes to be "A wave to pant beneath thy power and share / The im- pulse of thy strength, only less free / Than thou, 0 uncontrol- lable! . . ." It is also present in " To Constantia," in which he desires to be " upborne " by " a tempest swift and strong." In " Lines Written Among the Euganean Hills " he explicitly recog- nizes that the ocean's chastening terror was for him (as it would be for Hopkins) the most sublime image.11 Shelley responded personally, moreover, to an element of the dynamic sublime confronted less directly by previous poets: its almost unavoidable association with death. For Kant this was an essential difference between the sublime and the beautiful: the appreciation of the latter is attended by a feeling of the " The Spectator, ed. D. F. Bond, 5 vols.

Though he was not personally haunted, as Shelley was, by the image of the stormy ocean as a dark and hungry grave, Hopkins, too, confronted the sublime as Thanatos, as Negation. The admiration of force becomes more recognizably a cultural phenomenon with the Victorians. In "Signs of the Times " (1829) Carlyle attacked the late-Romantic worship of the dy- namic sublime as follows: "Beauty is no longer the god it [poetry] worships, but some brute image of strength; which one may well call an idol, for true Strength is one and the same with Beauty, and its worship is also a hymn. The meek, silent Light can mould, create, purify all nature; but the loud Whirlwind, the sign and product of Disunion, of Weakness, passes on, and is forgotten. How widely this veneration for the physically Strong- est has spread itself through Literature, any one may judge, who reads either criticism or poetry." 12 Though Carlyle is said to have opened Hopkins' age with the cry " Close thy Byron, open thy Goethe," he is typical of many Victorians-including on oc- casion even Hopkins-in that, for all his preaching, he seemed much more like a loud Whirlwind than a silent Light. The very writings which denounce Byronism are so riddled with venera- tions of " Strength " and " Force " that these seem his normative words. In "Goethe " (1828) he both identifies Byron as the strongest "powerman," the wildest example of the "Kraftmainner" in Europe, and denounces him as sentimental, fearful, weak (XXVI, 218). Byron had not too much, but too little Strength and Force for Carlyle. It was Carlyle who predicted that Force would be the destiny of the earth: "For the present ... its path lies toward Hercules, the constellation of Physical Power", (XXVII, 82). The cult of the dynamisch-erhabenen could only have been strengthened by one to whom the harnessing of the " Brute Pri- meval Powers," that is, the sound of Manchester, " the rushing-off of its thousand mills, like the boom of an Atlantic tide," is " sub- lime as Niagara " (XXIX, 181-82). Carlylean veneration of Force continued throughout the Vic- torian period, long past " The Wreck of the Deutschland," sup- 12 The Works of Thomas Carlyle, Edinburgh Edition, 30 vols.

Jerorme Bump 113</page><page sequence="9">ported by the adulation of physical strength in British public schools, by the dominant myths of national and racial superiority, by patriarchal Puritanism and muscular Christianity, by social Darwinism and laissez-faire capitalism. The major poets-Tenny- son, Browning, and Arnold-though influenced by it in various ways, reveal little sympathy for the Byronic or Shelleyan repre- sentation of the sublime of storm,'3 but the novelists frequently adapted the dynamic sublime to their purposes, as in the repre- sentation of the ocean in Martin Chuzzlewit (XV), the flood in The Mill on the Floss (7.V), the storm in The Ordeal of Richard Feverel (XLII), and the selection of the stormy ocean to sym- bolize the terror Jane Eyre experienced. More importantly, Ruskin, Carlyle's successor as reigning prophet and a profound influence on Hopkins, was a great admirer of the force and power of nature and of the ocean in particular. The word " power," frequently in association with " sublime," recurs throughout the chapter "Of Water" in Volume I of Modemrn Panters, which Hopkins listed under " Books to be Reade" in 1865.14 Ruskin dramatizes waves "in their utmost pitch of power, velocity, vastness, and madness" as in this pas- sage: " the whole surface of the sea became one dizzy whirl of rushing, writhing, tortured, undirected rage, bounding, and crash- ing, and coiling in an anarchy of enormous power . . . giving in every direction the mighty undulation of impetuous line which glides over the rocks and writhes in the wind, overwhelming the one, and piercing the other with the form, fury, and swiftness of a sheet of lambent fire." 15 "Tennyson's "'On Sublimity," for instance, though proclaiming "I love your voice, ye echoing winds . . . When the veil / Of darkness rests upon the mighty deep, / The labouring vessel, and the shatter'd sail- / Save when the forked bolts of lightning leap / On flashing pinions, and the mariner pale / Raises his eyes to heaven," was an adolescent experiment which produced no recognizable successors. Similarly, such lines of Arnold's as " Blow ye winds! lift me with you! / I come to the wind, fold closely, 0 Nature / Thine arms round thy child " (" Switzerland 2, Parting ") represent more a general longing for a lost intimacy with nature than an invocation of the sublime.

In "The Harbours of England " Ruskin perceives the influence of Turner's observation of a shipwreck even in Turner's depiction of calm sea subjects (XIII, 43-45). He cites " Lord Yarborough's Shipwreck" as an instance of Turner's strength in " Terror 'I and states that " the most important" of Turner's last plates is " one of the body of a drowned sailor, dashed against a vertical rock in the jaws of one merciless, immeasurable wave" (XIII, 48, 53). His most famous celebration of a Turner work, however, occurs at the end of the chapter " Of Water " in Modern Painters; of Turner's " Slave Ship " Ruskin said, " if I were reduced to rest Turner's immortality upon any single work, I should choose this . . . the whole picture is dedicated to the most sublime of subjects and impressions . . . the power, majesty, and deathfulness of the open, deep, illimitable sea" (III, 572-73). The power and deathfulness of the ocean, especially as expressed in the wrecking of a ship, was thus viewed as the most " sublime " of subjects not long before Hopkins recorded his response to the wreck of the Deutschland. Disaster at sea was a subject that fascinated the public general- ly and Hopkins' family in particular (his father's business was marine insurance). Hopkins, however, was primarily interested in the idea of writing about the wreck of the Deutschland because the base conduct of many Englishmen in the rescue operation had raised important questions about the moral and religious charac- ter of the nation. Hopkins' renunciation of poetry in 1868 and the presence of only four brief references to God in more than a hundred pages of nature description in his Journal suggests that he had never found a way to use his approach to the beautiful in nature to further his religious aims. The accounts of the storm, however, probably reminded him that the literature of the sub- lime in nature traditionally offered many opportunities for ser- mons on the immediate presence of God, and he perceived the possibility of a theodicy which would counter the growing sense of the disappearance of God among the Victorians. For Hopkins, seeing more clearly than ever before the proselytic possibilities of literature, his Rector's suggestion that someone write a poem about the wreck became the catalytic theological sanction he needed to begin a reconciliation of his religious and poetic voca- tions. Jerome Bump 115</page><page sequence="11">Hence the most important aspect of the literature of the sub- lime for Hopkins was its traditional association of nature's sub- limity with God's sublimity, a connection as old as The Book of Job and dating in English literature from Gray's response to the Alps: " Not a precipice, not a torrent, not a cliff, but is pregnant with religion and poetry. There are certain scenes that would awe an atheist into belief, without the help of other argu- ment. . . ." 1 Hopkins' first line, " Thou mastering me," invokes what was for him the most significant convention of the sublime: direct representation of a present God. This convention is found in a wide variety of eighteenth-century examples of the literature of the sublime ranging from The Seasons to The Mysteries of Udoipha, and the Romantic poets continued to be prompted by sublime scenes in nature to speculate about some at least quasi- religious, infinite Presence. Byron chose the ocean as the sublime image of this Presence: " Thou glorious mirror, where the Al- mighty's form / Glasses itself in tempests . . . boundless, endless, and sublime / The image of eternity, the throne of the Invis- ible." 17 The Victorians maintained this link between the dynamic sublime and God. The heroine of The Mill on the Floss, for instance, driven out upon the "immeasurable" flood, feels the full fury of the destructive forces of nature that her generation had forgotten and experiences that " awful visitation of God which her father used to talk of." 18 Even Charles Darwin felt that " the sense of sublimity " in nature was " intimately connected with a belief in God." '9 Thus, for Hopkins the representation of the sublime in nature, especially the ocean storm, offered a tried and proven means of communicating that immediate sense of the power of a present God which was disappearing in his own genera- tion. Another convention of the representation of the sublime in nature, the emphasis on terror and dread, also served Hopkins' proselytic purposes. He wanted not only to inculcate a sense of God's presence, but especially to call upon that fear of a destruc- tive God which the religious liberals of the time wished to forget. 16 Letters, ed. D.

Hopkins, however, was apparently inspired by the nun's fate to bring back both the Old Testament giant God and the God of the dynamic sublime. A God with a frowning face lashed the poet with his rod and " Trod / hard down " on him in stanzas two and three. In stanza ten he becomes the fiery blacksmith God of Job 41: 10-12 (AV 19-21), Psalm 17 (AV 18), and Blake's " The Tyger " who pounds his victim on an anvil and " with fire in him " forges his will. More frequently he is Orion the hunter (21) who with his dogs, the gnashing elements and the " endragoned " seas, drives his " prey " to its last resort where, "dogged in den," it is " at bay." This anthropomorphic giant God is " fetched in the storm of his strides" (33): he is merged with the God of the dynamic sublime. His " finger," for instance, which in the first stanza the speaker " feels " and " finds again" is, among other things, the instrument of his power and authority, as in Exodus 8: 19, 31: 18, and Luke 11: 20, and as Hopkins revealed in his play, " St. Wine- fred's Well," the dynamic sublime was for him manifestation of the finger of God. Hopkins said of the villain of his play, "Caradoc is to die impenitent, struck by the finger of God," 21 and Caradoc is struck by lightning: " airy vengeances / Are afoot; heaven- vault fast purpling portends, and what first lightning / Any in- stant falls means me " (b30-32) . Hopkins invokes this lightning associated with God's finger in the second stanza of " The Wreck of the Deutschland " and calls upon both the dynamic sublime and the " giant" God in subsequent stanzas. This bold identification of God with the dynamic sublime, while customary in the literature of the dynamic sublime, distinguishes " The Wreck of the Deutschland " from most theodicies. Unlike traditional apologists Hopkins refuses to explain disaster as either the absence of God or the presence of some negative power which resists God. Nor does he allow an act of the victims of the dis- aster to be labeled as its cause. He makes an extraordinary effort 20 See John Edward Keating, The Wreck of the Detutschland: An Essay and Commentary (Kent, 1963), p. 24. 21 The Letters of Gerard Manley Hopkins to Robert Bridges, ed. Claude Colleer Abbott (London, 1935; rpt. 1955), p. 212. Cf. Keating, p. 56. Jerome Bump 117</page><page sequence="13">to represent the storm as the sole cause of the wreck and then he identifies that storm with God. If a cause of the wreck were to be assigned from a reading of the newspaper accounts it would probably be the captain's errors or the breaking of the pro- peller.22 Hopkins, however, wanted to present nature as the cause rather than any error of man or his machines. Hence, despite testimony that the " wind was right astern " and they were drift- ing slowly when they struck,23 he wrote " she drove in the dark to leeward " in order to suggest that the wind, " Sitting Eastnorth- east, in cursed quarter" (13), actually drove the ship onto the shoal. Other details in stanza fourteen similarly represent the storm as actively destroying the ship. Moreover, the line " they shook in the hurling and horrible airs" (15) and the question " what could he do, / With the burl of the fountains of air, buck, and the flood of the wave?" (16) strengthen the reader's sense of the storm as the sole cause of the wreck. Hopkins then identi- fies this storm with God in such phrases as "Thy terror" (2), " Thou art lightning" (9), and " God's cold" (17), leading up to the climactic recognition of the identity in the twenty-eighth stanza. This God who is identified with the dynamic sublime and destructive nature is not simply the anthropomorphic " giant " God of the Old Testament. Hopkins' delight in the paradoxical simultaneity of opposites is central to " The Wreck of the Deutschland"; as a theodicy it is an attempt to show that the Old Testament God and the New Testament God are one and the same and that this one God is present in both destructive and beautiful nature. Hopkins suggests the benevolence of the Old Testament God as well as his terror in his allusion to Psalm 90:4 (AV 91:4) (" under his wings thou shalt trust ") in stanzas 22 The inquest and the reporters were primarily interested in explanations " beyond that which the snow storm may supply."

The flesh-flower imagery of Stanza eleven, for in- stance, incorporates I Peter 1: 24 as well as Isaiah 40:6-8 and the allusion to the great flood in stanza thirty-three is to 1 Peter 3: 19-20. A " dooms-day dazzle " evokes Christ's terrible Second Coming (cf. 2 Peter 3: 5-7) which is supported by the scroll, seal, and lamb imagery (21-23) reminiscent of Revelations and its representation of Christ as the God of destructive nature. This willingness to identify the dynamic sublime and destruc- tive nature with Christ is one of the primary differences between " The Wreck of the Deutschland " and a more typically Vic- torian theodicy such as " In Memoriam." Though Tennyson's invocation bears some resemblance to stanzas two and eleven of Hopkin's poem, he usually addresses only the merciful Christ, the one who resurrected Lazarus. Hence, in " In Memoriam" as in most other traditional theodicies, God and Nature are "at strife." Hopkins, however, because he can affirm both the resur- rection of Lazarus and the great flood, finds that God and Nature are in the closest of unions.24 As his use of two of the conventions of the dynamic sublime, the direct representation of a present God and the evocation of terror and dread suggests, Hopkins' poem was a professional, proselytizing response to a religious crisis. Hence, Hopkins' speaker is more confident and certain of his be- liefs and as a result his theodicy is more compact and unified. Many readers would add the qualification, however, that Hop- kins' emotional response is not as ably motivated as Tennyson's and he is less able to find correlatives for his feelings. Respond- ing to this criticism, most critics have looked beyond the im- mediate occasion of the poem for Various experiences in Hopkins' life which would explain its emotional intensity. The " walls, altar and hour and night" of the second stanza, for instance, have been assigned to various conversion experiences, and the frequency of such conversions or renewals of conversion in Hop- 24 In this sense Tennyson's line " Well roars the storm to those that hear / A deeper voice across the storm" (CXXVI1I) seems more appropriate to " The Wreck of the Deutschland " than to "In Memoriam." Tennyson of course admitted that " Thou pratest here where thou are least, / This faith has many a purer priest, / And many an abler voice than thou " (XXXVII). Hopkins' voice may seem abler than Tennyson's simply because he was a purer priest. Jerome Bump 119</page><page sequence="15">kins' life has been demonstrated.25 All this is unnecessary, how- ever, if we take seriously the spiritual experience suggested by the title, dedication, and second stanza: the attempt to overcome terror at the felt recognition of potentially infinite destruction, suffering, and death in the world of a supposedly benevolent God. That the experience of meditating more deeply than ever before on the infinity of destructive power in God should resemble, even recall, previous conversion experiences would be only natural. Yet, if the desire to justify the ways of God to man is sufficient to account for the emotions of, say, the Book of Job, surely it will do for " The Wreck of the Deutschland " as well. A more serious objection is the complaint that Hopkins' re- sponse does not fully objectify his feelings and hence remains too personal, too private. When we consider such problems of ex- pression, however, we must take into account what Hopkins was trying to express. Identifying the " infinite air " with God, the destructive power was perceived as illimitable. Perceiving why the literature of the sublime might be appropriate to his proselytic intentions, Hopkins was still faced with the question of how to represent this infinity, how to express the inexpressable. Stanza twenty-eight dramatizes this problem, recreating Hopkins' futile search for correlatives for the nun's discovery of the infinite in the finite, the presence of God in the storm: " How shall I . make me room there: / Reach me a . . . Fancy, come faster." The " Fancy " for Hopkins included the ability of the mind to make appropriate comparisons,26 to find correlatives, but his fancy fails him and all he can do is ask the reader himself to imagine God's infinite presence: " Strike you the sight of it? look at it loom there,/ Thing that she. . . ." He cannot even select one name for God's sublimity, because no single title is sufficient: " the Master, / Ipse, the only one, Christ, King, Head." He finds that he, like so many Old Testament prophets, has reached the limits of language, has confronted something that is "Beyond 25 See James Cotter, "'Altar and Hour' in 'The Wreck of the Deutschland,'" PLL, 5, No. I (Winter, 1969), 73-80. W. A. M. Peters suggests that " The Wreck of the Deutschland " is an " unusually personal " poem because of the general hard- ship and weariness of the years preceding it; see Gerard Manley Hopkins (Oxford, 1948), pp. 42-45. Schneider accounts for the " somewhat abnormal personal intensity of the poem " by suggesting that a real miracle occurred, that Christ actually appeared in person to the nun, pp. 19, 26 ff. 2 Robert Boyle, S.

The problem is a common one in the literature of the sublime. Kant argued that the idea of infinity is to be located in the mind and objects only excite and call this idea into the mind. Thus while natural objects may be beautiful, they are never sublime, for no object is limitless, infinite, absolutely great. Kant's ex- ample, incidentally, was the ocean agitated by storm: it could be called horrible but not sublime for the sense of sublimity was simply a product of a specific personal response on the part of the observer (93). In other words, perception of the sublimity of nature depends far more on the perceiver than the object, as Burke's description of a flood in Dublin aptly illustrates: " It gives me great pleasure to see nature in these great though terrible scenes. It fills the mind with grand ideas and turns the soul in upon itself." 27 Along with such " grand ideas " as the proximity of nature's sublimity to God's, Hopkins had to accept another convention of the literature of the sublime: the soul turning in upon itself, the unusually personal response. Unable to find satisfactory correlatives for an almost inconceivable limit- lessness of power, he found his best evidence of it to be simply his personal experience of it. Generally in his poems and invariably in his Journal he preferred to objectify more fully his response to nature. Nevertheless, con- fronted with the sublime, many conventions of Romanticism and Christianity would have encouraged him to reveal his inner world. The Romantics' belief in genuine personal feeling, the heart, as the only true source of inspiration, their conception of the central self as modifying consciousness, and their focus on empirical ex- perience and autobiographical authority as a form of proof, com- bined with the Christian beliefs in personal suffering as the wayr to the most profound communion with Christ and in establishing your qualifications (being an example to your flock) before proselytizing, would have facilitated the personal response necessitated by his confrontation with the sublime. Thus, realizing that the only real corollary to the idea of infinity he is trying to communicate is within him, Hopkins begins " The 27A. P. I. Samuels, The Early Life, Correspondence and Writing3 of Edmund Burke (Cambridge, 1923), p. 84. Cf. Monk, p. 87. Jerome Bump 121</page><page sequence="17">Wreck of the Deutschland " not with an attempt to represent the storm but with the most persuasive evidence, his response, and continually shifts back to it even when attempting to recreate the wreck itself. The first three words of the poem summarize the situation: "Thou mastering me." The reason for this " me " and the numerous other first-person singular pronouns throughout the poem is " Thou " seen in His aspect of the infinite " I AM i" that overmasters, overwhelms the finite " I, and drives it in upon itself. Hopkins' soul, like Burke's, turns in upon itself and he addresses his own heart: " My heart, but you were dovewinged, I can tell " (3), " Ah, touched in your bower of bone.. . . heart ... Why, tears! is it? " (18). In place of correlatives for the idea of infinity itself, Hopkins relies on immediate dramatization of his and the nun's responses, flashbacks, and other genetic explanations of their " heart-throe, birth of a brain." These dramatizations are based on the belief that " tho' he is under the world's splendour and wonder, / His mystery must be instressed, stressed " (5) . The verb " stress " meant for Hopkins " the making a thing more, or making it markedly what it already is " (L 179), and "i nstress" on the simplest level means here to stress within the self. Hence the idea is first to emphasize the mystery within the self, make it more in the soul, then to emphasize it outwardly, to make it more in the outside world. Parts I and II correspond to this sequence, which is also repeated in smaller movements within both parts. This " stressing" required that Hopkins transform his word- painting technique into a means of dramatization. In " The Wreck of the Deutschland" Hopkins takes the adjectival tech- niques of his Journal and uses them to " instress " his own inner world, to represent his feelings in such dramatic terms as lashed, sifted, mined, roped, and glowing. He also " stresses" or drama- tizes the inner world of others as anvil-forged, heart-wrung, trenched with tears, carved with cares, and intensifies the sweep, hurl, and hurtle of the dynamic sublime and actual wrecking of the ship. This stressing or (if you will) exaggeration, is quite obvious in stanza thirteen which represents the ship as " Hurling the haven behind" and in stanza fourteen which represents it as driving to leeward and beating the bank down with her bows. However it is not so much this kind of " stressing " in the poem as the " instressing," the dramatization of the inner world with 122 " The Wreck of the Deutschland "</page><page sequence="18">its exclamation marks, interpolated " oh's," and searching for words that results in the charge of unmotivated emotional in- tensity. Comparing the poem to the previous literature of the sublime we feel less of a discrepancy between the emotion and its repre- sented cause, we can more easily account for the emotional in- tensity within the poem itself. The " me A of the first line and the emphasis on the personal throughout the poem is to some ex- tent necessitated by the confrontation with the infinite and justified by various conventions of Romanticism and Christianity. Yet, it should also be remembered that the " me " metamorphoses into a more generally proselytizing voice, that it is but one of a number of voices in the poem. "The Wreck of the Deutsch- land " is a " madrigal" or " glee" (18), a polyphonic song of three parts-the autobiographical, the narrative, and the ser- monical (as in Sartor Resartus) -singing in canon, repeating and amplifying the theme provided by a fourth voice, the nun's. 2S Shifts from one voice to another are sometimes quite evident; the first transition from autobiographical to sermonical, for in- stance, is begun in stanza five, as the speaker turns from his inner world to the outer world, and completed in stanza six, when the first person singular disappears altogether, replaced by the parenthetical interjections of a preacher to " the faithful " and the " faithless." Though there is a great deal of counterpoint and imitation, the basic sermonical movement is to higher and higher levels of generalization, a movement summarized by the echoes set up by the iteration of the word "flash." It is first used to describe Hopkins' own recognition and acceptance of Christ's mercy: his heart did " flash from the flame to the flame then" (3). It reappears in the representation of how any heart, upon acceptance of Christ, will be flushed and will be " in a flash, full " (8). Finally, it reappears at the conclusion in which Christ's appearance to all men is a " released shower, let flash to the shire" (34). Each time the word recurs it represents an increas- ing level of generalization, another step from the personal to the universal, yet it still echoes the personal experience. This recurrent emphasis on personal experience customary in 28See J. Hillis Miller, The Disapearance of God (New York, 1965), p. 319; and John Ferns, " 'The Wreck of the Deutschland': Voice and Structure," VP, 9, No. 4 (Winter, 1971), 383-94. Jerome Bump 123</page><page sequence="19">responses to the sublime nevertheless distinguishes " The Wreck of the Deutschland" from the far more objective writing which immediately preceded it in Hopkins' Journal. Another convention of the representation of the sublime, the attraction to darkness, even more sharply differentiates the poem from the Journal. Hop- kins not only rejects the impersonal stance of the Journal, he abruptly abandons the painterly sensibility which dominated it. The " poet whose verse is more filled with joy in light than any other among the Victorians" (Johnson, p. 57), whose Journal records a painterly love of color and sharply delineated forms, gives us a black canvas. Though a full day occurred between the wreck that Hopkins represents in stanza fourteen and the night he represents in stanza fifteen, his seascape is darkness, there is nothing but the " black-about" air and the " black-backed " sea. The only natural illumination is the " electrical horror " of light- ning and the rockets and lightships, fitful flashes quickly swal- lowed up in night. With the exception of one painterly touch, a description of the snow as " Wiry and white-fiery and whirlwind- swivelled " inspired, I suspect, by Turner's " Steamer in a Snow- storm," more is heard than seen. " Night roars " in the sounds of the storm bugling thunder, the drum of death, the " woman's wailing, the crying of child without check," and our attention is directed to the voice of the tall nun like a bell ringing the poor sheep back and to the many voices of the poet himself. This emphasis on sound rather than sight is, like the darkness itself, one of the conventions of the literature of the sublime. In other words, the absence of the painterly approach to nature in " The Wreck of the Deutschland," is, like the personal response, an example of an effect that is fairly general throughout tradition- al approaches to the sublime in nature. It is " in the night " that the whirlwind carries off its victim in The Book of Job and dark- ness is also closely associated with God's sublimity in Psalm 17: 10-12 (AV 18:9-11), the Biblical undercurrent of stanzas 9 and 10: " He bowed the heavens, and came down: and darkness was under his feet. . . . And he made darkness his cover, his pavilion round about him: dark waters in the clouds of the air." In English literature, night is the chief feature of the settings of the poems of a whole group of poets who flirted with the sublime, the graveyard school, and it recurs in such nineteenth-century examples as Tennyson's " On Sublimity " in which the speaker 124 "r The Wreck of the Deutschland"</page><page sequence="20">cries, "Thy joy is in obscurity, and plain / Is nought with thee; and on thy steps attend / Shadows but half-distinguished." Actual perceptions of the outside world tended to diminish in literary responses to the sublime because when one responded to the sublime what was inside of the self seemed more im- portant than what was outside. Gloom and obscurity were sought because they gave the imagination greater range, freeing it for the attempt to apprehend sublimity, especially the infinity of God. Hence the rhyming of " night " and " horror of height " in Hopkins' second stanza serves a semantic as well as a euphonious function. God's infinite might, even more than his distance, was best imagined in darkness, as Burke's version of Job suggests: "In thoughts from the visions of the night, when deep sleep falleth upon man, fear came upon me and trembling, which made all my bones to shake. Then a spirit passed before my face . . I stood still, but I could not discover the form thereof." 29 Hopkins chose to set his poem in "unshapeable " night (29), rejecting that attention to the forms and limits of objects which charac- terized his approach to the beautiful in his Journal, because he too recognized that sublimity was, as Kant put it, a sensation of formless limitlessness (92). As Burke's version of Job suggests, one of the fears associated with the sense of an infinitely threatening might looming up out of darkness is the fear of total annihilation of the self. Hopkins makes this traditional association explicit in stanza fourteen where night is actually dramatized as the agent of destruction (c night drew her / Dead to the Kentish Knock ") and in stanza thirty-three in which the phrase "&lt;Lower than death and the dark" alludes to a passage about the great flood in Peter's first epistle. Yet, paradoxically, night saves as well as destroys; " thy dark descending" (9) can be " the dark side of the bay of thy blessing " (12). This theme is developed in Psalm 90 (AV 91) alluded to in the " under thy feathers " phrase in stanza twelve (" His truth shall compass thee . . . thou shalt not be afraid of the terror of the night"). The nun does not fear the terror be- cause she can see the truth, though the " brine / Blinds her." Like Paul at his conversion she discovers the light by being blinded. We too are asked to see: "Strike you the sight of it: look at 29A Philosophical Enquiry into the Origin of our Ideas of the Sublime and the Beautiful, ed. J. T. Boulton (London, 1958), p. 63. Cf. Monk, p. 94. Jerome Bump 125</page><page sequence="21">it loom there," but "loom" suggests a distorted or indistinct image and the night is " shock " (heavy) and " unshapeable " (929). We must learn that if we are to see it must be with the mind's eye rather than the natural eye. She sees not the colors of nature but the " scarlet" of Christ's sacrifice (922) and the " fall-gold " of his mercies (23), and the only form to be seen is the nuns' " five-lived and leaved " sacrifice repeating the " cinquefoil " pattern of Christ's " Lovescape crucified " (23) . Ultimately, for Hopkins we and the world are in darkness and we are to " let Christ easter in us, be a dayspring to the dimness of us" (35). We are asked to see Christ as the Light of the World, not with the natural eye as in Holman Hunt's painting, but with the " single eye " of the spiritual imagination. III Hopkins shares a great deal with his predecessors in the literary tradition of the sublime: his attraction to great destructive forces, his direct representation of God in nature, his evocation of terror and dread, his unusually personal response, and his choice of darkness as a setting. Yet he differs from most of them in the way he responds to God and nature in the poem. In general, as Kant suggested, the response to the sublime in nature was ulti- mately an exaltation of the self, a discovery of a capacity for a sublimity in the self corresponding to, if not transcending, that of nature. Even in the case of the representation of God in a storm, though Kant recognizes that the religious response is usually prostration and submission, he argues that the percep- tive observer will recognize a sublimity in himself corresponding to that of God's and will thus be raised above the operations of nature (111). Hopkins' response, however, is a complex mixture of submission and exaltation that is basically not this deification of self associated with Romanticism but the denial of self associ- ated with Victorian Christianity. In theological terms, Hopkins and the tall nun respond to three different kinds of grace: afflictive, elective, and sacramental.30 The general archetype for their response is " Our passion-plunged giant risen," Christ. Afflictive and elective grace are both associ- ated with Christ's downward movement, his plunging into pas- 80 Alan Heuser, The Shaping Vision of Gerard Manley Hopkins (New York, 1968), p. 44. 16 " The Wreck of the Deutschlandd"</page><page sequence="22">sionate submission, but elective grace is ultimately associated also with his rising, a transcending movement similar in some ways to the traditional response to the sublime. When these two responses have been instressed within the self, they are stressed, " uttered . . . outright," in response to sacramental grace. This is the basic movement of " The Wreck of the Deutschland " and, in the tradition of the Victorian prophets, Hopkins repeats it several times from different perspectives and levels of generaliza- tion 31 much as, say, Carlyle's tripartite movement of negation, indifference, and affirmation is repeated in Sartor Resartus. The first element in this pattern is the iteration of the " afflic- tive " fall, the descent of Christ's sacrificial incarnation, the plung- ing into passion of the giant God. In Part I, first of all the poet himself is " trod / Hard down" with the horror of the sublime and his heart swoons. Then he flees " with a fling of the heart to the heart of the Host'" (3). This represents not an attempt to escape from suffering but a desire, in response to elective grace, to imitate Christ's decision to accept suffering and transform it into a conscious sacrifice; the poet focuses on the fall of Christ's " frightful sweat," his submission in a " dense and driven Passion ' to the afflictions of suffering and death (7). Finally, we are given the example of St. Paul's prostration, his falling to the ground before the thundrous " crash " and flash of the lightning of God (10) . In Part II, the theme recurs as the dense and driven snow " Spins to the widow-making unchilding unfathering deeps " (13) and the passengers fall from the rigging into the sea or onto the deck (15-17). This downward movement toward sub- mission is then repeated in the fall of the speaker's tears (18) and in his ultimate surrender in which he asks God to cure the ex- tremity where he had " cast" her by triumphantly riding down her pride (28). Finally the "heaven-flung," " passion-plunged " Christ is called upon to descend upon England as a released shower (34). Throughout Hopkins repeatedly emphasizes that the proper response is not the self-exaltation traditional in the literary re- sponses to the sublime but the submissive prostration, the total " In Part I, the first three stanzas show Hopkins' personal version of it, stanzas 4 to 8 interpret it on higher levels of generalization, and the last fifth of Part I, stanzas 9 to 10, summarize it. In Part II, stanzas 11 to 17 represent the movement in the nun, 18 to 929 interpret it from various perspectives, and 30 to 35, the last fifth of Part II, summarize it. Jerome Bump 127</page><page sequence="23">surrender demanded by St. Ignatius. He explicitly denies the possibility that the nun was " asking for ease," the response of the Apostles to the great sea storm of Genesareth (one of the few instances of the dynamic sublime in the gospels) (25), and he specifically rejects the idea that her response was essentially the transcendental upward movement of ascetic idealism (26). Rather, her response is seen as the "love in her of the being as her lover had been " (25), a desire to be as Christ was in the garden of Gethsemane when he said, " Father . . not my will, but thine, be done." This response is radically different from the one Kant described, yet, paradoxically, some elements of the traditional response to the sublime are retained. Obviously there is a literal transcen- dence of nature in Christ's resurrection and ascension into heaven, a pattern the nun repeats in that after having been " passion- plunged" and finally drowned, she is represented as having "risen" into the " heaven-haven of the reward." More importantly, be- sides this literal ascension, Hopkins associates the decision to imitate Christ with a sense of exaltation and upward movement as well as with a falling movement. He represents his own elec- tion, for instance, as his whirling out wings " that spell " so that he could " tower'" from the grace to the grace. The phrase " that spell " means basically " that moment," but the connotation of " spell " as a North Wales variant of " speel " meaning " to mount or ascend to a height 82 is not inappropriate. This sensation of towering upward is explained in one of Hopkins' comments on the operation of grace. Though it is usually misleading to quote from Hopkins' late notes on Ignatius' spiritual exercises to explicate his earlier poems, the last sentence of the following comment justifies its use: " grace which is elevating, which lifts the receiver from one cleave of being to another and to a vital act in Christ: this is truly God's finger touching the very vein of personality . . . the aspiration in answer to his inspiration. Of this I have written above and somewhere else long ago." 83 The " long ago " may well have been in " The Wreck of the Deutsch- land " where the nun as well as the poet " towered in the tumult" and both were lifted up, elevated to a vital act in Christ. 82 Sister Mary Adorita, B.

Nevertheless the exaltation that Hopkins and the nun experience is essentially different from that described by Kant. The transcending upward movement in their version of the sublime, the sense of " the passion-plunged giant as finally "risen,' is essentially a response to Christ's mercy given only after the supplicant has denied himself, submitted completely and utterly to the mastery of God and the dynamic sublime. Hence Hopkins' version of the sublime should be called the s sac- rificial sublime " in order to suggest that it is modelled less on the Hellenic version in Longinus than on the Hebraic version in The Book of Job.
