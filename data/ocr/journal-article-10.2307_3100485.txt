<plain_text><page sequence="1">New York, Whitney Museum of American Art The New Sculpture 1965-75 The New Sculpture 1965-75: Between Geo- metry and Gesture, (to 20th May; film and video to 3rd June)' is a part-loan, part permanent collection exhibition of ninety works by ten American sculptors, selected by Richard Armstrong and Richard Mar- shall. 'Postminimalist' art, as seen here, has done for sculpture what Abstract Ex- pressionism did for painting. What links Eva Hesse's fibreglass and Richard Serra's splashed lead with Richard Tuttle's can- vases and Bruce Nauman's Double steel cage, a cage within a cage large enough for a slim spectator to enter, is concern with process. Unlike the Minimalists, such art- ists as Lynda Benglis, Barry Le Va and Richard Smithson (Fig. 113) did not pro- duce polished objects, but displayed the activities of sculpting. They all wanted to break radically with tradition. And yet, after a quarter of a century, their sculptures no longer look shocking. Like much revo- lutionary art, they have become classics. Nor do all these artists continue to deal with processes. The contrast here of Joel Shapiro's tiny cast iron pieces to his large quasi-anthropomorphic sculptures in last year's Whitney Biennial, shows that this development, however inevitable, does not yield better art. What remains revolutionary 377</page><page sequence="2">EXHIBITION REVIEWS 112. Cutting device: base plate measure, by Richard Serra. 1969. Lead, wood, stone and steel, c.30.5 by 549 by 477 cm. (Museum of Modern Art, New York; exh. Whitney Museum of American Art, New York). 113. Red sandstone corner piece, by Robert Smithson. 1968. Mirrors and sandstone, 121.9 by 121.9 by 121.9 cm. (Museum of Art, Philadelphia; exh. Whitney Museum of American Art, New York). 113. 112.1 about this work is its (successful) attempt to be untraditional. One lesson is how various were these artists' concerns, and how variable the quality of their work. As the title Equal quantities: placed or dropped in, out, and on in relation to specific boundaries indicates, Le Va's scatter pieces are not random, but informed by a complex logic, here imposs- ible to reconstruct without his drawings. Tuttle's Wire pieces, hard to reproduce in photographs, also remain radical; Keith Sonnier's Dis-Play merely creates shock, and so becomes simply fatiguing. Serra's Chunk and Cutting device (Fig. 112), unlike his recent work, suggest tentativeness, even vul- nerability; Splash piece: casting, in which a plate is the surface against which lead is splashed, anticipates his monumental work of the 1980s. Hesse's great C-Clamp Blues makes her early death all the more tragic. By contrast, Lynda Benglis's Eat meat, cast in bronze, lacks the charm of her early Planet. Tuttle's self-effacing forms and Nauman's indexical images of the body and works containing the viewer's body are very dif- ferent, equally satisfying sculptures. There is much excellent art in this show, but the installation (on the second and fourth floors of the Museum) is a disaster. Nauman's Green light corridor serves as wall divider separating Smithson's Closed mirror square from the larger room; Tuttle's Light and dark green circle is lost on the floor; and sometimes it is barely possible to walk be- tween works by different artists. No chic SoHo gallery presents such incoherent exhibits. The Whitney's space is not large, but were the permanent collection on the floor between the two parts of this show removed, there would have been enough space for this display. Recreating the effect of work which originally was shocking is hard; Olympia and Autumn rhythm have be- come familiar, and so look beautiful. The special problem here is that reconstruct- ing the works themselves is often difficult. Smithson's sites must be rebuilt; Hesse's fibreglass is disintegrating. They outlive their creators, but since Le Va must break the glass in his pieces, and Serra splash his lead, their works depend upon the artist's presence. The effect is akin to a documentary of 1960s pop music, with young actors play- ing dead or middle-aged figures in staged recreations of what originally were im- provised scenes. Since much of this art was intended to be transitory, to physically reconstruct it, especially in a museum, vio- lates these artists' essential insight about process. Works intended to be informal now seem structured. The viewer who would seek to recapture the original in- tended effect of this art must go elsewhere. The exhibition is a reminder that the 'new sculpture' was important, not only for its high quality, but also because, unlike that of colour field painters and minimalist sculptors, the work of the artists shown here dealt with concerns crucial for the younger generation.2 DAVID CARRIER Carnegie-Mellon University, Pittsburgh 'The New Sculpture 1965-75: Between Geometry and Ges- ture, ed.
