MEYNELL, eds., Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity: A Festschrift for Terence Penelhum. Calgary: University of Calgary Press 1994. Pp. xviii + 304. Terence Penelhum has had a very distinguished career. His work spans a wide range: philosophy of religion, Hume, Butler, and personal iden- tity have been most central. His writings in these areas are models of clear, thoughtful philosophical craftsmanship. His influence has been considerable as a teacher, and he is an extremely effective critic of others' work; his participatory role in conferences, both with his own papers and in his responses to others', has been both a pleasure and a learning experience for anyone, like myself, who has had the good fortune to observe it. Penelhum very certainly merits a Festschrift, and the project of assembling a collection of papers in his honor, on themes that are central for him, has been an extremely good idea. Jack Macintosh and Hugo Meynell deserve high commendation for taking on this task, and for assembling a collection of accomplished essays, together with Penel- hum's responses to them. The result is fourteen distinctive pieces of philosophical writing, concerned for the most part not particularly with Penelhum's own views and arguments as with the topics those views and arguments address. Besides Penelhum himself, the philosophers represented are Kai Nielsen, John Hick, Basil Mitchell, Hugo Meynell, Annette Baier, Alasdair Maclntyre, Antony Flew, David Fate Norton, William Lyons, Andrew Brennan, Geoffrey Madell, P.T. Herbert, and JJ. Macintosh. Apart from shared focus on what has interested one prominent con- temporary philosopher, there are only a few dominant notes to remark upon for the collection over all. Perhaps the most striking is the presence of what may be regarded as a specifically British mode of doing (analytic) philosophy in very many of these essays. Special methodologically valorized attention to 'ordinary' thought and language, belief in neces- sary contrasts ('F is incoherent unless there are instances of non-F),</page><page sequence="2">112 Peter Loptson verificationism, and other features of philosophical work one associates with Oxford and Cambridge Universities circa 1935-1975 (or so) appear repeatedly in this volume, in a majority (though not all) of the essays it contains. All fourteen of the volume's essays engage issues of importance and interest, usually in substantial ways. Space limitations prevent my ad- dressing all of them. My comments on those discussed are themselves necessarily selective. I Kai Nielsen's 'Perceiving God' holds that the conception in his essay's title is oxymoronic. Nielsen says that the perceivability of the God of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam 'appears to be incoherent' (4).1 Nielsen writes throughout as though it is prima facie evident that this view is correct, and that some particularly heavy burden of proof is borne by anyone of contrary view. It is surprising, when all three religious tradi- tions do assert that their God is perceivable, in an afterlife as well as on earth, that Nielsen thinks that it is more or less obvious that this is completely unintelligible. The idea of God's perceivability, within Christianity at least, is surely a version or extension of a widespread imaginative idea, found in very many cultures: viz., that of taking on the form or shape of something. Gods or other spirits (some of whom, at least, need not be immaterial) are supposed to be able to take on the form of some natural object, and appear - to the perceptions of humans, for example - as such an object. Metaphysically coherent accounts of shape shifting seem formulable from real cases, like those of transformations from caterpillars to butterflies. If something along such lines works, then there needs to be considered whether an immaterial being could take on material form. This idea is independently critical for Christianity because of the Christian doctrine of the incarnation, which involves precisely this. The heart of the chal- lenge here is surely whether an immaterial being could have causal powers, sufficient to affect other beings, at all. It doesn't seem obvious, one way or the other, whether one could. But if an immaterial being could have such a power in however modest or limited a way, there seems no conceptual difficulty whatever in supposing such abilities magnified indefinitely. If this is right, then there could be a being with as much 1 All page references are to the Macintosh and Meynell volume.</page><page sequence="3">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 1 13 causal power as there seems any reason to see implied by the concept of the Christian God, certainly including a power of taking on material form. In what became the orthodox Christian view, this included a power not merely of taking on and appearing in material form, but of actually being a human being (hence, a power of being a certain kind of physical object). This latter need not be insisted upon for the point at hand, but it will help show how entrenched and central the idea of a possibility of literally perceiving God is for, at least, Christianity; for that is precisely what the apostles are supposed to have been doing when they talked to the historical Jesus. Nielsen seems to think that there would be something about God's transcendence - his being in some sense outside the world - that would prevent this God, at least, from appearing as a particular in a human cognizer's direct experience. Since the Christian (and in this case also the Jewish and Moslem) God is supposed to be simultaneously transcendent and immanent, both the underlying 'ground of all being' (whatever exactly that is supposed to be) and a subject of personal one-on-one relationship with his creations, it is hard to see why this would be so. Now Alston, whom Nielsen is discussing (Alston is Nielsen's chief target throughout this essay), is evidently not thinking of cases where God would take on the appearance of some natural object and be perceived by a human as that object. The idea is supposed to be that the human becomes aware that God is present in an experience, as something of which the human has perceptual awareness, and God was the cause of that perceptual awareness in a manner comparable to that in which a standard physical object will be in normal cases the cause of our percep- tual awareness of it. It is not seriously disputable that there will be real, indeed, grave epistemic difficulties for a perceiver or cognizer with knowing whether, or having justification that, he or she has perceived God, in any kinds of cases in which perception of God is claimed. I am concerned only with the coherence and possibility, or otherwise, of a proposed metaphysical situation. And it seems clear that if an immaterial being could have other-affecting causal powers, then one could have indefinitely enlarged or 'infinite' causal powers, including powers of showing up within some human's perceptual experiences as a perceptible particular. (With infinite power that ought to be quite easy.) Alston's kind of case seems to require only a little extension of this base. We seem able to imagine an experience in which something's presence is felt, focused at a place in our perceptual field. Moreover, a human perceiver /cognizer could become aware of a particular, e.g., God as present in his or her vicinity or field of awareness, where this aware- ness was caused by that particular being present in that vicinity (and not,</page><page sequence="4">114 Peter Loptson say, by a chain of associations within the human's mind independently of the causal action of a particular that was there). (If again, immaterial beings can ever have causal powers to affect others.) And this will be enough to make the kind of case Alston and others like-minded want. The most that Nielsen's case against Alston, and anyone of similar views, seems to come to is that if there were a God, and he were to wish to communicate with a human being, he would need to do so in a way that a human being can be communicated with. Indeed so; no doubt a God would need to do that. And so maybe that would need to involve some kind of agitation of or impress upon our sensory receptors. But Nielsen is supposed to be arguing that there is something quite unintel- ligible about the very idea of a God communicating with or being experienced by a human. So far as I can see, he gets nowhere near showing this. II Annette C. Baier's 'Hume on Religion: Stopping the Ocean with a Bull- Rush?' is an interesting, carefully crafted, imaginatively argued analysis of Hume's History of Natural Religion. It makes a serious and important contribution to the study of that work, and to Hume's complicated views on religion overall. Baier's idea is that Hume is consciously and deliberately studying the history of religion through a set of lenses that are themselves, according to Hume, the motivating forces, the psychological repertoire, that lead to religious phenomena in human life. The relevant emotions are fear and curiosity - self-interested fear and the unquenchable curiosity to know what for humans is unknowable. Hume crafts his work - if Baier is right - so that there will be systematic parallelism between the development of religious phenomena through history and a structure of ideas that dialectically interrelate transformations of fear and curiosity. This is essentially the idea that underlies, and is also by its author made explicit in the New Science of Vico (though Baier does not name him). Many of Hume's works pose challenge for the reader and interpreter as to what Hume thinks he is or means to be doing. The famous argu- ments tend to be reasonably straightforward, and the ongoing flow of his dialectic only a little more opaque, but what purpose - for their author - they serve is, with more than one of the Humean classics, at least oblique, and ground for widely differing construction. The Natural History of Religion is one such work. Baier says that her idea is that Hume is attempting</page><page sequence="5">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 115 to see what happens when we direct upon religion the very forces that it expresses - it is another Humean exercise in "reflection" in its narrow sense, a "return of the soul" of some psychic force, in this case of the drives that Hume finds to be the original principles or sources of religion, where "religion" is taken to mean "ven- eration of such invisible powers as are believed to be affecting human happiness." Hume's own anxious object of concern is the invisible power of religious sentiment itself. His are meta-religious meditations. (62) She goes on to call this a project of religious 'reform/ If I have understood Baier correctly, it seems to me that this account or interpretation just cannot be correct. For whatever else the Natural History of Religion may be, it is a rational inquiry, an investigation or exploration of a widespread human phenomenon; I think, from a natu- ralistic, and primarily a psychological perspective, just as, as I see it, Hume brings to most of his philosophical topics. Baier's account is too sophisticated. However complex Hume's real views (and feelings - not necessarily well aligned with his views) on religion may be, and whether or not he is being fully candid about them in The Natural History of Religion, the position taken in that essay is not as oblique or complex as Baier seems to suppose. That position is essentially the one intellectual history names deism. According to this view some version or other of the argument from design is sound: there is an intelligent author of the world, from whom the natural principles governing events have stemmed. That being, the full detail of whose attributes and purposes is unknown and probably unknowable, does not intervene in the world he has made. Hume's brand of deism holds further that general human irrationality is profound, and together with other negative features of human nature, is responsible for the religions that appear in human societies, which almost never spring from or are affected by serious evidence or argument. One of the offices of philoso- phy is to step back from and set out all of the foregoing, and to furnish those capable of philosophy with ease or tranquillity in the knowledge afforded. Contrary to Baier's claims, there is no evidence from The Natural History of Religion that Hume aims at any sort of reform. Her 'Viconian' reading of Hume also leads her, I think to misread. Hume (and other philosophers) would like, if it were possible, to know the hidden causes of the world and its parts. But the religious impulse, as Hume sees it, involves no such hope, not even what Baier calls a 'thwarted curiosity about remote causes' (66). In Hume's account the barest beginnings of such proto-philosophy are quickly replaced with the imaginative peo- pling of the unknown surrounding world with anthropomorphic pro- jections that will occasion hope and fear. Pace Baier, Humean deism is not (at least as far as Hume is concerned) a religion. The Natural History of Religion is indeed a brilliant and a beautifully written piece of work; without much doubt the best of a genre. Hume is,</page><page sequence="6">116 Peter Loptson I think, only somewhat original in this work. The social psychology of belief that he provides, with a certain proto-Hegelian dialectical analysis of the progressions and regressions he thinks that belief involves (to- gether with intersections with theory) in different forms for polytheistic and monotheistic societies, is subtle, and searching. All of it is guided, as is so much of the Humean analysis in the Treatise, and elsewhere, by Hume's methodological behaviorism: find out the real origins and signifi- cance of some human practice by what those who engage in it actually do, and what purposes it serves in the economy of their circumstances, especially their psychological circumstances. Ill Alasdair Maclntyre's 'Hume, Testimony to Miracles, the Order of Na- ture, and Jansenism' has two separable themes or topics: a fresh exami- nation of Hume on miracles, and a brief for replacing naturalism, in the metaphysics of nature and in the philosophy of science, with the Aristo- telian teleologism that preceded it. The second of these goals is essen- tially the Canute-like desire that the hands of the clock should be turned back; that we should all collectively agree to proceed as though Galileo and his heirs and successors had never lived, nor - as they did - changed both the world and our knowledge of it. Maclntyre's discussion of Hume's famous argument on miracles is fresh, tight, and well-argued. Maclntyre adduces interesting parallels with Hume in Pascal, and plausibly distinguishes a metaphysical com- ponent in Hume's view, and argument, from an epistemological one, noting that the case for the one is independent of the other. I am one reader and admirer of Hume who has never felt the argument on miracles deserved the fame and respect it has received. As Maclntyre points out, the argument readily admits an interpretation that would seem to license rejecting evidence of any significant change from familiar experience. And though Hume himself saw this objection, he does not seem to have thought out a satisfactory basis for meeting it. Moreover, the thrust of the argument seems at odds with the radical contingency of the world, and the impossibility of substantive a priori knowledge of the world, that are otherwise such central features of Humean philosophy. Why might there not come data - including the testimony of others - that might give me rational grounds for rejecting all manner of familiar regularity, even for accepting the reality of world-guiding spirits; in principle, at least? Assuming the problem of induction solved - as Hume generally does in practice, whenever not discussing the problem in its own terms - we are afforded by experience no serious reason at all to expect grounds for such revisions to come our way. But either one</page><page sequence="7">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 117 is serious about one's empiricism, and an a posteriori naturalism, or one is not. Still, it seems to me that there is something further that may be said in advocacy of the value of Hume's argument on miracles, or as an inter- pretation of it. This is on the epistemological side of the ledger. Most moderns (Maclntyre among them) imaginatively conceive the situation of the recipient of testimony about strange doings - the miraculous or apparently such - as one where that recipient is in a very commanding position vis a vis the evidentiary data. He or she can ascertain with very great precision that the source of the testimony is reliable, at any rate certifiably sane and sober and morally honorable, and that that witness's testimony is thorough, clear, unambiguous, with a detail sufficient to respond to any factual query the recipient might have for it. The ground can be gone over again (even if the past not be returned to), and a serious qualified forensic location be achieved by he or she who is weighing the testimony. But even if this is sometimes possible for a twentieth-century inquirer, it will only rather rarely have been so in the eighteenth century or earlier. I think Hume is plausibly taken as asking, what is the individual private citizen, who is endeavoring to be rational, to do, faced with reports or testimony of the apparently miraculous, where the citizen cannot ex- plore the matter with the equivalent of contemporary technological investigative thoroughness? One piece of counsel would be this: sit on the fence, do not decide, or lean, one way or the other; maybe evidence of the overturning of what has been thought the natural order of things, has actually come in. That is not Hume's counsel. His is this: situated as you are, only possibly able to check much of the detail out, weigh the probability that the testimony is mistaken against the probability that the regularity of the natural order known hitherto has been confuted, and the rational belief will be that the former is the greater probability. Sound advice. Hume was right. IV In 'The Legitimation of Factual Necessity,' Antony Flew writes to make a case for, and provide an analysis of, non-logical empirical necessity; case and analysis both couched as emphatically anti-Humean. Flew is insufficiently explicit about the fact that there is a very extensive litera- ture, formal and informal, on his theme. To mention only three promi- nent cases among very many discussions - advocacy discussions - of this family of notions, one might cite C.J. Ducasse's Causation and the Types of Necessity, J.L Mackie's The Cement of the Universe, and G.H. von Wright's 'Natural Modality.'2 (Flew cites Ducasse's book in a subsequent</page><page sequence="8">118 Peter Loptson footnote, but without acknowledgement of his role as a companion in Flew's supposed heterodoxy.) Flew sees Hume as Cartesian. According to Flew, Hume is philosophi- cally 'committed to thinking of himself as an essentially incorporeal subject of consciousness, inescapably trapped behind ... a "veil of ap- pearance'" (104). This seems an odd view to assign to a philosopher who famously denied that he could find experiential evidence for a self, i.e., a subject of consciousness, at all. There are unquestionably commonalities between Cartesian and Humean philosophy. But they deserve detailed and careful investiga- tion, not broad-sweep simplifications of the kind Flew provides. In fact, Hume is insufficiently accorded (and not just by Flew) the justice of being taken seriously for what he himself said his central philosophical work was concerned with, namely, human nature, particularly in so far as it involves 'understanding.' That is to say, Hume is doing (though not this only) what would now be called rational or cognitive psychology. His general methodological approach is operational, or behavioral (where we are to include introspective data as among the observable behavior). And he thinks it is reasonable - and why is it not? - to bracket' issues of the reality, irreality, or objective nature, of the supposed objects of the psychological states he is investigating, in carrying out those investiga- tions. It would be for a metaphysician, not a cognitive psychologist, to pronounce on such matters. In any event, would Flew, or anyone else, want to argue that someone simply cannot study or investigate what may be common to veridical and (in their several degrees) non-veridical experiences, and then explore how it is in fact that states of conviction about object-of-experience veridicality obtain or are arrived at? It is reasonable to hold that an adequate causal account of 'the understanding' and its workings cannot be produced unless, at some point, the brackets are removed and the world, accompanied by suitable assumptions about its nature and doings, enters the story. And it is a valid criticism of Hume's investigations that this does not occur, or occur enough or at the right places. But the focal identification of states of consciousness as both target and anchor of study is entirely legitimate. Flew proceeds to descend to 'ordinary language' critique of the Humean project. One might have thought that such thinking, or the idea that it yields serious argument, had disappeared from the world a few 2 C.J. Ducasse, Causation and the Types of Necessity (Seattle, WA: University of Wash- ington Press 1924); J.L. Mackie, The Cement of the Universe (Oxford: Oxford Univer- sity Press 1974; G.H. von Wright, 'Natural Modality/ in Truth, Knowledge, and Modality (Oxford: Basil Blackwell 1984), ch. 3</page><page sequence="9">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 119 decades ago. Let it be said again that 'ordinary usage' is not a decisive or even a very important guide to what is true about thought and the world. Flew is either unaware of, or deliberately refuses to countenance, a distinction important for approaching Hume, namely, the metaphiloso- phical distinction between a naturalism prepared to revise or jettison common sense semantic-metaphysical intuition, and the view that some core of common sense is unrevisably anchored. Flew adheres to the second of these stances, and doesn't seem to know that Hume is one of the important creative advocates of the first. Hume is both a 'metanatu- ralist' (advocate of the questioning or displacement of the 'manifest image') and a naturalist - someone looking for actual contentful causal accounts of human phenomena that will explain them and integrate them into a wider natural order. One may reject one or both naturalisms; but it is not reasonable to write as though Hume, or anyone like-minded, is simple-minded for failing to come to or defend views which rest on an assumed anti-naturalism. Even if rejected, Hume needs to be ac- corded his sophistication. He knows perfectly well that ideas of causa- tion owe something in their original formation to felt agency, that we think there is a natural necessity in the world, and that there is a structure or web of conceptual relationships among ideas of substances and their behavior that we have. Only, for Hume, none of this cuts any ice: it is all a conceptual house of cards. V David Fate Norton's discussion of Hume on skepticism and belief ('How a Sceptic May Live Scepticism') is generally pellucid, instructive, and convincing. Norton is surely right that the doubt Hume enjoins is a philosophical doubt, not a psychological one. Hume means primarily to locate himself and his 'mitigated' skepticism in the broad empiricist moral tradition whose heroes are Montaigne, Voltaire, Mill, Russell, Popper, and others: where doubt is chiefly advocated as a furtherer of humane tolerance in practical life as well as in intellectual work. While morally admirable, this stance, and tradition, is philosophically less acute, and challenging, than the endeavor of actually justifying our fundamental beliefs, if it is possible, or abandoning the effort, if it is judged not to be. Though correctly judged secondary, or interstitial, in Hume, this deeper sort of skepticism, and a clear awareness of its weight, does appear in both the Treatise and the first Enquiry: as Norton goes on to acknowledge, in his discussion of Hume's deflation of empiricist pretensions where they occur.</page><page sequence="10">120 Peter Loptson While Norton has no difficulty establishing that it is possible to 'live' the Humean primary 'mitigated' skepticism, he does not address whether the deeper skepticism - the one that would explode the pre- tensions of empiricism (as of every other system of thought) - can be consistently lived. Of more substance is Norton's valuable discussion of belief, in Hume, as an imaginative apprehension of a content response to which is involuntary. If we really have no choice but to believe much or most of what we believe - and it seems we don't - the Pyrrhonian directive of the ancient skeptics, and of Descartes's fourth Meditation, will be quite futile, human nature precluding compliance. VI William Lyons's 'Modern Work on Intentionality' provides a fascinat- ing, vivid survey and overview of major contemporary stances (of 'the last fifteen years or so' [144]) in the philosophy of intentionality or representation, difficulties each confronts, and dialectical relationships among them which both illuminate each and effectively frame the plight they aggregatively leave us in. Although not altogether satisfactory on the relevant history before ca. 1980, Lyons gives a splendid, motivating account of Fodor's psychosemantics - all the more impressive because Lyons does not share it - and an effective succinct presentation of Milliken's biosemantics. Two problems (credited by Lyons to Fodor and Snowdon, respectively) are raised for the latter: first, Milliken's natural- izing of intentionality cannot be appropriately sensitively specific to particular intentional contents. (It might make sense of capacities for representation in general, in human and nonhuman species, or rough coarse-grained implementations of those capacities in particular func- tional contexts; but not thereby account for, or even suggest possibilities for accounting for, fine-grained differences among belief/desire con- tents.) Second, like the functionalist materialist stance in philosophy of mind broadly (though neither Snowdon nor Lyons brings out this par- allel), biosemantics seems unable to make sense of the first or other early intentional states, before intentionality had a chance to prove itself, or to be a part of a functional network, of natural selection or structural (logico-causal) type. These are problems for Milliken. Still, she surely is right, and Lyons fails to note, that the waggle dance of the honey-bees is causally related to human cognitive systems. That is, nature provides evidence of a range of representational and 'information-processing' systems in diverse life- forms, several of them sufficiently clearly on one or more continua with what humans do that it is not credible that they do not have similar underlying causal, structural, biochemical linkages. Representing (how-</page><page sequence="11">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 121 ever different, and varyingly sophisticated the forms it takes) is as natural as eating, attacking, fleeing, and copulating. Moreover, contrary to what Lyons implies (160), it does seem useful, and appropriate, to call what the brain does in representing information encoding. (Lyons thinks, on unstated grounds, that a physical mechanism cannot encode infor- mation unless it understands it.) Lyons thinks the correct account of human representation lies not in a Fodor-style psychosemantics (sentences in the brain) or a Milliken-type biosemantics, nor in a composite fusion of both, but rather - apparently - in what seems to be a reversion to the philosophical psychology of (what Michael Devitt calls) 'the British School': there is a description-ex- planation mode suited to neurophysiology (individualist-psychological or evolutionary), and another for the 'manifest' terrain of folk-psycho- logical ascription, and although the latter in some (perhaps in principle inexplicable?) manner supervenes on the former, they are mapped the one upon the other at our peril, at cost of confusion. The common-sense mode is, those of Lyons' persuasion hold, ineluctably bound up with cultures, 'forms of life' that only humans have; so that intentional states can be attributed to nonhuman animals only in a 'downgraded way' (160) - even if, nonetheless, appropriately, since these states are funda- mentally dispositional, and other animals can have relevantly similar dispositions. Thus Lyons eschews naturalism in the end. This seems to me mistaken, although this is not the context to develop these issues much further. For my part, at least, I think the approaches of Fodor and Milliken are not fundamentally at odds, and that the real truth about intentionality does lie in some grand-scale union of versions of the two. Lionesses don't just have 'beliefs,' they have beliefs, as do lots of other nonhuman animals; hence intentionality cannot require culture or forms of life (although it might need the sociability of bees, ants, dogs, baboons, and other gre- garious creatures). VII Also interesting, substantial, and well-argued is Andrew Brennan's 'The Disunity of the Self,' which defends Parfit-style views on personal identity. Along the way of developing his views, Brennan re-affirms the inter- pretation of Locke on personal identity according to which the con- sciousness which Locke holds the necessary condition of sameness of person is memory. This reading stems from Thomas Reid, and is widely believed; but for all that demonstrably erroneous. Lockean conscious- ness is a genus of which memory is just one species. Brennan argues</page><page sequence="12">122 Peter Loptson against the latter view (citing one sentence from Locke's Essay), but, I think, unsuccessfully. Brennan's primary theme is the Humean 'bundle' or 'systems' view of selves. Whether a 'systems' view of persons is plausible or defensible is a difficult and challenging question. Much of the 'scientific' philoso- phy of the 1920s and 30s advocated the idea that the concept of substance was, in general, due for displacement. New physics was supposed to have suggested (or proved) that individual substances were really series of events. This seemed aptly to fit and reinstate a Humean view of persons, and Russell, and others, took up this idea at that time, and in that spirit. This topic is a primary site of the ongoing and quite unresolved divide between naturalist/empiricist and (broadly) Kantian views of reality. Naturalism does not of course have to adopt a 'systems' or series-of- events view of persons, but such a view will only be congenial in that setting. And since the publication of the first Critique in 1781, Kantians and allied anti-Humeans have argued that that work's transcendental unity of apperception argument completely demolishes any idea of a person other than as an individual substance that continues over at least some protracted period of time. Even if not as overwhelmingly decisive as Kantians suppose, some- thing in the transcendental unity of apperception line seems quite per- suasive. There seems no reason to believe in umbrella states of consciousness that endure for what would have to be minimally many months, and surely in fact many years if not decades, and that have some kind of monitoring relation to the occurrent episodes of consciousness that we think normal human lives consist of. Only such prolonged items could secure the unity that is observed and assumed in those lives, if there weren't actual substantial selves. The 'I think' that accompanies all my experiences is, I suggest, to be taken as metaphor. It isn't the umbrella state just dismissed as chimerical. It is, rather, Kant's way of affirming the ineliminability of perduring substantial selves. VIII Geoffrey Madell's 'Personal Identity and Objective Reality' gets under- way with brio, in the presentation, then immediate contestation, of the claim - assigned to Gareth Evans, but the name of whose proponents is genuinely legion - that we human persons are objects of the world, not eliminable from plausible ontology. Madell, unlike Evans, says that this is the claim that we are just objects (his italics, in fact). Could we be objects, but not just objects (or not just objects)?</page><page sequence="13">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 123 Anyway, Madell thinks that if we were objects we would have to have essences; indeed, he thinks it ought to be the case that if we were objects, our properties of origin, and biological traits constitutive of being mem- bers of homo sapiens, should, as Kripke held, be essential to us. None of this is argued for. It is apparently supposed to be self-evident. He proceeds to the relations between 'the ty is F' (for some &lt;|&gt; lacking indexicality but uniquely true of me) and 'I am F.' Evans held, surely correctly, that 'there is always a gap between grasping' the one and grasping the other. Madell agrees that there is that gap, but thinks that this 'is, to put it mildly, not easy to reconcile with the claim that we are "elements of the objective order of things'" (185). So why does Madell think that the gap that all reasonable persons will concur is there between 'The oldest person residing at 301 8th Street East is blue-eyed' and 'I am blue-eyed' will imply that there can't objectively be such a thing as me? Madell gives two reasons, one of which seems to me not a good reason at all to come to his conclusion. The other at least points to an interesting and important consideration which, while it does not, I think, yield Madell's result, engages fundamental themes in ontology. The first, bad, reason: Evans's 'gap' is, more precisely, the affirmation of contingency between 'the &lt;|&gt; is F' and 'I am F.' 'But if it is contingent, then there is no possibility of identifying ourselves with some object in the world; we are contingently related to it, no more' (186). Can the distinction launched by Abelard and Aquinas, and so carefully, lovingly, revised and fostered by the analytic modal metaphysicians of the 1960s and 1970s, between the de dicto and the de re, have been so quickly forgotten? For, of course, Evans's point, and the truth, is that it is contingent de dicto that I am the &lt;|&gt;; just as it is non-contingent de re, i.e., the thing that is in fact the (|&gt; is, in all worlds it is in, me, and conversely. (Or, I had better say more tentatively at this stage, if there is a me, then this is so.) It is the de re sense that matters in this context, and in that sense I am not non-contingently the &lt;|&gt;. Madell's second reason for seeing Evans's 'gap' as pointing to my non-objecthood is different, and of moment. Can indexicality be elimi- nated from discourse? And if it can't, if there could (contrary to Putnam, and others) be a unique true description of the world, would it contain sentences, or propositions, with ineliminable indexicals? Otherwise put, is the idea that we have, or ought to have, of how the world is objectively, but also fully and in its entirety, one that should altogether lack 'egocen- tric' or perspective-relative facts (or alleged facts)? Is there such a fact as a fact of my, right now, sitting in a chair holding a pen? (In addition to, or otherwise related to, a fact of Peter Loptson's sitting in a chair, at about 8:35 p.m., holding a pen.)</page><page sequence="14">124 Peter Loptson Now, one first response to these queries that is germane to Madell's concerns is this: whether indexicalities have a place among the facts of an objective world is, so far as that goes, independent of whether persons are objects, and facts about them having a place among the facts of an objective world. If we decided, for some reason, that there were no indexical facts, this wouldn't cut any ice as to whether Bob Smith and Mary Robinson are objects, and the former really, objectively, stupid, and the latter really, objectively, smart. It would just mean that you couldn't be Bob Smith, and she couldn't be Mary Robinson. There would be no reason not to think that there were persons, and that they are objects, only reason to believe that I wasn't one (or indeed anything else), and the same with you. But, still, these are large issues. We are in the territory, here, of Descartes, Schopenhauer, Kierkegaard, and Thomas Nagel; and of a very considerable, and imposing, empiricist contrary stance. Subjective, phe- nomenological, perspectival facts of reality - what-it-is-likenesses - are advocated (in Descartes's case not obviously very self-consciously) on the one side; and on the other, under the aegis of scientific philosophy, the idea of the world's being determinately thus and so, sub specie aeternitatis, eternity not being a location of time or space. (The eternity of scientific philosophy does, of course, include facts about individuals, a, b, Fidel Castro, etc.) Also, although he raises it, this huge, deep, and interesting issue is not the one Madell wants to pursue. Instead he turns to personal identity. This is doubly unfortunate, for he neglects to notice that personal iden- tity doesn't have to involve indexicality . All of the theories that have been defended and attacked proposing necessary or sufficient conditions of numerically same personhood over time can be set out without ever a word of me, or you, or him or her. They can be articulated, advanced, and assaulted, never referring to the items under consideration except as persons, human beings, Bill Dobbs, Martha Dubois, etc. The personal identity question is what makes a person be the same over time, how dramatically could a person be altered and (a) still be a person and (b) still be the same person. This says nothing about what an individual person may think comprises personal identity, his or her own, or anyone else's. To speak with those whom we might call the indexical- ists, my being me from ti to t2 (and at both times) doesn't depend upon my ascribing something - an experience, or a body - to me. It depends (if the theories are right that Madell is discussing, and, he thinks, raising difficulties for) on that experience, or body, actually belonging to me (or to P.L., J.S., etc.). Because of what he takes to be the problems he has raised for same- body and same-experience theories of personal identity, Madell goes on to argue that facts of indexicality, at any rate ones involving me and you,</page><page sequence="15">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 125 are necessary, and really obtain, after all. Only these facts will not be object-involving. They (some of them) will involve me, but not any object. Again, the real issue, the big issue, the important issue, is whether ontology can do without indexicality, not whether persons, or you or I, merit the honorific (or 'dishonorific') 'object/ Everyone, save certain empiricist philosophers, agrees with Madell that there are facts about oneself. But if one really put in question whether there are, it would be difficult to prove that there are, i.e., from no premise that implied or presupposed that there are. Even the Cartesian route - that I exist (for Descartes) is certain, or incorrigible, while that Descartes exists is not, even for him - is set up with facts about oneself accepted as ontologically perspicuous formulations, something which the scientific philosopher, particularly once he or she sees what use these formulations will be put to, will presumably not grant. One simply must, I think, affirm as warranted by experience that there are indexical facts of the matter, some of them facts about oneself. That can be done independently of, but after, a case that there are persons, the two, case and affirmation, then being able to be united as the claim that one is oneself a person. Madell's argument becomes finally effectively self-refuting. If it were correct, then none of us is a human being. But we are, all of us, human beings. Madell reaches the cul de sac that he does through confusing the epistemic with the ontic, and the de re with the de dicto. He also fails to see that the problem of what John Perry calls the essential indexical (in his valuable paper of that name)3 is logically distinct from conscious personhood as such. In fact much of the use of 'person' seems quite straightforwardly object-like. Persons can be photographed and run over by cars; there can be one or seven persons in a room, just as there can be one or seven pencils, or apples, or goldfish. It is unconvincing that there can be no grasp at all of the sort of thing the latter locutions affirm without the idea of being me. On the other hand, a complete or comprehensive grasp of 'person' might need being me. Perhaps this is what Madell means; but it doesn't establish the fundamental categorial distinctness of person- thought and object-thought he is claiming. Likewise, it is not clear that indexicality as such requires T and l&gt;eing me.' For example, 'past,' 'present,' and 'future' are temporal indexicals, and it seems right that particular temporal slices or stages are present at particular times, inde- pendently of whether there are persons. 3 John Perry, 'The Problem of the Essential Indexical/ Nous 13 (1979) 3-21</page><page sequence="16">126 Peter Loptson IX P.T. Herbert's 'Gappiness and Personal Identity' also discusses issues of identity over time, especially of course persons.' The style and method- ology is, likewise, 50s Oxbridge, though effective engagement is made with recent work like that of Van Inwagen. Like a thousand Oxbridge philosophical warriors who have gone before, Herbert discusses pains, and, also like them, with the methodo- logical confidence that solid conclusions may be reached via the sound- ing-board of what ordinary folk are alleged to be inclined to say. If ordinary folk actually spoke with one voice on such matters, and non- ordinary folk - neurophysiologists, philosophers, and others - could be plausibly factored into, or out of, such determinations, this might be a more reliable guide to truth. At any rate, it seems clear that there are many phenomena about whose identity conditions neither ordinary language, common sense, semantical 'intuition,' or anything else have clear, confident, consistent, or reliable views; and pace Herbert that these include headache and other pain phenomena. This is the territory of convention, caprice, and honest hesitation. If someone feels pain, it is interrupted, and then they feel pain resembling the earlier occasion, there will be circumstances, and indi- viduals, in which or to whom the pains will be held numerically identical and others in which or to whom they are merely closely resembling or qualitatively the same though numerically distinct; but a philosopher ought to be the last person in the world to hold that one of these views will be correct and the other not. Herbert is concerned with the idea that something might exist, then be disassembled or otherwise not present, then recur or obtain again - a machine, for example, that is taken entirely apart, then put back together. For some reason, unclear to me, at least, Herbert wants to defend the idea that the object or event exists, or persists, over the interruptive span. This seems quite implausible. If 'Lizzy,' my favored Alfa Romeo, has been totally taken apart - maybe all separable compo- nents have been sent in individual packages to distant locations - there is nowhere that Lizzy is, or is at. It does not seem reasonable to view Lizzy as a mereological or scattered object, since Lizzy is an artifact and a machine, and there is no longer any such artifact and machine as that one, even though there may be again. The right view seems clearly to be that some objects can exist, wholly cease and lapse into non-being, then exist again. Only the metaphysical prejudices of Reid, and some others, pose barriers to this idea, and they may be dismissed. Herbert's proposal of an existence that can span a time of non-presence has little to recom- mend it. What if the object never does get reassembled? Will Herbert</page><page sequence="17">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 127 insist that it continues to exist nonetheless, in scattered suspension? Better to deny a metaphysical dogma. In the last few pages of Herbert's essay another metaphysical principle appears. This principle is at the heart of Jack Macintosh's essay, which follows Herbert's. I will identify the principle here, and defer discussion of its applications to personal identity issues to the next section. The principle in question is Bernard Williams's extension over time of the Descartes-Kripke principle that identicals are necessarily so. The latter, the basis of the sum res cogitans argument of the sixth Meditation, asserts that if something x is (numerically) identical to something y, then there is no possibility (de re) of x existing and y not (or y existing and x not). Contraposed, this is Descartes's 'if there is any possibility of x existing apart from y, then x*y.' This principle is certainly true. More problemati- cally, Williams extends it to a principle of identity over time: if x at t could be diverse from y at t', then x at t is not identical to y at t'. This principle is difficult to fill in or render clearly in ways that will not be question- begging or confuse the ontic and the epistemic. Suppose we have been prepared to suppose that x (existing at t) has become, at a later stage is, object y (existing at t'). Williams's principle says that if we can conceive an alternative situation (a possible world), where x does exist at t, and y also does at t', but y is not x, then we need to surrender the claim of this identity in the original world. This principle is used to reject alleged possibilities of disembodied selves existing in afterlives, and Macintosh, as we will see, uses it to reject possibilities of later embodied selves being identical to earlier ones (the earlier ones having died), on the grounds that there could be rival candidates for those selves and no possibility of (no meaning in the idea of) preferring one of the candidates to another. Herbert rejects Williams's diachronic Cartesian principle, but appears to think that something like divine powers must be invoked to quell a view that strong. I will argue that these seas may be calmed without invoking omnipotence. X Jack Macintosh's 'The Impossibility of Miraculous Reincarnation' is fascinating, and fun - like so many of his papers - and seeks boldly to prove a substantive negative metaphysical result. If Macintosh is right, there just couldn't be a return of a person (to reality) after a temporal gap in which the person and a body of theirs was absent. The paradigm case goes like this. Someone, O, is dead or altogether absent, and it is later. Person R is now on the scene. R has a great many states that imply that R closely resembles O. Macintosh doesn't say this - he professes deep skepticism about what could possibly be reasonably</page><page sequence="18">128 Peter Loptson included in the relevant collection of states - but let's suppose that the states are such that, but for the evidence of O's death, they would be held sufficient to establish R's legal identity with O in a Canadian court of law. (Handwriting matches, so do fingerprints, recordings of the voices of O and R, and other relevant physical evidence is corroborative - or would be except that O's demise was observed incontrovertibly, and O's body was afterwards cremated. Also, psychological evidence is suffi- cient that any law court in the land would regard the identity as estab- lished, but for O's known death.) The whole situation is perplexing; and who knows what to think? But could it be that O=R? Penelhum thinks it could, and so do I. Macintosh thinks that O can't be R, that there is no possible world in which O is R, because there will be another possible world in which someone certainly diverse from R has the very (qualitatively) same evidentiary relation to O that R has, the certainty of the diversity of that individual from R being established by the existence of a third possible world in which both R and that individual are present, with different (at least relational) properties. But - as Macintosh himself acknowledges - so-called reincarnation- ists (believers that O might be R) insist that worlds with more than one candidate for identity with an earlier object (candidacy implying closely similar relevantly identifying trait sets) are worlds where neither candi- date is the object. Of course there can be circumstances in which there is more than one candidate for identity with an earlier object. This is true where spatio-temporal continuity, and unbroken causal linkage, obtain (as in the cases of ourselves in the real world, 'mitosed' substances, like human persons in some possible worlds); so, of course there will be worlds with rival claimants for being O. But the fact that there are worlds where the self of last year split into two selves, one of which (we simply don't give any attention one way or the other to the other) is evidentially indistinguishable from me, i.e., the me of the actual world, gives no good reason at all for thinking that I am not (numerically) the same as that self of last year. My being the same is the proof that Macintosh's 'proof is not a proof. As I mean to be playing Gaunilo to Macintosh's Anselm here, let me give the parallel case more content. I note first that the temporal gap between O and R plays no role in the argument that Macintosh gives. Neither does physical discontinuity. Although Macintosh indicates that he feels more comfortable with claims of identity over time where causal spatio-temporal linkings between the candidates obtain, his argument against reincarnation rests entirely on Williams' diachronic Cartesian principle. The details will be complex (probably empirically challenging), but let us conceive of human mitosis as as near to amoeba mitosis as can be.</page><page sequence="19">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 129 Systematic cell division occurs, and the successor humans are spatio- temporally continuous with the earlier human from whom they stem and whom both exactly genetically replicate. There are worlds in which such human mitosis happens to me. One of them is a world exactly resembling the actual world, until two weeks ago. Then, two weeks ago, in the world I am conceiving of, I retire alone to sleep around midnight, and mitosis happens to me, one me-successor falling out of my bed on one side, the other on the other. Passing extra-terrestrials make their unique visit to earth that night, happen to come to my house and, in ways not detectable by any human technology, kidnap one of the me-succes- sors, whom they bring back to their remote planet. There that individual lives out his days in a pleasantly appointed zoo. Meanwhile the other me-successor climbs groggily back into bed. The rest of that individual's life exactly resembles the entire remainder of my life in the actual world from that point two weeks ago when these dramatic doings transpired. I tell this counterf actual story (it closely resembles others in the litera- ture) even at this sketchy length because I think it will illustrate what is problematic in Williams' principle, as well as show that Macintosh's argument is unsuccessful. There will be some considerable impulse to say, of my imagined case, that the me-successor who remains on earth and has a life indistinguishable from the life I am now living, is me; and that my kidnapped clone is not me, but a sort of sloughed off human being resembling me. If you thought this way, though, you would seem to be caused trouble by the fact that there will be a world where it is the other me-successor whom the extra-terrestrials kidnap, the destinies of the two individuals simply reversed from those just related. We should, I think, accept Williams's principle in the strict letter of the word. If a at t could be diverse from b at (later) t', then a is diverse from b in the actual world. But we had better be sure that it really is b in the possible world we think is involved. There just being an individual in a world with what seem to be all the right credentials won't suffice. We can stipulate that we are only concerned with a world containing b, but this will preclude argument as to whether an envisaged situation is or is not, could be or couldn't be, one where b is there. If we have eschewed rigid designation, then we can see, I think, that Macintosh's case falls apart. Turning to O and R, we're not supposed to be assuming that R isn't O. Rather, Macintosh is supposed to be proving to us that R isn't O, even if R seems to be what we may appropriately call a dead ringer for O. Do we get to conceive of some world or other, at least, where R=O? No, because if R is ever O, then he or she always and everywhere is. But we likewise don't get - not without question-begging - to conceive of a world where R isn't O, for the same reason. All we've got are those strong resemblance relations and our awareness of possible mitosis cases even where spatio-temporal continuity does obtain. So,</page><page sequence="20">130 Peter Loptson where is the contradiction (which Macintosh alleges reincarnationism will imply)? It is nowhere to be found. 'The problem [Macintosh says (222)] for the miraculous reincarnationists is clear. They want to allow that Ri=O, and that R2=O.' But - of course they don't (or at least shouldn't and needn't). Not both. If it were that Ri=O, then, of course it wouldn't be that R2=O, since Ri * R2; and contrariwise. Again, then, if the argument did work, an exactly parallel case would prove that last year's me isn't this year's because there are worlds where last year's me does what amoebas do in this world. None of the foregoing provides a positive case for R's identity with O, and Macintosh very reasonably asks that such a case be given. Why should we think that R really might be O? I have already suggested an answer to this question, but let me say it again: if R could satisfy the majority of a team of legal, biological, and psychological experts in a sophisticated scientific society - I will assume ours is such a place - that, but for O's known death and the time-gap between that event and R's appearance, R would qualify as O, and there are no competitors to R as O, then it is at least reasonable (rational), to hold that O has been reincarnated as R. XI Penelhum groups his 'Comments and Responses' under the headings 'Philosophy of Religion,' 'Hume Studies,' and 'Identity and the Self.' I will confine my remarks to themes in religion and in Hume. Penelhum's stance in philosophy of religion is exemplary. Few think- ers in this area manifest the conjunction of synoptic intelligence and intellectual honesty that Penelhum displays. He acknowledges that the religious stance faces a severe challenge of evidence, and that that stance is not the single or generic thing that some of its advocacy makes it out to be; moreover, while there is empiricist and naturalist faith and com- mitment too, these are not in all relevant respects like those of religion. Worse, one cannot - and as Penelhum sees it (rightly, I think), shouldn't - just have a religious commitment (if one is going to have a religious commitment at all); it must be more specific, and contentful. The par- ticularity of a creed is essential, not accidental, for the religious mode. But one has legitimate worries in this case that the commitment may be culturally imperialist, or depersonalized autobiographical projection. Penelhum still, in the end, seems to me to make of a Christian world- view and commitment a thing too much apart, apart, that is to say, from common perspectives and values at least in the west. It would not be accidental if these commonalities are as I claim: western conceptions of persons, ontological and moral, developed along with Christian ones</page><page sequence="21">Critical Notice of Macintosh and Meynell Faith, Scepticism and Personal Identity 131 that shaped and were shaped by them. As a result Penelhum grounds his response to Macintosh (for example) unnecessarily in these claims of difference. Proceeding to Hume: Penelhum shares with Flew a dismissal of Hume's account of causality. Both are shocked at the passing and casual introduction, by Hume, of the counterf actual analysis of causal connec- tion ('if C had not obtained, E would not have occurred'), so clearly non-equivalent to mere constant conjunction. Penelhum in fact thinks not merely that the latter doesn't imply the former, but that neither does genuine causal connection; on the ground of cases of causal over-deter- mination. (His example: cancer genuinely causes death, and there will be strictly universal generalizations of the form 'whenever someone has cancer in circumstances C, they die/ but it is untrue that if it were not the case that an individual were affected with cancer in circumstances C, they would not die, since mortality is everyone's lot, by one route or other.) I think Hume may be partially defended from at least this last charge. If we are talking about particular event conjunctions - this C, and this E - then (excluding the really quite rare and infrequent cases of multiple simultaneous independent sufficient causes - e.g., two assassins firing accurately at vital organs of the same individual, their bullets reaching their target at precisely the same time) it will be correct that if C hadn't occurred, E wouldn't have.4 Hume surely may be excused for neglecting multiple simultaneous independent sufficient cases. As for the larger issue: the counterfactual analysis does clearly make a 4 This construal of Hume's meaning is generous, but not unreasonable. The whole relevant passage is as follows: 'Similar objects are always conjoined with similar. Of this we have experience. Suitably to this experience, therefore, we may define a cause to be an object, followed by another, and where all the objects similar to the first are followed by objects similar to the second. Or in other words, where, if the first object had not been, the second never had existed' (Enquiry, VII, ii, 76; Hume's emphasis). To understand Hume as I suggest, one simply has to take the first half of Hume's first italicized formula, and the whole of the second, as quite precisely temporally indicized (i.e., 'an object [at t], followed by another [at t'],' and 'if the first object had not been [at t], the second never had existed [at f ]'). To further protect Hume, one could add spatial indices as well. It is clear that, independently, one should also understand the relevant 'similarity/ in the second half of the first formula, as something quite precise - not sufficiently so as to imply uniqueness or unrepeat- ability for an event, but enough to rule out otherwise obtaining putative counter- example types. (E.g., 'cancer' won't sufficiently precisely characterize an 'object' for the intended similarity: it must be a thoroughly specified sort of cancer, and attendant circumstances, for, of course, not all cancers cause deaths, even if this one did - i.e., for Hume, this one was followed by death, and if this cancer hadn't been, when it was, this death wouldn't have been, when it was.)</page><page sequence="22">132 Peter Loptson conceptual addition to (mere) constant conjunction; and many modern analyses of the causal relation do seize upon that addition (sometimes citing Hume for it, sometimes not). Yet it is not self-evident what the counterfactual conditional means, and major highly technical accounts of it have been developed to try to say. These accounts are incompatible, as well as complex, and it is not dishonest or dull-witted to dismiss resembling possible worlds and cognate arcana as explicatorily circular, or empty, and to hold that the counterfactual conditional is basically hardly much other than constant conjunction, any difference being a contribution the mind has made. To conclude: this is a useful, varied collection of essays, covering a lot of philosophical territory in interesting ways, and appropriately honor- ing a distinguished philosophical practitioner, who himself manifests in his responses to the Festschriftler a lively and continuing philosophical acuity and creativity.
