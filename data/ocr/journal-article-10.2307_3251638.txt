<plain_text><page sequence="1">The River and its Metaphors: Goethe's "Mahomets Gesang"' Jonas Jolle Goethe's "Mahomets Gesang" shares with his "Prometheus" the ambiguity of form, being at the same time both part of a dramatic fragment and an independent poem. While the genetic relationship between fragment and poem in "Prometheus" remains uncertain, what later became known as "Mahomets Gesang" was originally conceived as a dialogue between Ali and Fatima for the fourth act of the drama.2 Only in 1777 when Goethe copied some of his early poems for Frau von Stein did he surrender the form of the dialogue and give it the title "Mahomets Gesang". With this title, it has become known as one of Goethe's Jugendhymnen.' Apart from the dialogue, which had yet to be worked into the drama, Mahomet did not progress beyond the opening scene."

While the internal chronology of its genesis remains uncertain up to a point,7 the "Gesang" stands in a much clearer and closer relation- ship to the whole of the dramatic fragment than the Prometheus hymn does to its fragment. Yet while being identifiably part of the plan for Mahomet, the "Gesang" was never worked into the drama, and as it stands by itself, it has a completeness that the drama as a whole would never achieve.8 The Orient, as a textual universe, is only diffusely sketched in Mahomet' and will reappear much later and much larger in the West- OstlicherDivan. In the context of Goethe's early hymns, however, even the faint orientalism of "Mahomets Gesang" is surprising, as most of the other hymns are located in the productive polarity between Classical antiquity and German modernity. When the hymn is dis- tilled from the drama fragment and stripped of its dialogue form, it further loses its specific oriental background and is more easily assimilated with the other hymns. By forging a monologue from the dialogue, the move from drama to hymn, from a discursive to a deictic mode is completed. As the hymn now (1777) stands, it even makes the title, "Mahomets Gesang", seem redundant, belonging to earlier stages of the poem. The link between Muhammad and the river poem that carries his name is much more tenuous than the link between Ganymede and that lyrical poem. Where the Ganymede myth prefigures the coming together of two disparate beings (man and nature) and works as an amplification of the lyrical, the river poem has washed out the specificity of the historical Muhammad and the oriental background in its move from the dramatic fragment. i Klaus Weimar.

This article will seek to trace the course of the river as a locus of metaphorical exchange in Goethe's poem and to point to other, similar courses of rivers in poetry. Rather than trying to decode the river and its metaphors into a plain text message about a historical character, this reading sets out to preserve the different metaphorical layers interwoven in the poem. From the source to the mouth, the "Gesang" moves along with the river. It begins at the "Felsenquell" (1. 1) and ends with "Dem erwartenden Erzeuger I Freudebrausend an das Herz" (11. 71-72). It evolves with the same fluid linearity, accelerating and accumulating, as the river of which it speaks. The course of the river, its serpentine wandering, its tumescence and its debouchement, structures the poem, its opening and end. Where "Prometheus" shifts backwards and forwards in time, recounting and asserting, in the past indicative and in the imperative, the "Gesang" runs along in a continuous present. The initial imperative "Sehet" (1. 1) effectively marks only the opening of a hymn that will be in the indicative. Where "Ganymed" is a lyrical hymn of an eventually mythological moment, the "Gesang" evolves over time and through space with an inner purpose and direction. Yet the linearity of the river in the poem is completed by its other invisible half. The circular course of water is intimated by the repeating at the end of words and phrases from the beginning. Thus the river, and the poem, is not a single rush from source to mouth, but an ever-continuous, circular flow."' Such organic form, autotelic and self-sustained, defines 'nature' in the context of eighteenth- century criticism of human civilisation. A river poem therefore, in a sense later fully established by Holderlin, is always more than a tree poem or a horse poem. An old affinity between the images of poetry and of rivers ensures that a river poem is always more than a topographical description of a waterway. Starting with Goethe and culminating in Holderlin, the wild moun- tainous stream that flows into the plain of civilisation suddenly 10 Cf. the opening stanza of C^oethe's later hymn "Gesang der Geister iiber den Wassern" (MA 2.1:48-9): "Des Menschen Seele I Cleicht dem Wasser: I Vom Himmel kommt es, I Zum Himmel steigt es, I Und wieder nieder I Zur Erde muB es, I Ewig wechselnd." 433</page><page sequence="4">JONAS J0LLE becomes the centre of much poetic activity.1 When human domina- tion of nature is accelerated by new technical means, what is seen as the organic form of the river becomes an ideal image of nature that in its autotelic course appears to escape such domination. Where the locus amoenus is a poetic space of temporary refuge in a socio-political context which conditioned that space in the first place, the river becomes not a refuge, but a microcosm. It becomes a visible expres- sion of nature's laws and forces, an expression that achieves ideal status as the matrix of all living form. That matrix posits humans not as estranged from nature and dominating it, but as an organic part of nature. This holistic view of humans in nature, and of human history at large, underlies the cultural significance of the river image in Goethe's poetry. It allows Goethe to draw on the river as an image both of Muhammad's personal development and the spreading of his religious following.12 If the image of the river suddenly achieves such heightened cultural significance at the end of the eighteenth century, there always was such an affinity, as mentioned above, between the images of poetry and rivers. Horace's famous image of Pindar's poetry as a mountain stream swollen with rain not only dominated the received opinion of Pindar well into the nineteenth century, but also came to define a poetic ideal in the late eighteenth century. In the second stanza of Carm. 4.2 the imagery of poetry and rivers, whose affinity predates Horace, is given its canonical form.'3 In that form, the river- image makes both "Mahomets Gesang" and H6lderlin's river poems possible in the first place (Carm. 4.2.5-8) 4: monte decurrens velut amnis, imbres quem super notas aluere ripas, fervet immensusque ruit profundo Pindarus ore, " Cf.

To the poets of the Sturm und Drang this organic image of poetry appeared to fit their polemic against (French) rule-bound aesthetics, vindicating Genius as a rule-breaker.' The Hellenistic poet Callimachus of Cyrene had used the same image to establish a new genre of poetry against the Homeric and Hesiodic epics (Epigr. 28). In his Hymn 2 (In Apollinem) he speaks of how great epics run like the Euphrates and carry much mud and refuse on their waters, while his poem trickles from a sacred source in a pure stream (2.108-112). The passage quoted from Horace, with its central image of the river, serves as the lens through which the eighteenth century read and under- stood Pindar. In his essay on "Pindar und die Dithyrambensanger", Herder argues that modern German poets cannot emulate Pindar as the poet of dithyrambs, an argument that Goethe to some extent counters in "Wanderers Sturmlied" with its insistent invocation of Pindar and Bromius. Borrowing Horace's image, Herder claims that while modern dithyrambists are a shower of rain that trickles away in the sand, Pindar is still, as he was to Roman poets, the free-flowing river: "So flielft ein majestatischer Strom, reich um Arme auszulassen, und sparsam, sie wieder an sich zu ziehen, in seinem breiten Bette fort, und walzt sich mit hundert Handen brausend vom Felsen herab, um sich im Tale zusammen zu finden: ein groBer gewaltiger Strom, der Name seiner Gegend".'"' Herder also expands on Horace's image by introducing it into the modern topography of the sublime that according to Kant specifically includes "ein hoher Wasserfall eines machtigen Flusses".'7 Herder's essay re-articulates Horace's decisive image for Modernity in terms that are central to Goethe's "Mahomets 14 David Mulroy.

Where Horace's ode marks the distance between Pindar and the river with the comparing "velut" (Carm. 4.2.5), thus making it a simile and not a metaphor, the "Gesang", like Herder's prose text, has no such mark of distance. The conflux of poetic form and the free-flowing river had also been widely explored by Klopstock in his odes. His "Wingolf', a rewriting of his earlier "Ode an meine Freunde" (1747), constantly invokes the image of the river, as in the "Erstes Lied": "So floss der Waldstrom hin nach dem Ozean! I So fliesst mein Lied auch, stark, und gedanken- voll"'8 or in the opening line of the "Drittes Lied": "Lied werde sanfter, fliesse gelinder fort" (Oden 1:13).'1 Here again Horace's ode on Pindar provides the central image of a poetic ideal, even after Pindar's name and most classical references are purged from the rewritten version. From the very beginning of the "Gesang", the river is endowed with human qualities. Its course from the trickling "Felsenquell" (1. 1) to "dem ewgen Ozean" (1. 38) is described in terms of childhood, youth, adulthood, and yet, as we shall see, the way from adulthood is not into old age, but toward a father-figure who is described as the "Erzeuger" (1. 72), an unnamed patriarchal god. That human development coincides with the course of the river, as it falls into four distinct passages or stages.2" The first three stanzas (11. 1-17) follow the stream from the source through the mountains. The next two (11. 18-27) run through the (alpine) valley, before, in the following three stanzas (11. 28-63), the river enters the plain. The concluding two (11. 64-72) see the river off into the ocean. Each of the passages coincides with a stage of human development. Thus the first, from the source through the mountains, speaks of the river's childhood and youth: "Nahrten seine Jugend I Gute Geister" (11. 5-6); "Jiinglingfrisch" (1. 8); "mit friihem Fuhrertritt" (1. 15). If the whole poem is structured by the course of the river, its course already runs parallel to the anthropomorphic development of an unnamed 1"Johann Gottfried Klopstock. Oden. 2 vols. Leipzig: GJ.

The gender of that person is identical with the grammatical gender of "Felsenquell" (1. 1) and remains masculine through the whole poem. Thus, the course of his life and the course of the river are confluent from the beginning. Where the river acquires human attributes, the development of the figure is con- versely described as the flow of the river. A similar development from "der kindische Bach" (1. 1) "zum mannlichen Bach" (1. 8) and finally toward "der Ewigkeit Meer" (1. 24) is already found in Johann Heinrich Ffissli's "Ode an seine zuruckgelassenen Freunde"'' of 1765. While notable for its sustained image of the river and of human development in the first five stanzas, the poem opens with a simile and not a metaphor. In the last stanza, the image is translated back into the circumstances of the speaker's life: "Eilt ich von euch nicht so?" (1. 22) thereby surrendering the balance of images preserved throughout in "Mahomets Gesang". David Wellbery points out how these two mutually informing metaphors (river as man and man as river) depend on a "process of predicate exchange" (Wellbery 136). Properties belonging to one term are exchanged for properties belonging to the other. Using I.A. Richards' terminology of metaphor, Wellbery further establishes how the terms "assume, alternately, the position of vehicle and tenor [...] Thus, the poetic metaphor frees itself from reference to something given prior and external to it and becomes a semiotic relation that grounds itself (engenders its terms)."(Wellbery 136-7). The river is not a stand-in for something else, but locked in mutual dependency and exchange with human development. Instead of establishing a hierarchy between the two terms, the poem draws equally on both of them, oscillating between the two.22 Such flexible exchange of images and metaphors already marked the fluidity of"Ganymed", and in the "Gesang" that same flexibility in balancing different poetic terms first fully establishes the genre of modern river poems. In the second part of his Asthetik, Hegel similarly discusses the difference between metaphor and simile, establishing the image ("das Bild") as "eine ausfihrliche Metapher" where its meaning, the external referent, cannot be isolated from its concrete representa- tion: "Das Bild findet besonders statt, wenn zwei ffir sich genommene 2 Johann Heinrich Fuissli.

As a prominent instance of such an extended metaphor Hegel gives precisely "Mahomets Gesang", where the meaning of the image is not spelled out ("ohne [...] zur Sprache zu bringen") but con- tained within the exchange between the two terms of the poem. Although Hegel reads the term of human development specifically through the character of Mahomet, and as only present in the title, his discussion of "das Bild" in relation to metaphor and simile moves beyond the traditional hierarchy of classical poetics which places the referent above, and separate from, the image. Hegel's reading of the "Gesang" where "zwei fur sich genommene mehr selbstdndige Erscheinungen oder Zustande in eins gesetzt werden" thus already anticipates Wellbery's admittedly more detailed reading of semantic interweaving. Listing the anthropomorphic predicates of the river in "Mahomets Gesang" may seem a trivial task,24 but in highlighting the markers that draw attention to the human qualities of the river we may trace the paths of exchange between the two terms. Such a highlighting, which is purely experimental, would look something like this (11. 1-17): Sehet den Felsenquell Freudenhell Wie ein Sternenblick! 23 George Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. Asthetik.

Jinglingfrisch Tanzt er aus der Wolke Auf die Marmorfelsen nieder Jauchzet wieder Nach dem Himmel Durch die Gipfelgange Jagt er bunten Kieseln nach Und mit friihem Fiihrertritt ReiBt er seine Bruderquellen Mit sich fort. The predicate exchange is especially evident in the two neologisms "Junglingfrisch" and "Bruderquellen" where the first part of the composites belongs to the human sphere whereas the second ("frisch"; "Quellen") is more traditionally used to describe water. In the second stanza, only the two verbs are taken from a human context ("Tanzt"; "Jauchzet") whereas the rest of the stanza could be a straightforward description of a waterfall. Thus, we can see even on a crude syntactic and morphological level how the two metaphors complement each other in the poem. In Holderlin's late hymn "Der Rhein", the image of the mountain- ous stream is developed more fully in a complex exchange with the destinies of Heracles and Orpheus (Janss 90-102).' The poem opens at the "Quell" (1. 3) where the poetic speaker comes to hear of a "Schiksaal" (1. 11) from inside the mountain. The second stanza is based on the same "semantic interweaving" (Wellbery 136) that we saw in the "Gesang", where the two metaphorical terms of stream and human development mutually inform each other. A highlighted section reveals further parallels with Goethe's technique (11. 21-33): [...] dort Im kaltesten Abgrund hort' Ich um Erlosung jammern Den Jiingling, es horten ihn, wie er tobt', '5 Friedrich Holderlin.

Die Stimme wars des edelsten der Strome, Des freigeborenen Rheins, [...] Because of the increasing complexity of Holderlin's imagery, the highlighting here is even cruder than in the previous passage. Yet through this, admittedly superficial, comparison between "Mahomets Gesang" and "Der Rhein" certain elements seem to stand out more clearly. The mountainous source of the river is in both instances occupied by the "Jungling" (1. 24) whose development will follow or determine its course. Again, it is mainly the verbs that denote human quality ('jammern"; "tobt"'; "anklagt"'), by making the river act like a human being. The organic form of the stream as it runs from the source to the sea becomes, in different ways, the measure of develop- ment for both Goethe's Genius and Holderlin's "Halbg6tter". The human figure that is brought into play as a youth at the beginning of Goethe's poem is not further identified. Only once in the whole poem will he speak and then only for a line. At the very beginning of the opening stanza the poetic speaker immediately draws attention ("Sehet", 1. 1) to the river, as if to demonstrate its exemplary status. Thus when the human figure is developed together with the metaphor of the river, that development assumes an idealised form. While the title of the poem establishes that it is a song on "Mahomet", this song seems to have little to do with the historical character Muhammad.2' As with Prometheus, G6tz, Socrates, Caesar and Faust, the character Mahomet in Goethe's dramatic fragment and poem is an exponent of Genius. Thus his itinerary in the "Gesang" is an ideal one, moving from the source to the father figure at the end. The "Bruderquellen" (1. 16) that the stream takes with it on its course could stand for the early following that Mahomet receives as a religious leader. Wellbery takes the human figure in the poem to be Mahomet and thus reads his development as a "process of "' Solbrig. "Die Rezeption". 113. 440</page><page sequence="11">MLN religious-historical foundation" (Wellbery 136). Yet it could also be read as the personal development of Genius, growing in strength and determination. The transition to the next stage of the river's course is marked by the topographical reference in the first line of the fourth stanza (11. 18-27): Drunten vwerden in dem Tal Unter seinem FuBtritt Blumen LUnd die Wiese Lebt von seinem Hauch. Doch ihn halt kein Schattental Keine Blumen Die ihm seine Knie umschlingen Ihm mit Liebesaugen schmeicheln Nach de- Ebne dringt sein Lauf Schlangewandelnd. A similar reference at the end of this passage marks the stream's way out of the valley and into the plain: "Nach der Ebne dringt sein Lauf' (1. 26). The "Schattental" (1. 22) is no abiding city and the river presses on, ignoring the locus amoenus and the brief possibility of love. The "Liebesaugen" (1. 25) are seen as almost ensnaring the human figure and holding him back from his planned course. In rejecting the flowers, the meadow and the shady valley, he rejects nature in favour of the cities and civilisations that he will found in the plain (Wellbery 143). For the river to change its course and become a lake would be as unnatural as for the Genius to stagnate or for the wanderer to stop and returni home. The image of flowers winding arotund his knees intricately weaves different terms together. In the same metaphorical way that in English one speaks of the foot of the mountain, or of the elbow and the head of the river, in German, and in Greek,2' one speaks of the knee of the river. That phrase is so ingrained in language that it almost passes unnoticed, yet in the poein its status suddenly becomes ambiguous. Do the "Knie" (1. 24) refer metaphorically to the river, as common German usage suggests, or literally to the htuman figure? Yet what is literal about the human figure that is described in terms of a river and what is not metaphorical in this poem? Again, the flexible 27 ('f. (allim. Hnymn 4.77-78. 441</page><page sequence="12">442 JONAS JOLLE exchange of images and metaphors makes a literal reading difficult, if it is possible or desirable at all. Also the verb "umschlingen" (1. 24), used mostly for plants (as in Schlingpflanze), seems to point toward its etymological cognate "Schlangewandelnd" (1. 27) at the end of the stanza. In a growingly complex imagery the river is further entwined with the organic imagery of plants and snakes. The neologism "Schlangewandelnd" (1. 27) together with the figure of the temptress briefly evokes the legend of the Fall. Yet the allusions to the biblical paradise are wilfully capricious in the "Gesang", where the prelapsarian state is almost impatiently dismissed before the river writhes hurriedly out of the valley, seemingly instigating its own fall by assuming the shape of the snake.2" The next three stanzas that follow the river across the plain make up more than half the entire poem. The move out of the (alpine) valley is also a move into human civilisation (11. 28-52): Bache schmiegen Sich gesellig an Nun tritt er In die Ebne silberprangend Und die Ebne prangt mit ihm Und die Flisse von der Ebne Und die Bache von Geburgen Jauchzen ihm und rufen: Bruder!

It seems the reference to Hercules' strangling the snakes in his cradle may also subtly allude to the serpent course of the river.</page><page sequence="13">M L N Brtder! Nimm die Brfider von der Ebne Nimm die Bruder von Gebfirgen Mit zu deinem Vater mit. Most of the stanza is made up of the choir of streams and tributaries that speak to the main river (11. 35-52). That river in turn speaks only one line at the very beginning of the next stanza (1. 53). The "Bruderquellen" (1. 16) that flowed into the stream in the third stanza are now joined by larger rivers, which are still designated as "Brfider" (1. 36). The way they approach the main river echoes the temptations in the last stanza, where the flowers "seine Knie umschlingen" (1. 24) und "Ihm mit Liebesaugen schmeicheln" (1. 25). After resisting that temptation and instigating his own fall, "Schlangewandelnd" (1. 27), the streams now "schmiegen I sich [...] an" (11. 28-29). This cluster of schl- or schm- sounds, the initial fricative followed by a liquid or a labial, may draw attention to the sound of water flowing, but it also links the unwelcome temptation of love in the previous stanza with the more welcome following he now receives. Stanzas one to five have followed the river from the source and just beyond the limits of the locus amoenus and, in a parallel change, the third person from childhood to maturity. While the river flows further toward the sea, accumulating and accelerating, the develop- ment of the human figure does not proceed from maturity further into old age. What has been for the first five stanzas a parallel movement, dependent on the "semantic interweaving" discussed earlier, is now brought to a halt as the river flows into the plain. The term of human development, on which one half of the predicate exchange depends, is quietly subsumed into the larger term of "religious-historical foundation" also mentioned earlier. There is a break between the two terms, but that break is smoothed by the term of the river which now borrows predicates from a religious following. The other streams address the river as their "Bruder" (1. 35) and refer to themselves as his "Brfider" (1. 36). Transferring such familial terms to fellow religious followers has become idiomatic. Also the naming of the "ewgen Ozean" (1. 38), the ultimate destination of the river, as "Vater" (1. 39) makes that destination religious as well as geographi- cal. However, the river's striving toward the father and toward God is the striving not only of an individual soul but also of a religious community. 443</page><page sequence="14">JONAS J0LLE The original dialogue version has "Bache schmiegen I Sich gesellschaftlich an ihn" (11. 29-30), where the revised monologue merely has "gesellig" (1. 29). The first version, nearly impossible to scan, stands uneasily as an almost technical term next to "schmiegen", and indeed uneasily in the whole poem. If the word stresses the communal aspect of religious following, it does so at the expense of the individual experience. The difference between "gesellschaftlich" and "gesellig" here is perhaps that between the established Lutheranism of the Free City of Frankfurt and inspired pietistic prayer circles. The choir of the "Flisse" (1. 33) and the "Bache" (1. 34) that strive toward the "Alten Vater" (1. 37) reveals some affinity with "Ganymed" where the "Allfreundlicher Vater" (1. 32) is also established as the telos of the whole poem. The "sehnende Liebe" (1. 25) in "Ganymed" are the "Sehnenden" (1. 42) in the "Gesang". The open arms and welcoming embrace of the father are common to both poems (Kahn 27). The "weitverbreiten Armen" (1. 39) of the sea are anticipated in the prose dialogue of the drama fragment. Halima questions Mahomet about the nature of his god, to which Mahomet answers enigmatically (MA 1.1:517, 11. 27-30): Halima: [...] Hast du Arme den ausgebreiteten zu fassen. Mahomet: Starkere brennendere als diese, die ffr deine Liebe dir danken. To these lines there is a further parallel in "Ganymed" where the poetic voice exclaims in the second stanza: DaB ich dich fassen mogt In diesen Arm! The reciprocity between the individual and the father, the god or any absolute underlies the whole movement in these poems. The aim is a coming together on equal terms and not a quiet subsumption. Thus the river does not rush toward an indifferent end, but toward its own "Erzeuger" (1. 71) and hence, in a sense, toward its own origin whence it came. Perhaps it is therefore wrong to speak of the telos of the river or the religious-historic foundation as a linear develop- ment.29 The telos is rather the movement forward to its own source. The hill that stands in the way of the small streams and rivers and dams up the water in a "Teich" (1. 48) is seen as an obstruction to its 29 Saran.

The aim of the rivers is the sea, and anything standing in the way of that is seen as unnatural.:" This teleological view of the river's purpose and direction is countered in a much later sonnet by the older Goethe, entitled "Machtiges Uberraschen" of 1807/1808 (MA 9:12). There the virtue lies in checking and containing the flow of the river. The sonnet deserves to be quoted in full, the significant parallels with "Mahomets Gesang" being highlighted: Ein Strom entrauscht umw6lkten Felsensaale Dem Ozean sich eilig zu verbinden; Was auch sich spiegeln niag von Grund zu Griinden, Er wandelt unaufhaltsam fort zu Tale. Damonisch aber stfirzt mit einem Mal - Ihr folgten Berg und Wald in Wirbelwinden - Sich Oreas, Behagen do-t zu finden, Und hemmt den aauif, begrenzt die weite Schale. Die Welle sprufht, tund staunt zutrick iund weichet, Und schwillt bergan, sich immer selbst zu trinken; Gehemmt ist nun zum Vater hin das Streben. Sie schwankt tund ruht, zum See zuriickgedeichet; Gestirne, spiegelnd sich, beschauni das Blinken Des Wellenschlags am Fels, ein neues Leben. In the sonnet, it is Oreas and not the river that is demonic in damming up the water. Where the "Sternenblick" in the "Gesang" is located at the source, the "Gestirne" in the sonnet can see themselves in the water only when it has come to rest.:; The "Teich" in the hymn is a wholly negative image of stagnation, whereas in the sonnet the "See" is an image of fulfilment, "ein neues Leben", and the "Entsagung" of the older Goethe. There are perhaps few poems that better illustrate the different ages of Goethe as a poet: where the "Gesang" in many ways epitomises the Sturmt und Drang and rhapsodises freely on the "Strom des Genies",:' the sonnet is splendidly crafted, almost high-handed in its mastery of the Petrarchan form. 30 K.F.

MAA 1.2:206. 445</page><page sequence="16">JONAS J0LLE The seventh stanza opens with the one line spoken by the river before the poetic narrative takes over again (11. 53-59): Kommt ihr alle! - Und nun schwillt er Herrlicher, ein ganz Geschlechte Tragt den Fursten hoch empor Und im rollenden Triumphe Gibt er Landern Namen, Stadte Werden unter seinem FuB. Accepting the influx of all the small streams and rivers, perhaps the following of many new proselytes, the main river now moves across the plain and into civilisation. "Im rollenden Triumphe" (1. 57) also suggest the triumphal chariot of the human figure who is now described as a "Ffirst" (1. 56), not unlike the ending of "An Schwager Kronos" where the poetic speaker imagines himself being received into the Underworld as a prince. As the river moves further through the plain, it also founds civilisation. The river does more than irrigate gardens and turn mill-wheels; its very course determines the layout of entire civilisations. Rivers also give names to countries (1. 58), as in the country between the Euphrates and the Tigris called Mesopotamia. The last two lines of the stanza exhibit another instance of semantic interweaving: "Stadte I Werden unter seinem FuB" (11. 58-59). First the lines closely echo a line from the fourth stanza: "Unter seinem FuBtritt Blumen" (1. 19).33 The exchange of predicates that takes place between the river and the human figure, when the poem speaks of the foot (-step) of the stream, is obvious in both instances. Yet the passage from the seventh stanza adds another metaphorical level where cities seem to grow in the footstep of the human figure. The image of something following in someone's footsteps is an old metaphor, but fused with the river metaphor it creates a strange alienating effect, by adding what reads like a human prosthesis to the stream, or to put it differently, the flow of the river is extended by a human limb that leaves vestiges of civilisation on the untilled land. Throughout the poem the imaginative ambiguity in the imagery is kept in fine balance and the poem refuses to come down either on the side of the river or on the side of the human figure. The eighth stanza was largely rewritten when Goethe abandoned " Cf. "Wanderers Sturmlied" (11. 14-17), "Wie mit Blumenfiuen I [...] I I Pythius Apollo". 446</page><page sequence="17">MLN the original dialogue form and fused it into a single monologue. As the river accelerates it leaves behind the cities it has created and flows on toward the sea (11. 60-63): Unaufhaltsam rauscht er uiber LaBt der Tiirne Flammengipfel Marmorhauser eine Schopfung Seiner Fulle hinter sich. The same lines in the original dialogue version are noticeably different, as they are spoken by Fatema (11. 61-64): Doch ihn halten keine Stadte, Nicht der Tiirme Flammengipfel, Marmorhauser, Monumente Seiner Gute, seiner Macht. In both versions, the river moves beyond the cities and the civilisations he has founded. The hymn adds the explicative line "Unaufhaltsam rauscht er uber" (1. 60) which is not found in the original version. Also where the hymn is more neutral in describing the motion of the river: "LaBt [...] II [...] hinter sich" (11. 60-63), the dialogue is slightly more aggressive in renouncing the wonders of civilisation: "Doch ihn halten keine Stadte" (1. 61). More importantly, however, the revised version (and all the following versions of the hymn) cover up an important compositional structure of the original. We recall the imagery of the foot at the end of the seventh stanza and how that imagery is already anticipated in the fourth stanza. There are further parallels between the two passages from the original dialogue version that are best illustrated thus::4 20 Unter seinem FuBtritt Blumeen, (o Stindte werden unter seinem FuB! 21 Und die Wiese lebt von 22 Seinern Hauch. 23 Doch ihn hilt kein Schattental, (i Doch ihn halten keine Stidte, 2: Keine Blunmen, (2 Nicht der Tiirme Flammengipfel, Although these parallels may seem obvious, they are only visible if we go back to the original dialogue version. In the first passage, the river seeks to escape the paradisial valley with its temptation of (female) love that the human figure spurns. As we have seen, the river instigates its own fall and writhes wistfully out of the locus 4 11. 20-24 and 11. 60-62 respectively, fr-om the dialogue version. MA 1.1:518-59. 447</page><page sequence="18">JONAS JOLLE amoenus and into the plain. The river runs away from the ensnarement of the "Liebesaugen" (1. 25) and from the stagnation that threatens it on its course. In the second passage the threat of stagnation is as explicit as in the first, since both speak of something holding the river back. In both cases, the human figure refuses to be held back either by the splendour of the cities or by love. We recall how in the sonnet Oreas' demonic damming up of the stream was seen as something entirely positive and necessary. Here, however, the twofold insistence, at the beginning and the end of the poem, "Doch ihn halten keine" makes it clear that nothing must come in the way of the river's course. The "Flammengipfel" (1. 62) of the towers have been understood as the reflection of the setting sun (Wellbery 145-7). Such empirical identification of visual effects might well have been too trivial, were it not that it indirectly tells us that as the river flows beyond the cities and further toward the sea, the sun is also setting. As the poem moves to its close and the stream runs further toward its destination, the course of the sun is also completed. Thus the three images of completion are brought together in the same way as in "An Schwager Kronos" (11. 26-29): Ab dann frischer hinab Sieh die Sonne sinkt! Eh sie sinkt, eh mich faBt Greisen im Moore Nebelduft Here, toward the end of the poem, the end of the coach-journey, a grim vision of death and the sinking sun are compressed into an image of great immediacy. The last two stanzas see the river off as it flows toward the ocean, having put civilisation and the cities behind him. The ninth stanza briefly introduces the mythological figure of Atlas as an image of the river (11. 64-68): Zedernhauser tragt der Atlas Auf den Riesenschultern, sausend Wehen iber seinem Haupte Tausend Segel auf zum Himmel Seine Macht und Herrlichkeit. Atlas is the titan who holds up the pillars of the universe and supports the heavenly sphere on his shoulders. Here the image of the titan is fused with the dominant river image, so that Atlas is seen carrying ships on his shoulders. If in the seventh stanza the flow of the 448</page><page sequence="19">M L N river is extended by a human limb ("FuB", 1. 59), here the river is given a full human torso. Carrying the ships on his shoulders, he has their sails blowing over his head. It is almost as if through the metaphor one can see the mythological figure (literally) rising out of the water with ships on his shoulder and sails wafting toward the sky. The hyperbaton of the last four lines in the stanza depends on the verb "wehen" (1. 66), which is put to new, extravagant use. The verb usually takes as its subject wind and weather or the object being moved in such a fashion. Here it is transferred to the sails, but as its object it has the abstract "Seine Macht und Herrlichkeit". The sails therefore waft 'his' power and glory toward the sky. There is again a parallel between the move "auf zum Himmel" (1. 67) here and the "Nach dem Himmel" (1. 12) in the opening. Also in the dialogue version there is a correspondence between the "Monumente I Seiner Giite, seiner Macht" (11. 23-24) and "Seine Macht und Herrlichkeit" (1. 29). The last stanza now interprets the foregoing in more anthropomor- phic terms by asserting their likeness (11. 69-72): Und so tragt er seine Brfider Seine Schatze seine Kinder Deim erw-artenden Erzeuger Freutdebrausend an das Herz. As the river flows into the ocean, the poem comes immediately to a halt, although ending appropriately with the "Herz" (1. 72) of its progenitor. Conversely, when the song ends, the river has also ended its soft run from the source to the ocean. The initial "so" refers back to the previous stanza, but also perhaps further back, to suggest a comparative link: in this way he carries... Yet the last stanza does not reduce the metaphor back to one literal term. It keeps the ambiguity of the imagery until the very end. The "Bruder" (1. 69) refer back to the influx of the streams and rivers from the plain, and the "Kinder", as an extension of the familial terms, may refer to a new generation of followers. It describes the ocean as the "erwartenden Erzeuger", not only the destination of the river, but also its progenitor. Already in the seventh stanza the choir of streams and rivers spoke of "dem ewgen Ozean I Der mit weitverbreiten Armen I Unsrer wartet" (11. 38-40). As we have seen, the reciprocity of desire, central to "Ganymed", also determines the course of the liver in the "Gesang". The composite "Freudebrausend an das Herz" (1. 72) is a typical Goethean neolo- gism of the Sturm und Drang period. His translation of Pindar's 449</page><page sequence="20">JONAS J0LLE Olympian 5 similarly has "mit freudewarmem Herzen" (MA 1.1:218, 1. 5) for the straight-forward "kardiai gelanei" (01. 5.2).35 The "Herz" on which the stanza ends, is the source that the river has been moving toward through the whole poem.36 There is a strong correspondence between the source of the river and the heart of father as pulsating centres of individuality. In the prose monologue of the drama fragment, Mahomet says: "Sonn dir gluhenden weiht sich das glihend Herz" (MA 1.1:516, 1. 18). There are similar, repeated references to water and warmth emanating from an internalised point in "Wander- ers Sturmlied" and in "Promtheus".37 By setting up, in the first and last line, the "Felsenquell" and the "Herz" of the father figure as the parameters of the river's course and of human development, the poem again underwrites not only the predicate exchange between the two mutually informing metaphors but also the reciprocity of desire between the human figure and his father. Hegel already identified how in "Mahomets Gesang" two "selbstdndige Erscheinungen" elucidate each other, "ohne die Bedeutung als solche innerhalb des Bildes selbst zur Sprache zu bringen". We have showed how the terms of the river and of human and religious development are entwined in such a predicate exchange throughout the "Gesang". Moreover the river is entwined not only with the terms of human development, but also with the terms of poetic language. The river in the "Gesang" also flows like the Pindaric mountain stream, thereby prefiguring the poem's own free-flowing rhythms and its associative rush of images. The old affinity between the imagery of rivers and poetry is put to new and different use in Goethe's poem, thereby laying out the course not only for his own "Gesang der Geister uber den Wassern" but also for H6lderlin's Stromdichtungen. Only if we take the river image to be more than an arbitrary motif and more than a "hinkender Vergleich" (Weimar 51), can we fully appreciate how "Mahomets Gesang" mediates between its different terms and ties them together in a semantic nexus that mark the beginning of a new genre of river-poems.
