Tayo is a product of two prominent art departments in Nigeria: that of Ahmadu Bello University in Zaria, where he received his B.A. in Fine and Applied Arts; and that of the University of Nigeria, Nsukka, where he received his M.F.A. His firm foundation in a structured undergraduate art curriculum, combined with a focussed experiment based in the graduate school, is evident in his tech- nical dexterity and stylistic thrust. Tayo is also one of a group of artists of the Nsukka school who have found in a traditional art form the creative inspiration and visual vocabulary needed for self-expression and individuality in modern times. This art form, known as uli, is practiced by Igbo women in southeastern Nigeria. The geometric, animal, and vegetable motifs that make up uli are applied to the body and to walls. Traditional artists know the symbolic significance of the pictorial language and the process of drawing and painting the pat- terns and ordering the design elements on the body. The prominent Nigerian artist Uche Okeke points out that the uli artist has devel- oped an art that reaffirms traditional societal values under the guidance of the goddess Ala, the source of life and keeper of these val- ues ("Igbo Drawing and Painting: Two Little Known Art Forms," Ufahamu, vol. 6, no. 2 [1976], pp. 106-15). Okeke introduced this ancient art form and its intrinsic values into his work in the early 1960s. The form has been promoted further not only by Tayo but by artists like Obiora Udechukwu and Olu Oguibe. Each in his own individual style uti- lizes uli art as an ideological referent and exploits its design elements; each is a leader in drawing on a rich tradition of the past for images of the present. In a statement that Tayo wrote for this exhibition he said, "In my paintings over the past ten years, I have tried to make a con- scious attempt at infusing Uli symbols with my Yoruba background. Unlike traditional Uli wall painters, I am evolving a more organ- ic form of presentation without totally aban- doning the use of Uli symbols as decorative elements." In his watercolor paintings these symbols of the past serve as visual bridges.

Tayo uses uli elements to synthesize various levels of the picture plane. He careful- ly integrates these elements by placing them at key points in the composition. Tayo's watercolors are by and large soft and luminous. Some invoke a feeling of fluid movement throughout the surface, and oth- ers reverberate with rough texture. The artist uses color as form and object, sometimes with a limited palette of earth tones-reds, yellows, and purples-that give a sense of the uli tradition. One example in the exhibi- tion, Dream of the Hunters, abounded with curvilinear forms. Balance and rhythm of movement were controlled by the way the two Isi niwoji, or kola-head motifs, were con- nected. The story was told through what Tayo refers to as evolving organic forms. The simplicity of the painting lay in the way space was utilized and figures represented; soft contours contrasted with sharp silhou- ettes of the figures within the evolving frame. In an interview I conducted at the time of the exhibition, Tayo said that he is at ease with many different media and that he prefers watercolor because it is easy to trans- port; he admitted, however, that it is a diffi- cult medium to master. About his use of uli symbols he told me: "I use uli because it is organic and I use it as an elemental design. I cross two barriers, Igbo and Yoruba. I believe that one should not be limited." Regarding the creative process, the artist remarked that symbolism in his work is not forced: some- times it comes directly, at others it is impro- vised. This was illustrated in Dream of the Hunters by the use of the kola-head motif. In both Igbo and Yoruba traditions, prayers and offerings are made through the use of this fruit. One could say that the elephant por- trayed in this work was a dream-like interpre- tation. Indeed there was no clear form and no attempt to make an anatomically realistic fig- ure, and this very distortion gave a magical presence to the beast that was to be confront- ed by the hunters. When I asked the artist whom he creates his art for, he answered: "I create for myself. I state what I feel at the time of creation-however it comes out, it is. I don't disagree with it. I see my work as music, play, or dance, and if the audience applauds I am happy. If not, I want you to know that I dance because I want to dance, not for praise." I mentioned that I saw traces of Uche Okeke and Obiora Odechukwu in his work, and Tayo agreed that the latter artist was the one person who has influenced him the most. As he gained maturity, he said, he began to develop his own style and approach. Why the title "Towards Essence?" Tayo related it to traditional African art, which is geared toward essence as opposed to imitation or realism. "I approach my work with that same intent. Mind you, uli art is about essence." When asked about the mental prepa- ration for and process of painting, he explained, "As I paint, I am at a different level of coherence. I enjoy my company. I am, you could say, in a trance, on a different plane, and it takes weeks to get to painting, sometimes more. No sketches and no plans. I do not draw, I paint to draw." One learns more about essence precisely because of the seemingly simple but actually complex dialogue commu- nicated in paintings like Ifa Requirements, on display in the exhibition. There in the celestial clouds, geometric shapes seemed to bear a geometric relation to one another. There was a continuity of mood in the evolution of forms; one felt a presence whose eyes seemed to fol- low one with hypnotic sway. There existed a certain harmonious conflation of abstract and semirepresentational forms. Light gathered DREAM OF THE HUNTERS BY TAYO ADENAIKE. WATERCOLOR. AFTER THE INITIATION BY TAYO ADENAIKE.

Here Tayo seemed to have extended his use of symbols from uli to Ifa, the Yoruba oracle. The allusion to cir- cular moon trays or divination boards was evident. These boards are usually decorated with anthropomorphic or simple motifs and are endowed with symbolism. In Ifa Requirements the figure on the right appeared to be the Ifa; at lower right was the curved cup in which the vegetable powder used to inscribe the symbols is kept. Since Ifa is said to have been sent by God to help in sickness and childbearing, one is inclined to associate the stick figure in the center of the Ifa image with that of birth. Synthesis and fusion with myths and folk- lore of the traditional past have become a powerful vehicle for the modern African artist who chooses to use these elements, "Return to the source" has been a slogan to most African artists in search of alternative means of artistic expression. However, the real test lies in how these traditional motifs and symbols are used in modern artistic terms. It is clear that the impact of what has taken place in Nsukka over the last twenty or so years of experimentation has benefited artists like Tayo, who is an original and sub- stantive artist of modern uli.
