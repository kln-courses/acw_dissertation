<plain_text><page sequence="1">YUTA MANIKAY: JUXTAPOSITION OF ANCESTRAL AND CONTEMPORARY ELEMENTS IN THE PERFORMANCE OF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS* by Steven Knopoff Introduction' Among the earlier views and assumptions about non-Western music that have come to be reconsidered in the present period of musicological self-reflection are those concerning issues of conservatism (or stability) and innovation (or change). In a number of cultural areas, a bias among researchers towards perceived conservatism was influenced by both indigenous and Western beliefs. Clunies-Ross has aptly summarized the bi-cultural impact upon the perception of conservatism in the case of Australian Aboriginal song: . it is only relatively recently that scholars have begun to question the ideology of stability of songs and their meanings that has been espoused by Aborigines and researchers alike. Two converging ideologies have ensured that the matter remained beyond question. For their part, Aborigines have tended to communicate an ideology of stability to enquiries, and the enquirers have tended to accept this ideology at face value because they have themselves brought to their task prior assumptions about the stability of oral traditions. These assumptions derive from our own culture's emphasis on the unchanging nature of artistic forms, especially of those that have the authority of antiquity" (Clunies-Ross 1987: 4). Assumptions about conservatism in Australian Aboriginal song have perhaps been most pronounced in the case of desert cultures. Musical factors influencing impressions of desert conservatism have included the common use of fixed texts and isorhythmic patterns. Non-musical factors militating against the consideration of innovation included the research orientations of many field workers, who, as recently as the early 1960s, were most concerned with salvaging the remnants of Aboriginal cultures. Since the 1960s, however, enquirers have increasingly devoted attention to issues of adaptation and change. (See Berndt and Tonkinson 1988: 4). Issues related to innovation or flexibility have been considered in recent writings on desert Aboriginal song. Wild (1987) examines a number of broad factors of musical change, such as historical migrations of people and the process of 'mythologizing' historical events; and notes that the authority ascribed by the Warlpiri to their song texts allows sung performance to serve as both "a conservative force and a means of legitimising change" (Wild 1987: 106). Through transcriptional analyses of recorded performances of Central Australian song, Barwick (1989) points to ways in which singers' extemporal combining of melodic, *Read at the 31st ICTM World Conference in Hong Kong July 1991.</page><page sequence="2">KNOPOFF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS / 139 rhythmic and textual elements reflects a musical protocol marked by high degrees of both flexibility and conservatism. Compared to long-standing assumptions regarding conservatism in desert song, early writings discussing song in Arnham Land cultures (including the Yolngu) reveal more of a duality of opinion regarding issues of conservatism and innovation. There is no question that the 'authority of antiquity' made its impression upon those working in the area. However, the sheer degree of complexity and variation inherent in Arnhem Land song, including a more improvisational handling of text and rhythm, helped prevent enquirers from imagining that song performance could be devoid of innovative elements. This attitude may be seen in Jones's remarks on Arnhem Land song: "In their systematic introduction of new, but related material, their intricate development of fundamentally simple ideas into struc- tures of great subtlety and organisation, and their use of almost every possible technique of rhythmic and melodic variation, the Arnhem Land song-cycles represent a stage of musical thinking normally considered impossible in primitive peoples . .. There can be little doubt that the unusually advanced techniques of Arnhem Land music are the work of generations of specialists, who have been allowed the necessary freedom to create and develop as well as to preserve" (Jones 1957: 27-28). To date, no studies of Arnham Land song have dealt extensively with issues of conservatism or change. Recent studies (Stubington 1978, 1982; Clunies-Ross and Wild 1984) have, however, considered song structure in the light of performer interaction and performance context, thus providing steps towards understanding the relationship between fixed and contingent elements of songs. The primary focus of this paper lies somewhere between the broader issue of long-term change versus conservatism in song style and repertoire, and the more focused issue of flexibility versus stability in the context of extemporized performance. Specifically examined are the ways in which contemporary and conservative elements are conventionally juxtaposed within a single performance practice, and the ideological significance of the differential treatment of new and old elements within this practice. The Cultural Setting The Yolngu,2 who today number a few thousand people, live on portions of their traditional land, which comprises some 8500 km2 in the northeastern corner of the Arnhem Land Aboriginal Reserve, Northern Territory, Australia. Yirrkala, the easternmost of four major Yolngu settlements, is situated at the junction of the Arafura Sea and the Gulf of Carpentaria. About 1200 Yolngu belonging to some 14 patrilineal clans presently reside in the Yirrkala area. According to Yolngu belief, during the eternal ancestral past creatively powerful spirit beings went on crisscrossing journeys, encountering and interacting with each other, as well as with a myriad of lesser spirit entities, including humans. The great spirit beings left physical traces of their</page><page sequence="3">140 / 1992 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC presence in the environment and in some cases gave birth to people. Most importantly, they gave groups of people their clan identities by bestowing them upon unique religious estates comprised of areas of land, language, ceremonies, songs, dances, designs and sacred objects. The Yolngu term wangarr refers to both the great spirit beings and the time in the distant past when they undertook their creative travels.3 The importance of the ancestral past is reflected in a conservative ideology that bears upon interrelated religious, political and (as will be seen) musical practices. According to this ideology, authority and authenticity are ascribed in particular to things believed to have originated during the wangarr time. Even contemporary phenomena tend to (and ideally should) reflect aspects of the behavioral and conceptual 'blueprint' established by the ancestral beings.4 Prior to this century, the Yolngu received annual visits by seamen from the Sulawesian port of Macassar. These Indonesians voyaged to north coastal Australia in order to harvest trepang, also called b&amp;che-de-mer or sea cucumber, a delicacy in the Far East. The visits, which occurred for perhaps 300 years (see MacKnight 1971), ended in 1906 when the Australian government prohibited foreign fishing off its shores. The long- term contact left a lasting impact upon compartmentalized aspects of Yolngu material, linguistic and mythological culture, but apparently did not affect their basic social structure (see Warner 1958 [1937]: 464-66; Morphy 1984: 1). Regular contact between Yolngu and Europeans began with the establishment of three Methodist missions in the region. The second of these settlements was established at Yirrkala in 1934. Whereas the Yolngu had traditionally moved about in small groups, foraging over selected tracts of land, the attractions of the Mission led to a dwindling of bush residency, and by 1970 the Yolngu population at Yirrkala had swelled to about 800 (Williams 1986: 21). In the late 1960s, against the will of the Yolngu, a large scale bauxite mining operation and supporting township was established within 20 km of Yirrkala.s For the past two decades the local mining town and its (now) 4000 non-Aboriginal residents have provided the primary venue for Yolngu contact with Anglo-Australian culture, notably including supermarkets, alcohol, a wide range of popular music cassettes and, more recently, commercial video cassette rentals. The Yirrkala mission ceased operation in the early 1970s, and adminis- trative control of the settlement passed to a local Aboriginal council. Over the past two decades roughly two thirds of Yirrkala-area Yolngu have moved away from the settlement to live at about 20 'homeland centers', these being small communities located at traditional campsites in the bush, 20-150 km from Yirrkala. While continuing to use Yirrkala as a commun- ications and supplies base, homeland residents enjoy access to a more traditional lifestyle, and gain relief from overcrowding and from adverse influences of the mining town. Despite the great impact that Crown Law, market economy, Christianity and alcohol have had upon Yirrkala Yolngu life, an orientation toward traditional cultural practices and values remains pronounced. Most</page><page sequence="4">KNOPOFF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS / 141 prominent among the mainstays of traditional culture are frequently held public ceremonies such as funerals and circumcisions. A number of significant changes in the structure and content of ceremonies have occurred since the 1930s. Ceremonial performance practices may nonetheless be described as traditional since, regardless of these historical changes, they remain inexorably linked to traditional leadership, values and custom. The knowledge generated and perpetuated during ceremonies serves to define traditional culture, both in relation to its own past, and in contrast to other, distinctly non-traditional elements of contemporary life. Of the two (sometimes three) musical genres employed during funerals and other public ceremonies, clan songs are by far the most prevalent, comprising or accompanying the bulk of ceremonial activity. Yolngu Clan Songs Clan songs are sung by one or more men6 accompanying themselves with pairs of hard wood clapsticks, and further accompanied by a single didjeriduist. (A didjeridu is a 4V2 to 5 foot section of a branch or trunk of a eucalyptus tree that has been hollowed out by termites. It is blown like a trumpet, but with a looser embouchure, and provides a continuous drone through the technique of circular breathing. The complex rhythmic patterns of the Yolngu didjeridu are produced by inflecting the air-flow with the tongue, diaphragm and cheeks; by altering the harmonic resonance with the cheeks and throat; by resonating the vocal chords; and by alternating blowing the fundamental with a single overtone pitched between an octave and an eleventh above the fundamental7). Clan songs may be sung both with and without accompanying women's and men's mimetic dances.8 The smallest independent unit of clan song performance is the single song verse, called yutunggurr, which literally means 'thigh'. Individual verses typically require from 20 seconds to a little over a minute to perform, and singers generally pause to rest a bit between verses. At funerals, clan song performance by a single group of singers typically runs from two to four hours, but may in certain contexts last considerably longer. Clan song verses are commonly comprised of three parts-an introduction (ngurruwanga, literally 'nose-speech' or humming), a main body (called manikay, literally 'song'), and an unaccompanied vocal coda (also called ngurruwanga). During the (usually brief) introduction, the lead singer establishes an appropriate clapstick pattern and quietly intones a low tonic. He may sing a few burden syllables, convey information regarding the song to the other performers, comment on something unrelated to the music, or begin improvising lines of song text. At the same time, the other singers begin to tap their sticks in accord with the lead singer, while the didjeriduist makes his entrance--typically two or three short, punctuated fundamental tones followed by a brief improvised passage pending the beginning of the verse's main body. The second part of a verse (its main body) commences as the singers begin to improvise lines of text appropriate to the given song subject, utilizing melodic formula associated with the song-owning clan. The</page><page sequence="5">142 / 1992 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC didjeridu accompaniment involves fairly repetitive rhythmic vamp(s) appropriate to the singers' clapstick pattern. Sometimes there are changes of stick and/or didjeridu patterns within the main body of the verse. The conclusion of the verse's main body is signalled by a didjeridu cadential figure ending on the overtone. The completion of the didjeridu's cadence marks the end of the main body, and the beginning of the vocal coda. At this juncture the didjeridu and sticks fall silent while the singers extemporize a few additional lines of texts.9 The primary subject matter of clan songs are various ancestral entities (or totems). These are sung in the form of animals, plants, natural elements, cultural artifacts and anthropomorphic spirit-beings, including ordinary people. Clan song texts allude to various idiomatic qualities or behaviors of totems: the characteristic cry or feather-ruffling of a bird or wandering gait of a dog, the colored pattern on an insect, the formation or splitting apart of clouds, the floating of debris on the surface of a river, the wake forming behind a paddling canoe, the spread of fire through the bush.'1 Song texts are always improvised, but make regular use of certain key words, including many alternate names for given totems and places. Conceptually and in performance, clan song subjects are organized into partly overlapping groups or series associated with particular topographical areas (e.g., forest, beach, salt flat) and with events that occurred in these locations during the ancestral past. There are conventions that determine the ordering of song subjects during performance, but there is no single 'correct' or 'complete' rendering of each song series. Rather, particular song subjects (as well as strings of text alluding to particular details of ancestral events) may be included or excluded in accordance with the immediate performance context, and at singers' discretion. Figure 1 indicates some similarities and differences in the sequences of songs sung at two different performances by Ngaymil clan singers. The first of these performances was elicited for recording purposes, while the second took place in conjunction with a funeral; both lasted between 1?/2 and 2 hours, including rest between verses. In both performances anywhere from two to nine verses was devoted to each song subject. Subjects 1-10 in Sequence 1 and subjects 1-8 in Sequence 2 allude to rain falling in the high forest country and subsequent movement (of the rain, birds/animals and people) down toward a bay. In Sequence 1, the movement toward the bay is by land (specifically, along an ancestral path); in Sequence 2 it is by water (along a river). In Sequence 2, several verses concern the growth of termite mounds and pandanus trees associated with the rainy season (subjects 3-4). By contrast, in sequence 1 there is only a single brief reference to the termite mounds in the last verse of subject 2 (rain). In Sequence 1, subjects 11-18 concern an ancestral stingray hunt: the walk down to the water, the search for and spearing of the stingray, the subsequent walk back to camp, the ritual mixing of the meat with the fatty liver (and rolling the combined product into balls to be eaten). In Sequence 2, the singing at the bay concerns an ancestral mangrove log drifting in the water (subjects 9-11, 15-16) as well as additional rainfall (subjects 12-14).</page><page sequence="6">KNOPOFF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS / 143 Individual totems (song subjects) and mythically related sets of totems are held in common by more than one clan of the same moiety;11 this fact is one basis of asserted solidarity between clans. However, the fact that no two clans possess entirely equivalent totemic repertoires, and the fact that two clans will, through song text, locate a commonly owned totem on their own respective lands, helps ensure that each clan has a unique claim to its particular estate.

The male elders generally looked to as the leaders of their clans (there is no fixed political hierarchy in Yolngu society) usually act as song leaders by controlling the choice and flow of song subject matter during performance.'2</page><page sequence="7">144 / 1992 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC The authority of clan songs-as the embodiment of clan histories and as title deeds to clan estates-derives from their creation and distribution during the ancestral past. A clan's ancestral (and inviolate) musical possessions include the key names and phrases of its song texts; idiomatic melodic formula called dhambu (which literally means 'head'); all clapstick patterns (bilma) belonging to three named categories, and some of the clapstick patterns belonging to a fourth category (see discussion of clapstick patterns below). Yuta Manikay ('Newsong Verse') Despite the ideological importance of ancestral song elements, ceremonial song performance also incorporates innovative or otherwise contemporary elements. Contemporary elements in clan songs are most clearly manifested in a category of clan song verse called yuta manikay, which literally means 'new song'. It will be seen that yuta manikay are not entirely new, but rather involve combinations of old and new thematic, textual and/or musical elements. In order to avoid confusion with Western notions of what might constitute a 'new song', I form a compound word in translating yuta manikay as 'newsong verse'. For the sake of clarity, I will refer to verses which are not yuta manikay (i.e., which ostensibly involve no contemporary elements) as 'oldsong verse' (ngiitjilingu manikay).'3 All newsong verses are characterized by the following: they are acknowledged as the creations of everyday, human singers; their creation is inspired by some contemporary event; and through a metaphoric or physical affinity, some aspect of the inspiring contemporary event is linked to an ancestral song subject, resulting in a juxtaposed or fused thematic content. Many, but not all, newsong verses are inspired by an event involving 'worrying', such as concern for someone's (including one's own) safety or well-being, concern for the spirit of one recently deceased, or feeling 'sorry' for a relation who has been away for a time. Newsong verses are often, but not necessarily, marked by newly added text. New text supplements rather than replaces old text, and frequently occurs as part of a vocal/instrumental refrain. The use of refrains is in itself a characteristic attribute of newsong verse. Newly added text often includes words or interjections someone spoke or felt, or references to living individuals by personal name or kinship term. The following four song texts provide comparative examples of two oldsong and two newsong verses. The four texts were transcribed from elicited recordings sung in 1989-90 by Larrtjannga Ganambarr, the Ngaymil clan elder.14 Each text is given in Dhangu (a Yolngu dialect spoken by Ngaymil), followed by a word-for-word English translation. In the translations, slashes (/) separate text corresponding to each successive word in the Yolngu transcription. The terms 'NAME OF' and 'ALT. NAME' (alternate name for) indicate the use of one of a number of song words denoting a single totem or place. CONT.ACT.MRKR.' is an abbreviation for 'continuous action marker'. In both the Dhangu and English versions a single space is inserted between the text of the main body and vocal coda.</page><page sequence="8">KNOPOFF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS / 145 The first three texts concern tawny frogmouth (dhududhudu), a widespread nocturnal bird who manifests himself in Ngaymil song as a spirit-being perhaps more man-like than bird-like. The frogmouth is sung by the Ngaymil in all their major geographic song areas. Texts 1 and 2 are from two successive and typically brief oldsong verses. In these verses, dhududhu_du (referred to by two alternate names, marrwuywuy and guluy- guluy) walks down the ancestral path from his high-forest home. His idiomatic call (consisting of his onomatopoeic name) and his crying for the deceased are heard all across Ngaymil land. A comparison of differences between these two texts gives an indication of the relationship between improvisation and the use of key song words in the creation of sung verse.

This particular newsong verse is quite old, dating probably from the mid-1930s. It was composed by _Larrtjannga's father who had been 'worrying' over his young son's excessive crying. A comparison of item 3 with items 1 and 2 shows a large similarity in the texts. The sole new text is found in an added musical refrain, the words translating simply as "oh! son".</page><page sequence="9">146 / 1992 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC SONG TEXT 3 marrwuywuy ngitjinan marrwuywuy ngitjin gurraykurraykurray rirrakay dupthuwan ngunha garanggali garrayul'yun buku-yutthun marrwuywuy gurraykurray mm... mm ... mm ... mm ... o ... yawu githu marrwuywuy gurraykurray ngitjin ngarrung dhoka balanhan yikbani bundhamarr mm... mm... mm... o... yawu githu bitjan gurraykurray wodjalin nyin djulurrdjulurr ALT.

For some clans, such as the Rirratjingu and Djambarrpuyngu, the 'home' of bulwunu is out at sea, although for the Ngaymil and Ditiwuy it is the high forest areas, called Garangga. Bulwunu is sung in a number of different mythological contexts. Text 4 is a newsong verse that stems from the mission era at Yirrkala. Larrtjannga galloped on his horse so fast that he became the wind itself. Note that the newly added text in this verse, comprising a three line refrain (beginning with the line 'gawuriwuri gawuriwuri'15) is considerably longer than the added refrain in Text 3.

Each set of comments is headed by the name of the relevant ancestral song subject. Dolphin (bulanybirr)--During a funeral held at Yirrkala in 1989, two grieving women asked a male relation to make a newsong verse for the occasion. Fulfilling their request, he chose a totemic dolphin as his primary subject matter. He added some new text, which included a refrain on the sound made by dolphins ('yo . . . , yo ...) and references to the names of the two women, sung in the context of dolphins jumping out of the water and falling on their side. This idiomatic action of dolphins is metaphorically related to the ritual act of grieving women throwing themselves to the ground at certain times during funerals (the verb duryunmirr describes both of these actions). Dingo (birrdji)-A singer and his wife found themselves lost once while driving back through the bush en route from Yirrkala to their homeland center. They heard their children back at camp calling out for their mother. New text additions include a chorus on the phrase 'oh! mother' ('ngdindi-gay) and other phrases pondering their whereabouts--'where is that place?' ('ngala dhika . . ., 'where was that place of mine?' ('nhaltjarr dhawal ngarrak . ..), and so forth. No actual references are made to birrdji, but there is an implicit connection since the ancestral dingo is a habitual wanderer, literally a lost dog in search of a road. Masked lapwing (birrkpirrk)--While attending a barbecue during a visit to Sydney, two singers saw a large flock of masked lapwings in flight. In their newsong verse commemorating the event, the only new 'text' consists of bird calls sung during an added refrain. (The use of sung renditions of bird calls commonly comprises all or part of the added text in newsong verses involving ancestral birds.)</page><page sequence="11">148 / 1992 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC Ghost associated with clans who sing Morning Star (Dhanbul wanga)-One singer and his brothers made this verse during a funeral held at Yirrkala in 1989. For several weeks during this ceremony, a number of delinquent boys were sent by the community leader to stay at a secluded men's camp about two kilometers from Yirrkala. Under the guidance of the leader's sons and other young men, the boys received training in traditional song, dance and art; danced nightly at the Yirrkala funeral, and spent time hunting traditional game. The campsite was adjacent to the billabong home of the ancestral ghost. The newsong verse (which has no added text) and its accompanying dance commemorate both the funeral itself, and the period of residency by these boys-as Dhanbul wanga-at the campsite. Thunderman and hailstones (Djambuwal ga milirrk)-During the mission era, a singer, one of his classificatory fathers and one of his classificatory mother's brothers were out one night in a canoe on a river, near a dangerous area belonging to Djambuwal the thunder- man. With the aid of a battery-powered torch, they were hunting crocodiles in order to sell the skins to European traders. They probably got too close to the dangerous area and perhaps shined the light at Djambuwal, disturbing him. Djambuwal responded with a whirlwind, hailstones and lightning. The hailstones were large and painful; the men felt fortunate to come out alive. Newly added text consists of lines such as 'where's a safer place, you two?' ('dhikanydja wiinga nhamakurriya manda'), and a repeated chorus beginning with the line 'over there, father/let's paddle, uncle' ('ngunhan bala baipa/ngalma wuypin-gam ngapipi). Floating mangrove log (woduku)-Once in 1989 some boys were stranded at night on their dinghy in a bay near Yirrkala. Their engine had run out of fuel and they had no paddles. They were like the ancestral floating log, floating in and out with the tide, and had to wait until morning to wash ashore. The newsong verse was made by a singer who was worried about the boys' safety. The newly added text is unique among newsong verse I am familiar with, as it unfolds narratively over several verses. Allusions are first made to losing sight of some familiar rocks near the shore, then to wondering about where these rocks could be, and finally to the re-sighting of the rocks. Musically, newsong verses are not created from scratch, but rather involve additions to, or re-arrangements of extant ways of singing a given song subject. In addition to the possibility of adding new text and vocal refrains, the newly composed elements of newsong verses may include changes in clapstick patterns (sometimes affecting verse structure), didjeridu or vocal rhythms, or the accompanying dance. Yolngu categorize four types of clapstick patterns: 'slow' (bulnha), 'walking' (ngarrunga), 'big' or 'important' (yindi), and 'arms' (barka). These terms may interchangeably refer to the type of clapstick pattern used in a given sung verse, or to a sung verse utilizing a given type of clapstick pattern. References to particular clapstick patterns by these names is apparently often related to their musical qualities (particularly tempo),</page><page sequence="12">KNOPOFF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS / 149 but other, non-musical factors may also play a role in the naming of clapstick patterns. One of the ways in which oldsong and newsong verses are conceptually segregated is by designation of their clapstick patterns. Clapstick patterns associated with oldsong verse may include any of the four named types. However, all the clapstick patterns associated with newsong verse are invariably called 'arms'. One common (though not essential) musical attribute idiomatic to newsong verses is the use of changing clapstick patterns in connection with vocal refrains. The restriction of acknowledged contemporary clapstick patterns to newsong arms fairly parallels the situation with didjeridu accompaniment patterns. Preliminary comparison of my own 1989-90 recordings of Yirrkala clan songs with those made by Richard Waterman (Waterman 1952-53) indicated that the didjeridu patterns used to accompany oldsong 'slow', 'big' or 'walking' verses have remained relatively stable over the past 40 years, while the accompaniments to 'arms' (in this case, both oldsong and newsong arms) have been subject to considerable stylistic variation. 16 Alterations in accompanying dances are a standard component in the performance of newsong verse. Alterations may minimally involve the re-structuring of a sequence of repetitive, iconic movements to fit a new clapstick pattern or verse structure. At times newsong dances also incorporate newly invented iconic movements that pertain to some aspect of the inspiring contemporary event. For example, one newsong verse was composed by a man who had seen a group of young people at Yirrkala sniffing petrol (gasoline) on a rainy evening.17 In addition to choreographic representation of the primary totemic song subject (rain), two new iconic gestures were also incorporated. One of these involved hand-clapping, as the petrol sniffers had clapped their hands while singing in the rain. Another newly-added gesture signified the act of inhaling the petrol fumes. Once introduced in the performance arena, a newsong verse may or may not remain in the repertoire for a period of time. Popular newsong verses may continue to be performed for many years, sometimes outliving their creators (whose names would normally still be remembered). A few newsong verses I am familiar with date from the mission era; one perhaps predates this period. Although each newsong verse is at least in part a contemporary creation, the very practice of making newsong verses is thought to be ancient. The Performance Context In the Yirrkala area funerals provide the major venue for clan song performance. Funeral ritual is enacted to ensure the safe return of the deceased's spirit to its ancestral home, and to provide an institutionalized outlet for the expression of grief and anger. But beyond this, funerals comprise an important forum for asserting the totemic histories (hence the identities) of clans, and for maintaining inter-group relations through the fulfillment of ritual obligations. (See Morphy 1984, for discussion of the thematic and sociological aspects of Yolngu funerals.)</page><page sequence="13">150 / 1992 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC At present Yirrkala-area funerals can be quite lengthy, particularly when involving the death of a respected elder. Funerals lasting two months or more are not uncommon. In such cases, at least some singing and related ritual takes place on most days, and nearly every evening. During the last few days of a funeral (agreement upon an ending day having been reached by consensus during the proceedings) there is an increasingly active community participation in dance and ritual processions, and a general buildup in the intensity of performance. It is significant that the more formal, important portions of ceremony are accompanied strictly by oldsong verse. Most notable during funerals is the final removal of the coffin from its ritual shelter just prior to burial. The dances occurring here-called gakal-are of special significance, involving the symbolic transformation of yolngu dancers into wangarr. The selection of particular wangarr used for gakal may be subject to considerable prior discussion and consensus, and the actual staging of gakal is often guided by a ritual expert, called djirrikay. Other formal funeral events accompanied by clan song performance include the ritual announcement of a death, the building of a shelter used to house the coffin prior to burial, construction of sacred sand sculptures, removal of the body from the regional hospital's morgue to the ceremonial area, a daily ritual procession by each clan to the area immediately in front of the coffin shelter, ritual cleansing by water, and ritual purification by burning leaves. In each of these cases, singers perform oldsong verse, with the choice of subject matter partly determined by (and pertaining to) the activity at hand. Formal ceremonial events, important as they are, comprise a relatively small portion of funeral performance. Most of the singing and dancing occurring during funerals is less formal in a number of respects. Most notably, there is less of a need for specific individuals (or large groups of people) to coordinate their efforts. During long stretches of informal performance, people congregate in the general ceremonial area, but come and go as they please. Groups of singers, typically comprising members of one or two clans, gather freely and perform independently of other groups similarly gathered. This type of simultaneous, proximate and unsynchronized performance of independent groups of singers is a most regular feature at Yolngu funerals. During informal periods of ceremony, newsong verses pertaining to a given primary song subject are generally sung immediately following oldsong verses pertaining to the same song subject. A fairly common practice during informal portions of ceremony is the devotion of part of a performance to singing that emphasizes newsong verse. This practice is a popular means of getting people to gather round and listen to the singing; it is also a near-requisite for full, enthusiastic participation by dancers. Conclusions The juxtaposition of ancestral and contemporary elements in newsong verse may be understood on a number of different levels. Thematically, the creation of newsong verse points to an ingrained tendency to perceive</page><page sequence="14">KNOPOFF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS / 151 contemporary phenomena in terms of ancestral precedent. This tendency both enhances the meaningfulness of everyday events, and extends the relevance of ancestral creation. With respect to musical content, the creation and performance of newsong verse provides a sanctioned means for re-working the patterns of ancestral song in the light of contemporary musical tastes. While allowing for innovation and novelty, the institutionalized restrictions placed upon the types of innovations that may occur help to conserve a core set of ancestral musical elements. During lengthy informal portions of funeral ceremonies, the popularity of newsong verse (particularly among young people and other dancers) helps to ensure continued active community participation in the proceedings. At the same time, the circumscription of newsong verse within the confines of informal portions of ceremony helps to differentiate the relative importance of formal oldsong performance, and further promotes the role of ancestral ideology in Yolngu society. NOTES 1. This paper is based on research conducted in the Yirrkala area during 1989-90, funded by a Fulbright Award, and by research grants from the Australian Institute of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies. I would like to thank Dr. Allan Marett of the University of Sydney, Dr. Stephen Wild and Dr. Kingsley Palmer of the Australian Institute for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Studies for their help in the organization and facilitation of this research. I also wish to thank Michael Christie, Bell Yung and Robert Grimes for their comments and suggestions on this paper. I am most deeply indebted to Larrtjannga Ganambarr, Roy Dadaynga Marika and Daymbalipu Mununggurr, and to many other Yolngu people at Yirrkala for their generosity as hosts and as teachers. 2. The Yolngu have traditionally employed a rich vocabulary for denoting clans and other social groupings, but until recently had no need for a word to denote their whole culture. 'Yolngu', the now-standard designation, derives from the word yolngu, meaning 'human being' or 'Aboriginal person' in each of several interrelated dialects spoken by the Yolngu. In writings prior to the 1970s, names used to designate the Yolngu included 'Murngin' and 'Wulamba'. 3. In this article, the term 'ancestral' is meant to carry the same dual connotation as the Yolngu term wangarr. 4. Morphy (1984: 16) cites the words of one Yolngu man who stated that Yolngu "'. .. are just rushing up to . .. [the ancestral beings] and trying to catch up with what they have been doing before'. 5. Actions taken by the Yolngu to prevent the loss of control of their land culminated in a case brought before the Australian Supreme Court in 1971. Although the Court ultimately determined that the Yolngu had no legal claim to their land, the publicity and thought generated by this case helped to influence Parliament's passage of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act in 1976. The Act, among other things, provided for the legal transfer of large areas of land (including all of the Arnhem Land Reserve) to traditional Aboriginal owners. 6. Although women do not sing alongside men, it is customary at certain points during funerals and circumcisions for women to engage in a form of ritual wailing called ngaitji (literally 'crying'). Both musically and textually, ngiitji may be understood as a women's version of clan song performance. In part, ngiitji involves extemporizing melodic lines in free rhythm built on the same idiomatic, clan-owned melodic characteristics used by men in their singing. The texts of ngiitji are stylistically distinct from those of men's clan song texts, but pertain to the same ancestral song subjects, and draw upon the same sets of key ancestral song words. [See C.H. Berndt (1950) for additional information on ngifiti. ]</page><page sequence="15">152 / 1992 YEARBOOK FOR TRADITIONAL MUSIC 7. The exact interval between the didjeridu's fundamental and overtone is arbitrary and contingent on the particular instrument used. From a Yolngu perspective, the precise interval between the didjeridu's fundamental and overtone pitches is musically unimportant, as are the intervals produced between the vocalist(s) and didjeridu. 8. The term 'clan song' is frequently encountered in writings pertaining to Northeast and North-Central Arnhem Land cultures. In the context of Yolngu performance, the term refers to a distinct musical genre marked by a number of musical and choreographic stylistic attributes, by its predominant use in public performance contexts, and by the fact that individual clans (or clusters of clans) assume ownership of the spirit beings who comprise the songs' subjects. Yirrkala Yolngu do not use a standard term to refer to the clan song genre, but will in given contexts designate a particular clan song repertoire or particular characteristics of clan songs. Examples would include references to 'songs associated with the Djapu clan' (Djapu manikay), songs associated with the Morning Star and its ceremony (manikay Banumbirrwu), and 'true' songs (yuwalk manikay) as opposed to various sorts of non-ceremonial 'made-up' songs (wakal manikay). 9. Occasionally a verse will comprise only two parts (introduction plus main body, or main body plus vocal coda). Omission of the introduction or vocal coda is discretionary, occurring, for example, at times when the lead singer does not want to interrupt the dancers' momentum during an energetic sequence of verses. [Further discussion of the tripartite structure of Northeast Arnhem Land clan song verses may be found in Stubington (1978). Tripartite structure in clan songs of the Anbarra of North-Central Arnhem Land is discussed by Clunies-Ross and Wild (1984).] 10. Hiatt (Hiatt and Jones 1988: 17-19) has used the Platonic notion of ideal forms to describe the similar nature of song texts sung by the Anbarra people of North-Central Arnhem Land. 11. A core Yolngu concept of complementary opposition provides that everything in the Yolngu universe, people and clans included, are either dhuwa or yirritja. 'Moiety' is an anthropological- term used to describe either of two such complimentary social divisions. Since clan songs are moiety-specific, any co-ownership of totemic subject matter may only occur between clans of a single moiety; and only men belonging to the same moiety as the song-owning clan may join in the singing and clapstick beating. However, men of either moiety may play didjeridu; and men and women of either moiety may join in the dancing. 12. Skills required of Yolngu leaders include excellent memory and the ability to extemporize song texts in performance. Most but not all clan leaders are in possession of strong, clear singing voices, and are able to sing for a few hours daily over a period of weeks. 13. In his discussions with me on this topic, _Larrtjannga in fact used the term ngiitfilingu manikay to distinguish song verses devoid of contemporary elements. It should be noted, however, that I did not otherwise encounter the term ngiitjilingu manikay, whereas yuta manikay was a commonly used term. Perhaps because most of what is sung is oldsong verse, only newsong verse would need to be specially labelled. 14. Transcription and translation of these texts would not have been possible without the assistance of Larrtjannga Ganambarr, Gurranayka Yunupingu, and Nong'ki Yunupingu. 15. Gawuriwuri was the name of the actual horse that Larrtjannga rode at the mission. This appellation was in turn derived from the name of an ancestral horse sung by a local yirritja moiety clan. 16. With respect to didjeridu accompaniments, it is important to consider the foundations of stylistic change as well as the restrictions placed upon it. Didjeridu players are nearly all teenagers or young men. While continual ceremonial performance provides would- be players with stylistic models, instrumental technique is in other ways self-taught. Boys as young as seven or eight may be seen walking around the camp casually improvising upon small-scale versions of the instrument. Twelve-year old didjeriduists may spend long hours in the bush practising with would-be singers, and challenging each other to technical duels. In this way their technical and stylistic development is partly independent from concurrent ceremonial practice. 17. Over the past generation, petrol sniffing has become an endemic problem among Aboriginal youth at a number of Arnhem Land settlements.</page><page sequence="16">KNOPOFF YOLNGU CLAN SONGS / 153 REFERENCES CITED Barwick, L.M. 1989 "Creative (Ir)regularities: The Intermeshing of Text and Melody in Performance of Central Australian Song."
