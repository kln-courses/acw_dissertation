Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, New York 10003. 192 pp. $22.95 (hardcover), $12.95 (paperback).-This is a book of discoveries, discoveries by the author and artist, Clare Walker Leslie, and discoveries by the reader. That is the wonder of drawings, you can look and appreciate what the artist saw and drew, but you can also see relationships of which the artist was unaware, and you can look through the entire book only to return later and discover in the very same drawing something entirely new. Leslie's sketches are deceptive. They appear simple, yet they capture the essence of her plant, animal, and human subjects. The pencilled notes that accompany the sketches call attention to particular details, actions, or questions that lead to a particular sketch. These same notes cause one to stop and study the sketch or, in combination with the sketch, to recall a similar incident from one's own experience. There is a lot of joy in shared experiences and the balance between sketches and brief, suggestive notes is just enough to evoke one's own memories without overwhelming them in the author's own words. This is not a coffee-table book to be shown to impressionable friends. It is a book to be enjoyed in a quiet hour when you can turn your imagination loose and let the sketches and notes come alive in your mind's eye.-Edward H. Burtt Jr. 66. Last of the curlews. F. Bodsworth. 1987. Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, New York 10003. 160 pp. $17.95 (hardcover), $8.95 (paperback).-As scientists we discuss the plight of vanishing species in professional journals, report our findings to government in environ- mental impact statements, or, occasionally, talk to reporters who occasionally write or talk about endangered species in newspapers or on the local news that whets our appetites for Tom Brokaw, Peter Jennings, or Dan Rather. We rarely use fiction to put the case of an endangered species before the public, yet that is exactly what Bodsworth has done in "Last of the curlews." Don't get the wrong idea. This is not a cute, anthropomorphic story. The central character is a male Eskimo Curlew endowed with believable characteristics by a narrator who remains omniscient and objective. The book opens on the Arctic tundra, in the territory of a male Eskimo Curlew who awaits the arrival of a mate and occasionally courts female Hudsonian Curlews, but never for long. For the fourth year no female arrives and the male eventually heads southeast to Labrador where it fattens before the long journey to South America. We follow him to the pampas, where he explores its estuaries, its grassland, and turns west to begin his spring migration. After crossing the Andes . .., but you will not enjoy the story if I continue my summation. Bodsworth's prose is superb. Biological details come alive before your mind's eye and you look at familiar phenomena with a new perspective. For example the over water migration of the curlew accompanied by a flock of Black-bellied Plovers: The flock slogged on, a few feet above the sea, struggling laboriously over each crest and snatching a few niggardly seconds of partial rest in the quieter, protected air of each trough. Once a long trough lifted into a seething comber many feet higher than those preceding and the spray of its crest lashed the curlew's wings. The curlew had to battle a maelstrom of air currents for several seconds to keep airborne. When the wave passed two more of the plovers failed to re-appear. But the spray melted much of the snow clinging to the curlew's wingtip feathers. For a minute his unburdened wings could bite into the air with all their old power. Scientific detail is presented concisely and accurately, but one hardly thinks of that as you picture the elemental struggle. Here is natural selection. Here is a perspective on migration and fitness that I knew existed, but had never had so graphically portrayed. Bodsworth has further heightened the tension of the book by interspersing his fictional account with published scientific reports of the curlew's biology and decline. These come at intervals, like news flashes, and, like news flashes, they contribute to a mounting sense of despair. The effect is stunning. The book, originally published in 1954, is republished by Dodd, Mead &amp; Company as part of its Edwin Way Teale Library of Nature Classics. The book is superbly illustrated by T. M. Shortt, whose illustrations graced the original edition, and Michael McCurdy, whose wood engravings were commissioned for this special edition. The publisher, author, and artists are to be congratulated on a work that seeks to awaken our sensibilities to the world around us and the desperate need for preservation of our vanishing wildlife.</page></plain_text>
