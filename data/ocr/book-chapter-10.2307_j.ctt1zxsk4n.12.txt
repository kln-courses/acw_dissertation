Lisa Zunshine refers to “a lacunae in  contemporary Nabokov criticism” in “Alexander  Pope’s The Rape of the Lock and Vladimir  Nabokov’s Pale Fire,” Nabokov at the Limits, ed.  Lisa Zunshine (New York: Garland Publishing,  1999), 179.  3 Gerard de Vries, “‘Fanning the Poet’s Fire,’ Some  Remarks on Nabokov’s Pale Fire,” Russian  Literature Triquarterly 24 (1991): 255-6. 102 </page> <page sequence="2"> E N G L I S H  N A B O K O V  has drawn the most attention, no doubt because Belinda, its heroine, stands out  in female beauty; the very quality that Hazel Shade fatally lacks. In this paper,  I will attempt to demonstrate that Hazel’s disposition and the social guidance  she receives explain her and Belinda’s different reactions to the affl ictions  caused by male acquaintances who were supposed to brighten their lives. I will  then show that the ideas that fostered Shade’s spirited breakthrough during his  musings on the mountain-fountain misprint have many parallels with those  expressed in Pope’s Essay on Man. First, the affi nities between Shade’s poem  and the poetics of Pope’s verses will be discussed. While Shade published a book on Pope and appears to talk about Pope  with a frequency that makes Kinbote decide that the Augustan poet is Shade’s  favorite topic of discussion,4 Pope has left only a few explicit traces in Shade’s  poem. There is an obvious allusion to The Rape of the Lock in lines 413-16,  insofar as the description of Belinda’s cosmetic sanctum is the most quoted  and anthologized passage from Pope’s oeuvre, as well as a quotation from  the Essay on Man in line 419. One might also conclude that the mention of  “Zembla” in line 937 is suggested by Pope’s writings, given the marginal note  that Shade added to the manuscript of this passage. Considering the fact that  Shade, as a scholar, is immersed in Pope and likes to talk about his favorite  poet for entertainment, the number of references to Pope in the poem seems  so scanty that one is inclined to suspect that there are less overt allusions in  the text that may have been missed upon fi rst glance. Prima facie, it is Kinbote rather than Shade who seems to be well-versed in  Pope. He easily recognizes the title of Shade’s book on Pope, Supremely Blest,  as a Popean phrase, and unfailingly identifi es two borrowings from the Essay  on Man.5 Even more surprising is the introduction of Paul Hentzner with  a quotation from Pope’s “Phryne,” as if he belonged to that poem’s “curious  Germans”; the subtle allusions to The Rape of the Lock, such as the phrase  “star ghost”; and in the fi nal line of the novel, the longingly “distant northern  land.”6 There are, however, some statements made by Kinbote that are rather  puzzling: he calls Shade’s poem a “narrative in the neo-Popian prosodic style”  and, in the beginning of his work, he declares that Pale Fire is “a poem in  heroic couplets.”7 The heroic couplet, popularized by Dryden and perfected by  4 Vladimir Nabokov, Pale Fire (New York: Vintage International, 1989), 250. 5 Ibid., 195; 203; 272. 6 Ibid., 185; 82; 315. The allusions concern canto IV, line 154 and the fi nal line of Pope’s The  Rape of the Lock, The Poems of Alexander Pope, ed. John Butt (New Haven: Yale University  Press, 1963). 7 Nabokov, Pale Fire, 296; 13. Gerard de Vries 103 </page> <page sequence="3"> C O R N E R  A R C  Pope, consists of a pair of rhymed lines in iambic pentameter. Pope’s couplets  are mainly “closed”; which means that two lines in Pope, paired by rhyme,  have a meaning or a felicity even when one disregards the lines that precede  or follow them. For example, the lines “True Ease in Writing comes from Art,  not Chance, / As those move easiest who have learn’d to dance,”8 from Pope’s  Essay on Criticism, not only jocularly illustrate the poet’s argument, but can  also be enjoyed separately from the rest of the poem for their epigrammatic  content. By contrast, most of the rhymed pairs of the lines of Pale Fire are  “open” and can only be savored in connection with the lines that precede or  follow them. The self-suffi ciency of closed couplets might detract the reader’s  attention from the entirety of the composition, but this seems unlikely.  A beautiful building does not suffer from being made of perfectly fabricated  bricks. In Dryden and Pope, the use of closed couplets means order, not  confi nement. Pope formulated many rules to reach the degree of perfection  to which he aspired9 as, for example, the consideration he gives in the Essay  on Criticism: “For Wit and Judgment often are at strife, / Tho’ meant each  other’s Aid, like Man and Wife.”10 Within its bounds, the heroic couplet gives room for endless modulations  like antithesis, chiasmus and inversion, as well as the use of the caesura  and hiatus, verse techniques intensively employed by Pope. M. H. Abrams,  Nabokov’s colleague and friend at Cornell, writes  [Pope’s] frequent use of a strong medial cesura, or pause, was a way of breaking  the lines into smaller units in order to maximize the internal relations among the  rhetorical and sonantal parts — relations of parallelism, repetition with variation,  contrast, or antithesis, and between couplet and couplet, line and line, half line and  half line.11  Two lines from The Dunciad may serve as an illustration: “We ply the Memory,  we load the brain, / Bind rebel Wit, and double chain on chain . . . ” With these  8 Alexander Pope, Essay on Criticism, The Poems of Alexander Pope, ed. John Butt (New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1963), lines 362-3. 9 See, for example, the letters from Pope reprinted in Alexander Pope. A Critical Anthology, ed.  F. W. Bateson and N. A. Joukovsky (Harmondsworth: Penguin Books, 1971), 39-42, and Pope,  Essay on Criticism, lines 70-99. 10 Pope, Essay on Criticism, lines 82-3. 11 M. H. Abrams, ed., “Introduction,” Alexander Pope, The Poetry of Pope. A Selection (New  York: Appleton-Century, 1954). A. D. Nuttall (Pope’s “Essay on Man” [London: Allen and  Unwin, 1984], 27-28) shows how Pope creates no less than seven opportunities for antithesis  within two lines (of ten syllables each). 104 </page> <page sequence="4"> E N G L I S H  N A B O K O V  lines Pope satirizes the dunces, the less gifted poets who earned a living by  writing doggerels, especially those congregated on Grub Street.12 He presents  four actions which he connects with three intellectual faculties. A clear  difference is made between the capacity of all individuals to use their memory  and their brain, on the one hand, and the rare quality of wit or originality on  the other. In the dunces’ eyes, wit threatens the dullness that secures their  lives, and therefore should be doubly bound. If we compare Pope’s lines with lines 159-160 of “Pale Fire,” an identical  subdivision into four half lines can be observed: “And then it ceased. Its  memory grew dim. / My health improved. I even learned to swim.” But Shade’s  lines cannot be fully understood without knowing what “it” represents in line  159. And only after realizing that “it” refers to “fi ts,” one notices that the second  half of line 160 is not a specifi ed reiteration of the fi rst half, as swimming is  notably dangerous for someone liable to fainting. Pope’s lines strike the reader  with vigorous verbs suggesting manual labor but applied to functions of the  mind, through their staccato-like pertinence. However, phrases like “whipped  by the bough, / Tripped by the stump” may remind the reader of the compact  style of Pope, who scarcely explicates the subjects of his sentences.13 However,  “Pale Fire” is, apart from its meter, not at all reminiscent of Pope’s compressed  closed couplets.14 Clearly, the main merit of “Pale Fire” is not its allegedly neo- Popean style, as it has an inner coherence of such intricacy that depths not  equaled in Pope’s argumentative poems resonate within it. Despite Pope’s great concern for the correctness of his verses, his  poetry has been accused of having some serious fl aws.15 George Saintsbury  12 Alexander Pope, The Dunciad, The Poems of Alexander Pope, ed. John Butt (New Haven: Yale  University Press, 1963), IV 157-8. Writing chiefl y to earn money as the dunces did may not  look very blameworthy, but in Pope’s circle it was regarded as symptomatic of a greater ill, the  degeneration and corruption of the cultural and political climate. 13 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 128-9. The same is true of the catalogue in lines 924-30. For  a discussion of catalogues in Pope see Dennis Davidson, Dryden (London: Evans Brothers,  1968), esp. Chapter 4: “Verse Technique: the Heroic Couplet.” 14 Cf. Jonathan Swift, “Verses on the Death of Dr. Swift,” Selected Poems of Jonathan Swift,  ed. James Reeves (London: Heinemann, 1967), 87 who commented that Pope “can in one  Couplet fi x / More Sense than I can do in Six.” See also Michael Wood, The Magician’s Doubts:  Nabokov and the Risks of Fiction (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1994), 187, who, quoting  the Essay on Man (II 222-226), favorably compares Pope with Nabokov: “[t]he brilliant,  multiplying jokes take the breath away; even Nabokov looks a very modest magician alongside  this performance.”  15 The correctness certainly does not apply to syntactical details. “I could never get the blockhead  to study his grammar,” said Swift, quoted in A. R. Weekes, ed., Johnson: Life of Pope (London:  W.B. Clive, 1917), 151. Gerard de Vries 105 </page> <page sequence="5"> C O R N E R  A R C  is a particularly severe critic who, although he admires Pope’s versifi cation,  denies him any originality, and complains about Pope’s ample use of the  gradus-epithet (adjectives that qualify in non-essential ways).16 Pope also  suffered heavy contempt from the Romantics (with the exception of Byron,  his staunchest supporter), who especially despised the mechanical monotony  they heard in his meter. When Nabokov wrote Pale Fire, the revival of Pope  which started in the second quarter of the previous century was still gaining  momentum. Though Nabokov’s novels abound in references and allusions to  English poetry, Pope was hardly ever among the poets referred to therein. In  Pnin, Nabokov calls the poetry of the eighteenth century (as a fi eld of literary  interest) “an overgrazed pasture, with a trickle of a brook and a clump of  initialed trees.”17 In his Commentary to Pushkin’s Eugene Onegin, Nabokov  mentions Pope more than twenty times, which strikes the reader as more  than necessary to discuss the English infl uences (fi ltered through French  translations, as was Nabokov’s conviction) on Pushkin. He praises Pope’s  description of Belinda’s boudoir in The Rape of the Lock, which follows  but transcends French models “thanks to English richness of imagery and  originality of diction,” as well as Pope’s “charming eclogue The Basset-table.”  18 The number of entries for Pope in the index of Nabokov’s edition of Eugene  Onegin exceeds those for all other English poets, including Browning, Marvell  and Milton, with the exception of Byron and Shakespeare. The process of sorting out Nabokov’s appreciation for Pope is not greatly  helped by Nabokov’s hostility towards the Age of Reason, as Pope was the  foremost English poet of this age. Among the “insipid products” this age  produced, according to Nabokov, were “fl at classical backdrop colonnades”  and “fl at mythological scenes with a pseudo classical slant.” In addition, this  age had a “pathological dislike . . . for the specifi c ‘unpoetical detail’ and [a]  passion for the generic term.” The inartistic and antipoetic verse composed by  English poets in the wake of Butler’s Hudibras could be savored only because  “its enjoyment presupposes that Reason is somehow, in the long run, superior  to Imagination, and that both are less important than a man’s religious or  political beliefs.”19  16 George Saintsbury, “Pope and the Later Couplet,” 1908.

But, as The Dunciad so obviously  shows, it cannot be denied that Pope’s main concerns were strongly  connected with his awareness of the cultural and moral decay and the  corruption that pervaded the politics of his day. Although he was preoccupied  to some degree with the Whig government, Pope composed works which are  primarily the product of his imagination and poetic profi ciency, especially  during the fi rst half of his career. The Pastorals, Windsor-Forest, Essay on  Criticism, The Rape of the Lock, Eloisa to Abelard, and many of his shorter  poems, are not written primarily to air or to aid any philosophical, moral or  political idea. It seems that one should be careful not to too hastily transfer to Pope the  objections Nabokov raised to the Age of Reason, especially as both authors  shared some literary ambitions. In his answer to the question of what literary  virtues he sought to attain and how, Nabokov said: “[m]ustering the best  words, with every available lexical, associative, and rhythmic assistance,  to express as closely as possible what one wants to express.”20 This can be  compared to Pope’s objective to pursue an utter correctness in the selection  of words, in terms of sound and thought, and to this end “weigh[ing] every  letter of his verse.”21 Coleridge, like his fellow Romantics, is highly censorious  of Pope’s poetry, but nonetheless praises his “almost faultless position and  choice of words.”22 Another interest Nabokov and Pope shared is the assimilation of felicitous  phrases, images or themes from other writers. Nabokov’s unique allusiveness  is well known. About Pope, Dr. Johnson said that “there is scarcely a happy  combination of words, or a phrase poetically elegant in the English language,  which Pope has not inserted . . . ”23 There is, however, a striking difference  in the way such borrowings were employed. Pope appropriated phrases  and ideas when they fi t his verses and, for this reason, selected only those  which he fully approved.24 Nabokov, on the other hand, at times rephrased  his borrowings or gave them an entirely new setting (which makes them so  diffi cult to recognize). This enabled him to make his selections not only from  fi rst-rate authors, but also from second-rate and even trivial ones.  20 Nabokov, Strong Opinions (New York: Vintage International, 1990), 181. 21 Geoffrey Tillotson, On the Poetry of Pope (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950), 130. 22 S.

Gerard de Vries 107 </page> <page sequence="7"> C O R N E R  A R C  Pope and Nabokov also shared a partiality for details. Hazlitt said that  reading Pope’s poetry “is like looking at the world through a microscope.”25  This can be read within the context of Pope’s observation of insects.26 In  Pale Fire, we watch Nabokov magnifying small things into grand and even  grotesque ones.27  PALE FIRE AND THE RAPE OF  THE LOCK The Rape of the Lock is probably Pope’s most admired poem; its  popularity has not diminished since its fi nal form was published in 1714. It  is a mock heroic poem that treats a slight offence, the clipping of some curls  from a girl’s head, as an epic confl ict which stirs not only mortal beings but  heavenly creatures as well. Pope took the notion of snipping the tress from  a real-life incident that befell a certain Miss Fermor — “Belinda” in the poem.  Miss Fermor was so handsome that she was celebrated as a fashionable  beauty, a circumstance which probably added greatly to the attraction of  the stolen lock.28 Pope’s famous poem on beauty is thus mirrored in John  Shade’s “favorite” canto II, about the fatal impact of a girl’s unattractiveness.  It seems not at all an easy task to refl ect the heartrending story of Hazel’s  short life in the frivolity of The Rape of the Lock. Johnson called Pope’s poem  “the most exquisite example of ludicrous poetry,” and Hazlitt said that “it is  made of nothing.” But Hazlitt also wrote that “[y]ou hardly know whether to  laugh or weep.”29 The actual incident that inspired the poem was of enough  brutishness to embitter the victim and her family for a long time. Miss Fermor  was exceedingly angry and her family felt severely offended.30 In the poem,  25 William Hazlitt, Lectures on the English Poets (London: OUP, 1952), 109. 26 Tillotson, On the Poetry of Pope, 96; Nuttall, Pope’s “Essay on Man,” 110; Clive T.

In Maynard Mack’s  biography, one can admire the locks of Teresa Blount and Miss Fermor in the reproductions  of their portraits (Alexander Pope, A Life [New Haven: Yale University Press, 1985], 246, 249),  and in Hogarth’s painting of Garrick and his wife (Royal Collection, Windsor) one can enjoy  108 </page> <page sequence="8"> E N G L I S H  N A B O K O V  Pope dwells at great length on the beauty of his heroine, and on all the efforts  that she and her maid dedicated to enhancing the glory of her looks. This  helps the reader to understand that the loss of the lock was nothing less than  a social disaster for Belinda. At the same time, it invites the reader to refl ect  on her vanity. Whether Belinda’s fury resulted from injured dignity or hurt  pride, it led to feelings of distrust and hostility towards her more eager suitors.  And this is not without risk, as “she who scorns a Man, must die a Maid.”31 To  scorn, or to be scorned — as happened so very callously in Hazel’s case — differs  widely, especially when it is caused by an excess (or a lack) of beauty. But both  cases may lead to the same end, the unmarried state. Remaining unmarried  was a problem because Pope’s age had “no employment and very little respect  for spinsters.”32 Apart from this practical advice, Pope offers some sagacious  considerations as well, as the poem is also “a lament for the transience of  youth and the vanity of human wishes.”33 Indeed, Clarissa’s lengthy speech in  canto V centers on the idea that beauty dies and virtue alone survives:   . . . frail Beauty must decay,   . . . since Locks will turn to grey  [ . . . ] Beauties in vain their pretty Eyes may roll;  Charms strike the Sight, but Merit wins the Soul.34  However, such deliberations are not found in the second canto of Shade’s  poem. It focuses, instead, on the ideal of female beauty:  A nymph came pirouetting, under white  Rotating petals, in a vernal rite  To kneel before an altar in the wood  Where various articles of toilet stood.35  As has often been observed, these lines refer to the famous passage in The  Rape of the Lock, lines 121-138 of canto I. Shade’s lines have the taste of  Mrs. Garrick’s carefully composed curlicue. See also lines 20-23 of The Rape’s second canto.  The disappearance of one of the twin curls destroys the beauty of the remaining one as well, as  Belinda says in canto IV, line 171. For this reason, it is highly unlikely that a double entendre (with  a scabrous undertone) could be discovered in canto IV, line 176, as has been suggested too often. 31 Pope, Rape, V 8. 32 Mack, Pope, A Life, 252. 33 Quennell, Pope, 77. 34 Pope, Rape, V 25-26, 33-34. 35 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 413-416.  Gerard de Vries 109 </page> <page sequence="9"> C O R N E R  A R C  mild ridicule, while Pope’s delightful lines are downright satirical. Hogarth,  Pope’s contemporary for half a century, parodied (like Pope) “the vices, the  follies and the frivolity of the fashionable manners of his time.”36 Hazlitt, who  persuasively links Hogarth’s paintings with The Rape of the Lock, compares  the bride in the fi rst picture of the highly moralizing Marriage à la Mode  paintings with the precise “look and air” that Pope gave his Belinda at the  moment when her lock was taken.37 Considered in this way, beauty seems  to have no merits at all. It does not last, it awakens vanity at the expense of  virtuous conduct, and it exposes the fair to harmful attention.38 If beauty is  such a hazardous attribute, can its absence be fatal as well? This question  should be addressed because it is doubtful that “Hazel’s death makes sense  because of her irredeemable lack of sex appeal.”39 Belinda’s and Hazel’s doomed days are marked by rays, a bright one for  Belinda and an ominous one for Hazel. Dreaming about a boy, Belinda is  awakened by the sun: “Sol thro’ white Curtains shot a tim’rous Ray.” A ray  fi nished Hazel’s dream about her date with Pete Dean who, fi lled with  indignation about his blind date, “shot a death ray at well-meaning Jane.”40  Hazel’s friend and Pete’s cousin, Jane, arranged the blind date –after goading  Hazel’s half-hearted consent — in an attempt to alleviate Hazel’s loneliness.  One wonders why Hazel tries her luck. She is far from beautiful, her fi gure is  plump, she has a slight squint, her feet are swollen, her fi ngernails psoriatic,  her smile (hardly ever to be seen) is a sign of pain, her disposition is diffi cult  and morose, and her imagination brings her strange fears and fantasies.  Despite all this, her parents keep hoping that she will be invited to a ball, or  taken to a dance. They even send her to a château in France, clearly to give  her another opportunity to meet boys, although her father concedes that “Out  of the lacquered night, a white-scarfed beau / Would never come for her; . . . ”  How different is life for beauties like Belinda around whose coach “ . . . crowd  the white-glov’d Beaus.” Unlike in Hazel’s case, these beaux are not at all  welcome, as they only serve to highlight how illusory such suitors are: “How  vain are all these Glories . . . ”41 36 William Hazlitt, The English Comic Writers (London: O University Press, 1920), 189. See also  Peter Quennell, Hogarth’s Progress (London: Collins, 1955), 169. 37 Hazlitt, Comic Writers, 177. 38 Such attentions may lead, as in Belinda’s case, to the loss of a lock, and in Lolita’s case to the  loss of her childhood. 39 Zunshine, Pope’s Rape and Nabokov’s Pale Fire, 172. 40 Pope, Rape, I 13; Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” line 407. 41 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 333-34; Pope, Rape, V 13, 15. 110 </page> <page sequence="10"> E N G L I S H  N A B O K O V  Despite all her misfortunes, Hazel has moments of contentment as well:  “ . . . You remember those / Almost unruffl ed evenings when we played / Mah- jongg . . . ”42 One would like to learn more about this pastime: apart from  studying, this is the only occasion that is mentioned which offers Hazel a kind  of enjoyment. How different is Pope’s poem, which presents 73 lines in canto  III to describe Belinda playing ombre. Another of Belinda’s many pleasures is the company of her lapdog, Shock.  Belinda is so fond of it that Shock is allowed to spend the nights in her room.  Shock was a shaggy Iceland terrier, the same breed as Aunt Maud’s Skye  terrier.43 Unfortunately, Sybil, Hazel’s mother, “had the animal destroyed  soon after its mistress’s hospitalization, incurring the wrath of Hazel who was  beside herself with distress.”44 The dog was partially paralyzed, which meant  that it would have been a nuisance for Sybil but, at the same time, the dog’s  poor condition might have been an extra reason for Hazel to look after it. How  curious that Hazel, with her many anxieties, was not permitted to keep the  dog. The comfort provided by pets in one’s life was noted by another Belinda,  the heroine in one of Barbara Pym’s novels: “Some tame gazelle, or some  gentle dove, or even a poodle dog — something to love, that was the point.”45  In the variant on lines 417-421, Shade calls Pope’s age “heartless” but Belinda,  who has been advised that other things might be much more important than  “beaux,” has enjoyed her game of cards so passionately, and has been so fond  of her poodle dog, seems in these respects to be better off than Hazel. As  Michael Wood says, “she was surely more a victim of the manners of her time  than anyone has to be or should be.”46 Doubtless Hazel had loving and caring parents, but the future they  desired for their daughter was rather illusory. We do not know the main  reason that Hazel committed suicide (the incident with Pete Dean might  only have actuated the event), but her parents’ wish that she might fi nd the  same marital happiness as they enjoyed, probably did little to alleviate her  predicament. As Wood has suggested, it was “[p]erhaps her other small hope  42 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 358-60. 43 Quennell, Hogarth, 79. The second painting of Hogarth’s Marriage à la Mode gives a fi ne  illustration of an example of this breed. 44 Nabokov, Pale Fire, 165. 45 Barbara Pym, Some Tame Gazelle (London: Pan Books, 1993), 251. The title of Barbara Pym’s  novel is very unlikely the source for Kinbote’s “tame gazelle” (Nabokov, Pale Fire, 133) as it was  only published once during Nabokov’s lifetime; no more likely is the poem by Thomas Haynes  Bayly (1797-1839) “Something to Love” from which Pym borrowed her title. 46 Wood, The Magician’s Doubts, 195.

In his Elegy to the Memory of an  Unfortunate Lady, wherein the protagonist (like Hazel), committed suicide,  Pope, after noticing her “beck’ning ghost” (like Shade heeding the swaying  of the phantom of his little daughter’s swing in line 57), envisions her as an  airy being: “Fate snatch’d her early to the pitying sky / As into air the purer  spirits fl ow.”49 The sylphs in The Rape of the Lock are likewise reborn after such  a transfi guration:  For when the Fair in all their Pride expire, To their first Elements their Souls retire [ . . . ] Thence, by a soft Transition, we repair From earthly Vehicles to those of Air 50 The sylphs interfere with the lives of those on earth, as they “ . . . thro’  mystick Mazes guide their Way.” Pope’s sylphs resemble butterfl ies, as they  have “Insect-Wings” which, when the sylphs waft through the air, show  a magnifi cent variety of colors due to the perpetual mutation of refl ected  light: “Where Light disports on ever-mingling Dies, / While ev’ry Beam new  transient Colours fl ings, / Colours that change whene’er they wave their  Wings.” The sylphs look like “Zephyrs,” and these are seen again in the  description of butterfl ies in The Dunciad. “Of all th’enamel’d race, whose  silv’ry wing / Waves to the tepid Zephyrs of the spring.”51 In a note to line 421, Pope writes that he “seems to have an eye to  Spenser, Muiopotmos” as it is from Spenser that Pope borrowed the image  47 Ibid. 48 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 993-95.

This  cannot have escaped Nabokov’s attention, as he had widely read the English  poets (both major and minor) and, moreover, had a special interest in  “lepidopterological images in English poetry.”54 PALE FIRE AND THE ESSAY ON MAN In this section I will compare Shade’s poem with Pope’s Essay in terms of  philosophical principles and ethical outlook. The Essay on Man has received  a mixed response. Important critics like Samuel Johnson and Leslie Stephen  did not appreciate The Rape of the Lock.55 Nonetheless, the poem was  translated into seventeen European languages and appeared in no fewer than  ninety separate editions, and Kant found Pope’s ideas superior to Leibnitz’s.56 52 See Pat Rogers, “Faery Lore and The Rape of the Lock,” The Review of English Studies, New  Series 25.97 (1974): 29, note 2. 53 Edmund Spenser, “Muiopotmos: or the Fate of the Butterfl ie,” line 142 (The Poetical Works of  Edmund Spenser [London: O University Press, 1932]). 54 Nabokov, Speak, Memory (New York: Vintage International, 1989), 129. Hazel’s transition into  a butterfl y is so crucial that possible precursors are of interest as well. According to Pope (The  Poems of Alexander Pope, ed. John Butt, page 217), sylphs have a Rosicrucian origin. This is  not the case, as shown by Bonnie Latimer, “Alchemies of Satire: A History of the Sylphs in The  Rape of the Lock,” The Review of English Studies 57.232 (2006): 684-700. Belinda’s guardian  sylph is called Ariel, doubtless after Shakespeare’s airy spirit from The Tempest. Pope’s sylphs  belong to a quartet of groups of spirits, each of them corresponding to “their fi rst elements”;  sylphs to air, salamanders to fi re, nymphs to water and gnomes to earth (Rape, I 59-66). Pope  could have found several instances of these elementary spirits in Milton, which Milton might  have concocted from alchemical, Jewish and ancient Roman and Greek sources (see John  Carey and Alastair Fowler, ed., The Poems of John Milton [London: Longmans, 1968], 175;  and Merry Y. Hughes, ed., Paradise Regained, The Minor Poems and Samson Agonistes [New  York: The Odyssey Press, 1937], 427). 55 Johnson (Lives, 226) writes that Pope “was in haste to teach what he had not learned.”  Johnson, who could not deny the many poetic felicities of the Essay on Man, abhorred its  lack of religious orthodoxy. According to Leslie Stephen, Pope’s “reasonings in the Essay are  confused, contradictory and often childish” (Alexander Pope [New York: Harper, 1880], 162). 56 Maynard Mack, ed., Alexander Pope, An Essay on Man (London: Methuen and Co., 1950),  xli and xlii. Gerard de Vries 113 </page> <page sequence="13"> C O R N E R  A R C  Although Pope says that his purpose was to “vindicate the ways of God  to Man,” the deistical tendencies seem to predominate, since he more often  justifi es “nature” than God.57 Just as Shade’s third canto can be seen as an  explanation of the quest to which he devoted his “twisted life,” Pope’s Epistle  to Dr. Arbuthnot can be regarded as an apology of his career as a poet.58 One of the fi nal lines of Shade’s third canto is most reminiscent of the  fi rst line of Pope’s Epistle. “Darling, shut the door,” Sybil says to her husband,  John, as he strides in having returned from his visit to Mrs. Z., a journey  that was crowned with his discovery of “the contrapuntal theme.”59 Pope’s  initial line, “Shut, shut the door, good John! . . . ” is also associated with the  poet’s success, though in a more literal way. As a celebrity, Pope was often  besieged by intruders seeking compliments, recommendations, suggestions  or advice, who were to be kept out by John Searle, Pope’s servant in his  villa in Twickenham. By quoting Sybil’s request, Shade might have privately  celebrated his intellectual success as well.  Some of Nabokov’s protagonists reappear in his later works. Pnin returns  in Pale Fire and John Shade is represented in Ada as “a modern poet” while  “the French thinker Delalande,” copiously quoted in The Gift is, after twenty- two years, resuscitated in the Foreword to Invitation to a Beheading, which  Nabokov wrote in 1959, one and a half years before he started to write Pale  Fire.60 Inspired by Delalande’s thoughts, the author of The Gift states: “In our  earthly house, windows are replaced by mirrors; the door, until a given time,  57 Pope, Essay on Man, I 16. In the Essay, “God” is mentioned 56 times and “nature” is  mentioned 65 times (A Concordance to the Poems of Alexander Pope, 2 vols., ed. Emmett  G. Bedford and Robert J. Dilligan [Detroit: Gale Research Co, 1974], 6; 7; 523-24, 527).  Cf. Nuttall’s observation that “God is not a visible agent in Pope’s story. The work on the  spot is done by Nature” (Pope’s “Essay on Man,” 201). Without equating nature and God  as Nabokov did, they are most closely related: “All are but parts of one stupendous whole, /  Whose body, Nature is, and God the soul” (Pope, Essay on Man, I 267-8). In his Moral Essay,  I, To Richard Temple, Viscount Cobham, Pope writes: “Know, God and Nature only are the  same” (154), though Thomas de Quincey argued that their sameness concerns their stability,  as opposed to man’s instability that is described in Pope’s line 155 (Bateson and Joukovsky,  Anthology, 223).  58 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” line 180.

Speaking of his great exemplar, the Greek philosopher Epicurus, Lucretius  says that “he . . . longed to smash the constraining locks of nature’s doors.  The vital vigour of his mind prevailed. He ventured far out beyond the  fl aming ramparts of the world and voyaged in mind throughout infi nity.”62  Nabokov may have recollected this passage in his autobiography, Speak,  Memory, when he mentioned his “bruised fi sts” caused by assailing the  “walls of time” which kept him imprisoned. The same combative stance was  displayed by Shade when he “ . . . decided to explore and fi ght / The foul, the  inadmissible abyss.”63 The same passage from Lucretius is echoed in Pope’s  Essay on Man, albeit with the emphasis on the upshot rather than on the  pugilistic efforts: “He, who thro’ vast immensity can pierce, / See worlds on  worlds compose one universe.”64  In Essay on Man, Pope presents his concept of a harmonious and  benefi cent universe from the start, having been inspired by classical and  contemporary authors who professed similar ideas. But Shade conceives  his vision of the universe only after a long life of investigations, all fruitless,  such as the instructions of the Institute of Preparation for the Hereafter (how  to act as a ghost; how to deal with reincarnations; how to handle earthly  relationships in Heaven), the lessons of cremationists and astronomers,  the futile intimations from occultists and Freudians. And when he loses his  daughter, his faith in a hereafter vanishes as well. But his hope is rekindled  by a near-death experience, almost identical to that of Mrs. Z, and it is after  visiting her that he fi nally envisages the way his life and afterlife are designed.  What he sees is not a concatenation of “coincidence” and “nonsense,” “but  61 Nabokov, The Gift, 310. Pierre Delalande might be related to Joseph Jérôme le Français de  Lalande (1732-1807), whom Nabokov mentions in his Commentary to Eugene Onegin (III  129). De Lalande was a French astronomer who believed in extraterrestrial life: “Imagination  pierces beyond the telescope: it sees a new multitude of worlds infi nitely larger” (http://www. astrobio.net/amee/spring_20003/retrospection_0.3htm). 62 Vladimir Nabokov, Look at the Harlequins!

Some translators have “gates” in stead of “doors” for Lucretius’s “portarum.”  For a discussion of the infl uence of Lucretius’s poem on Pope’s Essay on Man see Miriam  Lerenbaum, Alexander Pope’s “Opus Magnum” 1729-1744 (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1977). 63 Nabokov, Speak, Memory, 20; “Pale Fire,” lines 178-79. 64 Pope, Essay on Man, I 23-24.

Gerard de Vries 115 </page> <page sequence="15"> C O R N E R  A R C  a web of sense.” This is similar to Pope’s comparison of the “scene of Man”  with “A mighty maze! But not without a plan.”65 Kinbote’s comments on Shade’s “web of sense” refer to a “maze” very  similar to the one Pope uses to indicate the outward, inextricable appearance  of man’s life. Kinbote presents the reader with a passage from the Letters  of Franklin Lane that “curiously echoes Shade’s tone at the end of Canto  Three.” In this passage, Lane thinks about Aristotle and how he will take  “the long ribbon of man’s life to trace it through the mystifying maze of all  the wonderful adventure . . . The crooked made straight.” One can only  admire the felicitousness of this passage, linking Shade’s web with Pope’s  maze, a connection repeated by Lane’s “ribbon,” which perfectly fi ts Shade’s  textural images. Shade’s “web of sense” results from the “pattern” in ‘the  game of worlds” played by extraterrestrial beings whose existence Shade has  detected, although “ . . . No sound, / No furtive light came from their involute  / Abode, . . . ” Shade seems to belong to those uniquely gifted people “ . . . who  thro’ vast immensity can pierce,”66 and thus can See worlds on worlds compose one universe, Observe how system into system runs, What other planets circle other suns, What vary’d being peoples ev’ry star.67  Pope’s system is absorbed by another, which in its turn will be absorbed  as well (like the planet earth which belongs to the solar system, which itself  is part of a galaxy, etc.). This is refl ected in Shade’s vision of an intricate  “system” of multiple sets of interlinked cells “[w]ithin one stem.”68 Shade’s discernment of a “correlated pattern in the game” might be  connected to the purpose of the players of the game “ . . . Coordinating these  / Events and objects with remote events / And vanished objects. Making  ornaments / Of accidents and possibilities” might explain the “combinational delight” that Pope experiences in  pervading “ . . . the bearings, and the ties, / The strong connections, nice  dependencies, / Gradations just, . . . ” Of course the players of this “game of  worlds” have to observe the rules that constitute this play, which explains  how diffi cult it is to understand one of their moves or maneuvers in isolation:  65 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 809-10; Pope, Essay on Man, I 5, 6. 66 Nabokov, Pale Fire, 261; “Pale Fire,” lines 816-19; Pope, Essay on Man, I 23. 67 Pope, Essay on Man, I 24-27. 68 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 704-706. 116 </page> <page sequence="16"> E N G L I S H  N A B O K O V  “Remember, Man, ‘the Universal Cause / Acts not by partial, but by gen’ral  laws.” And it is by applying such rules or laws that “plexed artistry” emerges,  “ornaments / Of accidents and possibilities” or that “ . . . the whole worlds  of Reason, Life, and Sense” turns out “In one close system of Benevolence.”  Although Shade presents his vision with fi rmness, he summarizes his newly  won insight rather cautiously for Sybil: “I have returned convinced that I  can grope / My way to some — to some — ‘Yes dear?’ Faint hope.”69 Hope is  also Pope’s resort, to which he turns in every missive of his Essay70 as, for  example, in the fourth epistle: For [Man] alone, Hope leads from goal to goal, And opens still, and opens on his soul, [ . . . ] Hope of known bliss, and Faith in bliss unknown.71 Despite the number of parallel passages, there are differences between the  two poets. First of all, the door that stands ajar in Nabokov’s imagery will not  be used to look into the hinterland, but to profi t from the air which “comes in  through the cracks.” In Lucretius’s and Pope’s poetry, the aspiration is to look  into the universe. Although the pyrrhonist, adverse to any claim of knowledge about the  nature of things, will argue that this difference is chimerical, it is of great  importance for those who are not intolerant of the possibility of supernatural  phenomena. For Lucretius, the “door” opening to the universe is primarily  a symbolic one because his great poem, covering an astonishing range of  issues, is a testimony of his conviction that all visible and invisible things  can be explained by nature and by nature alone. Pope justifi es life on this  planet by explaining the laws of nature (or nature’s autonomy) and postulates  that, because all we can understand is right, everything inexplicable must,  analogously, be right as well. Shade, however, is primarily interested in the  question of how to perceive and decipher the dim and dusky intimations which  come from the beyond. To discern those tidings one has to rely on imagination  rather than on ratiocination. The narrow openings are of importance to  secure these messages. Of course, acknowledging the possibility of such  messages entails the question about their senders. In Nabokov’s novels, it is  69 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 813, 826-29, 973; Pope, Essay on Man, I 29-31; IV 35-36; Nabokov,  “Pale Fire,” lines 815, 828-29; Pope, Essay on Man, IV 357, 358; Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines  833-34. 70 Cf.

Gerard de Vries 117 </page> <page sequence="17"> C O R N E R  A R C  often close relatives or loved ones who try to admonish or assist those still  alive. Although on three occasions Shade pairs the appearance or the image  of a butterfl y with his daughter or wife, he fails to make this association when  a butterfl y presents itself for the fourth time.72 Likewise, those who play the  game of worlds remain unidentifi ed. In the Essay on Man, there are no such  celestial beings who govern earthly life. There is no need for them to interfere,  as providence has preordained the universe and its operation.73  Another difference of emphasis is related to ethical concerns. It can be  said that the main argument of both poets, Shade and Pope, as far as their  metaphysical pursuits are concerned, is expressed in these lines in the Essay  on Man: All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee; All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see; All Discord, Harmony, not understood.74 Pope is quite clear what this “Harmony” meant to him: “All partial Evil,  universal Good.”75 Less clear is what “harmony” (resulting from the “web of  sense,” the “correlated pattern,” or the “coordinating”) means to Shade. Does  harmony refer to “plexed artistry,” the perfection of the “game of worlds,” or  the delights that “making ornaments” afford? Shade proceeds by enumerating  several incidents yielded by this game.76 Among the examples he presents is  the “extinguishing [of] a short” life. One wonders how Shade, having lost his  only child less than two years earlier, could have experienced “pleasure” in  contemplating a game involving an identical loss. And one’s confusion only  increases after reading Shade’s comment on a line from Essay on Man, — “Has  unmistakably the vulgar ring / Of its preposterous age . . . ” — knowing, as we  do, that in a variant this age was even called “heartless.” Here Shade gives  Pope two inconsiderate digs: fi rst that he was a callous poet and second that  he merely copied contemporary thoughts.77  72 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 55-58, 269-271, 316-19, 993-97. See Boyd, Nabokov’s Pale Fire. 73 Although Lucretius’s gods, like Shade’s godlike beings, have lots of fun (as “ . . . laughs with  radiance lavishly diffuse [.] . . . ” [96]), they are completely powerless (cf. Lucretius, Universe,  173-77). 74 Pope, Essay on Man, I 289-91. 75 Ibid., 292. This line is so crucial that it is repeated in epistle IV, line 114. 76 As “promoting pawns” (Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” line 819) belong to this game, Shade alludes to  something similar to chess. From the examples given by Shade, it seems as if the only moves  that are allowed are gambits. 77 Ibid., 821-22, 815, 420-421; Pale Fire, Commentary 417-21. In his Commentary to Eugene  Onegin, Nabokov mentions Pope’s “thematic imitativeness” and his “Leibnitzian ‘all is right’”  118 </page> <page sequence="18"> E N G L I S H  N A B O K O V  Why did Shade censure Pope’s moral stance without offering some sort of  clarifi cation about the pleasure he found in discovering the deadly “game of  worlds”?78 Brian Boyd suggests that “Shade . . . feels the tender interest of the  forces of imagination in his life, a sense of pattern even behind the anguish of  his own loss” and that even an “allotment of pain, wantonly cruel in human  terms, might be a necessary part of the pattern of tenderness.”79 This closely  parallels Pope’s argument: “’Tis but a part we see, and not a whole” and  “ . . . partial Ill is universal Good.”80 Moreover, Pope explicitly discusses the incidents that Shade describes as  parts of the “game of worlds.” For example, “Kindling a long life” might be  compared with Pope’s lines: “Or why so long (in life it long can be) / Lent  Heav’n a parent to the poor and me?”; and “extinguishing / A short one” with  “Tell me, if Virtue made the Son expire, / Why, full of days and honour, lives  the Sire?” Similarly, the “chunk of ice” that plummets from the sky and kills  a farmer, is countered by Pope’s “Shall gravitation cease, if you go by?” Both  poets are convinced that whatever remains inexplicable in earthy life will be  solved in the hereafter: “Life is a great surprise. I do not see why death should  not be an even greater one,” says Shade, while Pope recommends to “Wait the  great teacher Death.”81  Curiously, the two quotations Shade draws from Pope have no relation to  the parallel passages discussed above. They come from a section in the second  epistle: Whate’er the Passion, knowledge, farmer or pelf,  Not one will change his neighbor with himself The learn’d is happy nature to explore, The fool is happy that he knows no more; (III 30). However, Lerenbaum argues that Lucretius and Horace are Pope’s major infl uences,  and it is doubtful that Pope ever read a line of Leibniz (Stephen, Pope, 163; Nuttall, Pope’s  “Essay on Man,” 51). Moreover, Kant “was excited by the differences between Pope and  Leibniz” (Nuttall, Pope’s “Essay on Man,” 191). 78 A comparable image is found in Shakespeare’s King Lear: “As fl ies to wanton boys, are we to  th’ gods, / They kill us for their sport” (The Complete Works of William Shakespeare [Oxford:  Oxford University Press, 1955], 4, 1, 36-37), but Gloucester certainly derived no consolation  from this thought.  79 Brian Boyd, Nabokov’s Ada: The Place of Consciousness (Christchurch N.Z.: Cybereditions,  2001), 103-104.

Line 267 is  disapprovingly quoted by Shade. One may argue that Pope overstepped  sensible boundaries by supposing gaiety among the disabled,83 without  offering any explication as he does with respect to the learned, the fool, the  rich and the poor. But Shade might have remembered that Pope was a cripple  himself,84 and that Pope’s appearance, like Hazel’s, precluded intimate  relationships that he longed for. Line 271 might raise the question of what  “strange comfort” Hazel had to compensate for her “strange fears, strange  fantasies, strange force.” And the fi rst hemistich of line 270 was borrowed by  Shade for his book on Pope, a rather lofty title for a work “concerned mainly  with Pope’s technique.”85 In the Essay, it is the “starving chemist” who is  supremely blest, a qualifi cation extended to “the poet in his muse.” Pope’s  “chemist” is the alchemist who seeks the transformation of base metals into  precious ones, but whose ultimate aspiration is “the transformation of the  soul.”86 The poet’s muse is, of course, the source of inspiration; which must  have been revered by Nabokov as it was a favorite image of Pushkin87 and,  in his Commentary to Eugene Onegin, Nabokov describes the journey of  “Pushkin’s Muse,” following her through all its chapters. In Nabokov’s view,  the poet’s muse is much more closely linked with Pushkin’s creative genius  than with Pope’s “exceptional talent for placing the best words possible in the  best possible order.” The phrase “Supremely blest,” with its winged meanings,  82 Pope, Essay on Man, II 261-74. 83 Cf.

Subtexts associated with such  literary allusions can serve various aims. Kiril Taranovsky, as quoted by  Pekka Tammi, distinguishes three different functions for subtexts: they  can help to create an image, to reveal a message, or to stage a polemic  treatment.89 These categories, however, seem too specifi c to apply to  Nabokov’s copious allusions to Pope. As Priscilla Meyer has shown, many of  the references in Pale Fire contribute to its “cultural synthesis” of different  literary and historical developments in the northern hemisphere.90 Within  this overarching concept, the Popean subtexts seem to have a particular role.  Shade is meandering around Pope’s examples, at times corresponding with  them, at times markedly deviating from them. Shade employs the same meter used by Pope, but not Pope’s more  characteristic heroic couplets. The focus on female beauty in Shade’s canto  II is as pronounced as that in The Rape of the Lock, but appreciation of it is  highly dissimilar. Furthermore, some of Shade’s philosophical views strongly  resemble those expressed by Pope in the Essay on Man: the Lucretian interest  in the universe; the presumption of coordination between unrelated events;  and the selection of incidents which seem beyond vindication. These views are  exquisitely epitomized in Pope’s epigraph: All Nature is but Art, unknown to thee; All Chance, Direction, which thou canst not see.91 88 Nabokov, Commentary to Eugene Onegin, III 303, 30; “Pale Fire,” line 133. 89 Pekka Tammi, Russian Subtexts in Nabokov’s Fiction, Four Essays (Tampere: Tampere  University Press, 1999), 9. 90 Priscilla Meyer, Find What the Sailor Has Hidden.

Gerard de Vries 121 </page> <page sequence="21"> C O R N E R  A R C  Michael Wood states that “Nabokov is plainly much attracted to this theory”  as well.92 However, the word “nature” means something different for Shade  than for Pope. Pope’s domain is primarily the visible world that operates by  hidden forces which he would like to bare. Shade, on the other hand, is mainly  interested in the invisible part of the universe, where the dead abide. Pope’s  aim is to illustrate by clever and ingenious arguments that nature makes sense,  even when it looks like chaos. In Shade’s view, earthly life can only make  sense as a part of eternal life. And evidence for such a life can be derived from  the dead, whose existence can be seen by those who are imaginative enough  for this task. Shade mentions the possibility that the dead might return as  animals by means of reincarnation, or as electric light, but expects that he  may learn more of their windblown messages — the creaking of shutters, the  rolling of marbles on the roof, the throwing of twigs at windowpanes — or their  “‘psychokinetic’ manifestations” and roundlets of pale light which respond  to recited alphabets.93 However, as creation can be better understood by  those who are creative themselves, Shade’s artistic gifts appear to be a more  successful medium through which he can probe the universe and fi nd answers  to its riddles.94 Accordingly, it is not Pope’s power of argumentation but rather  his imagination that helps Shade to retrieve the “robust truth” promised by the  “twin display” of the white fountain after it was destroyed by a misprint. And it  is because of the patterns Shade discovers by means of artistic imagination that  he can derive confi dence about eternal life and fi nd some pleasure in Hazel’s  preferring this life above her rather miserable earthly one. Inspired by Newton’s great example, many philosophers in the eighteenth  century attempted to fi nd similar comprehensive rules which might explain  the way that nature controls earthly life.95 Such deistic explanations rested  heavily on the idea of a design, just as the orbiting of planets could be clarifi ed  by Newton’s laws of gravitation. Next to astronomers and philosophers,  artists may have similar aspirations, as they can create worlds based on plans  only known to them. This idea is beautifully described by Pope in his Essay on  Criticism: 92 Wood, The Magician’s Doubts, 170. 93 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 561-66, 653-54, 418, 479-480; Pale Fire, 165; 188. 94 Nabokov, “Pale Fire,” lines 766, 746. See de Vries, “‘Mountain, not fountain,’ Pale Fire’s Saving  Grace,” The Nabokovian (Fall 2009) in which the pivotal role of the reference to Pope’s Temple  of Fame is discussed. 95 Cf. David Daiches, “Eighteenth-Century Philosophical, Historical, and Critical Prose, and  Miscellaneous Writing,” A Critical History of English Literature (London: Secker &amp; Warburg,  1960), vol. 2, chapter 5. 122 </page> <page sequence="22"> E N G L I S H  N A B O K O V  So when the faithful Pencil has design’d Some bright Idea of the Master’s Mind Where a new World leaps out of his command, And ready Nature waits upon his Hand.96 This analogy, according to John Lyons, “leads Nabokov to his favourite  narrative method.”97 Indeed, Nabokov often refers to the demiurgic  qualities of an author. In Bend Sinister, for instance, he impersonates  an “anthropomorphic deity” who responds to his own protagonist. In  Speak, Memory, he attributes to “[t]he author” “the zest of a deity building  a new world.”98 The parallel between writing and creating the world — the  “heterocosmic analogue,” as M. H. Abrams calls it — gained momentum in  the eighteenth century, and would “sever supernatural poetry entirely from  the principle of imitation.”99 This is the kind of poetry that Nabokov was  interested in: “by poetry I mean the mysteries of the irrational as perceived  through rational words.”100 It looks as if Nabokov’s Pale Fire gives his readers a metaphor of the  world as he sees it: a plethora of magic and tragic incidents, bewildering at  fi rst sight, but with coincidences that may hold much more coherence than  one is able to detect, even after much investigation. These complexities have  been described by many authors, as Pope demonstrates, but it seems that the  harmony detected by Shade is unprecedented. 96 Pope, Essay on Criticism, 484-87. 97 John O. Lyons, “Pale Fire and the Fine Art of Annotation,” Nabokov, The Man and His Work,  ed. L. S. Dembo (Madison: The University of Wisconsin Press, 1967), 157. 98 Nabokov, Bend Sinister (New York: Vintage International, 1990), xviii; Speak, Memory, 291.  In Strong Opinions, Nabokov ranks “the Almighty” among the “rivals” of a “creative writer”  (32). See also Lectures on Russian Literature (London: Picador, 1983), 106. It is not only the  world that is recreated by an artist, as Nabokov reaches out to the universe as well. The “real  writer,” he says in Lectures on Literature, “sends planets spinning” (New York: Harcourt Brace  Jovanovich, 1980), 2; see also 379. 99 M. H. Abrams, “The Poem as Heterocosm,” The Mirror and the Lamp (Oxford: Oxford  University Press, 1971), 272. 100 Vladimir Nabokov, Nicolai Gogol (New York: New Directions, 1961), 55.
