<plain_text> <page sequence="1">                       Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany  Hall in America’s Gilded Age Samuel J. Thomas The rich range of colorful personalities, controversial issues, and emotionally stirring events that characterized American life dur- ing the late nineteenth century made it a political cartoonist’s para- dise.1 Among the most talented cartoonists were those who drew for the weekly Puck (1877–1918), the nation’s premier journal of political satire and humor.2 Published on Manhattan’s Lower East Side near both Tammany and city halls, it was the most influential organ of its kind in the Gilded Age and a unique means of distilling the nuances of mugwump reformism to a broad audience, especially to the grow- ing middle class.3 The magazine’s talented artistic staff spared no one it deemed in contravention to its moralistic, elitist definition of the public good. Working from the premise that human foible and folly were ubiquitous, Puck harbored no sacred cows. No matter what or whom it targeted, its intent was always bound to the aphorism that graced the cover of every issue. “What fools these mortals be,” a line from A Midsummer Night’s Dream, was the magazine’s official motto. Puck’s secular and rationalistic orientation made organized religion an irresistible political target, and none felt its wrath more than the Roman Catholic church. This was largely due to the maga- zine’s cofounder and head cartoonist, Joseph Keppler. A Viennese im- migrant, his political liberalism derived from his father’s revolution- ary activity in the 1840s, his own life in postrevolutionary Vienna, and his intellectual give-and-take with ex-patriots from Bismarck’s Ger- man Empire. He was also a disillusioned, nonpracticing Catholic who, like many other immigrants from Catholic Europe, was vehemently anticlerical. Both his political and religious biases greatly influenced his conclusion that the Catholic church was a serious threat to the nation’s constitutional foundations.4 It was the pope, he contended, who most personified that threat because he, not the nation, commanded the first loyalty of Religion and American Culture: A Journal of Interpretation, Volume 14, No. 2, pages 213–250. © 2004 by The Center for the Study of Religion and American Culture.

To Keppler, the papacy was the epitome of an insidious clericalism writ large over a nation whose citizenry revered individual freedom and representative democracy. His cartoons, and those of his staff artists, depicted the papacy as a sham and portrayed its current occupant, Leo XIII, as a spiritual fraud. The pope, in fact, bore the brunt of the magazine’s most vitriolic attacks on the Catholic church.5 Keppler entangled his magazine’s assaults on the church with his commitment to rid urban politics of the spoils system and the patronage that sustained it. To that end, many of Puck’s cartoons on the church contained expressed and implied similarities to a corrupt political machine, with the pope tantamount to a boss. The result was a popular assessment that played well in Manhattan, where church and political machine loomed conspicuously and where a loyal Irish- Catholic presence in each organization was an irresistible invitation to interlace and disparage both. Puck promoted guilt by association. Its cartoons of the papacy in particular had a deliberate, if mostly implicit, metaphorical dimension: they were two-edged swords calibrated to cut advantageously on both sides of the blade with every thrust. On one side, there was the church and the papacy, on the other, Tammany Hall and its bosses. On the receiving end were approximately eighty to one hundred thousand subscribers plus untold numbers of other readers that perused Puck cartoons in the city’s barrooms, barber- shops, and lodges.6 To reinforce the image of the church as un-American, the mag- azine’s cartoonists hammered at many of the same negative attributes that their mainly Protestant middle-class readership associated with Tammany Hall: secrecy, self-policing, power-lust, and hypocrisy. The Catholic church was much more than a bugbear to Puck. It was a seri- ous sign of contradiction and, like Tammany, a scandal and disgrace to a democratic republic. From founder Joseph Keppler’s perspective, the most effective way to deal with both was by confronting and ex- posing their leaders. No citizen who paid first homage to either the pope or the boss could be a good American. His magazine’s mugwump crusade to “throw out the crooks,” then, had a dual application. In an age of extreme partisan politics, Puck moralistically and boldly proclaimed a nonpartisan crusade for good government and the defense of American constitutional ideals against machine politi- cians and what it perceived as the political meddling of Catholic prel- ates, particularly the pope. Tammany Hall, committed to perpetuat- ing spoils and patronage as the means of dominating the body politic despite gathering support for civil service reform, was all the more dangerous to Puck because Irish Catholics dominated and supported </page> <page sequence="3">                             Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 215 it after the demise of Boss William Meagher Tweed in 1878. Tam- many’s Irish-Catholic base enabled the magazine to rationalize more completely its conviction that the Catholic church, ruled by a foreign boss dressed in the irrational garb of infallibility, was a menace to the nation’s body and soul. If allowed to proceed unimpeded, the pope and his minions would turn the United States into a political and spir- itual fiefdom. Puck was not about to let that happen.7 In its crusade against both enemies, Puck was an unparalleled media force. In an age of proliferating newspapers and magazines vying for readers, in an era of early muckraking and nascent photo- journalism, no other news medium or organ of reform opinion, par- tisan or not, interlaced the hall and the church so cleverly, so em- phatically, so consistently, and with such direct visceral appeal. In its editorials and in scores of cartoons over more than two decades, it blasted each “machine” separately and made invidious comparisons. Rarely were readers left wondering if Tammany and the church were somehow complicit, part of the same nefarious plot to strangle de- mocracy and convert the citizenry, if not forcibly, then by fear, fiat, stealth, and ballot.8 To date, scholars have noted how politicians as well as the popular and more elite press, in an era of widespread anti-Catholic press coverage, either alluded to or laid the groundwork for maga- zines such as Puck to connect Tammany and the church.9 However, Puck’s comprehensive strategy to link the two has never been scruti- nized. Its powerful cartoons, like those of Thomas Nast before it, ad- vanced “at both the surface and deeper mythic levels . . . pervasive prejudices and majority values.” Puck was more than an influential weekly. In an age when political cartooning was “the most effective criticism available,” it was “sui generis,” truly one of a kind, and “a real factor in [the] politics and social life” of the Gilded Age.10 In dozens of cartoons between 1878, when Pope Leo XIII suc- ceeded the irascible Pius IX, and 1899, when he issued his controver- sial letter on “Americanism” proscribing efforts to acculturate church doctrine and discipline to American democratic ideals, Puck featured the pontiff pursuing various nefarious ends. Sometimes he was a lone figure in crime, at other times a foxy boss politician supervising, disci- plining, or meddling in the affairs of his Catholic minions. One of Puck’s most inclusive cartoons appeared during its second year in op- eration and a few months after Leo had assumed office. The cartoon is an incisive facial parody of the new pope in which lead artist Joseph Keppler delineates in detail the fundamental bases of his intense ani- mosity (see Fig. 1). In Leo’s countenance, the artist has cleverly embedded both </page> <page sequence="4">       216 Religion and American Culture Figure 1. “Pope Leo XIII—A Physiognomical Study” (April 24, 1878) the theological and political trappings of papal power, and everything that he disdained about both. Over Leo’s head hovers the bat of “cler- icalism” (instead of the dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit), which, in contemporary usage, referred to the alleged intent by the clergy to unite church and state under the papacy, thereby affording the latter a privileged status accountable to God alone.11 The word “Propaganda” on the papal skullcap denotes the Vatican’s Sacred Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, commonly called the Propaganda. This congregation or department within the Curia, the pope’s cabinet, </page> <page sequence="5">          Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 217 oversaw the church’s mission territories that, until 1908, included the United States. Its function reinforced anticlericalist suspicions that Rome manipulated American Catholics. Under the Propaganda is the Catholic populace, portrayed as so many trapped geese squirming helplessly along the breadth of a forehead etched with a map of the world. On the brow line, in ironic proximity to the brain, the seat of human reason, reside three dogmatic proclamations of Leo’s predecessor, Pius IX. On the right is the 1864 Syllabus of Errors that, among its other points, dismissed the desirability of reconciling the church to the modern world. On the left brow, Keppler has joined an oblique reference to the doctrine of the Immaculate Conception that, in 1854, asserted Mary’s free- dom from Original Sin, with the controversial doctrine of Papal In- fallibility, promulgated sixteen years later and proclaiming papal inerrancy when teaching essential matters of faith and morals. Jux- taposing the words “Immaculate” and “Infallibility” may be a sar- castic reminder that the dogmatic proclamation on Mary preceded the doctrine that formally asserted the pontiff’s authority to render such judgments. On the upper right temple sits an explosive canon (a play on canon law, the church’s disciplinary regulations) of excommunica- tion, the church’s most lethal weapon against dissenters. Just below eye level, Leo’s cheeks, etched with charges of superstition and osten- tation, converge at the nose, shaped as a miniature pontiff crowned with a tiara (symbol of his secular and sacred powers) and whose large buttocks is a burden to those on whom it rests. Leo’s bottom lip and chin, shaped as moneybags, are unsightly. On the former is the claim that he is the (sole?) source of benediction, while the latter re- tains strength only because of generous Catholic contributions to a special collection for the maintenance of the Vatican. Finally, a moat of loyal Catholic newspapers from America and Europe (including the Vatican controlled Osservatore Ro[mano]) defends the doctrinal and disciplinary fortress that separate the papacy and, by implication, the church from the modern world.12 Puck made the pope the embodiment of all that was wrong with the church in the same way that it made the boss of Tammany Hall the personification of corruption in politics. The latter organiza- tion gained special Catholic relevance following the arrest of Scotch- Protestant William “Boss” Tweed in 1871. Succeeding him were a se- ries of seven successive Irish-Catholic bosses, the first two of whom were “Honest” John Kelly (1872–1886) and Richard Croker (1886– 1902). Their durability in a city where more than 40 percent of the population was Irish-Catholic born or bred gave greater plausibility </page> <page sequence="6">            218 Religion and American Culture to the magazine’s comparisons of the church and the machine and to its occasional accusations of complicity between the two.13 John Kelly proved an ideal target in Puck’s crusade against Tammany and the church. His sobriquet, “Honest,” came from his public repudiation of Boss Tweed in 1871, his reputation as former sheriff of New York County who collected fees rather than a salary, and from his reputation as a devout Catholic. During his tenure, he transformed an unruly Tammany ring into an efficient political orga- nization, the blueprint for which seemed inspired by the hierarchical structure of the Catholic church, a fact lost neither on his contempo- rary critics nor on historians. Moreover, when, in 1876, the widower Kelly married the niece of the archbishop of New York, a link between his machine and the church began to look even more probable to Puck.14 Its artists early on contended the likelihood of a connection. One example embellishes an editorial charge in the same issue that Boss Kelly’s effort to force the city’s aldermen to reduce the salaries of their public school teachers was not an attempt to balance the budget (see Fig. 2). Kelly actually planned to plow the savings into Tam- many’s coffers, but cartoonist George Colt tries to convey an even more dastardly purpose: Over city hall, a diminutive whip-wielding Figure 2. “The New York Public School System” (March 20, 1878) </page> <page sequence="7">                 Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 219 Leo XIII drives Boss Kelly to undermine the public school system, while a “Block Head[ed]” board of education obediently shortens its reins over a dedicated teacher and her pupil. At the time this cartoon ran, it was common knowledge that the Catholic hierarchy had made a commitment to building an independent parochial system of schools and that John Kelly was sympathetic to Catholic requests for public funds. It was also no secret that the pope encouraged the ex- pansion of private parish schools to protect the faith of Catholic chil- dren from the Protestant bias of the public schools. Artist Colt, how- ever, has turned papal encouragement into whip-wielding papal tyranny, thus buttressing a popular libel that the church was bent on destroying the public school system, not simply on supplementing it with its own institutions.15 Another cartoon further develops the perception of a linkage between church and machine, this time in the context of a forthcom- ing, important mayoral election (see Fig. 3). The cartoon’s subcaption, “Bennett’s View of City Hall if W. R. Grace Is Elected Mayor,” refers to a scare-piece by the editor of the influential New York Herald express- ing concern over the possible consequences of electing the city’s first Catholic mayor. William R. Grace, the first Catholic nominee for mayor of New York, was a prominent shipping tycoon and Swallowtail (upper- class) Democrat whom John Kelly agreed to support as a compromise with a rival New York City Democratic faction. The cartoon is osten- sibly a poke at the Herald’s alarmism, but Puck artist J. A. Wales’s spoof, in fact, mirrors his magazine’s concerns as well. Despite an ed- itorial disclaimer that the forthcoming election was anything to worry about, the cartoon is another of Puck’s attempts to demonstrate to its readers a connection between the church and Tammany.16 Playing on the well-known personal friendship between Grace, Boss Kelly, and Archbishop McCloskey, the cartoon projects a fear- some and fantastic aftermath of a Grace victory. The city has become a Catholic fairyland, the most important detail of which is an unmistak- able papal presence symbolized by the triple tiara-shaped city hall adjacent to a similarly shaped parochial school in the left background. City hall houses the police department and, appropriately, the offices of Kelly, “McCorkscrew” aka McCloskey, and the superintendent of police; it is also the locus of the tax collector and the “Parochial School Fund Office,” clearly implying the supporting role of one for the other. Outside the building, a horde of clerically robed bureaucrats busily goes about its tasks in varying states of obeisance. The deferen- tial group prominently features a Jew, possibly Judge Myer Samuel Isaacs of the marine or city court, a reform-minded Republican who has donned a bishop’s miter, inscribed though it is with the Star of </page> <page sequence="8">             220 Religion and American Culture Figure 3. “Herald” Hoax No. 2—“The Catholics Are Coming” (October 27, 1880) David. To the crowd’s right, a “Closed” sign has sealed the fate of the anticlerical New York Times headquarters, while the friendlier Democratic New York Sun, edited by Charles A. Dana, and conserva- tive Republican New York Tribune, under Whitelaw Reid, continue to publish.17 In the right foreground, a friendly exchange between Cardi- nal McCloskey, the churchman, and John Kelly, the machine boss, connotes the mutually beneficial nature of their relationship. The archbishop, whose transparent clerical hat suggests a mock halo, rests smugly on his umbrella as he patronizingly assures the boss that all is </page> <page sequence="9">                             Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 221 well. Kelly is comfortable in a bishop’s garb, reminding readers of his clericalist sympathies and religious loyalties as well as the organiza- tional parallels between his machine and the church. He seems to be reminding his coconspirator that their arrangement, including public funds for parochial schools, could last only as long as the church backed his machine. In fact, nothing close to the Herald’s (or Puck’s) nightmarish fantasy occurred following Grace’s slim victory on elec- tion day. Notwithstanding Protestant fears of a “parochial school em- pire,” city statutes prohibited the diversion of public funds to sectar- ian schools. Moreover, Mayor Grace proved less pliable and more principled than Kelly had hoped, so much so that two years later the boss ruthlessly derailed his bid for reelection.18 However much Puck may have proclaimed its own fearless- ness in the face of papal power-lust, as it tried to do in “The Catholics Are Coming,” it never really veered far from the same near-alarmist stance that it ridiculed in the Herald. The magazine relentlessly pro- moted its negative perception of American Catholics, especially the Irish, as papal alter egos and, as in the two previous cartoons, occa- sionally charged that the church and the hall were in cahoots. For Joseph Keppler and his artists, and for the magazine’s long-time editor, Henry Bunner (1878–1892), the mere possibility of such a connection made it probable and worthy of sensational coverage. As they saw it, the two institutions desired power and wealth, not as prerequisites to serving humanity but mainly as a matter of partisan survival and domination. They were indeed birds of a feather.19 A popular tack in Puck’s drive to gainsay the church by nur- turing its image as a political machine was to charge the pope, as it frequently charged Boss Kelly, with capitalizing on the gullibility and blind loyalty of his followers. In one cartoon, Keppler shows poor Catholics dutifully contributing to the annual worldwide collection for the papacy known as “Peter’s Pence”20 (see Fig. 4). The Pence, a nominal voluntary tax from which the poorest were actually exempt, had been revived in 1860 after Pope Pius IX lost a portion of his lands to the developing Italian nation. In this cartoon, the pope’s clerical functionaries do not simply dupe the poor. They compound their ra- pacity by turning over their cache to greedy Jewish money gatherers from the House of Rothschild, legendary bankers to the crowned heads of Europe. Although Puck, by the day’s standards, tended to- ward ambivalence in its attitude toward Jews, it was not above using popular ethnic or racial stereotypes that served its purposes; in this instance, to condemn the papal-dominated church as amoral.21 Among Puck’s portrayals of papal manipulation and greed, some were anthropomorphic. Two years after Keppler condemned </page> <page sequence="10">     222 Religion and American Culture Figure 4. “Whence They Come and Wither They Go”(February 20, 1878) Peter’s Pence, the artist compounded his charge of papal criminality by tying it to the issue of civic charitable aid to the city’s poor (see Fig. 5). In a machiavellian rendering of Leo the lion, the pope callously confiscates funds intended for the poverty-stricken, among them many Irish Catholics. The helplessness of the simian Irishman (a de- rogatory image appropriated from British cartoonists) is even more galling by his juxtaposition to the brutishness of the grasping pontiff. Even worse than his Tammany counterpart, who at least disperses crumbs of patronage to his loyal flock, the manipulative pope drains the poor of funds they can ill afford to lose. Worse still, the public </page> <page sequence="11">             Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 223 Figure 5. “The Lion’s Share” (April 14, 1880) source of the money he pilfers transforms his selfishness into a crime against the American people.22 The litany of organizational similarities and vices—hierarchy, secrecy, greed—with which Puck tried to link the church with Tam- many were symptoms whose manifestation it attributed to three fundamental papal missteps. Specifically, Puck derived its anti- Catholic brief from a righteous understanding of two doctrinal decla- rations and one political stance defended by the papacy. First was Pope Pius IX’s 1864 Syllabus of Errors, widely interpreted among non- Catholics as the church’s repudiation of the modern world. Next was </page> <page sequence="12">                       224 Religion and American Culture the 1870 declaration of papal infallibility, commonly misunderstood as all-inclusive when, in fact, it had very limited application. Last was the pope’s refusal to concede the loss of papal sovereignty over land- holdings lost during the decade-long national struggle for Italian uni- fication. His position, which hounded the church for nearly three quarters of a century, gave Puck additional ammunition with which to politicize the papacy.23 To Keppler and company, the political threat that the pope and his church presented to the principle of church-state separation was even more dangerous than the political menace posed by Tammany Hall because, unlike the latter, the former did not have to turn out the vote to stay in power. Rather, the pope assumed a di- vine mandate to justify his claims to temporal sovereignty, infallibil- ity, and his animus toward modernity. That mandate was a smoke- screen to beguile the gullible, and Puck saw itself as an instrument to expose the fraud and enlighten the public.24 More than any other papal stance, Leo’s support for the resto- ration of the Papal States, popularly referred to as the Roman Ques- tion, stirred the greatest animosity in the press and colored its cover- age of major papal pronouncements on church-state relations. After all, critics reasoned, if the pope desired the return of his former politi- cal status, who could predict what other geographical boundaries he might cross? If he could not get his hands on his old holdings, would he look to other possibilities, perhaps even impose his presence in the New World?25 Puck shared this sentiment. Moreover, its wariness over the pope’s claims to temporal power and the virulently anticlerical car- toons with which it tried to stigmatize the papacy had some basis in the web of Italian/Vatican politics. Pope Leo XIII, like Pius IX before him, contended the illegality of the nation’s possession of the formal Papal States. Though much less vociferous and a good deal more dip- lomatic than his predecessor, Leo’s public stance (privately he did not really expect their return) grated on his critics. Nor did he repudiate the moniker “Prisoner of the Vatican,” adopted by Pius, and, like his predecessor, he also refused the Italian government’s conciliatory offer to compensate the Vatican for its losses. Papal intransigence on the question of temporal power facilitated Puck’s comparisons of the church and Tammany. Like the boss of Tammany Hall, the pope was a political and constitutional obstructionist, an obstacle to the full resto- ration of mugwump democracy (that is, rule by the “best” men) to American life.26 Given this mindset, Puck read Leo’s encyclicals and letters on church-state relations as corroborating evidence that its views were correct. A case in point was its response to the landmark 1885 encyclical, </page> <page sequence="13"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 225 Immortali Dei (“On the Christian Constitution of States”), addressed to the world’s Catholic bishops. In its narrowest political context, the papal letter was part of an effort to end Germany’s anti-Catholic leg- islation and to lay a basis for later attempts to reconcile the papacy with the French Third Republic. In that political context, the pope as- serted that, since church and state received their respective authority from God, they had to work in harmony. And while the pontiff con- ceded that the state was not bound to any particular political form, he stressed that it must never assume a shape that disregarded either religion or the public’s welfare.27 When Leo challenged the secular notion that the Catholic church derived its freedom from the state rather than from God, he provoked considerable criticism, including the accusation that his letter had implications for church-state relations in the United States. While the letterpress was in disagreement as to whether the papal letter had any application to the nation, Puck was certain that it did. Keppler replied to the pope’s specific encouragement to Catholics that they should be active in civic affairs as long as they followed principles of conduct established by the church (see Fig. 6). The car- toon suggests where the results of Catholic activism in the United States could lead if Americans did not remain vigilant. On panels in the upper left corner, select quotes from the encyclical buttress the artist’s contention of a papal conspiracy against freedom. The last quotation sums up the source of the cartoonist’s fears: “All Catholics should do all in their power to cause the Constitution of States and legislation to be modeled in the principles of the true church.” In an age when electoral shenanigans were commonplace, and in a city where a substantial portion of the population was not only Irish Catholic but also supported Tammany, Puck’s depiction of a papal-inspired Catholic conspiracy to dominate the vote must surely have resonated with the magazine’s largely Protestant and middle- class readership. They were used to the almost weekly pictorial as- saults on the city’s machine-dominated governing structure, and they expected cartoons detailing Tammany’s attempts to influence, if not manipulate, every election. The heart-beat regularity with which these topics permeated nearly every issue would have made it diffi- cult, if not impossible, for the reader not to notice the similarity be- tween Leo’s reach through the ballot box and the control that Tam- many’s bosses had already secured over the city’s electoral process.28 Puck’s editors warned that some day the ballot box might be filled with the votes of loyal Catholics, not just loyal supporters of Tammany Hall. Keppler’s cartoon in this instance visually opined the same message that both mugwump friendly and reactionary </page> <page sequence="14"> 226 Religion and American Culture Figure 6. “At It Again, Through the Ballot Box to the Constitution” (November 18, 1885) newspapers were printing. The New York Times, for example, editori- alized that Catholics would obey “the Constitution and the political traditions of the United States . . . only so far as they are in accord with ‘admonitions’ from Rome.” A few months after the pope issued the encyclical, another influential journal, the Episcopal Churchman, was histrionic: Leo’s missive, explained the Reverend George S. Baker, was part of a conspiracy “to conquer these United States through the ballot, and to change our Constitution and laws into conformity to the principles of the . . . Church.”29 Two years later, in 1887, shortly after the pope negotiated an end to Germany’s anti-Catholic legislation or Kulturkampf, the Protes- tant Christian Union and the mugwumpish New York Times surmised </page> <page sequence="15"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 227 that papal interference in German politics might be a prelude to similar intrusions into American politics. George Woodberry, in Harper’s Weekly, put the matter poetically in an open letter to Leo: “dost thou think to tame God’s young plantation in the virgin West? The great republic of the poor . . . dream not the children of this sod, [c]ease to be freemen when they bow to God.” Much of the city’s letterpress was similarly inclined.30 Puck, then, was not alone in its suspicions. It was unique, however, in its persistent portrayal of the pope as a virtual political boss and his church as simply another form of corrupt political ma- chinery. As editor Henry Bunner reiterated, not only did the church and Tammany Hall both run tightly knit, bureaucratically centralized organizations, their bosses also expected unquestioning loyalty and punished insubordination. They each had their loyal soldiers who helped them perpetuate their positions and pursue their quest for money and power. Followers received rewards that sustained their loyalty. Puck finagled a montage of partial truths into a persuasive brief that warned its readers of the perils of machine politics, whether in the religious or secular realm. Its charge of a “Catholic connection” with corrupt Tammany Hall was a shrewd tactical move that it hoped would further legitimize its case against the church.31 In 1888, the encyclical Libertas (On the Nature of Human Lib- erty) provided another occasion for the magazine to caution the un- wary and rally the likeminded against the church’s attack on the Con- stitution. Among the points in the letter that elicited the most hostile responses in the press were Leo’s assertions that no state should treat all religions equally and that countries whose populations were largely Catholic should give the church special government protec- tion. Although he addressed his letter to members of the Catholic hi- erarchy across the world, the pope wrote it primarily for Europe. As such, it did not present a direct challenge to the premises on which the American political system functioned.32 Some newspapers ac- knowledged that the pope intended his letter primarily for the gov- ernments of Italy and France, but overall the press spent more time surmising the letter’s implications for America. The encyclical contin- ued to resonate in some quarters of the letterpress for more than a year. In Our Day, an avowedly anti-Catholic journal published in Boston, evangelist J. Burton harped on the encyclical’s allegedly omi- nous meaning: “Americans must beware . . . or the Papal dream may come true and the Vatican flourish in the Central Park of New York.”33 Puck followed suit with a cartoon framed, however satirically, in much the same extreme spirit (see Fig. 7). Keppler mockingly de- picts an ecstatic Leo XIII dreaming of an America run by and for the </page> <page sequence="16"> 228 Religion and American Culture Figure 7. “The Pope’s Dream—A Roman Catholic America” (July 24, 1889) church. In the upper right hand corner, a banner reading “Friendly Sons of Office and Spoils” identifies a group of cleric-politicos. It is an obvious reference to the church as machine, but it is also a hard jab at the Irish who dominated big city politics. Etched in the canopy over the enthroned “Irish pope,” a treasonous pledge proclaims, “The Church First—The Country Afterwards.” Parading into the foreground from the upper left corner, a slew of simian-like Celtic ambassadors and high-ranking clerics of the Propaganda (the Vatican department that oversaw the American church) pass the papal bed stand. All arrogantly </page> <page sequence="17"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 229 await or receive their orders, while behind them others bow before a future Irish-American pope/president. As in any corrupt political machine, “office and spoils” reign supreme.34 In the editorial for the same issue, Henry Bunner stretched mightily to connect the cartoon to the contentious presidential cam- paign of the previous year that pitted incumbent Democrat Grover Cleveland against Republican challenger Benjamin Harrison. He ad- monished the faction of mugwumps who had reverted to their Re- publican roots and supported Harrison in the election then reminded his readers that Harrison, unlike his (Puck-supported) predecessor, Grover Cleveland, had hoodwinked the voters and reneged on his campaign promise to decide appointments based on merit alone. In like manner, the editor surmised, a Roman Catholic presidential can- didate, however unlikely, could also make promises and not keep them. After all, a number of Catholics would like to see the pope extend his temporal power over the United States. “Why,” then, “should not a Roman Catholic do for his Church what the Republican has done for his party? We would not suffer it? Perhaps not. But why do we suffer this? And why do we allow in a Republican the same tyr- annous disregard of the public rights that we would resent in a Roman Catholic? And, as a matter of practical business, if one can grab the whole government, what excuse will you have for stopping the other if he tries to do the same thing?”35 The frequency with which Puck and most of the letterpress Americanized papal pronouncements on church-state relations was no doubt influenced by the fact that the pontiff’s encyclicals coin- cided with a twenty-year period of unprecedented papal interven- tions in the affairs of the American Catholic church. All of the rea- sons for which he intervened—including those pertaining to the volatile issue of church-state relations—touched important threads in the fabric of a society shaped largely by the Protestant experience. In 1890, a New York Times editorial spoke for much of the press, in- cluding Puck, when it explained its own tendency to Americanize papal pronouncements, particularly those dealing with some facet of church-state relations: It is one of the drawbacks of being Catholic and infallible that when you promulgate any official document it must appear to be relevant to the state of the whole Church, though it may in fact be inspired by nothing beyond your own personal situation. . . . An encyclical cannot be issued without affecting more or less the opinions and actions of all Catholics. It is impossible not to treat as important, in reference to ourselves, a letter upon the relations of Church and State in general from a person whom </page> <page sequence="18"> 230 Religion and American Culture several millions of Americans regard as infallible, and whose instructions they take as authoritative.36 Puck’s cartoon attacks on the papacy certainly reflected that attitude. Keppler and his staff graphically configured both the pope’s encyclicals and his interventions as parts of a strategy to undermine the nation’s constitutional freedoms.37 The magazine’s reaction, for example, to a papal letter that was also an act of intervention alleged Catholic designs on public schools as the basis for a scathing attack on the pope (see Fig. 8). In this instance, Puck was responding to Leo’s mid-1893 apostolic letter to the American hierarchy, Clara Saepenumero Figure 8. “Sour Grapes” (July 12, 1893) </page> <page sequence="19"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 231 (“On the School Question”). Among his key points, the pope reiter- ated the decree of the Third Plenary Council Baltimore (1884) in which the American bishops called for the establishment of parochial schools and emphasized the obligation of Catholic parents to send their children to such schools wherever practicable.38 This papal missive followed on the heels of a long growing divide between the liberal or Americanist bishops and the conserva- tive or more traditionalist bishops.39 In this case, the two groups were at loggerheads over St. Paul, Minnesota, Archbishop (and American- ist) John Ireland’s plan to accept public funds for his parochial schools on the condition that his teachers would provide religious instruction after regular school hours. Earlier, the pope had issued a decree of tol- eration for the arrangement but finally decided to send his personal representative, Archbishop Francesco Satolli, to resolve the divisions in the hierarchy with a compromise settlement. Leo’s letter was an important part of a calculated move intended to heal the breach.40 For Puck, however, Leo’s mediation was nothing but “sour grapes,” the grapes symbolizing the public schools hanging just be- yond his reach. Just as Aesop’s fox had rationalized as sour the grapes he coveted but could not reach, so also did the foxy pope. In truth, it was Leo’s and the majority of bishops’ way of trying to shield the faith of Catholic children from what they perceived as the Protestant prejudices of public schools. Puck, however, refused to budge from its conspiracy theory: if Leo could, he would take over that bastion of true Americanism and convert it into a citadel of superstition and subservience to Rome. Short, for the time being, of accomplishing that goal, the Catholic church was building its own system to counter and weaken the influence of the public schools. A year later, shortly before his death, Joseph Keppler bloated the same accusation to alarmist proportions (see Fig. 9). Precipitating the cartoon was Leo XIII’s formal appointment of Archbishop Satolli as the first permanent (and resident) apostolic delegate to the American Catholic church. The nation’s more liberal bishops, especially Arch- bishop John Ireland of St. Paul, Minnesota, James Cardinal Gibbons, Archbishop of Baltimore, Bishop John Keane, first rector of the Catholic University of America, and Peoria, Illinois, Bishop John Spalding had initially assumed that Satolli supported their more conciliatory, ecu- menical, and far less defensive approach to Protestant-Catholic rela- tions. During his first year in the United States, Satolli did just that. Then his own innate conservatism and growing disillusionment turned him toward the conservative bishops (such as New York’s Archbishop Michael Corrigan who succeeded Cardinal McCloskey in 1884) and their more ultramontane (papalist) and traditional religious outlook.41 </page> <page sequence="20"> 232 Religion and American Culture Figure 9. “The American Pope” (September 5, 1894) In Keppler’s hands, however, the very inception of Francesco Satolli’s appointment was a bad sign. In the artist’s rendering, Satolli resides as supreme papal alter ego, an “American Pope,” at the very least a “deputy Pope.” Symbolically perched atop a fictional St. Peter’s- like dome of his headquarters at the recently established (1889) and pontifically controlled Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., the delegate casts the shadow of a smirking, grasping Leo XIII across the American landscape. Particularly noteworthy is that the pope’s hip (pocket?) envelops the nation’s Capitol building, while the rest of his likeness either covers or is in proximity to various flagged public schools throughout the land. In an accompanying commentary, the editor asserted that Satolli’s intentions were as plain as the “iniquitous Spelissy Bill” (un- successfully proposed by an Irish-Catholic assemblyman) that would have given New York State school funds to parochial schools. The edi- tor assured his readers that Americans would never tolerate such an ar- rangement and that even most American Catholics “would rather send their children to the public school[s].”42 Concerns, however, remained: Now we have an annex to St. Peter’s, a little vatican [sic] of our own, and a real Pope to grace it. And how ingenuous, delicate and unobtrusive was his coming. Pope Leo never did a smarter bit of work than when he gave us this American Pope. He sugar </page> <page sequence="21"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 233 coated the pill and we gulped it down. The American people have received with pleasure what they had long cried out against. We have a Pope, and it is just a little more impossible than ever for a man to be a good Catholic and a good American.43 Less than two years after Satolli’s appointment, Leo’s 1895 encyclical, Longinqua Oceani (“Across the Ocean”), to the American hi- erarchy seemed to corroborate Puck’s concerns. Although generally laudatory of the American church, the pontiff’s explicit warning against the absolute desirability of church-state separation not only distressed the minority of liberal American bishops, it also reconfirmed some of the press’s worst suspicions about the pope’s intentions to- ward the United States. Puck responded with a defensively nationalis- tic cartoon by J. S. Pughe (see Fig. 10) that features Miss Columbia as the personification of the American spirit.44 Within sight of the endan- gered public schools in the background, she responds firmly but with civility to the pope’s smiling invitation to join him. The scene embel- lishes the editor’s sardonic advice that Columbia should respond in kind to the feigned affection with which Leo hides his real identity and intent for the nation—that of the lion approaching a lamb before the slaughter. Hence, the dialogue that follows the caption: HIS HOLINESS.—Dear Miss Columbia, won’t you come under my robe?—you’ll be so much more comfortable!—For further particulars, see my late encyclical [Longinqua Oceani]. Figure 10. “Declined with Thanks” (February 13, 1895) </page> <page sequence="22"> 234 Religion and American Culture MISS COLUMBIA.—Much obliged Pop; but I’m doing very well as I am.45 If Puck interpreted Longinqua Oceani as a bad omen for the country, it treated Leo’s apostolic letter, Testem Benevolentiae (“A Testi- mony of My Benevolence”), as the omen’s fulfillment. Addressed in March 1899 to James Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore but intended for all of his brother bishops, Leo cautioned the nation’s Catholics, in- cluding the liberal bishops, against trying to Americanize the church in the United States beyond certain theological limits. “He warned against promoting the direct guidance of the Holy Spirit upon the in- dividual and discarding . . . external religious guidance by the Church; proclaiming the superiority of the natural . . . over the super- natural virtues and the irrelevance of the passive virtues [e.g., obedi- ence]; and trying to discredit the value of religious vows.”46 The liberal bishops “never denied that there were differences between their approach to Catholicism and that of the conservatives [such as Archbishop Michael Corrigan of New York]. They were gen- erally friendlier toward Protestants than the latter and more willing to reconcile the Church with democracy and science without fearing that they would undermine their faith.” In addition, liberals tended to be less literal “in their interpretation of the pope’s authoritative, [but] non-infallible teachings.” They also “desired a greater degree of de- Romanization than the conservatives did in the operation and poli- cies of the American Church . . . and stressed the importance of devel- oping active [social] virtues far more than did the [more tradition bound] conservatives. Yet they denied that these differences were anything more than methodological” and vehemently protested their orthodoxy and loyalty to the pope and the church.47 Puck’s editor was aware that liberal Catholics were circling in defense of their orthodoxy. Like his secular and Protestant counter- parts in the letterpress, he believed that the papal letter targeted opin- ions held by the minority of enlightened American Catholic leaders. Such notions as support for church-state separation, he argued, were perfectly Christian, and Leo should have at least condoned, not con- demned, them. Testem would only serve to suppress truly American and Christian ideas held by some enlightened American Catholics and would further alienate the American Catholic church from the nation.48 In anger, sadness, and a bit of cartoon theater, Joseph Keppler, Jr., son and heir of the deceased senior Keppler, gave his magazine’s characteristically cynical spin to the papal letter and to what was widely perceived as the pope’s hard line against any open-minded </page> <page sequence="23"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 235 Figure 11. “The Old ‘Americanism’ Good Enough” (March 29, 1899) thinking about the acculturation of the Catholic church in the United States. His cartoon shows a scheming Leo climbing the dome of the U.S. Capital, intent on replacing the American flag with a cross (see Fig. 11). At it again, the old fox was trying to undermine the constitu- tional mandate of church-state separation and secure a privileged place for his sixteen million citizen-minions.49 The editorial mused: He [the Pope] suspects that this iniquitous heresy [“the evil spirit of Liberty”] is peculiarly rife here, and it must be guarded against; for holding any opinion one pleases is as wicked to-day [sic] as it was when the Roman Catholic church punished that audacious heretic who declared that the earth revolved around </page> <page sequence="24"> 236 Religion and American Culture the sun. Nor can there be ever a change. . . . The sun still re- volves around the earth, for [and here he quotes from the letter] “that meaning of the sacred dogma is perpetually to be retained which our Holy Mother the Church has once declared: nor is that meaning ever to be departed from under the pretence or pretext of a deeper comprehension of them.” It is possible that there will some time be a Catholic American government; but there never can be an American Catholic church;—that, we would say, is the sum of the letter.50 Testem Benevolentiae was no surprise to Puck. It seemed, in fact, the inevitable climax to the dogmatic rigidity and constitutional threats that, in its view, imbued many of the pope’s earlier pro- nouncements and actions. Moreover, Puck read Testem as a confirma- tion of its own long-held suspicion of the papacy and the institutional Catholic church. The editor later historicized: By its own tale the Church is in bad days. . . . The situation is not novel. Periodically, through all its days, the Church has had to face it. First it produces heretics; then it expels them. And after a time of protest it moves forward to where the offenders stood. There follows a time of rest, until other heretics push on and blaze another section of the endless path.51 With this estimate of the church—past, present, and fu- ture—the magazine concluded its pictorial coverage of the papacy in the Gilded Age. Throughout the period, Puck had stayed its mugwump course, pushing the religion of reform and all but giv- ing up on the reform of religion, particularly that of the Roman Catholic church. Into its crusade against crooked Tammany politi- cians and their numerous Irish-Catholic supporters, it added that supreme boss, the pope, who, with the help of his loyal American followers, seemed intent on not only restoring his temporal power in Italy but also menacingly enlarging his presence and influence in the United States. The magazine’s memorable and mocking por- trayals of Pope Leo XIII helped entrench in the nation’s cultural iconography an image of papal greed, power lust, and subversion that ideologically and religiously connected the Catholic church to Tammany Hall. The magazine’s assumption about the supreme homage that Catholics were required to give to the pope made it relatively simple for it to configure those Americans who professed to be good Catho- lics into disloyal citizens who were threats to the constitutional stipu- lation of church-state separation, not to mention free speech. It was a rendering congenial to Puck’s mugwump outlook, its self-proclaimed </page> <page sequence="25"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 237 status as guardian of the Constitution, and its crusade to “throw out the crooks” wherever it found them. Although its spectacular graphics and sophisticated if cynical editorials gave Puck’s attacks on the papacy a unique advantage, its anticlericalism meshed with that of other non-Catholic American papers, magazines, and journals. The era, after all, was one of height- ened national feeling and simultaneously heavy Catholic immigra- tion, more and more of it from the undemocratic regions of southern and eastern Europe. Most of those Catholic immigrants openly es- poused both their religious beliefs and their allegiance to the pope, a once powerful and still aspiring foreign potentate who oversaw their spiritual lives. As early as 1882, when rumors abounded that the pope was threatening to leave Rome unless the Italian state restored his temporal power, E. L. Godkin, editor of the influential Nation of New York, sarcastically cautioned Leo not to consider the United States as a place of residence: “It would be an awkward thing for the Pope to re- side in a country where he might be sued for damages if he deprived a priest of his living in the way of church discipline, and where his very tiara might be attached for debt unless exempted as one of the necessary parts of his professional outfit.”52 Puck greatly improved on letterpress sarcasm with master- fully wrought chromolithographic images through which it conjoined its crusades against both papalism and bossism. Sparing no opportu- nity to sound their clarion for reform, Joseph Keppler and his artists entwined their journalistic struggle against bossism in the City with what they saw as a moral obligation to preempt possible papal domi- nation from the Eternal City. They combined their two battle fronts with relative ease because they believed in the righteousness of their cause and because they saw so many similarities between their two adversaries, whether at Tammany or the Vatican. For the country’s good, the pontiff’s words and actions, like those of the Irish-Catholic bosses who ran New York, required constant vigilance and exposure. With so much at stake, nothing less would do.

Joseph Keppler and his cofounder, Adolf Schwarzmann, pub- lished both German and English language versions of Puck. The former, be- gun in 1876, preceded the English edition by several months and lasted twenty-one years. It contained the same cartoons, but its articles were written for New York’s large German-American community. The more famous, en- during, and, by 1880, more profitable version was the English language Puck published in New York City from March 1877 to September 1918.

Since that time, the term has taken on a broader meaning to describe those who supported political independence or nonpar- tisanship and specifically those elitist, middle-class, urban reformers, both be- fore and after 1884, who wanted to restore honesty to the electoral process at all levels and worked for civil service reform as a way to eliminate patronage and the spoils system from the political process. Mugwumps also opposed monopoly, favored free trade, battled labor radicalism, opposed the clerical- ism of organized religion, and expressed contempt for immigrants, especially the Irish, who exchanged their votes for favors from machine bosses. There are a large number of studies that describe mugwump ideology in detail. Among the best are: David M. Tucker, Mugwumps: Public Moralists of the Gilded Age (Columbia: University of Missouri Press, 1998); Gerald W.

Competing interpretations continue over whether mugwumps advocated reform to regain their class’s lost political status in post-Civil War urban America (Sproat) or were driven by a strong moralistic sense of righ- teousness and principle (Tucker), although the latter view has gained consid- erable support. For an analysis of mugwump cartoonists and their battle to bring down Tammany Hall, see Samuel J.

Its value as an object of historical study lay, in part, in the consensus building that preceded every issue’s cartoons. Al- though lead cartoonist and cofounder Joseph Keppler had the last word, he did so only after conferencing with his staff, whose input he valued. More- over, in contrast to its chief rival, the avowedly Republican Judge, Puck pro- claimed and strove for nonpartisanship or independence, hence its mug- wump orientation. 5. There is no historiography as such on the Catholic image in Gilded Age graphic art. Among the handful of essays that deal with the sub- ject, the earliest and most direct treatment is in Eid, “Puck and the Irish,” 18– 35. Less focused on the church but nonetheless helpful is Leroy V. Eid, “Puck, the Irish, and Irish Americans, 1877–1890,” Irish American Review (Fall 1979): 71–79. See, too, Samuel J. Thomas, “Portraits of a Rebel Priest: Edward Mc- Glynn in Caricature, 1886–1893,” Journal of American Culture 7 (Winter 1984): 19–34. Cartoonists for other magazines, notably the Republican Judge and Harper’s Weekly, occasionally implied or charged connections between the church, the Irish, and Tammany. See, for example, “Exultant Tammanyite,” Harper’s Weekly, October 30, 1880, 695.

Mott, American Magazines, 525–28; Thomas, “Holding the Tiger,” 158. West, Satire on Stone, 285, notes that Puck’s paid circulation actually topped 125,000 during the presidential campaign of 1884. 7. Mugwump moralism is the topic of a recently acclaimed study by David M. Tucker, Mugwumps: Public Moralists of the Gilded Age. For a discussion </page> <page sequence="28"> 240 Religion and American Culture of Puck’s nonpartisanship, see the author’s “Holding the Tiger.” “Honest” John Kelly, proudly known as a devout Catholic, succeeded the Scotch-Presbyterian Tweed in the late 1870s. Under his influence, William Grace became New York City’s first Irish-Catholic mayor in 1880. For an insightful discussion of the resurgent anti-Catholicism and its heavily anticlerical component at the beginning of the Gilded Age, see John McGreevy, Catholicism and American Freedom: A History (New York: W.W. Norton, 2003), chap. 4. For a discussion that sets anti-Catholicism in its broader nativist context, see too John Higham’s classic, Strangers in the Land: Patterns of American Nativism, 1865–1920, 2d ed. (New Brunswick, N.J.: Rutgers University Press, 1988), chap. 2, especially 26– 34. Puck’s identification of the pope as another boss was more prescient than it realized. In Jay Dolan’s prize-winning study of The Immigrant Church: New York’s Irish and German Catholics, 1815–1865 (Baltimore: The Johns Hopkins University Press, 1975), 167–68, the historian referred to the increasing central- ization of power by the pope and bishops as “the emergence of boss rule in the church.” 8. One of a number of influential publications that helped establish the psychological framework for many of the accusations later made by Puck against the papacy is Edward Beecher, The Papal Conspiracy Exposed, and Prot- estantism Defended, in the Light of Reason, History, and Scripture (New York: M. W. Dodd, 1855; repr., New York: Arno Press, 1977). See also, Cornell presi- dent Andrew Dickson White’s reference to “priestly influence in Tammany Hall,” quoted in McGreevy, Catholicism and American Freedom, 105. 9. McGreevy, Catholicism and American Freedom, mentions “Grant, Garfield, and Hayes, George William Curtis . . . at Harper’s . . . E. L. Godkin of the Nation, Joseph Medill of the Chicago Tribune, and the editors of the New York Times” (93). Fischer, Damned Pictures, 23, credits Thomas Nast as the “in- tuitive genius whose tantrums against Tammany and Rome essentially de- fined the profession of political cartooning for [Puck’s] Keppler” and other important cartoonists that followed him. 10. To reiterate, the best general work on the nature and significance of the political cartoon is Press, The Political Cartoon.

For a contemporary assessment of the political cartoon in which Puck plays a featured role, see Mitchell, “Contemporary American Car- icature,” 728–44. He observes that the “American public have a weakness for intellectual art. They like an idea in their pictures, and if they can have it well told, graphic, technically good, and with a touch of human nature, they like it all the better” (735). Puck’s cartoons were among the best examples of such art (730, 734). </page> <page sequence="29"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 241 11. The term “anticlericalism,” as used in this essay, was simply the most salient component of Puck’s anti-Catholicism rather than distinct from it. Richard P. McBrien, ed., The Harper-Collins Encyclopedia of Catholicism (San Francisco: Harper SanFrancisco, 1995), 324, gives the most contextualized definition of the word clericalism: “a term coined ca. 1865 in Italy to describe a supposed system employed by clergy to oppose Italian unity. It also refers to attitudes and behaviors of clergy designed to underscore the privileged status of priests and bishops. The term enjoyed some currency in both France and Italy in the nineteenth century because it provided a convenient label by which those who mistrusted religion in general, and the Catholic church in particular, could advance an antireligious agenda. The supposed aim of the clericalist system was the subjugation of civil government to the control of the pope through the influence of local bishops and priests. The term later ex- panded to include any perceived incursion of religion into public affairs, par- ticularly those involving attempts to gain power over the state.” For a broader definition that is still consistent with McBrien’s, see Jose Sanchez, An- ticlericalism: A Brief History (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1972), 1–11. 12. Other early Puck cartoons that played on one or more of the themes explained here include: “Go for It,” February 20, 1878; “The Papal Fish. Italy Again Comes in for the Pickings,” February 27, 1878; “Who De- cides the European Questions? To Which Power Must All Things Yield?” March 13, 1878; and “Monarchical Devotion—A Mighty Fortress Is Our God,” January 7, 1880. 13.

German Americans numbered about 430,000, but the Irish were much more homogeneous religiously and politically than were the more divided Germans and were the mainstay of Democratic strength in the city.

Alfred Connable and Edward Silberfarb, Tigers of Tammany: Nine Men Who Ruled New York (New York: Holt, Rinehart and Winston, 1967), 178, 181–83, argue persuasively that Boss Kelly, thoroughly imbued with Roman Catholic ritual and organization, was influenced “by the Church’s sense of hi- erarchy and authority in drawing up his plans for Tammany and in maintain- ing institutional discipline.” He also kept up the Tammany custom of giving </page> <page sequence="30"> 242 Religion and American Culture large cash donations to the church, another basis for allegations of collusion.

The Catholic bishops’ attempts to secure public funding for Catholic schools (on grounds that the so-called public school was seriously antagonistic toward Catholic students and a direct threat to their religious beliefs) began in earnest in 1840 under New York’s Bishop John Hughes. Subsequent efforts by other bishops also failed, although in a number of dioceses (most notably in Poughkeepsie, New York) city officials and pastors were able to work out compromises that allowed for some public funding on condition that the teachers would pro- vide religious instruction after regular school hours. In 1894, a New York State constitutional convention outlawed arrangements that provided public funds to private schools. The “school controversy” is long and complex, and while the cartoonists’ treatment of it has yet to be critically examined, several scholars have analyzed the issue. Thomas J. Shelley, “Poughkeepsie School Plan,” in The Encyclopedia of American Catholic History, ed. Michael Glazier and Thomas J. Shelly (Collegeville, Minn.: Liturgical Press, 1997), 1159–60; Neil G.

See, too, Allen, The Tiger, 164–65. The extent of Puck’s hostility to- ward the church, however intense its expression, did not go as far as the more extreme anti-Catholic American Protective Association (APA), whose heyday lasted from 1887 to about 1894. In the cartoon “Darn Ye Both” and the ac- companying Editorial, “Bigot against Zealot,” November 7, 1894, Puck con- demned the APA as even more insidious than the church against which it railed. It found the organization’s general lack of civility, extreme language, secrecy and “hunger for office” . . . “more inimical [than any church] to all that is vital and honorable to our political system.” Here was a classic in- stance of moralistic mugwumps disagreeing more with the means employed </page> <page sequence="31"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 243 than the ends served.

Kinzer, An Episode in Anti-Catholicism: The American Protective Association (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1964). 17. Both Republican Whitelaw Reid and Democrat Charles A. Dana were frequent targets of Puck’s cartoonists. Both men, for example, received ridicule in the cartoon “Mugwump!” June 23, 1886.

The magazine concurred with the popular suspicion that Catho- lics were out to undermine public schools, but its immediate concern may have stemmed from the days of Boss Tweed who, between 1869 and 1871, had been instrumental in securing $1.5 million of public funds (from both the state and the city) for Catholic schools and charities.

McCloskey’s successor, Michael Corrigan, during the ten- ure of Kelly’s successor, Richard Croker, secured the support of the Tammany Democracy in his program to build numerous parochial schools in Manhat- tan. Burrows and Wallace, Gotham, 1094; quote from 1104. Puck used the con- nection to further its argument of collusion between the church and the hall. See “Beyond Resuscitation,” Puck, December 12, 1894. Puck’s cartoons on the school question were heirs to those of Harper’s Thomas Nast and often echoed the mean-spiritedness of his infamous “The American River Ganges,” Harper’s Weekly, September 30, 1871, showing bishops as crocodiles crawling ashore to devour American school children. 19. Editorial, “To Leo XIII,” Puck, June 25, 1887. The magazine per- sisted in its antipapal/anticlerical mode despite papal actions that evoked a more positive response from important papers and journals, especially be- tween 1888 and 1894, when Leo’s sympathies seemed to favor what scholars have labeled the liberal or Americanist element in the Catholic hierarchy. See Samuel J. Thomas, “The American Press and the Encyclical Longinqua Oceani,” Journal of Church and State 22 (Autumn 1980): 477–78. Keppler and Bunner never changed their negative perception. For an example of how Puck viewed Irish political clout, see “They All Do It—Cringing Before the Irish Vote and Support,” April 3, 1889. 20. See, too, “The Papal Farm, A Craze for Religious Colonization,” Puck, July 16, 1879. The accompanying editorial mockingly asks: “And if the Catholics fill up our Western waste places, what are our Judges, Lawyers, Sheriffs, etc., to do for a living, when an ‘indulgence’ for crime may be pur- chased cheap for cash?” </page> <page sequence="32"> 244 Religion and American Culture 21. As early as 1878, Puck editorials, February 20 and February 27, pushed the theme of papal greed. As historian Roger Fischer noted in his Damned Pictures, “The popular humor of the day was raucously, unapologeti- cally elitist in its ethnicity,” especially with regard to blacks, Irish, and Jews (70). Puck unabashedly took part in their ridicule, although, strange as it may seem, it also defended Jews and blacks on occasion and, at times, even en- dowed its favorite target, the Irishman, with victim status. See, too, West, Sat- ire on Stone, 344. Puck’s favoritism toward German-speaking immigrants is obvious in “A Family Party,” October 3, 1883. See John J. Appel, “Jews in American Caricature, 1820–1914,” American Jewish History 71 (September 1981): 103–33, and Fischer, Damned Pictures, 71, 90–100, for a good analysis of the uses of stereotype in Gilded Age cartoons. 22. Puck used animal forms to personify Tammany bosses and other unsavory types as well. See, for example, “Puck’s Political Hunting Ground,” January 14, 1885; and “The Temptation,” September 19, 1883. 23. Accompanying “The Infallible,” November 21, 1877, a cartoon on the imminent death of Pope Pius IX, the editorial explains the magazine’s attitude toward the church and papacy: “the head of an iniquitous political- religious system, based on deplorable ignorance and revolting superstition . . . there will at least be one bigot less in the world.” Some Catholic readers pro- tested Puck’s treatment of Pius. In response, the magazine’s editor declared that the magazine had never attacked the church but rather “certain social and political abuses. . . . Seeing the whole organization of this religion prosti- tuted by unworthy officials; used as a mere money-getting machine.” Then the editor went to the heart of his magazine’s stand: “It has always been the misuse of the temporal power vested in the administration of church govern- ment which we sought to expose.” The cartoons “Going for It,” February 20, 1878, “The Papal Fish,” February 27, 1878, and “Cardinal McCloskey’s Disap- pointment,” March 6, 1878, provide additional explanations of the antipapal stance that Puck would pursue for the next two decades. For a study of “The American press response to the death of Pope Pius IX and the election of Pope Leo XIII,” see the author’s article in the Records of the American Catholic Histori- cal Society of Philadelphia 86 (March–December 1975): 43–52. See, too, Samuel J. Thomas, “The American Press and the Church-State Pronouncements of Pope Leo XIII,” U.S. Catholic Historian 1 (Fall 1980): 17–36, for a discussion of the full range of the press’s response to the pope’s encyclicals on the subject. 24. For examples of Puck’s attitude toward the doctrine of papal in- fallibility, see “The Infallible,” November 21, 1877, and “April Fools Day,” March 27, 1878. Editorial, Puck, March 6, 1878, defends Keppler against charges of anti-Catholic bigotry: “Mr. Keppler seizes this opportunity to men- tion the fact that he too is a Roman Catholic born, living, and hoping to die in </page> <page sequence="33"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 245 the faith, and go to heaven of the late lamented pontiff [Pius IX].” L. Draper Hill, Jr., “What Fools These Mortals Be! A Study of the Work of Joseph Keppler— Founder of Puck” (Bachelor’s thesis, Harvard College, 1957), 54, argues, “Keppler had severed his formal ties with [the Catholic church] upon his ar- rival in this country.” West, Satire on Stone, 118, concurs. Roger Fischer, Damned Pictures, 30, disagrees but does not cite any evidence. 25. There was heavy press coverage of the Roman Question during Leo’s pontificate. See, for example, the mugwump Nation, October 24, 1878, 251–52; August 11, 1881, 112; October 11, 1883, 303; November 17, 1887, 390– 91; January 12, 1888, 23; September 20, 1888, 223; and July 2, 1896, 7. See, too, John Courtney Murray, S.J., “Leo XIII on Church and State: The General Structure of the Controversy,” Theological Studies 14 (1953): 1, and Thomas, “Church-State Pronouncements.” 26. Leo’s stand on the Roman Question is familiar to church histori- ans. He dutifully continued Pius’s protest of the loss of temporal power but often in terms that seemed no more than pro forma. Indeed, scholars have long known that he never expected full restoration, just sovereignty over Vatican City. See, for example, the essay by S. William Halperin, “Leo XIII and the Roman Question,” in Leo XIII and the Modern World, ed. Edward Gargan (New York: Sheed and Ward, 1961), 101–24. Among the pope’s encyclicals that em- phasized the importance of restoring his temporal power were: Inscrutabili Dei Consilio (1878); Etsi Nos (1882); Superiori Anno (1884); Dall’alto dell Apos- tolico Seggio (1890); Inimica Vis (1892). There is a brief synopsis of each in Sister Mary Claudia Carlen, Dictionary of Papal Pronouncements: Leo XIII to Pius XII (New York: P. J. Kennedy, 1958). In its Editorial, April 12, 1882, and on the basis of its reading of the actions taken at the Catholic bishops’ Fourth Provin- cial Council of Cincinnati, Puck, for the first time, declared what it had long believed, that “a good Roman Catholic cannot be a good American citizen.” See the accompanying cartoon, “The Declaration of Dependence,” April 12, 1882. 27. Pope Leo XIII, Immortali Dei, in The Church Speaks to the Modern World: The Social Teachings of Leo XIII, ed. Etienne Gilson (New York: Signet, 1954), 161–84. The anti-Catholic legislation began in 1870 under German Chancellor Otto von Bismark and culminated in “May Laws” of 1873. The re- sult was popularly and somewhat euphemistically referred to as the Kultur- kampf or conflict of cultures (that is, between the German Empire and the Catholic church). 28. Although directed primarily to its middle-class readership, the cartoons of Puck enabled the magazine also to spread mugwumpism to the masses. Indeed, Keppler condescendingly believed that the education of “unreasoning though honest” workingmen, so many of whom were dependent </page> <page sequence="34"> 246 Religion and American Culture on the patronage of the machine, was prerequisite to the transformation of political life. The first to document Puck’s role as a popularizer of mugwump ideology was Virginia graduate student Daniel Backer, whose Master’s thesis, “Uniting Mugwumps and the Masses: Puck’s Role in Gilded Age Politics” (1996), may be accessed on-line at http://xroads.virginia.edu/~MA96/PUCK/ clphn.html. 29. Editorial, “The Pope’s Letter,” New York Times, November 26, 1885, 4; G. S. Baker, “The Aggressions of the Pope,” reprinted from the Churchman in Public Opinion, February 19, 1886, 411. In Editorial, Puck, No- vember 18, 1885, Bunner makes one of his frequent dismissive remarks that most Americans do not “really fear that the Government . . . will ever fall into the hands of the . . . Church,” but the magazine’s cavalier editorial attitude al- most always understates the fear and anxiety about just such a possibility that its cartoons imply. 30. Editorial, “To Leo XIII,” Harpers Weekly, June 25, 1887, 458; Edito- rial, “The Pope and Politics,” New York Times, February 11, 1890, 4; “The Out- look,” Christian Union, April 3, 1890, 475. The influential Christian Union went further when it inferred that the papal letter would encourage priests and bishops to tell Catholics how to vote. Thomas, “Church-State Pronounce- ments,” 26–28. 31. See, for example, Editorial, Puck, May 9, 1883; and Editorial, Puck, December 12, 1894. To emphasize the parallels between the church and the hall, Puck published several cartoons depicting machine politicians dressed as Catholic clerics or mockingly pictured as saints in its attempts to link, at least structurally, the church with corrupt politics. For an example of the former, see “The American Sixtus the Fifth,” May 18, 1881; for the latter, see “The Westminster Abbey of New York—A Suitable Burying Place for Gotham’s Heroes,” March 21, 1883. 32. Leo XIII, Libertas, in Church Speaks, ed. Gilson., 57–82, esp. par. 21. 33. See, for example, Editorial, “The Latest Encyclical,” Independent, August 2, 1888, 12. In Leo XIII, Libertas, paragraphs 26, 29, 32, 39, 41, and 44 may easily be and probably were taken out of context and interpreted to mean, as one writer put it, that “the state must accept its truths from Rome and must root out anti-Catholic activity.” J. Burton, “The Present Purposes of Papal Quebec,” Our Day 3 (June 1889): 541. 34. Fischer, Damned Pictures, 74–75, points to the influence of the En- glish humor periodical Punch as the source of Keppler’s (and Nast’s) mon- key imagery of the Irishman. Both were reacting to the Irishman’s alleged threat to “hallowed Anglo-American verities and social institutions.” For an </page> <page sequence="35"> Mugwump Cartoonists, the Papacy, and Tammany Hall 247 analogous cartoon of the Irish/Tammany as a political threat to the country, see “They All Do It—Cringing Before the Irish Vote and Support,” Puck, April 3, 1889. 35. Editorial, July 24, 1889. It is curious that Bunner blasted Harri- son and used his broken campaign promise as a way of warning its readers never to trust similar promises by a future Roman Catholic candidate. Besides Puck’s disappointment over Cleveland’s unsuccessful bid for a second term, it is possible that the editor knew of Archbishop John Ireland’s friendship with the new president. See Marvin R. O’Connell, John Ireland and the American Catholic Church (St. Paul: Minnesota Historical Society Press, 1988), 395–96. Ireland was also close friends with subsequent presidents William McKinley and Theodore Roosevelt. 36. Editorial, “The Pope and Politics,” New York Times, February 11, 1890, 4. 37. Notable papal interventions, besides those treated in this essay, included Leo’s toleration of Catholic membership in the American Knights of Labor in 1886; his excommunication of Father Edward McGlynn for insubor- dination in 1887; his rejection of a formal proposal in 1891 to form more par- ishes based on nationality; his approval of a Catholic university in Washing- ton, D.C.; and his directives to build parochial schools for each parish. See Samuel J. Thomas, “The American Periodical Press and the Apostolic Letter, Testem Benevolentiae,” Catholic Historical Review 62 (July 1976): 408. Among the few papal actions that received qualified support in the secular and Protes- tant press was Leo’s approval of the excommunication (from 1887 to 1892) of the social activist priest the Reverend Edward McGlynn. The press inter- preted the excommunication for insubordination as a censure against the priest’s support of single-tax advocate Henry George, widely condemned at the time as in league with socialists. The best treatment of the McGlynn epi- sode is in Robert Emmett Curran, Michael Augustine Corrigan and the Shaping of Conservative Catholicism in America, 1878–1902 (New York: Arno Press, 1978). For Puck’s treatment of the McGlynn controversy, see Thomas, “Por- traits of a Rebel Priest.” 38. Reilly, School Controversy, is a solid analysis of this episode and has appendices that include both Ireland’s address and the pope’s letter. 39. The terms “liberal” or “Americanist” and “conservative” are problematic in most contexts, not least of all as a means of distinguishing the attitudes and outlooks of Catholic bishops in the United States at the turn of the nineteenth century. It will suffice here to define the liberals as suggested by historian Christopher Kauffman: Bishops such as James Gibbons of Balti- more, John Ireland of St. Paul, and John Keane of the Catholic University </page> <page sequence="36"> 248 Religion and American Culture were “transformationalists, since they believed that, as a result of the encoun- ter between Catholicism and American culture, both experienced a positive change,” while conservative bishops such as Michael Corrigan of New York, Frederick Katzer of Milwaukee, and Bernard McQuaid of Rochester were “preservationists reluctant to risk the integrity of the [Catholic] faith in a democratic, pluralist society.” Quoted in Turning toward the New Century: The Catholic Church’s Encounter with American Culture at the Turn of the Century, “America’s Bishops,” http://libraries.cua.edu/Archives/NewCent/htm. It is worth noting that liberals believed that they were not compromising the es- sential doctrinal and disciplinary components of their Catholicism by fully supporting the separation of church and state and the constitutional right to freedom of religion. Conservatives were not comfortable with that position and were far less ecumenically inclined than the liberals. One of the earliest and still best attempts to define both sides is Robert D. Cross, The Emergence of Liberal Catholicism in America (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1957). 40. The divide between minority Americanist bishops and the con- servative bishops had begun in the early 1880s and reemerged not long after the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in 1884. See Jay P. Dolan, The American Catholic Experience: A History From Colonial Times to the Present (New York: Doubleday, 1985), 312–13. 41. Americanist bishops tended also to be nationalists and hoped that their immigrant flocks would quickly assimilate. Thomas, “Testem Benevo- lentiae,” 408–9. David O’Brien, “Americanism,” in Glazier and Shelley, Catho- lic History, 97–98, and David O’Brien, The Renewal of American Catholicism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1972), 80–108, argues cogently that Leo’s own return, in 1895, to the defensive, conservative, traditionalist stance of Pius IX may have been motivated in large part by his conviction that it was the only way to prevent the disintegration in Protestantism from infecting the Catholic church. For a good general discussion of the liberal-conservative controversy and its attendant issues, see Dolan, American Catholic Experience, chap. 12, “Religion and Society,” and Jay P. Dolan, In Search of an American Catholicism: A History of Religion and Culture in Tension (New York: Oxford University Press, 2002), chap. 3, “In Search of an American Catholicism.” The United States did not establish formal diplomatic relations with the Vatican until 1983. 42.

Anti-Catholic papers and their spokesmen, in particular, had a field day with what they interpreted as the encyclical’s openness to an estab- lished church. See, for example, William Traynor, “The Menace of Roman- ism,” North American Review 161 (August 1895): 129–34; and “Leo XIII to the Church in the United States,” Christian Advocate 14 (February 1895): 99–100. More mainstream papers, however, were also critical. See Editorial Note, Na- tion, January 1895, 83; Editorial, “The Pope and the Bishops,” New York Times, January 29, 1895, 5; and Editorial, “The Recent Encyclical of Leo XIII,” Harper’s Weekly, March 9, 1895, 218.

Thomas, “Testem Benevolentiae,” 408–9. To their critics, the Amer- icanists, by placing more value on the guidance of the Spirit on the individ- ual, implicitly put less value on the external guidance provided by the magis- terium or direct teaching authority of the church, especially as expressed in papal pronouncements. 48.

Its prime targets, however, were not just corrupt machine politicians. The magazine included as well what it, like the letterpress, condemned as the nefarious political agenda of the Catholic church, especially its new pope, Leo XIII. Indeed, New York’s infa- mous Tammany Hall, committed to spoils and patronage as the means of dominating the body politic, was all the more dangerous to Puck because, beginning in the 1870s, Irish Catholics dominated it. The hall’s Irish Catho- lic base enabled the magazine to rationalize more completely its conviction that the Catholic church, ruled by a foreign potentate dressed in the irratio- nal garb of infallibility, was a menace not only to the nation’s body politic but also to its democratic soul. If allowed to proceed unimpeded, the pope and his minions, along with Tammany’s bosses and supporters, would con- vert the nation into their personal fiefdom. Puck was not about to let that happen. In cartoons and editorials spanning two decades, the magazine blasted and often conjoined both Tammany and the papacy with invidious comparisons that left few readers in doubt as to their complicity. Although scholars have noted how the American letterpress also alluded to a connec- tion between Tammany and the Catholic church, Puck’s unparalleled com- prehensive strategy to perpetuate and strengthen that connection has never been scrutinized. This essay redresses that oversight of an age when the public and its politicians reckoned very seriously the editorial artistry of great political cartoonists, especially those who drew for Puck. </page> </plain_text>
