Lambert McKenna's edition of the poem, which was published in Ddnta do chum Aonghus Fionn 0 Ddlaigh (1919), was based on a single eighteenth-century manuscript, in which the poem was attributed to'6 Dilaigh Fionn' and which provided an incomplete and corrupt text. Further manuscripts containing the poem have since come to light. They provide a better text and suggest that Tadhg Og 6 hUiginn was the author. The commentary pays particular attention to the apologue of the blood-spotted hand contained in the poem. A version of this apologue is contained in the late medieval collection Gesta Romanorum and seems to have provided the inspiration for Shakespeare's characterization of Lady Macbeth in the sleep-walking scene in Macbeth. INTRODUCTION In his edition of poems attributed to Aonghus Fionn 0 Dailaigh, Ddnta do chum Aonghus Fionn 0 Ddlaigh, published in 1919, Lambert McKenna, S.J., included as no. 51 a poem of repentance, 'Miiin aithrighe dhamh a Dh6' (McKenna 1919, 65-8).1 His edition is based on the text of a single manuscript, TCD MS 1356 (pp 266-8; hereafter T). This text was written in 1727-8 by a scribe of the 6 Neachtain circle in Dublin, Stiabhna Righis (O'Rahilly 1912-13, 160-2, 302-3; Abbott and Gwynn 1921, 180-4), by whom the poem, consisting of 30 quatrains, was attributed to '6 D ilaigh Fionn'. Two other eighteenth-century manuscripts contain very similar versions of the poem, each also consisting of 30 quatrains: Maynooth MS B9 (pp 6-8; hereafter M), written by Tadhg 0 Neachtain between February 1716/7 and November 1717 (6 Fiannachta 1967, 130-3); and NLI MS G140 (pp 274-7; hereafter N), written by Matha 0 Troidhthe in the period 1724-40 (Ni Sh6aghdha 1977, 88-97). Though these two latter manuscripts came from the same milieu as T,2 like it attribute the poem to 6 Dalaigh Fionn, and provide versions of the poem which bear 1 McKenna had published virtually the entire text of this book in monthly instalments, beginning in January 1917, in the Irish Monthly 45-6 (McKenna 1917-18; 1918c); indeed it seems clear that the texts and translations of all the poems and most of the introduction in the book were reprinted from the plates of the instalments in the Irish Monthly, some relatively minor corrections and emendations having been made to the texts and translations. 'M6iin aithrighe dhamh a Dh6' appeared in the numbers of the journal for July and August 1918 (McKenna 1918b). References here are to the edition of the poem printed in the book. 2 The fact that another member of the 6 Neachtain school, Risteard Thib6ar, penned some lines of verse on p. 591 of N would suggest that Matha 6 Troidhthe too, or at least this manuscript, had some connection with the O Neachtain circle.

While the copies in T and M are quite similar to each other, I do not believe that T is directly derived from M. All three lack qq 28, 32 and 33 of the version printed below, and in all three qq 29 and 30 have been corrupted. McKenna was aware that the text of the poem in T was defective: he found it necessary to make a number of significant emendations; he noted the similarity between lines 28b and 29b of his edition and suggested (correctly) that one was probably a mistake; and he indicated with the words 'cet[era] desunt' (the remaining [quatrains] are wanting) that the poem was incomplete, presumably because it lacked a danadh. Ultimately, however, the corrupt state of the last part of the text of the poem in T defeated McKenna's best efforts. Fortunately, in addition to the copies in M and N, which suffer from the same defects as that in T, two earlier manuscripts containing three copies of the poem are now known to exist and provide the basis for a much more satisfactory text. They are Maynooth MS C97 (hereafter C) and the Book of the O'Conor Don (hereafter B).3 Padraig 6 Fiannachta has described C as 'merely a collection of seven frail leaves, most of which are badly torn or damaged' (0 Fiannachta 1969a, 118) and has suggested, in view of the style of the handwriting, that the folio on which this poem occurs (2v) was written in the last quarter of the sixteenth century (0 Fiannachta 1969b, 46). Owing to wearing of the outer edge of the folio, this copy of the poem suffered loss of text at the beginning of the first line of all but four of the 31 quatrains of its text. The well-known and important manuscript B was written by Aodh 0 Dochartaigh for Captain Somhairle Mac Domhnaill at Ostend in 1631 (Hyde 1916, 78-9; Murphy 1953, x). It contains two copies of the poem: a shorter one (hereafter Bl), which breaks off at quatrain 29, on folios 10v- 1 1v; and a longer one (hereafter B2), which consists of 33 quatrains, on folios 50r-51r. There is a significant number of duplicates in the manuscript- eleven in all4--six of which occur in the same order on folios 1r-11v and on folios 43r-51r, with 'Mtiin aithrighe dhamh, a DhC' as the last poem in each group.Though, due to work done in conserving the manuscript, the structure of the gathering of which folios 1-11 formed a part is not now clear, there can be little doubt that it originally formed a discrete entity, for though the hand throughout is that of Aodh 0 Dochartaigh, the writing on folios 1-11 3 Douglas Hyde had published a catalogue of the first lines of poems (including 'M6iin aithrighe dhamh a DhC') in the Book of the O'Conor Don in 1916 (Hyde 1916), so that at first sight it seems strange that McKenna did not consult that manuscript when preparing his edition of this poem. However, it would appear that when he began his series of instalments in the Irish Monthly in January 1917, he had already collected all the material for his edition of the poems of Aonghus 6 DAlaigh, in all likelihood before Hyde's catalogue appeared in print. 4Though Hyde states that of the 342 surviving poems in B 'five or six are duplicates' (Hyde 1916, 78), his index of first lines enumerates eleven duplicates: nos 88, 185, 188, 189, 212, 216, 226,233,237,263,287 (Hyde 1916, 81-95).</page><page sequence="3">MLIN AITHRIGHE DHAMH, A DHE REVISED 105 is larger than that on folios 12ff, and the spacing between the lines on folios 1-11 is more generous than that on folios 43-51. This would suggest that folios 1-11 were not written at the same time as folios 12ff nor as folios 43-51, and it seems likely to me that the scribe, in making the two copies of the group of six poems, intended each to form part of a separate duanaire, but that both were inadvertently retained in the collection which eventually came to be known as the Book of the O'Conor Don. Since B1 breaks off at the foot of folio 11v, it seems clear that the loss of the final four quatrains in that copy is due to the loss of a folio. Other defects in B1, notably loss of words at the beginning of q. 8a and c and at the end of q. 19b, are due to wearing of the margins of folio 11. Either B1 or B2 could thus be a copy of the other, or both may be copies of a common exemplar, any small differences in the two texts of the first 29 quatrains being readily explainable as being due to scribal omission or correction. The three eighteenth-century manuscripts ascribe the poem to 0 Dalaigh Fionn, whom McKenna identified as Aonghus 0 Dalaigh, who he believed 'lived at the end of the sixteenth century', having been born 'as far back as 1548', and having died 'well into the seventeenth century' (McKenna 1919, v, vii).5 C has no ascription. In B1 and B2, however, the poem is ascribed to Tadhg Og 6 hUiginn. The tendency of eighteenth-century scribes to attribute bardic religious verse to Aonghus Fionn or to 0 DAlaigh Fionn would in any case suggest that such attributions should be treated with a certain scepticism, whereas the attributions in B in the earlier seventeenth century to Tadhg Og 0 hUiginn deserve to be treated with greater respect. Tadhg Og, son of Tadhg M6r, son of Giolla Coluim 0 hUiginn, died in 1448 at Ceall Connla, Co. Galway, and was buried in the monastery of Ath Leathan (McKenna [1922], vii). This poem is somewhat unusual in that, though it begins with the poet making a personal plea to God, continues in that vein as far as q. 8 and returns to it towards the end (qq 27-33), the references to three exemplary stories about Mary Magdalen, St Peter and the 'blind' centurion (qq 10-12), and the narration of an apologue (qq 13-25), introduce a public dimension to the poem. The poet points out (q. 9) that he can say to God that he has many stories to tell which would cause himself to weep tears (of repentance). Since it would seem strange for a person to tell stories to himself rather than to an audience, at this point in the poem the poet seems to have changed from making a personal statement addressed to God to adopting a teaching role in which he illustrates the importance of tears of repentance to an audience which might be either one person, such as the 5 Cuthbert McGrath warned, however, that this opinion 'is based mainly on two assumptions: (1) that the MSS headings are authentic and (2) that they all-Fr. McKenna summarizes them as "Aonghus Fionn" and "0 Dailaigh Fionn"-refer to the same poet' (McGrath 1945-7, 185). McKenna's belief that the document which he took to provide evidence for the time of Aonghus's birth referred to Aonghus was characterized by T.F. O'Rahilly (1922b, 90) as 'very rash'.</page><page sequence="4">106 CATHAL 0 HAINLE poet's patron, or all those who might hear or read the poem.6 Indeed, the poem follows the normal structure of bardic public didacticism: the theme is introduced in the opening quatrains and is illustrated in the apologue(s), and the moral is drawn out in the closing section. In this poem, while the theme is repentance, particular emphasis is laid on the importance of tears of repentance (qq 8, 9, 10,7 11, 22-4, 26). The three incidents that are referred to in brief all relate to the life of Jesus and are well known (see textual notes below). The apologue, which is related in extenso, is a version of a story found in a number of medieval sources (0 Caithnia 1984, 196). It would seem to consist of two elements which were originally separate: (a) a woman commits incest with her son, strangles the child that is born and conceals the sins until forced to confess (e.g. Ward 1883-93, vol. 2, 627); and (b) a woman commits an unspecified sin, which she fails to confess: having seen Christ in a dream, who asks her to put her hand into his pierced side and tells her to confess her sin, her hand is stained with blood, which repeated washing cannot remove, so that she is forced to confess the sin. When she does so, 'anone the blode was a-waye from here hande' (Herrtage 1879, 393).8 I believe that these two elements were subsequently conflated into one story (c), which must have been originally somewhat as follows: a woman commits incest with her son and murders the child that is born by cutting its throat with a knife. The child's blood adheres to the mother's hand and repeated washing cannot remove it, so that it provides the evidence of her guilt and leads to her being forced to confess. The blood then disappears from her hand. Gesta Romanorum, which was apparently originally compiled in England in the fourteenth century, is one of the great medieval Latin collections of exempla (apologues or homiletic tales). A version of it published by Henry Gran at Hagenau in 1508 (English translation by Swan 1905) and Hermann Oesterley's edition of 1872 both contain a version (d) of the conflated story (c), which is greatly embellished by the addition of two motifs which were presumably intended to make the story more sophisticated as a narrative (Swan 1905, 97-9; Oesterley 1872, 291-4; see appendix below). It may be that this development is in line with a trend which, it has been suggested, is evident in the history of the use of apologues: [Bhi] claochli ag teacht ar disaid na hapal6ige n6 na heiseamlAra, 6n 13ti haois amach. San ch6ad mh6rchnuasach d'eiseamlhairf, an Speculum 6 It is worth noticing that though Fearghal Og Mac an Bhaird opened his poem 'Mairg nach doirteann a dh6ara' (Mac Cionnaith 1938, no. 39) with a general statement (q. 1), which is quite unlike Tadhg Og's opening personal plea 'Majin aithrighe dhamh, a Dh6', he went on, having given accounts of the experience of St Peter (qq 7-8), Mary Magdalen (qq 9-11) and the centurion 'Longfonus' (q. 12), together with that of St Paul (qq 2-6), as evidence for the efficacy of tears of repentence, to express the hope that he himself would repent with tears (qq 14ff). I There is no specific reference to tears in this quatrain, but they are implied, since the woman who washed Christ's feet did so with her tears according to the Gospel narrative to which reference is made here. (See further the textual note on this quatrain, below.) 8 I am grateful to Dr John McKinnell of the Department of English, University of Durham, for providing me with a copy of Herrtage's edition of the text which is summarized as (b).</page><page sequence="5">MI1N AITHRIGHE DHAMH, A DHE REVISED 107 Sapientiae, is ar an gceacht-sapientia!--de bhreis ar an sc6al f6in a bhiti ag diriti.

(0 Caithnia 1984, 16).9 The first additional motif involves the unlikely intervention of the Blessed Virgin Mary, which is quite awkwardly rationalized on the basis that, though the guilty woman in regularly confessing her sins concealed the sins of incest and murder, she nevertheless is described as having been very devoted to the Virgin Mary and having distributed great alms for love of her. Consequently, the Virgin Mary appears to the woman's confessor, tells him that the woman is concealing the sin of murder and instructs him to force her to confess the sin. The woman confesses, not of her own free will, but being forced to do so when the evidence of her guilt is laid bare. Though the title of the story in Gesta Romanorum, 'De amore inordinato' (Oesterley 1872, 291), indicates that its focus is on the dangers of excessive love and not on repentance, one cannot fail to be surprised at the very confused understanding of the nature of true repentance which the miraculous intervention and its consequences convey. The second additional motif is highly contrived too. The bloodstains on the woman's hand are in the form of circles. Since they cannot be removed, the woman conceals them by wearing a glove, which she refuses to take off when her confessor demands that she do so. When he forcibly pulls it off, writing is revealed within the four bloody circles on her hand: in each circle there are four identical letters, Cs, Ds, Ns and Rs, and around the circumference of each circle are four words beginning with the same letters, which reveal the woman's guilt. The writing in the circles is not referred to until the point in the story when the glove is removed and the writing is revealed, neither is any mention made at the end of the story of the removal from the woman's hand of the bloodstains, though this might have been expected and is implied by the explication in words of the four Rs: ' My translation: 'From the thirteenth century the use of the apologue or exemplum was being transformed. In the first great collection of exempla, the Speculum sapientiae, attention was paid to the lesson-sapientia!-rather than to the story. Then in the fourteenth century the Dialogus creaturarum was collected, and more attention was directed to the drift of the story, though the lesson was not yet eliminated entirely. When the Gesta Romanorum was gathered, however, at some later time (which is uncertain), the narrator's interest was in the story alone, almost to the exclusion of the lesson.' It is, however, important to be aware that the early history of Gesta Romanorum is only imperfectly understood (Owst 1926, 300) and that it existed in various Latin and English versions, and to note, with reference to the apologue with which we are concerned here, that, while the more developed version of the story (d) is found in fourteenth-century Latin versions of the collection, the story summarized as (b) above is found in an English version of the collection made 'about the year 1440' (Owst 1926, 302). Though this witness to (b) is late, the fact that the medieval collections of exempla were compiled from earlier sources means that (b) was most likely in existence at an earlier date and that a conflated version, such as (c), could also have come into existence prior to the fourteenth century.</page><page sequence="6">108 CATHAL 0 HAINLE Recedet Rubigo Regina Rogata 'The queen having been interrogated, the stain disappears'. From this it seems clear that this matter did not form part of the original story, but was added to it without being properly integrated into it. Furthermore, there is evidence in folk tradition for the separate existence of the motif of sets of identical letters and their explanation. In an anecdote about Dean Swift a boy writes four Ds on the Dean's door, which he then explains to the Dean as meaning '(The) Devil Double Damn Dane (Swift)' (Jarrell 1967, 321); while according to another version of the same anecdote collected by a pupil in Ballinahown National School, Co. Westmeath, in the late 1930s, and which is now preserved in MS S.745 of the Irish Folklore Commission's Schools Collection, five Ds were written on the gate of a farmer called Denis Daly who was disliked, and these were interpreted for him as meaning 'Devil Double Damn Denis Daly'.1o It is clear that the apologue in Tadhg Og 6 hUiginn's poem is based on a version of this story such as that outlined as (c) above. It could be supposed that Tadhg Og pruned the superfluous elements from the version of the story (d) which is found in the Latin Gesta Romanorum, but I regard this as unlikely, for apart from the fact that his version lacks the two additional motifs, it also differs from the Gesta Romanorum version in certain significant details. 0 hUiginn's apologue refers repeatedly to drops and spots of blood (qq 16b, 17ac, 18a, 25c) rather than to circles of blood: the circles are most likely a development of the simpler, more naturalistic motif, and were designed to accommodate the writing of letters and words. Instead of four circles 0 hUiginn's version refers to three drops (qq 16b, 25c): again the triad would appear to be the more primitive folkloristic form. Though it is stated in the Gesta Romanorum version of the story that the woman could not erase the circles of blood from her hand, repeated washing of the stained hand is not specifically mentioned; by contrast, 0 hUiginn's version of the story again and again mentions futile washing of the hand (qq 17-19, 24), and this is central to the moral purpose of his story, which is to emphasize the importance and value of true repentance: tears of repentance wash the guilt of the woman's sins from her heart and the bloodstains from her hand (q. 25).11 It is possible that 0 hUiginn created his own version of the story, though on the face of it this seems implausible, since he states that he obtained his story in a written source (q. 13c). Furthermore, Lady Macbeth's sleepwalking scene in Shakespeare's Macbeth (V.1) appears to provide independent evidence for the existence not only of such a story (Bullough 1973, 523-5; 0 Caithnia 1984, 196) but indeed of a version of it which agreed in important respects with 0 hUiginn's narrative. Lady Macbeth does not commit incest 10 MS S.745, 59, has 'Dible' for 'Devil'. As in the case of the Swift anecdote, it would appear that it was the same person, a poor scholar, who wrote the letters and interpreted them for Denis Daly, though this is somewhat unclear in the anecdote as recorded. The irony is underlined by Daly's promising to pay to have the letters explained and in fact doing so. " A further difference of detail is that in the Gesta Romanorum version of the story the circles of blood are on the woman's left hand, whereas in Tadhg Og 0 hUiginn's version the drops of blood are on her right hand (q. 16a).</page><page sequence="7">MUINAITHRIGHE DHAMH, A DHE REVISED 109 nor kill her own child, but she certainly is implicated, as an accessory both before and after the fact, in the bloody murder of Duncan, and her guilt so infects her mind that she begins to sleepwalk, to relive the night of the murder (11.2) in her dreams and repeatedly to attempt to 'wash' her hands clean of blood.12 Shakespeare's dramatic text insists that her problem is a moral one rather than a medical one and that she needs, as the doctor says, not a doctor but a priest ('This disease is beyond my practice...More needs she the divine than the physician' (V:1)). Repentance and confession to a priest are required to obtain forgiveness and peace of mind, as is the case in the Gesta Romanorum version of the apologue and in 0 hUiginn's. But like 0 hUiginn's version, and unlike the Gesta Romanorum one, there is no preternatural intervention in the sleepwalking scene, though preternatural intervention occurs frequently elsewhere in Macbeth, and there is no mention of circles of blood nor of letters or words being visible on Lady Macbeth's hands. Furthermore, as in 0 hUiginn's version, Lady Macbeth, as already mentioned, repeatedly tries to wash away the blood from her hands. It would seem that Shakespeare may have found inspiration for his portrayal of Lady Macbeth's agony of conscience in a version of the apologue such as that outlined as (c) above, rather than in the much more complex narrative ((d) above, and see appendix below) which was the version that Bullough (1973, 523) suggested provided an analogue to Shakespeare's text, and it would also seem that it was from a similar version that Tadhg Og 0 hUiginn drew the eisiomldir in his poem. TEXT13 If the text of the poem in C is indeed to be dated to the last quarter of the sixteenth century, as suggested by 0 Fiannachta, it is the oldest text available. Unfortunately, not only does C lack two complete quatrains (16 and 28) but it also has suffered significant further loss of text, as already mentioned. Hence it was thought preferable to base this edition on B2, which is perhaps fifty years later than C but is a complete text in the excellent hand of Aodh 0 Dochartaigh; in addition, it is supported by another incomplete copy (B1) from the same hand. Though several variants-such as q. 5b: B1 'da ccaithiomh', B2 'da ccaithimh', C 'do cathaigh'; q. 7a: B1 &amp;2 'ni folhir',14 C 'nir bhfolair; q. 8d: B1&amp;2 'nd6anam', 12 That Lady Macbeth in her dreams cannot erase the blood is deeply ironic in view of her statement immediately after the murder: 'A little water clears us of this deed. How easy is it then!' (11:2). 13 My warm thanks are due to my colleagues, Professor Damian McManus and Dr Eoin Mac Carthaigh, who read a draft of this essay and suggested several improvements. I am extremely grateful to Mr Pyers O'Conor-Nash for granting me permission to use the two copies of the poem in The Book of the O'Conor Don as the basis for this edition, and to Mrs Marguerite O'Conor-Nash for receiving me most kindly when I visited Clonalis House to transcribe those two copies. I am also most grateful to Ms Penny Woods of Maynooth College Library, to the staff of the Manuscripts Department in the Library of Trinity College Dublin, and to the staff of the National Library of Ireland for making manuscripts in their collections available for inspection. 14 Alliteration is lacking in this version of the line.</page><page sequence="8">110 CATHAL 0 HAINLE C 'ndortadh'; q. 9d: BI&amp;2 'do sg6alaibh', C 'arsgealaibh'; q. 27a: BI&amp;2 'athoidh', C 'tamall'-make it highly unlikely that the texts in B are derived from that in C, the text of B] and B2 is nevertheless quite similar to that of C.

You ought to have my single heart as compensation from me for your five hearts, which saved your race in one day, being bathed in blood. 8. You shed many a drop of the blood of your body to protect me. It would be a shame if I did not shed the tears of my eyes in return for that. 9. It may be said to God the Father [that] I have many an apologue about God and his poor in view of which I ought to shed tears. 10. In confirmation of that, when, one day, Mary Magdalene washed the feet of God, her sin was completely cleared away by the Righteous One. 11. Peter the Apostle in his presence denied him to the Jews. His tears protected him after having denied the King of heaven. 12. Though the blind man pierced the good heart of the King, the Son of God accepted repentance for the bad deed from him-what mercy!-after his heart had been pierced. 13. I have another noble story about repentance. I shall tell the story as the pen wrote [it], if what it says be true. 14. Long ago a son got his mother with child secretly. She kept secret the pregnancy [which] was no benefit to her. 15. For fear that the crime would be punished, the child's throat is cut by her-awful misfortune!-the day that she gave birth to it, though that woman's behaviour was unnatural for a woman. 12d: C an doll, N an doill; 13d: BI&amp;2,M,N,T fior, C fhior; C dha fuideall, M,T re/r6 a fuighioll/fuigheall 14a: B1 foluidh, B2 foluigh, M,N faluigh; b: BI&amp;2 do righne, C do rinne; B1 16 a, B2 le a, C re a, M,N,T ria a; 15a: Bl&amp;2 Gearrtar, M,N,T Gearrthar; d: M,N,T gi/ge/giodh nir cheird;</page><page sequence="12">114 CATHAL 0 HAINLE 16.

Three drops of the child's life-blood adhered to her right hand that day-what a dreadful disgrace! It was fitting [for her] to be startled by the drops [of blood]. 17. To remove the drops of blood she washed the slender topped hand. But though she washed her hand, no spot of the blood was removed. 18. The red spots remained on it despite each washing. Not surprisingly the woman became weary of that washing. 19. After a time when she understood one day after washing that the King of heaven was her enemy, sadness entered her heart. 20. With sadness of heart the woman recounted in her confession how she had had her sexual pleasure that day, so that she entered into God's grace. 21. In the church she tells in sequence, though it was difficult for her, how [the child] was born to a man who was an unlawful lover and her crime with regard to the child. 22. As a result of those two sins-it was a sign of faith-tears of repentance pour from the woman['s eyes] at her confession. [It was] more fruitful than to deny them. 23. She raised the [blood-]marked hand to wipe the tears from her eyes. With the tears that fell from her eyelash[es] she cleared away the stain. 24.

The normal meaning of sitheamh,'an onrush, an attack', does not appear to be appropriate here nor in the only other instance of the phrase 'ni trith sithimh' of which I am aware, namely, 'Don Tailcenn ni trath sithimh / dai fobradh ar f6irithin'. This latter is q. 13ab of a poem,'Olc chuimhnighim mo chumann' (Fraser et al. 1931, 78-81), which, like 'Mtiin aithrighe dhamh, a Dh6', is attributed to Tadhg Og 0 hUiginn. The earliest copy of 'Olc chuimhnighim mo chumann', which is in B.Mus. MS Rawlinson B 514 (probably of the sixteenth century), is unattributed (Fraser et al. 1931, 78) but is the second of a pair of poems on the captivity of Niall Garbh 0 Domhnaill between 1434 and 1439 (McKenna 1939, 87), the first of which immediately preceding it in the manuscript is attributed to Tadhg Og. In the eighteenth-century manuscript, NLI G 167, 'Olc chuimhnighim mo chumann' is attributed to Tadhg Og (Nif Sh6aghdha 1979, 10). DIL suggests that sithem is a by-form of side, sithe, (a) 'a blast or gust (of wind)', (b) hence 'rush, violent onset, swoop (of a bird), spring (of an animal)'. While the normal meaning of side, then, is 'an onrush, an attack', in at least one instance it means 'a spring from':'...Crfosd... / tug sidhe a hucht an Athar' (Mac Cionnaith 1938,66, no. 23:5bc), and it may be presumed that sithem may have the same meaning. Thus the phrase 'ni trith sithimh' would be synonymous with 'ni trith teichidh/teichmhe', 'it is not a time to flee, run away' (see Mac Cionnaith 1938, 32, no. 10:17d; McKenna 1918a, 126, no. 14: l1c). Consequently, I suggest that the sense here is 'it is not a time to dash off in order to avoid what needs to be done' and therefore 'it is not a time to shirk'. The reading of T (and of M) is 'uithim', in place of which McKenna (1919, 65) offered 'dithimh', referring (p. 83) to K[uno] M[eyer] (i.e. Meyer 1906). However, Meyer's entry is dithim, translated as 'delay' with a reference to Laws, vol. 1, 262.25, and McKenna's form metris gratia (: mithigh) ignores the fact that Meyer's entry is, of course, nom. sg., that the -i- of the first syllable is long and that the final -m is unaspirated. Consequently, DIL ?dithim, based on McKenna's restoration, is a ghost-word. 3a: It is clear (see manuscript readings above) that this line posed a difficulty for the scribes: ndi in B &amp;2 should read ind, which results in the line being a syllable too long. The readings of M and N are unintelligible, and that of T (on which McKenna's version is based), taken in conjunction with line b, does not make good sense. The solution to the difficulty of the syllable count offerred here is to adopt the alternative reading aniud for aniugh of B1 &amp;2. However, another solution would be to follow the (clearly corrupt) reading offered by M and N and omit As at the beginning of the line and retain the spelling aniugh of B1 &amp;2. 3c: Tdoes not support McKenna's reading,'crann crfona'.All manuscripts agree in having 'dfona'. cd are a version of the proverb 'Nuair a chruann an tslat, is deacair f a shnfomh' (see O'Rahilly 1922a, 111-2).</page><page sequence="17">MOIINAITHRIGHE DHAMH, A DHJI REVISED 119 5b: The sense of the reading in Bl &amp;2, 'da ccaithiomh/ccaithimh uile ataighidh', is not apparent, and uncertainty in this regard is reflected in the variety of readings in the other manuscripts: C 'do cathaigh', M,N 'do caitheamh', T 'do caitheadh'. Confusion may have been caused by the existence of the verbal noun nominative forms 'caitheamh', '-imh' and '-eadh' and the identity between the latter and that of the past subjunctive ending in '-eadh'. I have made the minimum alteration by replacing the readings of BI &amp;2 with 'gcaitheadh'. 5c: 't6arn~': for the translation 'escaped and got to heaven' see DIL s.v. do-trni (c). 7c: 'do ch6ig cridhe': The five hearts are the five wounds suffered by Christ at his Passion: those in his two palms, in his two feet and in his side. A poem attributed to Aonghus 0 DAlaigh (McKenna 1919, no. 24) is entirely devoted to the five wounds. 8c: The form 'shon' is required to alliterate with 'shtil'. The possessive 'a' in this instance, then, does not refer to either of the feminine nouns 'd6ar' or 'fuil' as grammatical antecedent, but to the complete preceding statement of the action. 9c: 'deana[i]mh': all the manuscripts have 'd6anamh', which I have replaced with the alternative form in order to provide the required rhyme with 'sg6alaibh'. 10: In Lk. 7:36-50 the woman who washed Christ's feet with her tears and dried them with her hair and had her sins forgiven by him is not named. The tradition that she was Mary Magdalen arose no doubt from the fact that Mary is referred to in the section of Luke's Gospel (8:2) which immediately follows his report of the aforementioned incident. This tradition is rejected, however, by modern biblical scholarship: 'The unnamed penitent woman... is...to be distinguished from...Mary Magdalene' (Hartdegen 1958, 57; see also Jerusalem Bible 1966, note on Lk. 7:37). 11: See Mt. 26:69-75, Mk. 14:66-72 and Lk. 22:56-62. Jn. 18-27 does not refer to Peter's tears of regret. c: I have chosen C's version of this line in preference to those of B1 and B2, as the variety of readings in the MSS betrays uncertainty about the sense of the line, and C seemed to offer the best solution. 12: Jn. 19:34.'In all references to the Passion...in...Bardic poems, a very extraordinary prominence is given to the Centurion who pierced Christ's side [after his death on the cross]. He is always mentioned as "the Blind Man".' (McKenna [1922], xvi). The tradition that the Roman soldier was physically blind, on the face of it highly unlikely,'probably had its origin in a misunderstanding of a metaphorical statement by some ancient writer, who merely meant to state that the material opening of Christ's side by the lance produced the spiritual effect of opening the eyes of the centurion to the light of faith' (Mac Erlean 1910, 24-5 n. 1). 13cd: As if acting as a precursor of the later story-telling tradition in which the 'sc6alai' disowned responsibity for the veracity of fictions with statements such as 'Sin 6 mo sg6al-sa. MA tA br6ag ann biodh! Ni mise chtim</page><page sequence="18">120 CATHAL 0 HAINLE na cheap 6' (6 Duilearga 1948, 58) and 'MA tA br6ag insa sc6al ni mise a rinne 6' (6 CeannabhAin 1983, 107), Tadhg Og 0 hUiginn insists that he is merely repeating a story as he found it and admits that it may not be 'true'. 21c: 'a bhreith d'fhior': cf. Tadhg Og 6 hUiginn, '...c6adrogha an chuaine / rug do righ na Craobhruaidhe', 'the choice one of the children which [Dearbhail] bore to the king of the Red Branch' (McKenna 1939, 49, no. 13.10ab). 22c: I have used C's 'ina a' here since in BI&amp;2 'tairthighe' seems to be unconnected. With regard to the use of 'tairtheach' in the context of penance, see Bergin (1931, 217): 'it' 'nar toil leis...an aithrighe do bheith toirtheach' (11. 6892-3, translating St Augustine's 'ubi voluit [Deus].. .poenitentiam esse fructuosam'. 23d: 'do chlaoi ar ceal': cf. 'smuain gan do chl6dh choidhche ar gctil', 'remember never to be driven back' (Mac Cionnaith 1938, 131, no. 42.24d), and 'ar gcionta do chl6dh', 'to blot out my sins' (McKenna 1919, 5, no. 5.4d). 28d: 'tig fim': cf. 'ni tingas ffiinn' (Mac Cionnaith 1938, 251, no. 79.8b), which the editor suggests (p. 614) means 'we were not attacked'. 29a: In BI&amp;2 this line is short a syllable. The beginning of the line is lacking in C, while the quatrain is corrupt in M, N and T. 29d:'eatal': the word can be used either together with the genitive of'grian' or alone to mean 'a burst, a ray of sunshine': see DIL s.v. 2 etal: 'eadrom is eatoil ghlana / muna n-iadhoinn m'aphradha / mar dhlaoi diona ar 16s an laoi / diogha dom ghr6s do-gh6ntaoi' (If I did not close my eyelids between me and the bright rays as a protecting veil against the daylight, it would ruin my artistry) (Bergin 1970, 119, 266, 27.10); 'eatal gr6ine geimhridh'. Thus, 'eatal ceatha' could also be expressed as 'eatal gr6ine ceatha' and would mean 'a burst of sunshine after a shower', just as Eochaidh 0 hEodhasa's 'gAire gr6ine ceatha' (McKenna 1939, 278, 73.23c) expresses the same meaning in a rather more anthropomorphic way. The use of the genitive 'ceatha' to express 'after a shower' is paralleled by Amhlaoibh 0 Sdilleabhdin's traditional phrase 'Earrach an deigh-Gheimhridh' (de Bhaldraithe 1970, 95.2987), 'in spring after a mild winter'. McKenna (1919, no. 51.28d) took 'eatal ceatha' to refer to Jesus's beauty. However, 'eatal (gr6ine)' has the same meaning as Modern Irish 'gealin/dealin (gr6ine)', a flash, a spell of sunshine (on a changeable day), as in the quatrain 'Samhailt a bheirim don tsaol / Sp6ir thaodach l1i earraigh, / 'S go dtig toil agus neamhthoil / Mar thig cith is dealan' (0 Grianna 1976, 3), and just as that quatrain refers to the impermanence of love, Tadhg Og 0 hUiginn may have intended to refer here to the impermanence of his love for Jesus or to the inconstancy of his will to resist evil-just as Eochaidh 0 hEodhasa's phrase 'gdire gr6ine ceatha' is a metaphor for the brief existence of the beauty of the world: 'cr6ad acht gdire gr6ine ceatha / tille sg6imhe an bheatha bhaoith'. Indeed, the inconstancy of his will is the theme of the four quatrains (28-31) of this section of Tadhg Og's poem. 30c:'na seacht bpeacaidh': the seven deadly sins, pride, covetousness, lust, anger, gluttony, envy and sloth.</page><page sequence="19">MUINAITHRIGHE DHAMH, A DHE REVISED 121 One would expect 'phian' rather than 'pian' here following the relative form of the copula. However, this would result in lack of alliteration in the line as ph- would not alliterate with bp- of 'bpeacaidh'. As the rule requiring aspiration is not universally observed (see McManus 1994, 358: 3.2 (g)), I have allowed the unaspirated form to stand and have translated accordingly. It would be possible to avoid the aspiration by taking the phrase 'as pian damh' to be a cheville, but I feel that this would result in a somewhat awkward turn of phrase. 31a: 'na dfiile da ndearnais m6': the four elements of fire, air, earth and water of which, in the classical view, all things were made. APPENDIX Since Swan's translation (Swan 1905, 97-9) of Gran's Latin text of the Gesta Romanorum version of the apologue 'De amore inordinato' is rather turgid, and Bullough's translation (Bullough 1973, 523-4) of Oesterley's Latin text is occasionally inaccurate, I offer here my own translation of Oesterley's text. It is followed by a section entitled 'Applicacio', in which two alternative interpretations of the apologue are offered. They are not translated here as they are not relevant to the present discussion. Inordinate love A certain Emperor had a beautiful wife whom he loved greatly. In the first year [of their marriage] she conceived and bore a son, of whom she was so fond that every night she slept in the same bed as he. When [the boy] was three years old, the king died, and his death was greatly lamented. The queen mourned him for many days; and after he had been buried she went to live alone in a certain castle, accompanied by her son whom she so loved that she could not bear to be parted from him. They both continued to share the same bed, until the boy was eighteen years old. When the devil saw the great attachment the mother and son had for each other, he tempted them to evil so greatly that the son had intercourse with his mother. The queen became pregnant, and, for grief, the son left the kingdom and went into distant parts. In due time the queen gave birth to a beautiful son; but as soon as she saw the child she murdered it by cutting its throat. Some blood from the child's throat fell upon the palm of the queen's left hand and four circles were made on it in this form: 0 0 O 0. By no means could the queen erase the circles from her hand. She was so ashamed of this that she always wore a glove on that hand for fear the circles of blood would be seen. She was very devoted to the Virgin Mary, but nevertheless was so ashamed of having conceived by her own son and of having killed her own son, that she could not confess what she had done even though every fortnight she confessed her other sins. She distributed great alms for love of the blessed Virgin Mary and was loved by all because she was kind to all.</page><page sequence="20">122 CATHAL 6 HAINLE It happened one night as her confessor, kneeling by his bed, was saying five Ave Marias, that the blessed Virgin appeared to him and said: 'I am the Virgin Mary and I have certain secrets to disclose to you.' The confessor was very pleased and answered: 'Oh! dear Lady, say to your servant what you please.' She replied: 'The queen of this kingdom confesses to you; but there is one sin she has committed which her great shame does not allow her to disclose. She will come to you tomorrow to confess. Tell her from me that her alms and her prayers have been presented to, and accepted by, my Son. I command her therefore to confess that sin which she secretly committed in her chamber when she killed her son. I have pleaded for her, and her sin is forgiven, if she will confess it. But if she pays no heed to your words, ask her to take the glove off her left hand and on her palm you will see the sin which she has committed but not confessed. If she will not do this, take off the glove by force.' When she had said this, the blessed Virgin disappeared. In the morning, the queen with great humility confessed all [her] sins with that one exception. After she had said all that she chose, the confessor said: 'My dear lady, many people say many things [about] why you constantly wear a glove on [your] left hand. Be brave and show me the hand so that I may see if it hides something displeasing to God.' The queen answered: 'Sir, my hand is diseased, and therefore I do not want to show it to you.' Hearing this, he caught hold of her by the arm, took off the glove against her will and said: 'Lady, do not be afraid! The blessed Virgin who loves you greatly has commanded me to do this.' When he saw the hand uncovered, he saw four circles of blood. In the first circle there were four Cs; in the second, four Ds; in the third, four Ms; and in the fourth, four Rs. On the outward edge of the circles, in the manner of a seal, there was red writing, containing the following: Casu Cecidisti Carne Cecata [Blinded by the flesh you have fallen]; Demoni Dedisti Dona Donata [You have given to the devil gifts [which were] given [to you]]; Monstrat Manifeste Manus Maculata [The stained hand clearly betrays [you]]; Recedit Rubigo Regina Rogata [The queen having been interrogated, the stain disappears]. When the queen saw this, she fell at the confessor's feet and tearfully confessed that sin which she had committed. She was then absolved and performed her penance, and a few days later she died. Her death was greatly lamented in the city. REFERENCES ABBorr,T.K. and GWYNN, E.J., 1921: Catalogue of the Irish manuscripts in the Library of Trinity College, Dublin. Dublin and London. BERGIN, O.
