<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL THE ERA OF SUBJECTIVISM. T)Y far the most important problem for philosophical, religious, U and moral consideration is the question as to the nature of evil. The intrinsic presence of suffering is the most obvious lea ture that determines the character of existence throughout, but gives at the same time origin to the most important blessings that make life worth living. It is pain that sets thoughts to thinking : a state of undisturbed happiness wou&gt;!d make reflexion, inquiry, and invention redundant. It is death which begets the aspiration of pre serving oneself beyond the grave. Without death there would be no religion. And it is sin that makes virtue a necessity. If there were no going astray, there would be no&gt; seeking for the right path ; there would be no merit in goodness. Blame and praise would have no sense. In the absence of wantr imperfection, and all kinds of ill, there would be no ideal, no progress,, no evolution to higher goals. Mythology being always a popular metaphysics, it is a matter of course that the idea of evil has been personified among all na tions. There is no religion in the world but has its evil spirit who represents pain, misery, and destruction. Buddhists call the per sonification of evil Mara, the tempter, the father of lust and sin, and the bringer of death. The Persians call him Angra Mainyu or Ahri man, the demon of darkness and of mischief, the Jews call him Sa tan the fiend, the early Christians, Devil (?id?oXos), i. e., slanderer, because, as in the story of Job, he accuses man, and his accusations are false. The old Teutons and Norsemen called him LokL The</page><page sequence="2">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 581 demonologies of the Japanese and Chinese are perhaps more exten sive than our own. The evolution of the idea of evil as a personification is one of the most fascinating chapters in history and it would be humorous if most of its pages (especially those on witch prosecution) were not at the same time very sad. The pedigree of the Evil One is older than the oldest European aristocracies and royal families ; it ante dates the Bible and is more ancient than the pyramids. We have treated chapters of it in outline in another place1 and shall not at tempt to recapitulate them, but limit ourselves to the philosophical consideration of the idea of evil ; and here we are first of all con fronted with the problem of the objective existence of evil. The question presents itself : " Is not evil the product of mere illusion ? Is it not a relative term which ought to be dropped as a one-sided conception of things? Does it not exist simply because we view life from our own subjective standpoint, and must it not disappear as soon as we learn to comprehend the world in its ob jective reality? " The tendency to regard evil as a purely negative term is at present very prevalent, for it agrees with the spirit of the times and is one of the most popular notions of to-day. In ancient times man was in the habit of objectifying the vari ous aspirations and impulses of his soul. In order to understand beauty the Greek mind fashioned the ideal of Aphrodite, and the moral authority of righteousness appeared to the Jew as Javeh the Lord, the Legislator of Mount Sinai. Religious aspirations were actualised in the Church by means of ceremonials and ecclesiastical institutions. Things changed at the opening of that era in the evolution of mankind (commonly called modern history) which was prepared through the inventions of gunpowder, the compass, and printing, and began at the end of the fifteenth century with the discovery of America, and the Reformation. The more the horizon of the known world grew, the more man began to comprehend the importance of his own subjectivity. The tendency of philosophy since Descartes 1See The Open Court, Nos. 421, 422, 424, 426-428, 430, 449, 450-453, 456-460.</page><page sequence="3">582 THE MONIST. and of religion since Luther, has been to concentrate everything in man's individual consciousness. That alone should have value which had become part of man's soul. Man's consciousness became his world, and thus, in religion, conscience began to be regarded as the ultimate basis of conduct. Men felt that religion should not be an external, but an internal factor. Toleration became a universal requirement, and subjectivity was made the cornerstone of public and private life. Thus the era of the Reformation showed itself as a revolutionary movement which, proclaiming the right of individ ualism and subjectivity, overthrew the traditional authority of an external objectivity. The originators of this movement did not intend to discard all objective authority, but the spirit of nominalism which dominated them prevailed over their movement in its further progress. The last consequences of the principle of subjectivity which starts with the famous assumption cogito ergo sum were not anticipated by Descar tes, for he naively assumes objective existence on one of the most trivial arguments. Nor would Luther with his peculiar education and stubborn narrowness which were by no means inconsistent ac companiments of his greatness, ever have endorsed later theories based upon the purely subjective aspect of conscience ; but the fact remains that the last consequence of the recognition of the suprem acy of the subjective principle is a denial of any objective authority in philosophy, politics, religion, and ethics, which leads in politics to anarchism, i. e., individualism pushed to its extreme; in philos ophy to agnosticism, i. e., the denial of any cognisable objectivity worked out most systematically in Kant's critical idealism. In ethics it is the refusal to recognise any objective authority in morals; which leads either to Bentham's ethical egotism and hedonism or to intuitionism. Our present civilisation is based upon the Protestant ideal of individualism, and nobody who lives and moves in our time can be blind to the enormous benefits which we derive from it. Neverthe less, we must beware of the onesidedness of subjectivism. Objec tivism is not so utterly erroneous in principle as it appears from the point of view of modern subjectivism. The external methods of</page><page sequence="4">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 583 the Roman Church are mistaken ; the tyranny of its hierarchical sys tem which substitutes the priest's authority and an infallible papacy for God's authority is radically wrong ; and the main task of Protes tantism consisted in protesting against this authority, which, in spite of its self-asserted catholicity, is based upon human authority of fallible mortals, an authority that was more frequently misused through bigotry and ignorance than from malice and selfishness. There are Protestants who might object that Protestantism is not merely negative ; it is also positive. It is not only a protest, but also an affirmation. True, indeed ! But most of the Protestant affirmations are simply relics of the old Romanism which bound the consciences of man and crippled his reasoning power. The fanatics among the Protestants are by no means friends of liberty and free inquiry ; and the positive power, the new factor in history that was destined to build up a new civilisation, was nothing else but science. Therefore, Protestantism is not as yet the last word spoken in the religious development of mankind. We must look to higher aims and more positive issues, and a new reformation of the Church will obtain them only on the condition of its again recognising the importance of objectivity. Mankind will not return to the dogmatic system of hierarchical institutions, which would only bind again the consciences of men by man-made authority, but the fact must be recognised that truth is not a mere subjective conception ; that truth is a statement of facts ; accordingly, that it contains an objective element, and that this objective element is the essential part of recognised truth. In the old period of objectivism, the ultimate authority rested with great men, prophets, reformers, and priests, whose spirit, after it had been adapted to the needs of the powerful, was embodied in Church institutions. The new objectivism discards all human authority; it rests ultimately upon science, which is an appeal to facts. Truth is no longer what the Church teaches, or some infall ible man may deem wise to proclaim, nor is it what appears to me as true, or to you as true ; but that which according to methodical critique is proved to be objectively true, so that everybody who in vestigates will find it so.</page><page sequence="5">5?4 THE MONIST. Objective truth, demonstrable by evidence and capable of re vision, or, in a word, science, is the highest, the most reliable and the most valuable revelation of God. God reveals himself in the facts of life, among which we include our afflictions and personal experiences, God speaks in our conscience, which is, as it were, the moral instinct, the result of all our inherited and acquired experi ences, and this is the reason why the voice of conscience makes itself heard in our soul with that automatic force which is characteristic of all deep-seated subconscious reactions. God also appears in our sentiments, our ideal aspirations, our devotions, our hopes and our yearnings. All these various manifestations are important and must not be lost sight of, but above them all is the objectivity of truth which speaks through science. It is impossible for all men to be scientists, but for that reason it is not necessary to enslave their minds and hearts by blind faith. The faith of every man should be the trust in truth, not in fairy tales that must be taken for granted, but in the truth,?the truth which in its main outlines is simple enough to be comprehensible by all,?the truth that this world of ours is a cosmic harmony in which no wrong can be done without producing evil effects all around. Faith in the objective authority of truth is the next step in the religious evolution of mankind. We stand now at the threshold of the third period which will be, to characterise it in a word, an era of scientific objectivism. The tendency of the second era was neg ative, revolutionising, theorising ; the tendency of the third will be positive, constructive, practical. Negativism and subjectivism appear from the standpoint of the positivism and objectivism of the first period as the work of the destroyer, of the negative spirit, the Devil. It is a reaction. This explains why Milton's Satan actually became a hero. Milton was a Protestant, a revolutionist, a subjectivist, and he uncon sciously sympathises with Satan, who in the terms of a philosopher of the age declares : ' ' The mind is its own place and in itself Can make a heaven of hell, a hell of heaven.</page><page sequence="6">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 585 What matter where, if / be still the same And what I should be." The negativism of the second period is not a mistake. It was an indispensable condition of the third period ; for it manufactured the tools for a higher and better positivism,?criticism. But crit icism is insufficient for positive construction ; we must have actual results, methodical work, and positive issues ; and the prophet of the twentieth century finds it necessary again to emphasise the im portance of objectivity. IS EVIL POSITIVE? After these preliminary remarks we shall be prepared to under stand why the tendency of subjectivism led to the proposition that evil is a mere negation, but no positive factor. And looking for the most characteristic representative of this view among the ablest authors of our time, we find a statement written by the well known author of the novel Ground Arms! Bertha von Suttner, one of the most prominent advocates of universal peace on earth. She knows as well as Schopenhauer that the ills of life are positive, for she describes all the horrors of war in their drastic reality. Never theless, Bertha von Suttner devotes in her ingenious book The In ventory of a Soul a whole chapter to the proposition 4 ' The Principle of Evil a Phantom."1 She says: "I do not believe in the phantoms of badness, misery, and death. They are mere shadows, zeros, nothingnesses. They are negations of real things, but not real things themselves . . . There is light, but there is no darkness : darkness is only the non-existence of light. There is life, death is only a local ceasing of life phenomena . . . We grant that Ormuzd and Ahriman, God and Devil, are at least thinkable, but there are other opposites in which it is apparant that one is the non existence of the other. For instance : noise and silence. Think of a silence so powerful as to suppress a noise . . . Darkness has no degree, while light has. There is more light or less light, but various shades of darkness can mean only little or less light. Thus, life is a magnitude, but death is a zero. Something and nothing cannot be in struggle with each other. Nothing is without arms, nothing as an in dependent idea is only an abortion of human weaknesses . . . two are necessary to lInventarium einer Seele, Chap. XV.</page><page sequence="7">58b THE MONIST. produce struggle. If I am in the room, I am here ; if I leave it, I am no longer here. There can be no quarrel between my ego-present and ego-absent." This is the most ingenious and completest denial of the exist ence of evil, and it is presented with great force. It is the expres sion of the negativism of philosophy from Descartes to Spencer. It seems to be consistent monism. And yet, we cannot accept it. True enough, the idea of a personal Devil is as imaginary as a fairy, or an elf, or a hobgoblin ; true also that there is no evil in itself, and no goodness in itself ; the dualism of the Manichees is untenable. The evil principle cannot be conceived as an indepen dent substance, essence, or entity. But for that reason we cannot shut our eyes to its real and positive existence. Granted that silence is the absence of noise ; yet noise is not goodness, neither is silence badness. While I think or write, noise is to me an evil, while silence is bliss. Silence, where a word of cheer is expected or needed, may be a very positive evil, and a lie is not merely an ab sence of truth. The absence of food is a mere negation, but con sidered in the relation to its surroundings as an empty stomach, it is hunger ; and hunger is a positive factor in this world of ours. Sickness can be considered as a mere absence of health, but sick ness is caused either by a disorder in the system or the presence of injurious influences, both of which are unquestionably positive. A debt is a negative factor in the books of the debtor, but what is negative to the debtor is positive to the creditor. If negative ideas were "mere abortions of human weakness," as Bertha von Suttner claims, how can mathematicians have any use for the minus sign ? And if the idea of evil were an empty su perstition, how could its influence upon mankind have been so last ing ? On the one hand it is true that all existence is positive, but on the other hand we ought to know that existence in the abstract is neither good nor bad ; goodness and badness depend upon the relations among the various existent things. And these relations may be good as well as evil. Some existences destroy other exist ences. Certain bacilli are destructive of human life, certain anti dotes destroy bacilli. There are everywhere parasites living upon other lives, and what is positive or life-sustaining to the one is nega</page><page sequence="8">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 587 tive and destructive to the other, and every such negation is a real ity, the effectiveness of which neutralises the action of another reality. The idea of goodness is by no means equivalent with existence, and badness with non-existence. Existence is the reality; it is the indivisible whole, the one and all. Good and evil, however, are views taken from a certain given standpoint, and from this stand point good and evil are features forming a contrast, but as such they are always actualities ; neither the one nor the other is a mere nothing. The question is only whether we have a right to regard our own standpoint as the positive one representing that which is good, and all the powers that hinder human life as negative or evil. The answer to this question seems to be that any and every being will naturally regard its own standpoint as the positively given fact, and every factor that destroys it as negative ; his pleasure ap pears to him the standard of goodness. And we grant that every being is entitled to take this stand point, and that subjectivism naturally forms the initial stage of all ethical valuation. But we cannot rest satisfied with the principle of subjective autonomy as a solution of the problem of good and evil. Supposing that good were indeed simply that which gives pleas ure or enhances my life, and bad that which gives pain or threatens to destroy it, the standard of goodness and badness would be purely subjective. The famous savage-chief quoted by Tylor, and from Tylor by Spencer, would have fathomed the problem of good and evil when he declared that "bad is if anybody took away his wife, but if he took away the wife of some one else, that would be good. " Good would be that which pleases me ; and the good as an objective reality would not exist. There would be something good for me, for you, and for many others, but what might be good for me might be bad for you. Goodness and badness would be purely subjective qualities without any objective value. The view which bases ethics upon a consideration of pleasure and pain and defines goodness as that which affords the greatest amount of pleasurable feelings is called hedonism. The coarsest</page><page sequence="9">588 THE MONIST. form of hedonism (as represented by Bentham) makes the pleasure of the individual supreme ; it bases its ethics upon selfishness, and sees in altruism only refined egotism. The altruist is said to love but himself in others. Let me add here that the intuitionalist basing ethics upon the voice of his conscience is, closely considered, also a hedonist, or at least a subjectivist, for he finds the ultimate authority of conduct in himself, viz., in the pleasure of those motor ideas of his which he calls his conscience : what he is pleased to consider as ethical, he thinks is ethical. His standard of morality is the subjectivity of his conviction which he is unable either to analyse or to trace to its origin. He differs from Bentham's hedonism of ethical egotism only in this, that the pleasure of his conscience overrules the lower pleasures of the senses. Modern utilitarianism, as represented by Mr. Spencer, remains a purely subjective ethics, for it makes the greatest happiness of the greatest number, the maxim of ethics ; and by doing so it introduces no objective principle, but it simply proposes to replace every single subjectivity by the sum total of all subjectivities ; and subjective ethical maxims are not as yet truly ethical ; they remain on the level of the world-conception of Tylor's savage. All subjective ethical theories fail to see the cardinal point of ethics, for the very nature of ethics is objective. If there is no objective authority of moral conduct, we had better openly declare that ethics is an illusion and what we call ethics is simply an arith metical calculation in which pleasures and pains are weighed against one another and morality is at best only a dietetics of the soul. As a matter of fact, however, he who opens his eyes will see that there is an objective authority of conduct in life. Life and the factors in life are not purely what we make them. Here we are to run a race and the course of the individual as much as that of mankind and all living beings is prescribed in a very definite and unmistakable way on the lines of what since Darwin we have accustomed ourselves to call evolution. We must learn to recognise the necessity of pro gress which leads us onward on a straight and narrow path. Those who willingly obey the laws of progress advance on the path in</page><page sequence="10">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 589 spite of its thorns, joyously and gladly. The reluctant are urged forward and feel the smart of nature's whip, while he who obsti nately refuses to mind the laws of the cosmic order goes to the wall. Nature has no consideration for our sentiments, be they pleas ures or pains. Happy is he who delights in acting according to her laws. But he who seeks other pleasures is doomed. Look at the situation from whatever standpoint you may, the criterion of right or wrong, of good or bad, of true and false, lies not in the greater or lesser amount of pleasure and pain, but in the agreement of our actions with the cosmic order, and morality is that which is in con cord with the law of evolution. Ethics teaches us to do voluntarily what after all we must do whether or not it may please us. In a word, ethics is unthinkable without duty, and the essential element of duty is its objective reality, its inflexible sternness, and its austere authority. We say to the hedonist, a good action is not moral because it -gives pleasure, but because it accords with duty; and we must not look out for that which gives us pleasure but we must endeavor to find our highest pleasure in doing that which the cosmic law (or, religiously speaking, God) demands of us. Those who deny that there is any objective norm of right and wrong in the universe, are inclined to claim with Huxley, that man survived not on account of his morality, but on the contrary, on ac count of his immorality. It has been said that man is more rapa cious, more egotistical, more immoral than brutes. Without deny ing that an immoral man may sometimes appear more brutish than a brute, we cannot see that man is as immoral as or even more im moral than brutes. But the case is worth considering. Says the wolf in iEsop's fable : "Why is it right for you to eat the lamb, when for me it is supposed to be wrong ?" Is not man in the same predicament as the wolf, and does not mankind slaughter more animals than all the wolves in the world ever ate ? Granted that the wolf's pleadings are substantiated, we observe that man lives, but wolves are exterminated, which seems good evidence in favor of man being in greater accord with the cosmic laws. And yet the actions of both, the wolf and the man, seem to</page><page sequence="11">59o THE MONIST. be identical ; or rather, if the blackness of a crime depended upon quantitative measurement by addition, we should have to decide in favor of the wolves ; for man at the present time kills more sheep, pigs, and other animals in one year than wolves could devour in a century. What is the justification of slaughter in the one case, and what its condemnation in the other? In answering this question we shall not idealise man's mode of living on the meat of his fellow creatures. For it appears that from a moral standpoint it would be preferable to sustain life without slaughtering lambs and calves, fowl and fishes. The case must not be considered from an abstract or ideal standpoint, but simply treated as a comparison of the wolf's conduct with man's conduct ; and we find that the more sheep a man eats, the more he raises. The wolf eats them without raising them. The wolf murders the lamb. How ever, the slaughter of the lamb by man is no murder, for it serves to increase and to sustain human souls, and the souls of man pos sess more truth and a higher insight into nature. The lamb dies as a sacrifice on the altar of humanity, and this sacrifice is right and good if, and in so far as, it substitutes higher life for lower life. Subjectively considered the wolf has the same right as man to kill a lamb ; and also the same right as the lamb would have to kill wolves or men. The difference of man's and the wolf's actions appears only when we take into consideration the objective conditions of man's superiority, giving him a wider dominion of power which he can maintain because his soul is a better reflector of truth than are the notions of a wolf. We must insist here that the attainment of higher life, consist ing in a fuller comprehension of truth and a greater acquisition of power, is one of the most essential requisites of morality. Morality is not a negative quality, but a very positive endeavor. We must abandon the old standpoint of negativism that goodness consists in not doing certain things which are forbidden. Genuine goodness consists in daring and doing ; and in doing the right thing. One genuine and positive virtue atones for many sins that consist in mere omissions. The sheep is by no means (as is frequently claimed) more moral than the wolf. The wolf is bad enough, but he is at</page><page sequence="12">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. least courageous and keen ; the sheep is a coward, and with all its cowardice it is stupid. It is time to discard the ovine ideal of mor ality which praises all lack of energy and of accomplishments as the highest type of goodness. What we need is a positive concep tion of virtue based upon a careful consideration of the requirements of life. What higher life and lower life is cannot be declared to be an arbitrary distinction. It is not purely subjective, but can be defined according to an objective standard. Good to the savage is that which pleases him, and bad that which hurts him. Good, to him who has deciphered the religious mystery of the universe and un derstands the nature of God, is that which produces higher life, and bad is that which hinders, or perverts, or destroys it. III. THE GOD-IDEA. God is a religious term and it is often claimed that knowledge of God does not fall within the domain of science, the idea of God and all other religious terms are claimed to be extra-scientific. Thus there are two parties both of which are under the influence of nom inalistic subjectivism : religious agnostics and infidel agnostics. The belief of the former is as irrational as the disbelief of the latter. If there is an objective authority of conduct, we must be able to know it ; we can obey it only in so far as we know it. Now experience teaches us that there is an authority of conduct, and the theory of evolution promises to prove it by positive evidence. This author ity of conduct is called in the language of religion "God." Our scientists formulate under the name ? ' laws of nature " that which is immutable in the various phenomena, that which is universal in the variety of happenings, that which is eternal in the transient, and every law of nature is in its sphere a rigorous authority of conduct which in this sense is a part and parcel of God's being. The most important laws of nature in the ethical domain are those which regulate all the various and sometimes very delicate relations of man to man, which intercatenate our fates and set soul to soul in a mutually helpful responsion. Existence is one harmonious entirety ; there is not a thing in</page><page sequence="13">592 THE MONIST. the world but is embraced in the whole as a part of the whole. The One and All is the condition of every creature's being ; it is the breath of our breath, the sentiency of our feelings, the strength of our strength. Nothing exists of itself or to itself. All things are in terrelated ; and as all masses are held together by their gravity in a mutual attraction, so there is at the bottom of all sentiment a mys terious longing, a yearning for the fulness of the whole, a panpathy which finds a powerful utterance in the psalms of all the religions on earth. No creature is an isolated being, for the whole of exist ence affects the smallest of its parts ; and in this sense the scrip tural saying "God is Love" is a truth demonstrable by natural sci ence. Science proves that the whole of existence presents itself through out as regulated by law ; that it is not a chaos, not an incompre hensible riddle, but a cosmos. As a cosmos it is intelligible, and sentient creatures can learn to understand its nature and adapt themselves to it. God is that feature in the world which conditions and produces reason ; and reason is nothing but a reflexion of the world-order. The cosmic order of existence, the harmony of its laws, its systematic regularity makes intelligence possible, and sen tient beings will naturally develop into minds. God is that which changes individuals into persons, for reason and a rational will are the essential characteristic of personality. Taking this ground we say (adopting here, for the sake of sim plicity, the religious term God : those beings are good which are images of God. The nature of progress is not (as Mr. Spencer has it) an in crease of heterogeneity, but growth of soul. Evolution is not mere adaptation to surroundings, but a more and more perfect incarna tion of truth. Adaptation to surroundings is, in an ethical point of view, an incidental blessing only of the power afforded by right conduct.1 All facts of experience are revelations, but those facts which 1Cf. Homilies of Science, "The Test of Progress," p. 36, and "The Ethics of Evolution, " p. 41.</page><page sequence="14">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 593 teach us morality (man's conduct to his fellow-beings) embody truths of special importance. They exercise a wholesome influence upon the development of our souls, even though the primitive man was not able to fully understand the why and wherefore. In the lack of a clear comprehension of facts themselves, man's imagina tion clothes them in the garb of mythological imagery. In our own days the great teachers of morality are still regarded as the In dian regards the medicine-man, and the sacraments of the Church are treated like the totems of savages. Religion is now slowly pas sing out of the old stage of magic into the higher stage of a direct comprehension of facts. Myth changes into knowledge, and the allegory of the parable begins to be understood. As astrology changed into astronomy, so the religion of mir acles will give way to the religion of science. We often hear God spoken of as good, and he is sometimes represented as goodness in general. But God is more than good ness. God is the objective reality of existence regarded as the ul timate authority of conduct. God is thus the standard of good ness ; to call God good is an anthropomorphism. His creatures are more or less good, according as they are more or less faithful portraits of him, and as they obey his will. God is neither good nor bad, neither moral nor immoral, he is unmoral ; yet, his nature and character is the ultimate criterion of goodness and of morality. And God's will can be learned from his revelations, which in the terms of science are called experiences, and which we formulate with exactness in what is called "the laws of nature." God is not existence itself ; He is not, either singly or collec tively, the facts of the world ; He is not the sum-total of objects or existences. God is that omnipresent feature in the facts, in the objects of the world, in reality, which commands obedience ; God's will appears as that something in experience to which we have to conform. In a word, God is the standard of morality and the ulti mate authority of conduct. This is entheism, but not pantheism, for it recognises the distinction between God and the All or sum-total of existence. It is monotheism, but not the old monotheism, for it no longer looks upon God as one individual ego being. Yet it pre</page><page sequence="15">594 THE MONIST. serves the nucleus of the oldest conception of God, and accepts at the same time all that is true in pantheism.1 God was always an idea of moral import. God was and will remain (so long as the word is retained) the ultimate authority of conduct. Since the order of the world in its most general features is of intrinsic necessity, which means that under no conditions could it be imagined otherwise, God is the raison d'?tre not only of the world as it actually exists but of any possible world ; and in this sense entheism teaches that God is supernatural. Supernaturalism may be untenable as it was understood by dogmatists, yet there is a truth in supernaturalism which will remain true forever. Those who see in the facts of nature only matter in motion, will naturally be surprised at the fact that a cosmos with living and morally aspiring beings can develop out of it. A deeper insight into the conditions of nature reveals to us that the world is a well regulated cosmos, having its own definite and immutable laws, and these laws are realities as much as material things. They are not concrete entities, but they are real, nevertheless, and indeed of greater importance than the existence of sense-perceptible objects. The cosmos is not only an enormous mass of innumerable atoms, and molecules, and masses of suns and stars, but its finer texture shows that down into its most delicate details it is a wonderful sys tematic whole, full of life and consistency, and possessing an out spoken and clearly intelligible character. The world possesses ob jectivity, i. e., it is a reality independent of what we think it to be. The world is not as we think it to be, but we must think the world as it is, and our duty is to act accordingly. These are the plain facts of science which even the man who has no idea of science must mind. Only those creatures can in the long run of evolution survive who act according to the truth. Thus, 1 Entheism is the doctrine that God is omnipresent in the world. Pantheism identifies God and the All. Nomo theism teaches that the laws of nature are not laws given by God as a lawgiver may issue ordinances, but that they are manifes tations of God and as such parts of the Deity. Monotheism is the theory that there is one God, and monotheism is commonly understood to mean that this one God is a personal being.</page><page sequence="16">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 595 the truth became embodied in moral rules, even before science could deduce or explain them. Religion is a revelation in so far as it is an anticipation of certain truths which were at the time of their invention still uncomprehended. Religious ideas, accordingly, had to be symbols, and could be communicated only in parables. Now, the more science progresses, the better shall we learn to understand the meaning of these parables. God is in all things, but he is best revealed in man?especially in the morally aspiring man, and this is the meaning of the ideal of a God-man, or Christ,?a Saviour whose teachings are the way, the truth, and the life. Jesus of Nazareth was, according to the latest and most search ing historical investigations, a real historical person and not a mere myth of religious poetry, however much he was decked out with the same mythological tinsel ornaments with which all the greatest teachers of mankind, such as Zoroaster and Buddha, have been over-loaded. Yet, whether or not Jesus was a historical person is of little consequence ; for the question is not whether Jesus of Naza reth lived 2,000 years ago, but whether Christ, the ideal of the God-man, the impetus of moral aspirations, is a living presence now. There are Christians whose Christianity is a mere Jesuism. Christians should distinguish between Jesus and Christ. Jesus taught the way, the truth, and the life, as he understood it ; but Christ is the way, the truth, and the life ; he is the ideal of good ness, of moral aspirations, of charity and love, as it finds its in carnation in man. He who believes in Jesus of Nazareth is not as yet free from paganism. He has the religion of the medicine man, which is a belief in the magic power of Christian totems. He only who believes in Christ and lives like Christ has embraced Christianity,?the ideal Christianity that is free from pagan ingre dients. IV. THE EVIL ONE. Evil personified appears at first sight repulsive. But the more we study the personality of the Devil, the more fascinating it be comes. The Evil One is in the beginning of his existence the em</page><page sequence="17">596 THE MONIST. bodimeiit of everything unpleasant, then of everything bad, evil, and immoral. He is hatred, destruction, and annihilation incar nate, and as such he is the adversary of existence, of the Creator, of God. The Devil is the rebel of the cosmos, the independent in the empire of a tyrant, the opposition to uniformity, the dissonance in universal harmony, the exception to the rule, the particular in the universal, the unforseen chance that breaks the law ; he is the individualising tendency, the craving for originality, which bodily upsets the ordinances of God that enforce a definite kind of con duct ; he overturns the monotony that would permeate the cosmic spheres if every atom in unconscious righteousness and with pious obedience slavishly followed a generally prescribed course. The ingenuous question, "Why does not God kill the Devil?" is comical enough, because we feel instinctively that it is impos sible. I know of a good old woman who prayed daily in devout fervor and great piety that God might have mercy and save the Devil. Think of it closely, and this attitude is touching ! How many great theologians have seriously discussed the problem whether the Devil could be saved. Like that good old woman, they were so engrossed in the literal belief of their mythology that they did not see that the problem implied a contradiction. For God and Devil are relative terms, and God would cease to be God if there were no Devil. The universe is such that the evolution of a higher life is pos sible only through great strain. The evolution of the warm glow of a soul out of the cold clay of the earth, of moral aspirations out of the fierce hatred that animates the struggle for existence, of in telligence, thought and forethought out of the brute indifference of that unthinking something which we call matter in motion, is due to extraordinary exertions ; it is the product of work performed at the expenditure of enormous energy, and constant efforts are re quired merely to preserve the treasures already won. Difficulties to be overcome are called in the terminology of mechanics "the power of resistance," and this power of resistance is, closely con sidered, an essential and even a beneficial factor in the constitution of the universe.</page><page sequence="18">THE PROBLEM OF GOOD AND EVIL. 597 If there were no power of resistance, if no efforts were needed to reach any end desired, if the world were pleasure and goodness throughout, we should have no evolution, no progress, no ideals ; for all spheres of existence would float in one universal ocean of bliss, and all things would be intoxicated with heavenly delight. Pain produces the want of something better, and deficiencies arouse the desire for improvement. If the feeling substance of mo ners had all their wants satisfied without further exertion, man would never have risen out of the bythos of amoeboid existence, and if the man of to-day lived in a Schlaraffia, he would not trouble about new inventions, progress, or any amelioration, he would simply live on in unthinking enjoyment. There would be no need of making any efforts, no need of struggling against evils, no need of virtue, no need of working out our salvation. There would be no badness, but there would be no goodness, either. All existence would be soaked with moral indifference. Good is good only because there is evil, and God is God be cause there is a Devil. As evil is not a mere negation, so the figure of Satan in religion is not an idle fancy. Goethe says : ' * Ich kann mich nicht bereden lassen, Macht mir den Teufel nur nicht klein : Ein Kerl, den alle Menschen hassen, Der muss was sein ! " Now, let us look at the mythical figure of Satan as represented in theology, folklore, and poetry. Is he not really a most interest ing man ? Indeed, in spite of being a representative of all kinds of crimes, he possesses many redeeming features so as to be great and noble. According to the account in the second chapter of Genesis, Satan is the father of science, for he induced Eve to make Adam taste of the fruit of knowledge, and the Ophites, a gnostic sect, worshipped the serpent for that reason. Satan produces the unrest in society, which, in spite of many inconveniences, makes; the world move onward and forward ; he is the patron of progress, investigation, and invention. Giordano Bruno, Galileo, and other men of science were regarded as his offspring and persecuted on</page><page sequence="19">598 THE MONIST. his account by the Church. And when we glance over the records of Devil contracts, we learn to have respect for the old gentleman. Milton's Satan is a grand character, a noble-souled rebel, who would rather undergo an eternity of torture than suffer humiliation. Consider but the fact that, taking the statements of his adver saries alone, the Devil is the most trustworthy person in existence. He has been cheated by innumerable sinners, saints, angels, and (according to various old church legends) even by the good Lord himself ; and yet he has never been found wanting in the literal and punctilious fulfilment of all his promises ; and all the bad experi ences he has had in the course of millenniums have not in the least lowered his character. His mere word is honored like the holiest oath, or like the best signature verified with seals and legal wit nesses. The instances are rare in which it is known that persons with whom he has had business transactions have requested him to sign a contract, to give a pledge, or to show any proof' that he would honestly abide by his word ; his honesty was never doubted by anybody. And mind you, it is not the Devil who boasts of his integrity, but this is the conclusion at which we arrive from the evidences adduced by his enemies. Our sympathy for this martyr of honest conduct, the dupe of God and man, grows when we consider our own nature and relation to his Satanic majesty. With our hands upon our hearts, must we not confess that every one of us, with all our likeness to God, has some trait or other that makes us kin to the Devil ? I do not mean here to make reference to actual sin or grievous transgressions, but to things of which we scarcely think of repenting. Did we never in an hour of humor laugh at our neighbor ? Did we never joke at the cost of somebody else ? Did we never bulldoze, tease, or tantalise our very best friends ? Did we never enjoy the awkward situation in which some poor innocent had been caught ? And why should we not ? If we took away from life its satire, jokes, and other "devil tries," it would lose part of its most fragrant zest, and if we con structed a man consisting of virtues only, would not that fellow be the most unbearable bore in the world, wearisome beyond descrip tion? For it is a sprinkling of petty vices that makes even a great</page><page sequence="20">the problem of good and evil. 599 man human. A mere ethical machine would neither be attractive nor arouse our sympathies. The Devil is the father of all misunderstood geniuses. It is he who induces us to try new paths ; he begets originality of thought and deed. He tempts us to venture out boldly into unknown seas for the discovery of new ways to the wealth of distant Indias. He makes us dream of and hope for more prosperity and greater happi ness. He is the spirit of discontent that embitters our hearts, but in the end often leads to a better arrangement of conditions. In truth, he is a very useful servant of the Almighty, and all the hein ous features of his character disappear when we consider the fact that he is necessary in the economy of nature as a wholesome stim ulant to action and as the power of resistance that evokes the no blest efforts of living beings. Indeed, the Devil is the most indis pensable and faithful helpmate of God. To speak mystically, even the existence of the Devil is filled with the presence of God. God, being the All in All, regarded as the ultimate authority of conduct, is neither evil itself nor goodness itself; but, neverthe less, he is in the good, and he is in the evil. He encompasses good and evil. God is in the growth and in the decay ; he reveals him self in life, and he reveals himself in death. He will be found in the storm, he will be found in the calm. He lives in good aspirations and in the bliss resting upon moral endeavors ; but he lives also in the visitations that follow evil actions. It is his voice that speaks in the guilty conscience, and he, too, is in the curse of sin, and in this sense he is present even in the evil itself. Even evil, temptation, and sin elicit the good : they teach man. And he who has eyes to see, ears to hear, and a mind to perceive, will read a lesson out of the very existence of evil, a lesson which, in spite of the terrors it inspires, is certainly not less impressive, nor less divine, than the sublimity of a holy life.
