Wesleyan University 2008 ISSN: 0018-2656 THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION: GERMAN ENLIGHTENMENT HISTORIOGRAPHY OF JEWISH THOUGHT DIRK WESTERKAMP ABSTRACT Leon Roth's famous question "Is there a Jewish philosophy?" has been the subject of an ongoing controversial debate. This paper argues that the concept of a Jewish philosophy? in the sense of an allegedly continuous philosophical tradition stretching from antiquity to early modernity?was created by German Enlightenment historians of philosophy. Under competing models of historiography, Enlightenment philosophy construed a continuous tradition of Jewish thought, a philosophia haebraeorum perennis, establishing a contro versially discussed order of discourse and a specific politics of historiography. Within this historiography, historical and systematical paradigms, values, and patterns kept shifting continuously, opening up perspectives for different, even contradictory accounts of what Jewish philosophy was (and is). With Hegel and his successors, this specific discourse came to a close. Hegel attacks "Jewish thought" as a form of metaphysics of substance?a critique countered by several thinkers who can be referred to as "Jewish Hegelians" (E. Fackenheim). The Jewish Hegelians fully accepted, however, Hegel's account of the "Philonic distinction": the difference between substance and subject within the conception of the One. This calls attention to the idea that not only the role of the "Mosaic distinc tion" (J. Assmann), the distinction between true and false in religion, should be examined more closely, but also the consequences of the "Philonic distinction" between identity and difference in monotheistic concepts of deity. I. THE POLITICS OF HISTORIOGRAPHY Leon Roth's famous question "Is there a Jewish philosophy?"1 has been the sub ject of an ongoing, controversial debate.2 What may seem like a mere nomencla ture argument among historians of philosophy in fact raises important questions concerning the particularistic or universalistic status of philosophical thoughts that place themselves in a certain religious tradition. It is all the more striking, 1. Roth's essay was first published as an introduction to the collected volume Jewish Philosophy and Philosophers, ed. R. Goldwater (London: Hillel Foundation, 1962).

The thesis explored in this paper maintains that the concept of a "Jewish philosophy"?in the sense of an allegedly continuous philosophical tradition stretching from antiquity to early modernity?was created by German historians of philosophy in the Age of Enlightenment. The philosophical scenery in the eighteenth century, that is, at the time when a new interest in Jewish (and Arabic) thought emerged, was dominated by two "scientific revolutions," one of them being the Leibniz-Wolffian system of metaphysics, the other one?in tertwined with the first, but less well known?the explosion of philosophical historiography.3 Within a fairly short period of time, dozens of histories of phi losophy, often addressed to a broader audience, were written and published?at first in Latin, later almost exclusively in German. In particular, Johann Jacob Brucker's Historia critica Philosophiae (Leipzig 1742-1744), an impressive work of six volumes, exercised a great influence in Europe, most importantly perhaps on Diderot's Encyclopedic (and later on Hegel's Lectures on the History of Philosophy). What these historians of philosophy, most of whom were renowned philoso phers teaching at German universities, had in mind was nothing less than a univer sal historical order of philosophical discourse. Yet their politics of canonization produced a paradoxical outcome: in the attempt to establish and restore philoso phical resources, other resources and traditions were discovered, if not invented. In their endeavor to define philosophy by collecting all accessible data on philo sophical thought and classifying them historically and systematically, these hi storians and philosophers established a hierarchy of inclusion and exclusion. Not every thought within the human evolution of thinking, they argued, could claim to be philosophical. It seemed clear that too universalistic and inclusive a system would lose its distinctions and theoretical grasp. Particularly contestable were, of course, the pre-Hellenic or non-Greek traditions. Early Enlightenment thinkers like Jonsen and Heumann asked whether there had been any philosphical strands of non-Greek origin that deserved to bear the title of "philosophy"? More specifically, the question was whether the patriarchs, the great prophets of the Bible, later the meso-Platonically influenced Jewish thinkers, and, later again, the medieval Arab-Jewish philosophers, had something to offer to the quest and challenges of philosophical thinking. This important question, which was the cornerstone of a continuing debate in the "Theorienmotorik"4 of the eighteenth century, finally led to a reconsideration of Jewish thought. But by establishing a classifying canon of inclusions and exclusions in order to achieve a coherent systematical and historical tableau, eighteenth-century historiography actually invented the very subject it had set out to classify. In defining the sys tematic and historical categories applicable to Jewish thought, these historians 3. See U. J.

II. "MORGENLANDISCHE PHILOSOPHIE": THE ORIGINS OF PHILOSOPHICAL ORIENTALISM? Within this order of philosophical discourse, Jewish thought was first conceived as part of an "oriental philosophy" (morgenlandische Philosophie)?a. term most probably introduced by Christian August Heumann (1681-1764) in his Acta Philosophorum from 1715. The German term was a translation of earlier notions already present in Renaissance philosophy, which themselves drew on the term "Barbarian philosophy," coined by the patristic thinkers Tatian (b. ca. 120) and Clement of Alexandria (d. 215) in his Stromateis. Clement tried to show that Jew ish-Christian biblical thinking (that is, "Barbarian philosophy") was not only not inferior to Greek philosophy, but it had even been one of the very sources upon which Greek thought had originally drawn.5 This helps to clarify in which sense the philosophia haebraeorum was considered to be a part of (or at least a think ing in close proximity to) the philosophia barbarorum, which in turn could be perceived as the cradle of Jewish, Christian, and, further on, Islamic thinking. The term "oriental philosophy," however, raises the question of whether the German historians of Jewish philosophy argued on the basis of what Edward Said called "orientalism."6 Regardless of the critique this concept has since attracted, it might be appropriate to apply some of its more important aspects to our topic. Said claimed that Western ideas about the "orient," that is, the Islamic peoples and the Arab world, were mere cliches based on the founding texts and early his tory of the oriental culture. This bias had emerged from European scholarship at the end of the eighteenth century, functioned to serve political aims, and helped to define Europe's self-image and self-concept. It acted as a model for all Western "discourses on the Other" and led, as Said maintains, to a specific construction of identity that involved competing opposites. Of course, Said did not add the eighteenth-century discussions about Jewish philosophy to his picture (lest he endanger his basic political assumptions). And he generally tends to omit German scholarship, which is, as Keith Windshuttle has put it, rather "like trying to do a survey of the discipline of sociology without mentioning Weber, Simmel, or Tonnies."7 If Said had given a more balanced description of "orientalism," he should not only have taken into account the construction of Jewish thought as part of the "morgenlandische Philosophic"; he should also have had to conclude that in construing "oriental" traditions, the German historians of philosophy had been among the first scholars to attempt to open the Western mind to establish the study of Islam and its philosophical com ponents as a respected academic subject. Moreover, particularly the Enlighten 5. For further details, see G. G. Stroumsa, Barbarian Philosophy: The Religious Revolution of Early Christianity (Tubingen: Mohr Siebeck, 1999). 6. E. W.

One of the first modern histories of philosophy was written by Georg Horn (1620-1670), later a professor of philosophy in Leiden. His Historia philo sophica appeared in 1655, the same year as Thomas Stanley's famous History of Philosophy that Hegel was still using in the 1820s. In contrast to Stanley, however, Horn introduces a philosophia iudaeorum or philosophia ebraeorum9 into his outline of the evolution of philosophical thinking. With this remarkable step, Horn pleads for a historiography concentrating "solely on the examination of truth [inquisitio veritatis]."10 Insofar as truth is not a matter of what Kant later called Schulweisheit but rather of Weltweisheit, Horn emphasizes that more universalist, transhistorical, and transcultural concepts of philosophy also have to include "what the Hebrews called chockma, the Greeks sophia, the Latins sapiential11 so that, in this respect at least, the philosophia haebraeorum would be a part of philosophy. Admittedly, the crude biblical narration of creation and the Mosaic code do not score high compared with the scientific achievements in the physics or eth ics of Greek philosophy. According to Horn, one can speak of a philosophical Jewish thinking no earlier than the first centuries bce, when the influence of Hellenism penetrated the Jewish realm and "Greek philosophy was spread also in Judea."12 This view became influential in later historiographical accounts of Judeo-Greek traditions. Viewed from a systematic perspective, however, the only philosopher who formed Jewish tradition and Greek philosophy into a genuine approach was Philo of Alexandria (ca. 20 bce-50 ce), according to Horn the only one "who, among the Jews, might have merited the title of Philosopher."13 Georg Horn almost completely omits the medieval traditions of Jewish philosophy. In his chapter about "The Flourishing of Arabic Philosophy in Spain" (Incrementa Philosophiae Arabicae in Hispania), he briefly mentions Maimonides and "Aben Tibbon" as, so to speak, second-hand Peripatetics: as disciples of Aristotle, "but in the tradition and adaptation of the Arabs."14 Horn's view that the contribution of philosophia haebraeorum to the history of philosophy is extremely limited was shared by Johann Jonsen, a philosopher from Rendsburg (1624-1659). His influential, four-volume compendium De Scriptori bus Historiae philosophicae, posthumously published in 1665, devoted a chapter 8. It is not, though, taken into account by the otherwise brilliant (albeit fairly provocative) essay by D. Gutas, "'The Study of Arabic Philosophy in the Twentieth Century': An Essay on the Historiography of Arabic Philosophy," British Journal of Middle Eastern Studies 29, no. 1 (2002), 5-25. 9. G.

While the Hellenic Jews seemed to be quite learned (peritus) in the sciences, the lack of logical reasoning and methodology, he concludes, led to a further lapse of Jewish thought into mysticism, and thus into something that could not be of much interest to the historiography of philosophical thinking.16 To be sure, the omission of medieval Jewish philosophy was partly due to the disrepute in which scholastic and medieval philosophy was generally held. In this respect, the Acta Philosophorum (1715) by Christoph August Heumann (1681-1764), a professor of philosophy and polyhistory in Gottingen, was no exception. Heumann's eight-volume journal of philosophy regards medieval and scholastic philosophy as completely "superfluous" (uberflussig).11 This politics of establishing an inclusive and exclusive historiographical canon that also aimed at the philosophia haebraeorum was based on two principles: "scholarship" (Ge lehrsamkeit) and "distinction of truth" (Unterscheidung der Wahrheit)}* While Heumann's emphasis on "scholarship" implies a strongly normative concept of an "accurate order"19 according to rationality (and Christian belief), his "distinction of truth" seems to echo Horn's phrase on the "examination of truth" (inquisitio veritatis) in a much sharper tone. In Heumann's work, distinction of truth implies an unambiguous differentiation between "true" and "untrue" philosophies. Although Heumann refused to illuminate the argumentative basis of his truth distinctions, he provided at least a schematic outline of the antique traditions of philosophy that had a major impact on later Enlightenment systematizations of historical epochs. By scanning many different kinds of older narratives, texts, myths, and thoughts in search of philosophical ideas, Heumann came to divide pre-Christian thought into a philosophia graecanica and a philosophia extra graecanica, the latter being again subdivided into a philosophia haebraeorum and a philosophia barbarorum. On a systematic level, he divides philosophy into an inductive philosophia empirica (lumen revelationis) and a deductive philosophia scientifica (lumen rationis). By "empirical philosophy," Heumann subsequently understands think ing that argues on the basis of everyday experience and ordinary language. This is true, he claims, for the biblical patriarchs and prophets. Although "wise and reasonable people," they remained purely empirical thinkers, "but were no phi losophers."20 In opposition to Horn, Jonsen, and Gundling,21 Heumann aims at deleting the philosophia haebraeorum from the archive of philosophy. At first still ambivalent in his judgment, he later speaks of the "simple-minded wisdom" of the Hebrews and concludes that "to look for truth among the Jews is identical 15. J.

To illustrate his outline, Heumann adopts a metaphor frequently used by Leib niz,23 which entered the terminology of many a later Enlightenment historian (most likely via Heumann): the anthropomorphic metaphor of the maturing ages of hu mankind. In the preface to his Theodicy (1710), Leibniz compared pagan thought to the period of childhood, Judaic thought to the juvenile period, and Christian thought to the adulthood of humankind. Heumann, however, does not make use of Leibniz's distinctions without changing them considerably. According to his schematization, the non-Hellenic "morgenlandische Philosophic" belongs to the "childhood" (Kindheit) of humankind. At this stage, Heumann explains, logical and philosophical reasoning were still undeveloped, "simple-minded," and lack ing "accurate order."24 The second, juvenile, period (Jugendalter) of humankind reached from Greek philosophy to late-antique Christian thought. Here, we wit ness major achievements in logical reasoning, physics, and ethics. The "accurate order" of the disciplines, however, is a task that has been saved for the present, that is, the third period in the intellectual life of humankind. In cutting off all its medieval and early modern strands, Heumann evidently reduces Jewish thought to the period of "childhood" in the evolution of philosophical thinking. III. FROM NOMOS TO LOGOS: TRUTHS OF FACT AND TRUTHS OF REASON It would seem that the hermeneutical principle of the first period of the histori ography of Jewish thought (from 1655 to 1731) was the normative inquiry into truth. Establishing a normative order of philosophical discourse had been a major trend in early Enlightenment historiography, which was clearly biased toward "orientalism." The data-based and philologically oriented scholarly enterprises of Horn, Jonsen, Gundling, Buddeus, Heumann, and others set the agenda for in fluential "orientalist" verdicts?mostly without explicating the conditions of their normative assumptions. Ironically, the shift from nomos to logos these historians claimed to have discovered in the evolution of thought from Judaism to Christi anity seems to mirror their own transition from a normative to a more systematic account of the history of philosophy in general and the history of Jewish philoso phy in particular. The result of the early Enlightenment historiography of Jewish thought?namely that there is a seemingly uninterrupted tradition of philosophia haebraeorum?is generally accepted by the new generation of philosophers and historians. What is increasingly challenged, though, is the subordination of Jew ish thought under the tradition of "oriental philosophy." This is due not least to a shift in the prevailing hermeneutic paradigm of historiography from a purely normative distinction of truth to the Leibnizean distinction between truths of fact 22.

Unsurprisingly, it was a disciple of Leibniz who introduced the new paradigm and thus revolutionized the historiography of philosophia haebraeorum: Johann Jacob Brucker (1696-1770). Brucker worked extensively on Jewish philosophy, at first in German in his nine volumes of Kurtze Fragen aus der philosophischen Historie (1731-1736), and then again in his famous classic Historia critica Philosophiae (1742-1744), which, being written in Latin, became popular among many European intellectuals. The third volume of Brucker's Kurtze Fragen undertakes in 960 pages to examine the "conditions of philosophy among the Jews." Here we find, for the first time, the German term "Judische Philosophic" It is quite plausible that Brucker should claim to have written the first "complete history of Jewish philosophy,"25 an attempt indeed unparalleled both in Christian and Jewish scholarship to that date. With regard to his predecessors Horn, Jonsen, Gundling, and others, Brucker's approach had a twofold aim. While altogether denying early Jewish thinking (the so-called "philosophy of the patriarchs") the status of philosophia, he criticized at the same time the prevailing omission of the "real" Jewish philosophy since the Middle Ages. It is "not before the eleventh century" that we can speak of a Jew ish philosophy "using Greek methodology."26 Accordingly, Brucker's discussion of medieval Jewish philosophers such as Jehuda Halevi, Maimonides, Crescas, Albo, and others is much more detailed than it had been in preceding histories of philosophy. Brucker still follows Heumann insofar as he, too, views the develop ment of the human spirit as a journey from East to West: in the eleventh century, he says, the "center of Jewish scholarship" (der Sitz der judischen Gelehrsam keit) moved "to Spain."27 Brucker's achievement, however, was to start freeing Jewish and Arabic philosophy from the spell of "orientalism." This went hand in hand with his attempt to elucidate the foundation of his historical accounts more theoretically. To that end, Brucker implicitly borrowed the distinction between verites defait and verites de raison from Leibniz's Monadology (1714). Whereas the verites defait (truths of fact) refer to empirical knowledge acquired through experience or handed on by other people, the verites de raison (truths of reason or neces sary truths) represent universal truths based on innate principles (for example, geometry or the notion of God).28 Brucker applies this distinction to his opposi tion between reason and revelation. Thus, the philosophical ideas gained from oriental, and in particular Hebrew, traditions were based solely on "revelation," that is, on verites de fait. Knowledge of them therefore stemmed entirely from "the invention of God's imagination, not from philosophical deduction."29 What 25. J. J.

Within the tradition of the philosophia haebraeorum, Brucker conceives Philo of Alexandria as the first Jewish philosopher who tried to break away from the primacy of the truths of fact as truths of revelation. Philo borrowed the systematic principles of his reasoning?his truths of reason?from Plato, and blended them with the Mosaic narration. To accord the Hebrew tradition its proper weight, Brucker emphasizes the Jewish components of Philo's thought. In doing so, he heavily engages in the discussions on Philo's logos-theology that were so promi nent in the historiography of the early Enlightenment. Brucker gave them a new twist, though, by stressing Philo's concept of God's performative speech-act of creation (the logos prophorikos) as genuinely Jewish. As is well known, it is highly disputed to this very day whether the logos-philosophy?the theology of the creating Word of God as God's son?is a middle-Platonic, Jewish, or specifi cally Christian current (as might be thought prima facie). The logos-philosophy tried to bridge the gap between the absolute transcendent Divinity that is beyond human understanding, and the material and intelligible world that we can seem ingly only conceive as having been created by a God who descended from his transcendent place. Philo names the logos "God's son," as Brucker aptly mentions: "Logos-the ology is the lore of God's word, i.e. of the Son of God. . . . The entire mundus intelligibilis is to be encompassed and enclosed in the divine word or intellect (logo)."30 This, of course, called into question the interrelation between the Phi Ionic and the Johannine logos, and the separation of Christianity from Judaism.31 Brucker seems to be undecided, but eventually paves the way for a question that has, for a long time in Enlightenment historiography, inhibited research on this topic: the question "whether John, the Evangelist, could have read Philo's works and borrowed his concept of logos in order to place his [Philo's] untenable thoughts in a good and orthodox order."32 The Christian logos, so to speak, had to become flesh, and thus came to free the Jewish logos from the boundaries of the nomos?thereby putting the two in the accurate order. Here, again, we witness the early Enlightenment demand for a discourse-order. In this respect, Brucker and the like may have regarded themselves as successors to the early Christian authors in rewriting the logos?only that this time they would rewrite the entire history (not the substance) of the philosophical logos from the beginning to the present. The decisive turn reached with Brucker was that in contrast to most of his predecessors he tried to accord medieval Jewish philosophy its proper systematic weight. Unsurprisingly, he points out that me dieval Jewish philosophy began as an enterprise that seems to be reminiscent of his own approach. The inevitable tendency to historicize and systematize their 30. Ibid., IV, 357. 31. This is a current issue among scholars of comparative religion, Judaic and patristic studies, and philosophy.

Brucker claims that the (re)shaping of Jewish tradition could in any case not be pursued without chal lenging Christian philosophy, that is, without a parting of the ways with regard to their different concepts of God. Saadia's strong anti-Christian bias meets with Brucker's equally strong anti-Jewish polemic: "In the second book [of Saadia's Emunot ve Deoi], he proves that only one God exists and at the same time pours out his blasphemous Jewish poison [seyn Judisches Ldster-Gijft] on the Holy Trinity."35 Here the ambiguities of Brucker's approach become obvious: while he opposes simple-minded "orientalist" projections, his belief in the philosophical backwardness of the Jews (and, of course, their Ismaelite brothers) still manages to slip in through the back door of his argumentation. In the twelfth century, Brucker goes on, the tendency of Judaism to historicize and systematize its own theological, cultural, and philosophical heritage was taken up by Jehuda Halevi (1085-1140) and in particular by Maimonides (1135-1204), whose famous thirteen principles (ikkarim) and whose reconstruction of Jewish thought on the basis of Aristotelian metaphysics, physics, and ethics marked a major achievement in Jewish and Western thought. As it is beyond the scope of this paper to examine Brucker's intriguing interpretation of Maimonides, we shall instead take a look at another "orientalist" current in his historiography. Again, Brucker anticipates a question raised in current research on the relation between Maimonides and the early Kabbala. For Brucker, Maimonides clearly is a ration alist as well as a Kabbalist: "Maimonides belongs . . . among the Kabbalists, and therefore also, under another heading, among the Jewish philosophers."36 It should be kept in mind that the seventeenth- and eighteenth-century histori ans of philosophy did not place the Kabbala in the same historical setting as we do today (that is, in the context of the Jewish esotericism emerging from theo logical circles active in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries in southern Spain). Brucker, among many others, believed the Kabbala had been established "in Egypt some centuries before Christ's birth."37 The effects of Jewish mysticism on the Christian Kabbala were heavily contested in the eighteenth century, with Brucker, Heumann, Jonsen, and many others fully rejecting them as a sort of disguised atheism (and of implicit Spinozism). With its origins allegedly rooted in pre-Christian "oriental philosophy," the medieval and early modern Kabbala resembled an oriental rollback to the prehistory of scientific knowledge. In the light of the philosophical progress made so far, the Kabbala, as Brucker suspects, is but a mere "play with words and letters." It is the product of a bewildered 33. Ibid., 511. 34.

The attitude toward "Judische Philosophic" generally became more sympathetic (and enhanced the study of its medieval and early modern currents), although the belief that this tra dition bore the indelible scars of its oriental origins never really vanished. Even so, more and more accounts of Jewish thought tried to distinguish a philosophia haebraeorum from the tradition of a philosophia orientis. This is what Johann Heinrich Samuel Formey (1711-1797), professor and secretary of the Royal Academy of Sciences in Berlin, was aiming at in his Kurtzgefassete Historie der Philosophic (1763). Formey's work is noteworthy in various respects. From the very beginning his introductory remarks show a skeptical tone quite unusual in the overall optimism of the Enlightenment. While most of his contemporaries viewed the evolution of human knowledge and its enlightenment as a continuous linear progress, Formey expressed his reservations: "Had mankind never left the path of truth . . . , the history of philosophy would be the history of truth."39 The fact that, according to Formey, it has indeed never been a pure success story of truth is attributed to the interrelation of the completely heterogeneous traditions of thought it involved. Had all philosophies concentrated on developing the potential of their very own resources, they might have done truth a better service. Interrelations between dif ferent thought-worlds disadvantage both sides. In Formey's somewhat puzzling view, even the basic text of Judaism is contaminated: "The Jewish Law has been corrupted by the errors of oriental philosophy [durch die Irrtumer der morgen landischen Philosophie verderbet], and the fury of allegorizing took this corrup tion even further than we might imagine."40 This means that when the orientally depraved philosophia haebraeorum (sive orientalium, we may add) came across the Hellenistic hermeneutics of allegory (around 100 bce-100 ce), the disaster was perfect. What Formey presents here is the formulation of a common (yet two fold) stereotype, popular among many Enlightenment historians of philosophy, according to which Jewish thought was either obsessed with (and misguided by) a bewildered imagination (Einbildungskraft) (which led to the Kabbala and the sophisticated Alexandrianism), or fell into abstract and formal reasoning (which led either to an unphilosophical rabbinism [Talmud, Mishna, etc.] or else to a philosophical "super"-rationality). Within the Jewish tradition, Formey argues, it was Maimonides alone who combined the best of both worlds. Therefore he became the father figure not only of Jewish scholasticism but also of Jewish mysticism. But Formey's above mentioned general skepticism about interrelation in philosophy eventually leads him to discard even what is today regarded as one of the most intriguing achieve ments of Maimonides' philosophy?the reconciliation of the Mosaic law (and its later rabbinical prescriptions) with Aristotelian ethics in his Shmone Perakim or 38.

In light of Brucker's and Formey's work we can proceed to decipher Lessing's famous book on the Education of the Human Race (1777-1780)42 as an implicit history of philosophy. IV. "THE LOGOS CAME": LESSING'S PHILOSOPHICAL TALE Among literary critics, Lessing's essay Die Erziehung des Menschengeschlechts is regarded primarily as a miniature of his philosophy of history. A closer look, however, taken from the perspective developed so far, can reveal the hidden philosophical and histori(ographi)cal material Lessing draws upon. What Less ing presents in ??1-55 of his essay is in fact an attempt to give the matrix of the development of early philosophical thinking until the rise of Christianity. This includes the philosophia haebraeorum, although Lessing does not use the term. What he takes from Leibniz and Heumann, instead, is the metaphor of the ages of man (Menschenalter), applying the phylogenetical process of passing through different ages or periods of life (Lebensalter) to the ontogenetical progress of human knowledge and its continuing struggle between reason and revelation. Whereas Leibniz indicated paganism as the childhood, Judaism as the youth, and Christianity as the mature age of humankind, Lessing alters and transforms this concept. In his outline, the horizon of future human knowledge stays open; Judaism and Christianity are the first two steps in (intellectual) history, while the (philosophical and spiritual) maturity of humankind, the "dritte Zeitalter" is yet to come (??86-100). Lessing distinguishes two basic philosophical ideas that humanity had to learn about in its childhood days: God as the One Substance, and the immortality of the soul. Yet the Hebrews, whose God had chosen to bring these ideas into the world, had not developed a philosophical mind: "They knew of no immortality of the soul; they yearned after no life to come. But now to reveal these things to one whose reason had as yet so little growth, what would it have been but the same fault in the Divine Rule as is committed by the schoolmaster, who chooses to hurry his pupil too rapidly, and boast of his progress, rather than thoroughly to ground him?" (?17). In order not to overtax the mind of the child (that is, the Hebrews), not to ask too much of its early faculty of judgment and reasoning but to "ground him," the philosophical idea of the One Substance could be revealed only by the paradigm of power (Machi) (?12), that is, through moral, not intel lectual, education: "But of what kind of moral education was a people so raw, so incapable of abstract thoughts, and so entirely in their childhood capable? Of 41. Ibid., 179. 42. Cited in the following by referring to the section numbers only; the translation is from G. E.

Sensuality, the basics of philosophia empirica, thus led the philosophia hae braeorum to the very idea it was supposed to achieve?the idea of the One: "And as God proceeded, demonstrating Himself to be the Mightiest of all, which only One can be, He gradually accustomed them thus to the idea of the One. But how far was this conception of The One, below the true transcendental conception of the One which Reason learnt to derive, so late with certainty, from the concep tion of the Infinite One?" (??13-14). To derive the transcendental notion of The One from the concept of the Infinite is, as we can interpolate into Lessing's text (where this is left open), the achievement of Spinoza's and Leibniz's metaphys ics. Moreover, the text echoes the Leibnizean distinction between truths of fact and truths of reason. What Lessing seems to say here is precisely that the neces sary truths of reason (that is, the idea of the One; immortality of the soul) could only be grasped by contingent truths of fact (for example, power, reward, and punishment?truths he elsewhere calls Tatsachenwahrheiten or Geschichtswahr heiten). In other words: truths that in face are a priori could only be revealed to the early Hebrew mind a posteriori, through experience. Now, the paradigm of power, still dominating education at this stage, estab lished an "Israelitish Theocracy" (?25)?a term Lessing borrows from Warbur ton. The problem the philosophia haebraeorum had to face, however, was that the second basic philosophical idea Jewish thought was destined to discover, namely the immortality of the soul, could not be found explicitly in the Hebrew's "primer" (Elementarbuch) (?26), that is, the "Old Testament." Hence, a dis tinguished hermeneutics of the different meanings of the Scripture had to be invented. All this, Lessing maintains, slowly brought about a shift of paradigms. The paradigm of power was replaced by the paradigm of wisdom. This could hap pen, however, only through an encounter of the philosophia haebraeorum with other philosophical traditions: "The child, sent abroad, saw other children who knew more, who lived more becomingly, and asked itself, in confusion, 'Why do I not know that too?'" (?38). Through its encounter with Sabean, Chaldean, and Persian (that is, oriental) philosophy during the Babylonian captivity, the philosophia haebraeorum?and this is what makes Lessing's account so remark able?did not actually adopt the texts and thoughts of those it encountered, but rather learned more about itself and what it already was supposed to know. The encounter with "the other" led the Hebrews to recur to their own proper sources. And so, the philosophia haebraeorum ventured to take a second look at its primer, "which had long been thrown into a corner, in order to throw off a blame upon the Primer. But behold, [the child] discovers that the blame does not rest upon the books, that the shame is solely its own, for not having long ago known this very thing, and lived in this very way" (?38). Lessing proceeds to take a closer look at the established Jewish hermeneutics by which new meanings could be brought to light from the old texts. He shows how new methods of textual "exercising," "allusions," and "hints" were devel oped, and he implicitly refers to the studium allegoriae Jewish philosophers set forth in Egypt during the first century bce. This was particularly important with</page><page sequence="13">THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION 545 regard to the second basic philosophical idea the philosophia haebraeorum had to engender: "Doubtless, the Jews were made more acquainted with the doctrine of immortality among the Chaldeans and Persians. They became more familiar with it too in the schools of the Greek Philosophers in Egypt" (?42). Again, we have to interpolate: the schools of Greek philosophy in Egypt brought forth Jewish philosophers such as Aristobulos and Philo. But the philosophical ideas that their Jewish-hellenistic philosophy (and its hermeneutics) invoked, Lessing resumes, was just too much for the old texts: Every Primer is only for a certain age. To delay the child, that has outgrown it, longer in it than it was intended for, is hurtful. For to be able to do this in a way in any sort profitable, you must insert into it more than there is really in it, and extract from it more than it can contain. You must look for and make too much of allusions and hints; squeeze allegories too closely; interpret examples too circumstantially; press too much upon words. (?51) Here, Jewish hermeneutics collapsed upon itself and broke down into rabbinism (as Lessing remarks in ?52, following most of the eighteenth-century historians), so that a new, second step of education became necessary: "the child had to be come a youth" (?55). This decline of the nomos released the incarnate logos: "A better Instructor must come and tear the exhausted Primer from the child's hands. Christ came!" (?53). We can leave Lessing's narrative here, as it then proceeds to outline the basic ideas of the philosophia Christiana, and try to sum up the new strands of thought Lessing added to philosophical historiography in the Enlightenment. In his tale (or sketch), Lessing does not consider Jewish logos-philosophy or the later me dieval philosophia haebraeorum. Surely his enterprise was not meant to be a sci entific one. It gave an account of the philosophia haebraeorum that drew on "ori entalist" traits, yet without conceding to any occidental philosophia Christiana the last word in human (intellectual) history. Lessing was well aware, of course, of the contribution of eminent "Jewish philosophers" like Mendelssohn and (if the term applies to him) Spinoza to the shaping of Enlightenment philosophy. What he did, however, was to reconstruct the systematic arguments by which an "enlightened" history of philosophy could be written, if at all: the pertinence of basic ideas (the One, immortality, Trinity), basic methods of distinction (truths of reason/fact, a priori and a posteriori knowledge), and basic paradigms (power, wisdom, freedom, reason/revelation). V. ANOTHER LOGOS: THE IMPORTANCE OF PHILOSOPHICAL TRANSMISSION I shall argue that Lessing's approach helped to reform the German historiography of philosophy, and that it particularly served Dietrich Tiedemann (1748-1803) to transform philosophical historiography into a "cultural history of philosophy" (Cultur-Geschichte der Philosophic).43 Between 1791 and 1797, Tiedemann, a professor of philosophy and anthropology in Marburg, released six volumes of his Geist der spekulativen Philosophic in which he sharply opposes the miscon ceptions of Hebrew and Arabic philosophy prevalent in Enlightenment thinking. 43. D. Tiedemann, Geist der spekulativen Philosophic (Marburg, 1793), III, vi.</page><page sequence="14">546 DIRKWESTERKAMP He intends to repulse the accounts and prejudices generally biased in the way of "orientalism" and calls for a neutral investigation, pursued by the "argument of a reason left to itself'44 (an allusion to Bacon's famous mens sibi permissa). Tiedemann hopes to break new ground by studying each philosophical tradition in its proper cultural and historical setting. This will, he trusts, put forward an "unprecedented," "entirely interrelated cultural history of philosophy." Thus, "interrelation," transmission, and continuity are the central paradigms Tiedemann sets against the hitherto conventional historiographical demand of a discourse-order. Volumes III (Marburg 1793) and IV (Marburg 1795) of his work offer a critique of current Enlightenment historiography of the philosophia haebraeorum. All the approaches so far, Tiedemann explains, are superficial, ex clusive, and lacking adequate knowledge of the basic sources of Jewish philoso phy. In his Geist der spekulativen Philosophic, Jewish philosophy is therefore rehabilitated in two different ways. The first step is a re-evaluation of medieval Christian, Arab/Muslim, and Jewish philosophy in general. Tiedemann knows well that this goes against the grain of contemporary scholarship: "Of Arabs and Scholastics I dared to say more positive things than usually," he remarks, and adds that the oriental traditions "have long enough been only ridiculed."45 The second point Tiedemann makes in favor of Jewish thought refers to his above-mentioned concept of interrelation. In a way, the philosophia haebraeo rum is the interrelated philosophy par excellence. It bridged, not only in antiquity but also in the Middle Ages, the gaps between oriental, barbarian, Christian, and Hellenic thought. This appraisal is diametrically opposed to the view shown above to have been Formey's. Whereas Formey thought that every tradition should develop its own essence and potentiality exclusively, Tiedemann em phasizes that in itself the very essence of Jewish philosophy is nothing else than interrelation. This is particularly true of Philo's logos-theology, an intermediate current between middle-Platonic, Jewish, and Christian philosophy and spiritu ality. Here, Jewish thought is truly philosophical, basing its essential claims on "truths of reason [Vernunftgrunde] alone."46 The piece de resistance of Tiedemann's Geist der spekulativen Philosophic is, however, his outline of medieval Jewish thought. One example might suf fice to show how Tiedemann, in contrast to his predecessors, not only holds medieval Jewish philosophy in high esteem, but even tries to discover in it a still challenging philosophical potential. His third volume devotes a long chapter to the "revival of Jewish philosophy" during the Middle Ages, and emphasizes the "achievements of the Jewish sciences."47 Nonetheless, at the end of the day it was one man who brought all these achievements into a great Summa: Maimonides in his More Nevuchim (Guide to the Perplexed, written around 1190). This book, Tiedemann explains, is not only of historical interest, it also anticipated two philosophical debates that later came up in the philosophy of the Enlightenment: first, the debate about the proofs of the existence of God (Leibniz, Kant); and 44. Ibid., Ill, 138. 45. Ibid. (Marburg, 1795), IV, v. 46. Ibid., Ill, 138. 41.Ibid.,lW, 161.</page><page sequence="15">THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION 547 second, the debate about the divine attributes (Descartes, Spinoza, Leibniz). Mai monides' first proof of the existence of God, based on the resolution of the anti nomy between eternity and transitoriness, is echoed (according to Tiedemann) in the arguments put forward by Samuel Clarke, among others. Maimonides' second proof, based on the assumptions of ens necessarium, seems to have been taken* up in Christian Wolff's philosophy. And last, Maimonides' theory of the divine attributes also proved to be "a subject of later disputes and arguments, ongoing even to this very day."48 More than any of his German predecessors, Tiedemann in his universalistic approach to a "cultural history of philosophy" stresses the role of philosophical interrelation and transmission. His Geist der spekulativen Philosophic tries to reveal the productive potential in seemingly obsolete philosophical traditions. It must be said, however, that in one respect Tiedemann follows rather uncritically the historiography he otherwise attacks: in his portrayal of Jewish mysticism and Kabbala he eventually falls back on the old "orientalist" arguments. The Kab balist claim of truth, he concludes, had its foundation "in the belief in the trans mission of all knowledge from above?which means: it was based on oriental idleness [orientalische Tragheit]"49 Nevertheless, it is thanks to Tiedemann's work that the attitude toward the philosophia haebraeorum became less idiosyncratic than it had been before. Tie demann raised the overall level of discussion. This can already be seen in Johann Gottlieb Buhle's standard work Lehrbuch der Geschichte der Philosophic (1800), although Buhle keeps repeating that "oriental philosophy [is] a feature of Jewish philosophy."50 Even more cautious in his assumptions about Jewish philosophy is the Kantian philosopher Wilhelm Gottlieb Tennemann (1761-1819). Ten nemann, a professor in Jena and, along with Brucker, the most famous German historian of philosophy, published his classic, nine-volume Geschichte der Phi losophic between 1804 and 1819. A shorter, popular version appeared in 1812, and was also translated into English in 1852 under the title Manual of the History of Philosophy. Above all, Tennemann reminds his readers of "how incomplete and distorted our knowledge of Arabic philosophy still is."51 This holds true for many other philosophical traditions, including Jewish philosophy, and shows how carefully we must evaluate and judge the material handed down to us. "Judgment" and the importance of the "faculty of judgment" (Urtheilskraft) are the basic paradigms of Tennemann's characteristically Kantian historiography. We might even say that Tennemann attempted to combine all the paradigms developed in the histo riographical material presented earlier: order of discourse, distinction of truths, interrelation, judgment. The faculty of judgment, Tennemann emphasizes, should not apply to categories that are alien to its given subject. It is therefore hardly surprising that Tennemann expresses his esteem for Maimonides (an esteem he shares with Tiedemann) by finding in Maimonides' 4S. Ibid., IV, 174. 49. Ibid., Ill, 141. 50. J. G.

He even awards to his philosophy the honorary title of "Enlightenment." It cannot be ruled out that Tennemann had Tiedemann's work in mind when he stressed the intercul tural impact of Maimonides' new achievements in physics and ethics on Western scholasticism: "One can easily imagine how these works [by Maimonides] were welcomed by the Scholastics in their time; Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas made frequent use of them."53 This gives us the key to understanding the final distinction by which Ten nemann summarizes virtually the entire Enlightenment discourse on Jewish thought. According to this distinction, the philosophia haebraeorum comprised the older traditions of Jewish thought. Since they provided humanity's "oldest ac counts of creation, government, and the genesis of good and evil," they gave only philosophemes but not a philosophy.54 After this early stage we have to discern a transitional period in the philosophia haebraeorum when its "oriental imagina tion was transformed into philosophy thanks to the platonic philosophy alone" (such as Philo and so on). Finally, Tennemann claims, we are to distinguish a third period, namely the later period of "Judische Philosophic," reaching from medieval times to early Modernity. VI. THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION: HEGEL'S ACCOUNT OF JEWISH THOUGHT The quest for "Jewish philosophy" can be interpreted as a (by)product of the historiography of philosophy in the (seventeenth and) eighteenth century. Under competing models of historiography, historians construed an allegedly continu ous tradition of Jewish thought, a philosophia haebraeorum perennis, establish ing a controversially discussed order of discourse and a specific politics of historiography. Within this historiography, historical and systematic paradigms and patterns kept shifting continuously, opening up perspectives for different, even contradictory accounts of what Jewish philosophy was (and is). One feature of this politics had been the construction of an "oriental philosophy" that Jewish thought could be identified with or distinguished from. Historians of philosophy recognized late-antique and middle-Platonic Jewish currents of logos-theology as the point of departure for new developments in Jewish thought and its inter relation with Christianity. The normative judgments about the historical material proved to be a major, systematic problem?and in the case of the philosophia haebraeorum they even rested on rather weak philological and methodologi cal foundations. The quest for methodological criteria (truths of fact/reason and so on) evoked a general debate on the principles of schematization, historicity, and the canonization of philosophical traditions. This led to a shift from rather normative and data-centered outlines (Horn, Jonsen, Heumann, Brucker) to more speculative and theoretical approaches (Lessing, Tiedemann, Tennemann) to Jewish philosophy, and to the history of philosophy in general. 52.Ibid.,XlIV\,441. 53./&amp;&lt;/., XIII/l, 448. 54. Tennemann, Grundrifi der Geschichte der Philosophie (Leipzig, 1829), ?73, 53.</page><page sequence="17">THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION 549 It was Hegel who wanted to break away from this ground of what he thought were rather unsystematic and doxographical accounts of philosophy. It is strik ing to see how he criticized Tiedemann most, whose Geist der spekulativen Philosophic stands in closer proximity to his own approach than any other of the aforementioned historiographies. Hegel claims, it could be argued, to elucidate the matrix of the history of philosophy, the very "motor" of its development. He tries to introduce a theory that is not just a narration but is itself philosophy?a history of philosophy that itself can claim to be philosophical. He aims at offering a principium from which we can deduce ex post most of the contingent thoughts in history: "The history of philosophy is the history of the discovery of the con ceptions of the Absolute which is its subject."55 Compared with the existing historiographies of his time, Hegel thus takes a new step. Instead of simply discarding their former principles ("scholarship," "order of discourse," "distinction of truth," "interrelation and interculturality"), he maintains that the very foundation of all these hermeneutic principles is the systematic "discovery of the conceptions of the Absolute." This pattern guides Hegel's account of Jewish philosophy. Like Leibniz and Lessing, he emphasizes that the main achievement of the philosophia haebraeorum was to perceive God as the One Substance, and, what is more, not as a natural power (as in paganism) but as pure "Spirit" or "Mind." This God, however, belonged "only to Abraham and to his seed;" he was an "exclusive One."56 "Before him all other Gods are false." To this, Hegel objects that "the distinction between true and false is quite abstract since it forgets to acknowledge that a ray of light even shines into the false Gods."57 Jan Assmann has recently attacked the "Mosaic distinction,"58 which, as he shows, created the cycle of the "counter-religion" in Western history, in which one religion's belief system is "true" while all others are false. Hegel, by con trast, says: "However erroneous a religion may be, it possesses truth, although in a mutilated phase (auf verkummerte Weise)."59 This applies to the history of philosophy as well. Whereas the historiography of the Enlightenment argued on the basis of a "Mosaic distinction," where some philosophical traditions are false (and therefore excluded), and others are true (and hence included), Hegel calls for a more inclusive pattern. In accordance with Schiller's famous Antrittsvorlesung on Universal History, Hegel emphasizes that no step in the intellectual develop ment of human knowledge should be regarded as superfluous (as, for example, Heumann did with respect to the philosophia haebraeorum). The second intellectual advance Hegel attributes to Jewish philosophy is with regard to the subjectivity of the One substance. Jewish thought was not alone in 55. G. W. F.

Hegel, The Philosophy of History, 246.</page><page sequence="18">550 DIRKWESTERKAMP introducing the idea of the One. But whereas the Platonic and neo-Platonic to hen is impersonal and beyond human knowledge, Jewish thought invented a personal One: "It is precisely this subjectivity that constitutes this progress as compared with Persian religion: the Persian power of light is an impersonal unity, that which is One, while the Jewish God is personal, he who is One."60 Hegel's for mulation apparently refers to the Greek conception of to hen. In the Parmenides, Plato states that the One is an absolute identity we cannot name, nor define, nor know, nor grasp (Parm. 142a). Naming, defining, and so on a priori means to apply difference to something that is above all difference. To a certain extent, this also holds true of the notion of the Jewish God who is unnamable, undefinable, unknowable. But unlike the neuter Greek hen, the Jew ish One is personal (and the Hebrew language has no neuter gender), so that the subjectivity of personalization, as Hegel termed it, can be traced back to the very roots of the Greek language (used by the Jewish philosophers Aristobulos and Philo), and is the move from to hen to ho hen. Philo and Numenios also speak of to on and ho on. If this progress from the impersonal to hen to the subjective ho hen is an achievement of Jewish thought, how would the Jewish philosophers then solve the implicit logical problem, namely, the question of how the transcendent One who, as Plato said, is "beyond being" (epekeina tes ousias) can be related to the world of being? How can this transcendent identity produce difference (the world) without becoming different in itself? Hegel's argument against the neo Platonists (who held for an emanation theory) is that it cannot. A principle of dif ference had to be introduced into the world of thought (since it was already there in the "real" world). And this (principle of) difference, Hegel claims, is the logos: the creating and acting word of God that becomes another person. With regard to Assmann's "Mosaic distinction" between true and false religion we might term this principle the "Philonic distinction" relating to an identity of identity (self) and difference (other) within the monotheistic conception of god. Hegel makes quite a remarkable claim here. He gives the philosophia haebrae orum the credit for introducing the logos into the realm of monotheism. Philo's logos-philosophy implemented a difference, an inner dualism into monotheism itself. This implies further that even before the Christian logos came, the philos ophia iudaeorum had formulated the philosophical principle of the second period in the history of philosophy: Thus,... in Philo the on [being] is the first, the inconceivable, the uncommunicative, un namable, amethektos God; likewise with a number of neo-Platonists. The second is the Logos, especially the nous, the self-revealing, self-emerging God, the horasis theou [the form/vision of God], the sophia, logos, then the archetype of humanity, this man who is the impress of the heavenly and eternal revelation of the hidden Godhead?phronesis, Chokma.61 Hegel stresses that Philo?even before Jesus, let alone Christian philosophy, had made his appearance?termed the logos the "Son of God"62 and introduced a con 60.

Only with this move could Philo bridge the gap between the concept of God as the absolute One (a concept Hegel terms as "abstract" or "deficient" [mangelhafi]63) and God as a living God. In this respect, Hegel anticipated some of the questions discussed in current re search. Maren Niehoff64 and Daniel Boyarin have shown how logos-theology was an important current in pre-Christian Jewish thinking. Boyarin has also empha sized that Philo's philosophy perceived the logos (or memra, in Hebrew) as a sub stance of its own, whence a binitarian structure would have been attributed to the Jewish God. Boyarin then attacks those scholars who believe that Philo used the word logos (or memra) as just another name for the transcendent God himself: It seems not to have occurred to any who hold this view that it is fundamentally incoher ent and self-contradictory. Surely, this position collapses logically upon itself, for if the Memra is just a name that simply enables avoiding asserting that God himself has created, appeared, supported, saved, and thus preserves his absolute transcendence, then who, after all, did the actual creating, appearing, supporting, saving? Either God himself, in which case one has hardly "protected" him from contact with the material world, or there is some other divine entity, in which case the Memra is not just a name.65 What Boyarin says seems to be exactly the point that Hegel made. Philo intro duced the concept of another logos as a second person, created by the father (that is, identical with him) but at the same time independent from (and thus nonidenti cal with) him. According to Hegel's implicit argument, it was not Christian but Jewish philosophy that made the difference in late-antique thinking. Philo is, as Hegel says, "Plato in Moses," that is, he combines both worlds: philosophia grae canica and philosophia haebraeorum. Whereas Hegel assigns so much weight to Philo's philosophy, he depicts medi eval Jewish thought as a "noteworthy" but by and large obsolete trend. This has to do not least with the general lack of knowledge and the disrespect Hegel had for medieval and scholastic thinking?be it of Christian, Jewish, or Muslim origin. The crucial point, however, is not a lack of medieval scholarship, but a principle theoretical argument: Hegel refuses to see any major progress with regard to the development of a new "Prinzip" (which would have been the principle of the identity of difference, the "Philonic distinction"). This is why he claims that the medieval Jewish thinkers all in all remained on the epistemic level of Philo and the Fathers of the Church.66 As Hegel repeatedly parallels the Jewish thinkers with the Fathers, we notice that he is not intending to link the development of thought primarily to a certain form of religion but to the unfolding of a triadic set of prin ciples of which the "Philonic distinction" is the second one. As for Maimonides, Hegel closely follows the outlines of Tiedemann and Tennemann. But he opposes the view that Maimonides was a Kabbalist. "To the contrary," Hegel remarks, "we find in Maimonides a very strict and abstract 63. Ibid., 23. 64. M. Niehoff, "What Is in a Name?

Hegel, Vorlesungen iiber die Geschichte der Philosophic, 131.</page><page sequence="20">552 DIRK WESTERKAMP metaphysics that, in a philonic manner, gets associated with an explication of the Mosaic books."67 "Abstract metaphysics" is a label Hegel primarily uses with regard to "rationalistic" trends in philosophy. He also employs it as a title for the metaphysics of substance: certain qualities are rationally attributed to or denied a substance but not conceptually developed out of the substance itself. This is, Hegel claims, true of Maimonides' conception of the attributes. His critique of Maimonides echoes (following Fichte) the more general critique of negative the ology expressed in the Science of Logic. Fichte challenged the traditional concept of the I as a substance consisting of certain qualities and attributes by showing that there is no I and no substance prior to its attributes. Hegel applies this view to his conception of the Absolute. There is no substance anything could be attributed to or with respect to which anything could be denied. The Absolute is in itself the subject (not the substance) of the attributes of which it consists. Therefore the many attributes are as true as the One that reproduces itself through them. Hegel finds the opposite view in Maimonides: "It is expressed [in Maimonides' More Nevochim] that God is One, but only insofar as the many are untrue and only the self-reproducing and dissolving One is truth."68 The medieval thinkers and their "abstract metaphysics" prove to Hegel that Jewish philosophy had its moment in history. It established the first princi ple (identity) and introduced (as the historiography of Enlightenment failed to show) the second principle (difference) of philosophical reasoning. Hegel also adds more recent Jewish philosophers to the chart (Salomon Maimon and Moses Mendelssohn). But even though his account of Maimonides' philosophy is, in the wake of Tiedemann, rather sympathetic, it seems clear that, according to Hegel's system, the theoretical resources of Jewish thought have been exhausted by the "Middle Ages" (a term that is, we should remember, useless with regard to the Arabic-Muslim traditions of thinking). While it is the task of early modernity to attempt to reconcile identity and differ ence, in which process God will become more and more intelligible to humanity, this task can be accomplished only through a trinitarian approach. According to Hegel's philosophy of mind, this is identical with the process of acknowledging the freedom and productivity of the human mind. It therefore also represents progress in the conception of freedom. In this respect, Hegel is an adherent of Leibniz: philosophy and science initially had to learn how to think the concept of identity, then to develop a concept of difference; finally they came to grips with thinking an identity of differences. Within this process the abstract substance (God as the identical substratum of endless attributes) became a concrete subject (God as a self-revealing mind that produces and reproduces itself through its attributes). VII. ORIENTALISM, LOGOS-THEOLOGY, AND THE JEWISH HEGELIANS It is peculiar that the Jewish Hegelians should not simply have sought to refute Hegel's trinitarianization of the history of philosophy, but that, quite on the con trary, they made a bold attempt at integrating Jewish history of philosophy with 67.

From a systematic point of view, such a re formulation in the vein of Hegel would have to demonstrate (1) that Jewish phi losophy is not the philosophia haebraeorum of the past, envisaged by the eight eenth-century historians of philosophy, but that there is historical continuity to it as well as a philosophical potential as yet inexhausted; and (2) that this is so exactly because Jewish philosophy took part in the general shift from substance to subject metaphysics. It was indeed these two points that Nachman Krochmal and Samuel Hirsch sought to substantiate, the former pursuing a more historical ap proach, (that is, elaborating on [1]), the latter taking a more systematic stance (and therefore concentrating on [2]). As the cogency or otherwise of their arguments cannot be discussed here, we shall confine ourselves in what follows to outlining very sketchily a few of their most important ideas. Krochmal, who explicitly adopts the construction given by Hegel, sets out in his More nevukhe ha-zman (1840-1851), Guiding the Perplexed of the Modern Age, to argue against Hegel that Jewish thought, in contrast to other religious or mystico-philosophical manifestations of "oriental" thought, has never disap peared. Judaism still exists, as does Jewish philosophy, which not only has a vivid, philosophically productive past and present to offer, but also has a relevant future ahead of it.69 Further, an adherent of Krochmal, disciple of Spinoza, and left-wing Hegelian, Moses Hess (1812-1875) followed closely the trail of Hegel's philoso phy of history, but amalgamated it, in his Die heilige Geschichte der Menschheit (1837), The Holy History of Mankind, with a Judaeo-political messianism. In or thodox Hegelian terminology, he observed that the "schism of mankind" persist ing since the days of the destruction of the second temple could only be redeemed by a new Jerusalem and a universalistic, inclusive "religion of truth," which were to become the foundation of a future union of nations.70 In his voluminous Die Religionsphilosophie der Juden (1842), Samuel Hirsch, too, depicts the future as a time when a universalistic, "absolute religiousness" will reign and confessional differences lose their importance. Going further than Krochmal, and in an endeavor to underpin Krochmal's findings, he argues that the tendency to subjectivate the Absolute?a tendency reserved by Hegel for philosophy of a Christian breed?is no less alive in Jewish philosophy. Hegel's achievement in the Science of Logic, namely, the explication of the Absolute as absolute subjectivity, was anticipated according to Hirsch in the "absolute phi losophy" of the Jews. To dismiss the habitual association of Jewish thought with substance metaphysics, Hirsch takes two steps. First, he lends unreserved support to Hegel's critique of Spinoza, expressed in his logic of essence: "Spinoza's point of view was equally insufficient ... the substance is only the abstract general, the indeterminate?for every determination of the substance would be a negation of the same."71 This is what Hirsch, recurring to Spinoza himself and his famous definition in his Letter no. 50, objects to in Spinoza. 69.

The explosiveness of his statement is by no means defused by the touch of irony with which he presents it: "The Hegelians think what a shame it must be for the Jews not to have a trinitarian God. But? Gentlemen!?the Jewish God is trinitarian in the Hegelian sense. And this is so because we believe in him as in a living God. We do not believe in him as in an Indian Brahma, or a Persian Zeruane Akrene, or an Egyptian Reith, nor even do we believe in him as we would in a Greek fatum?m Hirsch thus keeps faithfully to the successive stages in Hegel's construction of religious history: China, India, Buddhism, the Persian religion of light, Egypt, and Greece; but, like Krochmal, he detaches the Jewish religion from "oriental" thinking, and shows it to be a historical as well as transhistorical "moment" (as Hegel would put it), that is, a factor existing in each and every epoch in the development of the absolute spirit or mind. The same goes for Jewish philosophy, which, to the Jewish Hegelians, is no longer the philosophia haebraeorum of old to be subsumed under the philos ophia extra-graecanica and banished to the prehistory of philosophy, but on the contrary is the only thinking that in all three periods?the period of substance (identity of God), the period of the logos (difference), and the period of the spirit or mind (identity of identity and difference)?was able to vitally contribute to the definition of the Absolute. By the time the Jewish Hegelians undertook to rehabilitate, with Hegelian terms, their own tradition against Hegel, "orientalism"74 was already a firmly established historiographical term. But as such it was merely a name for a deep ambivalence extant in the realm of the history of ideas, where, on the one hand, tribute was paid to "oriental knowledge/education (orientalische Bildung)" as the cradle and "original harmony" of all European knowledge, the admired "center from whence religion, art, and science emanated and spread to all places and periods of mankind,"75 while on the other hand, "orientalism" and "oriental philosophy"76?on which Hegel lectured in 1825-1826?stood for those alleg edly obsolete currents of thought that had long ago been left behind by a largely secularized, early-modern philosophy. Of course, neither for Hegel nor for the Enlightenment historians of philosophy did there exist any oriental thinking still capable of being taken seriously as such; needless to say, they did not study phi losophizing contemporaries from the Near and Middle East. Instead, the polemi cal term was used to unearth the, as it were, unenlightened relics of substance metaphysics in European philosophical discourse. Hegel was sure he could break loose from Spinoza's concept of substance the sediments of an oriental and early Greek conception of the One: "It is the oriental outlook that has first expressed 72.

Jewish Hegelianism could not escape this trend without clarifying its relationship both to its own (allegedly orientalist) tradition and to Western philosophical thought. As we have seen, Philo's logos-theology and the "Philonic distinction" played a decisive role in this attempt at overcoming a historical formation. Logos-theol ogy, the Enlightenment, orientalism, and Jewish emancipation together consti tuted the context of Jewish Hegelianism and its reformulation of a philosophia iudaeorum. The Jewish Hegelians' situation was far more precarious than that of the secular Young or "left-wing" Hegelians, and there can be little wonder that it proceeded from and produced conflicting motives. On the one hand they rehabilitated their own descent from "Jewish philosophy" in order to wrench it away from the negative judgment pronounced by Enlightenment historiographies and Hegel's history of philosophy, and to appropriate it for themselves. On the other hand, they remained closely tied to Hegel's construction of a philosophy and religion of the absolute spirit or mind because, as Samuel Hirsch, a rabbi and Jewish Hegelian, put it in 1841, the left camp of Hegelian philosophy, by criticiz ing Christianity, threatened Judaism as well.78 At first sight, this second motive seems as absurd as the first one looks plau sible. Why should Jewish Hegelians stick to Hegel, who had disparaged their faith as an antiquated religion of sublimity, and relegated Jewish philosophers to the footnotes of scholasticism? Why should Hegel, of all philosophers, furnish them with the categories needed for the rehabilitation of their tradition? The answer seems to be that only a renewed transformation of Hegel's sublation of Enlightenment historiographies was thought to be some safeguard against the undesired consequences of either an abstract substance metaphysics, an atheistic left-Hegelianism, or a Christo-centric philosophy of history. This is why the Jewish Hegelians protested against Hegel's derogation of (post-)Philonian Jewish philosophy but not against his principle-theoretical con struction of epochs. They saw a common origin in the rabbinic, Philonic, and Johannine "doctrine of the logos,"79 and deferred the separation of confessional paths to a relatively late date. Thus, in the first two "post-Christian" centuries a "binitarian" logos-theology developed, whose Hellenistic, Jewish-rabbinic, and Christian components could not be separated but by force; and it was only with the emergence of a rabbinic and a patristic orthodoxy that the subsequent devel opments of thought and belief gradually parted ways.80 Two arguments that are central to, but only implicit in, the texts of the Jew ish Hegelians Krochmal, Hess, Hirsch, and Formstecher can be made explicit: (1) Hegel's principle-theoretical construction of the history of philosophy and 77.

Boyarin, Border Lines: The Partition of Judeo-Christianity (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 2004).</page><page sequence="24">556 DIRK WESTERKAMP religion supports the creation of a Jewish philosophical tradition in its own right, because the principle Hegel postulates for the second epoch?the presence of the divine logos as identical with and at the same time different from the ab solute?is not peculiar to Christianity, but can be seen instead as an innovation introduced by Jewish theologians and philosophers around the beginning of the Common Era. (2) This step enables the philosophia iudaeorum to be detached from the context of a purely "oriental" thinking to be acknowledged as a lively tradition of modernity as well. The Jewish Hegelians seem to have fully accepted the implicit consequence of Hegels's account, namely, that the "Philonic distinc tion" becomes the watershed between "oriental" and "non-oriental" thinking. On the basis of the argument that the categories of difference, spirit or mind, and subject(ivity) are not extraneous to Jewish thought, Judaism?in the words of Salomon Formstecher?can be reconstructed as an absolute "religion of spirit"81 and thereby can lay claim to a title denied to it by Hegel, who bestowed it exclu sively on Christianity. VIII. THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION AND THE PARADOXES OF HISTORIOGRAPHICAL HOLISM Against the background of all this rich material concerning the relationship of orientalism and Jewish philosophy in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, general issues and problems not only of philosophical historiography can be brought into much sharper focus. We have seen that the academic discourse about "Jiidische Philosophic" (Brucker) arose from an interest in reviewing virtually all the philosophically relevant currents of the past. This enterprise can be referred to as historiographical holism. Its impulse is directed at collecting as completely, ordering as systematically, and judging as critically as possible all that has ever been thought in the field of philosophy?in this case, at drawing up a "history of Weltweisheit according to the succession of times."82 In this context any alien philosophical tradition, be it Chinese, Indian, Jewish, or Arab, in brief the whole philosophia extra-graecanica, is bound to pose a com plex problem: is it part of what the Greek and Latin West used to call (and still does call) "philosophy"? Does it belong to the fringes of the philosophy of Greek provenance, or should it be excluded from the sphere of philosophy altogether? These questions lead historiographical holism straight into an obstinate herme neutic circle. For in the case of the philosophia iudaeorum it must presuppose a concept of "Jewish philosophy," while leaving it to its own selective historical narration to prove that philosophy's existence. The quest for such categorizations of philosophy as "oriental," "islamic," "Christian," and so on thus reveals a his toriographical incompatibility between universalism and particularism, which has remained a virulent problem even in today's discussions. The minimal consensus established in the early Enlightenment and valid, in a sense, up to this day was to the effect that if Jewish philosophy is taken to be the study of Jewish traditions 81. S. Formstecher, Die Religion des Geistes (Frankfurt am Main, 1841), 99. 82. G. W. Lodtmann, Kurzer Abrifi der Geschichte der Weltweisheit nach der Ordnung der Zeiten (Helmstedt, 1754).</page><page sequence="25">THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION 557 and religious teachings by Jewish philosophers, then we have a definition where the definiendum is presupposed in the definiens, leaving unexplained what makes Jewish philosophy a philosophy in the first place. Historiographical holism therefore ought to have elaborated a concept of what it was going to understand by philosophy. The fact that it failed to produce an unambiguous definition also led, with fateful consequences, to the other paradox mentioned above, which can be traced back to the systematics of inclusion and exclusion. Historiography, the construction or "building" of a history (be it of philosophy or otherwise), always implies selection. Its philosophical challenge accordingly lies in justifying the selection criteria and reasons for distinction em ployed in the process. But even well-founded and plausible criteria are liable to have the undesired consequences of a "Mosaic distinction" between philosophi cal and unphilosophical strands of thought. For "Jewish philosophy," conceived of as a continuous and homogeneous tradition of Jewish thinking reaching from the patriarchs through Philo and Aristobulos to modernity, is the product of a con structing activity that, by establishing exclusive criteria, creates its own object. Insofar as this object, that is, "Jewish philosophy," has been invented for practically no other purpose than that of being excluded, it is particularly the typology of orientalism, caught in the intersection of Enlightenment and Jewish philosophy, that acquires a special, potentially explosive, importance. The histo riographical constructions of eighteenth- and nineteenth-century philosophy feel bound to the issue of truth. Put differently, historiographical inclusion and exclu sion are aimed at discerning the truth. To that end, Leibniz's distinction between truths of fact and truths of reason provided a decisive tool, raising markedly the overall level of reflection by substituting principle-theoretical justifications for normative and confessional ones. In a certain way, though, Leibniz's distinction reinforces the hermeneutic circle, for it highlights yet another paradox: how can philosophy's manifold historical insights lay claim to truth, when they turn out to be truths of fact not truths of reason? Are there any truths that have evolved historically but that are nonetheless reasonable a prioril In short: can the truths of fact be ultimately reduced to truths of reason? A further irritation lies in the fact that the truths of fact are at the same time cultural truths, which raises the ques tion of how an emphatic concept of truth can be upheld in view of the existence of culture-specific truths of fact? Must not the acknowledgment of a plurality and interrelatedness of cultures and religions necessarily weaken one's own religious and philosophical truth claims? "Scholarship" (C. A. Heumann) and the "examination of truth" (G. Horn) have both been identified as principles of the early Enlightenment's philosophical historiography. They converge in the category of memory. Assuming that tradi tions are constructed, however, memory cannot be conceived of as an archive; it is more of a productive faculty of historical imagination. The recollections retain their mental presence only if they necessitate confronting one's own tradition and present. This brings the different forms and concepts of historiographical memory into play, which can be distinguished and described more accurately following new research about cultural memory.</page><page sequence="26">558 DIRKWESTERKAMP The crucial form is that of a "hot" or "counter-present" memory whose con tent is not an object of contemplation but of action, of a practice that follows an agenda of change. It was precisely with a view to Jewish and Islamic thought that the cultural mnemonics of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries developed different strategies and types of historical recollection. The one that was essential for remembering orientalism and Jewish philosophy was what one could term historiographical retrojection, meaning that, on a metahistoriographical level, hot memory?whose evocation of the past is driven by an interest or agenda for the present?turns, as it were, into a retrojection of the present onto the past, with the aim of proving its own originality and thereby greater closeness to the origin of truth. There is a metaphorical interplay here between the categories of space and time. In the historiographical discourse of the Enlightenment, historical earli ness was usually synonymous with a systematic proximity to truth. For in the prehistoric beginnings of history the principles still seemed to be held together in a pure and intact, if undeveloped, way, whereas historical development went along with an ever-increasing dispersal of what had originally belonged together. It was this belief, too, that nourished the interest in and partial esteem of "oriental knowledge" (Bildung). The faculty of judgment, which brings forth the criteria for inclusion/exclusion, was set out by pre-Hegelian historiographical discourse as a scholarly faculty, and the truth of its judgments was measured by the erudite historian's scope and depth of knowledge and penetration. This conception of a historical faculty of judgment underwent a change in the post-Kantian context, becoming more com plex and presenting itself first as a determining and reflecting faculty of judgment and then as the counter-present function of a historical-philosophical memory that followed the critical motive of a "liberation through remembering."83 This is, in rough outline, what may be called the programme of the "Wissenschaft des Judentums," established in the nineteenth century, and of Jewish Hegelianism, its hitherto largely unexplored companion. We are dealing here with a phenomenon of "counter-tradition," where a counter-memory is created in order to bring to light the distortions brought about by traditional and Euro-centric interpretations of historical events, sources, and texts, and to replace them by its own reconstruc tions. Put another way: it was around the middle of the nineteenth century that Jewish philosophy gained a part of the public control over the discourse about its own tradition. Jewish Hegelianism is hence the very moment where the whole dialectics of historiographical holism takes shape. The habit of constructing other traditions runs out of time when previously marginalized strands of tradition start speaking for themselves and taking historiography into their own hands. Not until this has happened will a true juxtaposition of traditions become possible, in which all of them may point, in mutual openness and respect, to the blind spots of the others' historiographical constructions. If we want to be able to reflect and mend our own limitations as well as the distortions we inflict on "other" traditions, we have to 83. J. Assmann, Das kulturelle Geddchtnis (Munich: C. H. Beck, 1997), 85.</page><page sequence="27">THE PHILONIC DISTINCTION 559 introduce into historiography a reciprocal perspectivism whose universalism will not simply turn the tables, but press for suspending the historiographical logic of inclusion and exclusion altogether. This lesson, one may argue, cannot be learned from the "Mosaic," but only from the "Philonic," distinction. Christian-Albrechts-Universitdt</page></plain_text>
