<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND COMMENTS Psychological Concepts and Linguistic Restraints IT is often observed that an important part of the meaning conveyed by words and phrases derives from the context in which they are commonly used. Not infrequently the meaning is associated with imagery of particular types of events as in the phrases, ' These experiences made a deep and lasting impression upon him', and 'His arrival interrupted the flow of discourse '. It may be expected therefore, that difficulties will arise when words are used in special contexts, different from those with which the word is usually associated. The words in everyday use have developed in association with the needs and adjustments of human beings who are assumed to be conscious and capable of purposive behaviour. Verbs such as 'strive ', ' search ',' hope ', 'pursue ', 'succeed ', 'follow ', and 'continue' are quite consistently used in describing human behaviour and so too, nouns such as 'sorrow ', 'sad- ness ', 'remorse', ' regret', 'expectation' and 'anticipation', or any other derivative parts of speech. In the literature of psychology, however, certain specialised assumptions are sometimes made where there is a conflict between the normal usage or meaning and the assumptions. These include: (I) Dfficulties Associated with Anthropomorphism. Following the strictures of the late Professor Lloyd Morgan, psychologists and biologists generally have been aware of the fallacy of anthropomorphism, i.e. attributing to animal organisms abilities and capacities of intention and experience which may be in excess of those actually possessed. Yet in the description of the behaviour of lower organisms, as in the classic description of Amoeba proteus by Jennings,' phrases and words such as 'the cyst was held so that . .. 'The Amoeba continued to follow .. .', 'did not succeed ', and 'chase', occur; and not unnaturally, for if one tries to write a description of continu- ous behaviour but on the understanding that no qualities of purpose and foresight are to be implied, a genuine dearth of suitable words is encountered. (2) Linguistic Dfficulties of Behaviourism. Similar problems arise if the description of human behaviour is to be in conformity with some behaviour- istic programmes. J. B. Watson, for example, eschews, 'Psychology as a science of consciousness. ... . The reader will find no discussion of con- sciousness and no reference to such terms as sensation, image, will and the 1 H. S.

These terms are in good repute, but I have found that I can get along without them.' 1 It is conceivable that by observation of human behaviour ' out there ', a number of relatively consistent conjunctions could be established; but if Watson's programme is to be implemented, words which by implication import considerations of consciousness are clearly inconsistent with his in- tentions. Words such as 'try', 'persevere', ' endeavour', 'hope', 'ela- tion', ' disappointment ', 'sorrow', 'sadness', or any of their derivatives are clearly out of place and so too, phrases like 'in order to ', 'so that', 'lest ', and many others, strictures which in fact Watson did not observe. A completely empirical science at the molar level which excludes reference to consciousness might be devised by defining such states as sorrow, disap- pointment and sadness in terms of movements, gestures, and facial expression; but unless at some point, reference was made to introspective data and the previous usage of such words in literature, the definitions or designations would tend to be arbitrary. A related problem is encountered by the plan of the late Professor Clark L. Hull who claimed that, 'The present approach does not deny the molar reality of purposive acts (as opposed to movement), of intelligence, of insight, of goals, of intents, of striving or of value; on the contrary, we insist upon the genuineness of these forms of behaviour. We hope ultimately to show the logical right to the use of such concepts by deducing them as secondary principles from the more elementary primary principles.' 2 It is difficult to see how these deductions are to be made unless at some stage, statements of the invariable conjunction of outwardly observable or behaviouristic desig- nations with intentions and purposes are made; that is, the conjunction of behaviouristic designations with words indicative of intentions and purposes. Very few, if any, invariable conjunctions of particular movements with particular intentions could be made, however, even within one culture; but assuming that Hull had pursued this impossible programme, the same obligation to avoid importing implications of purposive activity in words used in behaviourist designations would occur in the initial stages, and at some stage the behaviourist would need to have recourse to introspective evidence and the words commonly used to refer to it. Tolman's approach to behaviourism which assumes that 'Behaviour as behaviour, that is as Molar, is purposive and is cognitive 3 ... (and) ... as a matter of first identification, behaviour as behaviour reeks of purpose and of cognition,' 4 would enable him in principle to avoid many of the linguistic conflicts of other behaviourists; but it should be remembered that the 1 Watson, op. cit., p. xii 2 C.

(3) 'Production ' in the Causal Relationship. The normal usage of many verbs does imply that the effect is 'produced' by the cause. Sentences such as the following are often noted,' Such a policy only leads to laxity', 'The exercise of authority at such an early age made him intolerant', ' Sustained effort will be necessary to bring about a change', 'He is quite obdurate as a result of his earlier disappointments ', ' The solutions must be warm to secure the best results ', ' His lectures send me to sleep ', ' That grin of his always puts me off', ' The holiday is doing him good '. If, however, the empirical or regularity view of the causal relationship is adopted, the familiar problem of conflict between basic assumptions or viewpoint and implications deriving from the normal use of words is encountered. Hume's statement of the empirical position was, 'We have no other notion of cause and effect, but that of certain objects, which have been always conjoined together, and which in all past instances have been found inseparable. We cannot penetrate into the reason of the conjunction. We only observe the thing itself, and always find that from constant conjunction the objects acquire an union in the imagination '.2 If this point of view is consistently applied there would appear to be few, if any alternatives to the phrase ' invariably associated' when the notion of causal relationship is to be presented. However, the empirical view of the causal relationship is only attained after considerable reflection and it is inevitable that the everyday usage of words with their associated imagery should reflect the unsophisticated view that the effect is a necessary consequence of the cause or that in some way, the cause 'produces' the effect. There is, however, one interpretation of the word 'cause', noted by Collingwood,3 where the suggestion of' production' is less discordant with the empirical view than in the above examples. The implication is that an attitude in a conscious person is attained in response to the persistent efforts of another, as indicated in the sentences, ' He eventually brought me around to his point of view ',' He induced me to accompany him ',' He persuaded me to accept '. It could be claimed that all that is presented in the foregoing statements is the temporal priority of persuasion or inducement to acceptance; but the image suggested by these statements is that of the persistent effort of persuasion contending with conscious and possibly reasoned resistance and for 1 See, Collected Papers in Psychology, California, 1951 2 D.

SMITH this reason, the suggestion that the persuasion 'produces' the acceptance may involve less of a challenge than in some of the cases discussed above. It would nevertheless be impossible to indicate any perceptible connection between the last phase in the process of persuasion and the acceptance or to insert anything between them and in this sense, penetrate the conjunction. 4. Statements Relation to Emotions. Many statements relating to emotional conditions indirectly present or imply a theory of the relationship of an emotional state to behaviour. Statements such as, ' He shook with anger ', ' I was too scared to move', or' speechless with terror ' or' paralysed with fright ', or 'He was so elated that he found it impossible to work ', suggest that the emotional state is a cause of the outwardly observable behaviour; but the form of the emotion is not specified either as a physiological dis- turbance or as a state of feeling. In statements such as, ' I felt so disgusted that I got up and left ', or ' I was so overcome by a feeling of unworthiness that I left as quietly as I could', a state of feeling has by implication, causal status. The literature on emotions and in particular the relationship of emotional states to behaviour is, however, not conclusive on a number of basic issues. The implication of the above sentences that behaviour is a manifestation or the state of feeling and an effect of it would be in accord with McDougall's view 1 but not with the James-Lange theory 2 in which the sequence would be that we see the angry bull, run, and are afraid. Emotional states in this theory are regarded as feelings associated with bodily changes elicited by the external environment. Once again, normal linguistic usage tends to be consistent with a particular theoretical position; but in view of the many aspects of emotional activity, it is difficult to account for the degree of consistency in referring to emotional states which has been achieved in everyday language. For the more violent emotions, such as anger, fear, and sexual excitement, all three indicia, feelings, physiological variations, such as those of pulse rate and blood pressure, and outwardly observable behaviour, such as involuntary and voluntary movements, are assumed to be manifestations of the same emotional state. Indeed some of the movements may even acquire a certain currency such as the shaking of the fist to indicate anger, grimacing to indicate nausea, and rolling of the eyes for ecstasy. Mime and ballet or the unvoiced portrayal of emotional states can be understood and have, in fact, an appeal over a wide range of cultures. In ancient Egypt, the signs portraying anger derived from the picture of a charging bull or an angry baboon, suggesting that some association between introspective data and outwardly observable behaviour had been appreciated in man and was applied to animals. The consistency with which physiological variations, states of 1 Wrn. McDougall, An Introduction to Social Psychology, London, 1923, p. 462 2 N. L. Munn, Psychological Development, Boston, 193 8-see for a good discussion. 226</page><page sequence="5">PSYCHOLOGICAL CONCEPTS feeling, and observable behaviour are associated is all the more remarkable when it is reflected that a given situation may not be appraised by different persons in the same way even within one culture and that there may be differences in intensity of reaction in addition to qualitative differences. With adults, observable indicia of emotional imbalance are often successfully repressed. Again, in terms of much physiological data, it would be difficult to distinguish between fear and anger. In many animal species fear is not always associated with flight. With human beings, there is the much quoted case of' flight towards the enemy ', on the eastern front in World War I. The fact that physiological variations or states of feeling or observable behaviour may be used to indicate emotions may be associated with a certain laxity in referring to them; but it is interesting that unreflecting linguistic usage does support the view that states of feeling are the causes of and even 'produce' behaviour. The James-Lange theory is not without some ex- perimental support; 1 but everyday linguistic usage presents by implication a different view. The foregoing are but a few examples of difficulties of a kind which are likely to be encountered by those who construct special systems in psychology. The connotation of words in common use is often consistent with a long current system of thought and if these same words are used for any special purpose, conflicts between the connotation consistent with established usage and the demands of the new system are likely to arise.
