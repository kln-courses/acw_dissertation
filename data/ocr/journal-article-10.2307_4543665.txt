<plain_text><page sequence="1">200 XIIT.-THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. BBy G. DAWES HICKS. 1. TIIE problem I desire to introduce for discussion is a purely psychological one. It is not concerned with the metaphysical question as to the distinction of appearance and reality, nor, except in so far as the result of psychological analysis may be used in support or otherwise of genieral philosophical con- clusions, has it anything to do with the conception we may form of the ultimate niature of reality. Accepting the view that "phenomenialism is the oile rational attitude in psycho- logy," I propose to ask how, within the range of phenomenal experience, we come to the belief that perceived things or events exist or happen independently of the nmomentary act of apprehension or of the minid, which in and through such acts is conscious ? The further problem as to the import or validity of such belief I leave on one side, as being foreign to the particular inquiry I have here in view. The subject is a familiar one; it forms a chapter in every text-book of Psychology; some recent treatmenit of it, however, by writers of acknowledged authority, makes it worth while to direct attention to it now. Anything like an exhaustive discussion is, of course, precluded; I venture only to touch upon a few points, and to offer one or two suggestions, that have occurred to me in connection with them. Let me, at the outset, try to express briefly and in psycho- logical terms, what it is we liave on our hands, as psychologists, to explain. We begin our inquiry with the relatively mature mental life, as it manifests itself in the process of knowing. We find it capable of drawing the distinction between a content, presented or represented, in whatsoever way, and the act of presenting, or representing. Further, we find it constantly</page><page sequence="2">THE BELIEF IN EXTEl.INAL RE,ALITIES. 201 regardingr the content presented or represented as indicating or pointing to an existeince, distinguishable alike from the momentary act of presentation or representation, and from the content presented or represented. The existence which we ambiguously say is " indicated " by the presented or repre- sented content need not necessarily be that of a so-called external thing; it may be, for exainple, some phase or phases of the inrner life, conceived as an object. But, in any case, the same contrast comnes before us of what is immediately contained in the content itself, and of the reference that content bears to something not contained within it. And if the said reference be to a material thing, then the latter is determined as a real object, external to and independent of the inner life of the perceiving subject, persistent, i.e., existinig when not perceived, identical, i.e., retaining amid changes a certain unity of being, and as forming part of an interconnlected system of similarly real things. Professor Royce, in hlis lately published work, The World and the Individual, designates the contrast between what I have called the content and the reality denoted by the content, as that between the internal and the external meaning of an idea, and our problem is to find the grounds upon whicl the determinations imiplied in this external meaning are based. 2. Confining attentioln for the moment to the process of perceivincg, we may take it as a psychological truism that this reference of the perceived content to an existence beyond it is a feature that can in no way be ascribed to the sensuous elements of the coiltent as such. As factors there, the sense qualities do niot tell the tale of their own origin; they may be impressions, products, reactions on the part of the perceiving subject, or what not, but if they are, their impressed, produced, dependent character forms no part of the account they give of themselves in the perceived content. When, Lor instance, Dr. Ward describes sensations as "one and all intrusiorns, inter- ferences, affections, or modifications of the mental series," he is describing themn not as elemients in actual perception, but as</page><page sequence="3">202 G. DAWES HICKS. themselves objects of thought, as occurrences, that is to say, taking place in the real world to which perceived contents refer. Sensations as elements in a perceived content anid sensations as themselves real occurrenices indicated or referred to by the perceived content are, as Mr. Herbert Spencer, in his own phraseology, very properly informs us, two totally different things.* Or, to put the same point in another way, the relation of action and reaction, if it exist at all, is a relation between the external stimulus on the one hand and the process of perceiving on the other, and not a relation between the external stimulus on the one hand and the perceived content on the other, in which latter no trace is to be found of any criterion that could reveal the presence of such a relationship. But it is the belief that the Content refers to, indicates, a real object, not that the subjective process is dependent upon one, that we require psychologically to explain, and although the latter fact, if it be a fact, may help us in the explanation, it cannot be used, even in psychology, as though its recognition were somehow already implied in the sense-presentation. So far as the content is concerned, the marks of reality and externality, ascribed to the perceived thing, are added to, not given in, the sensuous constituents of the content; they are essentially, even for the psychologist, thoughts or notions, not received data; at the most the latter can but furnish the occasion on which the interpreting mind frames, in however rudimentary fashion, the judgment of external existence; they do not themselves convey the assurance of it. 3. That being so, I proceed to ask, what precisely is the significance for the relatively mature mental life of this predicate "(real," which it assigns to the thing perceived ? What, from the point of view of the ordinary consciousness, is the meaning of the term " reality " ? There can, I think, be no question as to the correctness of Dr. Ward's reply, that its * Prutciples of Psychology, ? 405.</page><page sequence="4">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. 203 primary use is "in antithesis to whatever is ideal or repre- sented." It is in contrast to something else, which is charac- terised as fictitious or unreal, that common-sense experience applies the epithet "real," and this something else is the memory-image or reproduction in idea of the previously perceived object. 4. Evidently, then, the opposition between real and ideal woulbd not be reached, nor the notion of reality attained, except by a subject that had arrived at the stage of mental develop- ment, in which the distinction between a perceived object and a represented object was in some way recognised. It is diffi- cult to suppose that such recognition could originally come about through any difference in the apprehended contents themselves. A perceived house and a represented house, for example, would be described by us in quite identical genleral terms, although we should usually characterise with unhesi- tating certainty the one as real and the other as merely our own idea. But if we were asked to give our reasons for doing so, we should appeal to tests extraneous to what was imme- diately before us in the act of apprehension. Following Berkeley and Hume, psychologists have, indeed, sought to avoid this appeal, and to discern in the respective contents marks which serve to differentiate the image from the percep- tion. The chief difference relied upon has been that of intensity; the sense-presentation, it has been thought, is relatively " lively " and " vivid," whereas the re-presentation is bv comparison "faint" and "weak." It is hardly possible, however, to lay Inuch stress on this contention. In the loing run, it would be found that the clearness or obscurity of the content-and that is what " lively " or " faint " really amounts to-depends, apart from varying physical concomitants, which are not here in question, upon the aptitude with which the content fits into or is contrasted with the trains of mental experience in the midst of which it appears. And these con- ditions are too little affected by the circumstance of its being</page><page sequence="5">204 G. DAWES HICKS. presented or represented to eniable us to draw, in this respect, any hard and fast line of demarcation. As Dr. Ward puts it, " we can perfectly well distinguish the faintest impression from an image, and yet can hardly suppose the faintest impression to be intenser than the most lively image." As a matter of fact, the cases are not few, when, through con- centration of attenitioni the r emembered colntent stands out in more distinct relief than the original presentation, and features unnoticed in the latter are detected in it. Another ground of distinction has been thouaht to lie in what Berkeley called the superior "steadiness" of the perceived object; it is not liable to the " perpetual flow and flicker" of the menmory- imaae. But here, again, it seems to me, the reliability of the criterion is rendered nugatory by the counterbalancing con- sideration that it is possible to keep a revived object for a considerable time in the focus of consciousness, whereas such fixity may be altogether excluded in the case of the original presentation. With reference to both criteria, however, a far more weighty objection is this, that however much one may be inclined to allow such differences in mature experience, they would be less and less discernible the lower we descend in the scale of psychical development. The perceptions with which we start genetically would be crude and confused, wanting in sharpness of outline and entering into a mental life but little prepared to receive them. And yet it is in the comparatively rudimentary consciousness that we must conceive the opposition of real and ideal, in dimii and vague form, somehow to make its appearance. 5. If, then, the marks that enable such a discrimination to be made are not discoverable in the apprehended contents, to wl-hat circumstanlces in the experience of the conscious subject shall we look for its explanation ? In attempting to deal with the problem, two considerations shiould, I think, throughout determine our procedure. In the first place, we should be prepared to find that the notioll of a real thing will bear</page><page sequence="6">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. 205 varying significance at successive stages of mental evolution, and that even in the earlier stages it may express an exceed- ingly complex fact in conscious experience. In the second place, we shouild be prepared to find that the belief in an external order of real things and events arises and grows in strictest correlation with the rise and grrowth of the sub- ject's determination of himself as a self-conscious individual. It can only be in contradistinction to the notion of self, how- ever primitive and rude that niotion niay be, that the concep- tion of what is other than self can come into existence, and the marks by which the latter gradually acquires definiteness will be paralleled by a gradual increase of definiteness in the characteristics of the former. Any advance in clearlness anid distinctness of apprehension with regard to the nature of the inner life will render possible a corresponding advance with respect to the nature of the outer world. We inay expect, therefore, that those mental processes that are instrumnental in building up the idea of individual self-conisciousness will be inistrumental also in building up the conceptioln of external reality. 6. Now, there can be little doubt that the individualising, self-realising factor in mental development is that to which, in its later stages, the name Will is properly given. It is only in so far as the subject consciously determines himself in volitional activity that he becomes and is fully aware of himself as an individual. For, as Professor Royce, in the work- already alluded to, points out, all conscious action has a particular, unique, special aspect; it is a process of selection, whereby our consciousiness passes from ani indeterminate to a relatively determinate content, growing more and more definite in its aims as it proceeds. And it has been to the conscious subject in its function of exerting movement and of bringing about purposive changres in its environment that modern psychologists have turned for those Hiiufsmiittel that enable the discriminiation of physical reality from mental representation to be effected.</page><page sequence="7">206 G. DAWES HICKS. There are, however, two radically diverse ways of approachinig the problem from this poinit of view, and it will be well briefly to indicate the line of argument pursued by each. (a) As representative of the first, I take the bold and carefully executed piece of psychological work of Dr. Julius Pikler,* of whose essay Croom Robertsoin expressed the opinion that it must be seriously reckoned with in any future treat- ment of the subject. Dr. Pikler attempts to develop the well- known doctrine, expounded in Mill's Examination of Hamilton, into a full and consistent theory of what he calls "objectiva." In particular, the interesting way in which he endeavours to subordinate the special question of belief in physical reality to the wider problem of belief in objective existences generally gives to his monograph quite a unique value. Objects are divided by him into the two fundamental classes of those which are capable and of those which are incapable. of pre- sentation. Under the latter, he includes belief in substances, such as the ether of the physicist, which are imperceptible to the senses (amongst which, he might have added, as a more striking instance, the atoms anid molecules of the chemist), belief in immaterial forces, and especially belief in minds other than our own.t Under the former, he includes firstly what he denotes as " the objective attributes of our presentations " (resemblance or difference, time anid space relations, position number, &amp;c.), then, space and time, next the world of material things, further, the objective world of memories and ideas, and, lastly, the objective existence of uncolnscious mental states. Dealing, then, with the class of presentable objects, Dr. Pikler conceives his task to consist in showing how phenomena, which are essentially phenomena of suibjective experience, come to be * The Psychology of the Belief in Objective Existence. Part I. Objectiva Capable of Presentation. t One is reminded of Berkeley's distinction that, whilst the esse of things is percipi, we have not perceptions but only notions of other minds.</page><page sequence="8">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. 207 regarded as objective facts, that is, as subsisting beyond and apart from the momentary act of apprehension. His solution, summarised quite generally, is this:-Our belief in the objec- tive existence of these phenomena is the expression of our belief in the possibility of obtainina presentations of them through our volition. In contrast to purely subjective pre- sentations, which are relatively independent of our will, presentable objects are those of which, through an act of self determination, we can have presentative experience. " The ' would be' of presentation is the 'is' of objective existence." Actual objective existence is conditional subjective existence; it is "presentableness through will." According to this view, Mill's definition of matter as the permanent possibilities of sensations was too wide. Olnly a part of the permanent possibilities of sensation, those, namely, the appearance of which depend upon no other circumstance than our volition, mean objective existeince. Dr. Pikler succeeds in giving plausibility to his theory by a skilful application of it to the objectiva other than those of a physical nature. For instance, we are in the habit of saying a person remembers a thiing, althoug,h it does not happen to be just then present to his consciousness. We express t,his fact in the form that men have certain miemories, or that certain inemories are or exist in their minds; that is, they are or exist outside their actual presenta- tions, they are or exist objectively, and " constitute a peculiar world of thoughts." And we mtean that such a memory or thought is obtainable by the remeinberer, wheni it is his will to obtain a presentation of it. Thus, by exhibiting objectivity " at the first rermiove," to use Croom Robertson's apt phrase, the author seems to render the transition to an external world natural and easy of accomplishment. And he is equally dexterous in pressing the consideration that the most distinic- tively " subjective " of our experiences,-our org,anic sensations, the headachles that afflict us, our good and bad humours,-are precisely those over which we have the least voluntary control.</page><page sequence="9">208 G. DAWES HICKS. If this extremely original and sustained piece of argument does not convince, it is through no lack of ingenuity on the author's part. Several criticisms have been urged against it. It has been contended, for examiiple, that it is a reversion of the genetic order to treat certain attributes oi phases of subjective presentations, as though they were the primary features of conscious experience to which a character of relative independenlce and Gixity comes to be ascribed, the truth rather being that only after apprehension of physical reality has somehow been acquired is recognition such as Dr. Pikler assumes possible.* Again, it has been pointed out that the formula he uses is applicable to two radically distinct groups of cases, and that when voluntary effort not merely conditionls the perceptive process, but actually brinigs into existence what is afterwards perceived, by altering, the environ- ment, presentability at will neither constitutes nor implies actual existence. Although we may break a glass, in order to obtain the presentation of broken glass, we do not believe the glass to be really broken merely because we can break it if we like,t Both these objections seem to me perfectly valid. But the line of reflection pursued above enables us unhesitatingly to reject the view in question onl a muclh more fundamental ground, on the ground, namely, that it assumes precisely the distinction it set out to explain. In appealing to voluntary effort in the problem before us, there is constantly the danger of committing a VOJTEpOV 7rpOTEpOV; it, is especially noticeable, however, in this case. "It is," says Dr. Pikler, " the very characteristic of will that it realises an idea." Exactly; it is only when recognition of the difference between the ideal and the real has, in some way, alrea(ly been attained that the thleory is at all workable. It is true that the authlor, anticipating apparently an objection of this kind, tries * Croons Robertson in Afind, xvi, 102. t Stout's Analytic Psyckology, vol. ii, 246.</page><page sequence="10">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL PtEALITIES. 209 at the end of hiis treatise, to break the force of it, by assumino that volition caT' E'oX7v is preceded, in mental evolution, by desire, which is not accomipanied by a belief in the possibility of its realisation. But by thus transferring the gelnesis of the belief in externial reality to a stage, prior to the emergence of will as he has been usingr it tlhrougThout, le cuts away the support on which lhe has been resting, and is found after all to be virtually advocating, a positioln which he lhad previously regarded as diametrically anltagonistic to his own. (b) " The presentation of external objects," says Dr. Stout, "takes place through those experiences to which the subject must adapt itself if its actioln is to be efficient for the attaini- ient of practical ends." * The use Dr. Stout makes of the phenomena of mental activity, or attention), is almost the reverse of that we have just been considering. The primary meaning of "object " is not for him " presentability at will," but resistance to such presentability; it is, for the primitive colnsciousness, just " obstacle " or " obstructioni," or rather, it is the interpretation which the individual percipient is constraiined to put upon such obstacle or obstruction in the flow of its ideas, in order to render them coherent and consistent. " Were it always possible to attain any giveni perception by first passing through a series of others in a fixed order, beginning, with those that follow constantly upon volition . . . . the (lifference between the physical and the mental would for our consciousnesss be lnon-existenit." t Th-ie cleft in our experience, resulting, ultimately in the differentiationi of the self from the not-self, is to be traced back to the conflict that would arise when two presentations of contrary content tend to appear in tlle same relation to all identical content. In such circum- stances the conflict would only be rermioved by aln act of conscious re-constructioni, wlhich, in the course of developmueint, * 2$anual of Pjychology, p. 326. t MIind, xv, p. 26. 0</page><page sequence="11">210 G. DAWES HICKS. wouild amount to a more or less definiite reference of the pre- sented content to an object existinig in space and persisting in time. For example, " as I sit absorbed in study, I am rudely interrupted by the sounds from a barrel-organ. in the street," and, although tlle antithesis between the continuous flow of inward activity and sensuous presentation may be usually less violently impressive than in this case, it is niever wholly absent. " In so far as the mind becomes definitely awarie of the limita- tionis and interruptions of its ownl activity, it finds itself con- fronted by a problem, which it can solve only by reference to an activity other than its own." " Process within consciousness, in so far as it is not traceable to antecedent process withini consciousness, must be traced to antecedelnt process, which, at the time when it is represented as taking place, ex hypothesi, did not form part of the cointent of consciousness." * This act of constructive interpretation seems to Dr. Stout "an ilidispeii- sable nmoment in the development of the perception of physical reality." But it is " onjly one step," and it is necessary to show not only how we come to posit some agrenicy separate fromi and independent of our own private experience, but also "h how the contents of tactile, visual, and other presentationis come to be apprehended as existing independently of individual thought and perception." In explanation of the latter fact, lhe points to "the chang,es within the field of consciousness," which are "uniformly attendant upon our own motor activity," and to the "similar changes," which " take place of themselves apart from any action of ouirs." " In order," he concludes, " to make our experience self-consistent, we are constrained to interpret the involuntary variations by the analogy of those which are initiated by ourselves. We are constrainied to regartd these variations as due to somllethiing, lnot ourselves exercising a notor activity analogous to our own." t * M1ind, xv, p. 26, sqq. t ibid., p. 34.</page><page sequence="12">THE BELIEF INN EXTEINTAL REALITIES. 2 I 1 7. With the greater part of Dr. Stout's exceedingly valuable exposition, most imiodern psychologists would, I take it, colnculr. It is the first step in hiis analysis that seems to nme the least satisfactory, alnd witlh reg,ard to wlichl I venlture to offer a few words of criticism. That the process of constructive interpre- tatioin, described by Dr. Stotut, represelnts accurately enough wlhat we may colnceive as a famiiiliar occurrence in the relatively developed consciousness, I entertain no doubt, but I find it lhard to imacille that it at all coiresponids to anything we are entitled to assumiie as possible for that early stage of the miiental life, to which the first dinm recognition of a distinction between self alnd not-self must be ascribed. The almost inistuperable difficulties in the way of expressing in suitable language the simpler phases of minid miiake olne hesitate in raisingr objections that are sure to appear captious, but I cainnot lhelp tlinking we are here con- cerned with an issue mlore vital than one of terminology. So far as I can gather, the process analysed with so much care by Dr. Stout involves the presence of factors that already imply the discrimination he seeks to explain by mealns of thein. In particular, I caninot understand how a subject, that has not yet arrived at a consciousness of wlhat is other than self, can be aware of the flow of its own ideas when they are not interrupted, or of its own activity wheln it is niot impeded. Or, in other words, I fail to see how a subject, at this stage, can have attailned that lnotion of its own motor activity, to which, according to the theory, it afterwardls regards the agency, which it posits as giviingv rise to the impediments it encounters, as analogous. Consciousness of resistance to movement and consciousiness of miotor activity seeni to me strictly correlative experiences, and, if any priority is to be claimed for either, the balance of advaintage in this respect would seem to lie with the former rather than with the latter. For, as Dr. Stout himself informs us, the primitive mental life is marked by " the over- poweringc predominance of external over internal conditions," or, as he elsewhere expresses it, " there can be Ino doubt" o 2</page><page sequence="13">212 G. DAWES lIICKS. concerning" its " predomlilnalntly or purely perceptual clharacter." The anthropomorphic tendencies uponi which stress is laid are ulndoubtedly plhases in lmlenital evolution; but that they are inistrumental in giving rise to the lnotion of physical reality seems to mue more tlhaln doubtful. " The anthropomorphislmi of primitive lmlan is," as Dr. Pikler says, " of such a nature that withi every individual it must be uilavoidably preceded by the belief in the objective existence of things." The child, in learning, to talk, is at least as apt to speak of itself after' the anialogy of material tlhings as to speak of mnaterial things, after the analogy of itself. 8. But, if we reject this portioni of Dr. Stout's solutioni of' ouir problem, we may fairly be called upon to substitute in its place an explanation niot liable to the objections we have urged agraiiist his. I would suggest, then, that we should look, for tlle pIrimordial m1arks by wlhich the distinctioni we lare trying to. accounit for coniies about, neitlher to the cognitive nor to the' volitional side of our niature. Not to the former, because, as. we have seen, a presenited conitent as such furnishes no reliable criteria by whichl it can be certainly distinguished from a re-presented content. Not to the latter, because, although the' active, striving element in mindcl undouibtedly comes to be a imiainl element in the development of the opposition betweeln the self ancl the not-self, yet we do not begin by recognising otur own voluintary activity, the recognition of which only being,, possible when there has grown uip at least a rudimentary con- ception of self, anid consequently a correspondingb conceptioii of the not-self. There is left, therefore, the sphere of feeling, and within it, I think, a source of time (lifferentiatinc marks of which wve are in search lies readily to lhand. Many reasons would appear to justify time assertion that in primitive states of miiindl a relatively greater prepoinderance of feeling would be miiet with tlhani is recogniised later. And equally assuired miay we be that the experience of a subject, prior to the stage of any recognition of self as an individuality, would be made up of a relatively</page><page sequence="14">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. '13 much largrer propoition of the vague organic sensations and feelings conniected witb them than would be the case sub- sequently.* Now, in every stimulation of the sense organs, there results not miierely a content presented, but a diffused excitation or disturbance of the nervous systemi, a temporary change in the equilibriunm of the vital energries, whiclh undoubtedly has its equivalent in the mental life in the form of sensuous feeling. These feelingXs play a large and importanit part in senise-perception as we experience it; the probability is they play a relatively larger part in sense-perception as tlle primitive subject experiences it. They coexist, then, with a content, when it comes about through stimaulationi of the selnses; they canlnot be revived, or at least only ilidirectly and to a very limited extent (and such indirect revival would probably be excluded altogether in the rudimentary consciousness) when the content occurs in the form of a representation or a mellmory- image. It seems to me that in this difference we have the funldamental ground, on the basis of which the bi-partitioni in conscious experience, that ultimately takes the shape of opposition between self and not-self, is beguln. Moreover, I believe that to this realm of sensuous feeling, and not to the presented content, we must look (at least, in the early stages of mental life) for an explanation of the fact expressed bv Dr. Stout in the form that "images do not strike the mind in the same way as percepts " do.t The " shock," which " the whole organism" may receive from isensation would be, for the primitive consciousness, almost elitirely a miiatter of feeling. So far as the mere colntent was concerned, there could be for an experience in which percepts larg,ely predominated ovrer images, few occasions for sturprise. But the feelings woiild * I am thiniking here of feeliing, not in Mr. Bradley's sense of an immediate experience, before distinietionis and relations have been developed, but in the sense in which it is now customary to speak of ' feeling-tone." ?

DAWA ES HICKS. undoubtedly possess the most varying degrees of strelngtlh or intenisity, and so from tlhem there would repeatedly result those moments of interruptioii or arrest in the even flow of the subject's experienice, that seemed to Dr. Stout so inidis- pensal)le in the development of the perceptioni of physical r eality. A strong confirmiiation of the view that sen-suous feeling plays the part here ascribed to it is afibrded by the familiar plhenomiielna of Selnse - Halluciniations. In suclh cases, for example, as wheni we seemii to hear a sound though actually sound there is none, the two comnponents, apprehended conltent and corporeal feeling, coexist, although they do not arise in the normiial manner tlhrough stimulation of the sense-organ. Andc by reason of their coexistelnce, and of the subject's misinter- pretation of the abnormlial feeling, what is merely a memory imaoe comiies to have assigned to it all the characteristics of a real object. 9. Thus may we conceive the founidation laid for tlle psychological genesis of the distinction so funidamllental in later iniental history. I say foundationi onily, for I do niot conceive that by this miiealns alolne the distinction could be drawn. But other and more complicated criteria readily associate themselves with the combination of presented colntent and sensuous feeling above described. In particular, every complex state of the innier life which lhas a fairly mnark-ed degree of pleasurable or painftul feelilng tends to incite bodily movement. Among,st the sellse organs, two especially, the eye anld the organ of touch, are pre-eminenitly mnobile, and lnaturally close and initimiiate relations come to be established betweeln tactual anid visual presentationis oni the one hand, and muiiiscular anid motor sensations and feelings oni the other. It is, then, not difficult to trace the line of sequence that coninects the presented content witlh those experiences of resistalnce to bodily movement, whiclh have rightly beeni fixed upoIi as of primary sig-nificance in the psycholooical theory of belief in an</page><page sequence="16">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. 215 external world. I ag,ree with Mr. Bradley that to finid in Rvesistance the one manifestation of reality is unreasoniable, and f;lrther that it is impossible to assume the consciousness of effort or of exerting force as an original element in subjective experience. Could we do so, there would be, so far as I can see, no psychological problem to solve; these assumptions would be tantamount to accepting the distinction we are endeavouring to account for as given from the outset. Not until the con- sciousniess of self has been fairly well established and there has been gradually formed in connection therewith the phenomenolL of the individual will, can such an experience as " the putting forth of elnergy " become a factor in the inner life. But elementary sense experiences connected with the initiation and carrying out of movement would certainly be amiionogst the first constituents of consciousness, and in the way I have indicated I think we can understand how they would early becomle associated with presented rather thani with re-presented contents. In accordanice with the view suggested, we should have to conceive of resistance not as we now, with our highly-developed will and definite consciousniess of indi- viduality, experience it, but strictly as the correlate, or if you will, as the sequence, of bodily imovemenlt, as julst one of those features which comiibine to differentiate a percept from an image. The course of development would then proceed along the lines that bring about the severance in consciousness of the body from the extra-organic sphere. Dr. Stout's insistence upon the fact that in all primitive perception of the Self, it is apprehension of a particular object, viz., the bodilv organism, which is implied, cannot be too strongly emiiphasised. A large variety of circumstances give rise to the severance in question. The constancy of the group of presentations resulting from the body and their uniform presence with the presentations that come and go; the regularity of the experiences resultilng, from its movements as compared with the irregularity of the</page><page sequence="17">216 G. DAWES HICKS. experiences that conle about as their consequienice; the pre- valence of organic sensations, gradually formingc a backgrounid to all our experiences; the feeling;,s and miiotor sensationis, closely allied with the organic; these, and other elements, would be involved in the buildingr up of the "embodied self," or of the selfed body. Andl the fact tllat the body come.s, particularly throuhll the sense of touch, to be itself an object of perception as well as the organ of perceptioln conitributes, in no smnall degree, to the formation of the distinction btetweenl the apprehended content and the apprehending process, so familiar to later experience. 10. The notions we come later to forrn of the thinigs thus distinguished from the body gradually emerge aiid become explicit pani passmt witlh the gradual emergence and explicit recognitioni of the self as an object. We ascribe to things, for example, a persistent anid perinanent mode of existence, indepelndent of our existence and of our momentary acts of apprehension. Out of the miiere experience of resistance alone it would be impossible to get a notion of that sort. The experience of resistance may be, whilst it lasts, an experieilce of persistence, but it is not necessarily an experience of a persistence that must be regarrded as independent of us. An idea may both resist and persist, as Mr. Bradley says, and show every sign of stubborniness; so may a headache, so may the feeling of sleeplessness, but these are not held to be external facts. The notion of external persistence is to be traced, I think, to a far more complex origin. Briefly, the determining, grounds seem to be these. The subject must have reached the stage in which he can recogniise a momentary act of apprehension as a tralnsient phase of his own persisting inner life. In the way already shown, lie would regard each one of a series of preselnted contents as referring to an external existent. Now, suppose he is able to recognriise a sameness in all these contents, and also a difference (of time at least) in the acts of apprehending. The inference, if we may call it</page><page sequence="18">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. 2.17 so, would be easy from the colnsciousness of his own persistence to that of the thing's. In other words, the reference of a series of similar contents to a persisting object is the exact counterpart of the reference of a series of acts of appreheniding(, to a persisting self. To take anotlher exarmple. The recogni- tion of a thing as one or as a uinity amid a variety of changaing qualities is the precise counterpart of the subject's recognition of his own unity and identity amidst a variety of changaincg states or activities. And so I coniceive we night go on, finding for each of the notions by which we determine the nature of external thingis a corresponding notion by wbhicl we determine the nlature of the self. The cleft in conscious- niess miiay widen, and the distinction between the self and the not-self become mnore and more pronounced, but the two factors never cease to be reciprocal and parallel sides of one ancd the saine development. No doubt what Professor Rtoyce calls the "social consciousniess `-recognition, nam-ely, of otlher mliental lives than the itndividual's own-plays a most significant and im-tportant part in that development, for it enables perceived things to be looked uipon as the one common object of all minds, -and these minds ag,ain to be regarded as transitory in reference to it. But when Professor Royce attempts to derive the inidi- vidual's notions of the externlality alnd persistenice of things frolmi this social consciousiness, he is obliviouis of the fact that we have no a pr iori knowledge of the existence of other minds thani our own, and can only arrive at the assuranice that there are mental lives distinct from ours and resembling, then, through the help of the same means by which we attain to a belief in the indepen-cdent and permanent existence of thing(,s. 11. I have said that the individualising elemiient in conscious experience is the conative, and in nothing I lhave becn arguing since do I wish to be understood as retractingc that assertion. When the primitive impulses and strivincgs beg,in to centre round the rudimentary conceptioni of self, and wvill, ini the strict sense of the word, appears upon time seene, a new determirnation</page><page sequence="19">218 G. DAWVES HICKS. is given to ouir primnitive coniception of external reality. At first the apprehension of self is little more thiani the appre- lhension of the relatively enlduringv subject of organic sensations anl- feelings and crude desires. But so soon as, through perfectly intelligible steps, this centre of referen-ce acquires a certaini stability and fixedness, auld tllere becomiies possible the modle of conscious activity wlicil mianifests itself, on the one hlauid, as that of forming conceptions beforehalnd of what shall be, as we say, realised, ancd of brinlging about the realisation, mitdl on the other hand, as that of choosing or selecting amnong a niumber of motives, theni our n1otionis of the external world uniderg,o a correspoindino moidification. On the onie hand, it becomes for us, in a way it would certainly lnot have been before, dIynamic. Bodies are regardedl as exerting force, as standingr to one anotlher in the relation of cause and effect, and later as eveni acting iupon uis, and producing by their action the presentationis in and through whiclh they are perceived. On the other hand, there takes place what we perhaps miiay call a differentiation of our enivironment, a singyling out of individual thingys froii wlhat was before a vaguie anid inidefinite collection. No part of Dr. Stout's account of the perceptioin of external reality, in hiis last boolk, is more adnmirable tlhani tlle extremely suggestive wvay- in whiclh lhe has slhown lhow a thing detaches itself from its surroundings, and colmies to be regarded as separate and distiniet froma otlher tllings, througlh becominlg a, cenltre of interest for the percipienit. Notlhing, that hias here been urrged at all militates ag,ainst that view. All that has been insisted uipon is that, just as we do inot start with a conception of reality as miiade up of isolated, defined, and definite parts, but as a vague and conifuised miianiifold, just as isolation of parts is niot originally given, but las to come about in our experienice, just so do we niot start, on the other side, with an individual definitely aware of its ownl inidividuality anid consciotus of its owni voluntary effort, but witlh a subject tlhat has not as yet lny miiore a conception of itself tlhanI of what.</page><page sequence="20">THE BELIEF IN EXTERNAL REALITIES. 21D is not itself, and to whoma individuality or voluntary effort is not given, but has to be found. And the whole point of the ar,g,ument has been to show that these are niot two processes, but two sides of olne and the same process. 12. I set out with the intentioni of bringing these con- siderations to bear uipon Professor Royce's theory, recently worked out with great originiality and skill, that the whole distinction betweeni wlhat lhe calls the inner anid outer meaning of an idea, or betweeni what I have called the content and that to which it refers, is duie to the difference between a partial and a complete emiibodimlent of a purpose.
