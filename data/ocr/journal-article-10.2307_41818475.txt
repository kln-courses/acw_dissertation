V The Cypriot Collection of the Museo di Antichità, Turin by Cristina SANTARELLI Because of its geographical position, the island of Cyprus has acted as an intermediary in commercial and cultural exchanges between Asia and Europe since anti- quity. In the late Bronze Age (1600-1050 B.C.), it was un- der the influence of the Mycenaean culture, with its main cities Kition and Kourion on the south coast and Enkomi on the east coast. At the end of the thirteenth century B.C., the first Achaeans fleeing from Asia Minor settled in Cyp- rus, giving rise to new cities, such as Sinda and Palaipa- phos. Other Achaean populations driven from the conti- nent by the Dorians arrived between the twelve and eleventh century B.C., reinforcing the predominance of Greek elements in the local art. After Enkomi was aban- doned (around 1000 B.C.), the city of Salamina gradually gained importance; according to tradition, it was founded by Teukros and was the site of the cult of Zeus. It was in close contact with Greece in both the "Cy pro-Geometric" period (1050-700 B.C.) and the "Cy pro- Archaic" period (700-475 B.C.). Palaipaphos, founded by Agapenor and site of the cult of Aphrodite, had a similar development. A sanctuary dedicated to Apollo Hylates (protector of forests) was built at Kourion in the eight century. Around 800 B.C., a large temple dedicated to Hercules was erected at Kition, and it was assimilated by the local Phoenicians to the God Melquart; the first stone sculptures come from there. Clay votive statuettes (like those from the rural sanctuary of Agia Irini) and monumental statues in pain- ted limestone (influenced by archaic Ionic sculpture) appeared toward the end of the sixth century and the beginning of the seventh century. The ruins of the temples of Kourion, Kition and Ida- lion, as well as many tombs from different epochs, were discovered around 1845-1850. Assembling of several pri- vate collections was begun as a result of these discoveries, some of them later becoming part of public collections. The first among them was established in the Museo di Antichità of the Royal University of Turin in March 1847, thanks to the donation by Marcello Cerruti, consul of the King of Sardinia in Cyprus. It consisted of about one hundred objects (vases, sculptures, terra-cottas) discov- ered at Kition and Idalion. Other specimens from various sanctuaries and necropolises were added between 1870 and 1877, donated by the Piedmontese Luigi Palma di Cesnola. After emigrating to the United States in 1865, he became American consul in Cyprus, where he carried out excavations for more than a decade, aimed exclusively at acquiring material to sell on the antiquities market. His personal collection of more than thirty-five thousand pieces was almost entirely acquired by the Metropolitan Museum of New York in 1873, while another large group of objects had previously gone to the Louvre. The items that arrived in Turin thanks to his brother Alessandro, range in time from the Geometric to the late Hellenistic period; detailed comparisons can be made with similar pieces of the American collection, part of which is now in the Stanford University Museum. The production of terra-cotta figurines was flourish- ing in the late Bronze Age (1400-1050 B.C.), characterized by evident Mycenaean influences.1 It continued at the be- ginning of the Iron Age, corresponding to the Cypro-Geo- metric period. The earliest sanctuaries on the island date 1. Female statuette, Cypro-Geometric Period (1050-700 B.C.). 258</page><page sequence="2">Music in Art XXV III/1-2 (2003) from this period. They were the "temenos" type, consist- ing of an open enclosure in the center of which stood the altar, where the rites were performed and the votive offers were collected. This was the form of the sanctuary of Agios Jako vos and, in their earliest phase, the sanctuaries of Agia Irini and Idalion, the origin of some Turin sta- tuettes. They are mostly roughly made anthropomorphic images, which were set in the temple as votive offerings. They portray people praying or dancing, playing the lyre, aulòs, or timbrel. The human forms of both sexes are hand modeled and have a certain plastic vigor, characteristic by a very elementary, almost childish, manner. In fact, the technique used to make them is classified as "snowman". The bodies usually have a full or empty cylindrical form, either tubular or bell-shaped, on which the arms and legs were later applied by hand: polychromy was commonly used to emphasize details of the face and clothing. One of the most interesting pieces in this collection is a curious three-faced figure (cat. 31 2)2 with three sets of rudimen- tary arms bent at the chest in the act of holding and play- ing three flat timbrels; the object's tree-like form resembles the terra-cotta sacred trees used in the cult of Astarte- Aphrodite and Tanit- Artemis in Syria and Phoenicia. Similar figures are often found at the centre of pottery Ring-Dance groups, collected in large numbers during the first archaeological excavations. An aulòs player (in several specimens from the temenos of Aphrodite at Soloi and the Lapithos necropolis) or a tympanon player (from the rural sanctuary of Khytoi) is almost always present inside the choral group (usually three people). In the pre- sent case, the triple structure seems to express, in an almost abstract language, the synthesis of sacred tree and ritual music, acting at the same time as a pendant with the three female dancers probably lost. Two figures of double- flute players (cat. 320 and 321) are typologically similar to the various Ring-Dance groups: in the first one, the instrument appears to be fixed to the face of the performer by the well-known system of leather straps (a horizontal one crossing a vertical one passing around the head); in the second one, the musician's arms are raised in the act of playing and he seems to be without straps. Two timpanists (cat. 317 and 318) can also be referred to the Cypro-Geometric period: the first has his arms together on his chest holding flat a timbrel; the second one has a similar position but the timbrel is completely worn away. Another two female musicians (cat. 322 and 323) hold the instrument in profile with their arms stretched forward. During the Cypro- Archaic period, the island was influenced by the political events in the Near East, includ- ing the rise and fall of Assyrian domination (in 612 B.C.) 2.

This marked the beginning of growing commer- cial activity not only with Egypt but also with Syria and Anatolia, as well as increasing relations with Rhodes, the Greek mainland and the Greek colony of Naukratis in the Nile delta. In addition to the development of ceramics, co- roplasty and sculpture, there were many innovations in religious architecture during this period: with respect to the previous period, the shape of the sanctuary became more complex with the erection of square constructions on one side of the temenos for the culťs priests, as at Agia Irini, Tamassos, and Achna. Another type of sacred build- ing had a free sacellum, not communicating with the courtyard or the enclosure, as at Agios Jakovos, while a more evolved model, deriving from the combination of temenos and sacellum with the addition of further rooms, appears at Vouni, Kition, Idalion and Kourion. A peculiar characteristic of the sanctuaries of the Archaic period is the constant presence of small terra- cottas beside the large ones. They are mostly moulded or wheel-made statuettes of females portrayed in different attitudes, dressed in heavy chitons and adorned with rich Oriental-style jewels. Some of them have musical features. For example, there are various models of a lyre or zither: rectangular (cat. 343), square (cat. 345 and 346), hybrid shape (cat. 325; in this case a man plays the instrument with a plectrum in his right hand, and a strap for the plectrum seems to hang from the instrument). Timbrels are portrayed frontally, held allusively with the arms bent forward (cat. 324), or in profile, held with the left hand and played with the right (cat. 341). A very well preserved limestone statue (cat. 407) shows the timpanist using a technique still employed by Maghreb populations in the Mediterranean basin: the open right hand beats the skin, while the left hand holds the instrument from below with the thumb held against it. The usual Ring-Dance Figures (cat. 352 and 353) are still present, with their arms (often broken) outstretched at the sides of their bodies; they are characterized by clear Ionic influences.
