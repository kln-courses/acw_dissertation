<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW From a Bestiary (for Katie and Sally) Corvidae It is always said that their habits are rapacious, atrocious, deserving repression: all caw and rattle and flash. But mostly they are mistrusted for what is called their arrogance, the way they toss their heads and cry, catching the light and throwing colors all around the disrupted landscape. Everything in safe gray whispers that they are killers and child molesters, even familiars, holding intercourse with strange beings who plot inside the night; as they age they grow cunning, preening the more to win themselves favor and younger lovers. Their demanding songs are harsh and grating, hurled forth from who knows what solitude. Listen: two blackbirds will harass a crow all over the sky. One hunch of a finch's shoulder or a flash from a junco's white-edged tail and a jay bolts off to bounce and bray until he sits blue in the blue night. And: the corvine heart is wary, knows nothing of soft words pleading love. With some luck and food they may live as long as you. Mostly they don't, save the few who sit in bright cages, blue-black feathers furnishing images to adorn our suave philosophies. 294</page><page sequence="2">POETRY Duck Long before the birth of fables the duck was elegant and graceful with long legs and a slender bill, but over long aeons the duck through a fey process no one understands called natural selection developed webbed feet to enable it to swim on lakes in parks and a flat bill for rooting in the muck near sewer pipes. These words are later in the process called mapping the genome, or anthropomorphism. Frog My child, this long metamorphosis out of the light and back to it is never easy; scientists and poets keep trying to capture the impossible still movements in these changes: when the yearning for the changeless moment free from the changing stream becomes, as it will, too great to bear, then consider the Frog, whom I introduce now in this homily. In its youth it flits in the green water and feels the mild universe flowing through its gills, then darts liquidly from fen to moss in a heaven of undifferentiation (though life is prodigal, and waits in great toothed forms to devour itself and write apologetics). Then the great change—sudden, disastrous, disinheriting—grips it: the tail falls, the gills absorb (there are no verbs for these processes) and it finds itself thrust into a squat croaking body that it must contemplate and hoarsely proclaim all the remainder of its days. When you are tempted 295</page><page sequence="3">THE CENTENNIAL REVIEW to think your youth never prepared you for what was to follow remember the Frog. All those stories about changeling princes and princesses and the quests for shifty knowledge you used to read have been attempts to deal with these matters. Gar The gar's name says this fish is like a spear though research makes it incompletely clear whether the Angles, loving warrior's fame, thought the fish's habits earned the name or that his wroth analogized the weapon which such as Hrothgar used to wreak upon his foes that fatal stroke where wyrd and wrath had conspired to make heroes of them both. What has the predacious gar to do with this? Has etymology consumed the fish? No indeed, for the gar may yet be found lurking in Hrothgar like an old wound where the etymon supplements the trace the fish and warrior bear in their own ways of the wild old naming. The gar still waits like Grendel in his lair: it is his fate to manifest in this tale that all names persist in dispersing special claims (indeed they do, though Hrothgar wears away in one named, lately, Roger—called R. K.) 296</page></plain_text>
