<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES, December 2000 The Cowboy and the Dandy: Crossing Over from Romanticism to Rock and Roll. By Perry Meisel. New York: Oxford University Press, 1999. [ix, 156 p. ISBN 0-19-511817-0. $24.95.] It has become commonplace to describe as "romantic" too unreflective a subscrip- tion to the ideologies undergirding the investment of rock and roll with cultural and political meaning. Perry Meisel's The Coiwboy and the Dandy: Crossing Over from Romanticism to Rock and Roll confronts head- on the question of what romanticism and rock and roll actually have to do with one other. The result is an important book, well argued and highly inventive. Most under- graduates and general readers will find some pretty hard going here; Meisel's prose is imposingly dense and not alto- gether free of critical jargon. But The Coiu- boy and the Dandy should be considered es- sential reading for scholars of rock and roll and of popular culture in general, and it forms an original contribution to late- romantic literary studies as well. Through a broad, synthetic historical vi- sion reminiscent of Susan McClary's Femi- nine Endings: Music, Gender, and Sexuality (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1991), Meisel argues persuasively that rock and roll and its stylistic precursors share with late romanticism a common set of concerns and tendencies. With the cow- boy and the dandy embodying, respectively, the American geographic expansion west- ward and the European aesthetic expan- sion inward, Meisel shows that romanticism and rock and roll are both, at heart, about crossing boundaries. The literary and musi- cal readings that make up the bulk of the book tease out dynamic crossings and re- crossings of a dizzying array of oppositional frameworks: country and city, self and world, black and white, East and West, voice and instrument, tradition and progress, and more. Meisel is hardly the first to explode as hopelessly naive the stan- dard formula describing the stylistic origins of rock and roll: r&amp;b + country = r&amp;r. (This equation has been qualified, complicated, and outright maligned for almost as long as it has existed.) But Meisel's book feels like nothing so much as a vindication of the ba- sic modus operandi behind this formula- tion, an affirmation that rock must be thought of in terms of the constitutive di- chotomies it dances across. The pairing of rock and romanticism is not, in itself, new territory. Most signifi- cantly, Robert Pattison's The Triumph of Vulgarity: Rock Music in the Mirror of Romanticism (New York: Oxford University Press, 1987) discerns in nineteenth-century pantheism a justification for the celebra- tion of "vulgarity," on which rock's aes- thetic and social power is founded. But Meisel's book and Pattison's ultimately have little to do with one another, distinct not only in the basic terms of the rock- romanticism analogies they seek to draw, but in the principal subject matter of their investigations into rock. Meisel's argument turns on a rich collection of close musical and textual readings; Pattison's, which is al- most free of musical observations of any kind, takes on "the idea of rock" (Pattison, x) in the broadest terms. Buddy Holly's recording session with New York saxophonist "King" Curtis Ousley -one of Meisel's many inspired choices of historical nexus-launches his first chap- ter's exploration of black urbanity, which is rooted, as Meisel sees it, in the self- conscious making and unmaking of bound- aries. The second chapter centers on the mythology of the West, pitting the Ameri- can romanticism of Ralph Waldo Emerson (who takes on the unlikely role of "cowboy" in this equation) against that of the English Walter Pater (who plays the "dandy") in an argument that deftly analogizes the interior and exterior frontiers that form romanti- cism's unified field of exploration. These two chapters establish the rhythm sustained in the remainder of the book, which un- folds in a loosely interlocking series of studies dedicated alternately to musical and literary subjects. The third chapter takes on the electric blues of Muddy Waters and Chuck Berry. The next is a playful, loose- limbed romp-stylistically evocative of Greil Marcus's best work-through the his- tory of the dandy, touching on George "Beau" Brummell, Charles Baudelaire, Pater, Sherlock Holmes, and the psyche- delic bohemia of the sixties. Chapter 5 concerns rhythm and blues singers Jackie Wilson, Smokey Robinson, and Al Green, though centering on an interpretation of 358</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews falsetto as a signifier of "doubleness or self- division" (p. 78) that will likely strike many as one of the book's less persuasive ideas. The persistence of play between images of cowboy and dandy in the novels of Willa Cather forms the subject of the sixth chap- ter. The seventh examines Miles Davis's ne- gotiated reimaging, from an urban stand- point, of Louis Armstrong's affirmative vision of the rural south. Chapter 8 reads the "late Romantic inwardness" of Virginia Woolf's fiction as, in reality, "a dialectic between inside and outside" (p. 106). Chapter 9 examines dynamic exchanges be- tween blues and country, between the acoustic and the electric, and between England and the United States in the music of the British invasion and beyond, making its rather sketchy way up to the present. The book's concluding "Coda on Canon- icity and Mythology" suggests that rock and roll may offer our age's clearest vision of a safe passage through the fissured political and cultural life of late-twentieth-century America, holding forth the possibility of a "hybrid, shared culture" that transcends "the tacky and dangerous games of Left and Right alike" (p. 133). At the center of the book is a section of photographs-mostly of conspicuously dandified rhythm-and-blues and rock musicians-whose connection with the text is casual. Though the relevance of these im- ages to Meisel's central concerns is unmis- takable, he does not mention them in the text. (Four of the artists are not mentioned in the book at all.) The collection stands, rather, as a forceful example of the sort of image "essays" that formed so compelling a part of John Berger's 1972 book Ways of Seeing (London: British Broadcasting Corporation). After the fashion of Oscar Wilde, one of the book's key players, Meisel indulges a taste for the well-turned epigram, some- times revelatory, sometimes baffling, consis- tently thought provoking. "No culture," runs a characteristic distillation, "was ever more plainly baseless than American cul- ture is, and that is its only moral advantage over the past, including its own" (p. 132). And elsewhere: "In Romantic rock and roll, American expansion is a Wildean sham grounded not in freedom but in a flight from influence" (p. 10). In hand with this impulse, however, come historical formula- tions of an almost Toveyesque-not to say Hegelian-sweep that sit uneasily at times amid the finely wrought hearings and bio- graphical narratives that make up the bulk of Meisel's argument. Charlie Parker's out- put, for instance, is set forth as a stylistic mainstream around which LouisJordan, on the one hand, and Muddy Waters, on the other, are arranged as "alternatives" (pp. 21, 59), an account every bit as historio- graphically suspect as describing Gioachino Rossini as an alternative to Beethoven (though this has been tried, too). Indeed, we occasionally find musical styles interact- ing in treacherously anthropomorphic terms, as in Meisel's observation that "rhythm and blues may have misread be- bop by overestimating its intellectualism" (p. 21). In light of the range of Meisel's exper- tise, the depth of his historical research, and the breadth of his listening, quibbling over the business of disciplinary orientation feels almost trifling, but it is a difficult mat- ter to overlook. Lurking beneath the sur- face of The Cowboy and the Dandy is a curious image-comprehensible only in terms of Meisel's own distinctive background as lit- erary scholar cum rock critic-of romanti- cism as a literary impulse whose musical implications first become apparent in the popular music of the mid-twentieth cen- tury. Almost surreal, from a musicological standpoint, is a discussion that so deftly ex- plores romanticism's obsession with the boundaries between city and country, be- tween culture and nature, without a thought for Franz Schubert's Die Schdne Miillerin or Beethoven's "Pastoral" Symphony, or, in- deed, without any acknowledgment that music was even being composed in the nineteenth century. More troubling than historical issues, however, are scholarly ones. Meisel's intro- duction seems to situate his study on the forefront of approaches to "the problem of how to talk about literary and musical tradi- tions ... in the same breath" (p. 7). This feels overreaching in the absence of any reference to Lawrence Kramer, to name a single scholar whose work is conspicuously missed. And Kramer is in good company. Meisel's bibliography does not include so much as a cameo appearance from David Brackett, Simon Frith, Richard Middleton, Philip Tagg, Susan McClary, or Robert Walser, all of whose work might have con- tributed substantively to his own. 359</page><page sequence="3">NOTES, December 2000 In the last analysis, however, the notion that a book of this scope and interpretive subtlety could have been undertaken, and undertaken successfully, without the aid of such scholars is not so much irksome as humbling. And to ask whether a text born largely outside the conversations of the mu- sicological community can still be essential to those conversations is, perhaps, to re- hearse the question once so troubling to rocket scientists: whether rocket propulsion can work in a vacuum, where there is noth- ing to push against. Needless to say, the rocket scientists, like the scholars of popu- lar music, have long since discovered the answer: of course it can. PETER MERCER-TAYLOR Valparaiso University Absolute Music and the Construction of Meaning. By Daniel K. L. Chua. (New Perspectives in Music History and Criticism.) Cambridge: Cam- bridge University Press, 1999. [xii, 314 p. ISBN 0-521-63181-5. $64.95.] Not so long ago, the idea of absolute mu- sic functioned to legitimate music acade- mics who were trained to deal only with "the music itself." Defined as music without any extramusical associations, absolute mu- sic required its own professional specialists. That tendency having been pushed to its extreme, it has now emerged as its oppo- site, so that the study of autonomous art music is currently justified by the way it can be related to extramusical concerns. For example, in 1989, Leo Treitler declared that "At the center [of the idea of absolute music] is the conception of an autonomous instrumental music that is essentially musi- cal because it is not determined by any ideas, contents, or purposes that are not musical" ("Mozart and the Idea of Absolute Music," in Music and the Historical Imagi- nation [Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard Univer- sity Press, 1989], 177). Ten years later, Daniel Chua has set out to show that "ab- solute music is an extramusical idea" (p. 6). He seems to relish the turmoil of a disci- pline whose boundaries are uncertain by introducing a potentially limitless number of extramusical ideas, which are tamed into a discourse of absolute music by his master- ful rhetorical and intellectual virtuosity. The short but crucial preface prepares the reader for heavy doses of Walter Benjamin, Michel Foucault, and Theodor Adorno and their approaches of constella- tion, archeology, and dialectic, respectively. Acknowledging these thinkers does not ini- tially give away much, since they have been so influential in recent times as to have be- come practically brand names. Only in ret- rospect was I able to appreciate how pro- foundly Chua has followed through with their ideas. Chua sets himself apart from most other academics by taking seriously the resistance to coherence, synthesis, and totality taught by these writers, thereby putting himself at risk for being read as confusing and contradictory. As he indi- cates in the preface, readers will have to work harder and more self-consciously to "interpret" his own text. He provides the material to do this: there are thorough footnotes, a good index and bibliography, plenty of illustrations, and provocative mu- sic examples; nevertheless, those with tradi- tional expectations of academic authorial responsibility will probably be unwilling or unable to make the effort. The book is "arranged as a constellation of tiny, fragmentary chapters that gather around the object, often in an extreme manner to exaggerate the tensions between the concepts" (p. xi). There are thirty-five of these chapters, each "on" something, be- ginning with "On History" and ending with "On Babel." While the chapters are loosely connected, they do form a recognizably chronological narration of the metaphysics of music from the seventeenth to early nineteenth centuries. The chapters are di- vided into three main parts, "The Garden of Eden," "The Fruit of Knowledge," and "The Tower of Babel"-titles that convey the strikingly religious and apocalyptic version of modernity that frames this his- tory of absolute music. Drawing on Max Weber's writings on modern rationality-so important for both Adorno and Foucault- Chua uses the story of the Garden of Eden to tell how acquiring rational knowledge has cast us out of paradise by disenchanting the world.
