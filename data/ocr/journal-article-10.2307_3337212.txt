<plain_text><page sequence="1">Albert Maesen 1915-1992 It seems appropriate that this edition dedicat- ed to William Fagg should include a testimo- nial to his good friend, whom he admired greatly and who predeceased him by less than five months. Born in Antwerp on March 2, 1915 (less than a year after Bill Fagg), Albert Maesen studied the History of Art and Antiquities at the University of Ghent. He soon became inter- ested in anthropology, a subject in which he was encouraged by his professor, Frans M. Olbrechts, helping Olbrechts to list the Belgian private collections which resulted in the Antwerp exhibition "Kongo Kunst" (1937-38). They collaborated on a book on the same sub- ject, the seminal Plastiek van Kongo, which was ready for the printers in 1940, but not pub- lished until 1946. Bill Fagg acknowledged a debt to this work, in which Olbrechts was the first to approach African art using the morpho- logical method-examining the form of the sculpture and studying the proportions as well as such ethnic traits as scarifications. Olbrechts found an apt pupil in Maesen, whose sensitivi- ty to sculptures was heightened by the numer- ous sketches he made of carvings during his field trips, thereby enhancing his powers of deduction. This vision was invaluable to him during his time at the Museum of the Belgian Congo (later called the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale), Tervuren, where he pro- gressed from researcher (1941) to Assistant Curator (1949), head of the Department of Ethnography (1954), head of the Department of Cultural Ethnology (1962), and Director (1980). All who were lucky enough to meet Maesen at the Museum will remember his charm, his modesty, his assurance, and his boundless generosity which made him share his vast fund of knowledge, especially on the art of the Congo (Zaire), with all who approached him. His knowledge grew out of acute obser- vation of carvings in both private and muse- um collections. Maesen's dissertation was on the Senufo of COte d'Ivoire, among whom he traveled in 1938-39. In 1953-55, with his wife Cecile, he studied over 80 ethnic groups in the Congo, collecting more than 8,000 objects, before returning to the Senufo in 1967. The same year he went to Cameroon to visit the Bamum and Bamileke, and in 1970-72 to Nigeria to visit the Jukun and Mumuye. Franqois Neyt recorded his debt to Albert Maesen during his work on the Luba (Art d'Afrique Noire, 1992, no. 82, pp. 9, 10), as did Raoul Lehuard when he was preparing his massive work on the tribes of the Congo. Others have more personal recollections which Albert Maesen with a guide on the Benue expedition, 1970. 98 african arts * july 1994</page><page sequence="2">they recall with nostalgia. Antonio Ruvolo, who had the good fortune to spend months at Tervuren, remembers his humor, enthusiasm, and lack of arrogance. With a twinkle in his eye Maesen would tell of how the Lele, influ- enced by the "Royal Kuba," considered their Wongo neighbors uncivilized. The Wongo filed their teeth and emulated rituals of the Pende, even carving Pende-style faces on many objects in an attempt to obtain some of the power of the Pende. Maesen decided to investigate, but failed to contact a single Wongo as the villages emptied at his approach. Maesen also told Ruvolo of a Belgian prison warder in the 1930s-40s who instruct- ed his prisoners in the Kasai to rub and to polish the carvings from his workshop with tukula (nqula), thereby deceiving unsuspect- ing potential collectors. With Bill Fagg and myself he remembered a priest in the 1940s who wished to convert the Lulua, who he understood were greatly interested in the scarifications the group no longer practiced. The priest commissioned a figure to be carved with every known type of Lulua scarification upon it: with the statue tucked under his arm he was sure to attract the attention of the villagers. We all admired Maesen's open mind and benefitted from the time he would take to examine a carving, considering every aspect before drawing a conclusion. He understood the demands made upon the sculptors since the middle of this century and how these affected their works. Albert Maesen was a per- fectionist who made copious notes, and it is a pity that more of his knowledge was not com- mitted to print before his untimely demise.
