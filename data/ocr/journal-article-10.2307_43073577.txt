<plain_text><page sequence="1">22 Egypt and the East Mediterranean in the Early Second Millennium B. C. W. A. Ward - Beirut During the Middle Kingdom, Egypt embarked on a far-reaching foreign policy which brought the Nile Valley into direct or indirect contact with every important civilization in the East Mediterranean area. This foreign policy has long been the subject of general state- ments and technical studies which have produced several variant conclusions as to the nature of Egyptian contacts with those coun- tries which lay to the north. For some time, I have felt that a restudy of the pertinent material would be of some value to historians inte- rested in this problem. The purpose of the present discussion is two-fold. First, it is apparent that a sifting of the evidence is necessary in order to deter- mine just what is and is not valid as proof of Egyptian contacts with East Mediterranean countries during the Middle Kingdom Second, some attempt must be made to arrive at tentative conclusions which satisfy the demands of the valid evidence. Unfortunately, the historian is hampered at the outset by the nature of the available material. Prior to the Egyptian Empire period, this material is pri- marily archeological; inscriptions are for the most part restricted to short texts on statuettes, scarabs and the like or infrequent allusions in historical texts. Consequently, no final picture can be gained and, after examining the available evidence, one is still left with the impres- sion that there is more to be said on the subject. Whatever the restrictions of the material presently known, it is at least possible to indicate some general trends in Middle Kingdom foreign policy toward the northern countries. This is especially true of the later Middle Kingdom interest in Syria-Palestine which is related to the influx of the Hurrians into North Syria, a connection which I do not believe has been fully appreciated heretofore. That the Egyptian rulers were aware of this menace goes without saying</page><page sequence="2">Egypt and the Bast Mediterranean 23 and I believe they took specific measures to counteract the threat offered by the new Hurrian power. It is within this context that the Twelfth Dynasty royal monuments in North Syria and the Execration Texts should be interpreted. But to properly understand the histo- rical and chronological complexities of the later Middle Kingdom relations in Asia, it is first necessary to reconstruct as nearly as pos- sible the foreign relations of the earlier Middle Kingdom. Accordingly, I have begun the present survey with the Eleventh Dynasty. Around the middle of the twenty-first century B.C., Nebhepetre Mentuhotep, a local prince of Thebes, succeeded in reuniting a dismem- bered Egypt under a single monarch. (x) Once unification was achieved, Nebhepetre took the next logical step and made the initial Middle Kingdom thrust into adjacent lands, a move which set the pattern for the active foreign policy of later kings. While the Eleventh Dynas- ty was primarily interested in the territory south of Egypt, (2) strong Egyptian kings were always anxious to establish control over Sinai and we should expect such a move on the part of Nebhepetre. Unfortunately, there are no Sinai inscriptions which can defi- nitely be attributed to an Eleventh Dynasty ruler though there are other inscriptions which prove that Nebhepetre did revive Egyptian interest in the north, at least as far as Sinai. In his temple at Gebelein, Nebhepetre left a relief in which the king is portrayed smiting a Nubian, Libyan, Egyptian and Asiatic. (3) Further documentation of this northward push comes from his mortuary temple at Deir el Bahari. One relief in this temple shows an Asiatic bowing to the ground before the Egyptian king though the latter's figure is now destroyed.

Ward Another fragment mentions c;m.w, " Asiatics, " in a badly broken context. (x) A most important inscription dealing with Sinai is difficult to date though it most probably comes from the reign of Nebhepetre. This document is a stela of the Sea-captain Akhtoy from his tomb at Thebes (2) which records an expedition to Sinai as well as military action against the local inhabitants. (3) Though Carter, who exca- vated this tomb, believed it to be of the late Middle Kingdom, Gardiner has put forward several convincing arguments for an Eleventh Dyna- sty date and this has been followed by most scholars. (4) Since Nebhepetre is known to have made contact with Asiatics and the name Mentuhotep written in a cartouche appears among the frag- mentary inscriptions of Akhtoy's tomb, I am inclined to consider Akhtoy an official of Nebhepetre and the Sinai expedition mentioned here as occurring in his reign. (5) Eleventh Dynasty connections elsewhere in the Mediterranean are quite obscure. There is every reason to believe that Egyptian seals and design scarabs found their way to the Aegean during the First Intermediate Period and some of these design scarabs may plausibly be dated to the Eleventh Dynasty.

A stone seal with a light blue glaze found at Tarsus in an EB II-III context is thought to be Egyptian though this seal may be of Anato- lian rather than Egyptian origin; both design and technique are paral- leled at Alishar. (x) Several Egyptian adzes were found at Byblos, the closest parallels to which date to the First Intermediate Period or the Eleventh Dynasty. (2) Egyptian influence at Byblos at this time is now given added support by a newly published Egyptian inscription naming a local prince and an Anatolian inhabitant of that city. The obelisk on which this inscription is carved was found in a deposit dating not later than the twenty-first century B. C. and may well be an example of Egyptian influence during the Herakleopo- litan Period (Ninth and Tenth Dynasties). (3) The available material is much too scarce to allow positive con- clusions but it may be that the Old Kingdom trade with Byblos was not as completely broken off during the First Intermediate Period as heretofore presumed. There was no direct trade route between Egypt and the Aegean; the two areas were connected by coastal shipping routes meeting at Byblos and other Syrian ports. One be used in assigning them an Egyptian origin. Cf.

(*) The only way, then, that Egyptian objects could reach the Aegean was via the Syrian trading ports. If the material mentioned above is definitely of the First Intermediate Period, we must assume that at least a minimum trade with Syria was maintained by local rulers of the First Intermediate Period. If this is true, the Eleventh Dynasty could very well have continued this trade. All this, however, must remain in the realm of speculation until more positive evidence is known. (2) One other piece of evidence may bear this out though I would hesitate to say it is above suspicion. Evans has suggested that an anthropomorphic vessel found in an Eleventh Dynasty deposit at Rif eh belongs to a Cretan type. (3) The Cretan examples are of EM III date which is contemporary to the Eleventh Dynasty. (4) Yet, while the Egyptian vessel is similar to the Cretan type, it is possible that there is no connection. Even discounting the Tarsus seal and the Rifeh anthropomorphic vessel, there still remain design scarabs, the Byblos adzes and the recently published obelisk from Byblos to show that Egypt maintained some kind of connection with Syria during the First Intermediate Period which was doubtless continued during the Eleventh Dynasty. We may conclude, then, that the Eleventh Dynasty reached Sinai and was already engaged in hostilities against the local tribes. (1) The coastal route between Syria and the Aegean is described by Biegen in Weinberg (ed), The Aegean and the Near East. Studies Pre- sented to Hettie Goldman (Locust Valley, 1956), pp. 32-35. The evidence against a direct Egypto- Aegean overseas route is given by Vercout- ter. Essai sur les relations entre Égyptiens et Préhellènes (Paris, 1954), pp. 13ff. (2) The famous lament of Ipu-wer that Egyptian trade with Byblos had ceased may be " editorializing " rather than literal fact. The pes- simistic sage was probably bewailing the extreme diminishing of foreign trade instead of its total dearth. (3) Evans, The Palace of Minos. 4 vols. (London, 1921-35), II, p. 258, figs. 152-53. (4) Weinberg, in Relative Chronologies , p. 90. The seal from EH III Asine (see p. 24 note 6) is here considered one proof of an Eleventh Dynasty connection. This seal shows a swastika design which is too common for positive connections; however, an exact duplicate is in Petrie, Buttons and Design Scarabs (London, 1925), pl. Ill, 152.</page><page sequence="6">Egypt aud the Kast Mediterranean 27 It is extremely doubtful that any land operations were undertaken in Palestine at this time though there is enough evidence to indicate an Eleventh Dynasty tie with By bios. I suspect that the Old King- dom connection with Byblos was never broken at all but was carried on by local rulers of the First Intermediate Period and resumed by the state when Egypt was again reunited. After a short period of internal revolt at the end of the Eleventh Dynasty, the advent of the Twelfth Dynasty saw an Egypt united into a feudal state in which the leading nobles maintained a great deal of local authority, held in check only by a line of strong-willed rulers on the throne. (*) Under these kings, Egyptian foreign relations took on a magnitude which surpassed all previous periods. In the south, the Twelfth Dynasty established Egyptian dominance as far south as Kerma. (2) But the northern connections now take on new significance and Egypt during this period came into commercial contact with the entire eastern Mediterranean. According to the available evidence, Cyprus now enters the field of Egyptian foreign relations for the first time. Egyptian beads and amulets of Middle Kingdom date have been discovered in Middle Cypriote II contexts. (3) This material would have reached Cyprus through Byblos or some other Syrian port since there is no proof of any direct trade with Egypt at this time. (4) No Cypriote material has been discovered in Egypt in deposits dating prior to the Second Intermediate Period; Cypriote White Painted V ware has been found at three Second Intermediate Period sites. (5) Twelfth Dynasty relations with Crete are represented primarily by the statue of a private individual and several design scarabs. The statuette is of some interest since it is inscribed with names (Usir and his mother, Sat-hathor) and two phrases which I believe to be (*) This feudal state was changed into an absolute monarchy under Sesostris III, an event explored more fully below.

(x) The first title is wdpw nb(i), (2) for which I can quote no exact parallels and which seems to be an abbreviated spelling; abbreviations of Egyptian titles are quite common on the objects found outside Egypt and may sometimes be errors made by local scribes writing an unfamiliar language. Inscriptions on scarabs and other small objects are subject to much abbreviation even on objects made in Egypt. The present title could indicate some minor treasury official or, what is more likely, a grade in the goldsmith's guild.

(5) That both objects belong to the same person is highly probable, especially since the title is so rare. The impossibility of defining Usir's titles more closely leaves open the question of the (x) Evans, Palace of Minos , I, p. 288, fig. 220; Pendlebury, Aegyp- tiaca, no. 29. That this is a Middle Kingdom statuette is certain though there is some disagreement as to the specific date. E vers, Staat aus dem Stein (Munich, 1929), II, p. 96, dated the statuette to the reign of Ame- nemhat I; Sidney Smith, AJA XLJX (1945), 4, dates it to the late Twelfth or Thirteenth Dynasty; Vercoutter, Essai sur les relations entre Égyptiens et Préhellènes, p. 76, suggests the Thirteenth Dynasty. The inscription carved on this statuette definitely does not contain the fantastic personal name " Ab-nub-mes-wazit-usir " as heretofore maintained by some scholars; cf.

He suggests an Eighteenth Dynasty date for these objects! Both, however, may safely be attributed to the Middle Kingdom.</page><page sequence="8">Egypt and the Bast Mediterranean 29 reason for his presence on Crete. These titles do not seem to indicate any high office in the Egyptian government so we cannot conclude that Usir was an Egyptian " ambassador " to the Cretan court. We may more properly suppose that he was a goldsmith who had left his native land to seek his fortunes abroad and that he was in Knossos in the capacity of a private individual. (*) Other than the statuette of Usir, the only positive Middle King- dom objects found on Crete are some design scarabs. (2) Other connections have been suggested though all must be used with cau- tion. Hall proposed a relation between a type of piller construction found at Knossos and in the Eleventh Dynasty temple at Deir el Bahari - the lowest drum of the piller was cut in one piece with the paving slab on which it stood. But this type of construction seems common enough in the Near East and should not be considered an example of borrowing or influence. (3) Similarly, a group of copper objects from the Messara have been considered Egyptian but these are ordinary objects such as needles and daggers and are useless as (*) Note the private objects of individuals from Palestine and Syria discussed in the following pages which must also be so considered. While there is no evidence of Usir's being an official of the Cretan court, this suggestion has its merits. Other Egyptians, as I will explain below, served foreign rulers in specialized capacities. (2) Pendlebury, Aegyptiaca, nos. 1-3, 5, 14, 18, 54, 56. Most of these have excellent parallels in Egypt though nos. 3 and 14 probably show designs cut after the scarabs reached Crete. (3) This pillar construction is found also at Byblos and Zendjerli; Montet, Byblos et VÉgypte, fig. 2, Ļuschan, Ausgrabungen in Sendscherli. 4 vols. (Berlin, 1893-1943), IV, fig. 260. Such connections between architectural features are frequently proposed and it is well to regard them with suspicion until definitely proven. Albright has suggested a connection between the ceiling construction of a tomb at Taanach and similar work in the Saqqara tomb of D joser; Sellin, Tell Taanak (Vienna, 1904), figs. 35-36; Albright, BASOR 94 (1944), p. 15, n. 10; Archeology of Palestine ( H armonds worth-Middlesex, 1949), p. 76; Relative Chronologies, p. 31. A similar analogy has been drawn between the large monoliths built into the wall of a tholos at Menidi (Attica) and those over the upper chamber of the Cheops pyramid; Montelius, La Grèce préclassique. Part I (Stockholm, 1924), pp. 160-61. It is higly probable that such architec- tural features are no indication of cultural borrowing at all but represent instead basic features of architectural design that we may expect to find in unrelated cultures. More convincing is My lonas' comparison of the temple-tomb at Knossos with simple Egyptian temple plans of the Em- pire Period; Robinson Studies, I, pp. 101-2, fig. 6.</page><page sequence="9">30 W. A. Ward proofs of foreign relations. (*) While it is often risky to use art motives as proof of foreign relations, a bound lily design and a butterfly design appearing frequently in Cretan art may possibly be considered Egyptian influence. (2) The statuette of Usir, some design scarabs and possibly the two art motives are thus the only Middle Kingdom objects or influences found in the Aegean. (3) Cretan finds in Egypt, however, are more (x) Xanthoudides, The Vaulted Tombs of M essaya, p. 129. This identification was probably influenced by the then current opinion that the art of working copper was first introduced into Crete from Egypt; cf. Hall, The Civilization of Greece in the Bronze Age (New York, 1928), pp. 31 fl. At one time it was customary to see an Egyptian origin for several scientific advances though I am inclined to discount all such suggestions. The art of glazing has been considered an import from Egypt; Hall, op. cit., p. 70, and JE A I (1914), 117; Xanthoudides, op. cit., p. 129. Some have suggested that the art of cutting stone vessels was borrowed from Egypt; Seager, Explorations in the Islands of Mochlos (Boston, 1912), pp. 102-03; Pendlebury, The Archeology of Crete (London, 1939), p. 69. Likewise, an Egyptian influence has been proposed for certain signs in the Minoan and Mycenaean scripts; Pendlebury, op. cit., pp. 119, 141; Ventriss and Chadwick, Documents in Mycenaean Greek (Cambridge, 1956), p. 35 (quoting Sundwall). Now working copper, glaz- ing and stone-cutting are universal discoveries and one would need more proof, than is presently available to assume an Egyptian origin for such advances in culture. And in any hieroglyphic repertoire, where symbols are drawn from items of everyday life, there are bound to be some ap- parent similarities. Chadwick, Antiquity XXXIII (1959), 269, says: " Writing in Crete appears to be an independent development, certainly not derived from the Egyptian hieroglyphs, although Egypt may have provided a model for the growth of the indigenous system. " This statement parallels that commonly used for the relation between Sumerian and Egyptian, that the idea of writing was brought from Sumer but Egypt developed its own system independently; a brief summary of this position in Frankfort, The Birth of Civilization in the Near East (Bloom- ington, 1951), pp. 105-108.

Also later imports are several stelae found on the Island of Malta which have been dated to the Middle King-</page><page sequence="10">Egypt aud the Bast Mediterranean 31 numerous. Middle Minoan II pottery has been found in Middle Kingdom deposits at Harageh, Kahun and Aby dos though the Kahun find may date to the Second Intermediate Period. (x) Some jewelry from the tomb of a daughter of Amenemhat II has been considered of Cretan origin. (2) Finally, in the Tôd treasure of Amenemhat II, Cretan vessels of MM Ila date were found. (3) So much for the archeological evidence. On the linguistic side, there are two geographic terms which have long been used to substan- tiate Egyptian connections with the Aegean world. The first is Huw- nb.wt, "Haunebu, " traditionally understood to indicate the islands of the Aegean, (4) and discussed here only for the sake of completeness since it is now apparent that this term cannot be so used in Middle Kingdom times. Vercoutter has challenged the traditional rendering of this term and has offered a new theory which is far more plausible. (5) Briefly, Vercoutter suggests that in Pre- and Protodynastic times, the Haunebu were the inabitants of the marshes and islands in the Egyptian Delta. In the Middle Kingdom, the term referred to the Phoenician coast, during the Empire it indicated northern coastal peoples in general and in the Ptolemaic Period it was used to desi- gnate Greeks throughout the Aegean. dom. In reality, only one (Br. Mus. no. 233) is of this date, the others are Empire or later; Murray, Ancient Egypt , 1928, pp. 45 ff., and JE A XXXV (1949), 192, n. 1; Hieroglyphic Texts ... in the British Museum, IV, p. 7, pl.

This latter work is indispensible for a study of Egyptian and Aegean relations.</page><page sequence="11">32 W. A. Ward Now Vercoutter's conclusions satisfactorily answer the demands of the evidence and I would only question them on the basis of one factor which, at first sight, is difficult to incorporate into this new theory. This is the complete omission of the Haunebu from the Middle Kingdom Execration Texts (discussed more fully, below). These texts list those places and rulers considered to be potential enemies of the Egyptian state at the close of the Middle Kingdom. The Haunebu were always considered one of the traditional enemies of Egypt, the " Nine Bows, " which are represented pictorially as early as the Protodynastic Period (x) though they are apparently not named until the Eighteenth Dynasty. (2) We may justifiably assume that the Nine Bows were the same throughout Egyptian history and that this traditional list of enemies must have originated in prehistoric times. On the basis of this factor alone the Haunebu cannot be locat- ed in the Aegean in the earlier period since we cannot conclude by any stretch of the imagination that the Aegean islands were known to the Egyptians in prehistoric times. However, the situation could have been different in the Middle Kingdom though the few Middle Kingdom references to the Haunebu are unfortunately void of any value as far as fixing the geographical location of this term. Henenu, an official of the Eleventh Dynasty, mentions them in his Wadi Hamammat inscription. (3) The Theban tomb of Akhtoy, probably of the Eleventh Dynasty, has one scene showing a feast in honor of Hathor of whom it is said: ph.n biw.t hilw-nb.wt, " Thy might (reputation?) has reached the Haunebu. " (4) An official of Sesostris I claims that he can speak and write the lan- guage of the Haunebu. (5) Finally, an Eighteenth Dynasty copy of a Twelfth Dynasty text mentions the Haunebu in connection with the " (Islands in the Midst?) of the (Great?) Green, " though the context is too badly damaged to be of value to the present purpose. (6). (*) Quibbell, Hierakonpolis I (London, 1900), pl. XXVI c, 5.

The term " Islands in the Midst of the Great Green, "</page><page sequence="12">Egypt and the Bast Mediterranean 33 We are still left, then, with no final conclusion. Middle Kingdom Egypt was in indirect contact with the Aegean as shown by the aicheo- logical evidence noted above. It is quite possible that the term was actually applied to the Aegean islands though the infrequent references in Egyptiam texts of this period are of no use whatsoever in fixing the location of the Haunebu even in general terms. Assuming Vercoutter to be correct in his suggestion that Haunebu indicated the Phoenician coast during the Middle Kingdom, it seems logical that the term should appear in a catalogue of Asiatic enemies compiled at that time, expecially since the Haunebu were always considered to be one of the traditional enemies of Egypt. On the other hand, this term appears to indicate no particular people but rather inhabi- tants of specific topographical surroundings, i. e., the coastal marshes and islands anywhere in the vicinity of large bodies of water. It is possible that they represented no organized or immediated threat to Egypt at the time the Execration Texts were compiled (and these texts were written to meet a specific situation) and we should there- fore not expect them to be cursed by name in these documents. They may, after all, be included in such general curses as " all those who might think of rebelling, " etc. Should a definite choice be thought necessary, Vercoutter' s suggestion carries with it more convincing proof than the traditional rendering. For the present, it seems best to leave the question open though, in spite of my reservations regard- ing the omission of the Hanuebu from the Execration Texts, I see no other reason to reject Vercoutter's new proposals. Another geographical term, however, allows more definitive con- clusions. Egyptian relations with the Aegean are also bound to the interpretation of the Egyptian term kftlw , " Keftiu, " usually con- sidered to be Crete. Wainwright, dealing with a considerable mass of archeological and linguistic material, has long championed a Cilicain origin for the Keftians. (1) Much has been written by competent according to Vercoutter, " semble avoir été créée par les scribes de la première moitié de la XVIIIe dynastie. .

In this case, the appearance of the term in the present text should be attributed to the Eighteenth Dynasty scribe who copied the earlier manuscript. (!)

Ward authorities in opposition to this theory and his archeological evidence at least has been proven inconclusive. (x) The linguistic evidence he proposes, drawn almost exclusively from Classical sources, is equally inconclusive. For example, in discussing an Egyptian hieratic inscrip- tion entitled " To make names of Keftiu, " (2) Wainwright offers several supposedly equivalent Anatolian and Hurrian names which, he concludes, prove that the Keftiu speech was native to Cilicia. Several of these equations are unacceptable on phonetic grounds. (3) Furthermore, much of the Keftiu = Cilicia theory leans heavily on the supposed relation of the Phillistines and the Phaistos Disc to Cappadocia. However, the recent decipherment of the Phaistos Disc, the proof that this object is of Cretan (not Anatolian) origin and, above all, the appearance of the place name aqe-pirita, " Province of Phillistia, " in this inscription should dispell remaining doubts that the Phillistines, hence their homeland Caphtor (= Keftiu) are to be associated with the Aegean rather than Cappadocia. (4) On the basis of these factors, I see no reason to abandon the equation of the Egyptian term kftiw with Crete. While the term kftiw does not appear in Egyptian texts until the Eighteenth Dynasty, some of these manuscripts are based on older (*) Note especially, Kantor, The Aegean and the Orient in the Second Millennium B.C.

Vercoutter, L'Égypte et le monde égéen pr ¿hellénique, pp. 33-123, has exhaustively studied the Keftiu problem from the stand- point of the Egyptian sources and concludes that the term indicates " une partie au moins du monde égéen, seule région méditerranéenne, riche en îles, située au Nord-Ouest de l'Égypte. " (p. 119) (2) Discussed by Peet, in Cassou (ed), Essays in Aegean Archeology Presented to Sir Arthur Evans (Oxford, 1927), pp. 90-98. For Wainwright's discussions, cf. JEA XVII (1931), 30-38, and AJA LVI (1952), 200-02. (3) For example, the " Keftian " name Nsy of the Egyptian inscrip- tions is related to Hurrian Naziia and the contemporary Cappadocian name Nazi. However, a foreign z was borrowed into Late Egyptian as [j] or [č] and not a sibilant; Semitic ¿y/, " olive ", = Late Egyptian j.t, " olive oil"; Akkadian zabnaku, " vessel ," = Late Egyptian čbnk, " metal vessel"; etc. All of Wainwright's examples drawn from sour- ces contemporary to this Egyptian inscription violate such phonetic principles.

We may therefore add the evidence of the term kftlw to the archeological evidence discussed above to substantiate a Middle Kingdom relationship with the Aegean area. This connection was indirect in that commercial ties with the Aegean appear to have been via Byblos. While no political interest may be assumed, Egyptians were resident there and the name of Crete was well known to Egyptian scribes. The relationship between Egypt and Anatolia during the Middle Kingdom was only an indirect one. The positive evidence now avai- lable consists of the statuettes of two individuals who were resident in Anatolia in the capacity of private citizens. One is the statuette of Keri, found at Kurigan Kaleh, of Egyptian manufacture and common Middle Kingdom type. (2) While Keri bears no titles, the names and offering formulae carved on this piece are typical of the Middle Kingdom. (3) His presence in Anatolia is unexplained though we may perhaps speculate that he was a merchant, was engaged in private enterprise and did business with the Assyrian merchant colonies which flourished in Anatolia during the nineteenth century B. C. These colonies were very much interested in tin among other commodities (4) and, since the Bronze Age begins in Egypt during the Middle King- dom, (5) it is within the realm of possibility that Keri was concerned with the purchase of tin from the Assyrians. Anatolia would be a more logical source than Syria for the tin imported into Egypt though there is no evidence that the Assyrian merchants would trade this (*) Cf.

(*) We need not restrict Keri's interest to tin, however, since the Assyrian merchants dealt with many other products, especially textiles. Their trade routes connected with Syria and it is very possible that an Egyptian moved to Anatolia for the purpose of doing business with the Assyrian colonies there. The other statuette is that of the Nurse Sit-snefru, found at Adana. (2) Sit-snefru must have been attached as governess to the household of an Anatolian noble; her situation is paralleled many times by foreigners who came to Egypt and Egyptians who travelled abroad to practise their specific professions. (3) The professional guilds of the Near East were quite fluid and were partly responsible for the cultural interchange which joined the nations of the East Mediterranean into an international " Near East civilization. " (4) (x) It has been suggested that Syria was the point of origin for the tin used by Egyptian metalsmiths; Wainwright, JE A XX (1934), 29-32.

(3) In the Wenamon narrative, for example, the prince of Byblos has an Egyptian singing- woman at his court. Some of the Egyptians men- tioned in connection with the Canaanite prince Ammi-enshi in the tale of Sinuhe may also have been serving this ruler in professional capacities. It is also clear that Sinuhe himself took up service as a noble under Am- mi-enshi. Asiatic dancers are mentioned in the Kahun Papyri; Wilson, A JSL IyVIII (1941), 232. Female textile workers appear to have been especially prized as slaves in the Middle Kingdom judging by their pro- minence in the list of slaves belonging to a woman of the late Middle Kingdom; Hayes, A Papyrus of the Late Middle Kingdom in the Brooklyn Museum (Brooklyn, 1955), p. 108.

My favorite example of the international aspect of East Mediterranean culture in ancient times comes from the tomb of the Chief Physician Nebamun; Säve-Söderbergh, Four Eighteenth Dynasty Tombs, pl. XXIII, 2d register. Here, a wealthy Syrian is shown visiting the Egyptian doctor; the visitor's wife wears a Cretan dress. This Cretan dress on a Syrian woman in an Egyptian tomb vividly illustrates the cultural inter- change of the times. This interchange is also expressed in other aspects of culture, for example, language. Many words were in current use</page><page sequence="16">Egypt and the Bast Mediterranean 37 Egyptian representatives of this cultural phenomenon were Usir of Knossos, Keri and Sit-Snefru of Anatolia and several Egyptians living in Syria-Palestine, discussed below. Other finds in Anatolia are inconclusive with regard to Egyptian relations during the Middle Kingdom. A small bone plaque of the Egyptian god Bes was found at Alasha Htiyiik in the " lowest Hittite Level " (level IV). (x) This level, however, cannot be dated accurate- ly and may be as early as the Merchant Colony Age or as late as the Egyptian Eighteenth Dynasty. Schaeffer has alluded to several Middle Kingdom statuettes found at Boghaz Koi though I know of no place where they have been published. (2) Egyptian relations with the Aegean and Anatolia during the Middle Kingdom are thus represented by material of private nature which gives some hint at commercial interests. There are positive indications that Egyptian citizens made their way to several foreign cities to practise their professions or crafts abroad. The amount of material is rather small and we may conclude that there was no at- tempt on the part of the Egyptian government to investigate the possibilities of trade farther afield than Syria. The Egyptian material found in Crete and Anatolia must represent private initiative rather than national; the national effort seems to have been directed toward Byblos. In Palestine, the evidence of private endeavor is again quite strong. As I have noted above, the initial Middle Kingdom thrust northward toward the Asiatic countries began under Nebhepetre throughout the East Mediterranean; Ugaritic ktn, a kind of robe, appears as ki-to in Linear B (xircov), Hebrew kofěv, " cyprus-plant ", appears in Linear B as ku-pa-re {xvtcsiqov). Gordon, Hebrew Union College Annual XXVI (1955), 43-106, has shown the infinite possibilities of integrating Classical and Near Eastern studies and this article is basic to an under- standing of the potentialities involved. (x) Kosay, Ausgrabungen aus Alaca Höyük (Ankara, 1944), pl. XLIV, no. AL/A88, p. 31. The term " Hittite, " used by Kosay is in the ar- cheological not linguistic or historical sense. The scanty information given in this publication makes it impossible to date level IV, 4, where the Bes figurine was found, more exactly. At any rate, I would hesitate to date this figurine any earlier than the Eighteenth Dynasty.

Ward Mentuhotep of the Eleventh Dynasty. The short period of anarchy immediately preceeding the reign of Amenemhat I, first king of the Twelfth Dynasty, seems not to have lessened this initial thrust into Sinai since this king left a monument there. (x) Other inscriptions also testify to the activity of Amenemhat I in Asiatic territory. Khnumhotep I, Nomarch of Beni Hassan, fought for this king both in the south and against Asiatic tribes. His biographical inscription is fragmentary but a sea expedition involving twenty ships built of cedar is mentioned which substantiates a tie between Egypt and Syria at the very beginning of the Twelfth Dynasty. (2) This would lend added weight to the suggestion made above that the Eleventh Dynasty was in contact with Byblos and that there may have been some sort of connection maintained even during the First Intermediate Period. Another noble of this reign, Nesumontu, describes a military action against several peoples living north and east of Egypt which took place in Amenemhaťs twenty-fourth year. (3) It is doubtful that any of these military campaigns actually reached Palestine proper though if Khnumhotep' s fleet was sent against Asiatics (the inscrip- tion is broken at this point) it is possible that this particular action was aimed at the south Palestinian coast. There is thus no positive evidence that Egyptian military forces campaigned in Palestine during the reign of Amenemhat I though the possibility should be kept in mind. Heretofore, a strong connection with Palestine has been assumed for the reign of Sesostris I; many scarabs bearing what has been considered the name of this king have been found at Gaza, Gezer, Lachish and Megiddo. (4) These scarabs show a variety of spellings of this royal name which can all be paralleled by examples found in (x) Gardiner and Peet, Inscriptions of Sinai. Part I, 2d ed. rev. (London, 1953), pl.

However, not a single one of the Palestinian scarabs can be dated without question to the period contemporary to the Twelfth Dynasty. The Gaza levels are probably later. The Lachisch scarab is from a deposit that extends into Late Bronze times. The vast Gezer collection of scarabs is almost wholly from the Second Inter- mediate and Empire periods. The Megiddo scarabs come from a later level and a grave which is of post Middle Kingdom date. Now there is positive evidence that scarabs of this king were manufactured much later than the Middle Kingdom. Petrie notes that scarabs of Sesostris I were reissued in the Eighteenth Dynasty. (*) Scarabs of this king have also been found at Beth Shan in a level contemporary to the Eighteenth Dynasty (2) and in a Geometric Period deposit at Sparta. (3) Since none of the " Middle Kingdom " examples can be dated positively and there is proof that scarabs of this ruler were issued in later times, there is every reason to suspect that none of the scarabs found in Palestine should be dated to his reign. Hence, there is no proof that this king ever maintained relations with Palestine. (4) Indeed, the only known connections of Sesostris I and his successor, Amenemhat II, with the Asiatic lands are their inscriptions left on Sinai. (5) The reign of Sesostris II offers concrete evidence of a connection with Palestine in the famous visit of the Semitic chieftain Ibsha and his caravan. (6) Scarabs of this king are also known from Gaza and Megiddo though again we must maintain the same reservations as with the scarabs of Sesostris I. (7) I know of no later attempt, howe- ver, to reissue scarabs of this ruler. The reign of Sesostris III gives the only undisputed record of a military campaign into Canaan.

Ward Sebek-khu, an army officer who served this king in his Nubian wars and in a brief campaign into Canaan where the Egyptian army cap- tured an area called Skmm. (*) This town was located in Rtnw, a general designation for Palestine and southern Syria, and may be the Biblical Shechem though this is not certain. (2) This military action should be considered a raid and nothing more since there is no con- vincing evidence of any Egyptian attempt to create an Asiatic pro- vince at this time. During the reign of Sesostris III, an Egyptian noble, Djehuti- hotep, left his statue at Megiddo. (3) The titles carved on this statue are essentially the same (with minor additions) as those appearing in a tomb built for Djehuti-hotep at El Bersheh. (4) The presence of this official at Megiddo has never been satisfactorily explained. There is nothing either in his tomb or Megiddo statue which indicates that he had authority or performed official duties in foreign lands. Fur- thermore, it is difficult to see why a Nomarch and High Priest of Thoth at Hermopolis (a position indicated by his priestly titles) would be resident in a foreign country; there is no good reason to insist that he was an ambassador or resident Egyptian commissioner. Yet, the statue belonged at Megiddo and Djehuti-hotep must have been there at some time during his long career. He began his public service under Amenemhat II and survived into the reign of Sesostris III. He thus lived at a most crucial point in Twelfth Dynasty history, the government reform carried out by this latter king. During the first half of the Twelfth Dynasty, the leading families of Egypt maintained a great deal of independence, being held in check only by the forceful rule of the earlier kings of (*) Breasted, Ancient Records , I, sees. 676 if.; Peet, The Stela of Sebek-Khu (Manchester, 1914).

Sesostris III, however, reversed this situation and replaced the old feudal nobility with district officers responsible directly to the king. (x) At this time, there is ample evidence that the local rulers in various parts of Egypt lost the independence they had previously enjoyed; note especially the abrupt disappearance of the ruling families of Cusae and Beni Hassan. (2) Such is also the case with the family of Djehuti-hotep. He was the last of his family to hold an official position and his is the last tomb at El Bersheh though he was not buried there , a most important point. (3) The family " disappears from view at the very moment that it has reached the summit of prosperity. " (4) These factors point to the plausible conclusion that Djehuti-hotep was one of the local rulers who did not survive the government reform of Sesostris III. His political office of Nomarch had been inherited following the custom of the earlier Twelfth Dynasty. Hence, he was in much the same position as were the other Nomarchs whose heredi- tary rights were taken away. I suggest that when Sesostris III reform- ed the Egyptian state Djehuti-hotep went into exile and took up residence at Megiddo where he lived out the rest of his life. His presence at Megiddo would not be as an Egyptian official but as a hapless exile who left his funerary statue as the last tie between him- self and his homeland. He would no doubt have gained local promi- nance and high position in the service of a Canaanite prince (as did Sinuhe) but his statue recorded the memory of the dignity he had once held in Egypt. Should these suggestions regarding the later life of Djehuti-hotep be correct, the difficulties raised by the presence of so high an official at Megiddo would be resolved.

A brief discussion of Egy pto- Asiatic relations will be given after the evidence bearing on Egyptian relations with Syria has been presented since both Syria and Palestine are involved in the same general problem. Simply stated, the problem is this: scho- lars are divided as to whether or not the Egyptian Middle Kingdom controlled an Asiatic " empire Some maintain that Palestine and Syria were under Egyptian control (2) while others reject this idea. (3) I suspect that a great deal of the apparent discrepency of opinion is instead a semantic problem involving a more explicit definition of terms. For Palestine at least the question of an Egyptian Asiatic province is easily answered though it must be remembered that there is not an overabundance of evidence. In the preceding pages, I have noted several statuettes and scarabs belonging to Egyptian citizens resident in Palestine. All of these, with the exception of Djeuhti-hotep, are persons of little importance, carrying unpretentious (and unmilitary) titles. Djehuti-hotep, the only Egyptian of any prominence in Pale- stine was, as I have shown above, more probably an exile than a govern- ment officer. The royal objects consist only of some cylinders of Amenemhat III and possibly some scarabs of Sesostris II. The rest of the Egyptian material in Palestine is what one should expect to " Scribe of the Vizier, Senbef Rowe, op. cit., nos. S 4-5.

The available inscriptional evidence backs up that of archeology. Only one military campaign into Palestine - that described by Sebek-khu - is established beyond doubt. Most military action against Asiatics was confined to the northern border of Egypt and Sinai. There is thus no known material which could possibly indicate an Egyptian " empire " in Palestine. I have purposely omitted the Execration Texts from the discussion so far since these documents present special problems and are more fully discussed below. The evidence presently known does not indicate any Egyptian military or political control over Palestine. Instead, the same situa- tion is found here that is found in the Aegean and Anatolia. Indi- vidual Egyptians made their way into Palestine to seek their fortunes abroad. Possibly, some of these were involved in commercial ven- tures of some sort or other. But there is no evidence of any kind which could back up a claim for a military occupation of Palestine nor can the material presented above establish even a political control. The Egyptian government considered Palestine in terms of booty and slaves (x) and was not interested in holding a Canaanite province. (To be concluded.)
