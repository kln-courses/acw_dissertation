<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE INDIAN CONTRIBUTION TO ARCHITECTURAL DECORATION IN SPANISH COLONIAL AMERICA' ALFRED NEUMEYER I ACLEAR insight into the widely dispersed notices on the organization and execution of building activities in the New World is difficult to gain. Yet such a knowledge is prerequisite for an understanding of Spanish architecture in the overseas colonies where Spain initiated the most extensive building program ever undertaken by a colonial power. In fact, this program transformed the archi- tectural character of an entire continent to a much greater extent than did the similar process at the beginning of the Christian epoch in the Oriental-Mediterranean area. Were the early Spanish builders professionals? From what part of Spain did they come? Were they provided with instruc- tions from Spain? Did the different orders take varying attitudes towards architecture? The answers to all of these questions would contribute to our understanding of the "style" of ecclesiastic and secular building in the colonies.2 Of equal difficulty is the problem of clarifying the part which Indian craftsmen played in the erection of the new structures. It is evident that the natives would have had to provide at least part of the necessary labor, and we know that entire cities like Coyoacan and Oaxtepec furnished labor in the quarries for the construction of Mexico City.! Organization of the arts and trades in the manner of Euro- pean guilds was traditional with the Indians.4 Since George Kubler has presented his material in the fundamental article "Architects and Builders in Mexico: 1521-I55o," a rational basis for discussion of these preliminaries exists.5 As to the Indian contribution under the Spanish rule, we learn that the Augustinian missionaries either trained the natives in the locality where a new structure was to be built or sent them for training to Mexico City. Their teachers were Spanish craftsmen, who watched carefully that they did not learn too much.6 Letters of Indian chieftains to King Philip II of Spain between 1570 and I580 throw further light upon the conditions. One of these letters is so expressive that a passage deserves to be quoted: "les vemos que todos son de una mesma suerte y condici6n, y todos son caballeros, porque ni los vemos cavar ni arar ni hacer paredes ni otras cosas con la mano, porque ninguno dellos entendi6 en hacer las iglesias y casas reales de V. M., sino que todas las iglesias que se edificaron y hicieron en la ciudad y pueblos puestos en vuestra Real Corona y encomenderos, Indios las edificaron y hicieron, y ninguno de los Espafioles hemos visto trabajar en las dichas obras . . ."7 In this letter pride I. This study has been made possible by the understanding and the kindness of Mr. Edward Hohfeld, who donated funds from the May T. Morrison Trust Estate which permitted the author to travel in Mexico, Central, and South America. A special fund for the purchase of books and photographs was made available by Mrs. Hugh Dobbins. Mr. George Kubler and Mr. Harold Wethey kindly read the manuscript and made productive suggestions. Mr. Kubler has, in addition, permitted me to read in manuscript a chapter from his forthcoming book on Mexican architecture of the sixteenth century (see note 2). Mrs. Dorothy A. Evans, Mr. Emilio Harth-Terr6, Mr. Pil Kelemen, Mr. Erwin Palm, Miss Ariel Reynolds, Mr. Lesley Simpson, and Miss Elizabeth Wilder have given valuable information and help. The Avery Library of Columbia University, Miss Elizabeth Wilder, and Sefior Manuel Toussaint have kindly supplied photo- graphs. To all these colleagues and friends my thanks are due. 2. The answer to these questions is for the first time supplied by George Kubler, Mexican Architecture of the Sixteenth Century, 2 vols., New Haven, Yale University Press, 1948. The chapter I read has provided me with some much needed dates in the often uncer- tain chronology and has given me a clearer picture of the socio- economic basis of artistic activities in Mexico during the sixteenth century. 3.

Indian execution of the new structures is explicitly mentioned on various occasions in Fray Jeronimo Mendicta's Historia eclesia'stica indiana.8 According to the Ordenanza de Pobla- dores, from 1563, one-third of the means necessary for the construction of every church had to be contributed by the natives. Since such contribution surpassed the economic re- sources of the Indian, his share was transformed into labor.9 From the cutting of the stone to the gilding of the altar, the largest share of the activities was executed by Indian workers,"1 and when the Christian structure was finished, the drafted laborer joined in the spirit which filled these alien halls with foreign tongues and quaint imagery. Thus, from the laying of the first cornerstone to the participation in the ritual of the Catholic Church, the Indian was, and still is, an active participant. Where, then, is the stamp which he has, or could have, impressed upon the colonial art of Latin America? 11 Looking out of a window at the plaza in Cuzco and facing the baroque contours of the cathedral and the Jesuit church, it would be difficult to determine the country. In contradistinction to Indian building, the very principles of Christian architecture are demonstrated here in the vaulted and composed space of the interior, the clear re- lationship of interior and exterior. The decorative designs applied to fagades and portals, in consonance with the in- terior walls and arcaded pillars, tend to rounded and curved vegetative forms, such as European art had developed since the days of the Renaissance. At its purest, this European spirit is expressed in the cathedral churches of the main city and the provincial capitals: Guadalajara, Morelia, Mexico, Puebla, and Oaxaca, in Mexico; Cartagena, Quito, and Lima, in South America. This unquestioned application of European architectural forms in the colonies has its firm foundation in the royal ordinances promulgated by the Consejo de las Indias (since 15 11 ) in Madrid. The layout of cities with their plazas, houses, and courtyards is specifically prescribed and it re- flects the rational and reasonable approach to city planning in the Renaissance era.12 These ordinances bespeak not only the endeavor of the first modern centralized monarchy to keep the colonies under strict surveillance, but also a very definite religious philosophy. Only by obliteration of any vestiges of paganism could the triumph of the Catholic Church be assured. Aesthetic or ethnological considerations such as the preservation of valuable monuments or respect for native traditions were, of course, completely absent and did not in general enter the mind of the white man.13 Must we then conclude from this that the Indian was deprived by the Spanish of any right and possibility of ex- pressing his own sense of forms in the service of his new master? The case is more complicated than that, for we must not even take it for granted that the Indians wanted, or were able, to do so. In the cathedral of Cuzco there are extant nine of an original series of twelve paintings repre- senting the Twelve Months of the Year. The subject matter of these seventeenth-century pictures is most un- usual since colonial painting is nearly exclusively religious. The well-painted canvases, therefore, aroused the atten- tion of local historians in the 1930's. Every evidence sup- ported the professional verdict which declared the pictures Flemish. Indeed, the expanded and detailed rendering of the landscape, together with the blue-green coloration sup- ported such an opinion. Recently, however, a signature was discovered which reads: "Ttito Quispe, 1631."'14 This is a purely Indian name and one which occurs on another canvas in the monastery of Santo Domingo in Cuzco, a painting in the most Italianate manner.

Method and conclusion of this writer differ so widely from my own approach that there will be occasion, within the text of this essay, to refer to them. The unawareness of the problems envisaged by Guido may be seen in the utterly vague treatment of the problems of indigenous art in the colonial period in Sylvester Baxter, La arquitectura hispano colonial en Mexico, Mexico D.F., 1934, PP. 19-23 (written in I9o0).

The very understanding attitude of many of the early Fran- ciscan missionaries like Fray Bernardino de Sahagfin, Bartolomeo de las Casas, and others, is due to their Christian missionary ethics. Their spirit is to be found later again with the Jesuits of Paraguay.

Both sides then, as far as a deliberate effort is concerned, failed to work on an active fusion of the two cultures in the arts. Yet the history of the arts has sufficient examples of the instinctive or non-deliberate fusion of the arts of two different civilizations. The most extensive field for observation of the merging of alien civilizations can be found in the later centuries of the Roman Empire. Fusion with oriental elements in the frescoes of Dura-Europos or the Coptic textiles of Egypt, fusion with Germanic elements in the mosaic pavements of England, fusion with oriental and Germanic elements in the crosses of Ireland - all demonstrate this strange phenomenon during the difficult period of cultural assimilation. Substitution of new mean- ings for old images (Christ - Orpheus) or the choice of ambiguous images (shepherd with lamb - Christ) pertains to meaning or subject matter. Such exchange of meanings, however, is always accompanied by similar conditions in the realm of form. With the transformation of ideology the forms must alter necessarily. Many examples are known of only half-understood perspective designs in late antique and Early Christian mosaics and miniatures, with their charac- teristics of disappearing ground lines, of hovering feet above the soil, of irrational juxtapositions, of dissolution of the relation of the whole to its subservient parts.7 If similar characteristics of representation can appear in such widely separated regions and cultures as Asia, Africa, and Europe, then certain physio-psychological compulsions must be op- erative in cultural-visual adaptations. And if such com- pulsions exist, they should help us to understand similar traits in Latin American art."1 Indeed, the situation on the American continent is comparable: a new religion, a sup- planted aesthetic tradition, and a people alien to both of them and charged with the task of executing the colonial structures. If this situation is similar throughout the Ameri- can continent we must not wonder if the results are also similar all over Spanish America. Material is scattered over a continent and occasionally difficult of access. It is not possible, therefore, to survey it without preliminary studies, but it is possible to outline the problem, to explain the operative forces and to establish, within the limitation of our knowledge, geographical and historical continuity between the individual phenomena. Only then can we consider architectural forms as belonging to an evolutionary process which we describe under the term "style," escaping the "isolationism" frequent in Latin American art-history which has impeded the understanding of many of its essential features. It will be necessary to provide detailed descriptions of ornamental forms in order to lead the analysis beyond generalizations. Ordinary terms of evaluation will have to be shelved because the under- standing of colonial art has suffered from an undue com- parison with the monuments of the Spanish motherland, a method which has blocked an insight into the "folk art" characteristics of Spanish American art. In calling it a "folk art," it will also be necessary to examine the design styles of the "folk," i.e. of the Indians who executed archi- tectural and sculptural monuments, an analysis which the work of archaeologists will have to supplement. As we recognize the idiomatic use of European motifs, a specific mestizo art will appear, which, by the varying degree of its Indian admixture, can bring forth similar stylistic fea- tures in places as far apart from each other as Puebla in Mexico and Arequipa in southern Peru. However, obser- vation seems to point to the fact that a true Mestizo style appears only where the Indians had attained a high aesthetic culture of their own at the time of the Spanish conquest. Mestizo art, representing a folk idiom of classical Medi- terranean art (except where it is Gothic or Arabic in deri- vation), does partake of those general features of the hybrid fringe civilizations of the Mediterranean which in antiquity reached from Gandhara to Scotland. By occasional com- parison with them a clearer insight into the constituting factors of Spanish colonial art will be gained. Being a colonial art, it has, like the monuments of the Near and Middle East during the Hellenistic-Roman period, the same wide range from purely European importations to monuments in which the local traditions of form overpower the foreign elements and force them into their own custom- ary patterns. For that reason a colonial art can never be stylistically as homogeneous nor can it be as clearly defined in its genesis as that of the conquering motherland from which the forms are introduced. On the other hand, by its 15. This is not only the painter's point of view but also that of the first book ever written on the painting of Cuzco: F. Cossio del Pomar, Pintura Colonial (Escuela Cuzquefia), new ed., Cuzco, 1928. While this book has the merit of compiling some of the material, it judges the aesthetic quality exclusively from the Euro- pean academic point of view and thus fails to grasp the peculiar aesthetics of Indian or Criollo folk art.

II In front of the churchyard of Acolman (Mexico D.F., 1539-1560), in the axis of the main portal, stands a stone cross dating from the period of the construction of the church, that is from about 1550 (Fig. I).19 It is a cross of peculiar design, consisting of two rounded beams, the head of Christ emerging from the center between the horizontal and vertical beams. The only anthropomorphic form, the head, thus suggests that we interpret the vertical log as the body of Christ and the horizontal beam as the arms of the crucified. The unusual rounded form of the beams makes them appear more three-dimensional and semiorganic; the convex forms are covered with ornamental designs, like the patterns on a printed fabric, representing the symbols of Christ's martyrdom: the ladder, the sponge, the column of the flagellation, the rooster of Peter's denial, and floral designs, which altogether transform the beam into an ani- mated body. At the ends of the horizontal beam, where the hands of Christ would be expected, the crossarm ends in a carved semiabstract Indian floral design with spreading petals, which, through the power of association, reminds one of the fingers of Christ."2 The features of the Lord, crowned with the crown of thorns, are untraditional: with long hair, high cheekbones, and narrow eyes, he is an Indian Christ who has suffered martyrdom. He has not yet emerged to classical corporality but remains a half-sym- bolical sign. The treatment is that of architectural sculp- ture on Aztec temples on which the anthropomorphic or zoomorphic forms grow from the building stone, and em- bossed decorations cover the surface with intricate design. A similar example, found at the church of Santiago in Atzacoalco (Mexico),21 is made still more important by the unusual headgear bestowed upon it by the native crafts- man. On top of a capital-like ending above Christ's head rests a Gothic decorative carving in the form of four di- agonally spreading finials, probably taken from the building grounds of the church. But such a decoration remains obscure unless interpreted from the point of view of the Indian. Seen as a feathered headgear, it bestows upon Christ the dignity of a royal person who, according to native cus- tom, wears elaborate feather decorations. This is also the interpretation which Moreno Villa has given it.22 The same author has briefly discussed a number of these crosses, sug- gesting for them the name "Tequitqui crosses," tequitqui being an Aztec word for "tributary." This term is suggested as a parallel to the Islamic mudejar, which has the same connotation and refers to the style of the Islamic tributaries who executed Christian churches. The word seems well chosen because it refers to a parallel cultural phenomenon with a similar result of a hybrid stylistic expression. Fray Toribio de Benavente proudly claims that it is said "que en ninguna parte de la cristiandad esti mis ensalzada, ni adonde tantas ni tales ni tan altas cruzes haya."23 A more simplified type of a cross is found at Tepoztlin (Prov. Morelos, Mexico) and at Paitzcuaro (Prov. Mi- choacain, Mexico)."24 The cross in Tepoztlin (church built in 1560-1588)"2 has carved in the center, where the others showed the head of Christ, the symbol of the sun, not, presumably, without deeper significance.26 Might not the Indian worshipper find in this familiar sign an understand- able symbol of divine power? These crosses are apparently the most important group of sculptural monuments which have preserved, in form and meaning, the Indian character in sixteenth-century ecclesiastical art. They are architec- tural and representational at the same time, they are deco- rative and symbolic, animate and inanimate, they stand for a meaning and they are the meaning, they banish a spell and they are a spell. This characterization implies that it is in the interaction of differing religious concepts that we must look for one of 19. George Kubler suggests that, because of its similarity to the pictorial style of Indian manuscripts of that period, the cross may date from the second construction period, 15 8o-i 6oo. 20o. Foliated crosses are, of course, well known in Europe, es- pecially during the Gothic period; always, however, the limbs of Christ are affixed to the cross, while here the floral design replaces the limbs. The symbols of Christ's martyrdom appear often in the Mass of St. Gregory. On the rooftops of Indian houses on the Andean plateau of Peru one also finds crosses enriched by ladder, spear, and sponge. 21. Reproduced in Angel Guido, Redescubrimiento, p. 247. The date, according to letter from G. Kubler, is probably about 16oo. For this and several other examples see also Jos6 Moreno Villa, La escultura colonial mexicana, Mexico, 1942, pls. I-7a, pp. 16-17. The preform to its headgear is found in a cross in the Colegio de Guadalupe Hidalgo (illus. Andre Michel, Histoire de l'art, viii, 3, Paris, 1929, p. 1025). 22. Moreno Villa, op. cit., p. I8. 23. Angulo Iniguez, op. cit., p. 195. 24. These crosses represent a varying degree of "Indianization." Some of them, like the one on top of the pyramid of Cholula (Prov. Puebla, ca. 155o, reproduced in Trent Elwood Sanford, The Story of Architecture in Mexico, New York, 1947, pl. XXIII) show only vague reminiscences of the Indian flower motif used at the end of the vertical beam. It would be necessary to investigate whether the type of the Cholula cross represents a later variant or simply a more Spanish one. 25. For the church, see Dr. Atl and M. Toussaint, Iglesias de Mixico, Mexico, 1927, vI, PP. 45-46. For reproduction showing the cross with the church behind it, see Sanford, op. cit., pl. xx. The substructure of the cross to which the inscription refers is from 1871. 26. Instead of the symbol of the sun, the crosses of Tepeapulco (Moreno Villa, op. cit., fig. 7) and San Felipe de los Alzates have in the center an obsidian disk. For its interpretation, see Rafael Garcia Granados, "Reminiscencias idolatricas en monumentos coloniales," 4nales del Instituto de Investigacidnes Este'ticas, Mexico, 1940, II, no. 5, pp. 54-56.</page><page sequence="5">io8 THE ART BULLETIN the motivating powers in the creation of the new style. We then should be able to parallel the style of the Tequitqui crosses with similar appearances where a comparable histori- cal situation exists. This is the case with the early stone crosses of Ireland, England, and Scotland, where Germanic paganism and oriental or European Christianity met during the fifth century and where gradually a cross form de- veloped in which either abstract designs or story-telling details are inscribed into the cross, without affixing an image to the cross. T. D. Kendrick describes these early North- umbrian crosses as follows: "as a type of monument these crosses represent insular, probably Irish invention; indeed, it is not impossible that they are to be connected with the ancient menhir cult of the Celtic world and first appear as the result of a deliberate policy whereby the public and easily comprehended testimony of the native menhir-like memorial, or of the wooden idol, became a part of the mis- sionary apparatus of the Church itself."'27 A similar fusion must be imagined in our Mexican crosses. While the demand of the Church was for a cross with the figure of the Lord which would be customary for a crucifix in the sixteenth century, the Indian craftsman withdrew as much as possible from the alien task and re- placed the image, in part or completely, by symbolical signs which could express much better the magic propensities of a cult figure.28 In both instances the abstract symbols cut more or less flatly in the stone tend to become ornaments. Symbolism and a decorative style belong inextricably to- gether. Our parallel may then suggest that the roots of this "style" are not to be sought primarily in an adaptation of Islamic-Spanish Mudijar or any other art style but in that psychological situation created by the meeting of European Christianity with Indian paganism which must lead to specific visual concepts. The native traditions as well as those of the Mude jar only provided the techniques and patterns, while the final form was caused by new ideological configurations. These new concepts could only become ex- pressive by the application of either Indian or Spanish de- signs and working methods. Since the Spanish colonizers provided these designs either in the form of work drawings or of prints, we have to examine their contribution first. Spanish art at the period of the conquest was the ripe product of a centuries-old development of orient and occi- dent expressed in highly ornate architectural styles: Mud6- jar, flamboyant Gothic, and Plateresque.29 Born in different civilizations, each of them showed in its decorative designs a different aesthetic slant: the Gothic ornament seems to grow out of the stone and to express its inner life, its rise or fall, its thickness or thinness, its compactness or pliability, by gradual emergence from the underlying material; the Plateresque, as it were, shows the flowering forms cut from their ground and distributed symmetrically on the surface. It is not concerned with the matter underneath but with the interpretation of the flat areas on the outer plane. By orderly arrangement it animates the surface with propor- tioned and rhythmical relationships. It invites the eye to enjoy the rich dress for elegant structure. It is an outlandish costume, though, and worn mostly in the Italianate man- ner. The Mudejar treats the surface as a pliable and mal- leable material. In reversal of the Gothic principle of mani- fest growth, it disguises the invisible structural tendencies and neutralizes the wall in its architectural function. The Gothic grows from inward, the Plateresque (being half Renaissance) attaches its design to the surface, the Mudijar presses it into the wall. It treats every material as if it were stucco, and stucco is its favorite material. First is the mould and then, like an afterthought, the matter on which to impress it. The decoration resembles a filigree on which to admire the conquest of the material by human skill, and inventiveness. The designs are elaborate, intricate, often transforming the vegetal derivation of the patterns into stylized abstractions. Stressing the incessant sequence of patterns, it obliterates the individual part. Each of these styles remained alive for two hundred years, in the end blending with the latest arrival from Europe, the baroque. Each of them established itself with local variations from Santo Domingo to Arequipa (Peru), and in most instances Indian workmen were the executors. Which of the three manners of Spanish ornamentation would be instinctively the most congenial to the Indian's own experiences in form and technical treatment? His attitude towards these art forms must be understood as a subconscious attraction to those features in the complexity of Spanish art which were conceivable to him and accord- ingly adaptable to his own vocabulary. To select and to express himself freely was in many instances not possible where trained architects and supervising friars guided the 27. T. D.

It is therefore not sufficient to look for Indian motifs or subject matter in sixteenth-century architecture. Very little freedom was left for their introduction. It is in the execution and interpretation of European forms that the native in- fluence must be discovered. Seen from such a point of view, so-called provincialisms may become the most interesting field of observation, and the statement of Angulo "that one cannot help being surprised by the superficiality and the sporadic nature of that influence"30 can no longer be ac- cepted. His complaint that the Spaniards did not avail them- selves of the greatness of Aztec and Inca forms would have called this meritorious historian before the chair of the Inquisition, and his surprise about the lack of spiritual force "on the part of the dominated" asks from an unfree people that it act like the free masters. Our method of in- quiry is, then, to examine a number of monuments which differ in their appearance from their European models and to isolate those elements which lend them their "colonial" character. Whether we evaluate these characteristics as a positive factor in the culture of Latin America or see in them merely a deterioration of European art depends on our point of view. At least we should have learned from the discussion of late Roman art to judge cultural phenomena by their own patterns and not by standards beyond their own Kunstwollen.31 A crest stone from Acolman (Fig. 2), 32 executed prob- ably at the time of its foundation about 1540, shows the native treatment of the stone clearly: the forms receive their character by being grooved. This technique of groov- ing is peculiarly Indian. It is found in a very large number of stone monuments and may have its origin in the stone tools used by the local artisans as well as in the soft material with which they had to work. Yet the technical character- istics gradually became a manner of the conception of forms which compelled the Indian to apply this technique beyond any practical necessity. The importance of this method of stone carving has been recognized by Angulo in its far- reaching implications: "Aunque sea 16gico atribuir a mano india esa ticnica [sc. of beveling] que, en realidad, es ana- loga a la bizantina o birbara, y que vuelve a florecer prin- cipalmente en el valle de M jico en el siglo xviiim, es de todos modos un problema ain no estudiado."33 Yet Angulo has not only recognized the significance of the beveling technique for the native expression but has also envisaged its similarity to features in Byzantine and barbaric art and he has furthermore shown the connection between the sixteenth-century and the eighteenth-century formulations of this style. Our analysis will proceed parallel to the sug- gestions of Angulo.34 Further, it is evident that the Indian would find the Mud6jar technique, which likewise cuts negative space out of the stone or stucco, most sympathetic to his own experiences, and it will accordingly not always be possible to determine whether a certain design originated in the Islamic or in the Indian field or in both. To call this technique "primitive" or "barbaric" does not help much. While incision and cutting-out are indeed primitive tech- niques, they can take on the same high degree of elaboration as any other more "developed" approach, as the case of oriental art on its long road from Babylon to the Alhambra indicates. The same is true for the grooving and beveling technique of the Indians. What remains unchanged during the evolution of technique is a way of seeing things which forces the native craftsman to adopt subconsciously his own manner to the alien design and to modify this alien design until the two have merged into a new entity. Where the stone under the hands of the European carver would have been rounded, with the Indian the edges remain flat. All forms tend to be on the same plane, and flow into each other without accentuated points, as the treatment of the leaves and the chain below indicate. The grooves cut in equal depth create a shadow band of equal darkness which accompanies the lighted surface of the stone with the cor- responding dark design. The flowers are not conceived as belonging to botanical reality but are adjusted to a design which is pre-Spanish. While the eye was looking at the European sample (presumably there was one), the mind conducted the artisan's hand into the traditional calligraphy. This may become more evident by a comparison with a piece of gold jewelry from Monte Alban (Museum Oaxaca; Fig. 3), although we must realize that we are comparing stone with metal. In the center part we find the typical Indian grooving technique, the same flatness, the same lack of accents, the same flow of one form into another, the same prevalence of the form total over the individual parts. But especially one notes the forcing of originally organic forms, such as the volute, or the bending of leaves into a more rigid abstract design. Indian decorative form, while it may be derived from nature, does not refer to nature. Seen from such a point of view, the transforma- tion of the crest becomes understandable as being more than just primitive. The Franciscan church and monastery of Huejotzingo 30.

Puebla, Mexico)35 belongs likewise to the early and to the most interesting group of monuments. It not only preserves its character as a Gothic fortress church in its architecture, but it also is one of the few existing struc- tures in which fresco painting and stone carving demon- strate the transition from mediaeval traditions to the con- temporary Plateresque Renaissance. While all decorative motifs of the fagade are treated in the flat manner, one of them strikes the attention as quite unusual; it is found at the first arch to the left on the entrance arcade of the porteria (Fig. 4) and can be described best as a chain pattern. The motif derives from Franciscan symbolism, the chain probably symbolizing the breaking of the Arabic bondage, the rope symbolizing humility. The rope design appears at the Island of Santo Domingo in San Francisco and the Casa del Cordon,"6 while the chain appears first - as far as I know - at Huejotzingo. Yet one must com- pare it with the chain design in the motherland in order to see the striking transformation. Under the upper story of the courtyard of San Gregorio in Valladolid (Fig. 5) one finds a good example. The design consists of two parts, a larger link with straight parts and a smaller link with curved parts. By this variation an exact imitation of a metal chain is given. The rendering, besides, is so fully three- dimensional that the illusion of a real object stretched over a straight surface is achieved. Where the chain meets the corner a curved hook ends (or begins), thus starting out the design where the wall begins. In Huejotzingo the chain disappears with one link cut off, as it were, into the wall, making clear that the relation of the ornament to the wall is a different one. It is not conceived as belonging to a limited surface zone which it subdivides geometrically. The links are of equal size and completely flattened out. The effect is that of a continuous, wavy band which hardly suggests the rendition of a real object. Besides, the end of the hook is strangely blunted and recalls immediately the design of the Indian volute as it appears, for example, on the temple walls of Xochicalco (Prov. Morelos), whereas the wavy band reminds one of the design for the feathered serpent's body on the Toltec temple of Quetzalcoatl at Teotihuacain (Mexico D.F.).37 These examples can demonstrate what is meant by the term "form adaptation," a process which must be traced back to the very beginning of colonial art. So essential is this phenomenon in the history of art that for its better understanding we will have to go back to a similar occur- rence in the transformation of the classical ornament into the Byzantine. In the words of Adolph Goldschmidt, who has so well analyzed this factor: "Der Vorgang besteht darin, dass eine Form, sei es in der Natur, sei es in einem Kunstwerk, von dem Betrachter nicht in ihrem organischen Zusammenhang, sondern nur als eine Summe von Einzel- heiten erfasst wird."38 This is exactly our case: the chain is but a stimulus for the creation of a traditional pattern with only a secondary reference to the real object. Deprived of its original meaning, it breaks up in its formal elements. It loses much of its European character and in the beginning it is therefore not always easy to tell whether a work is co- lonial or pre-colonial. In Cholula (Prov. Puebla, Mexico) we find in a private house two capitals with the representa- tion of a human-headed eagle, undoubtedly a mythological subject (Fig. 6)." The one side ends in a classical volute executed in the technique previously described and repeated on the left lower side of the inner capital. The first im- pression is that of an Indian work, but the degree of detailed naturalism (such as the treatment of the bird's leg) ex- cludes the piece from the pre-colonial epoch. It is rather characterized by a roughness and sturdiness of execution which we find occasionally during the early decades of the Spanish occupation. One thinks of Romanesque animal sculpture, and, indeed, occasional Romanesque motifs can be observed in architectural and sculptural details.40 Again half-Romanesque (that is, "archaic" in the Euro- pean sense) and half-Indian is the baptismal font of the church of Tlalnepantla (Mexico D.F.), a church whose fagade also shows some purely Indian patterns (Fig. 9).4 Between crudely carved horizontal and vertical rope pat- terns of European origin one finds the sun disk. In the outer circle the beams are Ulaborated by wavelike crests, a typical Aztec ornament, while the center consists of an intertwined pattern in "H" design with a central cross which may be meant as the monogram of Christ, but which is purely Indian in its mazelike intertwining of forms. This font is one of the rarest documents of the transitional period.42 35. Angulo, op. cit., pp. 2zo3 ff.; Garcia Granados and Mac- Gregor, Huejotzingo, Mexico, 1934; Sanford, op. cit., pp. 143-144.

In this respect they are in conformity with most of the pre- colonial monuments. While such an approach to decorative design may have had its original reason in the technical limitations of the implements used - Fray Jer6nimo Men- dicta mentions that especially43 - it had become in time a tradition and an aesthetic notion. III It is from works of minor size that the new Indian- Spanish manner gradually proceeds to more and more am- bitious tasks. On the fronts of the small chapels in the four corners of the courtyards of sixteenth-century churches, the so-called posas,"4 such as those at Calpin (1548) and Huejotzingo (I550) (Fig. 7), one finds angels flying toward a heraldic device in the center. These angels may well be compared to the flying "Victoria" holding a wreath on late Roman sarcophagi and triumphal arches. They both renounce foreshortening of any kind and spread their limbs on a plane, expressing their function in decorative terms. This comparison indicates that, as in the case of the oriental craftsman who executed the traditional Roman designs, so here in the case of the Indian artisan who exe- cuted the Renaissance samples, a reduction of the spatial concepts and a readaptation of these reduced motifs to an ornamental unit was taking place. How this flat style is used shortly after on a larger scale may be studied on the fagade of the church of Tepoztlin (Prov. Morelos) erected between 1559 and 1580 (Fig. 8). Tepoztlin is today still an Indian community of a rather unspoiled character.45 Here the Dominicans, far away from the centers of archi- tectural activity and behind the other orders in architectural experience,46 had to rely entirely on the understanding of the native stonecutter. A Renaissance portal crowned by a triangular gable,47 over it two angels holding an inscription tablet, and on top of this an arched window - this is the adornment of the otherwise bare fagade. The execution of the designs is flat to an unparalleled degree. In fact, the figures look as if they were cut from a mould and enlivened by incised lines which indicate the folds of the garments. In obvious contrast to the primitive character of the tech- nique stands the advanced character of the figures, especially of the angels with their foreshortened bodies, their energetic contours, and their well-drawn folds. This discrepancy may provide us with a clue to the way in which these figures were executed. A draughtsman must have traced the de- signs taken from drawings which were copies from previous executions of the same motif, or directly from woodcuts. We are fortunately in the position to follow this genesis of the flying angel design from its original Manueline, and accordingly three-dimensional, form to its final, flattened, and Indian interpretation. Completely freed from the wall and hovering in front of the archway, we find two angels holding a crown at the entrance of the convent of Tex- coco.48 This design represents the closest approach to the European-Spanish manner. The next step gives the angels affixed to the wall and in profile as seen at the entrance fagade of the convent of St. Andres in Calpain, executed about forty years before Tepoztlin.4" Even closer than Calpain seems the low relief over the doorway of Tlalne- pantla (Mexico D.F.) (Fig. 9). This church, rich in Indian reminiscences inside and outside, was built in the second part of the sixteenth century. it shows the flying angels in low relief holding up a square tablet with the symbol of the sun inscribed with the monogram of Jesus. So great is the similarity in many details, such as the wind- blown folds of the angels' gowns, that probably either Cal- pin or Tlalnepantla provided the sample drawings or both of them hark back to a third example. In both works the folds are still grooved and varying in depth; in Tepoztlhn they are merely incised (as in the modern sgraffito tech- nique), following the copyist's traced lines on the flat surface. Since the mechanical features of tracing determine the execution, Tepoztlin exemplifies rather the mechanics in the creation of the new style than the aesthetics. But some awareness of this native interpretation must have been present; otherwise sun, moon, and stars over the rounded archway never would have been admitted. They are to be found wherever the Indian has some liberty to take a hand in the design of a facade.50 The fagade of Tepoztlin was executed towards 1580, while the doorway of the parochial church of Xochimilco (Mexico D.F.) (Fig. Io) bears the date 1590o. Here angels are seated on the slanting curve of volute-shaped tendrils, each holding, 43. Ibid., pp. 138-139- 44. These chapels are purely Mexican in character. They appear around 1530 and cease after 1575, according to G. Kubler. They were used for religious ceremonies for the Indians. See Angulo, op. cit., pp. 181 ff. and 192 ff. 45.

Their primitive stiffness, the utter flatness of the bodies, with the folds incised as in the previous example, stands in a curious contrast to the classical order of the doorway and the Roman treatment of the window. Whether the flat style with incisions emerged at a certain place and at a definite date in the second part of the sixteenth century, or whether it emerged spontaneously wherever Indian workmen had a free hand in the execu- tion, must still be determined. The angel as the bearer of escutcheons can be replaced by other allegorical figures, but what remains unalterably the same as a basic concept of the native interpretation is the flat half-profile, half-en face treatment. We can extend the radius of our observation to the seventeenth century and to other countries with genuine native building traditions and yet the aesthetic situation will not differ. Thus a doorway in San Jer6nimo (Cuzco, Peru) may serve as a typical example (Fig. 12). The framework is done with Plateresque-Renaissance designs but the orna- ment does not come out farther than the edge of the block, which is treated in the manner of a frame. Angel Guido has derived this containing of the ornament within the edges of a frame, as well as the repetitive identity of the design, from the planiform and hieratic monotony of the Indian style on the Andean highlands, as we find it in the Puerta del Sol on Lake Titicaca."1 Although this framework dec- oration shows in the sirens (a favorite subject in Peru) the adaptation of classical mythology to the customary mode of rendition, it is clearly derived from Italian Renaissance motifs. The same principle is applicable to the design of animals in a heraldic pattern which, in its semi-profile, semi-frontal form, is as old as the history of the representation of an up- right animal in oriental art. The portal of the "House of the Lions" in Antigua (Guatemala), from the seventeenth century, shows a classical doorway with thin and flat orna- ment framed by twisted columns and flanked by Castillian lions (Fig. I i). Here the native mode of perception forces the execution of a classical-baroque portal back into an early mediaeval status.52 The final result is aesthetically incon- gruous but artistically the genuine expression of a unique historical situation. It is the opinion of the few scholars who have dealt with this problem (Angel Guido, Buschiazzo, Angulo) that the fusion of the indigenous trends with the European imported styles had a modest beginning during the sixteenth century and came to its flowering in the eighteenth-century baroque. We have tried to show, however, that wherever the native element is admitted there, of necessity, a genuine art form appears which is comparable to similar ones in Europe, and the outskirts of Europe in the Asiatic and African world at the beginning of the Christian era. It is therefore not an isolated phenomenon, but a typical one which was expressed frequently but to a varying degree during the sixteenth century. Recognition of this process in its unity and neces- sity has been prevented by failure to see in it a universal stylistic phenomenon. It is likewise improbable that such a style should appear during the sixteenth century and then after an interval of a whole century reassert itself again. While it is true that the academic character of the Herreran classicism and the early baroque eliminated the native in- terpretation to a large extent, some continuity must have prevailed if the forms of the sixteenth century are truly related to those of the eighteenth century. To establish such a stylistic continuity between the two centuries will be our next task. IV Angulo has discussed and reproduced a whole group of sixteenth-century monuments which pertain more or less to the characteristics of the Mestizo style.53 He also hinted at the new flowering of this manner during the eighteenth century in the valley of Mexico and in certain regions of South America.54 To bring order into these various docu- mentations of the native spirit one will do well to differen- tiate between those monuments with a flattened decoration and those which achieved their effect by a real undercutting of the stone. From both types, examples can be adduced in each century. For the time being we limit ourselves to the type which achieves its design by the flattening of forms, by grooving, or by incision. The two side portals of the church of Santa Monica in Guadalajara (Prov. Jalisco, Mexico) from the early eight- eenth century - in spite of their seemingly baroque ex- uberance - point, on closer examination, to their Plater- esque-Renaissance origin and thus form the best example for illustrating the continuity of our tradition (Fig. I4). 5 The composition is that of a Renaissance frame with a balance of horizontals and verticals.

Especially interesting is the application of the sirens holding a coat-of-arms directly against an Inca wall in the Casa de las Sierpes in Cuzco (illus. Hector Velarde, Arquitectura Peruana, Mexico, 1946, pl. 23). 52. The "mediaeval" form is further supported in this specific instance by the oriental type which the Castillian coat-of-arms with the paired lions has taken on in the Mud6jar style; for example, Mezquita, Cordova, reproduced in Ernst Kuehnel, Maurische Kunst, Berlin, 1924, p. 84. 53.

The individual motifs, however, are those of the sixteenth cen- tury and the treatment of the angels holding the escutcheon has not changed since the period of its inception. As in many other examples all over Latin America the native craftsman betrays his racial ideals in his rendering of heads such as the ones on the bases of the columns on both sides of the windows, which are of a purely Indian type. The small volutes above are used for a hornshaped headgear. The details are drowned in the net of ornament which covers the surface. This density of decoration is further increased by the intricacy of the chosen designs, such as the inter- twined ribbon or the combination of ribbon and tendril. But even this horror vacui has its antecedents in the Spanish Plateresque and in the Arabic Mud6jar. Most disparate European systems were combined for a total effect which is both baroque and indigenous. The farther we proceed into eighteenth century, the more luxurious the patterns grow until they finally have covered interiors and exteriors. The ideal motif for such a vegetative and luxurious ex- pansion of the decorative pattern arrived with the Renais- sance - the volute. It was used widely and more or less classically. It had to undergo, however, the kind of in- versions found in mannerism and in the Flemish "strap work," where the late Morisque became interpreted three- dimensionally. Sample books must have come from Ant- werp and helped to lay the ground for the increasingly Flemish character of colonial art. Volutes were reversed in their direction or hooked together with other designs as if made from metal. One of the earliest examples of this type must be that at the museum in Guadalajara (Prov. Jalisco, Mexico), a doorway probably from the last quarter of the sixteenth century. But this hooking and reversing of volutes, which became more and more customary in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, has at the same time an antecedent in the decoration of the different Indian races. A detail of the temple in Xochicalco (Prov. Morelos, Mexico),56 can exemplify this. The end pieces of these grooved-band ornaments can best be compared to ear- shaped forms, to hooks and tongues; accordingly the ex- perience of these forms endowed the native craftsman with an ability to adopt the design to that of Flemish "strap work" and its intricate patterns. An exceptionally lavish use of quatrefoils, tendrils, and volutes, preparing the way for the spread of decoration over ceilings and walls of the interiors in the seventeenth century, appears first on the fagade of Yuririaptindaro (Prov. Guanajuato, Mexico), executed ca. I570.5 r Tous- saint has recognized indigenous traces in its abundant use of ornaments.58 Otherwise the decoration shows the fur- ther development of the fagade of Acolmain. For us it is of importance insofar as it inserts a link in the evolutionary chain from the sixteenth to the eighteenth century. It shows the increasing expansion of ornament over larger and larger areas and the peculiar combination to which the volute was put. Especially in the cornucopias of the Caryatide Indians, one can observe offshoots of spirals without any feeling for their organic emergence from the stern, rendered with a stiffness and geometrization which is closer to Indian design than to European. One will find a similar typical stretching of the stem of the volute and a similar inorganic growing of a second volute out of the head of the first one on fagades of the seventeenth century,"9 such as the decoration of La Soledad in Oaxaca (Prov. Oaxaca, Mexico) from 1682/ 90.60 In these forms the material for the ultra-baroque is prepared which preserves, under the European garment, the native body and structure. The large manneristic volute ornamentation in the in- terior of churches begins with the ceiling of Santo Domingo in Puebla (Prov. Puebla, Mexico), built after 1659, exert- ing a strong influence on Mexican architecture."1 In its pure European form, the Flemish late Renaissance design spreads over the ceiling. It still leaves enough open ground space to create an interaction between the undecorated and the decorated area (Fig. 13). In Santo Domingo in Oaxaca (Prov. Oaxaca, Mexico), one of the most lavish of the baroque churches of Mexico, this free space is completely swallowed up by painted and gilded stucco decoration (Fig. 15) ."62 It is formed on the entrance wall beneath the singing choir by a "Tree of Jesse," from the intricate branches of which the ancestry of Christ issues in its blossoms. The material is painted stucco. In the church proper, side walls as well as ceiling are overspun with gilded decoration achieving that effect of representative worldliness which is utterly absent in the interiors of the sixteenth century, but which forms the antecedent for such interiors as Tlaxcala or Tepozotlin. The Flemish "strap work" again is the basis for the decorative system; yet the volutes grow out from shapes which defy geometrical description. One notices, amongst 56.

In richer combination the design takes the form of figure 2. 1. 2. 3. 30. 4. 5. 6. 7. In the near-by Zapotec ruins of Monte Alban, figure I can be found repeatedly. It is the hieroglyph for tepec=hill. Other modifications combine a volute with a curve which looks like the ending of a cursive Latin T. Figure 3 and figure 3a are characterized by a steplike design or double volute endings. Figure 4 shows a flat curve in the volutes on both ends. Crestlike forms are used in figure 5. The combination of volute and band appear in figure 6; and finally, the clasp or ear design is seen in figure 7. All motifs are well known in Mexican Indian decoration. Nobody looking at this decorative spiderweb would at first notice these features. They are submerged in the flow of design, the total impression of which is of an extremely intricate baroque decoration. Yet differing from European baroque, the ornament lies completely flat on the surface and nowhere makes use of the spatial energies which the spiral pattern would develop in Europe. Like spun sugar on a cake, the design seems to be pressed from a tube onto the walls. Once aware of this fact, one begins to see that what in the beginning looked like Flemish "strap work" and Italian mannerist ornament has an underlying Indian concept of forms. What had commenced as a merely Euro- pean-inspired style in Puebla, reverted in Oaxaca, so deeply imbued with Indian tradition, to the old forms and spread from there to the country churches of southern Mexico, of which the purest example may be studied in Tlacoluca (Prov. Oaxaca, Mexico).63 The same style of baroque stucco decoration, however, can be executed in the pure European fashion, as in the Capilla del Rosario of Santo Domingo in Puebla.64 Here the fluency and vegetative quality of volutes and tendrils is nowhere interfered with by Indian reminiscences. It all depends on how much is left to the initiative of the native craftsman. The closer to the centers of the European influence, the more European is the form. But in Oaxaca, until recently one of the most inaccessible provincial capitals, rich with native traditions of a great indigenous art, the craftsmen expressed the same forms as those of Puebla but in a manner of their own. Finally, in a village church like that of Tlacoluca, they imitated the designs of the district capital and further rusti- cated - that is, Indianized - them. This does not neces- sarily imply a lowering of quality, but rather an increasing of the native spirit together with an unavoidably greater primitive quality. One of the most typical features of this native inter- ference is, as we have seen, the flattening of the ornament. From this flattening of forms results gradually a reversal of the principles of European ornamental styles. The forms no longer appear as carved out from the stone but as pressed into a soft doughlike surface. As a result of this the designs are flush with the stone, uniform to the point of monotony, and coactive with the shadow pattern of the removed parts. It is in this type of ornament that the colonial style reaches its greatest affinity to the Mud6jar. However, the Arab traditions have only influenced, not created, the new dec- oration. The second group, characterized by the undercutting technique, has its origin in the first one. It is the necessary result of the flattening of all forms, a device which auto- matically raises the surrounding negative space to the same level, thus making it an active factor of design. Exactly the same development occurred in late Roman and Early Christian art. The meaning of this has been discussed by Adolph Goldschmidt, who points out that this principle of the equal value of positive and negative space finds its most advanced expression in Islamic art.65 These observations of Goldschmidt were preceded by those of Alois Riegl, in his Stilfragen and Spiitromische Kunstindustrie.66 Riegl notices that the deep-cut ornament, with its shadow pattern, can be understood only if seen from a certain distance. It is an "optical" ornament as contrasted with the "haptical" or "tactile" ornament of the classical epoch. Such an ornament had been the Mud jar decoration - in itself a branch of Islamic art - which made its appear- ance very early in the colonial period, showing a natural 63.

It appears in a most brilliant example at the Capilla de Indios at Tlalmanalco (Mexico D.F.) (Fig. 16).67 A comparison of a pillar from this chapel with a marble slab from the Lateran in Rome"6 displays the remarkable stylistic similarity caused by the fleshy forms of the orna- ment, the contours of which are emphasized by the black shadows of the undercutting. In both instances the examples are early types within the evolution to which they belong. In the one instance there is still evident a connection with Hadrian classicism, in the other instance with the Italian Renaissance. Therefore to the relative fullness of forms is added a new feature, the "optical" treatment, achieved through deep shadow accompaniment. The motifs on the pillars of Tlalmanalco are a rare and curious blend of Italian groteschi with Mexican motifs: Indians with horn-shaped headgears and skulls. Closely related but more robust in execution is the entrance to the courtyard of the church of Coyoacain (Mexico D.F.).69 But here there breaks through that new quality of the "anti-classical" manner which we notice so dramatically in the orientalization of Hellenistic and Roman art: juxtaposition instead of coordination, isola- tion of each part instead of organic growth. The fagade of the Dominican house in Puebla (Fig. 17) from the end of the seventeenth century, which forms the right side of the atrium of Santo Domingo, shows this manner fully matured - that is, deprived of the classical reminiscences which still cling to it during the sixteenth century. The material is clay and a mixture of lime, sand, and water, carved with knives and modeled with sticks.70 The rosettes, spirals, tendrils, and shells are of Plateresque derivation. They seem to be jig-sawed and strangely de- natured. In the half shells on both sides of the windows, for example, the flutings have lost their shell walls alto- gether and appear as hollowed out blacknesses, creating a ninefold shadow accent in a semicircle. The total effect may be unpleasant to an eye trained to European art, but this is no longer a European fagade. If we speak of a colonial art in the sense of an inclusion of the Indian element, then this is eminently "colonial." The most radical departure from the European original we find in such provincial creations as the cathedrals of Zacatecas (Prov. Zacatecas) 1612-1752 (Fig. 22) and Aguascalientes (Prov. Aguascalientes), the latter geo- graphically, and therefore stylistically, related to the for- mer.71 Here the organic context of the decoration has ceased altogether. The fagade is covered with square-shaped stone slabs of the most variegated designs. Several of these slabs can form one pattern, but the units as such remain unre- lated to the neighboring ones. Figures of angels and saints are treated like the birds in Gothic tapestries, that is, as a part of the intentionally mazelike all-over texture of the surface. Forms are absolutely flat and strangely punctured by stitchlike patterns of drill-like holes. The negative shadow-forms have ceased to obtain the reverse pattern of the positive parts but form irrational openings. The prin- ciple of horror vacui has vanquished the Renaissance-ba- roque principle of organized surface and of design in depth and has returned Mexican art to such formalized designs as we have seen on the Pyramid of Xochicalco72 or the stelae of the Maya.73 Aguascalientes is more moderate. On its fagade exists more open space and less ornament and accordingly more clarity, but the disintegration of once organic form is the same. In the third story the tendril con- nection is broken up and a pattern of scattered foliage creates an effect of incrustation. This isolation from part to part - again so much like that during the dissolution of antiquity in fifth-century floor mosaics or in Coptic textiles - would be the very contrary of the stylistic principles of the baroque. It is therefore not sufficient to describe the churches of Puebla, Zacatecas, and Aguascalientes as baroque or ultra- 67. Angulo, op. cit., figs. 462-464, and pp. 341 ff. One should also notice the relation to such Manueline works as certain pillars and doorjambs at the monastery and the parochial church of Batalha in Portugal executed about 1520 (illus. in Juan De Contreras, Marques de Lozoya, Historia del arte hispdnico, II, Barcelona, 1934, figs. 581-583, 585). 68. Riegl, op. cit., p. 137. 69. Angulo, op. cit., fig. 465 and p. 344. To the same group belongs the facade of Angahua (1570) and of the Hospital Chapel at Uruapan, recently discussed by Manuel Toussaint in Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, v, 1945-46, pp. 24-26. Toussaint groups it under Mud6jar architecture and compares its technique to the Islamic foliated ornament impressed on carved plaster, the ataurique. Our point of view differs from his insofar as we see in it something different from the Mudejar - a fusion of the indigenous with the Mudejar and the Plateresque. As such it should, in our opinion, be considered as a genuine style with its own history. We do not, of course, deny that &lt;without the Mudejar the Mestizo style would have had a very different character. 70. Daniel Duran, La Capilla del Rosario, Puebla, 1938, pp. io-i i. The style appears also at the facade of La Compaiiia (before 1890 polychrome) reproduced in Atl and Toussaint, Iglesias de Mexico, IV, 1925, pl. 43 Los Remedios, ibid., pl. 41 ("furiosamente polycromada"); Capilla de la Iglesia de Guada- lupe, ibid., pl. 49 (the stucco work is described, p. 48, as of Italian origin "y su transformaci6n se debe al sentimiento y la tecnica de los indigenas que la ornamentaron").

Dr. Atl in Iglesias de Mexico, VI, p. 92, rightly complains about the lack of understanding by foreign art-historians who judge such creations from the point of view of Spanish art. In context with our own point of view I quote his conclusion: "y las estudiamos estableciendo una serie de comparaciones con arquitecturas de otros palses, es ficil comprender y determinar que nos encontramos frente a manifestaciones nuevas, surgidas de un energico, bairbaro, fan- tistico espiritu ornamental, que solo ha sido superado por el arte Hindui."</page><page sequence="17">116 THE ART BULLETIN baroque. They are that to a certain extent because they have obtained details from this style and have found en- couragement for their exuberant decoration in its abun- dance, but structurally, as we have shown in Sta. Monica in Guadalajara, these faqades are dependent on the Plater- esque-Renaissance. Here is the origin of their compositional design and from here accordingly flows its decorative tradi- tion. It is one stream of indigenous handling of Renaissance ornament that connects Tlalmanalco with Zacatecas and Aguascalientes."7 The question arises whether similar trends appear in other parts of Latin America where the native artistic level had been high enough in the pre-colonial epoch to contribute actively during the Spanish period. A coherent evolutionary stream is not recognizable in Central America, in Colombia, and Ecuador. Undoubtedly the creative power of the In- dian was not strong enough here to break through the mould of Spanish art. The eighteenth century shows, for example, in Guatemala and in Honduras, a rustification of European ornament, yet rustification is not necessarily In- dianization. Of the latter not much is visible. The same applies for parts of Peru, especially for Lima.7" As soon as we come into the Inca-Quechua territory, however, the situation changes. A new and fascinating chapter can be added to the history of the Mestizo style. V The monuments of this Mestizo style, different from anything produced in Europe but also different from the monuments of the Indian past, are to be found in one geo- graphical area of vast extent which has its center in the Lake Titicaca region of the Andean high plateau. It spreads from there eastward and southward to La Paz and the great mining center of Potosi and westward to the foothills of the mountains, to Arequipa. Thus it circumscribes the same area which has produced the great architectural monu- ments of the Inca epoch.76 The singularity of the decorative style of Arequipa and the Andean plateau has been noticed by recent writers and three different - unreconcilable - explanations have been brought forward. The first to ap- proach the phenomenon from a methodological point of view was Angel Guido. To him goes the honor of over- coming the "Spanish approach," which previously had judged every monument on the basis of its closeness to the forms of the Spanish motherland. In his understanding of the indigenous and genuine character of Andean colonial art he claimed it to be the continuation of the "lineal" Incaic style fused with the art of Europe. Since 1925 he has reiter- ated his thesis untiringly"77 and has exerted a great influence on subsequent writers, especially on Mario Buschiazzo and Hector Velarde.78 But Guido has also impeded progress toward a more precise grasp of the historical problems by introducing the terminology of W6lfflin, thus replacing the evolutionary concept of historical analysis with a dialectical system deduced, after all, from a limited period of European art. Even disregarding the theoretical part of his contri- butions, his comparisons are much too generalized to have real validity. Nevertheless, he is responsible for a more appropriate evaluation of these monuments in terms of their own historical background. The second explanation is that of Alfredo Benavides Rodriguez, who introduced the term "xylomorphic" style.7" It has recently been reiterated in Manuel Cuadro's doctoral dissertation.s0 According to this theory, the pe- culiar style of the Andean ornament must be explained by the fact that woodworkers were the designers of archi- tectural decoration, and that thus the gouging and grooving technique of wood carving became applied to architecture 74. Angulo makes the same connection, op. cit., pp. 342-343. Silvester Baxter (La arquitectura hispano-colonial, Mexico, 1934, p. 199) compares it with St. Monica in Guadalajara. 75. It is one of the strangest negative checks on the cultural en- durance of the Indian inhabitants of these regions that they should give up altogether their own modes of design. While in Ecuador, for example, the participation of the Indians amongst the decorators and sculptors is an essential factor, there is no tendency observable to maintain consciously or subconsciously traditional techniques or patterns. The case is somewhat different with painting. This the author will discuss in another paper. 76. Of the Cuzco before the earthquake of 1650, little is left and nothing that would form an analogy to the active fusion we observed in Mexico. Cuzco was rebuilt within one generation by academically trained architects who gave to the city its coherent but strictly Europeanized architectural appearance. Only the use of Inca walls for substructures and the highly developed capacity for the cutting of building stones lend a trace of the superseded traditions to the otherwise strongly baroque city. It still remains a disconcerting fact, not fully explained, that Cuzco does not partici- pate in the Mestizo revival. The case is different with Lima where there never was an important Indian civilization and where the influence of the Viceroyal administration was too strong to admit the resurgence of native life. 77. Angel Guido has received inspiration from Martin S. Noel. This author calls Arequipa's churches "la contribuci6n arcaista del Troquel Quechua en las composici6nes arequipefias" (Espaia vista otra vez, Madrid, 1929, p. 221) ; also "y es que aquel mudejarismo que inspirara las mis bellas piginas de la arquitectura granadina, es en Arequipa, el indianismo que determina la eclosi6n de las formas hispano-andinas" (op. cit., p. 222).

While there may be an element of truth in this observation, it must always arouse suspicion if a style is ex- plained by exclusively material or technical factors. Since the days when Gottfried Semper had made this the basis of his architectural theories,81 we have - thanks to Riegl and Wickhoff - gained a much more comprehensive interpre- tation of the meaning and genesis of styles. If this ex- planation were really valid, then the similar phenomena which we found in sixteenth-century Mexico would also be "xylomorphic" and yet we know that there was no wood carving to hark back to.82 It also would leave the relation to the previous Inca decoration completely unconsidered. Andean decoration does not derive primarily from wood carving, but both techniques express the same approach to form - the native one. They have therefore much in com- mon, and a certain likeness can erroneously be translated into a causal dependence of the one upon the other. The last explanation, limited to Arequipa, sees the origin in Hindu art imported by Jesuit missionaries via the Philip- pines." It is, of course, a well-known fact that the Manila trade brought with it oriental objets d'art which, on their part, introduced new skills such as lacquer work and mother-of-pearl inlay as well as chinoiserie designs. At first glance the fagade of La Compafiia in Arequipa indeed re- calls Hindu architecture. But not all churches of this town are Jesuit; and what about the similar creations of the Lake Titicaca and the Potosi region? Are they also Hindu? Is it probable that the native craftsmen over such a vast area would all have learned to carve in a Hindu manner? What sort of samples did the Jesuit supervisors bring with them? There is not a single instance, as far as is known, in which a Far Eastern work of architecture can actually be deter- mined as the model for a Peruvian one. The strongest argument against such a hypothesis, however, is the relation of the Andean monuments to a purely Latin American, that is Spanish Indian, tradition which began long before the Manila trade ever could exert its influence. In deriving Arequipa's architectural style from Hindu art, one deprives it of its larger context with the Americas and degrades it to an architectural curiosity.8" Opposed then to an explanation of the Andean baroque decoration as derived from: (a) the Inca traditions, as basically differing in their monumental linearism from the "painterly" intimacy of the Maya traditions (which again would explain the Mexican "painterly" Mestizo style); (b) from the technique of wood carving; (c) from Hindu architecture; we will endeavor to show the basic unity of the Mestizo decoration all over the Americas and to explain the Peruvian-Bolivian colonial baroque decoration as the his- torical parallel to the Mexican one. With the inclusion of the word "historical" we mean that only the fusion of the Plateresque and the Mud jar,"s primarily, and the baroque, secondarily, with the native traditions could have brought about such designs and such techniques at a given time and in a given area. The problem of such an analysis has been envisaged by Angulo.86 This Andean baroque decoration appears toward the end of the seventeenth century and spreads over a wide area during the eighteenth century. It apparently centered first around the southern Peruvian city of Arequipa, which, like Cuzco after the earthquake of 1650, was rebuilt after the earthquake of 1687.8" The earliest monument, the fagade of La Compafiia, bears the date 1698.88 From there the manner spreads during the following century to nearly all the church fronts and to several of the noble houses. The white chalkstone of the region, called sillar, is especially conducive to the deep and flat cutting which characterizes the new decoration. La Compafiia, and following it the other churches, has the entire surface covered with design which regularly spreads beyond the framing side-columns."89 The interstices between 8 I. Der Stil in den technischen und tektonischen Kiinsten, 2 vols., 186o-63. Riegl (Stilfragen, p. 6) has rightly pointed out that Semper formulated his theories much more cautiously than the followers of his theory in the field of classical archaeology. 82. It would be comparable to deriving the style of certain Early Christian sarcophagi from the manner of such Syrian woodcutters as were active in the carving of the door of Sta. Sabina in Rome. Yet it is the Syrian-oriental element and not the wood technique which both have in common. Besides, any soft material can be cut in the beveling technique, as the slate carvings of the Northwest Pacific Coast Indians prove. 83.

See also the brief discussion in Mario Buschiazzo, "Exotic Influences in American Colonial Art," Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians, v, 1945-46, pp. 2 ff. Velarde, op. cit., p. 131, accepts the Hindu influence for other instances but stresses the native element for Arequipa. 84. The Hindu influence in colonial art becomes active wherever the native population has, of its own, relation to Hindu civilization. This is the case in the Philippines and in Portuguese Goa. From Goa some influence may have radiated to Brazil; from the Philip- pines, to Panama. 85. See also Martin S. Noel's improbable hypothesis in Con- tribucidn a la historia de la arquitectura hispano-americana, Buenos Aires, 1921, pp. i o9 ff. 86. Speaking about the decoration of Calpin, he points out the analogy to the foliage of Zacatecas (Mexico). In the way heads are hidden between the abundant foliage he recognizes "un drama- tismo que hace pensar en un pequefiio Juni [probably Juli, church on Lake Titicaca, see infra, p. i 20o] por cuyas venas corriese sangre azteca" (op. cit., p. 343) ; also, "Los que se citan, sin embargo, creo que son las principales creaciones de esa modalidad estilistica que habia de tener en el siglo XVIII un nuevo periodo de floreci- miento, no solo en el valle de M6jico, sino en el algunas comarcas de America del Sur" (p. 333). 87.

The latter feature is to be observed in many of the carved wooden baroque altars of Peru. This is an instance where indeed</page><page sequence="21">118 THE ART BULLETIN the designs are deeply hollowed out, and form, together with the white stone, a tapestry-like effect enhanced by the sharp sunlight of the cloudless atmosphere. The designs are symmetrical, and the projection of three-dimensional form on the plane spreads out the depth dimension in a flat pat- tern. The executing artisan goes behind the inception of European art to earlier types. The side entrance of the Jesuit church, with the low relief of Saint Iago (Fig. 19), illustrates this procedure well."9 The saint is rendered frontally, the horse in profile, the feet en face again. Com- pared with later examples, the design still preserves a cer- tain continuity which permits the observer to see the entirety of the image at once. The preservation of an organic con- text can also be noted in the pillars of the monastery of the same church.9' The tendrils are continuous, and interpret the given area of the ornate pillars between a marked frame. The deeper we move into the eighteenth century and the farther away from the town to the adjacent rural com- munities, the more these features disappear in favor of com- plete flatness of design and an increasing disintegration of organic contexts. The statement sounds negative as long as the result is judged from the point of view of European naturalistic art. The evaluation changes if one approaches the d6cor on its own terms. Then one must recognize in it not, as in Europe, a progression from two-dimensional con- cepts to greater and greater plasticity and life-likeness, but, on the contrary, a return from an alien representational three-dimensional style to the native two-dimensional, in- tricately decorative, and symbolically abstract manner of representation. This "reverse" evolution comes to its cli- max in the tympana of the entrance portals of such houses as the Casa del Moral, the Casa Ugarteche, today called Ricketts,92 which bears in the courtyard the date 1738 (Fig. 20). Architectural form and architectural design both have carried the disintegration of the traditional Euro- pean motifs to the extreme. While this procedure remains primarily a negative element in architectural structure be- cause the fragmentized units are not recomposed into a new entity, the procedure in the decorative system is from disin- tegration to integration. The curved gable which nowhere meets an architrave or a lintel, and the split cornice of the architrave are features which make no sense as European, Indian, or Mestizo art; yet in the decoration a unified con- cept exists. The general impression is that of an intermittent design of tapestry-like quality. A projection beyond the plane would be unthinkable because the artist has conceived his decoration as a design which is the flat interpretation of a flat surface. Colonial art has here returned to the original principles of native decoration. That this return must have been made with a certain awareness on the part of the builders becomes evident through the extensive use of native motifs: the floral design is that of the sacred flower of the Incas, the "Kantukta" (Spanish: cantuta), and the water- spouts show puma heads. Composed into the knotted design of the tendrils are the monograms of Jesus, Mary, and the Company of Jesus, assimilated in their hieroglyphic form to the floral design. The rectangular architectural frame seems to modify to some extent the interior patterns with the result of a greater angularity than any European design would show."9 The shadow grooves not only separate form from form but also appear within the foliage and the ten- drils, breaking up the continuous flow and replacing it by a staccato pattern of repetitive light and dark motifs. Again the parallel to similar phenomena at the outskirts of the antique world - Gandhara, Mesopotamia, Egypt - is striking. Compare, for example, the tendril ornament growing from a flower vase (a favorite motif of colonial decoration) carved on both sides of the entrance with the same subject on a capital of San Vitale in Ravenna. In both instances the classical-naturalistic source is, on the one hand, reduced to its linear potentialities, on the other hand, en- riched by new technical inventions which relate the sculp- tured form to the modeling forces of light. In flattening the ornament, the contour becomes as much defined by its own plastic circumference as by the surrounding cut-out space; and in grooving the stone, the form is made much more the result of visual than of tactual experience. Finally, the same rhythm of black and white which modulates the pattern at large rules in each individual detail, and thus forms a new type of repetitive consistency which replaces the aesthetic principle of organic completeness of classical art. This new entity is endowed with emotional values attached exclusively to the decorative element. Gradually the aesthetic dictatorship of a conquering nation is absorbed into the anonymous democracy of the indigenous traditions. Such a process takes place in both areas and periods only if under the surface of imported classical styles a lingering of older modes, especially of stylization in flat patterns, the decorative design of carved wooden objects - frames and altars - may have been transferred to architecture. It is the composition and not the technique, however, which has been transferred. 90o. H.

Such a return from curved forms, abstracted from organic nature, to angular designs, abstracted from geometry or from man- made art forms (basket and textile patterns), is to be observed like- wise during the process of reorientalization of Roman-Hellenistic art.

It is wrong, in our opinion, to see in it, as Angel Guido has done, a specifically Peruvian "lineal" manner which has its origin in pre-Columbian monuments of the Lake Titicaca region.95 The same manner can be observed contemporaneously, though to less of an extreme, in Mexico. The entrance to a house on the Avenida 5 Poniente in Puebla (Fig. 21) carries the date 1687. The pattern used here indicates that the edge design of foliage set into a rectangular frame is not - as Guido claims - a feature derived from the rectangular repetitive design as used on the Puerta del Sol on Lake Titicaca, but purely Spanish Plateresque. In both instances, in Puebla and in Arequipa, the frame stones set, as it were, the tone for the treatment of the inner design: the flattening of forms, the spreading out of originally deep space into the plane. We notice in both instances the heraldic design, the incorporation of the mono- gram into the total pattern, the use of drill holes to achieve an abstract stitchlike effect on the surface of plastic forms. We conclude from this that the Arequipa style is neither an isolated phenomenon nor even typically Peruvian,96 but rather the most radical, or genuine, expression of the fusion of the Mud jar-Plateresque-baroque with the underlying Indian approach to design. It is "Indio-Spanish" and part of a universal process on the American continent. Finally, by the middle of the eighteenth century the notion of the ornament as being the outgrowth of an or- ganic and vegetative form limited to a given space has com- pletely disappeared. The ornament covers the facade of the country churches of Caima, Parucarpata, and Yana- huara (1750), all close to Arequipa and executed after 1730, like spun sugar or cut-paper lace. We reproduce as an example the facade of Caima from I730-1750 (Fig. 24)." While these churches have their closest relatives in the country churches of the Peruvian-Bolivian highlands, they do not differ basically from the eighteenth-century churches of La Merced in Antigua (Guatemala) or the church of the third order in Cuernavaca (Prov. Morelos, Mexico). The treatment of decoration of the churches of the Lake Titicaca region and of Potosi is basically the same, but dryer in form, as Marco Dorta has rightly observed." Since their floral and animal motifs do not exist in the geographi- cal areas of Juli, Puno, and Pomata, the most important churches on Lake Titicaca, they must have been introduced by workmen from the lower and more tropical regions, probably, as Marco thinks, from the Jesuit missions of Para- guay or from Arequipa.99 The same author has recognized that the most original element is, however, to be found in the technique and in the stylization of the decoration. That its motifs abound in native flowers, animals, and human figures only verifies that we are here on fertile soil for the resurgence of the indigenous element. Marco is reminded of "anti-naturalistic Syrian or Byzantine examples."'00 Since we have made this comparison the key for an under- standing of the stylistic processes which take place in colonial art, we must examine still more closely the decoration of this region. In its general aspect Marco has described it well but he has not mentioned that its most peculiar element is the beveling of the grooves. By the slanting of the concave planes, one side usually stands out in sharp light, while the other is bathed in shadow. The highlights glide along the sharp edges and outline the forms in a fishbone manner. We find such technique preeminent on the fagade of the church of Betlem (Belem) in Potosi (Bolivia) (Fig. 18),"' the most important mining town of the Andes. It is of the same "dry anti-naturalistic" type as that on the fagade of Sta. Cruz in Juli (Prov. Puno) or in the interior of Santiago de Pomata (Prov. Puno) (Fig. 23),102 a church begun in the late seventeenth century and com- pleted in the middle of the eighteenth century.103 Here, indeed, one is reminded of the beveling technique as used in wood carving.

The forms are "xylomorphic," but their "morphe" does not originate in "xylos." Again it is late antiquity in its transition to oriental art (or better in its reorientalization) which helps us to understand the techni- cal phenomenon. The beveling technique appears first at the end of the age of antiquity in Coptic stone reliefs of the fifth and sixth centuries.1"' The material is a soft limestone just as in the Andean region, conducive to cutting in an in- ward slanting diagonal. The beveling method remained a favorite with the orient until it became a constituent factor in the making of Islamic art. With the Mud6jar it was introduced to the Americas and proved to be the ideal method for "geometrizing" and "linearizing" the organic and three-dimensional classical forms. As in late antiquity, the same technique was used in Bolivia to "denature" natu- ralistic designs and to reincorporate a foreign idiom into the traditional language.1'6 Angulo has pointed out the in- digenous character of this technique (it is therefore Indian and not xylomorphic), analogous to Byzantine or barbaric use, and has asked for a study of this problem.1'7 In the church of Pomata the most consistent decorative scheme for this new style has been carried out, one in which interior and exterior share, using the decorative motifs and achieving the effect of an Indian "peasant art." Its cupola may therefore serve to illustrate for the last time our prob- lem in its entirety. We have observed that the general trend of the morphology of Mestizo decoration was reverse to the cycle of classical art and to the cycle of European art between I 150 and 1750. It shifted from the convex to the concave, from the organic to the inorganic stylization, from articulation to the inarticulate, from subordination to co- ordination, from variation to repetition, from the indi- vidualized to the stereotyped. This last morphological trend has not yet been demonstrated in our previous examples. It can be dramatically shown in the evolution of the cupola decoration. All over Latin America one finds frequently, under the central lantern or rosette, a circular arrangement of saints,0s such as the female saints in the Capilla del Rosario of Santo Domingo in Puebla or the apostles and saints in the Camarino of the Sanctuary of Ocotlan near Tlaxcala (Prov. Puebla, Mexico). In the exuberantly decorated Camairino of San Martin in Tepozotlin (Mexico D.F.), dating from the middle of the eighteenth century, we find four angels, as caryatides, holding the crossbeams of the rib-vaulted Hispano-Arabic cupola (Fig. 25). In robust three-dimensional reality they balance freely on their pedestals, rural relatives of Bernini's angelic army. In the Belen church in Cajamarca (northern Peru) (Fig. 26)109 caryatidic putti have been drawn toward the wall, tied into the decorative system, and stereo- typed in their expression. They are nevertheless recogniz- able as European: haunted members of the family of Raf- ael's putti in the Sistine Madonna. At any moment, however, their frozen gesture may turn, like an Andean Daphne, into a floral design. This step has been reached in the cupola of the church of Chiguata near Arequipa (Fig. 27).110 The angels seem to be propelled from their empty pedestals towards the central cupola. They hover in the air with the gestures of Early Christian "orantes." Or are they feigning to hold up the monogram of Mary which, in the manner of the hiero- glyphic use of monograms on eighteenth-century Mestizo fagades, is half-hidden among the floral designs? The favorite motif of the flower vase from which plants emerge is not missing, but the stem (or tendril) does not continue upward, and the vegetative designs only hold on to the geometrical axis; they do not grow from anywhere. They belong to nature as little as the rosebuds on Coptic textiles can claim to be part of a rosebush. The ornaments are cut as individual pieces and are conceived as affixed to an in- visible square field underneath in the manner of a Plater- esque ornamental stone slab. Figures and ornaments negate completely the vaulted structure and maintain their design as seen on a flat plane. This element increases considerably the "primitive" character of the decoration. The final step is reached in the cupola of Santiago in Pomata (Fig. 28).111 Here the beginning and the end of our problem meet. As in the Tequitqui crosses,112 the total concept is that of an abstract symbol made semianthropho- morphic by insertion of a human head. Is this a flower design or a garland of angels holding hands? Body and arms - 105. For reproductions, Heinrich Glueck, op. cit., pls. 27-28; catalogue, The Dark Ages, Worcester Art Museum, February- March 1937, figs. 48-49. io6. Beyond this it is not impossible that a Mudejar-Plateresque design may have directly influenced the native craftsmen. A certain "Arabic" quality may be found in the central decoration around the keystone of the cupola - but I am doubtful about it. Reproduced in Mariategui, op. cit., pl. xvIII. 107. Angulo, op. cit., pp. 139-140. It is hoped that such a study will be undertaken for the pre-Spanish period in order to establish the continuity between Mestizo and pre-Columbian art. Io8. This arrangement ultimately derives from the frescoed evangelists or apostles grouped symmetrically on the cupolas of Italian churches since the Renaissance. For example, in Masolino's composition in S. Clemente in Rome and in Castiglione D'Olona; later Melozzo Da Forli in Loreto, and others. One may consider as a pre-form for this, the frescoed segments in Gothic vaults such as those in the lower church in Assisi. o09. Harold Wethey, "Iglesias de Cajamarca," Cultura Peruana, Lima, 1945.

Gradually an image emerges (or withdraws) and the decoration vacil- lates in a playful manner between the ornamental and the symbolical. Melozzo's angels from Loreto in Indian meta- morphosis! Aesthetically the most radical solution is the most satisfactory. The native element has freed itself of the alien concept of three-dimensionality and naturalistic cor- porality and has proceeded to a highly original composition. Because of the curved design of the garland-like arms, even the contact with the structural part is reestablished. The "primitive" technique and the embroidering ornamentalism of a true "folk art""11 have digested the "high art" materials of the colonial importation. As a folk art this style is not any longer an Indian art, because it consists of two constituent elements, the Euro- pean and the Indian, of which the European had originally been overwhelmingly the stronger. For this reason the Mestizo or Criollo or Indio-Hispanic style is, in a way, closer to the folk art of Europe than to the pre-colonial art of the American continent. The adjustment to the native heritage is paralleled by a reduction of such motifs as are inconceivable for a "primi- tive" mentality. Representation of three-dimensional space and full-round corporality are a foreign element to the folk decorator of any country.14 They are the product of urban civilizations and demand a power of perception which goes beyond what a rural people can and want to perform. The angels of Pomata are therefore not only an Indianism but at the same time a folklorism of European art and of any art. They appear in similar arrangements on a Bulgarian peasant embroidery and on the baskets of the Yakut Indians of Tulare County in California (Fig. 29). They perform the universal interplay between geometrical and representational form, the superimposition of two layers of meaning which may cover the whole range from magic to mere playfulness, while their garland design is called forth wherever an ovoid background exists. Without the Indian craftsman this style would never have appeared on American soil, but it is expressive more of a universal process than of a specific feature of Indian art. The fusion of the Indian heritage with the Spanish im- portation created a genuine style, but one which genuinely appears wherever the mature concepts of a civilization, created in the cultural centers, are reinterpreted by a rural population. Then the three-dimensional fades out and a more abstract readjustment to the proprieties of the plane sets in. Individual likeness yields to generalized and stereo- typed form, and the execution of a work of art resembles more the variation of a preordained theme than an indi- vidual act of creation. Motifs spread out from one central workshop over an entire continent and lose themselves in anonymity. While the history of styles developed after its own inner laws in Europe, in America it remained more static just as any folk art remains static."1 It sank down to the deeper layers of the populace and created the folk art of Latin America. Its widest field was in architectural deco- ration and in religious sculpture and painting. Since the separation between "major" and "minor" art did not exist, one manner of creation, one style, flows through the vast decorative program of churches and through the gilded frame of a painting. Gradually the art of the Indians be- came transformed into an Hispanic-Indian folk art. MILLS COLLEGE i 3. Applicable to this specific historical situation is the general definition of "folk art" given by W. S. Rusk: "Basically folk art is an aspect of folklore which characterizes the change of a group from a primitive to a rural or cultural status . . . It is comparable to primitive art only if survival elements predominate; it is peasant art only if unsophisticated and strongly traditional elements are patent; it is popular art only if at the chronological level under consideration widespread employment of the forms is clear . ." (Encyclopedia of the Arts, New York, 1946, p. 353). 1 4. About this trend in primitive art, see the happy formulation of Franz Boas: "a realistic pictograph gradually breaking up under the stress of aesthetic motives" (The Mind of Primitive Man, New York, 1913, P. 179i ibid., Primitive Art, Oslo, 1927, pp. 69 and 82). 1 15.
