<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TREATMENT OF THE JEWISH RELIGION IN THE LITERATURE OF THE BERLIN HASKALAH By ISAAC EISENSTEIN-BARZILAY INTRODUCTION Against its own explicitly stated principles, the Haskalah was bound to become a fighting movement. The mere fact that most of its ideals were new could not fail to evoke the opposition of the orthodox who instinctively felt that a critical attitude to any part of Judaism would finally jeopardize the whole. Most of all, it was the pervasive character of the Jewish religion that came under the indirect assault of the Haskalah. Each of the principles and views of the Haskalah contained, directly and indirectly, a challenge to this all-embracing nature of Judaism. The deep faith of the Maskilim in reason, with its implied critical attitude to authoritative truth and overt admiration for science, their devotion to the humanitarian-cosmopolitan tra- ditions of the Enlightenment with its implied or overtly stated disbelief in the election of Israel, but above all their new atti- tude toward life and the world, which was permeated with a hatred of the galuth and a desire to bring an end to it - all these ideals were a challenge to the national character of the Jewish religion. It was not the academic issue of reason versus faith which dominated the discussion of religion in the Haskalah literature. The assault on religion was chiefly indirect and the result of the new set of values which the Haskalah endeavoured to introduce. Through their writings and activities, the Maskilim aimed to expand the horizons of interest and ideals of the modern Jew, thus weakening the hold of traditional Judaism. Every book or essay on science, history, education or morals; every poem in praise of nature or beauty, or even the absorption in the Bible, 39</page><page sequence="2">EISENSTEIN-BARZILAY were all expressions of the anti-religious character of the Has- kalah, anti-religious in terms of the newly awakened interests and desires of which they were indicative. It was the secular tendencies of the Haskalah, its desire to emancipate Jewish life from the unqualified control of religion and to reduce its role to that of mere worship and ritual, that contained a far greater danger to religion than the direct assault on it in the Haskalah literature. * * * I. THE TREATMENT OF THE JEWISH RELIGION IN THE HEBREW HASKALAH LITERATURE As far as the direct dealing with religion in the Haskalah lit- erature is concerned, a line must be drawn between the Hebrew and German writings of the age. The difference in language, it should be noted, was not merely a matter of form, but indicative of a difference in views with reference to the essence and future fate of Judaism in the modern world. In a direct manner, the Hebrew Haskalah devoted relatively little attention to the problem of religion. This was chiefly the result of a moderate policy on the part of the Maskilim who were cautious not to antagonize the orthodox, but tried to win them over to their ideals and projects. Realizing the deep religious devotion of the bulk of Jewry at the time, no other policy could possibly have been pursued. Such a policy, however, could not long be adhered to, and in the early writings of the period are found opinions and views which in substance differ little from those encountered in the more extreme German writings. Cor- roboration is found in the religious views of some outstanding Hebrew Maskilim. Thus, Euchel, except for a degree of caution, did not differ in substance from the more extreme Maskilim.1 Like Friedlaender, Cf. his "Hakdamah" to Ha-Meassef, IV (Heshwan, 1788); "Iggroth Meshulam ben Aryeh ha-Eshtamo'i," Ha-Meassef, VI (Heshwan, Kislev, 1790); Toledoth Rabbenu he-Hakham Moshe ben Menahem [hereafter cited as Toledoth Mendelssohn] Ha-Meassef, V (Heshwan, 1789), p. 57; Gebete der hoch- 40 [2]</page><page sequence="3">[3] JEWISH RELIGION IN LITERATURE OF BERLIN HASKALAH 41 Bendavid and Wolfsohn he also differentiated between the origi- nal "pure" Judaism and historical Judaism. Many of the reli- gious practices, he believed, were merely the result of external influences and constituted no part of original Judaism.2 With regard to the present, he also shared the view that inasmuch as the ceremonial law constituted a great impediment to the economic and cultural activities of the Jews and only served to stigmatize them as strangers in the eyes of the non-Jews, it should be eliminated and the way to a Christian-Jewish rapprochement opened.3 More critical, though overtly more conservative, were the religious views of Isaac Satanow. Though allegedly pleading for a synthesis between faith and "wisdom," he left no doubt where his sympathies lay. While asserting that "the fear of God" must precede the "teaching of wisdom" in the training of the young, he declared that it is the latter which is "qualitatively superior."4 He derided the rabbis for their sole concern with the study of the ceremonial law, bitterly attacked the mystics for their use- less reveriess and left out no opportunity to extol the blessings of the sciences and secular learning.6 Satanow's general criticism of religion on humanitarian grounds is well known. He strongly censured it for the hatred, strifes and wars it caused.7 Religious zeal in general, he asserted, was the result of "human stupidity," for all religions were after all a very dubious affair.

Since logically at least it was thus impossible to prove the superiority of one religion over another, all attempts of conversion must cease.9 Every religion, he declared, was actually the product of the land and people among whom it came into being. Judaism, being subject to the same law, was the natural offspring of the Jewish people while they dwelt in their ancient homeland. Hence its preservation was natural there, while in the galuth it was rather artificial and without inner reason.10 Satanow was also critical of the elaborate form of the Jewish religion and its ex- cessive laws and commandments. Of the famous Talmudic say- ing "if our forefathers were like men, we are like donkeys," a saying so indicative of Jewish admiration for tradition, he sar- castically remarked: "we are donkeys indeed, to carry upon ourselves the many laws and statutes they loaded upon us through the Babylonian and Palestinian Talmuds."" Like many other Maskilim, Satanow was also very critical of the excessive devotion of the Jews to the Talmud and its study. This he believed to have been the source of a great many evils in Jewish life. When he therefore suggested his plan for a reformed Jewish education, he excluded the Talmud altogether from the curriculum of studies."

"Had we been able to fore- see," he wrote, "that a time might arrive when the tenets and laws of the Torah would cause harm to our religion and people, or that no happiness could be derived from them, we would certainly have shaken off its yoke long ago."'6 The Meassef, the central organ of the Maskilim, generally regarded as conservative, almost from the start maintained a critical attitude to religion in general and rabbinical Judaism in particular. In the 1786 edition there appeared an article deriding the primitive notion of hell.'7 In the same issue, there appeared a series of articles in which the author, inspired by the humani- tarian ideals of the age, tried to prove that according to the Torah the legal differences between Jews and non-Jews might actually be reduced to such commandments as shemitah, jubi- lee, freeing of slaves, etc., in short, to those commandments which were valid, if ever, only during the stay of Israel in its homeland.i8 When Friedlaender's translation of the Hebrew prayerbook appeared in 1786,19 a translation which may be regarded as the first attempt to substitute German for the Hebrew text, it was hailed by the Meassefim, the zealous Hebraists, as a major event.

It has already been said [he declared] that prayers are per- missible in any language ..... This, indeed, should be a decisive reply to all those who assert that it is a special misvah to pray in Hebrew, the Holy Tongue. The word "holy," must not be understood as an attribute to language, because there is no such thing as a holy language .... .... We must therefore be grateful to the translator for having rendered the prayers into German, the language of our fatherland.22 These early tendencies gained momentum in the subsequent volumes of the Meassef. In the Meassef of 1788 is Homberg's appeal "To the Shepherds of the Scattered Sheep of Israel," written, as he himself stated, "auf allerhoechste Verordnung," in which he threatened the rabbis with punitive measures unless they supported his educational plans.23 Mendel Breslauer came out in the Meassef of 1790 with an overt plea for reform, the first of its kind.24 It was, however, only in its last four issues, under the editorship of Halle Wolfsohn, that the Meassef launched an open and unrestrained attack upon orthodox Juda- ism. More than half of its four hundred pages were dedicated, directly and indirectly, to this Religionskampf. The cautious attitude of previous years finally gave way to an open derision and spiteful sarcasm of the Talmud, the rabbis, the Polish Melammedim and many customs which were still widely practiced by the bulk of Jewry.25 20 Ha-Meassef, III (Iyyar, 1786), pp. 129-130. 21 Ibid., (Siwan). 22 Ibid., (Iyyar). 23 Ibid., IV (Nisan, 1788). 24 Ibid., VI (Tammuz, 1790). 25 H.

No wonder that some twelve years later when Shalom Hacohen ventured upon its renewal, he declared that moderation in religious affairs would henceforth be the guiding principle of the New Meassefim. He promised to pursue a middle-of-the-road policy and "restore a certain balance."26 This promise, how- ever, could not be kept long. In the Meassef of 1810 there is a translation of Baruch Schotlaender's "Letter... to the Jews of Westphalia... about the Consistorium," which was an extreme manifesto of the reform tendencies. In it the author asserted the right of the new consistory to undertake the reform of the Jewish religion, i. e., to purify it of the "non-essentials which do not belong to true religion," in order to bring out with greater clarity the lofty moral ideals of Judaism. For this pur- pose, he declared, the Talmud would first of all have to be eliminated from the curriculum of studies. It is, he wrote, "a difficult and strange book full of impractical and useless things and could hardly be of any use as a source of religion." For the satisfaction of religious needs, he stated, the Jews would henceforth have to resort to "the pure and clear source of the Bible." In addition to the Talmud, Schotlaender also promised to eliminate the Hegrew language from the prayerbook and substitute for it the spoken language of the land.27 Biblical Judaism was also extolled and traditional Judaism rejected in a German article by Solomon Lay, published in the same volume of the Meassef. While embracing Mendelssohn's view on the historical development of Judaism, the author reached the opposite conclusion with regard to present Judaism. Like Mendelssohn, he believed that the forefathers were in the 26 "Ein Wort ueber die Tendenz des Sammlers," Ha-Meassef [New Series], I (Berlin, Heshwan, 1809). 27 "Mikhtav le-Ahai Benei Yisrael ha-Yoshewim be-Malkhuth Westfalien 'al odoth ha-Kenesiyyah ha-Nikreth Consistorium, Asher Husdah 'al Yedei ha-Yehudim ba-Medinah ha-Zoth," me-eth Baruch Schotlaender (Ne'etak mi-Leshon Ashkenazith), [hereafter cited as "Mikhtav 'al ha-Consistorium"], Ha-Meassef [New Series], II (Altona, 1810), pp. 9-21.</page><page sequence="8">46 EISENSTEIN-BARZILAY [8] possession of the highest morality and a lofty concept of God. Through the Egyptian enslavement, however, these lofty notions fell into decay. The Torah, he pointed out, reiterating Mendels- sohn's view, was revealed as a code of action to remind the people of the eternal truths and inculcate them in their hearts. In the present, however, the Jews must learn to differentiate between the essential and accidental and purge their religion of the many impure elements which had accrued in past gener- ations.28 If Shalom Hacohen, the editor of the Meassef had really been keen on following a moderate policy in relation to religion as he promised, or as devoted to Hebrew as he often asserted, why were such extreme articles as those of Schotlaender and Lay printed? How, indeed, could a Hebrew periodical which openly preached against historical Judaism and the use of Hebrew in the synagogue, have any appeal to readers the majority of whom were religious and considered Hebrew a holy tongue? It becomes clear that almost from the start the Hebrew Maskilim embraced a reformatory view with reference to the Jewish religion. Euchel and Wolfsohn, Satanow and Homberg, Shaul Lewin and Benzev, to name only the most prominent, displayed a critical attitude toward traditional Judaism. None of them, with the exception of the otherwise more extreme Shelomo Maimon29 and the deeply nationalist Shelomo Loewi- sohn,30 showed the slightest appreciation for the Talmud. Not- withstanding the original plan of the Meassefim "to dispatch their intellectual streams into the Talmudic sea,"31 no article dealing with the Talmud or its period ever appeared. Whenever mentioned in the Meassef or in other works of the period, it was criticized and derided. The rabbis were even more often slan- dered and abused.32 28 Ibid., "Ueber Religion und ihre Ceremonicn." 29 See below, pp. 33-37. 30 Cf. H.

The introduction of prayers as an institution among Jews, they repeatedly pointed out, was only incidental and the result of the corruption of language at the time of Ezra.34 They emphasized constantly its universal and individual character; never, however, with the exception of Shelomo Pappenheim,35 Shelomo Loewisohn36 and Eliezer Rashkow,37 did they as much as mention or show any understanding for the great national role of the prayerbook in the preservation of the Jewish people and its national hopes of restoration. II. THE TREATMENT OF THE JEWISH RELIGION IN THE GERMAN HASKALAH LITERATURE The critical attitude to religion, though encountered frequently in the Hebrew writings of the Berlin Haskalah, on the whole remained moderate. It was primarily in the German writings of the age that the fuller and more extreme treatment of the subject is to be found. It is by reading the works of David Friedlaender, Shaul Ascher, Lazarus Bendavid, Shelomo Maimon and Halle Karo, Berith Emeth (Constantina-Dessau, 1820), pp. 23, 100-101, 113-115; Ha-Meassef, III (Shewat, 1786); H.

For the first time a clearly conceived ideology strove to revise the entire scope of Jewish values and ideals and would undoubt- edly have brought an end to the national existence of the Jewish people had it been accepted and applied on a universal scale. The views on religion in general and Judaism in particular held by these men were the result of three major influences: (1) the European Enlightenment, (2) Moses Mendelssohn and (3) the aspirations for emancipation of the post-Mendelssohnian generation. The struggle against religion or, to be more exact, against its institutionalized forms, was one of the outstanding characteristics of the entire literature of the eighteenth century. Though it was only in the writings of the French Philosophes that these anti- religious views became extreme and exerted their greatest in- fluence, they are clearly traceable to the earlier writings of the English deists.' The works of Voltaire, Diderot, Rousseau and other enlight- ened writers were avidly read by a great many people of the rising Jewish middle class and intellectual elite in Berlin and other Jewish communities in the Germanies.2 They were to be I Cf.

None of these Maskilim, to start with, was an atheist. In a manner strongly reminiscent of the English deists and French Philosophes,6 they constantly emphasized their pragmatic concept of religion. Religion, declared Shelomo Maimon, using the con- ventional phraseology of the age, "is natural to man."7 His critical utterances on the Jewish religion, Friedlaender assures us, must by no means be interpreted as heresy in relation to religion in general. His is rather a struggle against its cruder primitive notions and practices and for the diffusion of the "purer teachings of Moses."8 Without religion, Bendavid declared, civil security and human happiness would lose their foundation and become meaningless.9 (Altona, 1751), "Hallon ha-Misri," p. 78; Jonathan Eibeschuetz, Sefer Ya'aroth Debash (Karlsruhe, 1780-1782), II, pp. 12b, 74b. 3 Cf.

Almost ten years before writing his widely publicized plea to Teller, Friedlaender had asserted in one of his letters to Meyer Eger of Breslau that God cannot, in his view, change the course of nature and hence can have no "favorites," nations or indi- viduals, to intercede on their behalf. Such intercessions were not only in contradiction to the humanitarian concept of God but actually constituted a violation of the determinism pre- vailing in the universe. It was in this same context that he further remarked that the notion of sin belonged to the concepts of primitive religion for which there was absolutely no room in a more rational form of it.'I The formulation of the main prin- ciples of religion which Friedlaender and Bendavid believed to consist of three major tenets: (1) the belief in God, (2) the im- mortality of the soul, and (3) its infinite future perfectibility," was also deistic. Above all, however, it was their uncompro- mising and unimaginative rationalism which demonstrated most clearly their indebtedness to the European Enlightenment. Religion, they repeatedly declared, must rest on clear and ade- quate notions. Otherwise it tends to turn into idolatry.12 It was in the name of this supreme arbiter, reason, that they came to reject the full scope of normative Judaism and declared war on its national character. The second source of influence was that of Moses Mendelssohn. Though he is still almost unanimously regarded as having been a rather conservative force in matters of the Jewish religion, there is ample evidence to substantiate a contrary view. True, he identified revealed Judaism with the Law and de- clared its validity eternal. The scope of that Law, however, and Io "Briefe David Friedlaenders" (September, 1789), no. 2.

As a devout humanitarian and rationalist, he removed from the scope of revelation all metaphysical and ethical truths with- out which, he believed, no human society could exist.13 Reve- lation was thus reduced to the mere proclamation of a set of ceremonial laws,I4 for which he could find no other motivation than the revival of natural religion, the religion supposedly held by the forefathers.'s Indeed, it is rather perplexing to conclude that while God bestowed us with adequate intellectual faculties for the understanding of the principles of our creeds and moral behavior, He deprived us of the ability of keeping them alive within us, thus making revelation necessary.i6 Even more strikingly negative were the reasons Mendelssohn adduced for the necessity of preserving the ceremonial law at present. We must keep the Law in order to be united, and we must be united not because there really exists a natural com- munity of hopes and aspirations among us, but only because the Christian society is plotting to engulf us and thus bring an end to natural religion. Judaism must not be given up in order to make the formation of a uniform Christian society possible. It must be preserved as a purer theism, as a force in the struggle for freedom of thought and the rule of reason.

The continued preservation of the Law is made dependent on the imperfect moral and intellectual state of the non-Jewish society. In a society dominated by the precepts of natural religion, it would lose its raison d'etre and eventually be discarded altogether. At best, Judaism would then survive only as an external ritual, since, as far as such rituals are concerned, plurality rather than uniformity is more natural and conducive to human happiness.I8 What led most of Mendelssohn's critics, the reformists as well as the nationalists, to ascribe to him what they termed a rigid servility to the Law, was their exclusive reliance on his Jerusalem as the exponent of his views, and their failure to corroborate the views expressed there with other data to be found in his cor- respondence and activities.19 His Jerusalem, it must be remem- bered, belongs to the genre of Kampfliteratur, and the opinions expressed in it are strongly colored by political considerations. It was a book intended primarily for the Christian rather than Jewish reader. It was only with reference to the Christian society of his day, whose overtures of toleration to the Jews Mendelssohn clearly perceived as motivated by their desire to convert them, that he declared the Law to be a divine com- mandment and not a commodity to be traded for emancipation. Greater than his genuine concern for the fate of Judaism and its future survival was his abhorrence of the idea of a Christian '7 Letters to Herz Homberg of September 22, 1783 and of March 1, 1784, Gesammelte Schriften, V (1844), 669, 670. 18 Letter to Graf von Linar, Gesammelte Schriften, V, 504. 9g For the criticism of Mendelssohn's concept of Judaism by the reformists, cf.

In addition to these considerations emanating from an inner analysis of his views, there is ample evidence from other sources pointing to a much less rigid and more qualified view of his doctrine of the eternal validity of the Law. In this context, only brief mention of this evidence will be made. To this belongs his critical, though restrained, remark in his reply to Lavater on the "many additions and distortions of human origin" in Judaism,20 the reformatory though moderate views he expressed in his let- ters to Paulus Best2 and Sophie Becker,22 his reply to Michaelis with reference to the possibility of reconciling the Law with the civil duties their anticipated emancipation would impose on the Jews,23 and his remark to the effect that Judaism was not neces- sarily the sole way to happiness though it might have been the best "for certain times, circumstances and under certain condi- tions."24 Last but not least evidence is his nonchalant attitude to the violations of the Law by some of his close friends25 and the members of his own family, as well as his more than liberal attitude to the Jewish upbringing of his children and especially his beloved son Joseph.26 Whatever interpretation one may give to Mendelssohn's views nowadays, it is clear that, as far as his own contemporaries are concerned, especially those whose views are considered here, they all treated his alleged conservatism "cum grano salis."

The third source of influence to which the views on the Jewish religion of the Maskilim must be ascribed was of a purely utili- tarian nature, namely the desire for emancipation and integration in the civil society. Since the early eighties, with the appearance of the "Toleranz Patent" of Joseph the Second,30 Lessing's Nathan der Weise (1779) and Dohm's Ueber die buergerliche Verbesserung der Juden,3 and as a result of the accruing concessions and privileges granted by Frederick II to some of the richer Prussian Jews,32 the hopes for emancipation seem to have assumed some feasibility.

Indeed, it was the prevailing view in many of the earlier writings of the Enlightenment. The very concepts of religious allegiance and tolerance, Holbach declared, cannot be compromised. "It is inherent in the very nature of the principles of religion not to be tolerant."35 Even Voltaire, the leading anti-Jewish writer of the age, expressed in his own sarcastic manner his readiness "to sit down at one table and share his meal with a Turk, a Chinese, a Hindu and... even a Jew, provided that the Jew should first shed his hateful Jewish superstitions and prejudices."36 Diderot's hateful condemnation of Moses is well known.37 Worth mentioning in this context is his equally spiteful condemnation of the contemporary Jews on account of their obstinate allegiance to the Mosaic Law.38 Even Herder, notwithstanding his great admiration for the books of the Bible, insisted that the pleas of the Jews for emancipation should go ignored as long as they remain so determinedly loyal to their Law and national aspirations.39 To conclude, it was these factors of a rational deism on the one hand and the desire for political and social emancipation, on the other hand, greatly promoted by the pattern of Mendels- sohn's life and the logical inferences one could draw from his 33 Dohm, op. cit., II, pp. 33-64, 89-111. 34 M.

David Friedlaender. It has been mentioned before that all these Maskilim, regard- less of the extremity of their views, claimed to be the true ex- ponents of the pure teachings of Moses. This was especially the case with Friedlaender. What he meant, however, by it reduced itself to the moral teaching of the prophets conceived as impreganted with a universal humanitarianism and utterly divorced from the national frame. In conformity with the views of Mendelssohn, Friedlaender identified the period of the forefathers as that of natural religion. Such a religion, generally interpreted in the terms of deism, was, he declared, completely adequate. As a result, how- ever, of the Egyptian bondage it suffered decline and it was for the sake of resuscitating it that revelation became necessary.39a Such a theory, upholding the subservient and temporary nature of the ceremonial law, was wholeheartedly embraced by many Maskilim since it was most plausible to demand in its very name the utter abolition of the ceremonial law on grounds that it has become superfluous in an age of lofty humanitarianism and rational religion. The historical element of the Torah, to which Mendelssohn already ascribed a lesser phenomenological value,40 Friedlaender rejected altogether as inconsistent with recent investigations.4' Again, its legal and ceremonial aspects he considered only a temporary commandment intended for mere educational pur- poses, a concession to the primitive customs and creed of a people just emerging from lower stages of culture and worship.42 As a result of this view, Friedlaender considered the codification 39a Cf.

He deemed it an urgent neces- sity in view of the changing status of Jewry in modern times. This elaborate law, with its salient emphasis on Jewish nation- alism, he repeatedly emphasized, constituted the greatest barrier between the Jews and non-Jews. Besides being meaningless to the modern Jew, these ceremonies were "time consuming, ex- pensive and stigmatized the Jew as a stranger in society. They contributed no little to the feeling of hate towards him."44 For years Friedlaender devoted much of his energy to a struggle on two fronts. He led the struggle for the emancipation of Prussian Jewry, and he headed the assault of the extreme Mas- kilim upon all forms of historical Judaism. The two, in his view, were closely connected. The complete surrender of its national- historical character was, he thought, the price Jewry must pay for the sake of its absorption in civil society.45 He greeted the 1812 decree, emancipating the Jews politically, with the greatest satisfaction and joy, and considered it a turning point in the history of the Jews of Prussia. He could now, he felt, look hopefully to the future when the Jews, after they had reformed their education, religion and economic structure, would finally obliterate all traces of their uniqueness and fully integrate in society.46 It was, therefore, with real satisfaction and pride that he pointed to the ever-increasing tendencies of assimilation which he saw gaining ground among the Prussian Jews.

Lazarus Bendavid. Less active in the political struggle for emancipation and gen- erally more aloof to the Haskalah movement was Lazarus Ben- david,48 one of the early interpreters and disseminators of Kant's critical philosophy. His concept of Judaism was not essentially different from the one held by Friedlaender and identical in substance with the general concepts of the deists: the belief in the existence of God, the immortality of the soul, and the constant progress of the human soul to higher forms of perfec- tion.49 It was in these principles that he saw the gist of the pure teachings of Moses.50 The elaborate structure of the Law, he declared, was only a fence erected around "the inner garden of Judaism." And while it might have had its raison d'gtre in past generations distinguished by their Sklavensinn, there is no justification whatsoever for its continued preservation in the present, when under the impact of the Enlightenment "which had reached the huts of the Jews" their zeal for the customs of the past greatly diminished.5' The Jews, Bendavid repeatedly asserted, must be integrated in the civil society, and the only way to achieve it is by a complete abolition of the ceremonial law which is "meaningless and harm- 47 Ueber die Verbesserung der Israeliten im Koenigreiche Polen, p. 40. 48 His autobiography appeared in Loewe, Bildnisse jetzt lebender berliner Gelehrten mit ihren Selbstbiographien, zweite Sammlung, (Berlin, 1806); see on him also I.

The preoc- cupation of the Jews with that law, he declared, to the utter exclusion of all other intellectual pursuits, has not only had a negative effect on their appearance and mannerisms, but per- verted their emotions and thoughts as well.52 Indeed, in some respects, Bendavid was even more extreme than Friedlaender. Of orthodox Jewry he spoke with real hate and compared it to a hydra "all of whose heads must be cut off at once if one is to prevent the regrowing of two heads in place of the one cut off."52a True, he opposed conversion but not on religious or national grounds. "The converts," he wrote, "can- not be blamed for preferring the well-attended and joyful church to the desolate and gloomy synagogue." As a solution, however, to the problem of Jewry, conversion fails. The converts are merely "splinters of the colossus" and instead of weakening rather serve to strengthen it.52b Since Bendavid did not believe that Jewry would initiate its reform by its own free will, he appealed to the government to use its influence and power in order to bringabout the abolition of the ceremonial law.53 To the knowledge of the present writer, this was the first instance in modern times that a Jew publicly requested his government to interfere with the inner religious life of his people. 3. Shaul Ascher. More systematic, moderate and somewhat more constructive in his views on Judaism, was the lesser known Shaul Ascher. He shared with the other Maskilim of his time the deep desire for political emancipation and social integration. Like them, he also believed that this ideal could hardly be attained without the abolition of "old constitution" of Judaism. In contrast, how- ever, to them, he was genuinely concerned with the continued existence of Judaism and looked for ways and means of safe- 52 Ibid., pp. 27-29.

[22] 60</page><page sequence="23">[23] JEWISH RELIGION IN LITERATURE OF BERLIN HASKALAH 61 guarding it. It was the search for a compromise between these two ideals which constituted the central theme of his Leviathan.54 Such a search necessarily brought him into an ideological con- flict with the two extreme views of the age, represented by Mendelssohn and Friedlaender. It was in refutation of their ideas and concepts that he attempted to formulate his own. In opposition to Mendelssohn's legalistic concept of Judaism, he defined it as a faith fundamentally based on most of the thirteen articles of Maimonides. Were the purpose of the re- vealed Law, he argued, to revive the purer notions of natural religion, then it should be discarded as soon as the Vernunfts- Wahrheiten underlying it have been conceived and embraced. If again its aim was to form a Mosaic system of government (eine mosaische Verfassung), it must likewise be abolished with the abolition of that system.55 Mendelssohn's concept of Judaism as a religion granting full freedom of contemplation to its followers while binding them in the realm of action cannot, Ascher declared, be reconciled with the new ideal of integration in the civil state. Freedom of the intellect is not sufficient. With it must come also full freedom of the will. Religion must not be allowed to be an obstacle to loyal citizenship.56 On the other hand, Ascher argued also vehemently against the negativistic views of Friedlaender reducing Judaism to a few abstractions of the deists. Were these views to win general acceptance, the anticipated emancipation, for whose cause Friedlaender was struggling valiantly, would then become a meaningless affair, for in the final analysis it would not be "Jews" who would be its beneficiaries but mere Naturmenschen.57 Ascher was in full accord with Friedlaender's view on the untenability of the ceremonial law in the present. The "old constitution" of Judaism, he declared must be abolished. "We 54 S.

For the achievement of this purpose, he suggested that three steps be undertaken. First, there must be made a thorough study of the sources, history and essence of Judaism, the crowning effort of which would result in a "theoretical dogmatism" of our faith. Second, a "practical dogmatism" must be formulated. Finally, some "religious sym- bols" must be selected which the people will oblige themselves to preserve.59 To illustrate his views more clearly, Ascher drew up, at the end of his study, a tentative list of fourteen articles, the first ten of which were meant as dogmas of faith, while the other four, as "religious symbols." Noteworthy is the fact that among his dogmas, he also included some of an historical national character, such as the belief in God "who revealed Himself unto our fathers Abraham, Isaac and Jacob," and the revelation at Mt. Sinai. Other dogmas contained the assertion of belief in prophecy, re- ward and punishment, and even in the Messiah, though the latter was defined in a rather general and spiritual manner.6? The "practical symbols" which Ascher suggested as a means of "binding us together" were: circumcision, the Sabbath as a "holy day to God," and holidays as well as fastdays.6' The weakness inherent in Ascher's structure, in a theoretical as well as in a practical sense, is too obvious to require any elaborate analysis. Though his arguments against both Men- delssohn and Friedlaender are no doubt valid, his own con- clusions are not impressive at all. Metaphorically speaking, he seems to bar the front entrance to the ceremonial law only to admit it through the rear door, and consequently the demand for complete freedom of action seems to have been, partly at least, s8 Ibid., III, pp. 227-228. 59 Ibid., III, pp. 235-236. 60 Ibid., III, pp. 237-240. 6i Ibid., pp. 239-240. 62 [24]</page><page sequence="25">[25] JEWISH RELIGION IN LITERATURE OF BERLIN HASKALAH 63 given up. But whatever the value of Ascher's reformatory at- tempt - and all such arbitrary attempts are doomed to fail by their very nature - it was indicative of the searching tendencies which had set in among the more thoughtful Maskilim to find a new formula of Judaism that would enable the new generation to satisfy its desire for political and social emancipation without having to pay the high price of self-destruction. 4. Shelomo Maimon. An inner criticism of Judaism, especially as related to the methods of its legalistic elaboration, came from the great inter- preter and critic of Kant, Shelomo Maimon.62 He was the only Maskil who dealt with the issue as an insider and, though fully emancipated from the ideals and beliefs of orthodox Juda- ism, considered it nevertheless with a certain degree of objectivity and even appreciation. Maimon divided the historical development of Judaism into five periods. The first was that of the forefathers who were in his view - a view shared by almost all the Maskilim - believers in natural religion. The second period, that of revealed religion, began with Moses and ended with the compilation of the Mish- nah. During the third period, the Talmudic, the Mishnah was interpreted and elaborated. The fourth and fifth periods followed the completion of the Talmud during which time the great legalistic development of Judaism on the foundations of the Talmud took place.63 Above all, Maimon pointed out the artificial nature of the methods the sages of the Oral Tradition had used in their cease- less effort to encompass with their legal network the full range of Jewish life against the ever-changing conditions of time and 62 On his philosophy in general, see Shelomo Maimon, Masah al ha-Fitoso- fiah ha-Transzendentalith, meturgam ve-'arukh bi-yedei S.

By the use of a spitzfindige Dialektik, he asserted, the rabbis turned the Holy Scriptures into a source not only for those laws for which there might have been a foundation, but also for many other laws for which hardly any basis could be found.64 Many of the Jewish laws, Maimon further observed - proba- bly under the influence of some of the Enlightened - were the result of foreign influences. To Arab origin he traced such cus- toms as covering the head, washing the hands, and fasting. Many other laws he traced to the ensuing tensions between the Jews and the Greeks as well as the Romans.65 Though Maimon exposed the artificial character of the meth- ods applied by the rabbis in the elaboration of the Oral Tradition and resentfully described the excessive absorption with its study as a geistestoetendes Geschaeft from which one could derive neither spiritual satisfaction nor any intellectual benefit,66 he neverthe- less declared that the application of such methods may have been an historical necessity which enabled the Law to gain universal recognition among the people.67 Moreover, with reference to Jewish theology, it was preserved by the rabbis, Maimon declared, in great purity. In contrast to men like Fried- laender and other critics of Talmudic Judaism who, in the name of purer and loftier notions, criticized the primitive concept of God underlying many midrashim and aggadoth, Maimon ob- served that the anthropomorphic forms of the Deity often en- countered in rabbinical literature must be understood in terms of a mere educational method aiming to bring down the higher concepts of religion to the human intellectual capacity. Indeed, one must learn to differentiate between such modes of expression and the pure notion of God that underlies them. It would be sufficient, Maimon declared, to compare the concept of the heavenly reward as described by the rabbis with the parallel concept of the Moslems in order to realize how much purer and loftier the former was.68 "Indeed," he wrote, "I would have had to compose a whole volume had I wanted to refute the 64 Ibid., pp. 159-160, 164-166. 6s Ibid., p. 167. 66 Ibid., p. 165. 67 Ibid., pp. 174-176. 68 Ibid., pp. 168-171, 177.

Their only fault was their overzealousness. He described their morality as true stoicism which insists not only on good actions but on holiness of thought as well.71 Maimon's words of praise for the practical morality of the Polish Jews - their honesty and loyalty, the purity of their family life, their brotherly devotion that manifests itself so humanely in their numerous welfare institutions - were prob- ably in direct reply to the campaign of slander and abuse against the Polish Jews in the Haskalah literature.71 Since the Polish Jews, he remarked sarcastically, clearly alluding to some of these criticisms, may be lacking in gallantry and social amenity, "your ladies need not therefore fear their courting." They still treat their women in the old-fashioned manner, but are much more considerate of their duties and obligations toward them. True, their children do not know to recite phrases learned by heart to demonstrate their love and respect for their parents (what wonder, they have no French demoiselles); "however, they show their love for them in a much deeper and more sincere manner.72 Maimon was not only unique by his courageous defense of the Talmud, the rabbis and the Polish Jews, but also by his insight into some of the moral flaws which accompanied the spread of the Enlightenment among the Jews of Germany and the West.

In- deed, it was only in the enlightened environment of Germany, where he observed Haskalah at work, that he came to realize the deep morality, integrity, and inner strength of orthodox Jewry against which the allegedly lofty moral notions and principles of the Maskilim appeared verbose, shallow and mere empty formalisms. 5. Halle Wolfsohn. To the extreme group of Maskilim belonged also Halle Wolf- sohn,73 who had made his literary debut in the Meassef of 1788 where he published a number of didactic parables and popular essays on the natural sciences.74 In 1790 he became the editor of the Meassef,75 and soon launched an aggressive policy. The moderate and conciliatory attitude, characteristic of the former volumes, was discarded and a Kulturkampf was declared on orthodox Jewry. Indicative of this new tendency was Wolfsohn's laudatory poem in honor of David Friedlaender, which appeared in the first issue of the Meassef under his editorship.76 In it Friedlaender was lauded as the fighter of obscurantism and religious bigotry. Henceforth, the struggle against orthodox Jewry became the central topic of all subsequent issues. With the cessation of the Meassef there came an end to Wolf- sohn's literary activities in Hebrew. He continued, however, with his crusading on behalf of the Haskalah in German. In 1798 he wrote his Lustspiel, Leichtsinn und Froemmelei (Fri- volity and Hypocrisy),77 and in 1804, his Jeshurun.

In Reb Yosefke, the corrupt and dis- solute Melammed from Poland, Wolfsohn no doubt intended to portray the utter corruption, dishonesty and hypocrisy of the Polish Melammedim, and possibly of the Polish Jews in general. Of a more serious nature was his Jeshurun,78 an apologetic work in which he undertook to combat the various accusations hurled against the Jews in a number of pamphlets which appeared during the early years of the nineteenth century.79 Wolfsohn's refutation of the antisemitic slanders will not be considered here. Suffice it to note that on the whole they were too timid and restrained to have had any effect on public opinion. Though he rejected many of the accusations against orthodox Jewry and asserted that most of the evils ascribed to them were the outcome of the many disabilities under which they lived, he admitted nevertheless "that the moral corruption of these Jews is also due to the inner nature of the people."8? As far as his views on the contemporary Jews and Judaism are concerned, he referred the reader to Friedlaender's Send- schreiben and Bendavid's Zur Charakteristik der Juden as sources for their best expression. The views of the Sendschreiben he believed to be in the true spirit of Mendelssohn. He also praised as true to life Bendavid's division of contemporary Jewry into four groups, and declared "that it would be unjust" to cast all the Jews into one category; that the differences between orthodox and enlightened Jews "are much greater than between Prot- estants and Catholics."8' Wolfsohn concluded his Jeschurun with a detailed project for the cultural and socio-political reform of Jewry. First, he sug- gested the reform of Jewish education.

In order to enforce this, he suggested that no Jew should be allowed to settle anywhere unless he could produce a certificate to prove that he attended such a school for a number of years.82 Secondly, he suggested that the powers of the rabbis be curtailed. The position of the rabbi, he believed, could be abolished altogether and substituted with a preacher whose sole task would be to deliver "moral sermons in German." Nobody, of course, must be allowed to serve in such a capacity, who had not received a systematic secular education in languages, sciences and history. He further suggested that the government should use its power to have the Jewish liturgy purged and introduce more orderliness and decorum into the synagogue. The Hebrew language, he de- clared, as well as some prayers should be eliminated from the service. He also suggested a rigorous revision of the Talmud and midrashim to eliminate all biased passages. Books by in- dividual rabbis, containing such passages must also be banned. Finally, a strict censorship on all Hebrew books must be estab- lished and only those books that aim to diffuse morality and enlightenment should be published. Were the government, Wolf- sohn concluded, to implement his suggestions, the Jews would in the course of one or two generations become incorporated within the state as useful and loyal citizens.83 Though all the extreme German Maskilim - it may be con- cluded - stressed the pragmatic point of view in their attitude to religion in general, they failed - with the sole exception of Ascher - to give the slightest consideration to this very point of view in their analysis of Judaism. They divorced it com- pletely from its historical frame and destiny and failed to take into consideration the functional role of Judaism in preserving the Jewish people. If one is to further realize the fact that the onslaught on the ceremonial law was usually accompanied by an equally bitter attack upon all forms of Jewish nationalism, the destructive nature of their views becomes more than apparent. 83 Ibid., pp. 124-133.
