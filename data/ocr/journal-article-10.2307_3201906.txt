<plain_text><page sequence="1">the human. But, Boehrer's translation of anthropomorphism into some- thing that happens to humans as opposed to something that happens to animals in human perception of them seems to allow for a reading that sometimes offers "bestialization" as a kind of symbolic social cat- egory rather than as a natural possibility; that speaks of real animals in its framework but sometimes ends up with mere imagery in other parts without tracing the difference, or the links. This seems to be at odds with Boehrer's stated desire, in both the opening and closing of the book, to engage with political and ethical issues. Of course, this con- centration on the human is inevitable: when reading the animals in early modem drama we are always reading human constructions of animals, and the critic of past cultures must deal with this issue, must think about the limitations of his/her field and how they might be used ethi- cally. To relocate the human is, I think, one logical possibility. However, while Boehrer does this, once into his Shakespearean work the ethics do seem to get rather left behind. The three categories of thought that he sets up become ways of reading some of the plays of the period and it is not always clear how these readings go beyond liter- ary studies. ShakespeareAmong theAnimals is simultaneously a frustrating and interesting book. It takes the possibility of the constructed nature of the human in early modern drama seriously, but at the same time, it makes certain claims-claims about the cultural and ethical significance of ecocriticism, for example-that it does not really address explicitly in its central chapters. The essays do, though, propose the possibility of taking animals, even those at the heart of the literary canon, seriously, and perhaps this is their importance. As Boehrer says at the end of his suggestions for further reading, "I hope this book may encourage read- ers to dig into the wider body of literature with which I have concluded this study" (182). I hope so, too. Erica Fudge, Middlesex University AvailableMeans: AnAnthology of Women Rhetorc(s). Edited byJoy Ritchie and Kate Ronald. Pittsburgh Series in Composition, Literacy, and Cul- ture.

The rich title of this collection, taken from Aristotle's well-known definition of rhetoric-"discovery of the available means of persuasion"-reflects the authors' "desire to locate women squarely within rhetoric but also to acknowledge that their presence demands that rhetoric be reconceived" (xvii). Both the authors' inspiration for editing this collection and scope of the work are embedded within the title's famous allusion to classical rhetoric. As the authors explain, The discovery of the available means was for Aristotle an act of invention that always assumed the right to speak in the first place and, even prior to that, assumed the right to personhood and self-representation, rights that hare not long been available to women.... We want to reclaim Aristotle's words, then, to mark the ways in which women have discov- ered various means by which to make their voices heard. But we also intend by our title to point to the ways that women have discovered different means of persuasion, of- ten based in contexts other than those Aristotle might have imagined: the kitchen, parlor, and the nursery; the garden; the church, the body. (xvii) Arranged chronologically, the "gathering" of over 70 women writers and speakers in this collection is varied. Some were well schooled in the appeals, logic, and conventions of traditional rhetoric (Margaret Fell, Ida B. Wells, Mary Astell) and adopted available means for unconven- tional ends. Others-such as Heloise, Zora Neale Hurston, and Dor- othy Allison-do not accommodate audience expectations, develop ethos in traditional ways, or strive for rhetorical "eloquence"-hence the term "rhetoric(s)" in the collection's subtitle. By gathering a broad range of women rhetors-representing "differences in race, class, sexual orientation, and historical and physical locations" (xx)-in one place, the authors not only make readily available to scholars and students a diverse collection of work by women rhetors, but also defy traditional definitions of canon. Many of the selections here come from contexts and topoi outside traditional boundaries of rhetoric: experiences of breast cancer, physical disability, illiteracy. This collection includes: (1) primary works central to scholarship in women's rhetoric (Aspasia, Margery Kempe, Margaret Fuller, Ida B. Wells); (2) works by women writers defining what it means to write as a 113</page><page sequence="3">woman (Helene Cixous, Adrienne Rich, Alice Walker); (3) writers who have advanced the cause of women's rights in the civic sphere (Marga- ret Sanger, Hortensia, Angelina Grimke); and (4) works that have ex- panded notions of rhetorical form (Saint Catherine of Siena's letters, Alice Dunbar Nelson's newspaper columns, Dorothy Day's meditations on public events). What works aren't included? Often anthologized pieces (Woolf's "A Room of One's Own"), "narrowly professional work in composition" (xxi), any form of "literary" text (such as poetry by Sappho), and writing without rhetorical intent. Repeatedly the speakers and writers in this anthology argue for the (long denied to women) rights to education and participation in the public sphere. Admittedly, the authors are "less interested in arguments about historiography" (xxiii)-evidenced in recent arguments about how to represent women rhetors such as Aspasia and Hortensia whose works survive only through the writing of Plato and Plutarch-and overtly interested in the fact that "women have been silenced throughout history" (xxiii). In this collection, alternate rhetorical means to represent women's subjectivity-Sojourner Truth's use of her own body to define women, Emma Goldman's definition of women in terms outside of marriage, Paula Gunn Allen's embracing of "the ancient epistemology of the grandmothers" (xxv)-leads to rhetorical action and portrayals of women opposing traditional cultural representations. "In the absence of an established body of rhetorical theory by women" (xxvii), the edi- tors hope that studying acts of rhetoric will lead scholars and students to read women's rhetorics as theory, to see the direct correlation be- tween theory/actions and "reflection on practice and practice itself" (xxvii). Available Means is an important and unparalleled addition to recent recovery and revisionist scholarship concerning women's rhetoric. This work expands notions of recovery by positioning the words of reclaimed women rhetoricians next to other women's voices. As a result, we don't read a woman rhetorician's work within the context of the traditional canon and recognized rhetorical framework of her day, but rather within the stream of female voices that came before and after her. Building on works by Gere, Glenn, Logan, Lunsford, Phelps and Emig, Ratcliffe, and Royster, the editors explode traditional studies of women's rhetoric based on universal portrayals of women rather than exigencies of lo- cale, race, economic conditions, age, physical limitations, sexual orien- tation, and/or colonization. The editors (echoing many of the authors included in this work) argue that gender identities are not prescribed or 114 Book Reviews</page><page sequence="4">South Atlantic Review "natural," but rather are often socially constructed and subjective. The range of selections gathered here (marked by varieties in topoi, language, ethos, style, delivery), the chronological representation of the silencing of women through the ages, and the sheer number of readings explic- itly and implicitly stressing the need for women to continue to fight for literacy and voice in the public sphere (despite mass literacy and politi- cal permission to speak in public) set this work apart from recent schol- arship. As an anthology for students/scholars, Available Means gathers in one volume a wealth of information that both subverts and enlarges our understanding of rhetorical theory and action. Finally, Ritchie's and Ronald's brilliant introduction to this anthology raises pivotal questions concerning women's writing and rhetorical theory, the teaching of writ- ing, and the possibility of recreating traditional, exclusive notions of canon within women's studies. Available Means is yet another impressive and important work pub- lished under the auspices of the Pittsburgh Series in Composition, Lit- eracy, and Culture.
