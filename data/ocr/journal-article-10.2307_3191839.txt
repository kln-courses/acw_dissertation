Schwartz In 1953 UNESCO brought out under its imprimatur a symposium of the state- ments on art education contributed by a number of distinguished international authorities. The symposium entitled Ed- ucation and Art also contains a brief contribution by a famous "child psy- chologist" Jean Piaget which contin- ues to have a lasting interest for educa- tors and establishes a Piagetian bench mark with regard to the art educuation field. Piaget's article entitled "Art Educ- ation and Child Psychology" generally makes some points about the relatively evanescent character of artistic devel- opment among children and urges re- cognition of this important creative at- tribute as well as its sensitive cultivation by teachers and the schools. Three remarks seem to be particularly important and are excerpted in the hope that they will not seem to be lifted from context and will also state some of the initial themes to be developed or at least examined as this paper progresses. They are numbered for reference pur- pose as follows: I. "-it is much more difficult to estab- lish regular stages of development in the case of artistic tendencies than it is in the other mental functions."1 II. "The study of the child at play, es- pecially that kind of symbolic play, usually called games of imagination, reveals that the thought and the af- fective life of the child are directed towards two opposite poles."2 Ill. "-we should welcome as a neces- sary work of liberation any attempt to reintroduce into the framework of teaching that aesthetic life which the very logic of an education based upon intellectual authority tends to eliminate or, at least, to weaken."3 Art educators may hunt with some frustration through the vast body of Piaget's published works for additional elucidation which would directly con- front the central problems of art educa- tion which he so deftly identified. There is much in the extensive Piagetian litera- ture that reflects by implication and in- ference on the concerns of the art ed- ucation field and some of the implica- tions as well as some syntheses by art educators will be examined later on. It has already been stated in other sources that Piaget's origins are in the domains of science, (he authored an authorita- tive treatise on snails at the age of fif- teen) and also philosophy, an early in- terest of his prodigious intellect. Rang- ing backwards and forwards through the philosophical writings made avail- able to him as part of his formal and in- formal studies he ultimately became concerned that speculative philosophy was not per se a satisfying endeavor and that if one were to come to some iden- tifiable position of integral merit that one would have to research the origins and development of knowledge and 6</page><page sequence="2">knowing. His evolving interests led him into a many year sojourn with genetic epistemology, which can be briefly de- fined as the study of development of knowledge and knowing. This analytic quest led logically to a study of the cognitive development of the infant and the subsequent maturational events of the years on up through adolescence. Given his intellectual origins in science and philosophy, Piaget's focus on cognitive development is understand- able as is the relatively more limited in- volvement in investigating "affect," the intuitive and emotional developments related to and akin to art. In a fairly recent and possibly major capstone work and one certainly in- tellectually autobiographical in charac- ter Piaget states that "the classical prob- lems of philosophy can be grouped un- der five main heads" the second of these he designates as, "the normative and non-cognitive disciplines like ethics and aesthetics."4 Perhaps this categori- zation provides a clue as to the centra- tion of Piagetianism and the potential ir- reducibility of certain areas of philo- sophy in the cognitive terms normative to his research and study. Because Piaget's published books alone number more than thirty and because he often speaks through a particular psychologi- cal and philosophical language practi- cally of his own origination (he favors the language of logic and mathematics), a number of scholars have made impor- tant contributions by analyzing and condensing Piaget's publications and by translating and interpreting these into a more generally intelligible form. Herbert Ginsberg and Sylvia Opper have pro- duced a compact and readable analysis of Piagetian literature and have under- scored its importance for teachers par- ticularly. However, when these authors come to the matter of mental imagery and inevitably perhaps to that aspect that deals with drawing they raise some epistemological questions. They remark: Another method of studying mental images is by drawing. Here the person is asked to draw an object previously presented. Since the object is no longer present, he must produce an image of it to yield the drawing. The drawing, therefore, gives some insight into the nature of the image, which is the internal 'picture' of the object. The method of drawing, however, presents several shortcomings. Drawing is not a simple and direct reflection of images, and also it in- volves other processes. Some persons have poor memory. If they have for- gotten their image of an object, they cannot very well draw it. Other per- sons simply cannot draw well It is not their image that is at fault, but their artistic skill.s It is noteworthy that these authors believe that they can assert that in those instances where individuals cannot draw well, "their image is not at fault, but their artistic skill." Of course the whole question of interest to art educa- tors would be the one that deals with "artistic skill." There is some question that drawing some of the simple forms as required by Piaget's methods of clini- cal investigation would ever entail ar- tistic skill. Lack of artistic skill would seem if anything to relate to a faulty memory image particularly in young children where skill development is not even a factor to be seriously consider- ed. The something called "art" is much more a complex phenomenon, "non- cognitive" according to Piaget, and re- quires more than mere skillfull, that is motoric functioning. We recognize that in art we confront a situation in which are employed the abilities to produce some kind of graphic arrangement and which may be entirely lacking in ver- similitude or representative character. Images so produced may be structurally faulty, poorly connected to the world out there, highly charged from the point of affective content, and not at all re- flective of any kind of skill other than the particular motor act by which the representation came about. Then again, what is it to "draw well"? Is there some a priori notion about the meaning of that particular phrase? Art educators would probably be inclined to take issue with the phrase as it refers particu- larly to the work of children. This par- ticular group of educators would be in- clined to accept the individual child's schema as being a good drawing if it on- ly displayed highly subjective and af- fective content. Ginsburg and Opper are undoubtedly reflecting on the studies of the relation- ship between cognitive development and the child's representational abilities as described by Piaget and Inhelder, in The Child's Conception of Space. This monumental work in and of itself dem- onstrates the enormous insights which mark all of Piagetian researches. I am in- clined to believe that if this were Piaget's only claim to fame it would be enough to stamp his efforts with the mark of genius. The revelations which lie in some of its central concerns are enormously important for all teachers and of particular interest to teachers of art working particularly with young children. Some comments taken from Piaget and Inhelder are offered merely as samples of the cognitive thrust of their studies. For example, speaking of children of about 31/2 to 4 years of age: The analysis of tactile kinesthetic ex- ploration and perceptual activity of very young children has shown us that the shape of familiar objects is recognized as a result of prehensile movements involving adaptations dis- tinctive of this level.6 Further: The first geometrical shapes recog- nized by the child are remarkable, not for the properties apparent to ordi- nary sense perception, such as straight lines, curves, angles, etc., but rather for those properties which ab- stract mathematical analysis shows to be much more primitive, such as closed, open, intertwined, etc.7 And in summary of some protocols: Thus we can say quite definitely that each of these children easily distin- guishes an open from a closed figure, a surface with one or two holes from one without holes, a ring from a cir- cle, intertwined rings from separate rings, etc. In other words, the topological relations of open and closed shapes, intertwined and separate shapes gives rise to correct identification. On the other hand, simple euclidian shapes remain undif- ferentiated, apart from the case of the circle where the beginnings of dif- ferentiation may be seen, although how far this extends has yet to be determined.8 Examining the forgoing comments by Piaget and Inhelder heightens our awareness of what Ginsburg and Opper are attempting to describe though evi- dently in an abbreviated fashion neces- sitated by extracting some of the many themes of Piagetian concern and re- search and placing a synopsis of these in one small volume. Nevertheless, what comes through from Piaget and Inhelder is not the kind of content which art educators necessarily seek for an elucidation of the problems inherent in the study of children's art. For Piaget and Inhelder as well as for Ginsburg and Opper the term "art" is merely a term of convenience signifying the re- sults of a motor activity in which images are transcribed to paper, and "drawing" is the term descriptive of the motor ac- tivity. We are not in these works im- pinging on the more central concerns of the art education field and which have been described in terms eminently self- expressive, creative, emotive, etc. While I believe that Piaget in his UNESCO article probably wrapped up the whole field of art education in a statement which should become famil- iar to art teachers everywhere, never- theless, he does not explore, unfortun- ately for us all, the implication of his statements through subsequent re- search efforts and analysis. Further, Piaget does not deal sufficiently for our purposes with questions of affect and those other concerns which I have pre- viously mentioned as being more cen- tral to artistic creativity. While Piaget is interested in problems of translating perception to imagistic terms, he does not report to us the reactions by chil- dren in his clinical investigations which would reveal the area of feelings and emotions. These areas are delimited from his study by the definition of its cognitive orientation. Hence a "person- ality" orientation is not demonstrated. 7</page><page sequence="3">Mason aI?

It is one matter to ask a young child to identify some kind of shape, be it to- pological or euclidian; it is quite anoth- er to note the reactions of the child to the shape. This is more than a matter of mere projection, and as Heinz Werner points out children tend to do more than simply analyze forms: they invest forms with meaning. Werner states that: The average adult generally has a phy- siognomic experience only in his per- ception of other human beings, their faces and bodies. The child, on the other hand, frequently sees physi- ognomic qualities in all objects, an- imate or inanimate. And this exper- ience is by no means identical with the idea of anthropomorphizing ob- jects, with the personification of the inanimate, with the reading of human qualities into lifeless things. Phys- iognomic experience is genetically precedent to anthropomorphism. When, for example, a child pro- nounces such a meaningless figure as this to be "cruel," it does not mean that he has invested the figure with an actual face. It is the physiognomic quality of this sharp-concerned ob- ject to "behave cruelly," just as in the previously cited experiment certain lines were experienced as "gay" or "sad. " Werner's analysis is offered as a way of demonstrating that developmental psychologists may investigate pheno- mena differently and while speaking about drawings may signify the very di- ametrical opposites that Piaget sees in his UNESCO statement (see II above). Yet this dualism of which Piaget speaks seems momentarily reconciled in his own writing, particularly in Play, Dreams, and Imitation in Childhood. Despite the provocative title of the work and the potential relationship to visual art, it is only indirectly and by in- ference that we gain a realization of the potential significance of the develop- ment of Piagetian ideas relative to art education. Here, again, using only small excerpted passages we can give some hint that a potential reconciliation exist- ed in Piagetian thinking between cogni- tion and affect. Inevitably such a recon- ciliation takes place through examin- ation of the relationship between the conscious and the unconscious. Com- menting upon a paper which he presen- ted at the International Conference on 8 Psychoanalysis in Berlin in 1922, a paper in which he states that Sigmund Freud had been interested, Piaget remarks: -the whole thought of the child, being syncretic and pre-logical, offers anal- ogies with 'unconscious' symbolic thought, and even appears to be in- termediate between it and rational thought.10o Then a bit further on in the text and al- most as an elucidation, Piaget com- ments: The unconscious is everywhere and there is an intellectual as well as an affective unconscious. This means that it does not exist as a 'region' and that the difference between con- sciousness and the unconscious is only a matter of gradation or degree of reflection." Given now the whole of mentality as a continuum, distinctions between cognition and affect would seem as on- ly matters of stress or emphasis in any discussion. But we learn from Ginsburg and Opper that as his own psychologic- al system evolved and became more formulated, Piaget, who had been somewhat influenced by Freudian psychology in his early work, finally moved away from Freudian thinking, and that, "As time went on his limited dependence on Freud diminished fur- ther with the result that Piaget's later work is totally devoid of Freudian con- cepts."12 The movement away from Freudian psychology may also symbol- ize in Piaget's work more of a focus and concentration in the conscious segment and cognitive structures of mentality and less concern with the unconscious which we think of as one of the roots of the affective life. The unconscious is a central stream, a well-spring as it were, for artistic developments if we wish to take Freud's view of it and the more elaborated ideas of C.G. Jung.13 John H. Flavell, in his renowned study called The Developmental Psychology of Jean Piaget, takes up the issue of Piaget's valuing of affect, and while quoting at some length from source materials makes the points which can be summarized by the statement that, "Although problems of emotionality, values, personality development, and the like have not been topics of primary professional concern to him, he neither denies their importance nor wishes to negate them as objects of study."14 Flavell cites from Piaget showing that the latter considers that, "-affectivity can be considered as the energetic force of behavior whereas its structure defines cognitive functions." (Inhelder and Piaget 1958)15 Also the all-import- ant functional invariants of accommo- dation and assimilation operate signifi- cantly in the affective area interactively with their cognitive analogue. But ac- cording to Piaget affectivity and cogni- tion are not only analogues, they are in- separable and dual facets of intellectual structures, schemes which have an af- fective and intellectual aspect (an ap- parent modification of point II above). These two aspects are sorted out for purpose of an incisive clinical examin- ation of the intellectual component. Consequently one feels upon reading Piaget that because personality is not fully explored, Piagetian literature does not seem to produce a whole picture of the individual. Art educators would subscribe to Susanne Langer's view that "art education is the education of feel- ing," feeling being defined in terms of its emotion and sensation compon- ents.16 If Langer's view comes closer to the center of the art education field, that is the affective center, more than what we are able to infer from Piagetian sources, then I am concerned with at- tempts to create a cognitive base for a non-cognitive field as attempted by art educator, Mary Rouse. Dr. Rouse con- tends that art education as educational theory is in a state of "chaos" because it is more hung up than other curricular areas with regard to the problems relat- ed to "individual differences." Further she derives from Jerome Bruner the no- tion that individual differences are to be viewed, "as mainly negative factors" in the quest of identifying, "the common- alities of behavior which can help us establish as optimum a set of conditions as possible for the changing of art behaviors from lower levels to higher levels."17 Also she proposes to, "fit my model around Piaget's developmental theory, simply because most of what I have found confirms the validity of that theory for such purposes."18 As an addi- tional device the developmental stages derived from Piaget are divided into a structure of behaviors according to and derived from Asahel Woodruff. Com- ponent behaviors include those related to perception, knowing, choosing, and production. Each of these is dealt with under the Piagetian stages which Dr. Rouse feels are appropriate for art teachers working with children starting at about four years of age encompas- sing: The Stage of Intuitive Thought, The Stage of Concrete Operations (including an early stage), and The Formal Oper- ations Stage. Dr. Rouse's efforts have much to commend them, for they do provide a well-thought-out cognitive al- beit eclectic structure as a basis for an art education program, kindergarten</page><page sequence="4">through twelfth grade. I am not sure that the various psychologists whom she has made to lie down together are in reality amiable bedfellows. For exam- ple, Jean Piaget interviewed in The New York Times (October 19, 1972, p. 49) is quoted as having said, "I never under- stood Jerome Bruner. ... and I don't think he ever understood me." If the quotation can be taken at face value, it makes one worry that if important cognitive psychologists suffer from ap- parently basic disagreements, then ar- ranging them and their theories as an imperative basis for art education may be more a matter of adroit juxtaposi- tions than a matter of coming up with a consistent and integrated curricular platform as suggested by Dr. Rouse. Fur- ther, it may also be of extreme import- ance for art education, if not its total significance, to function in relationship to the inconveniences of "individual differences," rather than matching gen- eralized cognitive stages with their ap- parent behavioral and curricular coun- terparts. Do then the values of an art education program speak to a rather dif- ferent developmental structure as sug- gested by Piaget? (see: I and II above). While we may strongly desire to carve out for art education the same or equal cognitive footing and create parallel sequences with such curricular fields as mathematics, science, and social science, perhaps this is neither conven- ient nor completely possible at this time. Further, what Dr. Rouse does not suggest is something of great import- ance that Piaget himself hints at when he says, "The facts show two parallel structures, the affective aspect and the cognitive aspect which are com- plementary, but without one being the cause of the other."19 Also he says, "My hypothesis is that it is impossible to ex- plain affect by intelligence, that is we cannot say that intelligence is the cause of affectivity-."20 And as if to admit to the possibility of a parallel set of struc- tures, Piaget remarks, "The great pro- blem is knowing if there exists in the field of feelings, something that cor- responds to conservation in the cogni- tive field, and mainly if there is some- thing that corresponds to reversible operations."21 Educators generally in various curricular fields seem anxious to establish the relevant connections bet- ween Piagetian stages and cognitive structures and the particular subject area. Among art educators, Kenneth Lan- sing contributes a fuller view of the im- plications of Piagetian research with re- gard to its relevance to the teaching of art that goes on in the schools. Not- eably he attempts comparison between the ideas of Piaget and those of Viktor Lowenfeld. He also points out an appar- ent problem in reconciliation of the findings of the two researchers partic- ularly when Lowenfeld's "haptic" and "visual" typology is taken into consider- ation. Lowenfeld, you will recall, de- scribed the visual type and the haptic type as follows: -the visual type starts from his en- vironment, that he feels as a specta- tor, and that his intermediaries for his experiences are mainly his eyes. The other which we shall call the haptic type is primarily concerned with his own body sensations and the subjec- tive experiences in which he feels emotionally involved.22 Lansing goes on to say that, "-the non- visual in Lowenfeld's opinion is a per- son who cannot coordinate his partial impressions to form a mental image."23 Further, "The tendency is an inherited one.1124 Also: Now Piaget says that a coordinated concept of the world depends upon perceptual action in relation to a point of reference. This would suggest that Lowenfeld's haptic or non-visual person could have his spatial con- cepts developed. At any rate the pos- sibilities are interesting to contem- plate.25 From Lansing's comments we can infer that some art educators are made un- comfortable by a view of human devel- opment which in Piagetian conceptual- izations is couched in terms that deal with the problem of development from an eminently cognitive viewpoint de- void of the implications of subjec- tive/ affective valuing and content. It is evident also that some art educators can more neatly tie together Piaget's developmental stages and art education programs in the schools when they dis- miss individual differences as "negative factors." The evolution or possibly re- gression of the art education field be- comes currently visible when its ration- ales are shifted from a primarily affec- tive to a primarily cognitive emphasis. What seems evident also is that the aesthetic and liberated life (see: point III above) cultivated through the arts, tied as it is to affectivity, is at last put to flight, not by Piaget's genetic epistemology, but by a tendency within art education.
