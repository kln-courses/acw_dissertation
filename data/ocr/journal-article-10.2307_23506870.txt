<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TARGUM TO EZEKIEL SAMSON H. LEVEY Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, Los Angeles rpHE Targum to Ezekiel is an intriguing exegetical vehicle too long -1- neglected by modern Bible scholars, yet, when critically analyzed, it provides us with a vivid insight into an area of Jewish theological speculation which stretches far back into the history of Jewish religious thought. The Book of Ezekiel itself is a complex literary document which chal lenges the most incisive analysts.1 The severe nature of this complexity is compounded by a difficult Masoretic text, abundant grammatical and syntactical problems, an infusion of Aramaisms as well as a sprinkling of Aramaic vocabulary and linguistic peculiarities.2 Additionally, Tor rey's argument and the Qumran material have aroused some speculative questions and problems regarding the date and substantive elements in Ezekiel.3 Almost totally ignored in Ezekiel studies is the Targum to this book.4 And yet, the Targum to Ezekiel is a challenging version which is worthy of special consideration, not alone for its illumination of the biblical 1 Among the most cogent discussions of the subject are the arguments and counterarguments counterarguments between C.

The other versions, Syriac, Old Latin and Vul gate have only limited value... because they are all heavily dependent upon the LXX." Note that there is no reference to the Targum at all. The targumic inter pretation is also overlooked by many competent contemporary scholars including Eichrodt and Fohrer, although it is cited occasionally by Kittel in his Biblia Hebraica. 139</page><page sequence="2">140 SAMSON H. LEVEY [2] text, but for its intrinsic value for targumic study per se. It, too, like the Book of Ezekiel, is a complex literary document posing problems of different kinds, literary, exegetical and theological. A major consideration is its place within the framework of Targum Jonathan to the Prophets and the possibility of divergent origins and authorship, all of which will be probed in the course of this study. In general, the Targum to Ezekiel follows the pattern of explanation and interpretation characteristic of the official Targumim.5 The exegetical complement is used to enlarge on terse passages in the Hebrew text, paraphrase is employed where the text is obscure, prose renderings sim plify the biblical poetry, and similar devices are designed to make Scripture intelligible to the Aramaic-speaking Jews. Beyond this, the Targum to Ezekiel has some peculiarities distinctively its own. We propose to cover the most significant elements of the exegesis which this Targum exhibits. The targumic pattern of skirting or avoiding the anthropomorphisms in the biblical text is clearly evident. When the prophet refers to the deity in blatantly human terms, the Targum modifies the portrayal by inter posing the Memra (1:8; 2:3; 3:7; 5:11, 13; 7:4, 9, passim); or the She kinahkinah (1:1, 14; 3:12, passim); or the convenient min qadam (1:3; 7:1, passim). The phrase "the hand of YHWH was upon me" is invariably translated 37:1 ;33:22 ;8:1 ;3:14,22 ;1:3) שרת עלי רוח נבואה מן קדם יוי; 40:1, passim). With reference to the God-concept of rabbinic Judaism, the Targum generally presents the normative point of view, but supplies a mystic tone in the Merkabah. The belief that prophecy was impossible outside the land of Israel,6 presents a problem in 1:3. The Targum forestalls the issue by stating, "The word of prophecy from before the Lord was with Ezekiel son of Buzi the priest in the land of Israel, and again once more He spoke with him in the land of the Chaldeans on the River Chebar;..." This is a reflection of the idea that once a man began his prophecy in the Holy Land, he qualified for a continuation of prophecy outside the land,7 and in this, too, the Targum presents nothing new or innovative. There are, however, some startling aspects of the Targum to Ezekiel, areas of exegesis totally different from the other renderings of Targum 5 See W. Bâcher, "Targum," JE, XII, 1906; P. Churgin, Targum Jonathan to to the Prophets, New Haven, 1927; S.H. Levey, The Messiah—An Aramaic Inter pretation,pretation, Cincinnati, 1974. 6 Sifre, Shoftim 175.

The process by which the official Targum originally came into being may not have applied to Ezekiel. That process involved the use of Scripture in the original Hebrew as integral to Jewish worship, and the practice of translation into Aramaic of the biblical text by a Meturge man.9 But the wary approach to Ezekiel by the religious authorities10 and the specific prohibition against reading chapter 1 for the Haftarah,11 must have militated against rendering the prophet into Aramaic in the usual manner. The caveat undoubtedly is connected with Merkabah Mysticism, based in some measure on Ezekiel's account of the celestial chariot. M. Hag. 2:1 issues an interdict against expounding the Merkabah even for one singular person, "unless he is a sage who understands it with his own mind," i.e. one who is so brilliant that he needs no teacher to expound it for him. The very wording of the Mishnah,12 אלא אם כן היה חכם, seems to imply that there was a mystical tradition by which one might appropriate a knowledge of the Merkabah through other than the usual channels of learning and transmission, which will be discussed more fully later in this article. In any case, Ezekiel's portrait of the divine throne and the speculative mysticism which it evoked surely must have been a matter which the authorities sought to conceal,13 especially from the masses; hence the Targum, the vehicle of popular exposition, had to be carefully worded, esoteric, and comprehended with caution. To understand the Targum to Ezekiel we must look to the association of Merkabah Mysticism with the prophecy of Ezekiel. We must also recognize the historical situation when Merkabah Mysticism becomes the instrumentality for the preservation of the ego-structure of the Jew ish people in the face of critical threats to its survival. Immediately apparent are the crises of 586 B.C.E. and 70 C.E., the destruction of the two Temples of Jerusalem. These Sanctuaries had been symbols 8 Cf. for example, S. H. Levey, The Messiah—An Aramaic Interpretation, pp. 78-87. 9 M.Meg. 4:4. 10 Shab. 13b; Men. 45a; Hag. 13a —א"ר יהודה אמר רב, ברם זכור אותו איש לטוב וחנניה בן חזקיה שמו שאלמלא הוא נגנז ספר יחזקאל שהיו דבריו סותרין דברי תורה. 11 M. Meg. 4:10. 12 The Gemara explains that the phrase אלא אם כן היה חכם ומבין מדעתו refers not only to Merkabah, but to מעשה בראשית and עריות as well, Hag. lib. This, however, seems to be a subterfuge, since the use of the singular forms seems to indicate that the phrase applies only to the Merkabah. 13 Pesahim 119a— מאי למכסה עתיק, זה המכסה דברים שכיסה עתיק יומין, ומאי נינהו, סתרי תורה.</page><page sequence="4">[4] 142 SAMSON H. LEVEY of the faith of Israel and the validity of the Jewish God-concept. The two situations had much in common in terms of the indispensable need to establish a surrogate for the demolished Sanctuary. If this had not been done, the Jewish religion might have perished in the conflagrations set by Nebuchadnezzar and Titus, and with it the people who believed in the Omnipotent Presence of the God of Israel. Viewed from the perspective of history, the prophecy of Ezekiel is a masterpiece of religio-political philosophy which enabled the Jew to weather the crisis of the fall of Jerusalem, the destruction of Judah as a a political entity, and the Babylonian Exile. This was in defiance of the usual process of history which would normally indicate the com plete disappearance of any nation so ravaged. Jeremiah could be characterized as the greatest of the literary prophets because of his personal experiences and his visions of impending doom and subsequent deliverance,14 but to Ezekiel belongs the credit for delivering the Jewish people from total oblivion and for insuring that they would not vanish from the face of the earth. He accomplished this by the religio-psycho logical expedient of the vision of the Merkabah, stressing that though the earthly Temple was destroyed there was a heavenly throne of YHWH beyond the reach of Babylonian might, or for that matter, inaccessible to any mundane military power. YHWH was still supreme both as deity and as the providential protector of His people. The justification of the tragic fate of Judah (chs. 4-24), the oracles against the nations (chs. 25-32), the vision of a restored nation and its final vindication (chs. 33-39) and a reconstructed Temple and cult (chs. 40-48) all emanate logically from the central focus of a supermundane Power, enthroned on high, resplendent in glory, awesome to contemplate, im perceptible to the mere mortal. Only the prophet who is endowed with penetrating perception is qualified to get a glimpse of the divine throne and its mysteries and to convey his experiences to the initiated who might understand. The Targum senses the supreme drama enacted in the Book of Ezekiel 14 M. Buttenwieser, The Prophets of Israel, N.Y. 1914, and by implication, S. H. Blank, Jeremiah, Man and Prophet, Cincinnati, 1961. But even Ezekiel, torn to shreds and denigrated by some authorities, is recognized for his genius and greatness by others. Thus, C. G. Howie, The Date and Composition of Ezekiel,Ezekiel, concludes: "Contrary to a growing belief, Ezekiel was not a schizo phrenic... On the other hand, he would not fit the mould of normality even in his day. Therein lies his greatness; he was a sensitive spirit who was caught up in the crosscurrents of history. Torn from his native land and transplanted to a strange place, he turned inward and became perhaps the outstanding visionary of the Old Testament. Our prophet may correctly be classed with the world's best known mystics... In all, Ezekiel was one of the greatest spiritual figures of an cient Israel," pp. 101-102.</page><page sequence="5">[5] THE TARGUM TO EZEK1EL 143 as none of the other versions do because its authors lived in the main stream of the historical processes which were operative among the Jews in the land of Israel. Targum Jonathan especially reflects actual historical events incorporated and preserved in the body of its exegetical inter pretations, probably as eyewitness accounts of the great men and move ments in Jewish life.15 In the case of the Targum to Ezekiel, I venture to suggest that its historico-theological thrust reflects the situation in Palestine immediately following the catastrophe of 70 C.E. The destruc tion of Jerusalem and the Temple by the Romans was a re-enactment of Jewish history six centuries earlier, which Ezekiel had witnessed. Ezekiel's response, the psychological impact of the Merkabah concept, proved to be effective, as was borne out by the return from exile, the rebuilding of the Temple and the re-establishment of the nation in the Judean state. Perhaps it was no mere coincidence that the same formula for survival was imposed by Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai in his effort to salvage the Jewish people from total collapse when he established Javneh and its Sages as the rallying point of a resurgent Jewish com munity. Herscher16 has demonstrated that the predominance of Merkabah Mysticism in the post destruction era under R. Johanan b. Zakkai was a deliberate effort to preserve the disciples whom he had gathered from being decimated by the Roman authorities. Johanan's reasoning must have been rather simple. Messianic activism was regarded by Rome as treason against the emperor. It had resulted in the execution of a number of Jewish messianic figures and their followers, including the Nazarene, who was accused by the Romans of being "King of the Jews," i.e., traitor to Rome. Christianity subsequently took the approach that "My kingdom is not of this world" (John 18:36), that is, it is not political activism and hence no threat to Rome. Johanan, too, had to suppress open messianic activity in order to protect his followers from the charge of treason, but at the same time he had to keep alive their faith in God and their hope for national restitution and restoration of their sovereignty, all symbolized by the Temple. This he did by substituting Merkabah Mysticism for messianic activism. As in Ezekiel, this placed the divine throne in heaven out of reach of the adversary, in this instance Rome. This accounts for such vivid passages of Merkabah as found in Hag. 14b and Tosefta Hag. 2:1, in which 15 For illustrative examples see, P. Churgin, Targum Jonathan to the Pro phets,phets, p. 26, and S. H. Levey, The Messiah—An Aramaic Interpretation, p. 67; cf. also Pseudo-Jonathan to Gen. 49:10-12. 16 Uri Herscher, "Yochanan ben Zakkai: Acrobatics at Yavneh," a paper submitted in partial fulfillment of a minor in Rabbinics in his doctoral program, Hebrew Union College-Jewish Institute of Religion, California School, 1973.</page><page sequence="6">144 SAMSON H. LEVEY [6] Johanan and his disciples play such a dominant role.17 Rivkin sig nificantly observes that Johanan b. Zakkai ignores the doctrine of the Messiah.18 There is evidence that the Targum to Ezekiel may be a document reflecting the views of R. Johanan, emphasizing the Merkabah instead of the messianic. I have demonstrated elsewhere19 that the Targum to Ezekiel is unique in that unlike Jonathan to other prophetic books, nowhere in it is the outright designation משיחא to be found, though there is ample opportunity for messianic interpretation. Illustrative of this, Ezek. 17:22 is rendered by the Targum ואקריב אנא ממלכותא דבית דויד ..יניק, in 34:23, 24, and 37:24 עבדי דוד is translated literally. Nor is the נשיא in chs. 44, 45, 46 and 48 interpreted as the Messiah, as it is understood by some rabbinic commentaries, on the strength of 34:24.20 In these instances the Ezekiel Targum translates נשיא simply as רבא, although in 34:24 and 37:25 נשיא is translated as מלכא. Compare this with the context of Jer. 33:12-26, where David comes into the prophecy, and Targum Jonathan still finds room for the designated Messiah, vv. 13 and 15. Similarly in Jer. 23:5. Even more boldly, in Jer. 30:9, Jonathan renders the Hebrew דוד מלכם as למשיחא בר דויד מלכהון• I have pointed out further that the phrase in Ekez. 21:32: עד בא אשר לו המשפט, which lends itself naturally to a messianic interpretation is applied by the Targumist to the historical picture of the final days of the Kingdom of Judah, specifically to Ishmael the son of Netaniah, the murderer of Gedaliah. Futhermore, Ezekiel should lend itself more readily to mes sianic exegesis by virtue of its Gog passages in chapters 38 and 39, which had become intimately associated with the advent of the Messiah in rabbinic thought, and yet even these the Targum renders without messianic reference. There were historical interludes in Palestine under Roman rule when messianic activism or even articulation carried the death penalty with it.21 I have offered several possibilities for the non-messianic eschatology of the Targum to Ezekiel. I am now convinced that we can probably 17 The praise of Elazar b. Arak as נאה דורש ונאה מקיים seems to imply that he was not only adept at the exposition of Merkabah, but was observant in following Johanan's appeal, to refrain from overt messianic activity. 18 Ellis Rivkin, "The Meaning of Messiah in Jewish Thought," Union Seminary Seminary Quarterly Review, vol. 26, no. 4, 1971, p. 395. Cf. also J. Neusner, A Life Life of Rabban Yohanan ben Zakkai, Leiden, 1970, pp. 3-4, 49. However, Joha na^s deathbed admonition to his disciples, והכינו כסא להזקיה מלך יהודה שבא, Ber. 28b, cannot be construed as being anything but messianic. But note the double entendre, the hidden meaning to be understood only by the initiated. 19 S. H. Levey, The Messiah—An Aramaic Interpretation, pp. 78-79, 85-87. 20 Cf. Kimlji and Mezudat David to Ezek. 34:23. 21 S. H. Levey, The Messiah—An Aramaic Interpretation, p. 86.</page><page sequence="7">[7] THE TARGUM TO EZEKIEL 145 best explain our Targum's exegesis as adhering to the Merkabah rather than the messianic approach, and in all likelihood expressing the political posture of Rabban Johanan b. Zakkai at Javneh. Throne mysticism and its concomitants are not limited to the primary Merkabah chapters 1 and 10. There is sufficient sprinkling of the theme throughout the entire Targum. Ezek. 3:12 ff.; 8:3; 11:1, 24; 43:5, instances where the prophet is lifted by the spirit, have overtones of the mystic ascent of the Merkabah devotee. The introduction to the Temple vision 40:1-^1 likewise is interpreted by the Targum in such a manner as to equate prophecy with strange mystic powers of locomo tion; and the mysterious figure whom the prophet sees standing at the gate is a divine being who addresses him even as he is customarily addressed by the deity. In 43:1 ff. the prophet himself draws a com parison between the vision of the glory of YHWH in the Temple and the vision that he saw on the River Chebar. Thus the Temple-to-be is a replica of the heavenly Merkabah.22 In language that echoes the parlance of the Merkabah mystic, the Targum translates Ezek. 43:723 in such a manner as to make the Sanctuary an eternal abode of God, possibly an indestructible edifice. Note that in the new Sanctuary there will be a palace housing God's throne of glory and His Shekinah in the midst of Israel eternally. Further attestation to the eschatological, divine nature of the re constructed city of Jerusalem, which will contain the Sanctuary of the future is found in the very last verse of the prophecy, 48:35, ושם העיר מיום ה' שמה, which the Targum paraphrases, ושמה דקרתא 24,יתפרש מיומא די ישרי שכינתיה יי תמן "And the name of the city shall be designated from the day that He makes His Shekinah rest (upon it), 'The Lord is there.' " A possible implication of this could be that the new worldly Jerusalem will be a replica of the heavenly city superimposed on the ruins of the old.25 In this, too, Merkabah Mysticism is the dominant motif, and the absence of the messianic in the targumic exegesis of Ezekiel is clear and unmistakable. The key to the proper understanding of the exegesis of the Ezekiel Targum is its interpretation of the designation 2:1) בן־אדם a.e.) by which God addresses the prophet, and which occurs over ninety times in the biblical book. The LXX renders the phrase viè avOgamov ; 22 Cf. W. Eichrodt, Ezekiel, Phila., 1970, p. 542: "The Temple makes its appearance as a heavenly reality created by Yahweh himself and transplanted to stand on earth." 23 Cf. the poetic figure of the throne and the footstool with Isa. 66:1. 24 The version is that of A. Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic, Leiden, 1962, vol. Ill, p. 384, which seems to be superior to the versions of Rashi, Kimhi, and the Rabbinic Bibles. 25 Cf. Rev. 3:12.</page><page sequence="8">146 SAMSON H. LEVEY [8] the Vulgate fili hominis; the Syriac )-*-&gt; . Some rabbinic interpréta tion attributes the appellation to the fear that Ezekiel might think of himself as a superior being of angelic status by virtue of the heavenly vision which he had seen; hence he is reminded that he is only human, a "son of man," Rashi and Kimhi, ad loc. The English versions includ ing the Revised Standard Version, following the King James, are content with "son of man," while the New English Bible renders it simply as "man." Of the modern commentators, the prevalent opinion is that the appellation suggests the mortal unworthiness of the prophet Ezekiel, with an implied transcendence of YHWH. Eichrodt, Stalker, Taylor, and Cassuto all express this thought in one way or another.26 Eichrodt's comment is typical: "The choice of this particular man as prophet in itself runs counter to practically every human presup position. The title 'son of man' by which he is addressed is frequently employed in this book. But it is found nowhere else in the Old Testa ment except Dan. 8:17, which is derived from the present passage. Now that title already expresses, in the same words and manner as Ps. 8:5 the weakness of the creature to whom the mighty Lord shows such condescension."27 The Targum's rendering of the phrase goes contrary to all the ac cepted notions from the LXX to the present day. For instead of translating בן־אדם by the Aramaic בר אנשא or its variants, which would imply the idea of a mere mortal, and occurs in Targum to Ps. 8:5, 146:3; Num. 23:19; Isa. 51:12, 56:2; Jer. 49:18, 33; 50:40; 51:43 and Mic. 5:6, it consistently renders it בר אדם in every instance where the phrase occurs in Ezekiel, and the targumic phrase can only mean "son of Adam" or "Adamite."28 Demonstrative of this is the trans lation of Onkelos to Gen. 1:26, 27, where נעשה אדם בצלמנו is rendered by נעביד אינשא בצלמנא but ויברא אלהים את האדם by וברא יוי ית אדם. Here and consistently thereafter, אדם is a proper noun in the Aramaic (Gen. 2:7,8, 15, 16, 18, etc.). Kimhi seems to sense a deliberately construed exegetical design in the Targum's rendering. His initial comment is the prevalent traditional explanation, as found in Rashi, but his own view is worthy of note, since he recognizes the unique phraseology of the Targum's translation. Kimhi: "The commentators have explained that He (God) called him (Ezekiel) ben adam so that he should not magnify himself and consider himself as one of the angels by virtue of his having seen this great 26 W.

But it properly seems to me, that because he saw the face of a man in the chariot, He made known to him that he is upright and good in His eyes, and that he is a son of man, not the son of a lion, nor the son of an ox, nor the son of an eagle in the manner in which we have explained it. Therefore, Jonathan translates the phrase בר אדם not בר אנשא even though he translates פני אדם as אפי אנשא with reference to the likeness (Ezek. 1:10)." Kimhi's citing of the Targum to support his explanation that the prophet is man and not one of the other figures in the chariot may be admissible, but I do not believe that Kimhi was aware of the full force of the phrase בר אדם. It is my contention that there may be something more esoteric in the Targum's בר אדם, perhaps in opposition to the LXX and to those who see in בן־אדם a denigration of Ezekiel. While it seems evident that the intent is deliberate we can only conjecture as to the purpose of the phrase. The Targumist may have detected a problem if he translated it as בר אנשא in view of Daniel's designation of the messianic cloud man or angelic figure by 7:13) בר אנש), a concept which figures pro minently in the Book of Enoch (45:3, 46:2, 48:2, a.e.) and IV Ezra, and in the New Testament. His בר אדם may be his way of avoiding any messianic implication with reference to Ezekiel. At the same time, it may be his way of elevating Ezekiel to the most exalted level of prophecy, since Adam was regarded in some rabbinic opinion as a prophet who foresaw all that was to happen in the entire course of human history, generation by generation, until the resurrection of the dead.29 It also may be a subtle ploy relating to the mystery of the Merkabah which is integral to Ezekiei's role in rabbinic mysticism. The association of Adam with the celestial Temple, the divine abode, and the throne of the deity is established in recognized strata front which the Targum could draw. The Merkabah tradition itself is pre served in the Intertestamental Literature, specifically in the Enoch books, 1 Enoch xiv, 2 Enoch xx and xxi, and in the Testament of Levi v. There is a striking passage in which Adam relates to Seth his vision of the Merkabah, after his expulsion from the Garden of Eden. "When we were at prayer there came to me Michael the archangel, a messenger of God. And I saw a chariot like the wind and its wheels were fiery and I was caught up in the Paradise of Righteousness, and I saw the Lord sitting and His face was flaming fire that could not be endured. And many thousands of angels were on the right and the left of the 29 'A. Z. 5a; Sanh. 38b; Midr. Teh. 139:6. Cf. also R. Judah b. R. Simon's statement in Gen. R. 24:5, "Adam was worthy to have the Torah revealed by him..."</page><page sequence="10">148 SAMSON H. LEVEY [10] chariot."30 This is from the Vita Adae et Evae, the Jewish origin and characteristics of which Ginzberg had demonstrated, and assigned to an early period possibly antedating the destruction of 70 C.E.31 The Vita continues the theme, Adam predicting the theophany at Sinai, the building and subsequent destruction of the Temple, and its reconstruction in an aura of the divine. "The Lord will appear in a flame of fire and from the mouth of His majesty He will give com mandments and statutes, and they will sanctify Him in the house of the habitation of His majesty. And He will show them the marvellous place of His majesty. And they will build a house to the Lord their God in the land which He shall prepare for them and there they will transgress His statutes and their sanctuary will be burnt up and their land will be deserted and they themselves will be dispersed; because they have kindled the wrath of God. And once more He will cause them to come back from their dispersion; and again they will build the house of God; and in the last time the house of God will be exalted greater than of old And the house of God will be honored in the age and their enemies will no more be able to hurt the men who are believing in God; and God will stir up for Himself a faithful people whom He shall save for eternity, and the impious shall be punished by God their King.. ."32 Two points are noteworthy. First, that the Second Temple is still in its prime, bearing out the pre-destruction antiquity of the document. And, perhaps, of even greater relevance to this study, the eschatological structure is one in which the doctrine of the Messiah is totally absent. The inclusion of the vision of the divine chariot, and the non-messianic picture of the future marks the Vita as an ideal source for or parallel to the exegetical thrust of the Targum to Ezekiel. While it might con ceivably support the idea of the Merkabah as a surrogate for the mes sianic, at the very least it provides an existential rationale for the eschatology of our Ezekiel Targum as an exception to the rest of Targum Jonathan to the Prophets in this respect. The Adamite-Temple-Merkabah motif is found in rabbinic sources as well. A Baraita lists those things that are premundane: "It was taught, seven things were created before the world was created, and these are Torah and repentance; the Garden of Eden (paradise) and Gehinnom (hell); the Throne of Glory and the Temple; and the name 30 R.

Apocalypse of Moses XXXin, XXXIV, Charles II, p. 149.</page><page sequence="11">[11] THE TARGUM TO EZEK1EL 149 of the Messiah."33 Note the wording, "the Throne of Glory and the Temple," the two are coupled, linked together. This could point to the mystery of the divine nature of the Sanctuary as the abode of God. A homily in the Midrash also attributes pre-existence to Adam: "Thou didst form me after and before... R. Simeon b. Lakish says, after the work of the last day and before the work of the first day of Créa tion."34 The implication is that there is a pre-existent celestial as well as a mundane aspect of Adam,35 the former intimately associated with the premundane creations, including God's throne and the Temple. But even the earthly Adam is a reflection of the Sanctuary, since he was created of dust taken from the site of the Temple. "R. Berekiah and R. Helbo in the name of R. Samuel b. Nahman said, He (Adam) was created from the place of his atonement."36 The link between Adam and the Merkabah in Judaic esoteric specula tion is clearly discernible. The Targum to Ezekiel sees in the Prophet Ezekiel a counterpart of Adam, unmistakable in its designation of him as בר אדם. Rabbinic lore further reinforces this portrait of Ezekiel by in sisting that God need not have revealed to Ezekiel the secrets of the Merkabah at all, except that when the children of Israel said na'aseh venishma',venishma', God felt impelled to make known to them those matters hid den in His chambers.37 There is also an eschatological interpretation to the effect that in the future Ezekiel will come again to unlock for Israel the hidden chambers of the Merkabah.38 There is yet another possibility. If Ezekiel is regarded as a בר אדם, "Adamite," the Targu mist may be implying an indirect polemical thrust against the Pauline view that Jesus was the eschatological Adam (I Cor. 15:45).39 If this 33 Nedarim 39b; Pesahim 54a.

LEVEY [12] is the case, the implicit targumic argument would be that the Christian contention that Jesus is the unique Adamite who alone could raise the dead (John 11:1 ff.) is fallacious, since Ezekiel was an Adamite long before Jesus, and he did more than revive one man; he resurrected an entire multitude of the dead as depicted in chapter 37.40 Then, too, Adam is seen as the ultimate personification of goodness. "Me'od and Adam Adam are equivalents. As it is written, and God saw all that He had made, and behold it was very good (Gen. 1:31); i.e., And behold, Adam was good."41 There is a further explanation: "The letters of this (מ—א—ד) are the same letters as that (42".(א—ד'—ם This, too, might be construed as a polemic against the Pauline position that Adam was evil, the culprit whose sin brought death into the world. Ezekiel's legacy from Adam, and the Merkabah tradition associated with it, help explain some of the difficulties in the totality of the targ umic exegesis. In view of all this, we consider the manner in which the Targum to Ezekiel presents its interpretation of the Merkabah, how it supplies some details which elaborate on the basic Hebrew text where it appears to be laconic, and points towards, though not completely divulging, the esoteric aspects of Merkabah speculation. Here is the targumic rendering of chapter 1, with our commentary: 1:1 It was in the thirtieth year, from the time that Hilkiah the High Priest found the Book of the Torah in the Temple, in the court under the entrance (during the night, after the beginning of moonlight43); in the days of Josiah son of Amon king of the tribe of the house of Judah; on the fifth day of the month of Tammuz.44 The prophet said: I was among the exiles on the River Chebar,45 the heavens opened and I beheld, in the prophetic vision that rested upon me, a vision of the glory of the Presence46 of the Lord. 40 Rabbinic opinion differs as to whether Ezekiel's prophecy in chapter 37 is mere poetic symbolism for a restored Jewish nation or a literal revival of the dead. Many prominent Sages believed that Ezekiel actually brought the dead back to life, Sanh. 92b. Both the Hebrew text and, more so, the Targum to Ezek. 37:7-10 indicate that the prophet, as an agent of God, had a hand in the revival of the dry bones. Cf. Lev. R. 27:4. The incident of Elijah reviving the son of the woman of Sarfat (I Kings 17:17 ff.) is probably no point of argument, since Elijah is absorbed into the messianic picture by both Judaism and Chris tianity.

For a slightly different calculation from the time of the Jubilee, see Kimhi ad loc., quoting his father's interpretation. 1:2 1:2 On the fifth of the month, it being the fifth year of the exile of King Joiakin. 1:3 1:3 The word of prophecy from before the Lord was with Ezekiel son of Buzi47 the priest, in the land of Israel, and again once more He spoke with him in the land of the Chaldeans on the River Chebar; and there the spirit of prophecy from before the Lord rested upon him. The prophecy of Ezekiel commenced while he was still in the land of Israel, but continued after he was carried off to Babylon and on the River Chebar. When revelation occurs outside the land of Israel, it occurs only by water, the purifying element.48 1:4 And I saw, and behold, a whirlwind came from the north, a large cloud, and a flaming fire, its radiance being all around it; and from the midst of the cloud, and from the midst of the whirlwind, something similar to hashmal from the midst of fire. The Targum does not bother to explain the word hashmal, but renders it in an Aramaized form of the Hebrew. Rabbinic views on the subject are discussed in Hag. 13a-b. 1:5 And from the midst of it, the likeness of four creatures; their appearance—they had the likeness of a man.49 1:6 Each had four faces and each and every one of the (faces) had four faces, sixteen faces to each creature, the number of faces of the four creatures being sixty four. Each had four wings and each and every one (of the faces) had four wings, sixteen wings to every single face, sixty four wings to every single creature; the number of wings of the four creatures being two hundred and fifty six. By a strange mathematical formula the Targum arrives at a figure of sixty four wings to each of the four creatures, a total of 256 for the 47 Kimhi cites Targum Yerushalmi: "Ezekiel the prophet son of Jeremiah the prophet." 48 Mek.

The significance of this calculation is not immediately apparent, nor definitively certain. We could speculate that perhaps it relates to the singing of the heavenly hosts in praise of their Creator.50 Significantly, no other early rabbinic source mentions 256 wings of each cherub, but Rashi picks up the theme from the Targum. On this issue, Kimhi, who generally refers to the Targum freely, maintains complete silence. 1:7 Their feet were straight feet, and the soles of their feet were like round soles,51 and when they moved they would shake the earth, and they shone like burnished bronze. Significantly, Targum's reading differs from the Masoretic text, which has the soles of the living creatures looking like those of a calf. This differs from the rabbinic reading, Yoma 19b, where this verse is applied to the Sadducean High Priest who was dispatched on the Day of Atone ment by an angel who struck him down, bearing the imprint of the hoof of a calf. 1:8 Hands like the hands of a man extended for them from beneath their wings on their four sides, wherewith to take out burning coals of fire from among the cherubim under neath the expanse which was over their heads, placing them into the hands of the seraphim to sprinkle on the place of the wicked, to destroy the sinners who transgress His word.52 And their faces and their wings were the same on the four of them. Targum follows the Qere, reading the plural, "hands," and inter preting the verse as applying to the punishment of the wicked. The Sages preferred the Ketib, "His hand," with reference to God, who, in His capacity as the Merciful extends His hand to accept the Ba'ale Teshuvah,Teshuvah, to protect them from punishment, Pesahim 119a. The margin al note in Codex Reuchlinianus incorporates this talmudic reference. 1:9 Their wings were directed towards one another. They did not turn as they went—each creature went straight ahead. 50 The song of the cherubim is produced by their wings. Ezek. 1:24, 3:13, 10:5; Hag. 13b. Hence, by gematria, רני? 51 Reading עגול instead of Masoretic עגל. 52 The marginal note in the Codex Reuchlinianus provides a variant reading at this point: "The right hand extended to receive the sinners who have turned in repentance, to enable them to possess eternal life; and the left hand extended to take out burning coals of fire..."</page><page sequence="15">[15] THE TARGUM TO EZEKIEL 153 1:10 And the likeness of their faces—the face of a man and the face of a lion were fashioned on the right side of the four of them; the face of an ox was fashioned on the left side of the four of them; and the face of an eagle on the four of them. The partial correspondence of the celestial Merkabah and the re constructed Temple in Jerusalem is discernible in the reference to the faces, cf. 4118,19 :־ and 10:14. 1:11 1:11 Their faces and their wings were spread out above; each had two directed towards the other; and two covering their bodies. 1:12 Each creature went straight ahead; they went to whatever place they wished to go to;53 they did not turn as they went. Targum interprets "spirit" as "will." 1:13 As to the likeness of the creatures, their appearance was like burning coals of fire; like the appearance of flaming fiery torches between the creatures; and there was bright ness to the fire, and from the fire there went forth lightning. 1:14 And the creatures, when they are sent to do the will of their Master who makes His Presence dwell on high above them, in front of the eye to behold,54 then turn and circle the world, and the creatures return together, and quickly, like the appearance of lightning. The targumic elaboration on this short, simple verse, structures it as a description of the angelic beings on their mission to serve God. They perform their duties instantly, undeterred by distance, like a flash of lightning. 1:15 And I beheld the creatures, and 10, one wheel was placed55 just below the heavenly heights, beside the creatures, on the four sides. .לאתר דהוי תמן רעוא למיזל אזלו 53 54 This phrase is difficult. Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic, vol. Ill, p. 266, reads כאנפא עינא למחזי, which would suggest that it is almost impossible for the human eye to follow them. This is in line with Gen. R. 50:1 — ורבנן אמרי כזיקא לעינא according to corrected ms. See Soncino I, p. 434. Kimhi cites some versions באגפאבאגפא "on the wing." Also למהוי "to be," rather than למחזי "to see," possibly suggesting tremendous speed. Cf. O. H. Schorr, Hehalui 13 (1888), p. 94, sug gesting the Greek avyij tpaveix, "a shining appearance." 55 Kimhi reads משתני, "different," "awesome."</page><page sequence="16">154 SAMSON H. LEVEY [16] In keeping with the Merkabah tradition, the Targum interprets בארץ as meaning "beneath" or "below" the heavenly heights, retaining the celestial imagery. Rabbinic interpretation of this verse equates it with the angel Sandalfon, the brother of Metatron, who extends from earth to the heavenly creatures, Hag. 13b. 1:16 The appearance of the wheels and the way they were made were like a precious stone,56 the four of them having one likeness; and their appearance and their operation was as though it were a wheel within a wheel. 1:17 1:17 When they went, they would go on their four sides, they did not turn as they went. 1:18 Their bodies were set opposite the expanse of the sky, and they were tall and awesome, their bodies being full of eyes round about all four of them. 1:19 When the creatures went, the wheels went correspondingly, and when the creatures rose to just below the heavenly heights the wheels also rose. Here again, the Targum continues to play down the reference to the earth and insists on a celestial interpretation. 1:20 Wherever there was the will to go, there they would go (by) the will to go; and the wheels rose correspondingly, for in the wheels there was like the spirit of the creatures. Targum renders the first רוח by רעוא, but in the second case it retains the biblical word as well as its meaning, "spirit." 1:21 They (the wheels) would go when they (the creatures) went, and when they stood still, they would stand; and when they rose to just below the heavenly heights, the wheels would rise correspondingly; for in the wheels there was like the spirit of the creatures. As in the Hebrew, the Targum depicts the movement of the wheels as corresponding to that of the creatures. Also, Targum continues to ignore the earth and stress the heavenly realm of the Merkabah. 1:22 The likeness above the heads of the creatures was a firma ment, like a mighty ice field inclined towards their heads from above. 56 For the Hebrew תרשיש. Elsewhere, according to context, the Targum renders the same word by ימא, "the sea" (27:12, 25; 38:13).</page><page sequence="17">[17] the targum to ezekiel 155 Targum translates this verse literally, without elaboration or inter pretation. 1:23 And underneath the firmament their wings were extended one towards the other; each had two (wings) covering them and each had two (wings) covering them, (that is) their bodies. Literal rendition. 1:24 When they went, I heard the sound of their wings, like the sound of many waters, like a sound from before the Al mighty Shaddai; the sound of their words when they would thank and bless their Master, the everliving King of the worlds; like the sound of the hosts of the angels on high; when they stood still, their wings became silent.57 Targum expands the text in terms of Merkabah, as referring to the chant of the angelic hosts in praise of God. 1:25 And at such time when it was His will to make the words audible to His servants the prophets of Israel, there was a voice which was heard from above the firmament58 which was above their heads. When they stood still, their wings became silent before the word. This is a continuation of the Merkabah motif of the Targum from v. 1:24. Significantly, it relates the Merkabah to prophecy. 1:26 And above the firmament which was over their heads there was like the appearance of a precious stone, the likeness of a throne, and above the likeness of the throne there was like the appearance of Adam59 above it from on high. I have used the version of Sperber, which confirms the reading of Kimhi,Kimhi, who astutely observes: דמות כמראה אדם לא תרגמו יונתן, "Targum Jonathan did not translate the phrase, דמות כמראה אדם, i.e. the Tar gumist simply carried the Hebrew phrase over into his rendition verbatim, without translating it. The implications are clear, supporting our con 57 Rabbinic Bibles add מן קדם דיבורא, which Rashi explains as either the speech of God to the prophets, or as praise of the righteous. 58 The Rabbinic Bibles add: "between the cherubim." 59 There are variant versions, including a manuscript reading "like the face of Jacob our father, above it." Cf. Sperber, The Bible in Aramaic, vol. Ill, p. 267.</page><page sequence="18">156 SAMSON H. LEVEY [18] tendon that the Adam tradition is central and vital to an understanding of our Targum's Merkabah concept, and to Ezekiel's designation by the Targum as בר אדם — the Adamite. 1:27 I saw something like the hashmal, like the appearance of fire from the midst of it round about, an appearance of glory which the eye is unable to see, and such that it is impossible to look at it and upward; an appearance of glory which the eye is unable to see, and such that it is impossible to look at it and downward; I saw like the ap pearance of fire and it had brightness round about it. The anthropomorphic מראה מתנין is interpreted euphemistically as "an appearance of glory.1' This verse came in for a special prohibition by the Rabbis, Hag. 13a. 1:28 Like the appearance of the rainbow that is in the cloud on a a rainy day, so was the splendor round about. It is the likeness of the glory of the Lord. And I beheld and fell upon my face, and I heard a voice which was speaking. The incidence of the rainbow and Merkabah speculation is dem onstrated in the anecdote of R. Johanan b. Zakkai and his disciples, Hag. 14b. Since the rainbow is equated with the glory of God, the view is expressed that it is irreverent to gaze at it, Hag. 16a. Cf. Num. R. 14:3. The foregoing gives us an insight into the targumic conception of the Merkabah. Neither of the related passages in Ezek. 8:1^1, and chapter 10 adds much substantively to the targumic Merkabah exegesis of chapter 1. In 10:14, where the Hebrew text substitutes the face of a cherub for the face of an ox (1:10) the Targum simply translates literally, without interpretative comment. Rabbinic opinion is that God converted the face of the ox into that of a cherub at Ezekiel's request, since the ox was reminiscent of the sin of the golden calf, Hag. 13b. While the non-messianic Merkabah theme is of major significance, there is another current of exegetical interest in the Targum to Ezekiel. That is its emphatic historical interpretations, interpolating the names of historical personages and events of historical importance. This is probably stimulated by the nature of Ezekiel's prophecy, the historical scene out of which it emerges, and the destruction and the exile which enlarged Israel's role on the international scene. In the case of the Targum, the historical factors involved in the destiny of Israel were multiplied many times over after the era in which Ezekiel lived. Some historical allusions will demonstrate the point. We have already indicated how the Targum injects the picture of the</page><page sequence="19">[19] THE TARGUM TO EZEKIEL 157 exile of Seraiah, the High Priest, and King Zedekiah, the appointment of Gedaliah, and his assassination by Ishmael the son of Netaniah, all of which are historical facts. This is done exegetically, where the Hebrew text is merely unspecified poetic expression. There are other applications of this principle in the same chapter 21:13-22, where the Targum interprets the poetic imagery in the light of vv. 23 ff. It explains 21:15—או נשיש as referring to the rejoicing of the tribes of Judah and Benjamin when the tribes of the Northern Kingdom were exiled by the Assyrians. Chapter 17 in the Hebrew is an outright description of the historical situation which the Targum follows closely. Chapter 19 is a poetic lament over the royal house of Judah. The imagery requires elaboration, which the Targum supplies. The lion whelps symbolize two kings of Judah. While the Targum mentions no names of the kings, even as the Hebrew does not, there is no doubt that the king taken into captivity to Egypt is Jehoahaz. The king taken captive to Babylon, however, could be either Jehoiachin or Zedekiah. If the latter, the poetic imagery is historically correct, since Hamutal was the mother of both Jehoahaz and Zedekiah. But if the captive to Babylon is Jehoiachin, who was not a a brother of Jehoahaz, the Targum is historically more accurate in its interpretation of the lioness as the congregation of Israel (19:2, 10), and it must be assumed that it is in this light that the Targum under stands the text, i.e. Jehoiachin is the king taken to Babylon referred to in the Hebrew text, 19:9. Chapter 16 contains some historical discourse on the heathen past of the city of Jerusalem, and how Israel continued heathen practice.60 A striking twist of targumic exegesis is its rendering of 16:45. The He brew text speaks in poetic allegory: "You are the daughter of your mother, who despised her husband and her children. You are the sister of your sister(s), who despised their husbands and children. Your mother was a Hittite and your father was an Amorite." The Targum: "Why have you been the daughter of the land of Canaan, acting accord ing to the practices of the people whose father was cursed together with his children?61 And a sister of Sodom and Gomorrah, whose peo pie were consumed, parents and children? Your mother Sarah lived among the Hittites but did not act according to their practices; and your father Abraham lived among the Amorites, but did not walk in their counsel." Ezekiel enumerates the countries that assailed Israel and have des cended into historical oblivion, 32:17 ff. The "land of the living" is 60 Cf. Eichrodt, Ezekiel, p. 204. 61 A reference to Gen. 9:25.</page><page sequence="20">158 SAMSON H. LEVEY [20] taken by the Targum as the land of Israel, 32:23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 32. The same equation is also found in 26:20. There is one historical allusion in the Targum to the Gog passages that seems to identify Rome with Gog and the eschatological battle which will mark the final denouement of history. In 39:16 the Targum reads as follows: "There, too, shall be thrown the slain of Rome, the city of boisterous crowds." Beth-Togarmah, the exact meaning of which is obscure, but which has been explained as Armenia,62 the Targum renders as Germania, (27:14; 38:6). In 7:7 there is an obscure expression,באה הצפירה, (in v. 10 it is יצאה הצפרההצפרההצפרה) which seems to defy the commentaries. Kimhi relates the word צפירה to the Aramaic צפרא, hence "the morning has come," i.e. the morning of the day of evil tidings, in keeping with the context of doom in chapter 7. Modern interpreters also regard it as some pro nouncement of disaster, although admitting the uncertainty of its mean ing.63 The Targum translates it אתגליאת מלכוהא עלך, "revealed is the Kingdom upon (or to) you."84 The rationale for this rendering is Isa. 28:5, ולצפירת תפארה, "and for a diadem of beauty." We cannot rule out the possibility that the Targum had in mind an eschatological approach, sounding a note of comfort even in the midst of the dark ness of doom. There is comfort, too, for those Jews living in the Diaspora. The Targum asserts that for them the Synagogue is divinely ordained, al though it remains secondary to the Temple, 11:16.65 Our critical analysis would lead us to the conclusion that this Targum, like the Book of Ezekiel itself, presents a provocative challenge in the finest tradition of biblical exegesis. 62 Eichrodt, Ezekiel, pp. 379, 381. Could the Targum have been propheti cally perceptive of the twentieth century? 63 Cf. Revised Standard Version to 7:7. 64 We might be tempted to translate the phrase "the Kingdom is exiled," in line with the context of doom, but then the word עלך becomes syntactically impossible. The version of Codex Reuchlinianus, למיתי, is better. 65 a. Meg. 29a.</page></plain_text>
