<plain_text><page sequence="1">Institutions, Culture, and America's 'Cold War Years': the Making of Greenberg's 'Modernist Painting' Francis Frascina 1. Apart from the influences readable in Fried's writings, particularly in the 1960s, see his 'An Introduction to My Art Criticism', in Art and Objecthood: Essays and Reviews (The University of Chicago Press: Chicago and London, 1998), pp. 1-74. See also his acknowledgements pp. xvii-xviii. 2. On this, see the end of the highly charged exchange between T. J. Clark and Greenberg recorded at a conference in Vancouver in 1981 after Clark's paper 'More on the Differences Between Comrade Greenberg and Ourselves' in Benjamin H. D Buchloh, Serge Guilbaut, and David Solkin (eds), Modernism and Modernity: The Vancouver Conference Papers (The Press of the Nova Scotia College of Art and Design: Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1983), pp. 169-87. There have been a number of critiques of Greenberg's role in the art market and in the careers of artists; some of these are considered in Florence Rubenfeld, Clement Greenberg: A Life (Scribner: New York, 1997), especially Chapter 16, 'Imperial Clem'. 3. I use a capital 'M' to denote the ideology of Modernism, exemplified by Greenberg's writings and those of his followers, that became institutionally prevalent from the late 1950s onwards. References for critiques of Greenberg's writings can be found in the notes to my 'Looking Forward, Looking Back: 1985- 1999', Pollock and After: The Critical Debate, Second Edition (Routledge: London and New York, 2000). 4. Some of these were addressed in February 1991 when I delivered a paper 'Modernism, Criticism, Politics' at a session, organised by Johanna Drucker, entitled Rethinking Modernist Criticism: the Legacy of Clement Greenberg at the CAA conference in Washington DC. That paper and research conducted on the trip to Washington have been on 'on hold' ever since. My concerns are also prompted by two articles by Nancy Jachec: 'Adorno, Greenberg and Modernist Politics', Telos, no. 110, Winter 1998, pp. 105-18 and 'Modernism, Enlightenment Values, and Clement Greenberg', Oxford Art Journal, vol. 21, no. 2, 1998, pp. 123-32. For an analysis of Greenberg's criticism in the late 1950s and early 1960s, though not of 'Modernist Painting' see Bradford R. Collins, 'Clement Greenberg and the Search for Abstract Expressionism's Successor: A Study Clement Greenberg's 'Modernist Painting', written in Spring 1960 and broadcast as a radio programme by the Voice of America (VOA) in February 1961, has enjoyed a canonical status in many accounts of art and art criticism since World War Two. It was, and still is, revered by a generation of critics and historians, exemplified by Michael Fried,1 and is a core text in the essays and articles by Greenberg that influenced particular painters, dealers, and critics during the 1960s and early 1970s.2 His version of Modernism, which has identifiable euro-centric, gendered, and classed characteristics, has been subject to a variety of critiques.3 It is neither my aim to review these critiques nor to revisit the arguments of Modernist aesthetics and Modernist apologists. Rather, my interests relate to historical and ideological queries:4 to the circumstances in which 'Modernist Painting' was written; its ideological place within values and institutions in the United States during the Cold War; and its contribution to the contested definitions of 'American culture' constituted by American cultural relations abroad.5 Versions and Dates First, it is important to clear up two issues: one relates to which version of 'Modernist Painting' is discussed, another to the date of its first appearance. Generally, authors make revisions to texts for a number of reasons, ranging from correcting date errors to wholesale ideological restructuring. The latter is significant for understanding both the work of an author and the social transformations within which that work was produced. Greenberg is well known for altering his essays on reprint. For example, 'The Pasted-Paper Revolution', first published in Art News in 1958,6 was not only substantially rewritten but also retitled as 'Collage' when it appeared in Greenberg's Art and Culture: Critical Essays in 1961.7 'Modernist Painting' was also altered after its first outing as a VOA pamphlet printed in December 1960, a VOA radio lecture broadcast in February 1961 and an article in Arts Yearbook 4, 1961. I will return to this sequence shortly. The revised essay, often the one referenced, was published in Art and Literature no. 4, Spring 1965.8 Greenberg later described the differences between the first and the revised versions as 'minor verbal changes'9 though comparison reveals more than the 'minor'. For example, the much-quoted seventh paragraph starts, in 1960-1, 'Realistic, naturalistic art had dissembled the medium . . . '. In Spring 1965, 'naturalistic' becomes 'illusionist', which is a radical change. Greenberg continues in both versions to identify what he calls 'The limitations that constitute the medium of painting'. In 1961, he states: Under Modernism these same limitations came to be regarded as positive factors, and were acknowledged openly. Manet's became the first Modernist pictures by virtue of the frankness with which they declared the flat surfaces on which they were painted. OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 69-97 (0 OXFORD UNIVERSITY PRESS</page><page sequence="2">Francis Frascina In 1965 these two sentences become: Modernist painting has come to regard these same limitations as positive factors that are to be acknowledged openly. Manet's paintings became the first Modernist ones by virtue of the frankness with which they declared the flat surfaces on which they were painted. These are more than 'minor verbal changes'. What are we to make, for instance, of the shift from 'Under Modernism' to the specialised 'Modernist painting', from 'were acknowledged openly' to the active present of 'are to be acknowledged openly', and from 'pictures' to the medium specific 'painting'?1? Are Greenberg's changes, including removals, evidence of his attempt to establish an ideological entrenchment of particular critical values and distinctions? Were these values and distinctions, especially modern specialisation and autonomy, directly related to his views about the development of Modernism in contemporary American culture? Were his revisions made in the light of the positive reception of Art and Culture and 'After Abstract Expressionism', published in Art International in October 1962, amongst a younger generation of budding critics, historians, journal editors, dealers, and artists?11 Whatever the responses to such questions, historical awareness and subtlety require self-conscious acknowledgement of the differences between versions of 'Modernist Painting' whenever the essay is discussed. To cite the 1965 version is to risk not only an uncritical adherence to Greenberg's changes but also a loss of chronological and historical perspectives. This brings me to the second issue to be clarified: the date of production and first publication. In his otherwise incisive discussion, John O'Brian, editor of the four volumes of Greenberg's collected essays and criticism, mistakenly states that the broadcast of 'Modernist Painting' was in Spring 1960.12 O'Brian replicates a mis-dating by Greenberg who may have confused the actual date of the broadcast with that of the recording.13 Although the original lecture was written in Spring 1960 it was not broadcast until February 1961. Let us explore some basic evidence. First, it is clear that 'Modernist Painting' was published in Arts Yearbook 4 in 1961. Greenberg, who had productive contacts with Hilton Kramer, the editor of Arts, wished to satisfy two of his desires: 'I do want to get the thing printed where a reasonably informed audience will read it, and I also want the additional honorarium-for understandable reasons.'14 Greenberg was writing to Lamar Dodd on 7 May 1960 just prior to recording his lecture: 'This coming Wednesday, the 11th, I'm going to record the piece on tape. To my own surprise, I find myself looking forward to the experience.'15 He believed that the tape would be broadcast soon after so that the written version could be published in the next issue of Arts Yearbook, due to appear on the news stands and mailed to subscribers in the second week of October 1960. The actual broadcast, which I discuss later, was 6 February 1961 and its appearance in Arts Yearbook 4, which was published several months behind schedule, followed in the same year. The latter volume was advertised in Arts in October 1960 at a pre-publication rate, to go on sale in bookshops from 1 November.16 However, though subsequent issues continued to carry the advert, in February 1961 a publisher's note apologised for the delay in production of Arts Yearbook 4 and stated that the volume 'will go into the mails during the month of February.' 17 Confirmation of publication appeared in the March-June 1961 issue.18 As for the revised version, we know that the editor of Art and Literature, John Ashbery, the Paris based American poet, playwright, and art critic, wrote to Greenberg on 16 January 196419 inviting publication in this small in the Manipulation of Avant-Garde Consciousness', Arts Magazine, vol. 16, no. 9, May 1987, pp. 36-43. 5.

Art and Culture: Critical Essays (Beacon Press: Boston, 1961). Few of the original pieces, in Greenberg's words, 'remained unaltered' in Art and Culture (see his 'Preface'). Many were substantially revised in substance, terminology, or title. I will discuss aspects of these changes later. 8.

After its broadcast on 6 February 1961, 'Modernist Painting' was published in Arts Yearbook 4, 1961, pp. 101-8. The few differences between the USIA pamphlet and the Arts Yearbook publication are that in the former 'Modernism' and 'Modernist' are consistently used with a capital 'M' and in the latter there are some changes in paragraph breaks in the second half of the text. 'Modernist Painting' appeared in revised form in Art and Literature: An International Review 4, Spring 1965, pp. 193-201, and then in Gregory Battcock (ed.), The New Art: A Critical Anthology (E. P.

Fried visited Kramer in Spring 1959 with a letter of introduction from Greenberg. 12.

In the revised edition of Battcock's anthology, published in 1973, Greenberg's essay was followed by 'Towards a New Humanism' (1970) by Jon Hendricks, Poppy Johnson, and circulation magazine published in Switzerland by Anne Dunn and Rodrigo Moniyhan. Ashbery had been on the editorial board of the short-lived Locus Solus, published in France in 1961-2. This magazine was noted for publishing New York School poets, such as Frank O'Hara and in issue 5, 1962, a poem by Harold Rosenberg, alongside translations of contemporary French poets. In March 1964, Ashbery edited the first issue of Art and Literature: An International Review, which lasted until issue 12 in 1967. Greenberg published his revised version of 'Modernist Painting' in this small circulation, self-consciously highbrow 'avant-garde' magazine and a year later, in 1966, in Gregory Battcock's The New Art: A Critical Anthology.20 It is the latter version of the essay that Michael Fried recalls reading.21 Revisions and Changes: Social, Political, and Textual It is commonplace not only to acknowledge the influence of 'Modernist Painting' but also to subject it to a variety of critiques, particularly as a prime example of what Fried calls a 'formalist-modernist view'.22 However, my aim is to pursue another line of inquiry embedded in Hilton Kramer's review of Greenberg's Art and Culture, published in Arts Magazine in 1962. Kramer argued that 'To understand Art and Culture is to understand a great deal about the artistic values that came out of the war and the Cold War years; to question it is to question some of the salient achievements and aesthetic beliefs of those years.'23 Kramer concluded his review with a reference to a parenthesis, which Greenberg had inserted in to his revised version of 'New York Painting Only Yesterday', first published in Art News, in Summer 1957.24 In Art and Culture this essay was retitled 'The Late Thirties in New York' and the revisions dated 1960. Kramer quotes directly from the revised essay: Mr. Greenberg writes: ' . . . some day it will have to be told how "anti-Stalinism," which started out more or less as "Trotskyism," turned into art for art's sake, and thereby cleared the way, heroically, for what was to come.' One swallows hard on this curious reference to heroism, but all the same, Art and Culture is certainly one of the principal documents of this transition from purist ideology in politics to pure aestheticism in art.25 Greenberg inserted his now famous parenthesis in the revised Art and Culture version of his essay in the same year that he was preparing 'Modernist Painting'. Since at least Spring 1958, he had been revising selected essays for the book from a variety of previous publications, such as Partisan Review, The Nation, Commentary, Arts, Art News, and The New Leader. Why revise these essays? How do the revisions and the production of 'Modernist Painting' relate to the values and beliefs 'that came out of the war and the Cold War years'? To begin to consider such questions it is important to realise that this period of revising texts was also characterised by changes in Greenberg's economic and social circumstances. I will emphasise three of these changes. First, the way he made his living. In early 1957 Greenberg was fired from his editorial job at Commentary, losing a regular salary, and severed his links with the journal's intellectual group, which had been central to him for seventeen years.2 The literary focus and financial security provided by his job at Commentary was replaced by greater attention to combine his role as an art critic and exhibition organiser with more regular freelance income. These came together between December 1958 and February 1960 when he was an adviser, on a salary of $100 per week (compared to the roughly $7000 a year he received at Commentary), to the dealers French and Co., Inc., New York.27 At the same time he was working on three book projects: Art and Culture and Hans Hofmann were both published in 1961,28 though the planned book on OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 73</page><page sequence="4">Francis Frascina Jackson Pollock was abandoned. During this time he was not only forming closer ties with artists29 and a young generation of critics, including Fried and Rosalind Krauss,30 but also having to respond to new institutional and exhibition developments. One of these developments was the effect of exhibitions organised by the Museum of Modern Art in constructing accounts of post-war American Painting and the role of Abstract Expressionism, which was crucial to Greenberg's notion of the 'avant-garde'. Another was the effect of shows at Leo Castelli's Gallery, recently opened in New York, including work by artists such as Jasper Johns and Robert Rauschenberg, which did not conform to his notion of Modernism.31 The late 1950s and early 1960s were years, too, when the prices for Abstract Expressionist works began to match the critical acclaim heaped on the works by critics including Greenberg in the previous decade. For instance, in 1950, MoMA bought Pollock's Number 1 (1948) for $2,350, and by 1961 Greenberg could write authoritatively about a Pollock recently sold in New York for $100,000.32 This brings me to the second change, which connects critical and political rivalry, debates about Cuba, and the legacies of communism. Greenberg was aware of the growing status of the art criticism of Harold Rosenberg, with whom he had had a well-known public rivalry since the early 1940s, and the position of Art News, for which Rosenberg was a regular contributor, within the east coast art world. Both Greenberg and Rosenberg were intellectuals whose values and careers were formed in the heat of Old Left Marxist debates of the 1930s and 1940s. In 1959 Rosenberg's The Tradition of the New, a collection of essays, was published to favourable reviews.33 A central text in the collection was 'The American Action Painters', first published in 1952,34 which represented a highly influential account of contemporary painting and American culture in the years since World War Two. Greenberg's "'American Type" Painting' of 1955,35 staked out an alternative to Rosenberg's arguments. Not surprisingly, Greenberg included a revised version of this essay in Art and Culture, which acted as a book length counter to Rosenberg's The Tradition of the New. Soon after the publication of Art and Culture and the broadcast of 'Modernist Painting', Greenberg wrote a review of The Tradition of the New, recently published as a paperback by Grove Press. In 'How Art Writing Earns Its Bad Name' he directly attacked Rosenberg's 'The American Action Painters', which he incorrectly titled 'Action Painting'. Greenberg's review first appeared in the new and short-lived New York publication, The Second Coming Magazine in March 1962, and a longer version followed in Encounter in December 1962.36 A battle in print between the two ensued, joined by further attacks on Rosenberg's criticism by followers of Greenberg, such as Fried.37 Greenberg's attack on Rosenberg, on critics who took up his ideas, and on Art News was partly about the role and interpretation of the art object but also about the influence of Existentialism, especially the ideas of Sartre and Heidegger.38 For Greenberg the autonomy of the art object and a specialist rigour to the discourse of interpretation were fundamental. But equally significant were his rejections of the signifiers 'Existentialism' and 'Sartre'. These rejections and his desire for a cool, ruthless hedonism of manufactured art objects, apart from the concerns of life, were political. In the late 1940s Partisan Review was the focus of American intellectuals' involvement with the ideas of the Parisian Existentialists. Sources of difficulty for many of these intellectuals were the Existentialists' links to Marxism, their relationship with the French Communist party (PCF), and their sympathies with American popular culture. None of these were conducive to Greenberg's notion of the Jean Toche (Guerilla Art Action Group). Here was critique by juxtaposition. 21. See Fried, Art and Objecthood: Essays and Reviews, p. 57, n. 24. Had Fried come across 'Modernist Painting' before, but forgotten when? He was in touch with Greenberg and with Kramer, editor of both Arts Magazine and Arts Yearbook, at the time of its broadcast and initial publication. Also he published 'Modernist Painting and Formal Criticism' American Scholar 33, in Autumn 1964, pp. 642-8 which was subsequently adapted for Part I of his introduction to Three American Painters: Kenneth Noland, Jules Olitski, Frank Stella (Fogg Art Museum: Cambridge, MA, 1965). 22. Fried, Art and Objecthood: Essays and Reviews, p. 53. Fried also reminds his readers that Hilton Kramer had referred to 'formalist criticism' and 'formalist art' in his essay, from 1962, 'A Critic on the Side of History: Notes on Clement Greenberg', p. 62 (which Fried misdates as 1961) and that Greenberg had published 'Necessity of Formalism', New Literary History 3, Autumn 1971, pp. 171-5. See Fried, p. 56, n. 14. 23. Kramer, 'A Critic on the Side of History: Notes on Clement Greenberg', p. 61. O'Brian draws attention to Kramer's early assessment of the politics of Art and Culture though with a different purpose to mine: see O'Brian, 'Introduction' to Clement Greenberg, Clement Greenberg, The Collected Essays and Criticism, Volume 3, p. xix. Significantly, too, when Kramer reviewed Volumes 3 and 4, in the notoriously right-wing The New Criterion, he noted O'Brian's reference to his 1962 review only to lambast him for what Kramer regards as a politicised distortion of Greenberg's later criticism in relation to the Cold War: see Kramer, 'Clement Greenberg and the Cold War', The New Criterion, vol. 11, no. 7, March 1993, pp. 4-9, especially pp. 8-9. 24. The parenthesis is as follows: '(Though that is not all, by far, that there was to politics in art in those years; some day it will have to be told how "anti-Stalinism", which started out more or less as "Trotskyism", turned into art for art's sake, and thereby cleared the way, heroically, for what was to come.)' 25.

In January 1958 Leo Castelli's recently opened New York gallery showed work by Jasper Johns and then by Robert Rauschenberg. The Castelli Gallery became a centre for what became known as 'Pop Art', which did not meet with Greenberg's approval. 32. See: A.

Furthermore, Sartre, Existential- ism, Marxism, and socialism became refocused by debates, during 1959 and 1960, about the Cuban Revolution. These debates are inseparable from the constant reports on and analyses of Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, and Cuba to be found in even the most cursory survey of newspapers, magazines, and journals in the United States between 1959 and 1962. Not only had the radical writers James Baldwin, C. Wright Mills, and Sartre visited Cuba but also by the autumn of 1960 Ballantine Books had published Mills' Listen, Yankee and Sartre's Sartre on Cuba. Both argued that the Cuban Revolution was populist and democratic, with Sartre proposing that it was existentialist in character. Sartre's support for Cuba paralleled his anti-colonialist activities, currently Algeria's struggle for independence from France and earlier struggles for freedom from French rule in Indochina. Many such fights for liberation echoed the military and ideological struggles of the 1930s in which Marxism, the Popular Front, and Communism were major elements.39 There were other powerful reminders of the pre-war past. The first year and a half of the Cuban Revolution was celebrated by Trotskyists, many recalling their anti-Stalinist arguments of the 1930s, and was a prompt to New Left student activity as well as Civil Rights protests.40 Such activity was also borne out of critical reflections on America as characterised by the Korean War, McCarthyism, the Ku Klux Klan, Cold War secrecy, and the CIA/State Department support for repressive leaders such as the Cuban dictator Fulgencio Batista. However, Leftist attitudes to the Soviet Union became complicated by a series of events. In May 1960 Cuba approached the United States to discuss their deteriorating relations but the United States refused and ordered American petroleum companies on the island not to process Soviet crude oil. Cuba seized the refineries and the Soviet Union declared that it would defend the Cuban socialist republic with its arms. In the same month, on 1 May, Gary Powers, a pilot of a United States high altitude reconnaissance plane (U-2) was shot down over the USSR producing a major incident right up to and beyond February 1962 when Powers returned to the United States after being exchanged for a convicted Soviet spy. In April 1961 the CIA launched the Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba, which resulted in a humiliating failure. During the following year not only were relations between the countries strained but also escalation in security anxieties increased. Much of this reached an international crescendo in October 1962 with the so-called 'Cuban missile crisis' bringing confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union on the contemporary site of revolutionary possibilities. Further, memories of revolution, repression, and Enlightenment values were evoked for Jewish intellectuals with roots in Marxist struggles against Fascism and racism in the 1930s. In June 1960 Adolf Eichmann, Chief of the Gestapo's Jewish Office and responsible for mass deportation and executions of European Jews during World War Two, was captured by Israeli agents in Buenos Aires. Eichmann was transported back to Israel where he stood trial, was found guilty, and was executed in 1962.41 In the same issue of The Second Coming Magazine that included Greenberg's 'How art writing Earns its Bad Name', the lead article was on the Eichmann trial and questions of international justice as distinct from national and Jewish retribution for the holocaust. The 'portfolio' section was devoted to seven photographs by W. Eugene Smith on the Ku Klux Klan in the United States.42 In the midst of these events, 'Modernist Painting' was written and revised, Art and Culture published and reviewed, and Greenberg confidently attacked opponents and defended a Modernist cultural renaissance in America.

This brings me to a third change in Greenberg's circumstances: official and unofficial attitudes to Communism. In retrospect, the appearance of Greenberg's 'How Art Writing Earns Its Bad Name' in Encounter, as with articles by many other intellectuals including Rosenberg, cannot be separated from the relationship between the CIA and the journal during the 1950s and 1960s.43 This relationship, unbeknown to most of the contributors, was hinted at by Paul Goodman in Dissent in 1962, an Editorial in The Nation in 1964, and an article on the CIA in The New York Times in 1965, but became public in April 1966 when The New York Times ran a series of five articles on the purposes and methods of the CIA.44 The third of these articles from 1966 began to detail false-front organisations and the secret transfer of CIA funds to, for example, the State Department or to the United States Information Agency (USIA) which 'may help finance a scholarly inquiry and publication. Or the agency may channel research money through foundations-legitimate ones or dummy fronts.'45 The New York Times cited, amongst others, the CIA's funding of the anti-Communist organisation of liberal intellectuals the Congress for Cultural Freedom, Encounter magazine, 'several American book publishers', the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Center of International Studies, and a foreign-aid project in South Vietnam run by Michigan State University. During 1966 and 1967 journals from Frontier to Ramparts ran articles questioning the role of the CIA.46 In 1967, Thomas Braden, former supervisor of cultural activities at the CIA, published his notorious 'I'm Glad the CIA is Immoral' and in 1968 Christopher Lasch extended the analysis.47 During the 1950s and 1960s the CIA's covert Cold War propaganda campaign linked intellectuals and journals in a variety of ways.48 One example is the Congress for Cultural Freedom (CCF), based in Paris with numerous international Committees, which from 1950 to 1967 was run by Michael Josselson, who was revealed to have been a CIA agent.49 Greenberg, along with numerous other intellectuals, joined the American Committee for Cultural Freedom (ACCF) in 1950, and he became a member of its executive committee. There were those, such as Meyer Schapiro, who refused to join the ACCF believing that behind the Committee's appeal to the 'less obviously political' ends of 'cultural freedom' was a concealed purpose of 'fighting the world communist movement.' Although Schapiro had sympathy for this latter aim he was wary of organisations with covert purposes.50 Divisions both within the ACCF and between intellectual journals during the 1950s reveal that Schapiro's doubts were well founded especially within the context of intellectuals' attitudes to, and fears about, McCarthyism. For example, in 1951, Greenberg made public his anti-communist charges against a former colleague at The Nation and the magazine itself, which he claimed were pro- Soviet.51 His letters were subsequently used by Republican Congressman Dondero, a noted supporter in the 1950s of McCarthyism, in the Congressional Records.52 In 1952 Greenberg was also involved in an ACCF split over a choice between actively pursuing 'anti-communism' or 'cultural freedom'. At a planning meeting for an ACCF conference, entitled 'In Defence of Free Culture', James T. Farrell proposed a resolution that 'the main job in this country is fighting McCarthyism'. For him Communism in the United States no longer posed any threat and he recommended that 'the most effective way of influencing European intellectuals is to show how we defend cultural freedom in our own country'.53 Farrell's resolution was supported by Dwight MacDonald and Richard Rovere, 'but Sidney Hook, Daniel Bell, 35.

Apart from Encounter, which was a central asset to the CIA, other journals that received CIA funding through false front accounts and foundations (such as the Fairfield Foundation) included the leftist but anti-communist publications Partisan Review and New Leader, the literary magazine Kenyon Review and abroad Der Monat, Preuves, and Tempo Presente. Greenberg's participation in such journals is linked to the figure of Melvin J. Lasky. Lasky was successful in arguing for an overtly American-oriented cultural journal in Europe and was instrumental in the formation of the Congress for Cultural Freedom. In 1948 he secured funds from OMGUS (the US Office of the Military Government in Germany) to establish Der Monat which first appeared in October 1948 and included a German translation of Greenberg's 'The Necessity of the Old Masters', which he Clement Greenberg, William Phillips, F. W. Dupee, and the vast majority of others found various reasons to object'.54 The objectors perceived Stalinism and Communism as the greater dangers. As Alan Wald argues, Philip Rahv identified the dilemmas inherent in the tacit acceptance of McCarthyism by the centre and right wings of the ACCF. In 1952 Rahv saw in his generation a process of 'the embourgeoisement of the American intelligensia': Especially vulnerable in this respect are some of the ex-radicals and ex-Marxists, who have gone so far in smoothly re-adapting themselves, in unlearning the old and learning the new lessons, as to be scarcely distinguishable from the common run of philistines. In their narrow world anti- Stalinism has become almost a professional stance. It has come to mean so much that it excludes nearly all other concerns and ideas, with the result that they are trying to turn anti- Stalinism into something which it can never be: a total outlook on life, no less, or even a philosophy of history. Apparently some of them find it altogether easy to put up with the vicious antics of a political bum like Senator McCarthy, even as they grow more and more intolerant of any basic criticism of existing social arrangements.55 During the rest of the decade many 'ex-radicals and ex-Marxists', disillusioned with communism or coping with the loss of pre-war socialist hope, became fellow travellers to an unofficial Ministry of Culture funded by a matrix of overt and covert interests. Goodman in 'The Devolution of Democracy' (1962), is particularly playful in his coded references to the relationships between intellectuals, institutions, and covert manipulation.56 He writes of a philosopher close to President Kennedy who explains that 'the best to be hoped from government is to "mitigate the evils of modern life" . . . since, by this philosophy, man is incurably stupid and institutions evil, he must not get too hot to reform this or that present evil'.7 Soon Goodman inserts a parenthesis, suggesting an awareness of present institutions, in which he states: Needless to say, however, when Cultural Freedom and the Encounter of ideas are instruments of the CIA, means have been readily found to subsidize intellectual groups, even though nothing could be more treasonable to cultural freedom and the encounter of ideas.58 Goodman's use of capitals for the first references to 'Cultural Freedom' and 'Encounter' is to signal the Congress (CCF) and the magazine (Encounter). By juxtaposition he suggests that covert subsidies and the co-option of intellectuals were ways in which 'cultural freedom and the encounter of ideas' could be harnessed to various institutional processes and CIA interests. Importantly, the relationship was one of being harnessed to, rather than conspiratorially manipulated by, such processes and interests. In the late 1950s and early 1960s the agendas of the CIA and State Agencies such as the USIA included ideas about Modernity and Modernism particularly as they related to manageable images of American guardianship. Did such agendas create conditions without which the production of and revisions to 'Modernist Painting', and to other texts, would have been unlikely? Did Greenberg regard the values he ascribed to Modernism as central to particular beliefs in contemporary America as the only civilised defence against the mistakes and catastrophes of the previous twenty-five years? Greenberg's revisions to his earlier articles are evidence of attempts to make them consistent with the views and terminology evident in 'Modernist Painting'. For example, in Art and Culture, 'Modernist Sculpture, Its Pictorial Past' was originally titled 'Cross-Breeding of Modern Sculpture' (Art News, Summer 1952) and 'On the Role of Nature in Modernist Painting' was originally titled 'The Role of Nature in Modern Painting' (Partisan Review, January 1949). Both essays were substantially altered, making their OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 77</page><page sequence="8">Francis Frascina terminology more consistent with that in his VOA lecture. Apart from revised titles, instances of the phrase 'Modernist painting' as a replacement for 'modern painting' can be found in 'The New Sculpture', a greatly revised text originally published, with the same title, in Partisan Review in June 1949. It is clear from such essays that some of Greenberg's views in 'Modernist Painting' have roots in the 1940s and 1950s. However, in Art and Culture, his revised and collected essays became a corpus of a specialising critical formulation. This specialising form of criticism was his own contribution to what he regarded as Modernist culture: a practice of writing that was a parallel to his views about art and the 'literal essence' of the particular medium. 'Modernist Painting' represents, as it were, a distillation, the 'literal essence', of a critical approach based on aesthetic beliefs codified during the 1950s. The essay may thus be considered, in Greenbergian terms, as a Modernist work in which he attempted to avoid 'dependence upon any order of experience not given in the most essentially construed nature of its medium. . . . The arts [including that of criticism?] are to achieve concreteness, "purity", by acting solely in terms of their separate and irreducible selves.'59 That was a view to be found in the revised formulation of 'The New Sculpture', dated 1958. In 1949 we read the earlier version: Only by reducing themselves to the means by which they attain virtuality as art, to the literal essence of their medium, and only by avoiding as much as possible explicit reference to any form of experience not given immediately through their mediums, can the arts communicate that sense of concretely felt, irreducible experience in which our sensibility finds its fundamental certainty.60 By the time he wrote 'Modernist Painting' Greenberg's 'sensibility' had found 'fundamental certainty', as evidenced by his essay 'After Abstract Expression- ism', published in Art International on 25 October 1962. In this long defence of Newman, Rothko, and Still, Greenberg locates their work as examples of 'swinging' the self-criticism of 'advanced painting' in a new direction. In doing so, he cites his 'Modernist Painting' as the place where he has written of the self-critical process that is, supposedly, the infra-logic of Modernist art. Given the importance to Greenberg of 'Modernist Painting' what are we to make of Hilton Kramer's arguments, in 1962, about the place of his criticism in relation to the 'artistic values', 'salient achievements and aesthetic beliefs' of the early Cold War years? To consider this question we need to examine how he came to write the text.61 The Voice of America: 'Forum-The Arts and Sciences in Mid-Century America' On 4 January 1960 Lamar Dodd, Head of the Department of Art, University of Georgia, Athens, Georgia, sent an invitation to Greenberg to participate in a new VOA programme of international broadcasts called 'Forum-The Arts and Sciences in Mid-Century America'.62 The honorarium for each speaker was $250 dollars. The VOA, which had been broadcasting to listeners around the world since it was established in February 1942, became a part of the United States Information Agency (USIA) in 1954. The USIA was created as an independent agency on 1 August 1953, reporting directly to the President and receiving policy guidance from the Department of State, which retained control over educational and cultural affairs until 1978. The new 'Forum' project was designed to present a continuing series of lectures in the vein of the BBC's 'Third Programme'. The first of the broadcasts in the field of medicine was inaugurated on 5 January 1959, followed by music. By 1967, had previously published in Partisan Review, July 1948. Lasky became an editor of Encounter. 49.

At the time there was a critical investigation into the USIA: see 'Senate Unit Sets Study of U.S.I.A.' The New York Times, 29 May 1956, p. 11, which also noted the increase in funding for the USIA forty lecture series, ranging from 'Agriculture' to 'Visual Arts', had been broadcast with texts and tapes available to Government offices and libraries throughout the world. Dodd had been invited to become coordinator of this particular series, which became titled 'Visual Arts', by Walter Nichols, Forum Project Officer at the USIA, in February 1959.63 The half-hour 'Forum' lectures were broadcast over the Voice of America's World-Wide English facilities to Latin America, Europe, Africa, the Near East, Far East, and South Asia. Nichols stressed that these broadcasts made 'no concession to the non- intellectual listener' and whilst they are strictly 'without any attempt at propaganda'64 the basic objectives were: to establish a nexus between America's foremost academic and cultural figures and institutions and their counterparts abroad, to highlight current American trends and developments in the arts and sciences, and to gain added appreciation and respect for American intellectual achievement by displaying its best products. We believe that a program so conceived should also serve to stimulate among the intelligentsia behind the Iron Curtain an awareness of and interest in patterns of thought and creative endeavor differing substantially from those to which they are currently restricted.65 It is clear from this letter that communication between the American 'intelligentsia' and similar groups in particular areas of the world, especially those 'behind the Iron Curtain', was of major concern to the VOA, and therefore to the USIA. Important, too, was a consumerist emphasis on the international display of the 'best products' of domestic intellectuals. Further, Nichols used a strategy of otherness to imply that American 'patterns of thought' and 'creative endeavor' are not 'restricted'. Significantly, he continued by stressing that two 'indispensable' aspects to the success of the 'Forum' are 'the moral support of the American academic and cultural community as a whole [and] . . . the personal participation of its most distinguished members' (my emphasis).66 Here, there is a combination of the weight of moral collectivism and personal agency in identifying with a particular construction of American characteristics. Nichols was also careful to avoid any suggestion of political interference, undoubtedly aware of the critical reaction to the USIA's cancellation of Sport in Art and 100 American Artists of the Twentieth Century in 1956.67 They were cancelled because of claims, particularly from conservative religious groups, that some of the selected artists were pro-communist. The USIA's interference, about to erupt again, had been resisted by the American Federation of Arts to which Dodd belonged. Nichols stated: 'Aware of the difficulties inherent in any attempt to exercise more than a general administrative supervision over such a project, we are making our resources available to the American academic and cultural community to achieve what we believe should be mutually desirable objectives. '68 In his letter to Greenberg, as with all his invitations to participate, Dodd quoted three paragraphs from Nichols' letter as background. All of the above quotes were included in these paragraphs. Greenberg would, therefore, have been conversant with Nichols' emphases and assumptions. One of the latter is made a little more explicit in a subsequent paragraph of Nichols' letter to Dodd. After flattering remarks about Dodd's 'recognized position in the field of art' serving to 'enhance the prestige of the program', Nichols noted that 'Your familiarity with current trends in art in the Soviet Union should also be particularly helpful in the selection of appropriate subject matter.' Dodd was one of four visitors to Moscow in October-November 1958 as guests of the Soviet Union in the first exchange of artists following the cultural agreement OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 79</page><page sequence="10">Francis Frascina with the United States signed in January 1958.69 He travelled under the auspices of the Fine Arts Committee of the People-to-People Program and continued contacts with the Soviet Union. Inaugurated by President Eisenhower in September 1956, the People-to-People Program comprised thirty-eight committees, with a variety of headings, and was a massive programme of communication between Americans and the people of other countries. From a report on its activities, dated 30 June 1959, we can gain an insight into the USIA's increased emphasis on cultural operations including the start of the VOA 'Forum' series and close cooperation with the People-to-People Program. One of the USIA's two stated aims during the previous year was to 'Exploit current developments in such a manner as to gain maximum favorable impact for the United States and maximum unfavorable impact for the Communist countries.'70 Considerable new emphasis was placed on long- range activities and on obtaining the 'assistance of outstanding non- governmental Americans to a greater extent than before.' One cited example of efforts to project the 'American image abroad' was the VOA series 'Forum-The Arts and Sciences in Mid-Century America'. Alongside securing assistance of non-governmental contributors to such series, the Agency continued to 'strengthen its relations with non-governmental organizations and individuals' including 'close cooperation' with the People-to-People Program'.71 It is evident that the Agency regarded radio transmission and exhibitions, including Agency contributions to the Museum of Modern Art's (MoMA) travelling Family of Man exhibition, as two of its most successful means of disseminating 'information about the United States' directly to peoples beyond the 'Iron Curtain'.72 Generally, too, the role of printed material, circulated in English or in translation, was perceived as an important addition to this strategy. Within this system, bureaucratic filters and controls maintained the ideological processes of selection. The first act of selection was the choice of coordinator for the particular programme. Lamar Dodd represented an acceptable filter with regional, national, and, in terms of his visit to the Soviet Union, international understandings of American cultural interests. In October 1957 he became one of ten members of the Advisory Committee on the Arts appointed by the Secretary of State.73 His contacts with the institutional world of the visual arts made him, from the point of view of the USIA, a competent authority.74 Competence and authority are, of course, carefully audited especially where the image of the State is at stake. The USIA was sensitive to the need not to be seen as directly injecting its views into the 'initial thinking- through process' of the Forum series. However, the Agency reserved the right of final approval of programme proposals and prospective participants, referred to as the 'prospectus'. Nichols in his letter to Dodd of 26 June 1959, cited an example of one series where the initial prospectus of twenty programmes was eventually reduced to fifteen programmes 'in the review process'.75 The criteria for this process are not outlined. Some of the series such as 'Agriculture' included over twenty-three broadcasts, others such as 'Mass Communication' only eleven. The proposal of Greenberg for the Visual Arts series survived the USIA's 'review process'. The suggestion for his invitation resulted from one of Dodd's initial letters seeking support amongst his professional colleagues. Two names that he immediately thought of were Museum contacts: Lloyd Goodrich, Director, and John I. H. Baur, Assistant Director, of the Whitney Museum of American Art in New York. Both of them were willing to contribute from $87,000,000 to $115,000,00 for the fiscal year opening 1 July 1956. 68.

Dodd's letter identified two major questions. One was the replacement for Barr and the other whether to invite Leslie Cheek for the talk that was eventually titled 'The Art Museum as a Community Center'. Dodd asked Nichols to get back to him on both questions as soon as possible and specifically requested a phone call on the Cheek invite. 81.

Campbell, programmes and after discussion made further proposals to Dodd. On the topic of 'advanced trends in contemporary American art', they recommended Alfred Barr, from MoMA, with his talk on American abstract art, which he had recently given in Moscow.76 As alternatives they suggested Meyer Schapiro, James Johnson Sweeney, Clement Greenberg, or Harold Rosenberg.77 Dodd sent a letter of invitation to Barr and received a reply on 21 December 1959, in which Barr declined because of his time-consuming involvement in MoMA's multi-million dollar fund raising drive.78 In Dodd's letter to Nichols, dated 28 December 1959, keeping the Forum Editor up to date on progress, he informed him of Barr's unavailability and of the fall-back names of Meyer Schapiro, James Soby, or Greenberg. Dodd had in mind Nichols' earlier letter stressing the need for a review process on names and contributions and, therefore, asked Nichols for his 'approval' of one of the three names so that an approach could be made.9 As Dodd's letter to Greenberg was sent out on 4 January 1960, Nichols must have phoned through his approval.80 The politics of approval are significant but difficult to pin down. Why Greenberg? Whatever the answer, the character of the USIA, as with other State operations, means that records and files would have been checked. It is clear that Dodd was attempting to compile what he thought was a prestigious list of speakers but in terms of both his own institutional filtering and the informal and formal approval by Nichols the list was bound to take on a particular character. In a letter to Nichols, dated 18 November 1959, the issue of specific political choice came to the surface. Dodd and Goodrich had been looking over the provisional list and Goodrich suggested inviting an artist to speak such as Stuart Davis or Ted Roszak. Dodd states that Davis 'has a lot to say, and he can speak well'. Even in 1959 the leftist interests of Davis, rooted in the 1930s, would have been known.81 Goodrich also suggested Ben Shahn. Given Shahn's recent experience of anti-communist attacks on artists in the 'Moscow Controversy' of 1959 (see later), Dodd felt it necessary to note in his letter: 'Unfortunately, Shahn was one of the artists who came up for discussion in this last controversy, and unfortunately he took the Fifth Amendment in June.'82 The final list of speakers did not include either Davis or Shahn and the eventual broadcast titled 'The Artist Speaks' was by Kyle Morris.83 Dodd invited Greenberg to contribute a lecture on 'The Abstract Movement', the title of which changed by March. Dodd's letter has a strong patriotic flavour stressing that as participants 'we would have a wonderful opportunity of making an outstanding personal contribution to our government and, indeed, to the prestige of the United States. In addition to our own chosen profession in relation to its proper place in American society.'84 Towards the end he says 'the Voice of America-and particularly this "Forum" series, which, in my opinion, is unique in every aspect-needs you'.85 On 11 January 1960 Greenberg wrote to Dodd accepting his invitation: Thank you for your most flattering request to do a talk for the new Forum of the USIS [sic]. I accept with pleasure . . . The new Forum program sounds exciting. I especially like the idea of not being required to talk down to one's audience. More power to you and the USIS in that direction.86 Greenberg's reference to the USIS (United States Information Service) rather than the USIA is a small but not insignificant slip. The USIS referred to officers and agents overseas: typically, in larger posts, a public affairs officer, an information officer, and a cultural affairs officer. By 15 March, Dodd had received Greenberg's essay and in a postscript to a OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 81</page><page sequence="12">Francis Frascina letter asked Nichols whether he would approve his suggestion that the title of the talk be altered so that 'Abstract' be changed to 'Modernism'. Dodd thought that the title of the talk should reflect the fact that Greenberg's references to 'Modernism' were so frequent and the term, for him, was clearly defined (though he recommended dictionaries and encyclopaedias for the envisaged scholars reading this at the USIA).87 In a note to Dodd, dated 8 April 1960, Greenberg asked for an opportunity to send in a revised draft, as he was unhappy about some of the transitions and wording in the essay.88 On 27 April Dodd wrote to Nichols asking about the status of the Greenberg essay recommending that they should proceed with the recording.8 The revised text with the title 'Modernist Painting' was recorded on 11 May 1960.90 From the archive lists of all the VOA Forum Lectures the original broadcast dates for the 'Visual Arts in America' started 7 November 1960 and ended 6 March 1961.91 As Lecture 14, Greenberg's broadcast would have gone out to millions worldwide on 6 February 1961. In a letter to Gorelina Natalia, USSR Industrial Exhibitions, Foreign Department, Moscow, Dodd details both the broadcast schedules and speakers and the specifics of his first Lecture in the series, 'The Visual Arts in Mid-Century America': to be broadcast on 'Monday, November 7 (18:30 GMT, 31, 49 and 75 meter bands short wave, and 173 kilocycles long wave; 21:30 GMT 31, 49 and 75).'92 By 6 December 1960 all the pamphlets with texts of the broadcasts had been printed. Nichols, who had received copies from the Regional Service Centre in Manila, Philippines, was able to confirm to Dodd that a complete set had been sent to him.93 In the same letter he notes that the texts will soon be translated and recorded in Spanish for local broadcast in Latin America, also in Arabic, and 'in time will be broadcast in Russian'. 'Censorship', 'Propaganda', and 'Ideology' In June 1959 Lamar Dodd wrote to several people asking for their suggestions for topics and contributors to the 'Forum Series'. In his letters he makes clear that the State Department will be paying the participants and stresses that there will be no censorship.94 For Dodd the possibility of censorship was an anxiety especially given what Dodd refers to, in his letter to Lloyd Goodrich, as the importance being placed upon the visual arts today.95 Further, in a letter to Nichols, Dodd was keen to confirm that participants will be contracted directly by the USIA, 'thus assuring us of some kind of guarantee for the use of the material'.96 In the same month Dodd invited Thomas Munro, Curator of Education at the Cleveland Museum of Art, stressing that there was no propaganda in the Forum Series.97 Evidence of Dodd's continued sensitivity to perceptions of the content of the Forum series can be found in a letter sent to Nichols dated 16 March 1960, about Carl Zigrosser's essay on 'Prints'. In his text, Zigrosser mentions the work of Rockwell Kent, long associated with leftist groups, on Dondero's list of 'communists', and since 1957 Chair of the national Council of American- Soviet Friendship.98 Dodd writes: As far as I am concerned, I would leave it; but I am wondering if anyone there [in the USIA] is going to yell bloody murder. Whether or not we dare ask him to remove this name, I do not know. After all, the U.S. gave Rockwell Kent a passport to go to Russia last year.99 Dodd's mention of Kent's passport refers to the culmination of a long legal battle. To honour Kent on his seventy-fifth birthday in 1957, VOKS, the Soviet cultural organisation, held a commemorative exhibition in Moscow's 'Decorative Arts and Crafts'; 13.

There were in fact four exhibitions so threatened. A letter, dated 27 May 1956, from Porter McCray, Director of Circulating Exhibits and the International Program, MoMA, to Nelson Rockefeller states that McCarthy and Dondero threatened to withhold congressional funds from the USIA unless 'all artists alleged as subversive or engaged in un-American activities be withdrawn from four exhibitions now in preparation for the USIA'. McCray said that 'these exhibitions can be approximately identified' as: 1. Sport in Art; 2. Selections from University Collections; 3. Paintings U.S.A. 1900-1950; 4. Paintings Selected by the Artists. Copy of letter in Museum of Modern Art Archives, Alfred H. Barr Papers (Archives of American Art [AAA] Roll 3157, Frames 1128-1129). 103. See letter, dated 28 March 1957, from Edward Stansbury, Chief of the Exhibits Division, USIA, to Porter McCray, in Museum of Modern Art Archives, Alfred H. Barr Papers Pushkin Museum comprising fifty-five of his paintings and one hundred and twenty of his drawings and lithographs. The State Department refused to issue Kent with a passport for any travel purposes, preventing him from attending the opening of the exhibition. Kent appealed against this denial of his travel rights and was supported by the Emergency Civil Liberties Committee (ECLC). Clark Foreman, ECLC executive director, drew attention to the massive irony that there could be an approved exchange of paintings but not of painters. Apart from the Kent case, he had in mind that of Picasso whose work was a revered central cog in MoMA's account of modern art but whose membership of the French Communist Party prevented him visiting the United States. He was refused entry in 1950 as head of a twelve-member European peace delegation of the World Congress of Partisans of Peace. The State Department regarded the latter as the 'leading Communist front organization in the world' and that its twelve members 'are either known Communists or fellow travellers and are therefore subject to exclusion'.100 In the summer of 1957, New York's MoMA held a large Picasso exhibition to honour his seventy-fifth birthday. An FBI memorandum from 1957 commented on the show and quoted Barr as saying 'We do not want to put Picasso in an embarrassing position by inviting him only to have his entry questioned by our Government. ' 01 Some of the basis for renewed anxiety about the role of the USIA was directly related to lingering effects of the cancellation of exhibitions by the Agency on what seemed to many as ideological grounds. As we have seen, the most recent dated back to 1956 with Sport in Art and 100 American Artists of the Twentieth Century, both of which were to travel abroad under the sponsorship of the United States government through the federal agency of the USIA.102 In 1957 the USIA refused MoMA's exhibition 30 American Printmakers, part of the International Program, because it included the work of William Gropper. Gropper was on a Department of State and USIA exclusion list.103 Strictly, this list was produced by applying a set of USIA regulations related to the retention of material in the USIS 'Book and Library Program' but the same regulations were applied to the 'Exhibits Program'. Regulation III. C stated: Works of avowed communists, persons convicted of crimes involving a threat to the security of the United States, or persons who publicly refuse to answer questions of Congressional committees regarding their connections with the communist movement, shall not be used, even if their content is unobjectionable, unless it is determined that a particular item is clearly useful for the special purposes of the program.104 In October 1959 Dodd was anxious that something similar to events in 1956 and 1957 was happening at the very time he was deeply involved in planning the USIA's 'Forum' series on the Visual Arts. He expressed a series of anxieties in a letter to Nichols dated 29 October 1959.'?5 The first reason for his anxiety was news that the USIA had recently cancelled an exhibition assembled by Andrew Ritchie, Director of Yale University's Art Gallery, to tour Italy, Romania, and Czechoslovakia. The exhibition of ten American sculptors had been selected, loans arranged, the catalogue written, and works ready for shipment when the Contracting Officer of the USIA sent a telegram cancelling the agreement. The exhibition had been contracted for on 22 June 1959 but the cancellation was not given until 24 September.106 Related to these events was the case of another museum director organising an exhibition for the USIA being 'called by long distance and told to remove paintings by a certain painter from a shipment going abroad, even though the paintings and the individual had been cleared repeatedly by what he thought were the proper OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 83</page><page sequence="14">Francis Frascina authorities'.'07 The second more immediate reason for anxiety was a two-day meeting of the US Advisory Committee on the Arts in New York, from which Dodd had just returned, spent in what he describes as utter frustration. The Advisory Committee had been created by the 'International Cultural Exchange and Trade Fair Protection Act' of 1956. Its remit was to advise and assist the President and Government Departments and Agencies in the conduct of the cultural programme authorised by Public Law 860, 84th Congress, and, with special reference to the role of the arts, in other international cultural activities and exchanges.108 The inaugural meeting of the Committee, addressed by Secretary of State Dulles was held on 15 January 1958. The particular frustrations and worries felt by Dodd and other members during and after the meeting in October 1959 relate to the Committee constantly running into snags mostly explained as budgetary excuses. These excuses, Dodd states, are not believable. One example he cites is the cancellation of the Yale exhibition which the USIA claims was 'done on the basis of "budgetary limitations'" but which, in fact, took $10,000 to cancel. Dodd says that the story he is 'trying to tell is not a new one. It has been going on for years. In fact, it dates back to the Truman administration.' He cites the 'recent Moscow controversy' as 'just another page in the book'.109 By referring to the Truman administration Dodd evoked the list of cancellations and controversies that began with the state-sponsored touring exhibition Advancing American Art, which was cancelled by the State Department whilst on tour in 1947. From its first showing in 1946 the exhibition was subjected to a sustained attack by Dondero-inspired newspapers and magazines claiming that it was full of left-wing painters.110 The cancellation by the USIA of the exhibition organised by Ritchie at Yale in September 1959 was, for Dodd and others, a continuation of this story of State interference particularly in the light of the negative publicity over American Painting and Sculpture, which formed part of the American National Exhibition in Moscow (25 July to 5 September 1959). For the latter the USIA had appointed a selection committee, approved by President Eisenhower, comprising Lloyd Goodrich, Henry Hope, Franklin Watkins, and Theodore Roszak. Their task was to select works to represent American art of the previous thirty years for an exhibition to be opened by Vice President Nixon on 25 July. The works chosen ranged from Thomas Hart Benton's Boom Town (1928), to Jacob Lawrence's Fulton and Nostrand (1958). Also included were examples of social realist art from the 1930s as well as paintings by Baziotes, de Kooning, Pollock, Motherwell, and Rothko. The work of three of the artists included in Sport in Art and attacked as having communist connections were selected: Ben Shahn. Yasuo Kuniyoshi, and William Zorach. In June 1959 when the list of artists was announced Representative Francis E. Walter, chair of the House Committee on Un- American Activities (HUAC) claimed that of the sixty-seven artists included, thirty-four had records of affiliation with Communist fronts and causes, and that twenty-two of them had a minimum total of four hundred and sixty-five Communist connections.111 For him, these affiliations and connections were so 'significant' that he asked Secretary of State Christian A. Herter to remove the relevant artists' works from the exhibition. Walter reminded the Secretary of State, in a letter, that on four previous occasions American art exhibitions had been cancelled because the participating artists were held to be Communist sympathisers. Further he stated that these previously cancelled exhibitions had included works of participants in the Moscow exhibition.112 It is no surprise that Walter as chair of HUAC had close ties with Dondero and Nixon.

Fine Arts Council in February 1957, the first non-artist to be so honoured, both Nixon and Walter were present. Nixon's presence as the very epitome of anti-communism was, together with that of Walter, regarded as the best stamp of approval of Dondero's efforts.13 Walter chaired the HUAC meeting on 1 July 1959 when the hearings on the Moscow exhibition included an attack by Wheeler Williams, sculptor and President of the American Artists Professional League and former President of the reactionary National Sculpture Society.114 The 1 July was also the date on which Shahn and Philip Evergood had been subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Un-American Activities for alleged communist associations and activities.115 Whether by coincidence or design, this was the day of reports on the public opening of the Soviet Exhibition of Science, Technology, and Culture in the New York Coliseum (30 June to 10 August) drawing 40,000 to 50,000 visitors.116 Officially opened on the evening of 29 June, by First Deputy Premier Kozlov and Vice President Nixon, after a visit by President Eisenhower, Nixon stressed 'basic conflicts of interest and deeply clashing ideologies.'117 President Eisenhower became directly involved in the Moscow controversy when he was asked questions at a news conference held on 1 July 1959. In his answers, Eisenhower stressed that the art exhibition was a relatively minor sector, filling two rooms, of the total exhibition over two floors: 'I am not going to be the censor myself for the art that has already gone there. Now I think I might have something to say if we have another exhibit, anywhere . . . '. He had in mind the officials responsible for the methods they produced, and the juries selected, in organising such exhibitions. In response to questions about the actual selection of works for the Moscow exhibition, Eisenhower recommended that in addition 'what America likes . . . ought to be shown', which suggested a more conservative attitude to recent American art.118 As a result of his criticism twenty-seven paintings, predominantly from the nineteenth century, were added and left by plane for Moscow on 23 July, in the custody of a member of the USIA. The USIA stated that the decision to add works was taken by George V. Allen, USIA Director, soon after Eisenhower's press conference 'in order to lend depth and historical perspective to the collection' in Moscow.119 On 2 July the four members of the selection committee for American Painting and Sculpture sent a telegram to the President strongly supporting his decision that no works would be withdrawn from the exhibition. On 6 July they followed this up with an open letter, which stressed that 'the exhibition is not communistic, negative, or un-American. Nor does it consist of pretty idealized pictures of our country, such as artists of totalitarian nations are obliged to paint. It demonstrates the freedom of artistic expression and the variety of individual viewpoints that mark a democratic society.'120 The committee regarded recent attacks as the repeated claims of a small minority of ultra-conservative artists, mostly sculptors, who had received government art commissions and had a vested interest in opposing any broadening of government art activities. One person they had in mind was Wheeler Williams. Further, they argued that the attacks were 'based almost entirely on the alleged personal opinions and backgrounds of some of the artists . . . such considerations are irrelevant. The Government is not exhibiting the artists, but their works. Our selections are based on the works themselves, not on personal considerations.' 21 Whilst members of the selection committee were relieved that the President and the USIA Director refused to omit any works from the Moscow exhibition, they were concerned about some of the President's statements. OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 85</page><page sequence="16">Francis Frascina Goodrich criticised several of these statements in an interview reported in The New York Times on 4 July 1959,122 and his anxieties were exacerbated by the USIA cancellation of the Yale-organised exhibition in September. In November 1959 Goodrich made a statement to the Advisory Committee on Cultural Information, USIA, on behalf of the Joint Committee of four national art organisations, the American Association of Museums, the American Federation of Arts, the association of Art Museum Directors, and the College Art Association of America. He confirmed their views about the need to judge a work of art 'on its merits', aside from personal or other matters, and on the dangers of the political screening of art and artists: if a policy of political screening should be adopted, we doubt whether the visual arts can continue to play a role in the cultural exchange program. It is unlikely that professional organizations and institutions would be willing to cooperate on pre-censored exhibitions, or that museums or private collections would lend to them. This would mean that any exhibitions which might be organized would be confined to ultra-conservative art, or to artists too young to have had political backgrounds. Either alternative would give a distorted picture of the visual arts in our country.123 The reference to 'political backgrounds' evoked the opinions and affiliations of American artists, which dated back to the 1930s.'24 For Goodrich, a broad based selection was important because, as he later recalled, the American Painting and Sculpture in Moscow was the 'only time that we have ever had to show American civilization to the Russian people.'125 When the exhibition returned from Moscow, the Whitney showed it with Goodrich writing a small catalogue retelling the attack on the exhibition. Significantly, Goodrich recognised the peculiar interrelations between the constructed images of American culture at home and abroad especially when American Painting and Sculpture was shown at the Whitney: 'It was not a show that was really designed for American consumption. It was meant for a foreign audience.'126 Culture, consumerism, progress, and politics were combined in representations of the United States in the various pavilions at the American National Exhibition, the first of its sort in the Soviet Union. The images to be presented were of how 'America lives, works, learns, produces, consumes, plays; what the American people are and what they stand for; America's cultural and spiritual values' 127 ranging from Pepsi Cola to MoMA's New Images of Man exhibition. At the official opening on 24 July 1959, Vice President Richard Nixon and Soviet Premier Nikita Khrushchev had a much publicised 'kitchen debate' in front of an American model kitchen, containing a range of appliances, as part of a model ranch house.'28 The house was built by All-State Properties and furnished by Macy's at the request of the State Department. The two politicians clashed on the relative merits of their social and political systems. Nixon claimed that the typical American worker could afford the $14,000 for the six-room house, and that the 'American Way of Life' provided refrigerators, washing machines, televisions, and cars to a supposed classless society. Sub-texts to this debate reveal American anxieties about being perceived as a shallow consumer-driven society, cravings for close association with notions of quality, the unmentionable realities of domestic poverty and discrimination, and the unacknowledged emphasis on the norm of a suburban middle-class, white family unit.129 Only a few days later, The New York Times included an enormous advert for 'MACY'S, THE WORLD'S LARGEST STORE . . . U.S.A.'130 Headed by the recent photograph of Krushchev and Nixon in front of the model kitchen furnished by Macy's, the advert also included photographs of Russian visitors lining up to visit the house 122.

The opening of the exhibition and the 'debate' were headline news on 25 and 26 July, and continued to be reported during the rest of the week. See, for example: The New York Times, 25 July 1959, pp. 1,2, 3 and 4; The New York Times, 26 July 1959, pp. 1,2, 3,4,5,7, and Section 4, 'The News of the Week in Review', pp. El, E2 and E3.

In the midst of these reports there were other reminders. For example, on 1 July 1959, the day The New York Times reported the opening of the Soviet Exhibition of Science, Technology, and Culture in the New York Coliseum (pp. 1 and 3), it included news of the blocking by 'parliamentary maneuvers' of Senate committee action on civil rights legislation (p. 16), and 'Tour of Harlem Slums Shocks [Manhattan Borough President] Jack and Officials Into a 86 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="17">Institutions, Culture, and America's 'Cold War Years': the Making of Greenberg's 'Modernist Painting' "War"' (p. 22). On 26 July 1959, the day that The New York Times extended its reports on the opening of the American exhibition in Moscow, there were two juxtaposed articles, one on 'Slums Still Growing Despite City Efforts' with a map of slum areas throughout Manhattan, Brooklyn, and the Bronx, and one on 'Little Rock Now Moves to Some Segregation', Section 4, p.

The Saturday Evening Post at this time is equally revealing, where full page spectacular colour adverts for consumer objects mixed with articles and serials.

A week later a double page spread advertising United States Steel, conjoins images of the model kitchen, with a 'organization girl', a 'fun world' of steel parasol tower and Ferris wheel, echoing the Moscow site, and the novel products of stereos and TVs with one of the objects caressed by another 'model housewife', The Saturday Evening Post, 8 August 1959, pp. 44-5. 134.

The exhibition was at MoMA from 28 May to 8 September 1959. at the Moscow exhibition and four images of the duplicate house at Macy's Roosevelt Field, LI, for Americans to see. In the text there was a repost to the Soviet Agency Tass, which doubted that an American worker could afford the house or enter into Macy's with $5000, let alone succeed in buying such furniture with this sum. The advert asserted that there was nothing 'you or your neighbors couldn't have . . . or afford', stating that the house, including the General Electric kitchen, cost $13,000 and was furnished by Macy's for $4,938.19. Relying on Cold War economic and social assumptions, the advert claimed that on any day of the year, anywhere in the USA, 'you can walk into a store to find not only furniture like this, but thousands of similar pieces . . . especially at Macy's where your freedom of choice is greatest'. Lfe magazine on 10 August, covered Nixon's visit in spectacular colour: 'A Barnstorming Masterpiece: the Vice President in Russia.'131 The report included several photographs including a full page in colour showing a display of consumer objects in a model supermarket. Both the display and the photograph emphasised a close relationship between objects for purchase within an abstract setting: 'airy panels of transparent color, set in bold geometric panels, separate exhibits of dishes and cooking utensils'. The report details how visitors saw this 'spectacle' from balconies.132 Architecture and design journals reported on the plans for the exhibition and contained articles on its reception. Spectacular innovation was a major aspect from the design of the main building, a golden aluminium geodesic dome designed by Buckminster Fuller, to plastic parasol roofed pavilions, the major one housing MoMA's New Images of Man. Mass produced pre-fabricated elements shipped from the United States were assembled in Moscow, emphasising the planning and production capabilities of capitalism.133 A major embarrassment within the first week was that the large number of visitors caused the concrete floors of both the 50,000 square foot main building and the 30,000 square foot dome to crumble producing damaging dust. IBM's giant electronic computer, which answered questions about the United States, was put out of action until the floors were covered in asphalt.'34 Back in New York, Frank Lloyd Wright's startling Guggenheim Museum was opened in September 1959. This was a symbol of cultural change at home, complementing images presented abroad. 35 Reports of the opening appeared in the November issue of Architectural Record, which also contained major features on the Moscow exhibition and on 'Sighting the Sixties: Launching a Second U.S.A.'136 The latter, using analogies of space exploration, satellites, and rockets, referred to 'The Soaring Sixties' as the 'most-wisely heralded decade in modern memory.' The analysis produced an optimistic image of the United States as a powerhouse of production in which during the 1950s the 'population has grown by 25 million, or one sixth . . . television [has] become an overwhelming part of our life . . . we built new non farm housing for 12,000,000 families. . . . We increased our steel capacity by nearly 50 per cent. We began a vast new highway network, but in the meantime added over 25 million cars and trucks, or 58 per cent, to traffic congestion.'137 Constructions of a central global identity for American culture and economic production at home and abroad were primary goals in a broad range of projects. At the same time as the Soviet Exhibition in New York, and the Moscow controversy was erupting, the Museum of Modem Art, New York, was welcoming back The New American Painting from 'its triumphal tour' of eight European countries. 38 The tour had started in 1958, an important formative year for the institutionalised account of contemporary American Art, which OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 87</page><page sequence="18">Francis Frascina became enshrined within the Museum of Modern Art during the 1960s. This account was in large part the result of the activities of MoMA's International Program of Circulating Exhibitions dating from 1952. In 1958 the International Program was responsible for The New American Painting, the touring exhibition Jackson Pollock: 1912-1956 (the two exhibitions included joint showings in Basel, Berlin, and Paris, and separate showings in Rome, Amsterdam, Hamburg, and London), and the United States representation at the XXIX Biennale in Venice.139 At the United States Pavilion at the Venice Biennale there were separate galleries for the painters Rothko and Tobey and the sculptors Lippold and Smith. The premier prize for painting was awarded to Tobey (the first American artist to win the prize since Whistler in 1895). These three exhibitions marked an institutionalised consolidation of the status of the New York School and particularly Abstract Expressionism. At the same time such works not only began to soar in price on the expanding home art market but were also collected in larger numbers by museums and galleries.140 The issues represented by the 'triumph' of The New American Painting and the rough-ride over the Moscow exhibition were not straightforward. On the one hand, there was a McCarthyite and HUAC hostility to any suggestion of artists having communist links or sympathies. Here anti-communism was linked to various strategies of 'red baiting' in order to target radical or leftist ideas, individuals, or groups. On the other hand, there was an antipathy to modern and particularly abstract art. This antipathy ranged from Dondero's view that all modern art was communistic to attacks, such as those by the National Sculpture Society, on the values and competences of art that did not subscribe to criteria of resemblance and conventional subject matter. These latter views, rooted in a strong isolationist cultural agenda, were inconsistent with the needs and Cold War rhetoric of those State agencies that required images and demonstrations of freedom of expression and of selection. Further, the boom in cultural institutions dedicated to notions of Modernist progressivism and liberal experiment in art were wedded to the representation of post-war America as the guardian of values and standards previously located in Europe. Important parts of the latter were the various cultural exchange programmes. Here we can see evidence of insecurities about national identity and cultural values. There were anxieties about the United States being perceived as brash, consumerist, without deep cultural traditions, and certainly not on a par with European Enlightenment culture. Within the United States, too, a narrative about the supposed demise of Europe with the so-called 'fall of Paris' in 1939 created a double bind. The United States could be represented as 'taking command', after all the Marshall Plan confirmed its financial and industrial strengths. However, the need for positive reports and reassuring perceptions of the country from abroad were constantly on the aims and objectives of exchange programmes, cultural agencies, and false-front organisations. Put basically how could American cultural products be positively valued as distinctively novel, different from Europe, and as traceable within the valued accounts of Europe as superior elite cultures?141 Within the anti-communism of the 1940s and 1950s one of the problems at the heart of the unresolved difficulties was the relationship between notions of the 'work of art itself' and the artist's political opinions and affiliations. Various arguments about the separation of the two have produced tensions in numerous debates about autonomy and commitment throughout the twentieth century.142 In the United States they were bound within cultural insecurities about national identity, a lack of commitment to regional and ethnic diversities,143 anxieties about the communist 'other', and a massive consumerist boom. This boom fed 139. Significantly, too, the International Program, now sponsored by MoMA's International Council, was responsible for the US representation at the IV Bienal de Sao Paulo, September-December 1957, which comprised a large retrospective of Pollock's paintings and drawings and an exhibition of paintings by James Brookes, Philip Guston, Grace Hartigan, Franz Kline, and Larry Rivers, and sculptures by David Hare, Ibram Lassaw, and Seymour Lipton.

At one extreme there were Stalinist calls for artists to be 'engineers of human souls'; at the other there were capitalist interests in art objects as commodities. 143. As Poiger notes (in 'Beyond "Modernisation" and "Colonization", p. 55), it was not until 1956 that the USIA sent African- American musician Dizzy Gillespie and his band abroad to play 'jazz' as 'high' American culture with 'universal' appeal. 88 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="19">Institutions, Culture, and America's 'Cold War Years': the Making of Greenberg's 'Modernist Painting' 144.

As Kramer noted, too, it is Art and Culture (1961) which provides the book length version of such views. enormous expansion in the possibilities for elite cultural pursuits and the products of mass culture transforming the character of urban American life for many, though not all, social groups. In the Summer of 1959, Irving Howe deliberated on the dilemmas of writers seeking to find a way of responding to the last two decades in which 'there had occurred a series of changes in American life, the extent, durability and significance of which no one has yet measured . . . once familiar social categories and place-markers have become as uncertain and elusive as the moral imperatives of the nineteenth century seemed to novelists fifty years ago. 144 For Howe, grappling with something new in society meant stumbling against the signifiers of 'mass society', by which: we mean a relatively comfortable, half welfare and half garrison society in which the population grows passive, indifferent and atomized; in which traditional loyalties, ties and associations become lax or dissolve entirely; in which coherent publics based on definite interests and opinions gradually fall apart; and in which man becomes a consumer, himself mass-produced like the products, diversions and values that he absorbs.145 The dilemma was how to avoid representing American society by simply falling into the production of images of business and consumerism, an equivalent to a handbook on the new home appliances of refrigerators and TVs.146 Whilst this was a concern for the production of work about contemporary America, the interpretation of such work abroad was also an issue. For example, in July 1959, Kramer observed that for many young artists and intellectuals in Europe 'American painting of the abstract expressionist school has recently joined the curious company of jazz, blue jeans, Coca-Cola, Marilyn Monroe, and the plays of Tennessee Williams as one of the more arresting symbols of American life.'147 European fascination with these products constituted a representation of America abroad, which did not fulfil the needs of those who wished for a confirmation of the country as possessing a mature and deep culture. At the same time, at home in America, Abstract Expressionism 'is now our certified contemporary style so far as the museums, the critics, and the big investors in modern painting are concerned and inevitably its local partisans have felt vindicated by this resounding victory abroad'.148 For Kramer this was revealing of a brash insecurity. Whilst such partisans had been claiming, for at least ten years, that Europe was a 'backwater' they still required approval from the decried 'decadent' European culture 'to confer legitimacy on our native efforts'.149 Part of the ritual of conferring legitimacy was the catalogue that the Museum of Modern Art published for the return of The New American Painting to New York and enshrined within the Museum's galleries. This version of the catalogue included extracts from critical reactions to the exhibition when it toured Europe. Kramer drew attention to critics from Europe emphasising characteristics such as raw power, scale, physical vigour, and violence, all ambiguous terms reminiscent of descriptions of 'young boys' or 'noble savages'. This was at the heart of a dilemma: 'American painting could not be taken to exist on the same level as its European counterpart. Its interest as ideology was affirmed, but its achievement as art was left in abeyance.'50 Confirmation of 'its achievement as art' across the world airwaves of the Voice of America was confidently assumed in 'Modernist Painting'. Here Greenberg's references to the 'latest abstract painting' and 'the authentic art of our time' take for granted the listeners' (and readers') assumption that these are produced in America: 'Forum-The Arts and Sciences in Mid- Century America.' 15 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 89</page><page sequence="20">Francis Frascina Such confidence, though, was the public face of what had been an ideological and practical struggle evident in Dodd's anxieties in1959. Apart from writing to Nichols on 29 October to express his worries about potential interference if not censorship or cancellation, he also wrote to Donald B. Cook, Staff Director, Advisory Committee on the Arts: During the meeting the other day I realized that seven of the names that I would propose as writers for this Voice of America series were names of individuals who at this very moment are primarily concerned over this very serious problem as it relates to exhibitions that were to be formulated by institutions under sponsorship of the USIA.

Four or five would go to individuals who sat around the table with us the other afternoon. What is the answer? I do not know?152 152. Letter from Dodd to Donald B. Cook, Staff Director, Advisory Committee on the Arts, Department of State, Washington DC, (28 October 1959) in Lamar Dodd Papers (Archives of American Art [AAA] Roll 3761). 153. Letter from Dodd to Nichols, 18 November 1959. 154. Tuchman quoted in Rubenfeld, Clement Greenberg: A Life, p. 235. One result of these problems and the lack of confidence in State sponsorship, particularly that by the USIA, was a postponement in the opening date for the Forum Series. In his letter to Nichols dated 18 November 1959, Dodd welcomed the postponement because of the negative effects of recent events, citing the example of Andrew Ritchie and the USIA's cancellation of the exhibition he had organised for the Agency.153 This is the letter in which Dodd discussed Goodrich's suggestion of including an artist in the series, naming Davis, Shahn, Roszak, or Tobey as possibilities. These suggestions constitute a testing of possibilities, unconsciously playful, in light of the recent controversies about American identity as represented by exhibitions. Reading 'Modernist Painting' .. .politically The evidence of Greenberg's career suggests he was wary of the dangers of institutionalisation that often result from being in long-term salaried employment with a gallery, museum, or university. His work on journals and on short-term teaching contracts, for example, maintained the illusion, at least, of creative and critical freedom. One person he had in mind as a prime example of institutional exploitation was Alfred Barr who had a mixed experience at MoMA. Barr's messianic zeal had established the cultural reputation of the Museum in the 1930s but increasing friction with the Trustees resulted in Barr being sacked as Director of the Museum and Curator of Painting and Sculpture in November 1943. Although he stayed at MoMA, Barr's role underwent a series of changes throughout the next three decades. Maurice Tuchman recalled that Greenberg tried to discourage him from taking up the curatorial post at the newly-opened Los Angeles County Art Museum in 1964: 'He said you give all you can to an institution, and they just throw you away like tissue paper. He had very much in mind the experience of Alfred Barr at MoMA, where they did almost exactly that, and Clem was indignant. '154 Greenberg also advised William Rubin against increased institutional connections, particularly at the Museum of Modern Art. Rubin, though, regarded himself as Barr's chosen successor and greatly expanded MoMA's collection of recent American art during the 1960s and 1970s. One possible reason for Greenberg's attitude was the role of MoMA as the most powerful institutionalised taste-maker in elite culture; another was that it represented the inescapable process of the official legitimisation of the art he most revered as avant-garde. As early as 1949, Greenberg was highly critical of MoMA's lack of support of young American abstract artists in a review of American 90 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="21">Institutions, Culture, and America's 'Cold War Years': the Making of Greenberg's 'Modernist Painting' 155.

Paintings from the Collection of the Museum of Modern Art.'55 There is further evidence of his negative views of the Museum in his 'New York Painting Only Yesterday' (1957), which he retitled 'The Late Thirties in New York' in Art and Culture. In both versions he characterised MoMA as bridging a gap between the avant-garde community in downtown Manhattan and the art world of uptown galleries with their badges of prosperity. But, for Greenberg, MoMA still belonged more to the establishment than it did to the avant-garde. It was a place to learn about European art, such as that by Picasso and Matisse, but it was not a place to 'feel at home'. By the latter he must have meant his immediate community and the American Abstract Artists group, whose annual exhibition was for him the big event during the 1930s. Greenberg writes about Barr, inserting a barbed parenthesis in the Art and Culture version of the essay: Alfred Barr (that inveterate champion of minor art) was betting on a return to nature in those years, and a request of the American Abstract Artists to hold one of their annuals in the museum was turned down with the intimation that they were following what had become a blind alley.156 Such views, including the inserted parenthesis, did not endear Greenberg to those at MoMA, especially friends of Barr, during the 1960s. More significantly they indicate his critical distance not only from the institution but also from its lack of response to what he regarded as the main examples of avant-garde painting. For him the avant-garde meant abstract art. By 1960 it meant Abstract Expressionism and a particular painterly legacy, which had to be defended against a double-edged institutionalisation. The exhibition of The New American Painting at MoMA and the publicity over American Painting and Sculpture in Moscow during the Summer of 1959 represented two instances of the co-option of culture as forms of prized innocence by the institutions of developed capitalism. The relationship between institutions and cultural independence had been a fundamental concern of Greenberg's since at least 'Avant-Garde and Kitsch' (1939), in which he famously stressed that no culture can develop without a source of stable income; with 'the case of the avant-garde this was provided by an elite among the ruling class of a society from which it assumed itself to be cut off, but to which it has always remained attached by an umbilical cord of gold. The paradox is real.""57 Greenberg was living his own paradox with the VOA broadcast. It might be argued, too, that he was engaged in a fulfilment of the claim made toward the end of 'Avant-Garde and Kitsch': 'Capitalism in decline finds that whatever of quality it is still capable of producing becomes almost invariably a threat to its own existence.'l58 Greenberg writing at the end of the 1930s regarded capitalism as inescapably entwined with the culture industries of Fascism and of Fordist America. Twenty years later, the United States was a reinvigorated site of commodity production and capitalism's institutionalised guardians found much that they perceived as a threat to its own existence. Greenberg's final words in 'Avant-Garde and Kitsch' are about faith in a 'culture' as an independent and radical counter to the pervasiveness of institutionalisation: Here, as in every other question today, it becomes necessary to quote Marx word for word. Today we no longer look towards socialism for a new culture-as inevitably as one will appear, once we do have socialism. Today we look to socialism simply for the preservation of whatever culture we have right now.'59 By the late 1950s, references to 'socialism' were buried deep if not expunged OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 91</page><page sequence="22">Francis Frascina from Greenberg's texts and replaced by particular beliefs in the politics of autonomous art. As we have seen, this was a shift he acknowledged in 1960 and which was recognised by Kramer in 1962. In 1961 Greenberg declared that 'Modernism' constitutes and by implication preserves 'what is truly alive in our culture'160 (my emphasis) to the millions across the world listening to the Voice of America. The certainty of cultural identity, of the most authentic version of 'Western civilisation', as residing within the United States was confidently announced to the listeners from differing cultures. 'Modernist' painting thus meant American painting. Modernism, he claimed, is 'more than art and literature' and is essentially characterised by a 'self-critical tendency', which entrenches a discipline 'more firmly in its area of competence'. Here we have Greenberg evoking the issue of 'tendency', which had long been associated with politics and political art, most notably with Marxism and socialism. As we have seen, by the 1950s Greenberg had become an anti- communist not least because he saw communism as dominated by a tendency that was not self-critical and which had forced art and literature to be criticised and altered by outside agendas. But, equally, organisations and institutions in the United States, such as the ACCF, the USIA, and the State Department had their agendas; those of a ruling elite, backed up by overt and covert funding. 16 With 'Modernist Painting' Greenberg was attached to this elite by an umbilical cord of gold. He was literally attached by the $250 dollar fee and metaphorically by the voice of American cultural certainty, sounding out from radio receivers world-wide. With the 'Forum' series the VOA had brilliantly co-opted the moral support and the personal voices of non-governmental Americans to a greater extent than before. Greenberg argued a case for the autonomy of art, which appeared to be the antithesis of the USIA's and the State Department's emphases on artists' political beliefs. However, his arguments were consistent with their aims to co-opt intellectuals in propagating a particular image of the United States. Greenberg, like Goodrich, Barr, and other liberal defenders of Modernist art, prioritised claims for the transcendent aesthetic value of the work of art rather than the historical position of the artist as producer. Their views are indicative of a general and a specific phenomenon. Generally, they can be located as part of what Max Weber identified as the production of cultural replacements for the absence of religious belief under capitalism. Specifically, their views were a strategic defence of high culture against philistinism and political prejudice in the 1940s and 1950s. Their defence of Modernist art, and the institutional sites of the Museum and the Journal, seemed possible and necessary because the actions of individuals, scrutinised by Congressional committees and Government agencies, were difficult to defend. Greenberg even used an anthropomorphic view of art objects, as though they had autonomous agency and were capable of action and decisions, to disavow the possibility of the politicised artist. For example, he claimed that 'Each art had to determine, through its own operations and works, the effects exclusive to itself. By doing so it would, to be sure, narrow its area of competence, but at the same time it would make its possession of that area all the more certain.' 62 Such rhetoric had at least three effects. It created an illusion of a self-critical process, a supposed infra-logic of Modernist art, by which the artist 'speaks' irrespective of his or her social or political agency. Second, Modernist art and culture were characterised as insulated from the sort of questioning of artists and writers by, for example, HUAC. Third, it created a metaphor at best of protective specialisation, at worst of cleansing imperialism, echoed again in the next paragraph: 'The task of self-criticism became to eliminate from the specific 160.

Further, Greenberg's critiques of 'sculpture' and the 'sculptural' have particular contemporary references. He was insistent that there is one fundamental characteristic to the 'processes by which pictorial art criticized and defended itself under Modernism'. This was the 'stressing of the ineluctable flatness of the surface'. The word 'ineluctable' has a politicised disciplinary zeal: not to be avoided, changed, or resisted. During the 1950s one of the most conservative elements in attacks on abstract art and modernism in general was the National Sculpture Society. In 1959, as we have seen, a prime witnesses at the HUAC Hearings on the Moscow Exhibition was Wheeler Williams, sculptor and former President of the National Sculpture Society. Apart from critiques of the claimed communist affiliations of artists, the other main strand of attack was against abstract works as 'meaningless abstractions' including Pollock's Cathedral (1947), described by Williams as a 'meaningless scribble . . . it is not a work of art. It is merely a childish doodle'.164 For Greenberg, Pollock's Cathedral was an example of how the development of 'Modernist' painting by an American had gone beyond the lessons of Cubism in the work of Picasso and Braque. In 1948, paintings such as those by Pollock provided Greenberg with evidence of the migration of the main premises of Western art to the United States along with the centre of gravity of industrial production and political power.'65 Importantly, for him the combination of aesthetic and political power confirmed a sense of America as providing the social bases for a flourishing avant-garde culture. A decade later, reports of the Moscow show and the reception of American art echoed these convictions. When it opened in Moscow, on 24 July 1959, the exhibition attracted thousands of visitors. Edith Halpert who curated the show on behalf of the four members of the selection committee provided a report for The New York Times. She observed that two of the most popular works were Andrew Wyeth's Children's Doctor (1949) and Paul Blume's The Eternal City (1937), and that the 'attitude to the Pollock alternates between great interest and anger, but the painting is consistently looked at'.166 Halpert noted that Moscow visitors have inquired how American artists can represent their 'homeland' so differently as Edward Hopper's Lighthouse at Two Lights (1929) and Stuart Davis' Combination Concrete Number 2 (1958). For her, such questions were evidence of the 'brilliant' selection 'demonstrating so effectively the freedom of individual expression'. 67 Halpert concluded by emphasising the 'powerful effect' of this exhibition of American art, which will continue to exert 'an influence, both aesthetically and politically'. Additionally, it has proved in part that 'our civilization is not entirely materialistic but that culture has an important place'.168 In the same month, August 1959, Greenberg published 'The Case for Abstract Art' in The Saturday Evening Post. Here he cited Pollock as the latest target of those for whom the disintegration and disappearance of recognisable images in painting and sculpture supposedly reflect a disintegration of values in society. For him, the fact that Pollock is in a long line of targets (the Impressionists, van Gogh and Cezanne, Matisse, Cubism and Picasso, Mondrian) shows, in a backhanded way, the current importance of American art. This importance, he argued, is closely aligned to the need for disinterested OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 93</page><page sequence="24">Francis Frascina contemplation particularly in American life dominated by mental energy devoted to the production of material things and services. For Greenberg, abstract painting was the major painting of the age and its special, unique cultural value lay in the disinterested contemplation (or 'detached contemplativeness') required for its appreciation. Abstract painting teaches, amidst materialistic needs, the value of what 'can be made without being invested with ulterior meanings.'169 In such arguments, Greenberg shared some common ground with Schapiro's analysis of Abstract Expressionism, in 'The Liberating Quality of Avant-Garde Art' (1957), as an implicit critique of capitalism's emphasis on automated production and mass consumer culture.170 Arguments about the radicalism and politics of abstract art transgressed institutional sites. Twenty years after the American Abstract Artists association demonstrated outside MoMA, claiming that the Museum had neglected the work of abstract art in the United States, a second protest occurred. On 24 April 1960 a large group of artists picketed MoMA to protest against what they regarded as the Museum's policy of privileging abstract art and failing to forge contact with 'younger realists'. 17 The Whitney Museum of American Art received a letter from twenty-two artists on a similar topic.172 In May, Barr drafted a letter to The New York Herald Tribune in reply to Emily Genauer's review of MoMA's exhibition Portraitsfrom the Museum Collection of 4 May 1960.173 Barr quoted her description of MoMA as 'the museum from whose walls the human image has virtually disappeared'.174 Barr also wrote to Genauer directly about her piece and the picketing of the Museum, which she had mentioned in her review. Barr admitted to a 'kind of minor paranoia' about what he regarded as a 'frequent overlooking of the Museum's collections' and attempted to provide evidence to counter the claims of the pickets and Genauer's view about the disappearance of the 'human image' from the Museum. One of his major points was that the 1959-60 season began with three 'more or less avant-garde shows.'175 Two of them were The New American Painting and 16 Americans, selected by Dorothy Miller, both of which 'were certainly overwhelmingly abstract.' However, Barr argued, the exhibition in between these two was different. New Images of Man, organised by Peter Selz, had been planned in 1958 'as a presentation of work generally outside the abstract expressionist movement and partially in reaction against it.'176 Barr continued by stressing that the 'majority of painters in the New Images show were Americans (some of whom, incidentally, had been selected by Dorothy Miller for 16 Americans but were surrendered to New Images.)'177 The use of 'surrendered' here is striking; so too is Barr's need to emphasise that Americans were in the majority when that was only just true. Out of the twenty-three artists in the exhibition, thirteen were 'American' with four of these 'Americans' born outside of the United States: Willem de Kooning in Holland; Rico Lebrun in Italy; Jan Muller in Germany; and Theodore Roszak in Poland. Of the other ten artists, four were from Britain, three from France, and one each from Austria, Holland, and Switzerland. Clearly, for Barr there were tense relationships between notions of the avant-garde, national identity, abstraction, realism/imagery, and the role of MoMA as an institution. One of the sub-texts to these relationships can be gleaned from William Rubin's highly critical review of New Images of Man, in which he claimed that 'the inherent affinity between sculpture and the human figure' meant that the 'sculptors came off less poorly than the painters.' Rubin immediately listed what he regarded as the 'inherent bad taste' of the painters. Their weaknesses included 'a taste for phoney archaism; heavy handed figural representation . . . clumsiness of expression; Dachau in one form or another is 169.

Selz also cited authors central to Existentialism and used phrases indebted to Sartre to characterise the concerns of 'these imagists' as well as 'the more abstract artists of the period': they take 'the human situation, indeed the human predicament rather than formal structure, as their starting point. Existence rather than essence is of the greatest concern to them' (p. 11). All of this would have been anathema to the politics of Rubin's Greenbergian Modernism. 180.

Rubin seemed to have had in mind Rico Lebrun's large Study for Dachau Chamber (1958).179 He also singled out the work of Leon Golub for particular criticism, though none of the titles of his five works explicitly reference Nazi death camps. Golub's statement, though, made reference to the various ways in which his paintings could be viewed, including: 'Man is seen as having undergone a holocaust or facing annihilation or mutation', and as attempts 'to reinstate a contemporary catharsis, that measure of man which is related to an existential knowledge of the human condition-a recognition that looks back to the symbolic incarnation of classic art'. 80 An exception to Rubin's critique, warranting a long footnote, was Pollock's paintings, which he argued had been misplaced in this exhibition.181 However, a comparison of Lebrun's Studyfor Dachau Chamber (1958) and Pollock's No. 6 (1952)182 reveals that both are indebted to similar conventions of abstraction, and lends support to the argument that Rubin's distinctions were ideological. He concluded by suggesting that the forthcoming 16 Americans to include 'imagists' such as Rauschenberg, Johns, and Stankiewicz who 'are superior to the New Imagists of Man' may give 'a better sense of the viability of figurative painting in 1959'.183 Such attacks on representational art, on the relationship between the 'sculptural', imagery, and the human figure, and on that which is invested with 'ulterior meanings' were, as Greenberg's 'The Case for Abstract Art' made clear, about the values of culture and of material production. The claims for 'disinterested contemplation', the autonomy of the art object, and removal of politicised subject matter (Rubin's reference to Dachau) were implicit retorts to those hostile to one version of Modernism and to those for whom social realism or political critique were still possible. In November 1959 Rubin published 'Notes on Masson and Pollock' in Arts, edited by Hilton Kramer, arguing for a particular European lineage for Pollock's work. The same issue of Arts, included a long letter from Rubin published in response to a review, a month earlier, by Lionel Abel of Arnold Hauser's book The Philosophy of Art History. Hauser had earlier published his well-known The Social History of Art, indebted to the Marxist tradition. Rubin made a particular distinction between 'realism', which he associated with a 'Russian insistence', and 'abstract painting'. In so doing he made a claim about audiences and readership: realism can be used to advantage in a totalitarian situation as a propaganda arm of the state. It is a style in which everyone can get the message. The high arts of most periods have tended away from realism, and have, therefore, been appreciated as art only by a minority of the population. The crowd paid more homage to the Madonna in Majesty than Duccio's excellence as a painter.184 In the context of 1959, the 'Moscow controversy', subpoenas served on Ben Shahn and Philip Evergood to appear before the House Committee on Un- American Activities, and Abel's review of Hauser, a Marxist art historian, Rubins' critique of realism does more than just echo Greenberg's arguments from 'Avant-Garde and Kitsch' (1939). Rubin continued: The outstanding qualities of abstract art seem to me its sense of freedom, its individuality and imaginativeness. While these may not be directly political, they come close to being 'overtones'.185 Much of course, hangs, on the meaning of 'political' in this claim. OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003 95</page><page sequence="26">Francis Frascina In 'Modernist Painting', Greenberg attempted to locate contemporary American abstraction within a particular reading of the traditions of Western painting. He did so to entrench it more firmly in an area of European competence, whilst establishing its American difference. European approval, through historical sources, was thus established and the sophisticated depth of American culture seemingly confirmed. Significantly, he employed 'flatness' and the 'sculptural' as politicised metaphors. As I have argued, the 'sculptural' was a metaphor for both anti-modernist attacks of the 1950s and for the explicitly political, whether of the right or the left. For Greenberg, the positive value of 'Modernist' painting is 'its resistance to the sculptural'. 'Resistance' is, as in his use of 'ineluctable flatness', the rhetoric of opposition embedded in cultural form. The word 'resistance,' which evoked an organised underground movement fighting occupation forces, was especially associated with France during World War Two. However, characteristics of sabotage, secret operations, and the punishment of collaborators within the 'resistance' had other meanings in the Cold War years of HUAC and CIA operations. This is particularly relevant given, for example, the importance accorded to Picasso's work within the various accounts of artistic Modernism in contrast to the suspicious and negative views of his commitment to the PCF. Paintings by artists such as Picasso and Leger and the writings of Eluard and Sartre are inseparable from notions of commitment and the politics of the PCF. Furthermore, Greenberg cited as one of his historical sources the work of David, whose political paintings produced during the period of the French Revolution of 1789 were celebrated again in French culture after 1945. The large exhibition of David's work in Paris in 1948 to mark his bicentenary, contributed to the passionate and committed debates and struggles between 'Realism and Abstraction' in France.186 Leger's Les Loisirs: Hommage a Louis David (1948-49) combined references to the pre-war Popular Front's leisure programmes for workers and David's status as a revolutionary Republican painter. This was not the reading of David that Greenberg evoked. He argued that one of the pre-Modernist examples of the 'resistance to the sculptural' was 'carried on at first in the name of color'. He continued: 186. See my 'The Politics of Representation', Chapter 2 in Paul Wood, Francis Frascina, Jonathan Harris, and Charles Harrison, Modernism in Dispute: Art Since the Forties (Yale University Press: New Haven and London, 1993), especially pp. 128-42, and Serge Guilbaut, 'Postwar Painting Games: the Rough and the Slick', in Guilbaut (ed.), Reconstructing Modernism: Art in New York, Paris and Montreal (MIT Press: Cambridge, MA, and London, 1990), pp. 30-84. 187. 'Modernist Painting', p. 3. 188. 'Modernist Painting', p. 3. When David, in the 18th century, tried to revive sculptural painting, it was, in part, to save pictorial art from the decorative flattening-out that the emphasis on color seemed to induce. Yet the strength of David's own best pictures, which are predominantly his informal ones, lies as much in their color as in anything else.187 Greenberg relegated the status of David's politicised history paintings so as to construct a dichotomy of 'flatness' and 'sculptural' and a narrative of development from David to Ingres to Manet and the Impressionists; 'Thus, by the middle of the 19th century, all ambitious tendencies in painting had converged amid their differences, in an anti-sculptural direction.'188 In 1939 Greenberg claimed that it was too difficult to inject effective propaganda into avant-garde art. Then, he was thinking of the use of visual culture by Fascists and Stalinists for whom representational art, mass culture, and kitsch were more pliable. In 1959 and 1960 the politics of cultural arguments were, for him, dominated by visual culture within the capitalist consumerism and Cold War political interests of a particular image of America. That image of America had been orchestrated abroad by instruments such as the official Marshall Plan, economically and politically. Equally the image was negotiated through the unofficial processes of programmes, committees, and agencies, which can be described as a Marshall Plan of culture and ideas. In one case study of the latter, Greenberg engaged in an implicit 96 OXFORD ART JOURNAL 26.1 2003</page><page sequence="27">Institutions, Culture, and America's 'Cold War Years': the Making of Greenberg's 'Modernist Painting' 189. Whilst Greenberg's arguments may have some residue of Marx's distinctions between productive and unproductive labour, his view of culture is exclusive on the grounds of financial income and social choice. Who has the leisure for the appreciation he claims? His arguments are also exclusive in their euro-centric assumptions and language in which there is no recognition of African American or Native American traditions. Arguably, too, his broadcast and the Forum series were pronouncements from the centre of the dominant post-war Empire. critique of what he regarded as the distasteful preoccupation in America with the mental intensity of materialistic production. However, in arguing for the enjoyment of paintings as ends in themselves, for their own sake, and as 'other' to the politicised signifiers of Europe, Greenberg produced for the VOA an account of 'Modernist Painting' consistent with streamlined production processes, themselves based on self-criticism in pursuit of the pleasure of profit.'89 Whilst to a large extent this account was designed for the radio listening world, it was also an intervention into the politics of domestic culture. By 1959 and 1960 confidence in a legitimated American culture, sent abroad and returned in 'triumph', confirmed a sense of the possibilities of a particular Modernist renaissance at home; one that was to enjoy an ideological dominance in institutions during the following decade.
