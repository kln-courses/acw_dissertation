<plain_text><page sequence="1">Asiatic Art Pendant with anthropomorphic profile China, Neolithic period, Hongshan Culture type, late 4th - early 3rd millennium B.C.; pale green nephrite with carved details and perforation; h. 2% in. (6.9 cm), I. 2% in. (6.9 cm) Keith McLeod Fund. 1992.528. This unusual pendant is made from semitranslu- cent nephrite with a warm, yellowish green hue. The jade craftsman applied great effort to create a uniformly smooth and highly polished surface with a sharp-edged circumference. Both faces are delicately engraved, allowing the pendant to be viewed from either side when hung from the perforation. This feature of the design, com- bined with the tactile surfaces, indicates that it may have been worn informally as personal jew- elry rather than in a ritual context. Perhaps the craftsman was representing a monkey hanging by its tail. No matter how the shape is inter- preted, however, there is no doubt that this pen- dant is testimony to the craftsman's technical skill and conceptual ability in creating a compli- cated figurative work from jade, a highly unmal- leable material. P.F. 20</page><page sequence="2">&lt; Coffer Sri Lanka, late 16th century; ivory, gold, glass, rubies, turquoise, and gilt bronze; h. 45/e in. (1 1 cm), w. 6 in. (15.3 cm), d. 4 in. (10.2 cm) Bequest of William A. Coolidge. 1 993.29. This exquisite gambrel-lidded coffer is con- structed of interlocking ivory panels held to- gether by a gold framework, inset with glass and precious stones. Fluidly carved into the ivory are images of real and mythical people and animals intertwined with delicate spiraling lotus vines. End pieces carry dancers and a goddess, their oval faces and thinly striated draperies typifying sixteenth- and seventeenth-century Sinhalese carving. A number of coffers were made in Sri Lanka between the sixteenth and eighteenth century, often for export to Europe. Two of the earliest, which are datable to about 1 540, appear to have been made at the Sinhalese court at Kotte (Jayavaddhanapura) in southwestern Sri Lanka and sent to Lisbon with emissaries. The high quality of the carving on this piece together with the use of gold and architectural motifs for the framework link it with these early coffers and with the Kotte workshop. D.M. &lt; Buddhist cinerary urn with cover Korea, Unified Silla period, 9th century; stoneware with perforated projections and stamped and combed patterns; h. 12 % in. (30.5 cm), diam. 12 % in. (30.5 cm) Edward Sylvester Morse Fund. 1992.476. This large cinerary urn was made for containing the remains of a Buddhist priest, a practice intro- duced into Korea with the advent of Buddhism in the sixth century. This type of urn is often found inside a stone casket. Cords were proba- bly strung through the perforations to secure safely the already close-fitting cover to its body. The exterior surface of the cover and urn is richly decorated with firmly stamped motifs of floral medallions, flower garlands, fern leaves, and clouds, and an agitated, combed V-shaped motif, repeated over the surface of the urn. These highly stylized, decorative techniques are consistent with designs on cinerary urns exca- vated from Kyongju in the southeastern coastal area of Korea, a historical center for Buddhism. The robust shape and thick, sturdy walls, the prominent foot ring, the spacing of the projec- tions, the proportions of the body and cover - all are features that closely correspond with ex- amples from Kyongju. P.F. Their Mother, Overcome with Anguish . . . Illustration from the book The Tale of the Soga Brothers Japan, Edo period, 18th century; ink, color, gold and silver on paper; 9^ x 6% in. (23.2 x 16.8 cm) Keith McLeod Fund. 1992.477 The Tale of the Soga Brothers, one of Japan's most beloved historical narratives, extols the commitment of two brothers in the twelfth cen- tury to avenge their father's death. This delicate painting, one of four recently acquired by the Museum from a multivolume set, illustrates a passage in which their mother cries in anguish, "If a baby still in the womb can understand its mother's words, how much more so should you boys, being five and three When you be- come fifteen and thirteen years old, slay your father's enemy and show his head to me." Exquisitely executed in Tosa-school style, fa- vored by the imperial court, the painting em- ploys the traditional conventions of a bird's-eye perspective, "blown-away rooftops," and "hook-noses and slit-eyes." The balance of the areas of saturated color with the fine patterns of the textiles and the treatment of the landscape indicate a date for this work in the early eigh- teenth century.
