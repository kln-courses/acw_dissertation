THE Greek striking soil have discoveries thrown made more during light on the the last earliest eight period years on of Greek soil have thrown more light on the earliest period of Greek sculpture than on any other : but their proper value, and the exact contribution they make to our knowledge of that period, have yet to be estimated. The chief object of this paper is to show how, in the presence of the recently acquired facts, the question as to the origin of the statue in Hellenic art stands on an altered footing, and we are no longer left to caprice or prejudice for choosing between an Egyptian, Assyrian, or native origin. The conclusion to which the new evidence leads us is that the free statue was a native Greek development, slowly evolved from the earlier Aniconic object. At the outset it is well to note what were the elements in pari materia , among which we can look for the germ of the statue. Abundant record of the aniconic age of Greek religion is supplied us by ancient writers,1 and the passages have been sufficiently col- lected by Botticher in his Baumcultus,2 and by Overbeck,3 who criticises his theory ; some of these only it is enough for the pre- sent purpose to quote here. Pausanias (2. 9. 6) speaks of an Artemis Patroa klovl eLKao-pévr] and of Apollo 'AyvLevs represented as a kl(j)v K(x)vo€L8rjs ; (9. 24. 3) an ayaXfxa of Heracles XíOov dpyôv ; (2. 27. 1) o£ the most ancient Eros at Thespiae, a XlOos àpyós. We are told also by Clemens Alexandrinus that the earliest emblem or ayakpa of Hera at Samos was a o-avis or wooden board, replaced in later times by the anthropomorphic image.4 We can gather from the fragment of the Phoronis, mentioned by Clemens,5 that the ancient emblem of Hera at Argos was a kluv paKpos, and from a passage 1 See especially Dio Chrysostom, 406, 2 : and Arnobius vi., 11. 2 Vide chapter, entitled Umriss des Hellenischen Baumcultus, and pages 16, 40, 104, 38, 39, 215-217. 3 Overbeck, Berichte der Sächsischcn Gesellschaft d. Wissenschaften , 1864, p. 15, etc. 4 Protreptica, p. 40. 5 ibid., p. 418.</page><page sequence="2">168 ARCHEOLOGY. from the " Europeia " of Eumelos,6 that the same emblem was pos- sibly used for Apollo at Delphi. We hear also at Sparta of two stocks of wood joined together by a cross-piece to represent the twin-brethren, of a three-cornered pillar at Cyzicum representing Athena, and of a pillar at Thebes which symbolised Dionysos. Moreover, Bötticher has collected much evidence - and in this lies the chief merit of his book- showing how many of the rites and forms of this aniconic age are derived from tree-worship, a worship which explains such titles as Zeus '¿vevSpos, and such legends as that of Daphne and Helene AevSpîns. With the special stages of progress that he finds within this period we are not concerned : what is interesting to note in his whole theory is his thesis, that the later anthropomorphic image of the divinity is gradually de- veloped from the tree, and that the connecting link was given when the tree or stock began to be decorated with anthropomorphic attributes. This theory of development in which the free statue is evolved from a kind of wooden Herme is opposed strenuously by Overbeck in the above-mentioned periodical, and by Feuerbach. It is convenient to take the classification which Overbeck gives of the earliest objects of Hellenic cult, according to the following scheme. !tt a. 7 wT Unwr rougi ought ļ i ,, o ļ» jec objects , s , ļ ļ S $ stones polished stones, | e.g., or wrought the ojxcpaXos trees k'kùv aavls, or Kcavoeihns. delubro, I stocks. a.

The full human statue. He maintains then that c and d are both effects of the same tendency, and that c is not the embryo of d - also thať there is no development necessary to suppose of B from A: the impulse towards the iconic object breaks away altogether from the tradition of the past. On the whole this is also the view of Anselm Feuerbach, as expressed in his Nachgelassene Schriften : " the Herme has nothing in common with the stocks and stones ; the leap from these to the Herme with the human head is as great as to the full and human image of the God," that is, the gulf between the aniconic and the iconic period cannot be bridged over : the Herme or something midway between the pillar and the statue cannot form such a link, because when men once could carve the head they had plastic power over the whole body and might as well have carved it. What they might have done we do not know, but we have reason for conclud- ing that as a matter of fact they did compromise between the forms 6 Protreptica, p. 349.</page><page sequence="3">GREEK SCULPTURE. 169 of the pillar and the fully anthropomorphic figure, although Over- beck's theory appears to be still a point of orthodoxy. Before reviewing the archaeological evidence that has been acquired, it may be shown that against Overbeck's position are, (1) certain ancient records, (2) much à priori argument. We are informed by Pausanias concerning the Amyclaean Apollo, whose throne was wrought by Bathycles of Magnesia, that the statue itself was not by Bathycles, but in his opinion, much older than his date - apyaiov k&lt;xi ov &lt;rvv Texvy ireTroirjfievov ; 0TL yàp pxj Trp6o-(û7rov auTcj Kai 7róSe5 cwrtv a/cpot Kat X€ipe&lt;s,Tb 'ol7tov xcl'kĢ kloví i (ttlv etKatr/xévov 6 xci Sc a€7T6 rr¡ K€&lt;f&gt;a'.r¡ Kpávos, X.óy'7¡v 8è iv ra tç X6/30"* Ka^ T°£°v. We have here then a work which may go back to the seventh century in which the human form was only indicated at the two extremities of a pillar. Again, Pausanias (1. 27, 1.) records a Hermes carved of wood and half covered with leaves, and an image of Aphrodite (5. 13, 7.) 7TC7TO L7jp,€vov €K 1jLvp&lt;rívrj&lt;s redrjkví as. We can thus understand the striking statement of Themistius, Tipo rov AaiSákov rerpayuvos r¡v ov fióvov rj Twv 'E pļiiūv epyacría aÀÀà Kal 6 rwv Xonrtjv avÔ/otávrwv : 7 and we may find some truth in Tzetzes' antiquarianism,8 who says that the sculptors before Daedalus carved figures without feet, hands or eyes, that is, that the ¿kúv was not far removed from the form of the pillar. The first half-conscious impulse towards quickening the old lifeless form is quaintly shown in the Dioscurťs twin blocks at Sparta : the fetish-object is no longer of purely meaningless shape» but is wrought in some way to suggest the nature of the divinity that dwelt within it. Something may be said also concerning the à priori probability. Both the aniconic objects and the earliest iconic had the same re- ligious function and significance. The view as regards the former - so far as the ancient records are sufficient guide - is more advanced than the view of primitive fetishism. The sacred kíovcs, o-avíSts, and XlOol apyoí were rarely or never revered by the Greek in recorded times as objects of independent efficacy, of nameless divine power, producing, if properly dealt with, miraculous effects. This may well have been their aboriginal character9 - but they have been adopted by the higher polytheism, and the omphalos at Delphi be- •comes the stone of Hestia, while another sacred stone is holy because it was the stone that Kronos swallowed : and the XIOol apyoí 7 Orationes, 15., p. 316, a. 8 Chil. 1., 537. 0 The danger of concluding from certain signs to a stone-worship pure and simple has been clearly noted by de la Saussaye, Lehrbuch der Beligions-geschichte , p. 62, but vide Paus. vii. 22, and Theophr. Charact. 18, ir ep' òeio-iòaLpovías.</page><page sequence="4">170 ARCHEOLOGI. of Pausanias' narrative are all appropriated by some defined divinity. Of this divinity they were in most cases regarded pro- bably as the eSos : for though, unfortunately, the legends and other records that might explain the character of the sacred stones and stocks are vague and scanty, yet the significance of such divine epithets as "cvScvS/jo s, Kapvans , ^yovatos, and the legend of Artemis* hare and the myrtle tree seems clear. Again, generally speaking, these aniconic objects seem to have little or no influence to the worship of the heroic ancestor, or to the commemoration of the dead, still less of the living,10 so that if Greek idolatry in the proper sense of the term takes its origin from these it by no means follows - as has been maintained - that ancestor- worship is the ground from which the worship of idols, in this case at least, has grown. In fact, we have no proof that the cultus of the dead was so rife in this early period as it came to be in the 6th and 5th century B.C. On the other hand the record is equally conclusive concerning the earliest iconic objects. From all that we are told and can infer we can maintain without hazard that these are representations of divinities : including under this group, of course, such figures as Phoebe and Hilaeira the daughters of Apollo worshipped at Sparta and honoured with ancient dydXfiara}1 It is also possible that some few of the figures of the earliest sculpture belonged to the cycle of heroes and Saí/xoves ; but where the cult of these is recorded and mention made of the statues, the latter are certainly not of the most ancient ; there was a worship and perhaps an ancient statue of Lycurgus at Sparta, but we cannot say how ancient, and of the monument at Schiste of Laius we know neither the date nor the form. But did more of these statues exist than are chronicled, they will also naturally fall under the head of the divine. On the whole therefore the subjects of the earliest iconic and the pre-iconic period are the same. But also the relation of the idol to the divinity is partially the- same as that of the klíüv o- avis or àpybs kídos: of course a new element has been added, the divine likeness in whole or part, while it is very- unlikely that even the most backward Greek supposed the stone or the board to be the real form of his divinity ; but lie supposed it to be the é'Sos in which divinity dwelt or the re/xevos about which it lurked. On the other side, while no passage that I have been able 10 The sacred plane-tree of the house of Pelops, and the spear of Agamemnon Paus, 9. 40. 6, worshipped at Delphi, do not tell against this rule. 11 Pausanias, 3, 16, 1.</page><page sequence="5">GREEK SCULPTURE. 1 7 1 to find establishes the exact identity of the deity and the image in ancient belief, some certainly come very near it, and show the statue to be in the most intimate sense the é'Soç. The statue of Hera turned aside when the blood of the Sybarites was shed at her altar (Athenaeus 12, p. 521), and the Palladion was no less sym- pathetic, when the suppliants of Siris were dragged away to slaughter from its feet (if it had feet) and the Goddess closed her eyes."12 (Strabo, p. 264.) The practice, of which we have a few notices, of chaining statues to prevent them going away from their votaries- illustrates the same conception. We may believe then that the more philosophic view of the idol, as expressed for instance by Lucian (Imag. 23), that it is merely a symbol bringing home to the senses the idea of an invisible and remote divinity was by no mean&amp; the original, probably never the popular, view.13 Therefore as the A íOos dpyós or feo-ró? and the clkwv referred to the same personage and were regarded partially at least under the same aspect, it seems à priori probable that the primitive dyakpaToiroió* did not exclude from his mind, when he began his idol, the form of the saored pillar; rather that he took the latter as his point d'appui and timidly and reverentially allowed the face and extremities of the divinity that housed within to look forth. And the probability of this view of the first iconic process grows when one reflects how easy it was ; for, as de la Saussaye (p. 53) observes, the boundary- line between fetish (i.e., the aniconic object) and idol is hard to fix precisely, and a slight cut in the surface of the stone or a stroke of colour converts the former into the latter. If merely the head was at first added, of all the human members, then the later statue is a development from the primitive Herme ; or we may suppose that head, feet and hands were given as soon as ever the pillar began to assume iconic form; but this is a matter of indifference, for in either case the statue would be developed out of the aniconic object of cult. As a last argument for the à priori probability of this theory may be mentioned an interesting passage in Pausanias' description of Arcadia, which mentions an ayaXpa Ttrpdyuvov of Zeùs TcActos and the Curious fact Trepurcrws 8rj TL raí ar'rjfiaTi. tovtw &lt;1&gt;aivovTai fioi yaiptiv ol "Ap/cáScç. Pausanias may mean that the Herme pure was the favourite form of the Arcadians or the foursquare columnar and inorganic body with human extremities attached. Now as we have 12 The legend is possibly an setiological legend to explain the 3/z/zara p€1ivK¿Ta of the archaic image. 13 Vide a passage in de la Saussaye's Lehrbuch, p. 54, for the less advanced people " ist das Wesen und die Kraft des Abgebildeten im Bilde anwesend."</page><page sequence="6">172 ARCHJEOLOGY. other indications of the primitive character of the Arcadian cult, we may be allowed to explain this attachment of theirs to the c rx*}/*a Ttrpdywvov as an attachment to the most primitive form of idolatry. Turning from à priori reasoning, we can now deal with certain monumental evidence which was lacking when Overbeck wrote his criticism of Bötticher's theory. If we wish to find a link between the two periods it is supplied by the statue found at Delos and published by the Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique , 1878, Pl. i. and well described by M. Homolle. The inscription declares that it was dedicated by Nikandra, the daughter of Deinodokos the Haxian to " loxéoupa," and is, therefore, a representation of Artemis. As the epigraphy is very interesting and bears on its date, the first line is here given : - M AtyQèKtir BïBCOhol loX^PB I There is no human likeness except at the extremities, and the faint indication of breasts and hips and of the hair, which falls in broad strips on the shoulders. The head is so defaced that we can say nothing of the features except that they appear to have been wrought in very low relief, as the throat also is ; and we cannot de- cide whether the eyes are open or closed ; the type of the counten- ance would appear to be round and rather fleshy. The arms are riveted to the side with a slight interval for ' of their length, and the hands are almost formless, being clenched Jbut perforated as though holding something. The clothing is indicated merely by a line that marks the end of the chiton by the feet, which wear sandals. The forms are so crude and inorganic that if the trunk had been found alone without the head and the arms and feet it would scarcely have been supposed to be part of the human figure, and the back is even more inorganic than the front. The shape of the pillar still so far prevails over the iconic that M. Homolle himself remarks - à propos of the work - " Avant Dédale on se contentait de dégrossir les dpyol '16ol piimitifs:" but he does not work out the theory of development which his words might seem to suggest. He supposes the work to be not quite so old as it appears, because in certain details he finds a comparative power in handling the surface of the marble : " La facture de certaines parties est la preuve qu' à l'époque où elle fut executee on savait déjà faire mieux : " yet he ascribes it vaguely to the 7th century, supposing</page><page sequence="7">GREEK SCULPTURE . 17» that marble was first used for statues in place of wood about 700 B.c. Whether there is a certain intentional preservation of very rudimentary forms in this, as we know was the case in other instances, is not a question that need be discussed now. The model or type is the most primitive that has yet been discovered in marble work. Before discussing any question of date some works that are: closely akin to this may be mentioned : - (а) A fragment of a female figure found at Eleusis, and described Eph. Arch. y 1884, p. 3. and published ibid 7tm/0£, 9; the head and feet are wanting, and possibly the latter were never indicated at all. On the breasts which are faintly marked are traces of the long curls which fall down over the shoulders. From the waist downwards no- organic forms are discernible at all beneath the talaric chiton, which is not the only garment, for at the side and about the middle of the body are traces of a tightly-drawn peplos. The arms, which are missing, must have been glued to the side. The waist is extremely pinched. The whole appearance, though we can note a certain advance, may be called rerpaytovos or columnar. (б) Probably of very similar type to this was the statue of the Ptoan Apollo of which a fragment of the lower part has been dis« covered with the inscription : - •on fì NŘ©£Ke:To/ Fi rQ w ' 3 IOTI/otivacT OToś w ç roi F £ f e: i.e., iûv dv€0rjK€ T(¡) AttÓWcùVL T(j) II TtûUl . . OTOÇ €7 TOI Jk&lt;T€. The inscription has been published by M. Holleaux in the Bulle- tin de Correspondance Hellénique , 1886. The fragment is about 2 feet 3 inches high, showing the lower part of both legs enveloped in drapery so that no organic form is recognisable at all. One can see the left toes with a sandal and a small portion of the right toes, and the statue was evidently standing. There are faint lines before and behind indicating an upper garment, which was found also on the figure above mentioned. The very archaic scheme is here undoubt- edly a comparatively late survival, for the type of the writing, which, as M. Holleaux has pointed out, is very like to that of the Dermys and Kitylos monument, belongs to the later period of the 6th century.</page><page sequence="8">174 ARCHAEOLOGY. These are the only marble works with which I am acquainted that can be considered to represent this earliest stage of free sculp- ture : but some small terra-cotta figures belonging to the British Museum from Tangra may illustrate for us the same style in another material. The accompanying sketch14 will just serve to show the crudest form of them in outline. ł M M A pair of stump-like arms, a few zigzag vertical lines to hint at the drapery, features worthy of the art of the South -sea islands, are the only marks that distinguish this figure from a mere fetish- object ; and the great breadth and thinness of the trunk suggest that the form of the o-ai/ts or wooden board has been rendered into terra-cotta with a few iconic details added. As regards marble work at least, it seems clear already that the pillar is the actual starting-point from which the process begins that ends in the free articulated statue ; and this becomes clearer still when we trace the various points in the development of the human organism from the inorganic germ. This blending or meet- ing of the two forms may be paralleled by the process which pre- vailed at Camirus of working the ct/cwv of Aphrodite upon the alabastron.15 And another instance of a similar transition would be obtained, if the ingenious suggestion of Mr. A. Evans,16 in regard to certain sepulchral or Chthonian figures found among recently discovered Tarentine terra-cottas, be admitted - namely, that the gable-like crowns that rise above the heads of some of those figures are adapted from the form of the summits of some early Greek sepulchral stelae : that is, the tombstone itself may have been re- garded as possessed by the dead person, and one of its forms may have survived in the clkwv of the dead. The proof so far advanced holds good, if admitted, properly of the marble figure only ; for although a parallel development of the wooden idol from the aniconic wooden object is extremely probable, we have no direct archaeological evidence for this, as the earliest 14 A similar figure is sketched in Murray's History of Greek Sculpture, p. 73. 15 Instances of this may be seen in the hrst terra-cotta room of the British Museum. 16 Hellenic Journal , vii. No. 1, p. 18.</page><page sequence="9">GREEK SCULPTURE. 175 wooden idols have not been preserved. And another theory has been held concerning these, that they were carved under the immediate influence of the wooden Phoenician idols. But we may have resource to the same à priori evidence in favour of the same de- velopment for them that was put forward as regards the develop- ment of the stone aydX/xara. A clear distinction must be maintained between the process and origins of free sculpture and those of relief -work, of which the his- tory is quite different and in which considerable freedom was pro- bably acquired at a comparatively earlier date. Confining our attention to the former, we may draw certain deductions from the conclusion already arrived at. First, it will be unreasonable to suppose that the nascent Greek Sculpture, attempting to attain to a human image in marble, took its cue from the art of Egypt or Assyria. The iconic impulse, the desire to substitute something more real and lively for the old almost shapeless blocks, may have been communicated to Greece from the East : but neither Egypt nor Assyria supplied the earliest form of the representation. Perhaps later, when we are estimating the style of such a work as the Apollo of Tenea, some account must be taken of Egyptian influences, though even here these have been exaggerated and misunderstood, as Professor Brunn has ably pointed out. But the type of Nikandra's statue of Artemis cannot have been given by the art of the older countries. The barbarous semi- articu- late forms of the Delian figure would be inexplicable if the primi- tive sculptor had been attempting, however falteringly, to reproduce the severe conventional and mathematical scheme of the ordinary Egyptian statue.17 It shows rather a childish, helpless, indepen- dence, and what M. Dumont says18 of early Greek Sculpture in general " ce que le caractérisé à ses débuts c'est l'audace : il cherche, il ne copie pas " is only partially true here ; the sculptor does not •copy, it is true, and perhaps the first step was audacious in a cer- tain sense ; but we are more struck with the timorous reverence that superstitiously cleaves to the now incongruous form of the older cult-object; for though no doubt the mechanical difficulties that beset the first workers in marble explain much of the crude- ness of the figure, yet some effect must also I think be ascribed to the religious reserve. 17 Diodorus Siculus, i., 98, notices the resemblance of the Samian Apollo, a comparatively advanced work of Rhoecus and Theodorus, to the Egyptian typical form ¿&gt;s ras x€^Pas *X0V irapaTCTapévas, rà fie aKeXrj SiaßeßrjKOTa : the latter part of this description is inappropriate to the earliest Greek sculpture. 18 Monuments Grecs. 1878.</page><page sequence="10">176 ARCHAEOLOGY. Nor have we any more right to refer the Delian xoinon to the influences of Assyrian style, for the monuments supply us with no- real analogies. We find, indeed, in a few free statues of Assyrian sculpture a rendering of the drapery which bears a slight resem- blance to that of our figure : for instance, the statues of Nebo- and Assur-Bana-Pal, in the British Museum, are enveloped in a robe that falls down to the feet, and is drawn tightly in at the waist. But the resemblance even in this single point is merely superficial and accidental : the Assyrian sculptor only de- sired to reproduce a certain fashion of apparel, and though the effect is that the organic forais of the lower part of the body are almost concealed, yet it would be unnatural to see in this a pro- cess at all akin to that above described. To this fashion of Assyrian drapery, rather than to the influence of the aniconic object may be ascribed the forms of some of the statuettes of Cypriote stone belonging to the Cesnola collection at New York (e.g., pl. lx. of the Cesnola Collection Curtius). We may, indeed, maintain the theory that certain special types of free Greek sculp- ture have been developed under the influence of Oriental relief- work ; for instance, the winged Artemis from Otympia holding the lions, the flying Nike from Delos in the Central Museum of Athens, certain motives found in archaic terra-cotta work, such as Bellero- phon slaying the Chimaera, Eos carrying the body of her dead son, Perseus riding by the slaughtered Medusa ; the scheme of all these compositions, except the first, suggesting that the figures have been, as it were, detached from a background. Oriental relief- work must be borne in mind in tracing some of the origins of Asia Minor art ; but to say that the free statue in general is a develop- ment from the relief, is an unproved paradox.19 A second corollary that can be drawn from our main conclusion is that the influence of carving in wood does not count for the origins of free stone-carving. No doubt the former was earlier in time, for the material was of course easier to work, and we have Pliny's express statement concerning the greater antiquity of the wooden idol - a statement corroborated by the use of the term £óavov, which Pausanias usually applies to the very archaic figures which he mentions.20 But previously acquired practice in wood- 19 Semper's remarks ( Der Styl 1, p. 336) have been wrongly understood to contain such a theory. He is there saying nothing at all about the origin of the free statue in Greek sculpture. 20 It is useful to note that the broader significance of the term Çóavov, which in Strabo and other writers applies to a carved image in any material is not found at all in Pausanias : he uses oynX/za for the general term, Çóavov always</page><page sequence="11">GREEK SCULPTURE . 1 7 ! carving reacts on marble work only in the second and more de- veloped stage of the latter, not at all in this first period in which the primitive sculptor works a certain shape upon the stone pillar without any habit of expression or style gathered from work in other material. Thirdly, it would seem probable that the draped figures - if not the earliest cíkóvcs - were earlier than the naked : existing monu- mental evidence is in favour of this, and certain à priori reasons ; for it is clear that the figure muffled in drapery, which need only be indicated by a border-line at the feet, or a line at the waist, or by certain markings in very low relief on the surface, is much nearer to the columnar form than the naked and more or less or- ganically articulated figure. And among the recorded archaic figures that were ascribed to a pre-historic age I can only find mention of one that was nude - the ¿óavov yvfivbv 'Hpa/cAeovs at Corinth, that Pausanias mentions as the work of Daedalus (Paus. 2. 4. 5) : but the " Daedalid " style is not of the first era of Greek sculpture. Before touching on any questions of chronology as regards the first and later stages of Greek sculpture, it would be well to mark first the points of progress, and the illustrations of them. But it is necessary to premise that' the date of any particular work is always distinct from the date of its type - for certain crude types may be preserved long after they have become obsolete, perhaps to satisfy the impulse of religious conservatism. Thus, according to Paus- anias' account of the images of Phoebe and Hilaeira at Sparta (3. 16. 1), of very archaic work, the face of the one had been more or less modernised, but a pious dream forbade a similar change in respect of the other. The first step of advance was probably, in the case at least of the draped figures, the freer rendering of the arms ; for, as the legs were enveloped in drapery, the need was not likely to be so soon felt for finding a more iconic expression of them. Gradually more and more of the length of the arm will have been freed from the side, until one at least was disengaged altogether, and then the forearm could be extended at right angles to the body, the upper arm remaining still attached to the trunk. The immediate advantage of this change was not only the heightened impression of freedom and life, but also the greater facility for dis- playing attributes and personality : the arms riveted to the side, with clenched palms, could do little to express the personage repre- for the wooden figure : vide 2, 4, 1 : 3, 25, 3 : 4, 34, 7 : 7, 23, 5 : 8, 31, 5 : 8, 4, 2 : 2, 31, 6. N</page><page sequence="12">178 ARCHEOLOGY. sented, but the outstretched hand could display the appropriate emblem. The following are instances of this advance upon the original scheme. (a) The Hera of Samos in the Louvre, of which the head and left arm are lost : the lower part of the body has no human likeness, the talaric chiton falling down with fine fluted lines, while the upper garment is tightly drawn over this. The right arm is riveted to the side without any interval at all, but there are indications that the left arm must have been raised. This work may well be a re- production of the very archaic statue that was ascribed to the semi- mythical Smilis, who first carved for the Samians an anthropomor- phic representation of Hera. (Ò) A statue found on the Acropolis 1886, published in Les Musées ď Athènes Pl. X, wearing talaric chiton and a short upper- garment. From the waist downward the form is aniconic and the feet do not appear ; the right arm is held down by the side but partly disengaged, but the left forearm which is missing was evi- dently extended forward. The life-like rendering of the breasts and the very advanced treatment of the features shew that this very archaic scheme of body is here an intentional anachronism. (c) A small bronze female figure found at the Ptoan temple of Apollo in the course of the French excavations, published by M. Hol- leaux, Bull, de Corr. Hellénique, 1888, (Mai-Novembre) pl. XI. The lower part of the body disappears as usual below the drapery, and the waist is drawn in by a girdle. The breasts are excessively developed and the arms are extended : the treatment of the face is comparatively advanced. M. Holleaux is wrong in regarding this figure as an instance of the transition from the earliest aniconic ob- jects to the representation of the living human form, for we have seen that the stage of transition is earlier than this. But his suggestion has much weight that this &lt;rxw a rerpdyayvov was retained longer for the female figure, for as soon as the male figure had to be represented as nude, this scheme must soon have been abandoned for it. (i d ) The very archaic statue of the Amyclean Apollo described by Pausanias in the words already quoted. The hands - if not the arms - were most probably detached from the body, as they appear on certain coins that are a more less accurate reproduction of the ancient figure.21 We are here dealing with a very primitive bronze work, an achievement rather of the art of metal-soldering than of 21 Fide Gardner, Numismatic Commentary on Pautanias, Hellenic Journal, vol. vii. No. 1 p. 63.</page><page sequence="13">GREEK SCULPTURE . 179 metal-casting, as is indicated by the nails which can be detected according to Professor Gardner in the coin representations, and which served to secure the beaten plates. Now it is obvious that the earliest works of this art may have shown somewhat more freedom than the earliest figures carved in the stone : for it was almost as easy to disengage certain plates, those for instance that served for the arms, from the main body, as to solder them upon it without interval. It is possible indeed that the earliest bronże- works also adhered to the traditional semi-iconic type with the imprisoned arms and limbs, but there was less mechanical necessity for such adherence as there was in the case of marble-carving. (&lt; e ) The bronze statuette found at Olympia, representing a winged goddess with drapery treated in the traditional primitive fashion, and with arms brought obliquely across the breast. The figure has a generic resemblance to those of this group, but the type may be Oriental and of quite different descent. ( 'J ) A terra-cotta female figure in the British Museum from Polledraria near Vulci, with the right forearm stretched out and the left held across the breast. Instances might be multiplied, but these already noted are sufficient to show that the same modes of development prevailed» and the same progressive experiments were made in very different localities ; it is likely that the stages of progress were on the whole the same in different places, although of course by no means con- temporaneous. A more striking and fruitful advance was made in the develop- ment of the above type, when some life and iconic form was given to the lower limbs. These were gained by separating the legs and advancing the left, or else by gathering the drapery in one of the hands and drawing it tightly across the legs so as to reveal the forms. An instance of the first method, belonging still to a very archaic scheme, is a Cypriote statuette of a female figure with the arms close to the side, and with the left leg slightly advanced be- neath the drapery ; of the second, a bronze statuette from Olympia showing a goddess with the left hand on her breast, and gathering a fold of her drapery in her right hand. It is clear that by working out either of these motives more and more freely the bondage to the old aniconic &lt;TXliJLa is most effectually broken through: the combina- tion of the two in a period of ripe archaism produces that graceful effect that is found in the figures recently discovered on the Acropolis. Turning to the representation of nude figures, we may try to trace corresponding stages of development in them, but among</page><page sequence="14">180 ARCHAEOLOGY. existing works it is difficult to find any that can be taken as the earliest point. The small almost shapeless idol published in Müllems- Denkmäler (1 Tf. ii. No. 15) may not be Hellenic at all ; nor in dealing with the origins of Hellenic sculpture need we refer to that naked idol of a Goddess with the hands pointing to the breast, possibly Istar, of Mesopotamian origin, a type found frequently in Cyprus and diffused even as far as Sardinia ;22 this figure may have supplied a motive to the later Greek representation of Aphrodite,, but it never served as a model for any other Greek representation whether primitive or advanced. In marble sculpture we have no nude statue of style so primitive and crude, so near to the aniconic form, as the draped figure of Artemis 'loxéaupa of Delos : this may be an accident, or it may well be - as above suggested - that th&amp; earliest áyáÀ/z, ara, being the divine idols, were draped, and that the undraped figure was not attempted until a certain plastic power had been obtained. At all events, the earliest naked statue that I am aware of is a fragment (a) - unpublished as far as I know - in the first room of the Central Museum at Athens. The surface is much disfigured, and the lower limbs are wanting, so that one cannot decide whether the legs are yet separated or not. The arms are glued as it were to the side without any interval at all, and the hips are very faintly indicated. But for the first time we have a serious attempt, however crude, to give the organism of the torso ; the parts of the breast, the abdomen, and the pelvis are shown with a certain distinctness, but the muscles appear flaccid, and the flesh of the pelvis is far too deciduous, as in fact we find it also on the Apollo of Tenea. The features are barbarous and coarse, the nose thick and protruding, the outline of the eyes almost triangular, as it is in the Apollo of Orchomenos. Slightly more advanced than this in one respect is the earlier of the two torsos from Actium (b) in the Louvre,23 which shows us the arm still close to the side, but with an interval of about ith of their length, a diaphragm scarcely articulated at all, the muscles of the shoulders hardly indicated, and the same triangular shape of the body and the same incorrect sinking of the breast bones which we see in the " Apollos " of Thera, Orchomenos and Tenea. The next stage (c) in which differences of local work begin to make themselves felt, in which the effects can be traced of the forms of wood carving and metal work, may be represented by the last- 22 Terra-eotta in the British Museum, First Terra-cotta Room. 25 Vide description of Torsos from Actium, Gazette Arcliéol . 1886, by Collignon.</page><page sequence="15">GREEK SCULPTURE. 181 named works, which are too well known to need description here* This is the first point in the development at which it is legitimate to speak of Egyptian influence, to which M. Collignon in the article mentioned in the preceding note unreservedly refers the works of this type. But we shall not refer the whole scheme of the type to any Egyptian model, if we accept the theory that the Greek úkúv has been developed step by step from the Greek aniconic kí W. Yet the Egyptian canon may have lent certain details to Greek sculptors of the latter part of the 7th and the beginning of the 6th century ; for instance possibly - as Perrot maintains - 24 the long plaited mass of hair that falls down on the back of the neck of these figures is an imitation of the Egyptian Klaft. Possibly also the proportion of the thin hips to the broad shoulders is Egyptian, though this form may arise quite indepen- ■dantly from the desire to emphasise and exaggerate those parts of the body, such as the thighs and shoulders, which can best give the impression of strength. What remains to assign to Egyptian in- fluence is the pose of the left leg which is always held in advance, though the same mechanical reasons of convenience that probably explain this in Egyptian sculpture may explain it also in Greek. The expression of the face, so far as it has any, and the forms of it have nothing whatever to do with Egypt or the East. As regards these forms it has not yet been possible to give any definite account, for we have not material enough to trace any regular development in the works of these earlier stages. We find no fixed method of handling, no conventional type of features, but rather irregularity and helplessness of hand. The one point of agreement discoverable in the heads carved in these earlier stages o o o of sculpture is the foursquare shape, the back of the head, the front, and the cheeks forming four separate planes, a shape which betrays the aniconic original, and which is preserved more or less disguised «down to the last period of archaism. We find it in the Athena's head from the west pediment of the Aeginetan temple, but not in the Athena's head of the eastern nor in the head of the Strangford Apollo. Hitherto, also, we have not been able to classify works by any inner distinctions of style, but only by a principle of mechanical arrangement, and according to the less and greater advance they ex- hibit from the aniconic form, and by the distinction between the nude and the draped. It becomes possible to speak of style first in regard to the forms of the last mentioned group (c), and from now 24 Bevue des deux mondes , 1885, p. 302.</page><page sequence="16">182 ARCHEOLOGY. onward the development is not merely external and mechanical but inward and spiritual. In the next stage we may look for external advance in the freer movement of the arms, such as we may conjecture was shown by the statue of the Delian Apollo who held the three Graces in his hand, a work of the middle of the 6th century by Tectaios and Angelion pupils of Scyllis and Dipoenus. In this stage also or at the close of the last we have the beginnings of expression in the face ; the archaic smile becomes prevalent, which is a purely Greek form first found on the face of the Apollo of Tenea. As regards these and the works of more advanced archaism, the question of their logical arrangement becomes very difficult. It no longer serves us much to group them according as they exhibit the same scheme of figure, for among those that may be thus grouped together there will be found many great intrinsic differ- ences of style. We may distinguish in the marble works the distinct influences of the processes of carving in wood and bronze-casting ; but this will lead to a superficial classification in which much that is essential is omitted. A method that some archaeologists have followed is to dis- tinguish works according to the places in which they are found or from which they are known to have been brought, and thus to de- fine local schools. But this plan is likely often to be very illusory,, for the inscriptions on archaic works that prove them to be im- ported and to have nothing to do with any native art of the place of their dedication are very numerous. Thus the recent attempt which has been made by M. Holleaux in several numbers of the Bulletin de Correspondance Hellénique to establish an Archaic Boeotian art is on the whole a failure. All the works that the Ptoan excavations have brought to light, which show any real style or disciplined schooling or any appreciable manner are, as he himself admits, of foreign import. What remains is a sculpture style-less and in certain forms almost as rude as certain savage work, lax and undisciplined and most difficult to date. The well-known monument of Dermys and Kitylos shows Boeotian helplessness rather than Boeotian freshness and naive té, and, as the style of its inscription refers it to the beginning of the 5 th century, is altogether an anachronism. The most scientific and satisfactory classification yet advanced appears to me to be that which Lange has given in the Mitthei- lungen des deutschen Instituts 1882, p. 193 (Zwei Köpfe von der Acropolis in Athen). He distinguishes on the grounds (1) of the</page><page sequence="17">GREEK SCULPTURE . 183 greater or less emphasis laid on the fleshy parts or on the bone-structure, (2) of the shape of the bone-structure, (3) of the varying physiognomical expression. He finds thus the follow- ing two groups, (1) figures of sharp tense forms of body and face, with thin features, prominent cheek-bones and chin, showing as he thinks Egyptian leanings: (2) figures of "Ionic" style under Assyrian influence, a style influenced by metal- work and showing soft round and full modelling and in the face a more or less sensuous expression. In the instances he gives of the two groups he may be sometimes mistaken, and his account of the influences under which the groups arose is questionable in parts. But there is no doubt that the distinction is vital and far-reaching. To the " Ionic " group are closely related the newly discovered female statues on the Acro- polis that show the " island '' manner ; and to this group belong the heads from Ephesus in the British Museum and the head from īthodes. Is it possible to give any dates for the origins of Greek sculpture and for these various stages we have just noted ? To discuss fully the chronological question is impossible in the present paper, and, as new monumental evidence of the archaic period is every day accum- ulating, would be perhaps ill-timed. Nothing satisfactory as regards this question has at present been attempted. M. Dumont25 has indeed attempted to give dates for the earliest periods, but his theory is vitiated by the fundamental error of regarding the period of Archermos as represented by the Delian statues of the quasi-aniconic ar)(r¡1jLaü It is well to note that the question when the divine objects of worship began to be iconic, and the question when the earliest iconic marble sculpture arose, are separate. As regards the first of these questions, there is little doubt that the wooden clkwv is at least as early as Homer's period, and while a certain artistic record is found about the end of the 7th century, the works of Daedalus belong to the prehistoric age and may roughly be assigned to the close of the 8th. But the ancients were aware that the wooden idols attributed to Daedalus were not the most primitive in form : we are, therefore, referred further back still, perhaps to the 9th cen- tury, for the beginnings of iconism. As regards the origin of marble sculpture the records fail us, and probably there never was any record. The Chian school whose oldest name is Melas belongs to the beginning of the 6th century, and soon after this, marking evidently an advance, come the names of Scyllis and Dipoenus (Pliny, 36, P.) 25 Monuments Grecs , 1878.</page><page sequence="18">184 ARCHAEOLOGY. of Olympiad 50. Now the type to which the Delian Artemis belongs is probably much older than this century, for the progress from it to such figures as the winged victory of Archermos and the Apollo of Tectaios and Angelion is very great, and a considerable interval must be allowed, and this primitive type in marble may be thrown back to the very beginning of the 7th century. I have pointed out already that the draped marble figure is probably earlier in origin than the undraped : and for dating the earliest representation of the nude male figure, it is scarcely fanciful to take as the " terminus a quo " the 1.5th Olympiad when the fashion began to compete naked at the Olympian games. Thus the last quarter of the 7th century will be the period in which we may place such a work as the above-mentioned male statue in the Central Museum of Athens, and a little later then, as regards style, will fall the " Apollos " of Orchomenos and Thera. We learn from Pausanias description of the statue of Arrachion at Phigaleia (8. 40), the date of which was about 560, that while pro- gress may have been made in other directions, this type long sur- vived for the representation of the nude athletic figure ; and we find it in so advanced a work as the Strangford Apollo, upon which there still rests, as it were, a shadow of the ar^rjfia rerpaywov, with which Greek sculpture started, and which in many forms it retained till the period of transition to the perfected style of the 5th century.
