<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Temporal Allegory of the Tazza Farnese EUGENE J. DWYER Abstract The Tazza Farnese has been interpreted as an allegory of the Nile for the last 200 years. Recently R. Merkelbach has attempted to read the relief on the inside of the cup as an astronomical allegory of the constellations related to the inundation. It is proposed here that the figures on the inside of the cup represent an allegory of creation accord- ing to the Hermetic tractate known as the Poimandres. In giving visual form to philosophical and religious concepts expressed in that text, the designer of the Tazza has drawn primarily upon Greek, but also upon Egyptian, religion and religious iconography. The inundation of the Nile has been interpreted as a type (or archetype) of creation, corresponding to the creation of time, the planets, the elements, and human life. The composition of seven fig- ures plus the sphinx is determined by the general patterns of the group of constellations that surround Orion in the Greek astronomical sphere. Among these constellations are the zodiacal signs of Taurus, Gemini, and Cancer. The seven planets, also represented by the seven figures in the Tazza, are distributed among the zodiacal signs according to the astrological doctrine of planetary decans. The matching of planets with "houses" thus corresponds with the Thema Mundi, or "Birthday of the Universe." The literary evidence, astronomical data, and the absence of specific allusion to Roma suggest that the Tazza is a prod- uct of Alexandrian court art ca. 100-31 B.C.* * Given the similarity that exists between the figure of Horus in the Tazza and ancient representations of the con- stellation of Orion (noticed also by Merkelbach), this paper follows from a single premise, namely, that an Alexandrian artist would have used a real map. The map illustrated in fig. 2 was produced by trial and error, based on observations of the celestial sphere and on star positions calculated for me (historical and projected) by Franklin Miller, Jr., Profes- sor of Physics at Kenyon College. It was presented to a Kenyon audience in 1977 and 1979, to the Champaign- Urbana chapter of the AIA in 1979, and to the Columbus chapter in 1985. I am indebted to comments received on each occasion. Some of the material was also presented in Toronto in 1984 at the annual meeting of the College Art Association. I would like to thank Robert Bianchi, Carol Bier, Lionel Bier, Philipp and Raina Fehl, Sharon Herson, and my Kenyon colleagues, Ellen Mankoff, William E. McCulloh, and Clifford Weber. I would also like to thank Roger Beck and an anonymous reviewer for AJA for their helpful comments, David Polz of the German Archaeological Institute, Cairo, for the photograph of Euthenia in Alexan- dria, and John Pollini for sharing with me his own study of the Tazza Farnese.

DWYER [AJA 96 INTRODUCTION The Tazza Farnese The Tazza Farnese (pls. 1-6) needs no introduction to archaeologists.' Yet familiarity and uniqueness have conspired to make it one of the most puzzling of ancient monuments.2 As a sardonyx it is unequaled among surviving ancient gems. According to Pliny the paleness of its white layer is a sign of the true Indian sardonyx.3 Few gems even approach it in the sophis- ticated control of the cameo layers.4 Although as a work of art it is virtually without parallel, neither internal nor external evidence has established its au- thorship, its patronage, or its date with security.5 It does not appear to be a political allegory like the Gemma Augustea or the Grand Camee de France, both of which seem dry and somewhat lifeless by comparison. Unlike both of those gems, it was not intended to be set as a piece of jewelry. It functioned as a libation bowl, one fit for a king or an emperor. In the analysis and interpretation of the relief that occupies the interior of the bowl, I have made one very important assumption: that the work was pro- duced for a sophisticated audience of the sort that might read and understand Alexandrian poets such as Callimachus and Eratosthenes. The modern history of interpretation of the Tazza Farnese began with Ennius Quirinus Visconti (1751- 1818).6 In their publication of the Tazza in connection with the exhibition of Medici gems held in 1973, Nicole Dacos and other scholars summarized the sa- lient points of Visconti's interpretation of the scene on the cup's interior: 1) the sphinx (figure A, pl. 6a, b) is the symbol of Egypt; 2) the woman reclining upon it (figure B, pl. 6a) is Isis; 3) the bearded divinity (figure C, pl. 4a) is Nilus; 4) the two women at the right (figures G and H, pl. 5b) are Memphis and Anchirroe, daughters of Nilus (and principal branches of it); 5) the two flying youths (figures E and F, pl. 5a) represent the Etesian Winds; and 6) the youth standing in the middle of the composition (fig- ure D, pl. 4b) is Horus.7 Visconti's hypothesis has been so widely accepted among scholars that a century and a half of subse- quent interpretation can be summarized in three ad- denda: 1) Certain of the principal figures have been recognized as portraits in the guise of divinities.8 2) The mythological identity of the figures has been subjected to an interpretatio graeca as a concession to the style and presumed historical milieu of the work. Accordingly, Horus has sometimes been identified Sternglaube F. Boll, C. Bezold, and W. Gundel, Sternglaube und Sterndeutung' (Stutt- gart 1974). Thiele G. Thiele, Antike Himmelsbilder (Berlin 1898).

It has recently received extensive consideration in La Rocca. 2 Among those who have written on the Tazza Farnese, only A. Alfbldi has given adequate consideration to the consequences of the work's uniqueness for standard art historical methodology. See A. Alfbldi, "Redeunt Saturnia regna VII: Frugifer-Triptolemos im ptolemAisch-r6mischen Herrscherkult," Chiron 9 (1979) 553-606, esp. 565. He notes, moreover, that literary sources preserve records of cups that have not survived, like the 2,000 onyx cups in the possession of Mithradates VI. Such passages must be consid- ered when art historians argue ex silentio that sardonyxes were not common before the late first century B.C. See Thompson 122. 3 HN 37.86. 4 Cf. the high opinion of Furtwingler 253: "Ein durch Gr6sse und Arbeit gleich hervorragendes Meisterwerk der Glyptik." For the valuable appreciation of a professional lapidary sculptor, see T.E. Haevernick and R.H. Hahn, "Zu der 'Tazza Farnese',"JMainz 9 (1962) 61-67. 5 Although it is likely that the Tazza was recognized in its own time as a masterpiece, no satisfactory study of its influence exists. Echoes or imitations such as the two figures described in a Late Antique ekphrasis deserve to be collected. See P. Friedlander ed., Johannes von Gaza und Paulus Sil- entarius: Kunstbeschreibungen justinianischer Zeit (Leipzig 1912 [repr. Hildesheim 1969]) 196 (of the two Seasons). J. Polzer has kindly sent me a photograph of a third-century A.C. glass cup in the British Museum, depicting a reclining woman (very similar to H) holding a hemispherical bowl in one hand and a sistrum in the other. For the sistrum and hemispherical bowl as attributes of Isis, see Bonneau 256- 57. For other parallels, see infra. 6 Visconti published his interpretation in Museo Pio Cle- mentino III (Rome 1790). 7 N. Dacos, A. Giuliano, and U. Pannuti, Il tesoro di Lorenzo il Magnifico I: Le gemme (Florence 1973) 69-72, especially useful for a review of the literature prior to 1973. Furtwangler is much indebted to Quaranta. More recently the literature has been summarized in La Rocca 7-11. 8 The list of identifications proposed by various scholars for Visconti's figures of Nilus, Horus, Isis, and the sphinx is formidable, but in no case is it compelling. Charbonneaux suggested Ptolemy V (sphinx), Cleopatra I (Isis), and Ptol- emy VI (Horus). Bastet suggested Ptolemy VII (Nilus), Cleo- patra III (Isis), and Ptolemy Alexander (Horus). In both cases, the identifications proposed followed the authors' sty- listic dating of the work and seem somewhat peripheral to the argument. La Rocca identifies the Isis figure as Cleopatra VII.</page><page sequence="3">1992] THE TEMPORAL ALLEGORY OF THE TAZZA FARNESE 257 with Triptolemos.9 3) In the allegory of nature there have been read certain allusions to an approaching golden age, leading many scholars to connect the Tazza with the age of sibylline prophecy that is re- flected in the poetry of Virgil.1 In addition to the refinement of Visconti's icono- graphic hypothesis, the modern literature has been concerned with attaching to the Tazza a date appro- priate to its style, seen as ever closer to the Augustan era." Parallels from Augustan literature have also been adduced in support of a late first-century B.C. date. Visconti and Furtwangler had considered the composition of the interior as a "collection of [person- ified] forces that cause and depict the abundant fer- tility of the land of the Nile." F.L. Bastet introduced a significant new element into the interpretation when he recognized a messianic current reminiscent of Vir- gil's fourth Eclogue (assuming a common source in Alexandrian literature). Yet none of the lines of Au- gustan poetry cited by Bastet, Thompson, La Rocca, or others is by itself a key to the work. Some Problems with Previous Interpretations Despite the large literature that has accumulated on the Tazza Farnese, there are many features, icon- ographical and stylistic, that have been overlooked. Perhaps most glaring and persistent has been the failure to associate in meaning the magnificent gor- goneion of the cup's exterior (pl. 3) with the scene in the interior: among his other claims to identity, the figure whom Visconti called Horus (pl. 4b) makes a very plausible Perseus, and his attention seems to be drawn to something beyond the limits of the cup's interior, possibly alluding to the relief of the opposite side.'2 In the discussion that follows, I propose to examine certain features of the Tazza that seem to me to be especially problematic and in need of explanation. 1) Precise orientation on the vertical axis. Although partially overlapped by the first nymph, the sphinx establishes the groundline of the entire composition (pls. 2 and 6). The upper torso of Isis establishes a stable perpendicular, emphasized by the triangular 9 These revisions of the Visconti hypothesis began shortly after Visconti's publication and have been universally en- dorsed ever since. Merkelbach 116-27, however, weighs the Egyptian iconography more heavily than has been custom- ary. 10 Esp. Bastet 19-24, Thompson 120-21, and La Rocca 95-100. The theme of the approaching Golden Age and the sibylline oracles purporting to foretell it has been developed in a series of articles written by A. Alfoldi under the title "Redeunt Saturnia regna": "[I]: L'attente du Roi-Sauveur A Rome," RN 1971, 76-89; "II: An Iconographical Pattern Heralding the Return of the Golden Age in or around 139 B.C.," Chiron 3 (1973) 131-42; "III: Juppiter-Apollo und Veiovis," Chiron 2 (1972) 215-30; "IV: Apollo und die Si- bylle in der Epoche der Btirgerkriege," Chiron 5 (1975) 165- 92; "V: Zum Gottesgnadentum des Sulla," Chiron 6 (1976) 143-58; "VI: From the Aion Plutonios of the Ptolemies to the Saeculum Frugiferum of the Roman Emperors," in K.H. Kinzl ed., Greece and the Eastern Mediterranean in Ancient History and Prehistory: Studies Presented to Fritz Schachermeyr on the Occasion of his Eightieth Birthday (Berlin 1977) 1-30; and "VII: Frugifer-Triptolemos im ptolemAisch-r6mischen Herrscherkult" (supra n. 2). Alf6ldi's own interpretation of the Tazza is presented in the last article cited, 564-70. Al- f6ldi's entire series of "Redeunt Saturnia regna" articles is valuable in presenting a more Asianist perspective, strongly indebted to the work of Reitzenstein, Cumont, and others, than has generally been admitted in recent work on the Tazza. " A comprehensive review of stylistic parallels was under- taken by Dorothy Burr Thompson in a paper presented in 1976. At that time she wrote: "[Nilus] has few parallels, of which the most telling is that on the Ahenobarbus Relief, ca. 40-30 B.C. [i.e., the Munich base now known to have be- longed to the same monument as a historical relief in Paris and dated by F. Coarelli, "L' 'ara di Domizio Enobarbo' e la cultura artistica in Roma nel II sec. a.C.," DialArch 2 (1968) 302ff, to ca. 115 B.C.]. M. Torelli, Typology and Structure of Roman Historical Reliefs (Ann Arbor 1982) has given strong support to Coarelli's dating of Thompson's "Ahenobarbus Relief." The group of Isis and the sphinx is close to the Athribis plaster of the late first century B.C. and to Roman coins of the late first century A.C. The nymphs, very nearly Augustan in style, find comparisons most telling in the same period. The winds, on the other hand, are like Hellenistic satyrs, but their hair and their fellows seem to date after the Tower of the Winds (before 37 B.C.). [Horus], of the same type as the winds, seems closest to the figures made by gem- cutters of the early Augustan period. All this, even stated with due caution, brings us to the threshold of the Augustan age." Thompson goes on to observe, however, "In my study, I have been troubled by the absence of parallels even so early as the decade before Actium and by the numerous comparisons with monuments of Imperial date. Without relying on much stylistic analysis, I am still driven to the conclusion that the Tazza, allowing for its Alexandrian rather than Roman conception, must fall into the twenties of the first century B.C. Thus we pass Actium, that vital and genuine barrier between Hellenistic and Roman worlds." Thompson 119-20. 12 On the subject of Perseus, see below, n. 219. For the confusion of Perseus with Hermes, see LIMC V, 385. There is a problem posed by the composition of the interior itself. Furtwingler alluded to it when he wrote that the meaning of the ensemble is a collection of the forces that cause and depict the opulent fertility of the land of the Nile, though not a representation of any precise moment (III, 256). Furt- wangler hesitated to call the composition an allegory, but he did not claim that it was a dramatic narrative either. This ambiguity is not characteristic of Greek art, even in the Hellenistic period, though it is typical of Roman art and Oriental art. Even if the problems posed for the traditional dating by the likely presence of allegory were to be resolved, the vague allegory (excluding the possibility of portraiture) suggested by Furtwangler seems a most bland and unim- pressive subject for so precious a work of art. On this point, see La Rocca 8.</page><page sequence="4">258 EUGENE J. DWYER [AJA 96 disposition of her arms. The tongue of the yoke, actually off-axis, curves slightly to converge with the true axis at its upward extension.'3 The eye of the viewer is thus drawn to the head of the first Wind (pl. 5b), which, turned upward, lies directly on the vertical axis. Extended, the axis touches the outer rim of the Tazza precisely at the white nodule: clearly a point of orientation for the gem-cutter. 2) Hieratic grouping of the principal triad. The three principal figures (B, C, and D) of the Tazza relief are united in the curious overlapping of their attributes: yoke, rhyton, and grain spears (pls. 2, 4b). The figures are thus arranged in an inverted equilateral triangle, with the tongue of the yoke serving as vertical axis. The heraldic composition is emphasized by the arms and shoulders of the men (and the cross-arm of the yoke) and the crook of the woman's right arm, which repeats the form of the triangle apex. (This static element in the composition contrasts oddly with the distribution of the rest of the figures.14) 3) Symbolism of seven figures (pls. 1-2). Beside the principal triad, there are two subordinate pairs of figures, one male (figures E and F) and one female (G and H). Their attributes and their associations suggest their identification as physical elements in the Stoic cosmology, namely, (counterclockwise) fire- aether (veil, flaming hair), air (bucina), earth (corn- field, rhyton), and water (bowl).'5 From left to right the whole composition can be read schematically as a hermaphroditic monad (C, "Nilus"), a heterosexual dyad (D and B, "Horus" and "Isis"), which subdivides into a superior, masculine triad (D, E, F, "Horus" and the Winds), and an inferior, feminine triad (B, G, H, "Isis" and the Horae).'6 The scale or size of the figures varies not strictly as a function of the supposed dis- tance from the observer." Nilus is the largest figure by far though he is overlapped by Isis.'8 The variation of scale thus begins at the left with the largest and diminishes as the eye moves to the right in defiance of normal perspective. Scale thus reinforces the rela- tion of principals to subordinates noted in the schema of triads and dyads. 4) Unconventional iconography of the principal fig- ures. It has been argued that the difficulty encoun- tered in identifying the principals is evidence of an early date.'" The syncretism applied in the figures of the Tazza does not appear to be identical with that found on Alexandrian coins of the Roman Empire. The practice of religious syncretism that began in the Hellenistic period and found particular expression in Ptolemaic Egypt was destructive to traditional depic- tions of the gods, Egyptian and Greek alike. In the words of E.R. Goodenough, "even Apuleius, when in rapture he has a vision of Isis rising from the sea, prays to her not as to the personal Isis, but as to a conventionalization of the 'Female principle in na- ture,' whom he could address by many names because no one name meant anything literally"20 (emphasis mine). In the cases of the principal figures of the Tazza a certain ambiguity in iconography seems to be intentional. For example, the Isis figure (pl. 6a) ap- pears without the characteristic Isis headdress and 13 Cf. Nonnos, Dionysiaca 38.350-51 (during the course of Phaethon): "and the very axle running through the re- volving heavens bent." On the importance of Phaethon here, see below. 14 G. Lippold ("Antike Gemildekopien," AbhMiinch N.F. 33 [1951] 153-56) considered the Tazza a masterpiece of circular composition. As a whole, however, the composition of the scene is somewhat disturbing. The triad, static in its symbolic gesture, is unbalanced to the left due to the tre- mendous inflation of the figure of Nilus. The Winds, on the other hand, appear to be diminished in size and, together with the Seasons, scarcely achieve equilibrium for the right half of the composition. I believe this strange effect can be explained by the two factors to be discussed below: fidelity to the astronomical map and distortion caused by carto- graphic projection. 15 Cf. Diog. Laert. 7.137 (Long and Sedley 47B). For the pairing of the elements, cf. Long and Sedley 47D, F. See infra. 16 I.e., a "dendritic" schema, (1 + 2 + 4), which accounts for doubling of the characteristics of a given element in the successive pairing (e.g., the repetition of Horus's facial fea- tures in those of the first Wind). Subdivided hebdomads of the type (1 + 3 + 3) are found in Neoplatonic writers like Proclus. See L.J. Rosin, The Philosophy of Proclus (New York 1949) 151. I would like to thank my colleague, William E. McCulloh, for bringing this work to my attention. 17 The apparent use of diagonal perspective has been taken as evidence of a Roman date by K. Schefold, "Vom Ursprung und Sinn r6mischer Reliefkunst," Charites (1957) 195-96 (cited in Thompson 120, n. 65), but a second-century B.C. date by C.M. Havelock, Hellenistic Art (Greenwich, Conn. 1968) 238. 18 The symbolic importance of scale is noted by Thomp- son 116, 23. Thompson 120-21 suggests a connection be- tween the inflated figure of Nilus and Virgil's line, contra autem magno maerentem corpore Nilum, ("but facing [her], mourning Nilus, with great body") [Aen. 8.711], positing a hypothetical common source in painting. Is it not possible that Virgil knew the Tazza directly? See infra n. 233. 19 Charbonneaux 89 rejected Furtwangler's identification of the Isis figure as Euthenia ("Fertility") because of the late date of the comparisons adduced. 20 E.R. Goodenough, By Light, Light: The Mystic Gospel of Hellenistic Judaism (New Haven 1935) 12.</page><page sequence="5">1992] THE TEMPORAL ALLEGORY OF THE TAZZA FARNESE 259 without any other attribute that might serve to iden- tify her as Isis.21 Even greater uncertainty exists con- cerning the other two principals, Nilus (pl. 4a) and Horus (pl. 4b). Both are clearly contrasted in age and vitality, indicating a kind of symbolic opposition not usual in more standardized depictions of the gods. The Horus figure is dressed as a hunter, and has the physiognomy of a satyr.22 His principal attribute has been identified as a yoke or plough-tree, but not a conventional one. Certainly a convincing explanation of the meaning of the scene must account for all of the strange features of this instrument: the spiraling cords, the horned cross-bar, and the shaft.23 5) The use of symbolic gesture by the "Horus" figure. Despite the activity of his pose, Horus (pl. 4b) employs with each hand gestures of power that are conven- tional in Late Antique art, though probably Near Eastern in origin. The left hand held on the grip of a knife or sword worn at the side is quite rare in Classical art, but found commonly in the later Em- pire.24 It is very frequently encountered in Parthian and Sassanian works, and in works produced further to the east.25 6) The use of both Greek and Egyptian style in the same work. In combining the antiquarian Pharaonic-Egyp- tian style used in the depiction of the sphinx with figures in the Greek style, the Tazza is unique.26 Can this be analogous to the Hermetic and magical prac- tice of incorporating untranslated divine "barbarian names"?27 7) The dramatic action of the group. Commentators have generally been circumspect concerning the pre- cise character of the scene, blurring the distinction between myth and allegory. Despite the static distri- bution (particularly noticeable in the arrangement of the three principal figures), scholars have been reluc- tant to characterize the composition as a cult image ("Andachtsbild"). On the other hand, no one has proposed a convincing interpretation of the dramatic action of the group or of the entire scene. Furtwtn- gler's characterization of the image as a representa- tion of "forces that cause and depict the abundant fertility of the Nile" (my emphasis) seems to compro- mise between the two, and has not been challenged. Since the attention of the Satyr and Isis is directed toward the right, dramatic action, normal in mytho- logical iconography, may be inferred: something is happening, or is about to happen.28 Merkelbach's Hypothesis A new interpretation, proposed in a paper of 1973 by Reinhold Merkelbach, offered a significant modi- fication of the Visconti hypothesis, though still falling within its limits (table 1).29 To summarize very briefly, Merkelbach suggested pure Egyptian identities for all of the figures and saw the connection with Greek tradition to lie in an astronomical nomenclature shared by Greeks and Egyptians, the so-called sphaera barbarica. Accordingly, in addition to their divine Egyptian identities, the figures would each represent a constellation (fig. 1), or part of a constellation, cen- tered about the figure of Orion (i.e., the figure that Visconti identified with Horus). In an earlier paper, Merkelbach argued persua- sively that Eratosthenes of Cyrene (fl. 240 B.C.) had been the author of just such an interpretatio aegyptiaca 21 I.e., according to Pharaonic iconography. Thompson 116 notes the absence of her usual attributes. (Robert Bianchi of the Brooklyn Museum informs me that the so-called Isis- knot is not sufficient to identify a figure as Isis.) For a possible reason for the omission of the more individual attributes of Isis, see infra n. 50. 22 The satyresque character of the Horus figure was noted by Furtwingler 254, Bastet 13, and also by Merkelbach 120. 23 See infra n. 227. 24 E.g., in the Tetrarchs on the facade of San Marco in Venice. It is also found commonly in figures of Harpocrates dating from the Roman period. 25 Cf. a sardonyx cameo depicting Valerian and Shapur (ca. A.D. 260) in the Cabinet des Medailles in Paris and a statue of King Uthal (or Athal) from Hatra, both illustrated by T. Kraus, Das r6mische Weltreich (Propylien Kunstge- schichte 2, Berlin 1967) figs. 386c, 400a. 26 I exclude works in the peculiar koine style of Imperial Alexandria like the reliefs of the catacombs of Kom El- Choqafa. It should also be noted that the Hellenizing style of the individual figures is eclectic. The Winds and Horus resemble, in their tensed musculature and sharply angled attitudes, the Gauls from the Pergamene dedication of At- talos, while the women are executed in a softer, Praxitelean style. This is noted by Alf61ldi (supra n. 2) 568-69. I have noted a similar eclecticism based on decorum in the sculpture from Pompeii in "Decorum and the History of Style in Pompeian Sculpture," in R.I.

Yet several of Merkelbach's astronomical parallels are compelling. The similarity of the figure of Horus to the schema of the constellation of Orion is very strik- ing.32 Similarly, the figure of Isis closely resembles the conventional iconography of the constellation of Virgo.33 Dorothy Thompson has noted that Merkel- bach's astrological arguments would be more con- vincing if the work were a product of Imperial times.34 A NEW HYPOTHESIS The Allegory of the Nile Despite the objections listed above, I take the "Vis- conti hypothesis" as a starting point for the decipher- ment of the Tazza's meaning. I also believe that Merkelbach has established two very important new facts. First, there is significant Egyptological content in the iconography of the Tazza. Second, there is a very great likelihood that an astronomical map lies behind the arrangement of the Tazza's figures. Before turning to the Tazza in detail, it is important to examine the general environment of Hellenistic Egypt, where the Greeks encountered a culture and civilization much older than their own. In the first place, the religion of the new country was entirely different from that of the old. Greek culture fostered the mythologization of Greek religion. With the strong personalities of the Greek gods that resulted, Greek religion was especially resistant to the kind of syncretism that played an important part in Egyptian religion. During the Hellenistic period, mainly due to the Greeks' attempts to correlate their own religion with those of barbarian peoples, the personal ethos of Fig. 1.

Merkelbach, "Die Erigone des Eratosthenes: Nach- erzdhlung und Wiirdigung," in Miscellanea di studi alessan- drini in memoria di Augusto Rostagni (Turin 1963) 469-526. An excursus dealt with the strange story of the death of Hesiod, made into an Orion-Osiris fable by Eratosthenes in his poem, Hesiodus. 31 La Rocca 8, contra Merkelbach, writes: "e difficile che un oggetto cosi preziose avere connessione esclusivamente con le piene del Nilo, sia pure in chiave astrale secondo i dettami di Eratostene." 32 Cf. Aratos, Phaenomena 587-89: "Orion, well girt and gleaming with both his shoulders, and trusting in the strength of his sword." The Horus figure is clad as a hunter, has the same attributes as Orion (club [?], belt, sword, and bag), and lacks feet like the constellation. 33 Both are portrayed as a Demeter-type holding the grain spears associated with the Eleusinian goddess. The constel- lation is usually winged. See Thiele 65-66. The constellation is represented by a wingless figure on the circular plani- sphere from Denderah.

A religion of arche- types began to replace that of personality and local tradition. Natural philosophy with its components of cosmology and astrology became the predominant vehicle of religious thought. Astrology, especially, in- troduced a personal and subjective element into a religion that had previously been more socially or civically oriented.35 Ironically, the emergence of a truly "personal religion" among the Greeks was ac- companied by the loss of personality among the tra- ditional divinities, now abstracted by allegory. Alexandria is without doubt the source of the Tazza. It was at Alexandria that the syncretism of the great Asiatic and African religions with that of the Greeks was centered. Recent studies of Hellenistic Egypt have shown that Egyptians as well as Greeks and Asiatics had an important role in transmuting the barbarian wisdom into a Greek koine.36 Certainly the reign of Ptolemy III marked the highpoint in royal attempts to assimilate Egyptian culture into the system of Greek learning. How long this atmosphere continued, and what connection it had with the Roman cultural achievement known as the "Golden Age of Latin Lit- erature," is a matter of some uncertainty. Even less is known about the survival of Alexandrian learning under the Roman Empire. Nevertheless, Late Antique sources, including the writings of the Church Fathers themselves, continue to be of use in illuminating the thought and monuments of much earlier periods and currents in the thought of Alexandria. The intellectual climate that favored the use of such extravagant art as the Tazza comprised Alexandrian poets and astrologers and jewelers, the staples of court life. Nowhere was the art of epic poetry more closely tied to the science of astronomy and the daily reality of court life. Here the theft of a queen's locks might lead to the discovery of a new constellation by the court astronomer and the writing of an epic poem by the court poet. The discovery of an unusually fine stone might lead to the commission for a life-size statue of the queen in topaz.37 Here too the astronom- ical bowl became a commonplace object, to be re- flected in later literature.38 Whether the Tazza was commissioned for a high religious purpose, such as a sacrifice for the New Year, or as a simple objet d'art, we may never know. If my interpretation of the Taz- za's relief is correct the Nile allegory takes its place in the stars, among constellations known from the Greek astronomical sphere and planets that correspond to them. The stars by their positions indicate the time of the beginning of the inundation and they may also indicate the beginning and the end of time itself. This may be sublime philosophy, but it was no doubt fairly conventional court poetry. What follows is both an exposition and an argu- ment, and it is "one of those arguments in which nothing short of the whole story proves the case."39 Accordingly, I begin with "the whole story" before attempting to treat the several levels of allegory con- tained in the work. As Visconti realized, the scene in the interior of the Tazza depicts an allegory of the Nile. As Bastet noted, it is no mere Nile allegory. No natural occurrence was more mysterious to Egyptians and Greeks alike than the regular annual inundation of the Nile.40 From Pharaonic times it had been considered a cosmic event, fully integrated with the movements of the heavenly bodies.41 The Egyptians, who reckoned their seasons by the heliacal (i.e., morning) risings of 36 stars, 100 apart, considered the inundation to begin at the time of the rising of Sirius (i.e., Sothis), the star of Isis.42 Approximately at the same season (depend- ing on the latitude), the constellation of Orion began its annual rising in the night sky from a horizontal position: Osiris rising from the dead.43 The day of the Sothis rising was reckoned as the New Year, and celebrated as a festival. Greek authors speculated on the celestial origins of the Nile, identifying it with the constellation of Eridanus, the heavenly river. Some 35 Pace A.-J.

It has doubtless been thought and expressed by many others. 40 Ancient literary sources pertaining to the inundation have been collected and analyzed by Bonneau. 41 For the idea found in the Hermetic writings that Egypt equals "the image of heaven . . . the temple of the whole world," see Fowden 13, 39.

DWYER [AJA 96 believed that the Nile, like Eridanus, originated from the foot of a giant (i.e., Orion).44 Some believed that it rose in the Mountains of the Moon-by which they may have meant the Moon.45 To those who believed that the Nile and the element of Water originated in Heaven the inundation was also a theurgic event.46 The summer solstice, i.e., the arrival of the Sun at the northernmost point in its annual course, also happened to coincide with one of the two points where the path of the Sun, Moon, and planets crossed the Milky Way. This point was believed the "Gate of Men," or the gate by which souls de- scended from the Milky Way into genesis. As the inundation had actually begun in upper Egypt by this time, it was possible to connect this celestial gate open- ing with the terrestrial one. The annual events thus replicated the divine act of creation at the beginning of time. The Egyptian triad of Osiris, Horus, and Isis could be identified for cosmological purposes with cosmogonic triads of Asia and of Greece, consisting of a remote and inactive Father, his son, an active demiurge, and a Woman, identified with the Earth and Nature itself. Planetary astrology made these the planet Saturn, the Sun, and the Moon. Greek astrol- ogers attempted to correlate the planets with the con- stellations. For the designer of the Tazza Farnese, the constellation of Taurus, associated with the planet Saturn and perhaps identifiable with the Apis bull, became the god Sarapis (Osiris). The constellation of Orion became the solar demiurge, Horus (whose name is synonymous with Kairos). The constellation of Eridanus, associated with the Nile, became Isis- Euthenia, here depicted as a lunar nature goddess. The constellation of Gemini doubled as the planets Jupiter and Mars and as souls lying in the Milky Way. The constellations of the Dogs doubled as the planets Venus and Mercury and as souls in descent. All of these identifications were made in the service of a sublime allegory of cosmogony and the creation of human life. As Horus turns to view the Sun rising in Cancer, Isis offers her breast to souls entering genesis. The sphinx represents the Earth and Ignorance en- joined upon the souls as they drink. In interpreting the Tazza I propose to recognize a number of levels of meaning that are both discrete and interrelated. The operative principles both of my analysis and, I believe, of the Tazza's designer are analogia and hypostasis. Analogia means "proportion," (i.e., quantitative relationship), and also "analogy" (i.e., qualitative relationship). F. Solmsen first dem- onstrated Eratosthenes' remarkable use of analogia in the comparison of certain Greek myths to constella- tion groups in his poetic works.47 Merkelbach studied the comparisons in Eratosthenes' Erigone in depth, though he did not take up the discussion of the nature of analogia.48 In matching the figures that appear in the relief one to one with the constellations-whom they may or may not resemble in their conventional iconography-Merkelbach employed analogia. If yet another layer of identifications (i.e., planetary iden- tities) is to be found in each of these figures, analogia is the principle that binds the separate identities to- gether. In effect, analogia is the underlying principle of religious syncretism. The effect of syncretism or analogia on iconography can take either of two courses. It can result in the combination of signifying attributes in a single figure, such as Amon-Re, who has the attributes of both Amon and Re. Alternatively, it can result in the elimination of attributes not rele- vant to the analogia.49 Isis-Euthenia in the Tazza is minus a sistrum, for example, because that attribute would not be relevant to her other identities such as 44 Bonneau 230-31 for the tradition of the giant's foot. This must refer to the fact that Eridanus originates from the left foot of Orion. Another tradition held that the Nile sprang from the urn held by the constellation of Aquarius. See Bonneau 230-31. 45 Bonneau 167, 204 n. 5. 46 This is the Pharaonic Egyptian explanation. The pri- meval waters were called "Noun," also used of the Nile. The Greeks rendered "Noun" as "Ocean." See Bonneau 143-50; 238-39: "les explications de la crue du Nil par une origine oceanique avaient un point de depart egyptien." 47 "Eratosthenes' Erigone: A Reconstruction," TAPA 78 (1947) 252-75. 48 Merkelbach (supra n. 30). F. Solmsen ("Eratosthenes as Platonist and Poet," TAPA 73 [1942] 192-213) believed that analogia was quantifiable for Eratosthenes, relating it to musical intervals. This is demonstrable in the case of Era- tosthenes' Hermes, where the god's cosmic lyre is attuned to the music of the spheres. A remarkable passage in Martianus Capella (De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii 169-99) describes the ascent of Philology through the planetary spheres by means of the musical intervals, and is perhaps to be related to ideas expressed by Eratosthenes. (In an interesting ad- aptation of Eratosthenes' Hermes, Diodorus Siculus [Bibl. 1.16.1] mentions an Egyptian Hermes who played a three- stringed lyre, tuned to the three seasons of the Egyptian year. In this case a quantitative analogia is supposed to exist in the passage of time, an idea that is worthy of Eratosthenes. It is interesting to note that the mythological events described in the Erigone end with the rising of the Dog-star, just when the allegory of the inundation begins. (Eratosthenes also connected the three seasons of the year with the ages of man. See FGrHist II B 241.47.) In any case, analogia can also be qualitative: a simple comparison of phenomena ad- duced to show a similarity of causality. Aristotle seems to have been the first to use analogia in a non-quantitative sense (HA 486b.19). 49 The subjects of analogy and its opposite, anomaly, were of considerable interest to Stoics of the third century B.C. like Chrysippos.</page><page sequence="9">1992] THE TEMPORAL ALLEGORY OF THE TAZZA FARNESE 263 the Moon.50 I believe this principle (i.e., the reductive one) is applied carefully by the designer of the Tazza. Hypostasis normally means "substance," the under- lying matter or concept from which a secondary con- cept has been derived.51 The Pythagoreans thought that all numbers were derived from unity, the Monad. Hence, the number "one" was the hypostasis of all the rest of the numbers. It was also, they argued, con- tained in each of the subsequent numbers as the principle of the unity of the number itself. In this way, the original substance, or hypostasis, is perpetu- ated in its creatures. The English use of the term hypostasis derives from a more specialized meaning in the Greek Fathers. In English the word may mean "personality, personal existence, person: distin- guished from substance, as in three 'hypostases' or 'persons' of the Godhead, which are said to be the same in 'substance'.""52 Despite the late date for the usage of this term in Greek, we may recognize in its use a concept especially applicable to the study of Egyptian religion and to Hellenistic religious syncre- tism. Indeed, many modern authors who deal with these subjects use the term "hypostasis" in this later sense. The figures of the Tazza's design constitute a hierarchy of successive hypostases. The gigantic Nilus has two hypostases: Isis-Euthenia and Horus. Each of them in turn has two hypostases, a masculine pair for Horus and a feminine pair for Isis-Euthenia. A hy- postasis must, therefore, be considered as one of a number of aspects or natures of the figure from which it originates. Hence, the femininity of Isis is present in the bisexuality of the god from which she origi- nates. Hermetic Cosmogony: Poimandres Illustrated The fact that the inundation of the Nile should be associated with the creation of the world, and with the creation of human life, is consistent with Egyptian religion and attractive to Greek speculative philoso- phy. The connection of the Nile and its overflow with the creation of life was paradigmatic in ancient sci- ence. Life was thought to originate in the shallow pools left by the receding river, solely from the fertil- izing action of the water upon the silt. In a way the inundation was also a kind of test case for Greek astrology, which sought the rational causes for earthly phenomena in celestial motions.53 Although the pri- macy of Water among the elements had been main- tained by earlier Greek philosophers, Plutarch is most explicit in combining this belief with the myth of the inundation in his treatise Isis and Osiris. Osiris (whom he identifies with Kronos54 and Dionysos55) is the principle of moisture itself: ". .. Osiris is the Nile consorting with the Earth, which is Isis, ... the sea is Typhon into which the Nile discharges its waters and is lost to view and dissipated, save for that part which the Earth takes up and absorbs and thereby becomes fertilized.'"56 Dryness, the opposite of moisture, is in- imical to life.5' On the other hand, Water is the nour- ishment and origin of the heavenly bodies them- selves.58 The transition from the specific natural phenome- non of the Nile to a generalized cosmogony was made in Egyptian religion by hypothesizing Khnum (or Atum or Ptah), the primordial god, as a potter who produced the rest of the gods out of clay (i.e., Water and Earth).59 In the Hermetic Corpus this originally Egyptian cosmogony has been Platonized into a dy- namic triad of a Father (=Light), a Woman (=Dark- ness, moist Nature), and a Son (Logos) created by the Father.60 (The Father provides the will and the intel- lect necessary to accomplish the job; the Woman pro- vides the material; the Son provides the forms.) In the dialogue that goes under the name of Poimandres, the speaker describes a remarkable vision of the cre- ation of the universe.61 Beginning with Light (i.e., the 50 Cf.

DWYER [AJA 96 Father, the Monad), there comes into existence a formless Darkness (i.e., the Mother, the Dyad) that sinks to the bottom, becoming a sort of moist Nature that shakes and emits smoke and noise. Nature then emits an inarticulate cry, as if for help. Created from the Light, the Logos (i.e., the Son) assails Nature, causing the separation of the element of Fire from moisture. The Fire rises upward, together with the element of Air, leaving behind the elements of Earth and Water (indiscriminately mixed). Earth and Water are then activated by the Logos.62 Hence, the first seven beings to emerge in this cosmic picture are Light, Nature, Logos, Fire, Air, Earth, and Water. Fire and Air rise. Earth and Water remain below, unseparated.63 The correspondence of Poimandres I 4-5 with the scene of the Tazza is so close as to suggest that the latter is illustrative of the text: Light (Nous I) Nilus Nature Isis Logos Horus Fire Leading Wind (Shu) Air Following Wind (Tefnut) Water and Earth Seasons (Satis and Anuket) Beginning at the left of the composition, the text identifies the original deity with the hermaphroditic cosmic Mind (Nous), god of life and light.64 Taking the inundation to signify the Creation, Nilus, under- stood as the senior divinity of the allegory, the one responsible for the flood in the beginning, corre- sponds to the Father, the original monad. The designer of the Tazza chose a fatherly type for this divinity (C, pl. 4a). The laxity of his body and the slump of his head suggest Dionysos,65 though they would also be appropriate for the dead Osiris. It may be that the Greek artist has interpreted the Egyptian god of the dead as Hades, whose iconography is sim- ilar especially in the guise of Plouton or Aion Plou- tonios.66 His advanced age and torpor also suggest his identification with Kronos.67 In fact, all of these Greek divinities have been identified with Osiris, especially in his later form as Sarapis.68 There is, however, one minor Greek divinity-also connected with Sarapis- who is especially close to this figure, from the points of view of iconography and of cult: Agathos Daimon ("the Good Demon"). Several of those who have con- tributed to the Visconti hypothesis have commented on the iconographic similarities of the two figures.69 Even more than the iconographic parallels, however, the evidence of cult suggests that Agathos Daimon should be represented here in the figure of "Nilus." Of the seven branches of the Nile, the one that nur- tured Alexandria was called "Agathos Daimon."70 As noted by F. Dunand, Agathos Daimon in his Alexan- drian phase is likely to be identified with the Egyptian Khnum, creator of the gods and closely associated with the Nile.71 Though his cult could be found throughout pharaonic Egypt, he had an important temple on the island of Elephantine in the first cata- ract, where he was worshipped as Nile god together with his two consorts, Satis and Anuket." Thus the fatherly god of the Tazza is both the Nile in a literal sense and the progenitor of all the rest of the gods (including himself).73 On the Tazza, his consorts are 1) himself, 2) the Isis figure as part of the major triad,74 and, 3) extending the group to include the four minor figures, the two Seasons (Satis and Anuket, one of which [Satis] is a double of Isis). 62 Unfortunately the text is corrupt at this point. 63 Supra n. 61, chs. 4-5. 64 Supra n. 61, ch. 6. 65 Thompson 116. On the cult of Dionysos in Alexandria, and the Greek god's identification with Osiris (and Sarapis), see Fraser I, 201-207. 66 Cf. Furtwangler 255. 67 His iconography is actually closer to that of Kronos in Classical art than to that of Sarapis in later images. On the drunkenness of Kronos, the prelude to his binding by Zeus, see Porph. De Antr. Nymph. 16. The torpor is, of course, also appropriate to Dionysos. Thompson 116, 120 would connect this with Virgil's description of "mourning Nilus" (Aen. 8.711; see infra). 68 E.g., Bastet 21 refers to the Tazza figure as "Osiris- Pluto-Dionysos." Bonneau 319-24 notes the association of Sarapis with the inundation, but observes that Greeks visiting Egypt generally distinguished the two gods. Fraser I, 206, notes that Dionysiac subjects played an important part in the Hellenistic decoration (early third century B.C.) of the Ser- apeum at Memphis, where the Apis bulls were buried. 69 Cf. Furtwangler 255, noting the similarity of the empty horn with Attic representations [of the Hellenistic period] of Agathos Daimon and Pluton. Alfoldi (supra n. 2) esp. 569, noted the empty horn in identifying the Tazza figure as Eleusinian Pluto, "father of Aion Ploutonios, protector of Alexandria" (doubtless in a historical sense!). On Agathos Daimon, see LIMC I, 277-82, s.v. Agathodaimon (F. Dun- and). 70 Bernand 82-99. 71 LIMC I, 277. Khnum (French: Chnoum) is known in Greek as Knephis. 72 See Bonneau 232-34; Festugiere I, 300; J.-J. Fauvel et al., Egypte: le Nil ?gyptien et soudanais du delta a Khartoum (Les guides bleus, Paris 1979) 630-31. Satis was identified with Isis; Anuket with Nephthys in the Osiritic legend. 73 According to a late tradition, the first king of the Egyp- tians was Hephaistos, followed by Sol, Agathos Daimon, Kronos, Osiris, Typhon, and Horus. See Eus. Chron. 133- 35, cited in T. Hopfner, Fontes historicae religionis Aegyptiacae I (Bonn 1922-1925) 66; Bernand 96. 74 The cult of Agathos Daimon was paired both in Greece and in Egypt with the cult of Agathe Tyche ("Good For- tune"). Alexandrian monuments of the Roman period rep- resent the two as serpents clearly identified with the gods Sarapis and Isis-Thermouthis. See LIMC I, 277; Bonneau</page><page sequence="11">1992] THE TEMPORAL ALLEGORY OF THE TAZZA FARNESE 265 Although trees of various kinds can be associated with most, if not all, of the major Greek divinities, a figure such as this resting in a tree is not common in the iconography of the major deities, and would nor- mally indicate a divinity of a specific place. "Nilus" would satisfy this definition.75 The tree in which he sits must be the persea of Osiris, a tree of the same family as the laurel and the olive, known for its in- ability to grow anywhere but along the Nile.v6 Yet another specific meaning is conveyed here by the tree: the divinity is in the tree because he is not on the earth. He belongs to the higher realm of the heav- ens.77 The large horn held by the figure no doubt indicates that he is a beneficent power.78 His gift is likely to be either water or wine, since the horn ap- pears to be a drinking horn.79 By an act of the Father's will, Nature (=Isis-Eu- thenia) splits apart from him, resulting in a pair of antithetical beings, the Light above and the Darkness below, Intellect and Matter. The woman identified by Visconti and many after him as Isis (B, pl. 6a) wears a garment reminiscent of that worn by Ptolemaic queens, though unlike them she is bare-breasted.80 She rests on the back of the sphinx like Europa on the back of the bull.8' Her pose and her attributes, the grain spears that she holds in her right hand, indicate an intimate connection with the fertility of the earth. Her pose and her attributes suggest identification or association with Demeter,82 or Rhea.8" Hecate is also possible.84 On the basis of Alexandrian coins of the Roman Empire, she has been identified specifically with Euthenia, clearly in Alex- andria a hypostasis of Isis.85 Continuing with the allegory of creation, then the Father created a Son, the Logos, who proceeded with the work of creation out of Nature, who in turn became enamored of him. The figure in the Tazza who has been called "Horus-Triptolemos" (D, pl. 4b) must be the Son-Logos of the Poimandres. Although the Egyptianizing interpretation of the Tazza relief has favored his identification as Horus, the divine successor of his dead father, he should also be iden- tified with another son of Osiris, Thoth. The latter was the steward of Osiris in the Underworld, and was (together with Osiris himself) regarded as the inven- tor of all useful arts. He was the assistant to Nilus, who played an important part in releasing the river's flood.86 Thoth was considered by the Greeks as the 241. I believe that the Isis figure of the Tazza is intended to represent Agathe Tyche, and is intended as his consort, inasmuch as a self-sufficient divinity has need of a consort. The Isis of the Tazza has been connected on stylistic and iconographic grounds with representations of Ptolemaic queens in the guise of Agathe Tyche. See D.B. Thompson, Ptolemaic Oinochoai and Portraits in Faience (Oxford 1973) 19; La Rocca 45. 75 Comparisons adduced by Bonneau, pls. V-VI, leave no doubt that "Nilus" is the correct identification. See Bonneau 327-28: "c'est un Sarapis sans modius et devetu; c'est un Nil deja, mais il n'a encore ni roseau, ni lotus." See also M.-O. Jentel, "La representation du Dieu Nil sur les peintures et les mosaiques et leur contexte architectural," EchCl 31, n.s. 6 (1987) 209-16. Examples of Nilus and Euthenia from the late first century B.C. illustrated by Jentel show Nilus posing the fructifying rhyton toward the lap of Euthenia-offering a clue to the complex grouping in the Tazza. 76 For Nilus as Osiris, see Plut. Mor. 363 D. Plutarch described the persea as having a leaf like a tongue and a fruit like a heart (Mor. 378 C). The persea is now identified as Mimusops laurifolia. See I. Friis, "The Taxonomy and Distribution of Mimusops laurifolia (Sapotaceae)," Kew Bul- letin 35 (1981) 785-92. The olive, a related species, can also claim to be the cosmic tree (Porph. De Antr. Nymph. 32-33), but it was not successfully cultivated in Egypt. Alfoldi's com- ment (supra n. 2) 569 that the tree in the Tazza "has nothing to do with the Nile" is unwarranted. 77 For the importance of trees and the suspension of offerings from trees in signifying the element of air, see Servius, In Georg. 2.389 [App. III of E. Dwyer, "Pompeian Oscilla Collections," RM 88 (1981) 247-306]. (This is consis- tent with Dionysos as Nilus, where the tree signifies the usual means of separating the vinestock from the earth.) Cf. Varro: "The first gods were Sky (Caelum) and Earth. These gods are the same as Serapis and Isis of Egypt-though Harpo- crates signals me with his finger to be silent. The same first gods in Latium are Saturn and Ops. For Earth and Sky, as the mysteries of the Samothracians teach, are great gods" (Samothrace 1 175). 78 Bonneau 239-41. 79 Quaranta 9; Alf6ldi (supra n. 2) 569. Thompson, 116, also notes that the horn is empty, and waiting to be filled. It is indeed empty of fruits, but whether the horn is empty of liquid or not depends upon the interpretation of the scene. "8 Cf. La Rocca 22-64. The "Isis-knot" between her breasts is an exceptionally good example of this convention that imitates the Egyptian ankh symbol. Its symbolic meaning cannot be gainsaid here. The diadem, worn by queens, can also be worn by divinities like Rhea and Hekate (Hymn. Hom. Cer. 25, 459). On the curls worn with the headband, see La Rocca 22-64 and Bonneau 259-63. 81 The woman in the Tazza is significantly different in this respect from the goddess depicted in the statuette in Alex- andria (infra n. 148 and fig. 3).

DWYER [AJA 96 equivalent of their Hermes.87 The designer of the Tazza probably intended to signify Hermes in the figure of Horus by means of the twin crests of wing- like hair and the staff that alludes to the kerykeion (i.e., caduceus), recalling two of the most prominent attri- butes of the god Hermes.88 From Nature, the Logos created Fire and Air89 (= the Winds), who resemble him as hypostases,90 and the Seasons (Water and Earth), who resemble Nature and are hypostases of her. The figures of the Winds (i.e., Fire and Air) form a close pair (E and F, pl. 5a), indicating the fellowship of these elements: "and the air, being light, followed the spirit, as it ascended from earth and water up to the fire, so that it seemed to me to be hanging from it.""' The designer has por- trayed the winds/elements as playful satyrs.92 To an Alexandrian, these figures would have suggested the Samothracian gods, popularly identified with the Dioscuri who acted as favoring winds.93 The figures of the Seasons (i.e., Water and Earth), by contrast, make a reversed, complementary pair (G and H, pl. 5b).94 Together with the Isis figure they make a triad.95 Merkelbach identified them as the Egyptian goddesses Satis and Anuket, consorts of the creator god, Khnum. The Poimandres goes on to tell how the Father produced by means of speech (i.e., Logos) a second, demiurgic Mind (Nous demiourgos), who, in turn, cre- ated the seven "governors" (i.e., planets), which were themselves ruled by Fate.96 Then the Logos united with the demiurgic Mind, leaving the lower elements, in order to create the moving framework of the heav- ens and the rest of creation.97 There then follows, in the Poimandres, an account of the creation of the archetypal Man by the cosmic Mind (Nous I) him- self.98 Once created, archetypal man (Anthropos) re- peats the creative acts (including the propagation of human life) of his divine predecessor, demiurgic Mind-Logos.99 The treatise ends with an eschatological section that describes the return of the human soul through the circles of the seven governors (i.e., planets), abandon- 87 On the identification of Thoth with Hermes (and his role in the inundation), see Bonneau 234-36; Fraser II, 353-54. In a memorable passage on the inundation of the Nile, Lucan calls Mercury the "arbiter" of the flood. See Luc. Pharsalia 10.209, 214-15. In the Samothracian religion he was called Casmilus and identified also with Cadmus, like Thoth, inventor of letters.

See also Alfoldi (supra n. 2) 568 on the style of the three figures, whose tense muscula- ture contrasts markedly (and deliberately) with that of the women. The fact that the heads of the first Wind and Horus are, except for their size, identical has received surprisingly little comment. The first Wind, i.e., the first element (Fire- aither), is the primary hypostasis. He represents the being from which he originates either by himself or as the first element in a pair. 91 Poimandres 5. The translation is from W. Foerster, Gnosis: A Selection of Gnostic Texts I: Patristic Evidence, trans. R.M. Wilson (Oxford 1972) 329. 92 Furtwangler 254. The depiction of individual winds as a close pair defies logic and is therefore not found elsewhere, where the simple meaning of winds is desired. See infra n. 166. 93 Fraser I, 207. On the role of the Dioscuri in controlling the winds, see, e.g., Diod. Bibl. 4.34.1-2 (Samothrace I, 229b). The gods were represented by a pair of Ithyphallic youths who looked heavenward. "In the Anaktoron of the Samo- thracians there stand two statues of naked men with both their hands stretched up toward heaven and their pudenda turned up, just as in the statue of Hermes on Cyllene. The aforesaid statues are images of the primal man and of the regenerating spirit in every respect consubstantial with that man." (Hippol. Haer. 5.8.9-10 [Samothrace I, 147].) This passage and many others appear to connect the Samothra- cian religion with the allegory of the Tazza. 94 Noted by Lippold (supra n. 14). Compare the figures of Earth and a water god opposite her on the silver patera from Parabiago in the Brera. The patera is illustrated in W.F. Volbach and M. Hirmer, Early Christian Art (New York 1961) pl. 107. The closest stylistic parallels for the Tazza figures come from a well-known series of Arretine vases that depict couples making love. 95 Caligula depicted his sisters, Drusilla, Agrippina, and Julia, as a triad with attributes of Isis on a sestertius minted in the first year of his principate.

The Poimandres, on the other hand, makes the point that the bisexuality of the Father is continued in each of his hypostases and in each of theirs. This remained the case until the end of a kind of golden age, when, "the period [being] completed the bond of all things was undone by God's decree. All the beasts, which were bisexual, were together with the man divided, and they became on the one hand male and on the other hand female. And straight away God spoke with a holy word: "Increase and multiply ....101 The scene in the Tazza may thus represent the hypostases either after the introduction of single sexuality, or it may represent them as origi- nally, but with sexuality implied.'02 The Planets The next level of the allegory brings the subject closer to the present. In a way that is not explained by the Poimandres, the principal beings in the cos- mogony have left their imprints upon later hypos- tases, namely, the planets. Whether this represents actual Hermetic (or Samothracian) doctrine or is just a matter of artistic convenience must remain an open question for now. The choice of seven figures is not arbitrary. According to a sentence in another Her- metic tractate, the Asclepius, man has been placed upon earth "in order to wonder at and to adore the heavens."'03 Contemplation of the world leads to knowledge of God. If I interpret the picture correctly, the seven governors (i.e., the planets) created by the demiurgic Mind represent a further unfolding of the three original principles plus the four elements in one-to-one correspondence: Light (Nous I) Saturn Logos Sun Nature Moon Fire Jupiter Air Mars Water Venus Earth Mercury The seven planets ("the seven governors") are thus grouped together schematically with the creative prin- ciples that appeared in the beginning of time. Begin- ning with Saturn as the Father, the addition of the Sun and the Moon forms a principal triad. Secondary triads consist of a masculine group'04 allied with the Sun and a feminine group'05 allied with the Moon: Bisexual Masculine Feminine Saturn Sun Moon Jupiter Venus Mars Mercury "Nilus"-Saturn (Gk: Phainon; star of Kronoso06), (C, pl. 4a). The senior divinity must be identified as the slowest, and therefore oldest, of the planets. Plu- tarch associated Kronos with Oceanus, i.e., the out- ermost limits.'07 The Neo-Platonists associated him with Nous, the principle of Intellect.08os The identifi- cation of the senior figure in the Tazza with the god Kronos (Saturn) has often been suggested. An iden- tification of Nilus = Sarapis = Kronos is possible.'09 The Greek name for the planet, Phainon ("the Shiner"), corresponds well to the Hermetic character- ization of the Father as Light. "Horus"-Sun (Gk: Helios), (D, pl. 4b). His flaming hair might be taken as an allusion to the winged helmet of Hermes, but it also indicates an affinity with 100 Poimandres, chs. 24-26. 101 Poimandres, ch. 18. 102 M. Delcourt discusses the Poimandres in Hermaphrodite: Myths and Rites of the Bisexual Figure in Classical Antiquity, trans. J. Nicholson (London 1961) 77-79. Earlier in her essay (p. 71), Delcourt noted that "Chrysippus [third century B.C.] and his disciples cautioned their readers against too literal an interpretation of allegorical bisexuality; it is ridiculous to give a human form to gods and, what is more, impossible; there are no male and female gods; masculine names are given to the powers of action, feminine names to the powers of increase" (emphasis mine). Chrysippus's Stoic system seems quite consistent with the Tazza, and, as we shall see infra, with astrology. 103 Asclepius 8. See Festugiekre II, 58. 104 Astrologers considered the exterior planets, Jupiter and Mars (as well as the Sun and Saturn), masculine.

See Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 102.

The leading Wind is especially close in his physi- ognomy to the figure of Horus, indicating a special connection with the Sun.116 The Greek name for the planet Jupiter is "Phaethon."

The sphinx of the Tazza is a central figure in the composition as a whole, and not simply an attribute of the woman.'23 Unlike the other figures in the composition, the sphinx is firmly planted, and, in fact, serves as the base of the composition that includes Isis, Horus, and Nilus. The sphinx is the groundline. It should be identified with the land of Egypt, and, by metonymy, the Earth."24 To Philo Judaeus, writing in Alexandria about the middle of the first century A.C., the land of Egypt 110 It divides, in fact, into "twin flames [crests]" (geminae flammae [cristae]), recalling a peculiar feature in the appear- ance of both Aeneas and Romulus at different times in the Aeneid (6.779-80; 8.680).

The whole episode in Nonnos bears comparison with the scene in the Tazza. According to G. Knaack (in Roscher III, 2175-2201, s.v.

The iconog- raphy of these figures will be discussed below. 123 Although the statuette (see infra, fig. 3) from Alexan- dria offers a close iconographical parallel to the reclining woman and the sphinx of the Tazza, the relation of the two elements, recliner and support, is not precisely the same in both monuments. See infra n. 148. 124 The crocodile was the normal symbol for the land of Egypt in Graeco-Roman iconography. The sphinx, now a common symbol for Egypt on coins and postage stamps, was less commonly used to signify Egypt in antiquity. It must, however, perform this function in representations of Eu- thenia on Alexandrian coins and here. See LIMC IV (supra n. 85). See also Thompson 122.</page><page sequence="15">1992] THE TEMPORAL ALLEGORY OF THE TAZZA FARNESE 269 was frequently allegorized as the body in the sense of a prison or tomb of the soul.125 There is also reason to believe that the sphinx here connotes the presence of a riddle.126 Merkelbach's Hypothesis Modified: The Constellations One of the most important questions for ancient astrologers was the relationship of the planets to the background of the fixed stars. Astrological doctrine assigned to each of the planets a "domicile" or house that was believed to be the part of the zodiac in which that particular planet had been created, i.e., its origi- nal position in the order of creation. Hence, no cos- mogony that includes the planets can be complete without indicating their relationship to the sphere of the fixed stars. In his identifications of the figures of the Tazza Farnese, Merkelbach has made the assumption that in its composition the scene of the Tazza generally resembles the positions of the proposed astronomical figures on a star map (fig. 1). Yet Merkelbach's pro- posed identifications require a considerable re- arrangement and adjustment of scale in order to fit the figures to the constellations. I believe, on the contrary, that the composition of the Tazza is based on an actual planisphere and that the congruence of the proposed figures should be mathematically cor- rect. I believe, moreover, that the map has been drawn to indicate a specific time (the summer solstice). In the space that remains, I will attempt to show that the affinities with other constellations that Merkelbach noted, and which led him to other conclusions, can be explained by philosophical and poetic doctrines maintained by Eratosthenes. Furthermore, the same doctrines permitted Eratosthenes (or a follower) to make iconographical inventions suited to his poetic allegory. On the assumption that the composition of the Tazza represents a planisphere, I have made the map that appears in figure 2.127 My new identifications of the constellations are summarized in table 2. The summer solstice occurs on 21 June of the Julian calendar. Eudoxos of Knidos placed it in the middle of the sign of Cancer (i.e., 150 measured on the eclip- tic).'28 Later astronomers placed it ahead, to the first or to the eighth degrees. According to the "precession of the equinoxes," it moved ahead by itself at a rate of one degree in 72 years. The Decree of Canopus (238 B.C.) gives a date for the inundation that has been equated with 19 July of the Julian calendar.'29 This corresponds to the end of Cancer and the begin- ning of Leo.'30 In fact, the inundation began earlier in Upper Egypt and later in Lower Egypt.'31 Thus the inundation could certainly be thought to have begun about the time of the solstice.'32 125 E.g., Quis rerum divinarum heres 315; De migratione Abrahami 16-24. 126 Greek tradition, which also must be allowed here, as- sociated the sphinx with the riddle of human life and the price of ignorance. As such, it became the protector of concealed religious truth. See especially, Pseudo-Kebes, Pi- nax ch. 4: "For Ignorance (Aphrosyne) is a (the?) sphinx to men"; further, Plut. De Is. et Os. 9 (Mor. 354 C). For possible association of the sphinx with sibylline prophecies in first- century B.C. Rome, see 0. Brendel, "Novus Mercurius," RM 50 (1935) 246; Alfoldi 1975 (supra n. 10) 188. 127 The map represented in fig. 2 is a centric or gnomonic projection, well known to ancient cartographers. From the vantage point of the center of the sphere, a section of the sphere (and its stars) has been projected on a flat plane. In this type of projection, great circles on the sphere become straight lines. This type of map is very useful to astrologers for determining the rising time of a given star for a city of a given latitude. In the map in fig. 2 the projection point on the celestial sphere is the eighth degree of Cancer, which was the approximate location of the summer solstice during the period 100 B.C.-A.D. 100, to which the Tazza has usually been dated. By a simple measurement, it can be determined that at this time the morning rising of the star Sirius coin- cided with the summer solstice at lat. 210 N, i.e., well south of Aswan. In later years, due to the precession of the equi- noxes, the two astronomical events were even further apart. While Merkelbach's constellations are drawn as if seen by an observer stationed on the earth, my constellations are drawn as they would appear on the surface of a celestial sphere, i.e., as seen by an observer stationed outside of the emperion. Figures of constellations and whole planispheres that have come down in manuscript use either convention. 128 See Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 129, n. 1, for a summary of the different locations of the Equinoxes and Solstice points in antiquity. 129 See Bernand 989-1036, esp. 1019; Merkelbach 118, n. 8. 130 Plutarch (Mor. 366) places the rising of Sirius and the beginning of the inundation in the sign of Leo. 131 Earlier in this century the following data were observed by W.E. Garstin: "At Khartoum the Nile is lowest in April and May and highest in Aug. and September.... At Assuan the Nile is at its lowest at the end of May, then rises slowly until the middle ofJuly, and rapidly throughout Aug., reach- ing its maximum at the beginning of Sept.; it then falls slowly through Oct. and November. At Cairo the lowest level is reached about the middle of June, after which the rise is slow in July and fairly rapid in Aug., reaching the maximum at about the beginning of October" (Encyclopaedia Britan- nica'4 [1929] 16, 454 s.v. Nile). It is clear from this account that the inundation would have been understood (also in antiquity) as proceeding from the south where it would have begun well before the Solstice. Bonneau 31-32 considers Memphis to have been the determinative point for the cal- endar. 132 Bonneau 30-33; Stegemann 60.</page><page sequence="16">270 EUGENE J.

Correlation of interior of Tazza with constellations (Dwyer) The inundation lasted about four months. At this time of the year the constellation of Orion could be observed just before dawn rising above the horizon in a prone position, suggesting the resurrection of the mummiform Osiris (with Isis-Sirius following).'33 In the next three months, as the Sun passed through the contiguous signs of Leo, Virgo, and Libra, Orion began his nightly rising earlier and earlier. When the Sun entered the sign of Scorpio (and the inundation subsided or had begun to subside), Orion was already well across the sky at sunrise, and was headed for his grave in the west.'34 At this point it is necessary to return to Merkelbach's attribution of the Tazza's iconographical program to Eratosthenes. The combination of a celestial map with a poetic allegory is entirely consistent with what we know of this great Alexandrian Platonic philosopher, poet, and scientist. While he believed in presenting 133 Cf. Aratos Phaen. 577-89: "[with the rise of Cancer] ... Orion with glittering belt and shining shoulders and trusting in the might of his sword, and bringing all the River, rises from . .. the East." 1"3 Hence the legend that the Scorpion was the agent of Orion's death.

He thus laid the groundwork for Mani- lius: "This is the scheme which unveils the powers of the mysterious universe: it divides the heavens in more ways than one so that the names of the signs recur; the more frequent the occurrence, the closer is the association of the signs . . . but the signs are mixers and acquire further influences from their fellow- ships [emphasis mine]."'136 What Manilius wrote about the decans might also be written about the rest of the stars. It is thus by means of a visual or iconographical similarity that, in the spirit of Eratosthenes, the designer of the Tazza can express an occult affinity between the constella- tions of Eridanus and Virgo.'37 (In a similar way, for example, others have made connections between Ori- on and Bootes.' 8) In the paragraphs that follow, I shall attempt to identify each of the figures in Visconti's Nile allegory with a somewhat expanded and syncretized Graeco- Egyptian pantheon, and I shall attempt to correlate each with one of the constellations about Orion.

This analogy, found in Hesychius (ca. A.D. 370), may be present in the Tazza as it appears to derive from a common identification with Horus. Merkelbach (su- pra n. 30) identified Erigone with Virgo (Isis) and Icarius with Bootes (Osiris), and proceeded to note the analogous derivation of Eratosthenes' Hesiodus from both the Orion myth and the myth of Isis and Osiris. 139 Cf.

Sat. 1.18.22. 140 This side is usually the left side of the figure (i.e., when he is seen from the inside of the heavenly sphere). Some manuscripts, however, show him in the same view as the Tazza. See, e.g., the figure of Orion in a manuscript of Hyginus, De sideribus tractatus in the Spencer Collection, New York Public Library, published in G.S. Snyder, Maps of the Heavens (New York 1984) 31, pl. 11. 141 Given the castration theme that is found in the Osiris myth and its Greek counterparts, it may stand for the mem- brum virile of the father. Cf. Nonnos, Dion. 12.41-49, where the metaphor is used of Kronos's father. 142 Merkelbach 120. The satyresque appearance had al- ready been noted by Furtwingler 255. Merkelbach sup- ported his argument with Franz Boll's identification of Orion with a constellation known as "the Satyr" in some astrological manuscripts, thus suggesting that at least some Orions were satyresque in appearance. See Boll 284-91. For the identi- fication of the giant, Nimrod (Genesis 10:9)-whose name in Greek, Nebrodes ("fawn-like"), might suggest one clothed in the nebris-see RE 17 (1936-1937) 624-28 (K.

F 9891) the constellation showed the figure with a scepter. Greek astrologers who follow the Egyptian tradition describe Orion as having a kerykeion, or herald's staff, in one hand and a sword in the other.143 Clearly these authors describe a figure very similar to the one de- picted on the Tazza.'44 (The staff held by the Horus of the Tazza could easily be described as a rationalized kerykeion.) The kerykeion and the pouch connect the Egyptianizing Greek Orion of the texts and the Orion of the Tazza with Hermes.'45 Isis (B, pl. 6a). Merkelbach connects the figure identified as Isis-Euthenia with the constellation of Canis Major (i.e., the star, Sirius-Sothis). I suggest that she be associated with Eridanus, the Nile, which issues from the left foot of Orion.146 The association of Euthenia with Eridanus is surprising, since the con- stellation is represented as a typical masculine river- god in most astronomical manuscripts.'4 Although the figure on the Tazza suggests more a divinity of the earth than a river, a marble statuette in the 143 Boll 167-68. Orion is always thought of as having a sword (xiphos). See Thiele 119-21. On the sack of Orion, see K. Kerenyi, Dionysos: Archetypal Image of Indestructible Life (Bollingen Series 65, 2) trans. R. Manheim (Princeton 1976) 42-43. The interpretation of the staff as a kerykeion implies syncretism with Hermes. In the rectangular zodiac from Denderah, Orion stands in his bark respiciens, as in the Tazza. See Boll, pl. IV. 144 In astronomical texts there is frequent confusion of the directions "right" and "left," as in "right hand" or "left hand." This confusion rises from the use of two types of star maps: those that show the stars (and constellations) as they are seen from the earth (where the directions east and west are reversed) and those that show the stars and constellations as they might be seen by an observer stationed outside the sphere of the fixed stars (i.e., a celestial sphere). Either type of map can be made on a sphere or on a projection plane (i.e., a planisphere). A figure that faces the observer stationed outside of the sphere of the fixed stars will have its back to an observer stationed within the sphere (i.e., on the earth). Orion is sometimes shown with his back to the observer; sometimes facing the observer. Sometimes he raises his right arm; sometimes his left. The planisphere of the Tazza is a view from outside the sphere. 145 In addition to Hermes Trismegistus, one must be re- minded here of Eratosthenes' cosmological poem, Hermes, which inspired Cicero's Somnium Scipionis. See J.U. Powell, Collectanea Alexandrina (Oxford 1925) 58-63. 146 For Eridanus = the Nile, see Eratosth. [Cat.], ed. C. Robert (1878 [repr. Berlin 1963]) 178-79; for its origin from the left foot of Orion, see 176. The star Rigel (13-Orionis) marks the left foot of Orion and is common to the constel- lation of Eridanus. See Aratos Phaen. 361. Eridanus is called the "River of Orion" by Hipparchos, Proclus, and others (Allen 217). Merkelbach 121, n. 38, notes that the left leg of Orion was honored as a relic at Philae. 147 Thiele 124-26. Allen 217, however, mentions the "Hy- ginus of 1488 [which] substitutes the figure of a nude woman, with stars lining the lower bank." In some maps, like the Farnese Globe, the constellation appears as a river and not as an allegorical figure. See Stegemann 79.</page><page sequence="19">1992] THE TEMPORAL ALLEGORY OF THE TAZZA FARNESE 273 Graeco-Roman Museum in Alexandria, which is closely related iconographically, is unmistakably a river (fig. 3).148 Some additional insight into why the Tazza's de- signer portrayed Isis-Euthenia as the heavenly river may come from an analogia to another heavenly river, the Milky Way. Eridanus is also a name used for the Milky Way by Nonnos.'49 Undoubtedly the reason why Isis's breasts are (contrary to her usual iconog- raphy) bared in the Tazza is that she is meant to be portrayed as a nursing mother. Several ancient com- mentators on Aratos held that the galactic circle orig- inated from the milk of a divine mother, Juno or Ops (Rhea).'50 From the Hermetic point of view both god- desses are easily understandable as hypostases of Na- ture. (The Milky Way plays an important part in the allegory of the descent of souls to be discussed below.) Yet another analogia must relate Isis-Euthenia to the zodiacal constellation of the Virgo, whose most distinguishing characteristic is the grain ear that she holds.151 The significance of the constellation of Virgo is that it is one of the zodiacal signs of the inunda- tion. 152 The sphinx (A, pl. 6b). Merkelbach identified the sphinx with Osiris, and with the constellation of Eri- danus. I prefer for reasons aesthetic rather than mythological to connect the sphinx with the constel- lation of Lepus, "the bark of Osiris."'53 Given the courtly origin of the Tazza, it is possible that the otherwise unparalleled equation of the Sphinx with the constellation of Lepus (Gk: Aaywbog) represents an allusion to the founder of the Ptolemaic dynasty, Ptolemy Lagos.'54 Its leonine body permits it to stand by analogia for the zodiacal constellation of Leo, whose significance in the Nile allegory has been dis- cussed by Merkelbach.'55 The bearded divinity (C, pl. 4a). The identification of the Isis figure as Eridanus, the Nile, provides a functional relationship with the tree that grows along its bank and represents Osiris. Merkelbach identified the tree-born god as Sarapis and connected him with the constellation of Leo. I accept the identification with Sarapis (-Kronos-Aion-Hades-Agathos Daimon), but prefer to connect him, on the basis of his position relative to Orion, with the constellation of Taurus.156 In a strictly astronomical context, the constellation of Taurus is always represented as a bull, usually only the foreparts. The figure in the Tazza has several features in common with the usual schema of the constellation: both are sexually ambiguous,'57 he low- ers his massive head at the neck,'58 he bends his legs sharply at the knees, and he faces in the same direc- tion as the constellation.1'59 The enormous horn that he holds even suggests the most prominent attribute 148 "She is holding in her left hand a vessel for the holy water and is surrounded by eight children, representing the number of cubits the water rises during the inundation of the Nile." (Quoted from H. Riad et al., Alexandria: An Archaeological Guide to the City and the Graeco-Roman Mu- seum [ca. 1980] 118 [inv. 24124].) See also LIMC IV (supra n. 85) no. 9. 149 Dion. 38.429-31. Here Nonnos appears to be using analogia. Cf. Allen 474; A.B. Cook, Zeus II (Cambridge 1914-1940) 481. 150 Eratosth. [Cat.] 198-99. Cf. also Allen 481: "In classic folk-lore the Milky Way was marked out by corn ears dropped by Isis in her flight from Typhon." 151 Aratos Phaen. 96-97. In the lines that follow, Aratos tells the legends of her descent from Astraeus, "father of the stars," and her identity with Justice (Dike). See also Eratosth. [Cat.] 82-85 and infra n. 212. (For the connection of Isis with Justice, see Diod. Bibl. 1.27.4.) The constellation of Virgo is usually described as holding the grain in her left hand. Aratos (Phaen. 97) says simply "in her hands." Here she is shown in the same mirror-reversal that affects the other figures, and must be seen as she appears from the outside of the sphere. See the interesting discussion of the right-left problem by G.R. Mair in the Loeb edition of Callimachus, Lycophron, Aratus (Cambridge, Mass. 1969) 198-200. See also Thiele 36; Boll 178, n. 2. 152 See infra p. 276. 153 The constellation of Lepus is not mentioned in the Hermetic text published by W. Gundel (Neue Texte 199- 200). Among the paranatellonta of Taurus (21st to 23rd degree) there appears a star "qui detinet navem, Deus dispo- nens universum mundum" (54, 27-28), which Gundel con- nects with either Lepus or Canis Major, and identifies as Anubis (200, 219, 231). The description might as well apply to the sphinx of the Tazza. 154 Although comparatively insignificant in the sphaera graeca, the constellation of Lepus is important in Egypt, not only because it lies directly beneath the figure of Orion, but also because it lies between Orion and Canopus (a-Carinae), the "star of Osiris." The latter is part of the constellation of the Argo, and is also frequently included in schemata of the constellation of Eridanus. Allen, 70, noted that both Marti- anus Capella and the scholiast on Germanicus called Cano- pus "Ptolemaeon" in honor of Ptolemy Lagos. Given the connection of the star Canopus with the Canopic mouth of the Nile, i.e., the one nearest to Alexandria, it is likely that it plays a part in the symbolism of the Tazza. Canopus, though strangely absent from most of the treatise, seems to be alluded to under the paranatellonta of Cancer as "qui movet Navem Deus." See Neue Texte 202. 155 Merkelbach 124. See infra. 156 Hence, the arrangement bears comparison with the stellar allegory discussed in M.P. Speidel, Mithras-Orion (Lei- den 1980). 157 The god of the Nile, the zodiacal sign, and planetary Saturn are all associated with fertility, but they are either hermaphroditic or sexually impaired. See Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 132-34, esp. 134, n. 3 (of Taurus). 158 Called Taurum / summisso vultu by Manilius (Astron. 1.264-65). 159 On these characteristics and their significance to ancient astrologers, see Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 132-34, 319.</page><page sequence="20">274 EUGENE J. DWYER [AJA 96 of Taurus.160 In pseudo-Eratosthenes' Catasterisms Taurus was associated with the bull of Zeus in the Europa myth and also with the Hyades, nurses of Dionysos.161 While it does not seem improbable to infer a connection of Taurus with Dionysos (i.e., Dio- nysos-Osiris'62), ancient literature is surprisingly silent on this subject.163 A tradition preserved in Diodorus's account of Memphis, however, suggests that some myth-maker had sought to associate the myth of Euro- pa with a similar episode that led to the founding of Memphis: "The aforementioned city was named, ac- cording to some, after the daughter of the king who founded it. They tell the story that she was loved by the river Nile, who had assumed the form of a bull."'64 It has been suggested that the Greeks may have con- nected the god of the Nile, Ha'py, with the Apis.165 Since a (different) "Bull of the Heavens" plays an important role together with the constellation of Osiris-Orion in the Pyramid Texts, it is natural that the Greeks would attempt to associate the Egyptian bull with their own bull, Taurus, especially since the latter is so closely linked to Orion. The two flying youths (E and F, pl. 5a). These figures represent a pair.166 They have been identified above as the Etesian Winds, and with the Egyptian gods, Shu and Tefnut. Together with Horus, they make a triad.167 Merkelbach is certainly correct in relating them to the Greek Dioscuri and their stellar counterparts, the Gemini.168 According to my recon- struction, however, the figures do not coincide en- tirely with the usual schema of the constellation of Gemini. The leading Wind (Shu) actually lies com- pletely outside the schema, though within the bounds of Gemini along the ecliptic (represented by the heavy horizontal line). His head lies very near to the star al- Nath (P-Tauri), identified with the star known as Ter- minus in the Hermetic astrological text published by W. Gundel.'69 By the turn of his head, he indicates a connection with the vertical axis and the apex of the composition--or something beyond the apex. The second Wind (Tefnut) lies within the usual schema of Gemini, but is arranged perpendicularly to the usual figures. The reason for this modification of the usual schemata, the only one in the Tazza, can only be speculated. The idea that figures conform to the cir- cular composition-i.e., artistic license--only begs the question. The fact that the stars that now compose the two Gemini lie mostly within the Milky Way and the figures in the Tazza are thus made to coincide with it is a much better explanation of the modification of the usual map (fig. 4). The arrangement of these figures has something to do with the mythical Phae- thon. In the pseudo-Eratosthenic Catasterisms Phae- thon, after his death, is placed in the stars as the constellation of Auriga, the Charioteer.170 As seen in figure 2, the constellation of Auriga lies directly above the head of this figure. In fact, the star 3-Tauri is actually part of the schema of Auriga.'71 The impli- 160 Aratos, Phaen. 167-68, calls him "the crouching horned Bull." 161 See Eratosth. [Cat.] 106-13. As the bull of Zeus, Taurus is the archetype of all ships. 162 See Plut. Mor. 356 B, 362 B, 364 D, etc. For the asso- ciation of Taurus with the Apis, see Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 133, n. 4 (citing Ps. Lucian. Astrol. 7). 163 Macrob. Sat. 1.21.20-21, mentions a bull called Bacis, worshipped at Hermunthis in the Temple of Apollo, with reference to the constellation of Taurus. 164 Diod. Bibl. 1.51.3. The translation is that of C.H. Old- father in the Loeb edition, I (London 1933) 181. See Burton 159-60. 165 Burton 160: "Later attempts to combine Greek mythical history with Egyptian led to the attribution of the foundation of Memphis to an Argive king, Apis or Epaphus. As a variant, Apollodorus, II, 10, records that an Egyptian king called Epaphus married Memphis, daughter of Nile." The taurine nature of the Egyptian demiurge is demon- strated by the myth of the metamorphosis of the gods at the approach of Typhon: as each of the gods changed into a characteristic animal shape in order to escape Typhon, Ptah changed into a bull. See Boll 324-25. 166 The left foot of the second youth has been missing ever since the Tazza became known to Europeans. It has been assumed that this is the result of an ancient break. Never- theless, a remarkable passage in Philo of Alexandria con- cerning the Stoic Chrysippus should be noted in this connection. "Having first established that it is impossible for two peculiarly qualified individuals to occupy the same sub- stance jointly, he says: 'For the sake of argument, let one individual be thought of as whole-limbed, the other as minus one foot. Let the whole-limbed one be called Dion, the defective one Theon ... (etc.)"' (Philo, De aeternitate mundi 48 [Long and Sedley 171-72, fr. 28 P]). The philosophical text in question was undoubtedly known in the same cultural world that produced the Tazza. A technical examination of the Tazza should be able to establish the nature of this detail. 167 Caligula represented his brothers, Nero and Drusus, as the Dioscuri on his coins. According to Suetonius, he em- ployed the Temple of Castor and Pollux as a vestibule to his palace on the Palatine, and contrived to exhibit himself standing between them to those who entered (Suet. Calig. 22, 2). See K6berlein (supra n. 95) 29. 168 In the Aratus ascribed to Hermes Trismegistus, the leading Dioscurus (Castor) is said to be of the "nature of Jupiter and of Mercury," the following Dioscurus (Pollux) of the "nature of Mars." See Neue Texte 184-85 (where the identification of the Dioscuri with Shu and Tefnut is also discussed). The planetary associations are doubtless due to the color of the two stars, which differs noticeably. Castor is "bright white and pale white" (the color of Jupiter) and Pollux is "orange" (approximating the reddish color of Mars). See Allen 230, 233. Other mythological-astrological identities, such as Apollo and Herakles, also reflect this color difference. See Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 135-36. 169 Neue Texte 155 (no. 15), 269-70.

Fig. 4. Detail of figure 2 with Milky Way added cation is clear: by means of analogia, planetary Jupiter (i.e., Phaethon) is connected with both Gemini and Auriga.'72 While Phaethon falls into the Eridanus in most versions of the myth, in Nonnos's version, he falls into the Milky Way."73 As figure 4 shows, the youth in the Tazza identified with Phaethon actually lies within the path of the Milky Way, right where it crosses the ecliptic.'74 It is precisely here, according to Nonnos, that Phaethon met his end.,75 The con- nection with the genesis of souls is thus made clear. By falling into the Milky Way, precisely at the Gate of the ecliptic, Phaethon becomes a type of the soul de- scending into genesis. Such was Proclus's explanation of his fall.176 It is consistent with the Hermetic allegory proposed above. The two women at the right (G and H, pl. 5b). Mer- kelbach believed they should be identified with the Hyades and Pleiades in the constellation of Taurus. I believe that by their location they are intended to represent the two stars, Sirius (Gk: Sothis) and Pro- cyon, hounds of Orion. The fact that the Egyptian Satis was identified with the star Sothis during the Hellenistic period makes this identification likely.77 The probability of this identification is increased by the identification of the Nilus figure with Agathos Daimon = Khnum, whose cult at Elephantine included Satis and Anuket. The identification of these two female figures with the stars Procyon and Sirius may solve an old problem. Many astrological texts mention three otherwise un- identified stars named "the Graces" that rise with the sign of Cancer. 78 The story told by Ovid of Orion's daughters, the Coronides, and the two youths, the Coroni, who spring from the daughters' funeral pyre, 172 His occupation of the apex of the composition might also refer to the fact that the planet Jupiter had its "exalta- tion," or greatest influence, in the zodiacal sign of Cancer. From this location he has power to arouse fructifying winds from the north according to Ptolemy (Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 97, n. 2; 197). 173 Another analogia may be found in the Eriphoi ("the Kids"), ,- and Tl-Aurigae, which lie in the Milky Way in the vicinity of the star Capella (a-Aurigae). They are an Alex- andrian contribution to the star map, and probably reflect the Orphic sentence "the Kid fell into the Milk" (0. Kern, Orphicorum Fragmenta2 [Berlin 1963] fr. 32c, 11; cf. 32f, 4). 174 I.e., the astronomically correct "Gate of Men." Its po- sition is marked by the stars (3- and ?-Tauri (= the tips of the two horns of the Bull). 175 Nonnos, Dion. 38.393-95: "Europa's bridegroom the Olympian Bull bellowed, stretching his neck drenched with damp snowflakes; he raised a foot curved for a run, and inclining his head sideways with its sharp horn against Phae- thon, stamped on the heavenly vault with his fiery hooves." The translation is by W.H.D. Rouse in the Loeb edition (Cambridge, Mass. 1942) III, 121. 176 Procl. In Ti. 1.113.30 (Diehl). Cf. Porph. De Antr. Nymph. 28: "'The land of dreams', according to Pythagoras, is composed of souls, which are gathered into the Milky Way; and the Milky Way is named from the milk with which these are nourished when they have fallen into genesis" (Arethusa Monographs I [Buffalo 1969] 29). 177 For Satis = Sothis, see Bonneau 233; Merkelbach 122, n. 43; EAA VII, 66, s.v. Sati (S. Donadoni). The two god- desses, Satis and Anuket, appear, identified by inscriptions, in the second bark (after Isis-Hathor) following Orion in the rectangular zodiac from Denderah. See Boll 169. 178 Boll 272-73, where they are identified with the three stars in the belt of Orion. Gundel (Neue Texte 248) suggested, on the basis of evidence not known to Boll (i.e., that the new text located the rising of the Graces between the 18th and 20th degrees of Cancer), that three stars in the square of Ursa Major were meant. The same evidence would support the stars suggested here.</page><page sequence="22">276 EUGENE J. DWYER [AJA 96 suggests the two pairings of stars that I believe are depicted here (viz., Canis Major/Canis Minor and the Gemini).179 That the Coronides were associated with the Graces can be demonstrated by the fact that Non- nos, in his astrological epic, calls Coronis mother of the three Graces.'80 Hence, there is evidence in later epic poetry that the Graces were associated with char- acters in the Orion saga, presumably the two constel- lations grouped about Orion. The "complementary grouping" of the two figures, already noted, is clearly reminiscent of the arrangement of the Hellenistic Graces.181 They may also represent souls descending into genesis.'82 Gorgon (pl. 3). This figure appears on the reverse of the Tazza, and is not usually discussed in connec- tion with the subject of the interior. Nevertheless, at least two and possibly three connections exist between it and the figures in the interior. First, the pseudo- Eratosthenic Catasterisms associate it with the She- goat, Capella, nurse of Zeus and identified in the star a-Aurigae. This star seems to determine the vertical axis of the composition of the interior, and a connec- tion with the allegory would thus seem to have been intended. Another likely connection with the allegory would be that the Gorgon represents the Sun in the underworld, just at the point of appearing at the solstice point at the moment of sunrise.'83 Curiously, the name "Gorgo" is used for the star 0-Eridani, which marked the southern end of the river (hence, of sig- nificance in the Nile allegory) in ancient catalogues.184 In addition to the above-mentioned associations with constellations familiar from the Greek astronom- ical sphere (i.e., the sphaera graeca), three figures in the center of the composition allude directly to signs of the zodiac that are related to the Nile allegory in a temporal sense. While the mapping of constellations depicted with Orion contains only two signs of the zodiac, viz., Taurus and Gemini, I believe that the three during which the inundation took place are represented by Eratosthenic allusions. In other words, the duration of the event is depicted as well as the moment of its inception. Cancer is represented not in the relief itself, but in the centric point of the astro- nomical projection.'85 Leo is present in the leonine body of the sphinx. Directly above Leo is the following sign, Virgo, closely represented by the Isis figure. Above Virgo is Libra, or the Yoke as it was known to Aratos, represented by the Horus figure holding the kerykeion, a kind of yoke and, as I shall attempt to demonstrate, a kind of balance. (Some depictions of the seventh sign show an otherwise unidentified youth holding a balance.186) With the arrival of the autumnal equinox in the sign of Libra, the Nile began to subside, preparing the fields for sowing. Hence, the figure who represents Libra here may double as a farmer (whence his identification as Triptolemos). THE CORRELATION OF THE PLANETS AND THE CONSTELLATIONS It may be asked what the allusion to the seven planets added to the allegory of creation. The answer to the question has to do with the role of the planets in channeling the celestial waters directly to the Earth. The same question might also be asked concerning the constellations.187 The answer to the second ques- tion is also clear in the explanation of the descent of '79 See Ov. Met. 13.675-704. It is all the more attractive to connect Ovid's verses with the Tazza because the poet is describing a scene sculpted in a goblet [of bronze]. is0 Dion. 48.555. (The Graces were usually believed to be daughters of Eurynome.) As in the case of the Phaethon legend, Nonnos and Ovid are both presumably following an Alexandrian source. C.D.E. Lackeit, in RE 11 (1921) 1433- 34, s.v. Koronis, suggested that the Koronides represented a doubling of Koronis. s181 See LIMC III, 203-10, s.v. Gratiae (H. Sichtermann); also LIMC III, 191-203, s.v. Charis, Charites (E.B. Harri- son). Additional evidence comes from the Hermetic text, de XV stellis, published by Festugiere I, 181-84, where Procyon is depicted "ut gallus minimus vel tres puellae," and Sirius as "leporarius vel puella bene disposita." This evidence suggests the possibility that either Procyon by itself represented the three Graces, or that both stars were involved. 182 Porph. De Antr. Nymph. 10 (Arethusa Monographs I [Buffalo 1969] 13): "it is the powers presiding over waters that we call naiad nymphs, but the ancients also gave this name to all the souls in general descending into genesis." This topic is developed below. 183 West (supra n. 59) 189, n. 32 speaks of the Egyptian belief that the Sun was assailed by serpents as it traveled under the Earth. The iconography of Helios and Medusa is sometimes very similar. See Roscher I, 1725, s.v. Gorgonen (A. Furtwangler); 2002-2003, s.v. Helios (A. Rapp). See also M. Vermaseren, "Sole o Medusa? Un intarsio romano," in Hommages W. Deonna (CollLatomus 28, Brussels 1957) 514- 16. 184 Neue Texte 50, lines 21-22: "In tertio gradu [Arietis] est clara stella Gorgonis et Cynocephalus, i. e. habens caput can- inum deferens candelabram." Gundel identifies this star with 0-Eridani. 185 There is justice in this because Cancer is a notoriously dim constellation, a fact often noted by the ancients. See Allen 107. On the sign of Cancer see W. Deonna, "The Crab and the Butterfly,"JWarb 17 (1954) 47-86. 186 See RE 10 A (1972) 696, 16-25, s.v. Zodiacus (H.G. Gundel and R. B6ker). 187 Reason by itself will not provide an answer to this question. The fact is ancient astrologers were in the habit of correlating stars and planets, mostly matching them accord- ing to color.

Precisely these constel- lations and their lumina, or brightest stars, were the ones commended to sailors for predicting rainy weather.' 89 The Eridanus is itself the heavenly coun- terpart of the Nile, but whether it was contiguous with it in the southern hemisphere was a matter of contro- versy. The universe was, nevertheless, contiguous through the concentric spheres of the planets. Hence, waters originating from outside the sphere of the fixed stars might descend successively through the spheres first of the outer planets and then of the inner until they reached the Moon, and from there, the Earth. As they descended through the successive spheres of planetary influence, they acquired some- thing of the nature of each. That the waters of the Nile maintained these planetary natures underlies Manilius's description of the river "which, in sallying forth through seven channels and mouths [viz., of the Delta] which put to flight the current of the sea, resembles the planets of heaven."'90 It is accurate to call the planets the "instruments of time."'9' Yet scientific astronomy has no use for a mere grouping of the planets: such groupings only make sense in an astrological context, where the plan- ets may be imagined as forces exerting power over life on Earth. Eratosthenic allegory makes them com- parable to the constellations that were believed by the Egyptians to influence the Nile, and to influence life on Earth. Along with their role in channeling water, the planets shared with the stars a role in the mystery of Time. It was not until the planets gained popularity as governors (i.e., chronocrators) of the days of the week that they became popular in ancient art."92 As gover- nors of the days of the week, they were rearranged from their natural order into a mystic union that pretended to some religious truth.'93 On the basis of the identifications thus far pro- posed, the three outer planets can be linked directly with signs of the zodiac: Saturn with Taurus, and Jupiter and Mars with Gemini. The rest of the planets (Sun, Venus, Mercury, Moon) are each linked directly through their positions on the map with non-zodiacal constellations.194 Yet the zodiacal correspondences in the Tazza are sufficient to recognize the system of matching planets with decans (i.e., the Egyptian 100 subdivisions of the zodiac) found in the later astrolo- gers, Firmicus Maternus and Paul of Alexandria'95 (table 3). If my reconstruction is correct, the system of the Tazza begins with the third decan of Taurus and continues through the third decan of Cancer, match- ing each of the seven decans with one of the planets in sequence from outer to inner. In this way a classic hebdomad of the type (1 + 3 + 3) is formed, grouping the planets into a monad associating Saturn alone with Taurus,196 a first triad associating the masculine outer planets with Gemini, and a second triad associating the feminine inner planets with Cancer.'97 This correlation is not just a curiosity. In addition to providing a reason for the multiple identities of the figures in the Tazza, the system of planetary de- cans is one of the possible sources for the ordering of '88 The creation account in Genesis 1:7 describes the sep- aration of the waters above the firmament (Septuagint: "ste- reoma") from those below the firmament. When the Flood of Noah begins (7:11), the sluices are opened and the waters above the firmament are released to flood the earth. 189 E.g., Aratos Phaen. 733-1154, sometimes thought of as a separate work, the Diosemeiai. 190 Man.

'94 These, in turn, may be linked to zodiacal sign through the practice of recording the heliacal rising of the signs (i.e., paranatellonta) according to the zodiacal list. For example, Orion (here = Sun) first begins to rise when Gemini is rising (Aratos Phaen. 728-31). Canis Major (= Venus) and Canis Minor (= Mercury) both rise with Cancer. Eridanus (= Moon) actually rises earlier than Cancer, though, for the sake of the system, it seems to have been connected with the third decan of Cancer. The astrological system of matching the colors of individ- ual stars with the planets is followed here in the cases of Jupiter (= P-Tauri and ca-Gemini), Mars (= 3-Gemini), Mer- cury (= a-Canis Minor) (all in Neue Texte 153-59); and Venus (= a-Canis Major) (Festugibre I, 175 ["V Alhabor: ex natura Veneris"; see discussion on 176]). 195 Bouch6-Leclerq 227-29; Sternglaube 60, 149. Cf. Neue Texte 20: "Tertius decanus Tauri habet faciem Saturni." (The descriptions of the decans do not otherwise correspond to the figures in the Tazza.) 196 Elsewhere, the association of the planet Saturn with Taurus is made by Plutarch, in an interesting passage in De facie quae in orbe lunae apparet 26 (Mor. 940f-942c), and by Nonnos, who matches the reign of Kronos with a corre- sponding epoch of Taurus.

(Read vertically, the sequence of planets in each column repeats the familiar se- quence of weekdays."98) Firmicus Maternus explains the significance of these correlations for the allegory of the Tazza: "Located in its own decan [a planet] accomplishes the same thing as when in its own sign."'99 That is to say, the astrological significance is the same as if each of the seven planets were located in its own house: the so-called Thema Mundi or "Birth- day of the Universe."200 According to Stoic teaching, when all of the planets will have returned to their original signs the universal conflagration will occur, bringing about a renewal of all things.201 The recognition of the Hermetic cosmogony in the scene of the Tazza reinforces the astronomical alle- gory, and further clarifies the historical context of the work. Of the three principal figures of the triad, the first, Nilus (Taurus-Saturn), must correspond with God the Father, the hermaphroditic, cosmic Mind (Nous). The second, Isis (Eridanus-Moon) must be Nature. The third, Horus (Orion-Sun) must be the Logos and the demiurgic Mind, the Son of God. Their action together results in the creation of the universe. As the illustration of the Tazza shows, they also take their places in creation, as their own images are per- petuated in their creations or hypostases. Hence, Taurus (Saturn) can become the leader of the con- stellations (planets), a reflection or emanation of God him/herself.202 By this means, a "Neo-Platonic" chain of hypostases is created: Light-Nous-Taurus-Sat- urn-"Nilus." (It should be noted that the Egyptians depicted Saturn with the head of a bull.203) Similarly, Nature (whose primal condition of Darkness is de- rived from the Light) is revealed in Eridanus, in the Moon, in Isis-Euthenia, and so forth. Moreover, the design of the Tazza makes it very clear that the further subdivision of a divinity resulted in a bipolarization that preserved the original identity (in a second gen- 198 The system presented here is, in effect, a counting of the seven planets in recurring sequence dia tesseron (by every fourth).

Saturn was the outermost of the planets known in antiquity, and closest to the sphere of the fixed stars. 203 Boll 228. Two planets are usually associated with Tau- rus by Greek astrologers: Venus and Saturn. In a literary work that I believe to be close to the intellectual climate of the Tazza, Plutarch (supra n. 196) made the entry of Saturn into the constellation of Taurus significant in the beginning of a kind of golden age of 30 years. The period corresponded with the sidereal period of Saturn, i.e., the amount of time required for one revolution through the zodiac. (The actual time required for one sidereal revolution of the planet Sat- urn is 29.458 years according to Norton's Star Atlas'16 [Cam- bridge, Mass. 1973] 62, table 33.) Manilius, who draws on Alexandrian sources, stated that the Greeks called the planet "Daimonium." Astron. 2.937-38: titulus quem Graecia fecit, / Daemonium signat dignas pro nomine vires.

Hence, Horus (i.e., the Son) is present in his offspring, the two winds, the first of which is made to resemble him.204 Similarly, Isis-Euthenia (i.e., Nature) is contin- ued in a bipolar pair of goddesses (Satis and Anuket), the first of whom may be called "Isis II" and the second "Nephthys."205 Although related to the syn- cretism found in traditional Egyptian religion, the operative principle is the kind of Greek rationalism employed by Cicero in De natura deorum for the pur- pose of bringing order to a disorderly family tree by postulating the preservation of divine identity in suc- ceeding generations.206 One of the problems mentioned above that has not been adequately addressed in previous literature con- cerns the dramatic action of the group: what is hap- pening? Although creation in the cosmic sense proceeds from the left to the right, and is more sche- matic and symbolic than dramatic, I believe that there is intended to be dramatic action as well. Although the action can be read in the Tazza relief by itself, the map in figure 2 reveals the importance of the per- spective system in reading the action. The action, like the spherical perspective, originates in the upper right (i.e., eastern quadrant). The Sun is rising at the solstice point in the zodiacal sign of Cancer. The sphinx, by its position, sees it with his (her) full face.207 Horus turns to look at it and appears to be blinded by the sight.208 (It may seem illogical that Horus, who is identified with the Sun, would turn to look at the Sun in another location, and possibly be injured by it.209) The moment of destruction (and also renewal) is at hand. The Hermetic texts and the surviving frag- ments of the Samothracian religion tell us that salva- tion is possible through knowledge of God. THE IMAGE OF HEAVENLY JUSTICE The ultimate level of meaning in cosmic allegory is the eschatological: the ultimate meaning of life as determined by the knowledge of what comes next. The Egyptian Book of the Dead follows the journey of the deceased through the Underworld to ultimate judgment, represented as a psychostasis, or weighing of souls, before the god Osiris. The Poimandres ends with the return of souls to the sphere of the fixed stars and union with God. The Christians eventually adopted a concept of judgment rather similar to that of the Egyptians, combining it with a Stoic (and pos- sibly Iranian-influenced) doctrine of the end of the world.210 Those who have seen messianic ideas rep- resented in the scene on the Tazza have already en- dorsed the meaning of the end of the world and the return of a golden age.211 Whether it concerns the end of the individual or the end of the world, the Tazza contains an impressive array of the instruments of heavenly judgment at its center. The connection of the sphinx with eschatology needs hardly to be mentioned. Isis in the persona of Virgo is clearly identifiable with Dike.212 Horus in the persona of the Balance-carrier is identifiable with Kai- ros, who comes with an impressive array of weighing and measuring devices.213 The paternal god ("Nilus") seems remote and impartial like Osiris in the Egyptian psychostasis. A subject not addressed directly in the Poimandres, but implicit in the cosmic allegory and evident in the Tazza, is Time. Nilus has been here identified as the God at the beginning of time. He has been associated here with Sarapis and Kronos. The association of Kronos with Time (Chronos) is well known and well 204 And, as the planet Jupiter, is astrologically benign, while the second, as the planet Mars, is malevolent. 205 Supra n. 84. 206 E.g., "Mercury I, Mercury II, etc." See Fowden 29. 207 As does the great Sphinx at Giza. It is tempting to believe that the action must be related to the myth of the Cave in Plato's Republic VII, evidence of the designer's Pla- tonism. 208 On the significance of looking at the rising sun, cf. the anecdote of the infant Augustus told by Suetonius among the list of prodigies concerning his future greatness (Aug. 94.6). Blindness caused by looking directly at the sun is not an explanation that is given for the injury to one of Horus's eyes in his conflict with Seth-Typhon, but a Greek poet may well have made such a connection. See J. Gwyn Griffiths, The Conflict of Horus and Seth (Liverpool 1960) 28-53. Compare the myth of the blind Orion searching for the rising Sun. See J. Fontenrose, Orion: The Myth of the Hunter and the Huntress (Berkeley 1981) 9-12. Cf. also Pl. Resp. VII; Porph. De Antr. Nymph. 8. 209 The most venerable of the Egyptian traditions of solar theology, that associated with Heliopolis, declared the Sun to have three aspects and to be represented by three differ- ent divinities according to the time of day. At its rising it was Kepri, the scarab-god, identified with the sign of Cancer. At noon it was Re (i.e., Horus). At sunset it was Atum, the primordial creator. 210 Given the similarity of characters and attributes, it is not inappropriate to suggest that the author of Revelation was familiar with this allegory. 211 Bastet 23; Alf6ldi (supra n. 2) 564-70; La Rocca 95- 100. 212 For Dike = Virgo, see Bouche-Leclerq 62, n. 1; 139; 191, n. 1 and supra n. 151. 213 For the connection of Kairos with the Christian Last Judgment, see G.

The other two members of the triad are also closely connected with Time in its various aspects. I have already noted that the Horus figure is contrasted with the Nilus figure (i.e., Kronos) in age and vitality. (Horus's name in Greek suggests "time" in a more immediate sense: the words for "hour" and "season" are suggested.) Where the older figure appears to be overcome with lethargy, the younger figure is por- trayed in vigorous and ambivalent motion.214 In ad- dition to his frenzied state of activity, the Horus figure (i.e., Helios) has other attributes of Kairos215 (i.e., the immediate present): a knife and a leonine mane with prominent forelock. The knife of Kairos presumably referred to the etymology of the word kairos, from keirein ("to cut").216 The forelock, together with a clean-shaven occiput, was a notable characteristic of Lysippos's statue of Kairos.217 One had to seize the forelock, so to speak, before the back of the head of the swiftly moving god was all that was available. It has not been noticed that this feature, unusual in Greek art, may well derive from the imaginative in- terpretation of the distinctive lock of Horus in Egyp- tian iconography.218 Another attribute of the Lysippan Kairos was the balance. If the yoke held by the Horus figure in the Tazza can be read also as a balance, he has this attribute of Kairos as well. Where the horn of Kronos signifies bounty received in the past, the attributes of Kairos are ambivalent. The sack on his left wrist may contain gifts, but the knife in his left hand is ominous.219 The yoke or balance in the right is ambivalent.220 The Isis figure, Selene, has the attributes of Tyche (i.e., the future element of three-fold time221): the grain spears. Like Helios-Kairos she is an ambiguous force. The grain is a benefit, but the two spears may be an allusion to the shears of Atropos.222 She has the power to cut the thread. Kairos, the present, is depicted as the mediator between past and future. The allegory is contained in the conjoined attributes as clearly as it is in the entire figures of the three divinities, though the interpreta- tion would be more difficult without the entire pic- ture. Among the three attributes, the yoke is the only one composed of more than one part: staff, crossbar, 214 Alfoldi, in "Redeunt Saturnia regna VI" (supra n. 10) 17-23 notes the dual nature of Time and the dual nature of ancient depictions of it: Time in its eternal sense, as Antiquus dierum, and Time in its immediate sense, as puer exoriens. In particular, cf. Serv. in Aen. 1.729: Unde et lingua Punica Bal deus dicitur. Apud Assyrios autem Bel dicitur quadam sacrorum ratione et Saturnus et Sol. 215 Kairos is not identical with Aion, another temporal allegory with solar associations. Aion signified "eternity," and when he was compared with Kronos-Chronos it was as a dyad. Images of leontocephalic Aion were popular with the Mithraic cult. See LIMC I, 399-411, s.v. Aion (M. Le Glay) esp. 405-11. In the plural, the name kairoi is given as the masculine equivalent of the feminine horai, "seasons." See LIMC V, 891-920, s.v. Kairoi/Tempora Anni (L. Abad Casal) esp. 891. Hence, Kairos (sing.) is synonymous with Horus in the sense of seasonal time. Kairos plays an important part in Egyptian magic. See, e.g., Festugiere I, 300-302; K. Prei- sendanz, Papyri graecae magicae II (Leipzig 1931) 13, 187; LIMC V, 920-26, s.v. Kairos (P. Moreno). 216 This etymology is noted by most authorities, though uncertain. See Kittel (supra n. 213) 456. Cf. Philo's demi- urge, "the Cutter" (Tmeus) in Quis rerum divinarum heres 133ff. 217 For depictions of Kairos in art, see RE 10 (1917-1919) 1510-21, s.v. Kairos (H. Lamer); Moreno (supra n. 215). 218 Robert Bianchi of the Egyptian Department of the Brooklyn Museum first suggested to me the possible con- nection between the traditional lock of Horus and the flam- ing forelock of the Tazza's Horus. The earliest mention of the Lysippan Kairos is in an epigram of Poseidippos (Anth. Pal. 16.275; J. Overbeck, Die antiken Schriftquellen [Leipzig 1868] 1463). The subject of Lysippos's sculpture, and its interpretation by an Alexandrian poet, should be examined in the light of the Horus-Kairos identification presented by the Tazza. Macrobius (Sat. 1.21.14-16) attempts an allegor- ical interpretation of the lock of Horus. 219 It suggests the castration of Kronos by Zeus, of Seth- Typhon by Horus, the decapitation of Medusa by Perseus. Given its prominence in the decoration of the Temple of Isis in Pompeii, the myth of Perseus and Medusa was likely to have been allegorized in the context of the Isidic religion. E.R. Goodenough (supra n. 20) Index I, "Logos," citing Philo of Alexandria, develops the concept of Logos as a Platonic demiurge known as "the Cutter" (Tmeus), i.e., the divider or mediator between God and the finite universe, a role similar to that played by Kairos and by Mithras. 220 It suggests the cords used by Zeus to bind Kronos, hence, counteractive to the work of the knife. 221 Supra n. 74. Cf. the trinity of symbols of the Moon (a cat), the Sun (a lion), and Time (i.e., Kronos) (a crocodile [for Sobek]) that appears on the bow, mast, and stern of the boat of the Sun in Martianus Capella, De nuptiis Philologiae et Mercurii 183. 222 This is conjecture based on the likely presence in the Tazza of an allegory of Human Life (see infra n. 226). That the attribute may be used to suggest shears is purely hypo- thetical, but consistent with the logic of phenomena, hence appropriate to ambivalent divinities like Tyche. An interest- ing example of the ambiguity of grain "shears" may be found in the name of the Attic harbor, Porto Raphti (Gk: raptes = "tailor"), presumably named from the resemblance of the grain "shears" held by a colossal marble statue of Oikoumene to the shears of a tailor. See C. Vermeule, "The Colossus of Porto Raphti in Attica," Hesperia 31 (1962) 62-81. An identical temporal subdivision of the Fates occurs in the philosophy of Proclus. See L.J. Rosain, The Philosophy of Proclus (New York 1949) 173. On the close association of Kairos and Tyche, see Kittel (supra n. 213) 458. Consistent with the theology employed in the Tazza, Kairos implies the presence of the divine attribute of Providence, whereas Tyche implies Chance.</page><page sequence="27">1992] THE TEMPORAL ALLEGORY OF THE TAZZA FARNESE 281 and cords. Of all the objects depicted in the Tazza it is the most enigmatic. It may be intended to recall the caduceus, the anchor, the brazen serpent, or similar signs.223 In a symbolic sense, through its central po- sition in the Tazza, it reduces the depiction of Time to a spiral about a central axis.224 In principle, it is the axis of the universe turned by the hand (ingens dextra) of the demiurge.225 But there is also intended to be a subjective aspect: in the cords wrapped around the rigid axis, the viewer sees the essentials of life, espe- cially the human body (i.e., tissues and bones), as well as the essentials of the Universe.226 "The Egyptians ... maintain that the attributes of the caduceus illus- trate the generation, or 'genesis' as it is called, of mankind."227 THE HISTORICAL CONTEXT The name of Eratosthenes appears in virtually every major literary source that has been brought into this interpretation. The subjects of his interest in- cluded the river itself, the geography of Egypt, the geography of the rest of the earth, astronomical po- etry, and cosmology. Merkelbach thought him a likely candidate for the invention of the Tazza. Yet his fame was so great that he undoubtedly found numerous imitators as well as followers willing to carry on his work. Against the evidence in favor of Eratosthenes must be weighed the fact that the closest textual par- allels to the subject are to be found in the Corpus Hermeticum, of uncertain date, but certainly later than Eratosthenes.228 One ancient author whose work offers comparison with the allegory of the Tazza is Ovid. His treatment of the Orion myth, with Coronides and Coroni, has already been noted above. Another story from the Metamorphoses that provides an interesting parallel is the fall of Phaethon (1.749-2.400).229 In Ovid's ac- count, Phaethon, "fire ravaging his ruddy hair, is hurled headlong and falls with a long trail through the air; as sometimes a star from the clear heavens, although it does not fall, still seems to fall."230 He lands in the river Eridanus whereupon his mother, Clymene, conducts an Isis-like search for his scattered limbs and reburies them on a riverbank. His sisters, the Heliades, weep on the banks of the river. Ovid's version, like the Tazza, combines physical allegory with the Osiris myth. His description of Phaethon in his fall, with emphasis on his flaming hair and com- 223 Including the Djed-pillar of Osiris, which provides a better explanation than any thus far suggested for the pres- ence of cow's horns at the top. The djed-pillar was the sym- bolic body of the cow-goddess Hathor, which in the form of a tree gave birth to the concealed Osiris. See H. Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods (Chicago 1948) 178-79. 224 This seems to be consistent with the apparent symbol- ism of the serpent and obelisk that appear beside the zodiac in the silver patera from Parabiago (supra n. 94). The Py- thagoreans opposed the straight and the curved, and saw them combined in the spiral. See A. Maddalena ed., I Pita- gorici (Bari 1954) 32, citing Herakleitos (H. Diels and W. Kranz, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker5 [Berlin 1934-1937] 22 B 59). 225 "Together with the Logos the Demiurge-Nous who en- compasses the circles and swings (spins) them whirring around, set his creatures turning, and let them turn from an infinite beginning to a boundless end. For they begin where they cease. Their circling motion, as the Nous in- tended, brought forth from the lower elements irrational beasts-for they did not have the Logos (any more)-the Air produced birds and the Water aquatic animals. For Earth and Water were separated from each other [emphasis mine], as the Nous had intended, and the Earth brought forth from itself what it had, quadrupeds and reptiles, wild and tame beasts" (Poimandres 10, trans. W. Foerster and R.M. Wilson, 330). On the gesture of the right hand, see H.P. L'Orange, Studies on the Iconography of Cosmic Kingship in the Ancient World (Oslo 1953) 148. 226 The same allegory is present in the "bonds of Saturn." See Macrob. Sat. 1.8.11: "His [Kronos's] disposition by his son indicates, simply, that as times grow old they are superseded by the times that succeed them. His bonds point to the fact that all periods of time are by an immutable law of nature interconnected, or else to the fact that [the stalks of] all the fruits of the field are made up of cord-like sub- stances and knots alternately arranged" (P.V. Davies trans. [New York 1969] 64). A picture like the Tazza may explain the confusion in the iconography of Kairos that leads to his identification as Human Life (Bios) in Byzantine times. See the excursus on Kairos and Bios in Cook (supra n. 149) 864- 68. For the relation of the seven planetary deities in the Hermetic system to human genesis, see Bouch&amp;-Leclerq 324, n. 1. It should be recalled that among Gnostic and among Christian exegetical writers, the Hebrews' "descent" into and subsequent escape from Egypt signified the descent of the soul into the body. The symbolism employed in the Tazza, sphinx = Egypt, would thus be amenable to a continuation of the allegory of human life, wherein the sphinx would represent the earth-bound condition of the soul. 227 Macrob.

DWYER parison to a star or planet (rather than a meteor), brings to mind the figure of the first Wind (=Jupiter) in the Tazza. The Heliades recall the Seasons to the right. Ovid's retelling of the story looks very much like an Eratosthenic analogy, and shares many fea- tures with the earlier poet's use of astronomical myth. It seems as though Ovid is familiar not only with Eratosthenes' theory of poetry, but also with an image like the Tazza. According to Suetonius, when Augustus captured the palace of the Ptolemies he contented himself with a single bit of loot, an agate cup.231 Although Suetoni- us's anecdote must be taken with a grain of salt, it does provide a provenance for one of the gems in the imperial treasury-and the Tazza was most likely to have been in it.232 Given Augustus's enthusiasm for astrology, the Tazza Farnese would have made a wor- thy prize. Such an event would also explain how at least two of the poets in the circle of Augustus seem to show familiarity with the Tazza.233 CONCLUSION The Tazza represents more than a simple Nile al- legory. It is a picture made in spherical perspective. It is an illustration of an important philosophic text of the Corpus Hermeticum. It is also an astronomical map and an astrological document. Both in the case of philosophy and astrology it is reflective of systems developed elsewhere. Unfortunately, it is not stamped with a date. Nevertheless, as a work of art it is probably more datable than are many of the texts with which it has been associated here. Therefore, it deserves an important place in the study of these texts. In addition to the evidence it may provide for the dating of works of philosophy and astrology, it gives evidence of a kind suspected to have existed, but never found be- fore. It shows how visually oriented were these doc- trines that seem to us so abstruse. With the image of the Tazza before one's eyes, the doctrines can become much clearer. As a unique work, the Tazza does not belong to a recognized class of datable objects. The survey of previous literature undertaken at the beginning of this paper revealed a wide range of dates suggested on the basis of stylistic comparison. Nevertheless, unique objects also have a history and it may yet be possible to connect the Tazza with the work of a particular poet, artist, or astrologer. The general in- tent of bringing natural phenomena such as the in- undation and the movements of the heavens into a rational order governed by divinities depicted in Greek idealizing form is consistent with Ptolemaic religious policy. The use of the eighth degree of Can- cer for the solstice-point on the map points to the first century B.C. as does the arrangement of the planets according to the order of the weekdays. Although the planetary week does not seem to have been earlier than this period, it definitely was the height of fashion during the first century B.C. It is all the more likely that a work as artistically innovative as the Tazza would illustrate innovative astrological teachings. If the Tazza cannot be dated much before 100 B.C. because of its association with the Hermetic Corpus and its astrology, it cannot be dated after the fall of the Ptolemies. Because of its courtly and regal symbolism it cannot have been produced for Alex- andria after 31 B.C. An artist in the service of a Ro- man emperor would have made something much different.

Here I take murrinum to mean agate or Indian sardonyx. See the note of D.E. Eichholz to Pliny, HN 37.21 in his edition in the Loeb series, vol. X (Cambridge, Mass. 1962) 178. 232 La Rocca xi-xii provides a good summary of all that is known of the Tazza's provenance. 233 I.e., Ovid and Virgil. Thompson 120-21 quotes Aen. 8.707-13 (see supra ns. 18, 68) and 8.680 (supra n. 110), and concludes: "These descriptions are all so familiar that we must wonder if Vergil also saw the tableaux in the triumph? Did a gem-cutter, following the market to Rome, also remember these representations? Or did Octavian or Gallus perhaps receive the Tazza as a gift from an obsequious Alexandrian?" Thompson's suggestions, predicated on the assumption that the Tazza was produced in Rome, all raise difficult problems from an artistic point of view.</page></plain_text>
