<plain_text><page sequence="1">PHILOSOPHY sonal Idealism," and has much in common with that of a British group. His closest historical affiliation is with Leibniz, while his method of attaining this position owes much to the extreme subjective arguments of Kant. He parts from the former, however, in rejecting the "caste-system" of the Monadology, in positing a social reference "within the self-defining thought of the individual mind," and in giving "to natural objects, as items in the real experience of minds, a reality, secondary and derivative, indeed, but still unquestionable, and associated essentially with the self-defining activity of every mind . . ." (p. I37). This sounds well as a programme, but how this intrinsic sociality and "unquestionable" nature can be effected in the republic of "self-originative" minds is not at all clear. On the side of consistency a more thorough-paced pluralist-such as McTaggart-seems the sounder; while the deviations of Howison appear to point to some other principle or being than that attaching to our own limited minds. In seeking to establish the eternity and integrity of our minds and selves Howison overlooks or minimizes the quite obvious limi- tations of these minds and selves. Contemporary readers may wonder whether we can put a finger on anything in our experience corresponding to "the self-defining activity of every mind," which is something Howison confidently assumes. Most of us feel that our minds are anything but "self-defined." But these selections concern much beside personal idealism. An essay, e.g. on The Duty of the University to the State, is admirable. RALPH E. STEDMAN. Essentials in the Development of Religion: A Philosophic and Psychological Study. By J. E. TURNER, M.A., Ph.D. (London: Alien &amp; Unwin, Ltd. 1934. Pp. 308. Price I2s. 6d.) In this work Dr. Turner discusses the central topics of the philosophy of religion in the context of their historical development, and brings out the logical stages in this development, as one after another the different notions, either presupposed by or embodied in the religious life, are made explicit in the organized life and thought of human society. This involves a good deal of psychological investigation, as well as philosophical argument, and the book is made the richer by the mixture: Dr. Turner is right in refusing to be deterred by labels from utilizing material which can be of value to his exposi- tion. The book ranges over a wide field in a systematic manner, and shows evidence of very considerable learning, but it is not for these reasons at all heavy or hard to read: on the contrary, it is written with life and enthusiasm and is all the fresher for the writer's breadth of knowledge. The opening chapters deal first with methodological considerations and then with the general nature and place in experience of the subject-matter of the philosophy of religion. The next section is concerned with some general characteristics of experience, metaphysical and epistemological in kind; it is followed by a series of chapters on the development of morality leading to a discussion of the moral self and a statement of the relation between good and evil. The last section deals in the light of the results achieved in the foregoing chapters with topics such as Immortality, the Supremacy of Religion, Knowledge and Faith, Authority, and Divine Personality. The conclusion of the whole matter is that man lives in a friendly universe; "it is then no merely empty metaphor to say that the Universe is friendly to every form of perfection, no matter how trivial at first sight this may seem to be, and equally to every process that makes perfection possible and brings it into being: the exhaustless beauties 478</page><page sequence="2">NEW BOOKS of inorganic nature and of the realm of life: unknown heroisms and silent self-sacrifice: every desire and effort for whatever is good and beautiful and true: all these are eternally sustained by the dynamic force of Reality, and all that opposes them is in the end destroyed." 0. S. FRANKS. Waking World. By OLAF STAPLEDON. (London: Methuen &amp; Co., Ltd. 1934. Pp. viii + 280. Price 7s. 6d.) This book, as its title suggests, is rather a prayer of aspiration than a work of philosophy; but, since its author believes-with reason-that world awakening waits for a sufficient Weltanschauung, it involves a philosophy. It ranges from communism and fascism via an outline of "modern knowledge," a survey of art, science, philosophy and religion, to pacifism, democracy, free-speech, and the World-State. The human and social aspiration claims much sympathy; while for the details of the social plan there is a good deal to be said. The survey of art, science, and philosophy is, in the main, admirably done. The critique of religion (and of Christianity in particular) is obviously that of an amateur. Its two chief bgtes-noires, 'soul-saving' and the 'loving God,' have no place in first-rate theology and religious practice in the forms in which Mr. Stapledon envisages them: and with the second-rate we need not treat, since the ideals both of churches and of Mr. Stapledon suffer from the mediocrity and obtuseness of men. The concept of 'salvation,' indeed, holds in Christian theology much the same place that 'fully awakened living' does in Mr. Stapledon's, though, of course, the two theologies differ in what they take to be the 'chief end of man'; and the Christian doctrine of the Love of God does not abate a jot of the Hebrew sense of His awfulness. That in practice much weak sentimentalism creeps in there is no need to deny. The author's criticism of 'sham' religion is central to his theme, since he has the 'real thing' to recommend, which, he hopes, is to prove the dynamic of a 'waking world.' This religion is reminiscent of "The Free Man's Worship," but whereas Russell preaches defiance of Fate, Mr. Stapledon preaches admiration of its tragic theme. That an "overwhelming apprehension of something both superhuman and beautiful" (p. 204) lies at or near the root of religion would, I think, be granted (with qualification) by most theologians. The difference between these and the author lies in this, that the former accept developments from this primordial 'something' along the lines of rational and moral anthropomorphism, while the latter, denouncing anthro- pomorphism in general, develops a no less anthropomorphic aestheticism in religion, one of the chief advantages of which is its immunity from reason. More than a touch of Spinozism (or Bradleyism) marks Mr. Stapledon's world-view. "The perfectly awakened mind," he observes, "at last sees clearly that, though the defects and agony of the myriad beings of the cosmos are undeniable facts, they are also needed factors in the excellence of the cosmos" (p. 237). But one may doubt whether either Spinoza or Bradley would altogether approve of this book as a whole. Indeed, with all syncretists, Mr. Stapledon (who, in effect, accepts the designation) wants the best of all possible worlds, including that of M. Bergson, as well as that of Spinoza. He wants, e.g., 'creative leaps' which are also 'determined.' The book concludes on a lower plane, urging, as means subordinate to ecstatic fatalism in the pursuit of the 'world-aim,' free-speech, pacifism, and bigger and better schools. The continuity between elements so diverse must, of necessity, be somewhat tenuous; hence it may not be unfair to say of the book as a unit that, while by no means 'void,' it is certainly 'without form.'
