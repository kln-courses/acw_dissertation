<plain_text><page sequence="1">JAMES T. COLLINS Language death in Maluku The impact of the VOC Introduction The meeting of cultures throughout the many eras of globalization has not always been mutually beneficial, either to the societies or to the languages involved.1 There is, of course, the Australian model, as perceived by Nettle and Romaine (2000:121): Any aborigines were simply pests to be removed ... The Tasmanians were shot where they were found, or rounded up into prison camps, where the survivors languished in miserable conditions. The last of them, a woman called Trucanini, who had been raped by the white convicts and then used by the authorities as a pawn to bring her people in, died in 1876. A unique branch on the tree of the world's languages was thus destroyed along with its people. In the early seventeenth century, the Verenigde Oost-Indische Compagnie (VOC, United East Indies Company) conducted an equally infamous cam paign of terror aimed at eliminating the ethnic group of the Banda Islands, 1 The original draft of this essay was presented as an invited paper at Symposium 400 jaar VOC: Wat valt er te vieren?, organized by the editorial boards of Marinjo and Blimbing, in Amsterdam, 13 April 2002.1 am especially grateful to my friend Herman Keppy of Marinjo who arranged my participation. I express my thanks, too, to K. Anderson, T. Conners, T. Kaartinen, G. Knaap, S. Koolhof, B. Litamahuputty, P. Martin, H. Niemeijer, U. Tadmor, Waruno Mahdi and other colleagues who offered their suggestions and advice when I was revising this paper for publication, as well as to the Symposium participants who met with me to talk about the languages of Maluku throughout the day of the Symposium. My deepest debt, of course, is owed to the people of Maluku who have supported my research on their languages for the past 30 years. Many of them have died and, in some cases, with them the last traces of their languages have died as well. To them I say: ulepa aku sou waku imi leke imi sou a. JAMES T.

The conquest of Banda in 1621 is unmatched in the whole of Indonesia's colonial history for its thoroughgoing brutality and inhumanity. Eyewitness accounts published more than 220 years after the events (Leupe 1854; Tiele 1886) are as horrific as the statistics. Some have estimated that the population of Banda before the VOC campaign was 15,000, but less than 1,000 after it was completed (Hanna 1978:55). This amounts to a survival rate of less than 7%. Moreover, with a bookkeeper's methodicalness, year after year, the VOC cleared its account ledgers by shipping the few Bandanese sur vivors from Banda to Batavia to work as slaves who built canals and fortress walls until they succumbed to malaria or corporate cruelty. The elimination of Australia's Tasmanian language has been called lan guage murder (by M?hlh?usler 1996:121-9). However, the language of Banda and the Bandanese themselves survived the murders and displacement of the seventeenth century. Small groups of Bandanese survivors managed to slip away from the VOC onslaught and many of these refugees trickled to the Kei Islands 400 kilometres away across the deepest sea of Indonesia (see Map 1). There they cautiously and secretly regrouped, and established at least two slender, hard-pressed settlements3 where their language, but apparently not their 'complex social organization' (Aveling 1967:352) could persist. Today the Bandanese language survives, albeit changed, in two narrow coastal strips, where 4,000 descendants of the survivors eke out an existence in a multilin gual setting, now socially complex and layered in different ways (Collins and Kaartinen 1998). If we were to extend M?hlh?usler's heavy-handed and somewhat anthropomorphic terminology to the case of the uprooting and destruction of the Bandanese, we might be tempted to call the effect one of attempted murder, still a bloody, though stymied, crime. But, in fact, the elimination of the Bandanese language was never the aim of the VOC. Their aim was 2 The contemporary events were far more complicated than the brief summary provided here. Gerrit Knaap (personal communication, 24-5-2002) clarifies: '[T]wo of the offenses in Banda and one in Ambon (the Great Ambonese or Hoamoalese War) evolved as wars, in which 'cleansing7 was/became a stated objective]. Consequently, the more than half a century of fighting in the entire area of the Maluku can be characterized as a long protracted war, at times taking the shape of genocide/ 3 The Bandanese people who today live in Banda Eli and Banda Elat, Kei Besar, have very strong traditions about this identity-defining flight more than 350 years ago. There are many stories about the pursuit by VOC warships to the very shores of their present villages, the disguises used by their ancestors to deceive the pursuers, the cession of land by the indigenous Keiese and the establishment of a fragile livelihood based on trade cycles to the Aru Islands and elsewhere.</page><page sequence="4">^^^^^^?^ ^^t^^^^^ NUSA LAUT Map 2.

In hindsight, language attrition was only, let us say, collateral damage. The seventeenth century, the Golden Age of the Netherlands, was replete with VOC campaigns of terror, resettlement and mass executions in the islands of Southeast Asia, not unlike the punishments and misery inflicted by the Spanish on their territories in the Low Countries during the preceding century. Europe had exported its culture to Asia. Parallel to these crimes against humanity in what is now Indonesia, there were many assaults, mostly indirect as in the case of Bandanese, on languages as well. These crimes - against diversity and complexity of human language - were seldom as successful as the suppression of the Tasmanians and elimination of their language. And yet the decisions made by the VOC, both those taken in spiteful revenge and even others with the most noble and rational inten tions, have had repercussions which linger and exert deleterious influence even now, more than 200 years after the VOC ceased to exist. In the following pages, the impact of the VOC on the languages of Maluku will be briefly considered. I suggest that decisions made in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries have had, indeed continue to have, serious impli cations in one of the world's most complex and diverse language ecologies. Below, in the first section, brutal decisions intended as wartime measures 300 years ago are reviewed for contemporary implications. In the second section, rational, budgetary, and administrative decisions are considered in the light of the continuing endangerment, and even the loss, of numerous languages in Maluku. Ethnic cleansing and language decline From 1651 until 1656, Arnold de Vlaming waged a war, vicious in its destruc tive intensity, against the peoples of Hoamoal. By the end of that war, 12,000 people of Seram and its western islands were removed from their villages by the directive of the victorious VOC (Keuning 1956) (see Map 2). Three staged resettlements of the defeated populations were organized by the victors. First, the entire Hoamoal peninsula was depopulated, except for a dense, poverty-stricken settlement directly under the eyes of the VOC garrison in Luhu. Second, the populations of the islands of Boano, Kelang and Ambelau were removed to the shadow of the fort built on the south coast of Manipa (Valentyn 1724-26, 11:202-3). Third, leaders and high-ranking Seramese and some of their families were resettled right under the walls of the fort in</page><page sequence="6">252 James T. Collins Ambon city, in a neighborhood that came to be known as Batumerah. In the homelands of the exiled populations, the emptied villages of the Hoamoal Peninsula, Kelang Island and Boano Island were burned to the ground, and the clove groves and sago stands utterly destroyed to make room for a new socio-economic order in which the cultivation of cloves was strictly limited to Ambon and the Uliasse islands. Even today most of Hoamoal and all the island of Kelang are peopled by other ethnic groups, migrants from Halmahera and Sulawesi. Neither the original populations of seventeenth-century Hoamoal and Kelang, nor their languages, have recovered from the seventeenth-century De Vlaming policies of ethnic reprisal, removal, and resettlement. Three lan guage variants, Kelang, Batumerah and Piru, are considered here as exam ples of the impact of these policies of ethnic cleansing. Today all of these languages are extinct or very nearly extinct. Kelang In 1647, Governor Gerard Demmer (Heeres 1897:563) listed six villages on Kelang Island, namely 'Hatiboutj, Amanitou, Kelangh, Tono, Coif and 'Salattj'. Ten years later none existed. Those Kelang villagers who had sur vived the five years of VOC-Hoamoal hostilities were forced to resettle on the south coast of Manipa Island. They never returned to Kelang Island. After his idyllic description of Kelang, Nusa Ial 'Kenari Nut Island', where the islanders lived from the fruits of their gardens, as well as rice, tubers, leg umes, their kenari trees and from trading the white damar of Mount Salatti, G. Rumphius (1983:185-6) ends his essay with the observation that because of their involvement in the 'Majira Revolt' the principal orangkaya (commu nity leaders) were exiled to Batavia and all the inhabitants of Kelang were taken from their land and relocated on Manipa beside the fort ('Wantrouw', as Valentyn and Rumphius referred to it).4 In September 1978 I walked from one end of the south coast of Manipa Island to the other in order to collect language data.5 In the vicinity of the ruins of the seventeenth-century fort near the centre of the coast, I stopped 4 Valentyn (1724-26, 11:33) abstracted and rephrased Rumphius's essay, noting a total population ('in ouden tyden', namely before the resettlement) of 720 inhabitants. 5 This fieldwork was conducted as part of my doctoral research (1977-79) under the auspices of Lembaga Ilmu Pengetahuan Indonesia (Jakarta) and the sponsorship of Pusat Pembinaan dan Pengembangan Bahasa (Jakarta). In 1977-78, much of my research was funded by the Fulbright-Hays Fellowship program under the US Department of Education. Initial analysis of the accumulated data was supported by a Whiting Foundation Fellowship (1980), administered through the University of Chicago.</page><page sequence="7">Language death in Maluku 253 in a village named Kelang-Asa'ude with a population of about 600 people. According to a village official, Bapak Usman Kakauwe,6 very few of the 600 or so villagers could still speak the Kelang language; moreover, for the most part, those few speakers were all 60 years old or more. Young people and children knew nothing of the Kelang language; the language of daily use was Ambonese Malay. So I sat a few hours with the old men, for whom the memory of their expulsion from their homeland by the VOC ('Kompan?, as they referred to it) more than 300 years earlier was still very much alive,7 and collected a vocabulary of about 450 words and several examples of the complex con jugational and genitive marking systems of the Kelang language, as well as a handful of sentences.8 After three centuries of exile on Manipa Island, it is not surprising that I noted loanwords from the Manipa language in the speech of the Kelang-speaking villagers. But Kelang in 1978 remained dis tinct from Manipa and more closely resembled the language of Luhu9 (see Appendix 1 for a brief comparison). For example, although both Kelang and Manipa, like Luhu,10 display a fossilized clitic demonstrative, {-ne}, in the personal pronoun system, [aune] T, not [au]; [anene] 'you', not [ane] and so forth, Kelang has not regularly shifted *t to /k/, a diagnostic innovation in 6 Persnonal communication, 10-9-1978. 7 My very brief notes (Collins 1977-79), written before I had access to the historical documents and entirely based on village traditions, are as follows: Kelang [village on Manipa] is said to have originated from Kelang, the island due north of here. Asa'ude, which has separate traditions, a separate spring [for drinking water], but the same 'raja', is said to have originated from Asa'ude. They fled their native islands (presumably in the seventeenth century), expelled by the 'Kompani'. 8 This is one of the smallest wordlists I collected during my doctoral field work (1977-79); in my diary (16-9-78) I refer to it as 'a preliminary vocabulary7. But it exceeds the only other known vocabulary of Kelang of only 32 words (almost half of which are numbers) noted by Van D?ren (1859). In 1985 Taguchi (1989:48) was 'unable to obtain a wordlisf of Kelang for some unexplained reason. (He and other researchers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics (SIL) do not seem to have visited any of the islands immediately to the west of Seram (Taguchi 1989:18), at least not before 1989; see Map 2. The only data Taguchi mentions from any of these islands were collected from the two Boano speakers, the youngest informants of the 43 people interviewed by SIL staff. Those two young men were not interviewed in Boano but in some unspecified place.) 9 See Collins (1983:73-8) for further discussion about the linguistic relationships among Manipa, Luhu and Kelang. Note, too, that Sachse (1919:44) labels the Kelang language 'Behasa Hoamoal'. Oddly, although Taguchi never collected data about Kelang, he did not hesitate to doubt the classification proposed in Collins (1983). 10 A table of Luhu pronouns, both independent and clitic forms, can be found in Payapo (1980: 48). The late Abdullah Payapo, one of Maluku's foremost linguists, died in a tragic accident only a few years after the completion of his pioneering monograph. His untimely death has delayed the serious study of the region's indigenous languages by native speakers of the languages themselves.</page><page sequence="8">254 James T. Collins Manipa. ..n Note: 'eye' 'stone' 'shrimp' Manipa Kelang Luhu maka mata mata haku hatu hatu mekale metale metale Today, about 25 years after that handful of words and paradigms was jotted down, it seems unlikely that the language survives as a spoken language, although there may still be a few people who can remember it. Batumerah Between 1862 and 1869, two vocabularies of Batumerah were published in Dutch (Van der Crab 1862; Ludeking 1868) and one in English (Wallace 1869) (see Appendix 2 for a sample of the Ludeking list). Each is an independent source for a language that became extinct, probably in the nineteenth cen tury.12 Based on these wordlists collected almost 150 years ago, Batumerah looks very much like a dialect of Luhu, as Grimes (1988:517) suggests.13 In Collins (1977-79) many lexical items display Luhu-like forms; for example 11 There are, however, some loanwords from Manipa in the Kelang data I collected in 1978. For example, [kia-] (Kelang), [kia-] (Manipa) 'belly', where Ha- would be the expected reflex in Kelang. Also there are a few cases of penultimate syllable reduction in Kelang which appear to be borrowed from Manipa where such reduction occurs more frequently (Collins 1983:77); for example: Proto-Austronesian Gloss Manipa Kelang *isi flesh sin si-na *quZan rain lane lane *kulit skin li'i li'a *qulu head lu lu-ku 12 Travis (1989:87) informs us that apparently in 1984 Batumerah's Village head [...] reported that the language had not been used for fifty years and perhaps only two or three elderly persons would still know the language7. If this spurious claim were credible, one wonders why these knowledgeable elderly persons were not introduced to the SIL research team so that a wordlist could be collected. Neither Van Ho?vell in the late nineteenth century nor Erwin Stresemann in the early twentieth century collected wordlists of Batumerah. Stresemann (1927:2-3), in fact, used the same three mid-nineteenth-century sources cited here. Although this may reflect omission on the part of these scholars, the more likely reason is that even at that time (1875-1915) there were no speakers of Batumerah. Grimes's conclusion (1988) that Batumerah is "nearly extinct7 seems to be an understatement, indeed. 13 Sachse (1919:44), on the other hand, was of the opinion that the Luhu language closely resembled (overeenkomstig) the language of Batumerah, although he does not seem to have considered them identical; that is, Luhu and Batumerah were not dialects of each other.</page><page sequence="9">Language death in Maluku 255 mundei 'man' (Wallace) or opo mandai 'boy' (Van der Crab) can be compared to Luhu mandae 'man, male' in contrast to Manipa mannai and Kelang mal lae (all deriving from an earlier form, / malana/ 'man, male, husband' + I el 'singular article, the').14 On the other hand, there are phonological grounds for associating the Batumerah variant more closely with Manipa.15 In the seventeenth century, Batumerah seems to have served as a Maluku internal place of exile, especially for Muslims from western Seram. Note that in Valentyn (1724-26, 11:124) the settlement is labelled 'Den Roodenberg der Mooren'.16 The language spoken there may have reflected the various strands of its settlement history and a koine Hoamoal variant may have developed. Nonetheless, an absolutely clear notion of classification of Batumerah is out of our reach because it is extinct and the orthographies of the existing docu mentation are not completely reliable. Piru In early 1978 I visited Piru several times to study the language there, as well as to travel to other research sites (Eti, Murikau, Kaibobo and others). After some false starts, I was able to collect a vocabulary of more than 1,200 words of the language, but could form only rather sketchy ideas of the conjuga tional system which appeared to be in decline and not well understood.17 At the time, the population of Piru was estimated at about 5,000, but fewer than 1,000 of the inhabitants claimed to be Piru natives. Of that number there were only 40 or 50 people who claimed to speak or know the Piru language. Actually, the number of competent speakers was probably much lower than that. Even elderly 'speakers' (50 years and more) had only a partial know ledge of Piru. The most reliable informants were about 70 years of age.18 By 1985 Taguchi (1989:40) reported 'at most ten native speakers' of Piru, that is 14 Certainly, Stresemann's claim (1927:138) that -ex and -ai were retained diphthongs is mistaken. See Collins (1983). 15 Collins 1983:86-7. Data from the languages of Boano, Luhu, Kelang and Manipa are drawn from my fieldnotes 1977-78 (Collins 1977-79); see Appendix 1 for a small sample of these data. 16 Valentyn (1724-26, 11:124) acknowledged: 'Waar by nu nog eenige weinige Mohammedaanen (zynde veel oude daar gebannen Hoewamohelesen) die reeds opgebracht zyn, dog nu hier op Leitimor woonen, zouden moeten getelt worden [...]'. 17 Reduction and reinterpretation of the morphological system may not mark a stage in language loss. For example, a comparison of English verbal morphology to that of Dutch, or of Dutch to German, suggests that a reduced morphology does not always mark language loss. Even in Maluku, the Laha language with its considerably reduced and reinterpreted morphology was a vibrant language at the time of my research (1977-79); see Collins (1980a). On the other hand, as we shall see below, loss of morphology in Allang almost certainly marks a stage of language attrition; see Dressier (1988:185) on the decline in the productivity of word formation rules.</page><page sequence="10">256 James T. Collins less than 1% of the total number of indigenous Piruese. As noted 20 years ago (Collins 1983), Piru is closely related to the language of Luhu. Moreover, Sachse (1919:44) considered Piru and Luhu the two dia lects of 'Behasa Loehoe''. In fact, Piru probably represents the northernmost point in the chain of Luhu-speaking villages that spread across the whole Hoamoal peninsula before 1650.19 When De Vlaming's forced resettlement policy depopulated the peninsula, the links in that chain were broken, leaving Piru speakers isolated from Luhu speakers, especially those remaining in Luhu itself. As noted 20 years ago (Collins 1983:79), since the seventeenth century, [Interchange between these two villages [Luhu and Piru] has been minimal. In addition, the influx of outsiders into Piru has considerably influenced its lan guage. The most notable result is its near extinction. [...] Not surprisingly the gradual decline of the Piru language is to be seen in certain of its peculiarities. The borrowing of vocabulary, especially from Eti, a village which tradition ally spoke an East Piru Bay language related to Kaibobo, but also lexical items from nearby Alune-speaking villages, has made Piru diverge from contemporary Luhu. However, the relationship of Piru with Luhu is strik ing,20 even to the point of both variants displaying mandai 'man, male' and simd 'who', found in no other West Piru Bay languages - except Batumerah, as noted above (see Appendix 1). 18 I first worked with a 50-year old man selected precisely because he was a well-known Piru 'speaker'; however, during an initial elicitation session he only knew 16 of the first 50 words of my vocabulary questionnaire (a mere 32% of the total). Compare Dorian's (1986:562-3) as well as Evans's (2001:250-81) notes on identifying and working with speakers of obsolescent languages. My third informant, Ibu Sosana Kekelesi (aged 69 at that time), was an excellent informant who provided almost all the data that form the 1,200-word corpus in my files (Collins 1977-79). Note, though, that even in her speech both the k- and the t- conjugations were no longer productive, with forms like [itapila/] and [irapila/] 'he massages' or [ukahu] and [uwahu] T cough' in free variation. See Collins (1983), Stresemann (1918) and others for discussions of the verbal inflectional systems of the languages of central Maluku. 19 Payapo's map (1980:62-3) suggests just this kind of isolation of Piru, with non-Luhu speaking villages, such as Ariate and Talaga, intervening between the main Luhu-speaking areas to the south and Piru, which Payapo also labelled as Luhu-speaking. 20 Taguchi (1989:49) apparently did not understand the argumentation in Collins (1983:79 81). In those pages, Piru and Luhu are considered variants (dialects) of the same Luhu language because they share phonological innovations, not because there is a tradition that Hoamoal formed a single language. His untested assertion that these two 'speech forms are probably not mutually intelligible' is unlikely to be true. His informant, aged only 45, might perhaps experience difficulty, but speakers of Luhu would find Piru (if it was ever spoken in public) easy to understand. With no data from either of the Luhu or Piru wordlists used by Taguchi, it is difficult to understand where he sees the problem in intelligibility. Note that Payapo (1980), a speaker of Luhu, considered Piru a variant of Luhu. The reader can refer to the brief comparative wordlist, based on Collins (1977-79), found in Appendix 1 here to form his or her own opinion about the extent of the differences between Piru and Luhu.</page><page sequence="11">Language death in Maluku 257 Discussion In this section, three endangered or extinct languages were touched upon briefly. I would claim that these three language variants have reached their present state of attrition initially because of the wartime decision made by officers of the VOC in the seventeenth century to depopulate the Hoamoal peninsula and adjacent islands and subsequently because of shifts in the economic and social environment resulting from that historic resettlement that have since led to reinterpretations of identity and ethnic affiliation. The resettlement of the Hoamoal population led to the extinction of the Batumerah language, the near extinction of Kelangese, and today's precari ous state of Piruese. Of course, even as early as the 1970s, many languages in Maluku were extinct or in danger of becoming extinct. However, especially in the case of Batumerah and Kelang, these Hoamoal variants do not follow the general pattern, one might say the typology, of language endangerment in central Maluku. As we shall see in the following section, in this geographic and socio logical region, the languages most likely to be threatened by extinction, or indeed to be already irretrievably lost, are languages spoken by Christians, not languages like Batumerah and Kelang that are or were spoken by Muslim communities. The very fact that languages spoken by Muslims in central Maluku were extinct - or nearly so - even 25 years ago does not fit the typological pattern of language endangerment in that region. And a rea son should be sought. In 1978, Kelang, an 'emblematic' language - that is a language that sym bolizes the historic origins of the community using it, spoken in a rather isolated, undeveloped village21 - was rapidly being replaced by Ambonese Malay, whereas there was no nearby prestigious community using Ambonese Malay as their first language,22 no easily obtained secondary school educa tion, no mass communication facilities and no reliable transportation links to the provincial capital, Ambon city. In short, none of the usual sociological factors thought to influence language attrition were present. It is more likely that the factors influencing language loss in Kelang village need to be sought in the social history of the village. The roots of language loss lie far in the 21 At the time of my doctoral neldwork in the late 1970s, Manipa was difficult to get to, not only because of rather inhospitable currents and reef-studded shorelines. The island had a strong reputation for hostile sorcery and witchcraft which deterred even the most intrepid navigators. 22 But a small part of one village, Tumalehu Timur, is Christian, and that minority community speaks Ambonese Malay as its home language (Collins 1982:93); see Olivier (1834-37,1) on the origins of that village. Niemeijer (2001:269) notes that by 1669 'Zacharias Cahing was sent to Manipa to catechize new converts'.</page><page sequence="12">258 James T. Collins past of this village, or, as Mufwene (2001:155) might refer to it, the 'socioeco nomic history of settlement'. In the case of Kelang, the seventeenth-century forced resettlement of six sizable villages, with the necessary severance of connections to their ancestral lands and their resources, especially the sole source of livelihood, the clove and damar trade, caused the gradual decline of the population and their lan guage. Note that Bleeker (1856:50) writes that in 1629 (25 years before reset tlement to Manipa) Kelang Island was estimated to have 400 men capable of bearing arms. Bleeker estimates this to mean a total population of about 1,600 people. Indeed, Knaap's (1987:100) estimate for about 1634 is almost 1,900. But in the mid-eighteenth century, the entire island of Manipa with its eight villages (including Kelang village near the Wantrouw fort, where the Kelang island population had been resettled) had a total population of only 700. By 1824, the population of all the settlements on Manipa Island had dropped further to only 320 (Bleeker 1856:49). Although virulent malaria is a persist ent problem on Manipa, one assumes that out-migration from the island in the past 325 years was the chief factor in this population decline.23 In the case of Batumerah, however, all the 'classic' sociological factors generally associated with language loss are present. Batumerah's very prox imity to all the educational, transportation and communication resources of Ambon city certainly contributed to the nineteenth-century extinction of its language. Moreover, Batumerah's more recent, modern role as one of the chief entry points for Muslim migrants from other parts of Maluku and elsewhere in eastern Indonesia contributed to language loss, especially after the rapid growth of Ambon city in the nineteenth century. But it must be emphasized that the reason that the Batumerah language was spoken in '[a] suburb of Amboyna', as Wallace (1859) describes it, is indeed a piece of 23 In a message received 24 May 2002, Gerrit Knaap, based on his many years of research on Indonesia's demographic history, cautions me about the reliability of these sources. This is a reasonable warning well-taken. However, Bleeker's (1856) figure of 320 in 1824 is probably based on Olivier's (1834-37, 1:119-20) figures, also cited by Van D?ren (1859). Olivier actually visited Manipa in 1824 and his 1834 book contains a village-by-village count of inhabitants, providing the basis for the total of 320. Olivier (1834-37,1:112) also noted slave raids by large Papuan fleets, the latest in 1822, and the prevalence of cholera on Manipa. Moreover, Van D?ren offered some insight into this population decline. In a comparative demographic table (Van D?ren 1859:105), he estimated the total adult population of Kelang village on Manipa in 1840 as 94, that is 32 men and 62 women. This skewed proportion of (adult) men to (adult) women suggests that men left the island, apparently to seek their livelihood elsewhere. We might mention here that in the early days of the VOC and its military campaigns elsewhere, for example in Sumatra and Java, troops from Manipa under the command of a Manipa officer, Bintang Pelehoewa, who came to be known as Kapitein Jonker (see Olivier (1834-37, 1:116) among others), formed an important segment in the VOC forces. Perhaps this early enlistment of Manipa islanders in the VOCs overseas enterprises also set a pattern for the skewed sex ratios that Van D?ren noted.</page><page sequence="13">Language death in Maluku 259 'socioeconomic history'. The VOC enforced resettlement on them; they did not choose to be there in Ambon city. Thus, the need to reinvent themselves was a direct but slowly growing result of their exile to the edge of Ambon's fort. Language shift was part of this reinvention of their identity. In both cases under consideration here, Kelang and Batumerah, we observe that central Maluku language variants (one might call them Hoamoal languages or dialects) became endangered because of explicit decisions made by the VOC to resettle and impoverish those speakers of Kelang and Batumerah. In his recent book, Language death, David Crystal describes the social results of recent population movements in the Sahel region of Africa, but the observations are also relevant in our discussion of resettlement in Maluku. He writes (Crystal 2000:74): Unpredictable migrations take place, in which communities find it hard to preserve their integrity, and traditional cultural - and linguistic - dependencies are broken. Apparently, in the case of the Piru variant, the impact was less direct but, combined with other factors, equally forceful. By removing and resettling the population of the Hoamoal peninsula in the seventeenth century, Piru was severed from the rest of the Luhu-speaking area, all concentrated near the VOC fort in Luhu village. This social isolation of Piru from all other Luhu speakers caused the language to suffer a decline in viability. Certainly, later factors also played roles in this decline, including the conversion of Piru to Christianity24 and still later, in the twentieth century, the military campaigns and capital investments that were administered from Piru as a governmen tal25 and missionary centre.26 But the starting point for this decline in lan guage resilience was the geographic and social isolation imposed on Piru by the mass resettlement of other Luhu-speaking villages from their locations along the length of the Hoamoal peninsula. 24 In Rumphius (1983:166), we learn that the orangkaya of Piru, Rewan, had become a Christian by that time ('Rewan, namaals Christen geworden'), but this singling out of Rewan perhaps implies that not all of the estimated 344 inhabitants of Piru in the late seventeenth century had embraced Christianity. However, Niemeijer (2001:269) cites 1672 as the date of the conversion of Piru. 25 Not only was the Hoamoal peninsula opened up to coconut estate capitalism with its influx of outside workers, but, while the rest of Europe was embroiled in World War I, the Netherlands maintained its neutrality in Europe and used the contemporary weapons of destruction to wage war against the highland Alune communities, organizing military operation and logistics from a colonial military base established in Piru. See Collins (1983). Sachse's (1919) Chapter VIII, ' Verhouding tot het Nederlandsch-Indisch Gouvernement', is an outline account of the skirmishes and campaigns aimed at the mountain villages of western Seram between 1904-1916. 26 Piru had already served as a center of renewed Christian proselytization since the nineteenth century. H. Krayer van Aalst, a missionary posted to Piru (1897-1913 (Polman 1983: 137)), provided some insights into the life of a missionary and of villagers in his popular tales written for church members in the Netherlands (Krayer van Aalst 1920,1922).</page><page sequence="14">260 James T. Collins Language death is often a complex process, as we shall see in the fol lowing section. But there is a strong possibility that the disintegration of the Kelang and other exiled Hoamoal communities brought on by VOC-imposed resettlement eventually led to language loss in those exiled communities27 and, coupled with other factors, in Piru as well. Mission policy and language decline In the past 400 years or so, a great deal has been written about mission policy in Maluku, ranging from Danckaerts's (1621) essay and Valentyn's (1724-26, III) monograph through the great compendiums of the nineteenth and twen tieth centuries (Van Boetzelaer van Asperen en Dubbeldam 1947; Coolsma 1901; Mooij 1927-31; Swellengrebel 1974; Troostenburg de Bruijn 1893, among others). Here, I want to emphasize two aspects of that long-standing schol arly discourse. First, the Christian mission effort in Maluku was part of the overall VOC enterprise. The VOC paid the salaries,28 set the standards and made the poli cy decisions. Second, as might be expected in a Protestant tradition, from the beginning there was an evolving debate about language choice in the efforts of the mission. These two observations imply that the VOC, through its 'religious policy' (Niemeijer 2001:275), bears responsibility - at least in part - for the ways, good and bad, in which the Protestant church has had an impact on language use and language choice in Maluku. Language and the Christianization of Maluku Beginning in the early sixteenth century, western visitors to Maluku com 27 A similar argument is made by Grimes (1994) in her discussion of language loss among the exiled Muslim communities of coastal Bum. These groups were also resettled as part of De Vlaming's seventeenth-century campaign, and, like the Kelang islanders, never returned to their original villages. Grimes (1994:269) writes: 'there was a fort, the removal of people from their places of origin, a long-standing multi-ethnic, multi-lingual population, and finally - after 250 years - language shift'. 28 Valentyn (1724-26, 111:118-9) provides detailed information about the income of the ministers, including the allowances for French wine and local firewood; an account of altar wine and bread as well as the church's silver candelabras was also included. All were part of the Company's service.</page><page sequence="15">Language death in Maluku 261 merited over and over again on the large number of languages spoken in the Maluku islands (Collins 1980b). If anything, these early observers may have underestimated the number of languages spoken in central Maluku. For example, even in the late twentieth century, at least two previously undocu mented and perhaps unknown languages, Hulung and Naka'ela, were dis covered on the north coast of Seram (Collins 1982, 1983). Another language never documented before was Laha, on Ambon island itself (Collins 1980a, 1983). One can only wonder how many more languages were spoken in cen tral Maluku 400 years earlier.29 Precisely because of the bewildering number of languages named and known in central Maluku, the earliest Christian missionaries, Roman Catholics under the aegis of the Portuguese, made an early decision to use Malay in their proselytizing efforts, especially after the arrival of Francis Xavier in Ambon.30 At the end of the sixteenth century, no fewer than 600 children were studying in two church schools in Ambon; their lessons were taught in Malay (Jacobs 1985:11). Among the many handwritten religious materials that were copied and distributed in Maluku was a catechism writ ten by an Italian Jesuit, Lorenzo Masonio, in 1602. Indeed, Coolsma (1901: 16) reports that when the first Dutch ministers arrived in Ambon they found Catholic religious materials already written (but not printed) in Malay. None of these materials has ever been found, but in the earliest Protestant religious materials published by the VOC, numerous Portuguese loanwords for ecclesial terminology (baptismo, apostolo, sacramento and so forth) can be found, which indicate the development of theological terminology and the distribution of these terms in Malay during the Portuguese period.31 Even after numerous conversions to Islam through a long war with the Ternate sultanate, there were still 16,000 Catholics in central Maluku in 1605 when the VOC gained control of Ambon. Many authors have written about the early problems faced by the VOC 29 However, it must be acknowledged that Rumphius (1983:7) claimed that although there was a large number of dialects on Ambon island all the people understood each other. '[H]oewel se in soo veel dialectos als negorijen verdeelt is soo konnense malkander evenwel verstaan'. 30 Collins 2000:25-6. Of course, the decision to select only one language for the conversion of the peoples of Maluku may also have been motivated by the sociopolitical situation in Europe. The impact of printing on the organization of knowledge, the use of printed materials in the religious struggles between Catholics and Protestants, the emergence of monolingual governments and the writing of the first grammars of modern European languages (Collins 2001) suggest an array of factors (well beyond the shores of Maluku) that may have been behind this early language policy. The role of the highly educated, Basque (a minority language in a very Castillian setting), counter-reformation missionary Francis Xavier should not be underestimated. 31 Collins 1998. In Collins (1992a) a few competing doublets of Portuguese and Malay forms are noted.</page><page sequence="16">262 James T. Collins employees in deciding what language to use in their efforts to explain Calvinism to the Christians of Ambon. The discussion has mostly focused on whether Dutch or Malay was to be used, and the ultimate triumph of Malay as the medium of instruction.32 In fact, there must have been some discus sion about the indigenous languages of central Maluku as well. However, the evidence attesting to that discourse is fragmentary and disconnected. During the library research that led to the publication of his bibliography on the VOC, J. Landwehr (1991:420) found a trace of this discourse when he discovered among the Resoluties van de Heeren XVII 'an entry dated 9 March 1648 regarding their decision to have an Uliasser ABC and an Uliasser prayer book printed' ('ABC en gebedenboek in de Uliassere taal overgezet'). However, Landwehr never found any trace or copy of these books that had been approved for printing, apparently in Saparuan. Even more striking is the information33 that in 1634 Reverend Justus Heurnius, writing from Ulat, on Saparua Island34 (where he had been posted in 1633; see Valentyn 1724-26,111:49), to the Chamber of Amsterdam, reported that he had begun to translate the gospel of Matthew and other parts of scripture into the Uliassische taal, that is the language of Saparua. Moreover, he added that the school teachers (meesters) working on Saparua read the Lord's Prayer, the Ten Commandments and the Articles of Belief in the Uliasse language. The register included in this letter lists a wide range of materials translated into and written in the language of Saparua. Once again, these materials have not been found; not is there any evidence that they were ever published. In fact, the seventeenth century marked an incredible era in the writing and translating of diverse Christian texts for the use of Southeast Asians. Moreover, many of these texts were published in the Netherlands (and later in Batavia), usually at the expense of the VOC, and widely distributed. But all these texts, as far as we know, were published in Malay (Collins 1992b, 2000 among others) or, after the VOC conquest and acquisition of Portuguese Malacca, in Portuguese, but not in any other language of the Southeast Asian archipelago.35 32 See, for example, Groeneboer's narrative and analysis of language choice in seventeenth century Ambon (1993:32-40). 33 This information was provided by my colleague and friend, Betty Litamahuputty, in a message she sent me on 7 May 2002 from Jakarta. I am grateful to her for checking her own archival research notes to find this important piece in the puzzle about language use in the early missionary period. Her careful reading of the early draft of this paper has greatly assisted me in my efforts to improve it for publication. 34 Valentyn (1724-26, 111:49) reports that Heurnius had been posted to Ulat in 1633 where he was very successful in his proselytization efforts. He also notes that in 1635 Heurnius was reported to have been poisoned by Muslims during his last church and school visitation there, causing partial paralysis.</page><page sequence="17">Language death in Maluku 263 On the other hand, the resolution of the VOC directors in 1648 and Heurnius's 1634 letter were not the last instances in the century of official, documented concern to evangelize in the local languages of Maluku. In the late seventeenth century, the VOC minister who served the longest in Ambon was Reverend Franchois Caron.36 In his collected sermons, first pub lished in 1678 in Amsterdam by the VOC, he emphasizes the importance of ministers reaching out to the people of Maluku, including pagans, in their local languages (Caron 1693). In his third sermon on the Lord's Prayer, enti tled 'Rewajat Jang III Pada Mintahan Ca Doa Radjat mou mendatang', on page 82 of the series, he writes: Cardjahan deri pandita pandita, jang jaddi ancat deri pada Tsaurat Igresia, acan menoungou pada orang Nassarani, seperti Combala pada domba domba. Patut djanja adjar bahassa Malejo, daan djica dapat, bahassa Ambon, rewajat trang, begra hati orang di louar di dalam Igresia [...] lagi bacatta catta dengan orang hin dou daan Caffiri, calou deri pada touloungan Allah bole menang barang djiwa. The task of ministers, appointed by the Church Council, is to show the way to Christians, just as a shepherd to his sheep. He should learn Malay, and, if possi ble, the language of Ambon, preach clearly, move hearts both within and outside the Church [...]; moreover, [he should] speak with the pagans and heathens, so that with the help of God he may win a soul. Dominie Caron's own rather extensive published work was all in Malay, not in some local language of Maluku (Collins 1992a). Yet a careful reading of Caron's (1693) sermons indicates some knowledge of the local languages of Ambon. Collins (1992a:lll) provided just one textual example: Tn his denunciation of false gods and demonism, Rewajat Jang J, Pada Penjouroan Bermoula [p. 5], Caron delineated a wide range of idolatrous practices including two customs of the people of Ambon themselves: ... daan orang Ambon mimpi deri Nitou, hormat pada Lanit Boumi. [... and the people of Ambon dream of nitu, pay homage to lanit bumi.] 35 Landwehr (1991) lists six books published during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in Portuguese for the use of the many speakers of Portuguese who had been absorbed into the VOC-controlled areas of South and Southeast Asia. 36 His father, a Huguenot child refugee, the famous Fran?ois Caron lived as a youth in the VOC factory in Hirado, Japan, authored the first book-length study of Japan, served as one of the last VOC governors of Taiwan (Formosa) and began the French East Indies Company. His son, Reverend F. Caron, however, though born in Japan, spent much of his youth studying theology in Leiden and Utrecht and then 12 years in Ambon, before returning to the Netherlands where he supervised the publication of his sermons; see Collins (1992a).</page><page sequence="18">264 James T. Collins Both nitu 'spirit, soul of the dead' and lanit 'sky, heaven' are indigenous words still in use in those languages of Ambon that are still spoken.37 This suggests that Caron was at least familiar with some of the vocabulary of the local languages and, therefore, that at that time, the late seventeenth century, those languages were probably still spoken and still had a role to play in Ambonese society.38 In any case, sometime in the middle of the seventeenth century the VOC decided to use only Malay as the language of churches and church schools. After the letters of Heurnius, the pious advice of Caron and the VOC resolu tion, no further discussion of local languages appears in the sources exam ined so far. Not until the late nineteenth century was the Christian mission again concerned with the languages of central Maluku. The impact of language use in a Calvinist setting has been described by a range of historians. Schama (1988:94) referred to 'the reading, singing and exegesis that went on in Calvinist churches, schools and homes'. Schenke veld (1991:39) goes further in her discussion of the impact of the 1637 Dutch Bible translation, the Statenbijbel, and the sermons based upon it on Dutch society beginning in the seventeenth century. She writes: The translation of the Bible had a profound effect on the language and culture of the Dutch throughout the following centuries. [...] [P]eople attended church twice on Sunday and often went to a third service on an ordinary weekday, listening each time to a sermon with rich exegetical detail. It is not surprising, therefore that the 'language of Canaan' became as it were the second language of many people. In Maluku, the Calvinist tradition of Bible translation, the reading of sermons on a regular basis39 and the development of a school system in which church related materials played a major role are well-documented features of the daily life of the Ambonese. Niemeijer (2001:267) describes the work of Sebastiaan Danckaerts, the second Dutch minister posted to Ambon (1618-1622): He recruited Malukan schoolmasters from the village headmen or orang kaya. The recruits received several years of training in the houses of the Reverends. Working in the village churches, they taught the Heidelberg Catechism to adults. In the schools, they taught the children writing, reading and catechism. At Sunday church 37 For example, in Asilulu, spoken by almost 10,000 people on the northwest coast of Ambon island, these words, [nitu] and [lanit], are widely used (Collins forthcoming). Both these words are inherited Austronesian words: *qanitu and *laNit. 38 Indeed, as late as 1678 Rumphius (1983:7) wrote that the language of Hatiwe on Leitimur was the most elegant (cirelijkste). 39 In 1775 Stavorinus (1969, 11:389) reported on the practice of reading out sermons (when a minister was not available): 'As this person [the only Dutch minister in Ambon city at the time] did not understand the Malay language, and had also very little inclination to attain it, the divine service at present administered in the Malay church was confined to the reading of a sermon, written in the language'.</page><page sequence="19">Language death in Maluku 265 services they read sermons and taught the Christians how to sing psalms and pray. Numerous religious books written or translated in Malay were published by the order of the VOC to support the enterprise of Calvinist consolidation, including in 1623 Danckaerts's translation of the Heidelberg catechism of which 10,000 copies were printed (Landwehr 1991:416). Furthermore, through out the whole latter period of the VOC administration of central Maluku, there is no evidence that any other language (except Dutch, especially within the fort and for Company employees) was ever used in church activities.40 Indeed, the intensity of the use of Malay from the late seventeenth century onward is well-documented. The facts on the ground become more appar ent if we turn to Valentyn's account of church history and religion in central Maluku, Omstandig verhaal van de geschiedenissen en zaaken het Kerkelyke ofte den Godsdienst betreffende zoo in Amboina... For example, Valentyn (1724-26, III: 119-30) reports on his visits in 1708 to 23 church-related schools on the island of Ambon alone. The 2,010 students in these village schools memorized, read and wrote in Malay; and each school was equipped with no fewer than seven different titles of books printed in Malay (Collins 1998), almost always, by the way, including Caron's sermons. For example in Suli, there were nine dif ferent titles and a total of 69 books; in Liliboi seven titles and 19 books (two of which were 'zeer oud en versleten')) in Soya eight titles and 36 books in all. Church schools, church services and church books were a key characteristic of Ambonese Christian society by the end of the seventeenth century. In fact, Caron's book of sermons first published in 1678 was still in use in Ambon's village churches even in the early nineteenth century (Steinhauer 1991:200). The sermons had outlasted the VOC. Language and the Christians of Ambon Caron's book of sermons also outlasted most of the indigenous languages spoken by the Christian communities of Ambon. We cannot be certain about the 'date' of language death in most of Ambon's Christian villages.41 On this island, there was neither language murder (M?hlh?usler's (1996) term), as in Tasmania, nor even collateral war damage, as in Banda. There is no docu mentation (that I know of) to tell us when a language ceased to be used or known in a certain village. A visitor to Ambon in 1821, C.G.C. Reinwardt 40 To my knowledge, the first published translation of Christian material into a language of central Maluku was the gospel of Matthew published in the Masarete dialect of Bum in 1904 (Indjil daribe fili Matthejoes 1904), more than one hundred years after the VOC had come to an end. 41 Nor does it seem possible to determine the date of the appearance of a new variant. Grimes (1994:256), however, claims: 'By 1689 the speech variety spoken around the Ambon fort had crystallised into a distinct form'. One wonders what data are in her possession to indicate the exact year of 'crystallization'.</page><page sequence="20">266 James T. Collins (1858:460), collected vocabularies in a Muslim village (Hitu), but he did not collect vocabularies in Christian villages. Could he have? We do not know for certain. However, it appears that the indigenous languages simply were no longer used or known by the general, rural, Christian population of Ambon island, probably even before the nineteenth century began, and certainly at the end of it. Indeed, in the middle of the nineteenth century, Ludeking (1868:192) reported that the indigenous language had completely died out in the city of Ambon (except among Muslims). A few years later, Van Ho?vell (1876:4-5) observed that in the Christian villages of Ambon island (except Allang, Hatu and Liliboi), the indigenous languages had completely died out, replaced by Ambonese Malay.42 Earlier than that, when there was a renewal of the Christian mission enterprise immediately after the Napoleonic wars, spear headed by the Nederlandsch Zendelinggenootschap, Malay remained the sole language used for the flood of materials produced on printing presses in Ambon (Steinhauer 1991). Even on Saparua, Van Ekris (1864-65:65) reported that the use of the indigenous language was the rule among Muslims, but the exception among Christians.43 Certainly by the end of the nineteenth cen tury, only two languages were still spoken in Ambon's Christian villages. In Allang (and, according to Van Ho?vell at that time, still in Hatu and Liliboi too) a dialect closely related to the language of Wakasihu (Collins 1983) was spoken (see Ludeking 1868). In Waai, a variant similar to the language now used in Tulehu and Liang was still spoken, or at least remembered, as dem onstrated by the wordlist included in Ludeking (1868). On the face of it, Grimes's facile assumption (1991a, 1991b, 1994) that Ambonese Malay remained a 'pidgin' Malay through the eighteenth century 'as it did not result in anyone giving up their native language' seems most unlikely. Similarly, Grimes's assertion (1994:265) that 'some of the League of Nine villages [in the bay of Ambon] eventually began shifting to Ambonese Malay in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries' implies the retention of indigenous languages in Christian villages far later than seems likely. First, while it is true that we do not have clear documentation of language use and language choice, the survival of a hypothetical pidgin language for two or three centuries without becoming anyone's language would be unusual. Moreover, we do know that Stavorinus (1969,11:393-4) noted in 1775 42 Original: 'Wei is waar hebben alle christennegorijen in de afdeeling Ambon, behalve Alang, Hatoe en Liliboi, zoo ook de negorij Tiouw en Saparoea [eiland Saparoea], hare landtaal geheel voor het Maleisch Men varen, maar overigens is de oude bahasa nog in gebruik'. 43 Original: 'Ht. staat voor Hatawano, de noordkust van Saparoea. Daar is het gebruik der landtaal bij de Islamieten regel, hi) de Christenen uitzondering.'</page><page sequence="21">Language death in Maluku 267 that married women, the wives of Europeans in Ambon city, were 'always accustomed to speak the Malay tongue, they felt awkward, and they were apprehensive of expressing themselves in Dutch'. So it seems that in the late eighteenth century at least this group of persons living in Ambon could be considered as speakers of Malay as their first language. It is likely that there were other segments of society who used Malay as their primary language. Second, in Christian villages around the bay of Ambon, probably as early as the eighteenth century the indigenous languages had ceased to be used. For there to be no memory of the languages as early as 1876 ('died out', as Van Ho?vell wrote) strongly suggests a loss of at least two generations. Language maintenance studies have repeatedly demonstrated that even decades after a language is no longer used, there are usually members of the community who can still remember some elements of the language: a 60-year old who remembers using it with her grandparents, an elderly widow who used to speak it with her husband's aunt and so forth. So, it is more likely that, as Ambon emerged from the last days of VOC rule in the late eighteenth century, most Christian villages on Ambon island already no longer spoke an indigenous language; rather, they had already indigenized Ambonese Malay to replace their ancestral languages. It is important to explore the approximate sequence of events that led to language death. If, for example, we assume that Ambon entered the nine teenth century with its indigenous languages intact, we could point to a whole cluster of documented factors that might have led to language death, among them: the introduction of printing presses to Ambon, the development of newspapers, the establishment of schools and teacher training institutions, the recruitment of Christian villagers into the colonial army, steamboats, the Suez Canal, the influenza epidemic of 1918. However, if, as I claim here, most of Ambon's Christian villages entered the nineteenth century no longer speaking their indigenous languages and speaking only Ambonese Malay as their home language, then the individual factors causing indigenous lan guage loss were fewer. And all of them point to the VOC, the sole authority throughout the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries.44 The fact that language loss was most severe in Christian villages is not a coincidence. By saying that religious affiliation is relevant here does not mean that adopting Christianity automatically leads to language loss. Rather, the culture of language use among Christians in Ambon, especially during 44 Ludeking (1868:193) writes emphatically: The history, that posterity will note, of what was done and not done in the name of the Dutch in this residency, will have to document the remarkable fact that it was once suggested to forbid the bahasas [indigenous languages] in general. This image of the language of a people manacled and destroyed in such a way is not born out of naivete/</page><page sequence="22">268 James T. Collins the VOC era, was very different from that among Muslims. The intensive, exclusive use of Malay in churches and in church schools (and in the seven teenth and eighteenth centuries there were no other schools but church-affili ated schools) is a well-documented fact. This is the central fact of Ambon's Christian villages: generation after generation of students whose only lan guage of education and religion was Malay. Coupled with this was the need to know Malay to deal with the VOC administration. Archival documents written in what can only be described as Ambonese Malay abound; some have been published.45 In Ambon during the VOC period, then, Malay was the exclusive lan guage of church, school and (perhaps alongside Dutch) in the courts and land offices. Note, for example, Nieuhoff's (1988:167) 1659 description of the 'civil court of judicature' and the 'council of state'. According to him, the majority of the members of these judicial and adminstrative bodies were indigenous Ambonese. We can conclude that Malay were used in their proceedings. Indeed, in the National Archives of the Netherlands, a transcript of evidence from a 1632 trial taken by Jan Pays, who was later drawn and quartered for his involvement in an anti-VOC uprising, was written in Malay, perhaps the first example of an indigenous Southeast Asian writing Malay in Latin script - and this in a court of colonial law.46 Indeed, all the domains of language use recorded in known documents before the nineteenth century point to the nearly exclusive use of Malay among almost all of Ambon's Christians. It is worth noting that we also have VOC-period legal documents and petitions written in Malay from Muslim villages. But these villages, in fact, today still use their indigenous languages as their home languages. A well known example is Hila, where a variant of Hitu (Collins 1983) is spoken by young and old, even though Hila was resettled below a VOC fort in the seventeenth century. The difference between Hila and Hatiwe, for example, is one of religious affiliation, which in the VOC period also implied access to education. It is difficult to doubt that becoming or being a Christian in Ambon dur ing the VOC period was a major factor in indigenous language loss probably as early as the eighteenth century and certainly in the early nineteenth cen tury. This occurred not because of some inherent characteristic of Christianity 45 A short example of this somewhat legalistic Ambonese Malay is found in Bertling (1925: 387): 'Orangkaja kata tuwan Radja tjakej pada beta sebab beta sudah djuwal sapangal tanah kuskusu di pingir tuwan Rabbe punja kabon kalu tuwan bangsjawan jang mulija pasijar dengan kareta beleb lihat akan tijada barang apa-apa dalamnja tnelajinkan djuga kuskusu pada 25 real pada Christian Rheebock'. 46 Collins 1997.1 would like to thank Gerrit Knaap, who in 1994 first drew my attention to the existence of this document, and Ron Habiboe, who generously helped me find it in The Hague.</page><page sequence="23">Language death in Maluku 269 but because Christianity in central Maluku was part of a larger pattern of lan guage behaviour. Many pieces of that pattern were shared equally by Muslim Ambonese (courts, wills, land disputes and paying taxes by oral interview), but in the Christian villages the role of Malay in churches and in church schools tipped the scales in favour of language shift. With the exception of the exiled villages of Kelang and Batumerah (and apparently those of coastal Bum (Grimes 1994)), this simply did not happen among Muslim villages.47 Although elsewhere he expresses optimism about the survival of the remaining indigenous languages of central Maluku on Seram,48 Van Ho?veil's observations on the different cultures of Malay language use in his era supports the general argument here that there were substantive differences between Muslim and Christian cultures of language use. He writes: [A]s for the Muhammadans [on Seram], Malay is even more unfavorably placed, because they do not so frequently come in contact with officials and miss the influ ence of church and school. Also in the Lease Islands the slammen [Muslims] for the same reasons use Malay less at home. With Christians Malay is far better placed. (Van Ho?vell 1876:5.) Discussion The decision to change one's home language to another language is not uncommon. When this change is abrupt and observed, it might be called language suicide. But when it proceeds slowly, generation after generation, it is simply language shift. Many factors can contribute to language shift, even when no resettlement or genocide is involved. Shift can proceed incremen tally, often on a family by family basis. Crystal (2000:78-9) provides a typol 47 Much is made by Grimes (1994) of alienation and language loss caused by the resettlement of Christian villages to the coast as a factor in language loss among Christian Ambonese. Perhaps the author did not know that almost all Muslim villages on the island of Ambon are also the products of massive resettlement and population mixing, not just from remote hamlets in the interior areas of Ambon island, but with acknowledged migrants from the interior of Seram and Saparua, as well as Java and Sulawesi. In 1977-1979, the time of my most intensive research, these Ambon villages, with the unique exception of Batumerah, noted above, had maintained their languages. Moreover, even among the Christian villages that did not experience resettlement, such as Kilang and Soya, the loss of indigenous languages was just as widespread as in other Christian villages and probably had occurred even earlier. Furthermore, it should be noted that Ambonese villages that were historically Muslim but later were drawn into Christianity during the Portuguese and Dutch periods, such as Halong and Latuhalat, had also suffered the loss of their languages, though neither was resettled. We cannot but conclude that religion is connected to language loyalty in central Maluku. 48 Van Ho?vell (1876:6) wrote: 'zij op Ceram zieh nog veel langer zal handhaven en de heerschende taal blijven zal'.</page><page sequence="24">Legend Tg. Nusaniwe Map 3. Ambon island and the distribution of languages and religion</page><page sequence="25">Language death in Maluku 271 ogy of language shift under the pressure of cultural assimilation. Language is an emblem of culture, and when a culture is denigrated and ridiculed the members of that cultural community acquire negative attitudes about their own language. These attitudes are introduced by a more dominant culture, whose members stigmatize the peo ple in such terms as stupid, lazy, and barbaric [...] and their languages as ignorant, backward, deformed, inadequate or even (in the case of some missionaries) a crea tion of the devil (Crystal 2000:84). These are the attitudes that preceded and followed upon the VOCs decision to use Malay as the language of the Protestant church in central Maluku. The decision itself was made to ensure that in the most effective and least expensive manner Protestantism could be explained to the existing Christian adherents as well as others who might be attracted to this religion. It was a rational, even pious, decision based on available resources and, prob ably in part, on the developing sense of language nationalism in Europe. Nonetheless, a directive such as this, made without rancour or a hidden agenda, has had serious and damaging effects on the indigenous languages of Maluku. Indeed, cultural attitudes in seventeenth-century Ambon parallel those sketched by Crystal above. Groeneboer (1998:31) cites Danckaerts's seven teenth-century assessment of 'the dull-witted and lazy Ambonese'. Indeed, Danckaerts's 1621 essay (1621:2-11) has pages of discussion of satanism and Ambonese heathen superstitions {'van der Amboinesen Heydensche Superstitien'), ranging from 'Mattacau' (according to Danckaerts, a form of taking the devil's oath), the worship of 'Lenthila' ('the supreme devil') and 'Taulay' (another 'devil among many') as well as 'Zivangif ('witchcraft' and sorcery). Coupled with racist attitudes about European superiority, the bru tality of colonial occupation, the monopolistic control of clove production (Wright 1958) and a persistent, strong belief in satanism,49 those rational, economic decisions about language use in church and school led to the loss of almost every language spoken by Christians in Ambon by at least the mid nineteenth century, and more likely earlier. Today, 400 years after the founding of the VOC, more and more Maluku 49 An idea of how these attitudes might have been interpreted in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries can be drawn from the contemporary setting of Christian villages on Seram converted in the twentieth century. Florey (2001:337) notes 'the pressure exerted on villages by missionaries and ministers to cease the use of Alune [an indigenous language of Seram]. Malay is the language of Christianity - the language that demonstrates that villagers have moved out of the masa gelap, the 'dark era', which denotes the pre-Christian period.' This pressure often included 'physical punishment' (Florey 2001:335).</page><page sequence="26">272 James T. Collins languages are dying in Christian villages. On the island of Ambon, a line can be drawn between villages where indigenous languages are still spoken and those where they are no longer spoken. In general, that line would also separate Christian and Muslim villages (see Map 3). Allang, where the local language was still spoken at the beginning of the twentieth century, now retains only a shadow of its language: partially remembered vocabulary strung together in Malay syntax patterns used by some of the older villagers as a secret language, not as a language of daily use (Collins 1990).50In Liliboi and Hatu, as well as Waai, not even this mere trace remains. On the Uliasse (Lease) islands the view is the same: language loss in Christian villages. In Nusalaut, all villages are Christian. Van Ekris (1864-65: 65-6) was of the opinion that there were two dialects spoken at that time in Nusalaut: Amet, spoken only in that village and similar to the language of Saparua in its treatment of /t/, and Nalahia, which was the dialect spoken in all the other villages. Now, almost 150 years later, not a trace of the language survives except perhaps in Titawae. Ten years ago there may have been a few older persons in Titawae, who could remember the language,51 but the assessment (Kotynski 1989:9) was that Nusalaut was 'a dying language'. In Saparua, there is no Christian village that uses the indigenous language. In Haruku some Christian villagers retain a knowledge of their language, though the extent of its use among Christians is not clear.52 In the western part of Seram, from Piru to Amahai, the pattern is roughly the same. In most coastal Christian villages, the language is either extinct or almost extinct: Piru, Eti, Waesamu, Hatusua, Kamarian, Paulohi, Makariki, Amahai. In almost all of these 'old' Christian villages, that is those villages that were Christian during the VOC era - indeed most were converted dur ing the seventeenth century - the language is lost or remembered only by a few, but not commonly used. Even in some of the villages converted to Christianity only in the twentieth century, the language is endangered (Florey 1990). 50 Van Ho?vell (1876:5-6) makes a similar observation: Tn the presence of Europeans the inlander prefers the bahasa; the language serves as an argot and numerous niceties are allowed at the cost of the unsuspecting foreigner'. 51 However, my observations during various trips in 1972 to Akoon, the smallest village of Nusalaut, indicates that the local dialect of Ambonese Malay displayed a number of divergent lexical items, suggesting a Nusalaut substratum. So perhaps there are some traces, indeed even half-remembered mantras used at the traditional shrine in Pusat Pulau (Tsland Centre') of Nusalaut. I am very grateful to the Berhitu family of Ambon and Akoon who made my visits to Nusalaut opportunities to learn about the culture and language of the island. 52 Kotynski 1989. On Haruku there is a large Haruku-speaking Muslim population. In 1986, those Christian Harukans whose villagers were near Muslim villages reported using the Haruku language with their Muslim neighbours. To what extent this pattern of interchange has persisted is unknown and doubtful, after the outbreak of communal violence.</page><page sequence="27">Language death in Maluku 273 And on Seram's south coast this pattern of dead or dying languages in villages where the religion is Christian contrasts with the viability of indig enous languages in Muslim villages (Collins 1983). In Muslim Luhu, two languages are spoken: Luhu, the language indigenous to Hoamoal spoken daily by thousands of Luhu villagers - 15,000 by Payapo's (Collins 1980: 8) estimate - and Saparuan, spoken in two small villages adjacent to Luhu, Iha and Kulur, where 1,000 speakers (Collins 1977-79) are descendants of Muslims exiled from Saparua. Further east at the entrance to Elpaputi Bay, in Latu, Tumalehu and Hualoi (estimated total population more than 2,000), other dialects of Saparuan are spoken by all generations. The exception to this pattern of language retention in Muslim villages of Seram's south coast is Ruta (population 1,100), where in 1978 the language, a dialect of Amahai, was still spoken, but only by the middle-aged and oldest generations (Collins 1977-79, 2002). As noted above, many factors play a role in language loss. Certainly we know that in the case of Paulohi, Amahai and Ruta (formerly Amahai Islam) the earthquake and subsequent tidal wave on 30 September 1899 contrib uted to the near extinction of the Paulohi and Amahai languages.53 But the overall pattern of language loss in Christian villages and language retention in Muslim villages still has to be reckoned with. In the absence of forced, violent resettlement (Kelang in Manipa) or massive natural disaster (Ruta near Amahai), Muslim villages by and large have retained their indigenous languages. This is simply not the pattern in Christian villages. As Niemeijer (2001:274-5) demonstrates: The VOC facilitated political and religious changes in Maluku, but always with an eye toward satisfying strong and competing local and regional demands. Deep rooted traditional religions made real conversions questionable and limited. Only islands close to the colonial centres (such as the Lease islands) could regularly welcome Dutch ministers and achieve success in Christian education. Here a tentative conclusion is reached. The attitudes instilled by the VOC controlled church and the policies put into place during the VOC period have had a deleterious effect on the survival of the languages of Maluku spoken in Christian villages.54 A closer study of available documents, especially unpub lished archival materials, may test and refine this modest hypothesis. 53 As pointed out in Collins (2002): 'Stresemann (1918:xxii) estimated that no fewer than 1450 of the 1550 total number of Paulohi speakers, that is an appalling 94%, died on a single day, 30 September 1899, when the twin village Paulohi-Samasuru slipped into the sea from the force of an earthquake followed by a nine-meter high tsunami. On the same day, across the bay in Amahai, 348 speakers of the Amahai language also died from the same tidal wave/ See Verbeek (1900) for a more detailed report.</page><page sequence="28">274 James T. Collins Conclusion This brief and very pedantic study of the VOC and its apparent connection to the death of an undetermined number of languages in Maluku is not intend ed as a belated condemnation of corporate greed, VOC or otherwise. Even less is it a condemnation of Christianity in Maluku. Rather it is a reminder for today's national and local governments, NGOs, corporations and church councils; it is a cautionary tale about the unforeseen consequences of adminis trative policies and decisions.55 What is at stake is language, one of 'our most valuable human intellectual resources' (Mithun 1988:163). Language ecology, in Mufwene's (2001) careful use of that term, is as delicate as zootic ecology. The introduction of new and beneficial chemicals, life forms and methods of cultivation may have unexpected results among local life forms. Similarly, a shift in the surroundings, economies, religion and lifestyles of language communities may have unpredicted consequences for the languages of those communities, especially traditional languages spoken by demographic and social minorities.56 I cannot pretend to have studied language maintenance and language loss as part of my program of research in Maluku 25 years ago. Much of the pres entation here has been impressionistic, rather than data-based. Other schol ars have conducted detailed and focused research in this field in Indonesia, even in understudied Maluku. M. Florey's pioneering work (1990,1991,1993, 2001 among her other studies) is exemplary in this respect; few other scholars have undertaken this kind of intense microsociolinguistic research. On the other hand, in Maluku, even research in which language maintenance and language shift are not emphasized cannot but be entwined with the issues of language life and death. Maluku is a region of enormous language complexity, both historical and contemporary. The large number of languages spoken by small communities 54 Even on the north coast of Seram, where Christianity only began to make inroads at the beginning of the twentieth century, languages are dying in Christian villages: Noniali, Hulung and Naka'ela; but the indigenous languages are still widely used in Muslim villages (Collins 1977-79). 55 Whaley's (2001:117-9) thumbnail sketch of the contrasting social histories of two obsolescent Manchu-Tungusic languages, Evenki spoken in Russia and Oroqen spoken in China, demonstrates the impact of the policies of two different communist governments and their respective administrative policies on the patterns of contact experienced by the speakers of these related languages. 56 Mufwene (2001:152) lists six reasons for analogizing language as a 'parasite7 and its speakers as the parasite's 'host'. Among these reasons: '[A] language falls into attrition and/or dies if things are done to its hosts which do not enable it to thrive, for instance, if its speakers are relocated to an environment where another language must be spoken as a vernacular'.</page><page sequence="29">Language death in Maluku 275 in an area with a long history of colonial exploitation and contemporary tur moil, combined with an epidemiological profile of typically low life expect ancy57 and poor health care services, increases the chances of a researcher witnessing the death of a language she or he has worked on within her or his lifetime. Language death and language attrition are facts of a researcher's life in Maluku; even mere historical linguists cannot be unconcerned with or unaware of the relentless decline and loss of indigenous languages. To reconstruct the social history of a handful of villages in the swampy backwaters of central Maluku may indeed be an ill-advised exercise. The few data available, for example, published population figures - (seemingly solid, reliable numbers), are subject to the skepticism of acknowledged experts in the field. And then to take the argument further by attempting to connect that shadowy social history to a societal phenomenon of today, namely language obsolescence, is perhaps even less credible. After all, we are examining lan guages and societies whose histories have been partially obliterated, with, as M. Ondaatje (1992:7) writes in The English patient, 'gaps of plot like sections of a road washed out by storms, missing incidents as if locusts had consumed a section of tapestry, as if plaster loosened by the bombing had fallen away from a mural at night'. Nonetheless, however ill-advised and preliminary it may be, a start must be made towards understanding the historical evolution of language and society in Maluku, even now shaken loose by bombs, consumed by locusts. In part, this essay is a response to Mufwene's (2001:127-41) challenge to his torical linguists, who have largely neglected peripheral languages and their social histories. However, this essay also addresses the misrepresentation of Maluku and its peoples so current today. The present-day journalistic simplifications of the internal relationships of Maluku's subgroups must be replaced by a close examination of the region's history, as in the work of Knaap and Niemeijer, in tandem with the study of a wide array of contem porary sociological phenomena, such as language death, as in the studies conducted by Florey. Written by neither a historian nor a sociolinguist, this essay provides many opportunities for improvement and revision. I have tried to explore the question raised by Grenoble and Whaley (1988:22): '[W]hy do linguisti cally related groups with similar histories manifest significantly different rates of language obsolescence?' But many issues remain unresolved and 57 In a relatively well-educated, progressive village located on the coast, like Kaibobo (Christian since at least 1645 (Niemeijer 2001:269)), 64% of the population of 1,053 persons in 1976 was 24 years old or younger; only 10% of the population was 55 years or older. These were the statistics in a village where, furthermore, a tradition persisted in which children were not allowed ('tidak diperkenangkari) to use the indigenous language (Collins 1977-79).</page><page sequence="30">276 James T. Collins can only be approached through intensive, long-term participant observation research paralleled by a careful assessement of available historical resources. The intent of this essay is merely to present a few data from languages rarely studied, such as Kelang and Piru, to explore historical documents seldom used, such as seventeenth-century Calvinist sermons written in Malay in Ambon, and to suggest some avenues for further research. In an earlier paper (Collins 1999), I argue that the loss of certain emblems of identity, like language, is often compensated for by overemphasizing other emblems of identity, like religion. It may be that language loss and the recent loss of thousands of lives in sectarian violence are connected. But these are sociological issues of great complexity well beyond the reach of comparative historical linguistics.</page><page sequence="31">Language death in Maluku 277 Appendix 1. One-hundred-word vocabularies from Westernmost Seram and the adjacent islands: Hoamoal languages The five Central Maluku languages represented in this brief appendix are spoken on or near the Hoamoal Peninsula, the westernmost reach of Seram Island that stretches southward towards Ambon island. These data were collected between November 1977 and July 1978. In two cases, Luhu and Manipa, data collection began in Asilulu village on Ambon island, work ing with speakers of those two languages who happened to be in Asilulu. But those two early lists were both checked and revised later on Seram and Manipa respectively. The other three lists were only collected in villages where the languages are spoken, although there were later opportunities to consult with speakers of Luhu and Manipa in Ambon city. These data, then, were elicited in Luhu (Seram), Piru (Seram), Luhutubang (Manipa), Kelang Asaude (Manipa) and Boano Utara (Boano). Luhu and Piru I visited four or five times each, but Manipa and Boano only once each. The full lists collected 25 years ago vary in length from only 450 words (Kelang) to more than 3,000 (Luhu). In both Boano and Luhu recordings were made and transcribed. The names of the villagers who generously and patiently explained their languages to me can be found in Collins (1983). However, I reiterate here my gratitude to all of them and to the many other people of Maluku who assisted me, indeed befriended me, during the two years I spent conducting doctoral research among them. The very small sam ple of one hundred words presented here in this appendix is intended merely as an indication of the level of relationship among these five language vari ants so that readers need not rely solely on my assessments. Publication of full sets of the data is planned. As was explained in some detail in Collins (1983), the morphologies of many of the languages in Central Maluku include two systems of genitive pronominal cliticization marking the distinction between alienable and inalienable nouns. For example, most body parts occur with postposed pronominal markers; so, /ulu/ 'head' seldom occurs without specifying a genitive relationship, such as /uluku/ 'my head' or /ulura/ 'our heads'. In the field data this phenomenon was sometimes noted by writing out the full citation as provided by the informant, /ulura/ 'our heads', or by making a decision to abbreviate, /ulu-/ 'head', where the dash simply means that gen itive markers are postposed. In the present sociopolitical situation in Central Maluku, it is not possible to re-check these data and to attempt imposing a uniform notation system. Rather than distort the data, they are simply presented here as they were collected. Similarly, stress is sometimes marked with an accent mark, but sometimes it is not marked. Again, to avoid possible distortion, these field inconsistencies have been retained in the appendix.</page><page sequence="32">278 James T. Collins Another feature of Central Maluku morphologies is verbal conjuga tion; see again Collins (1983). Many of these languages display obligatory inflectional change to mark the person, number and gender (human and non-human) of the sentential agent. For example, in Luhu /uahoi/ 'I bathe' contrasts with /ipahoi/ 'He or she bathes', as does /usa/a/ 'I climb' and /ira/a/ 'He or she climbs'. These languages have four to five regular conju gations and in some cases a few irregular patterns of verbal inflection. In this appendix, there are examples of some of the inflected verbs. Thus, in Luhu, for example, (p)asanau 'to engage in sewing' is distinguished from I p I etu 'to plait' because they belong to two different conjugations.
