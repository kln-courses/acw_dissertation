<plain_text><page sequence="1">by James G. Southivorth HUGH Mac DIARMID WITHIN recent years poetry has again swung decidedly to the left.1 So marked is this tendency that it is in danger of becoming a literary pose rather than the expression of a passionate conviction. In England, the movement is under standable because of two dominint factors: the first and most important is the sudden awakening of the young intellectual to the conditions of the laboring classes brought about by the gen eral strike of 1926 when, for the first time, he was brought into contact with reality; the second is the impetus to this awakened sensibility given by D. H. Lawrence. In Scotland, too, the move ment has found its interpreter in the work of the ardent and im passioned nationalist, Mr. Hugh Mac Diarmid,2 who, through the medium of metrical language in Scots dialect and in English, has given expression to his wide range of interests. Mr. Mac Diarmid is at present, I believe, known but to a comparatively small circle of American readers; and the fault is largely his own that that circle is not wider. The subject matter of his poetry is provocat ive and substantial, and in his more recent work the expression is straightforward and simple in an easily understood idiom. But the extreme use of an esoteric dialect in his earlier volumes ob scured the essential simplicity of many lyrics and made difficult the apprehension of the philosophic nature of such a work as Circumjack Cencrastus? Compared with his Southern neighbor 2I say "again" advisedly. Had the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries had the same predilection for the word "left" as we, they certainly would have applied it to the newer romantic poetry of the day. 2Mr. C. M. Grieve has progressively spelt his pen name M'Diarmid, McDiar mid, and Mac Diarmid. aThe general reader would do well to make his first acquaintance with Mr. Mac Diarmid through the volume Second Hymn to Lenin and Other Poems, and follow it with Mr. Mac Diarmid's own selection of his earlier poems. He can then fill in the gaps as he becomes more familiar with his mode of communica tion?. The following is a partial bibliography: Sangschaw (1925); Penny Wheep (1926); The Lucky Bag ( ? ); A Drunk Man Looks at the Thistle ( ?);</page><page sequence="2">106 by JAMES G. SOUTHWORTH the Scots Lowlander has always been less imaginative and more philosophic. He has exalted the powers of reason. Mr. Mac Diarmid is no exception. His poetry not only teems with ideas stimulated by a close knowledge of the British as1 well as the con tinental philosophers, but reveals the poet philosophizing on his own profession. Too many times, however, he forgets his duty as a poet and his expression becomes matter-of-fact. He fails to communicate to the reader the enthusiasm which the idea proba bly aroused in him. With his predilection for philosophy, it is not strange, therefore, to find that in his poetry he has developed at considerable length his conception of the function of a poet, that he has beaten out his own personal philosophy, crystallizing the distilled essence of a moment realized in love of nature, in ad^ dition to having presented his strong convictions on politics, re ligion, patriotism, and nationalism. Differing markedly from the intuitive D. H. Lawrence, Mr. Mac Diarmid likes thought. He likes poems that are dry and hard;?and not those which, suiting the general taste, are "fozy wi' infinity". Thought is attractive to him because it leads to the only things worth having. It has, moreover, kept him from the belief that the best way of life is that of him who in the material processes of life lays waste his powers. As he remarks in "De Profundis", and even more forcefully in "Folly", the wise man is the one whom the world frequently takes to be the fool. He has chosen to live, whereas the majority in the world have spent "their lives wasting their reasons for living." Most persons are apathetic until something stirs them from their lethargy, even though that something might have to be death ("Salmon Leap"). Thought has also led him to explore the paradox of genius, the unexplainable. Extending the basic idea of Shelley's "Hymn to Intellectual Beauty", he expresses the need of a "technique for genius", because, as matters now stand, we cannot tell from whence it will spring?certainly good birth is no criterion ("The Burning Passion"). Or, failing that, we need to find a means whereby all that genius has accomplished will be the starting point of all men's lives.

The mind of man can create no ideas although "it is ideas alone that create". Or, expressed more clear ly in the final stanza of "Birth of a Genius Among Men", he mentions how, while lying awake, he . . . heard the faint voices of them discuss The way in which they could only express themselves yet In fragmentary and fallacious forms through us, an idea which bears a startling resemblance to Protagoras' belief that 'man is the measure of things'. Although he will not pander to the popular taste, Mr. Mac Diarmid has little patience with those poets who do not write for the masses of men or who are content to copy the themes used by their predecessors. Poets cannot produce great work and at the same time surrender, to the crowd. If their work is to be worth reading, they must think for themselves, not be content to work over the notions of "slaverin' savages". Since ours is "a frenzied and chaotic age", it becomes increasingly necessary to find "men capable of rejecting all that other men think, as a stone remains the essential to the world, inseparable from it". In re gard to themselves, however, Mr. Mac Diarmid believes that "maist men are prehistoric still!" Inthis group he places some of the great Victorians as well as Goethe who, since he did not get beneath the surface of life, has no message for mankind; he lacks universality. To his statement that the soul has a right to change according to its impacts, impacts which preclude the possibility of a poet's dwelling in an ivory tower, no one will object. Nor will he, how ever, find anything particularly new in such an idea. How is growth measured but by the changing soul?4 That poetry no longer holds the exalted place in man's life that it once did, he would be the first to admit. Or, expressed differently, "Nature never abandoned a fairer aince-mair-promisin' field". Although poetry as embodied in particular poems does not seem to be permanent?like a life that is lived bravely for a moment and then goes "away to the void again"?it only seems so because we ourselves are so temporary. "Soul" is a dangerous word. It, too, is fozy wi' infinity.</page><page sequence="4">108 by JAMES G. SOUTHWORTH Such are some of his general ideas about poetry. In particular it should be the property of the man in the street; it should con cern itself with "real ends", i. e. vital problems, because it would then be the world's greatest force for good; it should get to the very essence of the thing; it must be the result of an examination of all phases of life with which the poet has closely associated himself in order that it will be understanding. In other words, poetry should carry us as far as it can beyond nature and the common man: it should carry us towards an ultimate goal which now seems like the ideal. Mr. Mac Diarmid, although not interested in personal glory, wishes for his own poetry that it might arouse his race, that through it the world might find an outlet for what it has long been seeking. He is aware, however, that something within him is missing that will make possible such an achievement. In his youth he experienced sensations akin to those of Wordsworth in "Tintern Abbey". Earlier, nature haunted him like a passion; then he changed. Regretfully he admits that he has fallen short of his goal, because although possessed of a live and passionate thought he has been unable to communicate it to the world. In theory Mr. Mac Diarmid's conception of poetry differs little from that of Wordsworth or Matthew Arnold. He realizes that a poem must not primarily be direct propaganda. One golden lyric is of more value than the solution of a particular social problem because it makes men less like apes and is a beacon light to the leaders, although "they're owre blin' to see it". II I have no quarrel with Mr. Mac Diarmid's general conception of the poet and poetry, or with his particular pronouncements. It is his application of these tenets that challenges the reader of his work.5 First, however, let us pursue our examination of the subject matter before attempting an evaluation of his aesthetic achievement. Patriotism, for example, is no empty flag-waving pseudo-patri BI have perhaps given too detailed a treatment of his pronouncements, and yet from the frequency and the exhaustive treatment of this subject in his poetry it is evident that the problem is one of his vital concerns.</page><page sequence="5">HUGH Mac DIARMID 109 otism blinding him to his country's faults. It is a conviction that springs from his love of the very starkness of the Scottish land scape, one whose infinite variety cannot be described in English words, a variety, however, with a basic unity like that which he hopes underlies his own work, a basic unity or spirit that he wishes his countrymen to understand. He reveals this aspect of his patriotism in "The Little White Rose", and even more forcefully in the much longer "Water Music". The reverse side of this aspect is his bitterness towards those Scotsmen?expatriated or not?who speak of their love for Scotland and yet passively see her decay. Among such are those of the nobility who spend their substance in London, many ecclesiastics who have lost the spirit of Christ, and selfish politicians. Those who have most profited from her have been her betrayers. The presence of tenements, hunger, and uncultivated land attest the little that has been done in the past hundred years. But not only have the leaders be trayed her! Ninety percent of her sons have likewise done so. Since much of the degradation of Scotland has resulted from her union with England?when the Scots exchanged the great music of the bagpipes for the English hurdy-gurdy?the only cure lies in separation. He is, and he urges his fellow-countrymen to be, strong nationalists. No one can serve Scotland "without muckle trial and trouble to himsel' ".6 Inasmuch as Mr. Mac Diarmid carries his convictions to the point of a religious fervor it is little wonder that he finds little spiritual companionship among his relatives. A prophet is per force a nuisance to his own family. The love-religion, he de clares, has nowhere had a harder struggle than in Scotland, whose people, unfortunately, have fought in all the sham fights of the world, but have not fought the more important fight with them selves. Until they do, however, there is no hope for them, nor can there be anything in common between him and his country men. In his "Lament for the Great Music" he not only urges the Scotsman to carry on his great tradition of culture, but makes a natural transition from the more immediate aspect of his patri This aspect of his patriotism is, according to one of my Scottish! friends, the sentimental reactions of a typical Highlander. It is the Lowlander that is the practical person. According to such a classification Mr. Mac Diarmid would seem to be a combination of both elements.</page><page sequence="6">110 by JAMES G. SOUTHWORTH otism to its larger aspect as manifested in the following pro nouncement of his political ideology: I am horrified by the triviality of life, by its corruption and help lessness, No prospect of eternal life, no fullness of existence, no love without betrayal, No passion without satiety. Yet life could be beautiful even now. But all is soiled under philistine rule ... Yet there is no great problem in the world to-day Except disease and death men cannot end If no man tries to dominate another. He disagrees with those economists who believe that the tra ditional economics is the only valid system. He is at odds with those religionists who in order to maintain the status quo present the concept of an anthropomorphic God. He bolsters his position in the straightforward "First Objectives" by voicing his determin ation to eliminate class distinctions, war, capitalism, the church? all those things, in other words, that repress rather than point the way to a fuller life. That person who admonishes us to "hold?have a care", and who thereby prevents us from experi encing the soul quality of enjoying the "divine in human or hu man in divine" is our natural enemy. He is everywhere about us ; he is the upholder of a wrong concept of the aims of man and of the universe. The glory of mankind lies today where it has ever lain?in the goodness, simplicity, and patience of the vast majority of persons. Man can have what he wants and what is his due if he will only free himself from the antiquated concept of economics and will realize that his class, not the so-called upper classes, possesses the power. In fact, the life-force needs the lowly things if it needs anything at all. It has little use for those of the idle leisure class. Mr. Mac Diarmid is indignant at those who toady to royalty and is vitriolic against the abuses of capitalism. If to insist upon every man's right to the physical and spiritual values of life be communistic, then he is an ardent communist. Like most of the young poets and some of the so-called radical leaders he believes that laissez faire is a thing of the past and that equality of opportunity must be provided for all. His admiration for Lenin lies in Lenin's insistence upon such a concept. In spite of any</page><page sequence="7">HUGH Mac DIARMID 111 criticism that might be levelled against Lenin's methods, the fund amental fact remains that it is the thing done that counts, not how it is done. Had not the powers of Life and Thought been misused for the many, Lenin's methods would have been unnec essary. With a man's work to do Lenin behaved like a man and not like a child as most of us have been doing. After all, what does it matter whom we kill if it will "lessen the foulest murder that deprives maist men of real lives"? Mr. Mac Diarmid has little patience with bibliolaters or with those who cloak love and religion in mysteries. The two are "naked and unashamed", and should be so treated. Why deny them, or why defame them? The Scotch religion particularly, with its traditional gloominess, is a woesome sight devoid of vital ity. Like so much formal religion it has denied the principles of Christ. Most of the so-called professing Christians?like the church itself?are greedy and self-seeking. They find smugness in the belief of Christ's sacrifice for mankind. Such fools are ever ready to give their opinions on God, life, death, and other mys teries. It is only the wise man who, aware of his own limitations, is willing to postpone all such thoughts. Why, he asks, be anxious about the future? Anyone who has come "from sperm to matur ity" has undergone so many changes that he need fear no more; his limits are determined by himself. Mr. Mac Diarmid, himself a great admirer of Christ, is essentially a mystic in his approach to the problem of God, and believes that truths greater than ra tionalistic ones spring from the subconscious mind. "A Dog's Life" and "An Apprentice Angel" are interesting side-lights on his general thought. He realizes that where there is too much talk about souls and God there is apt to be too little of the real spirit. "Prayer for a Second Flood", like so many of his poems with a religious cast, is essentially political in essence. It is a plea for a broader hu manity. A striking quality of contemporary poetry is, in fact, the spirit of revolt from a religion whose essence is form and whose priests constitute a hierarchy of privilege in favor of a practical application of the golden rule. I do not believe that the average American reader has any conception of the thought ful young Britisher's attitude towards the Established Church.</page><page sequence="8">112_by JAMES G. SOUTHWORTH Mr. Mac Diarmid is aware, as many of his fellow enthusiasts are not, but as D. H. Lawrence certainly was, that it is almost impossible for the intellectual to become one with the working classes. Theoretically, one can talk about becoming one, but their body smells, their insensitivity, and their coarseness fre quently repel the would-be fraterniser. But no vicarious living among them is possible. The artist must go beyond the border line to the actual association. At present Mr. Mac Diarmid thinks that Russia probably provides the best opportunities for intimate contacts with the masses. A direct contact is, of course, often dis illusioning to the idealist, but only by direct contact can one learn to understand the masses. Mr. Eliot's failure to follow Mr. Mac Diarmid's suggestion is the cause of the fundamental falsity of many of the Sweeney poems, as well as of a large bulk of "The Waste Land". Mr. Mac Diarmid is not so much an idealist or wishful thinker that he holds the workers themselves blameless. He realizes, as did D. H. Lawrence, that the conditions of the workers are "due maistly to their ain mob cowardice"; that the workers are decided ly not inherently noble; that even with every opportunity for a full life they do not know how to grasp it; that they are not as equal to life as they are to the machines they tend; and that did they make a concerted effort they could achieve a change in a short time. In "Reflections in an Ironworks" it is almost as if D. H. Lawrence himself were speaking: Would you resembled the metal you work with, Would the iron entered into your souls, Would you became like steel on your own behalf! You are still only putty that tyranny rolls Between its fingers! You makers of bayonets and guns For your own destruction! No wonder that those Weapons you make turn on you and mangle and murder? You fools who equip your otherwise helpless foes! Mr. Mac Diarmid also echoes Lawrence in the lesson to be derived from this knowledge. We must not have our work as the end-all; rather, we should be constantly striving not only to dis cover the meaning of life, but to find ways of bringing greater significance to it. We must not expect too much from the masses until we free them from the necessity of submitting to a regimen for the sake of their daily bread. But we cannot expect too much</page><page sequence="9">HUGH Mac DIARMID 113 from the "haves", because those whose ancestors came by their wealth dishonestly "are aye str?ng on the law". Mr. Mac Diar mid understands their position, but regrets it. Were man free from the tradition which has not only enslaved him in the past, but enslaves him now, he could attain far greater heights than are at present possible. He could understand life as he cannot now do, because he would open the way for greater experiences, the source of a knowledge of life : Nae man can ken his hert until The tide o' life uncovers it, And horror-struck he sees a pit Returnin' life can never fill. Unfortunately, however, no evolution in self-knowledge has oc curred: the essential life of mankind in the mass is still the same as that of their earliest ancestors. In all other fields the world's ideas up to those of three hundred years ago have been discarded. Would man only realize that did the methods in mental advance approach those for material achievement the rewards might pos sibly be as great! But the poor public will swallow anything as long as it is sugar-coated! Self-knowledge and an understanding of the meaning of life are frequent themes in Mr. Mac Diarmid's poetry. We must learn our lessons from the stones which alone are immutable. After all: What happens to us Is irrelevant to the world's geology But what happens to the world's geology Is not irrelevant to us. In fact, self-knowledge can come only from an intimate contact with life and with death. "A man never faced wi' death," he says, "kens nocht of life."7 The prostitute enlists his sympathy as she has that of so many poets. To him as to them she is a symbol rather than a person. By serving Man, not merely a man, she has a greater place than a sweetheart, wife, or mother, because unlike them she cannot shut her life to Life. "0 Wha's Been Here Afore Me, Lass" presents another aspect of the same problem.8 Once man has reached the limits of self-knowledge he This^ tendency to view life and death as complementary probably derives from his reading of Rainer Maria Rilke. 8The poems in this genre bear a striking resemblance to many by Hardy. 8</page><page sequence="10">114 by JAMES G. SOUTHWORTH must have the courage to make his world on the basis of his dis covery in spite of the jeers of others. Only then can he hope to extend the process of self-knowledge to new limits. Although he does not treat love as a routine subject, Mr. Mac Diarmid does not neglect it. Many beautiful lyrics in the early volumes and occasional ones in the later volumes reveal tender ness, passion, and understanding. A mother's love which not only differs markedly from that of a father, but reveals an essen tial quality of woman, is the subject of "The Two Parents". A mother's love, even towards a child born out of wedlock, can bring more joy than sorrow. "The Robber", for example, tells the same story as told by Hardy in "The Dark-Eyed Gentleman". Ill Interesting, however, as is the subject matter of a poet, its im portance lies not only in the obvious control which it exercises on the music of the verse, but also in the subtlety it lends to certain aspects of that music. No poem has ever survived solely because of its intellectual content, whereas many poems of little or no intellectual content have achieved immortality. Some of Shakespeare's lyrics should quiet the sceptic. Let us look, there fore, at those aspects of Mr. Mac Diarmid's work which will de termine his position as a poet. I have already mentioned that Mr. Mac Diarmid writes both in Scots dialect and in English, the former predominating in the earlier volumes and the latter elsewhere. His Scots dialect is of no one locality as Burns' was that of Ayrshire; but he selects, according to Mr. John Buchan, "where he pleases between Aber deen and the Cheviots". This boldness has made many of the pieces difficult for the reader. Moreover, and this was to be ex pected of a man using a new weapon, he has often failed. No one likes to have constant recourse to a glossary; and even then, those he provides are incomplete. The general idea of the poem is clear enough, but an accurate perception of the poet's intention is impossible. The reader is left unsatisfied. I do not mean to give the impression that he always is. Were it so, there would be no meaning to the present essay. "The Watergaw", "The Bonnie Broukit Bairn", "Water Music", "Wheesht, Wheesht", the de</page><page sequence="11">HUGH Mac DIARMID 115 lightfully satiric "Crowdieknowe", and innumerable others are undoubted successes. Unlike Burns, Mr. Mac Diarmid can write in English with the same force, often with greater, than in Scots. "The Herd of Does", for example, has all the lyric intensity of any of the dialect poems. By tending to simplify his Scots diction in his later volumes I think Mr. Mac Diarmid will win a wider circle of readers than was before possible. A second characteristic that troubles the American reader is the frequent ornateness and heavy latinity of his diction. The Scots have always had a predilection for rhetoric, and no less a scholar than Professor Nichol Smith of Oxford, himself a Scots man, has remarked of the Scots' delight in using erudite words.9 As a matter of fact, it is frequently impossible to believe that Mr. Mac Diarmid can be serious. Instead of a preponderance of monosyllables, polysyllabic words abound. The objection to this practice is not on account of the length of the words, but on ac count of the faulty communication that results. Not only is the basic or traditional rhythm of Englich poetry disturbed, but these aureate words carry for us no emotional connotation derived from past associations; no more, in fact, than do the unfamiliar Scots words of literary origin. In "Vestigia Nulla Retrorsum (In Memoriam: Rainer Maria Rilke 1875-1926)" at least thirty-sev en strange words confront even an enlightened reader.10 What 8"To the present day the Scottish student dearly loves a well-rounded re sounding sentence... We are apt to forget the large place occupied by Latin in vernacular Scots. Latin was at one time as familiar to the educated Scot as his mother-tongue, and was his means of communication with foreigners. The Scot abroad made his way with Latin. The Scottish authors who were known abroad wrote in Latin. Scots Law, which is founded on Roman Law, has a larger Latin element than English Law. Latin words were bound to creep into the vernacular. More than that, Latin words have come into Eng lish from Scottish usage." Some Aspects of Eighteenth Century Poetry. 10The following are a few: Halophilous, cleistogamic, abreption, abderian, ac cidie, gynandromorphic, lectistern?um, immarcescible, and laevorotatory. One stanza will illustrate the difficulty: In shades of lastery and filemot and gridelin, Stammel and perse, our chesil and turbary lie Far from Scotland, that land of liripoops we left On these sterile stones, all else bereft, To watch the lacertine gleams, the lightning hummers, still. Nature with her excessive being no more could come Over us here, we thought, as prophecy over Paul; Lagophthalmic as God himself we yet descry Overwhelming nimiety in this minimum!</page><page sequence="12">116_by JAMES G. SOUTHWORTH happens is, of course, the complete loss of lyricism in such pas sages. "Ephyphatha", stressing the alliteration on *p' and T, is another instance in kind. Perhaps to the Scottish ear the presence of such words does not present a bar to the musical pattern; but to an American ear the result differs little from the effect produced by an ultra-modern musical conception in a totally unfamiliar idiom. "Stony Limits" is a striking example of Mr. Mac Diar mid's practice. Written as a memorial to Charles Doughty (1843-1927), a man whose ways were different from those of the poet, it has a nobility which is enhanced by the images as well as by the sheer music of the verse; but again the learned diction jars on the ear of the reader accustomed to the diction of tradi tional English poetry. I am, of course, not concerned with the possible reaction of future generations to Mr. Mac Diarmid's aureate and erudite vocabulary. Fortunately, these experiments, because I do not think they can be anything more, are confined chiefly to Stony Limits. They do not reappear in Second Hymn to Lenin and Other Poems. Mr. Mac Diarmid's figurative language transcends the merely picturesque. "Prayer for a Second Flood", a strongly satiric poem showing traces of what AE called "the sardonic rebel", con tains figures that are unusual, striking, and keyed to the tone of the poem. Of the numerous Noahs of today who speak with con fidence of the ways of the Lord, he says: Ding a' their trumpery show to bauds again. Their measure is the thimblefu' o' Esk in spate. Like whiskey the tittlin' craturs mete oot your poo'ers Aince a week for baubees in the kirk-door plate, ?And pit their umbrellas up when they come oot If mair than a pulpitfu' o' You's aboot! The imagery in "At My Father's Grave" is likewise arresting: The sunlict still on me, you rowM in clood, We look upon each ither noo like hills Across the valley. I'm nae mair your son. It is my mind, nae son o' yours, that looks And the great darkness o' your death comes up And equals it across the way. A livin' man upon a deid man thinks And ony sma'er thocht's impossible.</page><page sequence="13">HUGH Mac DIARMID 117 But in spite of his insistence on thought Mr. Mac Diarmid real izes that some of the greatest experiences lie beyond the poet's ability to crystallize them in language. The true poet speaks in "As Lovers Do": Here at the height of passion As lovers do I can only speak brokenly Of trifles too. Idiot incoherence I know full well Is the only language That with God can deal. But what he frequently fails to realize is that metrical dialectic is not poetry. He is so carried away by his convictions, so eager to raise the reader to his same pitch of intense emotion that he fails. Too often his verses communicate the sense of nervous energy without communicating the sense of passion. They have a matter-of-factness that disturbs the reader. One never doubts whether or not he has thought intensely about his matter; but one does doubt whether or not he has thought equally intensely about the dress of those thoughts. It seems to me that many poems are only prose broken up into a metrical pattern. It is possible, how ever, that he has not considered it worth his while to labor in polishing one thought when other thoughts were crowding his mind. But if that is true, I think he has seriously erred. Like Donne, he is interested in communicating the subtleties develop ing from his main idea rather than in making the main idea all powerful. No one can deny that Mr. Mac Diarmid is intellectu ally stimulating. He bludgeons the old orthodoxies with the club of a zealot and poses problems the solution of which demands of us our best. IV But I do not wish to leave the reader with the idea that he is incapable of genuine song. I have already mentioned several fine lyrics. Stately music and searching thought combine in "On a Raised Beach". The nightingale lyric in "Circumjack Cencras tus", "Dytiscus", and the "Ballad of Five Senses", to mention but a few, attain a high level of achievement. They are no less</page><page sequence="14">118 by JAMES G. SOUTHWORTH thoughtful than his other poems, but they present Mr. Mac Diar mid as a thinker and a poet. Several factors conspire to prevent Mr. Mac Diarmid from achieving popularity in America in the way that Messrs. Auden, Spender, McNeice, and Day Lewis have achieved it. His use of dialect is one; the hardness of his thought, his frequent matter of-factness, and his refusal to seek popularity are others. He is willing to await the response to his poetry. It would, however, be an injustice to Mr. Mac Diarmid, as well as to the other men, to attempt to weigh one against the other. What Mr. Spender has said of himself is true, I believe, of every sincere poet: "One does not try to be greater or better than other writers, one is trying to be as truthful as one can and we should be judged by the limits of that truth set against the greater truth of others." The clothing of Mr. Mac Diarmid's thoughts bears no resemb lance to that of the poets I have already mentioned?it is the difference between Harris tweed and West-of-England cloth. But the thoughts are frequently striking in their similarity. One thing is certain. To all classes with their increasing awareness to social problems and their revision of their views of life as science has pushed back the boundaries of the universe Mr. Mac Diarmid has much to say and he says it with force. One may cavil at individual poems, one may disagree violently with specific ideas; but when one lays aside the volumes of his work and thinks about his accomplishment one realizes he has been in the presence of a man of erudition steeped in the best thought of the past and the present if not always in the presence of a great poet; that he has been in the presence of a man who by sincerity of expression, by subtlety and keenness of intellect, and by indomitable energy has sought to fire his readers to an adequate perception of the universe, of our immediate world and its needs, and of their place therein.</page></plain_text>
