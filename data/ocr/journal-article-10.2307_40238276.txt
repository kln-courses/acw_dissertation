<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Hoot in thè Dark: The Evolution of General Rhetoric George A. Kennedy After spending much of my Professional life teaching rhetoric, I began to wonder what I was talking about. My initial assumption, one generally shared by classicists and students of speech communi- cation, though not by literary theorists, was that rhetoric emerged in Greece as an art of persuasion in public address; once it was formulated as a System of invention, arrangement, and style and widely taught as a useful skill under constitutional governments, it underwent a process of letteraturizzazione in which it affected, or if you prefer, infected, all forms of oral and written communication and molded audience expectations of communication. With chang- ing politicai conditions, rhetoric repeatedly became more associ- ated with matters of style than with argument, and in the sixteenth Century Petrus Ramus carried this to the extreme of limiting rheto- ric to style and delivery. Bernard Lamy and others in the seven- teenth and eighteenth Century then inverted the structure of rhe- torical teaching to begin with the nature of language as the core of rhetoric and to build around that a theory of literary genres, includ- ing but not limited to public address. From thèse sources, classical and early modern respectively, have developed two contrasting, though sometimes intersecting, modern views of rhetoric: the view of literary theorists that rhetoric is a quality of thè use of language and most perfectly seen in the metaphor, and a revived view of rhetoric as a phenomenon of public discourse in which cultural and politicai values find expression. The term rhetoric has clearly had différent meanings in différent historical cultures and thè phenomena that we cali "rhetoric" have been called différent things at différent times. I suppose rhetoric is not a "substance" in the logicai sense, though it does seem to me that there is something found in nature that either resembles rheto- ric or possibly constitutes the starting point from which it has cultur- ally evolved. If we could come to some Understanding of that starting point we might be able to define a "genus" of which the various historical meanings of rhetoric are "species," and if we Philosophy and Rhetoric, Vol. 25, No. 1, 1992.

KENNEDY could do that we might be on thè way to a more generai theory of rhetoric that could be useful in studying speech, language, litera- ture, art, religion, and other aspects of human society. Rhetoric is apparently présent in communication, though com- munication can be within thè personality of one individuai, as when one tries to "talk" the seif into some action or belief about which one has conflicting sentiments. But rhetoric probably should not be identified with communication, since there seem to be vari- ous degrees of rhetoric among communications: "zero grade" rhetoric may be approached but never quite achieved. "The win- dow is shut" is a communication. Its rhetorical quali ty is dépen- dent on its context. It might, for example, be a mild reassurance to a récipient concerned about rain blowing into a room, or an excla- mation of frustration by a thief who had planned to climb in. "Shut the window," even without knowing its context, seems inherently more rhetorically intense. The speaker is expressing an order or wish. The statement carries some authority to make the particular request. The recipienti responses are limited to executing the order, refusing to exécute the order and thus denying the authority of the speaker, or demanding some equality in negotiating the situation. The récipient might say "Shut it yourself." Or "Why? It's stuf f y in here." If the first speaker adds a reason, and thus créâtes an enthymeme ("Shut the window because the wind is blowing the papers off the desk"), the rhetorical energy is some- what reduced. Authority is less obvious, appeal to the judgment of the récipient is implied. There is récognition of the possibility for délibération. I would provisionally describe the rhetoric of these sentences as a matter of their energy level. It is easy to see that they might be expressed in différent degrees of shrillness or calm- ness of voice. Thus they also involve différent degrees of expendi- ture of physical energy in their utterance. Rhetoric in the most generai sense may perhaps be identified with the energy inhérent in communication: the emotional energy that impels the speaker to speak, the physical energy expended in the utterance, the energy level coded in the message, and the energy experienced by the récipient in decoding the message. In theory, one might even seek to identify some quantitative unit of rhetorical energy - cali it the "rheme" - analogous to an erg or volt, by which rhetorical energy could be measured. I leave that to the experimentalists. Tropes and figures of speech in literature are often described as</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 3 rhetorical de vices. When the text of the Gilgamesh says that the hero is a "goring wild bull," we note a metaphor, an assertion, and the présence of energy in the text. In metaphor, energy is ex- pended by the author in defamiliarizing the language and by the reader in mentally experiencing the présence of a force affecting the meaning. Whether or not there is an actual displacement of one term by another in the text of the ancient Mesopotamian epic is open to debate; the identification of human beings with animais is literally believed in some cultures. But Shakespeare presumably did not believe that music is, literally, "the food of love," only that it resembles food in that it nurtures passion. There is, however, energy in the poet's composition, energy in the actor's utterance of thè line, energy implied in the character as represented on stage, and energy experienced in thè minds of thè audience by the emo- tionally charged words. Even in figures of speech like anaphora there is an expression of energy. The Béatitudes, for example, hâve been worked or figured to begin with the repeated phrase "Blessed are. ..." Some energy has been expended in making a séries of assertions and arranging them into par aile ls, emotionally laden words are used, and émotion is experienced by the reader. A reader may then subject the assertions to reasoned analysis, even denying their validity. That requires mental effort and the expendi- ture of energy. Rhetorical assertion conveys energy and can spark reaction in another energy source. Rhetoric is least effective when either speaker or audience is tired, for the physical energy re- quired on both sides is lacking. Umberto Eco offered a theoretical account of rhetoric into which the more impressionistic description just given can be fit- ted.1 He speaks of rhetoric as the "labor" performed in order to overcode and to switch codes. Rhetoric is "overcoding" in that it is the activation within a message of a preexisting code of devices of invention, arrangement, and style, with their own rules, that makes up "a semiotics of conversational interaction" (278). "Over- coding" is perhaps an unfortunate term in that it may imply some- thing that is arbitrarily added, such as an ornament, to a semantic base - a common view of rhetoric. To me, it is the other way around: semantics is one vehicle of rhetoric. One of the goals of this paper is to try to identify some universal rules of the rhetorical code. It seems clear, however, that rhetorical energy is not found only</page><page sequence="4">4 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY in language. It is présent also in physical actions, facial expres- sions, gestures, and signs generally. The axiom that rhetoric is a form of energy leads to the first of several thèses about rhetoric: Thesis I. Rhetoric is prior to speech. By "prior" I mean that rhetoric, as energy, has to exist in the speaker before speech can take place. It is prior in biological évolu- tion and prior psychologically in any spécifie instance.2 Speech cannot take piace without some force or motivation to articulate an utterance. The originator of a communication has to expérience an exigence. But I also mean that rhetoric is prior to speech histori- cally and in biological évolution. Speech would not hâve evolved among human beings unless rhetoric already existed. In fact, rheto- ric is manifest in all animal life and existed long before the évolu- tion of human beings. Nature has favored the development of communication skills;3 although they have some energy cost, they are less costly than physical motion, such as flight or fight. Let me give a couple of easy examples of animal rhetoric in case what I am saying is not immediately clear. Imagine a pack of animais, such as lions or wolves, who constitute a small society. There will be some kind of hierarchy among them based on sex and âge. Among some species there may be one animal who is on watch. An intruder is noticed and a cry given indicating a possible enemy or possible prey. The other animais receive the message and react in an appropriate way. Energy has been transmitted by a sign. If another animal of the same species is approaching, the leader of the pack will expérience this as a threat to his position, perhaps an effort to replace him in his relationship to the females or to secure his food supply. What then takes place is rarely an immediate fight. There is a more or less extended period of at- tempts on each side to intimidate the other with growls, physical movements such as circling or pacing up and down, and other signs of intent. Michael Bright's description of encounters between maie red deer stags during the rutting season is an excellent example.4 Their encounter involves a great deal of expenditure of physical and emotional energy, and thè ability of a particular animal to keep it up forcefully and for an extended period of time is crucial to his success. The stag that can roar the loudest and longest wins. This strength is in fact a measure of his likelihood of success in actual fight if it does take place and is apparently so regarded by</page><page sequence="5">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 5 the stags. They rarely actually fight. One outroars the other and the latter leaves. This seems to me comparable to the rhetorical ultimata exchanged between hostile states and to constitute a kind of délibération in which évidence of thè power of each side is used to convince the other to give way. Within a group of animais, there can also be something like a judicial situation when two animais of lesser rank engage in a quarrel and an animal of senior rank "judges" it, often without physical intervention but by a roar of authority that means something like "Stop it!" Or the animai in authority may run off one of the participants, as it were imposing a judgmentof exile. There is also quite a lot of epideictic rhetoric among animais. By this I mean a kind of ritualized socializing that involves reassuring "contact calls" within the group. In the fall, I hâve witnessed con- vocations of ero ws on my university campus. To me, as an un- informed speetator interested in rhetoric, it looked as though they had gathered to debate some important issue. There was much cawing. Some of the crows seemed to become disgusted with the proeeedings and flew off; some turned their backs on the center of the group as if to vote "no." Brief research on the habits of the crow (corvus brachyrhynchus) revealed that they were probably not engaged in délibération on any of the three subjeets that most interest them (territorial control, mating, and feeding). There was no food supply at thè site of the conférence, it was not the mating season, and they had temporarily abandoned their territorial in- stincts to corne together. Our local crows do not migrate, and they usually live in pairs or small f amilies with distinct territories, but occasionally they assemble into large flocks. Zoologists have identi- fied among crows what is known as an "assembly cali," which consists of a succession of long raucous cries. This brings other crows together. Another kind of utterance is the "contact cali," which consists of a séries of short caws spaced into groups of two.5 This is probably a way of establishing a relationship to others in the flock. The assembly and the vocalization thus perform something like the reaffirmation of group identity in cérémonial oratory on public occasions. Birds are the most vocal of all animais and vocal rhetoric is more highly developed among them than in any species except human beings. It is perhaps not a coïncidence that the Greeks gave the name Corax, or "crow," to the "inventor" of rhetoric. For the last year or two I have been reading research on animal</page><page sequence="6">6 GEORGE A. KENNEDY communication, a subdivision of social biology, or thè more exotic field of zoo-semiotics, a subdivision of linguistics. I hâve yet to encounter the term "rhetoric" in social biology, though often that seems to me to be what is under discussion. Whether animais can be said to hâve languages is controversial, even among scientists, who sometimes stress the discontinuity of évolution6 or the dangers of anthropomorphizing animais,7 and more among those human- ists who react against any apparent threat to the uniqueness of human beings. Lorenz argues that both the reductionist and the uniqueness schools fail to understand "creative évolution."8 Lan- guage is an emotionally laden word and even if taken as a meta- phor, "animais hâve languages" has a relatively high degree of rhetorical energy. But there is no room for doubt that animais communicate among their own species and with other species; what is in doubt is the extent of their intentionality and conscious- ness of sending and receiving messages and the resulting question of whether some animais hâve a sensé of self and of mental indi- viduality. Darwin was inclined to think they do,9 with which Lorenz seems to agrée,10 others are very doubtful.11 Chomsky ar- gued that human language is not a higher stage of évolution of animal communication but a resuit of a spécifie type of mental organization lacking in animais.12 He does not mention rhetoric, but rhetoric seems to me exactly what animal and human communi- cation, as he describes them, hâve in common. Animais, whether for physical or mental reasons, do not naturally employ human language, though some birds can learn to do so for limited pur- poses, and conversely human beings are inept in employing most Systems of animal communication. We can, however, by observa- tion learn to understand animal rhetoric and many animais can understand some features of human rhetoric that they share with us, such as gestures or sounds that express anger or friendliness or commande. We share a "deep" universal rhetoric. Animais communicate by a complex code of signs. What seem to be undifferentiated chirps or grunts to a casual observer often turn out on spectrographic analysis of recordings to hâve clearly differ- entiated meanings and can indicate a particular class of predator or the imminence or distance of a perceived threat. The capacity to use and recognize a particular code of signs is innate in each spe- cies, including human beings, and thus genetically transmitted; among animais, some of the simplest signs are apparently also innate, and some animais, even some mammals, never advance</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 7 beyond this, but among others, for example primates, and espe- cially birds, many of the "words" or "phrases" in thè code are learned from others by experiments in imitation. If birds, at least of many species, are deafened or are brought up in isolation from others of their own kind, they do not learn to use their native "language." It is largely culturally transmitted and subject to sélec- tive variation. Groups of birds living apart from others of their species develop locai "dialects" and individuals introduce new vo- calizations by combining segments of song, rather like phonèmes, into new utterances, rather like sentences. Whether or not animais hâve a sensé of self, many clearly can recognize other individuals of their own species and some animais can apparently recognize what individuals belong to what family groups.13 Some animais can use or can learn to use symbols. Chimpanzees can be taught a rudimentary form of sign language. Although some would-be de- fenders of the superiority of the human species would say that the ability to lie and deceive is a unique human trait,14 they seem to overlook the fact that animais are perfectly adept at lying and deceiving, not only in hiding food or themselves under a bush, but even in using vocalization to deceive, as when a bird gives différent calls from différent places in its territory with the resuit that a potential intruder concludes that the area is occupied and flies away.15 What is the meaning of a particular communication by an ani- mal? Since conscious intent cannot be assumed in the case of most animal communication, the answer is that the "meaning" is the interprétation given to the communication by another animai. Vo- calized communication usually produces an instinctive reaction, such as flight, but response is contextual and thus interpreted.16 Occasionally an animal seems confused by a message, or may ig- nore it. Parents often ignore erroneous vocalizations by young off- spring. This implies a second thesis: Thesis II: The receiver's interprétation of a communication is prior to the speaker's intent in determining the meaning. More specifically, in nature the meaning is what the receiver does as a resuit of receiving the message, which should be some comfort to the pragmatist school of philosophers. If the receiver does nothing, the message has no meaning. The receiver's interpré- tation is "prior" in the sense that what the receiver is already</page><page sequence="8">8 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY conditioned to do on receipt of a certain message - the receiver's knowledge of the rhetorical code - détermines what the receiver does when the message arrives. This is consistent with those schools of modem literary interprétation that look to reader recep- tion rather than to authorial intent as determinative of meaning. It runs somewhat counter to the daim of Aristotle (Rhetoric 1.1.14) and his successore that the function of rhetoric is not persuasion but observing the available means of persuasion. A speech may not succeed, but in Aristotle's view may still be the best possible speech and demonstrate the speaker 's rhetorical skill. Of course a speech, though ineffective with an audience, may successfully ful- fill the speaker's need to speak - to put himself "on record" as it were; a bird that gives a cry indicating a predator fulfills a need to express that, even if the bird is mistaken or ignored by others. A speech that is not successful at the moment may affect future condi- tions indirectly. Aristotle's position is a resuit of a more reflective society that separates function from art and can judge both from some distance. It remains the case that audience reception is a more primitive and a more basic criterion of meaning than is autho- rial intent. A good indication of this is that in nature a single vocalization can perform two différent functions for two différent audiences at the same time. The song of a maie bird is thought, at one and the same time, both to inform other male birds that a territory is occupied (thus to warn them off) and to inform a female of the male's readiness to mate (and arouse her mating instincts).17 This should raise problems for speech act theorists, who apparently unanimously assume that intentionality is essential in illocutionary speech acts, such as giving a warning.18 But even in the case of human communication, an utterance can carry a warn- ing without being intended by the utterer. I can interpret as a warning the chance remark of another that my bête noire John is coming to a party, though the speaker may hâve been expressing pleasure at the thought. Rhetoric allows, in Eco's terminology, a "switch" in thè code, in this case a reversai of the message. In human society, rhetoric is, however, usually given some direc- tion and form by varying degrees of intentionality on the part of a speaker, some conscious, some not fully conscious. Intentional rhetoric invokes a network of beliefs and beliefs about beliefs, both about one's own and those of others, for example, the belief that the audience addressed believes that action should be based on reason. In animal communication at the lowest levels, there is</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 9 what Dennett19 calls "zero order" intentionality on thè part of thè organism, which gives off a sign, such as a change in coloration or shape, in response to a stimulus without making a conscious déci- sion. But there is évidence that some species of higher animais have "first order" intentionality in that they are capable of choos- ing whether or not to respond to an exigence depending on their personal situation. A response, for example, might attract thè at- tention of a predator or conversely might attract help from others of its own species. There is also some évidence that primates may have a "second order" of intentionality that involves a conception of their own and another animal's beliefs. A vervet monkey, for example, may give a léopard alarm not only because it believes that a léopard is nearby but because it wants others to believe it, too.20 At least some scientists believe that chimpanzees understand each other's goals and motives.21 At what stage in thè évolution of intentionality among species does rhetoric appear? I am inclined to say that thè ability to give a sign, even without intent or belief, is basic to rhetoric, and thus I advance a third thesis: Thesis III: Rhetoric is prior to intentionality or to any belief on thè part of a speaker about thè meaning of a sign or its effect on others. There are a number of features of animal communication that resemble features of rhetoric as it has been formulated in Western society. We are not, of course, descended from any surviving spe- cies of animais, but we do have an ultimate common origin. Rhe- torical characteristics of animal communication are analogies to what has developed in différent species, indications of some possi- ble parameters of rhetoric, of what nature has favored in particular environments, and perhaps of some of its basic features of commu- nication. They deserve comparative study in an attempt to under- stand rhetoric and thè forms it takes. I do not deny that human évolution is complex and that human capabilities far exceed what can be seen among animais. Merlin Donald has recently advanced a cognitive theory of human évolution that both préserves thè link with animal communication and differentiates it from thè human condition. He argues that thè cognitive culture of social animais is "episodic": "Their lives are lived entirely in thè présent, as a séries of concrete épisodes, and thè highest élément in their System of memory représentation seems to be at thè level of event representa-</page><page sequence="10">10 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY tion."22 Later stages of évolution of thè brain and culture are first "mimetic," then "mythic," then "theoretic." But thèse represent new layers of the mind, not the substitution of a later stage for an earlier one. Episodic culture, and thus its rhetoric, continues to exist among human beings. Actually there is even a kind of rhetoric among plants. Though clearly lacking in conscious intent, it is essential for the survival of the species. The term colors of rhetoric was frequently used in the past to describe figures of speech. The colors of flowers attract insects and birds and facilitate pollination. Plants also use odors to attract or repel animais. Coloration and scent are each a kind of rhetoric and the création and perception of each involves the use of energy. This is purposive in nature, though not purposeful. Taking living things as a whole, I state two more thèses: Thesis IV: The function of rhetoric is the survival of the fittesi. Thesis V: The rhetorical code evolves by sélective variation. Rhetoric acts as a mechanism for survival by facilitating success- ful adaptation of an organism to environmental change. Genetic mutation benefits the species by providing increased options for adaptation, but does little or nothing for thè progenitive organism; within animal cultures, however, including human culture, rhetoric is a powerful force for the survival and well-being of thè individuai, the family, and the social group as thèse exist at any given mo- ment. It secures or benefits the human individuai every day in courts of law and thè individuai nonhuman animal in the jungle. Among the latter, it facilitâtes securing territory, thus a food sup- ply to provide energy, and a mate, thus survival of its genes, and as we hâve seen it protects thè individuai or the group from hostile intrudere or predators. It has secured and benefited culture gener- ally, as well as smaller units within cultures, throughout the history of the évolution of social animais and human society. Stripped to its bare minimum, rhetoric is a défense mechanism (although a good offense is often the best défense). The acquisition of thè ability to move themselves and the évolu- tion of sexual reproduction were early stages in individuation of living créatures. The faculty of rhetoric, more than anything else in nature, is probably responsible for thè development of individuai Personality, and thus in the highest forms of animal life, of a sensé of selfhood. The basic reason for this is that rhetoric is expressive</page><page sequence="11">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 1 1 of thè integrity of thè individuai, thus in higher animais the émo- tions, and thus distinctive personality, and among animais of the same species there often are strong individuai personalities. Even if animais are to a large extent behaviorally conditioned, each is a unique entity with some unique features, however small. AU ani- mais manifest anger; many manifest love, at least mothers for their off spring; some show signs of loneliness and dépression; and biolo- gists frequently describe some animais as demonstrating "altru- ism," meaning a concern for others expressed through protecting them at their own risk, grooming them, or assisting them in gaining food.23 Variation among individuai animais produces more or less successful rhetorical skills. Nature sélects for survival those indi- viduals whose skills are most adaptive to their environment. Sélec- tive variation in rhetoric probably orìginates in small "mistakes" in using either a nonhuman or human code, in novel combinations of its conventional éléments, or chance expérimentation or play that proves more effective than what has traditionally been done and is imitated. At some point in history, some human being hit upon the novelty of giving a reason for a command, and kept on doing it when a rational audience responded well. Among higher animais, rhetorical skills are transmitted culturally by imitation and learn- ing, not genetically. Some caution is needed in Statements about the relationship of émotion to rhetorical expression in nature. Bird lovers and roman- ticists often believe that birds sing for joy (as in Shelley's "To a Skylark" or Keat's "Ode to a Nightingale") or in sadness (the myth of the "swan song" persists). There is no scientific évidence that bird song is expressive of joy or sorrow, though it can ex- press a biological mating instinct and stimulate the physical ability to mate in females. Most singing birds are males, and after mat- ing they often reduce their song. AH bird song and ali bird calls are thought to be strictly functional, related primarily to territori- ality, location of a food supply, défense against predators, mat- ing, or cohésion between mates, families, or flocks. A com- plicated song, analogous to the rhetorical display of the stags mentioned earlier, communicates the energy, maturity, and fit- ness of a male for mating purposes. Mammals, however, do ex- press pleasure, either by body language as in the wagging of dogs' tails, or in sound, as in the purring of cats and some other ani- mais. Some animais have a sense of humor. Man is not the only animai that laughs: some monkeys make the facial gestures and</page><page sequence="12">12 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY sounds of laughter. In a still-authoritative work, Darwin traced a continuum between facial gesture in animais and in human beings and showed how facial gestures are derived from functional mus- cular actions: for example, thè snarl of a dog or a man from thè instinct to bite.24 But human gestures involving coordinated use of other parts of thè body are cultural symbols and vary widely.25 The young of birds and mammals engage in play, and some animais carry this on throughout life. Play among animais is impor- tant in developing their muscles, in practicing thè skills of catching prey, and in learning thè communication code and rhetoric of thè species. Play is physically and socially educational for animais26 and for human beings, as reflected in thè Greeks' basic division of éducation into gymnastics and music. Play is very important in thè development of both rhetoric and literature. Traditional éducation has practiced students in mock Speeches, such as thè deliberative and judicial déclamations of thè classical rhetorical schools, re- sumed in thè Renaissance. The Student learns thè rhetorical code, stratégies of attack and défense, arrangement of material, skills at amplification and ornamentation, and thè conventional values of thè society. Young animais learn comparable things useful in their societies. Since play is in large part action, this brings me to another thesis: Thesis VI: Among thè traditional parts of rhetoric (invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery), delivery is prior to thè others. "Delivery" in traditional rhetoric includes facial expression, ges- ture, and tonal inflection. In Latin, thè term actio was often used instead, and it is action, not subtleties of vocalization, to which I refer hère. Physical motion in response to some exigence occurs in thè earliest and most primitive forms of life, as when an amoeba moves toward a food supply or away from some noxious stimulus. A kind of proto-rhetoric can be said to exist in those créatures that can react to a challenge by change of color or shape or by spewing out some substance as does an octopus. Some action produces sound, which other créatures can perceive although the originator of the sound may not. Many insects create sound instrumentally, by sawing a part of the anatomy on another. A rattlesnake's rheto- ric consists of coiling or uncoiling itself, threatening to strike, and rattling its tail, which other créatures hear, even though a rattle-</page><page sequence="13">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 13 snake is itself deaf . There is an evolutionary chain from the most primitive defensive or offensive actions to the complex System of rhetorical delivery described in John Bulwer's Chirologia and Chironomia in the eighteenth Century. The dance of bees in the hive shows how complex Systems of gesture can be. Dance is also one of the earliest forms of expression and communication devel- oped among human beings. This leads to another thesis: Thesis VII: Writing is prior to speech but not prior to rhetoric. Writing, or "Grammatology" as described by Derrida,27 is prior to speech in that a kind of marking is prior in evolutionary develop- ment and a necessary condition for all communication, although oral communication existed in human societies before the inven- tion of historical writing Systems. These Systems represent a con- ceptualization and organization of written Symbols to represent utterances, but they were preceded by picturing, which goes far back to cave painting in Cro-Magnon times and which directly représente action, not speech about action. Writing or marking, however, is much earlier and more primitive than even that. It survives in many animais today who "mark" their territory with urine or bodily scent, as well as in animais that have little or no ability to generate sounds but do so by their movements. Vocaliza- tion is, in fact, a form of marking, in that to communicate, it must distinguish sounds by moments of silence, often producing rhythm, or by changes of pitch or volume. As in the telegraph, a very simple pattern is one of spacing of long or short units. But marking does not seem to be prior to rhetoric among living créatures in that the impulse and the expenditure of energy required in marking necessarily must exist before the marking, or "writing," can take place. Both are mechanisms for survival, and the most primitive form of marking is a vehicle for rhetoric. Marking is, perhaps, a kind of metaphor, that is, something transferred to the condition of life from thè inanimate world where there is also a kind of marking. The entity of any body of matter is based on a binary distinction between what is and what is not; this is what limits its mass. In speaking of rhetoric, I have defined it as an energy exist- ing in life. But energy exists apart from living organisms and the energy of the life force, and thus rhetoric is perhaps a special case of the energy of ail physics as known from subatomic particles. Since matter can be converted into energy and energy into matter,</page><page sequence="14">14 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY and since in thè origin of thè universe we do not know which existed first, I leave open the question of thè ultimate sources of thè qualities of being that made possible the évolution of both rhetoric and marking. They may be two aspects of the same thing. Returning to our world of animal life, let me identify some features of invention, arrangement, and style that can be illus- trateci from nonhuman rhetoric for purposes of comparison with human rhetoric. These may constitute the fundamental rules of the universal rhetorical code. Of the other two parts of traditional rhetoric, delivery has been briefly discussed and I bracket mem- ory, the fourth traditional part, as a subject of less interest to modem rhetoricians, important as it may be, and as too complex for discussion hère, except to note that it is an aid to survival and requires some kind of marking System in the mind. (In traditional rhetoric, the art of memory is based on the substitution of a sé- quence of visual images for sound patterns "written" in the mind.) Since memory exists in créatures that do not hâve speech, like ail parts of rhetoric it is clearly prior to speech. Using the traditional parts of rhetoric as a basis for discussion may be objected to by some as analogous to ethnocentrism in anthropology, the imposi- tion of a later, and Western, structural scheme on phenomena that in their naturai state might be related in différent ways. My re- sponse to this criticism is to agrée that the catégories of traditional rhetoric may not be a satisfactory basis to describe animal commu- nication and I do not use them for that purpose. What I am looking for are features of animal communication that resemble catégories of traditional rhetoric and that therefore suggest that thèse catégo- ries, though conditioned by cultural conventions, represent the survival of certain naturai phenomena. Thesis VIII: Rhetorical invention, arrangement, style, memory, and delivery are phenomena of nature and prior to speech. It does not seem possible for speech to hâve developed without the prior existence of the faculties represented in the traditional parts of rhetoric. The need for memory and delivery has already been noted. Equally needed would hâve been something to say, some order in the saying, and some manner of saying it. Ail thèse faculties exist in varying degrees among animais and thus they are likely to hâve existed in some form in the direct ancestors of man.</page><page sequence="15">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 15 "Invention" in rhetoric corresponds in a generai way to "informa- tion" in animal communication. Two kinds of information are con- veyed by animal sounds:28 the présence of an animal in a territory and thè internai state of the animal making the sound. "Présence" includes individuation, thè individuai personality of thè animai in so far as this has developed in the species and can be perceived by another animal. "The internai state" includes the animal's physical and emotional reaction to thè immediate environment and the message about it that may be of use to another animal. As inter- preted by a receiver and recast in anthropomorphic terms, the information conveys something like "Blackie, a known and usually reliable member of our Community, is warning that he has ob- served a stranger who may constitute a danger to any of us." I would describe this as deliberative rhetoric in that in a particular social context it implies advice about future action - be wary, or flee - and the receiver needs to make a judgment. I would also suggest that éléments of ethos, pathos, and logos are inhérent in it. The originator of the communication, whether consciously or not, has given a sign of his credibility and good will (ethos), has ex- pressed with more or less emphasis his alarm and produced a message that can awaken alarm in his audience (pathos), and has indicated why he feels alarm by giving thè cali that denotes a predator (logos). It should be noted that the translation of the message into human language requires the Statement of proposi- tions; the message has semantic content. Propositions are, I be- lieve, implicit in animal communication, though no student of se- mantics to the best of my knowledge has ever entertained the possibility. The ethos is likely to reflect hierarchy or "pecking order" in the society; in many groups, especially of mammals, certain members have greater authority than others. It could, per- haps, be argued that hierarchy among animais represents an incipi- ent distinction between office and individuai office holder, a dis- tinction often made in politicai rhetoric in historical times when a speaker stresses respect for an office, such as the presidency of the United States, and a belief that the incumbent is unworthy of it. This distinction is found in human tribal societies as well.29 Among animais, the position of authority exists and is respected, but the incumbent is regularly challenged by the younger and stronger. "Debate" exists in the animal world, as in the meeting of rutting stags described above. The issue there is largely one of hierarchy</page><page sequence="16">16 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY and what is "proved" is the superior stamina and thus superior rights of one animal in comparison with another for a particular position. As in human délibération, an animal communication may turn out to be an overreaction, an underreaction, or reflect the judg- ment of a mature and experienced observer. As an animal learns the rhetorical code of its species, there is a kind of "oscillation" between overstatement (hyperbole) and Understatement (meio- sis).30 Gradually the maturing animal develops a "pattern" of ob- servation against which a particular event can be tested and evalu- ated. Lorenz (113-20) regarded this as an ability of abstracting thè generai from the particular and saw in évolution the integra- tion of a number of separate cognitive functions, many existing in rudimentary form in nonhuman animais. These include a faculty of abstract thought (which produces language), an ability to accu- mulate supra-individual knowledge, thè power to foresee consé- quences of an action (which produces moral responsibility), the ability to make voluntary movements, and imitation (which Lorenz regarded as the basis of learning verbal language and thus of the faculty of passing on objective knowledge independently of the présence of thè object). To abstract the generai from the particu- lar is a rudimentary form of induction; once a pattern has been established in the mind, to apply it to a particular situation is déduction. Overstatement in oscillation seems to perform a rhetorical func- tion beyond its role in the learning process. It gets the attention of an audience and, helped by features of style and delivery, stands out against the "noise" of the environment. In the jungle, in the seas, and in human assemblies, background noise is an obstacle to communication. Noise is also overcome by redundancy in the mes- sage. The primary cognitive device of animal rhetoric is répétition of the same Statement several times in the same form.31 This re- mains a feature of human rhetoric ("Teil them what you are going to say, then say it, then teil them what you have said"), though with a sophisticated audience it is often best to convey the same message in différent words, whereas in animal rhetoric, with its limited vocabulary, this is impossible or would be confusing. "Am- plification," however, is manifested in some animai rhetoric, and perforais some cognitive function, but, as in traditional rhetoric, it is more a device of style than invention and can be left for discus- sion below.</page><page sequence="17">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 17 The history of the évolution of rhetorical invention is the history of the diffusion of energy and the growth of information in commu- nication. In a primordial cry of "Help!" there is the greatest energy and the least information. Animal communication requires less energy than does physical confrontation and conveys more useful information, including some quite spécifie information useful for survival, which is probably why it has been favored in évolution. Human rhetoric, with its conceptualization of rational argument, its ability to give a narrative picture of previous or possible future events, and its great creativity, conveys the greatest amount of information, but reduces the emotional energy.32 A number of features of "arrangement" are to be found in the rhetorical codes of the animal world. Bird songs hâve a syntax in their arrangement of phoneme-like sound segments; differently arranged they convey différent messages. The most highly devel- oped forms of bird songs have something like an exordium, which announces the bird's présence and calls attention to its message, then a main body of song, divided into segments, often with re- peated éléments, and a terminal flourish or épilogue.33 From my reading overall, however, I conclude that whereas the présence of an exordium is not uncommon both among birds and mammals, the présence of an épilogue is unusual and when it exists it is a simple flourish, not a recapitulation of the message in brief. This resembles some non- Western music that often has some initial introduetory passage to strike up the tune, but ends abruptly with- out a coda. The artistic need for an épilogue is characteristic of Western speech, Western literature, and Western music, carried to its füllest formal development in traditional perorations and in the concluding sections of thè sonata form. Western society has sought closure. Arrangement is crucial in the process of ritualization, a common feature of primitive societies and a continuing vehicle of religious cohésion, thus an epideictic rather than deliberative use of rheto- ric. The right utterances have to be said in thè right order, or the ceremony is often invalid. Ritualization is a feature of animal com- munication also. Its simpler form can be seen in the mating dis- plays of some birds. One of its most elaborate forms is the speetacu- lar morning duet of mated pileated gibbons. The female gives a soft "hoo-hoo-hoo" as an exordium. The male and female then join in a rhythmic "ooh-a-ooh-a-ooh-a." "Eventually, the female utters some short 'hoos' that teil the male to be quiet; this is the</page><page sequence="18">18 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY signal that she wants to sing the long séries of whoops of the spectacular 'great cali' - a kind of south-east Asian yodel. At the climax, male and iemale swing around in the tops of the trees, making a considérable commotion - it is a period of intense excite- ment."34 Since the performance is very loud, it is thought to func- tion to défend territory, but it is also important in the cohésion of the pair, who mate for life and achieve increased coordination in thè ritual over time. In some species of birds, thè male sings and the female repeats his song. Ritualization, dialogue, and antipho- nal singing among animais is perhaps analogous to the early stages of poetry, drama, and literature among human beings and may point to some of its rhetorical functions which include territorial interests (strong in the Iliad, for example) and family integrity (strong in the Odyssey, for example). This mention of the possible "literary" quality of communication among animais leads me to a short digression on textuality among animais, relevant to later rhetoric in that it may hâve something to do with the development of aesthetic sensibilities. There is almost no scientific évidence that nonhuman animais hâve any perception of beauty; what they seem to hâve instead is a sensé of fitness. A bird builds a nest to fit an innate mental pattern of what constitutes a nest. This is primarily a matter of the arrangement of the mate- rial, which is woven together in a structure conventional to the species. I recently observed cardinals building a nest. The maie brought twigs of various lengths, which the female worked into the fabric. Sometimes she rejected a particular piece and even seemed to be trying to explain to her mate what she needed, which he learned by experiment. Sometimes birds will abandon a particular nest half-built, usually because the location is unsuitable or danger- ous, sometimes perhaps because they hâve made a mistake in laying thè foundations. Some birds seem to build a séries of nests without intending to use them, possibly as decoys to the final, more hidden nest. In any event, thè nest must fulfill the animal's sensé of what constitutes a proper nest in the proper place. "Propri- ety" is an important quality in traditional rhetoric. The behavior of birds also seems to me to indicate an incipient aesthetic sensé. The Greek word kosmos means "order," or what is set in order. It came to mean the seemingly orderly arrangement of the stars in the heavens, but also Ornament and jewelry, thus something that is beautiful. When I said that there is "almost no scientific évidence that nonhuman animais hâve any perception of beauty," the excep-</page><page sequence="19">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 19 tion I had in mind was the degree to which some birds - magpies, for example - are attracted by bright-colored objects, which they sometimes build into a nest. This may suggest an inclination to ornamentation in nature, présent also in bird song, though most artifacts created by nonhuman animais are entirely functional. When traps were set to reduce the beaver population in my town, the beavers responded by building the traps into their dams, thus strengthening them. This is what is called in French bricolage, a subject much developed in the writings of the anthropologist Claude Lévi-Straus. It is some what analogous to catachresis in rhetoric, thè use of a metaphor when there is no proper word available. Modern discussions of metaphor suffer from their fail- ure to consider comparative évidence of how metaphor may have evolved, both in terms of function and in terms of ornamentation. This has already led us into discussion of style. Most of the important features of style in nature have already been men- tioned: individuai birds, at least of some species, have recogniz- able individuai styles within rather limited parameters. Each spe- cies has its own style. Especially in singing to attract mates, birds amplify their song; this helps the message to stand out against background noise, but also conveys the strength, maturity, and suitability of the bird as a mate. Something similar exists among mammals, though in less intricate fashion. Some birds - mocking birds, for example - imitate the song of other birds, thus amplify- ing and ornamenting their song by intertextual allusion. The com- monest figure of speech among animais is probably anaphora: beginning a séries of phrases with the same sounds. But homoeo- teleuton occurs, too, when successive segments end with the same pattern. Animal communication is usually rhythmical: the metri- cal pattern is a key to the meaning. An inclination to hyperbole exists among animais; they overreact as do human speakers. Vo- cal signs made by animais are arbitrary Symbols of mental percep- tions, as are the words in human languages. There is often a kind of synecdoche in that the symbol représente a class of objects rather than a particular one: a large bird rather than specifically an eagle. Proportional metaphor based on similarity of appear- ance or function does not seem présent in animal vocalizations, though catechresis occurs in animal behavior, as mentioned ear- lier. Though I have not noted thè use of metonymy in vocal communication among animais, some animais easily understand metonymy: though none of my dogs has ever brought me his</page><page sequence="20">20 GEORGE Α. KENNEDY leash to suggest going on a walk, when I take the leash in hand, they become excited and know exactly what it signifies. This brief discussion is intended to direct attention to animal communication as a way of understanding some basic features of rhetoric that might be restated as generai rules. I must emphasize again that what is seen among animais is only analogous to features of human rhetoric, not its direct sources. These are behaviors that hâve been developed in separate species in accord with their bio- logical characteristics. The potentialities in each species are limited by physical characteristics, including brain size and structure and the nature of the organs of vocalization. There do, however, ap- pear to be some features of communication in common among many species, including human beings, apparently favored by natu- rai sélection in évolution from the earliest forms of life. These various features are vehicles, techniques, or rules of rhetoric, which itself is a form of energy driven by a basic instinct to survive. Research on the forms of rhetoric in nature can be a first step toward a theory of generai rhetoric and a comprehensive history of its development. The study of rhetoric is essentially distinct from the study of speech or language, which rhetoric has however ex- ploited. A second logicai step is further research in rhetoric as it can be seen in tribal societies living in primitive conditions and studied by anthropologists (with the warning, however, that even the most primitive society of modem times is the resuit of thou- sands of years of cultural évolution), and of the earliest stages of historical societies in urban culture. Diachronie research, including observation of discontinuities, is a needed complément to the synchronie research on communication and rhetoric which today dominâtes the field.35 Department of Classics The University ofNorth Carolina Notes 1.

"Prior" in this discussion should generally be taken to mean prior in biological évolution and a necessary condition for whatever is "posterior." I shall, however, explain the usage of the term as applied in some contexts below. The complex question of why and how speech developed among human beings is not a necessary part of the argument of this paper.</page><page sequence="21">EVOLUTION OF GENERAL RHETORIC 21 3.
