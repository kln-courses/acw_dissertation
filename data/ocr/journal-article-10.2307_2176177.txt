Zophar the Naamathite's question, "Canst thou by searching find out God ?" has always divided the defenders of faith into two groups. Those who answer ' yes' obtain a rational basis for religion by special rigor in philosophizing; the others deny the ability of philosophy to make any positive contribution to faith, and insist that religion has an utterly independent source. To the latter group belongs Charles Renouvier, who for half a century has contended for the kind of critical philosophy that makes room for faith by removing knowledge. In his article, " The Idea of God," which opens the new volume of the Annie jhilosophique, two dominant thoughts emerge: first, that the idea of God, properly so called, includes intelligence and will anthro- pomorphically conceived; and second, that the various first princi- ples, substantial and causal, with which the great metaphysical sys- tems have sought to displace this simple and sincere anthropomorphism, are primarily abstracted from personality itself, and end by being simply hypostasized abstractions (ides reclisees). His estimate of</page><page sequence="2">636 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VII. modern thought is not inspiring. He is apparently convinced that the evolution of the idea of God in the modern world is " a progres- sive revelation of the atheism latent in the philosophies of the abso- lute," and that the march of the popular mind, under the influence of philosophy, is "simply and solely the progress of atheism." Coming at a time when the materialism of the fifties has just definitively disap- peared, when the negative dogmatism of positivism has exhausted itself, when the theory of evolution, with its sense of the unity of na- ture, has reinstated and ennobled the hypothesis of design, and when theory of knowledge is rediscovering that a supreme intelligence is an implication of all our knowledge-coming at such a time, this charge of atheism must be pronounced inappropriate. Can it be that M. Renouvier has mistaken the rejection of his mode of apologetics for an abandonment of faith itself? Though we think better of our age than does M. Renouvier, we must, nevertheless, admit that his critical rapier has pierced the most vulnerable parts of metaphysical ideas of God, and, indeed, of most thinking that seeks to be fundamental. The world that we desire to understand is a concrete manifold of experience, but the thought by means of which we construe it is always in danger of becoming ab- stract. The price of simplicity is that we leave out of account some of the features of our data, yet to do so is to render our thought in- adequate to explain the world or even to describe it without distor- tion. This, stated broadly, is the joint of the metaphysical harness at which Renouvier aims his attack. As Hesiod abstracted love from life, and, personifying it, made it a cosmical principle, so Empedocles, without personifying, abstracted love and hate, Anaxagoras the nous, Plato his ideas, and Aristotle his substantial forms (cf. vo'uffess vo hiTswc). This series of abstractions culminated in the doctrine of emanation, whose supreme being, above all predicates, was nothing more than the concept of emanation itself hypostasized. Christianity was saved from an abstract conception of God, which threatened it in the scho- lastic theology, by its doctrine of the God-Man. Modern philoso- phy, in fact, is dominated in its first period by the Thomistic notion of an abstractly absolute God, while in its second period it tends to revert even to emanationism. Spinoza, of course, represents the former period, but Renouvier points out that Descartes's definition of God as the most perfect being, and of perfection as-not a quality of being, but-being itself, put the God of Cartesianism as far from the world as the God of Spinozism. Leibnitz continues the tradition by making God the only true agent, and by placing his existence in an ziter-</page><page sequence="3">No. 6.] REVJEWS OF BOOKS. 637 nitas iota simul. From Kant onward appears a tendency curiously parallel to Neo-Platonism. Thus, in his transcendent x, Kant log- ically admitted the supreme hypostatis of emanationism, and in the Ideal of Pure Reason reached the second hypostasis. With Fichte, the emanation becomes distinctly threefold and thoroughly abstract-the development of a concept. Schelling is best characterized by the in- troduction into philosophy of the idea of evolution in place of that of God. In Hegel's system, which " starts from the one and returns to it after traversing all the stages of the idea (Logos)," the parallel be- comes still more striking. Finally, Spencer offers as supreme prin- ciple an unknowable absolute, and as second principle universal force, with a passage from the former to the latter-and, it might be added, back again-which can be described in the most vague term 'ema- nation,' as well as in any other. Some excess of zeal may, perhaps, be discovered in the strictures just outlined. To pronounce Hegel's doctrine of development infirm in comparison with the ancient emanationism, for example, or to brand Fichte's thesis, antithesis, and synthesis as rubbish (viei//eries), seems to reveal a failure to put oneself into the kind of sympathy with an author's point of view, and even with his limitations, that is essential to historic appreciation. Only as religious philosophy assimilates the great systems of thought, can it hope to produce a better type or even to escape infection from bad metaphysics. From Renouvier's discus- sion, we may, nevertheless, deduce two warnings that are always timely. The first is that we should beware of adopting a supreme principle that lacks independent content. The fundamental proposi- tion of philosophy or of science, however reached, whether by induc- tion, by analysis of the conditions of valid thought, or otherwise, must have ascertainable meaning. It must not be a mere word, or the mere form of a possible thought, but an index of something capable of being pointed out in our experience. Now, being, substance, force, will, and intelligence, when they have any articulate meaning, refer to something in experience that is not mere unqualified being, or mere force, etc. Any one of them, taken simply and formally, is only an aspect of a whole which alone is concrete. It follows that if we are unwilling to make them mere abstractions, we must carry up into them in their highest applications the connotation they bear when applied to the concrete facts of experience. Failing to do this, though we ascend with ease to our supreme prin- ciple, we never quite succeed in explaining any concrete fact by means of it, but are obliged either to ignore the very facts we desire to ex-</page><page sequence="4">638 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW. [VOL. VII. plain, or to adopt some such shift as emanation, or a dialectical evo- lution driven by inherent contradiction, or the instability of the homogeneous. There belongs to philosophy an 680o xdvCo as well as an 6JLos avw, yet how rarely has the one duly supplemented the other. We exercise great care in rising to our highest principle, but, once ar- rived, we straightway indulge the fancy that differences can be drawn out of a homogeneous, and a manifold out of a mere unit. A multi- tude of examples might be given to illustrate this point. A single one must suffice-the cosmic will, which just now seems to be a popular ex- pression of the ultimate reality. To reduce everything to will is cer- tainly easy enough; matter is a manifestation of force, and force equals will; thinking is acting, and similarly all mental phenomena are manifestations of mental energy or the will to live. So, then, will is the supreme fact in all facts. But let us now try to retrace our steps. How could mere will differentiate itself into, say, intellect, or acquire the specific directions it takes in our willing ? Again, what is mere will if not an abstraction from nature and mind rather than their principle or their explanation? To round out Renouvier's criticism of the metaphysical systems, it would have been needful to show whence and how each one derived its first principle. Instead of this, we receive the bare hint that per- sonality, or intelligence and will as we know them in ourselves, is the basal fact upon which all have built. Again, after the ill consequences of abandoning the anthropomorphic standpoint have been exhibited, we expect to have it shown, from the constitution of knowledge or otherwise, how far anthropomorphism is necessary and allowable. In- stead of this, Renouvier proceeds to delimit the respective spheres of knowledge and faith. Assuming that knowledge is of relative exist- ence only, and therefore incapable of apprehending any but an an- thropomorphic God, he assigns to it only a negative function with re- spect to faith-it may prune faith's pretensions when these contradict experience or the recognized principles of knowledge, but the entire positive content of faith is derived from the ideal of a moral order. Plainly, this kind of return to Kant ignores the fruit of a whole cen- tury of reflection. Reflection may still halt at Kant's negative com- mands, or it may go on to develop a positive metaphysics out of his principles; but the (at least apparent) dualism of the two Critiques certainly cannot abide. Besides, both the psychology and the episte- mology of our day teach that the active and the reflective sides of our nature are at every point inseparable. Religion cannot escape think- ing, and the thought-sphere is one.</page><page sequence="5">No. 6.] REVIEWS OF BOOKS. 639 What, then, is Renouvier's own positive notion of God? That of a personal being who lives in time, whose knowledge, like our own, is relative, and to whom the world, the creation of his own will, is an object of external representation and experience. He complains of Kant for not having so much as considered this possible hypothesis. Truly, this is not the God of the metaphysician; is it even the God of any highly developed religion? The Ann'ee philosophique fulfills a double function: it publishes annually an article by each of its three contributors, MM. Renouvier, Dauriac, and Pillon, and presents a bibliographical review of philo- sophical books published in French during the year. In the present number, M. Dauriac, in an essay on 'The Philosophy of M. Paul Janet,' sets forth the points of friendly and of unfriendly contact between the form of spiritualism represented by Janet and the neo- criticism represented by the Annie. M. Pillon continues his treatise, begun in i893, on " The Evolution of Idealism in the Eighteenth Cen- tury." The book-reviews are generally brief, and devoted more to exposition than to criticism. Articles in philosophical and psycho- logical magazines are not noticed, though space is found for reviewing many distinctly theological works. Why a book on the descent of Christ into Hades should be reviewed in a philosophical annual, would probably puzzle either an American, an English, or a German editor to say. GEORGE A. COE.
