The great engines of imperial expansion?alliance and conflict?were fueled by greed for such revenues, though often the motives were cloaked in the grandiose rhetoric of religion or destiny. Programs of alliance and conflict were sometimes sparked by very personal incidents, such as those involving sexual vanity and jealousy. The interplay of empire building and sex operated through elite intermarriage, which was used to forge alliances by linking dynastic lines. This practice gave ample opportunity to use sexual identity as a lever to gain the good favor of a ruler by flattering his sexual ego or to inspire conflict (and thus earn lucrative reparations) by accusing others of adultery and sexual misconduct. Historical events as retold by contact-era chroniclers conveyed the appropriateness of various forms of sexual activity, given Aztec sexual mores and elite manners within the sacred context of the Aztec royal palace. There, the Aztec ideal of moderate and proper behavior should have been exemplified by the royal family, but Research for this paper was supported by and conducted at the Pre-Columbian Studies Library, Dumbarton Oaks, Washington D.C. The paper evolved from presentations of pa I ace-related research and interpretation at the April 1996 Dumbarton Oaks Round Table on Pre Columbian States of Being (organized by Jeffrey Quilter), at the November 1996 annual meeting of the American Anthropological Association, and at the Pennsylvania State University Department of Anthropology Colloquium series (February 14, 1997). I appreciate the suggestions and comments made by Elizabeth Boone, Louise Burkhart, Ken Hirth, Susan Kellogg, John Pohl, Jeff Quilter, Dean Snow, and David Webster. I also wish to thank the many ethnohistorians who have provided countless other scholars with direct access to contact era documents, particularly Doris Heyden for Dur?n's History and Charles Dibble and the late A. J. O. Anderson for Sahagun's works. 1. N?huatl, the language of the Aztecs, is less formidable than its multiple combinations of consonants would indicate. Accent is almost always on the penultimate syllable, "x" is usually pronounced "ch" or "sh," and vowel sounds are like those of Spanish. Thus Tenochtitlan is rendered "tay-nohsh-TEET-lahn" and king Axayacatl is "ah-shah-YAH caht[l]", etc. memorable incidents illustrate the chaos that ensued when such Aztec royals indulged in sexual pleasure. Aztec royal families were as plagued with sexual peccadilloes as some modern ruling lineages, and their annals contain some memorable stories, revealing a private and intrinsically interesting side of elite life in complex societies. The stories also use spaces within the palace as important backdrops, highlighting the action's harmony?or disjuncture?with accepted norms of behavior. We will see how the palace served as a context for sexual activity and an arena for sexual politics. The palace As apical houses of Aztec cultures, palaces embody household behavior on a larger-than-life scale.2 The Aztec palace's many denizens?the tecpanpouhqui3?ranged from the most exalted personage in the community (if not in the whole society) down to the slave who shoveled night soil. Cort?s wrote that Motecuzoma ll's palace was "so marvelous that it seems to me impossible to describe its excellence and grandeur. Therefore, I shall not attempt to describe it at all_" (1986:109). Despite this lapse, we know quite a bit about the Aztec tecpan call! (N?huatl word meaning "lord-place house") from other descriptions, plans, legal documents, and a few excavations. Like the term "house" in English, "tecpan" is often used to denote a dynasty, a "[u]nit of social organization of high nobles" as well as having the sense of "court; noble house;" "fecpanca///-palace or community house" was "often where high nobles lived but with some public aspects" (Cline and Le?n-Portilla 1984:15). Most usages make clear the combination of 2. The "house" as a metonym for the ruling dynasty within the larger culture has become a focus in recent anthropological studies. Ethnographic reports presented by Carsten and Hugh-Jones (1995) build on concepts developed by L?vi-Strauss (1982), while archaeological cases are presented by Pearson and Richards (1994) and Coupland and Banning (1996). 3. This N?huatl term meaning palace people "most likely . . . referred to all of the people who regularly lived, worked, or hung about the palace, regardless of their social class or estate" (Hicks 1984:163).</page><page sequence="3">168 RES 33 SPRING 1998 CUAUHTITLAN&gt;\ \ CHICONAUTL^ ?*+4&gt; Texqotzingo TEXCOCO Qhuatecpan S&amp; ^TtATELOLCO^^ ENOCHTITLAN VSvW AV CH?^ULTEPEC Chalca region Figure 1.

Map: Susan Toby Evans. residence and administration?these were the centers of power as well as the official residences of the ruling family. Many rulers had special administrative, residential, and pleasure facilities in buildings separate from the tecpan calli, but the tecpan calli always preserved the central focus of royal power and domesticity. In 1521 there were hundreds of Aztec tecpan palaces; now we have direct evidence of only a handful, and most evidence is ethnohistoric. No major palace in an imperial capital has been systematically excavated, but there are archaeological remains of elite residences in smaller communities. Some of the most interesting evidence is graphic: plans and views of Aztec palaces from the early colonial period (fig. 2a-d). The most abstract in simplicity are the two Tenochtitlan palaces: the palace of Axayacatl (Lienzo de Tlaxcala) and that of Motecuzoma II (Codex Mendoza). Plans ofTexcocan palaces (Quinatzin's [Cline 1966:89] and Nezahualcoyotl's [Mapa Quinatzin]) offer more detail, and in fact Alva Ixtlilx?chitl's (1985:2:92-97) commentary on the Mapa Quinatzin plan has long served as a guide to Aztec palace room function. Plans of excavated Aztec elite residential architecture in the Teotihuacan Valley arm of the Basin of Mexico are shown in figure 2e-f. The Chiconautla excavation plan (Vaillant 1966) is often cited as an example for the application of functions cited for the Nezahualcoyotl plan. The Cihuatecpan plan, the smallest of all in reality, is the Basin of Mexico case example providing the most detailed information from material remains (Evans 1988, 1991, 1993). Two key areas within the palace are the main courtyard and the family's residential quarters. The main courtyard complex is an obvious feature of these plans. This courtyard and its adjacent administrative rooms functioned for government, public sociability, and some rituals. Beyond it were other sets of rooms grouped around smaller patios. Some of these would be residential quarters for the private functions of family life and domestic rituals, as well as being the center of production of fine textiles by the palace women. There were rooms for sleeping and other indoor activities, with work, socializing, and child-tending taking place in the open-air courtyards. In the very back of the palace, service yards held temascal sweatbaths; other cleaning and maintenance activities took place there as well. Many palaces had gardens in patios within the palace walls. Access to all of the palace was the right of the ruler and the responsibility of servants; all others acted according to strict conventions, or bore the serious consequences of their trespass, following Aztec principles of moderation and correctness of behavior in these social and sacred contexts. Main courtyard: arena of pomp and politics A large central hall or courtyard is an essential feature of administrative palaces in many cultures, but in the Central Highlands of Mexico the courtyard was the central element in a standardized plan of the built environment, repeated at many levels (Kubier 1948:98; McAndrew 1965; Robertson 1968:24-25; Arnac?n 1992). Tenochtitlan's central plaza served as an exterior courtyard for the palace and other civic-ceremonial structures; it was also a huge public anteroom for the Templo Mayor precinct, the market, and the palace's main courtyard. Within the palace, the main courtyard led to more-private patios. All were stages in a gradient of access, wherein freedom to enter the more restricted space was a reward for valor or a recognition of high birth.</page><page sequence="4">Evans: Sexual politics in the Aztec palace 169 i-p.^Ll_lJ Figure 2.

It was also suited to Aztec political theatrics, providing an arena for lords who prided themselves on skill in rhetoric and mastery over details of ritual and historical lore (Zorita 1994:97-101). Feasts took place in the courtyard area and so did performances of singing, dancing, and acrobatics. But no matter how diverting the entertainment, entering the palace required a proper humble attitude: To enter his palace which was called tecpan, all took off their shoes, while those who entered in order to negotiate with him had to put on a coarse mantle; and if they were great lords or if the weather was cold, they had a coarse and poor mantle over the good one they were wearing. When speaking to him, they bent very low and did not raise their eyes. Motolinia 1951:268-269 Other chroniclers describe the same attitude of reverence within the palace (for example, Cort?s 1986:112; D?az 1956:209). Strong sanctions against treating the ruler with disrespect bespeak a defensive concern that disrespect was likely to break through at any moment. There were noted cases of dishonor toward rulers, who were denied tributes, cuckolded, ousted from power, and targeted for assassination, all by individuals who apparently assumed that kings were human and vulnerable rather than sacrosanct. In the setting of the main courtyard of the palace, the degree of formality in the presence of the ruler would seem to depend first on the norms of etiquette conveyed in law and custom and required by the occasion, and second on the presence of the ruler, whose personality and mood would also inspire and direct the crowd's temperament. In the main courtyard, people of many ranks milled around all day. Cort?s said that every day at dawn 600 lords and men of rank came to Motecuzoma M's palace, sitting or strolling through other rooms and corridors but not entering his quarters; "the servants [and retainers] . . . who accompanied them filled two or three large courtyards, and the street, which was very big. And they remained all day until nightfall" (1986:111). Courtiers "were always in attendance" waiting for assignments, because they served "as ambassadors to various regions, and were reassigned by his order; they also served as his ministers and executors of justice." (Zorita 1994:111). Errands of diplomacy and justice were often risky,4 as was military service, the other great obligation of the lords to the ruler, but in return the lords received land, labor service for their homes and estates, fuel and water, and "in addition to being free from tribute they had many other privileges" (ibid., 111). As further perquisites, "the ruler furnished them with wages, meals, and lodgings, for they served as gentlemen in waiting in his palace" (ibid., 105). Other sources indicate that gentlemen in waiting did not sleep at the palace (Duran 1971:196-197), but all agree that the lords boarded there and ate well. "When they brought food to Mutezuma they also provided for all those chiefs . . . and their servants and followers. . . . The pantry and the wine stores were left open each day for those who wished to eat or drink" (Cort?s 1986:111 ). At mealtime several hundred youths carried in "over a thousand dishes of the food" and "over two thousand jugs of cacao ... so that with his women and female servants and bread makers and cacao makers his expenses must have been very great" (Diaz 1956:211). Most Aztec commoners ate sparingly, and: Only the lords have a great variety of viands, sauces, and vegetable soups, pies and pastries of all the animals . . . fruits, vegetables, and fish, which are in abundance ... the Lords eat all they wish; and then what is left over is divided among other lords, their vassals, who are there in order to make their court to them. Saville 1969 [1917]:37-38 Cort?s may have been exaggerating when he asserted that "a towel which once used was never used again and likewise with the plates and bowls, for when they brought more food they always used new ones, and the same with the braziers" (1986:112), but whatever the fate of the linen and crockery (cleaned and reused in the palace, distributed as prestigious gifts, destroyed), a vast display?and consumption?of wealth took place. And in this social drama, the ruler was the central figure. His magnificent self was the rightful focus of attention, and his bountiful largesse was sought by all the underlings. Who was allowed to gather in the main courtyard? As early as the mid-1400s special areas were reserved for the use of certain individuals: In the royal palace there are to be diverse rooms where different classes of people are to be received, and under 4. In 1473 Tenochtitlan sent an insulting offering to Mohquihuix of Tlatelolco, carried by a nobleman. The Tlatelolcans beheaded him (Duran 1994: 256-258).</page><page sequence="6">Evans: Sexual politics in the Aztec palace 171 pain of death ... no one is to enter that of the great lords or to mix with those men. . . . Each one is to go to the chambers of his peers. Duran 1994:210 These special rooms surrounded the main courtyard, as the Nezahualcoyotl and Cihuatecpan palace plans show (figs. 2d, 2f, 3). The most prominent special room was opposite the main entrance. This was the lord's own room, elevated above the central courtyard; removed from it, yet overlooking it, his room was the "best seat in the house" and also the stage for political theater. The king's room also had major access to the palace's "backstage,"5 the residential, service, and storage facilities, and the private family gardens and shrines, including funerary monuments. Women's quarters: at home with the royal family Aztec palaces had suites of habitation rooms for the king's wives and other women; of the plans shown in figure 2, the excavated residence at Cihuatecpan (fig. 2f ) best demonstrates their layout. Figure 3 shows these suites of rooms, which varied in size and quality of location and finish. They would have been appropriate to the needs of the several wives of a country village lord and their children. One can safely assume that possession of a desirable private space depended upon the same factors of age, rank, favoritism, guilt, inertia, and luck as govern space allocation in residences everywhere, with the nicest rooms (fig. 3, "C," "I," and "D") probably being the domain of the principal wife and her children. The back courtyards of the Cihuatecpan building held the foundations of round structures, probably temascales, essential to Aztec daily hygiene and to the noble household establishment.6 Aztec purdah? Sequestering and the women's quarters Some sources imply that the palace women were sequestered, and the consequences of communication Figure 3.

From Evans 1988, 1991. with the outside world were grave. Alva Ixtlilxochitl (1985:2:169), writing in around 1600, asserted that Texcocan king Nezahualpilli's daughter was killed merely for speaking to her brother, and he recounts other instances of equally severe restrictions. But Karttunen and Lockhart (1987:10) point out that the severity of punishments recalled by colonial period informants amounts to "looking back to a Golden Age when everything was done right and austerity and severity prevailed, in contrast to one's own sad days" and that this "is characteristic of the time two or three generations after the conquest... of high nobles more than commoners. . . ." Ethnohistorians should remember this observation whenever behavioral reality is being sought through documentary sources, but particularly when accounts vary widely as to the behavior portrayed. The nature of Aztec gender relations is much debated,7 and the documentary sources are full of contradictory examples, should one be seeking proof of 5. Following Goffman's (1959) use of these terms. 6. For evidence of temascales associated with Motecuzoma ll's palace in Tenochtitlan, see Lombardo 1973:156-157. An ethnohistoric account of noble use of temascales is found in "Relaci?n contra los alcaldes y regidores" {Codex Osuna 1947 [1564]:13-40), the record of a trial of some native lords accused of lewd behavior?nude mixed bathing while drinking pulque. This was a period of great duress upon the native lords, from the colonial government and their own surviving people, and the court became convinced that this practice by these lords constituted a necessary component of their health. 7. See, for example, perspectives offered by Hellbom 1967, Nash 1978, 1980, Ladd 1979, Kellogg 1984, 1988, Brumfiel 1991, McCafferty and McCafferty 1991, Burkhart 1992, Evans 1995.</page><page sequence="7">172 RES 33 SPRING 1998 a single strong trend toward, say, a repressive reign of masculine terror, or a Golden Age of mutual engendered respect. The overwhelming tone of sources such as the Florentine Codex (Sahag?n 1950-1982) and part 3 of the Codex Mendoza (?alnek 1992) is of strong female involvement in public daily life at the commoner level; among nobles, a few women became rulers, and female involvement was more common at middle administrative levels (such as market administration, household administration, and master artisanship). All free women had civil and property rights (Kellogg 1984, 1988). The issue of sequestering women within the palace is of interest because it demonstrates a phenomenon common to rulers in complex societies, the conspicuous display of differential access to valuable commodities (Veblen 1953). In the Texcoco region, "the king had many houses in the city in different places, and gardens and recreations, where he had his women and where his children were raised with their nurses and servants" (Pomar 1941:28-29). Thus these were not simply private quarters, but were separated from the main palace, and from its proximity to the political, religious, and intellectual center of the city. Probably, in most tecpan palaces there were extensive suites of rooms for women and children, and the more uxorious kings may have enjoyed spending time there and wanted their wives and children close to them. Some influential rulers, perhaps anxious to emphasize their restricted access to luxuries like noblewomen, may have imposed purdah conditions in order to elevate their own status, but this was not commonplace in Aztec society. Polygyny: political and economic advantages The women's quarters of the Aztec palace resulted from polygyny, the right of any Aztec man who could afford it, which meant any man with a substantial regular income, as from rents or tributes. In contrast, farmer-artisan families could not "afford" polygyny because working the family farm depended on a fairly equal adult sex ratio for an efficient balance of farming and craft production (Evans 1990, 1995; see also Netting 1989). Polygyny made sound economic sense for Aztec nobles. They were supported by incomes from land holdings, tributes, and from quality artisanship; nobles produced precious items like painted books, featherwork, fine metal and lapidary work, and fine textiles. Women brought property (land, goods, and chattels) into the household, produced textiles (an important form of wealth and medium of exchange), and prepared the elaborate food, chocolate drinks, tobacco, and other stimulants so essential to displays of palace hospitality. Aztec kings advised their daughters to learn the textile and culinary arts well, so they could demonstrate their value to potential noble bridegrooms, thus securing positions as wives in noble households and supporting themselves at dignified crafts, rather than being reduced to itinerant vegetable selling (Sahag?n 1969:96). Polygynous marriages followed a pragmatic pattern. The principal wife (and mother of the heir) was from a more prestigious family than that of her husband, and her marriage cemented an Aztec noble's relations with a powerful lineage (Zorita 1994:90; Carrasco 1984). At the time of contact, Tenochca noblewomen outranked all others and were often principal wives. Secondary wives were from noble or affluent commoner families seeking to ally themselves with the ruler. Concubines had fewer rights, perhaps having been purchased as slaves. Commoners "regarded the keeping of concubines as scandalous" (Zorita 1994:133-134), but a concubine was valuable to the royal household if she could "embroider, or if she prepared food well, or made good cacao?from her hand good food, good drink came . . ." (Sahag?n 1959:44). Also, if she was sought after for her sexual skills, she might give birth to the future king.8 Sex, pleasure, and sin While sexual pleasure is one of the great human universals, every culture describes a somewhat different phenomenon. Although it is clear from many documentary sources and interpreters that Aztecs may well have been "the most moderate men known" (Saville 1969:19), careful not to lose their souls in sensuality, they also had what we might call a rather earthy attitude toward sex, in that they were well familiar with human bodies in all forms. Mixed-sex bathing in the temascales was not only common practice, it was regarded as unhealthy not to do so (Duran 1971:270-272). The Aztecs themselves would have called sex earthy, albeit for a different reason: the N?huatl word for sex, tlalticpaccayotl, meant "what belongs to the surface of the earth" (L?pez Austin 1993:67). But as the Aztec adage put it, the earth "is slippery, it is slick" (Sahag?n 8. This occurred very rarely, for example, Tenochtitlan's Itzcoatl (r. 1428-1440) was born out of wedlock (Chimalpahin 1965:196).</page><page sequence="8">Evans: Sexual politics in the Aztec palace 1 73 1969:228), and this perspective helps us to understand Aztec morality. As Burkhart (1989:58) interprets this adage, life for the Aztecs was a walk along a narrow ridge, with dangers on all sides. One slip and chaos ensued, engulfing the intemperate one, reaching out to destroy the family, the community and beyond.9 Sex was certainly regarded as pleasurable, and the N?huatl verb yecoa meant "to taste, sample food or drink; to copulate with someone" (Karttunen 1983:337), "an example of the common association of sex with eating" (Burkhart 1989:206, n. 17). Aztecs used aphrodisiacs in order to gain reciprocal affection; one recipe called for ground-up "enchanted" maize grains added to gruel or chocolate, to be drunk by the object of desire (Ruiz de Alarc?n 1984:132). The complex topic of sexuality among the Aztecs has been summarized by L?pez Austin (1988:283-312), Burkhart (1989), and Ortiz de Montellano (1989, 1990:150-153). Young people were expected to be chaste, because sex early in life would cause males to lose potency early and would unleash insatiability among women (ibid., 206). Brides should be virgins and brought shame on their families if they were not (Duran 1971:123). At certain times of one's life, any kind of sexual relation violated sacred precepts,10 and extramarital sexual activity was severely condemned. Many sources indicate that adultery was a capital offense for all members of society, as were incest, homoeroticism,11 breaking priestly vows of celibacy (Historia de los Mexicanos por Sus Pinturas 1965:91 ), and rape. Writing about adultery, Zorita (1994:130) noted one form of punishment, and its application to the nobility: At one time they used to stone adulterers to death, but this penalty was later changed to death by strangling or some other means. ... A ruler of Texcoco [Nezahualcoyotl] ordered his son put to death because he had relations with one of the ruler's wives, and the woman was also slain in conformity with the law. ... For the same reason another king of Texcoco [Nezahualpilli] ordered four of his sons put to death, one after another, and the four wives together with them.12 The severity of Aztec punishments reveals that the Aztecs understood the dangers of too much pleasure. Karttunen (1983:8) interprets many N?huatl words based on the root word for pleasure (ahuh) as conveying a sense of wasting time as well as enjoying one's self. One could idle away one's life on erotic love. Yet this is a different kind of judgment than that imposed by comparable terms in the European tradition, which placed love in the institutionalized domain of religion, while eroticism was found in the forbidden (and sinful) field of magic, according to Quezada (1994:22). In contrast, Quezada argues, for the Aztecs, religion and magic were unified, and erotic love was also a unified concept, and its expression strengthened and stabilized relations between the sexes (ibid.). The lack of congruence in the European and Aztec attitudes led to some difficulties of translation during the contact period, and the fusing of their diverse perceptions created some odd hybrids. For example, references to "harlots" in the Florentine Codex "reflect a considerable degree of acculturation [on the part of the native informants] . . . many attributes supposedly descriptive of the harlot reappear elsewhere in the Codex as the customary attire and decoration of Aztec noblewomen" according to Arvey (1988:190). This confusion of Aztec noblewoman with European harlot is based on physical features such as luxury of dress, ornament, hairstyle, and makeup, rather than upon sexual activity, though indulgence in luxury, like indulgence in sexual activity, was immoral to the Aztecs because of its "inordinate focus on pleasure to the exclusion of serious pursuits, not from an evil inhering in all worldly pleasures" (Burkhart 1989:131 ).13 "For Nahuas the basic cosmic conflict was between order and chaos, for Christians between good and evil" (ibid., 34-35). To invite chaos into one's life was to sin, and sexual sin was closely associated with "Garbage, excrement. . . and death" (L?pez Austin 1993:66; see also Klein 1990-1991:82-83). The patron deity of healthy sexuality (and many branches of artisanship, particularly textile arts) was Xochiquetzal, "the essential creative force, and all who 9. For example, because of Topiltzin Quetzalcoatl's intemperance, theToltec kingdom was lost. See Clendinnen 1991 for a similar perspective on the dangers of drink to the Aztecs. 10. For example, when Motecuzoma II did penance for eighty days, "He was not to be intimate with his wives or even be near them" (Duran 1994: 487). Members of the young men's houses should not engage in concubinage (Sahag?n 1979: 43) 11. Klein (1990-1991:86) noted that disembowelment was a punishment for sodomy according to Alva Ixtlilxochitl. 12. Per Duran (1994:210), adulterers were stoned, thrown into a river or out to the buzzards. 13. "The bad noblewoman ... is gaudy; she goes about in gaudy raiment?rude, drunk." (Sahag?n 1961:48).</page><page sequence="9">174 RES 33 SPRING 1998 participated in creative acts?transforming nature into art?paid homage to her" (McCafferty and McCafferty n.d.). Another member of the fertility goddess complex wasTlazolteotl/lxcuina, patron deity of sexual excess (and textile arts) (Sahag?n 1970:23; Sullivan 1982), the filth-eater to whom one made one's last confession. Another deity, Macuilxochitl/Xochipilli, "god of the palace folk," was patron of feasting, hallucinogens, gambling, and flowers, and he punished the palace people if they broke fasts in his honor by engaging in sexual activity: he "visited upon them . . . piles, hemorrhoids, suppurating genitals, disease of the groin" (Sahag?n 1970:31). This brief introduction to Aztec sexual mores indicates that the social consequence of these customs and laws was that virtually all sexual relationships were contractual, binding individuals to certain responsibilities for their behavior. Even the king could not wantonly rape the powerless without incurring negative comment. The Annals of Cuauhtitlan recount how refugees from Huexotzinco came to Tenochtitlan and some lived in Axayacatl's palace, where "the wives were ensconced in the kitchen quarters . . . [and] just cooked for" the king; Bierhorst (1992:127-128) interprets this and other similar incidents as demonstrating the circumstances under which rulers could "succumb to sensuality" and lose their dignity. In this case, Axayacatl showed himself to be a gentlemanly protector, not insulting the refugees?men or wives?by raping the women who served his household in exchange for his protection. In spite of the lurid tone of some stories, sex seems to have been a relatively unremarked upon part of royal life, possibly because many of the chroniclers (particularly the clerics) considered it to be an undignified topic, or possibly because for a king, it was available and of the highest quality whenever he should want it. Presumably, sexual partners were among the flock of service personnel maintaining each palace during royal visits, and they may have been wives and concubines from the main tecpan palace or local women. Sex in the Aztec palaces: vanity and violation The Aztecs expected nobles to have concubines, even though concubinage was thought immoral for commoners. But in many other respects, nobles had to be even more moderate in their behavior than commoners. Sahag?n's informants, themselves noble, record long speeches by the lords, expressing high parental expectations. The noble maiden is "worthy of being loved ... a virgin, mature . . . pious, pure of heart, benign, chaste . . ." while "the bad maiden . . . [is] given to carnal pleasure, impetuous" (Sahag?n 1961:46). But in their catalog of virtues and vices of noblemen (ibid., 15-22) and noblewomen (ibid., 45-50), carnality goes unmentioned, though in the more general section on characteristics of family members, they remark that "the bad son-in-law [is] a fool . . . given to pleasure; he lives in concubinage" and the "bad brother-in-law . . . lives in concubinage" (ibid., 8). King Mohquihuix: too many women in the tecpan palace King Mohquihuix was a bad brother-in-law in the eyes of Axayacatl, Tenochtitlan's king. Tenochca lords were fathers- and brothers-in-law to many of the other Basin of Mexico rulers, and one of their favorite pretexts for aggression was sexual rejection of one of their women in her role as principal wife (the Codex Borgia illustrates the problem of such a man in the middle, [fig. 4]). They used this charge against Mohquihuix, ruler of Tlatelolco (see fig. 1) in a campaign of aggression that culminated in Tenochtitlan's takeover of its sister city in 1473.u Tlatelolco capitulated when Mohquihuix threw himself off Tlatelolco's temple-pyramid (fig. 5) after an unsuccessful attempt to maintain independence from the Tenochca. Tlatelolco lost its dynasty, lost control of one of the most important marketplaces in Mesoamerica, no longer collected revenues from long-distance trade, and owed heavy tributes to their new lords?essentially becoming Tenochtitlan's lowest-ranking suburb. Clearly, much more was involved than Mohquihuix's sex life, but that aspect of the story was sufficiently remarkable to earn detailed description in such important sources as the Annals of Cuauhtitlan (see Bierhorst 1992:4, 113-114.) and Dur?n's History (1994). 14. Zantwijk {Anales de Tula 1979:18) cites six reasons for this Mexica civil war: (1) the personal rivalry between Axayacatl and Mohquihuix, who was Motecuzoma I's favorite and much indulged, eclipsing the brothers Axayacatl, Tizoc, and Ahuitzotl; (2) Mohquihuix's marital problems with his principal wife, AxayacatPs sister; (3) power of the pochteca, long-distance merchants, centered in Tlatelolco; (4) Tlatelolcan pr?tentions of purer nobility than the Tenochca; (5) two previous episodes of rebellion by Tlatelolco had not provoked a response by Tenochtitlan; and (6) Axayacatl, in this early phase of his rule, needed to prove his authority over Tlatelolco. A seventh factor may have been the death of Mohquihuix's great friend and protector, Nezahualcoyotl of Texcoco, in 1472.</page><page sequence="10">Evans: Sexual politics in the Aztec palace 175 Figure 4. Man between two women. This and similar images from the Codex Borgia may illustrate "numerological prognostication of the success of marriages" (according to Byland, citing van der Loo [Codex Borgia 1993:xxix]), After Codex Borgia 1993:19. These two versions of the story both stress the crisis situation within theTlatelolcan palace, the tense relations between the king and queen, and both were written by relatively unsympathetic observers. The native chronicler from Cuauhtitlan noted that Mohquihuix dangled that city-state as a war prize to those who would ally themselves with him against Tenochtitlan. He provided a much earthier version than did the Spanish cleric Duran (1994:254), who sympathetically portrayed the Tenochca noblewoman as a worried wife pleading with her husband not to gamble away their future. In the Cuauhtitlan version, Mohquihuix's Tenochca queen found distasteful both his attentions to her and his attentions to his other women, and complained about the situation to her brother Axayacatl. During sexual relations with his wife, Mohquihuix "would thrust his forearm into her crotch and feel inside her body/'15 One day, the orifice rebelled and prophesied his downfall: her "vulva spoke out and said to him 'Why are you grieving, Mohquihuix? Why have you left the city? There can be no future, there can be no dawn'" (Bierhorst 1992:113; in Dur?n's less lurid version, the queen's private parts spoke to her in a dream). 15. As to the accuracy of this story, it may be a libel, an exaggeration, a difficult translation of anatomical terms, or an accurate description of emotional and physical abuse by Mohquihuix. But in addition to sexual incompatibility so profound that the voice of doom emerged from one partner's organ of carnal pleasure: Mohquihuixtli was doing many bad things with women . . . scandalizing the people in many ways. He was fattening all his women until they were huge. . . . And then . . . he settled his concubines inside the palace [tecpan]. And, to give himself pleasure, he would bathe the concubines . . . he would undress his women, so that they could be rubbed with oil, and he cohabited with each one. Bierhorst 1992:113 It would be absurd to argue that Tenochtitlan took over Tlatelolco out of concern for the wholesome well being and pleasure of the ignored wife rather than out of irritation and greed, but the sex story served the purpose of publicly reinforcing the moral lesson: maintain moderate behavior and do not harm the dignity and sanctity of your official wife and palace. The Tenochca justified their actions because Mohquihuix had acted in an unseemly way in the public eye?in his main residential palace. This locational fine point may clarify whether kings had erotic-pleasure palaces; eyewitness accounts fail to Figure 5.

That it was scandalous for Mohquihuix to cavort with his concubines in the main palace implies the presence of an actual pleasure palace, or women's quarters, where the concubines lived and where this king could achieve sexual satisfaction without exacerbating his political pain. Axayacatl: sexual humor in the main courtyard Axayacatl was still in his teens in 1473 when the Tenochca defeated Tlatelolco16?it was his first great victory and was significant for strategic, material, and prestige reasons. Axayacatl, born in the mid-1450s, had spent his childhood witnessing Tenochtitlan's largely successful campaigns of political domination, often waged against the Chalcans, who controlled the southeastern Basin of Mexico. Chalca territory in the southern Basin of Mexico was "conquered" several times and was their most rebellious province within the Basin, finally becoming subdued in 1465.17 Axayacatl was a boy at the time, old enough to understand the significance of conquering the final recalcitrant set of city-states within the Basin; Tenochtitlan and her allies now securely ruled their core territory. They had deposed all 25 Chalcan provincial kings in the course of the conquest (Gibson 1964:42) and claimed substantial rewards, including Chalcan women given as conquest prizes (Schroeder 1991:54). In the mid-1460s, Axayacatl may have lived in the temple or seminary (calmecac) (Zorita 1994:135-136) but would have been well aware of the influx of captured women into the palace of his grandfather, the king (Motecuzoma llhuicamina, from whom he inherited the throne in 1469), as well as the Chalcans paying reparations by expanding the palace?and bringing their own materials (Alva Ixtlilx?chitl 1985:2:128). In the next few years, Axayacatl learned politics from time spent in the palace, the temple precinct, and the plaza between. He would have known the Chalcan palace people?the tecpanpouhqui ?his grandfather's Chalcan women and palace-builders and may have even inherited some as household service personnel19 in 1469 when he inherited Motecuzoma I's rulership and his tecpan palace (where Cort?s and company were housed, 1519-1520). Whether or not Axayacatl knew the conquered Chalcan palace women sexually, he would have known them personally and probably affectionately, because indulging the heir apparent is a long-standing practice of successful palace people. By the late 1470s, many Chalcan tecpanpouhqui would have become mothers of Axayacatl's cousins,20 and perhaps his own offspring. And yet their Chalcan homeland was still ruled from Tenochtitlan; not a single dynasty had been restored. One day in 1479, Axayacatl was in the interior of his palace with his wives when a musical performance by some Chalcan noblemen in the main courtyard drew his attention.21 He could not resist joining in the singing and dancing (fig. 6) and was "overcome with joy as he heard the song and so he too began to dance and spin round and round" (Chimalpahin, quoted in L?on-Portilla 1984:240), delighting in the "Song of the [Soldier] Women of Chalco," a Chalcan celebration of his own consummate skill as a lover. He rewarded the singer with an invitation into the family quarters of the palace. The "Song of the Women of Chalco" is an erotic challenge to Axayacatl, that he "get it up, make me a woman . . . put it in, put it in" (and so forth) in order to 16. During Axayacatl's rule, he shared power with Tlacaelel, the prime-minister-for-life, and probably also with his mother, Motecuzoma I's daughter and mother of three Aztec kings. 17. Hodge (1984:33-56) provides an excellent summary of Chalcan history. 18. For a palace housing several hundred people and hosting several hundred more every day, there would have been considerable diversity of special interest groups, based on such factors as ethnic background and rank in the palace household hierarchy. Factionalism seems inevitable in such a situation (see Brumfiel 1994) where all recognize that their faction's survival into a new regency depended on the good will of the new king. 19. These deliberately neutral terms bypass the issue of whether and at what point, he would have taken his grandfather's concubines (some of whom may have been quite young) as his own. The documentary literature offers a range of royal responses to situations of shared sexual access. Alva Ixtlilx?chitl (1985) offered several tales of woe betiding those who dallied with the women of Nezahualcoyotl (r. ca. 1431-1472) and Nezahualpilli (r. 1472-1515). On the other hand, Motecuzoma II, embarking on a program of penitence, which could have ended his life, "ordered that... if any of the wives wished to marry and someone asked for them, they were to allowed to wed, and husbands could be found for them" (Duran 1994:487). 20. "Cousins" is used here to denote all the possible and overlapping categories of relationship between Axayacatl and the offspring of his grandfather, uncles, brothers, etc., by Chalcan palace women. 21. These incidents are recounted in Chimalpahin's Relaciones Originales de Chalco Amaquemecan (1965:211-214), with an English translation in L?on-Portilla's (1984: 240-243) study of the erotic song. In the 1965 version the palace interior is rendered as "sus habitaciones con sus mujeres" while L?on-Portilla's text has "house of his women" a different meaning in terms of the layout and functions of the palace. See also Anderson 1982, Schroeder 1991:89-91.</page><page sequence="12">Evans: Sexual politics in the Aztec palace 1 77 truly conquer Chalco province, completing the Tenochca military conquest made by his army several years before.22 Picture the "sober" Aztecs, dancing to these lyrics in the palace courtyard, joined in the dance by the declared object of lust, a person upon whom few might directly gaze. This incident reveals a playful attitude about sex that is at odds with the European observer's focus on sexual conquest and sin (an issue discussed by Burkhart 1989; Herren 1991; Quezada 1994; Trexler 1995; McCafferty and McCafferty n.d.). It provides a counterpoint to recitations of old palace rules indicating the sequestering of women (Zorita 1994:131). It also shows political operations at the individual (agent) level in Chalcan manipulation of the politics of sex and the power of flattery. The premise of the song? that Chalcan women enjoyed sexual familiarity with the Tenochca king?may have been broadly understood by all present at the performance in the courtyard as a subtextual reference to the Chalcan women still in the palace. To try to get on the ruler's good side by appealing to his vanity makes perfect sense in any culture; to do so successfully is a tribute to the great Chalcan poet who wrote the song and to the skill of the performers. And the song's several subtexts all have the same goal of flattering the king and thus gaining his good graces. Did this song alter Chalco's unhappy subordinate political position, demonstrating the individual agent as a lever of historical change? It seems unlikely. In the Annals of Cuauhtitlan, the top story of 1480 (1-Flint) was Tenochtitlan's appropriation of plots of Chalcan land for its own use (cited in Hodge 1984:52). In 1486-1488, long after Axayacatl's death (in 1481), a few ruling lineages were restored, but Chalco remained firmly under Tenochtitlan's control (Hodge 1984:51). Perhaps the singer's performance improved the status of some Chalcans or perhaps the Chalcan women in the palace felt honored by the king and comforted by the presence of a respected countryman. In terms of great historical trends, the incident may have been irrelevant, but is an invaluable vignette of manners and mores in the palace of some very foreign titled wealthy people. In the story of how the Chalcan singers performed the song, the palace itself plays an essential role, lending dramatic dynamism by leading the singer to more intimate and potentially dangerous settings. Although the plan of Axayacatl's palace in Tenochtitlan exists only in the most abstract form (fig. 2a), we can assume that it had a private chamber for the lord himself, positioned for access to the public and private areas of the palace. The singer performed in the main courtyard, prompting Axayacatl to emerge from the palace interior to listen to the song, then to join the dance. Axayacatl retired to the interior, "to be with the young women who were his wives" (L?on-Portilla 1984:241) and from there summoned the singer. At this point the Chalcans could not interpret the king's mood and, in light of rocky Chalca-Tenochtitlan political relations, feared that their comrade will be put to death. But when the singer joined Axayacatl in the private quarters of the palace, the king introduced him to the wives and appointed him to be their "companion forever" and the king's singer (ibid.). Adultery and art: Chalchiuhnenetzin's quarters in the Texcoco palace Although Axayacatl danced with joy to the song of his sexual prowess, his restrained behavior toward the Huexotzinco refugees perhaps reflects an understanding that not all demonstrations of royal carnal vigor were desirable, and sex in the palace required careful and discreet behavior. But Aztec royal wives had no similar niceties of sexual etiquette to select from; they were either faithfully monandrous or they were executed for their adulterous experience (fig. 7). This was the fate of Axayacatl's daughter Chalchiuhnenetzin,23 the principal wife of king Nezahualpilli of Texcoco (r. 1472-1515). Describing one of the most bizarre expressions of sexual interest to be found in Aztec or any other culture, it was said that this woman took lovers and then had them killed, using their skeletons as a framework for portrait statuary for her quarters.24 It should be noted that, if this story is true, these creations seem to represent a powerful expression of an important artistic and spiritual trend of the times: anthropomorphic cult 22. The song is usually interpreted as flattering to Axayacatl, but Lucena Salmoral (1990) assumed that Axayacatl's prowess was being ridiculed. 23. His daughter, per Alva Ixtlilx?chitl 1985:2:164), the Huehuetlahtolli cited by Karttunen and Lockhart (1987:155), and Chimalpahin (1965:216); the Relaci?n An?nima (1953: 13) identifies the princess as the daughter of Ahuitzotl of Tenochtitlan, and thus Axayacatl's niece. 24. This, like Mohquihuix's story, may have been exaggeration, libel, or fabrication. But also like the other stories, the alleged activities were certainly possible, and not completely improbable, given their cultural contexts.</page><page sequence="13">178 RES 33 SPRING 1998 Figure 7. Adulterers; the stones by their heads indicate a common manner of executing such criminals. Drawing: Susan Toby Evans. After Codex Mendoza (1992):fol. 71 r. effigies, "idols [which] proliferated in the monumental ensemble of Tenochtitlan, occupying focal positions . . . at a multitude of shrines. . . ." (Townsend 1979:23). A cult effigy was a kind of teixiptla, a representational vehicle for sacred power that was clothed in the appropriate garments of a deity (or deities) and/or high ranking lord. "Living impersonators, effigies, or ritual attire assembled upon a frame were all teixiptla, with no particular notion of descending order of rank" (Townsend 1979:28), and all were as if "magically charged, inherently alive in greater or lesser degree with this vital force. Everything in the world was potentially a hierophany. . . ." (ibid.). Townsend suggests that another expression of the teixiptla complex was royal commemorative sculpture, such as the portraits carved into the cliff faces at the Chapultepec and Texcotzingo imperial pleasure parks (Umberger 1987, Evans 1997). Queen Chalchiuhnenetzin is reported to have told the king, her husband, that they were gods.25 Nezahualpilli eventually caught her involved with three still-living nobles, and she, her lovers, and hundreds of coconspirators were publicly executed in a festival atmosphere, with the king serving refreshments to masses of onlookers. An eyewitness to the execution who was a young girl at the time (probably in the late 1490s), recounted: it was done on a grand scale and countless people were punished . . . hanged . . . and crushed with stones along with the lady. ... All the world assembled, people came from the towns all around to behold; the ladies brought along their daughters ... to have them see . . . how the lord ruler Nezahualpilli fed people ... by which the Mexicah were very much put to shame. Karttunen and Lockhart 1987:15526 Nezahualpilli was restoring balance and harmony to his palace through the expression of lavish hospitality, the best food and beverages his respectable wives and servants could produce, as the traitorous wife's remains were burned, along with her collection of statues. Scandal had invaded the private quarters of the palace, and nothing less than a public airing of the situation? and harsh retribution?could restore equilibrium. The severe penalty inflicted on the Tenochca princess was just, within a tradition of harsh punishment, with nobles being punished most harshly. Thus Texcoco took the moral high ground on this issue, and the Tenochca dynasty had no immediate pretext for indignation or revenge. Interpretation These tales illustrate the workings of the great Aztec moral tendency toward moderation and away from the abyss of scandal. Were the stories true? How could we possibly know, given the many degrees of separation that come between us and the protagonists? And besides, the more important issue is: why has history preserved these (versions of these possibly factually based) stories? What lessons do they hold? The stories take the largest figures of their time and place and show what happens when sex governs behavior. Sex can make a king happy and benign (Axayacatl's song), it can form a powerful component of megalomania (Mohquihuix's downfall), or it can be a tool of destruction in the service of artistic?and anarchistic?expression (Chalchuitnenetzin's statuary). We read with interest these Aztec responses to the eternal call of hormones, because it is a universal call, evoking universal curiosity. But beyond that, these stories illustrate Aztec royal lives in that society's most important house. As Sahag?n's informants (nobles born and raised in Aztec palaces) knew: the house of the ruler... is a good place, a fine place, a palace; a place of honor, a place of dignity. . . . There is 25. An explanation the king found credible, because the Tenochtitlan Mexica were very devoted to their idols (Alva Ixtlilx?chitl 1985:2:164). 26. This is probably a good example of the "Golden Age" view of Karttunen and Lockhart (1987:10), discussed above.</page><page sequence="14">Evans: Sexual politics in the Aztec palace 1 79 glory. . . . There is pride, arrogance. ... It is a place where one is intoxicated, flattered, perverted. ... It is a center of knowledge, of wisdom. . . . Sahag?n 1963:270 The informants seem to go back and forth, characterizing the palace as a place where wonderful things happen and where people make fools of themselves; indeed, the palace was all the things they said and more. It is axiomatic that a palace is like a small city in its complexity of personnel and functions, containing many civic features in microcosm, with public areas, workshops, residential quarters, and even parks within its walls. Like the separate council halls in town, within "the rulers' houses were certain rooms and halls raised seven or eight steps from the ground, like mezzanines; here the numerous judges held court" (Zorita 1994:125). Among the social problems solved by the lords in their capacity as judges were marital discords (Nuttall 1926:72-73). Continuing his discussion of the judges' chambers, Zorita noted: Here, too, were heard and decided cases involving connubial disputes and divorce. When a divorce case was heard?which was rare?the judges attempted to reconcile the parties . . . harshly scolded the guilty party, and . . . asked the pair to recall the good will with which they had entered on marriage . . . urged them not to bring shame on their parents and relatives who had promoted the marriage . . . reminded them that people would point the finger of blame at them, for it would be known that they had been married. Zorita 1994:125 This, again, is a microcosm of behavior with a larger societal counterpart. Just as the open courtyard served as a feature at several levels of architecture?the civic plaza, the palace main courtyard, the private residential courtyard?so, behaviorally, did the rulers represent society as a whole. Sexuality was recognized by all as a tricky part of life?savory, and yet so dangerous. The desire for sexual satisfaction could bind together a marriage (Axayacatl and his wives) or drive a partner out of the principal relationship and into dishonor and death (Mohquihuix, Chalchiuhnenetzin). When the discordant couple was the ruler and principal consort, repercussions were felt throughout the society. Thus Duran (1994:256) records Axayacatl's thoughts on Mohquihuix's situation, that the sibling cities, with their affinal ties, should: stress the unions by kinship, by consanguinity and friendship, that had always existed. . . . They also would point out that shame would descend upon both when other people heard of the rancor and enmity that existed . . . and these people would laugh at them. As Zorita (1994:131) said, "death was the penalty for creating a scandal." For the moderate Aztecs, domestic quarrels at all levels were to be avoided?the sin of sexual misconduct consisted in drawing attention to one's self in an unseemly fashion and revealing a lack of harmony and an invitation to chaos within the person, the palace, and the society.
