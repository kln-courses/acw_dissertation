<plain_text><page sequence="1">Death &amp; the Afterlife in Pre-Colombian America. Editor Elizabeth P. Benson. A Conference at Dumbarton Oaks: October 27th 1973. pp. VIII. 194. Dumbarton Oaks Research Library &amp; Collections. Washington. 1975. Consisting of six papers presented to a Dumbarton Oaks Conference on Octo ber 27 th 1973, edited by Elizabeth Benson, these deal with the important concept of the Afterlife as it is concei ved by a number of societies, both those of a sophisticated kind &amp; others rather less so. Spatially, ranging from North America, through Mesoamerica &amp; South America, the foregoing not only consists of beliefs concerning past cul tures which are gleaned principally from archaeological interpretations, supple mented from ethnohistoric sources &amp; thuse still existing in communities that may have survival elements from prior groupings. The first paper hy James A. Brown, concerns the Spiro site situated in eastern Oklahoma apportioned to the Mississfppian Period. This has several mounds of various types, some covering the vestigial remains of former structures that have been recognised as mortuaries; Brown concentrated on the largest of these. Burials range from disarticulated accumulations of bones to the condensed skeletal remains of individuals apparently on litters of varving~seizes, the different treatment implying a degree of social stratification. Though there were ceremo nials burials, both the state of the re mains in the mortuary &amp; examples of Spiro art which have survived, indicate excarnalion was practised. The prolific grave goods of a large variety are inter preted by Brown in a social, political economic sense rather than having any significance to beliefs concerning an afterlife. Distinctive elements of warfare are apparent in both ceramic &amp; ieono graphic art which prominently features human figures attired in a bird guise interpreted as falcons, a symbol in some manner connected with martial activities, imputing some of the human remains were of a warrior hierarchy. Actual surviving costumes of the same repre sentation &amp; other items that can only have shamanistie connotations, imply that at least beliefs of an ancestral spirit world was envisaged. Peter Fürst substancially argues in his contribution that contrary to the prevail ing opinion, the West Mexican funerary art of the prehistoric peoples of Colima, Jalisco and Navařit, as exemplified by the ceramic effigy objects, prior to the post-classic period was devoid of any esoteric or iconographic significance, the foregoing was of a funerary nature, emphasizing the shamanistie features of a more anthropomorphic kind. These, particularly those combining human &amp; animal characteristic, he suggests have analogies with the ones that have a place in the religious lore of the Pueblos &amp; Cora Huichel. Citing models from the foregoing &amp; the Chinese, he proposes the West Mexican people at this epoch envisaged the spirit world as a place where ordinary functions with reserva tions were performed, co-existing with the temporal one. Post-classic sophistication is the subject of Cecilia F. Klein's study examining the chaotic aspects of Aztec cosmology with its innumerable deities as reflecting similar attributes &amp; functions in ap parent unrelated spatial concepts some contradictory &amp; impinging one upon the other. These it is asserted however when synthesized, represent a coherent cycla dic pattern incorporating all pantheon manifestations whose renewal &amp; conti nuance was regarded by a macabre the ological philosophy as dependent upon human sacrifice that was predominant in the later stages of the Mexican religion. Michael Coe summarises the abundant archaeological evidence concerning Maya burial practices and some interpretations regarding the Afterlife based on icono graphic &amp; mythological sources. He demonstrates that the attitude toward human mortality differed considerably from the Post-Classic &amp; was regarded wih dread unlike the stoicism of the former &amp; is expressed in the term for underworld "Xibalba,';. Ethnohistoric sources attest a conviction of the im mortality of the soul though it is pos sible that these are not entirely without a hint of Christian syncretism. The ela borate elite burials of the Pokoman Maya ailuded to &amp; the mortuary impli cations of the archaeological assem blages constituting the ceremonial cen tres emphasized by Coe, corroborates the prevalence of such beliefs in the Maya area prior to the Spanish Conquest. Reviewing the Maya death symbolism and the significance of scenes on Maya funerary ceramics Coe interprets some of these as being related to the Popol Vuh concerning the divine twins, Hu napu &amp; Xblanque &amp; their triumph over the Lords of the Xibalban underworld. The foregoing he plausibly regards as representative &amp; possibly a survival of beliefs of the hazards encountered by the soul prior to its apothesis. Klizabeth P. Benson analyzing scenes appearing on the pottery of the Mochica whose habitat was situated on the north coast of South America, a large portion of which it is maintained are of a fu nerary kind &amp; exhibit concepts of an Otherworld. This has distinct marine features that imply the engress was through the sea and it was placed the other side of it. As the conception of their Otherworld is limited to a highly formalized complex ceramic iconography, the exact significance of the sacrificial &amp; erotic aspects is difficult to evaluate. It is probable as inferred by Elizabeth Benson, the more elaborate of these scenes may represent the final ritual &amp; the immolation of the victims before the great lord was consigned to the tomb. The unique feature is as the symbolic indications would suggest that priests were among the sacrificed, im plying it was necessary for possessors of esoteric doctrines to accompany the soul through its passage through the Other world until its apothesis was acheived, a vital circumstance as Elizabeth Ben son emphasizes to procure &amp; ensure the fertility &amp; continuance of the Mochica. The combined paper of Jane Dwyer &amp; Edward B. Dwyer discuss the fun erary practices of the Peruvian south coast as derived from a series of related archaeological horizons as represented by the Parcas cemeteries. The excavated tombs have provided a multitude of mortuary bundles amongst whose cont ents are numerous embroidered textiles many of which depict an iconography that hints of a spirit world presided over by an Oculate being that has both zoo morphic &amp; ornithological characteristics. The head-hunting attributes 'associated with the latter suggest in common with the Mochica some form of death cere mony. Johannes Wilbert's paper, the final one of the interesting Symposium discour ses on the eschatology of the Warao 236</page><page sequence="2">Indians of Venezuela. Exhibiting ele ments of both a cruder &amp; of a sophi sticated kind, an anthropocentric three dimensional orientated universe of five stages populated by a numerous pan theon of deities &amp; spirits with whom a Warao throughout his earthly exi stence has to interact &amp; avoid if possible being consigned to the Underworld as a sacrifice for the spirit-shamans &amp; the Macaw god is envisaged. Incor porated in this elaborate cosmological concept are the various spirit lodges, that of the shamans being situated in the mountains at the World's end, the abode of the cardinal gods, while those of the guilds such as the boatmen &amp; the weavers were located at other points in the cosmic vault, conceived as having a bell-shaped pro file whose upper rim was roughly the level regarded as being marked by the maximum altitude of the extreme sol stitial points. The foregoing has a rem arkable similarity to portions of Post classic cosmology, significantly sustained by Wilbert's extrapolations concerning Waruo astronomical lore regarding the Southern Cross. The combined papers of this interest ing symposium indicate that all the aboriginal societies discussed, though some questions must remain open in regard to the Spiro possibly because Brown concentrates on the economic implications, exhibit features in their eschatological beliefs, ideas of the After life. It also demonstrates that the sym bolism expressed in the papers of this volume, mainly through ceramic &amp; textile sources can be made to yield interpretations of a significant kind &amp; indicate that methods employed, a com bination of archaelogical &amp; anthropol ogical parameters could be usefully ■employed in a wider context.
