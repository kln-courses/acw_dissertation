<plain_text><page sequence="1">GUSTAV1 USTAV Contemporary Ceramics /</page><page sequence="2">Editorial Ceramics Alberto Ruy Sánchez in the Sun One of Artes de México's aims is to seek a new and different way of understanding those artistic phe nomena in Mexico that we might consider excep tional, and then to bring them before a wider audience in a high-quality publication featuring excellence in both form and content. We use the term "artistic phenomena" because it is through aesthetic forms that we question first our wonder and admiration, and then the meanings their existence may have in our eyes. In our eyes, each work is both itself and much more than itself. The Portu guese poet Sophia de Mello said that the beauty of a ceramic object "is only the face, the form, the sign of a truth from which it cannot be separated. I do not refer to aesthetic beauty but rather to poetic beauty." And Artes de México's task all this time has been to draw attention to that "poetic beauty," to understand it and to show it in the best light possible. In short, to par ticipate in what the poet described on contemplating an amphora as, "the bewilderment of being in the world, a fragile alliance with the stuff of life." It is be cause of this idea of meaningful transcendence that we have placed a particular emphasis on those forms that exist at the outer limits of the visual arts that are often less than aptly described as utilitarian or decora tive. We have established a new territory in publishing, within another growing territory where the distinction between artisan and artist is less and less clear, or at least less problematic. Ceramics is one of those fields that is at once old and new, from which cre ators of enormous force are emerging all the time. Historians of civilization agree that pottery is one of those unequivocal indications of the subtlety achieved by a human group in its history. And Mexican ceram ics are and have been quite exceptional. The obvious thing would be to look to the past. Everyone has heard of our centuries-long splendor in the art of clay, of the many traditions that influence our ceramics and of the astounding vitality of Mexican artisans with links to specific communities. Clear ly, ceramic arts form a many-pointed star. But what may currently be consid ered the paragon of ceramics made by Mexican hands? One of many possible answers to that question is an artist in clay whose work has attained a maturity and formal richness that is not often seen, as if the fires of time had favored only him, focusing all their energies on rais ing the leaven of his creativity. The artist in question, named Gustavo Pérez, is the subject of this monograph that ex tends over several decades, thus allow Pages 81, 87, 88 and 96: Sketches from Gustavo Pérez's notebooks.

Here, we have drawn on an extraordinary retrospective of his work at the Franz Mayer Museum. Some of the world's most highly regarded writers on the subject of ceram ics have contributed to this publication, appearing along side poets, narrators and critics. Their intelligent exami nation of Gustavo Pérez's work takes a number of different approaches and suggests many more. We are convinced that, though it has already achieved full creative maturity and international recognition, this artist's work will receive yet more well-deserved atten tion in the future. )§( Translated by Michelle Suderman. Deepest Skin The Kindest Cut Garth Clark The cut on a pot by Gustavo Pérez most closely resembles a clean slice of a scalpel. He has a surgeon's skill in the precise and measured way in which he cuts though the skin of the pot. The clay then divides and exposes its interior much as our flesh reveals itself when we suffer a deep lac eration, breaking the perfect seal of the body's epi dermis. One cannot look at these incisions without the ubiquitous anthropomorphism; the vessel exerting its spell of transference, making one's own skin itch with sensations of vulnerability and risk. 0 Almost all verti cal pots (but not plates or shallow bowls) are some what anthropomorphic whether the artist intends them to be or not. This means that they express elements of the human body. Most cultures through time have universally employed the figure to describe the various segments of a pot according to their resemblance to our bodies; foot, belly, shoulder, neck, mouth, lips. Some potters use this deliberately and literally like Rudy Autio and, in his vessel-making days, Akio Taka mori. Others use it abstractly, like Hans Coper, to in troduce a subtle dialogue about sexuality and eroti cism. £ Some do their best to rid their work of man's insistent presence. Fred Marer once told me that he visited Peter Voulkos in his studio in Los Angeles in 1957 and found the master of Abstract Expressionist ceramics sitting in front of his wheel, angry and frus trated. Voulkos explained to him that he had spent the entire day trying to throw vessels that were non objective and yet with each new form the presence of the figure grew stronger, mocking his attempt to cre ate pure abstraction and neutralize the pots' anthro pomorphic inclinations. £ My guess is that of the three approaches, Pérez's is closest to Coper's. Pérez is far too serious a scholar of ceramic art to think that the figure can be exorcized from the vessel but he is also far too nuanced an artist to play that card liter ally. His forms are not unusually figurative in form but it is the cuts that evoke this context even more pow erfully than if he directly mimicked the human torso.

Incising skin has many contexts in society and depending on one's experience, it will engage different responses. In many tribal societies in the past and even today in remote corners of the world, attaching permanent signs to one's body has impor tance in determining status and values within a tribe. This can be found today as well in our cities amongst hardcore followers of piercing and more radical tattoo aficionados who are creating relief textures on their skin by placing objects under the skin (much in the same way as Pérez inserts his pellets.) £ The pur pose in the past, like most things that became pure ly decorative, was functional or at least, practical. It was used to establish tribal identity so that one did not accidentally kill one's own in the heat of battle (and to identify the bodies in the aftermath). It can also be used negatively as a sign of warning, rejection or pun ishment, marking an individual as immoral, a criminal, or for other reasons designating them persona non grata. In some tribal cultures it is used like insignia to indicate achievement such as the arrival of adulthood or to establish rank. At other times it is done out of a spirit of Darwinism to show that the bearer of these cuts is a fearless warrior. Livid scars where the cuts have healed, tell us that this man is courageous, un afraid of pain, all signals to frighten and weaken ad versaries even before the first blow is struck. Then after all these uses had been replaced by less intrusive sign age, it has been retained as beautification, applied like permanent jewelry merely to add ornament to the body. 0 Is this what Pérez is talking about? Is this what his knife is exposing? One senses that to some extent it must be part of the emotional language of his vessels, if not by intent, then by default. Either way, the viewer is left with this information and has to pro cess and mix it with the other messages and moods that his pure stoneware pots project. What is clear though is that this is not about violence. The gestural energy on his surfaces is cool, not hot. The surfaces are smooth and soothing to the touch. The material, heavily grogged stoneware, has a comforting surface, sen sual and rich, old and wise like rock. The cuts do not penetrate the body of the pot. They are careful, mea sured, orderly and have a beauty. They are not jag ged, raw or angry which would indicate a more pathological intent. &amp; But as rich as the tribal meta phor may be, this content seems to me to be sub text. It may have been a starting point or, like Voulkos's figural pots, something Pérez never sought out but arrived at unbidden. But if one stays with this idea alone then one is missing the sharpest cut of all. Pérez is clearly a formalist. His work shows a reductive and ana lytical nature, a counterpoint to the primitive and the sensual that we have just explored. $ Pérez's pots have an intellectual element—these are, to use Peter Schjeldahl's term, "smart pots"—that instincts us that he does not want us to remain mired in sentimental ethnocentricity. The surface activity may grow busier or calmer, but the shape of the pots, the foundation of his art, exhibit a continuous quest for economy, for how to make more from less. And Pérez is remark ably consistent in following this path. $ To better un derstand his work I would suggest that, if one is not already familiar with the latter paintings of Lucio Fontana, that one pick up a book or go to a museum and spend a few hours with the cut can vases by this Italian modernist who was not just a great sculptor but also one of Europe's finest and most original ceramists. Fontana, like Pérez, is a three-dimensional man. His paintings are remarkable in that he treats canvas as sculpture. By slicing through monochrome fields of red, blue, pink, green and white he is activating space in a way that painters cannot, not through illusion but by physical acts that rend the planes of the can vas. $ Pérez does something similar but instead of fully penetrating the pot's surface, a common act through the history of pots (functionally to make colanders and aesthetically to connect the inner space and the outer), he stops just short of piercing the membrane of clay that encloses the interior volume. Fontana made no bones about the fact that punctur ing the surface was a kind of sexual act. 0 I can imagine that some will read this essay, scratch their heads and wonder if I have been sitting in the dark imagining Pérez's pots for too long. Can these friendly containers embody tribalism, body decoration, modernist formalism, sex, trans gression and beauty all at the same time? If this was written about a painting, no one would dare question that it could be that complex. We are schooled to expect the most of painters and the least of potters when it comes to content. But an artist's depth of expression is neither determined nor restricted by any medium. It is the artist who decides how eloquently a material will speak through his or her hands, heart and mind. £ So my suggestion is that when you look at Gustavo Pérez's work, do not do so with the overly simplistic notion that a pot is merely a pot. Pots have always been containers but not just of food and liquid. They have been revered for eons for being receptacles for our worship, dreams, hopes, fantasies and history. They have even been entrusted the bones of the deceased and the spirits of the dead. It is only in our own time that we have sought to limit their metaphoric range. $ Experi ence the sliced clay through your own skin. Trust your body to respond at first perhaps even more than your mind. Then return to a more con scious contemplation, enjoy the way in which Pérez uses line to animate the surface, his careful placement to create pattern, the subtle shifts in negative and positive space, the rolling wavelike rhythms. If you give it the same time and respect you would give any other art object, you will find that Pérez's knife does not just cut into the clay but into the human soul. In so doing he ventilates our spirit and allows it to breathe. )$£ 83 n</page><page sequence="4">Subtle Skin Alfonso Alfaro There are men who were engendered as flesh by their gods; others that were created from maize— their body is of corn. We were formed from clay. Yahweh was not the only potter: Rah in Memphis and Knuhm in Ele phantine had already done the same (although they used a wheel). &amp; Since the dawn of our civilized existence, there have been Prometheus es whose boldness was punished with the chains of effort and hardship. The fire they had stolen allowed their children—our forefathers—to pos sess the power of lightning and volcanoes. Because of that we have been able to burn, boil, cauterize, bake, roast, smelt and forge. &amp; Cook ing, metallurgy and pottery are the offspring of that same intrepid act of playing with fire. They share the characteristic of being activities carrying a heavy symbolic charge that does not allow them to definitively remove themselves from the territory of the sacred. &amp; Hence, in traditional soci eties, ceramic production is a strictly regulated trade, limited to select castes, age groups, and even to a specific sex—sometimes men, some times women. The forms and volumes of pottery and its ornamentation are also subjected to strict codes, and their different elements frequently use secret languages that can only be deciphered by a restricted group (like the lines drawn by Berber women, which are incomprehensible even to their husbands and sons). &amp; The artisan creates useful objects that are at the same time beautiful: his or her work obeys fixed patterns but leaves a lot of room for creativity and the imagination. In other words, it is both productive work and play. Each piece is at one and the same time object, form and meaning (apparently explicit, though frequently arcane). 0 The relationship between ceramics and writing has at times been paramount: recall the baked tablets of Sumerian writing, not to mention the fact that the first movable-type printing press—invented in China 500 years before the Gutenberg press—used small pieces of baked clay to reproduce different characters. 0 With the use of the wheel, the human body and the instrument—that is, nature and culture—become one. The development of pottery is indelibly associated with the devel opment of the civilizations: the Neolithic revolution was closely linked to the rise of ceramics. Many millennia later, an obsession with porcelain led the Europeans of Renaissance and baroque times to try to decipher the secrets of the Chinese, and later compelled the monarchs of the Enlight enment to create Royal Porcelain Works that would manufacture these delicate, translucent pieces which were the instrument and insignia of true power, both political and economic, founded on subtlety and refine ment. &amp; Unlike metallurgy, the ceramicist's work is clearly a peacetime activity—of what use would a clay sword or shield be? Its greatness lies in the fact that it bears the mark of our species: fragility. A blend of the humblest of elements, trampled by all living creatures, its very material is the same as that of our common home, the planet Earth. We are con stantly reminded of the cosmic nature of our body and the destiny we share with the universe because of its earthly essence. This is thanks to the relationship between our flesh and the earth, and between the earth and the arts of the earth: agriculture and pottery. &amp; Each vessel can be a Heideggerian metaphor for a fundamental crossroads: the conver gence of our planet and the heavens, of mortal and divine beings. £ The artisan molds his material around an empty space whose walls gradually acquire a rounded or elongated form. Living water is an essential aspect of the configuration of clay and is indispensable to giving it shape. Fire purifies and hardens, beautifies and sublimates, bringing out surprising colors, as well as the texture and luster that draw our avid sense of touch (as well as that of sight, as lustful as that of birds or insects). Finally, air —the fourth element—surrounds it gently to dry it and give it its final stability (insofar as any substance as breakable as our own bodies could be stable). &amp; The primary techniques and the use of language and symbols made us a species apart, in the same way that laughter did. They are manifesta tions of the spirit that makes us human. Tools and the mechanical arts are just an extension of our body and spirit, of the body's organs and functions. $ As such, textiles and basketry are the expression of our creative skill; we make the iron forge ring with the vigor of our muscles; cooking empowers the action of our viscera (the metaphorical seat of love and other passions) and of our mouths (speaking and kissing). Pottery, howev er, is an art involving the four elements, one in which the palms of the hands and the fingers slowly sculpt the moist, yielding material. The body (clay animated by reason and will and dreams) caresses another kind of body that is equally fragile, in an attempt to com municate its nostalgia for paradise.

Prismatic Skin A Line Frank Lloyd of Thought "It seems to me that clarity of thought should be ac companied by clarity of technique." — Piet Mondrian Skillful and precise execution of ideas marks the work of Gustavo Pérez as a major and distinctive voice in the world of contemporary ceramics. Throughout his thirty-year career, as he has explored ideas of contain ment, openness, symmetry, branching, patterning and line, Pérez has been a master of controlled form. Gus tavo Pérez makes vessels and sculptures that are sim ple, smooth and symmetrical. Their elegance is due to the precision of the incised lines and other markings on the works. As he ventures into the sculptural realm, where the larger vessels have greater reference to the corporeal or organic, there is a remarkable ability to con trol the medium and to work within its physical proper ties. He also makes dimensional constructions, a kind of blending of wall-relief sculpture and physical draw ing in clay, which explore the ideas of branching, abstract patterning, and linear progression. Here, too, Pérez pres ents clarity of vision, adept execution, and a sense of grace and natural elegance. $ For any artist, the choice of medium is of utmost importance; that is obvious. The medium is a vehicle for the expression and trans formation of ideas and feelings, and it is certainly not an accident that Gustavo Pérez has chosen clay. As he stated at the World Ceramic Millennium Conference in 1999, "the creative relationship between an individual and clay is always necessarily a deeply personal one, because if the involvement is not deep the results can not be creative." Clay is a medium with extraordinary properties, among which are plasticity, availability and tactility. Because of these properties, ceramic artwork is universal. Though its ceremonial and functional his # 84 Alfonso Alfaro Frank Lloyd</page><page sequence="5">tones are ancient, the medium is a valid and relevant means for a contemporary artist. Perhaps because of its tactility, ceramic sculpture holds a place in our expe rience that is unlike any other. The directness of manu al presentation of ideas is nearly as immediate as the art of drawing, yet communicates the sensuality of touch. In a recent essay on the work of American ceramic sculptor Ken Price, the New York critic Peter Schjel dahl wrote: "Painting exercises the eye; sculpture echoes the body. Ceramics express and are addressed to the hand." £ While using the same clay body (a sand colored stoneware) throughout his work, Pérez achieves a wide range of form and pattern and includes slowly undulating walls beneath the subtly incised surfaces. When looking back over the many manifestations of ideas in ceramics by Gustavo Pérez, there is a unity provided by his use of ceramics, as well as the unity in herent in his return to themes and compositional ele ments. The high-temperature stoneware clay body is usually fired above 1200 degrees centigrade, when it becomes vitrified. In the hands of Gustavo Pérez, this stoneware clay body has become the basic building material, as well as the canvas for his composition. Whether he plans to engineer a series of lines, develops a pattern of slashes, or chooses to insert other clay elements into the surface of the clay, everything is inte grated through this basic medium. Like a painter em phasizing the depth of color, Pérez will also apply glaze into the incised areas on a work, carefully and meticu lously drawing our eye to the design. £ Part architec ture, part mathematical pattern and part lyrical move ment, the sleek ceramic constructions are grounded in principles that relate to the built environment as well as sculpture. Due to their reliance on geometric form, their symmetrical characteristics and their construction pro cess, Pérez's forms are clearly architectural. Perhaps this, too, is not an accident, for Gustavo builds his work as if logic and technology were indispensable to art. The progressive principles of making a form, then cut ting it into modular units, assembling another form, and integrating the design with the structure are com mon to architecture and to the work of Gustavo Pérez. He is sensitive to the building of form in his own work, proudly aware of the built environment of his country and especially aware of contemporary Mexican archi tects. When the artist discussed his country at the same world conference, he acknowledged "the many ex traordinary contributions that this oppressed, poor, conflictive and many times neglected part of the world has made to universal culture. And I am not only think ing about the extraordinary ancient pre-Columbian cul tural heritage but also about our century with the con tributions of writers [...] or the architecture of Luis Barragán." While the architect may have other compo sitional elements at his disposal—such as scale, light and space—there are some similarities. It is evident that there are affinities in architectural form, as Ignacio Díaz Morales states: "The shape of [Barragán's] spac es is clear and simple, composed of spontaneous, constructive geometry, an essential condition for all ar chitectural form. Space is manipulated with great agil ity and always aims to express the identity of the Mex ican soul, without using inappropriate exoticisms." $ Without making specific reference to Mayan culture, the works of Gustavo Pérez are in some ways evoca tive of that pre-Colombian culture. Perhaps this is an elusive and poetic quality that Gustavo Pérez shares with his fellow Latin American artists, writers and archi tects. "The ceramic art of the Maya, the Olmec, the Zapotee as well as the Korean, the Chinese, the Islamic or the Greek is our common heritage. We all profit from knowing it and the aesthetics, the sensibility and the techniques this huge legacy transmits," Pérez has not ed. $ Yet worldly influences are certainly a strong part of the evolution of the work of Pérez. He lived for three years in Holland, and has traveled and exhibited in Ja pan. In more recent years, he has spent long periods of time in France. The Dutch and Japanese influences seem to meld with a sensitivity that is markedly Latin American. To the art historian's eye, much of the work presents ideas from twentieth-century abstract art. It seems to viewers in the United States that the sensibil ity of an artist like Gustavo Pérez must involve an ap preciation of the great abstract painting of the early twentieth century—the painting of Kandinsky, Malev ich and Mondrian. Some may see a link to Miró, with the playful meander of line—but without any surrealist imagery. Others will note the use of slashes in the sur face of the vessel—a territory often ascribed to Lucio Fontana. Still others will see relationships to the work of Spanish sculptor Eduardo Chillida. However, be cause the extraordinary achievements of Gustavo Pérez include his ability to transpose the ideas of twentieth century art into his own key, the work is never repeti tious or derivative. He has consistently incorporated his knowledge of abstraction and mathematics into a lan guage of line and form that is entirely his own. $ The artist has also been a keen observer of the essential, almost mathematical patterns in nature. His use of branching line or a circumnavigation of the vessel by a slashing spiral seems to mark the growth of seminal form. The kind of synthetic art that Gustavo Pérez practices is related to the working and reworking of some themes that can be found in understanding the physical world. His background in mathematics, engi neering and philosophy are evident as we encounter the basic patterns of nature in his work. At times, there may be a connection of dots that seemingly refers to an imaginary constellation. A meandering line, sym metry of outlined form, a reflection of a pattern—each time Pérez takes the line in a different direction. $ The pieces also seem to present a vision of nature, wheth er it is the slow peeling of bark or the architecture of a beehive. There are lessons from the field of mathemat ics known as topology. Pérez understands the world of topology well, for his patterns and lines must con form to the constraints of space—those dictated by the surface area of the sculpture. In this area, we see how effortless the pieces appear, betraying the plicated process that may have been involved in planning of the circumnavigation of the pattern or In fact, many of these patterns obey strict math' cal laws. Peter Stevens wrote in his book Patti Nature that they "fall into only seventeen distinct metry groups. Every two-dimensional repetitive be it in brickwork, textiles, wallpaper, modules planning, or in the arrangement of molecules cross section of a crystal, is but a variation on one of 85 -ji,</page><page sequence="6">\ / those seventeen groups. The groups are made by the regular translation, rotation, and reflection of their parts." $ Always keeping a distance from direct quotation of any sources, the pots have a sensuous and musical sense of composition. During the past two decades, Pérez has created a visual language that seems close ly aligned with music. Pure in form, with significant structure but without specific associations, his lan guage of line and blending of forms mark his work as lyrical and often intuitive. In this way, the works are not just container and receptacle; they become aligned with the ideas of music, in that themes are repeated and developed. As he circles around and returns to what seems to be a new group of Open Forms, the artist now includes the further developments from other bodies of work. Thus, a building of ideas becomes symphonic. $ In fact, it is this very musical building and repeating of themes that is, in retrospect, the essence of the work of Gustavo Pérez. As we look at the evolution of the work, from the earliest vessels of the 1970s through the more recent open and sexually suggestive forms, we see an evolution and a transformation. The works open up, and then become incised with line, rhythmic pat terns are applied over and around the curved surfaces, and vessels are cut open and reassembled. As time goes on, the trajectory includes the building of more complex forms, still using the sinuous line and feeling of rhythm—a reintroduction of the established themes. Open Forms become something else, a sequence of vessels that illustrate a line of thought. The clear horizon tal lines, following the form of the pot, waver slightly as the hand caresses the interior of the vessel. As the artist returns to the works again and again, every moment in the studio is brought to bear on the later work, and the compendium of experience produces an extraordinary caress of the forms, a trajec tory of ideas that transforms and enrich es our perception. 0 To all of these ele ments—the material specificity, precision, architecture, natural pattern, mathematics, music—Gustavo adds the poetry of sen suality and intuition. This is what makes all great art sing, and when sensuality is com posed in concert with the tactile medium of ceramics, the result is magical. ^ Above: Pots, 2002. Porcelain with glazed incision.

Was it a bee? It was flying too high to be easily identified. Its wings seemed to reflect the intense color of the palm fronds, and it was lost to sight among them. But it as it passed by ripe dates, it appeared oddly indifferent to their sweetness. Was it a blowfly? It seemed to be fleeing from something. Was it in fact a small cricket with noisy wings? Or was it a locust? $ For months, the city had feared the arrival of this great plague. The news had come from the other side of the desert: there were millions of the noisy winged creatures that devoured everything. There was no efficient way to combat them. They had decimated crops in Mali and Nigeria. They drank an entire lake dry, and in the desert, consumed all the water from the springs of three oases. They had plunged into the arid sea of the Sahara in an act that some considered sui cidal. Others were convinced that they could get to the other side of the desert, to the walled city of Mogadon It was common knowledge that to cross the Sahara, it would take them more than twenty-seven weeks. Ev eryone was hopeful they would not survive the journey. They would have to eat each other to make it. They were capable of doing so. &amp; But was this sudden, swift insect in fact a tiny locust? The first of them—the scout? Or the only survivor? It came in over the plaza, creating a brief fresh current in the hot air. It flew over the basket sellers and among the pottery stalls. For an instant, its fluttering was indistinguishable from the per fect blue and green arabesques covering some clay surfaces. It went into the workshops. It was not inter ested in a carpenter who was concentrating on putting together one of those disconcerting boxes of aromatic wood—a very small, dark one, its surface beautifully in laid with light-colored wood. And when it went next door, entering the workshop of the greatest potter in Mogadon it stopped flying. It landed on the uppermost part of the lattice covering the windows. 0 The pot ter immediately felt its presence on that threshold. He looked toward the lattice, but against the sunlight, he could only see the tiny silhouette of something at rest and restless, almost lost amid the delirious geometric forms of the wood. £ But he could not think about that for a moment longer, because his hands were, almost literally, "in the cookie jar." He was working on the wheel—that spinning center of the world, of his world. From between his fingers, a piece was begin ning to emerge—one that now, more than ever, he hoped would be perfect. This piece was like none of the other thousands of pieces that had taken shape in his hands. 0 He knew that in his trade, perfection was never exclusively the result of planning or even of H 86 Above: Pots, 2002.

And that many other factors came into play besides his hands, most of them governed by fate. And that fate itself was like having other hands working alongside him, either for or against him. In the end, fire was the chief artisan of his work. What came out of the kiln was for the most part the result of a coin tossed in the air. He had learned to control many of his possibilities, but naturally, never all of them. To be a true creator is to know that. Possibilities engulf us in work and in life. To be a master of a trade does not mean having a good command of everything but to know you are navigating on the tides of the material, and that they may flow up ward or downward. But it also means knowing that everything you do counts. &amp; The slightest tremor of a finger on the spinning clay between his hands will change the destiny of what he is creating. Anyone seeing him seated at the wheel could think that the forms were already waiting be tween his fingers to be liberated, free to emerge into the light, into our gaze. And finally, into our hands, as well. At home or at the market, when we touch a ceramic piece, we touch the hands of whoever made it. We touch a part of his dreams. &amp; And the dreams of the greatest potter in Mogador were unusually intense today. They were surely special. Part of the earth that he was touching at that moment had been moistened by the body of his beloved. We may never know exactly what part, nor under what circumstances. A few drops of her blood? A tear or two and a bit of her saliva? Something else? It is up to each person to try to imagine how and where the hands of the potter were moistened and then—over and over again—dried immediately in a bit of earth beside his lover's bed. 0 This piece must have been the most beautiful and powerful of his creations. But he was not yet satisfied. Anyone else would have thought it was perfect— his finest work. He aspired to transcend everything he had done to date, and did not know how to make that leap. It would not necessarily be a forward leap. He lacked something unpredictable. "Maybe that will come with firing," he thought skeptically. £ Tarik Razaali, the greatest potter in Mogador, lived and died cultivating three passions which he aspired to convert into one. $ The first was creating exceptional pieces of ceramics. He had spent his entire life in this quest, and becoming a maalem—a great master—had been a fortunate but insufficient consequence of this. The challenge was always reborn in his hands. $ The second passion was being an attentive lover, with hands that moved over his beloved's body as deftly and as boldly as they had learned to move over clay. He was aware of the fact that the radical desire to "be loved" had mixed with his desire to make perfect pieces, just as earth mixes with water. $ His third passion was to see his life as a path moving upward toward perfection in those two arts: that of love and that of clay. He literally made this path a religion, each lover a goddess, and each of his loving gestures a prayer, a ritual. $ It should come as no surprise to anyone, then, that his ceramic creations were described as "poems in clay." And that when Tarik was asked—to no avail but repeatedly—whether he felt he was an artist or an artisan, he always answered, "I am only a lover of clay." £ I am told that when he caressed a lover, he seemed to be listening to her with his fingers, like someone learning to decipher a secret script on every nude body. However, he stated that "every beloved body conceals a Greater Revela tion, and only on rare occasions are a few careful lovers afforded the privi lege of sensing it, of witnessing it, of feeling how that body exerts its abso lute—in other words, divine—power over them." 0 It seems he was an artisanal lover, an extravagantly passionate man, an obsessive artist. A religious man, but only within his own religion: he was a heretic of clay. &amp; And that day, he was at his wheel, ritualty worshipping that earth seasoned with the moisture of his beloved when the tenacious insect landed on the windowsill. Tarik turned back to the clay while the insect flew in circles over his head as if the potter were on the insect's wheel, being modeled by it, by its flight and its strange buzzing. Was it buzzing? Especially because each time the sound intensified as the insect flew close to the potter's ears, some small part of his body twitched. A vibration of his eyebrows, the hairs on his arms rising. Another human being might not have noticed it. The insect did. And with its ritual dance, it began to dialogue with the small movements the potter made, inciting them, of course. 0 Tarik tried to ig 87 n nore the unnerving flight of the insect and concentrate on his exceptional work. "Don't even blink," he told himself. But he was overcome by a growing urge to crush the piece between his hands. £ As he could not even inspect the insect at great length, he didn't know whether it was a bee, a wasp or a fly. Finally he remem bered the ravenous and parched threat that was crossing the desert. A chill ran down his spine. But he managed to turn back to the clay spinning before him. He was precisely adjusting the piece's mouth, feeling the sensuality of its texture and its slightly distended lip. $ The insect perceived Tarik's tense interest in the clay in his gestures, and, inevitably, took it as an invi tation. Suddenly, it began circling around the open mouth of the vessel and then homed in on it. 0 Tarik was concentrating on the piece's movement, and was powerless to prevent the flying insect from entering the darkest depths of the embryonic pot. Once in side, it stopped, and in that concentrated shadow, in that diminutive night, Tarik discovered what kind of insect he was dealing with. It was a cocuyo beetle! A close relation of the firefly but with the appearance and size of a cricket. A creature that glows in the dark. They live in the sugar-cane plantations surrounding Mogador. People take care of them because they be lieve the souls of the dead inhabit their light. And as proof, they have seen that when one of these insects dies, its luminosity continues. Its light does not die with it. For that reason they are also present in the poetry of Mogador. So much so that if a poem, song or dance is found wanting in grace, it is said to "lack cocuyo." Meaning it lacks light. 0 When he identified the un expected insect, Tarik jumped. His sudden movement clumsily left the mark of his astonishment on the piece. Something he never would have done intentionally. But it was much better than trying to trap it inside by closing up the clay mouth, as he wished to do for a brief moment. The beetle had entered through his eyes, had moved his hand from within, and had taken his breath away. And that accident had made him pro duce a work that finally, at least in that moment of plenitude, could appear perfect to him. )$£ Translated by Michelle Suderman.</page><page sequence="8">The Dance Francisco Hernández of the Ungrateful For Gustavo Pérez The Dance of the Ungrateful is circular and Gustavo the ceramicist makes it spin before his eyes. Touch going around a wheel, and around him, a radiation born in throats of wax with spherical curves. The Dance of the Un grateful is circular and Gustavo the ceramicist makes it dazzling before these orbits, while the clay of antiquity transpires a living water that is sure to become a flood. The Dance of the Ungrateful is an astronomical ritual and Gustavo the ceramicist, through his walls of Dutch clay, listens to Rembrandt and Monteverdi in conversa tion: 'Textile vessels are honeycombs of incense," says one, "and the wasps are beginning to buzz." £ "Con secrated vessels," says the other, "with their paraffin reservoirs, create divergent languages that never forget the fire where they once roasted...." ^The wasps, un grateful and engrossed in their dance, sink their sting ers into the palms of the conversationalists and the kiln emigrates, like a great glass orange. &amp; Because of the intense pain in his hands, Gustavo the ceramicist awakens bathed in sweat on the seventh floor of a ho tel in Japan. &amp; "I thought I was in Xalapa," he says out loud as he inspects his knuckles, where the day is try ing to dawn. $ He turns over his pillow, closes his eyes and remembers the persistent rainfall. A cloud of wasps enters through the door. The dance is about to begin anew, around another dream. Translated by Michelle Suderman. Knowledge of the Skin A Passion for Clay i A writer's text about an artwork, an artist's oeuvre or an aesthetic tenden cy differs from one written by a critic. The writer wishes to share the visions that an artwork has produced within him, but during the writing pro cess he is plagued by an uncertainty as real as his enthusiasm. He is already aware that every art form possesses an inscrutable core which obstinately re sists decipherment and inspires poetry and the per fect page. This is even truer in fine art, where the writer must take a different kind of language, com posed of lines and colors, and translate it into words. $ When speaking about Gustavo Pérez's work, it is also crucial to clarify the position now held by ceram ics in the hierarchy of the visual arts. This means first knowing whether there exist greater or lesser arts, and what specific qualities an artwork must possess in order to occupy its spot on the vast and complex grading curve. There is something distasteful and un clear in this distribution of medals and decorations, partly the result of a eenturies-long inertia. I imagine that the alchemy that either draws people to each other or to animals, or makes them reject each other, is similar to the alchemy at work between viewer and art object. There are works that reach a person instantly and totally, while others are slower to be accepted and must overcome reser vations and discomfort. I have encountered artworks in which seeing and accepting seemed to happen simultaneously—without having any prior information, and often without even knowing the name of the artist—when the barest initial glance has produced the utmost admiration and pleasure, and it has never bothered me that the creators of these works use different materials. The majority of them are painters; others, like Brancusi, work bronze and stone; or else iron, aluminum, mica and bakelite, in the case of Gabo and Pevsner; glass, in that of Taio Wirkala; and ceramics, like Gus tavo Pérez. At no time did I feel a greater or lesser degree of pleasure be cause of the different periods in which those artists lived or the materials they worked with. 01 met Gustavo Pérez a little over twelve years ago, after hearing about the excellence of his work from Ida Rodriguez Prampo lini, who is attentive to and knowledgeable of his entire artistic venture. A few weeks after my arrival in Xalapa I had the chance to see an exhibit of his recent works. I was amazed by their meticulous manufacture, the myr iad flights of the artist's imagination and instinct and their secret unity, if I may, I would call it a ceremonial art charged with passion, discipline and # 88 Francisco Hernández Sergio Pitol</page><page sequence="9">jubilation—an adventure that changes its form as it evolves. &amp; On that occasion the museographer had ensured that every pot, bowl or tablet interacted with the space and extracted from it a visual aid to show the pieces in all their splendor, as if the material were breathing freely and each of the objects were reflecting the beauty of the others, depending on the proximity or distance between them. One striking feature of Gustavo Pérez's ceramic works is their refined, ex tremely elegant design. Another is that this elegance and refinement appear as something perfectly natural, created effortlessly, like Brancusi's sculptures or Gun ther Gerzso's work, but with another specific quality: the absolute freedom these clay pieces convey by al most immediately communicating to the viewer the dynamic skill of the hand. &amp; I left that gallery re-ener gized by the discovery of this work and the pleasure it had produced in me. This brings to mind Wittgenstein's incisive observation, quoted by Gustavo Pérez in an essay on aesthetics: "In art it is hard to say anything as good as saying nothing." I remember that Luis Car doza y Aragón—who had one of the broadest, most influential perspectives imaginable—always used to say that writing about art was impossible, at least for a poet. $ In fact, every artwork, whatever the genre, contains a mystery that creates a certain magnetism; and that secret point, that fortress besieged on all sides, which is what transforms something into a true work of art, does not surrender to any scrutiny. Every generation, every artist, every aesthetic will sense the existence of that mystery and find a way to explain it, each holding passionately to that particular version, but at the same time conscious that in art there is no ab solute truth, no last word. That is one of the greatest attributes of freedom. In this sense, I understand Witt genstein's maxim: "There's nothing better than si lence when trying to explain an artwork." But a writer, particularly a poet, is given a broad field of action: his imagination. His task is to write a parallel text inspired by an artwork, which describes it and begins to reveal its enigmas and powers while drawing its sustenance from within: from its literary devices and resources. It is the greatest tribute a writer or poet—and here I am thinking again of Luis Cardoza y Aragón and of Octa vio Paz—can pay to art and to the artists producing it. &amp; Writing about art can be a kind of torture. It is like walking a tightrope over a chasm with the constant fear of plunging into it. Talking about art, on the other hand—whether with admirers or detractors of an art work, painter or trend—is a healthy exercise of the spirit, often even a resurrection, because it means set ting out, time and again, an endless series of ques tions about creation in general, about the history of art and humanity, the eras in which artists lived, their achievements, their limitations, the materials they worked with, the circumstances of their time, their fili ations and their phobias, their specific "taste." It even implies an investigation into what we are and what we were, into the human condition, but also into the splendor, the glory and the prodigies humanity has spread throughout the world as testimony to our exis tence. &amp; Our era has inherited the tendency to admire great artworks—"great" being understood to refer to both the work's physical dimensions and the difficult material conditions undergone by the artist in order to carry out his work. This Babylonic vocation has for centuries relegated certain artists to obscurity because although they express themselves masterfully, they prefer to do so in small formats. The truth is that it is impossible not to be overwhelmed by the splendor of a large-scale composition by such important painters as Matthias Grünewald, in his great retable at the Isen heim monastery; Michelangelo, in the Sistine Chapel frescoes; or José Clemente Orozco, at Pomona Col lege or the Cabañas Hospice in Guadalajara. But one only has to then see Giorgione's Sleeping Venus or, in a smaller format, The Tempest, to corroborate in purely aesthetic terms that these canvases contain all the wondrous talent that painting can aspire to in a concentrated form. The list would be infinite: Goya's Burial of the Sardine is a work of the smallest dimen sions, as are the most beautiful Vermeers and Picas so's splendid self-portrait of 1904 that officially marked the beginning of cubism. The Mexican School of Paint ing conceived of muralism as the highest creative form, considering easel work to have a merely secondary function—whether idle entertainment or an anti-his toric impulse. But to obtain one of Luis Garcia Guerre ro's exquisite mandarins I would give up many kilome ters of murals lining the walls of government buildings around the country. Only when Proust bestowed on Swann a passion for Vermeer did people begin to re consider this masterful painter who had previously lan guished in the awesome shadow of Rubens. Utter in sanity, is it not? 0 Since viewing that excellent exhibit on my arrival in Xalapa, where my infatuation with ce ramics got its start, I have followed Gustavo Pérez's career. I always admire his transformations. In our con versations, his words represent the sequence of steps he has taken to advance his craft. His achievements are outstanding. Risks do not daunt him; he faces them with lively enthusiasm, and his refined manner prevents him from bragging of his victories. His recent trips—to Japan in particular—have given him confi dence in his intuition, and allowed him to ratify one of his premonitions: that the roads of art have no end, inexplicably forking, multiplying, intertwining; that they all lead to Rome and yet none actually get there be cause in the artist's eyes, the end of the road is always just a little further along—perpetually over the next rise. £ These study and work trips have convinced him of some simple home truths. He knows that the potter's craft is the basic source of his creativity, and that the vessel itself is his starting point, because every adven ture has sprung from that primary piece. Such a con ception allows him to produce creative games that are classical and contemporary, established and experi mental, depending on how the mind of the person playing them is structured. The pot is the mother of teaching. From it derive all the variations an artist capable of conceiving. $ Pérez is fond of remindii of the fantastic potential of clay. It can move acroi broad spectrum, from sacredness to the radically playful. One only becomes a potter when the hand has managed to discover the potential of the many kinds of earth in existence. Clay captured Pé rez from a very early age. It grew to be a 89 H</page><page sequence="10">&amp; great pleasure, a passion, a need. He is a man who surrendered his soul to clay forever. Thinking of clay is in some way akin to outlining infinity. Few objects al lude so much to eternity as those that were modeled from earth. We can observe ancient cultures and study their different facets from their artistic legacy. In Meso america, Peru, Crete and the Cyclades, in Babylon and most of Asia, the civilizations and the cities them selves have disappeared, but to know something of their spirit we turn to the ceramic and stone objects that have survived them. $ The reigning god for many centuries, ceramic art spent equally as many centuries doing penitence—the poor and disdained Cinderella of the art world. The creators of this superb, refined art—the artists who fashioned the delicate figures of Jaina, the complex Zapotee deities and the smiling faces of Totonacapan—became potters and brick and tile makers after the Spanish Conquest. At best, some regions preserved their traditions, and the local crafts were able to avoid industrial monotony. Few Mexican visual artists have worked in clay. Juan Soriano was perhaps the first, and his sculptures from the 1950s are superb. Recently, Francisco Toledo has used clay very imaginatively. Gustavo Pérez—the final link in this chain—has established a new alphabet in ceramics. $ Gustavo Pérez is an incredibly cultured creator. He knows the history of art to perfection, especially where ceramics is concerned, and he is also interested in studying its recent trends. This knowledge, I imagine, has distanced him from trivial forms, from mass pro duction with molds, from archaeological reproduction and also from folklore. His work is in constant move ment. He experiments, and when he creates a piece that truly captures his interest, he plays with its form, producing variations until he finally moves on—after far-reaching ramifications—to another era. For him each period is an end and a beginning. He returns to the past in order to advance, yet that does not imply a step backward, but rather a unitary sign of his cre ation. Each new firing is a revival, a wealth of discover ies, a new beginning. $ I am convinced that his stud ies in his youth—engineering, mathematics, philosophy, not to mention a permanent love for literature and mu sic—have been the bedrock for his present work. When he was eight years old, he told me, he heard a composition on a transistor radio that moved him deeply. He later discovered it to be none other than Twenty Contemplations of the Christ-Child by the avant-garde composer Messiaen. By eleven he had already read most of Dostoyevsky and Tolstoy. Basi cally, it seems to me that all these side pursuits—musi cal composition; reflection on musical structure; analy sis of poetry, painting and sculpture; playing chess; reflections on language and other interests—were sig nals, feelers, approaches, a dark roundabout quest that finally drew him to his destiny: the potter's wheel. Every artist's past counts toward the final result. May be without the mathematical and philosophical stud ies, without his hunger for literature and music, his work as a ceramic artist would have been different. In the spaces of art everything is interconnected, and any shred of life experience is filtered &gt;. into the process to become part of the final result. Pérez's ability for reflection and his creative talent are revealed in the origins and processes that lie behind these magnificent smooth objects we see emerging innocently from the kiln. &amp; I imagine that from his very first contact with the material, this cera mist was aware of clay's potential, vocation and resis tance. He knows that attempting to force the clay would mean a fruitless struggle and certain defeat; that one must coax the material to "speak." And only the hand can do this. &amp; After having read the philo sophical essays by his young friend José Vasconce los, an equally young Alfonso Reyes recommended that he establish an order between the concepts and the act of writing. To this end, he would have to give his hand its freedom, and learn to think with it. Wheth er a person writes music or poetry, makes ceramics or porcelain, paints or sculpts, he must allow the hand to act, let it think. This is especially important in the case of ceramics, where manual workmanship decides the overall result. $ Writing is always visible in Gustavo's work. The importance of form is immediately appar ent; nothing appears to be the product of a whim or of the dictates of fashion, but rather of freedom. His con sistency in this sense takes on all the trappings of an elegance that is neither superficial nor decorative, but essential. However, behind that consistency and that ascetic elegance, we can visualize an immense uni verse of games, tensions, shared experiences, sepa rations and reconciliations between form and instinct, between impulse and reason. &amp; I often visit the artist's studio. I watch him work, I walk past the many shelves filled with his pieces. The proximity of the pieces inten sifies the value of each one of them individually and as a group. I feel like I am inside the Tower of Babel, hear ing the murmur of the earth in Crete, Mycenae, Tar quinia, and in Japan, China, Java and Indochina; in Cuzco, in the regions we now call Colima and Jalisco, in Totonacapan, Jaina, Mitla, Teotihuacan, and in Bab ylon. Shadows that have accompanied humanity through his history; incisions, scrapings and carvings that are also our tattoos. All cultures, great names and great eras are encapsulated in the vessels, goblets and tablets we see here. They also contain the talent of the creators that Gustavo Pérez admires most, and who have helped define his aesthetic path: Mondrian, Klee, Kandinski, Brancusi, as well as the German ce ramic artist Hans Coper. The pieces on the shelves could only be those of a single creator. The forms might vary, but standing before each piece we would not hesitate to say, "This can only be by Gustavo Pérez." $ Since 1976, the year he held his first exhibi tion in the Casa de Cultura in Querétaro, this cerami cist's work has seen changes, fortunately not In es sence but in the metamorphosis involved in the creative process and in the wide acceptance it has found both at home and abroad. In 1999 a superb retrospective exhibit at the Modern Art Museum in Mexico City sealed Pérez's prestige. People unfamiliar with his work were amazed. The exhibit had a ripple effect, earning him admiration not only in Mexico, but in the United States, Holland, France, Spain, England and the Far East, in all of which places he is renowned as one of the greatest ceramic artists of our time.

The hands' skin hears the sound of the earth in the ceramic pot's depths. It is not a pure sound—it has passed through other hands. Are hands not pure? Indeed: they pos sess the purity of the earth—a purity that is mixed, paradoxical, linked to the errant heavens and the verticality of a body that models itself and models the world. Earth and hands at the conjunction of sound and touch: a synesthesia of ceramics, a fusion and intermingling of the senses. &amp; I have been using my hands to listen to these objects made by Gustavo Pérez at his studio in Veracruz.... Now I am no longer near them. But in my hands there remains the pure, mixed, paradoxical sound of their forms. In the form of these and those remembered objects, my eyes carry the image of the hands of the ceramicist who, with a shamanic gesture, plac es them before me. Whoever touches these objects sees with his hands the sound Gustavo Pérez has produced in his ceramics studio. Continents. When I approach the pots, ashtrays, vases, pitchers, or simple containers that Gustavo Pérez has produced in his kilns, on his wheel, in his imagination, I think and feel a whisper of Atlantis. There is humidity here. In this deep and disturbing immobility of the ceramicist's ob jects, there is nostalgia for rising seas. Vertical seas that join the Earth's Skin: the capital letters indicate that upright nostalgia for Atlantis. With my hands submerged in this material sound that is rising up on the table in the gallery, I evoke a city, a continent, through those Containers of Continents. $ The tide rises along with the sounds of the earth. The Ocean rises, caus ing vibrations in the wings of the halcyons—those mythical birds that brought peace, and thus were able to make their nests on the surface of the ocean's waves and were lulled by them. Gustavo Pérez's pottery is made of fire and ocean: flames and water, moisture that is detained in the dreams of the earth. &amp; Atlantis has a perfect silhouette in these material evocations of the tools of its inhabitants. And so I imagine, before Gustavo Pérez's tangible imagination, that the use of these Continents corresponds to the use that the inhabitants of Atlantis, the imagined Continent, could have given them.... Here, a goblet to be filled with the oil that must be lighted for the lares; there, an incense burner for the prince's marriage; that red mouth made of earth from arable lands to summon the halcyons. The ceramics of Gustavo Pérez: the spirit of Atlantis and the transcendental serenity of halcyon energy. Work. But that peace, that transcendental serenity, is made up of ten sions ennobled by the positive energy of work. A human being's hands were here, giving space and meaning and form and volume and tangibil ity to presences. It is the same work that the great Catalan poet Salvador Espriu talks about in La pell de breu, a book on Catalonia and Spain, referring to the "bull's skin" that one can see spread out in the silhouette of the Iberian peninsula. Espriu writes: "There is no choosing a prince / for he who has spilled blood / for he who commits treason or theft / or for he who did not build, / little by little, the temple / of his own work." £ The divided and alienated work of man, the work that shackles and bur dens is liberated here: in this instance where the materializations of hu man activity again touch the material of earth and fire, water and air. The presence of work becomes a temple. Again, Salvador Espriu: "In the law and pact / that you will always keep / in the hardness of the dialogue / with your equals, / build the slow temple / of your own work." ^ It would appear that Gustavo Pérez has heard these words that arrive on the strong winds out of Sepharad. In his retreat in Veracruz, he works as if possessed to present us with the Objects of the Temple. Incisions. The ceramicist's objects bear incisions inflicted with admirable meticulousness. Delicate slits, openings that draw the eye and the hand into the surfaces' interior. Inside, outside: the incisions are the strokes of this miniscule dialectic. Some re semble stylized vaginas made by the knife with which Saura would have liked to slash Guernica after the transatlantic journey of Picasso's "big poster." But the stylization obliterates the blatant sexuality to transform it into eroticism: sexuality without a pur pose, purely ornamental sexuality—the expenditure of null and void economies, a squandering of plea sure—in which the earth fuses with the sounds of the air and allows us to see the spirals of ceramic synesthesia. The incisions dream—they slip into the pure blended immobility of their presence: the chal lenge of the entrances that fascinate, drown, re deem, conjugate, blind and dazzle us. Elements. Gustavo Pérez's ceramic work spins within its rigidity. Even if we do not touch them, these objects attract the hands and also the ears. They are there: mute, like literature itself. Described, alluded to, mentioned, examined at close range and from afar, they convoke the senses to create an elemental language. All of the elements from the classic quad rangle are united in the navel of these pieces of sky, sea, bonfire and plain. Held up before the Gaze, they create their own space and practice incisions in the halcyon atmosphere of contemplation. &amp; Gustavo Pérez gives his pieces igneous colors. At the same time—but what time is this in which immobility gets ahead of the moment, the now, with the vertigo of insatiable futurity?—at the same time, he fills them with fluid transparencies that accumulate and unfurl. 0 So much rigidity is dizzying, because it is fluid. Then comes the all-encompassing thoroughness of the air: the freshness of ceramics like a breeze cov ering faces and gazes. Finally, the beginning: the ar dent skin of the earth in the environment, in the imagination, in the mouth of the furnace. I smell and savor the elements that are tenuously impregnated in the invisible belt around the Objects of the Temple. Synesthesia, Continents, Work, Incisions: The elements with which the ceramicist's synthesis ex hibits the figures and purifies the forms. A purity of blends that are touched and confused by the life of the hands, the eyes, the mouth, the ears, the nose. The earth's skin is this nomadic series of presences with which Gustavo Pérez recounts the elemental and prodigious History of the Tribe. ^ Translated by Michelle Suderman. 92 E Hue ■</page><page sequence="13">Itinerary of the Skin A Retrospective View G u s t a v I have said it a thousand times: mak ing ceramics is something I have to do. It is inevitable. And it has been from the outset, since that day in 1971 when the scent of fresh clay— and especially the possibility of giving it form on the wheel—caught me in its trap forever. Without any idea of the implications of such a life choice, it became clear to me that the search was over. Since then, ceramics have indeed been the nucleus around which the rest of my life revolves. Almost the only unquestionable truth in my life. $ It is a process that may appear to have been steady and continuous, but in fact has long been haphazard and unpredictable, requiring frequent ad justments to circumstances. What was, or appeared to be, the right thing to do twenty, ten, or even five years ago is today inadequate or unnecessary. What is pos sible or even essential today was unthinkable in the past. The demands and expectations of work are constantly changing. Gradually getting closer, though never close enough, to that unreachable something that inspires all creative efforts. This drive is all one needs to continue a journey toward that goal which, for want of another word, we call art. £ It is up to others who have the necessary distance and perspective to try to judge the outcome of my work and its significance. Having lived with it every day, my own judgment is to tally subjective. I can, however, try to recall the wealth of my experiences, images and ideas that I know, or sup pose, to have influenced me. 0 For a start, I remember that in my childhood, as the eldest of six children, I had a strict upbringing, but at the same time it was never ne glectful of my needs. In fact, I can safely say, without beating around the bush, that my parents' life as a cou ple focused wholly and exclusively on bringing up their six children. So I'm taking this opportunity to express my deepest gratitude for their unstinting generosity and understanding. Particularly because I believe that their unconditional support was a key factor without which I would never have been able to spend so much time searching for my path in life—a path which, before I found ceramics, was for many years uncertain, full of doubts and worries. Curiosity and perplexity, interests that never jelled into anything real, like the desire to be a writer or a musician, accompanied by assorted pas sions—for chess, climbing mountains, traveling the world (or at least studying maps)—but always with the sensation that something was missing. In the same way, my studies in three different faculties at the Na tional Autonomous University of Mexico (unam)—engi neering, science and philosophy—were chosen more out of curiosity than as a true vocation. And I was always left with the unsettling impression that none of these careers could ever be important enough for me to de vote all my time and energy to them. &amp; Back then, in 1971, devoting oneself to ceramics was not (is it now?) what was conventionally considered to be of any val ue, or even realistic. Much less if the project implied a fundamental interest in craftsmanship, as mine did in its initial stages. Many of my friends were disapproving, and failed to understand my decision. But my naíveté, ignorance or intuition told me that there was no reason I couldn't do the only thing I wanted to do: and that was to throw pots on a wheel. That was my main interest, and still is today. $ So from 1971 to 19731 attended the School of Design and Crafts (eda), which at the time was housed in the magnificent building at the Ciudadela in Mexico City. There I concentrated almost entirely on learning to use the wheel. Luckily for all the students in the workshop, Felipe Bárcenas was an insuperable (as well as insufferable, what with our incompetence) teacher when it came to showing us what the wheel was capable of producing. After those years that I spent in fascinated observation of his outstanding skill, I realize that although I have met a number of excel lent operators of potter's wheels in different parts of the world, I still believe Maestro Felipe's technique to be the most refined and elegant of them all. The lightness and perfection of his utilitarian shapes were an exam ple to follow, a model that influenced me profoundly, especially from the technical standpoint, for it soon be came apparent that I would also need to evolve cre atively in order to achieve what I had envisioned. 0 It was probably then that I decided I should distance my self from what study could offer, and came to the con clusion that choosing and decision-making are the keys to all development. The decision to produce ceramics was already a foregone conclusion, but I had to define —and still do—how to go about it, both on a day-to-day basis, regarding each of the pieces in progress, as well as in general: how to manage the studio, the pace at which I worked and the workplace itself. I had to de cide between professional independence or belonging to an institution. Through trial and error, whether one chooses to continue or to change one's course will depend on what seems right or will help achieve a de sired target. Naturally the idea is to avoid the undesir able. All this must be in function of a personal vision, or perhaps more accurately, intuition—which will often make the decisions unconsciously. 0 One of those significant decisions was that I should try to develop something personal that was also utilitarian. Of course, at the time that was impossible to visualize, but as a reference I had a few examples that I had found in books. I refer particularly to the work of Hans Coper— the Brancusi of twentieth-century ceramics who became a source of inspiration in a formal sense. But more im portantly, in my view, was Coper's attitude, his stature as an artist of ceramics: a potter-artist, inasmuch as he was perhaps the first to elevate the concept of pottei to the level of art in today's world. $ I must say there was nothing easy about my initiation during thi years in the Ciudadela. Actually, I was right to doubt my ability to master this trade that held me five. Because there wasn't the slightest indicate my development pointing to what one might natural ability for manual work. Neither drawii modeling had ever been subjects for which I had any special talent. On the contrary, I remember how 93 n Gustavo Pérez</page><page sequence="14">difficult I had found these subjects during my school years. Moreover, my first months in the eda were quite frankly frustrating, when I saw that several of my class mates were making better progress in operating the wheel. It took a lot of persistence and the conviction that this fundamental apprenticeship was essential. I believe that it was because of the way I began my ap prenticeship that I was able to comprehend how the craft itself is the backbone of my creative work, how craftsmanship has been the foundation for everything I've done. If that's not a gospel truth, at least it offers a valid, fertile and unlimited path. $ Today, it is clear that the development of art has reached a stage where the conceptual, the gaze and the reflection have in many cases transcended technique and craftsmanship. Many contemporary artists have come to rightfully base their creation on a radical questioning of all previous ideas about art. However, I think it's almost impossible for a ceramicist to adopt that position. For better or for worse—and I believe it's for the better—a ceramicist must continue to focus on his material, on his molding techniques, on proper drying, on applying slips and glaz es, and on the kiln, which always has the last word. In other words, on the craft. Our work—and this is some thing any ceramicist knows—demands constant atten tion as well as an ability to deal with frustration and fail ure. Someone once said that pottery is a horribly technical discipline. And it's true. The long complex process from the preparation of the clay to the piece that comes out of the kiln passes through such critical moments that at times, any positive results would appear to be mi raculous or a stroke of good fortune. 6s I believe that same good fortune, in perhaps a rather irrational form, has been at my side many times over the years. And here I'm not only referring to producing good pieces, but to all the circumstances surrounding this develop ment. It's obviously reasonable to assume that a per son gradually, and more or less consciously, forges his own career. But it's also reasonable to sense that there are certain fortuitous factors outside of his control (what some people call fate), and at a given moment, they can either mark a change of course, lead to a new phase, or favor the continuity of a difficult project. $ That's how I remember a long series of chance en counters, of periods of my life that I shared with others. The good fortune, for example, of my uncle Carlos Marin helping out with a kind of five-year scholarship at a workshop in Querétaro; or the year (1980) I spent at that strange studio in the garden of the old Hotel Ca sino de la Selva in Cuernavaca that was leased to me virtually free-of-charge through the intercession of my friend Ida Rodriguez Prampolini; or the invitation from ceramicist Johan van Loon to take his course at the Sint Joost Akademie in Breda, Holland; an invitation from the Benedictine monks of Sint Paulus Abdij in Oosterhoust, also in Holland, where I worked for one year in their beautiful workshop; and the invitation from Jorge Wilmot to work in his studio in Tonalá. More re cently, I have had the chance to work at Dauphine Scalbert's studio in Bourgogne, France. And now, af ter meeting Brigitte Pénicaud, we have made plans to work together, both in her studio in France, near Limo ges, and in my own studio in Zoncuantla. $ Of course, a special mention is-warranted for the eight pivotal years when the Vinaver family very generously allowed me the use of a workshop (El Tomate) on their ranch outside Xalapa on my return from Hol land, when the prospects of building my own were non-existent. The chance to have a space, which they considered from the outset as "Gus tavo's workshop," where I only had to pay for clay and gas to heat the kiln, and where I enjoyed total freedom, was momentous. I was able to concen trate on my work completely, as never before, because they were so sup portive in the early years that Georges himself bought several pieces from each firing. This would once have been called patronage; I call it enormous luck. £ Among all these pivotal chance encounters, I must mention the great support I received from Marcela Cao Romero during the seventeen years we shared. &amp; At each one of these stages, my work has undergone changes, at times gradual, at times drastic. I find it hard to define them all, but there are a few I can highlight. The decision to draw on paper is one of them. Without a clear idea of where this experiment would lead, and pure ly out of a desire to do so, I began drawing with the hope that one day I might find a way to apply it to my work in clay. The dozens, then hundreds, of notebooks that I filled with scribbles gradually began to make sense to me, even if they apparently had little to do with my ceramics. And yet the day came when I unconsciously began doodling, tracing a few lines on a discarded bowl with a knife. I noticed that the lines bore an obvious resem blance to several of the drawings. That was around 1989, in El Tomate. It was clearly a defining moment, because the scribbles suddenly made sense and gave my work a more personal touch. Especially once I discov ered I could fill those incisions with pigment (glaze) and leave the rest of the surface clean, with the color and texture of the clay, like a piece of paper bearing a sketch in India ink. 0 Shortly after, in 1990, this accidental techni cal discovery paved the way for what is perhaps my most well-known se ries: pieces in which the lines in the design open up like wounds to seem ingly reveal the piece's interior. The discovery of this effect (purely an effect, but one which highlights how malleable clay is) was, once again, acciden tal. But in the ten years it took to develop it, I unlocked many doors that allowed me, beginning in 1994, to show my work in galleries and museums around the world. I am amazed by the fact that a small discovery of an es sentially technical nature can define or re-define personal expression, but I suppose that since this discovery was made as part of a process of many years, it naturally added to and enhanced everything that came before it. At any rate, I see both its serendipitous appearance as well as its develop ment through the years as a gift from clay, a secret revealed to someone who has persisted in holding an endless dialogue with clay for so many years. "Clay needs lots of love," wrote Rilke, and I believe those words that have remained in my thoughts all these years to be irrefutable. Clay must not be used; it must be talked to, and loved, because clay knows how to respond and reciprocate. $ Since everything changes with time, I too had to abandon the comfortable assurance of those ten very fertile years. The sign to do so was a firing in which absolutely every piece came out well. That exceptional result, which might seem so positive, had the opposite effect on me. It was a sign that the development had reached a point of excessive and undesirable certainty. It was imperative to turn to something else, to do something new, to run the risk of failure—which is such a nec essary part of creativity. The only thing I retained was the use of the wheel, but I dropped everything else: the drawing with knives, the wound like effect, everything that had characterized my work from 1990 until that moment. For three years I concentrated on developing the form, attempt ing to take the possibilities of deforming turned pieces to an extreme, and began using glazes over the entire surface again. This process, which last ed until early 2004, was apparently a transition to a new synthesis, or at least that's how I see my most recent work. It is a return to the graphic type of surface treatment typical of the 1990s, but with a new, more complex, and maybe freer idea of the form. Anyway, it's uncharted territory I need to continue exploring, even if I am well aware that later on I shall have to switch to something else. At the present time I have no idea what that will be, but if I am lucky, it will appear at the right moment. ^ Translated by Carole Castelli # 94</page><page sequence="15">The Potter Bird Alberto Blanco Oh voices from the invisible party! Oh songs of unanimous celebration! Life is this: this is the auspicious season. Here in this place, freedom is for those who are able to see beyond names and closed forms. And creation itself sounds the alarm in the roots that are buried deep in the clay, the trunks, the bark and in the bronzed treetops where the potter bird blithely designs his ideograms with his whistle. Because, if the potter's tongue indeed exists, then there also exists a science of the pen, and a logic of the vessel and of flight. But there exists—as well—the earth and, more real than the tree itself surrounding the nest, the sky. Oh light of the perfect spiral! Oh so much to see everywhere!
