In subject, com- position, and mood these images could be models for the pastoral landscapes in- vented in Venice in the early sixteenth cen- tury, yet their status as details of interior wall decoration, their execution by work- shop craftsmen, and their indirect relation- ship to literary texts have excluded them from the genre.1 Indeed, neither literary critics nor art historians formulated a pas- toral category of landscape in antiquity. Yet the lack of a critical definition does not deny the existence of artistic precedents in a cultural tradition. Specific social and eco- nomic changes in central Italy in the first centuries b.c. and a.d. stimulated the rep- resentation of one type of landscape, the sacred grove, which in subject and compo- sition articulates the primary pastoral con- cerns of conflict and escape. Normally the term "pastoral" evokes rus- tic scenes, shepherds tending their flocks, a quiet place and peaceful mood. Recently, however, art historians have identified pas- toral not as a distinct subject matter and theme, but as certain compositional struc- tures or relationships of pictorial features that offer spectators "inviting occasions" for escape and reverie. Such structures posit a visible dialectic between nature and civilization. In painting of the twentieth century, pastoral structures may even tran- scend subject matter - pure form evokes a privileged spot, demarcated from the world at large. Pastoral space thus becomes meta- phorical, focusing on artifice itself.2 The inclusion of nonrepresentational space within the art historical category of pastoral painting indicates a growing con- cern to distinguish between mode and intent in discussions of pastoral and land- scape art. Leo Marx identifies as "pas- toralism" a persistent attitude throughout Western culture that has found expression in many modes and genres, while Denis Cosgrove argues that landscape art, includ- ing pastoral, along with maps and literary description, may be a manifestation of po- litical phenomena. 3 If these broad concepts accommodate the protean nature of pas- toral, they also raise questions about its parameters. How can the impulse for the creation of a landscape be distinguished from pastoralism? Through its artifice every landscape painting harbors that paradox essential to pastoral: one is both invited and detached while involved in a process that heightens awareness of one's station in the present world. Yet a pastoral landscape is more per- sistent in its challenge to the viewer; its emphatic internal conflicts make the very act of viewing conflict-ridden as well. Ac- cording to modern criteria, any representa- tion promoting this particular heightened response to art and nature qualifies as pastoral. 21</page><page sequence="3">In light of our expanded understanding of pastoral art, a réévaluation of Roman paint- ings is in order. Although the literary forms of ancient pastoralism, especially those of Theocritus and Virgil, are usually regarded as the heart of later revivals, the existence of an ancient visual tradition of pastoral has not been directly addressed. Perhaps wary of anachronistic projection, scholars focus on the bucolic motifs that abound in various media from the Augustan period. 4 A recent analysis of the various postclassi- cal theories of literary pastoral, however, led David Halperin to conclude that al- though there was no articulated concep- tion of pastoral in antiquity, an attitude compatible with modern concepts did exist. Halperin's four-point definition rec- ognizes pastoralism as a broad cultural phenomenon that may include ancient and modern, literary and visual modes: 1. Pastoral is the name commonly given to liter- ature about or pertaining to herdsmen and their activities in a country setting ; these activities are conventionally assumed to be three in num- ber: caring for the animals under their charge , singing or playing musical instruments, and making love. 2. Pastoral achieves significance by oppositions , by the set of contrasts, expressed or implied, which the values embodied in its world create with other ways of life. The most traditional contrast is between the little world of natural simplicity and the great world of civilization, power, statecraft, ordered society ; established codes of behavior, and artifice in general. 3. A different kind of contrast equally intimate to pastoral's manner of representation is that between a confused or conflict-ridden reality and the artistic depiction of it as comprehen- sible, meaningful, or harmonious. 4. A work which satisfies the requirements of any two of the three preceding points has ful- filled the necessary and sufficient conditions of pastoral. 5 Thus defined, a pastoral painting can range from a combination of bucolic fea- tures to certain structures of representa- tion. Although many Roman paintings of groves satisfy Halperin's first criterion in that they depict herdsmen caring for ani- mals, this activity is rarely their primary subject, for the figures and animals are, 22 BERGMANN like the rocks and trees, an intrinsic part of a larger setting. Instead the main focus of most scenes is a structure or a mythical moment that posits a series of oppositions between the natural and the human, "be- tween the little world of natural simplicity and . . . artifice in general/' as stated in Halperin's second criterion. In this simple dialectic Roman images of groves are com- parable to the "classical" pastoral paint- ings of art history. An even more compelling and un- explored aspect of Roman landscapes is Halperin's third criterion of a contrast "be- tween a confused or conflict-ridden reality and the artistic depiction of it as compre- hensible, meaningful, or harmonious." If one looks beyond the contents of each scene to its location on a painted wall, to its architectural milieu, and finally to its historical moment, the groves express a complex pastoral attitude, for their setting confers on them a meaning alien to their nature. In analyzing the Roman images, we must address the issue of ancient visuality, namely the modes of vision employed and differentiated by the Romans. In variety and kind, the pictorial structures of painted landscapes capture views that were ideal- ized by contemporary poets, villa owners, and geographers. While the remains of pri- vate estates attest to the popularity of such views, discussions about vision, nature, and territorial control reveal a deeper, met- aphorical meaning behind them. The con- fluence of these perceptual attitudes in the first centuries b.c. and a.d. produced a cre- ative moment of pastoralism, of which the groves painted on domestic walls are one expression. Pictorial Structures of the Sacred Grove Roman landscapes have traditionally been evaluated apart from their context, an ap- proach that is justified by the framing de- vices around many examples and by the ap- parent similarities of these landscapes to European oil paintings. Ironically this atti- tude has determined the present appear- ance of many of these works, which, cut from their settings in the eighteenth and</page><page sequence="4">nineteenth centuries, now hang in wooden frames on the white walls of the Museo Archeologico Nazionale, Naples. Yet these detached images of groves, as the following analysis will show, are coherent composi- tions in which pictorial structures, taken in conjunction with their decorative set- ting, may readily be identified as pastoral. In this discussion "grove" connotes a sa- cred space in nature where one or more trees, distinctive earth forms such as caves and boulders, and water in springs or brooks are designated - by a structure, by various votive objects, and by attendant figures- for veneration. Although most of- ten an inland setting is implied, a solitary tree or group of trees surrounded by the same buildings, objects, and figures may stand beside the shore or on an island. Like its actual historical counterpart, the painted grove contains structures erected at various stages in the development of a sanctuary (figs, i, 3-14). Monuments rang- ing from simple wooden frames to marble temples and ruins signal a grotto, tree, or spring as a sacred node. While the numi- nous ground is clearly circumscribed by a water channel, wall, or statues and objects marking the boundary, easy access to the sanctuary is implied in the bridges, por- ticoes, and paths that integrate the distinct areas and offer passage for shepherds, trav- elers, and worshippers. Once inside the precinct, flights of steps, prominent doors, and open windows invite one further into the heart of the sacred locus.6 In subject matter- resting shepherds, grazing flocks, and the still time they evoke- sacred groves offer the closest anal- ogies to pastoral painting of later periods. In context, however, the grove was one of several segments of the natural world depicted on walls, often appearing as a pendant to mythological landscapes or to contemporary architectural views. Recent analysis of Roman landscapes, which al- ways bear a human sign, shows that as a group they visualize contrasting attitudes toward nature. In many paintings, for in- stance, we observe the veneration and cultivation of natural inland sites (fig. 1), while in others, human technology tri- umphs over earth and sea (fig. 2). Each type of place recurs in a few basic schemes, re- gardless of scale, original placement, and quality of execution. While such schemes clearly reflect an efficient method of as- sembling ready-made pictorial units in the rapid technique of fresco and thereby con- firm that the images were not based on direct observation of the environment, their ideal structures represent a selection from and judgment about that environ- ment, and their repetition lends them the status of topoiJ That the pictorial structures of Roman landscape were meaningful, even meta- phorical, is evident in images of the grove. In its simplest scheme, monument and vegetation intersect in ways that bring lin- ear, historical time into the cycles of na- ture. A column, portal, or enclosure beside a prominent tree stands in the center of the image, set into relief by the sun,- worship- pers approach the vertical, rotational axis from both sides, completing a triangle and reinforcing the magnetic pull of the spot (figs. I, 3, 4). Significantly, the natural and constructed objects of worship - tree, statue, and monument - share the same ritual decoration of ribbons, shields, and crossed spears with torches and tablets lying at their bases. The two-columned portal, or szyzgia, enshrines either a statue (fig. 13) or the tree itself, which splits at the trunk to rise in two separate branches on either side of the frame (fig. 3). While in some scenes the tree may be shaped by pruning and pollarding, in others the col- umn matches the tree's diameter, appear- ing to merge with it (fig. 1), or the tree wraps itself around a marble shaft. Seen alone, the pictorial unit of tree and shrine provides the eye with a central focus. Transposed to a larger environment and set off against the topographical signs of a later, more developed age, the focus extends from the delicate, vertical shrine to massive forms of ports and cities. Thus in a small panel from Pompeii, a sacred portal forms the center of a balanced fore- ground scene, flanked on the left by a stooped figure before a large, gnarled tree and on the right by a statue of Priapus, a display of rustic piety that is set against an expanse of sea and a bird's-eye view of a distant, walled town (fig. 4). The contrast highlights the religious sphere, affirming a BERGMANN 23</page><page sequence="5">distinct order of relations while generating a sense of boundlessness and expanse. In other schemes, variations of color, scale, and descriptive detail render the grove al- ternately as inland or as maritime. Thus the columnar enclosure with tree appears on a rocky islet in a large, hilly sanctuary (fig. 5) and as a light and airy pavilion in sea scenes (fig. 6). Inland the eye travels to the horizon, passing over further similar groves, potential destinations; at sea it meets the urban signs of civilization that ultimately border and contain the sacred precinct. While the column, portal, and enclosure are usually modest, often of wood and ephemeral, in other schemes architecture becomes the main focus and the tree or other natural forms a secondary feature. Here the conflict is less between growth and artifice than between the barriers and entrances to the sacred place. The square, gabled structure, which dominates the fa- miliar rocky islet in either a freshwater or saltwater channel, invites by its steps, emphatic openings of wide doors, win- dows, and intercolumniations, while fig- ures move around its decorated walls (figs. 7, 8). Multiplied and set in a staggered row, the aedicular façade builds space by leading the eye, in stages, into a numinous realm (fig. 9). Significantly, the buildings' aper- tures function like solid geometric forms, defining space through their overlapping and progressive diminution. Such visual i.

The most massive building in the sa- cred precinct, the cylindrical enclosure or tower, manifests tension and contrast through its own ambiguous form. While its heavy masonry, turrets, and slit windows connote defense and protection, open door- ways decorated with ribbons or garlands and figures approaching the precinct via bridges and porticoes imply easy access and circulation (fig. 10). In some examples anachronistic forms fall into ruin. The walls of one enclosure are broken, reveal- ing the sacred column it once sheltered and thus the age of the sanctuary, while objects and worshipping figures indicate contin- uous veneration of the place (fig. n). Sim- ilarly the harbor-arm watchtower stands as a relic of defense in marked contrast to an open, monumental beachside chapel (fig. 12). Both inland and at the shore the ruined cylinder bears traces of the religi- ous and political processes that constitute change in the landscape. Ancient cults per- sist, and roots of piety lie deep, despite the changes brought by a new era of peace and urbanization.8 The set of contrasts contained within each pictorial structure of the grove is es- sentially pastoral. The interplay of monu- ment and vegetation and the fragility of the human edifice reveal a world of change: human expression of piety, the shrine, is transitory, while vegetation is in contin- uous renewal and human-made spaces shift center. Within these larger, intersect- ing temporal cycles, the figures, animals, and objects highlight ancient custom, his- torical continuity, and the successful ne- gotiation between humans and nature. Anthropomorphic and natural forces are protected, represented, elevated, and deco- rated, and members of the pantheon as- sume their proper place. Protecting the sacred zone are rustic statues of Priapus and Pan, seen beneath a tree, on a rock, a base, or a bridge (figs. 1, 4, 5, 14), while im- ages of male and female deities in gold, marble, and wood stand on pedestals, en- framed and worshipped beside monumen- tal trees and grottoes (figs. 1, 8, 13). 28 BERGMANN 10.

Author photograph Clearly the message of the painted groves does not concern a god but the hu- man acts and gestures of piety toward the numen, or wilderness, of nature. Small anonymous figures point at monuments, run over bridges or paths, or turn their backs to encourage active exploration of the sacred place. The worshipper enters a precinct and halts momentarily to gesture toward a shrine, indicating a transitory spot, perhaps a goal of pilgrimage. Women bend over altars in the moment of sacrifice. In these local, daily scenes ritual mollifies the wilderness, creating spots for sanctuary and rest. Thus the herdsman stays near en- closed, built settings, as cattle, goats, and sheep graze close by. Donkeys and oxen, common beasts of burden, are urged across a bridge or down a country road.

Author photograph BERGMANN 29</page><page sequence="11">The numinous power of the site emerges most emphatically during the narration of a mythical event, usually the climactic moment in a tale. In a large panel in the House of Polybios in Pompeii the sacred portal forms the pivotal center for four stages in the story of the punishment of Dirce (fig. 13). The scheme repeats that of non-narrative scenes: the shrine, elevated on an islet and surrounded by tiny offerings and goats, is flanked on the right by a gap- ing cavern and on the left by the distant view of a herdsman and his flock before an enclosure. The huge portal framing the statue of Dionysus dwarfs the event with its imposing sanctity. Like the worshippers and shepherds in the grove, the mythologi- cal characters underline the need for nego- tiation, through proper behavior, with na- ture and its gods. 9 In each mode, as in the actual ancient landscape, the grove represents one aspect of the environment that has been iso- lated for worship. A bounded space within boundless nature, it forms a focal point in the lives of shepherds and worshippers. When contrasted with the blocklike con- crete forms structuring earth and sea, the meaning of the grove resides in its being peripheral to the political centers, an inter- mediate zone between country and city and between nature and society. It is one of the astonishing achievements of Roman painters to have developed the means for conveying the impression of a diversified yet unified environment into which the spectator is offered visual entry. Geometric forms, the products of human reasoning, define the physical, tactile space, while plaster and pigment produce an impression of light and transience. Details add topo- graphical specificity. As the eye follows forms through this light-filled space, the sacred grove, characterized by its inclusive spatial structures and local features, as- sumes its meaning. Signaling exclusive- ness and refuge, the site is quintessentially liminal, a place and moment "in and out of time" where one can have direct experi- ence of the supernatural.10 In short, the pictorial structures of the grove describe the perennial agon of art and nature. Pastoral conflict occurs in the pres- ence of man in the grove. Yet through inno- 30 BERGMANN vative formal means, the painter extended the conflict to one between the sanctified spot and other, more urban realities. The viewer is meant to regard the grove as a segregated but intrinsic part of a larger domain. The conflict-ridden reality of the "little world" of nature worship and the civilizing harbors and cities, symbols of power and statecraft, becomes "com- prehensible, meaningful, or harmonious" through visual means. Signs of Piety and Pleasure What would the images of groves have con- noted to a Roman of the first centuries b.c. and a.D.? Surviving comments by contem- poraries emphasize the visibility of ancient groves and their role in moralizing debates about the status of Roman history and reli- gion. In contrast to the strain of nostalgia and cultural primitivism informing many such discussions, however, the scenes on 13.

Author photograph Roman walls do not recall an irretrievable past but celebrate the continuity of wor- ship. Signs of active ritual - building, dedi- cating, sacrificing - imbue the images with pietas and reaffirm the tradition and power ( auctoritas ) of ancient religious customs. The preservation of past cultural values shown in the paintings resolves a temporal and moral conflict between the natural locus and its wider, more modern domain. In our quick survey of pictorial groves it became clear that unified space was an ab- stract, conceptually meaningful construct and not, as is true for many later landscape paintings, an artist's translation of a spe- cific visual experience. Religious and social habits of perception shaped the Roman views of groves. The process of selecting from the natural world a sacred place, de- fining its perimeter, and marking it as dis- tinct requires an act of recognition. In Ro- man religion the high priest, or augur, scanned the land from a high spot, drew lines through it, took sight of certain land- marks, and spoke out their names. Repeat- edly in augural texts a landscape feature is referred to as signum, a sign selected to represent the place in a new, more mean- ingful context. Once the spot was defined, structures were erected to order the sacred space, direct sight and movement, and communicate with the divine. Since the Hellenistic period private individuals dedi- cated these buildings as a prayer and a me- morial to their fame.11 The paintings, com- posed by a selective and additive process, invite movement through a unified space, thereby recreating the process of visually appropriating holy terrain. The signal value of topographical fea- tures explains the character of Roman land- scape, for the features not only served as compelling visual cues in the countryside and on the shore but also functioned as words and as pictures, often simultane- ously as both. A key to the grove's multiva- lent meaning are those tablets frequently depicted propped on tree trunks or monu- ment bases (figs. 1, 12, 13). Such votive tab- lets were inscribed with epigrams, painted, or both inscribed and painted with the same features seen on frescoed walls. The rocks, buildings, and trees, whether in ver- bal or visual form, were directed at those approaching and recognizing the place as sacred. Inscriptions name, directly address, or personify these objects, allowing them to speak for themselves. In fact, the com- positional focus of most paintings, an ed- ifice surrounded by cult objects, corre- sponds to the integrated arrangements of sanctuaries, where an architectural epi- gram might be inscribed on the building itself or on a nearby statue, altar, or tablet pointed in its direction.12 Vitruvius, in his brief account of wall painting, explicitly stated that landscapes were composed of typical aspects selected BERGMANN 31</page><page sequence="13">from the visible world. Among these as- pects, which he called topia, he included the sacred grove or wood ( lucus ), holy places [fana), mountains [montes), rivers [flumine), springs [fon tes), flocks [pecora), and shepherds [pastores). Notably in his list the animated elements, flocks and shepherds, have topographical status, just as in paintings and epigrams such figures function as personifications or attributes of the place. Leaning on their staffs or against a wall, reclining under a tree or an awning, gazing from a bridge (figs, i, 4, 5), shepherds, worshippers, and wanderers epitomize a particular world and the activ- ities that it encourages and endorses. In re- ality these individuals often dedicated the inscriptions and very same objects and ani- mals depicted beside them. Among the nu- merous painted and verbal parallels are the scene of a herdsman leading a goat to a sac- rificial altar and an epigram describing the slaughter of an old goat on an altar to Pan (fig. 14). One inscription left by two rich landowners records the dedication of an image of a goat rather than its live counter- part. Indeed, a representation may substi- tute for the real thing because it is the act and the symbol of offering, acknowledged in verbal and visual form, that are to be remembered.1* Views of groves not only stirred senti- ments of piety but recalled the sensory pleasures such sites offered. Following the example of shepherds, wanderers, and wor- shippers, Latin poets expressed the high value they placed on cool, shady luci, singling out as particularly delightful the same elements, or topia, that appear in paintings and epigrams. A site invites and inspires; a source of pleasure, it is the clas- sic locus amoenus characterized by Virgil as possessing the topia of springs and woods, among which goats graze on the banks of the stream.^ The frequent warnings inscribed on the objects and natural features in groves rein- forced the value of the site. Epigrams from the third century b.c. protest the destruc- tion of trees, funerary gardens, and cult groves. Personified, trees implore travelers and their servants to leave the place in- tact and move on to another resting place where shade is more abundant and the 32 BERGMANN beauty greater.16 These messages inten- sified in the late republic and early empire, when a new wave of building increasingly threatened groves in Italy. The sacred sites were seen not just as relics of the past but also as playing an important role in defin- ing Rome's new religious identity. Thus in his periplus written in the Augustan period Strabo saw the few surviving groves, like the trees dedicated to Apollo at Actium and at Nicopolis, as landmarks of the new political structure. And in Campania, the context of most surviving paintings, ancient holy places became renowned, among them the tree of triple Hecate near Cuma, which provides a significant pa- rallel to scenes with an image of that goddess.1? While superficially the sight of an an- cient grove may have recalled historic change, for those sensing the spot as ani- mated by divinity the visual image could provoke a highly charged religious experi- ence. Instrumental in this revelatory pro- cess were the signs of previous human en- counters with the sacred. Ovid, referring to a grove of Juno above Falisci that was deco- rated with a simple altar and old-fashioned offerings of pious pilgrims, stressed that from its very appearance it was instantly recognized as numinous. Of the sacred Ari- cian grove he said that after putting pin- akes, or tablets, in place, women wrapped bands and ties on the trees. And a century later Athenaeus reported that when one saw a sacred spot he or she picked a flower and hung it on the shrine or the statues themselves. Like the epigrams and paint- ings, such poetic and historical comments dwell on telling landmarks of a place, just as augurs selected numinous signa from an expansive view.18 Evidence of decay and organic change was especially evocative in sanctuaries. Ancient descriptions tell how age and death in trees and weathering of human- made forms increased their value. Lucan's reference to a tall, dead, leafless oak that continued to be worshipped recalls the prominent stumps and bare branches de- picted in sacred zones (fig. 4). Propertius mentioned the deserta sacrarla that were left to be tended by country folk until Au- gustus' reforms: "But now the shrines lie</page><page sequence="14">neglected in deserted groves: piety is van- quished and all men worship gold." Mar- tial, observing a tomb on a Roman public road that had been cleaved by a wild fig tree, regretted that nature's disintegration spared no human monument, even if erected at vast cost and constantly tended. But if the flow of time triumphed over walls built by humans, the monument still survived the human lifespan. Thus Pliny the Elder wrote: "The earth makes us also sacred, even bearing our monuments and epitaphs and prolonging our name and ex- tending our memory against the shortness of time. "*9 Such comments express a new con- sciousness of the temporal dimensions of place. In fact it was in the first century b.c. that the word antiquitates first appeared in discourse about religion and the gods. Cicero noted that the art of the augurs was vanishing, that rituals had lost their mean- ing but were maintained because of their antiquity. Varro collected the foundation dates of temples, complaining that where once holy places had been now only streets bore their names, and that those remaining were confined to a smaller space. Cicero applauded Varro' s books and claimed that they had restored the city for him at a time when other Romans moved like strangers through the streets. Knowledge of the past provided a key to one's own identity.20 While the age of the grove was stressed, its current value was also defended, its meaning redefined for a new world in which traditional religion appeared to be coming to an end. According to Varro, true veneration of the gods did not take place in houses of stone containing statues, but in sacred groves without pictures. Lucretius told how all over the world shrines, lakes, groves, altars, and images of the gods were still held sacred, and Quintilian related how men revered groves more for their reli- gionem than for their beauty. Pliny, claim- ing that tree-worship was thriving in the late first century a.D., contrasted the mate- rial splendor of modern, organized religion with the simple shrines of the past: The riches of the earth ' s bounty were for a long time hidden , and the trees and forests were sup- posed to be the supreme gift bestowed on her by man. . . . trees were the temples of the deities , and in conformity with primitive ritual simple country places even now dedicate a tree of ex- ceptional height to a god ; nor do we pay greater worship to images shining with gold and ivory than to forests and to the very silences they contain.21 Groves painted on domestic walls affirm the status of nature cults and stress the continuity of worship that Varro nostal- gically desired. Yet they record not only an- tiquity but also progress, acculturation, and the broadening horizon of Roman vi- sion. A survey of the building types re- veals, along with a current Graeco-Roman vernacular, primitive (aniconic), and for- eign, especially Egyptian, features. Com- bining exotic and ancient, past and foreign customs, the cosmopolitan landscapes ex- pand sacred space geographically. Tempo- rally they evoke the variety of sites that would have been visible along the route of a procession, a staggered series of views that follow sequential stages of expan- sion and centralization within the sacred landscape.22 Considering the spatial and temporal range of the paintings, one should ask to which category the shepherd, the primary pastoral protagonist, belongs. It has been noticed that Roman images lack the signs of agricultural toil so prominent in con- temporary handbooks for the gentleman farmer. Instead they concur with fictional accounts of Rome's origins that stress the exclusively pastoral nature of the early city. But as with sacred groves, pasturage was highly valued in Italy in the first cen- turies b.c. and a.D. And cultivation, epi- grams tell us from the third century b.c. on, threatened the grove. Accordingly the paintings of quiet scenes with grazing sheep and cows omit any sign of danger from the plow; wool and meat accompany signs of piety, implying that peace with na- ture and the gods produces fertility and wealth. The shepherd, like the grove, was a poetic and topical symbol, bringing the value of the ancient and the rural into a modern milieu. 23 Images of groves, then, signal a recogni- tion of sacred space - initiated by the au- gur in siting landmarks, by the worshipper physically approaching a shrine, or by the reader of a dedicatory inscription carved on BERGMANN 33</page><page sequence="15">a tree, an edifice, or a tablet deposited at the place. Such traditions developed in the Hellenistic world but in the late republic became a vehicle of moralizing historicism that perpetuated the fiction of a pure rural religion as the heart of Rome's past. By the first century b.c., when landscapes were first painted on Roman walls, the changing historical perspective inspired contrasting topographies which, when shown as coex- istent, reminded the viewer of the presence of the past. The sacred grove did not belong to a distant golden age, but to an idealized current reality. Framing the Grove The evocation of sacred sites on Roman walls reveals an interest not in the grove per se but in a previous recognition and ar- ticulation of such places as sacred. Recre- ated in fresco, groves seen in views, votive tablets, and literary topoi become features of a new setting and thereby assume a new meaning. The implications of this fact for the viewing experience have rarely been explored. They are central to our under- standing of the pastoral nature of Roman landscapes. On Roman walls the sacred grove pro- vided a partial perspective, a penetrable fragment complex within itself, bounded yet unresolved within a highly activated framework. That framework is a study in surfaces, beginning with the actual layers of plaster and leading the eye through a col- orful display of simulated textures and overlapping planes. Painted, life-size arch- itecture separates into distinct zones with illusionistic openings. Modeled statues and panels, integrated into the receding setting, enhance the impression of spa- ciousness, an effect further heightened by color and the fictive activity of light. The grove must be understood as one as- pect of this dialectic between space and surface in which replication and transla- tion extend into multiple levels of illu- sion. Indeed the different spaces and styles of landscapes may refer to prototypes in wood, gold plate, stucco, and possibly in glass, papyrus, and tapestry as well. The eclectic designs are a natural result of the 34 BERGMANN 15.

In this larger framework- as in the single landscapes- linear and atmospheric perspective, light and shadow, and the interplay of color unify the discrete parts into a harmonious whole, inviting the viewer to apprehend a new associative network. The simple na- ture shrine, then, achieves significance in opposition to the material splendor of the human-made forms containing it. In each mode of wall design in the first centuries b.c. and a.d. the grove pre- sents an antithesis to the spectator's own space. 24 This occurs in various ways. The illusionistic prospect in the vertical center of the single wall, a privileged place that relates directly to the viewer's axis, oper- ates like a window by inviting one into a separate world (fig. 15). But the very key to its fiction, the believable corporeal forms of the foreground- usually a high socle or cultic objects placed strategically between the vista and the room- obstruct access to the desirable space. Separated by succes- sive layers of architectural illusion, the spectator regards but cannot enter the ideal arena. 25</page><page sequence="16">A still more subtle play of access and de- nial occurs in the miniaturized vignette placed in the center of a panel (fig. 16). The purest form of Roman landscape, the vi- gnette is the spatial unit from which all other landscapes build. Its relation to the surface reveals the layering process of fresco, and its composition, with the main axes of the scene parallel to those of the framework, binds elements to a geometri- cal coordinate system. But the vignette's intrinsic relation to the surface is decep- tive, for on approaching or focusing on the scene the viewer observes a conflict be- tween its internal geometry and surround- ing color so that the grove recedes into and projects from the wall in a movement con- trary to that of its frame.26 The illusionistic prospect and the minia- ture vignette charge the spectator with the task of gauging spatial relations while re- 1 6.

The use of invisible and thus immeasurable voids be- tween depicted objects and between the viewer and the scene blurs the line be- tween actual and painted space. Similarly, in another mode, a series of vignettes is scattered across a monochrome surface without a common horizon or reference point, so the eye oscillates between com- peting centers, combining the discrete scenes into a larger whole (fig. 17). The lack of static resolution or visual rest is espe- cially pronounced on the illusionistic yel- low panels of a side wall in the villa at Oplontis (fig. 18). Here illogically stacked views of sacred spots with trees towering over temples and tiny sacrificing figures confuse the effects of projection and reflec- tion, presenting the viewer with compet- ing and incompatible spatial realities. The ambiguous illusions animating the central section of the wall occur above eye level as well. In the horizontal ribbon of space running around the top of the room one might glimpse groves over a trompe l'oeil wall, follow miniature scenes across black, yellow, or red bands, or isolate small framed panels (pinakes) propped on the cornice. Again, each reading requires a dif- ferent perceptual process. The transparent vista raises the spectator to an impossible, elevated angle that contradicts the rules dictated by the painted architecture below. In monochromatic friezes the eye jour- neys laterally from object to object and for- ward and backward between close-up and distant views, building continuity and breadth in the landscape. The rhythmic shifts of this serial reading prevent the frieze from being taken in at one glance, effecting an optical experience like that of walking along a colonnade. The small pinakes, apparently straightforward in identity and thus initially accessible, also deceive in their interaction with the sur- rounding design. Set on a cornice, they af- firm their own weight in relation to that of the framework (fig. 19), but placed between the planes suggested by the painted super- structure, they cannot be resolved within the spectator's primary frame of reference (fig. 20). The distinct perceptual modes of land- scape, while primarily determined by BERGMANN 35</page><page sequence="17">the larger design, may also be explained by their intended reference. Views seen through columns or over cornices had sta- tus value in the Hellenistic world, connot- ing tourism and dominance through the ap- propriation of a chosen space. Similarly, portable panels depicting landscapes at- tained considerable value as gifts, as collec- tors' items, and as votive offerings and were often dedicated and hung in shrines of gods or in pinacothecae, buildings erected specifically for their display. The ambig- uous monochromatic surfaces of yellow, black, and red recall materials such as parchment, marble, and metal rather than the atmosphere and transitory effects of natural landscape.2? On Roman walls, however, each form of the grove presents the viewer with a para- dox by revealing features that negate its own illusion. Herein lies the fundamental difference between the ancient images and the European easel paintings of pastoral. Within the intricate constructs of wall de- signs, pastoral conflicts occur on a number of levels. The dialogue between nature and monument described in the individual pic- torial structure classifies the single scene as pastoral. Yet through its very representa- tion the grove becomes divorced from its original nature as a sphere of growth and change. Abstracted, codified, and trans- posed into two dimensions, the painted images embody an opposition of nature and artifice. When perceived within a new dec- orative framework, this conflict is ampli- fied into a clash between the natural scene and the overt materialism of the setting, an antithesis that is modified by the con- sistent color and lighting that join the parts into a coherent whole. Once again the grove is bounded by artifice- now together with its wider domain - and it assumes a new status among other signs of civiliza- tion and nature. As a result the viewer, who is centered within a fictive structural space and pulled between sensations of ac- cess and denial, perceives images of the grove in which others participate and wit- ness the sacred, but the viewer has no pure experience of the idyllic moment. Visually inviting, the grove allows little rapport with its viewer, leaving the sense of a spiri- tual gap. 36 BERGMANN 17.

Images of groves- made accessible through inviting spatial structures, yet detached and removed by a series of competing frames- make sense when considered in the wider architectural context, and particularly in the way actual groves were incorporated into and evoked by that context. The pastoral conflicts evi- dent in single images and in their relation to larger wall designs unfold in the over- lapping spaces of the domus, where the viewer's experience of inside and outside, art and nature, old and new, provides reso- lution. Indeed, Roman images of groves can only be understood as part of a shift- ing attitude toward the landscape that re- shaped domestic design.28 The current taste in building and paint- ing can be detected in Vitruvius' handbook of architecture written for the educated man of his time. According to Vitruvius, architecture should express the status of the patron or god for whom it was built. Just as the shrine conveyed the nature of the deity, the arrangement of the rooms of a house should correspond to the rank of each occupant. 29 Essential to maintaining decorum and a sense of hierarchy was the orientation of the viewer. Rooms should be sited with respect to the corners of the world, the times of day, the seasons, and the winds. The proportions of architectural elements should be adjusted for the host or guest of honor positioned at a certain spot. Archaeological evidence corroborates the priority given to the view in domestic de- sign. While the person standing at the threshold or lying on his kline was pre- sented with an overwhelming image that could be explored piecemeal, the moving viewer could enjoy multiple perspectives in porticoes designed both for the fleeting glance and protracted contemplation. 3° In short, the geometric frames of doors, windows, and columns functioned like the painted frames on walls, enhancing the continuum of experience by expanding ar- chitecture, admitting light and air, and leading the eye into deep shafts of space. 38 BERGMANN 21. View from entrance through atrium to peristyle, House of the Vettii, Pompeii (vi,i5/i); 79 a.d. Postcard photograph When one looked through a house along its central axis, solid walls and columns lim- ited the view, directing the gaze into the illuminated open space of the peristyle (fig. 21). Thus also in mural decoration the ap- parently real columns and podia of the fore- ground led into fictive apertures and de- picted landscapes (figs. 15, 16, 17). In each case architecture framed and isolated a spa- tial dimension, objectifying the external world for the chosen witness. Remarks by homeowners illuminate the artistry of view-making from the late re- public on. One topos that can be corrob-</page><page sequence="20">orated by extant remains describes the views seen through windows of a room as distinct landscapes. Pliny the Younger en- joyed the "three seas" captured in three windows of a room in his villa, while an- other room incorporated the contrasting spheres of sea, forest, and sky. The arrange- ment of windows in houses and villas built on the Bay of Naples in the first century a.D. reveals the popularity of multiple views in one space, where the spectators would have rotated their heads from one lively picture to another (fig. 22). If the large-scale painted architecture on walls corresponds to views within and outside the built interior, the individual landscapes set within the painted architecture are like outdoor prospects progressing from order to wilderness, materiality to atmosphere. Ancient viewers reported that in looking into the distance the eye jumped over sepa- rate buildings on hills and along water- ways, just as it does over the spatial units in scattered landscape compositions. 31 The desire to blur the line between vi- sion and representation, an impulse that shapes much of Roman painting, is clearest when real views become part of the deco- rative scheme. In the villa at Boscotre- case, painted landscapes were linked to the space of the room by a common light source, a door offering a view of the Bay of Naples, so that actual and depicted vistas formed pendants in the unified design. The implication of this decor- that an actual view is as much a translation of reality as a representation- was expressly stated by Romans, who noted that views through windows and reflections on water or on marble panels produce similar images in which objects emerge only indistinctly through diffused light. Again, such obser- vations of optical effects must have influ- enced the creation of paintings, for in many landscapes colors shift or fall back into the distance, fading into a light-gray, filmy mist where figures and objects appear as translucent shadows (figs. 7, 12, 14). 32 Pastoral, as we have defined it, involves a meaningful and harmonious representa- tion of a confused or conflict-ridden reality. The simple scenes of nature painted on walls and captured in windows and colon- nades manifest that conflict on a basic 22. View through windows of apse, second floor room, Mansion of Fabius Rufus, Pompeii (VII Insula Occi- dentalis 16-19), mid-first century a.d. Author photograph BERGMANN 39</page><page sequence="21">level of cognition. The initial perception of the landscape, its subsequent depiction, and its reception all involve mere images, reflections, or substitutes for the place, whose essence cannot be purely or directly grasped. This assumption underlies Pliny's comparison of a painting with a beautiful prospect seen from his villa. By equating a painting with a view, Pliny acknowledged the power and the artifice of vision and af- firmed the status of appearance, thereby calling reality into question. 33 The duality or tension apparent in the combined perspectives of Roman walls not only reveals an understanding of the nu- ances of optical activity but manifests a creative use of the shortcomings or decep- tions of vision. A debate in the first century b.c. focused on whether visual rays issued from the eye or from the object seen. Both theories assumed that vision involves an intersection between the eye and the exter- nal world. The form of this juncture was variously interpreted. Lucretius explained that our ability to perceive distance re- sulted from a series of films, or diaphanes, between the object and the eye. The more air that intervened, and the longer the air flowed through our eyeballs, the more re- mote was the object. 34 Such an explanation elucidates the basic principle of Roman ar- chitectural and pictorial design, in which layers of overlapping planes convey depth. Indeed, the play of space and surface on Roman walls articulates distinct dia- phanes, each of which is isolated and must be perceived separately in a process that expands space and, as Lucretius tells us, time as well. The activated wall with its projecting colors, receding forms, and land scapes oscillating between ambivalent planes taps the potential energy both in the object seen and in the viewing eye. By exploiting the gullible character of sight, an architect or painter could create illusions that placed viewers in the center of an ideal sphere, thereby empowering them. Cicero, in the midst of designing his villa, joked in a letter to Atticus about whether the source of the rays of vision should determine the size of his windows. Only in cases in which the rays emanate from the object, he argued, would it be nec- essary to enlarge the windows to accom- 40 BERGMANN modate the images entering from outside. In Roman houses, however, things outside did not have a life of their own; they existed only in the act of being seen. The spectator defined and oriented his world. Indeed, viewing became an act of funda- mental social significance, and views, like the artistic luxuries displayed in the home, lent the owner status. 35 One popular focus of painted and con- trived prospects in Roman homes was the grove. At the same time that Varro began documenting vanishing sites, proud own- ers boasted their own sacred trees, shrines, and cultic objects. Although the objects were robbed of their intended function, the votive flavor of the artifact, with its own history, increased its value. Single trees be- came as expensive as marble columns, and rural sanctuaries were recreated in peri- styles and backyards, as in the small House of the Moralist in Pompeii where a grove of Diana, the familiar setting in paintings identifiable by its tree, shrine, and statue of the goddess, formed a focal point for re- clining diners. Even the pious dedications of epigrams and votive pinakes resonated throughout house interiors; on one Pom- peian wall an echo of a Hellenistic epigram accompanies a painted scene of a fisher- man, hunter, and fowler making a dedica- tion to Pan.36 The closest three-dimensional counter- part to the unified and expansive land- scapes painted on interior walls was the luxury villa, a new phenomenon in the late republic and an arena charged with pastoral moments. In instances in which entire sanctuaries were absorbed into private es- tates, as with the archaic lucus Feroniae attached to the great villa of the Volusii, the possession of a space that by its very nature was immune to worldly values must have given the owner an elevated sense of power and grandeur. The sacred center became one focal point among many in his domain. Like the paintings, villas displayed a new kind of landscape both within their confines and in the views they "possessed. "37 The popularity of variegated views must be understood as part of a changing attitude toward the land, its parceling, its owner- ship, and its new historical and religious</page><page sequence="22">value. On the one hand, houses and villas connoted new wealth; on the other, they became symbols of regional and ancestral ties, which, like sacred groves, were cher- ished as the vanishing sites of ancient tra- dition^8 An agricultural owner himself, Varro articulated the current confusion of status with regard to private land: "Isn't this villa, which our ancestors built, sim- pler and better than that elaborate villa of yours?" To him the pastoral way of life with its vital connection to the land offered a link to the venerable past: How can that be a villa , if it has neither the furnishings of the city nor the appurtenances of the countryl . . . if your place is to be com- mended for its pasturage , and is rightly called a villa because cattle are fed and stabled there, for a like reason that also should have the name in which a large revenue is derived from pasturing. &amp; In singling out herdsmen, cattle, and other signs of agriculture as the necessary elements of a villa, Varro emphasized their current value. Ownership of ancient farm buildings, herds, and the lands that were grazed in different seasons was as desirable in the middle of the first century b.c. as were Hellenistic royal parks and pal- aces. Inland, Italians were called "rich in flocks," "rich in sheep," or simply "rich in herds"; at the seaside their fisheries pro- vided them with exotic fish. Agricultural and defensive buildings no longer in use became attractive garden structures. A villa's resident shepherds and fisherman bred small species solely for the luxury of the dinner table.*0 The new status of the rustic explains its popularity as a subject of representation. The possession of trees, shepherds, and an- tiquated wooden statues of nature deities affirmed the owner's nationalism and pi- etas. Varro claimed: "Why, your villa is plastered with paintings, not to speak of statues; while mine, though there is no trace of Lysippus or Antiphilus, has many a trace of the hoer and the shepherd," and Martial, in a kind of reverse snobbery, called the Priapus of an extremely wealthy owner on his little farm a "nobile . . . opus. "41 Again, the landscape paintings vi- sualize these topical contrasts, combining fashionable classical statues with simple rustic forms; while Priapus guards the grove, glittering statues are propped on pedestals and framed by wooden struc- tures (fig. 1). The elevated views in paintings recall the landowners' privileged perspectives, in which the sight of family tombs and honored old trees were a reminder of the owners' genetic ties, privately employed fishermen and shepherds of their self-suffi- ciency, and shrines and votives of the gods' protection of their proud possessions. Horace said that the happy man spent his days surveying his grazing herd and prun- ing his trees. And Pliny left the upper part of his villa open in order to survey his domus and watch the fishermen going about their duties. To some, the sight of sailors, shepherds, and fishermen at work conjured up an ideal of breeding and tra- dition. Varro claimed that getting along with them was a sign of an owner's hu- manitasA2 Descriptions of villa views repeatedly stress their amoenitas. Especially pleasing to look at and energizing for the senses was the sacred grove. 43 Roman owners clearly delighted in the structured, progressive vistas that imposed regularity on the land- scape. The same aesthetic informs Roman paintings, which counteract the transitory effects of nature and compensate for opti- cal weakness by bringing the distant and imperceptible into view. In regarding the harmonious scenes, the ancient spectator's status as a privileged, ordering agent was affirmed. The ideal landscape or "complete" villa could be created ex novo, as in the Domus Aurea of Nero, a country villa in the city. Here villages, woods, fields, and shepherds and their flocks were set on the shores of an artificial lake as a pendant to the monu- mental colonnades of the city. From his domus Nero enjoyed viewing the familiar topia of poetry and painting. One particu- larly potent Roman image of goats [pecora) scattered across a hillside betrays literary inspiration (figs. 1, 5, 13, 14). In an eclogue written in 41 b.c., the year of land assign- ment, Virgil describes the farm restored by Tityrus. The farmer sits in the shade among his streams, and gazes at goats that BERGMANN 41</page><page sequence="23">from a distance appear to hang on a hill- side. For Lucretius the same image served as a metaphor for the atomistic structure of the visible world. 44 The domestic setting, in sum, was a sphere of dialectical reconciliation, com- bining signs of old and new, foreign and indigenous, piety and luxury. In paintings, sacred groves adjoined palatial porticoes. In gardens, urban, rural, and exotic emblems combined in picturesque arrangements. And on expansive villa estates, as far as the eye could see, the visible landscape with its various constellations was unified by the privileged view. Thematically and vi- sually the grove pervaded the domus, in- vested, Varro informs us, with new values of ancient purity and modern wealth at a time of intense political and cultural up- heaval. Contrived appearance and sym- bolic association provided pastoral resolu- tion for the private owner, who was both witness to and agent of new formations in the landscape. Roman images of the grove have been con- sidered in light of broadening definitions of the pastoral. The impact of modern art and changes in art historical methodology have caused an erosion of old categories and cri- teria so that specific formats and represen- tational motifs have given way to more general principles. Thus an abstract paint- ing evoking a certain space and mood can be defined as pastoral. Furthermore, paint- ing must be recognized as one of many pos- sible forms of pastoral expression, which, along with music and literature, arises from a cultural movement called pastoral- ism. Essential to each mode of pastoral is a perceptible conflict between nature and 42 BERGMANN civilization. That conflict finds resolution through representation and reception. In its pictorial structures, which focus on a human-made form in nature, the Ro- man grove appears as a realm of harmony and contrast. Within the design of a room as a whole the opposition between the sa- cred spot and the overt materialism of its architectural framework is modified by such formal means as symmetry and color. Roman wall paintings indeed present com- pelling ensembles of nature and artifice, extending the pastoral conflict to the act of viewing itself. It should not come as a surprise that in- tense upheaval in Roman society of the late republic and early empire stimulated the creation of images embodying the basic pastoral conflict. At a time when its old meaning was in danger of being lost, the grove was one aspect of the visual world to be singled out by Romans and invested with new meaning. Its representation reg- isters an aesthetic response to dramatic changes in the ownership and structure of the land. Seen in isolation, the pious scene recalls a previous existence, stirring recog- nition of the inner meanings of Roman cul- ture and its religious core values. Within the design of the house the sacred node be- comes secularized and peripheral. In view- ing the painted walls, the Roman spectator glimpsed sweeping surveys of an ideal ter- rain where opposites were brought into concord, space was bounded, and time con- tained. Architecture mediated between the spectator's own mobility and a captured, static image of the world, challenging one to assess status- of the present, the past, the luxury object, sacred space, and ulti- mately of one's own relationship to nature.</page><page sequence="24">NOTES I am grateful to B.

Rostovtzeff, "Die hellenistisch-römische Archi- tekturlandschaft," Römische Mitteilungen 26 (1911), 1-185. Ancient wooden shrines became evocative symbols in public art of the Augustan period. Thus Salvatore Settis interprets the interior of the enclo- sure wall of the Ara Pacis, which is a translation into marble of a wooden countryside enclosure such as those seen in the paintings, as an allusion to the em- peror's religious revival: "Die Ara Pacis" in Kaiser Augustus und die Verlorene Republik [exh. cat., Mar- tin-Gropius Bau] (Berlin, 1988), 400-425. The earliest surviving representation of a grove is part of a contin- uous frieze running around the upper part of the atrium wall in the Villa of the Mysteries in Pompeii, identified as a representation of the Nile: Amadeo Maiuri, La Villa dei Misteri (Rome, 1931), 47, 200, 235; figs, il, 83-84.

At this time pasturage was conducted on private estates, in different parts of Italy under the supervi- sion of Rome, and by nomads living on the margins of society. Carmine Ampolo, "Rome archaïque: une so- ciété pastorale?" in Pastoral Economies in Classical Antiquity, Cambridge Philological Society, suppl. 14 (Cambridge, 1988), 120-133. 24. Most research on Roman landscapes has concen- trated on their place within the four chronological styles of wall painting proposed by August Mau a cen- tury ago, Geschichte der dekorativen Malerei in Pom- peji (Berlin, 1882). Although a firm date is essential to 44 BERGMANN</page><page sequence="26">any interpretation of historical material, this analysis considers groves on walls painted between 60 b.c. and a.D. 79 as a representative group. Interestingly, the basic schemes persist throughout this period despite major changes in overall wall design. 25. On the ambiguity of illusionistic apertures see Au- gust Mau, "Tafelbild oder Prospekt," Römische Mit- teilungen 18 (1903), 222-273. 26. The classic example of this format is the third- style frescoes from the Villa at Boscotrecase, which have been eloquently described by Peter von Blan- kenhagen and Christine Alexander, The Augustan Villa at Boscotrecase, with contributions by Joan R. Mertens and Christel Faltermeier (Mainz, 1990). Sev- eral panels have been restored at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York: Maxwell L. Anderson, "Pompeian Frescoes in the Metropolitan Museum of Art," Metropolitan Museum of Art Bulletin (Winter 1987-1988), 37-54. 27.

Kolloquium in Göttingen vom 5. bis 9 Juni 1974, ed. Paul Zanker ( Abhandlungen der Akademie der Wis- senschaften in Göttingen , Philologisch-Historische Klasse, 3d ser., 97 [1976]), 539-563. On pinakes see A. W. Van Buren, "Pinacothecae: With Especial Refer- ence to Pompeii," Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome 15 (1938), 70-81. Actual votive tablets were in use at the time the walls were painted: Horace, Carmina, 1.5.13-16. On the secularization of votive pinakes in the private house of the first century b.c. see Heidi Froning, Marmor-Schmuckreliefs mit grìechischen Mythen im i. Jh. v. Chr. (Mainz, 1981), 33-47; on their translation into paint on Roman walls see Eric M. Moormann, La pittura parietale romana come fonte di conoscenza per la scultura antica (As- sen/Maastricht, 1988), 36-39. On the fashion of cut- ting marble into thin slabs see Heinrich Drerup, Zum Ausstattungsluxus in der römischen Architektur (Münster, Westfalen, 1957); Pliny mentions that it was introduced into Rome in the first century b.c.: Natu- ralis historia 36.48-50. Clearly an important influence on the depicted spatial relationships was the function of the room, an aspect which has only recently begun to receive attention. See Strocka 1984; Alix Barbet, La peinture romaine (Paris, 1985); Andrew Wallace-Ha- drill, "The Social Structure of the Roman House," Papers of the British School at Rome 51 (1988), 43-97. 28.

For other passages on rooms with separate views see H. J. Van Dam, P. Papinius Statius : Silvae Book 2, A Commentary (Leiden, 1984), 239-240. From Cicero's Formianum, a "superior villa," one could see Ischia, Vesuvius, and Misenum over the por- ticoes stretching down the mountain slope to the beach of Baiae: O. E. Schmidt, Ciceros Villen (1899; Darmstadt, 1972), 28. Pliny's estates offered a number of staggered views over meadows or porticoes to the sea: E. Lefevre, "Plinius-Studien. Römische Baugesin- nung in der Landschaftsaffassung in den Villenbriefen (2, 1 7; 5, 6)," Gymnasium 84 (1977), 519-541. The orien- tation of extant villa remains shows similar visual goals; from the Villa dei Misteri in Pompeii one looked first to the gulf of Castellammare, then to the peninsula of Sorrento, ending at the isle of Capri. For a collection of these sources and others see Jutta Rö- mer, Naturästhetik der frühen römischen Kaiserzeit (Frankfurt, 1981). 32. For an isometric plan showing the series of painted rooms containing landscapes in Boscotrecase see An- derson 1987, 36. Lucretius, De rerum natura, 4. 130-139, trans. R. E. Latham (New York, 1979), 133: "the reflec- tions that we see in mirrors or in water or any pol- ished surface have the same appearance as actual ob- jects. They must therefore be composed of films given off by those objects." Statius compares the encrusted marbles to the views through windows in a Sorrentine villa: Statius, Silvae, 2.2.75-97. 33. Pliny the Younger, Epistulae, 5.6.13. An object and its representation were often regarded as indis- tinguishable: Raimund Daut, Imago: Untersuchungen zum Bildbegriff der Römer (Heidelberg, 1975).

Collection de l'Ecole française de Rome, 66, ed. Pierre Gros (Rome, 1983), 191-217. On trees as luxury items see Pliny, Naturalis historia, 17. i. For a venerable old plane tree in an estate as a metaphor for the elemental agon between earth and water see Statius, Silvae, 1.3.61-64. For a tree that symbolizes family tradition and continuity see Statius, Silvae, 5.3.50. Remains of trees within houses have been found; note especially the old chestnut tree that shaded the peristyle of the villa at Oplontis: Jashemski 1979, 290.
