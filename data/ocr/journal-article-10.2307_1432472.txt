<plain_text><page sequence="1">Opposing Oppositions: Turkish-German Questions in Contemporary German Studies Leslie A. Adelson Ohio State University Despite poststructuralist insights into the unstable nature of binary oppositions, there are those that abide in the arena of contemporary German Studies. Only the most recent in a series of terms designed to name and demarcate a literary phenomenon associated with authors of non-German origin living in Germany, the category of Migrantenliteratur perpetuates the notion that this body of literature is at best an expendable "enrichment" to "native" German literature.1 The raging debates over who should have the right to German citizenship pit the law of blood birth (ius sanguinis) against the law of territorial birth (ius soli).2 And with the firebombing murders in M6lln in November 1992 and in Solingen in May 1993 we have been confronted with an irreducibly fatal kind of opposition--between the living and the dead.3 In all three cases, Turkish residents of Germany figure prominently in both numerical and symbolic terms. Although Migrantenliteratur encompasses authors of many different nationalities, the phenomenon has come to be associated largely with Turkish authors in Germany who write or publish in German. Long recognized as the largest single group of so-called non-Germans dwelling in Germany, Turks have the most pressing practical claims to the German citizenship that is denied to most of them by law. And while violent attacks on "foreigners" have by no means been limited to Turks, the eight who died in M11ln and Solingen were all Turkish women and children.4 The Spiegel cover article that responded to the devastating news from Solingen characterizes German Turks as "Ikonen des Fremden--sie sind die perfekten anderen."5 Faruk Sen, Director of the Center for Turkish Studies at the University of Essen, would seem to agree. He is quoted in the same article as contending, "daB die Fremdenfeindlichkeit in Deutschland eine Tiirkenfeindlichkeit ist, weil sich die Aggressionen in erster Linie gegen Andersaussehende richten" (Spiegel 1993:17, italics mine). Thus we can see that Turks in Germany bear the force of academic, administrative, legal,</page><page sequence="2">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW and sometimes violent exclusion while they are at the same time appropriated for a kind of conflated, imaginary otherness. My purpose here is to challenge such Turkish-German oppositions and to ask what methodological alternatives a multiculturally oriented German Studies has to offer. My comments will address some of the shortcomings of intercultural Germanistik, historical constructions of both Turkish and German identity, and contemporary dilemmas of multicultural literary analysis. Eventually this will lead me to a discussion of Sten Nadolny's remarkable novel of 1990, Selim oder Die Gabe der Rede (Nadolny 1990). In the realm of contemporary German Studies, the institutional phenomenon most frequently associated with bridging the gaps of cultural difference is the Gesellschaftfiir interkulturelle Gennanistik. Founded in 1984 under the leadership of Alois Wierlacher at the University of Bayreuth, this society grew out of the recognition that Deutsch als Fremdsprache courses could not employ the same pedagogical methods in all countries or with all students without regard to their diverse cultural backgrounds.6 With the traditional hermeneutic categories of self and other as its base, interkulturelle Gennanistik has sought to promote understanding between cultures by addressing culturally specific perspectives that affect the reception of German literature abroad and by foreigners studying in Germany.7 The essays collected in PeterZimmermann's volume, 'Interkulturelle Germanistik' Diaolog der Kulturen auf Deutsch?, rigorously, at times scathingly, criticize what Zimmermann refers to as neocolonial attitudes and relationships cultivated under "the guise of cultural partnership" (Zimmermann 1989:18). While Zimmermann and his contributors do well to address the political and structural impediments to the transmission of cultural difference from an abstract self to an abstract other, there is yet another blind spot that renders intercultural Gennanistik incapable of meeting the challenges of increasingly multicultural German Studies. By stressing the communicability of difference and perpetuating a model that seeks to teach "them" how to understand "us," interkulturelle Germanistik feigns interest in literary text and cultural context but effectively privileges author and reader as fixed poles in a supposed exchange of meaning. This leaves it helpless to account for the various ways in which culture is propelled by the ongoing production and displacement of unstable differences. Nor can it account for the historical-political functions to which such slippage attains.8 For this we must turn to the practice of interdisciplinary cultural studies, which David Bathrick has described as "a permanent border action," "a theoretical strategy concerned with questions of power and cultural representation" (Bathrick 1992:322,325). Emphasizing the productive qualities of texts, which are no longer seen as discrete cultural artifacts but as open-ended discursive processes infused with sociality, cultural studies explore the production of culture as fundamentally hybrid, liminal, and performative (see especially 306</page><page sequence="3">Leslie A. Adelson Bhabha 1990). For Homi K. Bhabha the production of modern national identities is inherently intertwined with the production of cultural marginalities. "Cultural difference," he writes, "must not be understood as the free play of polarities and pluralities in the homogeneous empty time of the national community. It addresses the jarring of meanings and values generated in- between the variety and diversity associated with cultural plenitude; it represents the process of cultural interpretation formed in the perplexity of living in the disjunctive, liminal space of national society" (Bhabha 1990:312). This is useful for our discussion of Turkish-German relations, since it indicates that the production of marginal positions does not reinforce the supposedly fixed identity of a self so much as it reveals the fundamental ambivalence of identity. This holds for the identity of a given "self" as much as it does for the identity of a marginal "other." Henry Louis Gates, Jr., calling for a new turn in "'Ethnic and Minority' Studies" in the United States, promotes a similar approach to cultural studies. He submits "that the ritualized invocation of otherness is losing its capacity to engender new forms of knowledge and that the 'margin' may have exhausted its strategic value as a position from which to theorize the very antinomies that produced it as an object of study. Instead we must prepare to forgo the pleasures of ethnicist affirmation and routinized ressentiment in favor of rethinking the larger structures that constrain and enable our agency" (Gates 1992:299).9 Given such persuasive arguments, Homi K. Bhabha's invocation of an alternately silent and inarticulate Turkish "guestworker" in Germany is particularly startling (Bhabha adopts this figure from John Berger's A Seventh Man). Without exploring the production of this specific Turkish-German liminality, Bhabha's version of Berger's Turk in Germany becomes a trope for "the radical incommensurability of translation" (Bhabha 1990:317). This trope will come back to haunt us and beg to be undone-from a cultural studies perspective.'0 Let us return for a moment to Spiegel's response to the murders in Solingen and consider the graphic image selected for its cover story on "Die deutschen Turken: Opfer des Fremdenhasses" (Spiegel 1993). Superimposed against the striking backdrop of red and gold flames leaping high into a black night, a photographic image of a (presumably) Turkish woman, a (presumably) Turkish man, and two (presumably) Turkish children is cast only in shades of black and gray. At first glance the cover seems to convey concern for the young family surrounded by flames. Upon closer consideration the image demands to be read quite differently. Who or what is really in danger here? Rendered "non- German" by the graphic's color code, the members of this (presumably) Turkish family seem oblivious to the flames that rage about them. With bodies steadied for the camera rather than poised for flight, the adults look straight ahead, the children slightly off to the side. What burns behind them in this image are the colors of the German flag. How are we to understand this? Is German national 307</page><page sequence="4">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW security or identity in greater danger than this small group and the millions of German Turks it is supposed to represent? If so, is the German nation endangered by the presence of the Turks or the violence of the flames? The diagonal blue stripe across the lower left corner of the cover alerts us to yet another danger as it alerts us to another article, "AIDS: Uberleben mit dem Virus." Is this an unfortunate coincidence? The longer we scrutinize the total graphic image, the less certain we can be of its sympathy for the Turkish victims of German xenophobia. Casting the flames in the colors of the German flag in any case serves to link symbolically the depiction of Turks with the fate of the German nation. Long before there was a German or a Turkish nation, the loss of Byzantium to the Turks in 1453 provoked a major crisis of European thought. The man who was later to become Pope Pius II designated the defeat at Constantinople as Christianity's greatest disgrace and called for a new crusade to set things right again Soliin 1992:116).l1 The values of a Christian Europe were seen vanquished on territory that was considered part of Europe at the time. Drawing on the background of Europeans' Turkish fantasies since the late fifteenth century, Sargut Solqiin's discussion of multicultural literature in contemporary Germany expands the narrow, more common optic of "Germans vs. Turks" to address the shifting signifiers of Europe, Turkey, and Germany in the context of multivalent political vicissitudes. The post-unification "Pogromstimmung gegeniber den Nichtdeutschen" in Germany, as Solgiin puts it (1992:50), is viewed in terms of a long history in which European ideas of "Turkey" have responded to Europe's changing idea of itself (see also Senocak 1992:28-30 and 34-37 in this connection). Ascribing a certain kind of"Anti-Historie"-a dismissal of the Nazi past-to Germany's current interest in European unity, Sol61in points to an inversely proportionate interest on the part of Turkish migrants in documenting their own experience of German history Solciin 1992:51; see also 101 in this regard).12 Identifying the Western European ideology that sets "'Western freedom"' against "'Oriental despotism"' in the German Historikerstreit of the mid-1980s and in Germany's struggle to find its place in the new Europe, So61iin contends that German hostility to "foreigners" is "kein importiertes Problem, sondern eine offene Frage des nationalen Selbstverstandnisses" Soliin 1992:140; see also 9-10, 101, and 123). Since 1945, questions of (West) German national identity have been directed toward, as Micha Brumlik and Claus Leggewie phrase it, "Europa- gedanken und Westintegration."13 In this sense, post-unification deliberations about Germany's role in Europe, and its relationship to the European Community in particular, continue a debate that has its roots in the aftermath of World War II. Examined in this context, comments by prominent public figures in Germany on the role that Turkey should play in the European Community take an 308</page><page sequence="5">Leslie A. Adelson especially revealing turn. Arguing in 1989 against full membership for Turkey in the EC,14 one well-known German statesman depicts the problem in these terms: "Wir Europaer sind gemeinsam auf das Starkste von der auf dem Boden judeo-christlicher Tradition entstandener Kultur gepragt; die Tirken als weit iberwiegend muslimische Nation gehoren einem ganz anderen Kulturkreis an, der seine Heimat in Asien und Afrika hat, nicht aber in Europa" (italics mine). The same commentator warns that admitting Turkey into the EC could even lead to the political collapse of that organization. The person responsible for these views is not, as one might suspect, Franz Schonhuber-the founder of the right-wing Republikaner (who by the way has written a book on Turks [Schonhuber 1989])-but former chancellor Helmut Schmidt (Schmidt 1989). Three years later another distinguished public figure writes, "Wenn die Tiirkei ein Teil der Europaischen Gemeinschaft werden will, mu6 sie abstreifen, was noch an Asiatischem an ihr haftet" (italics mine). In reference to things "Asiatic" deemed incompatible with things "European" this commentator draws special attention to police brutality-as if this were an unknown phenomenon in the United States, Latin America, Africa, or even Europe itself (Nazi Germany as an obvious case in point). This is the voice of Die Zeit's Theo Sommer, espousing his views on Europe and Turkey after the end of the Cold War (Sommer 1992).15 The cultural traditions and foundational myths to which Schmidt and Sommer allude are clearly fueled by attitudes as old as the fall of Constantinople. The fact that Germany figures itself around 1990 as a European nation, in part, by figuring Turkey as a non-European one attests to the ongoing topicality of these cultural paradigms. (Turkish-German conflicts surrounding the Kurds and the Gulf War could also be seen in this light.)'6 The pervasiveness of these discursive models indicates furthermore that current debates as to whether the Federal Republic is or is not a de facto Einwanderungsland are-though important-not sufficient to enable rigorous analysis of how certain cultural positions are produced and sustained or challenged. There is a "Turkish" component to hybrid constructs of German national identity today that is not oppositional but performative. By the same token the Turkish nation, which was called into existence by Mustafa Kemal Atatiirk in 1923, would be unthinkable without a performative orientation toward Europe. Unlike Helmut Schmidt, The Economist -hardly known for radical views of any ilk - characterizes Turkey as more like Europe than not. Under the influence of the Greek and Roman empires "Turkey, alias Asia Minor and Anatolia," has been "politically, economically and culturally an extension of Europe" for two thirds of the last 2500 years (Economist 1991:1 7).17 Siuleyman Demirel seems to agree. Prior to becoming the President of Turkey last spring, the then prime minister expressed himself this way: "Die Tiirkei ist die europaische Bricke nach Zentralasien. Sie ist ein europaisches Land" (Gsteiger 1993a). There is, of course, a very long (but not specifically 309</page><page sequence="6">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW "Turkish") history that leads to this type of declaration.'8 Centuries before a nation of Turks would ever be conceived, the Ottoman Empire designated a dynastic government, of a diverse population, that saw itself as "heir and successor, in the direct line, of the great Islamic Empires of the past" (Lewis 1968:2). According to a Young Ottoman polemic, "Turk" was an ethnic term for Turcoman nomads or Turkish-speaking Anatolian peasants (see Lewis 1968:1; Evin 1983:24). Although Jewish refugees from Spain introduced book printing to the Ottoman Empire in the late fifteenth century, European influence on this Islamic realm in general tended to be minimal. The eighteenth century saw a slight change in this regard when Ottoman rulers began to emulate Frankish armies and European naval practices. In 1792 the Ottoman Sultan Selim III initiated the establishment of standing Ottoman embassies in major European capitals.19 As Bernard Lewis details in The Emergence of Modern Turkey, however, the French Revolution opened channels of informational exchange but excited no revolution of ideas in the Ottoman Empire (Lewis 1968:62-65).20 With the mid-nineteenth century came a more decisive shift in orientation as Ottoman bureaucrats ineffectively sought to adapt European legal, administrative, and educational practices to an Islamic society.21 In contrast to these reform-minded intellectuals, the Young Ottomans later demanded a constitutional parliamentary government, one that would at the same time uphold Islam as its foundational principle (Lewis 1968:172-73). By the late nineteenth century a separatist Turkish movement had begun to unfold that saw itself increasingly as secular and national as opposed to Islamic and Ottoman (Evin 1983:113). As Lewis remarks, "the question of whether the Muslim community or the Turkish nation was to be the basis of identity and focus of loyalty was one of the most hotly debated of the time" (1968:233). While earlier attempts to emulate Western Europe had been linked with efforts to salvage the empire (Lewis 1968:234; Evin 1983:180-81), these efforts were brought to a halt with World War I. Allied with Germany and Austria in that conflict, Istanbul was occupied by a British and French military administration in 1918 (Lewis 1968:240). In response to this and to the harsh Treaty of Sevres, which prompted a "national day of mourning" in Turkey (Lewis 1968:247), Mustafa Kemal Pasa succeeded in raising an army that ultimately secured Turkish independence. Having destroyed the political authority of the sultanate in 1922, Kemal was elected president of the republic in 1923, after which he rid the country of the Allied forces and, in an epochal turn, abolished the religious authority of the caliphate (Lewis 1968:257-64). Kemal must have appreciated the performative power of national identity, for he subsequently made the Gregorian calendar and the twenty-four-hour international clock the official keepers of Turkish time, tried to purge the lingua franca of Arabic and Persian (but not European) words and letters, and banned the Ottoman/North 310</page><page sequence="7">Leslie A. Adelson African fez in favor of the allegedly more civilized hat (see Lewis 1968:268, 271,434 and Holbrook 1994:20). Insisting on its political independence from the West, the Kemalist Republic defined and created itself as national, Westernized, and secular (Lewis 1968:484-85). For Kemal, as for many Turkish intellectuals of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, the progress of civilization meant the emulation of European civilization (Lewis 1968:268).22 Turkish national identity in the twentieth century cannot escape the hybridity of Turkish Europeanism. Integrally linked to the political trends that ultimately led to the founding of the Turkish nation are the literary movements that characterized the emergence and development of the Turkish novel (Evin 1983; Halman 1982; Stone 1'973). In Ahmet Evin's assessment, literary accomplishments in Europe "were not taken to be idiosyncratic of Western culture but viewed as being part of the general progress of civilization" (Evin 1983:15). The genre of the Turkish novel, which did not take shape until the late nineteenth century, was in this connection oriented toward French realism in particular and posed a clear challenge to traditional Ottoman literature (Evin 1983:11, 17).23 And yet, to say that Turkish national identity is characterized by the hybrid quality of Turkish Europeanism is not to say that being Turkish is the same as being European in the same way that, for example, Germany is European or England is European. In the same vein, the Turkish novel cannot be understood as a mimetic reproduction of French realism in Turkish garb. As Evin details, the Turkish novel took an imported form and transformed it with the stuff of a local tradition and the politics of a local agenda. To cite just one example, he notes that the historically determined sense of alienation associated with the rise of the European novel and the European bourgeoisie plays no role in the Turkish variant, which "began by defining the individual in terms of the community" (Evin 1983:179-80). Turkish literary modernism can thus be seen to draw on European as well as local traditions to counter the conventions of Ottoman aesthetics and society.24 The prose narrative of the Turkish novel emerges as an oppositional medium in what would become the making of the Turkish nation. The German prose narrative that concerns me here must also be considered in relation to literature's function as an oppositional performance. I am thinking not of the German novel's historical genesis as a genre but of its political role as the mask of public conscience in the first post-Holocaust Federal Republic of Germany. (The names Heinrich B6ll and Giinter Grass may stand metonymically for this function in the earlier postwar period.) Sten Nadolny's 1990 novel, Selim oder Die Gabe der Rede, which by most reviewers' accounts presents a panoramic view of the last twenty-five years of West German history, engages with the legacy of postwar German literary narrative in surprising and productive ways. Nadolny's work does not rely on direct intertextual allusions to an earlier phase 311</page><page sequence="8">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW of postwar German literature but probes instead the epistemological shortcomings of an altogether nonliterary form of German opposition to fascism: the student movement of the late 1960s and early 1970s. One may legitimately ask why this should be interesting enough to merit even a moment's attention. As one disgruntled critic has complained, the history of the student movement has been "schon x-mal serviert" (Steinert 1990). Weren't all the Studentenbewegung books by Peter Schneider, Nicolas Born, Karin Struck, Verena Stefan, Jochen Schimmang, and Uwe Timm enough? Do we really need another book about the 68ers? This is where Nadolny shifts course and encourages his readers to do the same. The two main characters in Nadolny's novel are Selim and Alexander, who first encounter each other on a German train heading north in 1965. A young Bundeswehr recruit who might otherwise be late returning to base, Alexander defies the stationmaster's orders not to board the Sonderzug that is carrying newly recruited Turkish laborers to their assigned destinations in Germany. One of Selim's traveling companions gestures to the young German to indicate that the sixth seat in their compartment is free. Alexander barely responds: "der Deutsche lachelte nur geistesabwesend und wandte den Kopf wieder weg" (44). When Omer physically taps Alexander into awareness, the German soldier greets the other men who now become his traveling companions as well and occupies the vacant seat. Alexander is an interloper here, albeit a reluctant one. The Turks' attempts to engage him in conversation fail, not for lack of a shared language, but because Alexander chooses at this point to maintain silence. He buries himself in his newspaper, which-as we later learn-contains coverage of the Auschwitz trials in progress in Frankfurt. This first encounter between Selim and Alexander is emblematic, for itjuxtaposes (or seems tojuxtapose) two kinds of silences that have both shaped and haunted West German public discourse in the postwar era. The first silence concerns German responses to the Nazi past and the Holocaust.2' This is a silence to which the text makes explicit reference, as when Alexander's narrating voice rejects a superficial, media-minded, confessional style of German self-criticism in this connection (319) or when Alexander responds to the stories he hears in Claude Lanzmann's film "Shoah," a kind of telling that Alexander characterizes as "das schwerste Erzahlen iiberhaupt" (415; see also 406,414). The second silence is that attributed to the large number of Turkish Gastarbeiter and their families who have played an increasingly important role in the German economy and public consciousness since Turkey and the Federal Republic signed their bilateral agreement regulating labor recruitment in 1961. This silence is also reflected in the text when Selim, Omer, Mevlut, Mesut, and Niyazi face their transition from clearly individuated Turkish citizens to something unfamiliar that Germany will soon make of them. One thing they all suspect as they begin their journey: "ab jetzt wirden sie fiir langere Zeit nicht 312</page><page sequence="9">Leslie A. Adelson mehr Ringer, Laufer, Friseure oder Bauern sein, sondern stille, auf Hilfe angewiesene Arbeiter von sehr weit her" (15). As Arlene Akiko Teraoka deftly demonstrates in a series of incisive articles, the representation of Turks in contemporary German literature tends to render them either silent or woefully inarticulate (see Teraoka 1987, 1989 and 1994).26 And as we have already seen, the "Turkish" trope that has entered the cultural studies arena via Homi K. Bhabha's influential essay on "DissemiNation" is that of "the radical incommensurability of translation" (Bhabha 1990:317).27 Posing a radical break with the trope of "Turkish" speechlessness, the Selim of Nadolny's novel is "das Genie des Erzahlens" (318). Although he begins his life in the text with no knowledge of the German language, he is depicted in lively exchange with his Turkish compatriots, who are either delightedly or begrudgingly enthralled by his remarkable gift for telling stories. When he is later motivated-against his initial inclinations-to learn German, he uses the foreign language with the same effect.28 His particular gift of speech is therefore an enduring personal characteristic that defies the tropic trap of speechlessness that might otherwise await him once he crosses into the realm of German discourse. This does not mean, however, that speechlessness is never attributed to him. As a welder in Korb, Selim is viewed this way by his German co-workers, who only gradually become conscious of their confusion about this Turk. "DaB er mit den meisten Werkzeugen langst umgehen konnte, begriffen die anderen erst allmahlich. Wer selbst nicht sonderlich gescheit war, hielt einen Sprachlosen stets fOr unwissend' (167, italics mine). Since we as readers do not experience Selim as speechless or even inarticulate, we are encouraged by the text to associate Selim somehow with knowledge. By this I do not mean to imply that this Turkish character functions as the "wise" foreigner from an "Oriental" land but, rather, that his figure functions in a way that raises important epistemological questions. This is further suggested by the other talent most frequently associated with Selim, who also happens to be a wrestling champion. The text links these two skills when we learn that Selim fears only dogs, "weil er mit denen weder ringen noch reden konnte" (21). Admiring Selim's conversational strategies in a bar, Alexander remarks: "was fur eine Hartnackigkeit, was fur eine unbeirrbare Umarmungstaktik-das war Ringen, kein Reden! Der Gegner sollte Freund werden und nicht mehr davonkommen" (275, italics mine). The fact that Selim is a champion in Greco-Roman-style wrestling and bears the name of an otherwise unremarkable sultan who established permanent Ottoman embassies in European capitals (Lewis 1968:61) may remind us that Selim's "Turkishness" is imbued from the outset with an element of Europeanism. In this sense it would be misleading (at best) to see in Selim, as one critic has blithely done, "the ambassador of an oral culture" representing "the Golden Age of verbal communication" (Manthey 1990). At this juncture certain interventions become necessary. The novel 313</page><page sequence="10">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW Selim addresses only particular kinds of silences, not all those that one might want or need to discuss with regard to German national history or its relationship to Turkish national history. The two national "silences" that Nadolny probes-those concerning Jews and Turks-are modes of discursive production that both invoke and suppress voices of the minority groups in question. In this sense these are not genuine silences but articulations that serve the effect of silencing. (Briegleb 1992:120 uses the term "Vermeidungsduktus" with reference to postwar German discourse about Jews.) While Nadolny seeks to undermine the insidious effects of such silencing mechanisms, there are other types of silences that have no voice at all, not even a distorted one, in this novel. With an eye to ethnic, national, or "racial" minorities in particular, one notes for example that Afro-Germans, Sinti, and Roma have as little a presence in post- Holocaust discourse in Germany as they do in Nadolny's novel. In a similarvein, the Europeanism that informs Selim's "Turkishness" is a highly selective one. Clearly the "privileged" Turk in Nadolny's narrative, Selim is not especially religious. His brooding counterpart is Mesut, a drug-dealing misanthrope who becomes a pious Muslim (with a secret, sordid past) upon his return to Turkey. Despite the fact that Islam has become, by different accounts, either the second or third largest religion in the Federal Republic (Hoffmeister and Tubach 1992:196 and Senocak 1992:76-84, especially 83), the affection that the text showers on Selim and withholds from Mesut seems to imply that secular Turks in Germany are acceptable while Islamic ones (or ones who might turn to Islam) are not. This strikes me as an only somewhat revised variation of the feud between a Christian Europe and an Islamic Turkey. Finally, mention must be made of yet another Holocaust, the one that claimed the lives of a million and a half Armenians while Turkish-Ottoman forces were allied with Germany in World War I (Lewis 1968:356-57). A champion of Greco-Roman-style wrestling, Selim stores his medals together with a portrait of Kemal Atatirk (85), a leading military officer later associated with those responsible for this genocide and subsequently known as the founding father of the Turkish Republic. Selim's Europeanized "Turkishness" thus bears the unarticulated taint of the Young Turks' bloodied hands in addition to the expressly and favorably articulated mark of Westernized secularism. The history and composition of Turkish society is infinitely more diverse and contested than Selim conveys (see Lewis 1968:354-57 for all too brief comments in this connection). The novel's performative interventions in contemporary German discourse are as selective as they are rich. Their richness, however, selectively engages the production of national discourse in Germany alone. The equally but differently hybrid production of national discourse in Turkey lies just beyond (but not outside) the parameters of this book.29 Questions abound: What exactly is the function of Selim's incredible gift of speech? Can we say that Selim speaks for the discursive silence of"Turks 314</page><page sequence="11">Leslie A. Adelson in Germany"? Can we say that he speaks for Germany's own silences in postwar, post-Holocaust history? If so, what is the function of his Turkish particularity? Does Selim speak with the voice of the truth? Are these even the right questions to ask? Given that the historical development of the Turkish novel was so oriented toward European narratives (Evin 1983), it is ironic that a German novel struggling to offer a panoramic view of the last twenty-five years of (West) German history endows a Turkish Gastarbeiter with the spirit and tools of a master storyteller. Storytelling itself figures as a local point of conflict in polemical accounts of Ottoman and Turkish literatures to the extent that oral minstrels from the countryside were seen to draw on Turkish folklore and speak pure Turkish while more professional storytellers entertained palace and urban dwellers with Arabic and Persian vocabulary (see Evin 1983:24,29- 30). To see Selim's brand of oral minstrelsy as a cipher for a specifically "Turkish" (prenational) particularity in an otherwise German narrative might well reproduce such Young Ottoman polemics.30 We cannot begin to approach these questions until we acknowledge Alexander's role in the construction of Selim as a genial raconteur, for the story of this masterful storyteller is told, not by Selim, but by Alexander, who is decidedly not a great storyteller. Unlike Selim, who dreams of owning a shipping fleet to rival that of Onassis, Alexander dreams of becoming not a great storyteller, but an influential rhetorician. To be sure, by the time Alexander succeeds financially due to his rhetoric classes for political leaders and corporate officers, he has lost this dream. Yet it is the leitmotifthat accompanies his development. Whereas Selim tells stories in order to learn about people- "Nur wer erzahlte, lerte die Menschen kennen" (131)-Alexander initially desires oratorical skills in order to intimidate old Nazis (18) and later realizes that rhetoric could help him convince people that world problems were under control (122). As an officer in training in the Bundeswehr he associates speech with arms (Bewaffinung). "Er wollte derjenige Offizier werden, der in der Bundeswehr fiir das Gesprich zustandig war" (101). Even at this stage, however, Alexander's critical desire for an antifascist military encounters an unsettling ambivalence within the Bundeswehr. The topic of Hitler as an orator arises one night before sleep falls. A fellow soldier's remarks are intended as the last word on the subject: "'Nach Hitler noch Redner werden zu wollen, so etwas kann ich mir nicht vorstellen'." Another bunkmate hears this: "'Ganz meiner Meinung', bekraftigte er und knipste das Licht aus, 'darin wird er immer der Gr6Bte bleiben"' (93).31 While he still has faith in speech as political resistance (Widerstand, 345), Alexander imagines Selim to be his teacher, "so etwas wie ein natirlicherLehrerfiirRhetorik"(8). This notion isstrengthenedin Alexander's mind by the equivalence he perceives between Selim and Selim's stories and between Selim and pure truth. Selim "selbst war immer, was er erzahlte" (231). "Alexander hatte das Gefiihl, daB sich bei diesem Mann das Zuhoren lohnte: aus 315</page><page sequence="12">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW ihm sprach, auf eine krause, umweghafte Art, die reine Wahrheit!" (231). This is a role, however, that Selim both implicitly and explicitly challenges.32 Distancing himself from his own part in a story that he hasjust told about German authorities in charge of foreigners, he explains: "Wieso, ich rege mich gar nicht auf... ich spiele doch nur, damit ihr das erleben k6nnt! Ich spiele Tiirke" (237, italics mine). On another occasion he directly challenges the truth content of a personal story that he had previously conveyed to Alexander (252). These allusions to the performative production of Selim's personae, some steered by Selim and some directed by Alexander, point to Selim's role as something more than a character. As the narrator informs us in one of his notes, "Selim ist eine Geschichte, die ich erzihlen will" (47). This indicates furthermore that Alexander too is more than a character in Nadolny's novel, for the narrator also tells Alexander's story-intertwined with but not identical to the story "Selim" that Alexander wants to tell. These relationships are rendered extremely complex by virtue of the fact that the narrating voice for these stories is Alexander's, albeit from a variety of perspectives as well as in different time frames. The structure of Nadolny's novel thus becomes, if not a "character," a crucially vital element of the text. Before either Selim's or Alexander's story begins as a more or less continuous narrative, we first encounter the narrator's "Vorspann" (7-9), which consists of two descriptive passages labeled 1965 and 1972, and four metanarrative notes from 1979, 1982, 1983, and 1988. The excerpt from 1982 tells us: "Beim Schreiben stellt sich heraus: er war ein Phantom. Ich habe ihn mehr erdacht als verstanden" (9). The one from 1988 raises open-ended questions: "Wer war dieser Selim, wer ist er, vor allem: wo? Wo treibt er sich herum, statt mir zu erzahlen?" (9). This excerpt introduces Selim as a series of questions rather than a representative cipher. Moreover, we are alerted to the fact that the genial storyteller is also characterized by silence. What might the nature of this silence be? The novel Selimn consists of four sections in addition to the Vorspann. The first section tracks Selim and Alexander leading separate lives in Germany from 1965 to 1967. Their second encounter, which occurs in Berlin and marks the turning point of conscious, reciprocal involvement, is the focus of the second section, which takes them into the early 1980s. The third section goes back in time to tell the story of Ayse, the daughter of one of Selim's earliest fellow Gastarbeiter who grows up to experience Germans' lethal indifference to the plight of Turks in Germany. In this same section the mystery of Selim's silence in the 1980s is explored while Alexander searches for his friend in Turkey. A "Letzte Notiz" from 1989 addresses Alexander's leavetaking and a "telling" crisis during his return flight. In all sections, the narrative flow of chronological events is interrupted by competing strands of narration and the narrator's occasionally self-critical ruminations from later points in time. Beginning 316</page><page sequence="13">Leslie A. Adelson around the middle of the second main section, the narrative and the metanarrative are further interrupted by short, staccato-style synopses of events that serve as sketchy bridges between more detailed narrative episodes. The first major section of the novel, which pursues Alexander and Selim before they become intricately involved in each other's lives in 1967, seems to be narrated with relative ease. The metanarrative entries that begin in 1980 serve primarily to heighten suspense and whet our appetite for more knowledge by alluding to Selim's arrest and incarceration. In the second longer section, on the other hand, the narrative sheds the illusion of coherence as well as the omniscience of authorship. This is the same segment in which Alexander opts for silence (274) and determines that rhetoric can no longer function as resistance (364). By the end of this section Alexander, as narrator, is uncertain whether he will be able to finish the novel without direct access to Selim. Nadolny seems to offer an easy-and familiar-explanation for this narrative distress by having his narrator characterize the student movement (which occupies a major portion of the second section) as a "Katastrophe der Kommunikation" (273). In 1981 the narrator notes: Mit 1968 immer noch nicht fertig. Vor allem wundert es mich, wie damals eines der fur mich wichtigsten Themen, die Frage meiner geistigen Verwandtschaft mit denen, die fir Hitler gearbeitet hatten, per 'Antifaschismus' unter den Tisch bef6rdert wurde. Man brauchte sich fur so etwas pl6tzlich nicht mehr zu interessieren, es war'durch die Ereignisse iiberholt,' wie bald auch die Nachdenklichkeit selbst. Ich nickte meist, zweifelnd, wuBte nicht so recht, lieB es mir gefallen, hoffte, daB die anderen recht hatten. (263)33 One critic for the Frankfurter Allgemeine expressly links the collapse of Nadolny's narrative to the failures of the student movement (Rub 1990). Sten Nadolny suggests another possible approach in an interview with Wolf Donner. On the need to discard the posture of omniscient narrator toward his Turkish subject, Nadolny remarks, "Ich konnte so anfangen, aber ich muBte das als illusionar, als mythologisierend entlarven" (Donner 1990). Where can these two approaches be seen to intersect? I suggest that the point of intersection is an epistemological concern with the historical silences that have attended Germany's postwar responses to cultural difference. Alexander is clearly haunted by a story he once heard on the radio of a young girl in the Warsaw Ghetto who had been caught smuggling potatoes. Her Nazi captor pronounces that he will allow her to live, but only as a cripple incapable of smuggling again; he proceeds to shoot her in the feet (83). Alexander is so haunted by this image - when he encounters the hated old Nazi who taught him Greek (17), when he spends his free time as a soldier reading 317</page><page sequence="14">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW a book on resistance (83)-that it becomes "'seine' wichtige Geschichte" (84), so "personal" that he shares it with only one other human being. This story from the Warsaw Ghetto becomes Alexander's path of access to the Shoah. "Unmenschlichkiet," the narrator insists, "ist weder durch grausige Beweise noch durch Zahlen schon fiihlbar. Sie wird es nur als Geschichte" (407).34 Although there are no Jewish characters in this novel, Alexander's troubled attraction to the student movement stems from his strongly felt but inarticulated opposition to National Socialism. By no means does this imply that the Turks in this work stand in for Jews in German discourse.35 When Alexander speaks in 1979 for over an hour to Selim about Nazi crimes and German guilt and confesses his fear that these things are being forgotten, Selim finally speaks: "Aber es gibt doch eine Fernsehserie dariiber" (35 2).36 No convenient cipher for difference that would lend itself to easy appropriation by Alexander's narrative, Selim is neither an expert on the function of projected and politicized differences in modern German history. As intertwined as Alexander's story is with Selim's, Selim's story is not the equivalent of Alexander's. Their stories are propelled by different histories, and yet they meet-in Germany. (At the same time we should note that Selim is not indifferent to issues of National Socialism. One of his heroes before he ever meets Alexander is a prewr German wrestling champion who was killed for refusing to salute Hitler.37 This, of course, does not necessarily reveal anything about Selim's awareness of anti-Semitism.)38 The intersection between Alexander's struggle with the history of the Third Reich and his relationship with Selim is structural rather than ideological. With reference to the mutual disinterest between Turks and Germans living in Germany in 1965, we read: "Man lebte noch in zwei verschiedenen Erdteilen, Europa und Asien. Man wollte das beibehalten. Es wirkte irgendwie beruhigend" (117). This epistemological divide is invoked again in 1980 in the thoughts of Ayse, the young Turkish woman who puts her life on the line to shatter what has become a cruel indifference on the part of Germans toward Turks living among them. "Die Deutschen gehen nicht auf die Tirken zu, vielleicht, weil sie denken, daB es sich nicht lohne: die geh6ren fur sie zur tiirkischen Geschichte, nicht zur deutschen" (380, italics mine). For Nadolny's narrator, however, Alexander's story is a hybrid one. Its liminality derives, at least in part, from the liminality of Selim's story, which Alexander as narrator can "touch," but which he can "know" only partially.39 One of the most intimate scenes in the novel recounts the moment when Alexander and Selim exchange their most "personal," foundational stories. Selim is privy to Alexander's story about the girl from the Warsaw Ghetto, and Alexander in turn learns of Selim's father's untimely death in a ferry accident, and of Selim's mother's ensuing breakdown (356-5 7). And yet, even this emotionally charged exchange does not yield the conflation of difference that one might associate with intercultural "understanding." Years later, a heated argument over the role of the military in Turkey drives a 318</page><page sequence="15">Leslie A. Adelson devastating wedge between the two friends, leaving both bitter and betrayed. Alexander's sense of betrayal is explicitly fueled by Selim's "Turkified" variation of Alexander's Warsaw Ghetto story, used to contend that the girl- or rather, a Turkish girl like her-had been "frei erfunden" (402). This brings us back to the value accorded to truth in Nadolny's narrative. We have already seen that Selim resists Alexander's initial desire to identify him as truth. In their last conversation together Selim challenges Alexander's foundational truth. This is not at odds with the multiperspectival view put forth by the novel. From the narrator we learn: "Auch Selim liebt die Wahrheit, aber er begegnet ihr als freier Mann. Wer die Wahrheit sklavisch dient, liebt sie nicht. Selim weiB, daB sie ungern personlich in Erscheinung tritt, sondern es vorzieht, sich von Abertausenden von Geschichten annahern zu lassen. Sie selbst steht amisiert daneben und sieht zu. Ihre Liebhaber wissen das" (418). This anthropomorphized view of truth coincides with Selim's motivating interest in people and the partial truths that they represent.40 To say that truths are partial, however, is not to say that they are mere fictions that do not matter or are without consequence.4 On the contrary, the narrator has this to say of his task: "Erzahlen hebt auf und tragt, es ibt zu diesem Zweck so etwas wie Gewalt aus, und also gibt es kein Erzahlen ohne Ver- antwortung" (413). When we are told "Selim ist eine Geschichte, die ich erzahlen will," we are also told "Selim ist einer, dem ich verpflichtet bin" (47). This is why, I would suggest, the narrator's recognition that he has created his own versions of Selim's "truth" is balanced by his realization that Selim does not consist only of Alexander's imaginary projections. For in addition to being the genial raconteur, Selim is also a man of action whose life exceeds the narrator's control. Moreover, his decisive actions revolve around matters of life and death. In one respect, this challenges a curious convention in several German and Turkish narratives of Turks in Germany. I am thinking here of the literary convention whereby an innocent Turk becomes a murder suspect in the actual or seeming death of a German.42 In the case of Selim we have a Turk who really does kill a German, a crime for which he is convicted, imprisoned, and eventually deported to Turkey. (The pimp shot by Selim had tried to prevent him from removing a young, drug-addicted German girl from his brothel. The text reveals that he spouted ethnic slurs against Turks and shot first.) Ultimately Selim cannot control his own narrative either: he succeeds neither in rescuing this daughter of a friend from an early demise nor in deflecting the legal consequences of his actions. Nadolny's novel pays homage to the character Selim by unraveling any claim to control over the story Selim. In a narrator's note from 1983 we read: "Was habe ich nicht alles iiber Selim geschrieben-und doch nichts begriffen!" (403). Commenting several years later on Alexander's frustrated efforts to find his friend in Turkey in order to reopen their lines of communication, which had 319</page><page sequence="16">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW been closed since their decisive argument, the narrator describes Alexander in pathetic terms. "Und jetzt war er als Tourist so recht komplett: er hatte Geld, Durchfall, schlechte Laune und von nichtseineAhnung" (447, italics mine). The narrative crisis that characterizes the third longer section in particular is, however, not so much about the loss of control as it is about the labor of grief. This is reflected in the fact that, of the three deaths that inform this section, two of them belong to Selim. (The third one belongs to Ayse, whose desperate attempt to alter the German public discourse on Turks has fatal consequences for her.) Selim's first death accounts for his extended silence in the wake of his dispute with Alexander. Together with his young son by a German woman Selim had on that very day set out by car in a frantic effort to reach his German friend before his plane departed for Europe; their accident is a fatal one. Although Alexander learns of Selim's actual death on his first day back in Turkey, he searches the country for him nonetheless and becomes deathly ill himself in the process. His fragile recuperation (from a defective heart) seems to coincide with the death that he fantasizes for Selim. In this instance a glorious sixtieth birthday party for Selim brings together some of the beloved, lost characters from other portions of the novel, including the girl on crutches, who is now an elderly woman. Love thrives in the stories that are shared. But even this fantasy must make some concession to reality. In this scenario, Selim and his son are killed while trying to cross a bridge in order to help ferry boat passengers endangered by a sudden storm. One could perhaps see in Alexander's fantasy of Selim's second death a glorification of Selim as heroic builder of bridges who dies on one too weak to carry him and his son.43 I see it as a narrative acknowledgment of the limited control that both Selim and Alexander have over their own stories. While alive, Selim makes some life choices according to what story he wants to be able to tell later on in life, but some crucial developments cannot be foreseen. And despite Alexander's personal remorse and tender fantasies of an aging, happy Selim even Alexander as narrator cannot keep Selim alive. The fact remains of course that the Turk Selim dies in this novel, not the German Alexander. In this Alexander ultimately recognizes his complicity-not in Selim's "actual" death but in Alexander's narrative appropriation of his life. "Schuld habe ich,ja: am Schreiben! Ich habe aus einem lebenden Menschen, der mir fast ein Bruder war, eine Romanfigur gemacht. Aber getotet habe ich ihn ebensowenig wie meinen eigenen Bruder vor vierzig Jahren (den ich, weil er mir das Reden voraus hatte, zur Holle wiinschte, ja, zur H6lle!). Was dem Leben meines Bruders ein Ende setzte, war aber nicht mein boser Gedanke, und was Selim t6tete, kein falsches Bild, kein Manuskript" (474). In addition to shattering his own illusion that he could control the story "Selim," the narrator also learns in dramatic ways that his knowledge of the character Selim could never be more than partial. He reveals a more radical 320</page><page sequence="17">Leslie A. Adelson 321 insight when he concludes, "Ich weiB iber mich nicht alles, das ist eine meiner Chancen" (497). Rather than projecting all the unknowables of cultural difference outside himself, Nadolny's narrator opens up within himself and within the text possibilities for epistemological discovery that could honor the hybridity of historical experience and personal "identity" (nonidentity might be a more appropriate term). Disagreeing with a German friend who wants to make a film entitled "'German Subjunctive"' about a Germany in which the Holocaust had never happened and Jews were considered just as German as "Bayern, Berliner Hugenotten und Sachsen," Alexander claims that it is merely a coincidence that Turks appear in his book (186-88). The narrative that Nadolny creates in Selirn oderDie Gabe derRede challenges the glibness of such oblivion. Whereas conventional periodization treats 1968 as a major turning point in the political and discursive history of the Federal Republic-because of the shreds it allegedly made of a veil of silence over German fascism-Selim posits an alternative periodization of the 1960s, one that does not simply reproduce a binary opposition between "Germans" and "Others" (be they Turks or Jews).44 In this sense, Nadolny's treatment of the Gastarbeiter thematic does not merely address a sociological trend in German postwar history. From the vantage point of the decade that culminated in German unification, it challenges the binary "oppositional" epistemological terms on which narrative constructions of that history have been founded. Shifting the focus from a German "us" and a Turkish "them" to the multivalent production of complex cultural positionalities,45 Nadolny offers a fresh (albeit still partial) perspective that seeks to approximate responsible narrative, one that acknowledges the power of discursive construction without being able fully to control it.46 In this respect the storyteller Selim speaks neither for "the Turks" in Germany nor for Germany's own silences vis-a-vis its past; the novel Seliin bespeaks the need to explore more productive ways of "knowing" the relationship between the two.47 Lecturing in Michigan in March 1992, the author Alev Tekinay asked if there were a future for Turkish literature in Germany.48 If we take Selim's challenge seriously, the search for authentic Turkish voices (often linked or even equated with an author's biographical origins) must yield to a broader, more probing exploration of the construction of Turkish-German questions in the production of German literature by "Turkish" and "German" authors alike.49 Many thanks to James A.

Giilistan Oztiirk (Solingen). Hiilya Geng (Solingen). and Saime Gene (Solingen). 4 Castles et al. 1984 note nearly a decade before M6lln and Solingen that Turks bear the brunt of growing racism in the Federal Republic. Spiegel 1993:18 cites several "fremdenfeindliche Aktionen" that have taken place in other German cities, noting that not much attention was paid to these incidents since no one died as a result of them. (The attacks in Hoyerswerda in September 1991 and in Rostock in August 1992 are counter- examples to this.) Describing some of these attacks in some detail, Spiegel comments that it was "reiner Zufall" that the victims escaped death. Reports of individual. isolated killings of "foreigners" have also been scattered throughout the last several years. Interested readers should consult Funke 1989 and 1993 and Leggewie 1993. 5 Spiegel 1993:17. Since no analysis is provided to shore up this contention, I cite it here for its symbolic value only. "See Wierlacher 1985 and 1987 as well as Wierlacher and Krusche 1990. Zimmermann 1989 presents an especially critical view of intercultural Gennanistik as practiced by members of the Gesellschaftfiir interkulturelle Germanistik. Krause et al. 1992 address the topic and practice of intercultural Germanistik without being strictly beholden to the positions held by the Gesellschaftfiir interkulturelle Germanistik. Si6liin 1992:63-98 surveys a related field, intercultural pedagogy. noting that a German section of the International Association for Intercultural Education was founded in 1985 (71). 7 At the "Crossing Borders" conference held at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, in October 1992 Ulker G6kberk addressed some of these issues in her presentation on "Difference and Dialogism in the Aesthetics of Exile." 8 Suhr 1992:118 briefly characterizes interkulturelle Genrnanistik as "more static" than cultural studies. 9 Compare Berman 1993 for a series of cultural studies essays in the German context. Ulker Gokberk uses a cultural studies approach to explore what she calls "a crisis of narration" in the practice of cultural studies itself. the paradox of an "abiding focus on the other and at the same time its rejection as a Western construct" (G6kberk 322</page><page sequence="19">Leslie A. Adelson 1991:144,145). With many debts to Tzvetan Todorov, who claims that "Otherness is never radical," and to Gilles Deleuze and Felix Guattari, who asked, "What Is A Minor Literature?." GOkberk nonetheless concludes her discussion of German Aus'indlerliteratur by confirming her faith in the communicability of diversities (G6kberk 1991:172). Weigel 1992 also appeals to Deleuze and Guattari's notion of a minor literature in her assessment of"Literatur der Fremde-Literatur in der Fremde" in Germany. an essay that clearly owes far more to cultural studies than to intercultural Germanistik. When she suggests. however, that the only way in which one could consider migrants' literature part of German literature would be to see the former as a kind of"fifth" national German literature (Weigel 1992:229), she inadvertently undermines her own theoretical agenda by privileging authors' origins over the textual production of politicized marginalities. Teraoka 1987, 1989, and 1994 provide consistently trenchant cultural studies analyses of the highly mediated production of "foreign," especially "Turkish" voices in contemporary German literature. '? Interestingly enough, John Berger's use of the third person singular pronoun vacillates between generic references to migrant workers in Europe and nonspecific references to individual workers of particular nationalities. The passage to which Bhabha refers does not necessarily invoke a specifically Turkish laborer. The "Turk" in this portion of Berger's text (1975:118) is produced when Bhabha reads him into it. ' Similar attitudes toward the Turks were shared by European rulers struggling against papal authority at the time. See Foerster 1963:43-50. European responses to the Ottoman siege of Vienna in 1683 also echo this sense of a "Turkish" crisis. 12 Slciin provides no information on the documentation center and "guestworker" museum to which he refers; Senocak 1992:64 mentions these plans with reference to the city of Essen. Despite S6oliin's insightful insistence on considering migrants' literature in the broader contexts of European and Turkish history and German literature. Solcfin's repeatedly stated faith in literature's emancipatory capacity "to individualize culture" (1992:49) remains oddly old-fashioned. See my review ofSein und Nichtsein in a forthcoming issue of German Quarterly. 13 See their article, "Konturen der Einwanderungsgesellschaft: Nationale Identitat, Multikulturalismus und 'Civil Society'," in Bade 1992:430-42 (here 433). 14 Since 1963 Turkey has been an associate member of the EC. Its efforts to attain full membership have to date been unsuccessful. 15 Despite virtually identical cultural paradigms in Schmidt's and Sommer's commentaries, Sommer is less eager to render his judgment against Turkey's admission to the EC absolute. The EC's continued exclusion of Turkey (as a full member) could provoke it, he contends. into a union with the six Turkic, Muslim republics that formerly belonged to the now defunct Soviet Union. For this reason Sommer argues, unlike Schmidt. in favor of keeping the EC door open for Turkey, encouraging all the while its increased orientation to the West. The Economist discusses the same crossroad ( 1991:5). It should be noted that Schmidt does not argue against Turkey's continued membership in NATO or its continued economic affiliation with the EC but only against its full membership in the EC. 6b On these conflicts see Gsteiger 1992 and Bertram 1993. 17 The Economist also contends that the danger of religious Islamic fundamentalism in present-day Turkey has been grossly exaggerated (1991:14). Sezer 1990 and Gsteiger 1993b assess this quite differently. 323</page><page sequence="20">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW 18 Lewis 1968:1 points out that Europeans authored the name "Turkey" for Turkish- speaking Anatolia in the twelfth century. 19 My information on the history of the Ottoman Empire is taken from Lewis 1968 (here especially 41-61). 20 See Holbrook 1994 for important challenges to the conscious and unconscious polemics of Turkish revolutionary politics and Orientalist histories of Turkey. 21 See Lewis 1968:76-127 on the Tanzinat (reform) movement. 22 See Mardin 1974 for important distinctions between Western culture and Western civilization in the Ottoman Empire. Mardin also points out that different groups pursued Westernization for widely divergent reasons. 23 See also Lewis 1968:439 on the Westernization of Turkish literature. 24 In addition to consulting Evin 1983, Halman 1982, Mardin 1974, Stone 1973. and Lewis 19681 am grateful to my colleague Victoria Holbrook of Ohio State University's Department of Near Eastern, Judaic and Hellenic Languages and Literatures for generously sharing her insights on Turkish literary modernism with me. Teraoka 1987:87 (n.26) makesbrief reference to thefact that the Turkish embrace ofEuropeanism was intended as a rejection of Arab(ic) elements associated with Ottomanism. One would also have to include Persian elements among those rejected in the modernist move, especially as they related to the literature of the Ottoman Empire (see Evin 1983). 25 For a critical overview of this and related issues see Briegleb 1992. 26 Ever attentive to the agency of the Turks being represented, Teraoka explores in illuminating detail the institutional and narrative production of divergent "Turkish" discourses in Germany. 27 This should not be equated with silence or inarticulateness per se, since this "radical incommensurability of translation" arises in a social context in which meaning is distorted by racism. 2s Selim is motivated to learn German largely by his desire to meet women and to outdo Mesut, his pessimistic fellow whose proficiency in German soon outstrips that of all the other Turkish laborers. Selim does not express an interest in "understanding" German culture. 29 See Holbrook 1994 for a rigorous, pathbreaking analysis of hybrid, orientalizing discourses of Ottoman and Turkish culture in the turn toward Turkish nationalism and modernity. Dagmar C. G. Lorenz is one of the few scholars to examine one of the few German novels to address the Armenian Holocaust, Edgar Hilsenrath's Das Miircheni vom letzten Gedanken (1989). According to Lorenz 1992:270-75, Hilsenrath explicitly compares Armenians and Jews, idealizes the victims, and condemns the Turks. A detailed comparison of Hilsenrath's text and Nadolny's Selim remains to be done. Hilsenrath's linkage between Armenians and Jews is an especially interesting one. given that the Nazis officially declared Armenians to be Aryans (Shaw 1993:27). (This is of course a declaration for which the Armenians cannot be held responsible.) 30 Once again I am indebted to Victoria Holbrook for alerting me to traces of orientalizing polemics about "Turkishness" that inform many of the historical sources in English that were available to me for this study. In an anthropological vein Michael Taussig's Mimesis and Alteiity posits the act of storytelling as a "mimetic faculty taking us bodily into alterity" (Taussig 1993:40). This would be another argument against seeing Selim as a self-sufficient cipher for Turkish particularity. 31 The fact that Alexander's Greek teacher after the war is also a former Nazi Party 324</page><page sequence="21">Leslie A. Adelson functionary further underscores a certain linkage between rhetoric and the dangers of National Socialism. 32 Alexander himself modifies this assessment of Selim as a medium of pure truth. The passage that refers to him as a "Genie des Erzahlens" also designates him a genius of deception (318). 33 In this connection see Briegleb 1992:120 on the student movement rhetoric as it relates to the "Vermeidungsduktus" of conservatives. 34 Additional, more directly "personal" ties between Alexander and the history of the Third Reich concern his father, who was sent to certain death at the front for "unsoldierly" criticisms of Hitler (41 206), and his brother, who was killed shortly after the war when he stumbled on a live mine while playing (29, 41). Alexander himself becomes a conscientious objector (238). 35 It might make more sense to view the operative dynamic here as one of displacement (not to be confused with "replacement") as discussed in Chapter 4 of Adelson 1993. Brumlik 1991 presents historical arguments against the discursive transference implied in the slogan, "the Turks are the Jews of today." In a separate, unrelated article entitled "Zur rationalen Losung von Kulturkonflikten" (Kiesel and Wolf-Almanasreh 1991:17- 27), Micha Brumlik cites a passage from Selim to illustrate an encounter between divergent world views (19-20). On Turkey's important role in helping Turkish and European Jews escape genocidal Nazi policies, see Shaw 1993. 36 The reference is to the television program, Holocaust. See Huyssen 1980 on "The Politics of Identification" in this connection. 37 There are three references to Werner Seelenbinder in the novel (24, 165, 240). 38 Senocak 1992:20 notes that postwar Germany's separation from its own history had consequences for its immigrants as well: "Das erleichterte es nicht nur den Deutschen, die eigene Geschichte zu vergessen, sondern auch dem Einwanderer, eine Auseinandersetzung mit eben dieser Geschichte zu vermeiden." 39Senocak 1992:14 also invokes the word beriihren when he discusses the need for a new concept of identity that could address the situation of Turks in Germany. He argues quite persuasively for the inadequacy of existing analytical categories in this regard. 40 See 414 for another example of this. Nadolny's approach to partial truths reminds me of Angelika Bammer's theoretical elaborations on "partial visions" as both incomplete and partisan (Bammer 1991). Alexander's final crisis in the airplane underscores the notion that some "truths" are lifethreatening and hence that not all truths are equally valorized (see 494-96 for the episode in question). Nadolny's specifically feminized anthropomorphism vis-a-vis "truth" points to the issue of gender difference. This merits further scrutiny, as do the functional "silences" of the three main female characters in the novel - Gisela, Genevieve, and Ayse. It occurs to me that one might argue that the women in this novel are accorded too little room or else that they are given too much. While we are given comparatively minimal information about the women in the novel (with the possible exception of Ayse), I cannot help but wonder if the frequent references to female absences and silences serve to confirm Alexander and Selim's heterosexuality in a text that delves into the intimate, homosocial bond between the two protagonists. (I allude of course to Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick's use of the term in Between Men and Epistemology of the Closet.) 41 On this theoretical issue see Chapter 1 of Adelson 1993. 325</page><page sequence="22">GERMAN STUDIES REVIEW 42 Discussing Gastarbeiterliteratur, Teraoka 1987:82 mentions the Turkish figures' responses to "the instant suspicion of their criminality when they are accused of murdering a man who has only fainted." Soliin 1992:25-29 discusses a related motif in Aras Oren's detective novel, Bitte nix Polizei (1981). Riemann 1990:13 cites a similar incident in a story by Ozdemir Basargan ("Der Tote atmete noch"). Simpson 1993 discusses Hiilya Ozkan's short story, "Randale und Liebe." Doris D6rrie's film version of Jakob Arjouni's 1985 detective novel, both entitled "Happy Birthday, Tiirke!," involves a Turkish private investigator who becomes a murder suspect himself. 43 There are several fantastic as well as descriptive references to bridges that Selim built, sometimes under extremely hazardous working conditions. On one of these bridges in Germany someone later sprays the hostile graffito, "'Tiirken raus"' (258). 44 With reference to rhetorical devices used to address "the Jewish problem" in official postwar German public discourse, Briegleb 1992:118-19 scrutinizes the effect of erasing differences between Germans and Jews as one that diverts attention away from German murders to German shame. 45 See Adelson 1993 for an extensive elaboration of this term. 46 Nadolny's historically cognizant sense of narrative responsibility is reflected in his choice not to try to erase the murderous "difference" that Jews suffered under the Nazis. See Briegleb 1992 for a similar treatment of this "discursive" problem. 47 The extraordinarily incisive essays contained in Senocak 1992 represent a crucial intervention in the discussion of these historical anddiscursive issues. Without pretending to have fixed answers to all the provocative questions that he raises, Senocak makes a brilliantly compelling case for the need to rethink the premises of all the approaches with which scholars and politicians have heretofore sought to address the situation of Turks in Germany. He is one of the first publicists to recognize that existing categories of analysis are completely inadequate to this task. 48 1 am grateful for Tekinay's kind permission to cite from her unpublished lecture, "Auslanderliteratur in Deutschland, dargestellt am Beispiel der Literatur von Tiirken" (presented at the University of Michigan on March 23, 1992). 49 The political issue of which authors are published and marketed by which publishing houses under what circumstances makes it clear of course that these constructions are not merely textual in nature.
