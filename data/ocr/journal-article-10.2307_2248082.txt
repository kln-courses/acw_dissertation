Comte Domet de Vorges, 'L'abstraction Scolastique,' in reply to M. Bernies's strictures in the March number, admits that the intellectus agens is not revealed by con- sciousness; it is argued from that principle of scholastic metaphysics which everywhere distinguishes acbive principle and suibject-matter; the subject-matter of an abstract idea being a sensation, which is a likeness of its object, and the active principle being no other than the intellect us agens. By le mathematisme, which, says X. Moisant, is characteristic of inodern philosophy, is meant depersonalisation, as appears by these words: "To divide where one should merely distinguish, and then set side by side elements arbitrarily cut asunder, such is the method of the associationists; separating thought from the thinking subject, and con- sidering thought as a term definite and complete in itself, they ignore its natural prolongation into a substantial ego where it has its root, and treat it as a unity, apt to be added to other unities to form a sum, which they call the ego; this enables them to boast of nowhere finding in their analysis any substantial reality; it enables them to define the ego as a collection of thoughts, emotions, volitions, desires; a succession of con- scious states; a flux, or bundle, of sensations and impulses ". Further, enforcing the limitations of the province of physics, P. Duhm maintains this thesis: " A physical theory is not an explanation; it is a system or mathematical propositions, deduced from a small number of principles, the aim of which is to represent as simply, completely, and exactly as possible, a collection of experimental laws ". P. Vignon, ' Sur le Materialisme Scientifique,' alleges the fact of mimicry in animal de- velopment as an argument against the antiteleological mechanism of M. le Dante. In the June number, P. Duhem's, 'La theorie physique,' is a paper for every student of physics to consider. The aim of physical science is not to tell what things are, but how they behave: it is to register neatly and predict accurately the course of phenomena. A physical theory is an abstract and condensed representation of natural phenomena. Thus it is the business of Mechanics to describe as com-</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 135 pletely and simply as possible the movements that take place in nature. The physical student may, and continually does, do more than this; he produces a theory of the constitution of matter, or of the innermost nature of electricity; but in so doing he outruns physics and turns meta- physician. There is an interesting compte rendu of Dr. Dubois's Les psychon6vroses, advocating the moral treatment of nervous diseases; also of Dr. Sollier's Les Phgnomrenes d'Autoscopie, i.e., of corporeal visions of one's own person, whether of outward contour or of inward configuration, as of brain or skeleton; also an account of De Wulf's Introduction a la, Philosophie Neoscolastique, which proclaims St. Thomas Aquinas the only possible rival to Kant, admitting that he needs modernising, and showing how he should be modernised. In defending his thesis for his doctorate at the Catholic Institute of Toulouse, "of the logical connexions of metaphysics with dogma," M. Labeyrie protests against the reduction of all philosophy to psychology. REVUE DE MfETAPHYSIQUE ET DE MORALE. 12e Annee, No. 5. Sep- tember, 1904. L. Brunschvicg.

But the approach will be quite sufficiently near to make life as we know it impossible. There is nothing peculiarly pessimistic in looking forward to this eventuality as. certain. If life is on the whole a bad thing its cessation will be an un- mixed gain. If it is better than nothing, that it should have ever existed, even for a limited period, is so much to the good.

The subjects are characterised in detail; the range of topics covered is wide, and the results are submitted to careful evaluation, qualitative and quantitative.

Piecemeal learning has the disadvantages of disturbance of context, the formation of inhibitory associations, poor memorisation of transitions, forgetfulness of sections already learned with consequent unpleasant feelings, mechanisation of learning without realisation of the sense, unequal concentration of attention with consequent liability to distraction, unequal distribution of the repetitions, and finally uncertain reproduction and weak retention. The only disadvantage of learning by wholes is that the extent of the material makes a greater drain upon the attention, and thus leads more easily to mental fatigue. The author sought to control the fatigue-effects by specially devised experiments, and promises a future paper on this subject.] E. Durr.

In this case, a posse ad esse valet illatio, because His idea is that of a necessary Being-of One that cannot not be. Such a notion is absurd-or if not absurd, God really exists, since what must exist exists in reality, unless 'what must exist' includes self-contradiction.] Von Holtum. ' Das Angenehme und das Gute.' [If pleasure is good, what is pleasurable is only good relatively, in so far as it causes pleasure: but wbat is absolutely good must cause pleasure. Some pleasurable things may then be evil in a sense, and cause pleasure only on account of an abnormal disposition of body or mind, proceeding from suggestion, sub- servience to the opinions of others, undue subjectivism, or morbid state, or custom.] Endres. ' Otlohs von St. Emmeram Verhaltnis zu den freien Kuinsten.' [This is the first of two articles describing the work of an early mediieval thinker on behalf of the study of the liberal arts.] Lauer. 'Die Gewissenslehre Alberts des Grosses.' [A statement in two papers of Albert the Great's theory of Cognition, which in its main lines follows that of the majority of Schoolmen.] RIvIsTA FILOSOFICA. Anno vi., Vol. vii., Fasc. iii., May-June, 1904. C. Cantoni. 'L'AprioritA dello spazio nella Dottrina Critica di Kant.' fKant is right in teaching that we know the properties of space a priori, if such knowledge is understood in a logical, not in a psychological sense. That is, what we first learn by gradual experience afterwards acquires a certainty which reason alone can give. He is less happy in treating space as a purely formal and subjective element of perception. One fails to see how two factors differing so radically in their origin and nature as Kant's " form " and " matter " could ever unite in a living whole.] E. Sacchi. ' L'Immoralismo di Nietzsche giudicato da A. Fouillee.' [Nietz- sche is of no account as a philosopher, and his ideas are not original; but</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHICAL PERIODICALS. 141 he will live for ever as a writer and a poet.] A. Piazzi. 'Ancora sulla. LibertA degli Studi nella Scuola Media.' [A polemic of merely personal interest.] E. Juvalta. 'La dottrina delle due Etiche di H. Spencer.- Parte iii. ed ultima.' [Spencer is right in taking the conception of an ideally perfect society as the ethical standard. But his system is vitiated, by three great errors: (1) defining the absolute end of conduct as pleasure;; (2) identifying the constitution of the ideal society with the limit of evo- lution which has no limit; (3) perpetuating the injustices of an economical- regime where inequalities of social position, independent of personal merit, are only maintained by force.] Rassegna Bibliografica, etc. Anno vi., vol. vii., Fasc. iv., September-October, 1904. G. Zuccante. 'Sul concetto del bene in Socrate a proposito del suo asserito utilitarismo.' [Xenophon's reports of the Socratic conversations are quite trustworthy, but none of them need be interpreted in the sense of utilitarianism; nor is the Pro- tagoras of Plato really utilitarian. All such dialogues must be read in connexion with more unequivocal expressions of opinion and interpreted by them.] A. Gropalli. ' La funzione pratica della filosofia del diritto." [Chiefly occupied with explaining the contradictory views held by different Italian schools of jurisprudence as to whether it should be a theoretical science only, or aim at the guidance of future legislation.] G. Tarozzi.. ' Per lo studio della famiglia.' [The history of the family presents a pro- gressive transference to moral control of what had before been a subject of legal control, and a continuous creation of new responsibilities and duties. The good of the family is an end in itself, and should by no means be subordinated to the good of the state.] E. Sacchi. ' Le religioni posi- tive e la religione dello spirito secondo Sabatier.' [Sabatier's religion of the spirit is a beautiful but utopian conception. It would neither have done the work of the early Church nor does it meet the exigencies of: modern civilisation.] Rassegna Bibliografica, etc.</page></plain_text>
