<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARTICLES EVOLUTIONARY PHYSIOGNOMY AND DARWIN'S EXPRESSION OF THE EMOTIONS Rosemary Jann George Mason University Although endowing humankind with a genealogical relationship to animals was perhaps the most disturbing aspect of evolutionary theory for the popular imagination of the nineteenth century, we should remember that this genealogy revised rather than invented a tradition of animal/human resemblance that was by then centuries old. Since the time of Aristotle, physiognomical conventions and the schematization of nature as a great chain of being implicitly acknowledged a continuum between animals and humans that remained available to be explicitly biologized by evolutionary theory. Physiognomy helped reshape the grounds for alleging human superiority in response to successive underminings of the fixed categories that traditionally guaranteed the essentially conservative force of this continuum. If physiognomic tradition concerning animals and human beings was forced to respond to the revelations of comparative anatomy and evolutionary theory, at the same time its imaginative power also helped mold scientific theorizing about human descent to serve the continuing demand for teleological reassurance and provided an important basis for the biologizing of social and racial difference that was one significant outcome of evolutionary theory in the Victorian period. Despite his explicit rejection of the claims of popular physiognomy, Darwin's own evolutionary interpretation of facial expression in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals (1872) and elsewhere shared much common ground with them. The power of that popular tradition is demonstrated by its role in accommodating the more unsettling implications of Darwinian theory to a reassuring vision of purposeful social and biological order that lasted well into the twentieth century. Victorian Review 18.2 (Winter 1992)</page><page sequence="2">2 Victorian Review Victorian thinking about animal/human resemblance was the legacy of centuries-old physiognomical conventions as much as of eighteenth-century innovations in biological theory. The idea that animals and humans submitted to the same physiognomical "laws" was at least as old as the third century, BC, when de Physiognomica, conventionally attributed to Aristotle, had used animals as the central demonstration of its key principles, that the body was a mirror of the soul and that all character traits issued in physical signs of their presence. The result was usually a thoroughly moralized and gendered reading of animal character that projected into their faces a physical verification of the traits assigned to them by popular tradition. The Greek tradition might hold that humans alone possessed a rational or intellectual soul or had an upright posture, but they were still but superior animals whose characters could be read in the bodily signs that they shared with brutes (Thomas 30-35). Thus the large-minded man, like a lion, could be recognized by his broad forehead and well-proportioned body, and, in what would later become a common strategy, hair and skin color was taken to reveal the "natural" inferiority of non-white races.1 The Christian reworking of classical tradition promoted man to a qualitatively different status from beasts, which in some Renaissance theorizing entailed absolute physiological differences as well (Thomas 32). Yet such claims did little to undermine the popular credibility of animal physiognomy, or the assumption that humans could or did come to resemble animals whose moral traits they shared. Giambattista della Porta systematized such resemblances in his 1622 Fisonom?a naturale, and Charles LeBrun gave them striking, if somewhat fanciful, pictorial form several years later [fig. I].2 Notwithstanding analogies in the ways men and beasts revealed their intrinsic character in their facial proportions,3 LeBrun generally followed medieval convention in reading brutish features as a sign of moral degeneration. So long as physical degeneration to animal form could be considered the punishment for moral lapses, humanity's unique spiritual status was protected from the threat of physiognomic levelling. Maintaining the Christian dichotomy between animals and humans required that the linkage between them operate in only one direction, with human spirituality constituting an absolute boundary that animals could never transgress. Yet allowing both a place on a single physiognomic scale rendered this boundary at least logically permeable and made the later deconstruction of that dichotomy possible. A similar ambiguity was also implicit in the other major paradigm for structuring animal/human resemblance. The hierarchical structure of the great chain of being was tacitly destabilized by the principles of continuity and gradation, which, if taken literally, meant that human beings were separated from creatures below them by only infinitesimal differences, even if they were not consanguineous. Here too, racial difference played an important role in</page><page sequence="3">rosemary Jann 3 human physiognomy from LeBrun Reproduced courtesy of the Library of Congress</page><page sequence="4">4 Victorian Review mediating the gap between human and animal. As Lovejoy points out, the most damaging implications of gradation and continuity could be evaded by a reassertion of social hierarchy?by stressing, for instance, the great range of intellect between the highest and lowest "races." So long as it was the Hottentot, and not the Newton, who was but a step away from the animals, the vanity of the civilized European was shielded from the most threatening implications of gradation (Lovejoy 195-97). Positioning the socially marginal?women, infants, the poor, the mad?closest to animals similarly reified existing hierarchies (Thomas 43; Bynum 120). Although the regrouping of the animal world into different branches by eighteenth-century naturalists such as Cuvier and Lamarck undermined the chain's strict linearity and determinism, it did not resolve the underlying tensions between stasis and gradation, and between hierarchy and continuity, that were the legacy of both the chain and physiognomical tradition. As the increasing appreciation of the physiological similarities between humans and beasts threatened to transform continuity into biological relationship, the traditional guarantees of human uniqueness?speech and spirituality?became less comforting.4 Stronger claims required new formulations of humanity's physiological uniqueness, such as Cuvier's, which (following Blumenbach) placed man in a different order (Bimanes, or two-handed) to distinguish him from four-footed apes and monkeys (Quadrumanes). Cuvier's further classification of Bimanes and Quadrumanes by the shape of their skulls and the prognathism of their jaws suggests how physiognomic distinctions could help adapt older typologies to new scientific evidence by positing physiological manifestations of humanity's assumed intellectual and spiritual superiority, most influentially in the various theories of facial angle promulgated in the eighteenth century. Cuvier's own version of facial angle, which stressed the relative prominence of the sensual face in animals, as opposed to the development of the cranium?the seat of will and intellect?in humans, was offered as a reply to rival theorist Petrus Camper.5 Arguing that the angle formed by the intersection of lines drawn from the forehead to the teeth and from the middle of the nose to the middle of the ear was always less than seventy degrees for animals and always above eighty degrees for humans, and approached or even surpassed the perpendicular for the ideal Greek head [fig. 2], Camper reconstructed the great chain to accommodate physiognomy and comparative anatomy in a satisfying visual quantification of humanity's superiority to apes as well as European superiority to "savages." Like Camper and Cuvier,6 Charles White also conceived animal and human realms as structured in parallel hierarchies in his 1799 Account of the Regular Gradations in Man and Different Animals and Vegetables . . ., with lesser races, like lesser animals, identified by their sharper facial angles [fig. 3].

White's balancing act was typical. After further tracing simian likenesses in the size, shape, and textures of the African body (White 41-3), he resorted to polygenism, the theory that each race constituted a separately created species, for a compromise position that allowed him to claim that the African rose above brute creation while still evading "the degrading notion" that all humanity had descended from one pair (125).7 An increasing concern to preserve physiological grounds for human uniqueness distinguished the two most influential sources for Victorian physiognomical thinking, the work of Johann Caspar Lavater and Sir Charles Bell. The bible of nineteenth-century physiognomy, Lavater's often reprinted Essays on Physiognomy (1775) similarly employed facial angle as a sign of God's hierarchical structuring of the physical world from the frog to the Apollo [figs. 4-5]. Lavater, however, took seriously the materialist implications of the chain, and went to great lengths (as had Camper in his own History of the Orang-outang, 1779) to insist that absolute physical differences ruled out the possibility of apes ever "attaining" a human level of development. His mainly circular arguments, which proved the monkey's obvious intellectual and spiritual inferiority from his lack of such human features as eyebrows, lips, chin, or forehead, foreshadowed both the fears and the responses evoked by the increasing appreciation of biological similarity in the coming decades (Lavater 227-31). Bell's 1807 Anatomy and Philosophy of Expression expressed concern about the way Camper's facial angle seemed to place animals and humans on the same scale. His demonstration that animal physiognomy was actually shaped by function owed much to eighteenth-century gains in understanding animal morphology and physiology, but its ultimate goal was to discredit the ancients' "unjust and dangerous theory" (Bell 132) that physical resemblance to animals implicated humans in brute nature. Arguing that the organs and facial musculature of beasts were shaped by their different ways of catching and consuming food proved to Bell that only artistic exaggeration and "fancy" made it seem that humans truly resembled animals, since they manifestly did not share in such behaviors. Bell updated earlier physiognomical claims by tying humankind's presumed intellectual and spiritual superiority to our allegedly unique musculature. He argued, for instance, that animals lacked muscles for lifting the eyebrows (as had LeBrun), and for shaping the lips (Bell 126-27), and sought similar evidence of divine design in the fact that only humans could produce the blush that was "one of many sources of sympathy which bind us together" (Bell 88-89). Perhaps sensing the instability of compromises like White's, Bell simply refused "to grant that any</page><page sequence="8">-?K ^ ^ ^^ Fig. 4: Development of facial angle from frog to Apollo, from Lavater Reproduced courtesy of the State Library of Virginia</page><page sequence="9">Rosemary Jann 9 |5?^ ?s^k mm ?0J \$J Fig. 5: Development of facial features from frog to Apollo, from Lavater Reproduced courtesy of the State Library of Virginia</page><page sequence="10">10 Victorian Review measurable deficiency" marked the head of the savage, thus admitting no qualification to his humanity (Bell 67). Early Victorian physiognomists and phrenologists were uniquely positioned to bridge the gap between older systems of natural theology and newer manifestations of scientific naturalism. As Mary Cowling documents, they could claim scientific respectability by virtue of their purportedly inductive investigation of structure and function, while reproducing a traditional symbolic system of divinely intended meanings (Cowling 9-11). Phrenology's elaborate classification schema particularly appealed to the Victorian belief that human knowledge was inherently cohesive and systemic (de Giustino 35). Constructing the system of differences that it claimed to interpret, physiognomical interpretation played an important role in naturalizing those status differences of greatest ideological importance to Victorian society.8 Roger Cooter, who notes phrenology's important pre Darwinian role in mediating "the lay application of scientific naturalism to all manner of social, moral, political, and evolutionary thought" (10), also demonstrates how its acceptance helped construct a self that tacitly reinforced the values of industrial capitalism (Cooter 166). Cowling notes how the social marginality of children, criminals, and working class people was artistically denoted in their physiognomies (e.g., 150, 179-80, 312ff.) as well as how fundamental to Victorian anthropology was the assumption that the scientific study of mankind rested upon the typing of physical difference (25 26, 59ff.). The belief that racial essence was inscribed in the face and head inspired James Cowles Prichard's racial typologies based on head shape and the cranial index of Anders Retzius, as well as various attempts to quantify the superiority of whites and Europeans by their supposedly greater cranial capacities, as measured by Paul Broca and others.9 The wide employment of such physiognomical typings in the fiction and visual art of the period gave further popular credence to the assumption that innate differences could be read in external appearance.10 Despite their methodological disputes about how to read physical appearance, phrenologists and physiognomists agreed that the cross-species applicability of physiognomical "laws" was important proof of their scientific reliability as well as their divine design. Franz Joseph Gall's demonstration of the phrenological swellings that distinguished carnivorous from frugivorous animals and murderous from peaceful men (4:50-51) was essentially a more literal extension of LeBrun's facial angles to embrace humans as well as brutes. It was commonplace in later popularizations, such as J. W. Redfield's 1850 Outlines of a New System of Physiognomy, to find evidence of faculties like "Attack" written in the broad noses of Canadian ponies as well as of Englishmen (Redfield 8-10),11 or to find phrenological parallels to proverbial animal behavior in human faces, as did Joseph Simm's Physiognomy</page><page sequence="11">Rosemary Jann 11 Illustrated, which traced the signs of "polygamy" in the eyes of Brigham Young and the hog, or of "demolitiousness" in the tiger and in "John R. Webster, murderer and natural thief" (Simms 163, 167). Although David de Giustino credits early Victorian phrenologists with helping to prepare the way for evolutionary theory by at least privately entertaining a developmental explanation for shared mental traits, popular writers were more likely to offer phrenological and physiognomical reassurances for humanity's continued uniqueness, even while reinforcing the shared ground between animal and human physiognomy.12 Their evidence sometimes focused on functional relationships that would later argue for an evolutionary explanation. John Cross's 1817 An Attempt to Establish Physiognomy upon Scientific Principles, for instance, explained the decline in jaw size from ape to man by arguing that in the "progress of animality" the power of grasping had been gradually transferred from the teeth to the hands, but he also read the resulting human face symbolically: the "human lips are moderators and regulators of the rapacious tendency of the jaws" and the mouth was literally as well as figuratively under the direction of the moral and intellectual faculties of the forehead (Cross 165, 193). Evidence of teleology for Cross, of course, would be evidence of evolutionary selection for Darwin. Popular physiognomy more often simply updated the conventional superiority of the intellectual cranium over the merely sensory face by offering new theorizations of the ways the human body contained but surpassed the animal. Thomas Cooke's 1819 A Practical and Familiar View of the Science of Physiognomy followed Cuvier's model fairly closely in stressing the increasing size of the forehead and skull (devoted to mental impressions) over nose and mouth (devoted to animal functions) as one moved up the chain of creation to mankind (Cooke 304). Alexander Walker's Physiognomy founded upon Physiology (1834) revamped Camper's facial angle by arguing that the cerebrum?which housed the intellectual faculties?diminished as one descended through lesser races and into lesser animals, while the cerebellum?the seat of volition, which animals shared with man?retained its form even as the facial angle flattened out (Walker 39 47). While echoing Walker's arguments, the Fowlers' New Illustrated Self Instructor in Phrenology and Physiology (1859) tipped the materialist hand of phrenology by asserting more forceful parallels between animal and human form, even finding in the orang-outang's skull evidence of its intellectual and moral development (Fowler 62-64). Responding to such threats, Samuel Wells's phrenologically inspired New Physiognomy (1867) superimposed the faces of lower animals and humans on the profile of a "first-class Caucasian" [fig. 6] to demonstrate that man, while sharing with animals instinctual faculties like appetite and self-defense, located at the base of the brain, alone</page><page sequence="12">12 Victorian Review Fig. 6: Left, facial angle of human skull superimposed upon that of animals; right, comparative facial angle in a) "a first-class Caucasian" b) "a man of lower type" and c) an animal; from Wells Reproduced courtesy of the Library of Congress Fig. 7: Partitioning of skull into areas devoted to 1) the instinct, 2) reason, and 3) spirituality, from Wells Reproduced courtesy of the Library of Congress</page><page sequence="13">ROSEMARY JANN 13 possessed the cranial capacity to accommodate rational and spiritual faculties [fig. 7] (Wells 596-99). Notwithstanding such proof of the European's uncontested-and the lesser races' relative-superiority to animals, the shadow of Darwin had clearly overtaken this text, prompting Wells's insistence that the physiognomist would not succumb to the "absurd error" of kinship between man and ape "which some modern naturalists are so anxious to establish," for he could see that "a broad and impassable gulf, with no intermediate stepping-stones," separated the heads of gorilla and man (Wells 595). Notwithstanding persistent suspicions of its materialist implications, the popular "science" of physiognomy actually reinforced conceptions of development that made the more revolutionary implications of Darwinian evolution easier to ignore. When seen through the lens of physiognomy, similarities between animal and human appearance demonstrated that all creation followed the same natural laws, while the graduated differences affirmed that a progressive teleology had worked quite literally to externalize symbols of humanity's intellectual superiority over animals, as well as Europeans' superiority over lesser races." Giving mind a conveniently vague metaphysical status and granting it control over appearance, as most physiognomists did, made the face and head into "natural" signs of an innate moral status that could not be counterfeited.' Physiognomical theories allowed the Victorians to preserve man's special place in nature without having to resort to special creation: they allowed for a developmental relationship between animal and human that still preserved indelible visual proof of man's moral and intellectual superiority. And yet, without the assurance that mind really was more than matter, or that spirit really had physical manifestations, the very similarities insisted upon by the "scientific" laws of physiognomy could leave providential progress with little or no toe hold on the slippery slope down to biological descent. Given that the face was so often the privileged site for defining human superiority, we can understand why Darwin chose to devote an entire volume to The Expression of the Emotions, rather than appending his comments to the Descent as he had originally intended. We can also understand how earlier assumptions about divine order were undermined by his insistence that animals were as expressive as humans because their faces shared the same musculature and that such often involuntary expressions could be adequately accounted for by reflex, habit, and the association of ideas. His demonstration that adaptation was more powerful than design in explaining bodily form and that animal/human resemblance was more persuasively accounted for by -common descent than by the teleological unfolding of physiognomic "laws" further challenged the assumptions upon which physiginomy was based." uRt physiognomic precedeants could still provide</page><page sequence="14">14 Victorian Review the popular imagination with ways of blunting the most subversive implications of Darwinian theory. Moreover, Darwin himself abetted such interpretations, in part because his own rhetorical purposes at times led him to stress elements in his theory easily adaptable to physiognomist thought, and in part because he shared many of his contemporaries * assumptions about the way racial and cultural difference was inscribed in appearance. Darwin had already made clear the foundation of his most serious departures from earlier explanations of human development in The Descent of Man (1871). In his hands, the immense difference between the mind of the savage and that of the Newton formed the most persuasive argument in favor of evolution: since there could be no denial that they were nevertheless "connected by the finest gradations" of intellect, it was possible that "they might pass and be developed into each other" (Descent 446). By analogy, the apparently unbridgeable gap between the ape and man could similarly be filled up with numberless gradations of form and intellect. By showing how plausibly the "infinite gradations" that linked the Great Chain and implicitly structured the physiogonomic scaling of creation could be explained by biological descent, Darwin realized the subversive rhetorical potential that had always been implicitly available in such models of continuity. His careful analysis of physical similarities between humans and lower animals further eroded claims for such purportedly unique human features as forehead and eyebrows (Descent 516). And even before going on in The Expression of the Emotions to demonstrate that facial expression had been shaped more by instinct, habit, and reflex than by volition or morality, he had shown in the Descent that the moral character so crucial to physiognomic claims for human superiority could itself have developed out of social behavior in animals. In the introductory chapter of acknowledgements to The Expression of the Emotions, Darwin made clear his generally low esteem for conventional physiognomic accounts of expression, which he took to mean mainly studies of pathognomy, or the positioning of the features conventionally associated with specific emotions. Although he makes no references to LeBrun's or Camper's work on animal/human resemblance, he dismissed their discourses on the expression of human passions as largely irrelevant to his interests (Expression 1). While praising Charles Bell and the French scientists Pierre Gratiolet and Guillaume Duchenne for their careful charting of the physiology of emotions (2, 5-6), he rejected their claims that certain muscles were specially created to permit human expression (10-11). He denied that all human states of mind necessarily issued in specific facial expressions (79) and criticized the excessive emphasis on vocal and respiratory organs by noting among animals the communicative uses of other body parts (94). In his own investigations of expression, Darwin concentrated mainly not on fixed moral traits but on temporary facial responses to specific states of</page><page sequence="15">Rosemary Jann 15 mind. He adduced three principles to explain the evolution of expression (Expression 28-29). The first, serviceable associated habits, hypothesized that certain states of mind resulted in physiological changes that are directly or indirectly serviceable to the gratification or relief of those states and that would come to be performed by habit and association whenever the same state of mind was induced?for instance, the bristling and rigidity that prepare a dog approaching an enemy for attack. The second principle, antithesis, argued that when an opposite state of mind is induced, there will be a strong and involuntary tendency to perform movements exactly opposite to those serviceable to the initial state. Thus the curved spine and wagging tail of the fawning dog had no use or meaning in themselves, but were simply the movements opposite to those evoked by attack. The third principle attributed some expressions to the direct action of the nervous system: "when the sensorium is strongly excited, nerve-force is generated in excess, and is transmitted in certain definite directions, depending on the connection of the nerve-cells, and partly on habit" (29); examples would include once serviceable actions that had since been converted into reflexes, such as coughing, sneezing, and starting or blinking when frightened. Under such analysis, many of the expressions most cherished by physiognomists as signs of human uniqueness turned out to have essentially mechanical explanations. For a popular commentator like Lady Eastlake, for instance, a baby was little more than a "sleeping, wheezing greedy little animal" until the smile appeared that was "all-sufficient to distinguish man from the brutes" (Eastlake 78-79). For Darwin, that smile was simply the muscular configuration that readied the face to utter loud sounds expressing pleasure through laughter (Expression 206-7). The turning up of the eyes in prayer (a physiognomical sign made possible by man's uniquely mobile eyebrow) was most likely a merely conventional result of the belief that heaven is located above (218). Tears were seen as the now habitual result of the contraction of the orbicular muscles that protected the eyes from excessive engorgement with blood during violent expressions of grief or pain (162-63). Darwin explicitly questioned the theory, held by Bell and others, that blushing was specially designed by the Creator to reveal our moral sense (336). Rather, this now habitual dilation of the blood vessels on the face and neck was originally caused by the perception that excessive attention was being directed to those features (325 29). Notwithstanding Darwin's overt refutations of tenets fundamental to physiognomy, however, a selective reading of his theorizing about expression could be and was taken to furnish support for many of its assumptions. "Whatever amount of truth the so-called science of physiognomy may contain," he wrote, depended largely on the effect of muscular development that resulted from the habitual contraction of those parts of the face linked to</page><page sequence="16">16 Victorian Review the expression of certain dispositions (Expression 364-65). His associationist model of behavior might assign the expressions conventionally linked to certain emotions, like the firmly shut mouth signifying determination, to an initially serviceable behavior, like closing the mouth to preserve breath for strenuous activity, but it also allowed such expression to become habitually attached to the mere intention to be resolute (233-34), so that a physiognomist could in a sense still read expression as evidence of one's "character. " This kind of interpretation was further encouraged by Darwin's focus on so many emotions that the Victorians would have considered under moral control rather than involuntary: love, pride, devotion, reflection, sulkiness, hatred, and patience, for instance. The ambiguity of the line Darwin drew between habit and instinct allowed the physiognomist grounds to blur the voluntary with the innate, as it elsewhere allowed the natural theologian to take habit as evidence of design.16 Some aspects of the Descent's hypothesis about how human features evolved from those of our simian progenitors could also be reconciled with the supposed evidences of facial angle. Darwin supported his assertion that increased mental faculties would have resulted in a larger brain case?and hence, a larger and more rounded skull?by reference to the craniometrical updating of facial angle by Broca and others, who purported to show that brain capacity decreased as one moved downward from the civilized to the savage races (Descent 436-37). His speculations on how the human face lost its ape-like features needed only to be given a voluntarist twist by physiognomists to suit their needs. Arguing for the adaptive value of an upright posture that freed the hands for tool use and other functions, Darwin assumed that as man adopted the habit of using weapons, his jaws and teeth, no longer needed for tearing and biting, would shrink in size, thus reducing the jaw muscles that gave anthropomorphous apes their prognathous physiognomies (Descent 434-35). As Peter Bowler has demonstrated, rather than seeing man's upright posture as simply a practical step that enabled tool use, those with a vested interest in preserving a teleologica! progression assumed that it was only those anthropoids with advanced intellects that availed themselves of tools and weapons (Theories of Human Evolution 151 52). The upright posture and the large head erect on the spinal column could thus continue to be read as the outward and visible sign of intellectual superiority. Darwin not only shared in many common Victorian assumptions about the visual signs of difference, but depended upon these to make his evolutionary arguments more convincing. In The Expression of the Emotions, his attempts to obtain evidence of behaviors that went beyond the merely learned or conventional led him to seek out examples from (among others) "some of the commoner animals," from the insane, and from savage races</page><page sequence="17">Rosemary Jann 17 (13-17). In all three cases his foregone conclusions controlled the objectivity of his judgements. He naively assumed that "in observing animals, we are not so likely to be biassed by our imagination; and we may feel safe that their expressions are not conventional" (17). In actual practice, his efforts to demonstrate that animals possessed the same emotions as humans led him into an almost inevitable anthropomorphizing of their behavior and the ready acceptance of similar interpretations in the numerous other observers upon whom he relied for evidence. John Durant sees Darwin's anthropomorphizing as a direct outcome of his rejection of an anthrocentric view of nature, for the assumption of continuity led him to treat human properties as simply extreme examples of traits possessed by all animate life; as a result, Darwin projected "into nature as immanent properties and powers many of the complex human attributes whose origins he sought" (Durant 292, 303). In support of Darwin's claims that humanity's "mental powers" could have developed out of animal behavior, for instance, animals in the Descent practice deceit, revenge themselves on humans, demonstrate pride, modesty, and magnanimity, and even show the rudiments of religious devotion (e.g., 448 50, 470). Although some of Darwin's anthropomorphizing can also be blamed on the inescapability of intentionalist language and some of his desire to communicate effectively with a lay audience, it still owes much to a centuries old tradition of using human categories to interpret animal appearance, especially in domesticated and/or captive animals.17 Darwin's own pet dogs smile, greet animal friends, and express joy, dignity, disappointment, playfulness, and impatience in much the same ways as humans (Expression 57, 76-76, 119, 121). They grin and otherwise express to him their sense of fun, as well as the "perplexed discomfort" they feel when torn between impulses (120; 63; 123). Domesticated horses and cats are similarly communicative (e.g., 125-29). The expressions of monkeys and apes were of course of peculiar interest and particularly encouraged anthropomorphic language. The captive simians observed by Darwin and others have clear friends and enemies, are capable of being insulted (133), vexed (137), or made jealous (134, 138). They pout like sulky children (140); when concentrating on a difficult task, they compress their lips like humans (41). Such anthropomorphic descriptions certainly helped conceal Darwin's breaks with physiognomic tradition and made it easier for those steeped in its assumptions to accommodate his observations to their different model of motivation and causality. Darwin's treatment of the socially marginal also meshed with physiognomic convention. Evolutionary theory reinforced the traditional association of insanity with physical difference, a tradition Sander Gilman traces from the late eighteenth century (26). By the Victorian period, it was</page><page sequence="18">18 Victorian Review conventional to believe that different types of insanity were distinguishable by facial expression. By grouping together animals, children, non-Europeans, and the insane as offering a similarly transparent and unmediated display of emotion, The Expression of the Emotions (13-17) implicitly encouraged the assumption that the insane were physiologically closer to animals. Darwin cautiously agreed with Henry Maudsley's view that the violent behavior of the insane was proof that they possessed the "brute nature within" (qtd. 244). He initially accepted evidence from James Crichton Browne that like animals, they were more likely to respond to stress by erecting their hair (295) and included such evidence in The Expression of the Emotions }* In the Descent, he had also grouped "microcephalous idiots" with monkeys and "barbaric races" for their tendency to imitate whatever they heard (Descent 463). Evidence that savage races were closer in appearance to animals also played an important role in making more plausible Darwin's claims that humans could have evolved from animal forms. He had argued in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication that the crossing of civilized with "inferior" races seldom resulted in "a good expression" in the offspring, for as with animals, crossing caused a reversion to a more primitive and savage condition (Variation 2:46-47). In the Descent he cited evidence that the ears of negroes often lacked the lobule that some naturalists took as distinguishing human from gorilla ears (403). Although he assumed it was disuse rather than any sort of design that accounted for the decreasing size of sense organs among civilized races, his citation of evidence from Johann Rudolph Rengger, Blumenbach, and James Prichard that savage races like American aborigines and Mongolians possessed larger facial cavities for these organs could easily be taken as an implicit endorsement of physiognomic correlations between prominent sense organs and intellectual inferiority (Descent 419-20). It was important to Darwin's claim that certain expressions were innate or instinctive to be able to demonstrate that these held true across racial lines. In his efforts to solicit supporting evidence, he sent observers, many of them missionaries supervising aboriginal races, a highly tendentious series of questions (e.g., "when a man is indignant or defiant does he frown, hold his body and head erect, square his shoulders and clench his fists?" Expression 15). The result was that European expressive conventions were inevitably confirmed as the norm. It did not surprise Darwin to learn that children of savages exhibited when sulky a stronger impulse than did European children to protrude their lips like apes or gorillas, "for the essence of savagery seems to consist in the retention of a primordial condition" (233); similarly, only among savage races did he find evidence of pouting as an expression of astonishment, as it was in anthropoid apes (285). As Nancy Stepan argues, positioning savages as a missing link between animal and human helped make</page><page sequence="19">ROSEMARY JANN 19 Darwin's argument for continuity more plausible (53). In the process, he clearly reinforced long-standing physiognomic hierarchies that had always placed savages at the boundaries of full humanity. Given the symbolic prominence accorded to the face, head, and brain by physiognomic and phrenological traditions, it is not surprising to find that these remained the locus for many post-Origin debates about humankind's animal ancestry, such as Richard Owen's contention that the ape brain lacked such uniquely human structures as the hippocampus minor and T.H. Huxley's categorical refutation of the same (Huxley 138-39). Relying on Samuel Morton's measurements of cranial capacities to demonstrate that the differences between the largest (that is, most civilized) human brains and the smallest were greater than the difference between the smallest human and the largest ape brain, Huxley, like Darwin, also exploited the conventional physiognomic hierarchy of racial types to make an ape ancestry more plausible (Huxley 106-7). Cesare Lombroso's attempts to find the "stigmata" of mankind's animal past on the body of the criminal owed its plausibility to the popular authority of physiognomic and evolutionary thinking, as did numerous other attempts in the second half of the century to justify the social marginality of various races, classes, and ethnic groups by arguing that their inferiority was inscribed in their closer resemblance to animals. Increased scientific sophistication in the study of expression could simply give more authority to old stereotypes. As late as the 1930s a legitimate scientist could still purport to demonstrate that the coarser facial musculature of negroes deprived them of the range of expression possible for whites (Huber 160 61).20 Even with the gradual acceptance of evolution by natural selection among scientists, the assumption-nurtured in part by the long legacy of the great chain of being and physiognomical commitments to the "human face divine"-that the human form and mind were the goals toward which all creation was teleologically aimed showed a remarkable resilience in being able to disguise or subvert the element of randomness at the base of evolutionary theory. Although Darwin's "tree" was branching and variations could occur in all directions, he did use evaluative terminology (e.g., higher and lower, more advanced) that tacitly supported the widespread popular assumption that change was progressive and evolution hierarchical." His supporters were also more likely to overemphasize the linearity of human evolution from apes in their effort to deny humanity a special creative status, thus helping to obscure the fact that the connections among species farther removed from mankind were far less linear than they appeared to be at the "top." Peter Bowler has documented the various alternative models of human evolution that responded to this threatening vision of linear descent by attempting to displace our animal and hominid ancestors into side branches and thus reserve a main line</page><page sequence="20">20 Victorian Review of development leading directly to the truly human. In such progressive but not linear family trees, one could argue that physical resemblance between animal and human was the result of parallel responses to similar environments rather than of transmutation, or that humankind had simply passed through an ape-like stage on its way to the ultimate perfection of human form, rather than sharing a direct ancestry with lower animals (Theories of Human Evolution 47-48). Recapitulation theory?in Ernst Haeckel's version, the belief that in the course of their embryological development modern human beings repeated all the adult ancestral forms in the evolutionary chain leading up to mankind?also helped reinforce the idea that the human body contained but surpassed the forms of lower animals, much as did some physiognomic models. Haeckel's own examples, indeed, give considerable emphasis to resemblances between human facial features and those of lower animals, linking them up in graded series.22 Recapitulation also gave scientific authority to the assumption that natural development unfolded according to a preordained and hierarchical plan whose goal was the realization of human form and intellect.23 William Gregory's 1929 Our Face from Fish to Man will serve as a fitting close to this survey of the imaginative legacy of physiognomic theory. Gregory, a Professor of Vertebrate Palaeontology at Columbia University, was cautious about the exact links between humans and their animal ancestors in his technical studies of comparative anatomy.24 But in this more popularized work he apparently felt that only an emphatic linearity would convince his target audience: those anti-Darwinians who still clung to the idea that man had been mystically formed in the image of God instead of realizing that "the face is merely the food-detecting and food-trapping mask in front of the brain" (Our Face 14) or who tried to evade the proofs of lineal descent by resort to parallel development (154). His concern to emphasize our debt to the faces of lower creatures led him into strongly intentionalist language (e.g., the first amphibians "cast off the whole series of bones that covered the branchial chamber and made for themselves an ear-drum ..." [89]) and resolved his frontispiece family tree of the human face into a simplistic linearity [fig. 8], with the Tasmanian occupying the conventional middle position between the chimpanzee and the "Roman athlete."25 Given these implicit reinforcements of longstanding physiognomic traditions and teleologica! progress, it is not surprising that in his preface to Gregory's book William Beebe (himself a naturalist with the New York Zoological Society), overlooked its materialist emphases to portray it as celebrating "the gradual rise toward human perfection of the various components of the face," a process that "confirms our precious organs of sense as most noble gateways of the human mind and soul" (Our Face v).</page><page sequence="21">Rosemary Jann 21 Our Face from Fish to Man 1.

It was one of the most important sources of evidence that external nature was purposefully formed and that its moral significance was transparent to the trained observer. It objectified intellect and soul?the bases of human superiority?in the head and face and provided a way to acknowledge but also safely to negotiate the always troubling boundary between animal and human. It proved infinitely adaptable to confirming the hierarchical structure of natural and social order; because it promised the kind of control that comes from rendering the social universe predictable, it was as important to art as it was to science in the nineteenth century. By underpinning society's deepest beliefs and desires about purposive and legible order in nature, physiognomy served as a powerful lens through which the objective "facts" of science could be refocused to reveal the subjective contours of a comforting status quo well into the twentieth century. Notes 1. For instance, "Those that are black and timid, and are referred to Egyptians"; "those whose hair is very much curled are timid, and are referred to the Ethiopians" (History of Animals of Aristotle . . . 441-43). 2. Bryson (44-47) discusses Porta's physiognomic system and its influence on LeBrun. 3. In an 1827 commentary on LeBrun's work, Jacques Legrand (2-4) explained that for LeBrun, the differences between carnivorous and frugivorous animals, and between men of reason and men of passions, could be discerned in the differing angles that could be mapped between their features. 4. See Bynum (21) and Stepan (11-12) on the impact of Cuvier's and Lamarck's theorizing for the organization of the chain. Linneaus's grouping of humans in the same order as apes sparked sufficient controversy to suggest that his continuing confidence in man's absolute spiritual superiority was not universally shared; Buffon had to admit exceptions to the principal of infinite gradation in order to account for the alleged uniqueness of human speech and thought; Greene (179-84) discusses these and other aspects of animal/human relationship in Cuvier, Linneaus, and Buffon. 5. Figlio analyzes Cuvier*s identification of the brain and nervous system with the faculties that conveyed selfhood and, ultimately, "the perfection of life itself" (240). 6. As illustrated in Cooke (290-91), Cuvier and Camper also revamped the chain of being by purporting to chart the decline of facial angle?and hence, intelligence?through pole-cats and mastiffs down to rams and porpoises. Eighteenth-century theories of facial angle were anticipated by LeBrun's theories of facial angle. 7. Abernethy (84-86) similarly likens savage bodies, but not savage "nature," to that of animals. See Bowler (Theories of Human Evolution) for the ideological functions of polygenism in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. In Evolution: History of an</page><page sequence="23">ROSEMARY TANN 23 Idea (93), Bowler notes that perceived resemblances between stigmatized races and apes could in the late eighteenth century still be considered simply coincidental, no more evidence that men had evolved from apes than the great chain itself. 8. For additional discussion of the ideological functions of Victorian phrenology, see Parssiner and de Giustino. Sekula also discusses the role of physiognomical typing in Victorian criminology, and Benjamin addresses the uses of physiognomy in portraying class differences in nineteenth-century France. 9. Gould provides an extensive account of attempts to prove non-white inferiority by skull shape and capacity in The M is measure of Man; see also de Giustino (68-71) on racial stereotyping by phrenology and May hew (1:1-3), who brings together class and racial stereotypes by alleging similarities between the prognathous physiognomies of the urban poor and those of Prichard's nomadic races. 10. See Tytler and Fahnestock on the uses of physiognomy in the Victorian novel. Cowling provides a thorough analysis of physiognomical stereotyping in Victorian art; see also Codell on Bell's influence on physiognomical theories in Pre-Raphaelite art. 11. See also Redfield's Comparative Physiognomy for an extended account of alleged resemblances between animals and particular ethnic groups and individuals. 12. De Giustino (52-54; 105-15) argues that many phrenologists were privately more sceptical about traditional religious explanations of creation and deity than they wished publicly to acknowledge for fear of validating attacks on phrenology as materialist. His claim that "British phrenologists were very reluctant to circulate" (51) evolutionary charts like the progression of heads from the tadpole to the Apollo Belvedere found in Henri Scoutetten's El?ments de philosophie phrenologique (1861) suggests how relatively more controversial such visual evidence of biological continuum had become since Lavater's time. 13. Physiognomic scaling convinced Redfield that nature strove toward a "regular gradation of cerebral development" corresponding to "the scale of gradation in the animal kingdom" (Outlines 23) for instance, and constituted for Simms a clear sign that all nature "tends to rise from the coarsest towards the finest, from matter towards mind" (Simms 572). 14. However, see Cooter (chaps. 6 and 8) for a discussion of the inconsistencies between the fixed traits phrenology supposedly revealed and the possibilities for improvement it held out to its practitioners. 15. Although Chevalier-Skolnikoff claims that Darwin believed that the expression of emotions was "essential to the welfare of group-living animals" (13), Richards (230-31) argues that Darwin did not invoke natural selection to explain expression because he did not attribute survival value to it. 16. See Richards (143) for a discussion of these ambiguities in Darwin's work. 17. Richards (196-97) points out that it was scientifically acceptable in Darwin's day (as in a sense it remains in our own) to posit psychological states from observable behavior, since we have no other access to subjective states in either humans or animals, and that none of Darwin's contemporaries objected to his attribution of</page><page sequence="24">24 Victorian Review emotions and rudimentary intellectual states to animals. Ghiselin (188) and Ekman (2) make the argument about communicating with a lay audience. Ritvo, although she does not focus on appearance per se, presents a wide-ranging consideration of the ways animals functioned metaphorically to adumbrate human relationships in the Victorian period. 18. Gilman notes that the erected hair was more likely a symptom of hypothyroidism. By 1873 Darwin had begun to realize the inherent subjectivity involved in interpreting the photographs of the insane with which Browne supplied him: Gilman 132, 138-39. 19. On Lombroso, see Gould, Mismeasure of Man chap. 4. Curtis analyzes the popular Victorian tradition of depicting the Irish as ape-like. 20. Huber was Professor of Anatomy at Johns Hopkins University. Chorover discusses the role of judgments about appearance in the exclusion of immigrants to America (60-63) and in justifying Nazi claims about racial degeneration (104-5). 21. Mandelbaum (83-84) comments on the ways Darwin may have been unconsciously influenced by the chain of being metaphor. 22. See, for instance, plate 1, opposite the title page in volume 1 of Haeckel's The Evolution of Man or the charts depicting the "chief phylogenetic stages" of the human nose (2:249), eye (2:258), and ear (2:267). 23. Gould in Ontogeny and Phylogeny provides a full discussion of this and other aspects of recapitulation theory. 24. See, for instance, his The Origin and Evolution of Human Dentition (503), where he warns against exaggerating the linearity of evolution. 25. The historical inversion of Tasmanian and Roman athlete is partly explained by the conventional Victorian placement of the Tasmaniane lowest in the hierarchy of human races. Tylor (v) is typical in considering them culturally as throwbacks to the neolithic era. Although Lubbock lists other contenders for the lowest rank of civilization (544), he is particularly disparaging of Australian and Tasmanian abilities (550-51; 553; 565 66; 573-74). Brantlinger (1-2) discusses these attitudes towards the Tasmanians as well as their nineteenth-century extermination, and Stocking (Victorian Anthropology 281) notes the continuing European interest in measuring Tasmanian skulls.
