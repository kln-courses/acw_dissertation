<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS AND COMMENTS In examining this monograph, I am again struck with regret that this beautiful analysis of a single specimen of a rare animal lacks any companion volumes containing equally careful morphological descriptions of more common turtles, for which adequate series of different growth stages would pose fewer curatorial and logistic problems.-CARL GANS, Department of Zoology, The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan 48104. PARASITES OF FRESHWATER FISHES. By Glenn L. Hoffman and Fred P. Meyer. Edited by John C. Landolt. 1974. T. F. H. Publications, 211 West Sylvania Ave., Nep- tune, New Jersey 07753. 224 pp., 108 illus., paperback, $12.95.-This is a well organized, clearly written review of fish parasite control and treatment methods. The authors, who are renowned specialists in the field, have drawn together more than 390 up-to-date references and over 440 treatments. The treatments are discussed for each major parasite group in a handy chart form that greatly facilitates the book's usefulness. In- terspersed between the charts are full-page or half-page color plates illustrating the parasites and the appearance of their infec- tions in fish. There are 108 illustrations (all but 2 in color) on 57 pages, constituting more than 25% of the book's length and resulting in a significantly higher than ex- pected price for a paperback. The authors, by their own admission, made no attempt to evaluate the various works cited or to provide a systematic means for the reader to determine the identification of the specific pathogen involved. They do, how- ever, cite major references that deal with diagnosis of the pathogen or comprehen- sively discuss treatment and control methods. Knowledge in the area of fish parasites and infectious diseases has been constantly growing ever since shortly after the turn of the century. Early pioneers like H. S. Davis, who eventually founded what is now known as the U. S. Dept. of Interior's Eastern Fish Disease Laboratory, laid the groundwork for subsequent development by investigators such as Fish, Gutsell, Rucker, Snieszko and Wolf. Yet, no matter how impressive the body of information has grown it has never kept pace or satisfied the demands from the many state and federal fish hatcheries, and especially in more recent years with those of the rapidly expanding aquarium culture and fish farming industries. For this and other reasons, Parasites of Freshwater Fishes is an important and welcomed addi- tion. FISH PATHOLOGY. By Heinz-Herman Reichenbach-Klinke in collaboration with Marsha Landolt. 1973 (published in Ger- man, 1966). T. F. H. Publications, 211 West Sylvania Ave., Neptune, New Jersey 07753. 512 pp., 383 illus., paperback, $17.50.- Originally published in German and recently translated into English, H.-H. Reichenbach- Klinke's Fish Pathology is a guide to the diagnosis and treatment of fish diseases and injuries. In it the author "attempts to meet the requirements of the practical worker as well as those of the fish pathologist, the fishery biologist and the veterinary surgeon who have chosen to specialize in the field of fish pathology, and the parasitologist." Although mostly dealing with freshwater organisms, Reichenbach-Klinke also mentions the most frequent parasites and diseases of marine fishes. Further, he devotes a chapter to the effects of waste waters and pollution on fish health and community welfare. In an effort to cover such an extensive area, the author has compiled an impressive number of references (mostly European) and illustrations, including more than 50 in color as compared with only 2 color plates in the original German edition. Although somewhat expensive as a paperback, the English edition is one dollar cheaper than the German version in spite of its many more color illustrations. Certainly a well edited book with only a few minor errors noted by this reviewer.-GARY L. POWELL, Department of Zoology, University of Texas at Austin, Austin, Texas 78712. FISHES OF POLYNESIA. By Raymond Bagnis, Phillipe Mazellier, Jack Bennett and Erwin Christian. 1972. Les ltditions du Pacifique, Papeete, Tahiti. 368 pp. + nu- merous illustrations, most in color. $2.95.- Tropical fishes are surely among the most colorful animals known. If any proof of this statement were needed, the many color photographs in this book provide it. One wishes that the text lived up to the illustra- tions. The book is a compendium of lore of the fishes of Polynesia, mixing together scientific 577</page><page sequence="2">COPEIA, 1974, NO. 2 statements (and mis-statements), native knowledge and tall tales in an uncritical fashion which, in the end, turns out to be pleasant reading. Anthropomorphism rears its ugly head all too frequently (bill-fishes are "bravest," the stone-fish is "savagely ugly," needlefishes "battle courageously," etc.). The four co-authors are all famous spearfisher- men and scuba divers, and the book is obviously written from the point of view of fishermen for fishermen. Written first in French, translated into English, the type set in France, printed in Japan, it is perhaps not surprising that typographical errors are numerous. For each species are given scientific, Ta- hitian and English names, along with a brief discussion of the general appearance, habits, edibility, etc. Each description is accom- panied by a color photograph and a pen- and-ink outline drawing, and many also have underwater color photographs, showing the live colors of the fishes in their natural habitats. In some groups, notably the spear- fishes, the scientific nomenclature is out of date, reflecting, I suspect, the isolation of the authors from good libraries. Probably for the same reason, the bibliography is woefully inadequate. It was interesting to find that the Tahitians often have different names for males and females, or for different sized individuals, of the same species. This type of careful differentiation seems to be characteristic of people who live close to nature. At the other end of the world, the Kobuk eskimos of Alaska have at least three names for the inconnu (Stenodus leucichthys), according to size, sex and spawning condi- tion. One of the most pleasant features of the book is the inclusion of a typical Tahitian recipe at the end of each chapter. Although some recipes lack detail as to quantities of various items, even amateur chefs will have little trouble in producing tasty dishes. The two I have tried were delicious. Despite its faults, this is a pleasant book, withal. It will be useful to the casual ob- server, the spearfisherman or angler, and the visiting ichthyologist unfamiliar with the local fauna. The professional, systematic ichthyologist, however, will gain little from it but pleasant relaxation and some fine dinners.-J. E. M. 578</page></plain_text>
