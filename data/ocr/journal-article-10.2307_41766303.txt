<plain_text><page sequence="1">Looted gold ornament from Sipán In This Issue Means of Survival In 1990 the United States imposed a five- year import ban on Moche artifacts. The action, requested by the government of Peru, followed massive looting and site de- struction at Sipán, the site of the richest Moche burials ever found. Many of the plundered items subsequently appeared on the international art market. Although im- port bans may inhibit the marketing of such artifacts by antiquities dealers and auction houses, one wonders how effective they can be if indigenous peoples treat their cultural patrimony as little more than a commodity. While researching our cover story on the royal Moche tombs at Sipán (see page 30), associate editor Angela Schuster filed this report: "The market in Chiclayo sells every- thing from live chickens to bicycle parts. One vendor in particular caught my eye. Her hands were calloused and strong, no doubt from years of taming a harsh landscape. Her eyes were dark and deep-set. Like others in this section of the market, her stall was filled with vials of all sizes, misshapen candles, dried lizards, even bottles of rosewater made in Newjersey. The smell of fruit, straw, and manure wafted in the warm air. "A bruja , or witch-doctor, she was selling potions believed to control things like weather, crops, health, and love. I watched as she stuffed a tiny ampule with seeds, bits of bone, lizard skin, chamomile, corn, and claw. What curse was she concocting? Was the slight movement of her mouth an incantation? Her figure was obscured by bundles of herbs and stacks of deer hooves and jaguar pelts. A plastic statue of Saint An- thony of Padua, hanging on a mat partition, smiled down on her as she worked. I noticed that she wore no shoes - the soles of her feet were hard and leathery. "A metal object glistened beneath a heap of sundried iguana. As I moved the reptiles aside, a copper mask with hammered eyes glazed in cinnabar gazed up. There were more pieces - ceramics, both human and anthropomorphic, fired black and encrusted. ťYou want?' she asked. 'I have more. The price is good.' The conversion worked out to little more than pocket change. "My fascination was interpreted as interest. She ducked under her table and returned with a parcel of ancient cloth - tattered, torn, and knotted. Her small, bent fingers peeled back the fibers, revealing the burnt red slip of a fine Moche portrait vase. Whose face? It was hers - flat, wide, and sunbaked. This descendant of the ancient Moche was eager, almost proud, to be selling a piece of her past. For a dealer such an artifact might bring quite a sum - for this witch-doctor, oblivious to the import ban, its sale was simply another means of survival." Peter A.
