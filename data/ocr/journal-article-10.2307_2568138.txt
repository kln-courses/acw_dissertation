Paper, $17.50, ISBN 0-231-10337-9.) Why do we stare at freaks? Admit, first, that we do. Perhaps we force our eyes away, and we pointedly remind ourselves that physical attri- butes have nothing to do with what matters in a person, but then, having realigned our moral compass, we sneak another glance, most of us anyway, and guiltily ponder our compul- sion to reduce a human being to an object of curiosity. Awareness of this faulty human sen- sibility hovers over this new field, which ex- amines the most "other" of all "others"; and scholars who work in its grim shadows insist that we consider the subject with brutal can- dor: hence the term freaks. 1501</page><page sequence="2">1502 The Journal of American History March 1998 The subject seemingly falls under the schol- arly purview of sociology, literature, psychol- ogy, or moral philosophy; and in fact the early work has mostly been undertaken by scholars in these disciplines. The two seminal books were the literary critic Leslie Fiedler's Freaks: Myths and Images of the Secret Self (1978), which condemned the "tyranny of the normal," and the sociologist Robert Bogdan's Freak Show (1988), which insisted on the social construc- tion of "freakery." Since then, historical issues have moved to center stage, because the ques- tion of why we stare at freaks immediately begs another: Is this sad habit something we have learned through acculturation, or does it inhere in our species, furnishing yet more proof of the sorry state of the essential human condition? There is plenty of evidence in the works un- der review to sustain both positions. The social constructionists focus on mid- nineteenth-century America, where the exhi- bition of freaks attained some sort of institu- tional culmination. The story, which can be pieced together from a half dozen of the essays in Rosemarie Garland Thomson's collection, begins with Charles Willson Peale, who sought to "colonize death" by painting deceased per- sons, preserving them in chemicals, and dis- playing their relics in his museum. In 1850 Peale's museum was purchased by Phineas T. Barnum, who made a fortune by exhibiting living freaks along with lurid artifacts of the dead: General Tom Thumb, the Bearded Lady, the Leopard-Skinned Boy. Barnum's exhibits were tremendously popular and inspired a le- gion of imitators who set up freak shows at fairs, museums, amusement parks, and audi- toriums. Why, scholars ask, did this intense interest in freakery peak in Victorian America? In a splendid introductory essay, Thomson sees the proliferation of mid-nineteenth-century freak shows as a response to modernization. Machine culture effected the "standardization of everyday life" and enshrined a "sameness of form." Freaks were not true to form - did not "fit" - and thus were pushed aside as mod- ernity marched ahead. Several of Thomson's essayists, on the other hand, associate the rise of the freak shows with intensifying concerns over race relations during the 1840s and 1850s. Many circus freaks, it turns out, were blacks or whites in blackface. A popular example was Barnum's exhibit "What Is It?," which featured a fur- or feather-clad person, wielding a spear and bounding about in a cage, who, according to the advertisement, "looks like a man but acts like a monkey." To whites in the pivotal 1840s and 1850s, such depictions articulated a host of contradictory racial viewpoints and anxieties. But many other essays in Thomson's volume show that the fascination with freaks trans- cended mid-nineteenth-century America. Greek mythology and the Bible were filled with stories of unusual peoples, such as Polyphemus the cylops or Goliath the giant. In medieval England, dwarfs and other "abnormal" peoples gathered for profitable display during the an- nual festival at Bartholemew's Fair. The Puri- tans were curiously fixated on the subject of "monstrous births," evident departures from God's design that held immense theological portent. Barnum and Bailey had plenty of precursors. Early in the twentieth century, sensibilities changed. The medical profession defined freaks, not as entertaining or edifying curiosities, but as patients with physiological defects, suscep- tible to surgical improvement. One could no more gape at Siamese twins than at a paraple- gic, and by the 1940s the "freak show" had all but vanished. But the fascination with freak- ery persisted. Horror and science fiction films satisfied the craving by displaying a fabulous array of ghouls and misshapen creatures rang- ing from Frankenstein to E. T. and the deni- zens of the space cantina in Star Wars. Now- adays TV talk shows bring all manner of psychological and physiological oddities into our homes, allowing us to stare unselfconscious- ly at myriad tattooed women, bodybuilders, anorexics, and exotically got-up entertainers. All this goes to show that human beings are fascinated by freaks and always have been. Barnum and Bailey recognized this truth from the start; it seems to me that their extraor- dinary success was likely related to the institu- tional thickening of American life in the mid- nineteenth century. Barnum and Bailey were simply the first to use modern business, mar- keting, and distribution techniques fully to ex- ploit it. Hollywood and the TV talk shows have updated these methods. But why are people almost universally at-</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 1503 tracted to and repelled by freaks? In The Inhuman Race, Leonard Cassuto offers a thoughtful answer. The human mind, Cassuto maintains, is wired to recognize and identify with the human form. Infants apparently as- sume that a card with two dots and a line below it is a human face, and children instinctively apply anthropomorphic traits to animals. Thus, when we see freaks, our instinct is to identify with them and affirm their humanity. But our cultural conditioning, which imposes categories and structures upon human activity, tells us that freaks are not really human. Because the mind cannot accept something that simultane- ously is and is not, it posits an intermediate category for them: freaks. Cassuto insists, as do more than a few of Thomson's essayists, that this categorical inde- terminacy is best understood as an example of liminality, the most versatile tool in the lit- erary theorists' kit bag. Cassuto argues, for in- stance, that Puritans tried to think of native peoples as savages but knew them too well to deny their basic humanness. So the Puritans instead identified them as freaks or grotesques, a liminal category upon which the Puritans could fasten all sorts of meanings and signifi- cance. Cassuto makes much the same point about African American slaves, whom slave owners initially objectified as mere chattel or animals, a label whose falsity was obvious even to those who employed it. (No sane person would "punish" a cow by whipping it.) So south- ern whites referred to their slaves as "freaks" or "grotesques": the good ones were "Sambos," and the bad ones, like Nat Turner, "monsters." Cassuto's basic idea strikes me as sound, and Thomson's collection of over two dozen essays provides an indispensable and intriguing sum- mary of the evolution of this important new field during the past ten years. But in one important respect, these works leave me unsatisfied. Many of the writers on the subject have been so intent on analyzing how society exhibited, represented, and de- scribed freaks that the freaks themselves often disappear. The reliance on the tools of literary discourse deprives these "others" of the broader social and cultural context that might make sense of their lives. Cassuto at times seems more interested in the views of the anthropologist Mary Douglas than those of Frederick Douglass; and Thomson's writers, some of whom have expressed misgivings over their own fascination with the subject, look harder at those who stared than at the freaks themselves. When observed from their own perspective, the freaks were freaks only when they put on their makeup and costumes, climbed upon a platform in the circus, and stared out at the gaping rubes and idiots who had been taken in by Barnum's humbug.
