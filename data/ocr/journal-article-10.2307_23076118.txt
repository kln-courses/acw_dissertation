We will explain this concept and trace its influence first in relation to the emanationist theory of the cosmos as conceived by Ikhwän al-Safä'and Miskawayh, and then within the context of a creationist view of the universe as expounded by al-Isfahânï Jachimowicz argues that Islamic cosmology has its roots within the Qur'än, which provides the Islamic metaphysical basis for the integration of Greek cosmological doctrines. In this sense, Islamic cosmology is a combination of the Greek heritage and Islamic revelation. There are two Qur'änic metaphysical principles that lay the basis for the Islamic perception of cosmology. One is the principle of tawhïd, which is that God is the One Creator of the heavens and the earth, and the other is the high status that God accords to man in the cosmos.3 1 The Brethren of Purity wrote fifty-one treatises in the 4th/10th century known as the Rasâ'il (Epistles) of the Brethren of Purity. The authors are not known, but they were of Shi'i inspiration and were probably based in Basrah. The Epistles had a wide influence on later Muslim intellectual figures, including Ahmad ibn Muhammad Miskawayh (d. 421/1030), al Righib al-Isfahânï (d. 502/1108) and Muhammad al-Ghazzâlï (d. 505/1111). 2 Al-Râghib al-Isfahânï is an Islamic ethical philosopher who died around the middle of the eleventh century. He wrote an ethical work called al-Dhari'ah ilä Makärim al-Sharî'ah (The Means to the Noble Qualities of the Law), which had a great influence on the ethics of al Ghazzali. For his theory of creation we refer in this article mainly to his Tafsïl al-Nash'atayn wa Tahsïl al-Sa'ädatayn. For more detail on his life and works, see, Yasien Mohamed, "The Ethical Philosophy of al-Râghib al-Isfahânï", in Journal of Islamic Studies, 6: 1 (1995), 51-75. For some information on the impact of his cosmological ideas on al-Ghazzâlï, see, Yasien Mohamed, "Knowledge and Purification of the Soul: An Annotated Translation with Introduction of Isfahânî's Kitäb al-Dhari'a ilâ Makärim Sharï'a, (58-76; 89-92ψ in Journal of Islamic Studies, 9: 1 (1998), 1-34. 3 Jachimowicz, "Islamic Cosmology", in Carmen Blacker and Michael Loewe eds., Ancient</page><page sequence="2">658 YASIEN MOHAMED The idea of a Creator of the universe was not alien to the pre-Islamic Arabs, but it had little influence on their notion of human destiny. The Qur'än, which recognizes that God is the source of all things in the creation, changed their view of God's relation to human destiny. According to Qur'än God is the Creator of man and man is His creature. 'That is Allah, your Lord; there is no god but He, Creator of all things' (6: 102).4 In contrast to this Qur'änic idea of creation was the emanationist concept of creation, which emerged later due to foreign influences. The Ikhwän exemplified this emanationist view of creation. I IKHWÄN AL-SAFÀ' In this section we will deal first with the cosmology of Ikhwän al-Safä' and secondly with their view of man as a microcosm of the universe. The Cosmology of Ikhwan al-Safa' Islamic cosmology, as exemplified by Ikhwan al-Safä', is based on a Neoplatonic system of emanation, which is based on four central concepts, those of the One, the Spirit, the Soul and the material world. In this Neoplatonic system, the human species occupies a position at the top of the terrestrial realm, as it is the culminating point of the cosmos. The more basic aspects of the terrestrial realm precede man: minerals yield to plants, which support animals, until the crowning purpose of this realm, man, is achieved, within whom both the spiritual and the physical dimensions of the cosmos are contained as the 'small world' (al- 'àlam al-saghïr), expressing in microcosm the entire cosmos. Man was deemed as such because all the dimensions of the cosmos are within him. Furthermore, keeping in with Neoplatonic thought, when the human soul is liberated from materiality, it is able to return to God, the Creator of both, human soul and the cosmos. This concept of man as microcosm is integral to the cosmology of Ikhwan al-Safä. We will return to this idea in the second part of this section. Cosmologies (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1975), 143-145. The high status given to man in the Qur'än can be ascertained by the dialogue between God and the angels concerning Adam. See, Qur'än, 2: 29-33. 4 All translations are taken from Majid Fakhry, The Qur'ân: A Modern English Version (Reading, UK: Garnet, 1996).

They combined Neoplatonic philosophy, Aristotelian thought and Islamic doctrine.5 The Epistles explain the origin of the world in terms of Neoplatonic emanation. They view the universe as a unified whole, with its parts held together by the analogies that exist between them.6 These connections are expounded in terms of numerical symbolism. The forms of the material world correspond with the forms of the spiritual world; the difference is that the former perish while the latter abide. By observing nature, one can discern the power, skill and wisdom of its Maker. Through numbers, Ikhwän al-Safâ' relate multiplicity to unity and bring to light the harmony that pervades the universe. This harmony also indicates the unity of the Maker.7 Like Plato, who inherited the idea that the reality of things in the physical world is geometric in form from the Pythagoreans8, the Ikhwän also posit the presupposition that the essence of natural objects is supremely intelligible, as distinct from those aspects of physical reality that are sensible insofar as they can only be perceived by the physical senses. The world of nature, therefore, will possess for Ikhwän al-Safä' certain formal elements which are intelligible. Since these elements are immanent in nature, they are real, and so those aspects that reflect their reality will also be real. The immanent God of Ikhwän al-Safä' is meant to bridge the gap between God and the creation, and between God and man. Their emanationist cosmology embraces a Neoplatonic conception of a detached God, not a God that has a direct relation to man. Man in this scheme is merely a part of the cosmos. And it is the physical dimension of himself and the cosmos which he must transcend before he can become close to God, and participate in His divine qualities. 5 Seyyed Hossein Nasr, "Philosophy and Cosmology", in The Cambridge History of Iran (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1975), 4: 428f. 6 Richard Lewis Nettleship, Lectures on the Republic of Plato (Philadelphia, PA: R. West, 1967), 226ff. According to Plato, everything in the universe and in man's life is an organised whole, 'a little world'. The entire world would be the whole of the many little organic parts of it. This idea is worked out in the Timaeus with reference to the universe, but it is applicable to society and human life. Morality is related to knowledge. We understand things only in relation to the good of them. The supreme good, the end to which all things converge, that gives light to the intelligible universe, is expressed in Plato's sun metaphor. Since everything in the world reflects the good, for man to attain the good he would have to live in this light. 7 Seyyed Hossein Nasr, An Introduction to Islamic Cosmological Doctrines (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1964), 44ff. 8 Phillip Sherrard, Human Image: World Image: The Death and Resurrection of Sacred Cosmology (Cambridge: 1992), llf.</page><page sequence="4">660 YASIEN MOHAMED In the emanationist theory of Ikhwän al-Safä' the creation begins with the Creator, descends through the multiple states of Being, and ends with the terrestrial creatures whose final link is man. It follows this sequence: Creator, Intellect, Soul, Matter, Nature, Body, the Sphere, the Elements, and the Beings of this world.9 God first created the Intellect, which contains the forms of all things. From the Intellect originates the Universal Soul (al-nafs al-kulliyyab), and from the latter proceeds Matter. Man is the last in the 'Chain of Being' as he has been created from both the terrestrial elements and the celestial elements.10 The universe, although resembling God, is nevertheless distinct from Him. The emanationist theory of Ikhwän al-Safä' differs from that of Plotinus: first, because of its Neopythagorean tendencies where the "emanation of all things from God was compared to the emanation of all numbers from one"; and secondly, because "the processes of emanation and creation were the result of the Creator's choice and deliberate action".11 The techniques of numerical symbolism and analogy form the basic style of the Ikhwän to illuminate both the reality and beauty of the relation between the microcosm and the macrocosm and the hierarchy of being.12 Nearly every chapter of the Epistles refers to the analogy between man and the universe. To mention some examples, the relation between the Universal Soul and the universe is compared to the relation between the human soul and the human body. Also, the death of the universe is compared with the death of a human being. Reverse analogies are also present, whereby man is compared with aspects of the earth and heaven, not only for vividness, but also to demonstrate the cosmic qualities of man. In this sense, man is a microcosm of the world; he is a 'small world'.13 Nasr states: 9 S.H. Nasr, Islamic Cosmological Doctrines, 51f. The Creator is one and simple; the intellect is innate and acquired; the soul has three species: vegetative, animal and rational; the beings of the world are the mineral, plant and animal kingdoms; cf. Omar A. Farukh, "Ikhwän al-Safa", in M.M. Sharif, ed., History of Muslim Philosophy (Wiesbaden, Germany: Otto Harrassowitz, 1963), 1: 294ff., where the concept of emanation is explained as a compromise between the strict religious notion of creation and the Aristotelian view of the eternity of the world. 10 S.H. Nasr, Islamic Cosmological Doctrines, 52. 11 Ibid., 55f; cf. I. R. Netton, Muslim Neoplatonists (London: George Allen and Unwin, 1982), 34f. 12 Apparently, early Greek thinkers conceived of the universe as one living being in which the phenomena and powers are correlated and governed hierarchically by a single general law. Democritus of Abdera (d. 370 BC) developed from that concept the theory of Macrocosm and Microcosm which treated man as a reduced model of the universe, and the universe as the enlarged copy of man. His theory was accepted by Ikhwän al-Safä'. Cf. Omer Α. Farukh, "Ikhwän al-Safä" in History of Muslim Philosoplry, 297. 13 S.H. Nasr, Islamic Cosmological Doctrines, 67f</page><page sequence="5">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWÄN AL-SAFA', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHÄNI 661 The cosmological chain, starting from Unity, which symbolizes the Creator, up to the number 9, which is the domain of the three kingdoms, already contains the basis of the chain of being. The chain of being essentially means that all beings in the Universe exist in a continuous hierarchy, which is ontological as well as cosmological. A particular entity has a position in the great chain of being depending upon the degree to which it participates in Being and Intelligence; or one might say, depending upon the degree to which it possesses the perfections and virtues which in the absolute sense belongs only to Pure Being, or God, who is transcendent with respect to the chain.14 The unity and complexity of his soul and body respectively make him 'the antipode of God'. By virtue of this position, man is the central link in the great chain; below him stands the animal kingdom, and above, the world of the angels, and he is connected to one domain as to the other.15 Thus, the universe is created by God through emanation. God, Who is Unique, without any anthropomorphic element associated with Him, creates the Intellect, which is the first to emanate from Him. This universal Intellect comes directly from God, without any intermediary. God gave it the office of re-emanation from which emanates the universal Soul and the first matter. The rest of creation emerges from this universal Soul , which receives energy from the Intellect. The hierarchy of being descends from the highest heaven nearest to the divine, down to the four elements, which are furthest from the divine. The elements are then mixed in various proportions by the universal Soul to form the three kingdoms of mineral, plant and animal. Man, who is made up of various elements from angel to matter, is the last in the process, but not the furtherst removed from the Divine. This process of effusion, therefore, terminates with man. However, it does not suggest man's inferiority, but defines the sequence of emanation, which specifies that man had to come after the creation of matter in order that he be composed of both the angelic and material elements of the universe. Furthermore, it suggests the special position of man within the emanationist hierarchy, where he stands midway between the animal and angelic kingdom.16 The process of evolution or spiritual return to God requires of man to transcend his terrestrial nature and rise to his more substantial celestial nature. This spiritual ascent to God requires the perfection of the various levels in the chain of being. Each of these levels has an ontological status. In the kingdoms of minerals, plants and animals, good and evil souls are combined: for instance, a plant with a good quality will transmit it to the animal who eats 14 Ibid., 68f. 15 Ibid., 69. 16 Ibid., 69; Omer A. Farrukh, "Ikhwän al-Safä" in History of Muslim Philosophy, 295ff.</page><page sequence="6">662 YASIEN MOHAMED it, and this good flesh in the animal is eaten by man, whose soul in turn is affected by it. The perfect man completes the chain of being, as it is he who will return to his origin. Plants, animals and other beings have been created to serve the final purpose of man, which is his reunion with God. Then only is the purpose of the whole creation realized.17 Man as Microcosm What is meant by the concept that man is a microcosm of the cosmos? It suggests that man is a microcosmic form of the whole universe. That is, both his spiritual and physical dimensions correspond to the physical and spiritual nature of the universe. Thus, Ikhwän al-Safä' refer to man as a 'small world' (al 'älam al-saghïr). As has been mentioned, man stands midway between the animal and angel in the Neoplatonic scheme of emanation. His angehe or spiritual aspect is mixed up with his animal or physical aspect. The latter element makes man an imperfect creature. But even this imperfect aspect emanates from the One, albeit a lower form of existence. It therefore reflects the One imperfectly. It is by virtue of man's spiritual aspect that he is able to transcend the lower levels of his microcosmic reality and evolve spiritually towards the One. So when the human soul is liberated from materiality, it is able to return to God. This does not mean that materiality is wholly evil in the view of Ikhwän al-Safä'. It is indeed imperfect, but is nevertheless a poor reflection of the Divine. Human passion, therefore, which is akin to matter in its inherent imperfection, is not to be obliterated, but to be disciplined and directed to higher ends. And the universe is not to be scorned, but to be respected as sacred, as it also reflects the Divine, albeit in an imperfect form. The devaluation of the cosmos corresponds with its desacralization, which involves divesting it of its spiritual elements. The concept of man as a microcosm of the universe, in the view of Ikhwän al-Safä', therefore, teaches man to adopt a respectful attitude to the totality of man's being, both his material and spiritual aspects. And by doing so, he will also cultivate a respectful attitude to the whole cosmos, to both its physical and metaphysical dimensions. The concept of man as a 'small world', then, has become integral to Ikhwän's cosmological doctrine. In describing how various parts of man correspond to various parts of the universe, Ikhwän al-Safä' demonstrated the connectedness between man and nature. They state that man cannot study the entire universe, for it is too large, but if all its elements are contained within man, he need only look to himself, and he will know the universe in all its dimensions.18 By man coming to realize himself as 17 S.H. Nasr, Islamic Cosmologici Doctrines, 69ff. 18 Ibid. 98.</page><page sequence="7">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWÄN AL-SAFÄ', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHANi a small world, he will not only know the world, but also God. The whole universe has been created to serve man's innate urge to return to the Creator, which means that he should develop a positive and respectful attitude to all aspects of the universe. Ikhwän al-Safä' are very precise and detailed about the resemblance between man and various parts of the universe. His body is a prototype of the physical world (including planets, minerals, plants and animals) and his soul is a prototype of the spiritual world (including angels, jinns and demons).19 Know, when the ancient sages looked at this physical world with their eyes, and witnessed its phenomena with their senses, and contemplate upon its conditions with their intellects, and examine the conduct of the (unique) individualities from the general (species) with their insight, and learn from the arts of its particulars by their reflection, they will not find any part of it more complete in frame, or perfect in form, or more analogous to anything else, than man. Since man is altogether a combination of a physical body and a spiritual soul, they found in the constitution of his bodily frame prototypes of all the existents in the physical world ... [of its spheres, planets, elements, minerals, plants and animals]. They also found the prototype of spiritual creation of its angels, jinns, man and devils, and the souls of the rest of animals, and the powers of creation act freely in the world; they are analogous to the human soul and its powers act freely upon the body. When these matters of the picture of man became clear to them, they named him a small world (al-alam al-saghir).20 Further, they say that the nine substances of the human body (e.g. marrow) are analogous to the nine concentric spheres of the heavens. The twelve signs of the zodiac are analogous to the twelve orifices of the body (e.g. ears, eyes). The seven planets, each with a soul and a body and operating on individual souls or bodies respectively, correspond to the seven bodily powers in man (e.g. attraction, digestion) and the seven spiritual powers (e.g. the five senses, speech and reason). The moon and sun correspond to speech and reason, and as the moon derives its light from the sun, so speech derives its powers from reason. Ikhwän al-Safä' develop the analogy between the four elements and the organs of the body: the head corresponds to fire, the breath to air, the belly to water and the lower abdomen to earth. From these four elements emerge vapours responsible for wind, cloud, rain, minerals, plants and animals.21 19 Ikhwän al-Safä', Rasä'il Ikwän al-Safä' (Cairo: Matba'ah al-'Arabiyyah, 1928), 334f., where maη, the small world (al-'älam al-saghiï) has a dual nature of body and soul, the body is analogous to the city and the soul to the king. Cf. Majid Fakhry, Ethical Theories in Islam (Leiden: Brill, 1994), 96-98. 20 Ikhwän al-Safä', Rasä'il Ikhwän al-Safä', 456, 14-15, 457, 1-13. 21 Ibid., 464ff; cf. Majid Fakhry, Ethical Theories in Islam, 97.</page><page sequence="8">664 YASIEN MOHAMED Following these descriptions, Ikhwan al-Safa' draw analogies between man's body and the physical world: The frame of his body can be compared to the earth: the bones to mountains, the marrow to minerals, the belly to the sea, the intestines to the rivers, the veins to the streams, the flesh to the earth and the hair to plants, the skin where hair grows is like good land, and where no hair grows is like bad land. Man's front corresponds to the east, his back to the west, his right side to the south and his left side to the north. His breathing is like the wind, his speech like thunder, his voice like the bolt of lightning, his laughter like daylight, and his weeping like rain, his despair and grief, like the darkness of night, his sleep is like death; the days of his childhood are like the days of spring, the days of his youth are like the days of summer, his middle-age is like the days of autumn , and his old-age is like the days of winter, and the movements and acts are like the movements of the planets and their turning. Birth and man's appearance are like the rising, his death and disappearance are like the descending.22 Thus, the Ikhwän refer to the world as the 'big man' (al-insän al-kabïr), since its parts correspond, at a macrocosmic level, with the parts of the small man {al-insän al-saghïr). The authors cite many other analogies to illustrate the similarity between man and the world. The interconnections between the universal bodies (simple and complex) and particular bodies in the world are also compared with the government of a city state. This is in keeping with the d'ominant trend of Platonic philosophy, especially in the Timaeus, where the relationship between man and God is not a personal one, but man is viewed as a part of a cosmos and God is seen as a cosmic God. Man's uniqueness as distinguished from the animal is that he can participate in the city state of which he is a citizen. But there is a greater whole of which man is an integral part: that greater whole is God, without whom man's very existence would not be possible. Note the passage below, in which the Ikhwän compare the universal soul with the government of the city: The forces of the Universal Soul from the first to the last pervade (the world) like the government of a city which has walls and in the interior of which there are stopping stations and inns, and city-quarters, where there are lanes and streets and bazaars, and in the midst of which there are habitations and dwellings, in which there are houses and storehouses, in which there are goods, and instruments, and household wares, and vessels, and tools, and utensils. One single king rules over all this, and in this city he has troops and subjects, ra'iyyab, and serfs ... and servants and followers. His decision is valid among his followers and the chiefs of his army and the noble people of the city and the inhabitants of his 22 Ikhwan al-Safa', Rasa'il Ikhwan al-Safa', 466, 16-21; 467, 1-4.</page><page sequence="9">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWAN AL-SAFÄ', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHANi 665 city-state, balad, and the decision of their followers is valid among all those who are below them, down to the last of them.23 The above quotations give us a sense of the way the Ikhwän saw man as a microcosm of the universe. Such perceptions of man, which are central to their theory of emanation, emphasise man's affinity with and proper relation to the cosmic world. Furthermore, it serves to make man realize his need to liberate himself from matter and become a true microcosm. By so doing, he will realise his true essence, return to God, and complete the chain of being. Man's true soul will achieve perfection as part of the cosmos, which is gradually unfolding according to a Neoplatonic scheme of creation. Within this scheme, man seeks to return to his ontological point of origin, God. This is man's spiritual ascent towards perfection. His original descent from divine perfection, which involves a certain level of terrestrial imperfection, is the providential fate of all things. This descent to imperfection is irreversible for all creatures, but not for man. Man has been endowed with reason, which enables him to rectify his imperfection, and to aid his soul's ascent to the One. This process does not merely involve a rational apprehension of cosmological realities, but it requires the knowledge and practice of the good. Man's rational faculty enables him to transcend matter; not the body, which is inferior. Through reason, then, man's soul becomes transformed into a superior ontological entity. Thus, the body and soul are aspects of the human microcosm, and refer to the terrestrial and celestial dimensions of the cosmos respectively. The rational aspect of this human anthropology makes it possible to apprehend the meeting point between the Neoplatonic geography of the cosmos and the moral anthropology of the human microcosm. The Ikhwän influenced later Arabic writers in three respects: first, with reference to their cosmic and immanent view of God; secondly, with respect to their theory of emanation and the order in which the cosmic elements have come into being; and thirdly, with regard to their view of man as a microcosm of the universe. In the next section we turn to the cosmological views of Miskawayh, who adopted the emanationist theory of creation from the Ikhwän. 23 Ikhwän al-Safä', Rasai Ikhwän al-Safa', 3: 215, 222f./ trans., Dieterici, cited in Widengren, "Macrocosmos-Microcosmos: Speculation in the Rasä'il Ikhwän al-Safä' and some Hurüfi Texts", in Archivio di Filosofia Padova, 48 (1980), 299. According to Widengren, this passage was 'undoubtedly inspired by Stoic popular philosophy' and the social structure is depicted as feudalistic.</page><page sequence="10">666 YASIEN MOHAMED II MISKAWAYH Ahmad ibn Muhammad Miskawayh adopted from the Ikhwän their concept of man as a microcosm and their emanationist theory of the universe. Although the two concepts are related, we will first describe his concept of the universe and then his view of man as the microcosm of the universe. The Cosmology of Miskawayh Miskawayh's concept of the universe is set forth in his al-Fawz al-Asghar. According to Badawl, it is similar to al-Fârâbï's Ära' ahi al-madinah al-Fädilah (Opinions of the People of the Virtuous City) in its attempt to reconcile Aristototelian and Neoplatonic elements. Miskawayh's work deals with three main themes: the existence of God, the soul and prophecy. Neoplatonism is clearly evident in his conception of the cosmos, and in chapter 5 he explicitly acknowledges his indebtedness to Porphyry. In chapter 9 he reveals Neoplatonic tendencies in his opinion that the first existent to emanate from God is the Intellect. Miskawayh adopted Neoplatonic ideas from the Ikhwän, particularly with respect to the evolution of being from mineral through vegetable and animal to human, and finally to prophets, who are the highest level of being and who complete the cycle of evolution.24 According to Miskawayh, the universe consists of two different worlds, the celestial and the terrestrial. The former is the world of the stars and the heavens, and the latter, the world of matter and motion. The celestial world emanates from God, while the terrestrial world evolves towards Him. The universe and all that it contains is the creation of God, including the Intellect and the Soul . The first existent to emanate from God is the First Intellect (which is the same as the active intellect). From the First Intellect proceeds a series of emanations to the last stage of primordial elements, from which ensues the beginning of the process of evolution towards God.25 The First Intellect is perfect and immutable, as it comes from the Real Outpourer (Mufìd, Haqìqt) who is also perfect and immutable. It is perfect in relation to inferior beings and imperfect in relation to God. From the First Intellect emanates the celestial Soul, inferior to the Intellect but superior to the natural bodies. From the celestial Soul emanate the spheres. They are imperfect in relation to the celestial Soul, but perfect in relation to the human bodies, which are weak, as they are the last in the chain of creation. Its circular motion assures its 24 'Abd al-Rahman Badawi, "Miskawayh", in M.M.

God is the source and the cause of this emanation; without Him, nothing will exist. There are four stages of development from the mineral, the vegetable, the animal, and finally to the human. The coral, the date-palm and the ape mark the transition from the mineral to vegetable, from vegetable to animal, and from the animal to the human level. The prophet completes the cycle of the chain of being by absorbing the celestial Soul within him.26 This acts as an immanent principle, and although its activity in the world is spontaneous, it involves a fall from the perfect activity of the universal Intellect. The objects of the sensible world have form and matter, matter being only the receptacle for the forms, which emanate from the celestial Soul, as indeed the whole world does. The form flows from the celestial Soul, as the whole world is its creation. Matter obstructs the progress of the Soul, causing imperfection and evil. Individual souls enter the body from outside, and return to their source upon death.27 Every being unites in itself all the antecedent forms of evolution in outline; man as microcosm unites in himself all the forms of mineral, plant and animal life. The child's growth is determined firstly by nature, that is, his/her powers of appetite, anger and sensation; and secondly, he/she is guided by reason. Evolution is the struggle between soul and matter, with the former gradually predominating; the soul comes to realize its own end and destiny, and reason finally triumphs over matter. Every being must realize its own distinctive form. By so doing, it realizes the purpose of its own creation. The last stage in the series of emanations from the primordial One also marks the beginning of the process of evolutionary return to the primal One through the various stages of corporeality and spirit. Abdul Hamid states that this notion of a return to One God is a Qur'änic idea, which holds that everything proceeds from God and returns to Him.28 In surveying the soul's journey through the various stages of being, the biological "evolution" of man also comes into focus. Miskawayh declares that all existence is one whole of which the parts are intimately connected. The whole (of existence) is made of two worlds, the higher of which penetrates and permeates the lower, which is known as the world of becoming. The spirit evolves from the humblest stage of existence, the mineral, through the plant and the animal, to the stage of man and beyond, where man attains his perfection, as in the case of the Prophet, who represents the last stage of human perfection. Man too, evolves 26 'Abd al-Rahmän Badawï, "Miskawayh" in History of Muslim Philosophy, 47 If; M.

In this sense, the animal is superior to the plant, man is superior to the animal, and the prophet is superior to man. There is an intimate connection between any two unequal grades of being: the one stage paves the way for the next. The highest grade of plant, the date-palm, is almost animal-like, and the lowest animal, e.g. the snail, is almost plant-like. Likewise, the highest animal, the ape, is almost man-like, and the lowest type of man is almost animal-like. As some of the characteristics of animals (e.g. movement) were created before the animal stage, so some of the characteristics of man (e.g. intelligence) appeared in a rudimentary form in higher animals before the stage of man was reached. There is an evolution of the spirit as it liberates itself in stages from the prison of matter. The philosopher purges his soul from the impurities of matter through rigorous physical, moral and intellectual discipline; but the prophet receives Divine truths through inspiration.29 Clearly, then, Miskawayh adopted the Neoplatonic view of creation. Creation emanates from God through a series of intermediaries starting from the First Intellect and ending with man, the highest in the chain of being. It is man's challenge to transcend his corporeality and become godlike in order to return to the source of his being, God. This is man's process of becoming. Ansari states that there is a lack of clarity regarding Miskawayh's view on the relation between God and the Intellect. For Plotinus, the Intellect is the mind of The One, but it is above thought. It always contemplates its source and is therefore near God, and it manifests itself in the creation of the Soul. However, Plotinus does not clarify how the Soul proceeds from the Intellect. The relation of the individual soul to the Universal Soul is similarly not clarified or even discussed.30 Although Miskawayh accepts the Neoplatonic hierarchy, as a religious thinker he holds that creation comes from nothing. However, the obscurity in his theory regarding the relation between God, the Intellect and the Soul makes it difficult to discern where he departs from the Neoplatonic view of the cosmos. The Ikhwân held the view that it was the spiritual urge that was the guiding force for evolutionary movement towards God, but Miskawayh took this further by finding in it the basis for his theory of ethics. Thus, for Miskawayh, the scale of spiritual evolution corresponds with the scale of human virtue: the higher the level of virtue, the higher is man in the scale of evolution towards God. The level of human virtue in turn corresponds to the extent to which man perfects his rational faculty. It is this perfection of man's 29 Ibid., 114-124. 30 M. Abdul Haq Ansari, "Miskawayh's Conception of God" in his The Ethical Philosophy of Miskawayh, 134 ff.</page><page sequence="13">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWAN AL-SAFÄ', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHANi 669 rational soul that enables him to act out his role as the vicegerent of God. Nevertheless, Miskawayh shares with the Ikhwân the evolutionary view that every being participates in pure existence in accordance with its potential, from the lowest level of potential in minerals, plants and animals, to the highest level of potential in humans. All beings therefore share, in varying degrees, in the perfection of God.31 Man's distinctive form is his reason. It is that which distinguishes him from the rest of creation. However, man can only realize his reason through the discipline of his desire, anger and senses. Other means helpful to this end are also valued as good.32 We note therefore that Miskawayh adopted from the Ikhwân the emanationist theory of the cosmos and a positive attitude to human passion, which merely requires discipline for it to play a positive role in man's ultimate pursuit of the good. Man as Microcosm The concept of man as a microcosm is not new in the Ikhwân and Miskawayh; it has its roots in Neoplatonic sources,33 but can be traced back to an ancient Indo-Iranian concept.34 Miskawayh adopted this idea from the Ikhwân, but he was less concerned about giving detailed analogies between the various aspects of man and the various aspects of the cosmos. Man as a microcosm, with all the various aspects of his body and soul, resembles various parts of the cosmos. He has to transcend the lower forms of his nature to progress in his spiritual evolution towards God. In chapters 2 and 3 of the al-Fawz al-Asghar, Miskawayh views man as a microcosm of the world, and states that man has parallels with the four elements in the world: Man is a small world ('älam saghïr) and his faculties are inter-connected. He has parallels to all that is in the big world {'älam kablr): to the four elements in the inhabited and uninhabited worlds; on land, sea and mountain; and to inanimate 31 B.H. Siddique, 'Metaphysics of Ibn Miskawayh', in 37-43. 32 Ahmad ibn Muhammad Miskawayh, al-Fawz al-Asghar (Tunis: 1987), 61-110; cf. Khawja Abdul Hamid, Ibn Maskawaih: A Study of his al-Fawz al-Asghar; M. Abdul Haq Ansari, "Miskawayh's conception of God", in The Ethical Philosophy of Miskawayh, 58ff. 33 Jachimowicz, 'Islamic Cosmology', in Ancient Cosmologies, 146. 34 Widengren argues that the doctrine of correspondence between man as a small world and the world as a big man goes back to an ancient Indo-Iranian concept. This correspondence also has an astrological orientation in that every part of the human body is under the protection of one or two zodiac signs; furthermore, the development of the human embryo in every stage is under the protection of a planet. See, G. Widengren, "Macrocosmos-Microcosmos Speculation in the Rasä'il Ikhwän al-Safâ' and some Hurùfï Texts" in Archivio di Filosofia Padova, 305. These speculations are apparently integrated into the Neoplatonic structure of the Ikhwân al-Safâ'.</page><page sequence="14">670 VASIÉN MOHAMED objects, plants and animals, as though he were an abridgement and composition of all that is in it. Some parallels are apparent and some are hidden and obscure.35 Note that Miskawayh does not describe which specific elements within the human microcosm correspond with the four elements in the cosmos. Miskawayh was more concerned with the essential notion of man as "a small world" that reflects the whole universe. Furthermore, he was concerned with how man's realization of himself as a small world leads to his ultimate happiness. Miskawayh was very much concerned here with the notion of microcosm as a means to explain his ethical theory. Following the Neoplatonic fashion, Miskawayh states that man's cognitive perfection is explained in terms of contact (ittisäl) with the intelligible world. When this contact happens, man becomes a microcosm of the world: You become a world apart, and you deserve to be called a small world (microcosm), because the forms of all existing entities would have become realized within you, so that you would have become in a sense identical with them. By your actions you will have arranged them in order in the measure of your capacity, and you will thus become, with respect to them, a deputy of thy Lord, the Creator of all things ... you will then constitute a complete world ... your perfection will have made you ready to receive the divine emanation forever and always you will have come so close to God that no veil should then separate you from Him. ... This is the highest rank and extreme happiness. Were it not possible for the individual person to achieve this rank in himself ... he would have been in the same condition as the individuals of the other animals or as the individual plants .... It would have been impossible for him to achieve eternal existence and everlasting bliss by coming close to God.36 As a true microcosm, then, man will attain ultimate happiness, but he must first perfect himself morally, and must therefore rise above sensory pleasures. By so doing, he joins the higher spiritual realm (al-mala' al-a'lâ), and receives the illumination of the divine light. He partakes of divine perfection, becoming godlike. Miskawayh concludes that this happiness accords with the love of God, which only the truly virtuous and happy man can attain.37 Man will then transcend his mortal self and live a divine life.38 This conception of man as a microcosm of the whole universe is most concisely expressed by Miskawayh, who states: 35 Ahmad ibn Muhammad Miskawayh, al-Fawz al-Asghar, 118, 8-12. 36 Ahmad ibn Muhammad Miskawayh, Tahdhïb al-Akhläq, ed., C. Zurayk (Beirut: al-Jämi'ah al Amrikiyyah, 1966), 41, 11-23, 42, 1-4; trans., Constantine K. Zurayk, The Refinement of Character (Beirut: The American University, 1968), 37f. 37 Ahmad ibn Muhammad Miskawayh, Tahdhïb al-Akhläq, 120-122. 38 Ibid., 152; Majid Fakhry, Ethical Theories in Islam, 12.</page><page sequence="15">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWÄN AL-SAFÄ', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHÄNI 671 ... when man attains perfection, he performs his distinctive activity upon understanding all existents {'ùlama Ί-mawjüdät kullaha). Such a man becomes a mirror picture of the world and deserves to be called microcosm (al-'älam al saghïr). The forms of all existents will become present in him, and he will become identical to them. He will then become a vicegerent of God.39 Man is potentially a microcosm, but by his reason he is able to reach a level where he realises this potential, becoming a true microcosm. This is not merely a process of rationality and apprehension of reality, but it involves a knowledge of the good, and a purification of the soul through the pursuance of good. So when man fully realizes his potential to be a microcosm, he becomes identical with nature, becomes godlike, and attains supreme happiness. The concept of man as the microcosm of the world is also identical to that of the Ikhwän, but Miskawayh does not follow the style of Ikhwän, which is to provide detailed descriptions of the affinity between man and nature. Like the Ikhwän, Miskawayh propounds a theory of evolution that has four stages: from the mineral, to the plant, to the animal and finally to man. For man to fully realize the microcosm within himself, he has to become identical to the whole of creation, from the minerals to the angels. Without this similarity and connection with nature, man cannot become godlike, nor can he attain supreme happiness. Herein lies the link between man as a microcosm and his spiritual evolution. He has to fully realize his microcosmic state to become harmonious with the rest of the creation; his sense of connectedness with nature will enable him to reach the end of his spiritual evolution and attain complete happiness. Thus, the Ikhwän and Miskawayh have at least four points in common: the concept of the emanation of creation from God, the concept of spiritual evolution towards God, the concept of man as the microcosm of the universe, and the notion that the soul returns to its Creator and attains happiness with its increasing purification from the impurity of matter and worldly pleasures. m AL-RÄGHIB AL-ISFAHÄN! The Cosmology of al-Isfahânï Husayn ibn Muhammad Al-Räghib al-Isfahäni incoporated some aspects of Miskawayh's cosmology, but under the influence of the Qur'än he developed 39 Ahmad ibn Muhammad Miskawayh, Tahdhib al-Akhlaq, 41, 4-20.</page><page sequence="16">672 VASIÉN MOHAMED a concept of God that is more transcendent and more personal. His creationist view of the cosmos enables man to have a direct relationship with God, as there are no intermediaries between man and God. The Creation of Man and the Cosmos Al-Isfahânï departs from the emanationist view of the world as conceived by Ikhwän al-Safâ' and Miskawayh. God to him is not immanent in the Neoplatonic sense, He is a transcendant God and a personal God to which man can turn directly for guidance. Although God is transcendent, the creation is not detached from Him, but it is a Divine expression, with all its natural, human and supernatural forms. These forms are differentiated in time and space, and are not part of the process of emanation. Al-Isfahânï views God as the Creator of the universe in four respects. First, He created the heavens and the earth out of nothing, with no intermediaries; secondly, angels helped Him perfect what is imperfect; thirdly, by using natural elements such as fire, He was able to effect certain functions; and fourthly, He created man's faculty for the cultivation of crafts and manual occupations. Through it, man can act as a vicegerent of God to cultivate the earth and build a civilization.40 Al-Isfahânï contends that the Creator is omnipresent. Although there is no reason for His presence, he is the reason for all that is present. Creation comprises two categories: the higher beings that have intellect and the lower beings that have instinct. The higher beings were created first, starting with the Universal Intellect. From this Universal Intellect originated the human intellect.41 Then God brought into existence the four inorganic elements (fire, water, air and earth), the organic elements, and animals. He made everything in pairs. By Friday evening God had shaped the human form from clay. God states that Adam was made human through seven grades: he was [first] created from dust,42 then from clay43 ( a combination of dust and water); then from mud moulded into shape (which is clay altered slightly by air); then from sticky clay (suggesting the clay's readiness to receive form); then from sounding clay (indicating dryness and the emission of sound); and then from mud moulded into shape (indicating a kind of pottery made with fire from which emerged man's satanic power). Thus God said: "He created man from hard clay, like bricks. And He created the jinn from tongues of fire" (Qur'än 55: 14-15). Satan's essence is a flame without a body. God then perfected man, 40 Al-Räghib al-Isfahäni, Tafsll al-Nash'atayn wa Tabsïl al-Sa'ädatayn, ed., 'Abd al-Majxd Najjar (Beirut: Dar al-Gharb al-Islämi, 1988), 105ff. 41 Al-Räghib al-Isfahäni, Tafsïl al-Nash'atayn wa Tahsïl al-Sa'ädatayn, 69. 42 Al-Qur'än 3: 59, 18: 37, 30: 20, 35: 11,10: 67. 43 Al-Qur'än 6: 2, 7: 12, 23: 12, 3: 27, 37: 11, 17: 61.</page><page sequence="17">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWÄN AL-SAFÄ', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHANÎ 673 blowing His spirit into him: 'When your Lord said to the angels: "I am going to create a mortal out of clay, when I have fashioned him and breathed into him of My Spirit, fall prostrate before him'" (Qur'ân 38: 71-72). These, according to the Qur'ân, are the seven stages of development from conception to the emergence of the human soul. The latter is perfected through knowledge and good manners, as God states: "And He taught Adam all the names" (Qur'än 2: 31).44 Man too has been created in seven stages: "We have created man from an extract of clay; then We placed him as a sperm in a secure place; then we created out of the sperm a clot; then made from the clot a lump of flesh, then made the lump of flesh into bones, and then covered the bones with flesh; then fashioned him into another creation" (Qur'ân 23: 12-14). The expression "another creation" suggests that God has created a special being with the faculties of intellect, thought and speech.45 From the foregoing discussion, we note that Isfahan! has a Qur'änic perspective on the creation of Adam. Through a process of seven stages before birth, the material and spiritual elements of a human being are shaped. Al Isfahânï agrees with the Neoplatonic view of man as the last in the order of creation, but disagrees with its contention that the order of creation was an emanation from the First Intellect. As mentioned above, al-Isfahânï holds that creation came directly from God without any intermediaries. Thus, al-Isfahânï also differs from Ikhwân al-Safâ' and Miskawayh in this respect. Man's "Evolution" and his Distinguishing Feature From the above we note that al-Isfahânï expounds on the sequence of the creation, and of particular importance is that man was made of both the material elements of the creation and the celestial elements. He however, did not follow the emanationist scheme of creation. The notion that man comes from God, and he must return to Him is taken from the Qur'än. Man's ascent to God through a process of spiritual evolution, therefore, is accepted in principle by al-Isfahânï. But, like man's creation, his spiritual evolution also does not follow the Neoplatonic hierachical scheme as we show in the following paragraphs. Man begins as a "dead substance", then evolves into a plant, then into an animal and then to the human level. By using his rational faculty, man, despite his dependence on nature, liberates himself from attachments to matter and 44 Al-Räghib al-Isfahäni, Tafsïlal-Nash'atayn wa Tahsïlal-Sa'ädatayn, 73f. 45 Ibid., 74. The editor of tili s text suggests that al-Isfahânï's identification of thought with 'another creation' would make sense of the verse refers to seven stages of development after birth. Thus, if al-Isfahänl had to identify thought as a potentiality within the foetus it might have made more sense.</page><page sequence="18">674 Y ASIEN MOHAMED sensory pleasures.46 Al-Isfahânï, therefore, agrees with the Neoplatonic view of the affinity between man and nature, the role of the intellect in liberating man from dependence on the senses, and its guidance in his spiritual ascent to God. However, al-Isfahânï does not conceive of this spiritual ascent within the "chain of being" of the emanationist process of evolution. There seems to be in al-Isfahânï's view no idea of direct participation of each level of being in the creation of a higher level than itself, Unking ultimately to God. In this respect he differs from Ikhwän al-Safä' and Miskawayh. Like Ikhwän al-Safä' and Miskawayh, holds that man and nature are similar, and there is a corresponding relation between man's spiritual development and the various dimensions of the cosmos. There is, in fact, an interdépendance of the spiritual and material elements of the world. The higher beings are dependent on the lower elements: for example, man needs animals and animals need plants. Man is the highest creation, and the intellect is the highest element within man. All other beings serve man, and all other elements (including animals, plants, etc.) serve the intellect. Therefore, it is said that the whole world is made to serve man and, while he is on earth, man requires the material elements to serve him, as his body is required to serve his soul. The concept of microcosm illustrates the link between man and nature, the dependence of the higher beings on the lower beings and the process of spiritual evolution of the lower beings towards the higher beings. The notions of microcosm and evolution are taken from Ikhwän al-Safä' and Miskawayh, but al-Isfahânï weaves it into another theoretical framework, namely, that of creation proceeding from God without the intermediaries of emanation. Man as a Microcosm47 Al-Isfahânï adopted the notion of the microcosm from Miskawayh, but his illustrations that compare man with nature are not from Miskawayh. No such analogies are to be found in Miskawayh. In this section we shall limit our discussion to al-Isfahânï's concept of man as a microcosm. The following passage shows how al-Isfahânï adopted the concept of man as a microcosm and placed it within a different context; that is, he believed that man as a microcosm of the larger world is endowed with an affinity to 44 For a further confirmation of man's connectedness and dépendance on nature see the Translation below al-Isfahânï regards desire as essential for worship. We note that he accepts the notion of microcosm, indicating his connection and dependence on nature. 47 On al-Isfahânï's concept of microcosm and its comparison with Miskawayh and Ikhwän al Safâ', see, Yasien Mohamed, "Knowledge and Purification of the Soul: An Annotated Translation with Introduction of Isfahäni's Kitäb al-Dhafi'a ilâ Makârim al-Sharï'a (58-76; 89-92JT, 1-34.</page><page sequence="19">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWAN AL-SAFA', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHANÏ 675 nature and to the cosmos. An understanding of this affinity leads to an understanding of man, of nature, and ultimately of God. The sages said: God created man into a sensory, intelligent constitution conforming to the pattern of this world. He brought him into being resembling everything in the world; thus, it is said, he is "a small world", a microcosm of the big world. That is so, to guide man to the knowledge of the world, for, and through them, he is led to the knowledge of their Creator. The divine purpose of man's knowledge of God is to know the world, that it is created, and therefore must have a creator unlike it. God the most High is above them all.48 This is the cosmological way of knowing God. It is a logical way based on the observation of nature. It is the way of reason. The wisdom of being a microcosm is to know the world: for to know the world is to know God. Knowledge of God can also be achieved through the knowledge of the soul, which leads to knowledge of the world, which in turn leads to a knowledge of God. Thus the purpose of creating man as a microcosm is confirmed in al Tafsìl, where he states, "The human soul combines the existents of the world ... whoever knows the existents knows his soul". Furthermore (commenting on Chapter 30, verse 8), he states that "if men had to reflect upon their souls they would know the realities of the existents of creation, both transitory and permanent".49 Therefore, with knowledge of his soul (rüh), man will have knowledge of the spiritual world and its permanence (baqä'uhü); and with knowledge of his body, man will have knowledge of the physical world and its transience.50 As in Ikhwän al-Safâ' and Miskawayh, there is clearly an affinity between man and nature. As a microcosm, both man's soul and body correspond to the spiritual and bodily aspects of the universe. Whereas in al-DharVah, al-Isfahanï introduces the notion of microcosm in the context of the way to knowledge of God, it is in al-Tafsïl that he really expands on this concept in a manner resembling the Rasä'il. Man as a microcosm is a small model of the big world, which is the whole of creation. That is, he shares similar qualities with the rest of the world. Both his body 48 Al-Râghib al-Isfahânî, al-Dharï'ah ilä Makàrim al-SharVah (Cairo: Dar al-Sahwah, 1985), 76, 9 13; 202. Al-Isfahânï states: "God created a small world for every person, both of his body and his soul, and He brought into being in man, an example of every existent in the big world" (ibid.). 49 Al-Râghib al-Isfahâni, Tafsïl al-Nash'atayn wa Tahsïl al-Sa'âdatayn, 62; cf. al-Isfahânï, al Dbarï'ah ilä Makârim al-SharVah, 202. 50 Ibid., 76. 9-10.

Cf. al-Isfahânï, Tafsïl al-Nask'atayn wa Tabsïl al Sa'âdatayn, 76, 8-9, where al-Isfahânï also uses the term mukhtasar. Miskawayh uses the term 'âlam saghïr.</page><page sequence="20">676 YASIEN MOHAMED and soul can be likened to the larger world. His physical qualities resemble some plants and minerals and his moral qualities resemble some animals. However, it is significant that, unlike Ikhwän al-Safâ', al-Isfahânï cites many verses from the Qur'än to give the concept an Islamic orientation. Thus, he states that man is a composition of the elements of the world; God created him after the existence of these things: "Who fashioned well everything He created, and originated the creation of man from clay" (Qur'än 32: 7). God has combined within man the simple elements of the world as well as the complex elements, its spiritual aspect and earthly things. Therefore it is said, man is a microcosm (mukhtasar) of the world. This may be compared to an abridged version of a book: the words are fewer, but the meaning is the same. Man is made out of the best of the earth. He is like butter in buttermilk, and oil in sesame seed oil. There is nothing in the world that does not resemble him. Thus, he is like the elements in respect of his heat, cold, moisture and aridness, like minerals in respect of what the body is, like plants in respect of what he eats and looks after, like animals in respect of what he senses, imagines and experiences: like the lion in respect of his annoyance and anger, like Satan in respect of his capacity for error, and like the angels in his knowledge of God, worship and vicegerency. He is also like the Preserved Τ ablet on which God has crystallized all wisdom, and like the pen where God has confirmed with His speech the form of things in the hearts of people, as the pen confirms the wisdom of the Preserved Tablet.51 Thus, man and the world resemble each other, as it is said, "Man is a small world, and the world is a big man". Thus man, the small world, resembles the big world, including, minerals, plants, animals, angels, Satan, and the Preserved Τ ablet of God. The following passage describing man as a microcosm reveals that he is also a receptacle for all the good and bad qualities of the world. Distinctive features of all aspects of creation are to be found within man, who can take on these various forms in different degrees and times. Isfahânï explains that at times man can be like a praiseworthy or a blameworthy animal, sometimes like an angel, at other times like a devil. "The potentials united within man make him a vessel for the good qualities of the world: its natural forms, its minerals and its spiritual realities; thus, he is a combination of all of these minerals, plants, animals, beasts, devils and angels. Thus, he can manifest within him the distinguishable feature of all these".52 This kind of detailed description of the material, moral and spiritual qualities of man and their mirror image in the form of plants, animals, devils and angels is to be found neither in Miskawayh's Tabdhlb nor in his Fawz al asghar. The author of these two works was more concerned with 51 Al-Raghib al-Isfahanï, Tafsïlal-Nash'atayn wa Tahsïl al-Sa'adatayn, 76f. 52 Ibid., 84, 10-11; 86,1-2.</page><page sequence="21">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWÄN AL-SAFA', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHANi 677 philosophically describing the theory of emanation and the process of evolution back to the One source. Al-IsfahänI's description of the microcosm resembles that of Ikhwän al-Safä'. He must have been inspired by them, as he uses similar analogies to confirm the intimate affinity between man and the cosmos. An important difference is that Ikhwän al-Safä' pay much more attention to comparing man's physical features with the physical features of the universe. Whereas al-Isfahänl concentrates on similarities between man and nature to bring out the moral qualities of man in relation to the universe. The passage below looks at the moral and theological characteristics that man shares with the plants and animals. Thus, there are some people who are as tyrannical as the lion, as scornful as the wolf, and false as the fox, as wicked as the pig, as submissive as the dog, as collective as the ants, as impudent as the fly, as stupid as the donkey, as meek as the faithful bird, as skilful as the wild ass, as proud as the lion, as jealous as the cock, and cooing as softly as the dove. Some possess beautiful outward appearance while the inner appearance is like the atraj tree. Conversely to that are those who are like the gall nuts (oak apples) and acorns: ugly in appearance, but whose demeanour inside is like nuts and almonds; and those with beautiful appearance, but whose demeanour inside is like the khandal and the daffoli. The good believer (compared) with animals, is like the bee that takes the good from the trees, not plucking their fruit, not breaking the tree, nor harming other humans. It benefits man most, sweet its taste, pleasant its smell. And (compared) with trees, it is like the Atraj tree: pleasant its blooming fruit, wood, leaves, smell, and taste. The hypocrite and the wicked, (compared) with animals, are akin to the louse and the termite; and (compared) with trees, are like weeds with no origin, leaves, fresh air, shade, or flower. Its fruit are spoilt, trees dry; they are like fruit with few leaves, many thorns, and difficult to reach.53 In a manner resembling the style of Ikhwän al-Safä', who compared the universal Soul with the government of the soul, al-Isfahänl compares man with the social and political stratification of a country: Philosophers have related many examples of man's essence and its faculties; they illustrate what can only be perceived by the intellect through a sensory picture that approximates human understanding: They said: As a small world54, man, as mentioned, is compared to a country-its structure is firm, buildings erect, walls fortified, streets designed, places divided, houses inhabited, paths travelled, rivers flow, and workers employed.55 53 Al-Räghib al-Isfahänl, al-Dharï'ah iläMakänm al-Sharï'ah, 166, 2-15. 54 Ibid., 103, for reference to man as a small world.

See also, Ibid., 67 for a similar idea. 55 Al-Räghib al-Isfahânï, Tafsìl al-Nash'atay wa Tahsïl al-Sa'ädatayn, 92f.; cf. al-Dbarï'ah ilä Makärim al-Sharï'ah, 103, for similar analogies in a slightly different context.</page><page sequence="22">678 Y ASIEN MOHAMED One may conclude that al-Isfahânï adopted the notion of man as microcosm from Ikhwän al-Safä', and that his analogies comparing man with nature resemble those expressed in Rasa'il of Ikhwän al-Safä'. However, while Miskawayh conceives of the microcosm in the context of the theory of emanation, al-Isfahânï employs it within the framework of a theory of creation. It is, first, a means for arriving at the knowledge of God, and secondly, it reveals the ethical qualities of man, which correspond with the various beings within creation. Ikhwän al-Safä', Miskawayh and Isfahânï share the same view of man as microcosm, but they approach it in different ways. The Ikhwän's theory of Ikhwän al-Safä' is viewed within the context of emanationistic cosmology. Detailed and precise aspects of man, his body and soul are compared with the spiritual and material dimensions of the universe. These similes and images of man and the cosmos recur in different forms throughout the Rasa'il. Miskawayh adopts the same notion of man as a small world, making it integral to his cosmological world view, but he does not offer any vivid images or similes to illustrate it. Al-Isfahânï's microcosm does not fit into an emanationistic perspective: the affinity between man and nature is established through the microcosm, and so is man's dependence on the creation. The notion of microcosm is also employed as a rational way of arriving at knowledge of God and increasing man's faith in Him. Unlike Miskawayh, al Isfahânï provides vivid examples to illustrate man as a microcosm of the universe, making the Rasa'il the model for his style. Conclusion Al-Isfahânï was fascinated by two main elements in al-Ikhwän's and Miskawayh's emanationist concept of creation: first, the concept of man as a microcosm of the universe, and secondly, the hierarchical view of creation where man, although superior, was created last after the minerals, plants and animals. At variance with the Neoplatonic theory, Isfahânï viewed the cosmos as having been created by a transcendent God, the source of all things, including man. Although al-Isfahânï perceives the world as a direct creation of God, and not the product of emanation from universal Intellect, he nevertheless shares other notions with Ikhwän al-Safä' and Miskawayh. First, he accepts the Intellect as the first thing created, but not the view that the creation emanated from it. Secondly, he adopts the notion of microcosm from Ikhwän al-Safä', and (unlike Miskawayh) also imitates their style in employing analogies to show the similarities between man and the world. Al-Isfahânï's analogies compare man with every aspect of the cosmos, including minerals and insects. These analogies are not used merely for</page><page sequence="23">THE COSMOLOGY OF IKHWAN AL-SAFÄ', MISKAWAYH AND AL-ISFAHANÍ 679 stylistic embellishment, but it is an attempt to show the affinity between man and nature and the various elements that make up human nature. Another implication of this affinity is the concept of man as the vicegerent of God. Al-IsfahanI adopted the notion of the order of creation and spiritual progress, with man emerging first from minerals, then plants, and then animals, followed by his rise to the level of the angels and the Divine.

He is able to apprehend the deeper meaning of nature only because he can apprehend the inner depths of his own being. @ @</page></plain_text>
