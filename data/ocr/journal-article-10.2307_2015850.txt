David Hume did not make it easy for any one to accomplish the purpose which M. Leroy has in view in this book, that is, to under- stand his attitude toward religion. Indeed, it has seemed to many who would like to know what that attitude was that Hume delib- erately raised a dust so that no one should see too well. For his most extended discussion of the arguments concerning the existence and nature of God he chose the dialogue form, and on the surface, at least, it is as inconclusive as dialogue is likely to be. The skep- tical Philo has the better of the argument so far as logic goes, finding damaging objections to every proposition brought forward by the rationalistic Cleanthes or by Demea, the churchman, who finds faith the only escape from the unsatisfactory ways of reason. Yet in the last dialogue, Philo confesses that he can not doubt the existence of God-for "to be a philosophical sceptic is, in a man of letters, the first and most essential step towards being a sound, believing Chris- tian." The conclusion of the dialogue only adds to the uncertainty, for the narrator comments: "I cannot but think that Philo's prin- ciples are more probable than Demea's; but that those of Cleanthes approach still nearer to the truth." Hume meant, as he said in a letter to a friend, to make Cleanthes the hero of the dialogue, but he has done so only by allowing Philo to give up his dialectical victory. Was this a mere concession to the prevailing religious conventions, or does it have significance as a revelation of Hume's own position? M. Leroy discusses the question and presents his solution with a subtlety and a modesty suited to the character of the problem. His conclusions come as his own impressions following a most careful study of all of Hume's work in its historical setting. He presents a detailed exposition of all of Hume's writings which bear on religion with their difficulties clearly faced. As a consequence, his work is of the greatest value to those who are interested in the question he discusses, even if his conclusion is not accepted in its entirety. In this field a demonstrative exposition is not possible, yet the impres- sion which Hume 's work makes on a scholar who has given it much careful study is in itself of value. The analysis of Hume 's work is preceded by a detailed account of the influences under which Hume formulated his philosophical views. There is a valuable section on the influence of the classical and the French writers, an aspect of Hume's intellectual biography which has been too much neglected. The author points out inter-</page><page sequence="2">244 JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY esting parallels between Hume and Cicero and Hume and Bayle. Rather surprisingly little mention is made of Malebranche, al- though there are most obvious similarities between his treatment of causation and that given by Hume. M. Leroy cites Fe'nelon and Sherlock as predecessors of Hume in holding that we have no direct experience of necessary connection in the action of the will upon the body. Yet Malebranche is even more explicit upon this point. A rather long section on the orthodox and the deistic rationalists in England is clear and adequate without presenting anything new. There are interesting comments on Hume's relation to both Butler and Berkeley. "fHume s'oppose en effet a Butler pour toutes les affirmations essentielles, bien qu'il paraisse s'etre inspire de I'Ana- logie pour poser les problemes" (p. 184). M. Leroy gives a careful analysis of Hume 's general philo- sophical position with a desirable emphasis on the functions of the imagination and of habit. He then turns to his basic problem: what was Hume's considered attitude toward religion? He believes that the answer is to be found in Hume's significant and positive con- tribution to the solution of philosophic problems, his doctrine of conventionalism, which he applied to speculative knowledge, to morals, and to religion. M. Leroy first states clearly the difficulties of interpretation which Hume's writings on religious subjects present. He points out that in each of them there is an impasse, a contradiction between the course of the argument and the apparent conclusion. In the Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion, the argument leads to a positivistic attitude which then seems to be rejected. Philo (whom Leroy identifies with Hume) concludes that skeptical reason, which he so well represents, can not hold its ground against religious belief since the latter not only has some plausible arguments in its favor but rests on natural propensity and education as well. He concludes that it is a natural sentiment to wish that heaven might vouchsafe to dissipate our ignorance by a revelation which would discover God. M. Leroy thinks that the conclusion of the essay Of Miracles is entirely analogous. flume attacks the validity of the evidence for the miraculous and then seems to abandon the whole point of his argument in an appeal to miracle. Leroy rejects two possible inter- pretations: that Hume is falling back insincerely on an oratorical device to avoid criticisms; and that the works on religion are merely clever mosaics without a consistent point of view. He turns to the Natural History of Religion and finds there a further dilemma, but also the hint of a solution which he believes is borne out by Hume's writings on morals and on human nature. The conclusion of the history seems to be that the only choice in</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 245 matters of religion lies between scepticism and superstition. Yet Hume has developed in this work, the conception that the develop- ment of religion is due to the action of certain fundamental, per- manent principles of the imagination, the same principles which are responsible for the formulation of the laws of science. This attitude M. Leroy calls conventionalism and finds it to be the clue to Hume's attitude toward the entire religious question. When the sceptic approaches religious problems, he finds that ex- perience will support either the mechanistic hypothesis or the re- ligious one. The first is more satisfying as a rational explanation, but the second has the advantage of being more adapted to human needs. A miracle might give a decision between the two, but neither an external marvel nor a mystic experience could establish itself beyond the possibility of doubt. The sceptic is, therefore, incapable of deciding between the rival hypotheses. Yet he is not always the philosopher; he is often the man. Then anthropomorphic theism forces itself upon him because it satisfies both his reason and his feeling. Yet he is still mistrustful and reduces his theism to a bare formula. At the same time he makes a spontaneous appeal to a revelation, an inner experience comparable to the experience which lies at the basis of science. This appeal to miracle is an expression of natural sentiments and perhaps it is the manifestation of a reality inaccessible to intelligence. Telle est 1 'attitude de Hume; c lest avant tout un fervent de science ex- p6rimentale et il rejette toute explication qui ne se fait pas par les causes et les conditions; mais il connait la valeur de cette science experimentale qui, con- stitude par des hommes, n'est qu'une science humaine et n 'exprime vraisembla- blement pas la r6alit6 objective telle qu 'elle est. Par suite, 1 'explication religieuse anthropomorphique conserve une valeur, non pas sous sa forme grossi6re, mais sous une forme 6puree; il n'est pas sfir que la foi nous permette d-'atteindre par un Elan sentimental 1'essence meme de toute realite et de com- munier en Dieu; du moins rien ne lui interdit cette esp6rance ni les supercheries des fanatiques, ni les illusions des enthousiastes: et nous pouvons r6ver d'urie experience mystique qui, en ellememe, n'est pas impossible [p. 369]. . . . Mais qu'on ne s'y trompe pas, le sourire moqueur du seeptique cache une esperance qui n'ose slavouer; la science ne ruine pas toute croyance. Par cette attitude, Hume est le pr6curseur d'un etat d'ame tres frequent de nos jours; c'est par une anticipation qu'il clot la querelle deiste et c'est pourquoi son role est im- portant dans 1'histoire des idWes: une nouvelle orientation spirituelle se dessine qui plus tard as pr6cisera [p. 370]. It is clear that M. Leroy's solution depends fundamentally upon his conception that Hume held the laws of science to be conventions, not only in the sense that they are human formulations, but also that they fail in some way to describe accurately the character of reality. If that was Hume's view, he might plausibly hold that revelation had a place beside science as additional experience.</page><page sequence="4">246 JOURNAL OF PIILOSOPHY On this point it does not seem to me that M. Leroy has made out his case. Conventionalism is clearly expressed in Hume's treatment of morals; it is equally evident in the Natural History of Religion. Here the evidence is complete. But in what sense can it be said that Hume considered the laws of science to be conventions? He insisted certainly that they were a resultant of the operations of the human imagination and of human experience. In that sense any human formulation must be a human convention, one as truly as another. But if we include the idea of inaccuracy as an essential part of the conventional, Hume, it seems to me, did not hold that the laws of nature were in that class. AI. Leroy seems to use first one interpre- tation and then the other. For instance, he refers (p. 220) to the passage in the Enquiry in which Hume, after discussing the origins of belief, concludes: "Here then, is a kind of pre-established harmony between the course of nature and the succession of our ideas; and though the powers and forces by which the former is governed, be wholly unknown to us; yet our thoughts and conceptions have still, we find, gone on in the same train with the works of nature." Surely there is no question of inaccuracy here. M. Leroy, furthermore, points out that, according to Hume, all reasoning, good or bad, is due to the imagination acting according to more or less variable principles. He adds "La valeur de la science experimentale lui vient de sa rigueur et de sa precision, et non de ce qu'elle ferait intervenir des facultes superieures a l'imag- ination. Raisonner correctement, c'est donner aux objets les rap- ports qu'ils ont entre eux dans 1'experience." This seems again to recognize that Hume considered the laws of nature to be accurate representation of the course of nature as it enters human experience. Any reality more ultimate but not re- vealed to human experience was, of course, for Hume's positivistic philosophy, beyond knowledge. Yet, if I have understood him rightly, MI. Leroy seems in his conclusion to turn to another interpretation. He states there that, for Hume, science does not express accurately objective reality as it is. Two earlier comments refer to the point in such a way as to suggest that he means by objective reality not an ultimate lack of experience, but the ordinary course of nature. Elles [beliefs] ont un fondement objectif; mais sans doute, comme less erreurs et les prejuges resultent du jeu des memes facult6s que les lois scien- tifiques, devons nous admettre que les unes et les autres, bien qu'en rapport anree la r6alit6, ne la traduisent pas de maniere compl6tement desintoressee et que, pour employer un mot que nous retrouverons et qui me parait traduire avee exactitude la pensee de fume, les unes et les autres sont autant de conventions humaines, mais plus ou moins soigneusement etablies [pp. 235-236].</page><page sequence="5">BOOK REVIEWS 247 If Hume hoped for a revelation which would reveal reality, it was not, it seems to me, upon the ground that the laws discovered in science were inaccurate in their own realm but that experience as it stands is incapable of revealing anything beyond itself. The sceptic Hume may have concluded, therefore, with Philo that the evidence for design is sufficient to render plausible a belief "that the cause or causes of order in the universe probably bear some re- mote analogy to human intelligence" and that there is this much place for faith in addition to science. He may have found this solution satisfying to both his reason and his sentiments. M. Leroy has made a good case for such an interpretation which will stand without the assumption of conventionalism. I find it difficult to take as seriously as does M. Leroy Hume's expressed desire for a revelation, a mystic experience, particularly in view of the tone of the essay on miracles, in which one such appeal is made. With regard to a difference of impression on so ambiguous a point we may accept Hume's dictum that "reasonable men may be allowed to differ, where no one can be reasonably positive." M. Leroy has given an example of the candid and illuminating way in which an intricate and confusing matter of interpretation may be handled. MARY SHAW KUYPERS.
