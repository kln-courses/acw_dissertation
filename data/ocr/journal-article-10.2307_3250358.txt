<plain_text><page sequence="1">BIBLIOGRAPHIA The Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities Stockholm, Bulletin Nr. 7. Stockholm, 193 . 225 pp. The present volume of the Stockholm Museum Bull- etin, which has quickly developed into one of the leading and most important journals of Far Eastern archaeology and philology, is dedicated to Sven Hedin in honour of his seventieth birthday. The volume is an adequate gift to the great explorer who has done so much to further the interest in Eastern and Central Asian studies throughout Europe, but especially in his own country. It contains the following articles: I) J. G. Andersson, The Goldsmith in Ancient China. pp. I -38. This investigation which was first published in the separate volume "Yin and Chou Researches" has al- ready been closely dealt with by Professor Otto Fischer on p. 146 of the precedent volume of Artibus Asiae. Andersson has been able to prove that bronzes in- laid with gold and silver as well as with precious stones seem to go back as far as the Yin dynasty and were certainly abundant during the period of the so-called Huai style. Thus the opinion held until now by most Western scholars that inlaid bronzes only came in vogue as late as the Han dynasty is no longer tenable and the old Chinese opinion that they are far older is completely justified (comp. pp. 4 and 34). The same result has of late been achieved in other fields of Chinese archaeology and is a warn- ing against arbitrary deviations from established dat- ings. The same, by the way, holds good of the dat- ing of ancient books, as has been especially shown by Karlgren's investigations. 2) 0. Karlbeck, Anyang Moulds. pp. 39 - 60. Karlbeck's researches have brought to light a large number of fragments belonging to Yin moulds used for casting bronzes. His careful investigations prove the fact established by Perceval Yetts that as early as the Yin dynasty two methods of casting bronze were in vogue the well-known process called cire- perdue and another one in which permanent moulds were already used. 3) 0. Karlbeck, Anyang Marble Sculptures. pp. 6 1-69. Deals with some marble sculptures, in all probability Yin, which have found their way to the Stockholm museum. The most interesting piece is a marble tripod decorated with a monster which shows a strange likeness to a figure half human and half animal which adorns a bronze drum in the Sumitomo collection. Probably both are representations of an old divinity which seems to have been in a state of transition from the theriomorphic to the anthropomorphic stage of conception. 4) F. Bergman, Lou-lan Wood Carvings and Small Finds Discovered by Sven Hedin. pp. 7I-144. The documents, chiefly in Chinese, which Hedin had brought from the ruins of Lou-lan he discovered in 1900, were published in I920 by Conrady, together with some of Hedin's minor archaeological finds. But the larger objects found by Hedin have hitherto re- mained unpublished, and also of the smaller objects, 239</page><page sequence="2">a comparatively large number has not yet been dealt with. Bergman devotes this beautifully illustrated mon- ograph to them. The bigger finds chiefly consist in carved wooden beams and other wooden carvings found in the ruins of a small Buddhist temple. Some of them represent human beings, whereas others are of a merely ornamental character. They belong, of course, to the art of Gandhara, but some show a marked Iranian influence. They are the oldest hither- to known remains of Buddhist art from this part of Central Asia. The smaller finds seem to go back to different periods. Some of them may belong to the stone age, such as the microlithic objects resembling those found near Lake Lopnor and in Ordos. Several stone axes closely resemble those discovered by An- dersson at Sha-kuo-t'un in Fengt'ien and may there- fore belong to the Neolithic age. The remains of pottery discovered are of doubtful date, but possibly only go back to the time of the Chinese invasion. As kilns have been discovered, they seem to have been fabricated by Chinese settlers. The coins and metal objects have already been described by Conrady, but Bergman gives a number of valuable additions and supplementary remarks referring to similar finds from different regions made during the last years, which may help to ascertain the provenance and use of the objects found and to get a closer knowledge of the flourishing trade on the silk roads of Central Asia during the early Middle ages. 5) G. Montell, Sven Hedin's Archaeological Collection from Khotan. pp. I45 -2 I. In 1896, Sven Hedin discovered near Khotan two early mediaeval sites, Yotkan and Dandan-Uiliq, which among other antiquities yielded a large number of terra-cotta sculptures, of which only a few have been published. Montell devotes a systematic study to them, illustrated by numerous reproductions, and quotes the entire literature which may give help to- wards explaining them. As no systematic excavations have been made, but the whole material is due to accidental discoveries, only provisional opinions as to the date, the meaning and the cultural connections of the finds can be given. The descriptions are very detailed and conscientious, and nothing which may help to elucidate the antiquities has been neglected. The numerous figures of human and animal shape are of special interest. Among the latter, the large number of monkeys represented in every imaginable posture is conspicuous. Perhaps some of them may have been intended as caricatures of human beings, but of others, especially the erotic representations, the author, though with great reserve, thinks it possible that they may have served as amulets against evil influences in the same manner as similar subjects are used in North China and among many other nations. The Museum of Far Eastern Antiquities Stockholm, Bulletin Nr. 8. Stockholm, 1936. S81 pp. This volume has been entirely written by Karlgren and contains two most important contributions to- wards the elucidation of ancient Chinese civilization. The first essay, which has also been published in the separate volume mentioned above, has been reviewed by Professor Fischer, 1. c. pp. 145146. So only some additions to this review which represents an archaeo- logist's opinion will here be given from a philologist's point of view. i) B. Karlgren, Yin and Chou in Chinese Bronzes. pp. 9- 54. Starting from the assumption that the views express- ed by Chinese archaeologists on the age of bronzes generally attributed to the Yin or Chou times are, as a rule, correct - as has been amply proved by the results of the last excavations at Ngan-yang- Karlgren compares the inscriptions of those bronzes and shows that three peculiarities, the so-called car- 240</page></plain_text>
