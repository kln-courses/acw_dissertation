Courbet: To Venture Independence brings together a proportion of the numerous papers and catalogue essays that Herding has devoted to the artist, seven first published in the period 1975-80 and the eighth in 1986. (The contexts and dates of original publication are not disclosed to the reader until near the end of the volume.) These essays have been left in their original form, though it is clear that the publishers have felt the need considerably to reduce the volume of illustrations by which they were originally accompanied. Given that comparative and complementary visual material fulfills a central function in Herding's art-historical method, there is a price to be paid in the frustration of those readers who like to make their own assessment of the grounds of the resulting claims. Fried's study of Courbet has been some ten years in the making, and distinct portions have been published in previous forms, but unlike Herding's, his book intends a sustained and organized argument, in the course of which interpretations of individual pictures and an account of Courbet's work as a whole are gradually developed and deepened. It is in the nature of this argument that it explicitly requires testing against the evidence of the works them- selves, but the illustration in Fried's volume is adequate to the normal requirements of reference. The more cognitively significant contrasts between the two studies are those revealing the tantalizing character of Courbet's oeuvre and its significance as a focus for art-historical debate. What art has served better than his to animate that system of supposedly dichotomous priorities which has been the accustomed rhetorical ground of modern art history: Realism or Modernism; verstehen or verkldren; social history or formal analysis; causal conditions or aesthetic effects; human existence conceived as determined in the last instance by material conditions, or human experience conceived as qualified in the last instance by the capacity for aesthetic emotion? On his own avowal, Courbet was both a Realist and a socialist, and his overt and notorious aspiration "to record the manners, ideas, and aspect of the age" might be thought to promise an enterprise particularly conducive to the inquiries of the social historian. Just how much there was to be made of this promise was demonstrated by T.J. Clark in his Image of the People, originally published nearly twenty years ago (in view of which date, incidentally, Herding is ill-served by the strategy of issuing his translated essays in the form of an apparently new book). The demand that Clark's work intentionally made of any subsequent interpretative studies of Courbet-and by implication of any other figure from the canon of modern art history-was that they should be adequate with respect to historical inquiries of the kind he demonstrated. Clark's work encouraged a host of enterprises in a social-historical vein, yet the demands of that work have had their most fruitful responses among those also attentive to the problems of formal analysis. This is not entirely surprising. In the field of modern Western art history, Clark had an important role in recovering the forgotten sophistication of those engaged in or touched by the debates about realism and avant-gardism that took place on the intellectual left in the thirties. What was involved in this recovery was not simply a more adequate methodology for matching paintings to what they are supposed to picture, but more important an intellec- tual discipline for reading through a given social history in pursuit of an account of pictorial effects and qualities. Social-historical work on the arts is in general subject to a reciprocating demand with respect to what Clement Greenberg once called "real relevance- ... relevance to the quality of the effect" ("Complaints of an Art Critic," Artforum, October 1967, 39). Despite the apparent promise that its "Realism" holds out to the literal-minded, it is a distinctive feature of Courbet's work that its palpable effects are often at odds with just those forms of overt figurative and illustrative contents which are the pegs from which social-historical data may be most easily made to subtend. On his own account, Herding's work represents "an attempt to combine formal analysis with social history," and it might therefore be expected to answer adequately to both forms of demand. For all the assiduousness of his researches, however, it may be questioned whether his "formal analysis" amounts to much more than a series of earnest descriptions of paintings viewed as illustrations to a social</page><page sequence="2">342 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1992 VOLUME LXXIV NUMBER 2 history. Thus he considers The Wrestlers of 1853 "in the context of current political metaphor"; and prompted by one of the satirical cartoons that are his principal stock-in-trade, he discovers in the work a form of allegory of socialist struggle against the Church (although the principal evidence he cites is subsequent to the painting). Yet whatever translation its figurative components may invite, The Wrestlers remains first and foremost an emphatically ungainly painting. The greater part of Herding's copious informa- tion simply fails the test of relevance to that painting's distinguish- ing properties. No one should be accorded the right to impose closures on inquiry in the name of their own intuitions of quality. But art-historical study can be numbing when it is unconstrained by any sense of the possible autonomy of the objects under review. In general, Herding offers interesting material to supplement what is known of the reception of Courbet's work. The book concludes, for example, with an essay (originally published in 1978) on the artist's modernity as reflected in caricature, in which the cartoonists feature as hostile but perceptive observers, soliciting the laughter of a "social elite" in the face of work supposedly directed at "working people and the middle strata of the bourgeoisie." It is a conse- quence of Herding's method, however, that where the intensional properties of Courbet's work are concerned, the limits of descrip- tion are established by the categorizations of a sociology. However industriously the iconographer labors in the light of comparative visual materials-labor that is all too often what is really meant by "formal analysis"-the factitious forms and unsettling effects of Courbet's paintings remain largely resistant to illumination. It is perhaps significant that Fried appears at his least confident when he strays onto the ground of the iconographer, as he does in his citing of comparative pictorial sources for the composition of the After Dznner at Ornans. Such forays sit uneasily with that marked refusal of the priority of the iconographic over the psychological which emerges early in his book in discussion of David and Gericault. A straightforward comparison of approaches and priorities may be made in the light of the two authors' respective discussions of Courbet's The Paznter's Studzo. Herding takes as his starting point H61dne Toussaint's interesting and largely persuasive reading of the Studzo as a form of political statement (in Toussaint et al., Gustave Courbet [1819-1877], exh. cat., Paris, Grand Palais, and London, Royal Academy of Arts, 1977-78). This reading depends on identifi- cation of the braconnier with Napoleon III, and the remaining characters assembled at the left with other historical persons to whom political significance may be attached. Herding builds upon the principal elements of this scaffolding to achieve an account of the painting as a form of exhortatzo ad principem, timed for the occasion of the World's Fair, which was at once an appeal for peace, an affirmation of the curative power of primordial nature, and an advertisement for the "reconciliation of society through art" (p. 60). Fried acknowledges the sophistication of Toussaint's and Herding's accounts and proceeds to direct his focus elsewhere. The difference lies not so much in his restriction of attention to the Studio's central group around the painter at his easel, as in his determination to describe the unconscious forms of metaphorization that he sees at work in the processes of representation. Thus, to offer a small sample ofa lengthy exposition, The falling, spreading folds of the white sheet that the standing model presses to her breast, the seething pinkish whirlpool described by her discarded dress, and, finally, the minor rapid or cascade suggested by the white cat playing at the painter's feet, are all visual metaphors for the outward flux, descent and eddying of waters whose source is the very painting that the painter has been depicted bringing to completion (p. 161). To return to the structure of dichotomies described earlier, should we view the resistance of Courbet's work to iconographical unpacking as the true critical measure of its Realism-that is to say, as the sign of his responsiveness to forms of social and material life that were unrepresentable in terms of the transmitted currency and normal self-imagery of the dominant culture, and that have re- mained relatively unrepresented in the subsequent narratives of history? (It is a measure of the sophistication in Clark's work that it is not inconsistent with such a conclusion.) Or, rather, should we take that same resistance as the sign of an emergent and inescapable Modernism, and thus as a form of direction toward those methods of formal analysis which had proved themselves, in the eyes of the Fried of Three American Painters (Cambridge, Mass., 1965), as the suitable if not the inescapable means to the discrimination of value in modern art-methods that the Fried of Courbet's Realzsm has not abandoned but rather extended though an emphasis on what Richard Wollheim has called "expressive perception"? In fact, it cannot have escaped the attention of any half-awake reader that the conceptual apparatus of "the Modern" is supposed to have collapsed. There is now no Berlin Wall to symbolize the necessity of methodological choice-which is perhaps to say that the determining power of the respective art-historical protocols is decreased to the extent that their systematic character can be perceived and described. We might expect the supposed border between causal inquiry and interpretative analysis to be less thor- oughly policed than it was during the Cold War. By the same token, if Courbet has customarily been situated on the threshold between a 19th-century Realism and a supposedly dynamic Modernism, that situation must now be open to question as Modernism itself is retrospectively reviewed. It may well be, then, that the rival accounts just rehearsed are not the true alternatives they have often seemed; that to propose the one explanation for the distinctness and opacity of Courbet's art is in fact to imply the other; that Realism and Modernism are not each other's antitheses but rather each other's necessary conditions; that there is no defensible claim for the Realism of any artistic endeavor that is not also a kind of recognition of its formal and aesthetic quality-and thus of its capacity to exhaust the resources of comparison and to resist explanations couched in causal terms. Something approaching this last suggestion can be extrapolated from the eponymous concluding chapter of Courbet's Realzsm, incidentally softening an implied contrast with Manet's Modern- ism-a thematization that might otherwise seem to be set up as the propitious title of an intended sequel. Significantly, Fried's preface closes with an acknowledgment of the importance of Image of the People and of the value he attaches to his continuing contention with Clark, reminding us that, at their best, Modernist criticism and the social history of art, like Modernism and Marxism themselves, have been not so much each other's negations as each other's indispens- able limiting conditions, and thus in a sense each other's dialectical partners. But it would be wrong to describe Fried's typical proceed- ing as a formal analysis answering to the demands of adequate social history. The character of his writing is rather to issue an emphatic form of the reciprocating demand or challenge: that the explana- tory resources of social history should be adequate to deal with what formal analysis uncovers. And it is an open question whether what is in prospect is a rapprochement with social history or-against the current grain of art-historical work-a colonization of its territory. To start, as it were, from Fried's conclusion, what assures him of the Realism of Courbet's art is not the artist's avowed Realist program, but rather the very involuntariness of those processes and procedures whereby pictorial form was originally invested with significance. In general, Fried's writing has been marked by a thoroughly Modernistic distrust of the programmatic ("Art is a matter strictly of experience, not of principles," Greenberg asserted in 1954).' In his more recent work, this distrust has been rendered systematic through adoption of that psychoanalytical apparatus which is also the means to extension of his formal analysis. Thus Courbet's Realism might be described as a sustained interpretative account of the painter's "instinctive predilections" and habitual tendencies, as Fried finds these to be unconsciously disclosed in the forms of his work. The argument of Courbet's Realzsm pursues a single and original thesis. Foremost among the defining preoccupations of Courbet's art, Fried diagnoses an urge-necessarily and significantly doomed 1 C. Greenberg, "Abstract, Representational, and So Forth" (1954), in Art and Culture, Boston, 1965, 133.</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 343 to frustration-to transport himself bodily into the painting taking shape, and thus to close the gap between painting and painter as prototypical beholder. Thus the painter's right (brush) and left (palette) hands are found to be represented or evoked not only in the right and left hands of such figures as the nude female of The Source but, through some presumably less straightforward process of metaphorical transfer, in the two Stonebreakers, the one holding a hammer, the other a round basket of stones; in A Burial at Ornans, in the barely perceptible shovel on the one (brush) hand and in the coffin on the other; in the Demoiselles, respectively in the branch that occupies the bottom right-hand corner and in the supposedly palette-like bouquet of flowers at its center; and in various other superficially unlikely pairs of motifs distributed throughout the painter's oeuvre. Fried finds an "evocation of the painter-beholder's corporeality" (p. 242) in the massive stone bluffs of the Phillips Collection's Rocks at Mouthier and in Chicago's Rock of Hautepierre, and he sees an "evocation ... of his body's interior, his organs and viscera ... blossoming before our eyes" in the 1863 Flowers zn a Basket from Glasgow (p. 252). It has to be said that Fried's elaborate analyses are as easily caricatured as the readings-in of authors far more cavalier than he with the minutiae of the pictorial text. In no writing easily called to mind is the connection between "seeing" and "seeing as" subject to so consistent a testing of its breaking-point. For this not to be regarded as a highly dubious distinction, it needs to be established first that Fried's interpretations are subject to some strong and sensible constraints, and second that they serve the ends of non- trivial inquiry: in other words, they are required to meet both conditions of relevance and conditions of heuristic worth. In fact, both conditions are generally fulfilled. On the one hand, the readings of aspects and details are developed through patterns of suggestion and implication from relatively uncontroversial initial observations, and they are constantly tested, as it were in the reader's exhorted presence, against those features of relevant paintings that are not explicitly addressed. On the other hand, it is clear that the end of Fried's psychoanalytical speculations is not primarily to extrude an idiosyncratic creator, but rather to explain why idiosyncracies of this specific order might have enabled painting at a certain historical juncture. For example, Courbet's attempted abolition of the gap between painter-beholder and canvas is first instanced through a discussion of his undoubtedly perplexing and highly charged self-portraits. The strange and empirically undeniable effects of several of these paintings justify Fried's perceptive observations on the notional dissolution of their lower bounding edges, and on the effect this dissolution creates in such paintings as the Wounded Man: the effect of a torso that, in its lower portion at least, appears to share the actual space of the viewer. (The alarming effect of The Wrestlers is open to just that kind of Friedian explanation which is unthinkable in Herding's methodological world: the left-hand figure appears as if barely braced against a force that threatens to expel him outward from the picture space and into a collision with the viewer.) Similarly, in noting the prevalence of foreground figures depicted from the rear, Fried furnishes persuasive demonstration of the idiosyncratic manner in which many of Courbet's paintings do in fact work as if to absorb the viewer in what can only be seen from within the painting's imaginary space. As to the second requirement, of heuristic worth, it can fairly be said that Fried has a larger problem field clearly in view in the course of his exploration of Courbet's psychological idiosyncracies. At the start of the present work, he summarizes the arguments of his earlier (1980) Absorption and Theatrzcality (Berkeley, Los Angeles, London)-a work that can be read as a sustained and ambitious attempt to amend the essentialism of Greenbergian Modernist theory by historicizing what that theory had naturalized: the deter- mining character of the spectator's position. According to the re- vised theory of the genesis of Modernism that Fried established, it was an inescapable condition of quality in pictorial art in France between the 1750s and the 1860s that the relationship between painting and beholder be protected against theatricalization- hence the prevalence of absorptive states in represented figures. By whatever psychoanalytical factors it may be thought to have been impelled, Courbet's attempt to eliminate the distinction between painting and painter-beholder is seen by Fried as a means to defeat theatricalization, and thus to preserve the integrity of modern painting. What is art-historically distinctive about Courbet's work is that it is through his "automatic engagement" in the act of painting, and through the painting's representation of that engagement, that an "absorptive thematics" is established in his work. It is not required of us that we believe Courbet to have been working consciously in accordance with this theory. On the contrary, what is required if Fried's account is to hold its ground is that we believe Courbet to have acted involuntarily in response to those determining conditions which the theory purports retrospectively to describe. To return to the point made earlier, it is precisely through an analysis of the involuntary and the automatistic in Courbet's painting that Fried aims to establish the painter's representative- ness. The most intriguing and perhaps also the most controversial sections of his book are devoted to what he sees as the "bi- gendered" character of Courbet's paintings of women and to the "anthropomorphism" of his landscapes. It is of the essence of Fried's case that neither property could have been consciously instilled. Thus he rejects out of hand a corpus of over two hundred drawings attributed to Courbet by Herding, largely on the grounds that the anthropomorphism of some of the pictures of foliage, rocks, and clouds is too transparent to accord with the painter's enterprise as he conceives it. Clearly, there is far more at stake here than the establishment of a stylistic canon. Fried's substantial claim for Courbet's Realism is that in his eternally and awfully postponed self-identification with the whole world of the painting, he becomes a kind of asymptote of that absolute representation which is the ideal of social realism: the perfect adjustment of social beings to natural world. On the one hand, the idiosyncratic psychological basis of his painting made it "a privileged site for rethinking, even so to speak for seeing through, the dominant mid-nineteenth-century discourses of nature and the real as well as the later, in fact still current, disciplinary discourse of art history itself' (p. 258). On the other, Fried offers a recasting of his thesis about the identification of painter-beholder and painting in terms drawn from Marx. Thus Courbet's desired relations to his paintings might be viewed as "an archtype of [that] perfect reciproc- ity between production and consumption," which is both a theoreti- cal basis for socialism and an implicit ideal "fated to be distorted in society by the laws of distribution, which with the rise of capitalism would increasingly alienate the individual laborer from the products of his labor" (p. 258). Of course, to say that Fried's interpretative readings generally satisfy both conditions of relevance and conditions of non-triviality is not to say that those readings are uniformly persuasive, nor that they can all be said to build without hiatus into plausible whole views. It is rarely easy, however, to establish the precise point at which a given analysis exceeds the practical limits of validation, for it is an effect of the urgent and hypnotic voice of the text that the reader is not occasionally but constantly challenged to abandon the security of accustomed modes of reference. The challenge is not always irresistible, however. Road runners though we would like to be, we tend to fear the indignity of the coyote's fate-conscious too late of the direction of the trajectory and the depth of the abyss, to hang back-pedalling toward solid ground. For my own part, I baulked at the invitation to view the two stonebreakers as organized (albeit automatistically) into the form of a G and a C respectively, and to view the central figure of the Wheatszfters as forming a monogram of the same letters. In fact, these specific suggestions stand relatively unconnected to the main tendency of Fried's analyses, and they may represent a form of unsuccessful importation from other interests. His work is like Herding's at least to the extent that nothing is wasted. As Herding accumulates contextual and comparative detail, so Fried accumulates insights. Only an uncritical acolyte would deny that his work is marked overall by a tendency to obsessiveness. Nor is this tendency always distinguishable from his generally laudable ambi- tion to avoid the inadequacies of all previous accounts of the</page><page sequence="4">344 THE ART BULLETIN JUNE 1992 VOLUME LXXIV NUMBER 2 paintings he cares about-paintings that are consistently "far more complex" than these accounts have allowed. But there are no risky interpretations that do not court some absurdity on the part of writer and reader alike. In an essay published twenty-five years ago, Fried declared his determined opposition to the "literalist" tendency he diagnosed in art and in culture as a whole ("Art and Objecthood," Artforum, Summer 1967). Apparent excesses of metaphorical reading are only to be expected from a writer so impatient with literalism in the interpretation of art-impatient, that is, with the belief that art is in any mechanical sense caused by such features of the natural or socio-political world as it may happen to depict. That impatience is as salutary as it is unfashionable. And what, in the end, of effects and effectiveness? I will try to make clear what I take to be the issues at stake, though I will not volunteer to resolve them. At the commencement of his Image of the People, Clark expressed the nostalgia of a sozxante-huttarde for "a time when art and politics could not escape each other" (p. 9), a time when there was, as it were, power to the artist's elbow. "Power-no word could be more inappropriate, more absurd now, when we talk of art. Which is if anything the reason for this book: it tries to reconstruct the conditions in which art was, for a time, a disputed, even an effective, part of the historical process" (p. 10). Fried is not unconcerned with "historical process," but his understanding of that process is subservient to the evidence of Courbet's paintings as he experiences their effects. According to the typical findings of Modernist theory, with which I take his argument to be consonant in this respect at least, it is a condition of achievement of modern effects in painting that the painter's pursuit of effectiveness in political or other terms be subordinated to or frustrated by the inexorable demands of the medium. In the aesthetic world of Courbet's Realzsm, in other words, the conditions of achievement of quality in effects are forms of limit on the possibility of effectiveness. That it is at home in a world thus defined is precisely the ground of Clark's objection to Modernist criticism. In the ethical world of Image of the People, the demands of effectiveness were forms of limit on the autonomy of effects. Fried made his name as an impassioned defender of the Modernist abstract art of the 1960s, which seemed at the time to stand or fall by the autonomy of its effects. Is his continuing enterprise therefore reducible to an aspect of the absurdity that Clark lamented? Is the true driving ambition behind Courbet's Realzsm that the art of the avowed socialist be rendered congenial to an idealist regard? Or is Fried justified in his implicit assumption that history is in the last instance only real to us in individualist terms, as a process of change in human thoughts and emotions, and that works of art are precisely the things that enable us to sample this process in its most intense manifestations? For all our supposed Postmodernism, it seems that we are left with a form of the familiar question. To what extent can these projects be made to converge: the critique of art that is based on an understanding of historical process, and the understanding of historical process that is formed by the critical experience of art?
