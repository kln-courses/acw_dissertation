<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SUBMARINE MARE IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF SIVA By Wendy Doniger O'Flaherty Fire and water are natural symbols, individually and in combination, in mythologies throughout the world. They assume a unique meaning in the Indian context, where tradition has attached particular significance to each element. Together, as an apparent conjunction of opposites, fire and water resolve some of the major paradoxes of Indian?especially Saiva?mythology. The most striking instance of this symbolism is the image of the mare who wanders beneath the ocean, breathing fire. 1. The background symbolism of fire and water in India. Fire is of course a natural image of energy, all the more compelling in a land in which heat is so intense as to become a constantly obtrusive image of power. More specifically, heat in Indian symbolism has two forms, mutually opposed: kama, the heat of sexual desire, and tapas, the heat generated by ascetic practices, particularly by chastity. These two forces often meet and interact in the mythology: Kama, the god of desire, once attempted to wound Siva, the god of asceticism, with an arrow; this resulted in a fire called the flame of Kama, composed of two sparks: the fire that Kama kindled in Siva and the fire from the third eye in Siva's forehead, with which Siva, enraged, burnt Kama to ashes.1 Other texts describe this battle between the two forms of fire and state that Siva "extinguished" [samaydm dsa] Kama's fire with the fire from his third eye.1 Later in this myth, Siva places his fiery seed in Agni, the god of fire;3 clearly, the cluster of overtones is explicitly utilized by the authors of these texts. Water has certain obvious connotations in India?such as fertility, immortality, peace, and the female power of creation?but it is in conjunction with the more central image of fire that water is of particular significance. Thus, in the myth of Siva and Kama, Agni is unable to bear the seed of Siva and places it in the river Ganges, whence Kumara, the son of Siva, is born. The image of fire in water is the ultimate resolution of oppositions; held in suspended union, each retains its full power and nothing is lost in compromise, but there is complete balance. In ritual, fire and water combine to burn away sinful elements and then to wash them away;4 Willibald Kirfel has pointed out the importance of the balance between fire and water in the human body in Hindu medical texts,5 as well as their symbolism of male and female, right and left, sun and moon.6 The ascetic yogi submerges himself in water in the winter and surrounds himself with fires in the 1 Matsya Purdna (Anandasrama Sanskrit Series 54; Poona, 1907), 154. 252. * Bhavisya Purdna (Bombay, Venkatesvara Steam Press, 1959), 3. 4. 14. 53; Siva Purdna (Benares, Pantfita Pustakalaya, 1964), 2. 3. 19. 10. * Mahdbhdrata (Poona, Bhandarkar Oriental Research Institute, 1933-59), XIII. 83.53; Kumdrasambhava of Kalidasa (Bombay, Nirnaya Sagara Press, 1955), 10. 1-25. 4 C.

Indra, the Vedic king of the gods, is able to burn water dry,10 a power which is shared by the hosts of Siva11 and by Siva himself.12 The seed?fire?is more powerful than the womb?water;13 yet there are many notable exceptions, in which fire is quenched by water.14 The final balance is one of suspension: fire never dies, but is merely transformed or controlled, as uranium is by blocks of lead. This balance of powers may be traced back to the Vedic conception of Agni in the waters. As Chauncey Blair has described it, It is true that water is said at Rg Veda X.16.13 to extinguish excessive fire in the dead body, and to extinguish the excessive flame of jealousy and fever, but in general the concept of Agni in the waters does not imply destruction of Agni. He is merely hidden, a potential Agni, and no less capable of powerful action.15 Agni is said to be born in the waters,18 an image at the heart of the cosmogonic myth of the golden seed of Agni which ripens in the cosmic waters to hatch into the universe.17 Agni hides in the waters until the gods find him;18 this story is told at length in the Satapatha Brdhmana, where Agni hides in a hollow reed19 (the birth-place of Kumara from the seed of Agni-Stva), and in the Mahdbhdrata, where it is said, "Agni hid in the waters ojf the watery Hell [rasdtala]; these waters, heated by him, were released by (hot) mountain springs".20 In many versions of this story, Agni is said to fear the waters, as in this inverted plot when Agni seeks Indra instead of hiding from him: Agni searched for Indra, assuming the form of a woman. Finally, only the waters remained to be searched, and Agni was afraid to enter them, for fire is 7 Mdnavadharmasdstra, ed. J. Jolly, Triibner, 1887, 6. 23; Kumdrasambhava, 5. 20-26.

"My tejas [fiery heat and light] which goes everywhere is extinguished in the waters which are its womb", he said. At last the gods strengthened Agni with magic spells and persuaded him to enter the waters.21 Agni's antipathy for water appears in another myth in which he hides in the waters but is found by the gods nevertheless; he then spits upon the waters and curses them for being an unsafe refuge.22 Elsewhere it is said, "When [the worshipper] throws Agni into the water he does what is improper, he now makes amends to him so that Agni may not injure him".23 The opposing view, that fire is stronger than water, appears in another passage in the Satapatha Brdhmana: King Mathava carried Agni in his mouth. He did not speak, fearing that Agni might fall from his mouth. A priest mentioned butter and Agni fell to the ground. Agni went burning along the river Sarasvati and burnt up all the rivers until he reached the Sadanira river flowing from Himalaya, and he dwelt east of that place.24 Finally, the text explains the mutual interaction of the two powers: "Water is food; water produces food. Therefore he supplies the fire with food. Water, moreover, is female and Agni is male; so that he thereby supplies the latter with a productive mate."25 Fire and water express the related appetites of hunger and desire, and are mutually productive. 2. Fire and water in the mythology of Siva. In later mythology, the ambiguous figure of Siva combines the two powers: Siva is in fire and in water;26 he is born from the golden egg placed in the waters;27 his terrible form is fire, while his auspicious form is water.28 A Sanskrit poem expresses the interplay of fire and water in Sankara (Siva), who is said to have swallowed a deadly poison and to bear the crescent moon and the river Ganges on his head: He who, though gifted with the power to stomach deadly poison, to burn to ashes Love and metamorphose doomsday's fire to his glowing forehead-eye, still bears the ambrosial moon, the mountain daughter and the heavenly stream, so wondrous is his skill of policy; may he, great Sankara, protect you.29 Often, Siva himself is merely Agni, and his wife?"the mountain daughter", Parvati the daughter of Himalaya?is Soma;30 her task is to control either aspect of his fiery 21 Mahdbhdrata, V. 15. 27-32. 21 Satapatha Brdhmana, 1. 2. 3. 1.

There is precedent for this in the Atharva Veda hymn which refers to the submersion of Kama himself: "The love that the gods poured within the waters, greatly burning, together with longing? that I heat for thee by Varuna's ordinance".33 The commentator Sayana interpreted this verse to mean that the gods poured Kama into the water in order to quench him or, for his own benefit, to cure him of the fever of love; Maurice Bloomfield suggests that the gods did it to punish Kama for his attacks upon themselves.34 In either case, the fever of lust is controlled by water. The Mahdbhdrata draws the human parallel: "Let a man in whom passion has arisen enter the water".35 Siva begs Parvati to cure him in this way: "Draw me out of Kama as if from a fire, and save me with the Soma of your body".36 Yet here again, fire proves more powerful than water. Siva seeks relief in the waters of two rivers, just as Agni seeks relief from the fiery seed in the Ganges: When Sati [the first wife of Siva] had died, Siva wandered about until Kama wounded him with the arrow of madness. Siva then fell into the Kalindi river and the waters were burnt up and became as black as collyrium. And still Siva found no peace. When Parvati departed to perform asceticism, as Siva had instructed her to do, Siva was overcome with desire. He wandered over the earth and sprinkled his body with water, but he was still tortured by desire and found no peace. One day he saw the Yamuna river and he plunged in, trying to assuage the torture of his fever, but the waters of the river became black by contact with the fire of Siva's body.37 In both of these myths it is clear that the water does not quench the fire but is burnt instead. A similar failure to extinguish the flame of Kama is recorded in the Brahmdnda Pur ana: After Kama had been burnt by Siva and revived by the Goddess, he attacked Siva with his arrows. Siva abandoned his tapas and lost all control. Tortured by desire, sighing, heated, burning with Kama's arrows, he could not assuage the heat of his body with the coolness of the crescent moon or the Ganges, nor by the Soma dripping from the crescent moon, nor by lying in snowy waters. He could not extinguish the flame of the bodiless Kama in his body.38 The unquenchable fire of Siva appears in a more symbolic form in the myth of the Pine Forest, in which the sages dwelling in the forest castrate Siva; his phallus, or linga, 31 cf. Siva Purdna, 2. 2. 16. 39. 32 Kathdsaritsdgara, 2. 1. 1. 33 Atharva Veda, VI. 132. 1. "Atharva Veda, tr. Maurice Bloomfield (S.B.E. XLII), Oxford, 1897, p. 535. 34 Malidbhdrata, XII. 207. 13.

In one version of this myth, the liiiga comes to rest in a river;36 in another, the sages beg Parvati to take the form of a yoni (the female sexual organ) to receive the liiiga, which they sprinkle with consecrated water in order to make it peaceful.40 This is a reflection of actual cult practice; according to William Crooke, "the lingam of Mahadeva, a thirsty deity, who needs continued cooling to relieve his distress, must be kept continually moist to avoid drought".41 The Abbe Dubois described a similar practice of placing over the "idol" of Siva a vessel filled with water: "In this vessel a little hole is pierced, so that the water may, by falling on him drop by drop, refresh him and abate the burning heat that consumes him".42 The ritual continues in present-day Hinduism, for the Goddess of the fever of smallpox is cooled with water and fanned with branches.43 The flaming power of the idol is thus controlled but never quenched by the ritual immersion. Kalidasa expressed this in a verse combining the symbols of Parvati as water and Siva as fire with the central image of their balance: the mare at the bottom of the sea: United with Parvati, Suva passed the days and nights of a thousand years as if it were a single night. But the joys of love-making did not satisfy his thirst, just as all the floods of the ocean do not quench the fire blazing within.44 3. The submarine doomsday fire. The fire of doomsday is said to have the form of a mare (vadava) at the bottom of the ocean; inextinguishable flames issue from her mouth. The destructive fire which cannot be quenched can at least be made to wait for the moment appropriate for destruc tion; the fire that blazes from Siva's eye to burn Kama is the fire of untimely doomsday, which yawns wide to burn up the universe until it is placed beneath the sea.45 Agni Varjava-vaktra (the fire of the mare's mouth) drinks the waters of the ocean and lets them out again; eventually this fire of the underworld will destroy the universe, at the end of an aeon.46 Because of its destructive nature, the mare-fire is associated with the demon powers; the sage Orva (author of the fire) gave it to the demon Hiranyakasipu, who used it to dispel Indra's magic darkness during a battle; Indra then sent Soma and Varuna (gods of water) to extinguish the demon magic of the fire.47 The mare-fire is also associated with Death; in one myth it is said that the mare was a river, the Vadava, which was given to Death as a wife; in gratitude to Siva for this gift, Death established a great lihga known as the Mahanala (the Great Fire) at the mouth of the Vadava river.48 (Here, in a reversal 89 Skanda Purana, 6. 259. 5. 40 Siva Purana, with commentaries (Bombay, Ganpat Krishnaji Press, 1884), Jnanasarnhita 42. 27-32.

The mare-fire beneath the sea is a common image. In the Brhaddranyaka Upanisad, the universal fire is said to be the open mouth of the sacrificial horse in the sea;49 a commentary on the lawbook of Manu says, "Fire is born of water, as is seen in the case of lightning and the (submarine) mare-fire".50 It is frequently used as a metaphor for a voracious or insatiable energy: "Not by anything can the fire of enmity be assuaged; it is inextinguishable, like the submarine fire".51 The mare is considered a particularly apt metaphor for the insatiable appetites of a flirtatious woman;52 but it stands equally well for passion in a man: a character in the Prabodhacandrodaya boasts that he has crossed the ocean of passion, escaped from the whirlpool of affection, and dispelled the mare-fire of anger.53 The mare-fire appears in the myth in which Siva cuts off the fifth head of Brahma, the Creator; in one version, the head is said to be a horse-head, and in another the demon of brahminicide who pursues Siva after the beheading is likened to the fire of the mare;54 the ocean fears that, if the terrible head is placed within him, he will be burnt dry (sosam ydsye).55 When the Goddess instructs her servant to drink up the inexhaustible flood of the demon Raktabija's blood, she says: "Open your mouth and drink his blood as if your mouth were the fire of the mare".58 In one version of the myth of the churning of the ocean, the mare-fire emerges from the sea immediately before the terrible Kalakufa poison which threatens the gods until Siva swallows it;57 the poison is merely another aspect of the destructive fire waiting to come forth from the sea. The poison and the fire appear together in this verse: The goddess Sri is fickle, . . . and the kalakuta is a deadly poison. It is pondering these vices of his family that burns the ocean's heart, and not the underwater fire.58 The circle of the sun surrounded by clouds in the rainy season is likened to the mare's head in the ocean,59 a simile made more appropriate by the Indian belief that the sun's horses place his chariot in the Western ocean at night.80 The sun, which emerges from the clouds to destroy the universe at doomsday, is an obvious prototype for the mare-fire. The image of the mare is often used to emphasize the greatness of the ocean;81 the element of latent power is beautifully expressed in a verse from a Prakrit epic which 49 Brhaddranyaka Upanisad, 1. 1. 2, in One hundred and eight Upanishads, 4th ed., Bombay, Nirnava Saeara Press, 1932.

How marvellous the blessed sea! The mind grows dizzy thinking of their greatness. The first keeps drinking greedily its dwelling and yet its thirst by water is not quenched; the other is so great it never suffers the slightest loss of water in extent.63 4. The fiery mare: Samjnd and the control o/tejas. The particular form that the fire assumes?a mare?is by no means as whimsical as it may at first appear. In Vedic religion, the horse rather than the bull or cow was the sacred animal, the sacrificial animal, and the mare in Hindu mythology is associated with all the concepts central to the submarine fire. The horse is an image of fertility. The Vedic Creator, Prajapati, assumed the form of a stallion to pursue his daughter when she fled in the form of a mare.64 In the ancient horse sacrifice, the asvamedha, the sacrificer's wife pantomimed copulation with the consecrated stallion,65 and Brhaspati, author of the Carvaka heresy, mocked the Vedic ritual in which "the sacrificer's wife takes the phallus of the horse".68 That the asvamedha had connotations of sexuality, as well as fertility, for the ancient Indians is clearly evident from the Harivamsa episode in which Indra, overcome by desire for Kasya (the wife of King Janamejaya), enters into the stallion consecrated for the sacrifice and unites with the queen during the ritual.68* Some aspects of this ritual seem to have survived in later Hinduism, for medieval friezes and miniature paintings depict ritual orgies or scenes in which a woman is mounted by a stallion.67 A particular connexion between the asvamedha and the Vaclava fire may be seen in the later belief that the submarine fire devours the offerings of the horse-sacrifice.68 The asvamedha ritual is probably of Indo-European origin; the ancient Irish king was "expected to enter into matrimonial relations with a mare".89 The fertility and potency of the horse was enhanced by special ritual laws requiring him to abstain from sexual intercourse during the year preceding the ceremony;70 this ritual chastity remains in many of the myths of the Vadava. The head of the horse is particularly sacred and potent; throughout Sanskrit myth and poetry there appear " Ravana Vaha or Setubandha, with commentary (Kavyamala 47, 1895), V. 34. 3 Subhdsitaratnakosa, ?1198, Ingalls translation, cf. ?1210-1212. 4 Brhaddranyaka Upanisad, 1. 4. 4. 5 Mircea Eliade, Yoga: immortality and freedom, tr.

The most famous mare in Indian mythology is the Vedic Samjna, whose story is also the great myth of the channelling of sexual fire. The myth is told briefly in the Rg Veda, expanded in the Brhaddevatd, and told at length in several Puranas.74 The basic story appears iri the Visnu Purana: Samjna, the daughter of Visvakarman (the architect of the gods), was the wife of the Sun. Unable to bear his fiery power [tejas], she made an image of herself and went to the forest to perform tapas. The Sun mistook the image for Samjna and begat three children in her, but eventually he learned that the true Samjna had gone away. By means of the eye of meditation and tapas, the Sun saw that Samjna had taken the form of a mare to do tapas; he changed himself into a.stallion and begat upon her the twin Asvins ("Horsemen"). He brought Samjna back to his own palace, where Visvakarman placed him on his lathe and trimmed away the excess tejas. The parts that he discarded were made into the discus of Visnu, the trident of Siva, and the weapons of other gods.75 In other Puranas, certain details are different: the Sun's tejas is a threat to the entire world, not only to Samjna;78 and certain sequences are reversed (even after he has been trimmed on the lathe, the Sun is unacceptable to Samjna, who leaves him after the birth of the Asvins).77 In some versions, the stallion's seed is placed in the mouth of the mare,78 like the fire in the mouth of the Vadava. But the basic elements of the myth are preserved: the unbearable fiery power of sexuality; the practice of asceticism; and the role of the mare. The myth of Samjna is linked to Siva by the belief that Siva's own creative-destructive tejas, released when he was castrated in the Pine Forest, was placed in the sun;79 in return, Siva receives from the sun in this myth a portion of that same destructive tejas to make his weapon, the trident. (Other scraps from the trimming of the sun are said to have been used to build the great temple of the sun at Konarak; built in the form of a horse-drawn chariot of the sun, and covered with erotic friezes, this temple furnishes yet another link 71 Kumdrasambhava, 1.11. 72 Rawson, op. cit., pl. 42.1 am indebted to Dr. J.

Moreover, Siva, like the Sun, is said to have difficulty in finding a wife capable of bearing his tejas.80 5. The symbolism of the horse. Connotations of fertility persist in the mythological figure of the mare. Laksmi, the wife of Visnu and daughter of the ocean, follows in the footsteps of Samjna: Visnu cursed Laksmi to become a mare because she had lusted for Revanta (the child of Samjna and the Sun) when he was mounted on the marvellous horse Ucchaihsravas. Visnu promised that she would be released from the curse when she had a son. Laksmi went to the very place where Samjna had wandered as a mare, performing tapas, at the confluence of the Kalindi and Tamasa rivers. Laksmi, the daughter of the ocean, meditated upon Siva and did tapas for a thousand years, taking the form of a mare; then Siva came to her and promised that Visnu would appear to her in the form of a stallion and beget a son upon her. Siva vanished and sent Visnu to Laksmi; he begat a son upon her, stallion mounting mare; they resumed their normal forms and returned home, giving the son to a king who had performed tapas to obtain him.81 This reworking of the myth of Samjna retains the mare theme in association with the familiar motifs: the sun, the horse of the sun, the ocean, the horse born from the ocean (Ucchaihsravas), the mare performing tapas, and the birth of a son. In South India today, horses are dedicated to Aiyanar, the son of Siva, and are worshipped together with the linga.*2 The horse is a natural symbol of power as well as of fertility, an aspect which was surely strengthened by the fact that the horse-drawn chariot gave the Indo-Aryans the decisive advantage in their invasion of the Indian sub-continent; for the Vedic Indians, the horse was the emblem of war. Centuries later, the Upanisads likened the senses to horses that must be controlled or else will become vicious and wild;83 and a mendicant said to the Buddha, "The senses of others are restless like horses, but yours have been tamed. Other beings are passionate, but your passions have ceased."Bi Martial power is replaced by spiritual power; we have already noted how the mare-fire is symbolic of appetites that are difficult to tame. Even in its domesticated form, the horse remains wild and liable to revert to wildness; yet it can be tamed until it becomes merely a farm implement or an instrument of battle. A striking example of the early association of the horse with the taming of wildness, as well as with fire and water, may be seen in a passage of the Gopatha Brdhmana in which the four Vedas compete over the taming of a wild horse; the horse is referred to as "she", although no word for mare is used, and the verb used to represent her taming is the same as the term for the extinguishing of a fire or a passion?sam. Finally, the Atharvan, the tamer, prepares the waters of tranquillity which he sprinkles over the horse; flames shoot forth from every limb of the animal, who is henceforth perfectly tame.85 The horse is tamed as the flame liiiga of Siva is later controlled, by submersion in water 80 Siva Purana, 2. 2. 16.38. 81 Devibhdgavata Purana (Benares, Pandita Pustakalaya, 1960), 6. 17-19. 8,2 Stella Kramrisch, Unknown India: Ritual art in tribe and village, Philadelphia, 1968, 56. 33 Katha Upanisad, 3. 4-6. ** Asvaghosa, Buddhacarita, XV. 1-7, 13, from Tibetan translations; cited by Edward Conze, Buddhist scriptures, Penguin Books, 1959, 53. 85 Gopatha Brahmatia (Bibliotheca Indica, 1872), 1. 2. 18; p. 35. JRAS, 1971, I. 2</page><page sequence="10">18 THE SUBMARINE MARE IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF SlVA The horse is specifically associated with the ocean and with fire, the two elements of the submarine mare. In the Rg Veda, fiery horses draw the chariot of the sun; the flames of Agni are his bay chargers.86 The seven daughters of the sun are the seven bay mares that pull his chariot, the seven sisters who attend the fiery Soma drink.87 Agni appears in the Rg Veda as a horse; he changes himself into a horse in order to deceive the demons.88 Prajapati takes the form of a white horse to seek Agni when he hides from the gods; when Prajapati enters the water in this form, Agni burns the horse's mouth,89 furnishing yet another instance of the combination of essential motifs of the Vag*ava-vaktra fire. The connexion between the horse and fire is clear and natural; the link with the ocean is less obvious but equally well-established. The Greeks sacrificed horses to Poseidon,90 and Celtic mythology describes aquatic monsters known as Goborchinn or horse-heads, as well as horse-eels and water horses. In the Vedas, the horse is sacred to Varuna, the god of the waters,91 and the ocean is the womb of the horse.92 Stella Kramrisch has discussed this belief: The ancient Aryans sacrificed a horse to Varuna, the god of the fertilizing waters. In hymnic intoxication, they knew the horse as Varuna (Rg Veda I. 163. 1). To the South Indian Dravidian peasant of today, this hymnic realization of the fiery animal, the horse, of the fiery spark of life that is in the waters, of the fire that at daybreak seems to arise from the waters as the glowing sun and sinks into their darkness and dies, has become uncannily one with the power of Aiyanar and also with the eery, fatal Seven Virgins.93 Other myths about horses still retain the same elements in different permutations: demons, the ocean, the sun, and the taming of the horse: The winged white horse Ucchaihsravas, born from the ocean when it was churned, was taken by the demon chief for his own riding animal. The gods, jealous, implored Prajapati to give them horses too; he created four classes and many sub castes of horses for them. Daksa, a son of Prajapati, considered the winged horses a nuisance and cursed them to live on earth without their wings. Thenceforth they were ridden by gods and men.94 The myth of the submarine mare appears in the Kulu Valley in the form of a legend of a mare who had drowned in a sacred lake in the Himalayas, gaining thereby certain healing powers.95 (In this context it is interesting to note that the Asvins are the physicians of the gods.) The tamed horse, retaining its power but in a harnessed form, is a perfect symbol of the controlled force of fire under water.

The myths of search: Dadhyahc and Sagara. The horse-head is connected with the myths of the seeking of fire and the seeking of Soma, perhaps because of the natural image of swift flight which the horse suggests. Moreover, since the horse is an essential part of the Soma sacrifice, its image is associated with the drinking of Soma in the Vedas just as the submarine mare is the great drinker of water: Dadhyanc, through a horse's head, told (the Asvins) (the place of) the mead (Soma). The Asvins gave a horse's head to Dadhyanc and Dadhyanc told them (the place of) the hidden mead . . . Indra with the bones of Dadhyanc slew nine times ninety (or ninety-nine) enemies; as he sought the head of the horse, which was hidden in the mountains, he found it in Saryanavat.** A clearer version of the first part of this myth appears in the Satapatha Brdhmana: Dadhyanc knew (the secret of) the mead and the secret of the sacrifice: how the head of the sacrifice is put on again and becomes complete. Indra threatened to cut Dadhyanc's head off if he told this secret to anyone. The Asvins asked him to tell them the secret and made this provision: they first cut off his head and laid it aside, then placed the head of a horse on his neck, and then he told them the secret through the horse-head. Indra cut off that head, the Asvins brought back his own head and restored it, and all was well.97 "The head of the sacrifice" is the head of the sacrificial horse; the elixir of immortality, Soma, revives the sacrificial animal, as the ocean waters feed the fiery head. Sayana sheds some light on the second half of the Vedic myth: When Dadhyanc died, he left behind the horse's head. The gods sought it and found it in Lake Saryanavat, a lake in Kuruksetra. With the bones o( this head, Indra slew the demons.88 It is interesting to note that Sayana describes Saryanavat as a lake, the traditional watery bed of the fiery horse-head. The elements of this obscure myth recur throughout the corpus of fire-water myths. The Asvins who give the horse-head (and the Soma) are the sons of the mare Samjna; the seeking of the horse-head by Indra is the seeking of fire hidden in water; and the bones of Dadhyanc appear in Puranic mythology as the bones of Dadhici, which are a direct cause of the birth of the submarine mare. The search for Soma and for fire, the Sun's search for his wife?all are associated with the flight of the horse. The seeking of the horse-fire itself is the central theme of the myth of Sagara, which appears in several slightly different versions: King Sagara had two wives. In order to obtain sons, he performed tapas for a hundred years; then, by the favour of Siva [or by propitiating Aurva, the author of the submarine fire] he obtained 60,000 sons from one wife and one son, named Amsuman, from the other. After some time, the king performed an asvamedha sacrifice; as the horse wandered over the earth, protected by the king's sons, it reached the ocean which was at that time empty of water, and there it disappeared. {Or: it was snatched away by a wave as it wandered by the ocean. Or: Indra took the form of a demon and stole the horse, for Indra was jealous of his own reputation as giver RgVeda, I. 116. 12; I. 117.22; 1.84. 13-14. 7 Satapatha Brdhmana, 14. 1. 1. 18-25.

They reached down into Hell, and there they saw the horse wandering about, and they saw the sage Kapila there haloed in flames, blazing with tapas. The sons were angry and behaved disrespectfully to Kapila; in fury, he released a flame from his eye and burnt all the sons to ashes. Then Amsuman came and propitiated Kapila and obtained the horse, with which Sagara completed his sacrifice. Sagara made the ocean his son, called Sagara. The ocean took the horse and worshipped with it, and he became the ocean. Years later, after Sagara's death, Bhagiratha, the grandson of Amsuman, propitiated Siva and the Ganges; the Ganges fell from heaven to earth, breaking her fall upon Siva's head, and she flowed over the ashes of the 60,000 sons, reviving them.99 The submarine mare appears in many forms in this myth: first, as the power?Siva or the sage Aurva?who grants the sons as a reward for asceticism; then as the horse that vanishes into the ocean (taken by Indra, the one who sought the horse-head of Dadhyanc) to be churned out of it again, like Ucchaihsravas; then as the submarine fire of Hell blazing from the eye of Kapila, as it blazes from the eye of Siva; and finally as the ashes of the sons, revived by the floods of the Ganges just as the seed of Siva is engendered there or the fire of his lust assuaged there. The sage Aurva, creator of the submarine fire, is further connected with the myth of Sagara by the tradition that Aurva was preceptor to Sagara and gave him the fire with which Sagara conquered the barbarians.100 This fire weapon is the same mare-fire which Aurva gave to the demons. The same elements appear arranged more briefly and simply in the story of the demon Dhundhu: King Brhadasva had a thousand sons, of whom Kubalasva was the eldest. When the old king handed over his throne to Kubalasva and entered the forest, he met the sage Uttanka, who told him that a demon named Dhundhu was performing great tapas there by his hermitage, in the sands of the ocean, burning like the doomsday fire with flames issuing from his mouth, causing the waters to flow about him in a whirlpool. Brhadasva asked Kubalasva to subdue the demon; he and the other sons dug down into the sand, but Dhundhu appeared from the ocean, breathing fire, and he burnt all but three of the sons with his power of tapas. Then Kubalasva drank up the watery flood with a fiery arrow, and he quenched the fire with water; and he killed the demon Dhundhu, burning him up.101 The end of the myth expresses the final balance of the powers: the fire is quenched by water, but the water is "drunk" by fire. Clearly this is an abbreviated form of the Sagara story, centring upon the burning of the king's sons by a submarine fire; the image of the horse seems to be omitted from the Dhundhu story, but it appears in the form of the names of the kings: Brhadasva ("Possessing great horses") and Kubalasva ("Possessing fodder horses"). Moreover, the Mahdbhdrata explicitly connects the two stories: "Dhundhu 99 Siva Purdna, 5. 38.48-57; Linga Purdna (Calcutta, Barigabasi Press, 1890), 1.66. 15-20; Vara Purdna (Bombay, Venka|esvara, 1867), 2. 26. 143-178; Brahmdnda Purdna, 3. 46-53; Visnu Purdna, 4. 4. 1-33; Bhdgavata Purdna (Gorakhpur, Gita Press, 1962), 9.8.1-31, 9.9.1-15; Rdmdyana of Valmfki (Balakhanda, Baroda, Oriental Institute, 1960), 1.38-44; Mahdbhdrata, III. 104. 6-^22; 105.1-25; 106. 1-40; 107. 1-25; 108.1-19. 100 Sir Monier Monier-Williams, Sanskrit-English dictionary, 2nd ed., Oxford, 1899, 239. 101 Mahdbhdrata, III. 192-195; Vayu Purdna, 2. 26. 30-60; Siva Purdna, 5. 37. 1-36.</page><page sequence="13">THE SUBMARINE MARE IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF SIVA 21 burnt the sons of Kubalasva with the fire from his mouth, just as formerly Kapila burnt the sons of Sagara".102 More explicitly, Dhundhu is related to the submarine mare by this myth: The two demons Madhu and Kaitabha stole the Vedas and took them to the Hell beneath the great ocean. Brahma told Visnu what had happened, and Visnu took a horse-headed form and entered Hell. He took the Vedas back to Brahma and then he resumed his own form, leaving the horse-head in the ocean as the dwelling of the Vedas. Then he killed Madhu and Kaitabha, who were the parents of Dhundhu. Visnu himself is the horse-head that lives in the ocean, devouring oblations.103 Thus Dhundhu, the submarine fire, is the very form which Visnu assumes in order to kill the parents of Dhundhu, who have stolen the Vedas (as the Soma and horses are stolen in other myths); and Dhundhu is in turn killed by the fire-and-water weapons of a "horse" (Kubalasva). 7. The origin of the submarine mare-fire: Aurva. The submarine fire is often called the fire of Aurva or Orva, from the name of the sage whose anger is its source. The Rg-Vedic occurrences of these terms, though sparse, incorporate almost every element of the Puranic myth of the Vadava fire?the underworld, the ocean, fire, cattle, insatiable desire, and, in later Vedic mythology, the hungry horse set free. The primary meaning of the term (which may perhaps be derived from uru, "broad", or vr, "to enclose", and is a possible doublet of ulba, "womb-membrane") seems to be "cavern". Often, as in the myths of Usas (Dawn), Vala, and the cows, the cavern is specifically one in which cattle are kept.104 From this primary meaning may be derived the later associations with demons (the underworld) and horses. The secondary meaning of urvd in the Rg Veda, according to Louis Renou, is the ocean;103 Hermann Grassmann narrows this down to "Seebecken" and considers it the primary meaning;106 Hermann Oldenberg considers the two concepts to be combined in the idea of the waters as herds.107 In particular, the urvd is the part of the ocean into which many rivers flow; here it is interesting to note that the later mare-fire usually arises at the confluence of a river and the ocean. Sayana glosses urvd in this context as the Vaolavanala in the ocean, used as a metaphor for the fire of lightning inside a cloud.108 Another important connotation of the mare-fire appears in a Rg-Vedic verse which likens the desire of the worshipper to the urvd;109 Sayana remarks that the Vadavanala is here a metaphor for unsated desire; Oldenberg points out the aptness of the urvd, a wide, empty space, in this context. Elsewhere, the urvd is the yoni, the source?be it of waters or of cattle?uo and Heinrich Liiders further interprets it as a name of the 102 Mahdbhdrata, III. 195. 25. 103 Mahdbhdrata, XII. 335. 1-64; III. 193. 16; XII. 335. 5, 44, 54 ff. 101 Rg Veda, IV. 12. 5, etc. I am indebted to Professor J.

From here it is an obvious step to the Puranic notion of the doomsday fire waiting underneath the ocean. Two more Vedic occurrences add still other essentials of the later myth. Agni himself is associated with two sages named Aurva and Bhrgu, and in the very same verse is said to be the Agni who dwells in the ocean;112 Bhrgu is the grandfather of Aurva in later mythology, and already in the Rg Veda both are associated with the fire in the ocean. The Taittiriya Samhitd adds to this cluster of ideas the final element: Agni who dwells in the ocean is called urvd and symbolized by a horse who had been yoked but is now set free so that he can eat ghee and take his place in the ocean.113 The horse, tamed and set free, devouring the oblations (the waters of the ocean), is the mare-fire. Vedic elements persist in the Purana myths. F. D. K. Bosch has discussed at some length the "inverse order" and "inversion" of the Dadhyanc myth and the myth of Aurva,114 and parallels between the two are clear. A brief prediction of Aurva's birth appears in the Mahdbhdrata: A sage named Aurva will be born, blazing like a fire, and he will create a fire of anger to destroy the three worlds and reduce the earth to ashes. After some time he will extinguish [samayisyati] the fire, throwing it into the mouth of the mare in the ocean.115 The myth is expanded and rationalized elsewhere in the Epic: The sage Aurva was born from his mother's left thigh, blazing with anger toward the Warrior class who had destroyed his family and his father. He performed tapas in order to destroy the worlds and the people. His great tapas heated all the gods, and the Fathers begged him to be merciful and to control his anger. Aurva said, "My vow of anger cannot be in vain, or I could not live. Undispersed, my anger would burn me as fire burns a forest, if I were to restrain it with my own tejas." The Fathers said, "Release it into the waters if you like, and, since the waters are the people, this will fulfil your vow to burn the people". So Aurva placed the fire in the ocean, and it became the horse-headed fire, which vomits fire from its mouth and drinks the waters of the ocean.116 Aurva states the problem of the dispersal of excess destructive ascetic power: he cannot take it back, as Siva cannot take back the fire from his eye, and so it must be placed in the one situation in which it can do no harm: under water. The problem of dispersal is explicitly the central point of the myth in the Mahdbhdrata, which tells it to the sage Parasara in order to persuade him to dispose in a similar manner of his own destructive wrath;117 the Epic here introduces the Aurva story as a conscious multiform. 111 Heinrich Luders, Varuna, Gottingen, 1951 (I) and 1959 (II), 328, on Rg Veda, V.45. 2.

The importance of chastity in this context is indicated by a more explicit description of the tapas involved in the birth of Aurva: The sage Orva was performing tapas; the gods asked him to stop and begin family life. He replied "This is the eternal dharma of sages to live in the forest in a hermitage, practising chastity. I will not take a wife, but I will create a son never theless." Then by his tapas Orva placed his thigh in the fire and churned it; a halo of flames broke out of his thigh and became a son, named Aurva. Aurva blazed so fiercely that he terrified the universe; he said, "Hunger binds me: I will eat the universe". He grew great, burning all creatures, until Brahma said to Orva, "Restrain your son's tejas, for the good of all people. I will give him a dwelling-place and a food like Soma; he will dwell in the mouth of the mare in the ocean, and he will live upon an oblation of water. This water-eating fire will burn all creatures at the end of the aeon." "So be it", said Orva, and he threw the fire into the ocean.118 In this version, Aurva is personified as the son of Orva, rather than an elemental fire; and his blaze of hunger is directly derived from the tapas of his father's chastity, a force which becomes dangerous when it is released to become productive. The Skanda Purana tells another myth of Aurva's birth, related to the Vedic tradition of the horse-head of Dadhyanc: The gods placed their weapons in the hermitage of Dadhici for safe-keeping, and Dadhici made them into liquid and drank their essence. One day Subhadra, his wife, put on his loin-cloth for a menstrual cloth, and she became pregnant with the seed that was on the cloth. When she brought forth a child, she cursed the father, in ignorance, saying, "I swear by my chastity: let the man who engendered this child die". At this time the gods returned to take back their weapons; and Dadhici abandoned his body so that the gods could make their weapons of his bones. When Subhadra learned that Dadhici was the father of her child, she rejoiced; but the child, named Pippalada, wished to kill the gods who had killed his father. He went to Himalaya and did great tapas to propitiate Siva; he churned his left thigh with his left hand and from it a mare appeared, followed by a stallion. The mare was covered by the stallion, brought forth a child, and disappeared. Pippalada then told the child to devour the gods. The gods sought help from Visnu, who tricked the fire-child into eating the gods one by one, beginning with the waters. The mare-fire, haloed in flames, asked to be brought to the waters, and no one but Sarasvati could bear the fire. As Sarasvati carried the fire to the waters, a mountain saw her and asked her to marry him; she refused, and he threatened to abduct her by force. She then agreed to marry him if he would hold the mare-fire while she bathed; he did so and was burnt to ashes. She took up the fire and set out again for the ocean. When they reached the ocean, the mare-fire was full of joy and offered Sarasvati a boon; she said, "Promise that you will drink the waters through a mouth no larger than a needle". Then she threw the fire into the ocean, and Visnu tricked the mare fire, and this is the story of the birth of the Aurva fire.119 Although the story refers to the Aurva fire, Aurva does not appear; he is replaced by " Matsya Purdna, 175. 23-63; Harivamsa, 1. 45. 20-64. " Skanda Purdna, 1. 1. 32. 1-128; 7. 1. 33. 1-103; cf. Padma Purdna, 6. 148. 27 ff.</page><page sequence="16">24 THE SUBMARINE MARE IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF SlVA Pippalada and given a complex reason for his destructive fervour: revenge for the death of his father replaces his fierce chastity. Pippalada appears elsewhere as an incarnation of Siva,120 and Siva himself appears here, as in the Mahdbhdrata story, as the one who makes possible the birth of the fire-child. The story of Dadhicfs bones is connected with the horse-head of Dadhyanc in the Rg Veda, but this connexion is submerged in the Skanda Purdna and seems to have little to do with the birth of Pippalada except to supply the motive for his anger. The image of the mare, which is introduced only as an after thought at the end of the Mahdbhdrata story of Aurva and is absent entirely from the story of Orva, appears here in an awkward and elaborate form unrelated to the horse-head of Dadhici-Dadhyanc. The role of chastity is transferred in this version from Orva himself to the two women in the myth: the mother of Pippalada, who swears by her chastity, and the bearer of the fire, Sarasvati, whose steadfast chastity enables her to fulfil her role and dispose of the fire. The tricking of the lustful mountain by Sarasvati is a multiform of the double trick played upon the chaste mare-fire: first, to make the fire drink the watc-s, and then to reduce the size of the mouth to a needle (which, with Visnu's gift to the ocean of inexhaustible waters, supplies an explicit rationalization of the eternal balance of food [water] and eater [fire]). Sarasvati's place in the myth is clear; like the Ganges and the ocean, she is the only receptacle for the fire. This is the role that she plays in the control of Siva's fire as well; for when he went to do tapas, after making love to Parvati for 1,000 years, he plunged into the Sarasvati river for a year and a half.121 In anthropomorphic form, she is the daughter with whom Brahma commits incest, stallion pursuing mare. The sexual nature of the fire-water episode may be seen in the fact that when the fire is placed in the ocean (which is masculine), it is a mare; but when it is placed in Sarasvati or the Ganges (which are feminine), it is considered to be masculine; even in the Pippalada myth where it is born from a mare, a stallion is introduced as well, and the resulting child is masculine. The plight of Sarasvati is elaborated upon in the Padma Purdna, which here omits the whole story of the origin of the mare-fire: Formerly the gods said to Sarasvati, "You must take this mare-fire and throw it into the ocean of salt so that the gods will be free of fear; otherwise the mare-fire will burn everything with its tejas". Sarasvati asked her father, Brahma, what she should do, and Brahma asked her to protect the gods. She wept bitterly, but she set out, accompanied by Yamuna and Gayatri, and she went to Uttanka's hermitage. There she received the fire in a golden pot and took it to the ocean.122 Nothing is said of the origin of the fire; but it comes from the hermitage of Uttanka, the place from which the submarine fire of Dhundhu originates, and there may be a confusion between the two myths here. But the Brahma Purdna retells this same episode in a version of the story of Pippalada and Dadhica (sic) which gives a more specific rationalization of the presence of the mare in the story: Pippalada the son of Dadhica .performed great tapas in order to kill the slayers of his father. When he was able to see the third eye of Siva, he gained from Siva 1i0 Siva Purana, 3. 24-25. 1,1 Vdmanq Purana, 34. 18-20. 1,1 Padma Purana, 5. 18. 159-198.</page><page sequence="17">THE SUBMARINE MARE IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF SlVA 25 the power to kill the gods. The pippala (fig) trees said, "Your mother was said to be a mare", and when Pippalada heard this he became angry, and from his eye an evil spirit came forth blazing in the form of a mare with a deadly tongue; she had the form of a mare because he had been thinking of a mare. He told her to eat the gods, but she began to eat him, since he had been made by the gods; in terror, Pippalada fled to Siva, who told the spirit not to take any creature within the distance of a league from that place. Then the mare set out full of fire to burn the universe, terrifying the gods, who sought refuge with Pippalada; but Pippalada could not restrain the mare. As she came to the confluence of the Ganges, she was implored by the gods to begin with the waters of the ocean and then to devour everything. The fire said, "How can I reach the ocean? Let a virtuous maiden place me in a golden pot and lead me there." The gods asked the maiden Sarasvati to do this, and she asked them to join her with four other rivers, the Yamuna, Ganges, Narmada, and Tapati. The five rivers put the fire in a golden pot and brought it to the ocean, they threw it into the ocean and it began to drink the waters little by little.123 The lire is called a mare until the chaste maiden and the rivers are first mentioned; thence forth, it is called a fire (masculine), placed in the golden pot which is the receptacle of the golden seed of Siva and submerged in the Ganges like that seed.124 Saiva imagery is strong throughout this version: Pippalada becomes able to see Siva's third eye and then produces the fiery mare with his own eye;125 the gods then beg Siva to protect them from the mare created by the fire of his eye,126 and clearly the two eyes function as one, just as Pippalada and Siva are one. The theme of chastity plays a part here, too; the slur against Pippalada's mother (a mare being perhaps equivalent to a bitch or at least an over-sexed woman, as is its connotation in the Kdmasutral2~) is reminiscent of the mother's own fears of her chastity in the Skanda Purana version; and the chastity of Sarasvati?implicit and important in that version?is here made explicit: only a maiden can carry the fire. Siva participates in the action of the myth in symbolic forms more often than he appears anthropomorphically. But he plays a more important role in the Vardha Purana version of the myth : The sage Aurva performed tapas until he began to burn the universe. The gods were frightened; and so one day while the sage was doing tapas Siva looked in anger upon Aurva's hermitage and burnt it up. When Aurva saw that it had been burnt, he,said, "Let the one who has burnt this hermitage be burnt by sorrow and wander over the world". And so Siva himself was burnt by a great fire and wandered without finding rest. Finally he went with Parvati to Aurva, who promised that Siva j would be released from the curse if he performed the ritual of bathing a host of cows; and he did so and was cured.128 Aurva's curse of an unknown enemy, like Subhadra's unwitting curse of her own husband, results in the creation of a fire. Siva is both the immediate source of this fire?burning the hermitage with his third eye and causing havoc as the demon Dhundhu caused havoc in Uttanka's hermitage?and its first receptacle; he wanders in torture as he wanders under the influence of Kama's fire. Finally, he is released from his pain by a ritual of X2i Brahma Purdna, 110. 85-210. 124 Siva Purdna, Dharmasarnhita, 11. 28-35. m Brahma Purdna, 110. 124. !"

The fire which haunts Siva retains its erotic connotations even in this myth; for Parvati must be present when Siva is cured, as she is in the Pine Forest. 8. Siva as the mare-fire beneath the sea. In some texts, Siva engenders the mare-fire with the blaze of his third eye. Certain descriptions of the battle between Siva and Kama allow Siva to restrain or distribute in various ways the fire of anger which has reduced Kama to ashes;129 but as this fire is expressly said to be the fire of doomsday, there is one inevitable resting place for it: the ocean. Kama deluded Siva, arousing him, and when Siva realized that Kama was attacking him he released a fire from his third eye, burning Kama to ashes. The fire, having come from Siva's eye, could never return to Siva; moreover, Brahma had paralyzed the fire in a vain attempt to shield Kama. When Siva had vanished, the fire began to burn the gods and all the universe. The gods sought refuge with Brahma, who made the fire of Siva's anger into a mare with gentle [saumya] flames issuing from her mouth. Then Brahma took the mare to the ocean and said, "This mare is the fire of Siva's anger; having burnt Kama, it wishes to burn the whole universe. I gave it the form of a mare; now you must bear it until the final deluge, at which time I will come here and lead it away from you. It will devour your water, and you must make a great effort to bear it." The ocean agreed to this, and the fire entered and was held in check, burning quietly with its halo of flames.130 A very similar myth is told about a conflict with Indra instead of Kama; again the uncon trollable, unreturnable flame from Siva's eye is placed in the ocean, but this time instead of producing "gentle" (or ambrosial) flames it produces the demon Jalandhara: Once Indra came with the gods to see Siva on Kailasa; Indra saw a naked yogi there and reviled him and struck him with his thunderbolt; but the thunderbolt was reduced to ashes, and the man's neck turned blue where it had struck, for the yogi was Siva himself. Then Siva glanced at Indra with the fire of his third eye and was about to kill him; but Brhaspati begged him to protect Indra and restrain the fire. Siva said, "How can I take back the anger that has come forth from my eye? How can a snake put on again the skin that he has sloughed off?" Brhaspati asked him to throw the tejas somewhere else, and Siva took it with his hand and threw it into the salt ocean at the confluence of the Ganges. There it took the form of a child, Jalandhara.131 The Jalandhara story is linked with the submarine mare by two incidental references: Indra, trying to justify to Jalandhara the churning of the ocean (who is considered to be Jalandhara's father), says, "Formerly the ocean was a refuge for my enemy, Mainaka, and also for the fire in the form of a horse that burnt all creatures; therefore we punish him".132 This is the only passage in which the ocean is considered to have helped the mare and harmed the universe by harbouring the fire. Elsewhere Jalandhara boasts, "I " Matsya Purana, 154. 250-255; Skanda Purana, 1. 2. 24. 42-3. 130 Siva Purana, 2.3.20. 1-23; Kdlikd Purana, 44. 124-136; Mahdbhdgavata Purana (Bombay, Gujarat Printing Press, 1913), 22. 108-111; 23. 1-4. m Siva Purana, 2. 5. 13. 1-50; 2. 5. 14. 1-4; Padma Purana, 6. 98. 5-19. 181 Padma Purana, 6. 5. 19-20.</page><page sequence="19">THE SUBMARINE MARE IN THE MYTHOLOGY OF SlVA 27 obstructed the mouth of the mare-fire and flooded the whole universe",133 a reference to the necessity of the fire's consuming the ocean water, just as it is necessary for the ocean waters to subdue the mare. In addition to these two myths, there are scattered references to Siva as the mare fire throughout Sanskrit literature. In the Mahdbhdrata it is said, "Siva's mouth is the mare's head".131 The three eyes of Siva are said to be the sun, moon, and fire, while his tongue is the subterranean mare-fire (whose tongue is fire).135 The fire of Siva's anger, the Aurva fire, and the fire of Kama combine in a verse spoken by the love-sick King Dusyanta to Kama: Surely the fire of Siva's anger still burns in you today, like the fire of Aurva in the ocean; otherwise, Kama, how could you be so hot as to reduce people like me to ashes?13* Once again the fire of Siva's angry asceticism has combined with the fire of desire. Siva is himself half fire and half water; he is fire and Parvati is water, and they are one. He is the ascetic fire which rages against the erotic power; and he is the fire of passion that cannot be controlled by asceticism. He is in this the image of the balance of powers in the universe; his flame blazes eternally, unquenched by all the floods of nature, like the flame within the sea.
