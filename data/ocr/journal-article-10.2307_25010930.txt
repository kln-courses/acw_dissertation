<plain_text><page sequence="1">DONALD LATEINER Deceptions and Delusions in Herodotus NOT EVERY SELF-INTERESTED charlatan is condemned in any society that values ingenuity. The Hellenes admired the lies of shrewd Odysseus, worshipped Hermes, patron of thieves and sharp entrepreneurs, and found admirable the hedgehog deceits and shams of Aristophanes' comic heroes.' Greek epic, tragedy, and comedy describe cheats and their dupes. After the development of history, philosophy, biography, and the later genres of the novel and hagiography at times would explore popular delusions and false prophets. History proper, from Herodotus on, supplies examples, large and small, of political, religious, and other entrepreneurs who hatch schemes at the expense of the credulous. Frauds require a knowing agent, usually one who works for his own profit or advance. On another hand, we have unplanned delusions, as when groups share a belief in a natural or supernatural event without anyone's being the richer for it. Individual or mass delusions and panics enrich the fabric of historiography and implicitly provide lessons for the attentive audience. Herodotus certainly plays to his Greek audience's pleasure in descriptions of deception and delusion, allowing the listener's or reader's amused perception of a different reality. The responsible historian tried to separate fact from fiction, sham from truth, charla tan from dupe and clearheaded exposer of deceit. Professors Deborah Boedeker and Carolyn Dewald provided penetrating queries and criticisms and generous encouragement of an earlier draft, for which I am most grateful. 1. E.g., P.

Particularly when the otherwise defenseless individual outwits the powerful autocrat, or the group to be victimized outthinks the armed and threat ening aggressor, Herodotus recounts in detail the survival of the (mentally) fittest. The phenomenon represents the Odyssean facet of Homeric Herodotus, indeed, but also such glorification of cleverness, moral and amoral, permeates not only Greek literature but Greek life, so far as we can reconstruct its reality as well as the response to literary representations. In the other, but related category of popular delusions and beliefs about the supernatural, any historian can only know what he or she has been told and should refrain from quick condemnation or even condescension. Classical litera ture represents generally the elite's view of mass spiritual phenomena, with all the prejudices that such a situation implies. Nonempirical phenomena seemed dubious matters to Herodotus, so his accounts of gods on earth, spiritualists, and oraclemongers are critical, or at least distanced from authorial credence. Never theless, he includes many accounts of Greek and barbarian popular spiritual movements, and he often recounts them without recourse to explicit condemna tion. Here the admired deceivers will be treated first. THE VIRTUES OF DECEIT Herodotus clearly admired conspicuous exemplars of human wit and pre sumed that Hellenic audiences would enjoy hearing tales of both ordinary and prominent men deluded, especially when their motives were ignoble and the upshot produced a form of poetic justice. MrlXavq, TEXVrl, oodprla, 66Xog, ajtaTl, false EtTtoTTzliY, with their related verbs and adjectives, are vocabulary keys to a storehouse of Herodotus's humor and narrative art. Oral informants then and now emphasize the roles of individuals, their self-serving motives, and foibles, mercenary and sexual. In an age of tyrants and despots, the whims and delusions of the mighty and the desperate maneuvers of subjects can be significant histori cal factors. We turn to case histories.2 The Milesian adventurer Histiaeus and the Athenian politician Themistocles are prominent in any list of celebrated Herodotean swindlers. Both wily devisers of their own remarkable success are presented as con-men who can inveigle their fellow Greeks and the Persian king into complying with their self-serving schemes. Other adventurers, both petty and great, also gain their ends after 2. L. Camerer, "Praktische Klugheit bei Herodot" (diss.

He had a natural genius for estimating the perceived self-interest of his audiences and "to impro vise what the situation at hand needed" (Thuc. 1.138.3). Herodotus likes to note the good consequences of apparently immoral, impolitic, or otherwise unwise actions (cf. 7.144.2, origins of Athenian sea power). Other figures exhibit single or multiple instances of their aptitude for survival through fraud. Democedes the Crotoniate physician concocted lies for himself and a charade for Atossa that gained him freedom from Persian house arrest and eventually return to southern Italy and a rich marriage (3.129.3-38). Herodotus's amusement at the wily Italian's schemes is conveyed by the vocabulary of deceit (TEXvd4^lv, 6L6aX06o a, ?x 66aX&amp;fg, 6okeQ6g voo;), Democedes' persiflage (130.2, 4), and elements of folk-tale comedy such as the request for a single boon and a battle over a runaway slave (133.2, 137.2-3). In other narratives, Spartan wives disguise their Minyan spouses as women to save their lives; Macedonian men disguise themselves as women to kill the lecherous ambassadors of Persia (4.146, 5.20). The motives in these cases of cross-dressing deceptions are self preservation and protecting honor. Artemisia's extraordinary skill in exploiting a lucky ruse at Salamis, whereby she escaped Greek attack and sank the ship of an ally, won Xerxes' commendation and a fortiori Herodotus's (8.87-88). She is acclaimed for both her strategic perception and clever impromptu survival skills (8.68-69, 101-3). The Samians assisted Periander's three hundred eunuchs-to-be by first instructing them to take refuge from their transporters in Artemis's sanctu ary and then fabricating an "ancient festival" with dances and dancers to provide the suppliants with sufficient food to prevent starvation at the hands of the furious Corinthian armed guards (3.48). The cultic evasion succeeded. Dolos is entirely appropriate to conserve lives, honor, and the deceiver's oikos, or to gain revenge. Herodotus approves, and an audience would be likely to share the Hellenocentric assumptions of his tales of deception.4 There are less savory, some less justifiable traps laid, however, which also deserve mention. Political treachery (66kog) traps or attempts to trap Tomyris, the Scythian king Ariapeithes, sundry Ionian tyrants, and the entire Persian nation in the case of the Magi (1.205.2, 4.78.2, 5.37.1, 3.65.6*). Various military deceits are admired for their effectiveness or intellectual 3. 6.1-4; 8.5, 75-80, 109.5-112. See Forrest (above, n. 2: 311-22) for an elegant analysis of the curious behavior of the successful mountebank Histiaeus. Even after death, he never lost the clever Darius's affection (6.30; cf. 3.85-7, 89.3). Zopyrus's self-mutilation to deceive the enemy and to win Babylon for Darius exhibits the extreme of loyalty as well as a most demanding false role (3.154-60). 4.

The Elean mantis Tellias devised a tactical ruse with a pretense of the supernatu ral. He had the Phocian troops near Thermopylae, his employers at the time, whiten their faces for a night attack. His fraud frightened their Thessalian foes, who fled in panic. The enemy troops thought that ghosts, a tSQag, were coming against them (8.27.3-4). Xerxes king of Persia is reported to have attempted a ruse to raise the confidence and morale of his Greek sailors after his expensive victory at Ther mopylae. Trying to present the military engagement that had delayed his ad vance as a triumph, he dressed up many Asiatic corpses to look like Lace daemonians, buried many others of his own (of the twenty thousand reported dead, only a thousand were left above the ground), and invited his nearby Greek naval allies to visit and view the contrived fate of his opponents. Many came, eager to sightsee; no boats were left to ferry other remaining hopefuls. However, no one was deceived by Xerxes' fraud, and in fact its clumsiness was laughed at by the perceptive Greeks. Xerxes had left the thousand Oriental troops strewn about Thermopylae, but he had had four thousand supposedly Spartan (and Thespian?) corpses heaped up in one spot (the number is suspiciously large even for this fabrication). A whole day was given up to the illusory pageant (8.24-25), but the deceit was transparent. The improbable Greek tale reported by Herodo tus served to bring Xerxes into contempt and asserts the limit of Greek gullibil ity, at least in the face of Persian military-political propaganda. The barbarian fraud is seen as such at once.6 The Aeginetans and other Greeks, in an attempt to fool future generations about their patriotic devotion to the Hellenic cause, constructed false memorials for their allegedly nonexistent dead warriors at Plataea (9.85.3, Xc(ccaxca X&amp;oa xetva Tv O eCtYLvoiEvcov eLvexev &amp;vOQdcO)v). This other incident of bogus fallen warriors attests to anxiety for the historical record in the generation that fought the Persian War, and to Herodotus's noteworthy belief that the men of the Great War would bother to try to impose a false belief on future Hellenes about their accomplishments. It marks an epoch in popular historical consciousness. The historian seems obliged to discover and report falsifications of the past. To 5. 4.201-2, 1.21.

The Salamis causeway that Xerxes allegedly built (8.97) in order to persuade his troops and his enemies that he would remain in Greece to fight another battle repeats the theme of the despot's trying to mask his embarrassing inadequacies.

He faults them for lack of probability, for internal illogic, or excess of logic, and twits other reporters for excessive credulity.8 He addresses on occasion prob lems of data, method, verification, and falsification.9 At the same time, he is reluc tant to discard reports of surprising and fascinating phenomena that may be true or even seem certainly false, or to reject without record even obviously overrational ized versions of biased informants. Part of his task seems to be the preservation of local accounts and explanations that he or his sources explicitly describe as fabri cated fictions, jokes, impostures, or unbelievable tall tales.'0 Often enough he leaves the reader unsettled, without the crutch of the author's judgment. Almost always, he distances himself from reports of phantoms and miracles by identifying the responsible source or by reporting recorded logoi in indirect discourse." 7. Deceit and fraud articulate many Herodotean tales. One must distinguish between ruses of the moment to deceive honest people and confidence games thought up long in advance that are designed to gain the extended complicity in illegal dealings of the immediate victim. The following are crooks or deceivers of the moment but not con-men by "profession": Glaucus the honest man turned embezzler, the builder's son turned thief who repeatedly foiled Pharaoh Rhampsinitus, and the clever groom of Darius who won for his master the throne of Persia by practicing a trick that depended on a horse's sexual odor. Darius himself earned the Persian sobriquet xnrnkog ("petty merchant" or "huckster") for his sharp and dubious dealings (6.86*; 2.121; 3.85-87, 89.3). Malice prepense on oath is employed on occasion for murderous and adulterous purposes that deceive the innocent (Etearchus, 4.154.4; Ariston, 6.62.2; Amestris, 9.109.2, with 110-11). Cyrus in fact charac terizes the Hellenes as a commercial people who meet to cheat on oath in their agoras (1.153.1*). Herodotus's Hellenized persona for Rhampsinitus thought the Egyptians the smartest race, and his audacious thief son-in-law the smartest of the Egyptians (2.121.g2). Egyptomania and the privileged place of Nilotic logoi and wisdom in Herodotus are examined by C. Froidefond, Le mirage egyptien (Aix, 1971) 115-207; for Apuleius's treatment of Egyptian exotic hocus-pocus, see J. Winkler, Actor &amp; Auctor (Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1985) 306-19. 8. Scyllias's nine-mile swim and Abaris's fast (8.8.2, 4.36.1); Alcmaeonid treason at Marathon (6.121.4); circularity of earth on geographers' maps and perfect equality of continents (4.36.2); werewolves, other Scyllias legends, and Hecataeus's Egyptian stories (4.105.2, 8.8.3, 2.123.1). 9. For instance, at 2.19-24, in his discussion of the nature of the Nile, a natural phenomenon, he rejects the first explanation offered by others for its poor reasoning, another explanation for plausible but allegedly incorrect proof, another account for obscurity and consequent impossibility of disproof, another for dependence on poets who are incorrigibly unconcerned with accuracy. 10. Disappearance of Hamilcar at Himera, Mardonius at Plataea (7.166-67, 9.84.1); Hellenic account of Getan Salmoxis (4.95); reports of wolves guiding men (2.122.3-123.1; cf. 7.152.3, 3.16.7); source of the Nile and Anacharsis's motive for travel (2.28.2, 4.77.2); griffins and one-eyed men (3.116.1-2). 11.

Herodotus reports with disclaimers gold-digger ants, Phidippides' conversation with Pan, Rhamp sinitus's crap games with Demeter (3.105.1-2, 6.105, 2.122-23). Detlev Fehling, Herodotus and His "Sources," 2d ed., tr. J. Howie (Leeds, 1989), argues that Herodotus is his own source, that refer ences to others are entirely concocted by the author (e.g., 87, 152, 248).</page><page sequence="6">LATEINER: Deceptions and Delusions in Herodotus 235 Some supernatural appearances and disappearances are reported almost as if they were ordinary, because the people who related these events to Herodotus accepted their possibility. Those who first heard or read him retelling these stories of the fantastic may have enjoyed the human experience of condescend ing to other people's gullibility. Furthermore, Herodotus likes to recount-on the authority of others-popular stories, floating fictions that remind him of the human will to believe and foiled selfish self-interest. A huge apparition ((d6oata) allegedly fought opposite Epizelus the Athenian hoplite at Marathon, and an other phantom, this time a female voice, was reported to have urged on the whole Hellenic fleet at Salamis. Demaratus's mother is said to have told him she had been inseminated by a phantom, the hero Astrabacus himself. Periander was reported to have successfully consulted by proxy the ghost of his wife Melissa at the Thesprotian oracle of the dead on the Acheron River (6.117.3, 8.84.2, 6.69.1, 5.92r12*). Herodotus himself does not believe that flesh-and-blood people vanish, but he reports that Mardonius's corpse was not discovered at Plataea in 479. His reason for mentioning this fact was to record a certified fraud repeatedly perpe trated on a Persian grandee. The act of sepulture of Mardonius after the battle was fraudulently claimed by many people from various nations who obtained rich rewards from his son Artontes (9.84.1; cf. 7.166, Gelon's careful but fruitless search for his enemy Hamilcar's body at Himera and a report of his vanishing). BOGUS GODS, FALSE PRIESTS, AND SHAM MESSENGERS OF THE DIVINE A catalogue and discussion of reputed religious fakers and charlatans in Herodotus illuminates the historian's special interest in theatrics of the super natural and cultic pretenses. In some cases, his informants may have been even more skeptical than the historian, who is open to diverse beliefs and practices in his sources. All these stories are somehow attached to the ethnographic or historical progress, but in most of these tales of supernatural entrepreneurial enterprise, human cleverness and fallibility in private life attract Herodotus's attention rather than historical acts of political importance.12 The human condi tion with its uncertainties gains the historian's compassion and indulgence, but no less-his amusement. Personal-interest stories elbow out national strategic concerns, at least for the moment, although some of these dramatic pretenses had long-term public consequences. His predecessor Hecataeus of Miletus and his contemporary Hellanicus of Mytilene seem to have been shaped primarily by critical tendencies of the Ionian Enlightenment and the Sophistic Movement. These writers recorded, synthe 12. W. Aly, Volksmarchen, Sage und Novelle in Herodot und seine Zeitgenossen (Gottingen, 1921) 239; A.

Camerer (above, n. 2) describes stories of technological prowess, military and political adroitness, and, in ch. 2, private, often folkloric ploys in the Histories (e.g., Etearchus's and Ariston's: 4.154, 6.62).</page><page sequence="7">236 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 2/October 1990 sized, and debunked accounts of geography, myth, heroic genealogy, and tradi tional chronologies. Neither occupied himself with the detailed description of recent major events and their causes. Therefore their subjects, largely distant in time, required them to be descriptive and then deconstructive, for instance, when "logically" separating the "historical" from the legendary Heracles or King Codrus of Athens (e.g., FGrHist 1 F 23-30, 4 F 125). Hellanicus uncritically recorded various chronological lists and tried, by various compromises, to coordi nate them plausibly. He also attempted to explain Attic customs by mythical precedents and etymologies. These two pre- or parahistorians had not developed a method equal to their ambition, the deconstruction of implausible tales of the distant past and the reconstruction of a reliable record. It is not clear from the scattered fragments of their books how they treated beings with spiritual preten sions, such as "Apollo-controlled" Aristeas (clearly a source for both), Pytha goras, or Salmoxis, but their intellectual orientation would not lead us to expect sympathetic accounts of supernatural claims, foreign gods, and parareligious prophets. Those of Herodotus's narratives that are based on myth necessarily suffer from the same analytic incapacity of the Greeks to separate fully myth from history in any specific instance. His methodological advance in this area was to isolate (by various narratological devices) such interruptions of myth from the narrative of recent events and to focus on what living memory could reasonably reconstruct. Unlike Hecataeus and Hellanicus with their rationalizations, He rodotus thinks it wiser to acknowledge the possibility of some surprising coinci dences and reports of the otherwise unknown than to cut every historical mystery down to common-sense proportions. The result may be less consistent (as we shall see in his bifurcated account of Salmoxis) but more satisfactory for extracting historical sense from misunder stood or garbled accounts. In the incidents mentioned above and below, which involve supernatural claims, Herodotus the enlightened skeptic struggles with Herodotus the patient recorder of belief, practice, and memory as encountered around the world he explored. Early in the Histories, we hear that Pisistratus and his cronies cunningly contrived (irnlXavovrat, oxevdocavTEg) to have him escorted back to Athens by the outsized but gorgeous woman Phye from the Paeanian deme. She was outfit ted and posed in glamorous disguise as the goddess Athena in epiphany (1.60). Either Athena appeared to honor her servant and promoter Pisistratus as he processed to the capital of Attica, or he piously escorted the patroness of Athens to her home on the Acropolis. Herodotus calls this sham Athena the silliest scheme by far ever (oxflta, jtrQfywa Ee0oEtc ov T ... InaxQCG), and it was success fully practiced on the usually percipient Athenians, who at this moment adored a merely human female. Herodotus points out that what separates Hellenes from barbarians is the former's superior cleverness and the absence of credulous imbecility, but he mentions this distinction here at the beginning of his History in</page><page sequence="8">LATEINER: Deceptions and Delusions in Herodotus 237 a context where it is plainly unjustified, false, clearly undercut. He adds that the Athenians were then supposed to be supreme in cleverness even among the Hellenes, but they were completely swindled by the tyrant and his impostor. This is one of several notices that chortle at Athenian victimization.13 Other explanations of this dramatic event than the one Herodotus chooses to purvey are possible, even probable. Pisistratus was a master of political propa ganda, including the use of myth and religion in promoting his political interests. "Con-men" and "victims" may be prejudicial or even wrong labels for this and similar relatively small and tightly knit religious communities. Pisistratus's ver sion of Athena may have been recognized by her peers in the fields as symbolic rather than a real goddess.14 The enemies of the Pisistratids and later generations may have misguidedly or, more likely, maliciously reported her to have been a successful hoax. Whatever the original event, in Herodotus's day, after more than one hundred years, such manipulation of religious ideas was deemed a real possibility. That is, religious fraud was a perceived reality. Religious con-men and deceivers hold a venerable position of distrust in Greek literature, as Homer can show (e.g., 11. 1.106-10, 12.237-43; Od. 2.178 84). Herodotus reports with amusement stories of the faked epiphany of Phye, the alleged ascetic and pilgrim Abaris, the reputed journey of Rhampsinitus to the land of the dead, the allegedly faked death and resurrection of Salmoxis, falsified Delphic oracles, fake Phocian ghosts, and an allegation that Deiphonus was a pretender prophet.15 The skeptical empiricist usually shows little sympathy for belief in supernatural interference in earthly affairs. Barbarians and Hellenes both fall for hocus-pocus and religious sham. Amasis shows the Egyptians that the golden idol they duly revere had once been his golden pisspot (2.172.4); the pharaoh serves his nation as a Sophist exposing religious impositions. Amasis refused to stay locked away always in royal pomp and to swell his dignity before his subjects, as his advisers urged, unlike the 13.

The imper sonation by one of the Magi of Cambyses' real brother Smerdis presents another story of complicity in a hoax of assumed identity.

Amasis also ignored oracular shrines that he observed to have been wrong in attempts to predict the future (2.174.2; cf. Croesus's experiment, 1.46-48). Perialla the suborned Pythia, at the bidding of a Delphian dynast, delivers the fabricated anti-Demaratan oracles that Cleomenes wants. Later both Del phians were caught and punished. The Alcmaeonid Cleisthenes had also success fully bribed the Pythia. 6 Barbarian Croesus accused Apollo at Delphi, the oracu lar god of the Greeks, of defrauding his benefactors (1.90.2*). The Athenian oraclemonger Onomacritus exemplifies either real life mas querading as Aristophanic comedy or, more likely, hostile Athenian oral tradi tion assimilating a few historical facts to the chresmologue's enemies' contempo rary political fiction. According to Herodotus, in his fraudulent audacity this prophet had "edited" Musaeus's collection of oracles and inserted forged verses. Lasus, the agent of Pisistratus's sons, caught him in the act, and Hipparchus expelled him from Athens. Later in Susa the Pisistratids rediscovered his super natural powers and praised his awesome abilities while the sham himself sang out rosy predictions for Xerxes, who was still reluctant to invade Europe. Onoma critus now prudently omitted any prophecies that boded ill for the Persian ven ture. The doctored prophecies persuaded Xerxes, who initially had no relish for attacking Greece, to change his mind (one of the many too many explanations that Herodotus gives for the overdetermined main event of his Histories).' Flexible oral tradition and Herodotus's account utilize the skepticism of the Age of the Sophists to defame the tactics of the exiled tyrants.

He was reported to have gone on a long journey, to have lived without eating for long periods, and to have carried an arrow everywhere.19 The legend is contemptuously dismissed between Herodotus's skeptical impatience toward De lian tales of long-distance travel from the inaccessible north and toward improba ble Ionian cartography with its perfect circle of Ocean, bilateral symmetry, and continental equalities too schematized for the real world (4.36, Eipqioo0W, X6Oyov . o . X?yco, yEX6). The Greek missionary of Apollo, Aristeas, a northern nobleman of Procon nesus in the Propontis, was believed to have written an epic poem Arimaspeia about his travels to the lands of the Black Sea.20 Herodotus cautions the quickly credulous that the author himself of this work called himself "inspired" ((polt36XaJrTog), and the poem was largely based on hearsay (4.13., &amp;xonf) from Issedonian Scyths (cf. 4.27) and made up in large part (4.16., j1oTLov iEcsa). The poet reported one-eyed Arimaspians, a nation of gold-filchers, and gold-guarding griffins, also Hyperboreans on the Northern Ocean, but did not claim eyewitness information (aViT0n6tTg; 4.13-16). Herodotus acknowledges only the existence of the gold and discards the fabulous creatures, if not the rest of Aristeas's bizarre report (3.116.1-2). Herodotus devotes more attention to a logos (4.14-15) that he heard in Proconnesus and Cyzicus about the apparent sudden death of the same Aristeas in a fuller's shop in Proconnesus. The reported story relates that he simulta neously appeared elsewhere (shamanistic "bilocation") and conversed on the road with a Cyzicene traveling toward Proconessus.21 The resulting dispute, when the Cyzicene reached Proconnesus, as to whether Aristeas was alive or dead and where he then could be found, was to be settled when the family came to the locked fuller's shop to collect and prepare the corpse for burial. No Aristeas, living or dead, in one place or the other, was found, the story related. Seven years later, Herodotus's sources continued, Aristeas the man reap peared in his home town, wrote his poem about the marvelous Arimaspians, and disappeared a second time. The Metapontines in Italy told Herodotus that he 19. Later authors such as Heraclides Ponticus (fr. 158 Wehrli), Porphyry (Vita Pyth. 29) and lamblichus (Vita Pyth. 135) describe this arrow as a kind of witch's broomstick for magical flight: Dodds (above, n. 18) 161 n. 32, Kindstrand (above, n. 18) 22. 20.

Guthrie, The Greeks and Their Gods (Boston, 1950) 193-200. Aristeas was almost certainly consulted by Hecataeus: Jacoby, FGrHist 1 F 194-95, commentary. 21. Here and elsewhere Herodotus collates several local versions of a given event or person: 4.15.1; 6.14.1; 7.150.1, 151, 152.3 fin.; 8.94.4. Fehling (above, n. 11: 106-15) boldly regards the citations as fictive, their agreements as impossible, and their purpose as the creation of an illusion of a tireless investigator by a man who sat at home. D. Lateiner, The Historical Method of Herodotus (Toronto, 1989) 76-90, inventories the alternative versions and argues for the historiographical value of preserving contradictory accounts. Theopompus (FGrHist 115 F 392) has a similar tale of a person named Phormio who experienced bodily transportation and a soul journey.</page><page sequence="11">240 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 2/October 1990 subsequently reappeared as a man (6 v iyv tov 'AQLoxeTsg) in their city.22 Aristeas at this time ordered them to build a statue of Aristeas and an altar to Apollo, who once had visited their city alone of all in Italy. Aristeas alleged that he had accompanied the god on that earlier journey (TO6E 6e) in the form of a raven (indeed, an avatar of Apollo). Then he disappeared a third and last time. In Italy they called him a phantom.23 Delphi endorsed the phantom's Apolline wishes, of course. The dedication was built as ordered and yet stood in Herodotus's day (xac viv). Aristeas's embellished legends clearly exhibit characteristics of Asiatic sha manism. The ability to bilocate, psychic excursion, appearance and disappear ance at will, metamorphosis into a soul-bird, materializing of the immaterial, connections with the northern god Apollo, northern Milesian colonies, and northern travels, a lifespan of centuries and the capacity for metempsychosis, all connect Aristeas with genuine aspects of Siberian "medicine men" or ecstatic prophets, not to mention isomorphic figures of Greek legend such as Pythagoras and adjacent peoples' reincarnation myths.24 Herodotus in this account collates ethnic traditions, calculates probable dates (4.15., ov1Lpakko6evog ... eiVQoxov), but keeps some distance from this Wunder leben by citing his sources, keeping the tales in oratio obliqua, and dismissing without prejudice the farrago at the end (toouavca eiQgaooo). Ecstatic trances were not the material he would dwell on. Incidents that appeared more suitable to supernatural fable than fact were not entirely to be eliminated because: (a) obvi ously partial or inadequate sources are not thereby false; (b) Herodotus wants to report instructive stories that he does not believe to be historical; (c) spiritual reality does sometimes oddly resemble suspicious fiction.25 22. Herodotus himself calculates that this reincarnation occurred 240 years later and re ports that Aristeas's labeled statue still stood in the Metapontine agora (4.15). A date ca. 650 is accepted by K. von Fritz, Die griechische Geschichtsschreibung 1.2 (Berlin, 1967), Notes, p. 21; Herodotus's calculation poses several difficult problems (cf. Jacoby, Nachtrdge [above, n. 201 553). 23. idoat:a: eight exx. of the (4av- root occur here in just seventeen OCT lines of text to emphasize appearance, whatever the reality. Apollo and his prophetic familiar, the raven: cf. the early fifth-century white-ground kylix at Delphi, J. R. Mertens, Attic White-Ground (New York, 1977) 181.64, also 184-85. 24. R. W. Macan in his commentary ad 4.14.1 (London, 1895) suggests that Aristeas is the son and double of Apollo. He was alleged to have written a Theogony (Suda, in Jacoby, FGrHist 35 T la [Addenda]) and to have possessed a soul with the ability to leave and enter bodies at will. Pliny (HN 7.174) reports that this prophet's soul exited from Aristeas's mouth as a raven. The shamanistic powers may be inference from Herodotus's narrative (Aristeas's works were already lost or of dubious authenticity in Dionysius's day: FGrHist 35 T 2), and the former achievement is credited to many wonder-workers.

Folktale elements appear in Herodotus in his reported stories and in his way of constructing "histories." Among the tale types, themes, and structures that Aly, Barnes, and others have noted (Aly [above, n. 12] Iff.; J. Barnes, "Egypt and the Greek Romance," Akten 8.

He begins his detailed account of Egyptian gods, myth, ritual, and dogma with a disclaimer and a caveat. Nevertheless his vision of iTogQi requires attention to the views of the supernatural that his subjects hold (2.3.2, 65.2; 9.65.2). A palmary example of his open approach is found in the account of the disputed divinity of Thracian Salmoxis. Herodotus approaches Salmoxis in two ways. The first approach is the cool anthropologist's narration, free of polemical references to sources or personal expressions, describing the ethnology of the Getae of Thrace, "the immortal izers," men who "believe they have a recipe for escaping death."26 These Thracians have a baiClov Salmoxis who is their only E65g,27 and they naively or chauvinistically believe no other to exist (4.94.4; cf. 2.3.2). They believe in personal immortality and that they join their Creator when they vanish from earth. They also believe in Salmoxis's own original reincarnation. Their Getic novel, either by direct development and inheritance or, as B. E. Perry argues, as an accidental result of the circumstances of the birth of romance (The Ancient Romances [Berkeley and Los Angeles, 1967] 37-39, 66-72, 340 n. 18). A partial inventory of folktale themes in Herodotus that reappear in extant novels includes the transformation of the Neurian people into wolves for a few days each year, the golden-age, paradisiacal life of the remote Ethiopians, the African nation of pygmy wizards, the special wisdom of the Egyptians, the wicked stepmother, the magic ring, suspended animation after apparent death, and buried treasure: 4.105.1 (cf. Petr. 62, Apul. Met. 1.9), 3.17-24 (cf. Heliod. Aeth. 9.2, Iamb. Babyl. in Phot. Bibl. 94), 2.33.1 (cf. Plin. HN 7.16), 2.160 (cf. Apul. Met. 2.28 30[?], 11 passim; Heliod. Aeth. 2.33), 4.154 (cf. Apul. Met. 10.2-12), 3.41 (cf. Philostr. VA 3.41), 4.95 (cf. Apul. Met. 10.11-12, Xen. Eph. Ephesiaka 3.5.11), 2.121, 150 (cf. Philost. VA 6.39). See the detailed study of ring fables in H. S. Versnel, "Polycrates and His Ring," Studi Storico-Religiosi 1 (1977) 17-46, esp. 35; and Aly (above, n. 12) 90-91, 229. Furthermore, looking at just one fabulous Herodotean character and his novelistic parallels from later ages, Aristeas and Apollonius bilocate, Aristeas and Peregrinus disappear and reappear, Aristeas and Pamphile turn into birds, Aristeas and Lucius experience transmigration of soul-into a bird and an ass (Philostr. VA 4.10; cf. Luc. Peregr. 40; Apul. Met. 3.21, 24-25; cf. also a beaver, 1.9). M. Hadas, "Utopian Sources in Herodotus," CPh 30 (1935) 113-21, analyzes Tendenzerzahlungen-essays in popular philosophy-that are reflected in Herodotus's work and later reappear in the novels. 26. I. M. Linforth, "Or 'A0avcatiovTeg (Hdt. 4.93-96)," CPh 13 (1918) 23-33, discusses and explains the nickname, and describes Greek "corner cults" founded on the belief in life after death. The Getae are brought into the historian's focus by being the only Thracian tribe to resist Darius's call for submission. They are described as "brave and just." 27. Herodotus makes a local Greek Olbian (or "Borysthenite") observer responsible for the story of Scyles' tragedy, a tale of a Scyt4ian's failure in cultural assimilation. This narrator indiffer ently uses these same two words (6aiLov, 0O6o) for supernatural being to describe one god, the cult of Dionysus Bacchus (4.79.4*), so it is unlikely that Herodotus intends a distinction between grades of divinity here. Herodotus is the only ancient source, of the many on Thracian and Scythian cults, to offer another name for this divinity: Gebeleizis (P) or, better, Beleizis (ABC). The first account in Herodotus seems relatively sound. Hellanicus of Lesbos discussed Salmoxis in his Barbarian Folk ways (FGrHist 4 F 73); Damastes of Sigeion, gateway to Thrace, is known to have discussed Orpheus and the Hyperboreans, but this was all too common (FGrHist 5 F 1, 1iB).</page><page sequence="13">242 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 2/October 1990 cult includes weather magic: shooting arrows at thunder and lightning.28 They also had a peculiar technique, reported only by Herodotus, for sending emissar ies for assistance to Salmoxis now dwelling in the Great Beyond. Periodically and by lot a messenger is chosen. Some men point their spears upward; others whip the elect high up into the air by his limbs. If, when he falls on the spears, he dies, Salmoxis is deemed propitious (4.94.3, i'beog). If the messenger lives, he himself is judged unacceptable and roundly abused. Then they try to send an other winner of the Getic lottery to the Beyond. Herodotus adds at the end parenthetically and with evident amusement-that they put in their requests for divine aid before the heavenly heave-ho, while the messenger is still alive.29 More relevant material for students of charlatans is the second, cynical and garbled version of Salmoxis's story purveyed by the Hellenes of the Propontis and Pontus, "Euhemerists before Euhemerus."30 They said that Salmoxis was no more than a Thracian slave of Pythagoras in Samos, that he became civilized in Hellenic ways and a learned student of that very wise man's lore. He subsequently won his freedom, got rich, and went home to bring the refined Ionic way of life (4.95.2, 6iairdv Te 'Ia6a xaCi iOeca POvcteCta; cf. 4.78.3-4) to the local yokels, his poor, savage, and witless countrymen (xax6o1oL, vrTa1QoveJoTeQol).31 Salmoxis, the story continued, after his return built a clubhouse retreat among the Getae, in which he entertained the Getan elite with ritual banquets and persuaded them (avar6L6oxLev) that neither he nor they and their offspring ever after would have to die, but they would come to such a place where he and the congregation would live forever and enjoy all life's good things after this mundane existence (cf. Trausic dogma, 5.4.2). While carrying on his preaching, Salmoxis built an underground apartment, believing that Pythagoras's message required some validation of a supernatural sort, as the unsympathetic Greeks explained. When the hideout had been com pleted, Salmoxis disappeared for three years, descending into the underground dwelling (xaratcag 6e x&amp;aTW eg To xaTayalov o'ixVtca). His companions missed and mourned him, a fact reported in what seems a liturgical or proverbial phrase: it6OEorv TE xcd E ivOeov. They behaved as if he had died, but in the fourth year 28. For fighting the unseen, cf. the Caunian expulsion of Calyndian gods accompanied by striking the air, the Psylli's declaration of war on the South Wind, and the Atarantes' cursing and abusing of the sun's excessive heat (1.172.2; 4.173, 184.2). For parallels from other parts of the world, cf. Eliade (above, n. 18) 53. For Scythian rhabdomancy, see Hdt. 4.67. 29. Both How and Wells and Macan ad loc. cite African parallels; Carpenter (above, n. 18: 112) quotes a similar Aino (Siberian) ritual for communicating with the unseen. Eliade (above, n. 18: 49) points out that the rite "reactualizes" Getae-god relations. 30. Macan ad loc.; see Rosen's testimonia in the 1987 Teubner edition ad 4.95.1. This Greek allegation of barbarian borrowing is likely to be the reverse of the truth. Pythagoras's doctrines about reincarnation probably derive from garbled accounts of barbarian religion: cf. W. K. C. Guthrie, A History of Greek Philosophy (Cambridge, 1962) 1.159. 31. F. Hartog, Le miroir d'Herodote (Paris, 1980) 81-127, discusses the "otherness" of Salmoxis and the cultural frontiers that he, Anacharsis, and Scyles all violated.</page><page sequence="14">LATEINER: Deceptions and Delusions in Herodotus 243 he reappeared and thus proved (without perfect logic, it may be said) the truth of his dogma: oiVTc MOLavac v oq)l eyeT'o rt eiXey (4.95.5). To Herodotus's Greek informants, the disappearance was a fraud practiced to gain the respect of credu lous savages.3 Herodotus opens and closes both the native Getic account and the reported Hellenic account that demeans the god to a slave and a hoax with distancing and disclaiming source references (vogiovao, (px&amp;[evoO, xxT). At the end, he adds a sound objection to the derisory Greek version: he believes Salmoxis lived, if he lived, long before the Samian "sophist" Pythagoras.33 As to Salmoxis's under ground retreat, he personally does not disbelieve or believe it "a whole lot" (Tl kiYv). Whether a man Salmoxis ever existed or whether he is a local Getic daemon, Herodotus here dismisses the whole matter, presumably as a question beyond the scope of his historiography. He maintains his unique openness, equally rejecting Greek positivist reductiveness and Thracian certainties about the inhabitants of the divine realm.34 The Greek account of Salmoxis is a travesty of Asiatic shamanism, however, an interpretatio Graeca of an alien religion in which Pythagoras's strangeness is used to "read" Salmoxism as it had been used by Herodotus to read Egyptian belief in 2.37 and 81.35 Among the characteristics of shamanism, observe the long sleep, often the mimicry of an underworld journey; occultation or sudden disappearance and reappearance, usually the shaman's novitiate; the uncertainty of status as mortal or immortal being;36 the attempt to reestablish communica 32. Sophocles' Orestes (El. 62-65) describes this as a common trick of religious frauds. See also Aly (above, n. 12) 130-31, 250. 33. The word here carried no "dyslogistic force": Macan ad loc.; Hartog (above, n. 31: 106), inter alios, compares [Eur.] Rhesus 949ff., which mentions the Thracian "sophist" Orpheus. Guthrie (above, n. 30: 166 n. 3) oddly believes it means no more than "poet" in this play and is irrelevant to the Herodotean passage. Cf. H. Diels and W. Kranz, Die Fragmente der Vorsokratiker (Berlin, 1951), 6th ed., 14 A 1-21. 34. 4.96; cf. Hartog (above, n. 31) 124-25. See Lateiner (above, n. 21) 76-108. If any prefer ence can be discerned, the first account offers no references to informants, by which habit the historian usually distances himself from legomena. Had the story of Salmoxis ended in apotheosis, we would meet a combination of man and god; [Euripides's] Rhesus enjoys this solution (cf. n. 36, below). 35. Hartog (above, n. 31) 103-4, 126; he also cites Aristophon's comic account in his Pythagorist: D.L. 8.38-39; further, J. M. Edmonds, The Fragments of Attic Comedy, vol. 2 (Amster dam, 1959) pp. 524-27, F 9-13. Greek parochialism translated an alien and disturbing Salmoxism into terms comfortable for Greek ideas about communication with the beyond. On Greek acquain tance with shamanism, see Dodds (above, n. 18) 140-42. Herodotus asserts that Greek Pythago reanism falsely claims to have originated doctrines of metempsychosis that are really Egyptian (2.123). In other words, he sooner credits the long-memoried and civilized Egyptians than the nomadic and uneducated (4.46.1) northerners. In fact, the southeastern Europeans did hold such beliefs, and Egyptian religion held no such doctrine (Eliade [above, n. 181 passim, Guthrie [above, n. 30) 162). J. Bremmer, The Early Greek Concepts of the Soul (Princeton, 1983) 24-49, disconnects Aristeas's and Abasis's ecstasy and soul-wandering from Central Asiatic shamanism. 36. For av0p(oro6acot(v., see [Eur.] Rhesus 962ff., esp. 971-73, where the Thracian king Rhesus does not go to the Underworld or remain on earth, but while hidden in caves under the</page><page sequence="15">244 CLASSICAL ANTIQUITY Volume 9/No. 2/October 1990 tion with the spirit world; the description of an everlasting life of bliss. This garbled Greek information ties the chapter to genuine characteristics of Dacian and Scythian religion.37 Salmoxis's chief doctrine, once correction is allowed for the misunderstand ings of Herodotus's Greek sources, was "a blissful postexistence," a state that required initiatory rites performed by a medium who can journey to the "other world." This symbolic death of the prophet in the Greek version marks a point of agreement with the purportedly real but beneficial death of the messengers to the beyond in the Getan version. Both accounts hold that the life beyond this one will be better and can only be reached by a special rite. Salmoxis inaugurates a new era for Getic believers by his revelation. The occultation and return "prove" his special knowledge. Historians of religion see him as a brother god of Dionysus or a prototype for shamans. In either case Salmoxis has occult knowledge of death and special powers "peculiar especially to the Thracians and the related Balkan and Carpatho-Danubian peoples."38 Parallels with Pythagorean beliefs and practices are evident.39 Herodotus's chro nological objection is sound, since the scattered and late evidence for Pytha goras's life points to a relatively late date, fl. ca. 530.40 The communal banquets, the emphasis on dining, the teaching about a better reward and immortal life after death, the descent to the world of the dead or a pretense of such, show the Greek version of Salmoxis reported to Herodotus to be clearly no more than a plagiarism of Pythagoreanism, no matter what the genuine nature of the Getic cult was. These activities make an alien ritual and silvered ground of Thrace will live on as a holy god for his initiates. Cf. Plato, Charm. 156d; Eliade (above, n. 18) 41, 56 n. 107. See Carpenter (above, n. 18: 113-19) for similar practices reported by later ancient writers. The ceremony could be one of death and resurrection from the earth. 37. From the related Scythian logoi of Anacharsis and Scyles, add music making with a tambou rine and all-night ecstatic dancing, although Herodotus attributes these to the Mother of the Gods (Cybele) and (Thracian) Dionysus: 4.76.4, 79.1, 4*. 38. Eliade (above, n. 18) 23-25, 35, 41, 43-44. Herodotus dismisses at least one Greek version of Scythian ways as a joke (4.77), and seems suspicious here. Nevertheless, he follows his principle of reporting significant stories that he has heard and thinks worth repeating regardless of his valuation of their facticity. Actually, even the travesty preserves some precious early evidence of European shamanism. Xenophanes (D-K 21 B 14-16) mocks anthropomorphic deities in general, Thracian ones in particular. 39. In the following inventory of Salmoxis's Pythagorean traits, reference is made to Diogenes Laertius's legendary but typical life of Pythagoras, 8.1-50. Descent into caves, 3, 41; into Hades, 4, 14, 21, 38, 41 (sham). Resurrection, confusion between human and divine, 11, 14, 41 (sham).

Pythagoras's doctrine of transmigra tion of souls through birds, fish, and animals may be alluded to by Herodotus, although metem psychosis is not named by him as such. Elsewhere Herodotus wrongly asserts that the idea is barbarian, specifically Egyptian, and the Egyptians believe in a 3,000-year cycle for souls. He accuses Greeks of wrongly claiming the doctrine of the immortality of the soul as their own, but he refuses to name the religious plagiarists (2.123.2-3). 40.

The Greeks ana logized alien practices, then recognized and criticized the "hoax." The Greeks found Pythagoras's doctrines and his sect already improbable, but his Ionian Italian school's ideas and doctrines were already recognizable, by now domesti cated eccentricities. The Greeks did not realize or care that the Pythagoreans' life and practices reflect various cultic acts of Greek mystery religions such as those of Eleusis, and many shamanistic features brought to the Aegean by travel ers to the north.41 The idiosyncratic historian Herodotus "sometimes writes for children, some times for philosophers," but sometimes, too, for the prudent historian. He ex poses palpable frauds, mercenary, political, spiritual, and cultic, while leaving the decision on other disputable instances open.42 Paranormal phenomena, Olympian epiphanies, and savage messiahs evoke his doubt, on empirical princi ple; but on another, quintessential principle, to wit, understanding alien and not so-alien peoples by honestly recording their versions of the past and of eternal verities, he preserves his informants' accounts. The result, to take an example from geography and history, for the Phoenician circumnavigation of Africa (4.42.2-43.1; cf.2.22, sources of the Nile) was the precious preservation of a startling historical achievement in exploration. The result for Salmoxis was the precious preservation of both genuine Getic cult practices and hostile Hellenic ethnocentric responses. Both the skeptical and the respectful strains in Herodo tus were necessary for the difficult achievement of inventing a reliable way of doing history, preserving the fragile traces of the past. APPENDIX Other historians share Herodotus's interests in deceit on the personal, mili tary, and political levels. A few examples must suffice here; readers will be able to supply more from the historians and from military writers like Aeneas Tac ticus. Word searches by index and computer of b66og, oxrlta, and the like, will produce copious materials. Thucydides constantly opposes appearances and reality, most famously in his passage about the "truest cause" of the Peloponnesian war. Here and else where, the contrast exists between the stated and real motives of political units. Less frequently, he opposes a personal claim of capabilities to a fact of duplicity and self-aggrandizement (e.g., Cleon, Alcibiades, Tissaphernes). The most 41.

The Segestans wish to persuade the skeptical Athenian ambassadors in Sicily that their poor city has unlimited wealth. In order to deceive their visitors, they carry borrowed gold and silver tableware from house to house for the embassy's various dinner hosts to display each evening (6.6, 8, 46). The Athenian envoys are sufficiently convinced of allied Sicilian resources that they advise the Athe nian assembly back home to form the disastrous alliance. Compare Oroetes' ruse of laying a thin cover of treasure over the stones in his money chest, a ploy that deceives the envoy of the Samian tyrant and soon lures the greedy Polycrates to his death (Hdt. 3.123.2-124). In both cases victims' elaborate precautions to preclude deception fail-because greed overwhelms caution. Ephorus described Lysander's complex attempt to impose himself on his countrymen as king.43 Spartans had always, at least in public, taken Delphic messages seriously.44 Lysander attempted and failed to bribe priestesses and priests at Delphi and Dodona, and at the African oracle of Ammon (which last alone denounced Lysander to the Spartan authorities). Lysander arranged an intricate plot (nrkaoo[a) at Delphi woven about a certain Silenus, a Pontic youth said to have been begotten by Apollo. Many believed and many disbelieved that story. Reputable people, however, supported it and also brought reports back to Sparta of secret tablets of hoary antiquity that only a genuine child of Apollo might touch and read. Delphic priests who were part of the plot were to interrogate the child and approve Silenus as a true scion of the god. He would then obtain and read in public the prophecies and find among them the one for which the entire scheme had been contrived (rkXoal). This would say the Spartans should choose their kings from among the best citizens rather than accept those born to the purple. But before Silenus was old enough to act his part, the drama lost one of Ly sander's actors (6dalaTog ... Tov. . liyoxQITrv).45 The fraud to secure the Spar tan throne came to naught. The incident, if true, demonstrates the continuing influence of oracles, especially Delphi's (even after the Peloponnesian War), the living belief in Apollo, the widespread willingness to manipulate religion for political ends, and the ability of enterprising Greeks to organize a Panhellenic hoax that would have had major international consequences.
