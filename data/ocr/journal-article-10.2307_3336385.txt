<plain_text><page sequence="1">Speculations on Lega Figurines SANDRA KLOPPER The ritual context of the art of the Lega has become widely known through Daniel Biebuyck's numerous studies (see bibliography), yet possible inter- actions between form and meaning in their figurative carvings have remained relatively unexplored. Although Biebuyck accepts the need for a consideration of style-what he calls "textual" as opposed to "contextual" analysis in African art (1975)-he maintains that serious me- thodological problems may be encoun- tered if the formal configuration of an object is regarded as potentially meaning- ful or descriptive in itself. Referring to the sculptures used by the Lega in their initiation ceremonies, he writes that "the forms per se cannot be thought of as unambiguous or descriptive; uncertainty about their precise meanings is left wide open. It is part of the purpose of the rites in which the art works occur to make the meanings clear" (1977:64). Biebuyck's position is highly problematic in its implicit separation of style from the socio-cultural framework determining the subject matter of Lega figurative carvings. As Schapiro has perceptively noted, style may be regarded as "a vehicle of ex- pression within the group, communicat- ing and fixing certain values of religious, social and moral life through the emo- tional suggestiveness of its forms" (1953:287). Any understanding of the work of art will therefore remain in- complete if its ritual significance is divorced from the style (or formal con- 1. SAKIMATWEMATWE. IVORY, 13.1cm. MUSEE ROYAL DE LAFRIQUE CENTRALE, TERVUREN (MRAC). 2. KATIMBITIMBI. IVORY, 7.2cm. MRAC. figurations) and, indeed, the verbal sym- bols with which it is traditionally associated. In his major studies on Lega art (1972, 1973, 1977), Biebuyck has not ignored possible interactions between style and meaning in Lega carvings, all used in the Bwami initiation society, a social rather than religious institution that teaches cooperation among its members. He points out that the formal configurations of at least three recurring types of fig- urines tend to reinforce the iconographic implications of associated aphorisms or proverbs. According to Biebuyck, the first type, Sakimatwematwe (Fig. 1), a fig- urine with multiple heads or faces, generally represents "the man with many big heads who has seen an elephant on the other side of the large river" and is a reference to wisdom and discernment (1972:17). He thus seems to infer that the repetition of heads expresses the ability to see in many directions, figuratively speaking. He finds a similar conflation of visual and verbal symbols in the second type of figurine referred to as Kuboko Kumozi (1972:14, fig. 1.3), or "One Arm," a quarrelsome individual whose temper lost him a limb (1972:17); the disfigurement of the carving conveys the idea of physical aggression or violence. The third example discussed by Biebuyck is Kasungalala, "Peacemaker," who has his one arm raised (1973:pl. 66). It is associated with the aphorism "What shoots up straight; I have arbitrated Igulu (lit. 'the sky'); I have arbitrated something big!" Apparently it refers to the fact that the kindi, the highest initiates in the Bwami association, are granted the privilege of serving as arbiters in quarrels and feuds (1972:18; 1973: capt., pl. 66). Yet because Biebuyck never undertakes a thorough analysis of these carvings' formal configurations, he fails to elucidate the exact nature of the relation- ship that he discerns between their forms and the meanings associated with them. Nevertheless his discussion of several other types of figurines demonstrates close connections between verbal and visual symbols. For instance, the Lega 64</page><page sequence="2">refer to a phallic figurine as Katimbitimbi (lit. "what shivers passionately," or phallus) (Fig. 2).1 These carvings are worn by female initiates of the highest rank who participate actively in councils and deliberations-in other words, wom- en who have virile status, demonstrated by wearing or carrying the Katimbitimbi carvings (1973:175). Similarly, the Lega carve canoe-shaped pieces of wood, "an obvious reference...to a woman's vulva," which bears on the inheritance of women (1973:155). Yet Biebuyck remains con- vinced that there is a breakdown between form and meaning in most Lega figures: "Knowledge acquired during the initia- tions indicates that striking morphological variations may be meaningless, that identical meanings may be conveyed by different objects, that diverging mean- ings may be expressed by objects of the same type, and that any object can express more than one meaning, mainly because of differences in the contexts of usage" (1977:65). On the other hand, he notes that demands for carved fig- urines are often formulated in generic taxonomies and terms. In addition to the morphological types already men- tioned, there are, for instance, Waiyinda, or "Adulterous Pregnant Woman" (Figs. 3, 4), and her husband Kakulu ka Mpito, "Old One" (Fig. 10), who falls victim either to his adulterous wife or to Muko- bania, the "Divider" (Biebuyck 1973:202). Although apparently there are also a large number of what Biebuyck calls "semantic prototypes without corre- sponding proto-typical forms" (1973:161) -that is, figurines associated with a particular aphorism or meaning, but differing radically in style-the demand for specific types of initiation figures suggests that the forms of at least some Lega figures reflect or reinforce what he refers to as "the doctrines underlying the schemata," or their related aphorisms and poetic statements (1977:64). By using these verbal symbols to interpret form and by considering the stylistic relation- ship between different types of figurines, one can demonstrate the separation of Lega figurative carvings into two broad groups, mentioned by Biebuyck, that express the Bwami ethical code in con- trasting ways: "Basically, all Lega... statues fall into one of two categories of meaning: those that stand for bunene (good, good luck, perfection, greatness, achievement, success, and reputation) and those that illustrate bwanya (evil, bad luck, lack of moderation, and any other behaviour pattern that a real kindi should not exemplify)" (1972:18). Biebuyck does not, however, adequate- ly explore the implications of his observa- tion in a consideration of the communica- tion of meaning through style. His reluctance to do so can be ascribed to the ambiguity between the symbolism implied in some of the carvings' forms and the symbolism of their aphorisms; this he regards as proof of an incon- sistency between form and meaning. As Layton points out in his book, The Anthropology of Art (1981:109), Biebuyck's approach differs radically from Turner's. Whereas Turner, in his account of ritual symbolism among the Ndembu of Zam- bia (1967), argues that dominant symbols may be multivocal, Biebuyck stresses dissimilarity rather than unity in his discussion of Lega ritual symbols (Layton 1981:109). Given the apparently irrecon- ciliable methodologies of Biebuyck and Turner, Layton concludes that "it is impossible to know how far the Lega and the Ndembu differ in the constancy of symbolic values in their rituals...; or to what extent the apparent differences result from different theoretical foci 4. WAIYINDA. WOOD, 32.4cm. MRAC. on the part of the anthropologists" (1981:111). While this problem must be acknowledged, this paper aims to demon- strate that Turner's approach, which pro- poses that apparently divergent symbols may be related at a deeper level of meaning (Turner 1967:100), can facilitate an assessment of the relationship of style to meaning in Lega figures. The extent to which specific types of carvings may embody seemingly diver- gent meanings can be demonstrated by the sculptures representing Saki- matwematwe, "Mr. Many-Heads." In one example (Fig. 7) the associated aphorism, "The one who had the sign of beauty engraved on the cheeks no longer is as he/she used to be," does not refer to the idea of wisdom and discernment usually cited for this type. Biebuyck therefore suggests that its meaning, which stresses the transience 65</page><page sequence="3">of people and things, has nothing to do with the multifaced form of the carving (1973: capt., pl. 73). It could, however, be argued that there is a fundamental relationship between the notion of tran- sience, or of one generation replacing another, and that of wisdom and dis- cernment. For according to Biebuyck, the Sakimatwematwe carvings are also related to the Lega concern with con- tinuity and succession, expressed in the aphorism "One kindi dies, another kindi will be initiated; a father dies, his son succeeds him" (Biebuyck 1972:17). The multiplicity of heads placed one above the other in carvings of this type thus seems to give visual form to a complex but symbolically integrated concept based on a perception of the reality of change (or death), despite the continuity of ideas and values (wisdom and discernment) effected through the initiation of suc- cessive generations into Bwami. 5. MUZOMBOLO. WOOD, 14.3cm. MRAC. 6. NDUMBE. WOOD, 14cm. MRAC. According to Biebuyck, the figural carvings "are meant to sustain and illustrate diverse but essential principles of the moral philosophy" of the Lega (1977:65), and they therefore form an integral part of the complex system of Bwami initiations. Their primary function is to teach the virtues of social coopera- tion and cohesion to Lega men and women. The kindi, usually elders who have reached the highest grade of initia- tion into Bwami, are often referred to as "unifiers," "men of love" (malebo), and "men of peace" (kinkutu); they are also said to be "generous and responsible" (mukota wa kabilundu) (Biebuyck 1972:12). In other words, they have become out- standing examples of virtue and morality (Biebuyck 1973:57). Both anthropomorphic and zoomorphic carvings are used in the initiation ceremo- nies. They are remarkably diverse in style, ranging from the palpably three- dimensional treatment of Waiyinda (Figs. 3, 4) to the obvious planarity of Katanda (Fig. 8). Moreover, some fig- urines are highly abstract (Fig. 11), while others more nearly approximate the human or animal form (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 78; Cornet 1971: pls. 149, 151). Comparatively few combine human and non-human attributes: the figurine call- ed Mulima has a snake-like body sur- mounted by a human head (Fig. 9), and Katanda (Fig. 8) has a bat-like body. While such stylistic factors are un- doubtedly significant, others suggest a much more immediate relationship to the symbolic implications of the aphorisms: a study of several morphological types and their aphorisms indicates that sym- metry, balance, and anatomical com- pleteness are generally reserved for figurines illustrating concepts of virtue and moral uprightness, while asymmetry, anatomical incompleteness, and physical distortion are found in those expressing forces potentially harmful to the social cohesion and cooperation that are the aims of Bwami. Unfortunately, figurines conforming to what could be termed the normative ideal, that is, those that are anatomically complete and fairly naturalistic, have not enjoyed, in Biebuyck's major studies on Lega art, the extensive consideration given carvings that do not attain this ideal. The former are, however, fairly common and widely illustrated (Cornet 1971:275, pl. 148; 277, pl. 150; Plass 1957: pl. 40b). In the absence of aph- orisms known to be associated with these "normative" figures, it could be argued, albeit tentatively, that their harmoniously balanced bilateral symmetry and relative naturalism is the visual equivalent of the supreme value of beauty or order, ex- pressed musically by singing in unison (kubongu) (Biebuyck 1973:129). Signif- icantly there is a similar equation of beauty with the idea of harmony or in- tegration in the carvings. They are be- lieved to lack beauty-indeed, they are considered unfinished-unless their sur- faces are unified through "the shiny reddish or yellowish patinations that come with usage" (Biebuyck 1973:179). While several of the figurines discussed and illustrated by Biebuyck are clearly bilaterally symmetrical, none appear to conform fully to the normative ideal: some, though anatomically complete, lack a sense of three-dimensional bulk.2 Among these is a carving called Ndumbe, associated with the aphorism "May I die today; may the little neck be cut by a claw" (Fig. 6). This proverb, Biebuyck records, has several possible applications: it may refer "to the candidate who wishes his initiations were finished today; to the father who complains of receiving 66</page><page sequence="4">7. SAKIMATWEMATWE. IVORY, 18.5cm. MRAC. I evil treatment from his child; to the Lega man who, although he knows he will die soon, still wants to achieve kindi" (1973, capt., pl. 71). In one sense, then, the figurine seems related to a desire to reach the highest grade of Bwami initia- tion. However, in its reference to a lack of cooperation between parent and child, it is incompatible with the association's ideals. It is especially in carvings such as this one, where meanings are apparently contradictory, that Biebuyck doubts the relationship of form to meaning, particu- larly since an apparently adequate under- standing of Lega sculptures can be reached through the related aphorisms or through the ritual contexts in which they are found. Yet Turner's concept of the multivocality of symbols becomes relevant precisely in these instances and is reinforced through ambiguous or contradictory formal configurations within a single carving. It could be argued that while a sculpture may be fairly naturalistic, a reduction of form to angular, two-dimensional elements 8. KATANDA. WOOD, 30.9cm. MRAC. may counteract its identity with qualities the Lega regard as conducive to their moral philosophy. Thus a figurine like Ndumbe (Fig. 6), which is associated with the positive aims of Bwami as well as the forces against which it is actively engaged, will often be characterized by a contradiction of the relative naturalism established through its basic proportions. This tendency for figurines to give visual expression to seemingly incom- patible ideas can also be found in carv- ings said to represent Muzombolo (Fig. 5). These sculptures are sometimes asso- ciated with initiated women of high rank; but when they are said to represent Mulima (lit. "bat") and are displayed hanging head downward from a string, they are associated with the aphorism "Bat hangs with head downward be- cause of the bad word spoken by Sun" (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 76). Evidently, therefore, the symbolism of a figurine can be altered through a simple change in its ritual context. The essentially ambiguous meaning of Muzombolo/Mulima is not, however, 9. MULIMA. IVORY, 10.3cm. MRAC. indicated solely by its context within the initiation ceremonies. In the example illustrated by Biebuyck (Fig. 5),3 a medial line extends from head to foot, dividing the figurine into symmetrical halves. Symmetry is further established through the double zigzag profile of the body, which affirms both the human and serpentine qualities of the figurine4 while balancing the forward motion of the knees and breasts and the backward motion of the buttocks. The Muzombolo/ Mulima does not, however, have any arms, and its legs are not articulated as separate volumes. This anatomical incompleteness, coupled with the essen- tially two-dimensional quality of the body, is at odds with its basic anthro- pomorphism, balance, and symmetry, and seems to confirm the apparently irreconciliable aphorisms associated with the carving. That interpretation is reinforced by another sculpture belonging to this mor- phological group (Fig. 9). Lacking the breasts, buttocks, and knees indicated in Figure 5, this figurine is much more 67</page><page sequence="5">snake-like and is not bilaterally symmetri- cal. In fact, it is not characterized by any of the formal qualities associated with concepts of social unity and harmony. It is therefore not surprising that this example seems to represent Muzombolo solely in its negative capacity, that is, as Mulima, the bat hanging head down from the ceiling of the initiation hut (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 76). The formal and iconographic complex- ities evidently embodied in carvings of this type are further suggested by the verbal reference to bats as opposed to the visual allusion to snakes. Given this apparent disjunction between visual and verbal symbols, the Muzombolo/Mulima carvings encourage comparison with a Katanda figurine (Fig. 8). Despite its anthropomorphic face, it bears a remark- ably strong resemblance to a bat with extended wings. Although "Katanda" literally means "mat," Biebuyck stresses that it can also connote something bad because "the holes in the body of the figurine suggest the dispersal of ants and signify evil" (1973: capt., pl. 63). As with Mulima, its aphorism thus has essentially negative implications.5 Seen in conjunction with the round indenta- tions extending from head to base in the 10. KAKULU KA MPITO. PRIVATE COLLECTION, JOHANNESBURG. sculpture representing Mulima (Fig. 9), it could be argued that the apparent verbal and conceptual links between the two carvings are reinforced visually by the sharing of a similar motif. A formal relationship between these two types of carvings can, of course, also be discerned in the two-dimensional treatment of the body in Katanda fig- urines and some of the Muzombolo/ Mulima examples (Fig. 5). Coupled with their ambiguous identity, combining human facial features and animal bodies, the stylistic traits support the verbal associations with concepts of evil. Of possible further significance in this regard is the aphorism linked to carvings of snakes: "The children play in shallow waters; the ngimbi snake kills." It points out that one should not think lightly about the sacred things used in Bwami (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 94). While the proverb is apparently not directly related to Muzombolo/Mulima carvings, it may nevertheless be relevant to these snake- like figurines,6 particularly since it reaf- firms the negative connotations of the in- verted human-snake which the Lega refer to as a bat. This correlation of visual and verbal symbols to establish an intricate but coherent pattern of meaningful formal configurations is consistent with Bieb- uyck's observations in the field. He notes that "the characters represented and the meanings conveyed by art works at the higher levels of initiations are not dif- ferent from those at lower levels; the meanings are simply more abundant and more diversified" (1973:178). In other words, the complexity of the aphorisms allows for an increasingly sophisticated comprehension of symbolism at the higher levels of initiation into Bwami. But as the analysis of the Muzombolo/ Mulima carvings suggests, this complex- ity is probably as much a function of visual as of verbal symbols. Indeed, the former may even extend and clarify the latter, and are therefore not necessarily simple affirmations of meanings that find a more immediate or direct expression in verbal constructs. Not all Lega works of art embody complex multivalent meanings. Several morphological types appear to be linked solely with the idea of negative or harmful social forces like aggression or adultery. The Lega regard "warfare and physical violence [as] incompatible with Bwami, whose aim it is to eliminate those evils from society rather than make decisions about them" (Biebuyck 1973:135). They also believe that the kindi should never be quarrelsome, a concept illustrated by Kuboko Kumozi, which owes its physical disfigurement to this character flaw. Significantly, the severance of one arm precludes the possibility of bilateral symmetry. It is therefore through both physical mutilation and a consequent lack of formal equilibrium that the sculp- ture expresses a breakdown in social cohesion, and can thus be grouped with figurines that illustrate forces harmful to Bwami. Similar interactions between visual and verbal symbols, associated with the idea of social disharmony, are evident in other, commonly represented types of carvings. Among them are Waiyinda (Fig. 4), Kakulu ka Mpito (Fig. 10), Kakinga (Fig. 11), and Kasungalala (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 66). Further examples that appear, at least from the evidence presented in Biebuyck's studies, to be somewhat rarer may also be grouped with these carvings. Like the severely mutilated Kuboko Kumozi, Waiyinda (Fig. 4), the "Adulter- ous Pregnant Woman," is sometimes anatomically incomplete. The addition of arms might have balanced the distortion of the belly; without them the sculpture is top-heavy and ungainly. However, in Waiyinda figurines that are anatomically complete, legs and arms are generally short and squat and not articulated as separate volumes (Fig. 3). Visually, there- fore, the abdomen remains dominant. The resultant feeling of disequilibrium is reinforced by enlarged labia, emphasiz- ing the figure's sexual identity. It is hardly surprising that the apho- risms associated with Waiyinda carvings confirm the tendency to portray poten- tially harmful social forces through physi- cal deformity, imbalance, and asymmetry. Waiyinda, as Biebuyck notes, "died because of ritual pollution, (while) the enema funnel was still between the legs" (1973: capt., pl. 68). This aphorism seems to refer to her being found guilty of adultery during pregnancy, thereby causing ritual pollution, death, and misery in her family (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 67). Another figurine that is often deformed is the Kakulu ka Mpito (Fig. 10), or "Old One," duped by the adulterous Waiyinda or by Mukobania, the "Divider," who caused trouble by calling together people whom he did not know well for a beer party (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 69). Though Kakulu ka Mpito is not personal- ly responsible for ritual pollution or social discord, sculptures of this type are never- theless often executed either without 68</page><page sequence="6">arms or with arms severely reduced and undifferentiated from the torso (Cornet 1971:259, pl. 138; Biebuyck 1973: pl. 69). The lack of formal balance is augmented by an extremely enlarged head. Since Kakulu ka Mpito is a victim of antisocial behavior, it could be argued that it expresses the negative effects of, rather than the factors contributing to, discord in Lega society. Its formal and conceptual link to the Waiyinda figurines is further reinforced by the depiction of enlarged labia on some of the images (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 69), even though Kakulu ka Mpito is said to be the husband of Waiyinda.7 A conceptual relationship can be estab- lished between Waiyinda carvings and the more abstract images said to repre- sent Kakinga (Fig. 11). The latter have cursorily executed bodies and an over- large head, and they lack limbs and further anatomical details. Like Waiyinda, Kakinga is said to represent an adulter- ous woman, the only difference being that she was not pregnant at the time of her transgression. Significantly, the aphorism associated with her, "The little maiden used to be beautiful and good; adultery is the reason that she perished," apparently implies that her socially destructive behavior disturbed the social and ritual balance of the group into which she married (Biebuyck 1972:14). Another figurine illustrated by Bieb- uyck and said to represent Katindili (Fig. 12) has both arms and legs. It is, however, characterized by severe physical distortion: its legs are too long, its torso is compressed between shoulders and armpits, and its head breaks with the frontal plane of the body, thereby des- troying the possibility of a feeling of symmetry achieved through a balancing of anatomical details. Because of its association with the aphorism "Katindili calls for (people to work in) his new fields; those of the dry season will refuse him in vain," this sculpture is said to be a criticism of one who always talks of his plans for initiation but lacks the strength to persevere (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 75). In other words, the image communicates the refusal or inability of some Lega men to participate in the activities of Bwami, and therefore manifests the idea of social disruption. These analyses of possible form-content relationships in these figures can be extended to any Lega sculptures in which the related aphorisms and their possible meanings have been recorded. It is, however, important to realize that while 11. KAKINGA. IVORY, 10.9cm. MRAC. the moral philosophy of the Lega appears to be revealed in the formal schemata of their carvings, the sculptures used in Bwami initiation ceremonies can never be reduced to crude categories of meaning. Whether they are representations of essentially positive, negative, or even contradictory concepts, they are general- ly characterized by very rich associations that give breadth and depth to their meanings. The visual, and apparently symbolic, links between Muzombolo/Mulima sculp- tures and the ngimbi snake are obvious examples of this extension of meaning by simple association. A further example may be figurines carved with conical elephant-like legs that are not separately articulated. In carvings of Sakimatwe- matwe (Fig. 1), this feature can probably be linked to the fact that the kindi are referred to as strong men, "strong as the stampeding of elephants" (Biebuyck 1972:12-13).8 One could also try to interpret sculp- tures for which the meanings of associated aphorisms are either unclear or unknown. For although the aphorisms and ritual contexts of carvings undoubtedly em- 12. KATINDILI. IVORY, 11.9cm. MRAC. phasize or highlight certain aspects of meaning, Turner's belief that dominant symbols tend to be constant and can therefore be studied on a morphological level (1967:52) suggests that the generic if not the specific meaning of an image will always be accessible. Thus a figurine that appears to have a snake spiraling around its body (Biebuyck 1977:61, pl. 5) may well have a fundamental relation- ship to the Muzombolo/Mulima carvings. The intention of this paper has not, however, been to explore such tenuous links, but rather to focus on the known meanings of verbal symbols in order to reach an understanding of possible visual symbols. The close interaction between the ritual carvings and the moral philoso- phy of the Lega suggested through this approach is consistent with Schapiro's contention that the style of a work of art cannot be divorced from its socio-cultural framework. It also reaffirms Leach's suggestion that styles often give expres- sion to the ethical ideas of the societies in which they originate (1954:25-38).

KLOPPER, notes, from page 69 1. Some of the Katimbitimbi figurines illustrated by Biebuyck (1973:pl.99) are more phallic than the example in Figure 2. This can probably be ascribed to the fact that anthropomor- phic references are neither as direct nor as complex in the former carvings as they are in.the latter. 2. In addition to Ndumbe (Fig. 6), which is discussed here, Biebuyck illustrates an image referred to as Nyabeidilwa (1973: pl.70). Although anatomically complete, this figurine is characterized by a relief-like, two-dimensional treatment of the body and is said to represent the woman who continually abandons her husband to return to her own people. 3. See Biebuyck 1973: pl. 72. The same or a similar carving, seen in profile, appears in a photograph taken during the bele muno rite of the Intumbo Iwa Kindi (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 26). 4. Despite the snake-like qualities of Muzombolo/Mulima car- vings, Biebuyck insists that the formal configuration of these images is deceptive (1973:225). This problem will be dealt with more fully in this paper. 5. Although Biebuyck does not discuss the metaphoric im- plications of the aphorisms referring to the Katanda carvings directly, this aphorism also seems to give expression to the essentially negative, destructive qualities associated with these types of carvings: "I used to love you; fondling destroys good ones; it has destroyed Katanda" (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Photographs, page: 8: Enes Ramos 29, 30, 32, 33, 34, 36, 38 (bottom), 44, Inside back cover: Richard Todd 31, 35, 38 (top), 39, 41, 42, 43, 45: Maria Berns 37, 40: Barbara Rubin Hudson 52-56: Swantje Autrum-Mulzer 57, 58, 59, 61, 62: Jill Salmons 60, 63: Keith Nicklin 79: Mark Sloan 80 (top): Horst Kolo 63). The latter interpretation is reinforced by Biebuyck's reference to Katanda as a "seducer and person given to inconstancy" (1973:218). Carvings of the Katanda type (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 27) are, however, also characterized by a clear bilateral symmetry and therefore suggest association with positive as well as negative social forces. This is consis- tent with the fact that these carvings are placed in an initia- tion basket whose contents are said to give expression to the unity and autonomy of the ritual community (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 63). 6. Delange refers to the Mulima as "undoubtedly representing the water serpent ngembe" (Delange 1974:254). 7. The latter discrepancy is also noted by Biebuyck, who points out that Kakulu ka Mpito may have "female indica- tions.., yet its name suggests that it represents an old male initiate, since only old high-ranking initiates wear the mpito hat, made of the hide of an ambela monkey" (Biebuyck 1973:202). 8. The Sakimatwematwe carvings are generally said to repre- sent "the man with many big heads who has seen an elephant on the other side of the large river" (Biebuyck 1972:17). An interpretation of the conically formed base of some carvings as indicative of the strength of the kindi through a reference to elephants may also be of significance in reaching an understanding of the use of visual symbols in a figurine said to represent Beikalantende or Keitula (Biebuyck 1973: pl. 81). Although characterized by bilateral symmetry as well as an echo of the V-shaped mouth in the inverted V formation of the stomach area, this figurine has a conical base rather than separately articulated legs. While it has been argued through- out that anatomical incompleteness is generally associated with social disharmony, the conical elephant-like leg appears, on the contrary, to reinforce the positive attributes of the kindi. Significantly, Beikalantende celebrates the wisdom, strength, beauty, goodness, and profound thoughts of the kindi (Biebuyck 1973: capt., pl. 81). Bibliography Biebuyck, D.P. 1972.
