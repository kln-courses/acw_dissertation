<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERRICK'S FAIRY STATE BY PETER SCHWENGER Its fairy kingdom, as E. M. Forster once observed,1 provides the only real mythology that England can claim. As such, it has an interest-at times a common one-for both the anthropologist and the critic of English literature. To the anthropologist, the folklore of English fairies offers three related lines of investigation. Most predictable and proper to the discipline is the collecting and classifying of fairy lore, in all the variants that may be produced by separation in time and space. As popular myths, these may be used to illuminate the nature of certain English social structures. At some point in this process a second kind of investigation may be called for: the anthropological analysis of the fairy kingdom itself, in one of its major versions. A structured though imaginary society, it will have its hierarchies, its moral codes, its customs and taboos. Finally the anthropologist may wish to investi- gate literary works on fairies, as storehouses of information about individual folk beliefs and often as conscious articulations of the fairy kingdom's nature as a whole. Conscious artistry, of course, may press the commonly held beliefs into the service of an uncommon and personal vision. But to the same degree that this makes a literary work an untrustworthy informant about matters outside its own sphere, it makes the work an object of independent interest to the anthropologist. Within its confines he may observe the personal manipulation of the impersonal elements of myth, in a process akin to that of Levi-Strauss's bricoleur.2 The myth-maker/bricoleur uses parts of other structures-in the case of myth, narrative fragments and symbolic elements-and orders them into a new structure with a new function. The business of the structural anthropologist is to determine a myth's ordering principles at their deepest level, and the significance of these. It is an activity which he shares with the literary critic. A poem about the fairy kingdom, though unmythic insofar as it has a personal and particular author, may have been constructed through a process similar to that of myth; and the princi- ples of its structure may be just as much in need of explication. Especially in early seventeenth-century England a literature of 35 ELH 46 (1979) 35-55 0013-8304/79/0461-0035 $01.00 ? 1979 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">the fairies proliferated: Shakespeare and Jonson come most readi- ly to mind. But neither A Midsummer Night's Dream nor the masque of Oberon the Fairy Prince is cast in nearly such a quasi- anthropological form as that utilized by Michael Drayton, William Browne, Robert Herrick and his friend Simon Steward.3 Their fairy works are generally based not on narration but on description-of food, clothing, architecture, religious ceremonies and court customs. The appeal of such works arises partly from their miniaturism, which offers the world translated into toy: implicitly controllable, bounded by the limits of play, and of a delicacy to arouse wonder in the beholder. Partly, again, it arises from the spectacle of human cus- toms, understood as artificial, reproduced with natural elements. This evokes both the charm of novelty and, at a deeper level, a nostalgia for the natural. A return to a state of perfect accord with nature is, admittedly, impossible; man's self-conscious mind, for the Renaissance, distinguishes him from animal and vegetable, and ir- revocably separates him from them. Yet if a fusion of the human with the natural is thus precluded, the fairies represent that fusion as an accomplished fact, by expressing natural forces in anthropomorphic form. A reader of fairy poems may then play at a state of being which is in actuality impossible to him. The truth about these fairy descriptions, of course, is that There is an art, which in their piedness shares With great creating nature. (Winter's Tale IV.iv.87-88) To imitate man's artifices, nature is divested of her wholeness. The poems are constructed by an art of parts. On the one hand, the parts of nature selected for use are usually in conformity with the details of fairy lore at its folk level; and they are peculiarly associated with the fairies by such qualities as sexuality, transparency, richness or malevolence. On the other hand, the parts are selected and com- bined by the poet in accordance with his own structuring imagination-a civilized imagination which may be investigated by methods similar to those Levi-Strauss applies to a primitive one. Having said this much, we must admit that many of these poems lack such complexities, and are little more than a consistent series of conceits. The social structure described-a feast, a wedding, a re- ligious service-is an altogether familiar one. Translated into un- familiar elements it provides the charm of miniature and metaphor, but still in essentially conventional ways. No real transformation of structure is involved. An example is the fairy banquet in William 36 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="3">Browne's Britannia's Pastorals.4 The trenchers are "little silver spangles," the glasses are of ice cast in a cowslip mold. On such dishes a lavish feast is served, consisting of insects and small animals roasted, stuffed, and baked in pies. "It is all cooked and served up in the correctest manner," Kathleen Briggs sums up, "a Jacobean ban- quet in miniature."5 It owes more to the seventeenth-century curios- ity cabinet than to a mythicizing sensibility. To this we may contrast Robert Herrick's poem "Oberons Feast" and its companion "Oberons Palace," the subjects of this essay. (The texts of the two poems are printed after the footnotes.) "Oberons Feast" seems to have been Herrick's earliest venture in the fairy mode. Along with several other poems, including "Oberons Ap- parell" by Simon Steward, it was published in a pamphlet of 1635 entitled A Description of the King and Queene of Fayries. This earliest version of the poem was expanded and extensively rewritten for inclusion in the Hesperides of 1648.6 The six-line dedication to Thomas Shapcott was added at that time, promising that "these dishes gone; / Wee'l see the Fairy-Court anon."7 "Oberons Palace" accordingly opens with After the Feast (my Shapcot) see, The Fairie Court I give to thee . . . "The Fairie Temple: or, Oberons Chappell" is linked to these poems by its last lines, in which Oberon ... by the glow-worms light wel guided, Goes to the Feast that's now provided. Nevertheless this work will not be considered here. Though first in the sequence of events, it is probably last in composition; and it is separated from the pair presented to Shapcott not only by its dedi- cation to John Merrifield but, more importantly, by a very different tone. Miniaturizing in "The Fairie Temple" is used largely to estab- lish a perspective for satire, and satire that is complex and equivocal enough to pose its own kind of problems. THE MENU OF OBERON'S FEAST Menus, Roland Barthes remarks, have a structure analogous to that of grammatical syntax.8 They progress in a sequence which may be expanded or contracted by individual courses, but not rearranged completely so that, for instance, desserts would follow soups and would in turn be followed by salads. Such a menu would be "un- Peter Schwenger 37</page><page sequence="4">grammatical." As long as the basic syntactical pattern is conformed to, any number of substitutions is permitted-of words in language, of dishes in cuisine. With a first look at "Oberons Feast" an "ungrammatical" nature is apparent. The sweet courses of "sugred Rush" and the bee's bag precede the entrees, and what follows them are delicacies neither fish nor fowl, nor anything but sheerest fantasy. So far are these dishes from being "a Jacobean feast in miniature" that we are hard pressed to find for most of them any counterpart in English cuisine. We must therefore analyze the structure according to its own terms; and our first task will be to determine the nature of those terms. The structuralists have reminded us of how useful the determina- tion of parallels may be in the analysis of poetry. Parallels, whether of contrast or correspondence, may indicate the general lines along which a structure is organized. In the case of Herrick's poem, the major parallel is clear. The feast opens with one drink and closes with another. The first drink is A pure seed-Pearle of Infant dew, Brought and besweetned in a blew And pregnant violet ... Its multiple connotations revolve around the idea of innocence: it is "pure"; that purity is reinforced by the usual connotations of the pearl, which here is a mere "seed-Pearle," an infant of dew; and dew often (as in Marvell's poem) stands for the soul newly descended, still free from the world's contamination. This is in contrast to the final drink of the feast, which is plainly aphrodisiac in intent ("to bewitch / His blood to height") and sexual in imagery, in ways which will be explored later. At the feast's extremes, then, qualities of sexuality seem to oppose those of innocence. Drawing another parallel, we note a correspondence between the first drink and the bread set on the table earlier. It is A Moon-parcht grain of purest wheat, With some small glit'ring gritt ... Like the dew-drop, the grain of wheat is of the "purest" sort; and its association with the moon is again an association with sexual chas- tity. So strong is the urge to visualize that single grain of purest wheat as the moon itself that the "glit'ring gritt" too partakes of a visual effect like that of moonlight. A contrasting parallelism would lead us to expect, set against the moon, the sun; and its presence may be detected in the daisy, or 38 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="5">"day's-eye," which serves as goblet for the second drink. The sun is sexual insofar as he is a ripening and fertilizing heat, but functions here more particularly with connotations of sexual emergence. In "To Daisies, not to shut so soone" Herrick draws the general parallel between the opening and shutting of the daisy and the rising and setting of the sun. There he mentions the marigold as a flower which acts in the same fashion. The ideas of sexual emergence and with- drawal become explicit in his poem "To Marygolds": Give way, and be ye ravisht by the Sun, (And hang the head when as the Act is done) Spread as he spreads; wax lesse as He do's wane; And as He shuts, close up to Maids again. The open daisy goblet is, along these lines, contrasted to the violet goblet, with all its associations of modesty and retirement.10 We should, though, reserve a final judgment on such associations until we can view them in the full context of the foods that are ordered between these two extremes of drink, always bearing in mind that these foods may themselves be charged with emotional associations. As preliminary to our analysis we must note that the description of the insect musicians occupies a position that is reserved or set aside from the main structure of the feast. The diction itself stresses this: "But all this while his eye is served / We must not thinke his ear was sterv'd" (italics mine). The musicians are presented as an event that takes place simultaneously with the feast, not as part of the feast's ordered sequence. This insertion has an order of its own, though. Both the insects and the sounds they make progress from the most full-bodied to the most attenuated, from the "chirring Grasshopper" to the "piping Gnat."'" The ordering of this excursus is a clue to the kind of ordering that might apply to the feast as a whole: the relation- ship is indicated by the poet's parallel between what is served to the eye and what to the ear. As Oberon's eyes "begin to runne / Quite through the table," an order emerges which runs roughly from at- tenuation to corporality and back to attenuation again. "The homes of paperie Butterflies" still reflect the "parcht" qual- ity of the bread, and are a very thin and miniscule dish indeed. The "cuckoes Spittle"-a frothy secretion in which larvae are deposited on the leaves of plants-is larger in mass, but still more liquid than solid. The "sugred Rush" attains a solidity, however slight, on the vegetable level. This is quickly transposed, by the way of sweetness, to the animal level with the "Bees sweet bagge." (I make no distinc- tion between insect and animal here, since Herrick seems to make Peter Schwenger 39</page><page sequence="6">none. All animals mentioned are on the same scale as large insects and are indiscriminately mixed with them.) We, like Oberon, will pass over the Fuz-ball-pudding scorned as "too coorse" -an ironic touch in view of what follows. For the produce of the bee is replaced by the produce of the ant. Sweetness is dispensed with, and the way is prepared for a couplet listing items of progressively coarse, even repulsive corporality: . . . Beards of Mice, a Newt's stew'd thigh, A bloated Earewig, and a Flie. The four items, all at the animal level, are themselves arranged in an ascending order of corporality. The tenuous beards of mice are succeeded by a bodily part, and then by a bloated whole. The fly is no reversal of this tendency: it becomes positively cannibalistic when we recall that a "puling Flie" was among the musicians. It should already be apparent that the progression to corporality is not only a physical one but a psychological one as well. From the perfect purity of the feast's preliminary drink we immediately fall to the somewhat more solid but also more sullied "Cuckoes spittle." Both this and the "hornes of paperie butterflies" have, if not purity, at least a neutrality of taste. That neutrality is quickly "besweetned," as the dew itself was, and in the same way that any child-like inno- cence may naturally be considered sweet. Sugared rush is a candy appropriate for such a child. That sweetness continues to ripen, though, into the lightly erotic connotations of "the Bees sweet bagge," so often utilized by Renaissance poets in speaking of their mistress's lips. This dish metamorphoses into one with more plainly sexual and biological implications. The emit's eggs give way in turn to a couplet which is not only a collection of corporal elements but is loaded as well with a psychological awareness of what the knowl- edge of corporality entails. That knowledge of corporality is summed up at the centerpoint of the feast with an image of ... the Red-capt worme, that's shut Within the concave of a Nut, Browne as his Tooth. Though there is some ambiguity here, we can be pretty sure that the tooth is Oberon's. His is the tooth that eats the feast: by eating it he, like the nut, encloses it. The body as enclosure, as hollow round, is thus implicitly evoked by the reference to "the concave of a nut." The worm within that nut is also associated with the body and evokes 40 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="7">its deepest inner meanings as body. The worm will devour the body at death; but it is also a "Red-capt" phallic worm which seeks the body in life. These two aspects are fused in one image by Marvell in "To his Coy Mistress." When his mistress is in her grave, he predicts, Then worms shall try That long preserved virginity. In our worm within a nut, then, we have an emblem of the body's most fundamental characteristics-its mortality and its sexuality-an emblem itself enclosed in an image which evokes the body as enclo- sure, through the identification with Oberon's tooth. The fact that the dishes at this feast are seen to run through a psychological as well as a physical progression should surprise nobody who is familiar with Renaissance theories of nourishment. According to these, "Nourishments, whether they be of the vege- table, or animal kind ... affoord not only their corporall substance, but a spirituall matter also."'12 For instance, in Marvell's "Dia- logue between the Soul and Created Pleasure" the soul is told ... the Souls of fruits and flow'rs Stand prepar'd to heighten yours. (11. 15-16) Evidence for this theory was found in the fact that a man who is faint with hunger, when given only a little to eat, feels instantly a sense of revival, long before the food could have been digested and assimi- lated by his body. Because spirit moves more rapidly than matter, his fainting soul could be sustained immediately and "heightened" by the souls of what he ate. Wine, because it was so "spiritous" itself, was considered especially quick and efficacious in attaching itself to the soul of the drinker. It is natural, then, that the soul would take on some of the characteristics of that which nourished it. As in Milton, ... from these corporeal nutriments perhaps Your bodies may at last turn all to spirit . . . (PL V. 496-97) It all comes down to a rather occult version of the belief that you are what you eat. Consequently the dishes at Oberon's feast emerge with psychological as well as physical force. We have traced the feast to its midpoint, which we have seen both as corporal in itself and as an emblem of the knowledge of corporal- ity. After such knowledge, what sequel? The remainder of the feast is organized as an apparent reversal of the movement so far, and pro- Peter Schwenger 41</page><page sequence="8">gresses roughly from corporality back to attenuation. But a true re- versal is not possible, either in time or in poetry. The knowledge of corporality colors the nature of the new attenuation and makes it impossible to attain again the purity or even the neutrality of the feast's beginning. The imagery is tinted with elements of corporal- ity, false innocence, and a fantasy that anticipates the bewitching effect of the final drink. This new attenuation is distinguished by a more emotional tone than the essentially spiritual one at the feast's opening. The imagery now distills the awareness of corporality and reacts to it. So the "little Moth / Late fatned in a piece of cloth," which otherwise might be linked to "paperie Butterflies," finds it place beside the worm because of its enclosure in cloth, its destruc- tive activity, and its fatness like that of the "bloated Earewig" just preceding. The couplet of four items recapitulates some of the con- notations of cannibalism in the earlier couplet, but now on a fantastic level: "Mandrakes eares" and "Moles eyes" are in effect non- existent. "Withered cherries" shift the idea of death down to the vegetable realm, and the "slain-Stags teares" liquify it. Almost as liquid are the "unctuous dewlaps of a Snaile," with their parodic recollection of the opening dew. By the time we reach "The broke- heart of a Nightingale / Orecome in musicke" the process of attenua- tion and emotionalization is so far advanced that there is no tempta- tion to think of this as a meaty dish. Rather it is a state of feeling which bridges destruction ("broke-heart") and sweetness ("musicke"), as in the conclusion of Crashaw's "Musick's Duell." These antitheses are further resolved in the feast's final drink. From the nightingale's heart a transition is made partly by way of the reference to ravishment, in classical mythology the original reason for the nightingale's grief. In spite of protestations that the wine was "Ne're ravisht from the flattering Vine," sexual connotations still underly its description as "gently prest from the soft side / Of the most sweet and dainty Bride." This bride is probably no woman, but the meadowsweet or bridewort; still the plant bears that name "from its resemblance to the white feathers worn by brides" (OED), so that the woman is only removed from the literal level to the imagistic. The bride may fittingly be contrasted to the "Infant dew" of the opening. Both bride and infant are by implication pure. But the bride's virginity is so soon to be lost that it may contribute to an aphrodisiac effect (as in "Oberons Palace" the fairy king has his elves imitate "the cries / Of fained-lost-Virginities" in order "to excite / A more unconquer'd appetite"). Certainly such is the effect of this drink. 42 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="9">Finally, the wine at the feast's conclusion is a ritual counterpart of the bread that served as its prelude.'3 That the two are positioned at opposite ends of the feast rather than in their more usual juxtapostion can now be seen as a necessary concomitant of the poem's structural patterning. The progress of Oberon's feast from its opening to its end has been described in terms of two interrelated axes: a move on the plane of the physical from attenuation to corporality and back again; and a move on the plane of consciousness from a state of pure spirituality to a knowledge of corporality to a state of emotion, largely amorous. Abandoning infant innocence we have entered an awareness of our own body's nature, and subsequently a yearning for the body of another. The transformation is reminiscent of the archetypal trans- formation that every adolescent undergoes. On this general structure Herrick has arranged the dishes of his fantastical feast. Only at the level of fantasy could the transitions of the feast be fully realized. Yet similar transitions underlie more conventional feasts: any extended meal involves a series of transformations which are as much psychological as physical. The specific questions of innocence, cor- porality and sexuality do not bulk large at every meal, thank good- ness. But anyone who knows the feeling of having dined well can account for the simplest transformation of all: the prosaic, almost Puritan, "&lt;short prayers" of the opening couplet, which have be- come the far richer "Grace by his Priest" commended by Oberon when the feast has finished. THE MAP OF OBERON'S PALACE "Oberons Palace," it has been noted, is a poem so crowded with detail that the effect becomes almost sinister.'4 A rich and hal- lucinatory mode of perception is certainly appropriate to the "high fed" Oberon, who now-to borrow a phrase from elsewhere in the poem-brings his feast to a "wild digestion," while his blood is bewitched by the final draught of wine. The more sinister aspects of this mode are partly inherent in the basic idea of breaking down nature's familiar structures so that the parts may be recombined into new structures. Nature closely observed at a level beneath its famil- iar broad structures is always more frighteningly crowded than we expect. And when new structures are built up at this level from natural parts, their qualities as parts are disconcertingly apparent. Herrick is willing to juxtapose parts ordinarily incongruous with each other, so long as they can be made to perform the same function. The inner chamber, for instance, is lit by Peter Schwenger 43</page><page sequence="10">The glow-wormes eyes; the shining scales Of silv'rie fish; wheat-strawes, the snailes Soft Candle-light; the Kitling's eyne; Corrupted wood ... A chaotic and jumbled universe is implied. Again, "Squirrils and childrens teeth late shed" pave the floor by virtue of their similar size, but no distinction is recognized between animal and human. An inordinate amount of bodily parts, both animal and human, is used in the construction of Oberon's palace; and these carry with them the idea of amputation, which adds to the sinister effect. These, then, are qualities implicit in the de-structuring of nature. By what new structure are the parts now ordered? The poem is a description of Oberon's palace; yet its architecture remains vague, clouded by the very multiplicity of detail. Enough is given for us to realize that, just as in the feast, there exists no neat equivalent in Herrick's England. We are then encouraged once again to look for structuring principles within the poem itself. This time it is not so much a matter for analysis as for recognition. Beneath the descriptive details, and uniting them as a thread unites the beads of a necklace, lies a primitive narrative structure. The first indication of this is given almost immediately as the poem opens. Oberon is now high fed For Lust and action; on he'll go, To lye with Mab, though all say no. The joke, of course, is that nobody has any intention of saying no t him. It is purely as a result of his own wine-heightened imagination that Oberon is cast in the role of hero overcoming all obstacles. Queen Mab, when we finally encounter her, is also playing a role. Tucked into her elaborate ceremonial bed, she awaits the approach of Oberon less as a wife awaits her husband then as a bride awaits her bridegroom. For overture to their encounter, the elves make "the cries / Of fained-lost Virginities." Perhaps because the suggestion of a wedding night is so strong here at the conclusion of the poem, Daniel H. Woodward has been led to see all three of the Oberon poems as one long evolving epithalamion.15 But in Oberon as hero and Mab as bride we recognize rather a feigning version of two basic elements of folk narrative. The hero performs the action of the tale, progressively overcoming obstacles until he attains a final goal. That goal, in folk tales, is often a royal marriage. 44 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="11">If this idea applies to the beginning and end of the poem, it doesn't seem to cover the middle at all. What is there in these prolonged descriptions to associate them with a narrative context? Again we take our first clue from lines initiating the section. As Oberon and his guard set out, they a way Beat with their num'rous feet, which by Many a neat perplexity, Many a turn, and man' a crosse- Track they redeem a bank of mosse ... The "many" modes of intricacy in this evoke, to begin with, the idea of a maze-an idea which is given support at journey's end, when Oberon "winds/His Errours up." Now the image of the hero as threader of a maze unites both narrative and architectural- descriptive elements. Theseus first of all comes to mind, the more readily as he too "winds his errors up" by means of Ariadne's thread. But the Renaissance was quite capable of generalizing beyond this particular case. Numerous garden mazes represented allegorically the course of man's life;'6 and Emanuele Tesauro speaks admir- ingly of a great circular table of inlay-work on which episodes from Orlando Furioso were represented at intervals within a maze.17 Once the idea of a maze is implanted, then, description alone- especially such elaborate and convoluted description as Herrick's here-may imply a narrative "threading." Besides its narrative implications, the labyrinth may possess a mythic significance linking it to the poem's prevalent sexuality. In discussing the complex of meanings attached to the labyrinth, Mircea Eliade observes that the cave labyrinth (which is the kind we have to deal with here) was often homologised with the body of the Earth-Mother. Its penetration would then amount to the enactment of a sexual ritual. The number of marriages, in classical mythology, which are celebrated in caverns attest to the strength of these associ- ations.'8 Thus the "bank of mosse / Spungie and swelling" may appropriately evoke the mons veneris-an evocation strengthened by the references to "curious Brides" and "Citherea's Ceston."'9 The major qualities ascribed to the various parts of Oberon's palace are in keeping with this idea of sexual ritual. The bank of moss is described in images of fertility, concluding with the great-ey'd kine, Who as they lowe empearl with milk. The four-leav'd grasse, or mosse like silk. Peter Schwenger 45</page><page sequence="12">The complex paving of the yard draws on a good deal of superstitious lore; and superstition also decks the "holy Entrance" of the cave with objects that function as relicts and offerings. The dim, ambiva- lent light of the inner chamber suggests mysteries removed from the "glaring light of bold'fac't Day." All throughout there are reli- gious associations: the "more divine" breath of the cows (1. 39), "th'Aromaticks, / Which cense this Arch" (11. 44-45), the cave's "holy Entrance" (1.65), and perhaps even the "daintie Deitie" (1.99) who is both goal and reward. The descriptions themselves, though, are much more complex than this summary indicates. They are composed in what we may call a mosaic technique, taking our cue from Herrick's own phrasing (1. 47) in reference to the yard. The images, immediately after this reference, of cards, counters, and dies are not only elements of luck or fortune: they reinforce the idea of variation and combination within a context of play. Such combination-as we have already noted in the passage on the cave's lighting-is an essential part of Herrick's method. A wide variety of parts is brought together in the context of their common quality. Yet, unlike a real mosaic, the indi- vidual pieces or parts never blend into one entity, but assert their diversity and multiplicity at every turn. The light of the cave is . . . what weak beams Can make reflected from these jems, And multiply... The yard too is of the utmost piedness, and exults in it. "Many a Counter, many a Die" lies here, we are told, in an echo of the format ("Many a turn, and man' a crosse- / Track") used to describe the labyrinthine path. Another way in which the diversity of surface detail is emphasized over the palace's general features is through transition or transforma- tion. We move from one feature of the palace to another, and each of these has its own general qualities, as we have noted. But the shift from one quality to another is accomplished at the level of individual detail. The luck associated with the yard's counters and cards is introduced towards the end of the mound's images of fertility by the "four-leav'd grasse," which is extra fertile by virtue of its extra leaf and is also-as Herrick has elsewhere called it-"lucky four-leav'd grasse."20 The transition between images of luck and those of dis- carded bodily parts is made by an equation between dies "Half rotten, and without an eye" and the rotted ivory of "teeth late shed." 46 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="13">"The blew skin / Of shifted Snake" is a discarded bodily part which nevertheless begins the list of the chamber's furnishings, where it suits with "eyes of Peacocks Trains, &amp; Trout- / flies curious wings" by virtue of an implicit iridescence. The effect of such transitions is to counteract any tendency to split the palace into its major architectural parts. Though these may still be distinguished, the distinction is blurred by a descriptive technique that breaks down into multiple details both the general structure and the qualities associated with its parts. Those details, multiple as they are, achieve a unity of their own by virtue of a constant process of transformation. And this evolving transforma- tional movement, with its accompanying sense of multiplicity, di- versity, and claustrophobic elaboration, contributes to the idea of labyrinthine progress suggested by other aspects of the poem. At the labyrinth's center Oberon finds Mab in her ceremonial bed, which is described at length. In the course of description certain elements from Oberon's progress up to that point are recapitulated. To begin with: For either sheet, was spread the Caule That doth the Infants face enthrall, When it is born: (by some enstyl'd The luckie Omen of the child) A discarded bodily part, conjoined with the idea of luck, is charac- teristic of the imagery of the palace yard. Less likely is an association of the filmy gossamer blankets with, say, the twilight of the inner chamber. But most striking is the ... Rug of carded wooll, Which, Spunge-like drinking in the dull - Light of the Moon, seem'd to comply, Cloud-like, the daintie Deitie. The parallels to the initial bank of moss are undeniable. The bank is Spungie and swelling, and farre more Soft then the finest Lemster Ore. "Lemster Ore" is a very fine kind of wool from Leominster.21 The bed is not only covered in wool but is, like the bank, described as spongy. Moreover, it drinks in moonlight which cannot possibly penetrate to the inner chamber, but outside has caused the bank to sparkle mildly. After this, it is even possible to sense in the em- phasized airiness of the cobweb canopy hung with pearls an echo Peter Schwenger 47</page><page sequence="14">and transformation of the "Sweet Aires" above the bank, breathed by cows "Who as they lowe empearl with milk." The bed at the palace's center, then, suggests a recapitulation of the palace that encloses it. The itemization of Queen Mab's bedclothes in all their concentric layers suggests further that Ober- on, who has made his way to the palace's center, must now in the same fashion make his way to the bed's center, and under the same figure of a maze. Significantly, this figure is used by Herrick in the similar context of"A Nuptiall Song, orEpithalamie, on Sir Clipseby Crewe and his Lady," where we are told The bed is ready, and the maze of Love Lookes for the treaders . . . (11. 121-22) The "Maze of love" here, of course, has somewhat more to do with the body than with the bed; and this leads us to a final speculation. At the center of the bed's concentric layers, is it not likely that Oberon will find yet another recapitulation of his progress, and yet another maze, in the body of Queen Mab herself? The poem's last scrap of information is ambiguously worded: And now the bed, and Mab possest Of this great-little-kingly-Guest ... Depending on how we read "of," the king may be either the posses- sor or the possessed. One thing is clear, though: a distinction, possi- bly a sequential one, is being made between the bed's possession and Mab's possession. After considerable detail about the former, we are gently encouraged to imagine the latter. It is most natural to imagine the sexual act, for Oberon, as a recapitulation of what has come before: the penetration of a "swelling" convex through con- secutive layers of transformation to a center of infinite regress. CONCLUSION When Herrick decided to dedicate a work to his friend Thomas Shapcott he chose not just a revised version of his earlier "Oberons Feast" nor the new and more elaborate "Oberons Palace" alone, but the two together. He must then have conceived of the pair as com- plementary, forming a single unit. Our analysis of the two works has brought out ways in which this is so. The dishes of Oberon's feast are ingested, yet the essential movement of the poem is from within to without. The images of the poem move from a state of spiritual 48 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="15">innocence to an awareness of the enclosing body as a thing of death and sexuality, to a rich and erotic projection past the body. The poem's perceptual symbol is the concave-the body viewed from within. "Oberons Palace" carries on the erotic projection of the first poem in showing Oberon ready "for Lust and action." It then traces his penetration of the convex, past a series of elaborate decors, until he attains a sexual goal within the palace's center. The poems, viewed thus, only express at a deeper level what is plainly being described on the literal surface: a feast of accelerating richness and its erotic aftermath. Both of these actions are familiar, indeed commonplace, enough. Yet they are made unfamiliar, as Herrick promises in his prefatory rhymes, and not just because of their miniaturism and conceited elaboration. On the common structure of the event, in both cases, has been superimposed a new structure of meaning made up of parts combined into a mythic pattern. Oberon's feast and his palace con- sequently resonate with a significance beyond his personal and single experience. The experience's implications are universal rather than "commonplace." And in the commonplace experience re-enacted in terms of universal, mythic significance we have some- thing approaching the idea of ritual-an idea which is central to Herrick's poetry and to his mode of thought.

Book I of Britannia's Pastorals appeared in 1613, Book II in 1616. Book III, in which the fairy banquet appears, remained in manuscript until 1852. Herrick is similar to Browne in the use of a mushroom table, the preliminary setting on of bread, and the insect musicians. Browne, however, elaborates in such detail and digresses so often (to clothes, conversation, and satiric asides) that the sense of the feast's structure as a whole is sacrificed to the texture of wit. 5 Briggs, p. 63. 6 Three major versions of "Oberons Feast" exist: (A) the original poem in the 1635 pamphlet, entitled "A Description of his Dyet" (B) an expanded version found in Ashmole MS. 38, p. 100, Art. 117 (C) the text in the Hesperides of 1648. The variations Peter Schwenger 49</page><page sequence="16">in these texts that are significant to a study of Herrick's ordering principles are the following: 1. (B) adds to (A) the mushroom table and setting on of bread. 2. The musicians, invoked in (A) by an address to Orpheus on the page facing the poem, are moved into the poem itself in (B). 3. "Water'd" butterflies in (A) become "paperie" in (B). 4. (B) introduces the scorned fuz-ball pudding. 5. The red-capped worm present in all versions is prefaced in (B) not only by the pudding, but by the candied hairs of a dried canker, the bee's bag taken from the end of (A), ant's eggs, pickled maggot and a dry hip. It is followed by the "broyl'd inch-pin of a batt" before the listing of a bloated earwig and sugared rush as in (A). Mole's eyes and adder's ears, which originally followed directly after the worm, are moved towards the end of the poem. 6. The moth in (B) is preceded by three delicate items (the glowworm's fire, the "binding jelly of a star," the silk-worm's seed) and drops the four not-so-delicate items (a spider's ham, beards of mice, nits car- bonadoed, the blood of fleas) that followed in (A). None of these items, delicate or not, survive in (C) with the exception of the beards of mice. 7. (B) introduces the second drink, originally from a "daisy challice." 8. (C) adds the dedication to Shapcott. The sugared rush and the bee's bag are paired and appear earlier in the feast than in either (A) or (B). (C) now compresses the grislier items of the feast into a four-item couplet. Herrick's revisions ofthe Oberon poems are surveyed by A. B.

The essay may be found in Structuralism, ed. Jac- ques Ehrmann (New York: Anchor, 1970). 10 These associations are utilized by Herrick in "A Meditation for his Mistresse" (p. 88): You are a dainty Violet, Yet wither'd ere you can be set Within the Virgins Coronet. In Ophelia's lament, the withering seems to be that of virginity itself and is opposed to the connotations of the daisy: "There's a daisy: I would give you some violets, but they withered." (Hamlet IV.v.184) 11 The gnat is conceived of as so attenuated, in fact, that Thomas Randolph, in his Amyntas (I.iii.10) can call it "nothing but a voice." 12 Timothy Bright,A Treatise of Melancholy (1586) in James Winny, ed.

Because thou prizest things that are Curious, and unfamiliar. Take first the feast; these dishes gone; Wee'l see the Fairy-Court anon. A little mushroome table spred, After short prayers, they set on bread; A Moon-parcht grain of purest wheat, With some small glit'ring gritt, to eate His choyce bitts with; then in a trice They make a feast lesse great then nice. But all this while his eye is serv'd, We must not thinke his eare was sterv'd: But that there was in place to stir His Spleen, the chirring Grasshopper; The merry Cricket, puling Flie, The piping Gnat for minstralcy. And now, we must imagine first, The Elves present to quench his thirst A pure seed-Pearle of Infant dew, Brought and besweetned in a blew And pregnant violet; which done, His kitling eyes begin to runne Quite through the table, where he spies The homes of paperie Butterflies, Of which he eates, and tastes a little Of that we call the Cuckoes spittle. A little Fuz-ball-pudding stands By, yet not blessed by his hands, That was too coorse; but then forthwith He ventures boldly on the pith Of sugred Rush, and eates the sagge And well bestrutted Bees sweet bagge: Peter Schwenger 51</page><page sequence="18">Cladding his pallat with some store Of Emits eggs; what wo'd he more? But Beards of Mice, a Newt's stew'd thigh, A bloated Earewig, and a Flie; With the Red-capt worme, that's shut Within the concave of a Nut, Browne as his Tooth. A little Moth, Late fatned in a piece of cloth: With withered cherries; Mandrakes eares; Moles eyes; to these, the slain-Stags teares: The unctuous dewlaps of a Snaile; The broke-heart of a Nightingale Ore-come in musicke; with a wine, Ne're ravisht from the flattering Vine, But gently prest from the soft side Of the most sweet and dainty Bride, Brought in a dainty daizie, which He fully quaffs up to bewitch His blood to height; this done, commended Grace by his Priest; The feast is ended. OBERONS PALACE. After the Feast (my Shapcot) see, The Fairie Court I give to thee: Where we'le present our Oberon led Halfe tipsie to the Fairie Bed, Where Mab he finds; who there doth lie Not without mickle majesty. Which, done; and thence remov'd the light, We'l wish both Them and Thee, good night. Full as a Bee with Thyme, and Red, As Cherry harvest, now high fed For Lust and action; on he'l go, To lye with Mab, though all say no. Lust ha's no eares; He's sharpe as thorn; And fretfull, carries Hay in's horne, And lightning in his eyes; and flings Among the Elves, (if mov'd) the stings Of peltish wasps; well know his Guard Kings though th'are hated, will be fear'd. Wine lead him on. Thus to a Grove (Sometimes devoted unto Love) Tinseld with Twilight, He, and They Lead by the shine of Snails; a way 52 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="19">Beat with their num'rous feet, which by Many a neat perplexity, Many a turn, and man' a crosse- Track they redeem a bank of mosse Spungie and swelling, and farre more Soft then the finest Lemster Ore. Mildly disparkling, like those fiers, Which break from the Injeweld tyres Of curious Brides; or like those mites Of Candi'd dew in Moony nights. Upon this Convex, all the flowers, (Nature begets by th'Sun, and showers,) Are to a wilde digestion brought, As if Loves Sampler here was wrought: Or Citherea's Ceston, which All with temptation doth bewitch. Sweet Aires move here; and more divine Made by the breath of great-ey'd kine, Who as they lowe empearl with milk The four-leav'd grasse, or mosse like silk. The breath of Munkies met to mix With Musk-flies, are th'Aromaticks, Which cense this Arch; and here and there, And farther off, and every where, Throughout that Brave Mosaick yard Those Picks or Diamonds in the Card: With peeps of Harts, of Club and Spade Are here most neatly inter-laid. Many a Counter, many a Die, Half rotten, and without an eye, Lies here abouts; and for to pave The excellency of this Cave, Squirrils and childrens teeth late shed, Are neatly here enchecquered With brownest Toadstones., and the Gum That shines upon the blewer Plum. The nails faln off by Whit-flawes: Art's Wise hand enchasing here those warts, Which we to others (from our selves) Sell, and brought hither by the Elves. The tempting Mole, stoln from the neck Of the shie Virgin, seems to deck The holy Entrance; where within The roome is hung with the blew skin Of shifted Snake: enfreez'd throughout With eyes of Peacocks Trains, &amp; Trout- flies curious wings; and these among Those silver-pence, that cut the tongue Of the red infant, neatly hung. Peter Schwenger 53</page><page sequence="20">The glow-wormes eyes; the shining scales Of silv'rie fish; wheat-straws, the snailes Soft Candle-light; the Kitling's eyne; Corrupted wood; serve here for shine. No glaring light of bold-fac't Day, Or other over radiant Ray Ransacks this roome; but what weak beams Can make reflected from these jems, And multiply; Such is the light, But every doubtfull Day, or night. By this quaint Taper-light he winds His Errours up; and now he finds His Moon-tann'd Mab, as somewhat sick, And (Love knowes) tender as a chick. Upon six plump Dandillions, high- Rear'd, lyes her Elvish-majestie: Whose woolie-bubbles seem'd to drowne Hir Mab-ship in obedient Downe. For either sheet, was spread the Caule That doth the Infants face enthrall, When it is born: (by some enstyl'd The luckie Omen of the child) And next to these two blankets ore- Cast of the finest Gossamore. And then a Rug of carded wooll, Which, Spunge-like drinking in the dull- Light of the Moon, seem'd to comply, Cloud-like, the daintie Deitie. Thus soft she lies: and over-head A Spinners circle is bespread, With Cob-web-curtains: from the roof So neatly sunck, as that no proof Of any tackling can declare What gives it hanging in the Aire. The Fringe about this, are those Threds Broke at the Losse of Maiden-heads: And all behung with these pure Pearls, Dropt from the eyes of ravisht Girles Or writhing Brides; when, (panting) they Give unto Love the straiter way. For Musick now; He has the cries Of fained-lost-Virginities; The which the Elves make to excite A more unconquer'd appetite. The Kings undrest; and now upon The Gnats-watch-word the Elves are gone. And now the bed, and Mab possest Of this great-little-kingly-Guest. 54 Herrick's Fairy State</page><page sequence="21">We'll nobly think, what's to be done, He'll do no doubt; This flax is spun. * "Oberons Feast" and "Oberons Palace" from The Poetical Works of Robert Herrick, ed.
