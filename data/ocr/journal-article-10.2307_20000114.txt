EDDY RELIGIOUS PLURALISM AND THE DIVINE: ANOTHER LOOK AT JOHN HICK'S NEO-KANTIAN PROPOSAL John Hick offers one of the most sophisticated and influential pluralistic philosophies of world religions currently available. It is the purpose of this study to examine the heart of Hick's model - namely his answer to the problem of conflicting human conceptions of the divine. In the end, I contend that Hick's neo-Kantian subjectivist moment ultimately undermines his religious realism. In barest terms, Hick's pluralistic hypothesis proposes that the great world faiths embody different perceptions and conceptions of, and cor respondingly different responses to, the Real from within the major variant ways of being human; and that within each of them the transformation of human existence from self-centeredness to Reality-centeredness is taking place.1 The most critical conceptual problem facing this hypothesis involves the de facto existence of the often radically conflicting conceptions of divine reality throughout the world religions. The heart of the problem is this. Given Hick's pluralistic model, one would prima facie expect human perceptions of the single divine Reality to be relatively similar, or at least not mutually ex clusive, in nature. Phenomenologically, of course, this is anything but the case. The most obvious - and problematic - of these differences is the radical conceptual dichotomy between those religions that view the Real as a personal Being, and those that view it in terms of a non-personal principle, force, or ' absolute'. Thus, to survive the day, it is clear that Hick's pluralistic philosophy of religions must include a viable solution to this problem of apparently contradictory conceptions of the divine. I. JOHN HICK'S NEO-KANTIAN PROPOSAL2 The broad outline of Hick's current solution to the conflicting conceptions problem made its public debut in the mid-I970s.3 By the early I98os it was 1 John Hick, An Interpretation of Religion: Human Responses to the Transcendent (New Haven/London: Yale University Press, I989), p. 240.

EDDY being developed in earnest.4 One must turn to Hick's much-acclaimed work, An Interpretation of Religion, to find its most comprehensive exposition and defence to date. Here, his response functions as the central apologetic pillar of his pluralistic hypothesis. Hick's proposal is constructed from the two primary strands of thought that have informed his religious worldview throughout the last four decades: the primacy of religious experience and a Kantian epistemology.5 In its simplest terms, his proposal is an attempt to combine a realist understanding of religious experience that is, at the same time, seriously qualified by a critical subjectivizing element. Hick begins with the 'highly generalized' Kantian insight that the human mind actively interprets sensory information in terms of its inherent mental concepts.6 More specifically, Hick focuses on the noumenal-phenomenal distinction that allowed Kant to distinguish between an entity as it is in itself and as it appears in the act of human perception. By taking this Kantian epistemological principle and applying it - in a decidedly unKantian fashion - to human religious experience, Hick arrives at a synthesis that forms the foundation for his response to the conflicting conceptions problem. In fact, given Hick's proposal, conflicting images of the divine are not merely understandable, but are even to be expected. In Hick's words, I want to say that the noumenal Real is experienced and thought by different human mentalities... as the range of gods and absolutes which the phenomenology of religions reports. And these divine [phenomenal manifestations] are not illusory but are empirically, that is experientially, real as authentic manifestations of the Real.7 In this manner, Hick's model seeks to maintain a realist core, i.e. the noumenal Real, while nonetheless anticipating radically diverse under standings of It within the various religions. According to Hick, the key to preserving parity between the variety of religious conceptions of the divine is the fundamental insistence that absolutely nothing can be said or known about the divine in and of itself. As Hick clearly states: [The divine Reality in itself] cannot be said to be one or many, person or thing, substance or process, good or bad, purposive or non-purposive. None of the concrete descriptions that apply within the realm of human experience can apply literally to the unexperienceable ground of that realm.... We cannot even speak of this as a thing or an entity.8 Clearly then - if Hick is right - on the one hand, the divine in itself is neither personal nor non-personal; on the other, both personal and non-personal conceptions can represent authentic manifestations of the divine as perceived in the various religions. In this manner, he offers a religious realist - as opposed to a naturalistic - interpretation of religion, while at the same time 4 See, for instance, the essays comprising chapters 3, 5, and 6 in Hick, God Has Many Names (Philadelphia: Westminster, I980). 5 See Hick, Faith and Knowledge (2nd ed.; London: Collins-Fontana, I974 [1957]), p. viii. 6 IR, p. 240.

In An Interpretation of Religion, Hick fleshes out this basic proposal in two critical sections.9 The first represents an attempt to locate the rudimentary essence of his model, in terms of a distinction between the divine in itself and as humanly experienced, within the various religious traditions. The second explicitly develops the neo-Kantian proposal itself. The remainder of this paper will examine the critical elements of Hick's model, as discussed in these two sections, from a generally philosophical vantage point. II. THE DIVINE IN ITSELF VS. THE DIVINE AS HUMANLY EXPERIENCED Hick claims that his neo-Kantian proposal is essentially a complex philo sophical articulation of a more general religious observation - namely that an inherent epistemological rift exists between the divine Reality as it exists in itself and as it is humanly experienced. He supports this claim by offering evidence of this awareness in such diverse religious traditions as Hinduism, Mahayana and Pure Land Buddhism, Taoism, Kabbalist Judaism, and Islam, both in its traditional and Sufist forms. Within Christianity, he detects this insight in the traditional distinction between God a se and God pro nobis, as well as in Eckhart's mysticism, and the progressive ventures of such modern theologians as Paul Tillich, Ninian Smart, and Gordon Kaufmann."0 Hick identifies the root of this 'basic [inter-religious] assumption' as the conviction that divine reality is unlimited and therefore may not be equated without remainder with anything that can be humanly experienced and defined. Unlimitedness, or infinity, is a negative concept, the denial of limitation.11 Such a notion, Hick suggests, is logically entailed by the claim to divine ultimacy. For if the divine is limitable in some external mode, this would render it, by definition, non-ultimate. Part and parcel with the concept of unlimitedness is the equally natural and reasonable assumption that the Ultimate, in its unlimited ness, exceeds all positive characterizations in human thought and language.12 Hick garners support for this notion of divine ineffability - based on infinity - from a gamut of Christian theologians including Gregory of Nyssa, Augustine, Aquinas, Eckhart, and StJohn of the Cross, as well as from Hindu and Islamic traditions. He derails the criticism that making such a claim to ineffability is itself an application of a human concept to the Infinite by 9 See (I) 'The Real in Itself and as Humanly Experienced', pp. 236-40; and (2) 'Kant's Epistemo logical Model', pp. 240-6. 10 IR, pp. 236-7.

While he allows that 'purely formal and logically generated properties such as " being a referent of a term "' can legitimately be predicated of the divine, it nonetheless 'makes perfectly good sense to say that our substantial concepts do not apply to the Ultimate'."3 In this manner, Hick baptizes his radical neo-Kantian subjectivism in the pure waters of the classical Christian tra dition.'4 In response to this line of argument, one must begin by noting that the classical notion of divine infinity entails nothing like the type of radical epistemological rift embodied in Hick's model. It is clear from its use - at least within orthodox Christian tradition - that the idea of divine infinity does allow for some positive characterizations of the divine. Here, infinity is generally taken to mean not a radical and complete 'denial of limitation' in every sense of the term,"5 but rather (for example) 'that [the divine] possesses the fullness of all possible perfections'. 16 In fact, within the Christian tradition - including those very theologians that Hick appeals to for support - limitation of the divine, both inherent (e.g. the inability to sin) and self-imposed (e.g. the creation of the finite world and free creatures in relation to which the divine is delimited), is admitted without question. It is important to note here that even the more minimalist views of religious language - such as a fairly agnostic reading of Aquinas's analogical predi cation or, more so, the Areopagite's via negativa - still deal in the production of knowledge concerning the divine.'7 Hick's attempt to correlate his pro posal with the Thomistic model of analogy by offering the latter as a 'thought model' suggestive of his own hypothesis must finally be regarded as an apologetic failure. Certainly, arguments have been made for relatively ag nostic readings of analogy in general, and Aquinas's model of it in particu lar.18 However, even amongst those who interpret Aquinas in such a fashion, virtually no one would suggest that his understanding of analogy, or his dictum - 'Things known are in the knower according to the mode of the 13 Ibid. p. 239 (emphasis added). 14 While Hick ('The Philosophy of World Religions', Scottish J7ournal of Theology, XXXVII [I984], 232) has denied that his model owes anything significant to the notion of divine infinity, the fact that he nonetheless continues to devote a significant amount of space to it in the explication of his pluralist hypothesis (see IR, pp. 237-9) suggests that he is still gaining currency from this connection. 15 Ibid. p. 237. 16 Thomas Finger, Christian Theology: an Eschatological Approach (Scottdale, PA: Herald, I985, I989), vol.

Only by positing further undemon strated assumptions - e.g. that a finite being is limited to finite concepts, and/or that the concepts associated with an infinite being are themselves infinite - does this argument follow.22 Secondly, even among those who recognize some type of serious incom mensurability based on divine infinity (and here, Hick merely represents one example from the radical end of the spectrum), there is little agreement on either the degree of incommensurability or its specific effects on predication potential. In this light, it would appear that 'infinity' predicated of the divine refers figuratively (vis-'a-vis the mathematical infinite) to Its mystery and transcendence rather than literally to any particular unlimitable quality that would a priori preclude some degree of conceptual commensurability.23 And if this is the case, then 'divine infinity' becomes not a cause of or reason for incommensurability, but, at most - though not necessarily - an expression of such.24 Again, all of this is not to deny that the concept of divine infinity entails both mystery and transcendence. However, the most this would suggest, contrary to Hick, is that the divine can never be exhaustively known. To admit that we can never know all of the divine is a far cry from claiming that we can never know anything of the divine.25 19 E.g. see Gerard J.

EDDY Third and finally, a proper understanding of infinity also reveals the confusion inherent in Hick's view of divine ultimacy, a view which a priori disallows the divine the possibility of co-existence with any delimiting state of affairs. Paradoxically, such a view only gains ultimacy at the expense of divine sovereignty and flexibility. Moreover, it is difficult to see just what meaning it can have given the obvious existence of a finite cosmos, which -unless one opts for a pan- (or panen-) theistic notion of the divine - entails an external (if self-imposed) delimiting of the Real. All of this goes to show that Hick's model, rather than merely representing a recog nition of the relative epistemological humility that is called for by the various religions, exemplifies instead a hyper-subjectivism that outstrips any parallels in the religions by postulating a complete conceptual incommensurability between the human and divine. In light of the above, one is forced to question even the one remaining manner in which Hick himself aspires to speak of the noumenal Real. He suggests that by retreating from a 'strong ineffability' position, one can still make formal, logically-generated (versus substantive) statements concerning the divine. Apart from the pressing question of whether in fact Hick's model can escape a 'strong' notion of ineffability, a serious problem remains: namely, the fact that Hick's expressed instances of supposedly formal proper ties betray definite signs of a smuggled foreign substance. To speak of purely formal properties is to speak solely in terms of relation, with absolutely no substantive content whatsoever. But clearly to say that X has the property of 'being a referent of a term' does deliver some amount of substantive content. If nothing else, it reveals that X 'can be identified by some human language user,' and such a property breaks the bound of the purely formal.26 Hick's confusion of logical and substantive claims is even more apparent when he describes the Anselmian definition of God - 'that which no greater can be conceived' - as a formal statement.27 As Keith Ward notes, 'greater' carries with it such connotations as value, being rationally desirable, etc., all of which are substantial properties.28 Thus we are left wondering if Hick's model is justified in saying anything about the divine worth saying. Such a position serves to raise the spectre of the Feuerbachian challenge: To deny all the qualities of a being is equivalent to denying the being himself..... The denial of determinate, positive predicates concerning the divine nature is nothing else than a denial of religion, with, however, an appearance of religion in its favor, so that it is not recognized as a denial; it is simply a subtle disguised atheism.... Dread of limitation is dread of existence.29 26 Ward, 'Truth and the Diversity of Religions', p. i o. 2 IR, p. 246. 28 Ward, 'Truth and the Diversity of Religions', p. io. 29 Ludwig Feuerbach, The Essence of Christianity (trans., George Elliot; New York: Harper &amp; Bros., I 957 [ I 84 I ]), pp. I 4-I 5.

I 58.</page><page sequence="7">RELIGIOUS PLURALISM 473 Hick faces a dilemma here. If, in reaction to Feuerbach's challenge, he allows for some substantive knowledge of the Real, the heart of his pluralistic programme is betrayed. Thus, Hick is destined to walk that neo-Kantian no man's land that lies somewhere in an imaginary space between religious realism and a thoroughly subjectivized anti-realism. III. KANT AND HICK S NEO-KANTIAN PROPOSAL It is only with an examination of Hick's modified Kantian epistemology that the full force of his proposal's radical subjectivism is revealed. Hick spends a significant amount of time delineating the exact nature of his hypothesis' relation to Kant's own epistemology. Here, both detailed explication and qualification are critical to his thesis. A distinct, oscillating pattern emerges as Hick alternatively links - and then distances - himself from Kant. One can identify four important strands of continuity: (I) First, there is the use of Kant's noumenal-phenomenal distinction, which, when transposed from the realm of sensory to religious experience, allows Hick to 'postulate' a single divine noumenon as the common source of the various, often con flicting, human experiences of the divine.30 (2) Secondly, there is the employment of Kantian-like 'category analogues'. 31 Here, Hick suggests that the conceptions of the Real as personal vs. non-personal function analogously to Kant's categories of the under standing. Fleshing out this neo-Kantian parallel, Hick claims that, similar to the role played by time in Kant's system, the range of human cultures serves as the particularizing factor by which the two larger categories are schem atized, thus resulting in the range of human conceptions of the divine.32 (3) Thirdly, like Kant, Hick maintains that his use of the noumenal category is a negative one. That is, he does not mean to make any positive claims regarding the unknowable divine noumenon - a charge with which he is often faced. Rather, he wants to refer to it only as a necessary postu late - one required by his broader religious philosophy - by way of formal categories. Thus, as in his reading of Kant, Hick emphatically declares that the noumenal exists independently of our experience of it, and, accordingly he stresses that 'the phenomenal world is that same noumenal world as it appears to our human consciousness'.33 (4) Finally, Hick strengthens his association with Kant by offering cor roborating evidence for the general Kantian model derived from several modern disciplines. Specifically, he states that the basic Kantian epistemo logical programme has been 30 Hick was not the first to view religious experience in light of these specific Kantian categories; e.g. see Rudolf Otto, Naturalism and Religion (New York: Putnam's Sons, I 907); Robert A. Oakes, 'Noumena, Phenomena, and God', International Journalfor Philosophy of Religion, IV (I973), 30-8. 31 This term derives from William Forgie's 'Hyper-Kantianism in Recent Discussions of Mystical Experience', Religious Studies, XXI (I985), 208. Forgie does not, however, apply his critique to Hick. 12 IR, p. 245. 3 Ibid. p. 24I. 18-2</page><page sequence="8">474 PAUL R. EDDY massively confirmed as an empirical thesis by modern work in cognitive and social psychology and in the sociology of knowledge.34 There are, however, specific junctures at which Hick wants to distance himself from Kant. This explicit distancing actually serves as a preemptive apologetic for his proposal. It provides the context within which he can respond to two critical types of attack on his model: first, to those that criticize him for particular aspects of his model that conflict with Kant's ideas, and, second, to those that criticize him on the basis of problems endemic to Kant's philosophy. As noted above, he makes it abundantly clear throughout his discussion that the general distinction upon which his model rests - i.e. between the Real in itself and as humanly experienced - in no way depends upon Kant's philosophical insights. Rather, Kant is merely the one to have developed this general observation in the most philosophically detailed manner. Hick claims that Aquinas' similar dictum, that 'Things known are in the knower according to the mode of the knower', could just as easily form the departure point for a pluralistic hypothesis.35 Hick goes on to broaden his appeal by pointing out that every human being can arrive at the same basic insight via reflection on their own empirical experience. We all know that the same object can appear quite differently depending on a particular human observer's spatial location, the condition of their sensory organs, and their own unique recognition and interpretive abilities. On this basis, Hick does not hesitate to acknowledge those features of his model that are quite distinct from - even conflictive with - Kant's own philosophy. He notes two specific instances: (i) First, his decidedly unKantian shift of the noumenal-phenomenal distinction from the realm of sensory epistemology to the realm of religious epistemology, and the fun damental contrast between their respective understandings of religious ex perience that such a move evinces. As far as Hick is concerned, this presents no problem whatsoever. Simply because Kant did not choose to relate his insights regarding sensory experience to the realm of religious epistemology, this should not 'bar others' from making such a move.36 In fact, Hick's general apologetic response to those who bring Kantian-related criticisms against his model is that they do not apply given his transposition of Kant's ideas to the realm of religious epistemology. Based on this distinction, Hick feels that he can safely refuse to enter into the sticky nest of problems associated with modern Kantian interpretation.37 (2) The second acknowledged divergence from Kant involves the nature of Hick's category-analogues. Specifically, while Kant's forms and categories 34 Ibid. p. 240. Here, important sources for Hick include Peter Berger and Thomas Luckmann, The Social Construction of Reality (Garden City: Doubleday, I966); Michael Arbib and Mary Hesse, The Construction of Reality (Cambridge: University Press, I986); and the work of Clifford Geertz. 35 Cited in IR, pp. 240-I. Here, Hick also claims the same vis-a-vas the Muslim thinker al Junaid's maxim: 'The colour of the water is the same as that of its container.' 36 Ibid. p. 244. 37Ibid. pp. 240, 244.</page><page sequence="9">RELIGIOUS PLURALISM 475 are apriori, and are thus universal and necessary in nature,38 Hick's analogues are both culture-relative and contingent.39 And so, Hick's neo-Kantian proposal represents a complex attempt to allow for a pluralistic interpretation of religions, while still safeguarding his realist core belief that religious experience, ultimately, is a non-illusory experience of transcendent Reality. I suggest that his particular nuanced use of Kant, far from side-stepping common Kantian criticisms, only serves to magnify them: specifically, his proposal represents an intensification of Kantian subjectivity - transposed to the religious realm - and thus threatens any realist core with immanent collapse.40 Four lines of critique can be mentioned here. (I) First, those disciplines from which Hick garners supporting evi dence - particularly the sociology of knowledge school - in and of themselves suggest a fully constructivist/anti-realist interpretation of religion. While Hick makes use of such thought in one sector of his theory -i.e. in his relativization of phenomenal manifestations, he arbitrarily refuses it admis sion into those quarters of his model where it could do some serious anti realist damage - i.e. the insular sanctum that safely houses his postulated noumenal Real. Thus, Hick is found walking a thin, imaginary tight-rope, with threats to his religious realism, or pluralism, on either side. (2) Secondly, Hick's various attempts to distance himself from Kant serve to heighten, rather than dampen, the subjectivist menace. The general transposition of Kant's schema from sensory to religious experience is not merely 'very non-Kantian' in a benign sort of way.41 Rather, it is a transfer to an experiential realm where there is significantly less 'empirical' consensus or control. Thus, from the outset, one can expect that Hick's religious project will justly be exposed to subjectivist suspicions even beyond those directed at Kant's sensory-centred programme.42 (3) A third critical problem involves Hick's category-analogues. As J. William Forgie has shown, 'hyper-Kantian' readings of religious experi ence such as Hick's serve to intensify the already present Kantian subjectivist threat in at least two ways. As noted earlier, while Kant's categories - as a priori knowledge - are by definition strictly universal and necessary, applying to all persons of all places and times, Hick's analogues are entirely culture relative and contingent in nature. Hick explicitly acknowledges this first prong of Forgie's critique, but his only response is that such a deviation constitutes no rival system to Kant, since it is applied in a different experi 38 See Immanuel Kant, The Critique of Pure Reason (abr. ed.; trans. Norman Kemp Smith; London: Macmillan, I952), pp. 26-7, 72. 39 IR, pp. 243-4 40 For readings of Kant's noumenal/phenomenal distinction in an anti-realist vein, see Hilary Putnam, Reason, Truth, and History (Cambridge: University Press, I98I), ch. 3; Carl Posy, 'Dancing to the Antinomy: A Proposal for Transcendental Idealism', American Philosophical Quarterly, xx (I983), 8I-94. 41 Hick, God Has Many Names, p.

EDDY ential realm. Here he seems to miss the damaging subjectivist implications at the heart of the charge.43 Forgie's observation can be further developed through the additional insight that, given our 'age of eclecticism', fuelled by the modern spirit of individualism, religious 'traditions' themselves have been rendered unstable and contingent.44 Thus a second level of contingency reveals itself in Hick's category-analogues. Add to all of this the pheno menological observation that - even within the very same religio-culture system - one can often witness radically different experiences of the divine, just where Hick's model would seem to suggest a similar schematization. Each of these observations serves to implicate further Hick's proposal with a radical subjectivism, and hence scepticism. Another - and potentially more devastating - observation of Forgie's goes unaddressed by Hick. Forgie notes that in Kant's model, the categories 'shape' experience and thus ensure that it will take certain forms. But the categories themselves do not provide the content of the experiences they form.45 In 'hyper-Kantian' models, however, the subject-based category analogues (and one could add 'form-analogues') do contribute to the pheno menological content of the experience.46 And when it comes to Hick's model in particular, the contribution is clearly significant. This hyper-Kantian twist forces the conclusion that the human subject's religious category-analogues, schematized by their religio-cultural systems, can account for both the form and content of religious experience. And thus one is forced to ask what, in fact, differentiates Hick's neo-Kantian constructivism from the essentially identical reductionist, anti-realist models ?4 (4) Fourth and finally, considering the complexity - many would add internal inconsistency - of Kant's 'things in themselves' vs. 'appearances' schema, and the various interpretations, counter-interpretations, and accusa tions with which one finds it embroiled, anyone seeking to make use of it today must be prepared to enter the philosophical fray.48 As suggested above, Hick's relocation of the schema to the religious realm does not safeguard him from such questions, but rather actually exacerbates them. Thus, Hick's claim to immunity from having to enter into the thicket of Kantian inter pretation debate is unconvincing. One way in which Hick has attempted to avoid the radical subjectivist threat is by maintaining - as does his reading of Kant - that 'the phenom enal world is [the noumenal world] as it appears to our human conscious IR, p. 244 4 See Ninian Smart, 'A Contemplation of Absolutes', in God, Truth and Reality, pp. I84-5. 45 For Kant, 'the a priori, then, is merely relational, without inherent content' (Norman Kemp Smith, A Commentary to Kant's 'Critique of Pure Reason' [rev. ed.; Atlantic Highlands, NJ: Humanities, I992], p. xxxvi). 46 Forgie, 'Hyper-Kantianism', p. 208. " In this general regard, see Michael Stoeber, 'Constructivist Epistemologies of Mysticism: A Critique and Revision', Religious Studies, xxviii (1992), 107-I6. 48 In regard to the various interpretations and criticisms of Kant at this point, see Karl Ameriks, 'Recent Work on Kant's Theoretical Philosophy', American Philosophical Quarterly, xix (I982), I-24; Richard E. Aquila, 'Things in Themselves and Appearances: Intentionality and Reality in Kant', Archiv fur Geschichte Der Philosophie, LXI (I979), esp. pp. 293-5.</page><page sequence="11">RELIGIOUS PLURALISM 477 ness '.4 Such an emphasis is characteristic of a 'one world' or 'double aspect' - as opposed to a 'two worlds' - reading of Kant. (I.e. the noumenal/ phenomenal distinction signifies not two ontologically independent realms or 'worlds,' but rather merely the one objective world considered from two perspectives: as it is in itself vs. as it appears to human consciousness.) Clearly Hick does (and must) associate himself with such a perspectival understand ing of the noumenal/phenomenal schema, given the nature and claims of his model. The problem is, however, that his specific restructuring of the Kantian programme (which itself already stands in a questionable relation to a pure and simple 'one world' interpretation)50 exhibits just the type of devel opments that would serve to render such an interpretation implausible. Specifically, in a perspectival interpretation, to speak of the unknowability of the noumenal is simply to speak tautologically: it is to consider an object of a subject's knowledge as apart from that knowledge, and so - by definition - as unknowable.51 What, then, leads Kant to postulate the real existence of such a noumenon behind the phenomenal apprehension when, in fact, it is strictly unknowable? In large part, the answer to this question is that aside from such a postulation, it would be impossible to give any plausible account of the source of ' the empirical differences in shapes and sizes' of the objects of everyday experience .... Only what is common to all representations is, for Kant, supplied a priori by the subject in the act of representing. So the thing in itself must be posited and assumed to determine in some sense the raw material for any possible object of knowledge.52 But when a similar question is asked of Hick's neo-Kantian model - namely upon what basis he can make a realist claim concerning the divine noumenal Real - a comparable defence is not available. The simple reason for this is that, unlike Kant, Hick's subject-based categories them selves - as discussed earlier - contribute significantly to the supposed 'raw material' of religious experience. Thus, virtually evergthing of content - including the specific and varied 'shapes and sizes' so to speak -of the religious phenomenal manifestations can be accounted for by those religious concepts and sentiments found in the religio-cultural systems and/or in the individuals themselves. In Hick's hypothesis - again, unlike Kant's - there is nothing residual that requires the postulation of an 'unknowable' (divine) noumenon; everything can be adequately explained, via the human form/ category-analogues, apart from and without the noumenon. Hick would no doubt respond that such a charge ignores his claim that a 49 IR, p. 241 (emphasis added). 5 See the surveys cited at note 48 for problematic aspects of reading Kant in a purely 'one world'/perspectival manner.

But a counter-question reveals the practical insignificance of this claim: what 'information,' given the complete incom mensurability between human conceptual capacities and the divine, could ever make a distinguishable - and thus practical - difference? Or, again, upon what basis should one ever suspect that 'religious experience' includes an irreducibly extra-subjective element when, in fact, it can already be accounted for in its entirety as a purely projective exercise? Even on his own terms, the most Hick can allow for from the divine side of the experience is an undefinable apprehension 'at some deep level' of the human psyche, which is, of course, always then 'expressed in forms supplied by his or her mind'.53 Such non-informative 'information' hardly offers hard data in the religious experience. And thus, Hick's appeal to a non-human, trans cendently derived component in religious experience does not vitiate the radical subjectivism of his proposal. In conclusion, it would appear that the noumenal Real in Hick's system is rendered a purely unnecessary and unjustifiable construct. While it may exist, like almost anything in the realm of the 'conceivably possible', there is certainly no reason to think that it does. Clearly Gavin D'Costa's charac terization of Hick's position as a 'transcendental agnosticism' is more than accurate.54 It is critical to see here that there is virtually nothing that Hick can do to remedy this unfortunate situation; he is precariously situated between the proverbial Scylla and Charybdis. For the only way out of the jaws of the anti-realist constructivism implied in this critique is to reinvest the noumenal Real with the ability to deliver a decisive - and identifiable - amount of raw experiential content, above and beyond any human-based contributions. But this is exactly what Hick cannot do if his neo-Kantian model is to serve and protect his pluralistic agenda. And so, with Don Cupitt, one may rightly ask in regard to Hick's 'thin-line' religious realism, what, really, prevents him from taking 'just one more step and [saying] that religion is wholly human'?." Again - and this is critically important - Hick's typical response to this challenge, that religious experience provides the basis for such realist hopes, has been shown to be effectively undermined by the implications of his own neo-Kantian proposal.56 Department of Theology, Marquette University, Milwaukee, WI 53233 "IR, p.
