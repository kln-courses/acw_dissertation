<plain_text><page sequence="1">Evolution and Religion Monroe W. Strickberger Evolution and religion represent im- portant areas of thought in modem life. They reflect many basic differences in how people look at man today and lead, therefore, to differences in attitudes and actions. One example of these actions has to do with whether evolution should even be taught in schools on a level with any other part of science, and con- siderable controversy is taking place in California and some other states on this issue. Although many ramifications of this controversy exist, this paper is devoted to the primary differences between evolutionary views and reli- gious views about man's origin and some of the reasons for these differences. Let us begin by defining the terms evolution and religion. In general, "evolution" signifies an understanding of the biological changes that have taken place in the history of life: That many different kinds of organisms existed on earth and gradual- ly changed biologically over long periods of time, and that those or- ganisms that exist today, including man, are the modified descendants of or- ganisms that existed in the past. Evolu- tion also includes an understanding of the impact these biological changes and heritages have had on the way we live, and, also to some degree, an understand- ing of how our biological future can be or will be affected by our biological limitations and potentialities. All of these aspects are combined into the one term "evolution" with the proviso that the basic understanding of these matters has been gained through the scientific and observational methods used by biologists and other scientists who are engaged in these studies. "Religion," on the other hand, defines an approach toward natural events, such as evolution, as events which cannot be explained, either wholly or in part, by reliance on the scientific and observational methods used in science. Religion is based on a belief that at some point (and this point can shift depending on how religious one is) events and experiences are caused by one or more mysterious and unknowable forces, spirits, absolute beings, universal minds, gods or divini- ties - the exact term used often depending upon the particular religion. For a long time, the relationship between these two concepts in Western culture, evolution and religion, were acrimonious battles which often started out as debates on the evidences for biological evolution. In my opinion, however, the acrimony engendered has had little to do with the now over- whelming evidence for evolution. More valuable than a futile discussion of evidence would be to gain some idea of the sources of struggle between evolu- tion and religion, and to pinpoint a few essential issues. Historically, the opening shot began with the famous debate between Wilber- force and Huxley, in which Wilberforce accused Darwin of "a tendency to limit God's glory in creation." In succeeding battles which lasted well into the 20th century, theologians primarily ham- mered away at the heresy of evolution. Cardinal Manning, a leader of English Catholicism, called Darwinism "a brutal philosophy - to wit, there is no God, and the ape is our Adam." Darwinists were accused of attempts "to do away with all idea of a God," "to produce in their readers a disbelief of the Bible," and "to displace God by the unerring action of vagary" (For these and other statements, see White 1896). If these claims are true, one could well ask how such a heretical doctrine could have developed in the bosom of a religious European country, and been accepted by so many of Darwin's learned compatriots? Among the answers to this, is one which helps to see the struggle between evolution and religion as more than just accidental, but as part of the framework of the time. From a social point of view, it is important to realize that Darwinian Evolution and the revolution that it engendered was one aspect of that all-pervasive political and economic revolution in social behavior and thought which began with the over- throw of the rigidly ordered feudal class structures that had prevailed in Europe until the rise of capitalism. The economic challenges posed by capital- ism and its new monied classes (and we have to remember that this was not merely an intellectual challenge but often a bitter, fierce and bloody strug- gle) helped in many ways to allow ideological challenges to be posed to the prevailing religious and philosophical systems which had been the support of the old social order. The divine right of Kings, for example, had to be over- thrown socially, philosophically, and religiously. Without such changes, there is little question in the minds of many historians that European science could not have flourished as it eventually did. However, not too surprisingly, capitalism in its triumph also sought ideological justifications for its power. As in feudalism, many of these justifica- tions were based on religious concepts, and it was fairly common to find appeals to the inherent hierarchy of nature and the wisdom of the creator. In the words of Alexander Pope: Order is Heaven's first law, and this confest Some are, and must be, greater than the rest, More rich, more wise. 1734: Essay on Man, Epistle IV.

Nevertheless, it is interesting to note that there was no sustained political attempt to suppress evolutionary ideas although they were attacked far and wide, and were even occasionally outlawed in some of the more educationally backward American states. One probable reason for the relative freedom which evolution en- joyed lies in its close ties with all other aspects of science. Science and tech- nology were, after all, the mainstay of economic expansion. Many scientists were or became evolutionists, and it must have seemed to most social leaders that evolution was a scientific foible which would have to be tolerated. However, to many religionists, as we have seen, evolution was a serious threat. There was considerable cause for this concern and in order to understand this, it is essential to review the develop- ment of those aspects of religion which were most directly threatened by evolu- tion. Important clues to the development of religion have been provided by an- thropologists and psychologists in their analysis of various present-day cultures. In general, religion develops in a culture as an expression of attempts to deal with those aspects of experience which cannot be controlled or understood. Religions have apparently been sus- tained from their origins by the com- mon feeling that what is outside one's control may nevertheless, be humanlike, and, therefore, subject to appeal and indirectly to control. In the earliest stages of religion, the forces of nature are directly endowed with the spirits of animals and humans. In the attempt to control these forces by sympathetic magic, particular events are enacted by imitation so that they will be guided towards desired ends, e.g., hunting dances, rain dances, etc. The develop- ment of ritual occurs when magical ceremonies are repeated to help ensure their efficiency. Ritualized behavior seemed to have become especially im- portant in the transition from hunting to agricultural societies in which crops had to be planted and harvested at appropriate seasons each year, and yet where one's efforts could be either rewarded or negated by forces which remain mysterious and arbitrary. In his advice to farmers, Hesiod (800 B.C.) wrote: Everyone praises a different day, but few know their nature. Sometimes a day is a stepmother, sometimes a mother. That man is happy and lucky in them who knows all of these things, and does his work without offending the deathless gods, who discerns the omens of the birds, and avoids trans- gression. (Works and Days, Loeb Classical Libra- ry, p. 65) Modern man can ill afford to laugh at this. The uncertainty, hope, and wooing of Lady Luck expressed by Hesiod, are after all, basic feelings shared by many. They are just somewhat more baldly stated here than more sophisticated forms in which we usually acknowledge them. Underlying many human anxieties about the world, and often at the base of the difficulty in treating nature as an independent object of study, was the feeling that it reflected, through punish- ment and reward, that is, through calamity and prosperity, a supernatural evaluation of human affairs. Since the forces of nature were believed to be humanlike, religion sustained and en- couraged the hope that nature's recrimi- nation and punishment could be propitiated by humanlike appeals: sub- mission, supplication, gifts, sacrifice, obedience, and loyalty. In support of a supernatural view of events, religion has relied on two basic concepts that probably arose early in man's history, the "soul" and "God." The soul or the spirit is a humanlike conscious entity without physical at- tachments or properties. According to various psychologists and anthropolo- gists, it seems likely that the idea of the separation of the soul from the body has its origin in the separation of the mind from reality in dreams. The restrictions of space, time, and even death vanish in dreams, and it is only one step to suppose that there is an aspect of human life, the soul, which is immune to such restrictions. Such at- titudes are reinforced by the fact that it is very difficult to conceive that one's personality has only a limited existence. That is, that the organ of feelings which a person uses to sense his relationship to his environment and through which he relates and evaluates the world about him, has a beginning and an end. Al- though one can intellectually conceive of death, either related to other creatures or phenomena or even related to one's own body, it is impossible to "feel" death as one may feel and an- ticipate other events and sensations. To a human, and perhaps to other creatures as well, this organ of feelings, per- sonality, seems to be eternally present since there is usually no self-knowledge of how it arrived or of how it ends. Theologians have often attempted to provide a "scientific" argument for the non-material nature of the soul or the personality, claiming that intellectual processes cannot have a material origin. However, the biological view is quite different: While it is true that we do not yet know the precise relationship between the matter of the brain (neurones, synapses, etc.) and the thoughts and feelings it produces, the fact that such a relationship can exist is no mystery. There is every reason to believe that the complexity of thinking and feeling has evolved like any other trait. Like the concept of the soul, the concept of God has many qualities which reflect human experience. The various gods personify, often in human form, forces or tasks which seem beyond the capabilities of humans, in the fashion of a powerful parent seen through the eyes of a child. How better for primitive people to alleviate anxiety and fears about harvests, thunder, fertility, woods, rivers, etc. than to believe that these elements of nature embody such extensions of human be- havior. From individual gods for each element of nature it is only one further step to have gods which can be ranked in respect to their power, and then only a further step to have a God of gods, such as Jove, Jehovah, Brahma, Krishna, and others. At the heart of religion is the feeling of reliance and dependence on what is held to be, and what is certainly desired to be, a wise and paternalistic nature. Different religions endow these feelings with structures derived from the societies in which they are found, often with considerable imagination. It is, for example, doubtful if reality could produce pleasures or torments greater than those provided by the imaginations of believers in heaven and hell. It is easy to see that as long as active intervention by a divine power was believed necessary to explain most or all observed events and to allow the con- tinued maintenance of the universe, it inhibited the attempt to discover natural laws which would account for changes in either the present, past, or future. The first significant chinks in the theological armor of continued divine 418 BioScience Vol. 23 No. 7</page><page sequence="3">intervention into nature were breached by Copernicus and Kepler, and then extended by Newton through his ex- planations of the motion of the solar system through the force of gravity. As more became known about natural processes, such as mechanics, optics, chemistry, etc., God was reduced from a continually intervening active agent to a prime force more like a master crafts- man who has designed logically- contrived self-functioning machines.1 Although this helped to modify man's attitude towards the divine establish- ment from simple fear and subjection to the more comfortable attitudes of ad- miration and respect, it also led to a closer examination of the nature of God, with many ensuing contradictions. Questions on the purpose of creation and the imperfection of the world led to some of the most pernicious of all paradoxes, such as, if the world was not created perfect, what moral good could there have been in its creation? However, challenging as these ques- tions were to religion, they were not as damaging as the frontal attack made by Darwin and his evolutionists. Darwin's works made clear that it was no longer necessary to believe that biological rela- tionships must be explained by the actions of a supernatural creator. Instead, he presented the notions that there is in nature continual change, unpredictable chance events, an un- relenting struggle for survival among living creatures, and no obvious guidance. He thus replaced what had seemed to many to be an under- standable view of nature, that is the creativity of a humanlike god, by the most heretical concept of all, random- ness and uncertainty, or the fear that now nothing can really be understood. An example of how essential it was to believe that each design had a creative purpose is reflected in the statement of Paley: There cannot be design without a designer: contrivance without a con- triver; order without choice; arrange- ment without anything capable of arranging... Arrangement, disposition of parts, subserviericy of means to an end, relation of instruments to a use, imply the presence of intelligence and mind.2 In terms of the origin of man, this means simply that man, or his soul or personality, could not have been derived from his animal kin without the active intervention at some point, early or late, of an intelligent sympathetic deity. Thus, neither was man born in vain nor did he die in vain; but, rather, the designer who gave him life was also responsible for his death, and for the immortal preservation of his soul. You can see that this argument of design is also supported by what seems to be simple common sense. Can there be a watch.without a watchmaker, and by extension, can there be a man without a manmaker, laws without a lawmaker? To Darwin's theory, the es- sential challenge posed by religion has always been: How from the disorder of random variability can nature achieve the beauty of adaptation without intel- ligent intervention? Darwin's contribu- tion was to show that the mechanism through which adaptation occurs is natural selection. The evolutionary view of selection is as follows. Evolution occurs by chance events, but it is a historical process. That is, what evolves depends upon what has evolved before. Thus, no complex struc- ture arises all at one time by a lucky combination of events, but evolution builds and perfects new structures from old ones. For example, if you had a bowlful of letters in the proportions 3-T: 4-0: 2-B: 2-E: 1-N: 1-R, there are millions of ways that 13 letters ran- domly drawn out from this bowl can be arranged. The chances of getting exactly the words TO BE OR NOT TO BE from a random arrangement of these letters is obviously very small. If we assume, however, that a selec- tion mechanism exists which will per- petuate certain "adaptive" combina- tions, then the "evolutionary" attain- ment of TO BE OR NOT TO BE is far greater than on first appearance. Thus, let us assume that T is the only letter which can survive by itself. The chance of drawing a T from the 13 letters is therefore 3/13. Let us assume next that only an O in combination with the T is adaptive; then the chance of now draw- ing O is 4/13. Similarly, if we assume that the next adaptive combination con- sists of adding a B to TO, and that further successive combinations are selected because of their adaptive value, the entire complex phrase TO BE OR NOT TO BE can eventually be selected with relatively high probability without the intervention of any agent other than the strictly opportunistic one of what is "adaptive." Evolution can "create" complex or- gans like the eye and the brain through the action of natural selection choosing for preservation successively improved adaptations. The variability upon which the choice is exercised is random (the "letters" or "mutations" are of dif- ferent kinds, both adaptive and non- adaptive), but the structure which is built over many generations of selection has been historically molded and created, and is not at all random. Thus, in the words of R.A. Fisher, "natural selection is a mechanism for generating an exceedingly high degree of im- probability" (quoted in Huxley 1942). Or to use a metaphor of Monod (1971), "mutation provides the noise from which selection draws out the music." To repeat this in a somewhat dif- ferent way: The biological changes produced by selection can occur whether man is the selective agent (arti- ficial selection) or whether nature is the selective agent (natural selection). Arti- ficial selection, for example, has given us the Chihuahua, the Saint Bernard, the Bulldog, etc., all created by man over a relatively short period of time from the variability present in dogs. Natural selection, on the other hand, acting over much longer periods of time, has given us all the various species we see, all created from the variability that was present in the forms from which they were selected. These forms, in turn, were selected from previous forms going back to those first primeval forms of billions of years ago which could transmit their characteristics to their progeny. To the Darwinians, everything was accidental in the sense that every- thing arose at first randomly, and yet everything that survived was adaptive, in the sense that only adaptive combina- tions of these random variables could perpetuate themselves. The fear that Darwinism was an attempt to displace God in the sphere of creation was therefore quite justified. To the question is there a special pur- pose for the creation of man, Evolution answered NO. To the question is there a special purpose for the creation of any living species, Evolution answered NO. SIn the words of Bernal, "God had, in fact, like his anointed ones on earth, become a constitutional monarch." 2Natural Theology: Or Evidences of the Existence and Attributes of the Deity, Col- lected from the Appearances of Nature, 1802. July 1973 419</page><page sequence="4">The adaptations of species and the adaptations of man come from natural selection and not from design. (Except, of course, for those types of organisms for which man himself has now become the designer.) Surprisingly, these seemingly irrecon- cilably different points of view on the same basic subject, the origin of species and the origin of man, were not fol- lowed either by the defeat of religion or of evolution. Evolution suffered almost no loss at all. In fact, evolution became the main unifying force in biology and led to an expansion of research in almost every area. One might think, through the closely reasoned argument of natural selection, that evolution had successfully cut the ground out from under religion's prime justification for itself, the special creation of man. The demise of religion should have been imminent. It turned out that this was not so, and some of the reasons for this are worth exploring. First of all, the change from regard- ing nature as operating in terms of a kind of anthropomorphic "wisdom" to operating in terms of what the evolu- tionists viewed as a kind of "oppor- tunism" expressed by the survival of the fittest, was certainly most difficult for people raised in the bosom of paternal- istic social structures and religious beliefs. For many centuries it was, after all, easy for many to follow a pattern of simple parallels between society and nature: the King rules, the Pope rules, God rules. Each ruled hopefully with wisdom, concern, and sympathy, but in all cases man was dependent on their beneficences, and aspired to influence their judgments by special pleas, sacrifices, and rituals. Even for those who questioned the legitimacy of kingly rule over humans, it must have seemed far too audacious a leap to question the rule of nature by the wisdom of God. Even the philosopher Kant, who had an evolutionary approach to cosmology and to the origin of the solar system, found it abhorrent to admit that species could evolve, and described such notions as "ideas so monstrous that the reason shrinks before them" (see Love- joy 1959, p. 190). Darwin too is reported to have felt quite uncom- fortable about his role in proposing the evolution of species and wrote in a letter, "it is like confessing a murder." (Letter to Hooker, 11 January 1844. See de Beer 1963, p. 135.) We must remember that one source for this guilt was the staid conservative milieu which held on strongly to the notion that man was created in the image of God and endowed with the rule over other biological and social groups below him. Kinship to those below, whether ape or servant, was a repugnant idea. Reinforcing these attitudes was the reaction of many of the European mid- dle classes to the upheavals of the French Revolution and to the atheism of many of its leaders. These reactions probably helped to strengthen the reli- gious climate among the middle classes in the 19th century and led, in various groups, at least for a time to a more literal interpretation of the Bible. Essential to the preservaton of reli- gion in the midst of the evolutionary bombardment was also the fact, as pointed out previously, that religion answers needs derived from man's help- lessness and alienation. We can sum- marize these as: the need to feel that one's life has a purpose; the need to feel that there is a powerful force ("some- one up there") which is hopefully protective and upon which one can depend, but which, in any case, can be appealed to; and the need, in some way, to fill the important personal mysteries of birth and death (the question of identity, "who am I?" and "why me?"). Furthermore, religion has traditionally served as the main repository for the ethics and morals of society, what is right and wrong, and also often to help maintain feelings of confidence in the social order. Evolution, on the other hand, relates to many basic questions of life that are of concern to religion, but as a science it does not attempt to meet the emotional needs to which religion responds. Nevertheless, it is important to realize that as fear is diminished in any particular area, the emotional needs that spring from this fear are usually also diminished. Society has, therefore, held on to both of these concepts to this day with a sort of armed truce between them. Religion, with the exception of some fundamentalists, essentially withdrew from the domain of biological evolu- tion, and left both the origin of species and the origin of man in the hands of the evolutionists. The Bible was rein- terpreted to permit evolution by either ignoring the creation story in Genesis or by considering it as allegorical. There was considerable sacrifice in such rein- terpretations since, like any other reli- gious document, the Bible is an attempt to explain the unknown in a religious framework. To concede that parts of the Bible can be known and understood outside the religious framework easily opens the door to further loss of reli- gious credibility. Other compromises were made or attempted such as that by Asa Gray, the American evolutionist, who proposed that the variability upon which natural selection acts during evolution was itself specially created. To this Darwin replied that since not all variations are useful, it is inconceivable that evolution could be "designed" by such means. However, although religion compromised or retreated in various places, it kept for itself the domain of ethical and moral concepts, and has often maintained that man's behavior, attitudes, and relationships can be con- sidered apart from how man's biology came into being. Tenuous at best, the truce between evolution and religion is now falling apart at a rapid rate. The intellectual onslaught which evolution unleashed at the time of Darwin has turned into numerous other areas, some of which cannot easily go unchallenged. For example, once the notion of fixity and perfection was removed from as sacred a concept as species and their creation, it has only been one further step to question and investigate the fixity and perfection of religion itself. Usually the awe and mystery that surrounds an institution vanishes in direct proportion to "earthly" knowledge of its origin and development. Religion is no exception to this, and a considerable amount of its power, which depends upon awe and mystery, has been seriously undermined by the evolutionary approach expressed through various sciences. To evolution, nothing is necessarily permanent, even society and morality; and this question- ing evolutionary climate is fed by the very active social changes that have accelerated rapidly and radically in this century. Thus, the conflict between what seems to be continual change on one side, and stability and tradition on the other may also serve as a cause for some people to take a position either on the side of evolution or of religion. In fact, these two contrasts in their extreme forms may be the Scylla and Charybdis of modern life. On one side are those people who fall easily into the 420 BioScience Vol. 23 No. 7</page><page sequence="5">trap that all change is progress and lose sight of the fact that a changing world without human values and meaning can be as destructive as a world whose meaning and values have been frozen in time. Many such people who believe in change for its own sake can hardly wait for the brave new world of larger and faster motor cars, bigger supersonic transports, faster transformation of man into a mindless consumer, Homo con- sumens, - and all the other dehumani- zations that purposeless expansionism and its Madison Avenue promoters can perpetrate. On another side is the trap that dates back to Jean Jacques Rousseau: That change through science cannot be im- bued with any moral purpose or value; the trap that scientific rationality is a weapon used against man by those who would control or destroy him. This simplified view is often shared by those who are smart enough to see that science doesn't know everything, but are not able to see that astrology or tea leaves or chicken entrails do not help to understand the present or to predict the future. Hopefully, man will not choose either of these extremes, although the options may be limited. It seems clear that the world is presently firmly com- mitted to continual change in almost every field. Unless all change can be held back, those who hold on to religion only because of a strict traditional bias will continually be forced to give ground. Furthermore, there are very difficult problems which demand deep insights into all aspects of morality and ethics, that is, both hindsight and foresight into the good of mankind, but which religion is not well equipped to handle, and these are questions which are or will be on the order of the day: abortion, population control, the transplantation of organs between humans, euthanasia, the transplantation of fertilized eggs between mothers, artificial insemina- tion, the cloning of human foetuses, the control of aging, genetic control of the human gene pool, etc. These problems dig deeply into the very roots of human values - the question of personal identi- ty, the sanctity of human life, and the goals of society. When is man alive? When is a man dead? When is a man born? In which direction shall man evolve? How long shall we prolong life in the face of suffering? Shall we prevent the conception and gestation of children who are doomed to early and painful deaths? It would seem impossible to deal adequately with these questions without a thorough understanding of biology based, in turn, on an understanding of evolution. There is no question in my mind that man has the potentiality to develop so that he can deal successfully with these questions. However, from their past history it is doubtful that religious institutions, as we now see them, can lead him. This is because the rigidities of religion have always far outweighed its flexibilities. Religion, in fact, developed considerable im- moralities of its own, which would seriously plague it in attempting to cope with some of the new needs of society. For example, there is the immorality of religious alienation between people, where religion is used as an instrument of animosity between humans, and often encourages hostility on its own. Underlying this, of course, is the im- morality of arrogance, that there is a revealed truth which each religion usual- ly claims as its unique possession. (One could charge, of course, that science too is rigid and immoral since it claims the superiority of scientific principles. But any theory in science can always be challenged or replaced by one with superior evidence: How many "heretics" to science have been burned, destroyed or exiled as a means of answering their challenge?) There is also the religious immorality of conceiving man as a goal of creation; of letting him believe that he is magically divorced from his biology and thereby unac- countable for his pollutions and en- vironmental destructions. There is also the immorality of population expansion which many religions support either ex- plicitly or implicitly, arguing ironically that population expansion is a mystical "natural law." There is often the im- morality of religious institutions sup- porting, and also functioning as instru- ments of, authoritarian structures which are used to exploit others. There is often too the immorality of considering the human body as though it were tainted and impure, of attempting to rigidly restrict human feelings, and of helping to instill the idea that human sexual behavior is shameful. Can institu- tions with histories of such attitudes deal effectively with problems which demand a recognition of the plurality of different kinds of man, a recognition of the physical and behavioral realities of man, and a recognition of the evolu- tionary history of man? In spite of these criticisms, there are still many religious "men of good will" who look at their fellow humans as more than just religious instruments, and who share concern, sympathy and interest in all of mankind. Although it is impossible to estimate their number or power in religious institutions, they are unquestionably there and derive from the noblest moral traditions of humanism. Perhaps the future will see an amalgam between such men and scientific humanists. In any case, it is clear that to deal effectively with present and future problems of man demands freedom from prejudice, freedom from exploita- tion, and freedom from mutual acts of destruction. Evolution can make im- portant contributions towards helping to solve the problems of man and is no longer just an intellectual exercise. Evolution is part of the world view that every thinking human needs in order to help his species survive in a human way. Man must learn to set his own directions and goals. REFERENCES Bernal, J.
