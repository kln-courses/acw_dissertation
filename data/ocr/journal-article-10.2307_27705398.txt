<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Broken Center: Studies in the Theological Horizon of Modern Literature. By Nathan A. Scott, Jr. New Haven and London: Yale University Press, 1966. Pp. xv+237. $5. The genre of criticism to which this book belongs is both recent (that is, since the end of World War II) and richly, densely growing. It is truly an interdis ciplinary criticism, incorporating philosophical, theological, and other knowl edges. The real beginnings were in the existentialist speculations and literature that began during and just after the WTar. But this phase of it has grown in two directions: that of analysis (linking formalist with other kinds of criticism) and that of assertion. As for the latter, the implications are usually that literature may be invoked as a helpmeet, or even a savior, of modern man. There is, per haps, a third variant, the criticism that tries to understand modern life through its literature. I do not claim any one of these slots for Professor Scott. He has already had an illustrious career, as the author or editor of twelve books. He is also a prominent student of theology. In short, he is at home in two essential kinds of knowledge, those of theology and of literature. There is a branch of speculation that is almost entirely theological, aided and abetted by the brilliant pioneer work of Paul Tillich, Reinhold Niebuhr, Rudolph Bultmann, among others. Then there are the critics and scholars who have taken hold of the special literary cast of modern dilemmas and disasters. These treat not so much of heroism as of the antiheroic; they are caught up in the struggles caused by the</page><page sequence="2">Book Reviews 483 deflationary circumstances in modern religion, a condition that afflicts many honest and anxious clerics as well. In my essay, "The Religious Crisis in Mod ern Literature" (in Comparative Literature Studies, 1966), I listed the follow ing titles of recent publications as relevant to this latter group: Maurice Fried man's Problematic Rebel (1963), Gabriel Vahanian's The Death of God (1961) and Wait without Idols (1964), John Killinger's The Failure of Theology in Modern Literature (1963), and J. Hillis Miller's The Disappearance of God (1963) and Poets of Reality (1965). I shall want to add my own The Mortal No: Death and the Modern Imagination (1964) and The Imagination's New Begin ning (1967). There is, of course, much variation of treatment in this group, but I should want to say that the studies have a number of things in common. They begin with the assumption of a "secular deprivation." Many of them set tle for an analysis of what it is necessary to do to live in a secular world with any degree of serenity; others, like the works of Nathan Scott, analyze the malaise as a longing for eternity and transcendence, which has become all the more poignant because neither is now easy of achievement. The Broken Center adapts and modifies two of the basic tenets of this world: first, the death, withdrawal, disappearance, inaccessibility of God, call it what you will, which usually is alleged to have been dramatized by Nietz sche's statements in The Gay Science of 1882 concerning the death of God. Many debates start off this way; it is almost as commonplace to do so as it once was to cite Pavlov's dog in another context. The other tenet has to do with the potency of the literary art, both in describing modern ills and in find ing surcease of them. It is interesting that Scott's confidence in literature takes a direction similar to the pragmatic analyses of certain Cambridge University critics, who have been matched on this side of the Atlantic by R. W. B. Lewis and Lawrence S. Dembo (see the latter's Conceptions of Reality in Modern American Poetry, 1966): Scott is primarily interested in what literature does by way of fastening upon the particulars of this world, so that they become a surrogate reality to that of theological transcendence. The book is more varied than I may so far have claimed it to be. The beginning is, of course, existentialist, as are most studies of this kind. Scott's quoting from Tillich in the first chapter sets the tone (see p. 19). Interestingly, the point of departure?that is, the point from which one must break away? may be called a "charismatic agony," an appeal to the abyss, a sense of aliena tion. This is of course a major nineteenth- and twentieth-century crisis; it was very well described by Erich Heller in his study of German romanticism, The Artist's Journey into the Interior (1965). Scott describes it this way: "All of the great charismatic seers of modern literature from Baudelaire to Kafka and from Pirandello to Faulkner, in one way or another, have wanted us to under stand that we are lost in a dark wood and that, in this maze, what is least trustworthy is the common, the immediate, the familiar" (p. 2). As we shall see, Scott wishes particularly to resolve this difficulty, and above all to point out that literature offers us the particulars of our obeisance and of our adjustment to the world. In a long chapter on Time in Modern Literature (pp. 25-76), he depends upon the most commonplace of definitions: literature, he says, "is an art of time because . . . it is built out of language which is itself composed of sequences of words following one another in time"</page><page sequence="3">484 Hof man (P- 33)- The great problem of twentieth-century culture is that of our immer sion in time; time is "eternally present" (p. 38). Vico and Bergson have been our tutors in these matters. But our obsession with time, according to Scott, has a strange resolve and reason : Whether through the eternal return, in myth or through the simultaneity of montage and spatial form, the intent is to perform an act of assassination, to abolish the struc tures of concrete historical time with such effectiveness that the impurity of their finitude may be utterly escaped and access may be won to a timeless Eternity, to a Great Time, which is beyond anything resembling empirical temporality. This is a besetting obsession, the consequences of which are that we look upon historical time as "The Great Enemy" and envisage a point of metaphysical resolve when time and eternity can converge without paradoxical results (p. 56). As one modern theologian has put it, eternity is not the negation of tem porality, but must be its fulfilment (p. 58). And Scott of course is working to ward the point where (as literature will show us) we can dispel this wistful re gard of eternity and can adjust to "a really tough and authentic historical maturity" (p. 66). There is enough already to suggest that, as Father William Lynch has put it (in Christ and Apollo, i960), the modern longing for an atemporal, tran scendent world "represents a disease of the feelings and a collapse of the true metaphysical mind" (p. 75). From this time forward we are aware both of Scott's attitude and of what modern literature might do by way of substanti ating it. The bias of comedy, he says in Chapter Three, is human and humane; the comic man, like Chaplin, must be "a kind of icon of the human actuality" (p. 91). He helps us become and remain aware of our contingency, "to remind us of how deeply rooted we are in all the tangible things of this world" (p. 103). In these terms the Incarnation becomes a very different symbolic event in religion; it is a sign that God wishes us to know Him through the things of this world. In Chapter Four, Scott points to the many books ("an unremitting flow") on modern tragedy. This chapter is strangely lacking in specific ex amples, though Eliot and Kafka and some modern novelists are mentioned. It is in Chapter Five that the full meaning of the previous chapter is re vealed. Here Scott discusses the full impact of modern secularization, includ ing the theologians who have spoken most earnestly about the death of God. The new theologians, he says, are eager to purify "the Christian faith of what John Wild calls 'those anthropomorphic dilutions of Transcendence' that are so much a part of the received tradition" (p. 173). Contrasted to them is poetry "as a means of grace." Scott uses Wordsworth as his chief example; there is only one mention of Wallace Stevens, and that suggests that he really does not know Stevens as a modern poet. This is one of the few really disap pointing chapters?disappointing not in what it asserts, but in the lack of sup porting evidence. He seems much more interested in the contemporary novel, and in his last chapter addresses himself to such recent American novelists as Ralph Ellison, Bernard Malamud, Frederick Buechner, and Saul Bellow. Some ten or twelve other novels are also named, but generally the last pages of his book are disappointingly thin. His discussion of the psychological and ontological peculiarities of modern religion and literature is surely one of the</page><page sequence="4">Book Reviews 485 most satisfactory of the last few years. But he is sometimes weak in the mat ters of analysis, which should come easily enough to him. One of the difficulties of this book is that, for all its assertiveness about literature, one sees very little of it in evidence. Nevertheless, as a transitional book?say, midway between such a pragmatic theologian as Paul Tillich and such an earnest scholar-critic as Hillis Miller?The Broken Center is an important and a welcome event.
