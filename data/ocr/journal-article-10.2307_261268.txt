For he 's our no mean aegis-shield of confidence, i.e. (Aegisthus, say I,), "for he is," etc. 1. The interchange of our and ty in the capital forms VP and % r would have been easy. 2. No hostility was called forth, as is the case in modern literature, whether by the formal pun or by paronomasia. This may be noted all the way from Od. ix. 366, 406, 408, 410, 414, in OVTLV-OVTV', and /U.LTSv- /,q)vTL or, as Professor Manatt reminds me, in Od. xix. 407, 409, O8vo-ova- ,ucvov-'O0vo-cIS, or in Aesch. Prom. 85-86, llpouq9e'a-vpo,up 0tvez, down to Xp,ToVro-XptrOV in the Christian Fathers (e.g., Just. Mart. A, 4, 4; cf. Gildersleeve ad loc.). Aeschylus seems to have been especially hospitable to the play upon words between a proper name and some other word, as may be shown</page><page sequence="2">502 NOTES AND DiscusSIONS by two parallels to Alyur9os -aiyt'v within the limits of this same play, i.e., Ag. 688-89, 'EXE'vav-sXA'vav, sXavSpos, 'XAIrroXLv, and 1080-82, 'A7roXXov -ro'XXwv- dr4Aavus. Incidentally, this propensity of Aeschylus might even reinforce the MS reading (as against the Scholiast and the con- fusion in Plutarch) of Jpt-ros, rather than L'Katos, with its reference to 'ApUtrcto'qV in Aesch. Sept. 592. Another paronomasia between AltywOos and aZ% (1435) would be con- ceivable but far-fetched, and the yap in 1437, if the full stop is retained at the end of the line, seems to require something that emphasizes and explains the choice of the comparison. Even if alort's is retained the atyt'v is almost inevitably suggested, whether we think of it as a conven- tional shield or the Homeric flexible covering for arm or head or back or chest. Its Homeric function as a weapon of offense would not be ignored in the limiting word Opaiuovs. Dr. Verrall, feeling that yap is without due motive as the line is ordi- narily punctuated, removes the full stop after Opaiuovs and makes OVTOS yap look forward to KZTaL . X. . a. X vrPX ptPo,. This, at least, recognizes the difficulty in the usual reading although it cures it in a different way from the one here proposed. 3. That the aegis was at least not foreign to the poet's range of thought, as one of the scraps from the Homeric banquet-table, may be inferred from the fact that he makes reference to it in both of the other parts of this trilogy, i.e., Choeph. 593 and Eum. 404. 4. The possible objection that the comparison, drawn from the sphere of divinity, would not be applied to mortals does not seem cogent in view of the thoroughgoing anthropomorphism with which human attributes and appurtenances are given to gods -from flo7nrtn or xpvo- 6povov Hera down to weapons of offense or defense, like this goat-skin arm- or chest-protector. In II. xviii. 204 Athena herself lends the aegis to a mortal, Achilles. Why should not Clytemnestra hold before herself Aegisthus as an aegis and a terror to the men of Argos? II. In Agamemnon 1163 the MS reading has given rise to suspicion and emendation, as av is desired. veo,ypbs dvOpcb4rcop dOot. Sidgwick (foll. Karsten) edits: 'e6yopos c' &amp; c aczo uAdOot. If we read: veoyvos av copovwv ,uaOot, the change between ANEPQIION and AN(PPONON would be much slighter. An iambus would correspond to a tribrach in the antistrophe: Kat' TL' aC KaKO4pOvWv TL077-. That 4povzv would thus occur in the same position in strophe and antistrophe is cer- tainly no objection (though it must also be noted that the participle in the antistrophe is itself an emendation for the MS KaKO40pOVcZv). A diffi- culty may seem to arise with the translation: "A newborn child of any</page><page sequence="3">NOTES AND DISCUSSIONS 503 wit might understand." This may seem to throw the emphasis where it is not needed. Or it may be objected that 46povi'v with vEoyvo's is a con- tradiction in terms; cf. Choeph. 753 where an infant is defined as T0 , cpovoivv; but the oxymoron is no more adventurous than the revealing of wisdom "to babes and sucklings." III. Agamemnon 1172: thb U OepAp6vs TdX' irdAy #aXwct Sidgwick approves (but does not admit into his text) Miller's ingenious conjecture: ycb 5U Oep,A'u o o-rdy' z 7r9q W,8aXrZ; May not 4d lurk in 1,u7rE4 ? If so, read: J-ycb 5 Oepph6vovs TrdX' 4A 7i85o I3acXw'. 7roA v,uv in the previous line is contrasted with Eyz 8? . . . . "The city has fallen, soon I too shall fall." In lines 1139, 1149, 1161, and here Cassandra returns, after each comparison, to the frank, physical dread of her own violent death and, after her subsequent long speech, she prays, at 1293-94, that she may die "unconvulsed," by one swift stroke. The unusual word 0Epu.'vovs, in which lies the chief difficulty, may look forward to this. For the loc. 7re8OL (or dat. rc&amp;) cf. Eur. I.A. 39, pL7TTELs TE 7Tre&amp; (WE8oL) 7rEtKfv and the use of 7rT TTO (= pass. of f3aXw) Aesch. Choeph. 48, TrEOovTos aL/AaTOS 7'So8L and Eum. 479 7TreoL 7recr-v, etc. The pregnant use of 'v with dative is not reinforced by such Homeric parallels (incompletely cited by L. and S.; vide sub art. "Ev") as also contain the loc. xa,1o e.g. II. 4. 482, EV KOVLYtL xa,i.O 7rTEOv with II. 5. 583, and 11. 5. 588, xa,IaL f3caov KOVL'8L; although other examples, when the loc. is not added, support Miller's emendation as well as Aesch. Fragm. 183: fuL78 aL,/Aaros 7rTeut/ya 7rpos 7rS&amp; The singular rT4= "a drop" is unknown, and the position of the interrogative ov' hardly seems felicitous. Finally, rxXa seems to be essential. Cf. the corresponding line, 1161, in the strophe and 6v TraXEL in 1240. Cassandra reiterates to the chorus the nearness of her doom. For id- (puavrov cf. Kfthner-Gerth Griech. Gram. II, i, 559.
