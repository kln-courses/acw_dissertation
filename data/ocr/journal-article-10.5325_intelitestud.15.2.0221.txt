               <italic>There was nothing else out there that was going to make those kinds of links and connections. We used this term interdisciplinarity but we were not talking about that.

Interdisciplinarity: What is its status in modern academe? What is its potential for merging existing disciplines? What are its implications for society? The need to phrase these questions with an anthropomorphic possessive confirms the potent activity of interdisciplinarity, that interdisciplinary endeavors have become full-blown forces in their own right. Interdisciplinarity has come with its caveats: there are those against it, others who see it as the future of the university, and many more who lie on this spectrum and who see either potential or pitfall, paradox or confluence, limited analysis or comprehensive probing. Interdisciplinarity offers various connotations to different scholars, with its concomitant notions of multidisciplinarity, intradisciplinarity, transdisciplinarity, cross-disciplinarity and postdisciplinarity. Accompanying these layers of connotation is the complex nature of the interdisciplinary endeavor itself: how do we define interdisciplinarity? What are the methods underlying interdisciplinarity? What trends—both intellectual and social—necessarily accompany it? Is it even requisite considering the strength of disciplinary projects?</p>
      <p>In this article, I track the history of interdisciplinarity in the modern university; describe examples of disciplinary and interdisciplinary fields and demonstrate the process of interdisciplinarity; and argue for its validity, necessity, and underlying benefits on theoretical (and empirical) grounds. Interdisciplinarity is the future—for both the academy and society. Robert Frodeman's and Carl Mitcham's and Stanley Aronowitz's comments are telling in that <italic>interdisciplinary</italic> is a fluid and undefined term, with ample resistance to it and support for it, simultaneously.</p>
      <sec id="s01">
         <title>INTERDISCIPLINARITY'S TRAJECTORY</title>
         <p>I begin the topic of interdisciplinarity with a narrative. When I began graduate school, I was a prominent member of the Genetics Graduate Group at the University of California, Davis. I loved scientific research, but I also loved literature, affinities that began as a double major in comparative literature and biochemistry at Dartmouth. At UC Davis, I had decided that I wanted to pursue a career in interdisciplinary studies: to find connections between the disparate disciplines of science and literature. I entered UC San Diego as a graduate student in comparative literature and then began an enviable journey into the worlds of French theory, narrative analysis, literary criticism, and science studies. My postdoctoral fellowship, during which I conducted molecular biology research in a medical school laboratory, was also interdisciplinary. I have engaged in interdisciplinary endeavors through talks, panels, and grant proposals. However, I have found that my original presumptions concerning interdisciplinarity were naive, that there was much more to the interdisciplinary story than “making connections.” Interdisciplinarity, and the process of scholarship that accompanies it, offers critical perspectives and constitutes a questioning of disciplinary truth itself. It is a mode of organizing thought that allows for increasingly complex, yet accommodating, methods that traverse territory ranging from academia to society. Or in other words, as Frodeman and Mitcham (2007) state as well, interdisciplinarity must also pursue its own distinctly interdisciplinary depth, moving beyond the academy into dialogue with the public sector, the private sector, and community and stakeholders and religious groups.</p>
         <p>However, the concept of interdisciplinarity has its opponents. Valerie Peterson opens her article “Against Interdisciplinarity” on the problematics associated with the idea. Peterson writes:
<disp-quote>
               <p>I open with a statement of position: I am against interdisciplinarity. This means I am swimming against the current of popular endorsement…. There is considerable enthusiasm for the idea of interdisciplinarity without considerable reflection, for three interrelated reasons. First, the goals, processes and products of interdisciplinarity are ill-defined and contested, in part thanks to the history of the disciplines in the academy and in part due to the problems of interdisciplinary studies themselves. Second, those areas of scholarship that claim interdisciplinarity may be disadvantaged more than they benefit from this claim. Third, the current popularity and taken-for-granted “rightness” of interdisciplinarity undermines more radical projects to reorganize academic study. We can't realize more responsive and productive perspectives if we can't get past the popular appeal of interdisciplinarity. (1999, 42)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Indeed Frodeman and Mitcham in their seminal article on interdisciplinarity, “New Directions in Interdisciplinarity: Broad, Deep and Critical,” write about the disciplines: “This analytical, disciplinary approach has advanced our understanding of nature and contributed to the development of technological power. Disciplinary knowledge has improved human welfare, increased human abilities both to produce and consume, vastly lengthened our life spans, and created opportunities for exploring outer and inner space” (2007, 507).</p>
         <p>However, there are certain problems in Peterson's analysis, mainly that it may not hold up to socio-historical scrutiny. While interdisciplinary projects are popular, paradoxically they have lead to increased disciplinary specialization, as Frodeman and Mitcham point out: “The paradox of a century of interdisciplinarity effulgence is that no attempt at interdisciplinarity has produced a viable understanding of, or counterpoint to, specialization. Instead, each effort at interdisciplinarity has served as preamble to further disciplinary specialization and production” (510). They then write:
<disp-quote>
               <p>During the latter half of the 20th century, scientific interdisciplinarity was further intensified by efforts to address social problems such as poverty, war, hunger, overpopulation, and environmental degradation. Recognition that none of these human problems are amenable to strict disciplinary approaches also led the physical sciences to cross borders with the social sciences, and vice versa. Social systems thinking emerged from systems science and systems engineering as one proposal for a grand interdisciplinary synthesis to replace older ideological syntheses such as those of Marxism or Thomism. Other factors promoting scientific interdisciplinarity included the rise of the computer as the subject of a specialized interdisciplinary science of electronic logic machines and as a tool for all the sciences, the emergence of relational sciences such as ecology, and the thematizing of chaos and complexity as distinct interdisciplinary research programs.</p>
               <p>Following the physical sciences and engineering, the social sciences and the humanities soon pursued their own distinctive forms of interdisciplinarity. Area studies (American Studies, Latin American Studies, Asian Studies) prospered and were soon complemented by Black Studies, Women's Studies, Popular Culture Studies, and more. The humanities saw the wholesale borrowing of methodologies as hermeneutics, phenomenology, structuralism, poststructuralism, and deconstruction flowed across the liberal arts and to a lesser degree into the social sciences. But by and large, just as in the physical sciences, the result was more new disciplinary formations from what began as interdisciplinary exchanges. (510)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>However, as Frodeman and Mitcham point out, this process became increasingly particularized: “The various area studies programs became institutionalized in departments and degrees, which were complemented by their professional associations and scholarly journals. Whether as educational curricula or research programs, all efforts at interdisciplinarity have tended to evolve into narrow disciplines. Moreover, they have tended to originate from rather restricted border crossings” (510). They maintain that despite a plethora of interdisciplinary work, for instance, there have been remarkably few efforts to bring the sciences and the humanities together in a sustained manner. Instead, it has been much more common for one science to be crossed with another, or for one compartment of the humanities to open a window into another humanities compartment.</p>
         <p>They continue: “On the research side, biophysics has not really united biology and physics but created another and even more narrow discipline; the same goes for fields such as biochemistry and paleoclimatology. Interdisciplinary teams of scientists and engineers formed to create nuclear weapons or land humans on the moon have been spectacularly successful in meeting very specific mission goals but with little or no attention to the broader questions these successes raise. On the side of the humanities, the traditional belief in a perennial philosophy was abandoned; philosophers, historians, and literary critics became specialists who developed new knowledge” (510).</p>
         <p>In other words, interdisciplinary, while acknowledged, promoted, and pursued on many fronts, has not evidently radicalized disciplinary studies, programs, and the academy. Interdisciplinary areas have tended to become new disciplines in their own right. In the humanities, disciplinary projects were the result of originally interdisciplinary thematic studies into gender, race, ethnicity, and culture. The computer did not bear out its interdisciplinary potential, becoming its own distinct area of study. Each of these areas has led to further specialization rather than cross talk between the disciplines.</p>
         <p>The intellectual trajectory of interdisciplinarity is borne out by this analysis in many respects; however, there are exceptions. In fact, there are many attempts to merge the science and the humanities. Interdisciplinary projects need to be parsed in terms of the degree to which they have led to disciplinary specialization and also to the degree to which some have remained truly interdisciplinary on a programmatic basis. Further, these need to be distinguished from interdisciplinary projects that are piecemeal and fragmented in approach and that have not formed specific disciplines. I offer the examples of science studies as a program that originated in interdisciplinary enclaves and then coalesced to form a discipline; bioethics as an interdisciplinary endeavor in origin that programmatically retains its status as such; and the interdisciplinary connections between science and literature, which have not necessarily integrated into a specific field of study and remain dispersed among various disciplines. In turn, I demonstrate how there exists cross talk between the fields of bioethics and science studies to evince that the process of interdisciplinarity can inform the academy and create dialogue rather than become a precursor to specific disciplines.</p>
         <p>Consider the following scenarios:</p>
         <p>Scenario 1: A professor of English gives a talk to pediatric residents and medical students at a medical center on the importance of reading for medical case interpretation and for enhancing the integrity and moral life of physicians. The speaker gives numerous anecdotal instances and theoretical approaches to show how literature can singularly humanize the objective considerations of biomedicine. The response to the speaker is a series of questions by audience members on whether any “studies” exist to provide evidence for the speaker's arguments.</p>
         <p>Scenario 2: A postdoctoral fellow in a biomedical lab puts forth a National Institutes of Health grant proposal on critical theory and the Human Genome Project. Using well-cited (and oft-mentioned) European frameworks, the proposal seeks to flesh out issues of justice and equity with respect to genomics through the works of Habermas and Foucault. The grant proposal is met with the response that the writer should use more traditional approaches in analytical bioethics.</p>
         <p>Scenario 3: An interdisciplinary researcher is in the process of putting forward a pending National Science Foundation proposal on how ethics and the humanities can enter mainstream science (and scientific laboratory procedures). Through ethnographic studies, the researcher approaches laboratories at the University of California–Berkeley to conduct sociological studies of the lab and is met with enthusiasm that leads to the eventual participation of the laboratory and laboratory members in the project.</p>
         <p>All these scenarios are true and informed by the author. I believe they reveal the ambivalence and excitement toward interdisciplinary projects, particularly toward those that merge scientific endeavors (and their relation to ethics) with paradigms in the humanities. They show how the “two cultures” can be integrated, and demonstrate some resistance, both institutional and individual, to that integration. This may be interpreted as some perceiving change as good, while others not, but as usual, there is more to the interdisciplinary story than that adage. While the humanities and science differ profoundly in scholarly methods, content, and social effects, I argue that they operate in similar contexts within academia and society, both being housed institutionally in the university and existentially promoted for advancing social good in some realm or another. They are related less agonistically and more fluidly than would seem apparent, evoking symmetries between the elegance of poetry and the scientific method, similarities between scientific stories and humanist narratives, and the notion of science as determining and being determined by culture. I argue that the profound difference between the two lies in subjective responses to which of the two determines social progress.</p>

         <title>CASE STUDY I: THE EXAMPLE OF LITERATURE AND SCIENCE; HOW THE SCIENCES AND HUMANITIES PROFOUNDLY DIFFER—AND ARE PARALLEL</title>
         <p>Scholars have attempted to merge the sciences and literature, and, as I describe, they have approached the sciences along epistemic lines and the humanities along rhetorical ones. For this reason, the traditional divide between the sciences and the humanities is yet to be overcome. For example, at a conference forum at the 2007 meeting of the Modern Language Association, the topic “biocultures: an emerging paradigm” was debated. Each of the conference speakers spoke significantly on the topic of science and culture, and the presentations were directly and implicitly imbued with themes of interdisciplinarity. These talks also exposed the problems of interdisciplinary research, notwithstanding Peterson's critique, and why the humanities have been careful to tread on territories traditionally reserved for science.</p>
         <p>What is the biocultural paradigm? Lennard J. Davis's inauguration of the notion of biocultures as an emerging paradigm in humanistic disciplines is a similar kind of intervention that breaks down or resituates barriers between the cultural and biological. As Davis states: “In the end, by moving to a biocultural model of interdisciplinarity, we can make up for the deficiencies of both the sciences and the humanities and produce new and better knowledge” (2007, 951). Davis puts an onus on humanities scholars to become more than “scientific dilettantes” for “a meaningful understanding of others” (951). “Humanists,” he notes, “are being recruited to fill in the ethical- and social-impact blanks for scientists…. I've been advocating that we develop competencies in various areas of science so that we can create a new category of biocultural knowledge” (950). However, Davis asks, would we risk becoming just dilettantish versions of our better-trained colleagues? Davis refutes the charge of dilettantism in two ways, remarking that many of us in the humanities work in areas that require detailed knowledge of the body, technology, and history of medicine. “The advantage we have over our science colleagues is hat we need to be inherently interdisciplinary while they believe they don't” (951). Second, Davis adds, humanists can improve not only our own work but also the work of those in the sciences by rounding out the kinds of knowledge they need but don't know they need. “Our expertise in an area like race could only improve research protocols and therefore outcomes. In other words, our knowledge can help make better science” (951). I would not argue here. Furthermore, Davis aspires to extending beyond dilettantism by arriving at technical competence (“minimally competent scientific knowledge”) (951) such that a humanist presumably could converse with an expert.</p>
         <p>Davis, seemingly arguing from a theoretical front, asserts that humanists can engage with science on certain intellectual bases. I would agree that the science-humanities divide is bridged by humanists' conversing with scientists, but also by their entering laboratories to conduct scientific research and realizing the complexities of the scientific (and the scientist's) life. And contrary to what Davis might state, scientists are not all that averse to interdisciplinary endeavors. I conducted scientific research in a molecular biology laboratory after completing my doctoral studies in literature at the University of California, San Diego. At UC Berkeley, I collaborated with laboratory teams on an interdisciplinary National Science Foundation proposal on the scientific method and ethics. I argue that there is interest in things literary, or at least concerns inflected with social significance among scientists, and that they (scientists) are not totally unreceptive to the humanists' mission.</p>
         <p>Another divide lies in the policy arena. Jay Clayton argues that to redress the situation of the lack of humanists on policy panels, humanists needs to demonstrate how culture plays a role with respect to science: “To correct this imbalance, we need to reposition literary studies within the institutional framework of the university and the professional economy of the nation…. We need to show how our expertise in analyzing [that cultural representations of science have important consequences] can be of value to policy debates” (2007, 948).</p>
         <p>To offer a medical analogy, Clayton diagnoses the symptoms and but does not ascertain the underlying causes. For example, why aren't humanists included in policy recommendation procedures? First, there are strict professional guidelines that scientists and particularly physicians must follow about what can and cannot be said in public that humanists aren't necessarily beholden to. This is through such groups as the American Medical Association that offer ethical standards for public accountability for physicians (and scientists). The lack of this type of accountability among humanists fails to attribute credibility. It goes back to the age-old dichotomy that humanists give subjective opinion while scientists and physicians offer credible and indisputable facts.</p>
         <p>Priscilla Wald states that “if humanists want to engage in dialogues with scientists and policy makers, we need to articulate the nature of our expertise. Cross-disciplinary conversations can be frustrating: what constitutes as evidence in the sciences differs from what constitutes evidence in the humanities, and that is an especially difficult divide to cross” (2007, 954). This is indeed accurate, as exemplified by scenario 1, where the humanist speaker was asked a question about “studies.” Wald alludes to another divide between humanists and scientists that must be bridged, having to do with the rhetorical limitations that literary humanists and critics impose on themselves. As Wald states:
<disp-quote>
               <p>The difference in the kinds of questions asked by bioethicists and by literary critics or theorists, for example, underscores the distinctive contribution that each makes to debates about the implications of scientific research. Bioethicists are increasingly turning to literary and cinematic works, as Jay Clayton has pointed out, because those works dramatize ethical dilemmas and stage how people might experience developments in biotechnology and medicine. A literary-critical approach, by distinction, builds on the insight that literary works can give into how the circulation of language, images, and stories constitutes lived experience. These works animate assumptions embedded in everyday language and can thereby help us see how public perceptions are shaped. (954)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>I believe this conceptualization imposes a limitation on what literary works can hope to achieve in the public arena, serving purely rhetorical rather than epistemic aims, and may be one of the reasons (which as I describe below) that the approach to merging literature and science often seems fragmentary. I would argue that literary works are able to directly influence scientific practice and methodology in addition to enlightening scientific discourse.</p>
         <p>In this context, John Cartwright also offers a conceptual framework for understanding science and literature and their confluence. He states that literary theorists such as Gillian Beer and George Levine show how “both science and literature belong to a common culture and how literary methods can illuminate the generation of scientific knowledge” (2007, 116). In its most extreme form this leads to a type of cultural relativism where science is treated as an epistemologically unprivileged discourse or narrative, exemplified in the works of George Levine. Cartwright suggests eight categories that describe the interaction between science and iterature: (1) science as metaphor, (2) science derided or rejected, (3) science as provoking cognitive dissonance requiring intellectual accommodation, (4) science celebrated as Divine power, (5) poems of science, (6) the Romantic dismissal of science as cold and inhuman, (7) scientific irresponsibility (Faust and Frankenstein figures), and (8) literature or science claiming ontological primacy. Notwithstanding the eight categories, Cartwright argues that “it is fair to say, however, that there is probably no universally accepted paradigm or methodology for pursuing such studies” (115).</p>
         <p>Cartwright is mainly right. Literature and science do differ methodologically; hence any set of discussions merging them would involve various sets of methods. However, despite the profound differences, literature and science share enough epistemological similarities to result in a paradigmatic approach to interdisciplinarity between them. I am not only referring to the rhetorical qualities of scientific texts (Bazerman 1988; Gross 1990) and scientific approaches to criticism within literary theory, such as semiotics, both of which are well established on ontological bases. Bruno Latour discusses in <italic>Laboratory Life</italic> how science is constructed through textual inscriptions and how the production of papers constitutes output from the laboratory (Latour and Woolgar 1979). Many would argue that the humanities are conceived similarly, however, in the setting of the faculty office and conferences rather than the scientific laboratory. While other aspects of similarity reside in science's narrative contexts, the parallels between science and literature (and the humanities) are in their aims: they both attempt to achieve epistemic status in a manner that influences the academy, society, and culture. However, because there is no universally recognized basis for assessing these influences, the merger of the two often seems fragmentary and isolated, and without an academic home, disciplinary or otherwise.</p>

      <sec id="s03">
         <title>CASE STUDY II: INTERDISCIPLINARITY AND BIOETHICS</title>
         <p>In turn, bioethics has opened its doors to postcolonial and cultural studies, with the emergence of postcolonial bioethics and postmodern biomedical ethics. Ana Iltis discusses the interdisciplinarity of bioethics, in offering that although there are competing accounts of the birth of bioethics, “these accounts share the claim that bioethics was not born in a single disciplinary home or in a single social space, but in numerous, including hospitals, doctors' offices, research laboratories, courtrooms, medical schools, churches and synagogues, and philosophy classrooms” (2006, 629). She adds:
<disp-quote>
               <p>Interdisciplinarity and the concern with issues that arise in a variety of social spheres, such as government, hospitals and other health care facilities, laboratories and private industry, remain important features of bioethics…. Bioethics is interdisciplinary and analysis of bioethical issues depends on the input of many different disciplines.</p>
               <p>New voices are entering the dialogue and making contributions to bioethics. These include economists (e.g., on organ donation incentives and sales), policy experts (e.g., on health care access), sociologists and anthropologists (e.g., on conflicts of interest in biomedical research and the concepts of health and disease), epidemiologists (e.g., on health disparities and health risks), psychologists (e.g., on moral development and ethics education), and members of nursing and allied health professions (e.g., on role of non-physicians in treatment decision making and the role of research nurses in informed consent for research participation). (630)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>“By way of example,” continues Iltis, “I have endorsed Kopelman's (2006) claim that bioethics is and will remain interdisciplinary; it is a discipline that broadens rather than narrows the subject matter it considers” (632). Culture has become an important part of bioethics discourse. As Iltis remarks:
<disp-quote>
               <p>We have become more aware of the impact culture and ethnicity may have on health care, including communication issues, beliefs about authority and decision making in the clinical setting, and different views about the appropriateness of patients receiving care from members of the opposite sex. Growing emphasis on cultural competence has led to a new set of voices contributing to bioethics, persons who because of their personal or professional backgrounds can help us understand cultural issues relevant to health care. To the extent that the importance of culture has been acknowledged, that there are discussions of how to respond to requests grounded in cultural values, practices, or beliefs, and that health care professionals are being encouraged to understand and respond with respect to cultural differences, we may expect those who hold religious beliefs also will seek to have their values acknowledged as relevant and legitimate. (632)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Tod Chambers notes that “bioethicists mark their place in the moral world of medicine by telling tales of how they moved from academia to the bedside, from the periphery to the center. And they mark their place in bioethics through competing visions of the discipline and its methods set out in rhetorical strategies that ‘center’ different approaches, such as principlist, casuist, or narrative. In the process, they reveal the poetics of moral argument” (2000, 22).</p>
         <p>However, Chambers adds, “But I must confess that I doubt that this is the reason that one rarely hears the names Butler, Bourdieu, Benjamin, Spivak, Said, and Fanon cited, much less even known, by so many in the field. This oversight, I believe, has profoundly impoverished bioethics. Often we seem to become interested in ideas about ten years after they have been well explored by the rest of the humanities” (15).</p>
         <p>Critical race issues are now figuring into bioethical discussions. In “Differences from Somewhere: The Normativity of Whiteness in Bioethics in the United States,” Catherine Myser argues that “there has been inadequate attention to and questioning of the dominance and normativity of whiteness in the cultural construction of bioethics in the United States. Therefore we risk reproducing white privilege and white supremacy in its theory, method, and practices” (2003, 1). Myser defines whiteness and traces its broader social and legal history in the United States:
<disp-quote>
               <p>I then begin to mark whiteness in U.S. bioethics, recasting Renee Fox's sociological marking of its Americanness as an important initial marking of its whiteness/WASP ethos. Furthermore, I consider the attempts of social scientists to highlight sociocultural diversity as a corrective in U.S. bioethics. I argue that because they fail to problematize white dominance and normativity and the white-other dualism when they describe the standpoints of African-American, Asian-American, and Native-American others, their work merely inoculates difference and creates or maintains minoritized spaces. Accordingly, the dominant white center of mainstream U.S. bioethics must be problematized and displaced for diversity research to make a difference. In conclusion, I give several examples of how we might advance the recommended endeavor of exploring our own ethnicity, class, and other social positioning and norms operating in U.S. bioethics, briefly highlighting “white talk” as one challenge. (1)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Tod Chambers adds, “Myser has introduced the notion of ‘whiteness,’ but one can only hope that an entire array of additional critical terms will widen our world, such as episteme, hegemony, queer, orientalism, subaltern, habitus, alterity, fetishism, and gaze” (2003, 15).</p>
         <p>These concepts from cultural theory would have—and have had—great impact on bioethical discourse, stemming from their impact on literary studies. These concepts have expanded into literary theory to the extent that <italic>Orientalism</italic>, <italic>The Wretched of the Earth</italic>, and <italic>Gender Trouble</italic> have become part of the corpus of first-year literature courses. In terms of bioethics, one can include cultural theory in a discussion of analytical ethics. Such traditional bioethical topics as justice, personal sovereignty, autonomy, and equality would be framed in an inclusive social discourse of race, gender, ethnicity, and sexual orientation rather than in the ideology of individualism.</p>
         <p>It would seem that bioethicists are open to critical interpretations and that the status of science in the academy has not singularized their approaches. Many bioethicists also call for a more humanizing biomedicine, one that goes beyond objectivity, detachment, and disinterest towards a distinctive clinical, empathetic outlook (Marcum 2008). This call would seem to encourage approaches beyond a dispassionate, analytical bioethics that have since dominated the field. It would seem that these meta-ethical approaches to science leave the door open for literary criticism to enter. In fact, the field of medical humanities, which exists in tandem with many bioethics departments across the country, traverses these topics and involves the study of literature and medicine.</p>

      <sec id="s04">
         <title>WHY WE NEED—AND SHOULD DESIRE—INTERDISCIPLINARITY</title>
         <p>Science studies has been defined by a new research model termed by Mario Biagioli “modular cross-disciplinarity,” which constitutes “problem-specific collaboration takes place within a limited temporal window” and does not have “lasting institutional life” (2009, 821). As Biagioli states in “Postdisciplinary Liaisons: Science Studies and the Humanities”, “One can draw the disciplinary boundaries of science studies in a variety of ways. In the present context, I take them to include the history, sociology, philosophy and ethnography of science, technology and medicine…. But unlike other disciplinary products of World War II, such as area studies or comparative literature, science studies has not been directly challenged by the emergence of postcolonial and cultural studies, nor has it been hurt by the restructuring of funding and research priorities following the end of the cold war (817).</p>
         <p>Biagioli asserts that science studies has held up because it kept in line with the status of science, possibly forgetting the epistemic foundations of the humanities:
<disp-quote>
               <p>An explanation for science studies' fortunate position is that the relevance of science has kept increasing…. Today's technoscience frames our everyday life at all levels, down to our notion of self. (818)</p>
               <p>While science studies does not have the scale or the resources to replicate the modus operandi of the sciences, it is still very much affected by it since such practices constitute science studies' object of study. In this sense, we could say that science studies practitioners are not so much held together by institutional ties or shared canons as by being symbiotically (or parasitically) tied to the sciences and their research questions. (820)</p>
               <p>The possibility of extensive connections between science studies and the humanities reflects a perception that the most promising approaches in science studies today do not borrow as much from the social sciences as they do from the humanities. (823)</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>However, Biagioli would like for more alliances to be forged between the humanities and science studies: “It makes sense, therefore, for science studies to view the humanities as a natural fellow traveler and likely collaborator. Not only do we share a familiarity with key philosophical resources and theoretical outlooks but we have a mutual interest in materiality of inscriptions (both textual and visual), as well as a certain openness to recognizing nonhuman agency in such inscriptions—an openness gained from critiques of authorial agency, from philosophical analyses of what writing is and does, and from empirical studies provided by historians of print culture” (821).</p>
         <p>I would argue that science studies not having made themselves amenable to the humanities (in order to keep up with the sciences) is a question of holding on to the status of science alongside significant differences in methods, both epistemologically and ontologically, and theoretically and empirically. But these claims are not so much under contention as the following set of statements:

               <p>Like the humanities, the sciences have not been spared cuts in federal funding in the last decade, but, unlike the humanities, they have managed to remain a dominant presence on campus. They keep providing substantial overheads from federal grants and royalties from patents licensing, and they are now developing more and more partnerships with the private sectors. And thanks to the technophilia that permeates the contemporary culture, the sciences look cool, too; [b]y contrast the humanities look less sexy in their posttheory phase, they produce few goods one can attach a dollar sign to, and they rely on a narrower range of external support.</p>
               <p>Education being the main “product” the humanities has to offer (a product whose value is both long-term and hard to quantify), it is highly unlikely that they will ever be able to match the sciences in terms of clout and resources. There is not much we can do about that. What we can do, however, is avoid being epistemologically intimidated by the sciences—a problem I see as much more serious concern than concerns about finances and institutional clout. (825)</p>

         <p>Biagioli offers a portrait of scientific problem solving through collaboration: “The sciences produce cross-disciplinarity within groups, not individuals, by bringing differently specialized researchers together around a problem” (820).</p>
         <p>Yet for all its collaborations and problem solving, the sciences actually fall short of meeting the intellectual needs of the academy. Many do not confront the realization by numerous individuals that science and technology (and its methods) cannot solve all societal problems; hence, by science studies mimicking the trends of the sciences, they recapitulate these shortcomings. There are glaring gaps created by the sciences that the humanities can fill, and do fill, even if a dollar amount cannot be attached. In other words, as science grows and expands, so will the humanities, because they both ask and answer separate sets of questions that have distinct intellectual significance and fulfill distinct social needs, which are not necessarily transposed onto neat hierarchical categories, disciplinary or otherwise. In other words, it boils down to episteme.</p>
         <p>Rather than attaching it to science and its accompanying status, Sharon McKenzie Stevens offers an approach for science studies that would make it more amenable to interdisciplinary aims. In her abstract, Stevens states that Wiebe Bijker calls for scholars in science and technology studies (STS) to become public intellectuals by actively working toward “democratizing … technological culture. Many STS scholars have developed practices that support democratic and public activity; yet, these typically require individual commitment with inadequate institutional support. The public work of STS scholars can be better supported through a program that includes (1) using specialist research in nonreproductive educational contexts, (2) redefining and revaluing academic service, (3) developing more accessible ways of writing, and (4) publishing and valuing STS-based texts that circulate among nonacademic audiences” (2008, 730). This idea of the public intellectual might programmatically place science studies among more interdisciplinary ventures.</p>
         <p>One of the many reasons we may need interdisciplinarity is that the advancement of disciplinary knowledge may have unwittingly and exclusively benefited the sciences, institutionally and financially, and has led to an intellectual hierarchy of the humanities and sciences. The maintenance of disciplinary specialization would mandate that science retain epistemic foundations, whereas the humanities operate on a purely rhetorical level, a situation that may in fact be exacerbated by certain trends in interdisciplinarity, as exemplified by the biocultures paradigm. Interdisciplinarity would serve to mitigate this situation by retaining both the humanities and sciences on epistemic levels, which science has a sure footing in, while the humanities are rhetorically inflected. In addressing the state of interdisciplinarity, the merging of the disciplines between those related to scientific discourses and the humanities, the intellectual needs of the academy and societal needs would be met.</p>

         <title>INTERDISCIPLINARY CROSS TALK</title>
         <p>Why have some bioethicists called for the humanities (especially literary criticism) to enter into their discussions, while science studies scholars have limited themselves to studying science critically through either the methods of the social sciences or through lenses that recapitulate the social and academic status of science? The origins of bioethics and science studies are interdisciplinary, but bioethics has programmatically remained so in light of bioethical case study interpretations, whereas science studies have metamorphosed into disciplinary approaches to analyzing science. Both adopt critical perspectives but the methods in bioethics have remained fluid while those in science studies have seemingly become codified into modular cross-disciplinarity, which, even according to Biagioli, has little institutional longevity. The question should be asked about why this is the case.</p>
         <p>One of the answers to this question, as alluded to earlier, may be that because of the ethical nature of bioethical questions, there is a tendency to challenge the status and objectivity of medical science. This tendency has allowed bioethics to draw more freely from the humanities, which allegedly imposes a “softer side” onto interpretations of hard sciences. I would argue that science studies needs to adopt many of the positions of bioethics and accommodate the entrance of ethics into scientific processes. Stevens may in fact be implying this in her definition of the science studies scholar as public intellectual. Science studies' latching on to the status and potency of science may attribute to it disciplinary credibility and intellectual cogency, but to meet the needs of the academy and society, its epistemic foundations should result in more interdisciplinary programs, rather than disciplinary specialization. These interdisciplinary programs would allow for the entrance of humanities topics, such as cultural studies, postcolonial studies, and literary criticism, into science studies and make room for ethical frameworks within the confines of science through science studies itself. This scenario would resemble the intellectual trajectory of bioethics, which has allowed postmodernism, hermeneutics, and poststructuralism into bioethical case study frameworks (Marta 1997; Arras 1997; Shildrick 2008).</p>
         <p>Epistemic cross talk needs to take place, whereby the humanities inform science studies much like they inform bioethics. In the context of bioethics, the humanities offered pivotal ways of clarifying and qualifying biomedical science beyond the rhetorical analysis that literary criticism can offer and also traverse. The status of science and medicine, while paramount, do not serve as obstacles to true interdisciplinarity.</p>
