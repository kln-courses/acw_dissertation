<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SPIRIT LORD OF BAISHI MOUNTAIN: FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE YINYANG* K.E. Brashier In the Eastern Han Dynasty, good fortune could result from a fruitful interaction with spirits from beyond the mundane world. If they so de sired, such external agencies could cause humans to experience bounty and blessings. Paraphrasing several lines from the Songs Classic or Shi jing two typical couplets from a mountain inscription depict this interaction as follows: eiMfiXffX ' With the excellent alcohol so delightful, ° And the roasted meat so fragrant, ® ISM IE ' We regard with reverence the illuminating sacrifice, P^H7LSx 0 And the blessings sent downward are great and generous. This perspective of the cosmos is of a personal exchange between con tracted agents or a satisfied supernatural customer paying his bill after having a good meal.1 In the Eastern Han Dynasty, good fortune could also result from cor rectly resonating with dynamic cosmological forces that were in perpetual cyclic motion. Automatically, the yinyang or the five phases reverberated with human endeavors and naturally reflected their merits and demerits. Paraphrasing several lines from the Discourses of the States or Guo yu [II If}, a different set of couplets from a mountain inscription depicts this interaction as follows: ' Therefore heaven has no concealing yin, i{&gt; And earth has no arousing yang. zk$S;£fcJR ' Water has no pent-up qi-vapors, : &lt;Y: .f-m o And fire has no calamitous blazes. * I would like to thank Roel Sterckx, Donald Harper, Martin Kern, and an anonymous reviewer for Early China for their valuable assistance in producing this article. 1.

This perspective of the cosmos is of a well-aligned holistic system based on correlative thinking or of rationally embracing the ideal of "going with the flow." Thus fortune could be attributed either to supernatural agencies engaging in causal relationships or to cosmological systems consisting of resonance relationships. That both perspectives—mindful gods and mindless cycles—existed side-by-side in the Eastern Han is not surpris ing, nor is it surprising that both would find expression in mountain inscriptions. What may be unexpected is that both of the above sets of couplets are from the same mountain inscription and that both sets are in fact contiguous. Dated to 183 C.E., the "Stele to the Spirit Lord of Baishi Mountain" (Baishi shenjun bei E=i 5 WS5?) groups these seemingly dispa rate understandings of the cosmos without any sense of contradiction. This juxtaposition is by no means unique to the Baishi Mountain stele (the mountain is located in modern Hebei Province), and the surviving mountain inscription texts from the Eastern Han regularly mix cosmologi cal metaphors. On the one hand, the mountain spirits listen to prayers, eat sacrifices, enjoy wine to the point of drunkenness, and send mes sages to the imperial court at Luoyang. They even appear as human in dreams. As individuated, anthropomorphized agencies, their interactions are judged in terms of morality—in terms of a higher standard within which multiple agencies must interact. On the other hand, mountains are originally the spontaneous product of yin and yang, their particular configurations of qi-vapors reflecting the hexagrams of heaven and earth in the cosmological systems of the Changes Canon or Yi jing JpjfM- They contain the "treasure of yin," the watery ^/-vapors that regularly issue forth as seasonal rain. As components of mechanized cycles, they may work for a moral balance, but because they do not operate within any higher standard, they themselves are not moral but regular.2 The simultaneous existence of these two different cosmological per spectives could be explained in at least four different ways: 1. Different people held different perspectives. Some modern secondary studies paint a picture of two powerful groups of people back ing these different perspectives at odds with one another—of polarized court factions defined by their ideologies and locked in 2. For a recent discussion of how mechanized forces such as the five phases and yinyang are not moral but regular, see David Schaberg, A Patterned Past: Form and Thought in Early Chinese Historiography (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 2001), 96-98</page><page sequence="3">K.E. BRASHIER 161 combat.3 Other studies have long divided China into popular/ commoner and literati/court cultures. Yet recent, more nuanced discussions have recognized that such cosmological, philosophical and religious perspectives do not necessarily divide along faction or class lines because the same people can simultaneously hold dif ferent, inconsistent perspectives.4 The fact that both perspectives exist side-by-side in the same inscriptions—as well as in many other Han documents and rituals—5also implies that dividing them along faction or class lines is here inappropriate. 3. Wang Aihe recently described the two factions within "the cosmological debate over emperorship" as follows: Scholar-officials were the builders and living components of the imperial gov ernment; they were the ones who constructed the comprehensive cosmological system that sanctioned the emperor's authority yet at the same time constrained his personal power. The emperor, while dependent on the scholar-officials' system building for his authority and rule, sought to break away from the constraints of the system and increase his personal power. To do so, the emperor relied on religious specialists whom he personally hired—diviners, magic masters (fangshi 73 it, recipe gentlemen), and shamans (am M)—who served the emperor by helping him establish personal contact with the incalculable and infinite divine forces and deities. See Wang, Cosmology and Political Culture in Early China, (Cambridge: Cambridge Univer sity Press, 2000), 175. Wang well argues the differences between these two perspectives, but I would only somewhat temper her tidy, "either/or" approach by allowing the two inconsistent perspectives to be held simultaneously, as will be evident below. 4. For example, Poo Mu-chou recognizes that elites may have practiced one set of beliefs at court and another at home, and he rightly concludes, "Thus, one cannot as sume the existence of a 'religion of the intellectuals' and a 'religion of the commoners' without seriously oversimplifying the situation." Even so, he lapses into the traditional class division elsewhere in his book. See Poo, In Search of Personal Welfare: A View of Ancient Chinese Religion (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998), 3-5,184. 5. This issue of simultaneously holding such inconsistent perspectives extends well beyond the mountain inscriptions and is characteristic of much Han religion. For ex ample, charts excavated at Mawangdui organize gods in terms of the five phases, and in like fashion, Wang Mang slotted gods into directional groups around the capital. Benjamin Schwartz's discussion entitled "Correlative Cosmology and the Realm of Religion" (The World of Thought in Ancient China [Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1985], 369-78) remains an excellent background summary to this "ongoing tension be tween the kind of religion which was compatible with correlative cosmology and the religious tendencies resistant to the subordination of the vast and incalculable realm of divine power to the constraints of the system" (p. 374). Its only shortcoming is that it does not handle particular texts in which this tension is manifested and so the mechan ics and the language of the tension remain unexplored. It is hoped that this article is a concrete case study that bears out many of Schwartz's generalizations but also expands upon them, adding nuances to his arguments and showing how the resolution of the tension was specifically realized and deemed acceptable.</page><page sequence="4">162 FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE YINYANG 2. The same people held different perspectives but simply never recognized the inconsistencies or never considered the inconsistencies significant. There is merit to this explanation as all humans operate in multiple inconsistent genres of discourse,6 and thus our fixating on the incon sistencies might be making proverbial mountains out of molehills. Yet various writers scattered across early Chinese history—Yan Ying HH (ca. 589-500 B.C.e.), Xun Qing HP (ca. 335-ca. 238 b.c.e.), Wang Chong EE3E (27-ca. 100 c.e.), Chenggong Sui (231-273 C.E.), and many others—lamented these inconsistent positions held by their contemporaries on whether external agencies or resonance systems characterized the cosmos. For example, in one Han myth a supermonster called Gonggong jt-I broke a column holding up the heavens, the resulting angle causing all the world's water to run perpetually eastward. That is, an external agency was responsible for this particularity of the cosmos. Wang Chong complained as follows: tt&amp;mzx' ° ' timmmt»^ immim - Rtmnm»° - a ° This lore has long existed, and people in general believe the words to be true. Educated people may think it strange but have no means to deny it, and if they do deny it, they have no means to sort it out. They also fear it might be true and so never dare to formulate correct opinions. If we analyze this story in terms of heaven's Dao and human affairs, it is merely baseless talk.7 In his opinion, even the educated classes are ambivalent on such matters. Elsewhere he criticized the popular usage of metaphors in which the spontaneous creation of the universe was likened to a potter or blacksmith intentionally making a product. He and oth ers expressed dissatisfaction with people who could not maintain a consistent understanding of the world. 3. People placed limits on their own understanding of cosmological mecha nisms. One such limitation was to declare that it was a mystery, 6. For an argument that multiple inconsistent genres of discourse were more accept able and legitimate in early China than in the modern West, see the introduction to Brashier, The Ancestral Cults in Early Imperial China (forthcoming). 7.

In the Baishi Mountain stele, this mountain spirit "mysteriously assists heaven and earth" (youzan tiandi in nourishing the cosmos. Another such limitation amply evident throughout this inscription was to fall back upon canonical allusions or precedents and simply leave it at that. 4. Certain compromise paradigms existed between a universe overseen by external agencies and that consisting of resonating cycles. That is, there existed certain paradigms in which independent agencies were subsumed into systems such as lineages and bureaucracies. That subsumption of spiritual agency into a restrictive system was enabled or maintained through ritual, and so one of ritual's roles was to balance individual agency and comprehensive system. Such paradigms may have mitigated any sense of inconsistency between these two perspectives as deities were not wholly independent nor systems wholly mindless. This article focuses upon the Baishi Mountain stele and uses it to explore this fourth explanation. After placing both Chinese mountains in general and the Baishi Mountain in particular into a contextual frame, this article presents a translation and study of the stele inscription divided into eight thematic sections; that is, I use the structure of the inscription itself and its themes to examine the Eastern Han perspectives of mountains, the relationship between mountains, the most-valued mountain assets, and the history of inscribed mountains.8 Having detailed the key elements of its content, the inscription may serve as a case study to answer in part (and only in part) the question of how agency- and system-oriented cosmologies might exist side-by-side. Placing Mountains in Context With sixty-five percent of China's current total land area occupied by mountains, hills, and plateaus,9 it is perhaps not surprising that moun tains heavily figure into the ancient ritual environment. Yet as most of the Han population lived in the level space of the North China Plain, the Wei River Valley and the Sichuan Basin, mountains were generally 8. For the most part, the sectioning of the inscription is thematically determined; sometimes these sections also reflect the inscription's original language as in transitional phrases and rhyme changes. 9. Land of less than 500 meters in elevation also occupies only 25.2% of the current total land area, and of the twelve largest peaks in the world, seven of them are located in China.

Those who left for the mountains also left the empire in both a practi cal and symbolic sense. On one hand, migrants fled war and poverty to settle in mountainous areas and were not included in Han population registers.11 On the other, "the people of mountains and forests" (shanlin zhi shi |i|#^.±) or "the people of cliffs and caves" {yanxue zhi shi Tt/id::) embraced waxing religions and avoided waning courts, their numbers significantly rising during the last century of the Han.12 Dated to 181 c.e., a fragmentary hymn on one of Baishi Mountain's neighboring peaks describes the people who "gather like clouds," drawn in reverent devotion to the peak: Among them were those who hid away as hermits, Avoiding speech. Among them were those who practiced quietude, Nourishing purity. Among them were those who employed breathing techniques, Seeking to prolong their existence.13 Far from condoning such behavior, the Han court praised a local ruler if no one chose a hermit's life in his jurisdiction, and oddly, a later segment of this same inscription commends Feng Xun the prefect of Yuan Si at pp p rj 10.

Aat Vervoorn traces different types of eremeticism in early China, from immor tality-seeking Daoists who indeed might go off into the mountains to philosophically minded Daoists for whom withdrawal was a state of mind, not location; from sincere Han Confucians who withdrew from the corrupt court in disgust to posturing Han Confucians who fashionably retired to gain prestige and even imperial attention. Some people may have fled to the mountains to escape danger, but Vervoorn argues at length that withdrawing from society is not inherently connected to living in the mountains. "A shaman may go to a mountain in order to draw spiritual power from it, and in retiring to such an isolated place provide a model for hermits who retire for other reasons, but for Zhuangzi's sage, as we shall see, eremiticism is a state of mind, something which does not depend on physical location. The spirit man of Guye Mountain sees no point in becoming involved in the affairs of the world, but that is not the reason he lives on his mountain."

No matter how the apparent contradiction in these two state ments is resolved, they both imply the separatist nature of the mountains themselves and of those who would associate with them. Mountains carry a sense of separation not just for the living but also for the dead. Mountains were the locality of graves, and grave deeds regularly draw from mountain imagery in their focus upon separation. For example, a second-century grave deed inscribed on lead states the following: The living belong to Chang'an; [A] UL| The dead belong to Tai Mountain. [May] the dead and the living dwell in separate places [£$] And be unable to interfere with one another.14 Others stress that the living of Chang'an and the dead of Tai Moun tain are so separate that they do not remember one another in joy or in grief. Still others note that the Yellow Spirit (Huangshen ft both governs the Five Marchmounts that anchor each region of the empire (see below) and simultaneously oversees the registers of the dead.15 These associations are not limited to grave deeds. A little-studied Eastern Han divination guide known as the Yi lin associates the dead with mountains, as in the following ominous verse: tF PI A ghost occupies our gateway, 1? fS A [i!

In addition to living and dead separatists, those who avoided death altogether both separated themselves from the rest of society and associ ated themselves with mountains. From Penglai H#! to Kunlun from pictorial to etymological evidence, the association between mountains and immortals or transcendents (xian f|lj) is already well documented. Even a conventional sage king of Classicism could become immortalized when commended to the mountains, as in the inscription to Jiuyi Moun tain UL] by Cai Yong MM (133-192), the hymn of which concludes [Shun] was subsequently buried at Jiuyi Mountain, Experienced a deliverance of the body17 and arose. He ascended this precipitous summit, And became entrusted to the efficacious spirits and transcendents.18 Cai Yong was perhaps the foremost Classicist scholar of the late Eastern Han and was responsible for having the texts of the Classicist tradition inscribed on stone, but here he has the sage king Shun ^ engaged in corporeal transcendence to join the immortals of the peaks. He is simply meeting the expectations of this particular genre of discourse, transform ing one of Classicism's greatest heroes into a popular immortal. Thus those separatists of Han society—whether by choice, by death, or by transcendence—were all associated with mountains, demonstrating a perceptual gulf between the mountains and the inhabited plains below. Mountains were physically and conceptually a boundary region where the Han Chinese could potentially encounter the fringes of other realms.19 as follows: SllfcSI KSWiij yanjiu MISWi^4tS0Sn|5?SSW^/ vol. 1 (Beijing: Kexue, 1958); hereafter, Han yun bu.

BRASHIER 167 Placing Baishi Mountain in Context Geography is not limited to the physical terrain and its features; it extends to the distribution of human populations and the effects of human activity. Even the process of merely identifying geographic fea tures is a human activity, such as when humans demarcate and name mountains. According to George Lakoff and Mark Johnson, humans project boundaries on nature and elsewhere by necessity: When things are not clearly discrete or bounded, we still categorize them as such, e.g. mountains, street corners, hedges, etc. Such ways of viewing physical phenomena are needed to satisfy certain pur poses that we have: locating mountains, meeting at street corners, trimming hedges. Human purposes typically require us to impose artificial boundaries that make physical phenomena discrete just as we are: entities bounded by a surface.20 Thus simply recognizing a mountain as a mountain is a human act and the beginning of a mental map that overlays the physical terrain. Lakoff and Johnson here also suggest that imposing boundaries on our mountains makes them akin to our bounded selves. Theoretically, such a projection may be the beginning of assigning human-like agency to them. At its extreme, humans impose schematized and humanized patterns on their terrain that ultimately bear little resemblance to real topography, especially when such mental mapping is highly symmetric. Both the Han court and Han scholars overlaid physical China with such a mental map by demarcating "Five Marchmounts" or "Five Peaks" (wuyue SUE) that supervised the four cardinal directions plus the center of the empire.21 not unique to early China. Anthony Ashley Cooper in the early eighteenth century vividly describes how humans project spirits onto the cloudy peaks: Here space astonishes; silence itself seems pregnant, whilst unknown force works on the mind, and dubious objects move the wakeful sense. Mysterious voices are either heard or fancied, and various forms of deity seem to present themselves and appear more manifest in these sacred silvan scenes, such as of old gave rise to temples and favoured the religion of the ancient world. Even we ourselves, who in plain characters may read divinity from so many bright parts of the earth, choose rather these obscurer places to spell out that mysterious being, which to our weak eyes at best appears under a veil of cloud.

Mark Edward Lewis alludes to using mountains in this mental mapping of the world when describing the antecedents to the Han/eng-sacrifices at Tai Mountain (to be briefly discussed below). He writes, "Mountain sacrifices—previously invoking</page><page sequence="10">168 FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE YINYANG That abstract scheme became tangible when human rituals were added, rituals that constructed altar-space and ceremony-time atop each of those peaks. Because rituals can be seen and heard, they lend physicality to what was previously only imagined.22 When Han emperors made an imperial progress through their physical landscape, they affirmed the ritual landscape with sacrifices to those peaks, and so over time, that mental map also became held down with the weight of tradition and culture. Mental geographies are also affirmed by where the emperors did not normally carry out sacrifices. On the route between the Eastern Han capi tal Luoyang and the Northern Marchmount of Changshan # [i| (a.k.a. Hengshan fS LU), the emperors passed through the district of Yuanshi.23 Yuanshi has its own series of local sacred peaks that brought benefits to its regional populace, and their sacrifices fell under its own jurisdiction albeit sometimes with imperial approval. A set of five surviving Eastern Han stele inscriptions plus one inscription text that survives through the powers of locality, fertility, and military force—were linked together in the schematic, geometrizing world models of the period to serve as ritual metonyms for the totality of the earth and its links to Heaven." See Lewis, "The Feng and Shan Sacrifices of Emperor Wu of the Han," in State and Court Ritual in China, ed. Joseph E McDermott (Cambridge: Cambridge University Fress, 1999), 64. 22. In her studies of lineage sacrifice, Nancy Jay argues that rituals created tan gible—albeit artificial—ties. She theorizes as follows: Rights of membership in a matrilineage may be determined by birth alone, providing sure knowledge of maternity. Faternity never has the same natural certainty, and birth by itself cannot be the sole criterion for patrilineage member ship. . . . When the crucial intergenerational link is between father and son, for which birth by itself cannot provide sure evidence, sacrificing may be considered essential for the continuity of the social order. What is needed to provide clear evidence of social and religious paternity is an act as definite and available to the senses as is birth. When membership in patrilineal descent groups is identified by rights of participation in blood sacrifice, evidence of "paternity" is created which is as certain as evidence of maternity, but far more flexible. See Jay, Throughout Your Generations Forever: Sacrifice, Religion, and Paternity (Chicago: University of Chicago Fress, 1992), 36. In other words, rituals do not represent invis ible ties but create the ties and are a kind of substitute evidence when the senses lack tangible proof of kinship. As will be seen below, this type of thinking may be useful in understanding mountain sacrifices and how mental maps are created and crystalized through the performance of rituals. Via sacrificial ritual, humans make visible the pat terns and relationships that are in reality invisible but are perceived to be real. 23. For an example of an imperial entourage making sacrifices to the Northern Marchmount and stopping in Yuanshi as it returned to Luoyang, see Hou Han shu MW (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1965), 3.155. Yuanshi is roughly 140 kilometers south of the Northern Marchmount.</page><page sequence="11">K.E. BRASHIER 169 efforts of Song antiquarians details how up to six of these local mountains brought prosperity to Yuanshi and were in turn officially recognized with sanctioned sacrifices. The tallest of these was the mountain of Fenglong h! twenty-five kilometers northwest of Yuanshi, and beside it was a much smaller mountain known as Baishi E=5 77 because of its white rock. Based on the inscriptions, Baishi Mountain was the last in the Yuanshi cluster to receive official sacrifices in the Han. Thus from merely iden tifying a mountain, to identifying five sacred mountains of the empire, to identifying hierarchies of mountains below the imperial peaks, the mental map becomes a veritable mental atlas. If one were to move from mental to monetary and trace out the system of financial support for these sacrifices, that system would duplicate these hierarchies. As Marianne Bujard has recently concluded, the Yuanshi cluster of inscriptions demonstrates that sacrifices to mountain deities could be financed by a combination of four different sources.24 First, individuals including petty officials could contribute to the sacrifices. Mountain and grave stelae often record their names and sometimes the amounts of their contributions on the rear of the stone. Second, the district or kingdom could finance them on their own initiative. Third, the imperial court could authorize the expenditure. The inscription dedicated to the mountain Wuji MM, also in the Yuanshi cluster, details how a request for official recognition rose up through local officials to the administration of the Changshan ^ [JL| kingdom and ultimately to the grand minister of ceremonies Chen Dan MM. (d. 185) and the secre tariat.25 Most of the inscription seems to replicate an official document, precisely dating each level of approval and noting how the claims about the mountain's efficacy were verified through interviewing the region's elderly and inspecting past records.26 Lastly, local associations connected with other spirit temples could band together and offer money to restore the shrine and continue the sacrifices. The Baishi Mountain inscription is the best example of this last source of funding. Prominently displayed on the back of the stele are four spirit contributors as follows: 24.

Ten thousand cash contribution of the Bi Spirit Lord (Bi shenjun yiqian yiwan —M) Commentators note that Wucheng is similar to the name of a nearby mountain and suggest that all of these names may refer to other mountain spirits.28 If such is the case, this list is evidence of yet another hierarchi cal layer underneath the officially recognized district mountains. Below these four contributions is a list of twenty-three individuals, almost all of them prefaced with either the title "libationer" (jijiu I* or "master of records" (zhubu ip|). As Nagata Hidemasa and others have noted, these Han titles had been adopted by the Celestial Masters, one of the earliest known Daoist religious traditions.29 Either the Celestial Masters were at work in the region of Yuanshi, or religious movements in general were borrowing Han bureaucratic titles. The stele's own history is unfortunately somewhat confused. At least as early as the transcriptions of Hong Gua (1167) in the Song Dynasty, some calligraphy scholars had argued that the stone was recarved early in the Period of Disunion, perhaps because the original shrine had burned down in the fourth century. Hong Gua located the stele in Zhending yfi ®, roughly halfway between Yuanshi and Wuji Mountain. Other sources 27. For yiqian itH meaning a donation of cash, see How Han shu, 58.1872. 28.

The stele stayed in Yuanshi into the twentieth century although it was buried during the Cultural Revolution to prevent it from being destroyed. Finally it was moved to a hall dedicated to Han stelae at Fenglong Mountain where it remains (see Figs.1-2, pp. 224-25). Fenglong Mountain is still the site of religious activity to this day.30 The six Yuanshi inscriptions should be viewed as a corpus of texts, in part justified by the fact that the same names of certain low-level government officials appear in several of them. There exists another small corpus of texts from the Western Marchmount, Hua Mountain |i[ in the modern province of Shaanxi. Beyond these two corpora, only a scattered handful of texts dedicated to individual mountains survives, bringing the total up to about twenty inscriptions, most of them dating from the second half of the second century c.e. Yet this number by no means reflects how many mountains were actually receiving sacrifices in the Han. It is noteworthy that the Han shu 3111 "Treatise on Geogra phy" lists approximately twenty major mountain sacrificial sites, most of which are not commemorated with surviving inscriptions, yet none of the Yuanshi mountains are mentioned in the treatise.31 Furthermore, references to several lost mountain inscriptions occur in the Shuijingzhu 7jtfS&amp; by Li Daoyuan (d. 527).32 Most mountains were probably left uriinscribed, and the extant texts survived more by chance than by design, often through inclusion in Song antiquarian collections such as the Li shi f|5f?

Rituals of Recompense According to the mountain inscriptions, anthropomorphized forces of nature date back to the very beginning of the cosmos. One of the stelae for Sangong Mountain [i|, also part of the Yuanshi corpus, begins with the qi M, "vapors" dividing into qian and kun ttfl, the Yi jing trigrams for heaven and earth respectively, and according to the inscription, these forces were respectively the "father" (fu $£) and "mother" (mu R}) of all matter.33 Yet compared to the sacrifice-receiving, prayer-hearing mountain forces, this level of anthropomorphizing is only metaphorical, a sup position supported by the fact that later the same inscription also dubs Prefect Feng Xun as "father and mother for the people" (ivei minfumu JU;$££5). One feature that distinguishes metaphor from anthropomor phized agency is human ritual reaction. For example, the inscription still later refers to the timely winds and rains from that mountain's "august numinosity" (huangling Jl.18) that in turn cause the people below to "respect and treat him as a guest" (jing er bin zhi ® MflE-i)-34 Consisting of a shrine and regular sacrifices, that ritual reaction moves the mountain entity beyond mere metaphor. Appropriately, the opening section of the Baishi Mountain stele is solely devoted to proper ritual treatment of such beneficial natural forces. The two-meter-high stele displays a large, raised-relief header in dis tinctive "seal script" (zhuan jfe) that proclaims "Stele to the Spirit Lord of Baishi Mountain" (Baishi shenjun bei The body of the text is written in "secretarial script" (li Ut) common to Han inscriptions. The orderly, grid-like distribution of characters on its face is divided into three sections, the first being ten columns of prose preface; the second, four columns of the hymn; and the third, two columns of "credits" listing the names of officials and stone masons associated with the stele's erection (Fig. 1).3S The preface begins as follows: 33. Hong Gua, Li shi, 3.15b ("Sangong shan bei"). 34. Hong Gua, Li shi, 3.17a ("Sangong shan bei").

The inscription both begins and ends with canonical precedents on ritual: at the beginning, prescriptions from the Ritual Records or Li ji fit 15, and at the end, descriptions of ritual from the Shi jing. The frequent reference to ritual highlights the fact that the stone is not merely labeling the mountain and identifying its spiritual entity. Instead, it immediately promotes ritual as the state's most important concern and then fixes mountains within the list of ritual dedicatees. Given that it includes a hymn dedicated to the mountain deity, the stele is itself part of the ritual procedures. In terms of reconciling agency- and system-oriented cosmologies, 11. 5-8 already offer one manner in which they partially merge, namely the automated nature of the exchange between deities and humans based on the idea of sacrificial bao fix "recompense." Addressing this idea via narratives in the Guo yu and Zuo Commentary or Zuo zhuan fefH, David Schaberg has recently written: [Established notions of bao in historiography legitimate the idea of return, at least in some of its forms. The problem under these circumstances is not to preserve the realm of freedom represented by the gift but to control the channels by which it is reciprocated and converted into other sorts of wealth. Liberality is perhaps not essential to a system of bao, since what is required is objective per formances of return rather than a subjective generosity on the part of participants. Yet a ghost of the freedom of the "free" gift hovers about the exchanges as an index of givers' and receivers' commitment to the ideal of giving and to the system of exchange itself.40 Thus a tension between a subjective agency capable of freely giving and a system that controls the channels of reciprocity is already inherent in this concept of recompense. In the exchange between mountains and humans, the human gifts of jade and food are a form of wealth converted into the mountain's return gift that usually consists of an abundance of rain (as will be seen in section III). Liberality indeed seems to be unimportant as the human gift is meager compared to that of the mountain. Even so, both humans and mountains express some degree of agency by freely choosing to commit themselves to the recompense system. 40. Schaberg, A Patterned Past, 209-10. Later (p. 214), Schaberg also writes that de ||j in the bao exchanges denotes the "material possession, the power to give, and the will ingness to be recognized publicly as giver." In 1.7 of the Baishi inscription, bao likewise functions in tandem with de, with the former manifesting the latter.</page><page sequence="17">K.E. BRASHIER 175 The theme of recompense is surprisingly common throughout most mountain inscriptions. On the human side of the exchange, the recipients of the mountain's benefits heed ritual protocol and government regula tions by engaging in formal sacrificial recompense. As the Wuji Mountain inscription explains: ifclHlllft If one respectfully examines the ritual doctrines And consults the surviving regulations from antiquity, SO ~T" R When achievements attend to the people, 'FTfix R It! Officials make recompense for their virtue.41 The Wuji inscription then describes how the sacrificial hall was enlarged and the sacrificial attendants multiplied to offer monthly libations and seasonal sacrifices using animals and jade. The theme of the government always responding to merit was not limited to the Yuanshi inscriptions; it was repeated at other mountains, both famous and obscure, across Han China. For example, a hymn from one of the Hua Mountain inscriptions claims that "The imperial mandate is not disobeyed, and every year the sacrifices recompense [the mountains's] achievements" (diming buwei, sui shi baogong fjf afiill ' Another inscription dedicated to Hua Mountain enumerates the recompensed achievements as the mountain's production of clouds and rain, its engendering the myriad things, and its circulating the ^/-vapors.42 Conversely, the mountain's own qualities of automated response were in turn praised. The Wuji Moutain hymn states: mWMUfi Whenever pleading prayers and entreating suppli cations are made, ■ • The response is quick and never delayed.... W 18 S? If there are prayers of exorcism, nj '\L- The recompensing response is certain.43 When describing how closely its response followed upon sacrificial supplication, the Sangong Mountain stele uses a common metaphor of automation and speed by stating "its recompense was like a shadow or an echo" (bao ru jingxiang f Ez §11 ft *§) ■44 In the Baishi Mountain inscription (11.31-32), the mountain's response is said to have come on the very day and hour a prayer was made. The theme occurs in the Hua Mountain inscriptions in the form: "Should there have been winds or droughts, 41. Hong Gua, Li shi, 3.21a ("Wuji shan bei").

Indeed, if they do not receive proper ritual attention, this may again disorder the harmony of the entire system. The performance of the proper sacrifice to a mountain spirit may be simultaneously regarded as "an act of religious piety" toward the spirit or as a "magical" act designed to maintain the geomantic harmony of the spatial world. By the same token, the spirits' reaction of anger at failure to perform the rites is itself an inevitable manifestation of a breakdown of an aspect of the system.46 That is, the spirits will conform to impersonal systems if the humans will, too. Therefore this exchange between spirits and human supplicants begins to lose its sense of independent agency on either side as the idea of recompense takes on automated and systematic overtones through ritual. Once both parties chose to play their designated roles, there was less of a contradiction between understanding the cosmos as filled by willful, hungry deities and understanding it as consisting of impersonal cyclic systems. As will be seen below, if the deity responded more auto matically, then the deity was more likely to enjoy promotion within the sacrificial schedules. 17 18 ' 19 - 20 ° 21 ' II.

These nine mountain sets are in turn reduced to "three ranges" (santiao Hf®) by plotting either their known or their speculative locations on a map.52 Specifically, the first through the fourth mountain sets (a-d) comprise the "northern range" (beitiao beginning in Shaanxi and terminating in the northern Gulf of Bohai. The fifth and sixth mountain sets (e-f) comprise the "middle range" (zhongtiao 41 IS), beginning in Gansu and, depending on the source, terminating in either Shandong or Hubei. The seventh and eighth mountain sets (g-h) comprise the "southern range" (nantiao beginning in Shaanxi and, again depending on the source, terminating in either Anhui or Hubei. The ninth mountain set (i) lists only one mountain and seems to be treated separately from the three ranges. Thus the three ranges generally begin from the same western region and then spread out like a crow's foot across China. Scholars such as Ban Gu ifE® (32-92),53 Ma Rong MBS (79-166),54 and Wang Su BEJfl? (195-256)55 all make reference to this macroscopic three-range vision of the empire's geography, and in addition to the reference in the Baishi Mountain inscription (11. 17-18), other mountain inscriptions likewise utilize it.56 50. Shang shu jinguwen zhushu, 183-85 ("Yu gong"); bracketed inclusion of the term jiushan ft, ill is based on Shiji, 2.67. 51.

BRASHIER 179 Thus the pan-China mountain ranges were conceived as a few prin cipal lines branching out from the west. From these principal lines came lesser peaks, collateral branches in the orological family tree. The notion of family and lineage is explicitly expressed in the mountain inscriptions. For example, the preface of the Fenglong Mountain inscription begins: ffl HI1 ULf As for Fenglong Mountain, it is the eminent assistant of the Northern March mount and a collateral spirit of the three ranges. After separating off its body and differentiating its location, ft it came to exist in this region.57 Human lineage terms are being modified, the phrase "spirits of collateral lineages" (bieshen replacing "sons of collateral lineages" (biezi JfJ'J -p-).58 Among the Yuanshi inscriptions, the Sangong Mountain inscription also refers to the peak as being a "collateral spirit of the three ranges" (santiao bieshen HfE^S'JW)-59 Furthermore, the Fenglong extract hints at parceling out the land along lineage divisions. As a collateral relative and not in the direct line of descent, Fenglong cannot inherit the land but must take possession of land in a different region, a fact noted in the last two lines cited above. Direct stewardship over the land that surrounds an individual mountain is a common feature in the mountain inscrip tions. Such territorial acquisition makes it easier to envision a family of mountains spreading its domain over the plains. The Baishi Mountain inscription also refers to the mountain's "body" being connected to Fenglong Mountain—by far the highest mountain in the Yuanshi cluster—and then states that its "gi-vapor connects to the Northern Marchmount" (11.21-22), phrases that again have clear lineage connotations.

They then tie the dedicatee to this genealogy by introducing him with a phrase such as "at birth this gentleman received a (/(-vapor and body that was pure and harmonious" (gong danshou chunhe zhi qiti {AWt SlMIO-ilRfi).60 In the mountain inscriptions, spatial concepts replace temporal ones so that while Baishi's body comes from its more proximate "parent," its qi-vapor extends much further to its own eminent ancestor, the Northern Marchmount. Like the three ranges, the Five Marchmounts themselves exhibit their own lineage relationships, usually privileging one marchmount as pro genitor to the rest. For example, one inscription identifies Hua Mountain as "second ancestor among the five overseers" (wuzhen cizong fl'M'X &gt;k), to which Zhang Qiao explains that Tai Mountain is the progenitor, leaving its directional opposite Hua Mountain in second position.61 The Eastern Han text Comprehensive Discourse on Customs or Fengsu tongyi M refers to Tai Mountain as "progenitor" (shi $f}), "elder" (zhang J|), and "ancestor" (zong th).62 Tai Mountain's privileged position is not surprising given the frequent references to it in the pre-Han and Han textual tradition and its location within the Classicist heartland. It was the site of the imperial /eng-sacrifices that secured cosmological legiti mation for the ruler's jurisdiction over the world, sacrifices that were thought to have stretched into the distant past. Yet during the Han, Tai Mountain had a growing rival for prestige in Song Mountain Si lli, the Central Marchmount in modern Henan Province. Whereas Tai Mountain had history, Song Mountain had symmetry because it was the center of the Five Marchmounts, and its importance grew over the course of the dynasty. En route to Tai Mountain in 110 b.c.e., Emperor Wu jS; (r. 141-87) visited Song Mountain and established a community there to ensure its sacrifices, and by 61 b.c.e., Emperor Xuan a had officially established the Five Marchmount system with Song Mountain at the center.63 With the 60.

In terms of lineage relationships, it eventually usurped the traditional role of Tai Mountain—also known as Dai tS or Daizong —as marchmount progenitor in the eyes of some writers. Soon after the Han, Guo Pu fflJjSi (276-324) wrote: Song Mountain is the ancestor of marchmounts— Hua, Dai, Heng and Heng. Its qi-vapors connect to the primal vastness; Its spirit pervades darkness and brightness. Majestically standing in the middle, It is the chief of the host of peaks.64 Instead of being connected to a still more preeminent mountain, the ultimate ancestor's qi-vapor continues backward (or upward) into the primal vastness itself—a connection that parallels the lineage structure, both in prescription and in practice. As an example of the prescription, Xunzi If] ^ advises, "Thus the king regards his grand ancestor as [on par with] heaven" (gu wangzhe tian taizu t^ iEvl^cjvffl).65 As an example of the practice, when Emperor Wu built his sacrificial Bright Hall Ej£j ^ in as sociation with the Tai Mountain/eng-sacrifice, he placed the Han founder, his ancestor Gaozu rSiffl, opposite the cosmological agents known as the Grand Unity jfc—■ and the Five Emperors S'ri?.66 If Song Mountain was thus the ultimate marchmount ancestor, its (//-vapors appropriately extended up into the cosmological realm. Regardless of whether the empire's geography was divided via three ranges or five marchmounts, the language of the mountain inscriptions indicates that the relationship net of mountains was conceived as either parallel to or an extension of lineage ties. The static peaks became a dynamic family. Once the mountain gods are "lineage-ized," their in dividual agency erodes and a sense of comprehensive systematization takes its place.

Yet the writer is here consciously choosing certain regions. The Yuanshi mountains were recognized as north China, and so from the perspective of Wuji Mountain, Zhongnan Mountain would be to the west, Daizong (a.k.a. Tai Mountain) to the east, and Yangyue to the south. The writer may have also intentionally chosen directional products. To protect the abundance of flora and fauna from over-extraction, the mountain inscriptions also refer to the traditional restrictions on cultivating these goods.74 The hymn to Sangong Mountain, for example, states the following: Yongzhou M#1 and is usually interpreted as two mountain names; see Shang shu jin guwen zhushu, 179. However, Hong Gua notes that in the Wuji Mountain inscription the compound dunwu %'l'ty] should be parallel to the pines, lacquer trees, and bamboo produced by other regions in the following lines, hence my translation as "accumu lated products" rather than as the name of a mountain.

Praying to mountains on behalf of the crops dates back to the oracle bones of the Shang Dynasty.80 At least by Zhou times, this benefit specifi cally took the form of mountains generating beneficial rains, an ability perceived as inherent in a mountain's nature. The Xunzi succinctly states, "Pile up earth to make a mountain, and the winds and rains will arise from it" (jituchengshan,fengyuxingyan ' Mffifl^).81 To Xunzi, the capacity to generate rain was simply a matter of geology, but to ritual anthologies such as the Li ji, mountain sacrifices were further required to induce these rains.82 The most important pre-imperial text on rainmaking that informs these mountain inscriptions is from the Gongyang Commentary or Gongyang zhuan in a passage on the wang-sachdce that expresses territorial sovereignty: ? nnm ° mnmm ? ° ? What are the three "vistas" (wang)? They are the vista sacrifices. If that is the case, then what sacrifices are they? They are to Tai Mountain, the Yellow River, and the ocean. 79. Shiji, 117.3070.

For example, the Great Commentary to the Veritable Documents or Shang shu dazhuan does not limit this degree of rainmaking coverage to Tai Mountain but credits all Five Marchmounts with the abil ity.84 The Fengsu tongyi seems to specify the Gongyang zhuan's "it" which strikes against the rocks as clouds in a statement that attempts to explain the origin of Tai Mountain's names: -amrn • is#' ° nvazth' mmzix»m One name [for Tai Mountain] is Daizong in which dai refers to "the progenitor" and zong refers to "the elder."

The explication of this ritual name for Tai Mountain is unclear. While zong can mean "elder," there is little evidence that dai meant anything other than a name for this mountain. The phonetic element of dai is dai {X, meaning "to substitute" or "to alternate," thus fitting the rest of the Fengsu tongyi's explanation in which yin and yang in their intercourse exchange places.

BRASHIER 187 Alternatively because that which follows "clouds" in the Chinese is the imbedded quotation from the Gongyang zhuan, clouds may simply be the topic of the sentence—that is, the resultant of the rocks being struck— and the "it" remains undefined. Other texts also associate clouds with mountains in the rainmaking process but in at least two different ways. For example, the fragmentary Primal Mandates of the Spring and Autumn Annals or Chunqiu yuanmingbao ® states: ' js/ra-ffil# ' 0 Mountains are containers for qi-vapors and are that which contain quintessence and hide away clouds. Therefore (the clouds) strike against the rocks and spread over the mountains.86 Here the clouds or qi-v apors are contained within the mountains and seem to pound upon the stones to get out.87 A Western Han memorial against excessive coinage even argues that, when extensive mining for The reason why (thefengshan sacrifice) must be carried out at Daizong is because it shows respect for the ancestor of the myriad things. Yin and yang in their in tercourse exchange places, strike against the rocks and emerge, enclosing every inch of space. Only Tai Mountain can spread rain all over the world before the morning is even finished. Based on the passage in "Shanze: Wuyue," Wu Shupingbelieves that the above passage must be garbled; but the Chunqiu yuanming bao states, "When yin and yang join, they become clouds" (yinyang ju wei yun |Hi§MMS); see Xu Jian Chuxueji (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1980), 14. For a third Fengsu tongyi citation of the passage about Tai Mountain and rain, see Fengsu tongyi jiaoshi, 305 ("Sidian: Yu shi" HBifi) Yin and yang are further associated with mountains because mountains are fixed points with a shady yin side to the north and a sunny yang side to the south. 86. Yiwen leiju, 121 ("Shan" (Jj). The Chunqiu fanlu provides a second example that states "The earth produces clouds that become rain and gives rise to qi-vapors that become the wind" (di chu yun wei yu, qi qi wei feng ttfltMS®)- In this example, it is significant that clouds and qi-vapors are regarded as separate, parallel substances. See Chunqiu fanlu yizheng, 316 ("Wuxing dui" HItH). For further discussion of many of these extracts on the nature of rain and clouds, see Tamura Sennosuke Chugoku kishogakushi kenkyu (Mishima: Chugoku kishogakushi kenkyu kankokai, 1977), vol.3,55-91,135-53. 87.

He writes: 0 : ' if \frfD-n » » ° J icLiiUKT ' /hOjffi-H ' ° ffi ' mmmmi»° ammm»mm ' wtams - ° The commentary to the Chunqiu states, "It strikes against the rocks and emerges, enclosing every inch of space. Only Tai Mountain can spread [rain] all over the world before the morning is even finished." Tai Mountain sends rain over the world, and a lesser mountain sends rain over a whole state. In each case, the distance of coverage is di rectly proportional to the mountain's size. As for rain emerging from the mountains, some say that clouds load up and then move out so that when the clouds dissipate, the water falls. The name (of this water) comes to be "rain." [However,] in general if there are clouds, then there is rain; if there is rain, then there are clouds. When it first exits [the mountains], it becomes clouds, and when the clouds drift downward, they become rain.90 Instead of mountains containing clouds, "some say" the clouds here are vehicles loading up with water from the mountains that is then trans ported away.91 Wang Chong instead argues that one does not contain the other but that both are the same substance in different states. Elsewhere he explicitly states that it is the mountain's qi-vapors that emerge to form clouds and later descend as rain.92 Other Han sources, such as the Basic Questions of the Yellow Emperor's Inner Canon or Huangdi neijing suzven Iflikewise affirm that the earth's qi-v apors ascend in the 88.

As metal nurtures water in the production cycle, the metal contained within the mountains gives rise to the rain clouds. Such a cor relation may already be evident in the earliest section of the Mountain and Sea Canon or Shanhai jing [i Jthat most scholars date to Warring States period. It describes one mountain as containing vast amounts of jade and metal, in turn producing vast amounts of clouds and rain.95 Much later, Ban Gu repeats this association in the following couplet from his "Poem on the Treasured Caldron" ("Baoding shi" The marchmounts present their tribute, and the rivers offer their treasure. They spit forth a metallic radiance and exhale floating clouds.96 Xu Shen (ca. 55-ca. 149) makes the correlations more explicit in his commentary to the Huainanzi, in a passage concerning the five-phase understanding of the body's organs. According to the Huainanzi, the human body reflects the cosmos; hence its organs correlate to celestial and meteorological phenomena—such as the gall bladder correlating to clouds. Xu Shen explains: "The gall bladder is the metal [phase]. Clouds are produced by metallic ore, which is why [the gall bladder] corresponds to clouds" (dan, jin ye, jinshi, yun zhi suo chu, gu wei yun fl® » jjj-tJI &gt; ^ 5 ' ' McMM)-97 Post-Han texts would further strengthen the tie between mountains rich in metallic ores and the production of clouds based on the five phases.98 93.

S),lno but most often they directly draw upon the Gongyangzhuan passage, making it the most common textual allusion in the mountain inscriptions.101 For example, it appears against a broader cosmological background in one of the Hua Mountain inscriptions: PI II It strikes the stones, giving rise to clouds, HfScJIiii and rains upon our agriculture and sericulture. SffSrm^J In provisioning the various categories of things, [Hua Mountain] indeed assists the Yaoguang star.102 The Yaoguang star is the last star in the Dipper's handle,103 the handle serving like the hour hand of a cosmic clock. At nightfall it indeed points in the direction said to govern the season, such as east in the spring and south in the summer, thus linking temporal and spatial cycles. The discussion of rainmaking abilities in the texts cited has been gener ally devoid of external agencies, and even though much of it originates with a Gongyang zhuan passage on sacrifice, it instead highlights the c/i-oriented understanding of a cyclic cosmos. Wang Chong even asks, "How could the q;-vapors of clouds and rains be pleased with sacrificial offerings?

BRASHIER 191 making capacity, there is a potential for an anthropomorphic element to creep in, in part due to the vagueness of the terms used to describe the mechanics. For example, shen If can mean either "spiritual" in the sense of a heightened state of clarity and efficacy, or it can mean "spirit" in the sense of a ghostly being. For the first sense, I would cite a Li ji passage that emphasizes the mechanical, impartial quality of the cosmos and uses the case of mountains producing rain as an example of automated natural cycles. It repeatedly uses the term shen in association with the qz-vapors produced by earth that become wind and thunder, that in turn wake up the torpid world.105 As an example of the second sense, there are several versions in verse of the legends of the Chu king's search for a seductive mountain goddess, in which the concept of mountains producing rain and the use of the terms shen and ^(-vapors are prominent. Perhaps the best-known composition is the "Poetic Exposition on Gaotang" or "Gao tang fu" jUi/if M/ attributed to Song Yu5f5iE (third century b.c.e.) but most likely of Han date. It begins with the king of Chu and Song Yu sighting the "cloudy qi-vapors" (yunqi ft fa) above the mountain, prompting Song Yu to identify the qi- vapors as a goddess and to relate the tale of the maiden of Shaman Mountain M [i|. The maiden even identifies herself by saying, "At dawn I am the morning clouds; at dusk I am the driving rain" (dan wei zhaoyun, mu wei xingyu ' UflfTMl)- Having caught the king's eye, this spirit receives her own sacrificial shrine.106 It may have been the vagueness of key terms such as shen and ^'-vapors that facilitated the anthropomorphization of the elements of rain production.107 105. Lijijijie, 1278 ("Kongzi xianju" JL~F WS)- For discussion of the passage, see p. 204 below. For a second example using shen in a mountain's rainmaking capacity, see Jiao shi Yi lin, 161 ("Dazhuang: dui"), which cites the Gongyang zhuan locus classicus and ascribes this ability to Song Mountain and Tai Mountain, commenting that "their peaks are upright and spiritual" (jun zhi qie shen ). 106.

The kingdom is Changshan, and the district is Yuanshi. 109. I follow Nagata's punctuation that differs from Gao Wen and Yuan Weichun, who place qu at the end of the previous phrase. Their reading may imply the spirits of the mountains come to receive the sacrifice and then "withdraw." Nagata's punctuation simply renders the qu as an indication of past action. "Formal" (fa ;£) is here used in the sense of "formulaic." According to Shi ji, 99.2723, and Han shu, 43.2128, when Shusun Tong (fl. early second century b.c.e.) orchestrated the first ritual reverence of the Han emperor, the ceremony ended with the fajiu ;£ ?IS or "formal drinking of alcohol" in which everyone came forward in order of rank, bowed his head to the floor and toasted Gaozu jfjffl.. Nagata believes that the term fashi is akin to fajiu. 110.

Han court discourse also employed precedents but called them bi or bilei \XM.- See Yu Yue Du Han bei M'MW (in Shike shiliao xinbian, vol. 3.2,593), 25.10a. 113. As Nagata notes, jingyong 8 ffj means "regular expenses" in other Han texts such as Han shu, 24.1159. As the imperial court sanctioned the sacrifice, this statement may mean that the district merely oversaw the distribution of funds. 114. In addition to food offerings, gifts of jade tablets and disks are most frequently mentioned in the mountain inscriptions and elsewhere. The inscriptions refer to jade sacrifices on par with those of Tai Mountain, to jade being buried, and to jade being presented to either the mountain itself or the "thearchs on high" (shangdi _bW)- See Yuan Weichun, Qitt Han bei shu, 284 ("Xiyue Hua shan miaobei" S^^|i|)li5$), 255 ("Fenglong shan song"); Hong Gua, Li shi, 2.12b ("Tongbo Huai yuan miaobei" ?®i!5¥); Han shu, 6.204. According to the Huainanzi, offering jade coincides with land fertility, fertility that would presumably include timely rains; so as not to damage the qi-vapors of growth, the offering of jade was substituted for the killing of animals. See Huainan honglie jijie, 162-63 ("Shi ze" flfl'J). Jade of course originates in the mountains, so sacrificing jade could be regarded as an exchange. Sometimes the exchange is even nullified. Two Hua Mountain inscriptions draw upon the famous case in which the mountain actually returned the jade, refusing to recognize Qin Emperor Shihuang J| Ji -Sf as a legitimate sovereign any longer.

Turning to the Hua Mountain corpus for comparison, in scription readers encounter an implicit history of waxing and waning mountain reverence that lingers behind all these late Eastern Han texts. Emperor Wu had once built an elaborate complex on Hua Mountain's slopes with lodgings named "Palace for the Gathering of Numinous Beings" (Jiling gong M 'S'), "Terrace for Retaining the Immortals" (Cunxian dian and "Gate for Carrying Out Vista Sacrifices to the Immortals" (Wangxian men if fill H )-116 One inscription not only refers to the construction of these lodgings but vividly describes the human visitors as well: not - ' 'fir - TO® ' Sctil ° Shizong [i.e. Emperor Wu] also laid out the Palace for Gathering Numinous Beings down below, thinking of that clique that includes [the tran scendents] Wangzi Qiao and Chi Songzi who roam and who rest. The magicians of the commanderies and kingdoms came from afar, crowding the cliffs and packing the precipices. Shamans and shamankas from the villages and cities carried out reverential sacrifices in its midst, filling the valleys and over flowing the gullies.117 They all possessed mindsets bent on floating and whirling away as well as appearances that were joyful and content. If the road of clouds and mists can be ascended and transcended, then abundant, glorious blessings can be caused to descend and arrive.118 116. Yuan Weichun, Qin Han bei shu, 280-81 ("Xiyue Hua shan miaobei"). The three structures are also listed in the "Poetic Exposition on Immortals" ("Xian fu" fill IS) by Huan Tan flff (ca. 43 b.c.e.-28 c.e.); see Fei Zhen'gang ff Hu Shuangbao fifjltlf and ZongMinghua tkMIP, Quart Hanfuj&amp;'/IiSR (Beijing: Beijing daxue, 1993), 248.

BRASHIER 195 Thus on one hand, Hua Mountain was the destination of shamans and magicians who left their mundane realm of commanderies and kingdoms, villages and cities, to come to this place of separation, this peak where the world could be transcended. On the other hand, Hua Mountain was the place where, as the same inscription later states, "all the spirits become inebriated" (shen ju zuizhi J=L®?ih),119 having left their own extramundane realm to drink and dine in imperial lodgings. Judging from the names of the buildings and Emperor Wu's legendary pursuits of transcendents such as Wang Ziqiao and Chi Songzi, the focus here seems to be on spirits as free agents and not on automated cycles that governed the cosmos. Yet Emperor Wu's lavish attentions did not last. Several Hua Mountain inscriptions indicate a general decline in its fortunes culminating in Wang Mang's I# interregnum when proper ritual respect for mountains col lapsed. One stele laments that once Han rule had "broken in the middle" (zhongque the shrines gradually toppled, the altar grounds became overgrown with weeds, and the rituals suffered many lacunae.120 Not until more recent times were such fortunes reversed: m&amp;m' mtte? &gt; mmmmm ° xmnn &gt; mm m - ° mmmmm &gt; zmigm • m inscriptions also depict the ascent of Hua and Tai mountains, the subsequent meeting with immortals, and the possibility of ascending into heaven itself.

Zhang Qiao, Guwen yuan, 408 ("Xiyue Hua shan tangque beiming"), in turn citing Mao Shi zhengyi, 469 ("Chu ci" If ;5S). 120. Although the inscriptions typically vilify Wang Mang as a ruler who destroyed the rituals, the historical records tell a different tale. When the treatise on ritual in the Hou Han shu describes ceremonies such as announcements made to heaven, suburban sacrifices, and welcoming the seasonal iji-vapors, it repeatedly states they accorded with "the former affairs in the Yuanshi reign period" (yi Yuanshi zhong gushi VAftin That reign period from 1 to 6 c.E. was in fact Wang Mang's own regency. For examples, see Hou Han shu, zhi 35, 9.3157, 3181 (twice), 3184, 3194. B.J. Mansvelt Beck concluded that, "the influence of Wang Mang on Later Han sacrifices is so deep that it would seem better to group him with the latter dynasty, instead of regarding his reign as the last phase of Earlier Han." See Mansvelt Beck, The Treatises of Later Han: Their Author, Sources, Contents and Place in Chinese Historiography (Leiden: E.J. Brill, 1990), 105. Furthermore, Guangwu's list of prophetic omens inscribed on the side of Tai Mountain—omens indicating his rise to power—echoes Wang Mang's own list of omens that he himself published upon becoming emperor. It was also Wang Mang who began the practice of recognizing multiple zu ^.-ancestors or progenitors within the same lineage, a practice continued in the Eastern Han. Although Eastern Han scholars, court officials, and mountain inscribers could not bring themselves to credit him, they clearly continued significant portions of his ritual program.

As for the locality of the altar ground, what had been overgrown was redeveloped, and as for the rituals, what had been cast aside was resurrected. He also constructed a sacrificial hall, marking it off with tripled qwe-pillars,122 and at the end of a spirit path, the guan-gate he established was imposingly beautiful and greatly towering.123 Only then was there a regular place for those who traveled here to sacrifice and make requests through prayer. Even when rain soaks one's clothes, the rituals are not cast aside.124 Thereupon the men and women of the town all proclaimed it to be appropriate. They then erected a stele and inscribed the stone to pass down a proclamation [of this achievement] to future generations.125 This sense of restoration is echoed by other inscriptions atop other moun tains. Some detail how fourteen stone turtles now lined the road126 or how the auspicious ground, selected through divination, now governed eastward.127 Cramped, collapsing abstention halls were expanded, and on them the renovators "depicted precious rarities and painted wondrous animals" (tu zhenqi, hua guaishou » ilfllPi).128 Long-begrimed ritual vessels and abstention apparel were replaced.129 One stele even recognized itself as superseding its indecipherable predecessor.130 Thus 121.

BRASHIER 197 many mountain inscriptions, including those of the Yuanshi corpus, pres ent themselves as marking a revival of respect for the mountain spirits. The form that revival took—officially ranking Baishi Mountain within a sacrificial schedule—alludes to another way in which mountain deities were pigeonholed into anthropomorphic systems, namely the assign ment of a bureaucratic position. The oft-cited locus classicus for bestowing hierarchical grades upon the mountains is the "Doctrine of Yao" or "Yao dian" fSiiii which recounts that the sage king Shun in his progress to Tai Mountain "placed vista (sacrifice) ranks upon the mountains and rivers" (wangzhi yu shanchuan |JL|) 11).131 One way in which such rankings were put into practice was by delineating sacrificial responsibility. The Historical Records or Shi ji ifelE and the Li ji's "Royal regulations" or "Wang zhi" 3iftJ reserve the "celebrated mountains and major rivers" (mingshan dachuan ill jzl [ [) for the son of heaven alone, and they were never to be given over to the feudal lords.132 The Shang shu dazhuan limits these "celebrated mountains" to the Five Marchmounts,133 and in 122 b.c.e., Emperor Wu indeed withdrew two marchmounts from the king doms so that all five were attached to commanderies (jun §[i) under his direct control.134 Yet at least in the Eastern Han, the traditional vista sacrifices were apparently carried out at the district level (xian ff) and not at the larger commandery level. If the commanderies wanted to per form the sacrifices, the Extended Reflections or Shenjian E{3 H by Xun Yue IjjfQ; (148-209) advised that such sacrifices should be frugal, carried out in times of peace, and intended only to demonstrate imperial all-inclu siveness to the people.135 As for lesser peaks, the "Wang zhi" stipulates that their sacrifices came from the feudal lords, and the Fengsu tongyi indicates the level of those sacrifices by stating, "As for the rest, some are equal to earls and others to viscounts and barons, all depending upon their size" (qiyu huo bo huo zinan, daxiao wei cha f§ » ^H).136 Anecdotes in the Zuo zhuan indicate that these distinctions were 165 c.E., and its role as a replacement for the earlier, worn away stele further suggests a longer tradition of mountain inscriptions. 131.

Not surprisingly, the authors of the Eastern Han mountain inscription corpus make full use of these classical precedents, and they also elabo rate upon them. In terms of the most highly ranked mountains, the Hua Mountain inscriptions vaunt its status as Western Marchmount, noting that "its sacrifices are equal to the three excellencies" (ji shi sangong |pr II £ fi), that is, the three highest officials of the empire.138 In terms of lesser mountains, an inscription at Tongbo Mountain states: aM In times of disaster or adversity, reports are [here] made; Tk^P-elf ^ In times of flood and drought, entreating petitions are [here] presented. It ranks among the feudal lords.139 This inscription significantly helps to explain why mountains were given feudal ranks. In essence, they paralleled human courts, listening to pleas and administering remedies, adjusting natural phenomena just as a feu dal lord might adjust taxes and conscripted service.140 Against this background, the sacrificers at Baishi Mountain here suc cessfully secured official status complete with official stipend for their deity by relying upon the precedence of neighboring mountains—specifi cally that of Wuji Mountain—and upon its own proven record in answer ing supplications. In other words, these mountains achieved their status within the official hierarchy and inclusion in the "ritual rankings" (lizhi Hlf£) of "formal sacrifices" (fashi through a bureaucratic process. 137.

For a brief but excellent general discussion on slotting cosmic forces into a bu reaucratic structure, see Schwartz, The World of Thought in Ancient China, 372-74. Yet as previously noted, because Schwartz does not deal with specific texts, the mechanics of the bureaucratic structure are not fully developed. In essence, the mountain bureaucratic structure was not simply a handy paradigm that reconciled two extreme perspectives. It also functioned like a bureaucracy, hearing pleas (i.e. prayers) and issuing disburse ments (i.e. rain). In terms of the mountain lineage discussed in section II, the physical pattern of greater and lesser mountain ranges indeed resembled an actual family tree. In other words, there were concrete circumstances that made the resolution of systems more palatable and ensured each paradigm's survival. These necessary concrete cir cumstances that gave the paradigms their staying power are only evident when looking at specific cases and texts.</page><page sequence="41">K.E. BRASHIER 199 This mountain god not only occupies a position within a lineage system, he also is ranked within a bureaucratic system—a rank defined through sacrificial ritual—because he plays his automated role so well. Because he himself is systematic, he becomes systematized.141 As already seen in 11. 19-20, Baishi Mountain also "obtained the title of general and wields the grandeur of battleaxes and halberds." The sharp weapons may allude to the peaks themselves, and his title of "gen eral"—along with his subordinate position below the Northern March mount—seems to fit this bureaucratic ranking of nature. Nor is this title merely a passing image. In 354 c.e., a single line in smaller characters was appended to the far left of the stele face, its text tentatively translated as follows: Mikffi'M ° On the tenth day of the first month of the third year in the [Former] Yan's Yuanxi reign period, the followers of the Master of Records Cheng Ci will transmit the doctrines of General Baishi. On this day our sacrificial hall was burned down by fire.142 The content of "the doctrines of General Baishi" is unclear; it may sim ply be a promise to continue the mountain cult even though the shrine had just burned down. Regardless, this bit of graffiti143 indicates that the mountain's particular title continued to be recognized. 141. For a thorough study on how the Yuanshi mountains secured official recognition through a process of submitted request, official inquiry, and then imperial decree, see Bujard, "Celebration et Promotion des Cultes Locaux," 247-66. Bujard describes how local cults and administrative officials interacted, even to the point that officials may have endeavored to associate themselves with the up-and-coming cults. The merged influence of canonically trained officials and mountain deity cults is evident in the stele rhetoric. 142. Yuan Weichun, Qin Han beishu, 520 ("Baishi shenjun bei").

BRASHIER 201 69 ° And the kingdom's territory was at peace.150 To recapitulate the content of this commentary to the Baishan Moun tain inscription to this point, section I highlighted the concept of the automatic "recompense" (bao) ideally carried out by both the mountain spirits and the human sacrificers. Both sides of the exchange became jointly systematized through ritual. Section II showed that the lineage paradigm reduced the free agency of mountain spirits; that is, instead of being above mundane systems, the spirits were components within a relationship network. Focusing on the rainmaking capabilities of moun tains, section III was mostly given over to the mechanics of c/z'-vapors, clouds, and rain and would seem to fit well a correlative understanding of the cosmos. Yet even here, the rainmaking capacity became anthro pomorphized into heavenly officials and seductive goddesses. Section IV suggested that, like the lineage paradigm, a paradigm of bureaucratic hierarchy overlay the natural world because it was another means to have individual agents functioning within systems. The contrasting conceptions of "a universe overseen by external agen cies and that consisting of resonating cycles" (see above, p. 163) emerge most strikingly in the Baishi Mountain inscription in section V, which relies heavily on citations and sets the two perspectives side-by-side. It could be reasonably argued that the penchant for excessive citation common in such inscriptions provided a self-fulfilling rationale that out weighed the desire to proffer a unified vision of how the cosmos worked. However, other inscriptions place the concept of feeding hungry spirits ed. Michael Loewe and Denis Twitchett (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), 590. Eastern Han grain prices seem to have been somewhat lower, estimated at sixty to seventy cash per shi. See Cho-yun Hsu, Han Agriculture, 71-72. Several commentators debate whether sheng Jf (a measure one-hundredth of a shi) should be read as dou if (a measure one-tenth of a shi) in this and another similar moun tain inscription. If the character were left as sheng, this inscription would be praising a far-too-high price of five hundred cash per shi in a year when the grain supply was high and the price thus low. If the character were read as dou, the resulting price of fifty cash per shi would be lower than average Eastern Han grain prices but not significantly so. Yet if sheng is to be read as a different character similar in appearance, then perhaps it should instead be read as zhi 3§ "to reach to." This reading may be justified by the Fenglong Mountain inscription that states su zhi san qian HMHit "the grain reached a price of three cash," the implied measure being the standard shi. This grain price would equal the low prices of prosperous years in the Western Han, and it would fit the boastful tone of this and other mountain inscriptions. 150.

For example, a Hua Mountain inscription praises the Han founder for "resonating with the cycles" (yingyun jffijS) when he sacrificed, and in the next line it condemns Wang Mang's insolence that caused "the ghosts and spirits to not accept his sacrifices" (guishen bu heng I?).151 Similarly, the Tongbo Mountain inscription describes the earlier abandonment of the shrine and the decline of its spirit sacrifices, after which "disaster and calamity thereupon arose and the yinyang thereupon became excessive" (zaishengyi xing, yinyangyi te #tilf Jiiffi &gt; In all these cases, the resonating cycles of yinyang are placed alongside the feeding of spiritual beings. Yet Han texts generally do not offer an explicit account of the link between well-fed spirits and properly resonating natural forces. To be blunt, the precise mechanics will continue to elude us, but by consider ing the role of ritual as well as the effects of the lineage and bureaucratic paradigms, we may get as close as reasonably possible. Together these systems formed a common ground or compromise position between a godly existence over and above the mundane (as in the West) on one side and the mindless automated cycles of yinyang and the five phases on the other. To be sure, "compromise" is misleading and suggests there existed some kind of conscious negotiation to resolve a recognized tension. It is more likely that, because of the existence of this middle position in which free agency is to some degree ritually subsumed into larger systems, any such question of inconsistency rarely arose. Rain sacrifices are of interest in that they were an undertaking that indeed raised specific questions of inconsistency. Xunzi was unequivocal in stating that the sacrifice was only the ruler's expression of concern or a cultural "embellishment" (wen JQ and not a matter of "spirits" (shen as the commoners regarded it.153 Wang Chong's position was more complicated. Because he understood the cosmos in terms of the "cycling qi-vapors" (yunqi JR) of yin and yang, he also denied that prayers and sacrifices to spirits had any effect on rain. He furthermore dismissed his torical cases in which rulers sought rain by attempting to rectify personal faults or by carrying out geomantic acts such as moving the location of marketplaces. He concluded that heaven was too distant to show such mindful concern for humans.154 Even so, a resonance cosmos still allowed humans some leeway. He defended the construction of clay dragons because dragons and rain were of the same "category" (lei H) and could 151. Hong Gua, Li shi, 2.8a ("Fan Yi xiu Hua yue bei"). 152.

There jing shan refers to Jing Mountain in Henan where the Shang capital was located.

The Qin Emperor Shihuang's inscriptions record the merits of China's unifier. Writ ten in tetrasyllabic verse, they serve as Classicist-influenced banners of imperial merit, not only praising territorial unity but also enhancing it by their very presence on the eastern mountains, far from the western capital of Xianyang. For example in 212 b.c.e. when the emperor erected a stone at the edge of the Eastern Sea, "he regarded it as the eastern gate of the Qin" (yiwei Qin dongmen see Shiji 6.256. While it is unknown whether he inscribed that stone, three years earlier he inscribed another "gate" at Jieshi {§that was also located along the sea; see Shi ji, 6.251. The erected stones seem to mark out the edges of territoriality and may be akin to the territoriality expressed in the fengshan sacrifices and inscriptions at Tai Mountain.

The most thorough study on the elements and interpretations of the Western Han feng-sacrifice is that of Mark Edward Lewis, "The Feng and Shan Sacrifices of Emperor Wu of the Han," 50-80. More recently, see Michael J. Puett, The Ambivalence of Creation: Debates Concerning Innovation and Artifice in Early China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2001), 170-75, 202-6. Among the Han interpretations, the feng jt} "enfeoffment" may have been a cosmological enfeoffment process as the sacrificing emperor "obtains" (de f#) the feng "fief." See Shi ji, 28.1367. At least in terms of the Qin sacrifice, Kern, The Stele Inscriptions of Ch'in Shih-huang, 112nl26, likewise suggests interpreting the feng sacrifice as the reception of a fief from heaven. The fengshan rituals were based on sacrifices to the Earth Lord, and officials in the secondary ceremony of "handing over" (shan iff) sometimes sacrificed directly to the five directional emperors. It was generally carried out in times of strong territorial unification and specifically on impe rial inspection tours. As noted above, the/eng-mounds were also erected to mark new lands seized during Han campaigns. Adding to these studies that draw attention to the shared terminology as well as the shared territorial implications, one might note that the feng- mound sacrifice and the enfeoffment process both used the same specific symbols such as the usage of sacred soil. In the enfeoffments primary ceremony, the territorial recipient obtained one of five colors of soil appropriate to the direction of his fief. Thus if a new fief holder received his land in the east, he took blue soil, if his fief was in the south, he took red soil, and so forth. He then returned home and mixed it into his own "altar to the land" (she ifi) in a secondary ceremony. For a blue-soil enfeoffment, a red-soil enfeoffment, and a case of mixing the soil into the home altar's mound, see Shiji, 60.2111-15. For a general description, see Baihu tong shuzheng, 91-92 ("Sheji" ifi®); and Cai zhonglang waiji, 4.23b-24a ("Du duan" ffiiSf). See also Brashier, "Breaking the Ties between Land and Religion in the Western Han (202 b.c.e.-9 c.e.)," Bulletin of the British Association for Chinese Studies 1996,20-30. (As for the colors, it may not be a coincidence that the five soil colors are the three primary pigments and two neutral pigments from which all other colors are derived.) Similarly, after Emperor Wu carried out the primary ceremony atop Tai Mountain, he observed a secondary sacrifice below (i.e. the shan) in which "soil of the five colors was amply mixed into a/eng-mound" (wuse tu yizafeng H). See Shi ji, 28.1398. The mixing of the colored soils seems to imply the emperor had received the territory of all directions, not just one. Other ritual similarities include annual timing.

The origins of the sacrifice are un clear, although it has been recently argued that Qin Emperor Shihuang "might have created the very tradition that he purported to revive."167 When Sima Xiangru encouraged Han Emperor Wu to perform such a sacrifice, the poet vaunted the Han's flood-like virtue that swept far and wide to wash over the distant corners of the world until the emperor's favor reached down to the insects.168 Those past rulers who had carried out the /eng-sacrifice, he argued, "engraved their achievements on the middle peak in order to make manifest their perfected respectability,169 to unfurl their abundant virtue, to extend the luster of their names, and to receive generous blessings with which to immerse the people" (le gong zhongyue, yi zhang zhizun, shu shengde, fa haorong, shou houfu, yi jin limin ye mjj &lt;pm' &lt; i If their identities had not been engraved on Tai Mountain, their names would have been lost to antiquity, "confusedly tangled up, sunk away and never spoken" (fenlunweiruiyinmieerbuchengffltfffisMM ' enfeoffment ideally took place at the beginning of summer when yang forces were waxing.

Sima Xiangru here identifies Tai Mountain as a "central marchmount" (zhongyue tfj lii), but he may be using a different order of magnitude than the system of Five Marchmounts within China proper. For example, contemporaneous sources such as the Huainanzi identify Tai Mountain as producing the "beauties of the middle" (zhongyang zhi mei when compared to the world mountains that mark the ends of the earth and serve as the "gates" (men PI) to the realm of light and dark beyond.

Sacrificial tradition long disap proved of proxies offering up sacrifices. Confucius famously stipulated, "If I do not offer up the sacrifice, it is as if there were no sacrifice" (zvu bu yuji, rubuji^^f^^ ' interpreted in the Han as a dismissal of sacri fice by proxy.177 In the Guo yu's account of the origins of sacrifice, particular specialists were responsible for making offerings to all the spirits—includ ing the mountain spirits—but when the people wrongly took those offer ings upon themselves, they ceased to bring the desired results.178 These mountain inscriptions continue that denunciation of sacrifice by proxy, such as a Hua Mountain stele that states, "By imperial mandate when sacrifices are offered up, one attends in person" (zhaoshu fengci, gongqin zi wang ' Jf§H § t£).179 The inscription at Tongbo Mountain describes how in the past the grand master of ceremonies ordered the commandary administrator to carry out the regular sacrifices, which he did in person, but over time he wrongfully delegated that responsibility to underlings. The sacrifices became cursory and disrespectful, the spirits ceased to enjoy them, and regional disasters subsequently arose.180 In addition to formally authorizing the sacrifice, the stele inscriptions marked the presence of the human powers who oversaw the territory. Those executed by Qin Emperor Shihuang or by Han emperors erecting /eng-mounds clearly denoted the imperial presence. In a similar manner, some of the late Eastern Han mountain inscriptions take the form of the actual bureaucratic documents that mandated the shrine's restoration and subsequent sacrifices. Others like that of Baishi Mountain relate the story of their official recognition in association with regional precedents. At least by this era, being in the presence of mandates of the ruler could be equated to being in the presence of the ruler himself, even to the extent of necessitating obeisance before his written mandates.181 The presence of a ruler or donor at least through physical words may have been neces sary lest the sacrifices be considered void by the absence of the principal sacrificer. That is, some of these mountain stelae may be more than re cords and more than official seals of approval; they may have served as the sacrificing agent himself whether it be a regional official or a private 177.

As noted above, the officials responsible for the Baishi Mountain sacrifice are listed to the left of the inscription, and the donors are listed on the reverse of the stele. Thus in terms of an exchange between spirits and humans, the inscription may have ensured that the latter were at least formally present in mandate and name. Yet this interpretation is merely a speculation, and the stelae clearly played multiple roles, another of which will be detailed below. VII.

Thus in terms of both medium and message, the inscription's hymn is first-order liturgy, part of the 83 vimw 84 El 85 182. Given the name of the mountain, this couplet may be a subtle reference to Shi jing, "Yang zhi shui" which states, "Among the turbulent waters, the white rocks are so glistening" (yang zhi shui, baishi haohao see Mao Shi zhengyi, 362. 183.

The praise in the opening lines is similar to that of other mountain hymns in the Yuanshi corpus and beyond. Compare these opening cou plets with those of Fenglong Mountain—the tallest among the inscribed Yuanshi mountains: As for "Heaven's setting upright the lofty mountains/'186 This was truly the case with Fenglong Mountain.187 The level earth ascended vertically; Its numinous brightness penetrated upward.

In terms of mountain formation, other inscriptions cite the "Xici" if? and "Shuogua" of the Yijing (Zhou yijijie, 531,690), that state mountains spread forth their ^'-vapors once qian and kun settled their positions (e.g. Yuan Weichun, Qin Han beishu, 278 ["Xiyua Hua shan miaobei"]; Hong Gua, Li shi, 2.14a ["Yao keng junshen cibei"]).

WangLiqi (Beijing: Zhonghua, 1996), 6 ("Dao ji" jB|t). One Han hymn credits intentional, spiritual origins to the mountains, attributing to Confucius the statement, "Mountains and rivers are established by the spirits and earth spirits" (shanchuan shenqi li l_L| j 11 flijijj; tL)', see Chunqiu fanlu yizheng, 423 ("Shanchuan song" |Jj j 11 IS). 188.

BRASHIER 211 Few of these laudatory hymns do not depict their dedicatees as "lofty," "edifying" or "on par with heaven," and such language could be easily dismissed as hackneyed. A modern reader might assume that mountains are by definition lofty, heaven-mated, and worthy of respect. Yet such need not have been the case. According to Donald Holzman, Han poets seldom regarded mountains as objects in their own right and instead con sidered them hostile and distant, rarely to be depicted in a good light.190 Likewise, Han period Buddhist texts offered a new Indian perspective of mountains, as in the account of paradise in the Aksobhya Buddha Land Sutra: - t° This land is level and produces trees in an orderly fashion. There are no high and low. There are no mountains and tumuli, gorges and valleys. There are also no crumbled rocks and collapsed moun tains.191 In the Period of Disunion, Buddhist texts such as the Lotus Sutra and the Pure Land Sutra continued to highlight orderly paradises devoid of mountains,192 an ideal flatness that also carried over into Buddhist influenced Lingbao Daoism.193 Clearly the qualities of majesty or hostility 190. Holzman, Landscape Appreciation in Ancient and Early Medieval China, 46-47. Holzman attributes the change toward a positive view of mountains to a gradual turn away from classicist ritualism and court politics to "a new period of more disengaged thought, of the cultivation of personal morality outside of society" (p. 66). 191.

Drawing from the Vimalakiirtinirdesa, Paul Williams notes that such earthly imperfections as mountains were regarded as mental imperfections, a concept that became crucial to East Asian Buddhism. He writes: This impure Buddha Field is indeed the Pure Land. It only appears impure because of the minds of sentient beings dwelling in it. If there are mountains in this world, and all is flat in the Pure Land, that is because there are mountains in the mind! See Williams, Mahay ana Buddhism: The Doctrinal Foundations (London: Routledge, 1999), 227. 193. Even from a more distant European perspective, this desire for perfect, mountain free symmetry finds parallels in traditions that lamented the loss of God's completely spherical, regular and solid earth that had existed prior to the Adamic Fall. In her study of changing aesthetic perspectives in the eighteenth century, Marjorie Nicolson, Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory, 62, summarizes this hostility as follows:</page><page sequence="54">212 FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE YINYANG attributed to mountains are the product of the backgrounds of those view ing them, not intrinsic characteristics of the mountains themselves. With what lens did the hymn writers of the mountain inscriptions view their mountain subjects? In terms of the verse medium, the tetrasyllabic lines evoke the Shijing; and contemporaneous grave stele inscriptions not only share the same format as the mountain inscriptions, they explicitly and repeatedly credit the Shi jing as their model. In terms of specific content, the Fenglong hymn opens with the first line of a Shijing hymn entitled "Heaven's Setting Upright" or "Tian zuo" a line that im mediately anchors the hymn with a canonical reference point by which to position Fenglong Mountain. In the Baishi Mountain inscription, 11. 79-80 most likely allude to the opening couplets of the poem "Songgao" M i§i in the Shijing, a poem that praises two major supporters of the Zhou court: In Songgao's role as marchmount, Its great axis extends into the heavens. This marchmount sent down its spirit, Causing the births of [the marquis of] Fu and [the earl of] Shen.194 Thus the mountain hymns are slotting the physical landscape into a tex tual infrastructure. What was geographically "other" is being assimilated into established convention. (Section VIII addresses the implications of this assimilation.) Mountains were warts, blisters, imposthumes, when they were not the rubbish of the earth, swept away by the careful housewife Nature—waste places of the world, with Little meaning and less charm for men who crossed the Alps only to reach the plains. The rise of mountains was variously attributed to the Adamic Fall, to Abel's slaying of Cain, or to Noah's flood. Mountains reflected human sin, and in the eyes of some theologians such as Luther, the earth was becoming more mountainous as humans were becoming more sinful. Compare the Fenglong hymn's praise of heaven drawing up the mountains with the following extract from John Donne written in 1611 as discussed in Nicolson, Mountain Gloom and Mountain Glory, 28, 76: But keeps the earth her round proportion still? Doth not a Tenarif, or higher Hill Rise so high like a Rocke, that one might thinke The floating Moone would shipwrack there, and sinke? ... Are these but warts, and pock-holes in the face Of th' earth? Thinke so: but yet confesse, in this The worlds proportion disfigured is. 194.

Confucius noted that the benevolent associate with mountains because mountains epitomize stillness and longevity.196 The step from a correlative and as sociative relationship to an interconnected relationship was not a long one, and many early texts draw causal links between geography and personality.197 Specifically in terms of mountains, the Shijing's "Songgao" becomes the locus classicus for an interconnected relationship between lofty peaks and a nobility in human nature. As stated in one of the in scriptions dedicated to Hua Mountain: wmzm ' ft' oafrMM ° Thus as for the treasures of wealth, it's yellow jade that it sends forth; as for the gems of great virtue, it's officials and ministers that are nourished. It is not just Songgao Mountain that sends down [its spirit] and causes the births of [the marquis of] Fu and [the earl of] Shen. Such is the case here, too.198 Just as humans were thought to affect the cosmos—as a ruler's nature might resonate into the heavens when he came to power or when he misbehaved—here the reverse is also true as a mountain's loftiness flows down into humans, transforming the nature of those who live within its precincts. Several hymns on Eastern Han grave stelae begin by credit ing a mountain near the dedicatee's birthplace with a loftiness that later 195. See n.69 above. 196. Lunyu jishi, 408 ("Yong ye" Jfitil). Confucius's comment is further explained in the Han shi waizhuan see James Robert Hightower, Han Shih Wai Chuan: Han Ying's Illustrations of the Didactic Application of the Classic of Songs (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1952), 107-8 (3.26). 197. For example, Huainan hongliejijie, 140 ("Di xing"), states that mountain qi-vapors produce more men than women, and that people born of the metal-phase-dominated western regions tend to be brave but not benevolent. Hou Han shu, 87.2869, also states that westerners by nature are stalwart and daring because of metal's qi-vapors. When describing a mountainous region with towering, jagged peaks, the Shishuo xinyu tS states, "Its people are huge in stature [lit. like "piled-up rocks"], their heroes many" (qi ren leike er ying duoS.

With regard to the basic question of feeding hungry spirits versus heeding cosmic cycles, it is important to note that, just as the mountain spirits on one side of the exchange lose a degree of separateness by being drawn into lineage and bureaucratic paradigms via ritual, the humans on the other side are also not wholly independent agents. They are not merely objects benefiting from the mountain's natural resources and precipitation; they are themselves part of that natural geography, thereby also losing a degree of separateness. The Li ji uses "Songgao" to emphasize this comprehensive continuity that privileges automatic systems over arbitrary agency, and in its discussion, both mountains and humans ideally do not exhibit personal interests. Confucius is asked why sage rulers were on par with heaven and earth, and he explains that it was because they learned their impartiality from the mechanical nature of the cosmos. He states: ' #1^31' JUffiSlil ' ° a' msmm - - Mimm ° - fts&amp;w ° =» ams - ° »ai/nag ° m&gt; b... Heaven has four seasons, namely spring and autumn, winter and summer. As for their [seasonal] winds, rains, frosts and dews, in every one of these there is a lesson. Earth bears up spiritual qi-vapors, and the spiritual qi-vapors are the namely wind and thunder. When the wind and thunder put forms into motion, the host of creatures appear and come forth. In every one of these there is a lesson. When clarity and purity reside within one's person, that person's ^/-vapors and mental fixtures are spirit-like. When that person's de sires are about to be realized, something will always precede it. When heaven is about to issue its seasonal rains, the mountains and rivers (first) will send forth clouds. As it says in the Shi... ,m 199. For example, see Wen xuan, 58.2506 ("Chen Taiqiu beiwen" fr SIX), includ ing commentary that cites Han apocryphal works also denoting how mountains spew forth their essence to produce sages. 200. Hong Gua, Li shi, 3.16a ("Sangong shan bei"). 201. Li ji jijie, 1278 ("Kongzi xianju"). In Han texts, to say that the mind's (jr'-vapors and fixations become "spirit-like" (rushen $[11$) is to say that they exhibit an efficacy beyond the person. This efficacy extended to prodigies arising as the natural world resonated with the clear mind's intense qi-vapors.</page><page sequence="57">K.E. BRASHIER 215 The passage then continues with the "Songgao" poem. In this three-fold cosmos of heaven, earth, and humans, nothing is arbitrary, and noth ing arises without a precursor. Meteorological phenomena are due to heaven's seasons, the propagation of flora and fauna is due to earth's spiritual qz-vapors, and all human success is similarly due to prior condi tions. The marquis of Fu and the earl of Shen did not simply rise up out of nowhere; they were descended from mountains. Yet such geomantic powers were not guaranteed. Humans could be called upon to keep these powers free-flowing or to respond to them when they proved particularly efficacious. In one case recorded on a stele dated 185 c.e., the Prefect Cao Quan H ^ of Heyang n[If?§ lamented the low rankings of officials coming from his region. By way of geomantic solution, he opened a city gate in a two-hundred-year-old wall that faced Hua Mountain so that it could be properly seen again. Thereafter the region produced many enlightened officials, their names included on the engraved stone.202 In a second case recorded on a stele four years earlier, the Prefect Pei Bi §|!| re-dredged a spillway to augment his region's geo mantic health and thereupon gave rise to large numbers of high officials. Yet this kind of geomantic thinking was not wholly immune to spiritual agency. The spillway's inscription then requests that whenever a local resident was appointed to any rank at the regional or imperial court, the appointee was to sacrifice to the lord of the spillway before setting out, the size of the sacrifice in direct proportion to the rank achieved.203 VIII.

For example, the Baishi Mountain hymn again refers to the fertility brought to the Yuanshi region, again notes the Wuji precedent, and again vaunts the building of a fancy shrine. Links between inscrip tion preface and hymn typically are intended to make readers retain the hymn through repeated recitation and future intonation; and not surpris ingly, the hymns use many of the tools of oral tradition—rhyme, meter, exaggeration, allusion and so forth—to make the hymn and its dedicatee memorable.

BRASHIER 217 memory as he is poured into a memorable Classicist mold, as he is filtered and refined into a manageable concentrate. Maurice Halbwach's work on cultural memory was recently summarized in a way that well fits this transformation process: Over time, the diverse expressions of individual memories gradu ally coalesce into the stereotypical images that give form to collec tive memories. In each repetition, the particular idiosyncrasies of individual memories are worn away. That which is remembered of oft-repeated experience is a reduction of particular memories into an idealized image, or imago.212 Grave stelae even explicitly refer to their dedicatees as having become "images" (xiang f?) that survive through constant repetition of their hymns. Similarly, the Spirit Lord of Baishi Mountain is being reduced into a hymnic image. In the process of reduction, he loses a degree of individu alism, although this loss of individualism is different from the loss expe rienced through being slotted into the lineage or bureaucratic systems described above. Yet even here there may be an implicit relationship. As the mountain deity becomes officially recognized and bureaucratically ranked, he is appropriately converted into the language of the court, namely the rhetoric of Classicism. He is conventionalized through this filter of Classicist texts and allusions, and what remains is the courtly image of an orthodox shrine and sacrifice dedicated to a Confucianized mountain god. Eight of the final twenty-two lines of the Baishi Mountain hymn are quotations from the Shi jing, but how they fit into the rest of the hymn depends upon one's interpretation strategy. First, citing a line from a Shi jing poem could automatically evoke the original context of that line because the poems of the Shi jing were regularly committed to memory. The list of "foxtail millet, broomcorn millet," and so forth may not have been merely a catalogue of grains; it may have also been an idealized depiction of a prosperous farm where proper sacrifices were offered in their season. Such was that phase's context in the Shi jing, and it is possible that these lines each carried a certain amount of unstated resonance due to the Han recitation tradition. The modern equivalent might be if a person hummed a few bars of a popular song and then stopped, and the song naturally carried on in the minds of the listeners. Second, in many pre Qin texts the Classicist quotations often did not index original meanings, 212. Patrick H. Hutton, History as an Art of Memory, (Hanover: University Press of New England, 1993), 7.</page><page sequence="60">218 FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE YINYANG the meanings instead deriving from how they interacted with the newer text that cited them. Adapting the poem's lines to new circumstances may have been a valued skill.213 Whether this pre-Qin practice also continued into the Han is uncertain because the Shijing became anthologized with set prefaces and commentarial traditions, thus fixing interpretation.214 Third, reading the hymn may simply have been an act of relying upon surface meanings alone and then pinpointing their common theme. Such is probably the case in the Baishi Mountain hymn. Even so, there is an aesthetic pleasure in encountering many diverse quotations woven to gether, much like the way in which musical scores may collect quotations from previous works by numerous dissimilar composers. The listener can both enjoy the multiple moments of recognition and also appreciate the skill required to incorporate these mostly unrelated quotations into one coherent piece that also manages to maintain a single rhyme scheme. Whatever the original intent may have been, or the interpretive strat egy may be, the conversion process itself is clear; the mountain deity is tamed and transformed into a court-recognized stereotype. In addition to being converted into the language of the court, the spirit lord is also being converted into the language of lineage. As already seen in section III, he was fixed within the extended mountain family using explicit lineage phrasing (such as occupying a collateral branch of the mountain 213. Mark Edward Lewis has studied this phenomenon in depth, in connection with texts such as the Zuo zhuan, the Lun yu, the Mencius, and the Xunzi. He writes as follows: While this practice often distresses modern scholars—but not postmodern ones—who privilege original meanings and an author's intent, the men of the Spring and Autumn and early Warring States period perhaps valued the ability to make the poem say something other than what had originally been intended. To repeat a poem was a simple-minded enterprise, but to actively adapt it to new circumstances required skill and perception. This use of the odes in the Spring and Autumn courts may have set a pattern for the Confucian ideal of adapting teaching—including the meaning given to key terms—to the circumstances and the interlocutor. It also anticipates the later philosophical and commentarial as sumption that the Odes contain hidden meanings. See Lewis, Writing and Authority in Early China (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1999), 158. 214. Steven Van Zoeren distinguishes "between a 'text in the weak sense'—a stable reiterable discourse, usually although by no means always written—and a 'text in the strong sense'—a stable text that has become central to a doctrinal culture and thus the object of exegetical exposition and study." See Van Zoeren, Poetry and Personality: Reading, Exegesis, and Hermeneutics in Traditional China (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1991), 25. In the second and third chapters of his book, Van Zoeren traces how citation of the Songs Canon became more and more fixed, and less prone to out-of-context sampling, over the course of early Chinese history.</page><page sequence="61">K.E. BRASHIER 219 clan and inheriting particular qi-vapors from his seniors). In section VIII the language of lineage is made explicit in terms of ancestral sacrifice. First, the Shi jing quotations include the "Purified Shrine" or "Qingmiao" '/ft JUL probably the most frequently cited hymn on ancestral ritual in the Han Dynasty. (The "Tian zuo" poem that begins the Fenglong Mountain hymn was also recognized as an ancestral hymn in the Han.) Second, the last four lines are a conventional concluding prayer akin to "auspi cious statements" (guci SUS?) usually found at the end of inscriptions on sacrificial bronze vessels in the ancestor cult. The allusions to ancestral ritual would have been readily recognizable. The guci endings also evoke ritual's automatic recompense as presented in the opening section of the Baishi Mountain inscription (11.5-8). As Martin Kern has recently written of their function in the Shi jing: The texts of the ancestral sacrifice not only present a request to wards the spirits but in one breath also rigorously channel and arrest the spirits' response.... [I] t is evident that neither the spirits nor the guests enjoyed many options. Their messages of gratitude and acknowledgement were predictable, and they were literally pre-scribed. As constituted in the language of the sacrificial hymns and bronze inscriptions—and, most importantly, through this lan guage—the ancestral sacrifice was a guaranteed success, leaving no question unanswered and no room for failure.215 The Baishi Mountain inscription begins with Li ji quotations on the au tomated system of ritualized recompense, and it ends with a guci that expresses the same intent. The ultimate result of this ritual hymn is the realization of a mountain deity as viewed through a Classicist lens and reduced into a Classicist imago; so viewed and reduced, he becomes a deity suited to his new rank. Conclusion Stewart Elliott Guthrie argues that religion in general consists of order ing the non-empirical realm using the highest organizational principle known within the empirical realm, that of humans and their social rela tionships. Thus when humans extract significance from the macrocosm, that macrocosm is filtered through a lens of anthropomorphic organiza 215. Martin Kern, "Shi jing Songs as Performance Texts: A Case Study of 'Chu ci' (Thorny Caltrop)/' Early China 25 (2000), 104. Elsewhere (pp. 64-65), Kern also high lights how in ritual acts and ritual speech "what counts is the role, not the individual." That is, the distinctiveness of identity is subordinate to a person's subsumed function within rigid ceremony.</page><page sequence="62">220 FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE YINYANG tions. He repeatedly draws upon Robin Horton, who defined religion as "the extension of the field of people's social relationships beyond the confines of purely human society."216 Catherine Bell has recognized a similar projection of human structures, particularly in Chinese ritual, when she writes, "It is a language of banking, bureaucratic hierarchy, and closed energy systems that enables human beings to influence the cosmos by extending the meaning and efficacy of those activities that seem to organize the human world most effectively."217 In terms of early China, Derk Bodde states, "The Han cosmologists tried to classify the phenomena of nature, devising for this purpose what was essentially a framework in their own image."218 These generalizations on projected human structures are directly rel evant to the approach of this article. Yet by using the Baishi Mountain inscription, I have focused more closely on an apparent difference of perspective in the application of human structures to the Han cosmos: namely, multiple, independent, willful agencies on the one hand and a single automatic, mindless system of forces on the other. Inconsistent as they seem to be, both were simultaneously recognized and projected onto the cosmos, and a few Han scholars consciously distinguished between them. Both found expression in the mountain inscriptions of the late Eastern Han. This article has placed these two perspectives on either end of a spectrum with the aim of defining a middle ground between them. It is where each side inches toward that middle ground that "the extension of the field of people's social relationships beyond the confines of purely human society" occurs. Given that this article has been conceived as a case study of a single inscription within a small corpus of inscriptions, I must refrain from offer ing conclusions that reach beyond the Eastern Han mountain inscriptions. Rather, I propose to use this image of a spectrum of cosmic powers (in which the operative variable is the degree of agency or automatism) to set forth a series of concluding observations on how the Baishi Mountain inscription maybe seen both to typify Eastern Han mountain inscriptions and to shed light on the underlying conception of cosmic powers. 216.

Horton adds a rider that this extension must involve a dependency relationship of the microcosm on the macrocosm so as "to exclude pets from the pantheon of gods." 217.

BRASHIER 221 Moving toward the center from the end of the spectrum representing a cosmos composed of multiple agencies, I see mountain deities shifting away from being independent anthropomorphic entities in several ways: 1. Instead of acting alone and arbitrarily, mountain deities were located within a hierarchical lineage structure from which their bodies and qz'-vapors derived. That lineage system was ultimately based upon their physically being a network of greater and lesser mountain ranges, a tangible reality that made a mountain lineage seem reasonable. They were not only systematized, but that system atization used some of the terminology of a resonance cosmology (such as ^f-vapors). 2. As commemorated by inscriptions, they were granted bureaucratic status overseeing certain territories and were in turn recognized as subordinate to other mountains. They heard pleas (i.e. prayers) and issued disbursements (i.e. rain) just like a court bureaucracy, and that functional parallelism thus made a mountain bureaucracy also seem reasonable. 3. Appropriate for their new status, the mountain deities were then properly fixed within a highly automated system governed by ritual in which both mountains and sacrificers recompensed one another on regular schedules. The Baishi Mountain inscription begins and ends by citing canonical sources on rituals and on how proper rituals elicit a response. 4. Finally, the stele inscriptions themselves not only give evidence of a movement away from pure independent agency; they are also a part of that movement, capturing the deity in a restrictive canoni cal image via the hymn. Filtered through the court rhetoric of Shi jing quotations, the deity was shaped to fit the expectations of a particular genre of discourse. Thus by being positioned within lineage and bureaucratic paradigms and by being subjected to ritual and court language, independent agency yielded to comprehensive system. Moving towards the center from the other side of the spectrum, the mountains were not just mechanical components within a system of forces but became anthropomorphized in a way that facilitated interac tion with them. 1. On the mildest level of anthropomorphizing, cosmic forces such as qian and kun were metaphorically fitted with human attributes</page><page sequence="64">222 FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE YINYANG such as those of a father and mother. Yet one did not build altars and sacrifice to metaphors. 2. On an associative and correlative level, mountains were likened to positive human qualities. Ultimately they infused those qualities into the people born within their environs. 3. On a more tangible level of specific, occasional interactions, yinyang or ^'-vapors were either harmonized or disturbed depending upon whether humans carried out particular sacrifices. In other words, these forces were expected to react positively or negatively as a human might in such an exchange. 4. On the most tangible level, these forces of nature took on human form. When there was a need for rain, mountains could appear as human in dreams, and what might first appear as ^'-vapors and rain from afar could be interpreted as a named goddess. Yet this level is rarely discussed in the inscriptions themselves. Thus from one perspective, gods became systematized, and from another, systems became anthropomorphized. Two significant caveats are necessary. First, the evidence presented in the mountain inscriptions does not yield perfect middle ground between the two ends of the spectrum. The lineage or bureaucratic system into which a god was pigeonholed may be a systemization of agencies, but it does not ultimately reveal how a god specifically affected these forces.219 By themselves, the mountain inscriptions do not offer an image of a well fed god physically pumping out gz-vapors to cause rain or bodily cycling the yinyang with the intention of fostering seasonal harmony. Such explicit mechanics do not occur in surviving sources, and they may have never existed. Perhaps a heritage of ritualized paradigms was enough to stave off the need for such details, and so while the two contrasting genres of discourse neared one another, they may never have formally met. Only scholars such as Xunzi and Wang Chong demanded complete consistency, and they instead favored one end of the spectrum over the other. Second, the language of spectrums and paradigms, agencies and sys tems is an outsider's view, an etic creation that would probably have been unrecognizable to the Han participants in mountain rituals. It borders on the debatable anthropological quest for a "deep structure," for the 219. One could argue, as did Han Classicism, that the bureaucracy and lineage structures were ultimately derived from the patterns of heaven and earth. Conversely, there is early evidence that the five phases were bureaucratized with anthropomorphic gods overseeing each category. For example, see Chunqiu Zuo zhuati zhu, 1502 (Zhao B3 29). Despite links between purely cosmological forces and agencies, such links are not explicitly acknowledged in the mountain inscriptions.</page><page sequence="65">K.E. BRASHIER 223 claim that "I know why they're doing what they do, even though they don't know why they're doing what they do." I do not intend to be so bold in this article, and am satisfied to suggest a few reasons why Han ritual participants did not see the two cosmological approaches as at odds with one another. From our etic perspective, we are steeped in a modern "religion versus science" debate, and we generally regard the blending of cosmic agency and cosmic system as a contentious issue. However, un less we change the terms of the debate to reveal the most basic building blocks, we are in danger of imposing our structure upon an earlier time. This article has attempted to identify building blocks that would have been recognizable in the Han, and then to build a conceptual structure using Han tools to position those blocks. At the very least, the inscriptions at Baishi Mountain and elsewhere demonstrate that modern studies of Han China should move beyond a paradigm of competing cosmological understandings—of separate arguments as to how the universe works. A paradigm that presumes such oppositions may be applicable to the point of view of a Xunzi or a Wang Chong, scholars who place themselves clearly in opposition to the popular views of their day. Yet we cannot appreciate the composite na ture of Han cosmological understanding—nor can we know what Wang Chong was really objecting to—without examining the multiple, seem ingly inconsistent genres of discourse that together formed a different, more common paradigm. As is evident in other cultures, the insertion of human structures serves well to smooth out the apparent inconsisten cies within this common paradigm. In Han China, one consequence of inserting these human structures was to make impersonal qf-vapors more human and to make personalized mountain deities more structured.220 220. How such anthropomorphized gods functioned in relation to the systems of yinyang and the five phases continues to be of growing interest in modern scholarship. For example, in his analysis of the "Jingshen" fn # chapter in the Huainanzi, Michael Puett has recently tackled the question of the role of spirits in a self-generating and spontaneous universe. He concludes that the "Jingshen" spirits who aligned the cosmos in fact possessed no will and simply obeyed a normative plan. He writes: Spirits, in short, have the power to do what should be done. They do not have the power to do what they wish: wind and rain, for example, are simply part of the spontaneous cosmos, not something controlled by the spirits. See Puett, To Become a God: Cosmology, Sacrifice, and Self-Divinization in Early China (Cam bridge: Harvard University Press, 2002), 283. The narrow philosophy of the Huainanzi is clearly distant from the more general worldview espoused by the mountain inscriptions in which spirits affect rain and human sacrificers affect spirits. For an example of an extended text from a century later in which a systematic cos mology and deified external agencies again interact with one another, see Brashier, '"A Poetic Exposition on Heaven and Earth' by Chenggong Sui (231-273)," Journal of Chinese Religions 24 (1996), 1-46.</page><page sequence="66">Fig. 1: The front of the Stele to the Spirit Lord of Baishi Mountain, from Nagata Hidemasa, Kan dai sekkoku shusei, Zuhan shakubun hen, 239</page><page sequence="67">Fig. 2: The back of the Stele to the Spirit Lord of Baishi Mountain, from Nagata Hidemasa, Kan dai sekkoku shusei, Zuhan shakubun hen, 241</page><page sequence="68">226 FEEDING THE DEITIES OR HEEDING THE Y1NYANG Appendix: Consecutive Transcription and Translation of the Baishi Mountain Stele The inscription is presented as a single text, including the last lines nam ing the authorizing officials as well as the final appended line in smaller script concerning the shrine's destruction in the fourth century.
