<plain_text><page sequence="1">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED: CHARLES LE BRUN AND THE 'GRAND TAPIS DE PIED D'OUVRAGE A LA TURQUE' WOVEN FOR THE GRANDE GALERIE AT THE LOUVRE By Wolf Buechard Precisely thirty years ago, Pierre Verlet published the standard work of reference on the most important French carpet manufactory: The Savonnerie: Its History (Bradford and London 1982).1 With his widely acclaimed book, Verlet provided both a compre hensive and long awaited history of the manufactory's production in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, as well as a catalogue of the carpets preserved in the Rothschild Collection at Waddesdon Manor. Moreover, Verlet's survey disentangled the complicated history and fate of the ninety-three carpets woven for Louis XIV between 1668 and 1688 to cover the entire floor of the 442 metre-long Galerie du Bord de L'Eau, or simply Grande Galerie, that linked the royal apartments of the Louvre to those of the Tuileries Palace. The weavings of these carpets — a vast, costly and entirely novel enterprise — formed part of the important refurbishment and enhancement to which the Louvre was subject during the 1660s. Unfortunately, as the king gradually turned away from the Louvre to concentrate on Versailles, the scheme was never completed and to this day the carpets remain the only furnishings known to have been produced for the Grande Galerie. From the mid 1930s, Verlet had meticulously gathered all existing evidence related to the unique Savonnerie commission, and his publication still constitutes the most essential resource for the study of carpet-weaving in seventeenth- and eighteenth century France. His detailed investigations were both complemented by the research of his contemporaries Madeleine Jarry, Edith Appleton Standen and Albert Pomme de Mirimonde, as well as more recent examinations of individual carpets by Kirsten Aschengreen Piacenti, Charissa Bremer-David and Elisabeth Floret.2 The current state of research has also gained considerably from Jean Vittet's insightful findings, which shed light on previously unpublished archival material and amongst other publications delivered an extensive study on the carpets woven for the Chapelle royale at Versailles.3 In view of the extraordinary wealth and depth of Verlet's research, the present study can provide but humble additions to his findings. While listing all the existing carpets he could trace, Verlet entertained the belief that even more survived undis covered in private hands and that his catalogue could gradually be complemented and expanded. His assumption proved correct, for since 1982 the art market has indeed witnessed the emergence of several carpets and carpet fragments, all of which are listed in an appendix subsequent to this article. Examining the Grande Galerie carpets primarily as an independent entity, Verlet had placed particular emphasis on the technological improvements accomplished by the Savonnerie manufactory in their endeavours to execute one of the most ambitious art commissions of Louis XIV's early personal reign. However, mostly focusing on issues related to production, provenance and collecting, his study only rather © Furniture History, Vol. XLVIII (2012), pp. 1-43</page><page sequence="2">2 SAVONNERIE REVIEWED circumstantially touches upon the involvement of Charles Le Brun (1619-90) in the conception and design process of the carpets. Le Brun's actual responsibility in this process will be revisited through hitherto unpublished or at least neglected visual sources. Particular attention will be given to the first carpet — which, apparently, Verlet never saw in the flesh — for it constitutes a veritable iconographie frontispiece for the ensuing ninety-two pieces. Finally, the following appraisal seeks closely to re-examine the relationship, both visual and iconographie, between the carpets and the architectural space they were woven for: the Grande Galerie at the Louvre. I. HISTORICAL CONTEXT: THE LOUVRE AND THE GRANDE GALERIE CARPETS When Jean-Baptiste Colbert (1619-83) became Surintendant des Bâtiments du roi in 1664, he immediately began a firm campaign to make the Louvre the largest and grandest palace in the world, the Domus Aurea of the Grand Siècle. Shortly after his appointment, Colbert wrote to Nicolas Poussin, expounding his ambitious goal: 'Il s'agit de mettre en perfection le plus bel édifice du monde et de le rendre digne s'il se peut, de la grandeur et de la magnificence du prince qui le doit habiter.'4 In 1665, Gianlorenzo Bernini came specially to Paris to supply designs for the palace's new east façade, yet the initially promising collaboration between the notorious Italian artist and the French Crown famously proved to be a disaster.5 Colbert turned away from Bernini and con voked the so-called Petit Conseil composed of the architects Louis Le Vau (1612-70) and Claude Perrault (1613-88), as well as the king's first painter Charles Le Brun.6 Building works began in the spring of 1667 and delivered both the Louvre's new east façade with its celebrated colonnade, as well as the acclaimed Galerie d'Apollon.7 Along with his efforts to find appropriate artists and architects to carry out his plans, Colbert also arranged for particularly long tree trunks to be brought to Paris for the installation of several nine-metre-wide looms for the Savonnerie workshops at Chaillot.8 This enormous enterprise was initiated by the wish to produce 'un grand tapis de pié d'ouvrage à la Turc ... qui devoit estre de la longueur de la grande Galerie du Louvre.'9 The production of this huge carpet, which in reality of course consisted of ninety-three individual pieces, began in 1668 in the Chaillot workshops of Simon and Philippe Lourdet, who were to be joined by Pierre Dupont in 1671.10 The first carpet was delivered to the Garde-meuble in 1669 and the last one in 1688, by which time the French Court had long since transferred to Versailles. However grand and original the enterprise may appear, Verlet has argued that the carpets were probably never laid out and displayed together in the setting they were designed for. Some were given away as diplomatic gifts, whilst the central carpet, which would have been placed in the Pavilion de la Lanterne subdividing the Grande Galerie into two parts, was never woven. As for the remaining carpets, they were mostly kept in the Garde-meuble throughout the reign of Louis XIV and indeed large parts of the eighteenth century, maintaining the notion that they constituted one single entity: 'un grand tapis'. Although each of the carpets bears an individual design, their overall structures follow a recurrent pattern. The layout is subdivided into three compartments, of which the middle one is the largest. This centre always features a circular inner element such</page><page sequence="3">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure i.

Through their sophisticated designs, the intensity of their colours, the quality of their craftsmanship and the great expense that they entailed, the carpets constituted a materialized display of abundance — an abun dance all the more accentuated by their base function as a surface on which to walk. Certainly one of the Grande Galerie carpets to have best retained its original colours is the one Louis XIV presented to Grande Duke Cosimo III of Tuscany, when he visited Paris in 1669 (Figure 1).12 It was woven on the basis of a cartoon re-used for the 60th and 92nd carpet. The comparatively small scale of the ornamental elements, the bas-reliefs and the intricately intertwined acanthus scrolls suggest a close stylistic connection with other Savonnerie weavings of the early and mid-i66os. Later pieces, such as the ones preserved at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, display much bolder designs with larger scrolls and bas-reliefs (Figures 2 and 3). The Metro politan Museum's music-themed carpet for instance comprises two much bigger allegorical bas-reliefs representing Euterpe, muse of music, and Erato, muse of lyric poetry.13 Despite the dispersal of many of the Grande Galerie carpets in the aftermath of the French Revolution, the Mobilier national still retains the largest collection of them. The 53rd in the series, delivered to the Garde-meuble by Dupont in 1678, is a particularly well-preserved example of a piece featuring landscapes at each end (Figure 4).14 Embedded in a quatrefoil-like framing, the hilly scenes at the carpet's horizontal extremities are in accordance with the French Royal Academy of Painting's precepts on classical landscape-painting. The view opens onto a hill enclosed by large trees. In both pastoral-like scenes — which actually do not feature any staffage — either a path (Figure 5) or a river (Figure 6) leads the gaze alongside the foreground to the back ground, where between further trees and hills arise idealized cities or castles. The horizon is defined by dramatic chains of dark blue mountains blurring into the backdrop of blue skies and white clouds. It is regrettable that almost no attention has so far been given to those carpets, which include landscapes rather than bas-reliefs; this neglect certainly derives from the fact that allegories provide more potential for both the identification of a specific design as well as for iconographie interpretations. II. THE FIRST CARPET The only carpet to deviate slightly from the predominant structural pattern described above is the first one of the series, which survives at the Palazzo Reale in Naples, former residence of Napoleon's brother-in-law Joachim Murat, proclaimed King of the Two Sicilies in 1808 (Figure 7).15 In contrast to the other carpets, it is almost perfectly square and features not two, but four allegorical cartouches — one in each corner. Verlet did not discuss this remarkable piece in great detail for he appears never to have seen it. However, according to his endnotes, he had been made aware of the possibility of the carpet's survival in Naples by Anthony Blunt and King Umberto III.16</page><page sequence="6">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure 4.

Landscape with path, detail of Figure 4 (Photograph Mobilier national © Isabelle Bideau) Figure 6. Landscape with river, detail of Figure 4 (Photograph Mobilier national © Isabelle Bideau) In a joint catalogue of Napoleon's furniture at the Palazzo del Quirinaie, Pierre Arizzoli-Clémentel and Chantai Gastinel-Coural have established how the carpet first came to Italy.17 Whilst it had been used in Louis XVI's dining room at Fontainebleau in the 1780s, it was sent to Rome in 1812, for its size almost perfectly matched that of Napoleon's Salon de famille at the Quirinaie.18 In January 1814, Murat's troops invaded the Eternal City and took possession of almost all the furniture from the Quirinaie, placed in store at Castel Sant'Angelo just about a week before they arrived.19 The rich loot — including the Savonnerie carpet — was sent to Naples shortly afterwards, where it remains to this day.20 Although Verlet said that the Grande Galerie carpets' 'scheme did not include a carefully planned development of the themes',21 the first carpet must be acknowledged as a veritable frontispiece, heralding the programmatic agenda of the whole set. At its centre, it features a solar head of Apollo enclosed by a circle of four lyres and four quivers, as well as eight trumpets and cornucopias on a blue background — as always connected to one another by elaborate swags of fruits and flowers. The larger framework in which the circular central panel is inserted includes four shields, which, according to the royal inventory, originally bore the royal arms of France and Navarre.22 These heraldic devices, including the royal crowns that used to surmount them, must have been removed in the aftermath of the French Revolution and were replaced by 'R.F.', the cipher of the newly installed republic. Many other Savonnerie carpets were subjected to similar textile mutilations in the 1790s and early 1800s. Each emptied coat of arms is flanked by Roman suits of armour and is horizontally connected through</page><page sequence="8">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure 7. Savonnerie manufactory, wool; first Grande Galerie Carpet, Palazzo Reale, Naples (inv. 212/1874; Photograph Palazzo Reale, Napoli © Luciano Pedinici) flower garlands supported by four large imperial eagles with spread wings. The four oval blue bas-reliefs in the corners represent the four continents: Africa, Asia, Europe and the Americas. Underneath each of these reliefs emerges a naturalistic human head alluding ethnically to the continent it embodies. Despite the extraordinary, and at first maybe overwhelming, wealth of emblems, forms and colours, the pure geometry of the sophisticated and stringent composition clarifies the reading. The design is concentrically arranged around Apollo's sunburst head at the centre. His backdrop is the golden yellow inner circle surrounded by a flower wreath and inserted into the circular blue panel, again framed by a laurel wreath. The circular blue panel itself is at the centre of a white, polyangular panel, which sets off the overall black background. Apollo's shining radiance is channelled axially from the middle of the carpet into eight distinct rays: the four lyre-like torches and the four</page><page sequence="9">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED 9 quivers. The lyres link Apollo with the royal arms of France and Navarre in the immedi ate next panel, whereas the quivers lead the eye via the imperial eagles to the four continent allegories in the corners of the carpets, outside the white panel. The concentric configuration of the composition thus visualizes the Sun King's claim for power. His crown-lands, France and Navarre, are of course within his immediate reach, but the rays of his glory equally penetrate to the most remote parts of the world. Such a clear composition, showing the rays reaching the four continents in equal measure, could only be achieved on a perfectly square carpet. In addition to the very clear linear com position, Apollo and the four continents are also visually linked by the predominance of azure and gold — the heraldic colours of the French monarchy — in the central panel as well as in the blue grisaille allegories highlighted in yellow. One must, however, be very careful when commenting on the compositional value of the colours, as much of the colour has faded, yet not all to the same degree. There is for instance no doubt that many of the greens, pinks and reds were originally much more vibrant. Regardless of the remarkable quality of both its design and execution, the carpet's present state cannot conceal that it must have been extensively used and exposed to natural light. Altogether the pile is rather worn, which makes the surface wizened. The borders all Grande Galerie carpets share, have been cropped, and areas which had either been previously damaged or removed, such as the coats-of-arms, are well visible as they were darned using threads of slightly different colours and fewer knots per square centimetre. It appears that the carpet must have already been in relatively poor condition in 1812, for Baron Martial Daru (1774-1827), Intendant de la couronne in Rome, had been rather reluctant to unroll it in the Imperial apartments at the Quirinale.23 As mentioned above, the carpet had previously been placed in Louis XVI's dining room at Fontainebleau, stitched together with the currently untraced 35th and 37th carpets to create one huge floor covering.24 A cut-out made for the dining room's projecting fireplace was later refilled with a visible fragment from another unidentified Grande Galerie carpet. This amendment was presumably performed in Paris before the carpet was transferred to Rome. Ironically, it is more difficult to establish the intended position of the first carpet in the Grande Galerie (its original destination) than the later locations during the reigns of Louis XVI and Napoleon. According to the royal inventory the carpet was meant to be flanked by two much smaller ones (again untraced), each of which comprised two octagonal landscapes, as well as oval bas-reliefs in yellow and blue.25 This particular arrangement suggests that rather than within the actual gallery, the carpets were intended for the Salon Carré linking the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d'Apollon (Figure 8).26 The fact that the carpet is listed as one for the Grande Galerie rather than for the Salon Carré is not contradictory to this hypothesis, for the appellation 'Grande Galerie' was used as a generic term referring both to the actual gallery space as well as to the entire wing linking the Louvre with the Tuileries. The whole area between the Galerie d'Apollon and the east part of the Grande Galerie was a huge building site in the 1660s, and since it was gradually abandoned in the 1670s we know very little about the function and planned decoration of the Salon Carré itself.27 We must, however, assume that by the time the first carpet was woven, a very distinct</page><page sequence="10">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure 8. The Louvre, floorplan c. 1667; I. Galerie d'Apollon, II. Salon Carré, III. Grande Galerie architectural scheme must have been decided upon, which would have dictated the specific format and alignment of the three carpets to be placed in the salon; it is conceivable that the carpets were to be complemented by four sculptures echoing the iconography of the four corners of the world. No matter how exactly the first carpet was to be laid out, it could be read as a pro grammatic frontispiece for the whole set of Grande Galerie carpets. In the mid-i66os, at the time when the Savonnerie carpets were designed, the concept of Louis XIV being 'le plus Grand Monarque de l'Univers' was in the process of development.28 In particu lar with respect to the building works at the Louvre, this concept engendered the notion of France being the 'abrégé', the subsumption if not epitome of the whole world and its various cultures. In a letter to Claude Perrault, Colbert suggested that some of the new apartments at the palace should be decorated according to the different cultures of the world. Colbert recommended rooms in the Italian, German, Turkish, Persian and Chinese style, so that, after travelling for so long, every foreign envoy would feel at ease at the Louvre.29 The correspondence displays the extent to which Colbert aimed at turning the royal residence into the centre of the world; but, since the Louvre was eventually given up for Versailles, Colbert's ambitious project was never carried out. Versailles, Louis's new palace with its highly acclaimed gardens, likewise offered the potential to represent the king in a global context. In a very instructive study of the 'Ikonographie des Universums', Pablo Schneider examined Charles Le Brun's designs for the Parterre d'Eau at Versailles in relation to sixteenth- and seventeenth century attempts to visualize a scientia universalis.30 Schneider shows that depicting the cosmos in its entirety — to establish all-encompassing theories of the world — was one of the key aspirations of scientific charts and diagrams, and that the combination of circle and square became the most important agent in the symbolic visualization of the cosmological interrelations. The first carpet of the Grande Galerie corresponds to these schemata, not only in so far as it visualizes the width and breadth of the glory of</page><page sequence="11">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure 9. Savonnerie manufactory, wool; carpet for the Galerie d'Apollon 1667, Musée du Louvre (OA5033; Photograph © Réunion des Musées Nationaux) Louis XIV's reign in a combination of square and circular shapes, but, in addition, to the extent that it subsumes the set of ninety-three individual carpets, which, like the universe, can never be perceived as a whole. Circular shapes, terrestrial globes and spheres appear in almost every Grande Galerie carpet.They were already part of the earlier carpets woven for the Galerie d'Apollon, but in a more peripheral fashion (Figure 9).31 The extent to which globes were considered in the early stages of the design process becomes obvious, if one considers one carpet that may have been at the forefront of both commissions for the Grande Galerie and the Galerie d'Apollon. The Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam holds a yet unpub lished carpet that could be one of the first Savonnerie works associated with Colbert's growing interest in the manufactory in the early 1660s (c. 1662-63; Figure 10). At its centre the carpet bears a large blue terrestrial globe with green islands encircled by a wreath of oak leaves with little acorns.32 Rather than being inserted into a complex system of panels, the globe is placed directly onto the black back ground, in a similar way as would have been customary for the central flower bouquet of a Louis XIII Savonnerie carpets (Figure 11). On the narrow sides the globe is flanked by two ornate blue urns. The entire background is covered by a combination of large scrolling acanthus leaves and flowers in pink, blue, white, and gold intertwined with more natural istic green vines. The carpet's intermediate position within the Savonnerie's chronology can be determined by several aspects of its manufacture. At first, the knot counts vary between 19 and 24 knots per square centimetre, which may point towards this carpet as an experimental piece, although one must acknowledge that there are similar variations in the Grande Galerie carpets, depending on whether it is an elaborate area of design or a backdrop. Curiously, as in the case of some Louis XIII Savonnerie carpets, the foliage is woven in relief — a technique that one occasionally finds for table carpets and which completely disappeared with the rise of the 'new' Galerie d'Apollon and Grande Galerie carpets.

Most importantly, the design completely departs from any previous work. The arrangements of gentle and delicate flowers from the Louis XIII carpets have been replaced by very large acanthus scrolls that seem out of proportion, and the prevailing system of square outer and inner borders is left out.33 The thin outer border itself is very close to the outermost border of the Grande Galerie carpets (Figures 12 and 13), except that in the latter the intertwined pattern is white, rather than white and blue, as in the Amsterdam carpet. III. CHARLES LE BRUN'S INVOLVEMENT IN THE CARPET'S CONCEPTION AND DESIGN Should the Rijksmuseum carpet indeed be an experimental attempt, by virtue of which the Savonnerie strove to display its technical abilities and to break with conventional designs, then the naivety of the ornamentation may indicate the terminus ante quern of Le Brun's involvement in the project. The following passage re-examines the attribution of the carpets' designs to Le Brun, and retraces the chain of command in the visual and intellectual conception of the carpets as well as in their production. The intention is better to understand Le Brun's role as well as the interrelations between the Savon nerie manufactory and the other French art institutions. In ascertaining the authorship for the Grande Galerie carpet's designs, Pierre Verlet had convincingly, yet very carefully argued in favour of a collaboration between the king's first painter Charles Le Brun and his first architect Louis Le Vau, always empha sizing that no documentary evidence provides definite proof for their involvement.34 Verlet's reasoning was based upon the fact that both Le Brun and Le Vau are associated with the redecoration of the Grande Galerie in the 1660s, and that only highly capable artists would have been commissioned to plan and carry out 'a project of this scale, so significant for the reputation of the king .. .'35 However, although Le Vau may have been consulted when it came to practical issues such as the width of each individual carpet — for it varies according to the presumed position in the gallery — their visual appearance first and foremost exhibits Le Brun's signature. In her 1966 history of the Savonnerie, Madeleine Jarry wrote that in 1663, Colbert 'conferred a new constitution on the Savonnerie, which he placed, together with the Gobelins, under the supreme direction of the Premier peintre du roi Charles Le Brun.'36 Unfortunately, Jarry made no reference to the document which informed her statement, and whilst many ensuing scholars repeated her assertion, Verlet — who knew the archival material relating to the Savonnerie so well — appears to have been unaware of any source testifying to Le Brun's directorship. It may be that Jarry's statement was based on the contract between Colbert, and Simon and Philippe Lourdet, heads of the Savonnerie workshop at Chaillot, although this was actually signed in 1664 and not 1663. In this contract, Colbert specified that, on a regular basis, he could send a painter from the French Royal Academy, who would inspect the cartoons for works produced at the manufactory, as well as teach the art of drawing to those apprentices he judged</page><page sequence="15">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED 15 talented enough.37 It appears that scholars, such as Jarry, probably rightfully assumed that although not explicitly named, the painter Colbert had had in mind must have been his rising protégé Le Brun.38 Nonetheless, never during the lifetime of Le Brun were the Savonnerie and the Gobelins manufactories administratively linked through a shared directorship. Indeed it was not until 1712 that the Savonnerie was created a Manufacture Royale des Meubles de la Couronne, a privilege conferred upon the Gobelins as early as 1667.39 We must, however, acknowledge a certain amount of fluency between both institutions. In his accounts on the Gobelins, Claude Nivelon, Le Brun's biographer, praised amongst the great array of works produced at the Gobelins 'un riche tapis de pied, à la manière turquesse ou perse, pour contenir par parties toute l'étendue de la grande galerie.'40 Needless to say that he was referring to the Savonnerie carpets. From 1664 onwards, Le Brun was probably very involved in the conception of both the carpets for the Galerie d'Apollon and the first ones for the Grande Galerie. At the beginning, he may even have indeed paid the Chaillot workshops visits and taught drawing. However, due to his numerous other engagements, once the project was under way, he must have relied on the help of his many assistants. Based on the little documentary evidence in existence, Verlet was able to identify several artists who were involved in the actual designing of the individual carpets, though unfortunately none of the cartoons are known to survive.41 All of Le Brun's assistants in the project were either members of the Academy or of the Gobelins, or both. Much as he did later in the state apartments at Versailles, the king's first painter probably gave overall designs, which were then enlarged and tidied in the form of cartoons by the decorative painters François Francart (c. 1622-72) and Baudren (Baurdin) Yvart (1611-90), rather in the way that Pierre de Sève and Renard de Saint-André did for tapestries. Both Francart and the more influential Yvart lived and worked at the Gobelins. Francart is known to have been involved with the production of stage sets and ephemeral architecture,42 whereas Yvart was received at the Académie in 1663 and was awarded the prestigious appointment of Peintre ordinaire du roi and Garde des tableaux, dessins, modèles et cartons at the Gobelins.43 Yvart and Francart were further assisted by the ornamental painter Jean Lemoyne (1638-1713),44 the Flemish landscape painter Abraham Genoëls (1640-1723),45 as well as Nicasius Bernaerts (1620-78),46 Jean-Baptiste Monnoyer, (1636-99)47 and possibly Pieter Boel (1622-74),48 all of whom were specialized in the depiction of animals, fruits and flowers. It is probably fair to assume that even more artists were involved in designing cartoons for the Savonnerie carpets. What one can infer from the identity of the artists who were linked to the project, is that in the designing of the cartoons, a vigorous exchange must have prevailed between the Savonnerie, the Academy and more impor tantly the Gobelins. However, when it came to technical rather than aesthetic matters, the Savonnerie appears to have been rather independent from the Gobelins. It relied completely on its own weavers, who did not employ dyes produced at the Gobelins, but by other Parisian dyers. In fact, throughout the eighteenth-century this matter had been a major concern, and several attempts were made to have the Gobelins and the Savonnerie use the same dyes, but this was never achieved.49</page><page sequence="16">i6 SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Returning to Le Brun's authorship, one can argue that in spite of the lack of docu mentary evidence explicitly attesting to his contribution, the very appearance of the Grande Galerie carpets is indicative of his prime role in their visual conception: the intricacies and fine proportions of the acanthus scrolls, the accuracy of the anthropo morphic heads, the classically-idealized faces of Hercules and the smooth, almost Raphaelesque portraits of Apollo are all unmistakably reminiscent of other decorative works by the artist. The layout and composition of the carpets must have been informed by various visual sources, which Le Brun would have encountered at the beginning of his career. The intricate structure of the design combining realistic fauna and flora, with mythological heroes and creatures, imbedded in a complex arrangement of intertwined scrolls holding up almost floating landscapes and allegories, is indicative of the influence of sixteenth-century grotesque wall paintings, which Le Brun carefully studied during his sojourn in Rome, especially at the Vatican palace, and which also influenced his decorative works at Vaux-le Vicomte. In an inventive move, Le Brun combined the complex structures known from Italian Renaissance wall and vault deco rations with the colourful inlaid floor decorations that he would have likewise seen at the Vatican, and translated both decorative traditions into textiles. The influence of inlaid decoration of precious marbles becomes even more obvious if one compares the carpets to contemporary Italian examples, but also French pietre dure table slabs, such as the ones produced at the Gobelins under Le Brun's direction. All share the same black background, which lends flamboyance to the bright colours. In addition to these complex influences, at least two drawings for allegorical figures by Le Brun's own hand can be related to actual Grande Galerie carpets. The Rijks museum holds a very fine sketch for a sitting Victory,50 which was employed in the bas reliefs of the now lost 40th Savonnerie carpet, possibly woven by Dupont in 1677 (Figures 14 and 15).51 Another preliminary drawing representing Fame blowing a trum pet, also by Le Brun himself, is now kept at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux Arts in Paris,52 and it relates to the previously mentioned and illustrated 38th carpet at the Metropolitan Museum (Figures 3,16 and 17).53 The Paris and Amsterdam drawings, which display strong similarities — both technically as well as stylistically — have been dated around 1667-68, thus placing them at the beginning of the Grande Galerie's chronology.54 It remains uncertain whether Le Brun drew the sketches presented here specifically for the carpets they were eventually used for, or whether they were part of the large pool of designs kept under the surveyorship of Yvart at the Gobelins. Le Brun produced countless allegorical drawings for all kinds of decoration, which were some times re-used in different context. The 9th and 19th carpets, for instance, feature a bas relief representing putti and dolphins, which resembles one of Le Brun's designs later employed by Jean-Baptiste Tuby in the sculptural decoration, now lost, of the Apartement des Bains at Versailles between 1677 and 1681.55 Yvart himself might have been the draftsmen of yet another study for an allegorical bas-relief used in the 5th and 17th carpet, and preserved at the Musée Fabre in Montpelier.56 Considering the importance and scale of the Grande Galerie commission, it seems sensible to presume that, rather like he called for the assistance of fellow painters for the carpets' designs, Le Brun probably also relied on the help of other academicians,</page><page sequence="17">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED 17 when it came to the overall conception of the scheme and its intellectual agenda. Again, although no documentary evidence is known to survive, some parts of the carpets' iconography must be attributed to the Petite Académie, with which Le Brun was 'in active communication' throughout the 1660s and 1670s.57 Established in 1663 by Colbert, the Petite Académie consisted of four erudite members of Richelieu's Académie française: Amable de Bourzeys,58 Jacques Cassagne,59 Jean Chapelain,60 and Jean François Char pentier,61 as well as their secretary Charles Perrault, Claude Perrault's brother.62 With their combined knowledge and fundamental understanding of both ancient and foreign languages, these men had great influence on many of the projects initiated by Colbert. It was in his very house and in the presence of Le Brun that the Petite Académie regularly gathered. Although no minutes were taken, one can assume that the programme of the Savonnerie carpets was at some point discussed here — especially if one considers Chapelain's considerable involvement in the 1664 debate as to whether or not Le Brun was to use allegories in the tapestry series of the Histoire du Roy.63 In summary, the comparisons between the Amsterdam carpet with those made for the Grande Galerie underlines what extraordinary improvements in terms of design were achieved by Savonnerie from 1664 onwards. The carpets both designed and super vised by Le Brun for the Louvre have an enormously complex structure, which includes abstract, purely ornamental elements combined with more naturalistic ones, the whole visualized in a crisp, three-dimensional fashion of light and shade, achieved by the important enhancement of the colour palette in the mid 1660s. The combination of orna mental and realistic elements, with allegories and landscape in a grotesque framework, is utterly unique. No carpets produced at the Savonnerie before or after this commission contained such a complexity of elements — the carpets made for the Chapelle royale at Versailles for instance were again almost entirely non-figurative and ornamental. Finally, as argued above, the complexity of the design — which the Savonnerie itself was unable to provide — must be attributed to Le Brun and his large circle of assistants, but we must also acknowledge the share of the Petite Académie in the conception of the iconography. IV. THE GRANDE GALERIE IN THE 1660S The historiography of the Grande Galerie for which ninety-three Savonnerie carpets were intended is manifestly fragmentary. Whilst Poussin's attempts to decorate its vaults in the early 1640s have been subject to extended research, Le Brun's and Boullogne's works from the 1660s were almost completely neglected by scholars. The following section aims to revisit this part of the Grande Galerie's decorative history in order to understand better what Le Brun might have achieved, had Louis XIV not discontinued the project in 1678. The Grande Galerie had been erected by Flenry IV between 1603 and 1610; it spanned the entire piano nobile level of the spacious south wing of the Louvre, which served the dual purpose of linking the Parisian royal residence with the Tuileries Palace and providing space for the workshops and lodgings of the Galeries or Ateliers du Louvre, established in 1608 (Figure 18).64 The Pavilion de la Lanterne mentioned above, sub</page><page sequence="18">l8 SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure 14.

Jean-Michel Chevotet, side elevation of the Grande Galerie of the Louvre, Paris 1721 (Institut national d'histoire de l'art, Bibliothèque, collections Jacques Doucet, Paris) divided the gallery into two unequal parts: the eastern comprised 17 bays and the western 28; that is 46 bays in total if we take into account the additional bay underneath the lantern of the dividing pavilion. Besides the installation of two marble triumphal arches (c. 1608) to frame the entrances on each side of the gallery, the interior remained largely undecorated in the reign of Henry IV.65 Inspired by the Galleria delle Carte Geografiche at the Vatican, the king had envisaged the trumeaux to contain maps of France, but it seems that nothing of the sort was undertaken during his reign.66 In 1626, Louis XIII asked Jacques Fouquières to paint views of the most important French cities instead of maps to adorn the walls, but this commission likewise fell into oblivion.67 Fourteen years later, in 1640, Louis XIII's Surintendant des Bâtiments, François Sublet de Noyer, summoned Nicolas Poussin from Rome to decorate the vaults of the Grande Galerie — a unique episode in the artist's career, which has been the subject of extensive scholarly examinations.68 For the decoration of the Grande Galerie vaults, Poussin combined 70 plaster casts of the Column of Trajan and other ancient monuments which he had brought from Rome (presumably painted green to emulate bronze) with chiaroscuro depictions of the life and labours of Flercules on a gold mosaic background.69 Both the casts and the grisailles were framed by elaborate plasterwork of sculptural and architectural elements.70 The frieze, with alternating circular and rectangular depictions of the life and labours of Hercules, was held by coupled pilasters separating the windows from the trumeaux.71 Poussin, who was known for his small-scale history painting, had now been asked to decorate almost 4000 square metres of vault — without any doubt the most laborious and annoying commission of his career. Indeed, it was so irritating and</page><page sequence="21">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED almost unfeasible a task that in 1642, Poussin left Paris under the pretext of picking up his wife in Rome, and never returned. For another year Poussin continued to supply designs for the vault's decoration from Rome, but following the death of Richelieu and Louis XIII in 1642 and 1643, the subsequent downfall of Sublet de Noyer and the outbreak of the Fronde, the decorative project was abandoned. By that time only the vaulted area above the first ten windows and nine trumeaux (cjVi pontées) — less than a quarter of the total 46 gallery bays — would have been decorated with grisaille depictions of Hercules's life. In February 1661, less than twenty years after Poussin had withdrawn from the building site of the Louvre, a remorseless fire partially damaged the Grande Galerie's decoration, whilst it completely destroyed the adjacent Petite Galerie.72 The rebuilding of the smaller gallery commenced that same year under the supervision of Louis Le Vau; it appears that by 1664 structural work had been completed and that Le Vau was asked to consider the refurbishment of the Grande Galerie.73 When in 1667 the refurbish ment works actually began, Le Brun, already busy decorating the vaults of the Petite Galerie, thus turning it into the Galerie d'Apollon, was also asked by Colbert to replace Poussin's work at the Grande Galerie: 'Mais la vénération qu'il [Le Brun] a toujours eue [sic] pour ce grand homme [Poussin] l'en empêcha, donnant avis qu'il fallait continuer ce qu'il avait commencé de même manière dans le même ordre jusqu'à la moitié, et qu'il ferait l'autre partie .. .'74 So rather than doing away with Poussin's work, Le Brun suggested that it be restored and continued up to the mid-point of the gallery. It was presumably at his request that Colbert commissioned his fellow academician, Louis Boullogne le père, esteemed a remarkable copyist,75 to carry out the job.76</page><page sequence="22">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure 19.

Nicolas Poussin, design for the vaults of the Grande Galerie, c. 1641, The State Hermitage, St Petersburg (inv. 8192), Photograph © The State Hermitage Museum/photo by Vladimir Terebenin, Leonard Kheifets, Yuri Molodkovets The refurbishment conducted by Boullogne between 1668 and 1671 is crucial to our understanding of the gallery's appearance at the time that Le Brun conceived the Savonnerie carpets. Two watercolours survive which testify to Boullogne's continuation of Poussin's Hercules scheme: one at the Musée Grobet-Labadié in Marseilles, the other at the Albertina in Vienna (Figure 19).77 Even though these designs have been described as being more Baroque in character, they do not break distinctively with Poussin's origi nal decoration — they were clearly designed to finish the first half of the gallery, not to decorate the second one. An immediate comparison of Boullogne's watercolour in Vienna with what presumably was Poussin's design for the first dessus de fenêtre of the gallery (Figure 20), displays a faithful continuation of the scheme.78 The proportions of both the architectural framework and the Atlantes are identical; the posture of the figures and the crowning of the pediments, and indeed the pediments themselves, may</page><page sequence="23">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED 23 Figure 21. Figure 9, L. N. van Blarenberghe, Depiction of the Grande Galerie, back face of the Choiseul Box, private collection differ from one another, but so did each of Poussin's own designs for the dessus de fenêtres.79 Completely remodelled in the nineteenth century, nothing survives of Poussin's decoration and its continuation by Boullongne. The only remaining visual evidence that can testify to what was probably one of the largest non-sacred interiors to have been built in seventeenth-century France is the back face of the tiny eighteenth century snuffbox that belonged to the Duc de Choiseul, famous Minister of War to Louis XVI (Figure 21).80 Regarding the second half of the gallery, scholars have yet to discover what Le Brun may have had intended for the decoration of the vaults. There is no doubt that he must have had an overall scheme in mind when overseeing the designing of the carpets. It is quite likely that Le Brun would have pursued Poussin's Hercules theme in the second half of the gallery, since he was the most obvious hero for this project. The other two champions exploited for Louis XIV's propaganda, had already been explored elsewhere: whilst the legends of Apollo were depicted in the vaults of the adjacent Galerie d'Apollon, the non-celestial figure of Alexander the Great lent himself better to tapestries and wall- rather than vault-decorations. Also, in re-interpreting the Hercules saga in his own way, whilst preserving Poussin's vaults, Le Brun would have had an immense opportunity both to display his reverence for his predecessor as well as to compete with him. Had he still been alive, Poussin would perhaps even have encouraged Le Brun's agenda, for he had declared that novelty in painting was not attained by treating new subjects, but in creating new compositions based on traditional themes. 'La nouveauté en peinture ne consiste pas principalement en un sujet inédit, mais en sa bonne et nouvelle disposition et expression, et ainsi de commun et vieilli, le sujet devient singulier et nouveau.'81</page><page sequence="24">24 SAVONNERIE REVIEWED —3—■ ^ Figure 22. Hercules-themed second design for vaults of the Grande Galerie at Versailles, presentation watercolour by Claude III Nivelon after sketches by Charles Le Brun, Louvre, preserved in Versailles (MV7912; Château de Versailles et Trianon, Photograph Réunion des Musées Nationaux © Gérard Blot) Le Brun had already worked on the Hercules theme at the Hotel Lambert in the 1650s, and around c. 1678 he reinvented the subject for the Grande Galerie at Versailles, today know as Galerie des Glaces. 21 sketches from Le Brun's own hand survive in the prints and drawings collection of the Musée du Louvre, which his collaborator Claude III Nivelon copied and inserted into a large presentation watercolour, shown to and rejected by Louis XIV (Figure 22).82 Although this watercolour was made for the Grande Galerie at Versailles, it might convey what the king's first painter could have imagined for the Grande Galerie at the Louvre. Le Brun hated waste and often recycled rejected designs and ideas, and, as Jennifer Montagu has argued, he re-used the same Hercules designs made for Versailles, most probably to offer them to a senior French courtier for his own gallery.83 Altogether, the vaults of the second half of the Louvre's Grande Galerie would have constituted an extremely difficult space to decorate — especially in the manner of Le Brun. Poussin is said to have preferred uniform decoration as a classical counterpart to the baroque ceilings of his contemporaries, yet it seems that this was anyway the only feasible solution in this case. Considering the length of the gallery, one could only logically tell a story sequentially with a reading order from one end to the other. The climax could not stand at the centre as Le Brun had managed at the Grande Galerie in Versailles. The uniformity and repetition of Le Brun's carpets follow Poussin's example in that they represent ninety-three independent entities that can be looked at individ ually, although they should of course be displayed as a whole. One might assume that</page><page sequence="25">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED 25 Le Brun was aware of the challenging nature of the Grande Galerie as an architectural space, which, owing to its proportion would have been particularly difficult to decorate. Although we can but speculate about how Le Brun would have decorated the vaults of the gallery's second part, had the king not lost interest in the Louvre, we must at the same time appreciate the intermediary role the vivaciously coloured Savonnerie carpets would have played: running through both parts of the gallery, they would not only have been a powerful counterpart to Poussin's classical decoration, but a link — indeed a harmonizing and uniting bridge — between the work of the master and that of his student. CONCLUSION We do not know how seventeenth-century contemporaries would have perceived the juxtaposition of Poussin's decoration with Le Brun's carpets — the contrast between the uniform, predominantly white, green and gold vaults and the much more colourful floor coverings must have been striking, for the latter were anything but sober. How ever, as pointed out by Verlet, it is unlikely that the carpets were ever laid out in their entirety in the Grande Galerie at the Louvre in the reign of Louis XIV. An idea of the intended effect was last given on the occasion of the Signing of the Treaty of Versailles on 18 June 1919, when twenty-four carpets were unfolded and stitched together in the Galerie des Glaces (Figure 23).</page><page sequence="26">26 SAVONNERIE REVIEWED Figure 23. Postcard showing some of the carpets made for the Grande Galerie at the Louvre displayed in the Grande Galerie at Versailles (with the 85th carpet at the centre underneath the bureau plat), 1919, private collection The Louvre's Grande Galerie carpets conspicuously depart from any other decora tive scheme or tapestry series supervised by Le Brun. Rather than paraphrasing the King's accomplishments in carefully narrated tableaux, as he did with the Battles of Alexander, the king's first painter conveyed the grandeur he saw in his patron through an amalgamation of diverse themes and rich designs, tellingly subsumed by Ver let: The whole is an extraordinary paean in honour of Louis XIV, a sort of symphony with a flourish of trumpets and clashing of cymbals ... The Elements, the Virtues, Good Government, are lauded. As far as one can judge from the apparent order of the carpets, the scheme did not include a carefully planned development of the themes; but they spread the glory of the King, as it were, at our feet.84 Indeed, the carpets provided Le Brun with an opportunity to create a completely new and unconventional visual language. In their groundbreaking design, the carpets for the Grande Galerie not only differed from the artist's own works, but they were also very different from all the other carpets so far produced at the Savonnerie manufactory, and actually also from those produced after the series had been completed. Never before or after the weaving of these carpets would the Savonnerie produce works including the same array of anthropomorphic elements, allegorical figures and mythological portraits of Satyrs, Apollo or Hercules. With his 1982 history of the Savonnerie, Verlet set a monument for the extra ordinary achievements of the manufactory in the early personal reign of Louis XIV. The</page><page sequence="27">SAVONNERIE REVIEWED 27 carpets produced for the Grande Galerie at the Louvre not only conveyed the Sun King's political agenda, but they visualized Colbert's art policies and aspirations to make the Louvre the world's greatest palace. Whilst the present study could only make very moderate additions to Verlet's research, it first and foremost aimed at commemorating the remarkable publication of an art historian's life-long work, published precisely thirty years ago.

APPENDIX Updated Catalogue of the Savonnerie Carpets woven for the Grande Galerie at the Louvre Several Grande Galerie carpets and carpet fragments have been rediscovered since the publication of Pierre Verlet's history of the Savonnerie in 1982. These findings confirm his hypothesis that some carpets continue to survive in unknown whereabouts such as private collections. Certainly the most extraordinary rediscovery occurred at the Palazzo Pitti in October 1982 — sadly, only shortly after Verlet's book had been published. Kirsten Aschengreen Piacenti found the carpet, which was woven after the same cartoon as the 60th and 92nd, and presented to Cosimo III by Louis XIV amongst other precious textiles, when he came to Paris in 1669 (Figure 1).1 The carpet, which presumably did not see the light of day for over 300 years, is one of the very rare examples to have retained perfectly its intense colours. Another well preserved piece emerged in 1985, when the J. Paul Getty Museum acquired it from a private collection. This dignity-themed carpet, 72nd of the series, has fortunately been very carefully catalogued and published by Charissa Bremer David, before the Getty de-accessioned it again in November 2000.2 Finally, in 1993, no less than three important pieces re-appeared on the art market; particularly noteworthy was the 61st carpet, which previously had belonged to Charles Deering, who over the course of his life had accumu lated one of the most important American collections of Oriental rugs.3 Based on detailed descriptions in the royal inventories published by Jules Guiffrey in 1885-6,4 Pierre Verlet established an extremely useful catalogue of all 93 carpets, as well as their re weavings, comprising all available information he could assemble about each individual piece.5 This catalogue was complemented by a folding plan of the Grande Galerie with line drawings of every known carpet, illustrating what Verlet believed may have been the intentional laying-out order of the carpets. The list below, which merely gives abridged descriptions of the carpets, mod estly seeks to update Verlet's more comprehensive catalogue by adding new information about present locations, sales and bibliography. More detailed descriptions, original dimensions in aunes, as well as previous whereabouts of now untraced carpets, can be consulted in Verlet's own pub lications. When no new information could be added to a carpet, only the location is given. 1. A. (142 in the royal inventory) Polyangular outer panel on a white ground bearing the arms of France and Navarre; round blue inner panel with a sunburst at the centre surrounded by attributes of Apollo; blue bas-reliefs representing the four continents in the four corners (Figure 7; originally 8.92 x 8.33 m). Used in Louis XVI's dining room at Fontainebleau in 1785; sent to Rome in 1812 for use at the Salon de Famille in Napoleon's apartments at the Palazzo Quirinale; sent to Castel Sant' Angelo in 1814 and subsequently to the Palazzo Reale at Naples. The borders have been cropped and a cut made for a projecting fireplace has later been amended by the addition of a piece from another yet unidentified Grande Galerie carpet.

B. Two smaller carpets to be joined to the first one; borders on only three sides; each carpet contains two octagonal landscapes, as well as a yellow and a blue oval bas-relief (both 6.98 x 1.48 m). Location unknown. 2. (143) Outer panel with a brown ground, featuring trophies of arms, cornucopias and floral garlands; oval inner panel bearing a circular panel filled with flowers at its centre; in each corner is a griffin on a shield surrounded by acanthus scrolls; rectangular landscapes (8.92 x 6.34m). A fragment including the profile of a griffin surrounded by acanthus scrolls was on sale at Coutau-Bégarie, Drouot Paris, 16 February 2005, lot. 345 (0.65 x34.0m). Although the design suggests that owing to the carpet's original symmetry, there might have indeed been four griffins in the original carpet, the one on the fragment is not on an actual shield, but sitting on what appears to be the framework of what would be a rectangular landscape or bas-relief panel. Otherwise location unknown. 3. (144) Sunburst encircled by a garland of flowers at the centre, surrounded by the arms of France and Navarre, and inserted into a larger, irregular eight-pointed star panel; oval bas-reliefs at each end bearing a suit of armour (8.92 x 5.05 m). The cartoon of the 3rd carpet was re-used for the 32nd (173). One carpet at the Banque de France in Paris, whereas location of the other is unknown. 4. (145) Outer panel on a white ground and an oval inner panel bearing another small round panel with the crowned interlaced royal cipher, flanked by trophies of arms; each corner features eagles surrounded by acanthus scrolls; landscapes at each end (8.92 x 5.85 m). The cartoon of the 4th carpet may have been re-used for the 24th (165). Location unknown. 5. (146) Polyangular main panel on white ground bearing the arms of France and Navarre; small rectangular inner panel with a terrestrial globe at the centre surmounted by four crowns; oval bas-reliefs representing Fortune and Kudos on a blue ground (8.92 x5.05 m). The same cartoon was re-used for the 17th carpet preserved at the Musée du Louvre, except that its bas-reliefs have a light grey background. A drawing of the winged figure of Fortune is preserved at the Musée Fabre, Montpelier. Whilst both Yvart and Le Brun himself have been suggested as possible authors, the attribution of the sketch remains debatable. Mobilier national (GMT 201g). Matthieu Gilles (éd.), Le Trait en Majesté: Dessins Français du XVIIe Siècle dans les collections du Musée Fabre, Paris 2010, p. 158-59. 6.

(148) Polyangular outer panel with trophies of arms in the four corners, and circular inner panel featuring four lyres; two large sunbursts at each end and two bas-reliefs, one representing Mars, the other Minerva (8.92 x5.15 m). The cartoon of the 7th carpet may probably have been re-used for the 25th. One carpet kept at Versailles whereas the location of the other remains unknown. 8. (149) Large outer panel on white ground; at the centre is a globe with the interlaced royal cipher surrounded by trophies of arms and cornucopias; in the corners griffins on shields surrounded by acanthus scrolls; rectangular landscapes (8.92 x 5.79m). The description of the carpet has many similarities with the 22nd (163); a carpet fragment bearing the arms of France, rather than the LL cipher, has been wrongly identified as the central panel of the 8th carpet, and was on sale at the Hôtel Drouot (Etude Couturier Nicolay), 28 March 1990, lot. 179 (2.93 x 2.70m). It came up for sale again at Christie's, New York, 21 May 1997, lot. 411, with the sounder conclusion that it was part of a carpet made for an alcove; a fragment containing the profile of a griffin was on sale at Drouot in 2005 — compare commentary to 2nd carpet. Location unknown. 9. (150) Sea-themed carpet with a polyangular outer panel on a white ground and an inner panel featuring shells, branches of corals and two dolphins; oval bas-reliefs in blue, depicting dolphins, tritons and water deities (8.92 x 5.15 m). One of the sea-themed bas-reliefs can be related to a sketch presevered in the print room of the Louvre (Inv. 29852). The drawing of second-rate quality is probably a workshop copy after a now lost design from Le Brun's own hand, which was later employed at the Appartement des Bains at Versailles — another instance that testifies to the artist's frequent re-use of his own designs. For Le Brun's design see: François Souchal, French Sculptors of the îyth and 18th centnries: The reign of Louis XIV, vol. 3, Oxford 1987, p. 347 and Lydia Beauvais, Charles Le Brun, 1619-1690, vol. 2, Paris 2000, p. 700 (cat. no. 2443).

(151) Outer panel on white ground with trophies of arms in the corners; octagonal inner panel in faded pink, bearing the crowned, interlaced cipher eight times; on the sides are two heads of Hercules with clubs and two lion masks, also with clubs; oval landscapes (8.92 x6.17m). The cartoon was re-used for the 14th carpet; one version was formerly at Mentmore, Buck inghamshire, and a re-patched fragment of the other, including two heads of Hercules and the two lion masks, was on sale at Christie's London, King's Street, 21 June 2000, lot. 103 (4.74 x 3.29m); a fragment of a central octagon, similar to that of the 10th and 14th carpet was on sale at Sotheby's, London, 30 November 1984, lot. 255 and then again at Christie's, London, 10 June 1993, lot. 56 (3.24 x 3.47m). As the indigo ground colour of this fragment departs from the faded 'rose sèche' (rose-pink) of the descriptions in the royal inventory, it may have been woven as part of a third unrecorded carpet, given away as a diplomatic gift. 11.

Lourdet's workshop finally delivered a third weaving (no. 251) in 1688-89.

The 23rd carpet survives at the Mobilier national, whereas the 31st is preserved at the Huntington Art Gallery, San Marino, lacking the bas-reliefs depicting Astrology. Two narrow fragments of the upper area of the other bas-relief (not Astrology) were on sale at Drouot, Paris, 16 February 2005, lot. 344, and are now also at Huntington. The fact that the limbs visible in those fragments are identical with those of the unidentified allegorical figure, which both the 23rd and the 31st carpet still contain, suggests that the fragments probably originate from a third weaving.
