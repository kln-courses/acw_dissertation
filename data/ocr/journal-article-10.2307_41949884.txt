<plain_text><page sequence="1">Without World Juan Manuel Garrido Universidad Diego Portales To Fiorella Zecchetto AS LONG AS WORLD IS UNDERSTOOD AS THE TOTAL HORIZON OF OUR EXPE- rience , it will presumably not be thought and considered as such. A "total horizon"- however total, unconditional, and unintentional it be- is con- stituted with relation to the position of a finite self and takes its full sense only with respect to such a position- consciousness, transcendental ego, embodied mind, living corporality, existing ipseity, and so forth. The world is thereby not considered in itself and by itself but as a limiting or delimiting correlate for the localized self. In itself and by itself, world, provided such a thing is not a mere illusion, must rather be thought of as preceding all horizon, finitude, selfhood- as preceding worldliness itself if by "world" we mean the total horizon of our experience. "No world worthy of its name," we read in Rodolphe Gasché s upcoming book, Europe, or the Infinite Task , "comes into being within a horizon" (2009, 345). World is world when it is "a world without a delimiting horizon" (353), when it is a world without world.

Only thus may one understand why it is that the world is an unthe- matized and unintentional object for consciousness, a totality that never can be objectified by thinking. World has not even the status of an "idea" or of a "regulative totality": the worldling of world, while releasing from selfhood, is the very movement of detotalizing totality and disclosing horizons, infinitely and unlimitedly. Somehow, then, the world begins to be properly lived or experienced when it is lived as nobody's world. In other words, when it is not "lived" at all, and as we shall see, when it discloses itself along with the lost of any possible lived or experienced world. The world is necessarily other with respect to the lived world (and to the life-world), and other even with respect to the "other world" in the sense of the world lived by the other (the foreign world, which still is conceived as the total horizon of the other s experience). The world as such cannot be described but as the event that interrupts worldliness in general, proper as much as foreign ("my" or "our" world as much as "your," "his," or "their" world). The world occurs when an "absolute other," so exotic and so radically other that it comes as if from no possible world, shows itself as being out-of-the-world . To put it more simply, the world purely and simply comes , absolutely, from beyond any conceivable horizon of possible experi- ence. A world worthy of the name is a world continuously and essentially suspending, bursting open the world in which existing or living beings dwell and move. How shall we understand this paradoxical determination of world as being authentically world in worldlessness? What does "world without world" mean, and more specifically, how shall we understand the conceptual operation performed by the preposition "without" in such a formulation? How does the pure coming of world (that is, the world without horizon and without world) show itself, if, as "event," it comes from beyond any condition for possible experience? Does this coming even show itself? Shall we rather describe the disclosure of world as something radically different to showing and appearing, or as something that shows itself insofar as it appears as inaccessible to experience? What figures of inaccessibility are we allowed to</page><page sequence="3">Juan Manuel Garrido • 121 invoke to describe the event of world? These are the questions this paper aims to answer. They are all, in different degrees and proportions, engaged in a discussion with major issues concerning the concept of world as worked out in Rodolphe Gasché's Europe, or the Infinite Task. 1. WORLD AS STRUCTURE OF THE SELF Before exploring the conditions for this paradoxical "world without world," we need to explain what exactly is the "world" that is lost in the experience of the "without"- that is, what is the meaning of the "world" in the second part of the formula, world without world . Only then the operation of the preposition "without," and ultimately the positive characteristics of the world without world, will acquire a precise content. World is not a thematic phenomenon, an object of consciousness. No- where in the whole world- or in the cosmos, or in the universe, in short, nowhere in the spatiotemporal totality of being- can one point at an object and say: this is the world, as we can point out things like trees, animals, mountains, stars, solar systems, unknown planets, black holes, in sum: like everything that is and appears within the world. And yet the world is not a mere ens rationis , that is, an imaginary or metaphysical concept of totality that might be presented as object for an infinite understanding. We mean something concrete and objective when we use the word "world." Specifically, we mean the unconditioned totality of beings presupposed by each singular object or set of objects. Anywhere a being appears, it coappears with the totality of potential appearing objects of experience; anywhere a being discloses itself, the world must have been previously disclosed. And this totality of being includes the subject itself of experience, the subject to whom appearing beings appear. The subject itself is also within the world, it is not detached from it nor has it any kind of preeminence. World is what is always already there, the ground on which we move, understand, know, perceive, imagine, desire, and so forth. World is the abso- lute frame of reference for any possible truth, certainty, validity, judgment, opinion, knowledge, value, and so forth. We do not choose to be or not to be in the world, and we do not choose which things and experiences compose</page><page sequence="4">122# Without World the world in which we are. We are a priori delivered to and rooted in the world. Husserl speaks of world as the object of an "original faith" ( Urglaube ). "World," he writes in section 7 of Erfahrung und Urteil , is "a universal ground of faith pre-given to any experience of singular objects" (1999, 23). This faith is "original" because it is equivalent to the very fact of being- of moving, perceiving, understanding, imagining, desiring, and so forth- in the world. Being in the world presupposes already that we are engaged in a totality of evidences that we never put in question. Later in the same text, Husserl explains: This universal ground of faith in world is what every praxis presupposes, the everyday life praxis as much as the theoretical praxis of knowing, lhe being of world in its totality is the evidence we never doubt, which is not worked out by judgments but rather constitutes the presupposition of any judgment. (25) In this sense, the "original faith" is not a mode of intentionality, a mode of consciousness- at variance with the "beliefs" that I consciously (and uncon- sciously) decide to subscribe to in my life, whether they be religious, political, scientific, or otherwise. Once again, faith in world is the very mode of being rooted in the world- or the very mode of being tout court The metaphor of being rooted often appears in descriptions of being in the world, since the world is understood as the "soil," the "ground" or "background" to which our existence pertains originally. This metaphor is naturally not an innocent one, and I think it exhibits a deep structure of Western philosophy's understanding of world. Roots are supposed to be a solid attachment to a source of nourishment and maintenance. To be rooted is to be essentially tied to what preserves life. This not only applies to beings that remain embedded in the soil from which they took rise (as in the case of plants), but in general to all living beings, from the unborn offspring rooted in its mother s womb (the umbilical cord being the analogue of a plant s roots) to the already born and "autonomous" living beings, insofar as they are tied to something they cannot do without (their progenitors, their partners, their communities, their prey, their enemies, and so forth). To be alive in whatever</page><page sequence="5">Juan Manuel Garrido • 123 sense means to be rooted in a world, whether this world is a portion of land or a forest, a lake, the ocean, the laboratory, the community, the city, the whole biosphere, or the universe. As soon as living beings are uprooted from their world, as soon as they no longer obtain response from it, they become ill and they perish. Now, to be rooted in world is not to be passively connected to some spontaneous and generous source of nourishing and care. Quite on the contrary, being rooted in the world is a consequence of being separated, of being detached, or if I may say so, of being uprooted from any spontaneous and generous source of preservation. To be rooted in the world or to be tied to an environment means to have to care for one s own preservation. Indeed, being in the world is equivalent to lack and to be in want of the necessary means for preservation; it means to be perpetually engaged in the task of procuring them. Even plants, as firmly connected to their nourishing matrix as they seem to be, are not merely passive in the task of living. For instance, they must move by themselves to reach the sun or to meet their food; they need to diversify their roots; they need to discriminate what is useful for their development from what is harmful; and so forth. This is the case no matter how "low" is the level of sensation or perception at stake. Beings that are rooted in the world are self-movers weaned from Mother Earth and thrown in the task of being and of caring for their own survival, actively connected to their environment, from which they must draw what they need. In this manner, and as paradoxical as it might sound, rootlessness is the original condition of beings rooted in the world. To be rooted in the world (to be uprooted from the inexhaustible Earth) is to be a self-mover, a being delivered to itself in the task of being. To be a "self" is not something given once and for all, but it implies the process of being delivered to oneself. To be a "self" means to be constantly self-related, to care-for-itself. Self is not substance, it is relation to itself (concern, care, etc.). "Self" does not precede, as self-subsistent identity, the movement of being delivered to itself. To come into the world, to be born, is to singularize oneself or to appropriate oneself under the mode of this relation to itself. Inversely and simultaneously, to appropriate oneself means to be thrown in the world, to be related to oneself through and by a relation to the world. Self cares for</page><page sequence="6">124# Without World itself because it "finds itself" in the middle of a world it has not created. To be a self is pure transcendence, being totally out of itself in the task of being and preserving itself. This happens, as we have seen, because self is delivered to itself as to something that essentially lacks the means for subsistence. Were the self fully connected to the generous Earth endlessly providing the means for subsistence, it would never need to appropriate itself. Self is thus constituted by a structural lack. To be delivered to itself is to be delivered to such a lack, as though, to use Aristotelian images, instead of having roots and umbilical cords connecting to Earth or to Mother Womb, self-movers were rooted to a stomach {Parts of Animals, IV, 4, 678 a 13-14; 5, 680 b 30 sq.) and thereby opened through their mouth to the world that surrounds them. Self is Hunger- physiological, psychological, metaphysical, ethical, or erotic Hunger. Hunger is not a state comparable to mere insatisfaction and organic needs that may be satisfied. Hungry selves are not in need of something that other selves possess or that they could one day possess, and that once acquired, would make them more fully themselves. Hunger is a positive condition of selves, their "transcending" structure and thus the very modality through which they dwell in the world. To be delivered to itself (to its own empty stomach) means to be out of itself (through the mouth) delivered to the world, and specifically to what in world appears to the self as what the self lacks. In fact, "world" is but the horizon of appearing opened in correlation with Hunger. Everything that "ap- pears," appears because it is seized by the self as being, by natural right, part of "its own"- that is, if I may say so, as "food" (physiological, psychological, metaphysical, ethical, or erotic food) - hence never properly recognized as other. World is the ensemble of beings that surround the self as their own things- it is what the self possesses in order to possess itself: its habitat ( from habere , habitaré). World is always the world of the self, it is my world or our world, the world of him or of them (foreign world), the world of the plant or of the bacteria. "World" is something intrinsic to the transcend- ing movement of self-appropriation of the self. Not that world is a mere projection of self, a psychotic field where self-appropriation is set out; but world, and all the appearing beings that compose it, appear insofar, and only insofar, as they are relevant and significant for self-appropriation- Hunger</page><page sequence="7">Juan Manuel Garrido • 125 being the transcendental horizon for such relevance and significance. Every appearing being in the world - including the self itself, to itself and to the other- appears in the form, in the figure, or in the image of the hungry move- ment of self-appropriation. It follows from this, as it has earlier been suggested, that whenever a self has the experience of no longer controlling nor understanding its own world; or more dramatically, whenever it has the experience of losing its own world- this might happen when "food" is no longer available, when the other upon which a self counts for existing is dead or gone, when the envi- ronment suffers unexpected changes: in sum, when the vital roots attaching the self to the world are suddenly and deeply transformed or broken up- it simultaneously has the experience of losing its own selfhood. It can no lon- ger self-appropriate, it is exposed out of itself without being able to return and to maintain a relation to itself. It is eradicated from transcendence and from being in the world. Expulsed from world and from selfhood, the self might desperately be engulfed in itself until depression and illness and de- struction, or it might succeed in understanding its new circumstances until it recovers a world. In either case, the experience of having lost the world will have occurred, that is, there will somehow have been revealed that the world and the movement of self-appropriation, since they have been lost or interrupted, may not be the most original structure of world and self, notwithstanding the fact that this experience of losing the world could later (once the self recovers the possibility of dwelling and understanding) be forgotten or foreclosed. The experience of losing the world may thus disclose an original "not having" (or not inhabiting) a world. This time, not in the mode of Hunger in the sense described above- that is, as pain of not having within the horizon of being able to have- but also having itself and its own world (inhabiting) under the very mode of this not having (lacking). To lose the world may disclose an original being-out-of-the-world, being out of the very possibility of having or not having a world. It discloses world as interrupting and with- drawing from any form of being-in and from any possible horizon for self- appropriation. It discloses world as being indifferent to self-appropriation: a world without world and without horizon.</page><page sequence="8">126 • Without World 2. THE "WITHOUT" - STRUCTURE AND THE WORLDLESSNESS OF WORLD Let us postpone the discussion of how this experience of losing the world should be described, and let us now focus on elaborating what a world "without world" means, and in particular, what does the preposition of the formula, world without world, mean. Without world, world discloses itself from beyond any horizon of possible experience. World without world is world without spacetime, without cat- egories, without environment, without territory, without land (home or for- eign land), without language, without community, without memory, without a horizon of anticipations, and so forth. Without world, world is without any condition- and only thus, in fact, is it a world worthy of its name, that is, an un-conditioned totality not contained in any previous horizon and without any other presupposition than its own and un-anticipated, un-foreseeable, un-conditioned, and im-possible coming . World without world is an event Now, for something purely and simply to come- "event" is formed from evenire , "to come out": to come out from beyond the horizon of possible experience - and being recognized as such, a field of possibility and conditionality must nonetheless be given, which is burst open and punctured by the coming. A pure coming, insofar as it is "pure," necessarily has an irruptive character and thereby implies an (inter- rupted) horizon. In other words, it comes- unforeseeable, unperceivable, impossible - insofar as it shows itself as being without a horizon of possible experience, that is, as exceeding the foreseeable, the perceivable, the possible. In his book on Europe, Gasché explains: to be recognized as an unforeseeable and radically singular event . . . the event . . . must at the same time burst open the horizon, be without a horizon, and negotiate its lack of intelligibility with some sort of horizon in order to be experienced and recognized as a singular event. (2009, 343) And earlier, in the same work:</page><page sequence="9">Juan Manuel Garrido • 127 [the event] would suppose an irruption that punctures the horizon, interrupt- ing any performative organization, any convention, or any context that can be dominated by a conventionality. . . . Without the interruption, not only of the horizonality of a theorizable world of objects, but also of the horizon of expectations, anticipations, and precomprehensions characteristic of the life-world, no event, strictly speaking, will ever be able to occur. To take one step further: without piercing the horizon, whether in the sense of episteme , or in the sense of doxa ; without bursting open the objectivist horizon of the exact sciences, or the subjectivist one of everyday beliefs, conventions, and expectations, no world worth its name- that is, no universal world- can come into being. (339) World without world, world that purely comes, does not introduce an "ex- tension" of the horizon; it does not result in the instauration or the discovery of a "new" world that would "enlarge" the already known world. But neither is this coming the mere dissolution of horizon and world. Far from being a superfluous word play, the formula "world without a horizon" or "world without a world" is an affirmative statement of the constitutive ambiguity and aporia of the experience of the world as event , which requires or sup- poses the horizon that is pierced and burst open by the coming. To quote once again Gasché: the demand to do away with the horizon is an absurdity, but as the formula of a "horizon without horizon" (or of an event without horizon) indicates, any call to puncture the horizon seeks first and foremost not only the cutting open of particular horizons . . . , but above all the cutting open of the ultimate meaning-giving horizon, the universal horizon of the world, in order for an experience of alterity to be possible, and to open the space for the unforesee- able to come. (2009, 343) The "without" in question is the phenomenon we must describe to un- derstand the specificity of the world as event. The event of the world consists in the occurrence of such a "without."</page><page sequence="10">128 • Without World It shall be clarifying to recall succinctly Derridas analyses of the preposi- tion "without" in the Kantian definition of beauty as "purposiveness without purpose" {Zweckmässigkeit ohne Zweck). Beauty is the phenomenon of some- thing that shows itself as having the form of purposiveness while the purpose itself remains indeterminate. Now, this indeterminacy of the purpose is not susceptible of being overcome, as though it were due to the ignorance of the one who contemplates the beautiful object. When an archeologist finds an ancient object that presents the form of some purposiveness ( for in- stance, a "tool" that must have been useful to something), without knowing specifically what the purpose is of such an object, we do not call it "beautiful." For an object to be considered beautiful, the absence of purpose should not depend on a simple lack of information. Purposelessness should rather be structural to purposiveness. Ihe "without" in the formula "purposiveness without purpose" has therefore not the negative meaning of a privation; it is a "without without negativity," a "without without without" (Derrida, 1978, 101-3, 108-13 ; confer, also Derrida 1986, 91-92). In fact, we may even know the purpose of some beautiful objects ( for instance, the purpose of a flower as reproductive organ of the plant), but that purpose is not considered when the object is aesthetically considered.1 Only those phenomena that show themselves as having no purpose while they present themselves as having the form of a purposiveness, only those phenomena whose purposiveness is literally interrupted and cut open by a "without purpose," may be called "beautiful." In sum, the beauty itself of the beautiful object consists neither in the sole purposive form (otherwise any purposive object would be beautiful) nor in the sole indeterminacy of the purpose (otherwise the purpose would have to be ignored for an object to be considered as beautiful). In fact, beauty is the interruption itself or the pure cut {la coupure pure) of purpusiveness, the "without" as such. Beauty is the event itself of the "without" in the purposive- ness without purpose. Now, the world comes, or is without world, exactly as in beauty, in the pure cutting of the horizon. This might be the reason why beautiful objects have been described as exotic, that is, as introducing in the world, not another world enlarging this one, but a radical outside-of-world, a pure coming that</page><page sequence="11">Juan Manuel Garrido • 129 puts us out of this world (Lévinas 1945, 84). Such an exoticism of the coming hints at a real otherness of world. In other words, the arrival of world, the suspension of horizon, must be performed by the otherness of the arrival itself; hence, it does not depend on some subjective attitude that might be required to prepare this arrival. The cutting open of the horizon cannot be produced, performed, operated- nor prepared, freed, delivered. The coming of world cannot be produced through epoché, interpreted either as the active operation of transcendental subjectivity or as a passive disinterest and let- ting be. The coming must cut, interrupt, introducing itself by force. Only thus what exceeds the possible experience- the im-possible itself, that is, what escapes to the realm of the (active or passive) "I can"- may arrive (confer. Gasché 2009, 340). World comes as other, it comes with the other or with the otherness of the other. I mean by this not "the world of the other," the world inhabited by the other, who is another self that is in the world; rather, I mean the other- ness that comes from out-of-the-world, or the exotic otherness of the world that comes from no other possible world, from no other possible "being-in," from no other inhabitable place. The other that comes, and with which world comes (without world), is thus not the other ego. Indeed, there is no ap- perception, sympathy, or empathy approaching a self to the other; there is no possible transposition to the place of the other. Likewise, the other is not the other existing self, the other Dasein. Being-with or coexisting means to share in world, that is, being in common within the same horizon (and this common world may encompass, within its "globalization," all kind of worlds, foreign and even enemy worlds, as well as all kinds of idioms, idiosyncrasies, individualities, whatever). As Heidegger writes in Being and Time : "Being- with always means being-with-one-another in the same world" (§ 47, p. 222). In this sense, we must say that the other, the other worthy of its name, has no place in the world and is radically worldless. Being with the other must sup- press and must puncture being-with in general. Being with the other must be without common horizons and without any possible modality of "with." The otherness of the other comes in as the retreat of any known figure of intersubjectivity and being-with, it comes in as the retreat of language, love,</page><page sequence="12">130# Without World ethics, politics, and so forth. The other- which only is pure coming or the coming as such- exposes us to this retreat. Only "there," in such a retreat, the world comes and is without world. The world comes where and when worldlessness reigns, where and when there is no longer any form of horizon structuring the relations between the one and the other, this "there," where there is no world, may "possibly" be the sole possible site in which the world could break into this worldlessness, and for the world to come. (Gasché 2009, 348) With the other, with its absolute coming, comes the world because world (as common horizon of experience) withdraws as the other comes. With the other, world reaches its original worldlessness. This worldlessness is obvi- ously not the pure and brutal absence of world. It is not, for instance, the worldlessness that Heidegger attributes to stones, which have not even the chance of not having the world or of losing it. This does not mean that stones cannot "comer as well, in their own peculiar way: their density, their opac- ity, their inaccessibility, and their insignificance might puncture the horizon of understanding and thereby expose a being-with without common world (confer. Nancy 2001, 99-104). The worldlessness of world is the coming of the other. Quoting again Gasché s text: Within the abyss of worldlessness we are, in Leonard Lawlor s words, "with- out alibi in relation to the others." Indeed, without the support of any ground or limits of a horizon, it is as if we were carried by the other or others (within me, or beside me) who, by their singularity, are the opening up or event of worldling. Rather than the accomplishment of a transcendental ego, the world- that is, the world in its most elementary and most universal traits- happens only with the other as an absolutely singular arrivant who, in the event of arriving, opens up the world within which I am borne toward him or her, carry him or her, and are myself carried. (2009, 348) Every time we can no longer share the world, the world arrives. This happens, for instance, in the relation opened up by the other s death, which</page><page sequence="13">Juan Manuel Garrido • 131 precisely suppresses any possible relation with the other. Certainly, one can coexist with the other dead "in terms of this world" (Heidegger 1996, 222), that is, from the world he or she has left, and in this sense still from within the "same" horizon of experience; thus when his or her dead body is physi- ologically considered as an object for medical observation, or when he or she is civically considered deceased, or when we must take care of his or her re- mains in funeral rites, mourning, and commemorating. Only when the death of the other is "without alibi" and its presence withdraws from "this world"; only when it imposes on us his or her disappearing, when it exposes itself as inaccessible "in terms of this world"; in sum, only when it is considered as the event of suppression of any relationship with the other, death leaves us without world. The other s death is thereby the singular, absolute and unique event of the end of the world (as common horizon for experience). As Derrida states, "every time death declares the end of the world in totality , the end of any possible world, and every time the end of the world as a unique , hence irreplaceable , hence infinite , totality ' (in Gasché 2009, 349). World without world is the event of the other as something to which I am radically exposed, before I am able to form an "attitude" toward it. The coming of the world- as in the death of the other, always unexpected- means that some radical passivity, a passivity I neither choose nor organize, has been actualized. "I" did not actualize such a reception- it precedes "my power" ("I can") to accept or refuse it- I rather found myself already responding to it. It is a responsibility responding to what withdraws from understanding and to any horizon of practical action, responsibility without will and responding in the form of putting me out of the world. Gasché comments: Although worldless, this responsibility for the world that has come to an end is the sole hope for there to be the world, for it to come. To carry the worldlessness that results from the disappearance of the other is precisely to carry the responsibility to and for the only world there can be. World, then, in the sense of the universal world, is a function of carrying that which, thanks to the arrival of the singular other, opened up as the world of all in all its uniqueness, but which inevitably disappeared forever with him or her. (2009, 351)</page><page sequence="14">132# Without World Death is the irruption of the world through the absolute end of the world- the "without" itself of the coming-- to the same extent as birth is the irruption of the world under the figure of the absolute (unforeseeable, unanticipated, and so forth) beginning of the world. As the dead with whom the outside-of- world comes exposing us to it, the new existing being comes from out of the world, thereby exposing us to this singular and unique coming. In death as well as in birth, the world is lost as the horizon of common experience, and we find ourselves exposed in responding to this loss. Derrida writes: With the birth of a child- the first figure of the absolute arrivant . . . there will be some one who speaks, someone irreplaceable, an absolute initiative, an- other origin of the world. Even if this initiative dissolves in analysis or returns to ashes, it remains as a clinker of absoluteness (une escarbille d'absolu) What is absolutely new is not this, rather than that; it is the fact that it arrives only once What resists analysis is birth and death: always the origin and the end of a world, (in Gasché 2009, 347) 3. SUFFERING (ANIMALITY) AS FIGURE FOR THE DISCLOSURE OF THE WORLD WITHOUT WORLD To continue the description of the pure coming of the world, or the world without world, let us add to the figures just seen (the other dead and the newborn) that of the "living being." As Heidegger claims quite enigmati- cally in his "Letter on Humanism," the living being is "the most difficult thing to understand by thinking." It is separated by "an abyss" from our ek- sisting essence. Even the essence of divinity is more accessible to us than the strangeness and "almost unthinkable corporeal commonality" ( leibliche Verwandtschaft) with living beings (2004b, 326).2 Several years earlier, in the well-known seminar of winter semester 1929-1930, Fundamental Concepts of Metaphysics, Heidegger analyzed this inaccessibility of life and of the living being in terms of their "poorness" of world. In those lectures, he compared three theses concerning the concept of world: "stones are worldless," "ani- mals (in the general sense of living beings) are poor in world," "humans are world-forming." Despite the fact these three statements concern the same</page><page sequence="15">Juan Manuel Garrido • 133 concept, the "world," each one deals with incomparable worlds. They speak of three incommensurable modes of worlding, irreducible to each other. The comparison only serves better to illuminate the radical difference that sepa- rates them. Indeed, the worldlessness of stones (nonliving beings) does not mean to be simply deprived of what animals and men have (world). Stones are worldless in the sense that they do not even have the chance of having or losing, of lacking or forming the world. The world of the animal, in its turn, is a world of lack and demand, a world of " suffering,"3 but not as an inferior "degree" of human world. Poorness, that is, "not having within the horizon of being able to have" (Nichthaben im Habenkönnen) is the mode in which animals dwell in the world (2004a, § 50, 307). In other words, we ek-sisting human beings- or any other being, even divinity- do not have what animals lack. The poorness of animals must be thought as their positive reality; it is the very way in which living beings "have" their world. Finally, and consequently, the human ek-sisting world-forming is not equivalent to the full possession of what animals lack. Since these three modes of being (and not being) in the world are incom- mensurable to each other, it is not a question for world-forming beings- I mean us, human beings- of wading through an access to poorness of world (1 a fortiori to the worldlessness of stones), for instance through some kind of empathy. Human beings are not "potentially" animals (unlike Aristotle's claim in On the Soul II, 3, 414 b 29 ss.). They cannot "live" or "experience" themselves as "pre-logical sensitivities." Were they able to do so, however, this would not mean that they reach animality. For human beings, animality is an im-possible. In other words, we do not "share" the "same" world with animals (instinct, perception, and such), we do not coexist with them (that is why cohabitation with animals always looks more like the reduction of their animality to what human we are able to understand of it). Not the least because human beings do not have the experience of poorness or suffering! But "poorness," "suffering," in human beings as well as in bears, gods, plants, or bacteria, withdraws from understanding, becomes inaccessible to truth, manifestation, and language- and to everything that "forms" the world of human ek-sisting beings. (I will say a bit more on suffering at the very end of this article.) Even more: the inaccessibility to living beings, insofar as it</page><page sequence="16">134# Without World challenges understanding and withdraws from it, insofar as it discloses it- self as im-possibility for us and thereby exposes us to the outside of world, comes , and finds us already responding to it. lhat is why animality, becomes a task for human thinking, the task of dealing with "the most difficult thing to understand by thinking." Animality is thus a figure for thinking a relation with the other "without alibi." It is in fact the very figure of alterity, of an alterity eventually much more radical than any recognizable form of alterity. It is not commensurable with the alterity of the other man ( autrui ), which will always presuppose the given- ness of the same horizon of experience (ethical, political, erotic, whatever). Animality bursts open the alterity of the fellow man, as well as all anthropo- morphic representation ( for instance, animals coexisting at home or being described by science). At the same time, animality is not other "enough" to be comparable to the alterity of the "face," by which I mean the transcendent ethical law commanding "you shall not murder." Animals- unless precisely we indulge in anthropomorphic representations, for instance assigning them rights and property (their "own" body, or their "own" habitat)- cannot be "murdered." Animality is other with regard to the whole order of human, social, ethical, and divine alterity. As Derrida states, the animal is an other without alterity, without logos , without ethic, without the power of universalizing its maxims. It can bear witness for us only for us, excessively other for being our brother or neighbor, not other enough in order to be the absolute other whose face's nudity commands "you shall not murder." (Derrida 2006, 126) That is why only with animality may be opened the dimension of any possible thought about alterity, above all in ethics: Thinking the other, the infinitely other who is looking at me, should rather privilege the call and demand coming from the animal. Not that we should give them priority in the face of the call and demand of the human, but we must think the call and demand of the human, the brother, the neighbor from the very possibility of the call and demand of the animal. (2006, 156)</page><page sequence="17">Juan Manuel Garrido • 135 Animal call and demand do not concern, of course, human understand- ing but human responsibility , that is, the receptivity or sensibility preceding any power or possibility of the self when exposed to the arrivant. Responsibil- ity for the animal is not the access to it finally reached. It is not, for instance, compassion (as mode of empathy) for the animals world of suffering. It is pure passion and exposure, being out of the world. Analyzing Jeremy Ben- tham's question about animals, "Can they suffer?,' * Derrida shows that this question- which does not inquire whether animals are in possession of this or that capacity ( dynamis , potentia , faculty), or whether they are in posses- sion of this or that manner of being ( hexis , habitus ), but whether they can be exposed without any power, possession, capacity, manner of being- might be considered already as a response to and as a passion of the inaccessibility of suffering. The question is disturbed by a certain passivity. It bears witness, manifesting already, as question, the response that testifies to a sufferance, a passion, a not-being-able. The word can 'pouvoir] changes sense and sign here once one asks "can they suffer?" The word wavers henceforth. As soon as such a question is posed, what counts is not only the idea of a transitivity or activity (being able to speak, to reason, and so on); the important thing is rather what impels it towards self-contradiction "Can they suffer?" amounts to asking "can they not be ableV And what of this inability [impouvoir]? What of the vulnerability felt on the basis of this inability? What is this nonpower at the heart of power? What is its quality or modality? How should one account for it? What right should be accorded it? To what extent does it concern us? Being able to suffer is no longer a power, it is a possibility without power, a possibility of the impossible. (2006, 49, transi. 396) "Can they suffer?": it is not properly speaking a question, because it can- not have a proper answer, that is, an answer based on possible experience. "Can they suffer?" is a response, exposition, event. "Can they suffer?" is not the matter of possible experience: no one can be in the place of who or what suffers, not even the self in the place of itself. No one can bear witness for who or what suffers. Suffering is to lose the</page><page sequence="18">136# Without World world- suffering only suffers of losing the world. Suffering has no sense or meaning, reason or destiny- suffering only suffers of not having sense, meaning, reason, destiny. What else, indeed, could be properly called suffer- ing? Suffering susceptible of overcoming its absolute senselessness - through meaning, reason, mourning, destiny, history, memory, or any other possible form of representation - would not be suffering. - &gt; NOTES This article belongs to a research project sponsored by fondecyt (Government of Chile).

Hardly anyone but a botanist knows the true na- ture of a flower, and even he, while recognizing in the flower the reproductive organ of the plant, pays no attention to this natural end when using his taste to judge of its beauty. Hence no perfection of any kind- no internal finality, as something to which the arrangement of the manifold is related- underlies this judgment" (Kant 1951, sec. 16; emphasis mine). 2. Here I reproduce the whole passage I am referring to: "Vermutlich ist für uns von allem Seiendem, das ist, das Lebe-Wesen am schwersten zu denken, weil es un einereit in gewisser Weise am nächsten verwandt und anderseits doch zugleich durch einen Ab- grund von unserem ek-sistenten Wesen geschieden ist. Dagegen möchte es scheinen, als sei das Wesen des Göttlichen uns näher als das Befremdende der Lebe-Wesen, näher nämlich in einer Wesensferne, die als Ferne unserem eksistenten Wesen gleichwohl vertrauter ist als die kaum auszudenkende abgr abgründig leibliche Verwandtschaft mit dem Tier" (Heidegger 2004b, 326). 3. "Suffering and pain [ein Leiden und ein Leid' are spread through the whole animal king- dom and life in general" (Heidegger 2004a, 393)- Years later, in a commentary on Trakl s poem "Ein Winterabend ," Heidegger writes, "everything alive is suffering [1 schmerzlich ]" (2001, 62).
