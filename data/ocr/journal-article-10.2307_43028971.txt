The study used multiple methods, content analysis of literature and content analysis of unstructured interviews, to examine architectural interpretations of architects and non-architects. Qualitative data was analyzed using a matrix-type categorization scheme. It was hypothesized that architects and non-architects would use different categorization schemes for interpreting architecture. Also, it was speculated that the range of interpretive categories for architects and non-architects would be different. Both of these expectations were confirmed. This study strengthens and expands on the research done by other researchers investigating environmental meaning including Groat (1982), Groat and Canter (1979), Kaplan (1973), and Hershberger ( 1988). The approach developed here has brought to the surface many relevant issues and important design questions that may not have otherwise been recognized.

But first, what is meant by architectural meaning? Groat (1982) says meaning is a person's internal representation of the external physical setting, having per- ceptual, cognitive, and affective components. All buildings for better (or worse) carry mean- ing. They symbolize something to the viewer of the building (Broadbent, 1977). Rapoport (in press) states that meaning is an important mechanism linking environments and people. He states, "it is important to emphasize this importance of meaning, indeed its centrality, in under- standing the built environment and material culture generally." Eco (1986) states that archi- tecture communicates at both a functional/utilitarian level and at a symbolic level. Rapoport (in press), on the other hand, also sees the importance of functional and symbolic meaning aspects of the environment but he views meaning as part of function. He sees meaning as an "important function of the built environment." Rapoport (1982) also makes a distinction between perceptual and associational aspects of en- vironmental meaning. He says (Rapoport, 1982, p. 19), "designers tend to react to environ- ments in perceptual terms, whereas the lay public, the users react to environment in associa- tional terms." The perceptual aspect is the cues which are initially noticed and their differen- ces. The associational aspect is taking the differences among the cues and developing useful links or associations. This returns us to the first issue raised: if architects and non-architects react to the environ- ment differently, what specifically are those differences? Research indicates that architects and non-architects do interpret architecture differently citing education and experience as variables contributing to these differences (Hershberger, 1988, 1973; Groat, 1979). Rapoport (1982) claims the difference is due to varying schemata existing between the two groups. Hershbergeťs (1973) research examined these varying schemata. He focused on the differen- ces in environmental meaning between architecture and non-architecture students, particularly differences in interpretations using representational meaning and those using responsive mean- ing. Representational meaning is defined as taking the form of percepts, concepts, and ideas (for example, a building symbolizing its design idea or concept), whereas responsive meaning is affective, evaluative, and prescriptive (for example, a judgmental view of liking or disliking a building). Hershberger used photographic slides to present different environments to which the architecture and non- architecture students responded. Findings revealed that the archi- tecture and non-architecture students emphasize the two meaning types differently. The archi- tecture students responded more to representational meaning, whereas the non-architect stu- dents respond more to responsive meaning. Hershberger claims this is due to differences in education between the two respondent groups. Kaplan's (1973) study examined architect/non-architect differences in environmental preference. In her study, she used a sample of architecture students, landscape architecture students, and non-design students and examined the differences between these three groups on their evaluations of environmental scenes (photographic slides). Each participant rated each photographic slide on a scale of one to five for preference. From these results, Kaplan con- cluded that architects have a preference for the person-built environment, whereas the non- design students have a preference for natural settings. The landscape architects fall some- where between these two categories. She cites these differences as a "function of area of</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 7:3 (Autumn, 1990) 237 professional interest." One limitation of both the Hershberger and Kaplan studies is the use of college students and the subsequent question of generalizability to the broader population. Groat (1982) overcame this sampling problem by using architects and accountants rather than students. She used a multiple sorting task and photographs to examine differences between architects' and non-architects' interpretations of buildings. She asked each of the forty par- ticipants (20 architects and 20 non-architects) to sort the photographs of the buildings into groups on the basis of similarities. The participants sorted the buildings into as many groups as they desired and also sorted as many times as they wished. At the end of each sort, par- ticipants were asked to label the groups. Her results showed that architects and non-architects (accountants) have different constructs for evaluating or interpreting buildings. The non- arch- itects typically used "preference" and "building type" in contrast to the architects who typically used constructs more aesthetic in nature including "form," "style," "historic significance," "design approach," and "design quality." This difference of interpretation has usually been cited as a non- architects' misinterpretation of the architect's intended interpretation. But, this may not be the case. The difference in architect/non-architect interpretations may be a result of dif- ferent classification categories used by architects and non- architects for the interpretation of architecture (Groat, 1982; Groat and Canter, 1979). This study hypothesized that architects and non-architects will have different interpretations of the two office buildings examined here - the State of Illinois Center and 333 Wacker Drive Building. One, it is expected that the construct categories of meaning used by each respondent group (i.e. architects vs. non-architects) will be different. Two, it is expected that the range of the categories used will be different for the architect and non-architect respondent groups with architects using more categories than non-architects. Also, it is expected that there will be evidence of differences for interpretations existing between the non-architect "users" and non- architect "viewers." The study presented here expands and elaborates upon these earlier studies and particularly the research of Groat (1982) in three important ways. One, in the studies cited, simulations of buildings were used. A representation of the building, such as photographs or slides, may not sufficiently simulate what can be captured by direct experience. In this study, judgments by both architects and non-architects are being made with first-hand knowledge of the buildings being investigated. Two, like Groat's (1982) study but unlike Hershberger's (1988) and Kaplan's (1973) studies, this study examines the total context of which the study of meaning is embedded by allowing the participants to freely talk about the buildings selected. Three, in past research multiple building types were used. Rather than comparing several building types, this study concentrates on one building type - the office building. Interpretive differences due to differences in building types (such as differences in meaning of residential vs. office build- ings vs. hospitals etc.) are eliminated, thus strengthening validity. This study uses the State of Illinois Center by Helmut Jahn and 333 Wacker Drive Building by Kohn Pederson Fox for case study. The two buildings were chosen because there are numerous articles written on these buildings in recent publications. Also, they were accessible to the investigator.</page><page sequence="4">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 7:3 (Autumn, 1990) 238 METHODOLOGY This study used two different methods of collecting data. An on-site unstructured interview was used to collect data assessing non-architects' interpretations of the buildings. A content analysis of architectural review and criticism was used to obtain information on the architects' interpretations about the State of Illinois Center and 333 Wacker Drive Building. Content Analysis of Architectural Reviews All articles about the State of Illinois Center and 333 Wacker Drive Building between the years of 1975 and 1987 were collected and analyzed from publications oí Progressive Architecture, Ar- chitectural Record , Architectural Design , Inland Architect , and Architecture . The dates were chosen to include present interpretation of the building and interpretive comments that may have been made during or prior to construction of the buildings. It should be noted here that the architect responses were both from architects and architectural writers. From each of the articles, all comments pertaining to interpretation were extracted and placed on separate index cards. Interpretations included comments about ideas, percepts, concepts, evaluations, prescriptions, and affect (Hershberger, 1970). Unstructured Interviews Unstructured interviews were conducted on the sites of the State of Illinois Center (SOIC) and 333 Wacker Drive Building to elicit interpretations of these buildings by non-architects. For each of the two buildings forty adult persons were interviewed. From these forty, twenty were users and twenty were viewers. Users were defined as those persons employed at the office building where the interview took place. Viewers were defined as persons not employed in the buildings, but who during the interview were within viewing distance of the building. Viewers were asked if they had ever been in the building. Forty persons sampled for each building was seen as sufficient. Since qualitative analysis usually has to do with many more parameters of a case or setting than does quantitative analysis, the sampling size is usually smaller (Huberman and Miles, 1985). This study aimed at examining the many aspects of architectural interpretation. It examined two cases. Questions about meaning and interpretation of these buildings were asked in an unstructured interview format. The hope was to spur conversation about architecture and let the inter- viewee lead the conversation in the direction she or he desired. Questions were pretested at a site other than the two sites in the study. After refinement, a second interview was pretested to finalize the interview format and enhance construct validity. This final pretesting took place at the SOIC and 333 sites. The questions (after a short intro- duction to the study) included: "Why don't you start by telling me what you think of this build- ing," "Describe your favorite characteristic or feature," "Describe your least favorite charac- teristic or feature," and "If you could, what would you change about the building or would you leave it as it is?" This usually initiated conversation about the building. Conversations lasted approximately ten to fifteen minutes.</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 7:3 (Autumn, 1990) 239 FIGURE 1. Categories used by each Respondent Group for each of the two buildings. Other pertinent data was collected during the interview including: if the interviewee was a user or viewer; for viewers, whether they knew the name of the building; if employed in the building, for how long; age and gender of the interviewee; and time and date of the interview. Interviews occurred over two weekdays and one Saturday to include all possible persons that may use the area. Interviews occurred outside the buildings at different times of the day from 9 a.m. to 6 p.m. to increase generalizability within the study. After interviewing, respondents' comments were placed on index cards, similar to that done for the content analysis of the literature. Data Analysis There were two sets of data: one set from the content analysis representing the architect respondent group and one set from the un- structured interviews representing the non- architect respondent group. Qualitative data analysis using a matrix-type categorization scheme (Miles and Huberman, 1985) was used to analyze both sets. Matrices are a "function- al" way to organize large amounts of informa- tion without losing pieces of the data (Miles and Huberman, 1985). Since this study col- lected a large amount of diverse data this method seemed appropriate. The qualitative analysis began by examining the responses of architects and non-architects separately. Each respondent types' responses was sorted into categories by the investigator based on Groat's (1982) construct categories. (See Figure 1) Although responses appeared to be similar for SOIC and 333, the data was further subdivided into a three-way matrix repre- senting respondent group, building, and constructs to detect minor differences between the two office buildings. The matrix scheme was developed from a simple matrix to a more com- plex matrix and then reiterated several times to identify all possible pieces of information (Huberman and Miles, 1985). Throughout this categorization process, constructs were defined and redefined. To maximize validity and reliability, a non- architectural colleague was asked to sort the data and place the cards into a category scheme of her own choosing. Next, she re-sorted and placed the data into the categories previously established by the investigator. These two categorization tasks: 1) provided further refinement of the categories, 2) provided possible ne categories not previously recognized, and 3) provided interjudge reliability (.86) for the clas- sification sort of the Groat- established categories.</page><page sequence="6">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 7:3 (Autumn, 1990) 240 FINDINGS Differences in Categorization Schemes With only slight modifications, Groat's (1982) construct category list proved to be beneficial. The range of responses made by both architects and non-architects fit into and support her es- tablished categories. All comments made by architects and non- architects, with regard to in- terpretation, fit into one of the 22 (out of 27 original) categories. A few of the original categories were not used including: "location/density," "difficulty in design execution," "age," and "by architect." One category was added by the investigator, "site" and one category was modified, "imagined use/form." Two of the original categories, "location/geography" and "relation to environment," although similar, are not the same. "Location/geography" refers to comments made to the surrounding features; for example, "the building is afforded great sky exposure (comment about 333)." "Relation to environment" is the way the building fits into the context of its surrounds beyond its site lines; for example, "eclectically futuristic, it stands in tense relationship with its more traditional neighbors (comment about SOIC)." "Site" was added to include comments about the building within the boundaries of its property. "Site" becomes a relevant category when using on-site interviews because people "see" the building in its context. The "imagined use" category was modified to read "imagined use and related form." This was modified because there were some respondents who spoke of an imagined use, but always at- tached an imaginary physical form to this use. For example, "the backside looks like a grade school from the ' 50s (comment from SOIC)." The "mixed criteria" category was eliminated. If two or more categories were represented in one conversation or one article (as was almost always the case) the different comments were distributed in their respective category. Recall a colleague was asked to sort the data into categories which she felt appropriate (prior to looking at the established categories derived from Groaťs categories). This was done to provide some reliability for the categories used by the investigator. It was a check to see if some unidentified categories might be recognized. It was interesting to note that she chose seven broad categories, which were similar to the pre-established categories in this study. They were "preference," "location," "material," "color," "technical," (including "lighting" and "energy"), "look" (including "style," "design approach," and "historical significance") and "site" (including "site," "geography/location," and "relation to environment"). Range of the Categorization Scheme Next, it was examined how the groups responded differently. In agreement with Groaťs (1982) study, most architects responded to what she termed "aesthetic" qualities. Architects discussed issues of "form," "style," "historic significance," "design approach," and "design quality." Also in agreement to Groat's (1982) study, non-architects used "preference" as a dominant category. Unlike Groaťs (1982) findings, "building type" was an unused category but that is explained by the fact that only one building type is examined in this present study. Architects used a slightly broader range of categories than did non-architects to interpret arch- itecture. Architects used a total of 20 categories, whereas the non-architects used 16</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 7:3 (Autumn, 1990) 241 categories. Architects used 15 categories for 333 and 19 categories for SOIC, whereas non- architects used 13 categories for 333 and 14 categories for SOIC (see Figure 1). Architects tended to interpret architecture in terms of conceptual issues. Categories of "his- toric significance," "design quality," "anthropomorphism," and "form/function" were used ex- clusively by architects. Architects' most frequently used categories were "relation to environ- ment," "form," "historic significance" for SOIC and "building detail," "material," and "relation to environment" for 333. Architects did not use the categories "preference" and "familiarity" to describe either of the two buildings and did not use the categories "location/geography" for SOIC and "building type," "potential involvement," "form/function," "energy," and "lighting" for 333. Most comments made by non-architects for both SOIC and 333 fit into the affective category - "preference." (This category was never used by architects for both SOIC and 333.) This sup- ports Groaťs (1982) research findings that non-architects use the "preference" construct predominantly. The next most frequently used categories for non-architects included "building detail" and "size" for SOIC and "building details," "color," and "materials" for 333. Overall, non-architects gave more affective responses and descriptive responses to the physical features of the building, whereas architects commented more on ideas and concepts used to ar- rive at the physical forms. This is consistent with Hershberger's (1973) finding which found the architect used representational meaning more whereas the non-architect used responsive meaning more when interpreting architecture. One category, "building detail," was examined closely. This category was chosen because it was the largest category of both respondent groups combined. By looking at this category separately, different ways of interpreting architecture within a construct group might be iden- tified. Possible differences not recognized in the larger categorization scheme might be recog- nized. Upon examination of this data: 1) both respondent groups' comments on building detail were made at all scales or sizes although the non-architects commented more on small scale detail, for example, stair treads and window shades and 2) non-architects responses to detail seemed to be those items familiar to the respondent; for example, the 333 stair treads were too slick or the SOIC elevators were slow. In other words, concern for detail was expressed by non-archi- tect "users" of the building. For example, an employee at 333 commented extensively on the lobby: she expressed it as "a cold environment and non-inviting". (It was interesting that al- though the interview took place on the exterior of the building, she talked about interior aspects of the building which she had experienced.) Although, not conclusively tested here, familiarity and experience of the environment seem to be important components of archi- tectural interpretation. It appeared that users spoke of "building detail" at a smaller scale. Next a category used predominantly by the non-architect "user" group was examined. This was "energy." This category was seldom used by the architects or the non-architects "viewer". But, for both buildings, it was noted several times by non-architect "users". They expressed problems of heating, air-conditioning, and ventilation. These problems appeared to have a direct effect on how the building was being interpreted. In one example, an employee from SOIC, talked about energy. He said, "with the technology that it took to construct this building, it would seem that they could provide comfortable heating and air- conditioning." The conver- sation never advanced from this topic - it appeared to be a major concern in his interpretation.</page><page sequence="8">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 7:3 (Autumn, 1990) 242 Several other employees of the upper floors of SOIC spoke of ventilation problems. This sug- gest that familiarity with architecture has an influence on one's interpretation of it. SUMMARY In summary, Groaťs (1982) construct category list for interpretation of architecture has been shown to be an inclusive list, with the exception of the additional category "site." As expected, the ways in which the respondent groups interpret architecture within these categories differ. The architects use a slightly larger range of categories and some different categories to judge architecture than do non-architects. The responses of the architects and non-architects point to the differences also suggested in Hershberger's study - a difference between types of inter- pretation or reacting to representational meaning versus responsive meaning. Although there may be concerns with reliability based on the methodological approach used here, I think the benefits of such a study outweigh these possible concerns. The interviews provided much insight into how people, outside the architecture profession, interpret and "see" architecture. They allowed participants the opportunity to express their "feelings" on archi- tecture beyond the confines of a structured questionnaire. Structured questions with pre-es- tablished answers or response scales can provide an investigator bias which is inherent in the structure of the question s/he sets up. An investigator may come to the study with a precon- ceived notion of what the answer may be and by structuring the questions, these preconceived notions may influence and bias the writing of the questions and subsequent answers given by the interviewee. An unstructured interview approach also allows the interviewee to talk freely about his/her concerns for the building. The qualitative data analysis allowed the opportunity to examine all pieces of the data - both of the content analysis of the literature and the unstructured interviews. Nothing was omitted. This approach brought relevant issues and other undefined research problems to the surface that may not have otherwise been recognized. As pointed out here and in other studies, archi- tect/non-architect differences may be due to the different categorization schemes possessed by the respondent groups and used in their subsequent interpretations. But are these differences a result of purely different categorization schemes or are they a result of the different respondent's emphasis placed on each of the categories? Here, it appears that architects have used all the non-architects categories with the exception of "preference." (The category "familiarity" was used only once by non-architects.) The non- architects' categories are nested in the architects' categories. As Hershberger (1988) states, the relative dominance of the categories may be the important factor in architectural communication. These findings seem to suggest this. If we acknowledge a difference due to relative dominance then how do we examine the issue? It seems that the issue of non- architects' "preference" category should be targeted. We need to understand exactly why or why not certain architectural structures are liked or disliked. This may give some insight into how the other categories are weighted in the overall categorization scheme; then some comparisons can be made back to the architects' categorization scheme. Yet, these findings as they stand do have possible design ramifications. They suggest that more emphasis should be placed on architects understanding non-architects' categories such as "building detail," "size," "color," and "material" but not at the elimination of the architects estab- lished concerns. To create "better" architecture we must understand both the interpretations</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Architectural and Planning Research 7:3 (Autumn, 1990) 243 of the architects and the non-architects and also these respondent groups similarities and dis- similarities. In sum, this study has built upon and confirmed the notion of architect/non-architect differen- ces when interpreting architecture. These differences are both a result of the categorization schemes emphasized by each respondent group and of the relative dominance of the categorization schemes used by each respondent group. The study points to important future research needs including a closer examination of each of the categories of interpretation and their importance in the overall interpretation scheme.
