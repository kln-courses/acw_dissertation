Environmental Protection Agency Introduction On March 20, 2009, the D.C. Circuit held that the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) definition of "natural event" as used in the Clean Air Act's (CAA) exceptions to air quality monitoring standards was not subject to judicial review,1 nor were statements in the final rule's preamble reviewable.2 The court found that the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) could not challenge the final rule for three reasons. First, NRDC's comment to the proposed rule failed to adequately specify the portion of the proposed rule it was arguing against, and thus the objection was unreviewable.3 Second, the court held that the preamble was insulated from review because it used conditional and equivocal language.4 Finally, the statements in the preamble were not ripe for review because NRDC failed to show the statements had immediate legal or practical consequences.5 I. Exceptional Events Since 1977, EPA regulations have documented the need for a flagging system for air quality monitoring data affected by "exceptional events."6 A 2005 amendment to the CAA required the EPA to promulgate regulations governing such exceptional events.7 In the amended statute, Congress defined "exceptional event" as an event that Copyright © 2010 by the Regents of the University of California. 1.

Opinion and Dissent in NRDC v. EPA Judge Randolph, writing for the D.C. Circuit, found NRDC's challenges to the EPA's final rule unreviewable due to NRDC's failure to satisfy the CAA's exhaustion requirement and to meet threshold requirements of justicibility.15 Judge Rogers, writing in dissent, believed NRDC had met its burden regarding the exhaustion requirement and thus would test the validity of the "natural event" definition.16 She concurred with the court's justiciability determination.17 Concerning the exhaustion requirement, the majority reasoned that NRDC's challenge to the final rule was unreviewable since NRDC had not raised with "reasonable specificity"18 its definitional objection during public comment.19 The court reasoned that NRDC merely objected to the 8.

First, statements in the final rule's preamble—which NRDC argued were impermissible examples of per se exceptional events—did not amount to final agency action since the preamble used conditional language in the contested statement.26 Specifically, the use of the word "may" instead of "will" decisively signaled that the statements were merely general statements of policy instead of binding legal requirements.27 Second, the court held that the preambular statements about exceptional events were not ripe for review since the statements were "hypothetical and non-specific."28 NRDC did not persuade the court that any of the statements had direct or immediate 20.

Analysis: Natural Events, Exceptional Events, and the Increasing Risk to Public Health In implementing the CAA, the EPA's highest priority is protecting public health.33 The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) ostensibly help achieve this priority by penalizing states containing nonattainment areas.34 The consequences for nonattainment could include loss of narrowly proscribed federal highway funds or stricter emissions requirements for the area's industries.35 Certainly there are events—both natural and anthropomorphic—for which it is reasonable, even necessary, to exclude emissions data when evaluating a region's compliance with the EPA's air quality standards. But the final rule now governing exceptional events, taken in part from Congress's legislation, boldly expands the definition of natural events and exceptional events without adequately addressing public health risks—which do not disappear simply because of changes in terminology. The consequences from this decision would have been less severe if the EPA had required states to issue public notifications upon an occurrence of an exceptional event. The EPA has backtracked and has been inconsistent on public health risk mitigation plans related to exceptional events. Originally, the EPA was going to require states, as a condition of excluding emissions data, to submit documentation on 29. Id. 30.

While local government actors may be adequately responsive and knowledgeable about measures to be taken to protect public health, the basic requirement that mitigation plans be submitted—adding an important layer of process, and thus, to some degree, creating disincentives for non-essential anthropomorphic sources of pollution—is paramount. Under this final rule, it is possible for clean-up activities to occur and exceed the NAAQS, for a year or more, without consequence and without any oversight of public health protections. Additionally, it would be more consistent with the EPA's statutorily mandated priorities to attach public health requirements to exceedences of exceptional events, particularly clean-up activities, as a way to protect public health and to better ensure that frivolous clean-up activity is less likely to occur. If the NAAQS carry the lofty goal of measuring the level at which certain kinds of pollution become intolerable to human health, the current regulation of exceptional events undermines this pursuit. In order for expediency and practicality to coexist with public health protections, greater oversight of states' actions pursuant to NAAQS exceedences endangering public health needs to exist. Conclusion Since the court did not decide NRDC's main challenge to the final rule on the merits, uncertainty remains as to the viability of the definition, particularly when challenged on an as-applied basis. If and when the EPA classifies actual clean-up activity associated with a natural disaster as a natural event, litigation is sure to follow. Looking at the statute's plain meaning, it is hard to imagine a single natural disaster— such as a hurricane, and twelve months of cleanup—as a single and 36.
