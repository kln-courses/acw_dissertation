<plain_text><page sequence="1">Architecture against the State The Virtues of Impermanence in the Kibulu of Eastern Pende Chiefs in Central Africa Z. S. STROTHER University of California, Los Angeles y the late 1980s, although most Eastern Pende chiefs from the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) lived in homes of adobe brick, they were still required to make their official residence (kibulu) a small domed house built from reed, bark, or other vegetal mate- rials (Figure 1). In 1987, the prosperous Chief Mbuambua announced that he intended to construct his next kibulu out of concrete blocks with a tin roof, as he was tired of the peri- odic rebuilding that a thatched structure entailed. Chief Mbuambua was probably joking, but his announcement raised genuine consternation in the population because local law decrees that no one may repair the kibulu in any way once it has been erected. A well-maintained thatched roof has a life of twenty years or more; however, without steady upkeep, it rarely lasts more than twelve. Most com- munities rebuild the kibulu every decade in ceremonies cul- minating in days of masquerades. Chief Mbuambua's people told him that the kibulu must remain short-lived. The refusal to build in permanent materials, the refusal to strive for immortality in building, raises unsettling ques- tions for the architectural historian. In the Euro-American context, monumental scale and durable materials have been used to justify claims to universal and timeless meaning.' The concept of impermanence has been difficult to encom- pass in the discipline because it challenges reigning models of interpretation and in some instances the definition of architecture itself. It renders highly problematic any quest to isolate the originary moment, the architect's intention, since the building's planned obsolescence overwhelms any metanarrative of progress. Accordingly, impermanence shifts the subject of analysis from the individual work to its social context. It also has the potential to shift analysis from architect to builder and from builder to issues of reception. As the contest over Mbuambua's kibulu suggests, imperma- nence may sometimes point to struggles over meaning among builders, viewers, and users. Although all these issues have preoccupied architec- tural historians for some time,2 impermanence holds spe- cial saliency for Africanists. In 1974, in the first article on indigenous sub-Saharan African forms to appear in the JSAH, Labelle Prussin argued that it was precisely the belief that "monumentality and permanence are prerequisites to architectural definition" that had inhibited serious analysis of the built environment in Africa.3 Few writers since have been willing to confront these issues. Certainly, monumen- tal complexes exist, such as Great Zimbabwe or the eleven rock-hewn churches of Lalibela in Ethiopia, which date to the late twelfth through thirteenth century. We have also learned that the regular maintenance of adobe can preserve structures for centuries, as in the Malian city of Djenne. Nonetheless, the emphasis on durable materials will exclude from discussion most of the historical built environment on the continent. In this essay, I consider architectural impermanence as a political strategy rather than as a failure of materials. In the provocative book Society against the State, political</page><page sequence="2">Figure 1 Once the Eastern Pende chief's house (kibulu) is completed, the law forbids maintenance or repairs. The only documented exception entailed the propping up of tilting exterior walls with logs. Kipoko, DRC, May 1987 anthropologist Pierre Clastres argues that European polit- ical theorists from Friedrich Nietzsche to Max Weber have been unable to conceptualize political power "apart from its predicate: violence." However, this position misrepre- sents social relationships in the "vast constellation of soci- eties in which the holders of what elsewhere would be called power are actually without power; where the political is determined as a domain beyond coercion and violence, beyond hierarchical subordination; where, in a word, no relationship of command-obedience is in force." Clastres struggles against the conviction that "society is inconceiv- able without the State."4 Rather than representing all social alternatives as incomplete states (whether failed or embry- onic), he instead proposes to take seriously-as a product of choice, decision, and intention-the strategies by which many societies have actively thwarted the development of coercive authority.5 Although Clastres' representation of Amazonians can seem ahistorical, he makes the critical observation that societies may use ideology to subvert the consolidation of despotic power as much as to promote it. In the case of the Pende, several historians have argued that opposition to state structures and centralized authority is a deep-rooted cultural trait that has shaped their history over the past several hundred years.6 Twentieth-century oral history attributes Pende origins to small groups who fled incorporation into Queen Njinga's and other predatory Angolan states in the seventeenth century. These groups moved north to form small, autonomous chiefdoms on the savanna of what is today south-central DRC and are known for their tendency to split periodically into lineage seg- ments. Although colonial and postcolonial regimes have layered state structures over these autonomous chiefdoms, local practice has continued to undermine the consolida- tion of local power. Sikitele Gize documents that such resentment of authority provoked continual contestation of chiefs' appointments during the colonial period.' Although the Belgian colonial authorities suppressed divisions within communities with difficulty, a great many chiefdoms frac- tured after independence in 1960, particularly among the Eastern Pende. Sikitele8 wrote in 1986 that the situation can become so extreme that "all political life in certain chiefdoms boils down ... to the contestation of power of the paramount chief."9 Certainly, postcolonial dictatorships have not reduced local tensions by imposing models of coercive power that some young chiefs seek to emulate. Clastres argues that chieftaincy can be divorced from coercion when "power" roots itself in prestige, persuasive- ness, and a reputation for fairness. According to his model for decentralized societies in Amazonia, "despite his lack of authority, the chief enjoy[ed] an enviable social status." He was first and foremost a peacemaker and orator, charged with the impossible task of keeping the community together, held to exacting standards of generosity. He was remunerated in wives and deference and was closely watched for signs of authoritarianism.10 All of this was equally true for the Eastern Pende chief in the 1980s, who, ARCHITECTURE AGAINST THE STATE 273</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2 Before 1960, Chief Kombo-Kiboto was one of only a handful of Eastern Pende chiefs who enjoyed the right to build a kibulu with a dome-on-square plan and anthropomorphic statuary. Ndjindji, DRC, 1953 moreover, was supposed to serve as ritual intermediary between the living and the dead. Because he was dressed and housed differently from everyone else, and because the Eastern Pende treated the office with respect, it was easy to overlook the fact that the chief was seldom able to issue a direct order unless first securing consensus among his advis- ers or, for weighty issues, among the population at large in public meetings." However, not all chiefs wished to play by the rules. Quite a few craved political power in order to exact taxes and make unilateral decisions. In short, they wished to turn a ritual role into a political one. In this article, I examine the Eastern Pende chief's house, drawing on in-depth interviews and observation of three building campaigns in Kombo-Kiboto, Nzambi, and Kende, that took place between 1987 and 1988. In addition, documentation of a rare renewal of a chief's house among the Central Pende in Pidi-Samba in 1989 provides impor- tant regional contrast. Different kibulu emerged from these sources. There was the kibulu shaped and regulated by rit- ual specialists; the kibulu as imagined and experienced by the chief (not always the same thing); the kibulu perceived by the people; the kibulu known to neighbors and Pende tourists. It is an apt illustration of Dell Upton's assertion: "Once introduced into the landscape, the identity of a building and the intentions of its makers are dissolved within confusing patterns of human perception, imagina- tion, and use. . . . Every structure contains several different buildings as imagined by different segments of its public.""12 Depending on the perspective of the speaker, the kibulu existed simultaneously as portal between worlds; as marker of unique social status; as container for secret weapons. To understand fully why Mbuambua's people rejected a kibulu made from concrete, it is necessary to explore the dialecti- cal tension between the ritual and the political that threads through these competing images of the chief's house. In the end, the kibulu's ephemeral nature, its legislated decay, is revealed as a strategy to curtail political ambition. The Kibulu and Impermanence The kibulu is one of the last examples of the sculpted chief's house (Figures 2, 3), once a widespread architectural form spanning many societies in what is today central Angola and southwestern DRC.13 Interviews from the 1980s suggest some of the issues relevant to the kibulu's historical devel- opment, although all such extrapolations are likely to remain speculative. For the Eastern Pende, the oldest his- torical records of the form date to 1905. At that time, the German traveler Leo Frobenius found that most people constructed their houses on a rectangular or square plan with pitched roof (Figure 4). He was charmed by chiefs' houses, which he found strikingly different: "The chiefly dwelling is apparently always built in square style. The old buildings of this structure were everywhere the same. ... The roof of the house resembles a mighty bell" (Figure 5). He sketched the same baffled site plan in use in the 1980s (Figure 6) and remarked on its "snail's opening" as well as the "awning" in the middle of the courtyard. Crit- ically, Frobenius also documented that he saw many kibulu in "ruins,"'14 the significance of which I discuss below. 274 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="4">Figure 3 One of the sculpted panels next to the door of the kibulu of Chief Kombo-Kiboto (Mukanzo Mbelenge).

Technically, Chief Ngulungu is subordinate to Kombo-Kiboto; however, he lives a great distance from his superior and was granted the privilege of building a kibulu in recognition of his service during the Chokwe war in the late nineteenth century. The freestanding statuette of an animal next to the door may have been an innovation to honor Ngulungu while reserving for his superior the right to mount rooftop statuary. ARCHITECTURE AGAINST THE STATE 275</page><page sequence="5">Figure 7 Chief Kindamba's kibulu, built in June 1987 next to the ruins of his previous house, which serve as a memento mori. Kindamba, DRC, 1988 Drawings and photographs from 1905 to the present demonstrate that the shape of the kibulu and its site plan have remained consistent even while its sculptural adorn- ment has changed continuously. Before the colonial era, all Pende built in vegetal mate- rials, which facilitated the frequent relocation of villages fol- lowing the death of a chief or in response to impoverishment of the soil. A house was very much identi- fied with its owner and would be abandoned and usually burned following the individual's death for fear of others coming into contact with the lingering spirit of the deceased." In order to combat sleeping sickness, the colo- nial state moved villages away from streams and regrouped them into larger units on top of the plateaus in the savanna. For purposes of better surveillance, the state also required people to build along roads and forbade them from chang- ing locations. Most Central and Eastern Pende villages were successfully relocated between 1920 and the early 1930s and have remained in more or less the same place for over sev- enty years. After independence, there were few changes despite the fact that women now must undergo arduous journeys to farm and fetch water. With this taste for seden- tary life a preference to build in more permanent materials has developed. As early as 1963, the geographer Henri Nicolai com- mented on the growing homogeneity of villages with thatched houses built increasingly in pis6 (rammed earth).'16 By the 1980s, wealthier Pende aspired to adobe brick or concrete block with tin roofs and ceilings made from slats of palm bamboo. These houses are inherited if they are in a good state of repair, and rituals have developed for indi- viduals who are anxious to expel the spirit of the departed that do not entail destroying the house. This transformation in living patterns highlights stric- tures governing the kibulu: no maintenance is ever allowed and the kibulu is never destroyed, even after the chief's death, but is permitted to decay naturally." Although the building is ritually of great importance, it must always be constructed of vegetal materials. When it is replaced, the chief is required to build alongside the ruins of his former houses (Figure 7). A number of contradictions manifested in the kibulu explain this insistence on-indeed appreciation of-impermanence. The Kibulu and Its Ritual Significance The kibulu is the house for a great chief (fumu ya mbandji), whom the Eastern Pende define as one who owes no one else tribute. An elected figure, he inherits this status by rep- resenting the original landowners in the region or the old- est chiefdom within a clan. He usually lives on his own land, which he makes available to other, subordinate chiefs. Every chief, regardless of station, must have a building where he can perform certain rituals critical for the lin- eage(s) under his protection; however, only a great chief has the right to a kibulu, with its sculptural adornment and domed roof (see Figures 2, 3). Therefore, the distinctive form of the kibulu immediately raises questions as to the 276 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="6">nature of the relationship of ritual to status in its plan and realization. Anyone posing questions about the Pende chief's house will be referred to acknowledged experts on the affairs of the dead. These individuals come from the ranks of chiefs, their advisers, blacksmiths, and nganga (ritual specialists), but it is the rare individual who attains the reputation of exegete, able to interpret the meanings of religious symbols or expound ceremonial law. These men gain their renown during public meetings at moments of crisis (for example, during the election of a chief), when they are able to clarify a problem through knowing expositions of historical texts (songs), proverbs, or ritual. Their knowledge is the prod- uct of long years of study and travel and is usually only dis- pensed to others through apprenticeship. In my case, after about sixteen months in the field, certain individuals with whom I had established relationships (whom I will call "rit- ual specialists" for the sake of convenience) were willing to provide exegesis of the kibulu and the rituals surrounding its construction.18 While their emphasis on the chiefs house as a site of ritual praxis carries all the authority of an official interpretation, observation of chiefs' practice considerably complicates this perspective. Ritual specialists interpret the kibulu as first and fore- most the "house of the dead" (inzo ya vumbi), closely asso- ciated with the well-being of the kijfutshi, the environmental microcosm necessary to the survival of any community. This microcosm includes the village or town, its people and domestic beasts, the fields, and the grasslands and forests, with their game animals. On the day of construction, the chief, his ministers, and a few trusted helpers rise before dawn, in total darkness, to plant the central post (muhandji). First they dig a hole, referred to as the "belly" of the house.19 In June 1988, after depositing millet and other seeds crucial to Pende agriculture, Chief Nzambi20 offered the following prayer: "You are the center post of the house, you are the village with its people, fields, and forest. We have given you all these seeds for cultivation so that you may grip the earth as the seeds [roots] grip the earth over there [in the fields]. All seeds grow, may you grow [as] the seeds grow, so that the women may give birth, so that the children may give birth, so that there may be a lot of palm wine, so that the hunters may kill [their prey] with their guns."21 Although Nzambi used the rhetorical convention of addressing the post, his prayer was directed to his matri- lineal ancestors. Nzambi also described the center post as a "granary" that "conserves and protects" all the seed needed for cultivation. The act of burying representative seeds under the pole in the center of the house puts the life of the village under the protection of the dead. If the kibulu is a granary, indeed, a "house of seed" (inzo ya mbuto), the figure of the center post is rich in both anthropomorphic and arboreal symbolism. The center post of the kibulu is called the "heart of the village." However, the verticality of the post can evoke the image of the chief himself. When asked why the minister gives it a cap of mud covered by leaves, Nzambi was reminded of the chief-elect, whose liminal status is marked by a special hat. Sh'a Mukenza, first minister to Kende, compared the cap to the coil of cloth used to soften the friction of carrying a burden on the head and remarked that earth mixed with spring water serves as a medicine promoting coolness and gentle- ness. In his view, the center post expresses a vision of the chief comporting himself with grace under pressure.22 On another occasion, Nzambi interpreted the post as a figure of the chief's wife, under whose special charge agrarian rites fall. Kende argued that "the kibulu is the original panzu."23 In folklore, panzu is the tree to which criminal sorcerers tie the shadows of their victims and around which they hold their nefarious nocturnal banquets. Most sorcery practices are believed to involve perversions of objects intended for good purpose. Sh'a Mukenza explained that the center post is like the sorcerers' tree because it "ties together" the lives of everyone in the community, here including the deceased as well as the living. In this case, the interior view of the center post joined to the ribs of the roof is reminiscent of a tree with its branches. The minimalist form of the center post invites multi- ple readings by its association with various properties.24 As a vertical pole with a "cap," it evokes the figure of the chief. As a vertical terminating in a "belly" of seed, it points to the womb, or the chief's wife. As a trunk sprouting branches, it conjures the image of a shade tree able to attract lone indi- viduals and transform them into a community. As one house among many, it locates the heart of the village. The chief, his first wife, and her children live with the center post on a daily basis. For most people, however, it remains only an imagined reference point screened from sight by the walls of the kibulu. It is the kibulu door that is the focus of intense concern on the part of the community. No one may call to someone inside the building for fear that something unexpected might emerge. Conscientious chiefs will not close their door at night until they are rea- sonably certain that their villagers have safely returned home. The anxiety is that if the chief locked his door pre- maturely, anyone traveling abroad might not be able to find the village at night. There is a strict rule that the door must stay wide open during all communal hunts, from beginning to end.25 In this case, the open door serves two seemingly contrary purposes. The kibulu is likened to a "corral" and ARCHITECTURE AGAINST THE STATE 277</page><page sequence="7">Figure 8 Chief Ndalakhulu and his ritual house. The houses of subordinate chiefs, which vary widely from region to region, are always differentiated from the kibulu. Near the Kasai River, rectangular houses with doors on the short end predominate. Chief Ndalakhulu is subordinate to Chief Kindamba (see Figure 7). Kipoko, DRC, 1988 sometimes called the "house of meat" (inzo ya mbiji). Through its portal, the dead can send game animals to nourish their descendants. However, if animals come out, there is concern that their hunters might be trapped inside the fires used in communal hunts. As renowned healer Mukishi Loange explains: "The kibulu of the chief [is] the center of the fire. [Open the door] so that the animals enter [into the bush], so that the people may encircle them in order to kill them. The animals stay with the dead. We ask the dead to release the animals."26 If the chief closes his door, he will be accused of "blocking" the animals from entering the savanna and of endangering the hunters by shutting them inside the fire or by preventing them from escaping ferocious beasts. As the kibulu shelters a portal to the other world, it is not surprising that the purity of the conduit should be a pre- occupation. The commission of adultery by the chief or his wife can spread contagion throughout the community in the embers that women share to rebuild fires. Individual families may develop special precautions, such as barring menstruating women or toddlers (who might urinate on the floor) from the house. Since each community develops rules to safeguard the structure from pollution, the kibulu is com- monly described as a "house of prohibition" (inzo ya kijila) to be avoided by the uninitiated. The Eastern Pende chief exists first and foremost as a priest safeguarding the conduit through which the dead send grain, game animals, and children to their descendants. In exegesis, the kibulu emerged as an intensely religious space-the house of the dead, the house of seed, the house of meat. However, after the planting of the center post, another kibulu also took shape. Observation of the emo- tional investments of the chiefs directing-or trying to direct-the construction revealed the kibulu also as aesthetic object, as a surface marked by the chief's desire for individ- ual distinction and social privilege. The Kibulu as Aesthetic Object The shape of the kibulu, dome over square plan, is rare in Africa.27 The building program reveals that this fact is keenly appreciated by Eastern Pende chiefs and relates to issues of both aesthetics and prestige (Figure 8). The plan is based on a square roughly three meters on each side. Ide- ally, the center pole also stands approximately three meters high. From the center pole, the roof tapers down to the walls in a dome. The door is set off by a deep and narrow vestibule, projecting outward as far as a meter (Figure 9). In order to achieve a graceful dome, it is important that the building be square in plan. To ensure that the proper form was realized, Chief Nzambi took over this part of the construction. He measured some sticks against the height of the center post and laid them on the ground in order to trace a square centered on the axis of the post. He based the height of the walls on the distance from the center post to the center of the outside wall. A uniform height for the wall posts was easily achieved by adjusting their depth in the sandy soil. His work team drove thirty-one posts into the 278 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="8">Figure 9 Constructing the kibulu of Chief Nzambi (Kibunda a Kilonda). Ndjindji, DRC, June 1988 ground, leaving a space in the back for the secret door that would be used during the funeral of the chief or his wife. Although Nzambi was unusually scrupulous in calcu- lating the dimensions of his house, many of the proportions are gauged by eye, as Andrd Ombredane noted generally for the construction of Pende houses.28 Ombredane docu- mented the construction of a square house with pyramidal roof with four slopes in which the plan was traced on the ground by laying out two laths of palm bamboo on each side about six centimeters apart. He noted that even without tools, the square was optically satisfying with corners close to ninety degrees.29 The builders drove the wall posts into the ground between the parallel laths. After this point, everything was judged in relationship to the standing mem- bers. The height of the roof was calculated by a man sitting on a temporary crossbeam. His torso and raised arm estab- lished the apex of the roof,30 at roughly three meters. In the case of the kibulu, the center post is usually the element from which all others are oriented. The kibulu's regular-if approximate-dimensions of three meters square and three meters high raise the specter of numerology. Although the meter holds no local signifi- cance, it is likely that the standard length of an oil palm branch in this region constitutes the basic optical building unit for the kibulu. Split laths of palm bamboo are used for all horizontal members of building construction, whatever the medium (packed clay, palm fronds, straw, and so on). Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that the oil palm's abundant (and replenishable) branches should serve as an internal benchmark.31 It is also possible that the tripling is sensed subconsciously and contributes to an aesthetic of sta- bility and completeness. In the Pende context, these associ- ations are drawn from the hearth because, in the words of an oft-quoted proverb: "It takes three chunks of termite nest to hold up the cooking pot."32 Once the thirty-one posts were in place, Nzambi's crew lashed on the split horizontal rails of palm bamboo. They also tied a tall, flexible pole to the front of each post along the wall. More experienced builders will perch on tempo- rary scaffolding in order to bend over these poles and tie them to the top of the center post in order to form the armature for the roof (Figure 10). Although the lashed poles can bear the weight of the thatch on their own, the center post provides additional support and a more consistent shape. Once the armature is set, slender bamboo rods are wound around the dome and secured to the vertical ribs. These supple rods harden dramatically as they dry and hold the form exceedingly well. Chief Nzambi admired the appearance of a distant neighbor's kibulu and decided to cover his walls with bark. Seeking to make his own house beautiful and distinctive, he nonetheless justified the extra work to his crew by arguing that bark would be more durable than straw. The task proved more difficult than he foresaw. His workers discov- ARCHITECTURE AGAINST THE STATE 279</page><page sequence="9">Figure 10 Construction of Chief Nzambi's kibulu. Ndjindji, DRC, June 1988 Figure 11 Fitting rolls of bark onto the frame of Chief Nzambi's kibulu. Ndjindji, DRC, June 1988 ered that deforestation limited the number of large trees available. Since narrow strips of bark tend to split and curl as they dry, the builders were faced with the challenge of laboriously overlapping the strips to ensure a waterproof barrier.33 First they fit the bottom of the rolls of bark into a canal dug alongside the house. They then punched holes into the bark and, unrolling it, tied each piece onto the hor- izontal rails (Figure 11). Folding the bark over the corner demanded special care. Finally, they tied four more hori- zontal laths of split palm bamboo over the top of the bark to secure it. The thatch is lashed onto the roof beginning at the bottom and working upward. During all three of the construction programs I wit- nessed, chiefs expressed concern that the kibulu attain the shape that distinguishes it from all other buildings. The near- blind Chief Kende voiced this anxiety most poignantly in 1988. His builder experienced difficulty in making the elas- tic poles arc gracefully because they had been gathered early and had already lost some of their flexibility. When observers commented on this development, the chief wailed in panic that the builder should be careful that the roof did not become pyramidal (the form of a subordinate chief's roof in this region). Having paid a high price to become indepen- dent from his superior, Kende feared that his builders were throwing away the most important marker of that position. The chiefs' concern to render the geometry of the building as legibly as possible is also expressed through the 280 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="10">Figure 12 Construction of Chief Nzambi's kibulu. The diamond pattern of the ceiling grid evokes the scales of the iguana, little brother to the crocodile, a symbol of paramount chiefs. Ndjindji, DRC, June 1988 handling of materials. Since at least the 1950s, photographs document an Eastern Pende insistence on strict formal sep- aration of the roof from the rest of the house. Most chiefs trim the thatch carefully along the roofline and do not allow it to cascade to the ground (see Figure 1). Some also flatten the thatch on the roof as much as possible with horizontal ropes of vines or creepers (see Figure 2). Chief Nzambi wove a ceiling grid from flat strips of palm bamboo in order to be able to make the thatch of the roof hug the dome more tightly (Figure 12). Similarly, builders will flatten wall coverings with rows of palm bamboo laths in order to main- tain the structure's square geometry (Figure 13). The full force of this subordination of materials is felt through com- parison with construction elsewhere in the DRC (Figure 14), where the cascading thatch treats the building as a unit, disguising the juncture between roof and wall so effectively that some have mistaken a rectangular plan for round. Despite the emphasis in exegesis on the kibulu's ritual function, my observation of the three separate building campaigns revealed considerable emotional investment on Figure 13 Chief Kende (Katshivi Koji) in front of his new kibulu. The civet and genet furs, leopard's-tooth necklace, ceremonial sword, staff, and basket are some of the elements of the chief's public insignia, which are stored in the front room of the house.

Attaining the distinctive dome-on-square shape emerged as the focus of intense preoccupation, which was expressed through anxi- ety over measurements, the selection of materials, the qual- ity of workmanship, and even the legibility of the overall design, although none of these elements impinges in the slightest on ritual function. Unquestionably, attaining the proper shape speaks directly to the prestige of the owner, who belongs to the highest rank of land-owning chiefs. The wider community also prides itself on the rank of its chief. However, there is more at stake. Ironically, this very standardization of form allows for a personalization of materials and exterior decoration. Interviews with more than a dozen chiefs revealed that each chief had thought hard about how to render his kibulu unique. Although today most kibulu are built of straw- probably because the colonial regime forced people to build their homes on the grassy plateau-the materials vary widely and include different barks, reeds, and palm prod- ucts.34 One chief invented a "white" kibulu (Figure 15) while another experimented with dying cords from the raffia palm to create a "black" kibulu (Figure 16). Both did so at the cost of considerable labor. Although established chiefs have more control than those undergoing investiture, one such candidate made a violent outburst in order to prevent his uncles from covering his first kibulu with straw, which he berated as "low class." In the final analysis, the choice of wall covering is governed by the chief's aesthetic prefer- ences and desire to distinguish his house from that of his rivals. The sculptural program and landscaping provide other avenues for personal distinction. Although it exists only as a site for ritual in exegesis, the kibulu actually takes shape through dialectical tension between the personal and the ritual, which in the Pende context imme- diately translates into tension between the political and the ritual. Although Pende culture recognizes and lauds individ- uality, it also recognizes that individual ambitions may be turned to individual profit and militarism. These concerns Figure 15 Chief Kindamba created a "white" kibulu by layering leaves from the husu raffia palm over "bamboo" cut from the oil palm.

Near Nyanga, DRC, 1987 take on extra urgency in regard to the chief, who may try to transform his ritual role into a political position. The kibulu then becomes a site of deep ambivalence about the aspirations of the chief, an ambivalence that, when examined more closely, helps explain the building's ephemeral nature. Contradictions between Visibility and Invisibility in the Site Plan The site plan of the kibulu abounds in contradictions, which emerge from competing tendencies to show off and to pro- tect, that is, to promote the chief's personal prestige and yet shelter the ritual center from contamination. Although the center post is described poetically as the heart of the village, the building itself is always tucked discreetly into the back of the community. Visitors are intended to pass by the houses of soldiers, elders, and, finally, ministers before reaching the kibulu.35 Nonetheless, the need to disguise the kibulu is under- mined by the Eastern Pende rule that the community dance floor be located alongside it (Figure 17). Following the investiture of a new chief, or periodically during masquer- Figure 17 The community dance floor is always located next to the kibulu.

Many Pende regard crowds as dangerous. By situating celebrations next to the kibulu, the chief promises the guests that the event will be well supervised; however, this placement also allows the chief to claim ownership over the event, and its success enhances his honor. Some chiefs have gone so far as to commission a major artist to produce a sculptural program for the building, thus ensuring that his house would become a site for local tourism (see Figure 3). The chief lures visitors to the hidden kibulu to gain their admiration and increase his renown. A handful of great chiefs resolved some of the tension between display and protection by allowing people to view the kibulu from a distance. These men reserved the right to fence their compounds with a cactiform hedge (see Figure 2). This plant produces a milky liquid that is poured into streams to stun fish;36 its presence thus reminds visitors of the dangers of disrespect. However, its irregular silhouette frames (and therefore accentuates) the kibulu more than it hides it. Visibility is a constant concern; more precisely, it is a ques- tion of how to show without showing too much. The vestibule is just as distinctive as the dome in marking off the kibulu from all other buildings and has the express purpose of throwing the door into shadow.37 In exterior plan, the kibulu is further dis- tinguished by a small courtyard in front, formed by a serried row of tree slips (Figures 18, 19). A short fence of four or five stakes extending from each side of the faqade ensures that a narrow oblique path is the only route of access. Consequently, although visitors can glimpse the doorway, their view is always baffled and partial (Figure 20; see Figure 2). 284 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="14">Figure 19 Kibulu of Chief Nzambi, plan Figure 20 Chief Nzambi's new house, Ndjindji, DRC, 1988. After allowing the living tree slips of the palisade to sprout, chiefs usually select one to three to grow as funeral markers and prune the rest. The form of the palisade (tsungu) shaping the small court is of great symbolic importance. During the con- struction of the ritual house for Chief Kombo-Kiboto (Munzenze Kavuka) in 1987, an intense argument broke out among visiting chiefs over whether or not the builders had placed the stakes sufficiently close together to screen the chief from view. Many worried that passersby might mis- take the palisade for that of a subordinate chief, more hon- orary than functional (Figures 21-23; see Figure 8). Finally, the men increased the number of trees from ten to more than forty to create the roomy but shielding type of enclo- sure proper to a chief of Kombo-Kiboto's rank.38 The visiting chiefs also censured the builders for mix- ing dried stakes into the palisade. The use of living tree slips is essential as their growth will be used to gauge the ances- tors' approval. Three months after the construction of Chief Nzambi's new kibulu, his first minister exulted over the fact that every tree had sprouted (see Figure 20): "You see our palisade! We have the benediction [of the dead]. Our affairs are in order! They progress [as they should]." In contrast, Chief Kikunga-Tembo found it ominous that three of the trees had sprouted on the right side of the pal- isade (from the perspective of the doorway), whereas none had sprouted on the left side. As the left hand is associated with the maternal line, the chief concluded that his "uncles" had opposed his nomination. The renowned blacksmith Ngoma Kandaku Mbuya confirmed that the Pende speak to the dead through trees.39 If the growth of the trees speaks to the perdurance of the lineage, one tree in particular acknowledges the chief's ARCHITECTURE AGAINST THE STATE 285</page><page sequence="15">Figure 21 An explosion of kibulu-building followed independence in 1960 as paramount chiefs have found it difficult to deny petitions for autonomy on the part of subordinates. Consequently, a case-by-case parsing of attributes of rank has developed. In this example, Chief Nkunyi has the domed roof and doorway sculptures of an independent chief. However, the bird sculpture on the rooftop and the wide spacing of the tree slips in the palisade indicate that his family originally belonged to the second order of chiefs. Near Nyanga, DRC, 1965 quest for personal distinction. The only required tree, planted in every palisade without exception, is the long- lived kamba (Chlorophora excelsa), which grows rapidly to tower over all other trees in the village and can be recog- nized instantly from a great distance. It may be significant that this "ornament of the forest," this "giant," is without any function40 apart from its role in memorializing the chief. In contrast to the beloved oil palm, for example, it provides neither building materials nor comestibles. Its wood is too sappy when young and too hard when mature for all but the most rugged steel tools. In the village, it soon outgrows its welcome capacity to provide shade. In form, it is unusually anthropomorphic because its trunk grows straight and smooth, without lower branches, and flares into a flat-topped crown. As such, it is an aestheticized object so associated with chiefs that Eastern Pende count the number of men who have ruled from a particular lineage by refer- ring metaphorically to how many kamba the lineage has enjoyed. Despite its importance, specialists insist that the tree's role is representational rather than ritual. Ngoma insisted that one may plant this tree over a chief's grave only as a memorial, representing the deceased individual. It can- not serve ritually as an altar-receiving libation or prayer-in contacting the collective dead.41 Chlorophora excelsa instead flatters individual, named chiefs. The dialectical tension between the ritual and the polit- ical plays out even in the landscaping of the kibulu. The house is situated at the rear of the community, screened from view by fence, palisade, and vestibule. And yet, it locates its precise position on the horizon through the tow- ering tree planted in its palisade, which is synonymous with the fame of its owner. Economy of Gazes If the chief cannot resist inviting visitors to gaze on the kibulu, he can nonetheless make them aware that they them- selves are the objects on view: the kibulu is surrounded by an army of eyes designed to trigger the uneasy sensation of being looked at-indeed being stared at. In 1987, the chiefs overseeing the investiture of Kombo-Kiboto rebuked the builders of his kibulu for failing to carve some of the trees planted in the palisade. The issue was deemed so important that the chiefs refused to allow the ceremony to proceed until the candidate's sponsors had repaired the omission. These carvings most often take the form of fraternity masks 286 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="16">Figure 22 Doorway to the kibulu of Chief Nkunyi. Near Nyanga, DRC, 1965 distributed around the palisade, their eyes staring out in three directions. Given their size, the little faces are lost in the crowd of tree slips (Figure 24). It is the viewer's sudden perception of one as he or she approaches that is intended to have an explicitly unsettling psychological effect. Frater- nity masks carry whips and ambush the unwary. The cita- tion communicates a warning to those approaching the kibulu to weigh the consequences of proximity. Do they have permission to be there? The chief may see himself as an active agent looking away from the kibulu, but when he sees those big eyes staring at him (Figure 23), he realizes that he is also under surveillance. Posts positioned in the courtyard are carved with a three-dimen- sional head and, in some cases, an upper body, and may be sin- gle, female or male, or paired. Sh'a Pindji, supervising the investiture of Chief Kombo-Kiboto, explained the role of this altar (lupepe): "The lupepe surveilles, it protects, the house of the chief and the chief himself. And [it therefore] also [pro- tects] the seed because the chief [is the guardian of] the seed."42 Since the dead send game animals as well as human and agri- cultural fertility through the conduit of the house and its open door, securing the chief and his house has wide implications for the health and well-being of the community at large. The gaze is deliberately evoked in these interpretations and is critical to the sense of protection. Some describe the figures as "looking at" the courtyard, house, or chief (draw- ing on the verb kutala). However, seven speakers (inter- viewed independently) used the verb kubamba, which signifies "to protect" in the sense of "to watch over." For example, kubamba is the verb used to describe the action of a babysitter watching or watching over a child. It connotes vigilance due to the implication that the object of concern is vulnerable, requiring the agent to pay attention. The gaze is even evoked in the minimalist form of the mutala, a stool-sized trunk of hard wood positioned several Figure 23 View from the door of Chief Nkunyi's kibulu. The carved lupepe altar post is usually oriented toward the door of the house and warns the chief that he himself is under surveillance.

Chief Kutshia's kibulu, Ndjindji, DRC, 1987 meters in front of the front door (see Figures 18, 19). The mutala is by far the most functional piece of ritual furniture associated with the kibulu. On the day on which a candidate is elected to office, he is brought to the house of his predeces- sor. He sits on the mutala (facing the door) as he speaks to the defunct chief, asking his blessing. On numerous occasions, lineage members are seated on the mutala for the chief to wel- come them, heal them, or wish them Godspeed. As a seat, the mutala is therefore oriented toward the kibulu, which serves as the portal to the land of the dead (see Figure 22).43 In the mutala, the tree trunk has been transformed into a ritual seat through the removal of some or all of the bark (see Figures 8, 15). 'When a visitor uses it as a stool, he or she looks toward the house; however, when not in use, the mutala is construed as a representation of the chief looking away from the house. Some of this multi-positionality is also reflected in explanations centered on the origin of the term mutala. All believe that the term derives from the verb kutala, which means "to look" and by extension "to surveil." Consequently, many describe the mutala as "watching over" or "protecting" the small courtyard. However, at a convo- cation of dignitaries, the respected Chief Shatshi argued that mutala derives from the passive form, "to be seen," and represents the place from which one is looked at by the entire population.44 It is the simplicity of the form of the altar that makes it adaptable to multiple interpretations. In the end, the chief does not stand alone. The kibulu is completed by the addition of a bundle of sticks on either side of the door and outside of the unmarked back door (see Figures 15, 16). These "ornaments" are composed of dried branches tied together with a belt of threaded palm fronds. According to Chief Samba, they evoke the people, grouped, alert, watching.45 The mutala and lupepe are altars for prayers to the dead, raised over a pocket of seed, each charged with a sacrifice of chicken's blood. The carved posts and ornamental bushes serve as reminders that the kibulu, essential to the commu- nity, rests under the watchful gaze of villagers and chief alike. Together they confide the kibulu to the protection of the extended family, united across the divide of death. How- ever, there is a more ominous gaze present, one that goes far to explain the kibulu's impermanence. Eastern Pende chiefs engaged in a fierce competition for prestige through the sculpture ornamenting the kibulu. A handful of great chiefs won the right to display large anthropomorphic figures on the roof (see Figure 2) and to surround their doors with panels sculpted in relief.46 The forms of these objects have varied tremendously over the years. Ironically, the imagery of subordinate chiefs may be more overtly threatening than that of their superiors. For example, the widespread ngungukola depicts a rare bird of ill omen whose song predicts a death in the village (see Figure 21). For the statuette perched on the roof, many chiefs have preferred female imagery, which through its evocation of motherhood emphasizes the fiercely protective nature of the chief (Figure 25). 288 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="18">The kibulu imagined by the populace and the neigh- bors hinges on these works. Whatever chiefs and their offi- cers may say publicly, most people interpret the more naturalistic language of the sculptures to mean that the chief has authorized the taking of one or more human lives through sorcery. In other words, these few chiefs are doing the unthinkable in advertising that they have "reinforced" (kukolesa) the chiefdom via power objects (wanga). Although he will deny it in public, the chief who is supposed to eschew sorcery is alluding, in the sculptures, to his practice of it. The rumors that flourish wherever secrecy is practiced find confirmation in any of the routine deaths that occur in the months before or after the placement of the figures. Theoretically, these works are mounted for the good of the community. After all, although the altars and other orna- ments of the kibulu allude to the watchful care of the matri- lineal family, both alive and dead, everyone knows how easy it is for individuals to be distracted. Everyone (except for chiefs and their officers) describes the figures as symbolizing the chief's personal guard, spirit sentinels who never have cause to sleep or even blink. The rooftop statuette perches protectively over the center post with its belly of seed. The carved side panels framing the door refer to bodyguards blocking the entry of jealous rivals (see Figures 3, 2 3). All these sculptures add to the army of eyes surround- ing the chief's house. The serene gaze of the rooftop stat- uette soars above the angry contest of stares below. The beasts within look toward the back wall; the carved post in the courtyard keeps watch over the door; the figures on the door panels stand ready to confront any visitor who makes it past the masked faces on the outer perimeter of the pal- isade. The statuary associated with the kibulu advertises the chief's role as the possessor of secret weapons, able to defend both himself and his people. From any angle, visitors approaching the kibulu become aware that they are the focus of many eyes, and yet they cannot see well themselves, since their view is blocked by the baffled entrance and the shadowy vestibule. This dis- association of seeing and being seen creates anxiety.47 Did the chief really arm power objects? Is anyone looking right now? Am I doing anything wrong? In this context, the spirit sentinels evoke automatons who have been stripped of both human weakness and human will through their indenture. The fear is that once set into motion they will act, whether the chief is conscious or not, willing or not. The plan, sculptural program, and landscaping are riven by a dialectical tension between the political and the ritual, between chiefs who aspire to individualize the build- ing and use it to forward their special status, and community members who intend to prevent the chief from transform- Figure 25 Eastern Pende rooftop statuette, 437/8 in. h., carved by Mushiko of the village Binjikila and acquired in Ngungu a Kasha in 1954.

The statuette warns potential criminals: should you attempt evil, this chief has the ability to pursue and punish you. How- ever, despite their ostensible good purpose, such statuettes allude to an individualized power about which many East- ern Pende remain deeply distrustful. During the 1980s, many chiefs were blocked by their constituencies from mounting carvings on their houses. Chief Kindamba was permitted door lintels but no rooftop statuette (see Figure 15). If for no other reason, the display of such sculptures ARCHITECTURE AGAINST THE STATE 289</page><page sequence="19">would insure that the kibulu would have to be destroyed periodically in order to curtail individual chiefly power.48 The Interior of the Kibulu Certain chiefs have wrested control of the exterior of the house, but what of the interior? The kibulu is divided into two chambers. The outer room contains a bed (pushed against one of the side walls), the chief's ceremonial dress, and some of the more public regalia (see Figures 13, 16). The back chamber may cut across the entire rear of the house or, more frequently, is restricted to a small room in the right corner (see Figures 18, 19). Theoretically, this inner chamber is intended to house the chief's coffin and three masks that are among the attributes of office.49 In practice, paramount chiefs confide much of their insignia for safekeeping to various notables as a gesture of respect and as a reward for loyalty.5o Some have interpreted the kibulu as a "treasure house," building on the anthropologist Leon de Sousberghe's description of its role in storing "the insignia and talismans of power."51 However, this public explanation only touches on the surface of what is contained within this structure. In 1988, following the investiture of the new Chief Kombo-Kiboto, Kimbangu Mugandzu alerted me that he was at work arranging the interior room of the kibulu. As Kimbangu served as the chief's "minister of the chamber," his exegesis considerably expands our understanding of the interior of the kibulu.52 Surprisingly, his first act was to mix a medicine to "cool" the chief and help him "return to rea- son" should he lose his temper. He then fashioned two miniatures in the form of a leopard and boa constrictor. Kimbangu made the leopard by thrusting two small forked sticks into the ground and wrapping grass and cords from the oil palm around them. Then he spotted the object red, black, and white. He fashioned the boa from a circlet of long grass with a knot for the head.53 Kimbangu conceived these animals, placed on the ground in the inner chamber, and facing the back wall, as power objects protecting the chief, that is, as personal body- guards. Although he denied empowering them through the transfer of energy from a living source, many claim that ministers of the chamber are or were once chosen for their skills as sorcerers.'54 The existence of such miniatures is well known, and the eyes of the masked faces in the palisade and other out- door sculptures may be said to remind viewers of the sleep- less stare of the beasts within. At a public meeting in Ndjindji in 1987, a speaker asserted that the figures have a twofold purpose: "If someone is impudent, they will pursue the malefactors. If the chief himself disobeys the laws, he will die. His own guard can kill him." The surprising con- clusion of the meeting was that the guards placed in the back room of the kibulu protect the chiefdomfrom the chief as much as from outside assault. The organization of the kibulu exacts a certain psychic violence on the chief. Ironically, neither he nor his wife may enter the back room of their own house. In fact, some believe that they might well die if they catch a glimpse of certain forbidden objects within.55 The only individual allowed inside is the minister of the chamber. It may seem like a terrible tease to have a room in one's own house that one may not enter; however, this fact forces the Eastern Pende chief to acknowledge the reality that he cannot gov- ern alone. Once he completed the miniatures, Kimbangu shaped a "cemetery" (ndjinda) as a mound of earth, measuring approximately twelve by sixteen inches, in the inner cham- ber against the outer wall. Eventually, he expects the coffin to hang on the wall above it. As he said: "Where there's a coffin, there must be a cemetery." Finally, he molded a sec- ond and larger "cemetery" mound directly under the bed, composed in part of a handful of earth from the secret bur- ial ground in the forest. The minister explained that the double cemetery served two purposes. First, the chief must remember that he will die and that he should leave the vil- lage peaceful. Second, he has to sleep directly on the earth during times of crisis and periodically during the ritual cal- endar. According to Kimbangu, sleeping on the ground facilitates communication with the dead: "We're serious! Listen to us!" Since the other world is usually visualized as being underground, the dead are easily alerted to the needs of their descendants when the chief sleeps at night on the mound built in the kibulu with earth from the cemetery. In the words of Mukishi Loange: "The grains that we eat and the animals that provide us with meat all spring ultimately from the earth and are sent by the dead. The chief sleeps on the ground in order to be closer to the land of the dead."56 The chief is obliged to sleep within the kibulu on his minia- ture cemetery before communal hunts, before the staple crops are sown or harvested, before masquerades, and dur- ing the boys' initiation, which may last for months. Fol- lowing a periodic ritual cleansing for the village, the women bring their hoes to "sleep" in the kibulu before they reclaim them for work. The earthen floor, therefore, serves as an altar platform to confide to the dead the gravest issues of human survival.57 If the chief imagines his kibulu forwarding his social position, his individuality, his taste, and even (through the 290 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="20">encrustations of sculpture) his acquisition of political power, he is nonetheless forced to live with a very different kibulu. Through the cemetery mounds transposed inside the house, the kibulu reinforces his ritual role and emphasizes the con- tinuity of office over the short tenure of any given occu- pant. In addition, the gaze trained on the chief is not wholly protective of his person (see Figure 23); it is also wary and suspicious of his motives. A chief who sleeps on a cemetery separated by a thin screen from a hungry leopard and boa is a chief who has been warned. Chief Nzambi once sharply corrected me for referring to the kibulu as "the chief's house" (inzo ya fumu). He insisted that the correct term was "house of the chiefdom" (inzo ya ufumu).58 This confusion reveals the problem. If the chief is a priest, the keeper of the portal to the other world in this "house of seed," he is also a man, and possi- bly a man of ambition. In allowing him power objects-the miniature leopard and boa-the Pende acknowledge that he may have personal enemies. However, they try to sepa- rate the chief from this knowledge by categorically refusing him entrance to the secret chamber where they reside. Nonetheless, many Eastern Pende chiefs have managed to establish a base for personal power in the sculptures cover- ing the kibulu, and these carvings raise serious questions in the minds of many about the very possibility of separating the office from the man. Power and Impermanence The contradictions surrounding the Eastern Pende kibulu are palpable. The building is the house of the chief, but he may not enter its inner chamber for fear of being devoured by ferocious beasts. It is fenced and tucked discreetly into the corner of the community, and yet the glamor of its statuary once served as a beacon for tourism throughout the region. "The house of the dead," "the house of seed," "the house of meat," "the house of prohibition," the kibulu is also an aes- thetic object testifying to the wealth, rank, and personal tastes of a named individual. Outsiders are warned to keep their distance although they are lured nearby during celebratory masquerades, which always take place next to the kibulu. Pal- isade and vestibule shield the kibulu from easy view, but much of the outside program advertises what lies inside. The stumpy mutala altar (on which every family member sits at one time or another) echoes the center post guarding the seeds critical to local agriculture. The growing trees that will serve as the chief's funeral markers allude to the coffin and "cemetery" within. The fierce stare of the fraternity masks warn of the beasts of the inner chamber able to pursue and punish the uninitiated. Finally, the sculptural program offers comfort by advertising spirit sentinels watching over the community while arousing anxiety that they may shield the chief if he decides to pursue political power. Many Pende argued that the kibulu must be regularly abandoned and a new one built in its place to avoid its becoming cluttered with power objects. However, if the destruction of the power objects associated with the chief were the only concern, then the abandonment of the house at the death of the chief should suffice. Why the rules against maintenance, which ensure that the house self- destructs roughly every decade? Theoretically, the Eastern Pende chief is elected to his position for life. Nonetheless, he is held to have a mystical relationship with his population that can affect his health and that of his wife. In 1987, when the elderly Chief Kombo-Kiboto died after forty-five years in office, many attributed his death to a restless desire for novelty on the part of his population, even though he was highly esteemed. Often, it is the renewal of the kibulu that gives the chief some indicator of his popularity. In informal conversations, multiple chiefs let slip con- cerns about their relationship with the community. In 1988, the conscientious Chief Nzambi initiated a rebuilding pro- gram, fearing that the decrepit nature of his house might affect the yield of his villagers in panning for diamonds in the Kasai River. Yet when he received little cooperation, the chief grew anxious, wondering, "Do they want me to fall ill?" The same year, Chief Kende, growing blind, was advised by his healer to renew his kibulu as a means of ask- ing for mercy from his uncles. They hoped the ceremony could be used to heal any family tensions that were mani- festing themselves in the chief's serious illness. In June 1987, Chief Kindamba announced the construction of a new school in the area. On his return from the meeting, he felt the dead pulling at his ear: "You haven't rebuilt your kibulu, but you have the means to construct a new school! Tomorrow, you will die." He collapsed mute and agitated. At such a moment, the people's demeanor sends a very direct message. If they dawdle, it is clear that they are unhappy with the chief and are warning him that his life may be at risk. If they respond quickly and in good humor, it indicates that he enjoys a good relationship with them. Kindamba exulted that his people had responded immedi- ately (see Figure 15). In effect, the rebuilding of the kibulu every seven to twelve years acts as a referendum on the chief's performance in office. To an extraordinary degree, it reminds him that he rules at the pleasure of the people. Even if the community rebuilds the house, they will require that the chief live next to the decaying wreck of his previous home (including statuary toppled from the roof) ARCHITECTURE AGAINST THE STATE 291</page><page sequence="21">Figure 26 The ephemeral nature of the kibulu is contrasted to the vigor and longevity of its landscaping. The last kibulu of Chief Kombo-Kiboto (Mukanzo Mbelenge) decays in the background, while the trees planted in the courtyard of an earlier house (probably that pictured in Figure 2) serve as his funerary monument. Ndjindji, DRC, 1987 as a lesson on the limits of political power (see Figure 7). The rotting kibulu will serve as a memento mori, as do the coffin with which he is required to live and the cemetery soil on which he must sleep. This is not an arcane art his- torical reference. On repeated occasions, when asked why they did not dispose of the remains of the previous kibulu, neighbors responded (with lugubrious satisfaction): "No. No. The chief should remember that one day he will die [like the rest of us.]" Ironically, the impermanence of the chief's house is con- trasted with the relative permanence of the long-lived trees planted in his honor in the courtyard (Figure 26). The chief lives with his funeral marker as well as signs of his inevitable decay. The lofty Chlorophora excelsa, towering over the village, flatters him with the memory he will leave behind. However, the quality of trees that is most savored is their unstinting obedience. In the words of a favorite proverb: "A tree has ears, [but] the human child has none."'59 A plant, whether started by seed or slip, grows exactly where it is placed. It can- not wander off or rebel. No other being can ever attain this standard of steadfastness. The chief does well who measures himself against the virtue of a tree and realizes that his glory will lie in submitting his will to that of his people. The repressed issue of impermanence in Africa keeps resurfacing. Pende evidence suggests that the question may be rich in meaning and deserves to be problematized. Among the few to tackle the topic, Prussin has argued that "nonpermanence ... does not presuppose the absence of a stable system of 'places': rather, it connotes renewal, reju- venation, and rebirth."60 She would substitute continuity of place for durability of materials. Although the kibulu shifts locales, her formulation works well for many communities built in adobe. It is also likely that replacement of materials may indeed yield a sense of rejuvenation (and perhaps purification) to certain ritual centers.61 Suzanne Blier makes an argument similar to Prussin's, applied to residential architecture. In Togo, she found that an anthropomorphic identification of house with owner is predicated on a com- mon cycle of death and rebirth: "With proper care and good fortune, houses, like humans, are expected to live for about 56 years.... Each dies to give birth to a successor con- structed in part with the fabric of the old. As a Tamberma village historian explained this process, every time a house becomes old and decays 'it is like (the house itself) is dead, and wants to give birth to a new one.'"'62 A reincarnation of structure seems linked to a reincarnation of souls. Lest any- one think that a building's demise is always peaceful, Dominique Malaquais chronicled a case among the Bamilek6 of Cameroon where political dissidents torched thousands of stately buildings associated with chiefly power in the 1950s as a protest against the chiefs' complicity with an exploitative government.63 The Eastern Pende kibulu lies midway between embrace of a building's life cycle and outright political icon- oclasm. While the regular renewals of the kibulu structure a cycle of rejuvenation and rebirth, the building is rigged to self-destruct and its disintegration packs as much emotive force as the torched palaces in Cameroon. As anthropolo- gist Alfred Gell stated provocatively: "Art-destruction is art- making in reverse; but it has the same basic conceptual structure. Iconoclasts exercise a type of 'artistic agency."'64 In this case, it is important to realize that the decaying wreck of the chief's house is orchestrated as an aesthetic experience that signifies fully as much as the new building, 292 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="22">resplendent in its cherry-tinted sculpture and sprouting trees. In their desire to thwart the accumulation of coercive power in the hands of their chiefs, the Eastern Pende have turned architecture against the state. The perpetual renewal of his house requires regular renegotiation of the social con- tract between the chief and his people and underscores their interdependence.

See Dell Upton, "Architectural History or Landscape History?," Journal ofArchitectural Education 44 (Aug. 1991), 195-99. Upton argues that archi- tectural historians inherited from nineteenth-century designers the desire to legitimate architects as professionals with claims to "universal knowl- edge or 'science'"' (195). In contrast, the eminent architectural historian Marvin Trachtenberg gives passionate voice to the claims for "Architecture with a capital 'A,"' asserting that monumental architecture "captures as no other form the spirit of its times." "Patrons pay the bills," but architects are the inventors. He goes so far as to argue that the "great buildings" alone have history, which he defines as "the story of unique individuals, develop- ments, events, and acts of creation." In contrast, the "essence of vernacular building is its unchanging quality, having generally come into being in response to the ahistoric conditions of agrarian, backwoods, or primitive societies. Sometimes called 'architecture without architects,' it can also be termed 'architecture without history."' Marvin Trachtenberg, Architecture, from Prehistory to Post-Modernism: The Western Tradition (New York, 1986), 41-42. Trachtenberg's assertions have the bald clarity of someone embat- tled, who knows full well that his beliefs are under fire-from Upton, the vernacular movement, and many others. However, surely it marks a turn- ing point when an introduction to the Western tradition must justify exclu- sive focus on monumental building in durable materials rather than take it for granted. 2.

During the colonial era, the Belgians did all they could to transform the office of chief into political officer for the state with the result that the office has been permanently tainted among the Kwilu and Central Pende. See Z. S. Strother, Inventing Masks (Chicago, 1998), 260-61. Although the post- colonial state also awards chiefs political position (and approves elections), popular Eastern Pende chiefs in the 1980s were careful to achieve consen- sus with advisers on how best to respond to demands of the state, even in seemingly straightforward cases, such as the arrest of a criminal. 12.

In his field notes, de Sousberghe recorded the rule prohibiting repairs to the chief's ritual house (gisendu) among the Central Pende. Prominent Sefu Nzamba (chief of the Gatundo) told the anthropologist that the com- munity's children were in danger once the walls began to lean. The chief was living in his third house (in approximately 1957), having been invested in 1932, thereby implying an average lifespan for his houses of eight years and four months. Ldon de Sousberghe, notebook "Mr Souris," 2, copy in the author's possession. My own research documented an average lifespan of ten to twelve years. 18. For the special difficulties of researching a subject that can never be considered disinterested, see Z. S. Strother, "From Performative Utterance to Performative Object," Res: Journal ofAnthropology and Aesthetics 37 (spring 2000), 69-70. 19. In Kipende, vumo signifies "belly," with the same conflation of "stom- ach," "abdomen," and "womb" that one finds in English. In Kipende, the term also signifies "matrilineage." In a previous article, I translated vumo to the neutral term "stomach," in order to avoid gendering the house in the reader's imagination. Z. S. Strother, "Eastern Pende Constructions of Secrecy," in Mary Nooter, ed., Secrecy (New York, 1993), 156-78. However, as many Pende describe the kihulu as a "granary" filled with seed destined to nourish the life of the local matrilineage, there are definite allusions also to the womb. In the end, "belly" seems the best translation because it pre- serves the metaphorical ambiguities savored by Pende ritual specialists. For discussion of women's granaries as wombs, see Labelle Prussin, "West African Mud Granaries, Paideuma 18 (1972), 161. 20. The Eastern Pende practice positional succession, so each successive holder of a title takes the name of the title, which is also the name of the community. For example, in the present article there are references to more than two men who have held the title "Chief Kombo-Kiboto." When it is appropriate to stress individual agency, personal names are cited in paren- theses following the title. 21.

Susan Denyer has observed a preference for building with palm fronds in the vast region extending from southern Cameroon south to Angola. She notes that both palm fronds and bamboo grow quickly and "dead straight" with little variation in diameter for lengths of three meters or more, mak- ing possible "houses of very regular dimensions and of extreme neatness." Neither material has the flexibility to be bent or jointed, requiring that lengths be "lashed with strips of bark or creepers." Denyer, African Tradi- tionalArchitecture, 97. Although oil palms grow abundantly in Eastern Pende villages, the soil is not ideal and thus limits their size. 32. Although by the late 1980s most Pende described themselves as Chris- tians, the fact that so many ritual elements are divided into threes argues against any recent transposition of religious symbolism. 33. It is worth noting that the construction of Nzambi's ritual house (exclud- ing the palisade) required more than sixteen different plant products, none of which proved prescriptive or "symbolic." It is the structural properties that matter, for example, whether or not a hardwood chosen for the center post can resist termites, whether or not a bark will lie flat despite the humid- ity, and whether or not a pole is sufficiently elastic to arc gracefully. These materials span all three environments available to the Pende: savanna, gallery forest, and village. 34. De Sousberghe's photographs from the 1950s show a greater range of building materials than is common today. See Leon de Sousberghe, "Cases cheffales sculptfes des Ba-Pende," Bulletin de la Socifti Royale Belge d'An- thropologie et de Prihistoire 65 (1954), 75-81; see also his unpublished images deposited in the photographic archives of the National Museum of African Art, Washington, D.C. The choice of building materials relates to personal taste, not family tradition. There are many cases of chiefs switching wall coverings. 35. Although ideally the door is oriented toward the east, this rule must always bend to the concern to have the back door against the bush. There- fore, if a kibulu is constructed along the eastern side of a north-south road, its door will face west. De Sousberghe also notes a discrepancy between rule and practice in his field notes from 1953. De Sousberghe, notebook XX, 7, 72, 76, copy in the author's possession. 36. The hedge is Euphorbia trigana HAW. 37. In addition, in all three building campaigns, careful thought was given to the size and position of the door. In one case, the builders deliberately placed it off-center in order to obscure the view of the bed inside. Among the Central Pende, the addition of a deep vestibule is the only structural feature distinguishing a great chief's house from the vernacular and it is suggestive that their term for the house (gisendu) signifies "vestibule" (kisenzu) to their neighbors, the Eastern Pende. 38. Frobenius writes that in "the middle of the court an awning is deemed necessary as a rule" (see Figure 6 in the present essay). Frobenius, Ethno- graphische Notizen, 59 (see n. 14). He is describing a rack of palm fronds or palm bamboo, often built on the top of the palisade in order to display trib- ute animals. Difficult to perceive in photographs (see Figures 2, 20), the addition also enhances the sense of the courtyard as an enclosure and many chiefs use it like a screened porch in which to entertain friends and rela- tives. 39.

So important is the mutala that, as with the center post, before it is felled the originating tree must be dedicated to the dead with prayers and a sac- rificial offering of chicken and palm wine. 44. Several made this argument, although it seems surprising from a gram- matical point of view. Technically, "to be seen" should be rendered kuditala and "the one seen," mutadi; however, the names for ritual objects are always grammatically ambiguous. Literally, mutala signifies the act of seeing, as in "ngudi mutala," "I am looking." 45. Chief Samba (Ngoyi Kisabu Kavundji), pers. comm., near Kingange, DRC, 1988. 46.

These masks (Pumbu, Kipoko, and Panya Ngombe) are all readily han- dled by the chief and are generally stored in the back room to give them a little additional security. For illustrations, see Strother, "Eastern Pende," 165-71 (see n. 19). 50. This practice also serves as a check on theft.

Kimbangu was trained as first minister by the renowned ChiefKombo- Kiboto (Mukanzo Mbelenge) and loyal to his memory. By alerting me, Kim- bangu was honoring Mukanzo's deathbed wish that I should have carte blanche to study the investiture of his successor. Exceptionally, Kimbangu was retained as the first minister for Mukanzo's successor. His statements are supported by conversations with Mukishi Loange, Chief Nzambi, and Chief Kutshia and by a public meeting at Ndjindji in June 1987. 53. He should have also molded a crocodile from earth around a core of straw and spotted it like the leopard. However, Kimbangu described him- self as on "semi-strike"; he reported holding the crocodile back in order to have some leverage with the chief on a salary dispute. 54. For example, see Kodi, "Pre-Colonial History," 2: 127 (see n. 6). For the dynamics of power objects, see Strother, "Performative Utterance," 49-71 (see n. 18). It seems likely that the sculptures sheltered in the kibulu were more elaborate at one time. Emil Torday remarked that Chief Yongo of the Mushinga owned "a carved monitor lizard which is supposed to be a great fetish." Emil Torday and T. A. Joyce, "On the Ethnology of the South- Western Congo Free State," Journal of the RoyalAnthropological Institute 37 (1907), 148. De Sousberghe reports that many chiefs in the past possessed one or more animal sculptures. De Sousberghe, L'art pende, 127. When asked by the historian Kodi which insignia the chief could not see, Chief Kasanji described a pair of figures representing a man and a woman (Kodi, "Pre-Colonial History," 2: 128). 55. Kodi, "Pre-Colonial History," 2: 127. 56. Mukishi Loange, pers. comm., Ndjindji-Kombo, DRC, 1988. 57. There are strong regional differences among the Pende. Certain Kwilu chiefs told de Sousberghe that the most important item of the kifumu, "the ensemble of chiefly symbols or attributes," was a sack of earth from the Kwango River in Angola (the ancestral home of the Pende) mixed with the nails, hair, and finger or toe bones removed from the corpses of former chiefs. De Sousberghe, "Regime foncier," 1346. No one has ever docu- 294 JSAH / 63:3, SEPTEMBER 2004</page><page sequence="24">mented an Eastern Pende reference to such a sack of earth, although one may see a certain parallelism in the construction of a cemetery inside the kibulu. For the Eastern Pende, the only essential item of chiefly regalia (called ufumu, not kifumu or gifumu) is the chief's iron bracelet (worn on his left wrist and inherited by his successor). 58. Ufumu is a difficult concept to translate or even comprehend. In its broadest sense, it refers to the spiritual essence defining a "chiefdom." Because chiefdoms are ranked (some owe others tribute), the term can carry political associations. During the colonial era, ufumu became more strictly a political term describing a social unit recognized and taxed by the state. More narrowly still, the word signifies the "chief's insignia of office." Elderly Pende described ufumu and its derivative fumu as foreign imports that had replaced older terms ulamba and kalamba (chief) during the Belgian occupation. 59.
