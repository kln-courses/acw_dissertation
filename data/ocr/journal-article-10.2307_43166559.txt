<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Beaver. Hope Ryden. 63pp. $12.95. Putnam. 1986. (Grades 4 and up) From the first frolics of spring to the frantic fall rush to store food for winter, The Beaver delivers a thorough and detailed account of a beaver's life and habits. One section also discusses the beaver's role in conservation and in the restoration of overused areas. The continuous text would be daunting to all but the most able students under age 12; chapter or sectional divisions would make the text more accessible. Unfortu- nately, on an occasion or two the author resorts to anthropomorphism. Although the numerous black-and-white photographs lack clarity and definition, the text makes this book valuable for older children. Michael Bowden</page></plain_text>
