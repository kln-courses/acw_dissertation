<plain_text><page sequence="1">710 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST REPLY TO POWER Power claims the replacement female that I observed at nest 1 could not confidently be distinguished from the original, since "relying on the absence or presence of primaries to identify bluebirds is an inexact procedure because seeing that primaries are missing is often difficult under field conditions." I agree with the latter part of this statement. However, with repeated observations, as in this case, confidence can become very high, especially since I actually observed the removal of the primaries in question. Furthermore, it is relatively easy to see if primaries are present. The absence of primaries may conceivably go unnoticed; the pres- ence of primaries, however, establishes with certainty that the bird in question has not lost hers. In the disputed study, it was clear that the replacement female possessed primaries, which the original female had lost. My observations began on July 3, 1976; I saw no molting individuals until July 31. Power claims that the "timing of breeding events argues against the presence of two successive females at nest 1." He does not consider that reproductive success by floating females would doubtless require an accelerated reproductive regime, not unlike that found in a nest parasite, which must lay eggs during the few minutes that a nest may be unguarded. Three eggs were ultimately laid and fledged from nest 1; on the day the replacement female arrived, one egg was found on the ground outside the nest. It seems unlikely that a female would discard her own egg, just as I would not expect her to regrow her primaries instantaneously. Furthermore, laying was in fact complete by the time of my second pair of model presentations, although it is possible that the experiment interrupted what would otherwise have been a larger clutch. Unfortunately, I have no quantitative data on the availability of replacement females at Mount Rainier; neither does Power. Power may choose to infer from my study that "mountain bluebird evolution is driven by the reproductive succes- ses and failures of a small fraction of its population breeding in one of its most marginal environments . . . , p. 708." I did not imply it. I do, however, think it likely that adaptations can be fine-tuned via behaviors that are crucial for the fitness of the individuals involved. Power's denial of "identity" between bluebird "cuckoldry" and human adul- tery is like my seeking to refute his arguments by denying the scientific validity of special creation. Power never argued for special creation and I never argued for the "identity" he denounces. Part of the issue here concerns the distinction between analogy, homology, and identity. In this regard, it may be worth noting that, unlike the conventional textbook wisdom concerning analogy and homology, in which homologies are typically portrayed as somehow more real, one of sociobiology's strengths derives from the recognition that analogies often reflect the action of similar selection pressures and, thus, may provide considerable Am.

Power states that the seasonal restrictions on bluebird copulations reduce the possible ramifying effects of copulation on fitness in bluebirds as compared to humans. However, given the smaller number of bluebird copulations and the higher probability that any one, randomly chosen, will determine reproductive success for a year, or quite possibly a lifetime, each copulation has greater consequences for fitness in mountain bluebirds than among humans. This differ- ence, along with many other more obvious ones, almost certainly contributes to the likelihood that bluebird and human copulations are somewhat different. Fi- nally, the Random House dictionary defines "cuckold" as "the husband of an unfaithful wife." Power evidently prefers the term cuckoldry to "adultery." I see no reason to believe that the former is any less anthropomorphic than the latter. DAVID P.
