<plain_text> <page sequence="1">       “OLD” PAN AND “NEW” PAN  IN MENANDER’S DYSKOLOS*      Abstract: While in the classical period Pan is often an aggressive and dangerous figure, in  Menander’s Dyskolos he is depicted as urbane, civic-minded and benevolent, and thus in closer  alignment with the general presentation of the god by Hellenistic authors. Menander highlights  Pan’s evolution through the distribution of his antithetical traits between two dramatic            characters: the wild, reclusive Knemon and the divinity of the prologue. “Old” Pan/Knemon  expresses civic disengagement and the ferocity of the undomesticated; “New” Pan mediates be- tween country and city, and adopts inclusiveness and greater openness to communal integration.       At Cra. 408c–d, Plato discusses, with his usual subtlety, Pan’s biformity ( διφυής) as a symbol of the ability of λόγος to turn itself toward both  heavenly and base pursuits. The philosopher’s interpretation is idiosyn- cratic, prompted probably by the linguistic preoccupations of the dialogue.1 His  attention to the god’s duality, however, is indicative of the Greeks’ understanding  of him as a figure of antithetical traits: Pan is half-human, half-animal in shape; a  hunter but also the protector of animals; the god of music and dance but also of  frenzy and terror; overseer of peaceful pastoral activity but also the source of mili- tary panic; dweller in the wilderness but also defender of Greek civilization and  the democracy; a figure of uncontrolled sexuality but also the god in whose sanc- tuaries we find offerings related to marriage, the institution that regulates sexual- ity for civic purposes. These polarities remain a constant in Pan’s identity  through the centuries. Yet he does change, not through a radical alteration of his  core nature, however, but via shifts in emphasis or toning down of certain aspects  of his character. This evolution is visible in literature and is related to wider cul-   * This is a revised version of a paper presented at the 2008 Annual Meeting of CAMWS in  Tucson, Arizona.

In the Hellenistic period, on the other hand, nature is viewed with great af- fection: bucolic poetry, for instance, creates a landscape in which mountains and  forests resonate with the melodies of benign musical competitions and young  shepherds delicately court female (or male) counterparts. Even the monotonous  and physically taxing duties of husbandry are transformed into a pleasant mode  of livelihood in this locus amoenus, which beneath its rustic façade now becomes  in many ways an extension of the city and its civil refinements. The Pan who  emerges from this milieu is considerably tamer and much closer to humanity and  its institutions than the Pan of an earlier age.   It is within this cultural framework that I discuss some ways in which  Menander alters and adjusts the older persona of Pan in Dyskolos, bringing the  god into closer alignment with the sensibilities of his time, at the beginning of the    2 Stoicism, Epicureanism and Cynicism encouraged strong interaction with the natural world,  because, as Epicurus put it, study of it provides an excellent understanding of what is most impor- tant for humans (“nature leads to virtue,” Ep. Hdt. 78); see Long (1974) 41. This approach origi- nates in Aristotle, who compares nature to an οἰκονόμος ἀγαθός (“good housekeeper”) that  manages everything effectively and finds a purpose for it; cf. Desmond (2008) 134. For the Helle- nistic notion of using nature in accord with its purpose, see Sandbach (1975) 31, 35; Graver  (2007) 202. Cf. Segal (1981) 210: “The bucolic fiction, with its implicit contrast of country and  city, the simple and the elaborate, signifies something beyond itself, a desiderated ideal of calm and  harmony with self and with nature.” For art sharing technical terms with contemporary philosophy,  see Fowler (1989) 169.   3 In Phaiakia, shipwrecked Odysseus is afraid (δείδω) to enter the forest (δάσκιον ὕλην,  θάμνοις ἐν πυκινοῖσι, Od. 5.470–3). Elsewhere dangerous encounters take place in similar envi- rons: ὑψηλῶν ὀρέων ναίουσι κάρηνα (Cyclopes), 9.113; διὰ δρυμὰ πυκνὰ καὶ ὕλην (Kirke),  10.150. In the classical period, examples of the wilderness as a sinister place abound; this is, e.g.,  where Prometheus is punished (ἐρημίαν, 2; τῆσδε φάραγγος σκοπέλοις ἐν ἄκροις, A. PV 142– 3); Oidipos is exposed (ναπαίαις πτυχαῖς, S. OT 1026); Agave kills her son, thinking he is a lion  (ἐρημίας, E. Ba. 1176); Aktaion is torn apart by his dogs (οὗπερ πρὶν Ἀκτέωνα διέλαχον  κύνες, E. Ba. 1291); Iphigeneia (among the Taurians) resides (ἄμεικτον αἶαν, E. IT 402); new- born Kyros is to be exposed (θηριωδέστατον τῶν ὁρέων, Hdt. 1.111.3; ἐρημότατον τῶν ὁρέων,  Hdt. 1.113.2).   </page> <page sequence="3">  “OLD” PAN AND “NEW” PAN IN DYSKOLOS 25   Hellenistic age.4 I suggest that the playwright presents Pan’s complex and evolv- ing personality through two dramatic characters, the divinity of the prologue and  the reclusive Knemon. While the latter reflects primarily aspects of the traditional  wild Pan, the former is the new social type: urbane, sophisticated, civic-minded  and benevolent. By dividing the god’s contrasting traits between two dramatic  characters, and making the grouchy Knemon unwilling to join the celebrations at  the end of the play, Menander indicates that the old Pan and the spirit of remote- ness and civic detachment he represents are alien to the demands of his times.  On the other hand, by depicting a Pan who facilitates and even conceives the idea  of a marriage that crosses lines between city and country, and wealth and mod- esty of means, he gives voice to the need for stronger communal integration. For  in the last quarter of the 4th century, Athens was plagued by increasing socio- economic disparity, as its Macedonian-controlled policies favored large land- owners—residents of the ἄστυ—while small farmers became poorer, marginal- ized and disenfranchised.5 Menander alludes to these realities and employs Pan, a  native of the pastoral world but also embraced by urban dwellers, to mediate the  egalitarian love he inspires. The god’s initiatives not only relieve the social ten- sion in the play but bring to center stage his “new” persona.     “Old” Pan and Knemon    A brief examination of the salient characteristics of the classical Pan will help  us understand more clearly the aspects he has in common with Knemon and,  later, his differences from the Pan of Dyskolos:   (a) Pan is half-animal, half-human in form. In Homeric Hymn 19 he is twice  called αἰγοπόδης, δικέρως, 2, 37; Aristophanes describes him as “horn-crested”  (κεροβάτας, Ra. 230), Kratinos “golden-horned” (χρυσοκέρως, fr. 359),  Simonides αἰγίκναμος (PMG 519B), Kastorion θήρ (SH 310), and Herodotos  as having the face and legs of a he-goat (2.46). Although in terms of iconographic  representation there is a progression from a primarily animal form toward a more  humanized one, the interplay of zoomorphic and anthropomorphic elements  remains present.6    4 The play was produced in 316.  5 See below, pp. 38-40 in the section “The Pan of Dyskolos and Menander’s Athens.”  6 Cf. the wealth of images in Lambrinoudakis (1997) 612–35, and the bibliographic  references to Pan’s iconography in Jost (1985) 464 n. 1.

Literature associates him with remote  and inaccessible places and generally with geography devoid of human presence.  In hHom. 19.6–11, his domain is described as the snowy ridges (πάντα λόφον  νιφόεντα), peaks of mountains and rocky crests (κορυφὰς ὀρέων καὶ  πετρήεντα κάρηνα), heavy thickets (ῥωπήια πυκνά), soft streams  (ῥείθροισιν μαλακοῖσιν); in Kastorion the god dwells in snow-battered wintry  abodes (βολαῖς νιφοκτύποις δυσχείμερον ναίονθ ̓ ἕδραν, SH 310). The  tragedians describe a similar landscape: in Euripides (Ba. 945–52) Pan is referred  to as the “inhabitant (Πανὸς ἕδρας) of the glens and mountain-tops of  Kithairon” (Κιθαιρῶνος πτυχὰς, κορυφαῖς), while in Sophokles he is  described as “mountain-roaming” (ὀρεσσιβάτας, OT 1100) and as haunting  “the rocky ridge of snow-beaten Kyllene” (Κυλλανίας χιονοκτύπου /  πετραίας δειράδος, Aj. 695–7). In the latter passage the god is also said to roam  the sea (ὦ Πὰν Πὰν ἁλίπλαγκτε), a notion already suggested by Aiskhylos  (Πὰν ἐμβατεύει ποντίας ἀκτῆς ἔπι, Pers. 459). Like Artemis, Pan is both a  hunter (θῆρας ἐναίρων, hHom. 19.13) and the protector of wild beasts.7 This  latter capacity reinforces his proximity—and affinity—to the animal world, and  thus his distance from civilization and humanity. In fact, on Mt. Lykaion in  Arcadia (the land of Pan) there was an enclosure sacred to him and Zeus, a  sanctuary for wild animals, which was off-limits to hunters and might not be  trespassed on (ἄβατον).8   (c) Pan is the god of husbandry and farming. In hHom. 19.5 he is called “god  of the shepherds” (νόμιον θεόν), and a few lines later is described as “climbing  up the highest peak that overlooks the sheep” (ἀκροτάτην κορυφὴν  μηλοσκόπον εἰσαναβαίνων). In A. Eu. 943–5, the chorus prays to Pan to  increase the thriving flocks at the time of labor (μῆλά τ ̓ εὐθενοῦντα Πάν ...  τρέφοι χρόνῳ τεταγμένῳ). Elsewhere he is referred to as “custodian of the  fields” (ἀγρῶν ταμίαν, E. El. 704).   (d) Pan generates fear. The earliest testimony of Pan’s ability to frighten ap- pears in hHom. 19.38–9, in which his nurse, upon seeing his face, leaps up,                                                                           representation of Pan from a “nearly complete animal shape in the direction of steady  humanization of the torso, the legs, and even of the face.”   7 See Fraenkel (1950) 36 on A. Ag. 56; also Lloyd-Jones (1970) 18; Collard (2002) 117. On  Pan as protector of wild animals, Jost (1985) 469.  8 Violators were expected to die within a year through the agency of the god; if caught, they  were stoned to death (Paus. 8.38.6), cf. Borgeaud (1988) 34–44.  </page> <page sequence="5">  “OLD” PAN AND “NEW” PAN IN DYSKOLOS 27   abandons the child and flees because “she became afraid” (φεῦγε δ ̓ ἀναΐξασα,  λίπεν δ ̓ ἄρα παῖδα / δεῖσε γάρ). In A. Ag. 55–9, Pan, along with Zeus and  Apollo, is transformed into a terrible avenging force: ἤ τις Ἀπόλλων ἢ Πὰν ἢ  Ζεύς ... ὑστερόποινον πέμπει παραβᾶσιν Ἐρινύν. Pan’s sinister aspects  are best illustrated in Euripides: in Hippolytos, Phaidra develops a devastating  passion for her step-son, the symptoms of which border on madness (she wastes  away in sickness, refuses food and is entirely wrapped up in her own world). The  chorus, knowing the effects of Pan’s wrath, thinks that she may be possessed by  him or by some other deity associated with frenzy (σὺ γὰρ ἔνθεος, ὦ κούρα, /  εἴτ ̓ ἐκ Πανός... / ἢ μητρὸς ὀρείας; 141–4).9 In Med. 1167–77, Jason’s new  bride, upon putting on the gifts the Kolkhian sorceress sent her, offers, in the  messenger’s words, “a horrible sight” (δεινὸν ἦν θέαμα ἰδεῖν): she becomes  pale, trembles and collapses. An old servant thinks that she must be under the  attack of Pan (Πανὸς ὀργάς ... μολεῖν).10  (e) Pan confuses and strikes terror in military settings. The Athenians,  through the report of their messenger Pheilippides, become aware of the god’s  aid in the victory at Marathon and gratefully introduce his cult in Athens (Hdt.  6.105).11 Aiskhylos in Pers. 447–9 alludes to Pan’s role in the sea-battle of          Salamis. Diodorus Siculus (14.32.3) reports that when the army of the Thirty  Tyrants was set against Thrasymakhos at Phyle (the mise en scene of Dyskolos)  “uproar, called panic, fell upon the camp and they changed its position to a differ- ent place.”12     9 Association of Pan with Kybele appears also in Pi. P. 3.77–9 (ἀλλ ̓ ἐπεύξασθαι μὲν ἐγὼν  ἐθέλω Ματρί ... σὺν Πανί); fr. 95 (ὦ Πάν ... Ματρὸς μεγάλας ὀπαδέ). Cf. Haldane (1968)  18–31; Ar. Av. 745–6 (Πανί ... μητρὶ ὀρείᾳ).  10 In E. Rh. 34–7, in an atmosphere heavy with tension and anxious anticipation, Hektor tells  the sentries that they are announcing things horrible to his ear (δείματ ̓ ἀκούειν, 34) and wonders  whether they fear “the horrible whip of Pan” (ἀλλ ̓ ἦ Κρονίου Πανὸς τρομερᾷ / μάστιγι φοβῇ;  36–7). The authorship of Rhesos, however, has been disputed; it may be an early play by Euripides  or a later work mistakenly attributed to him.      11 The Athenians erected no temple in his honor, but dedicated to him one of the caves under  the Acropolis (Paus. 1.28.4). Thus, in Parker’s (2005) 52 words, they were able “to square the  circle, both granting their new divine guest a place near the heart of things, and also respecting that  strange wilderness that made him unsuitable to occupy an ordinary place.”  12 ἐμπεσόντος δὲ εἰς τὸ στρατόπεδον θορύβου τοῦ καλουμένου Πανικοῦ  μετεστρατοπέδευσαν εἰς ἕτερον τόπον.

For Pan’s military aspects, see Borgeaud (1988)  88–116.  </page> <page sequence="6"> 28 IPPOKRATIS KANTZIOSH  (f) Pan is the master piper and a lover of dances. In hHom. 19.15–16 he is  described as playing delightful music on his pipes (δονάκων ὕπο μοῦσαν  ἀθύρων νήδυμον), an idea repeated elsewhere: cf. Πὰν ὁ καλαμόφθογγα παίζων  (Ar. Ra. 230–1); εὐαρμόστοις ἐν καλάμοις Πᾶνα μοῦσαν ἡδύθροον πνέοντ ̓  (E. El. 702–4); συρίζων θ ̓ ὁ κηροδέτας κάλαμος οὐρείου Πανός (E. IT  1126). The god also delights in dances: ὁ φιλόχορος Πάν, A. Pers. 459; φοιτᾷ  χορηγηθέσι νύμφαις, hHom. 19.3; θεῶν χοροποί ̓ ὅπως μοι ... ὀρχήματ ̓  αὐτοδαῆ ἰάψῃς, S. Aj. 695–701.  (g) Pan is oversexed. The Boston crater (early 5th century) depicts him     pursuing lustfully a goatherd who flees in alarm.13 At S. OT 1098, the chorus  wonders whether Oidipos is the offspring of an illegitimate union of Pan (τίς σ ̓  ἔτικτε Πανὸς ὀρεσσιβάτα πατρὸς πελασθεῖσ ̓;). At E. Hel. 190, Πανὸς  γάμοι is an unmistakable reference to Theoklymenos’ unwelcome sexual  designs against the Spartan queen. Kratinos fr. 359 describes Pan as βαβάκτα  κήλων, and Phot. β 6 informs us that βαβάκτης is ὁ μανιώδης καὶ ἀκρατής  (“madman-like and incontinent”); κήλων “stallion,” can have a sexual sense  (Hsch., Suid., prob. in Plaut. Poen 1162, LSJ). A 4th-century mirror shows Pan  trying to get hold of a Nymph while she is bathing.14   (h) Pan is closely associated with the Nymphs. hHom. 19.3 reports that Pan  wanders with them (φοιτᾷ νύμφαις), while Euripides’ Dionysos mentions their  abodes and those of Pan in the same breath (Νυμφῶν διολέσῃς ἱδρύματα /  καὶ Πανὸς ἕδρας, Ba. 945–52). Archaeological evidence indicates that Pan and  the Nymphs shared cult sites (caves in Marathon, Vari, Kithairon, above Delphi,  etc.).15 In Dyskolos too the god shares his grotto with the Nymphs (36–7).  These observations allow us to draw a reliable sketch of Pan’s persona: he is  the god of the wild (himself half-animal) but also of pastoral activity; he generates  fear, frenzy and confusion in a military or civil context; he loves music and dance;  he is oversexed; and he is frequently associated with the Nymphs. To this let us  compare the Old Grump.     13 James Fund and Special Contribution, 10.185, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston; in Borgeaud  (1988) 74, pl. 4.   14 Züchner, Griechische Klappspiegel 59, pl. 21, in Borgeaud (1988) 76, 223.  15 See Jost (1985) 476; Borgeaud (1988) 107.  </page> <page sequence="7">  “OLD” PAN AND “NEW” PAN IN DYSKOLOS 29   (a) In some ways, Knemon acts like an animal. According to Aristotle,  speech is the distinctive mark of man, but Knemon shuns human conversation.16  He himself complains that men talk to each other while trespassing on his     property (λαλοῦσ ̓ ἐπεμβαίνοντες εἰς τὸ χωρίον, 161) and admits that he  does not address others or speak to them in a friendly manner (οὐ προσειπόντ ̓,  οὐ λαλήσανθ ̓ ἡδέως, 726). Pan himself confides that the old man has never  spoken willingly to anyone in his life or been the first to offer greetings  (λελάληκε ἡδέως ἐν τῷ βίῳ / οὐδενί, προσηγόρευκε πρότερος δ ̓ οὐδένα,  9–10), and Gorgias confirms that he speaks only to his daughter and that he  would not readily do the same to anyone else (προσλαλεῖ ταύτῃ μόνῃ, /  ἑτέρῳ δὲ τοῦτ ̓ οὐκ ἂν ποιήσαι ῥαδίως, 334–5). Later Knemon blasts the  slave Getas with curses, demanding that he stop addressing him: (κακὸν  κάκιστά σ ̓ οἱ θεοὶ / ἅπαντες ἀπολέσειαν εἴ τι μοι λαλεῖς, 601–2).   A more literal association with the animal world comes in 467–8, where  Knemon threatens Getas: to the latter’s pleading μὴ δάκῃς (“Don’t bite me!”),  he responds “That I will, by Zeus, and eat you up alive, too!” (ἐγώ σε, νὴ Δία,  καὶ κατέδομαί γε ζῶντα, 467–8). The same idea occurs in 124, when Pyrrhias  expresses fear that “the old man will eat us up alive” (κατέδεται ἡμᾶς). Animal  imagery appears again in 122, where Knemon is described as ἀνήμερον πρᾶγμα  (“untamed, savage thing”) and in 903, when Getas declares that he must be  domesticated or civilized (ἡμερωτέος).17 Elsewhere Knemon is described as  πατὴρ ἄγριος (388).18  (b) Knemon is distant and reclusive, a point repeatedly emphasized in the  play. Although he lives on his farm at Phyle, within the civic structure of the polis,  albeit at the periphery, Menander presents him as if he were completely removed  from civilization: his environs are three times called an ἐρημία—solitary place,    16 λόγον δὲ μόνον ἄνθρωπος ἔχει τῶν ζῴων: ἡ μὲν οὖν φωνὴ τοῦ λυπηροῦ καὶ ἡδέος  ἐστὶ σημεῖον, διὸ καὶ τοῖς ἄλλοις ὑπάρχει ζῴοις ... τὸ μόνον ἀγαθοῦ καὶ κακοῦ καὶ  δικαίου καὶ ἀδίκου καὶ τῶν ἄλλων αἴσθησιν ἔχειν: ἡ δὲ τούτων κοινωνία ποιεῖ οἰκίαν  καὶ πόλιν, Arist.

[and speech] alone  has the perception of good and bad and just and unjust and the other [moral] qualities. It is the  sharing of these that makes a household and a city.”)  17 The adjectives ἥμερος and ἀνήμερος are associated with animals: χῆνα φέρων ...  ἥμερον ἐξ αὐλῆς, Od. 15.162; ἥμερα ζῷα, Pl. Phdr. 260b; κρέα θήρεια καὶ τῶν ἡμέρων, X. Cyr.  1.3.6; ἀνημερόω, to clear of wild beasts, S. fr. 905; cf.

The first epithet attached to Knemon in the       prologue is ἀπάνθρωπος (6), which, in addition to other meanings (unsocial,  misanthropic, unpleasant), conveys a sense of remoteness and isolation.19 Soon  he is described as loathing crowds and desiring to see no one (οὐ χαίρων τ ̓  ὄχλῳ, 7; ὢ πολυπληθείας ὄχλου. οἴμοι, 166–7; ἥδιστόν ἐστ ̓ αὐτῷ γὰρ  ἀνθρώπων ὁρᾶν οὐδένα, 332–3), and insisting on farming his land all by himself  (συνεργὸν δ ̓ οὐδέν ̓ ἀνθρώπων ἔχων, 329). The adjective μόνος becomes a  motif: ὁ δὲ σκάπτει μόνος, 207; ...αὐτὸς γεωργῶν διατελεῖ / μόνος ...  ἀλλ ̓ αὐτὸς μόνος, 328–33; ὁ γέρων δ ̓ ἔχων τὴν θυγατέρ ̓ αὐτὸς ζῇ μόνος,  30; ἵνα ᾖ τελέως μόνος καθ ̓ αὑτόν, 869. And as if eager to justify at once the  other characters’ perceptions of himself, Knemon’s first words on stage (153– 68) are a condemnation of human society and an explicit reference to his desire  to stay away from it. This mentality prompts him to turn his property into a        no-man’s land which intruders penetrate only at their own risk.   (c) Knemon is a formidable presence who instills strong fear in those who  encounter him. The first report about his ferocity comes from the slave Pyrrhias,  who is completely possessed by panic, believing that he is pursued by this  pugnacious individual. Sostratos is unable to make sense of Pyrrhias’ horror tales  and wonders whether he has gone mad or gotten drunk (μαίνετ ̓ ἢ ἐλθών τι  πεπαρῴνηκε δεῦρο;), to which Khaireas responds that the slave is clearly out of  his mind (παραφρονῶν εὔδηλός ἐστι, 93–4). The impact of the encounter is  severe, because Pyrrhias is described as very upset (ὀδυνώμενος, 125) and is  derided by Sostratos for speaking like a coward (δειλίαν λέγεις, 123). Yet  Sostratos himself, when he first sees Knemon, confesses δέδοικα αὐτόν (151– 2); the same verb is used by Daos: τὸν γέροντα δέδοικ’ (247–8).  (d) On many occasions, Knemon and his world are presented in military  language: in 355 Gorgias realizes that the old man εὐθὺς μαχεῖται πᾶσι, if the  subject of his daughter’s marriage is raised; in 605 Getas refers to him as waging  war on the rocks (πέτραις μαχόμενος); in 869–70 Sostratos acknowledges that  no one can fight against the feisty man’s ways (ὦ τρόπου ἀμάχου). Knemon’s  bellicosity is twice described with the verb ζυγομαχέω (17, 250). When Simikhe  drops the mattock in the well, Getas’ advice to her is ἀμύνου (“Defend yourself,”  588); when Daos realizes that Sostratos has helped Knemon’s daughter get    19 Cf. A.

After Sikon has been unceremoniously expelled from  Knemon’s door, he realizes that he will have a hard time at Phyle, if the locals are  so ready to fight (σφαιρομαχοῦσι, 517).20 Elsewhere Knemon’s abrasive  gestures are described with terms often encountered in battle contexts:  σφενδονῶν βώλοις, λίθοις, 120; βάλλομαι βώλοις, λίθοις, 82. We might add  Sostratos’ reproach to Pyrrhias of cowardice (δειλίαν λέγεις, 123), and  Gorgias’ encouragement to Knemon (after the latter has fallen in the well)  θάρρει, 692, both of which have strong military associations.   (e) Knemon shares his house with his daughter, who faithfully worships the  Nymphs and is close to them (cf. ὦ φίλταται Νύμφαι, παρ ̓ ὑμῶν ληπτέον  [sc. ὕδωρ], 197); Pan himself tells us that his benevolent intervention on her  behalf is generated by her devotion to them (36–9). Moreover, the god assures  the audience that the purity of the girl’s character is the product of her austere  upbringing (35–6), which is informed by her piety toward the Nymphs and the  isolation of her environs.  Knemon is thus portrayed in ways that bring to mind many aspects of the  old Pan: both are remote creatures;21 both generate fear, madness or a                possession-like state in their victims;22 both appear in a military context or are  referred to in military language; both have animalistic traits; both live with either  the Nymphs or a Nymph-like creature; and both set boundaries that may be  crossed only with peril.23 But Pan is also the god of music, dance and good cheer,  who does not like being approached in silence, while Knemon is the opposite.    20 Handley ad loc: σφαιρομαχεῖν is to box wearing σφαῖραι, gloves more formidable than  ἱμάντες; this is a more warlike type of boxing, as we can infer from Pl. Lg. 830b.  21 In 165–6, Knemon complains that he is pursued by intruders to the hill-tops (ἐπὶ τοὺς  λόφους ἄνω), which is reminiscent of the land of Pan (ὃς πάντα λόφον λέλογχε, hHom. 19.6); in  the same manner, the prologue’s reference to Phyle—Knemon’s territory—as a rocky place (τῶν  δυναμένων τὰς πέτρας ἐνθάδε γεωργεῖν, 3–4) brings to mind Pan’s rocky domain; cf. hHom.  19.7; S. Aj. 695–8.  22 The vocabulary used to describe Pyrrhias’ state of mind after his encounter with Knemon  (μαίνετ ̓, παραφρονῶν, 93–4) is identical to that used for Phaidra’s condition in E. Hipp., a  condition the chorus believes may have been caused by Pan (σὺ γὰρ ἔνθεος ... ἐκ Πανός, 141– 2): μανίας ἔποχον ῥίπτουσα λόγον; 214; τὶ τόδ ̓ αὖ παράφρων ἔρριψας ἔπος; 232; Phaidra:  ἐμάνην, 241; τὸ δὲ μαινόμενον κακόν, 248.   23 In Pan’s case, violators of the ἄβατον are stoned, see n. 8 above; in Knemon’s case,  Pyrrhias, who trespasses on his property, is attacked by having stones thrown at him (βάλλομαι  βώλοις, λίθοις, 83; ταῖς βώλοις βαλλεῖ εὐθύς σ ̓, 365–6).  </page> <page sequence="10"> 32 IPPOKRATIS KANTZIOSH  Nor is there any correspondence between Pan’s intense sexuality and Knemon’s  asexual ways. We should recognize, however, that consistency in the grouchiness  of Knemon’s dramatic character would not have allowed Menander to make him  fond of dances, fellowship or erotic relationships, all of which are expressions of  sociability, while Knemon is emphatically anti-social. By introducing these ele- ments into his personality, the playwright would have entirely undermined the  credibility of his character.24 Menander, then, seems to have modeled Knemon  after Pan, but in ways that protect the integrity of the play’s plot.  The influences that shape the portrait of Knemon have been much              discussed. It has been suggested, for instance, that the model for the Old Grump  is Polyphemos,25 or the stereotypical Athenian farmer characterized by  ἀπραγμοσύνη,26 or the misanthrope and ἄγροικος of Aristotle, Theophrastos  and the Peripatos in general,27 or the Timon type as it appears in Lucian and the  Declamations of Libanius,28 or Epicurus’ αὐτάρκης.29 None of the proposed  models does full justice to the character of Knemon. His uprightness (intolerance  of idleness, 356–7, and superficial piety, 447–53; dislike of law-courts, prisons,  wars, 743–5), for example, contradicts the view that he is modeled on               Polyphemos; despite their common cannibalism (literal or figurative) and anti- social attitudes, the Cyclops is a decidedly ungodly figure (νήπιός εἰς ... ὅς με  θεοὺς κέλεαι ἢ δειδίμεν ἢ ἀλέασθαι, Od. 9.273–4). Philosophical types,  meanwhile, fail to explain the presence and function of Pan in the play. If  Knemon is dissociated from him, the god becomes just a touch of local color, a  folklore element only superficially connected to the plot.   It has been convincingly argued, that in Middle and New Comedy the divine  prologue is an integral part of the play, with the god’s traits shaping its themes  and structure: “The prologising god is important not merely for what he says or  for his direct intervention in the action, but also because some of the events of the  play fall into patterns which we recognise as belonging to the god’s sphere or set  of associations.”30 It is significant, I suggest, that Menander’s prologue-speaker    24 A mischievous post-modern reader might see another connection here: Knemon, by being  both a Pan figure and anti-Pan, is an ambivalent character ... just like Pan.  25 Hunter (1985) 173.

By delaying his “own”  self-identification, Pan suggestively puts Knemon, his doublet, in a position usu- ally reserved for the prologue god. From the beginning, then, his speech creates a  duality which is reflected in the play through antithetical elements pertaining to  class, wealth, age, residence and outlook of life.31 Yet, as Pan himself reconciles his  oppositional aspects, so does the play ultimately establish harmony out of seem- ingly incompatible elements, through the god’s benevolent agency. This in turn  produces a deeper thematic coherence based on the resolution of contrasting  traits, corresponding to Pan’s ability to unify opposing aspects in his person. Yet  the Pan of the prologue by himself is hardly a uniter of opposites: his duality    materializes only through the presence of another personage that provides an  alter ego: Knemon.    “New” Pan and the Pan of Dyskolos    While the classical Pan is often a fearsome and unsettling figure reflecting  the world of the wild—and thus underlining his distance from organized          society—the Pan of Hellenistic and subsequent literature (bucolic poetry, Pala- tine Anthology, pastoral novel) is noticeably different. The differences stem not  from an alteration of the god’s fundamental traits, but from an emphasis on     aspects of his character that bring him closer to human life and the workings of  the polis. One of the most pronounced elements now is the unaccustomed      degree of intimacy towards him: a lover invokes Pan as a helper in his erotic pur- suit (Theoc. 7.103–6); a shepherd dying of love wills his pipe to the god, not as  an offering but as a bequest (Theoc. 1.123–30); another shepherd is reluctant to  let Pan have his pipe out of concern lest he come second in the competition  against a skillful human player (Mosch. 3.35). Hunters, shepherds and fishermen  make offerings of all sorts to him; indeed, such dedications represent the majority  of the Pan poems in the Palatine Anthology. Country people are enamored of the  god to the point that they forget Homer and sing of him alone (Mosch. 3.80).   Pan returns this devotion with benevolence and generosity: in AP 16.189  he promises to guard a peasant’s beehives; in AP 9.824 he encourages hunters to  call upon him for help and even wishes them good luck. He is also attached to    31 For a discussion of these elements in the play, cf. Hoffmann (1986) 269–90.  </page> <page sequence="12"> 34 IPPOKRATIS KANTZIOSH  humans emotionally: in Mosch. 3.28 Pan is upset at the death of Bion, and in AP  7.535 he is so inconsolable at the death of Daphnis that he decides to do the    unthinkable: to dwell no longer in the country but to move to the city! His      proximity to human life inevitably brings him closer to human institutions, of  which marriage is among the most fundamental. In Theoc. 27.33–6, in the       context of a marriage proposal, the speaker, invoking Pan, promises eternal      devotion to his beloved. In AP 16.223, in fact, Pan describes himself as πόσις  Ἀχοῦς, “the husband of Echo”! This connection to marriage is nowhere            expressed better than in Longus’ Daphnis and Chloe, in the prologue of which the  author dedicates his story of love and marital bliss to Eros, the Nymphs and Pan  (Proem 2). When Dionysophanes (Daphnis’ father) suggests that Chloe’s father  give her as a bride to his son, he strengthens his proposal by pointing out that the  youths had been cared for by Pan and the Nymphs (4.36). In a twist reminiscent  of Dyskolos, the wedding brings together city and countryside, as the urban      (biological) families of Daphnis and Chloe—both of whom were exposed as  infants and reared by peasants—join the festivities in the abodes of Pan.  Throughout the novel there is a genuine familiarity between the young lovers  and the god, whom they view as their patron and the protector of their love.32 At  the very end, the married couple gratefully builds a temple to be Pan’s residence,  a civilized alternative to the pine tree that had been his home (καὶ τῷ Πανὶ δὲ  ἔδοσαν ἀντὶ τῆς πιτύος οἰκεῖν νεών, 4.39).  In this atmosphere, the element of fear of Pan has almost disappeared. In  Theoc. Epigr. 5, the goatherds go so far as to openly taunt the god, by making  music while he is asleep, well aware that they will disturb him: στάντες ...  ἄντρου ὄπισθεν, Πᾶνα τὸν αἰγιβάταν ὀρφανίσωμεν ὕπνου (“and having  stood ... behind the cave, let us rob goat-mounting Pan of his sleep”). A similar  attitude, although slightly veiled, is conveyed by Theokritos in a poem with a  similar setting (1.16–8). At first sight, the passage brings to mind the fear of the    32 There is one instance in which Chloe is reluctant to accept the oaths of Daphnis made in  the name of Pan, because the god is a lover and yet faithless (2.39). Elsewhere, however, she  understands Pan to be the protector of their love: when Daphnis is discovered to be high-born,  Chloe is afraid that he has forgotten her and has no desire to see her “even while sacrificing to the  Nymphs and Pan” (4.27). During winter, when by necessity they are apart, the lovers pray to the  Nymphs and Pan “to release them from these miseries ... and as they prayed they were seeking  some device by which they would be able to see one another” (3.4). Pan himself understands his  role as that of guardian of their love: when Chloe is abducted by pirates, the god protects her  because “Eros wishes to write a story” (Ἔρως μῦθον ποιῆσαι θέλει, 2.27).  </page> <page sequence="13">  “OLD” PAN AND “NEW” PAN IN DYSKOLOS 35   classical god: τὸν Πᾶνα δεδοίκαμες ... ἔστι δὲ πικρός, καί οἱ ἀεὶ δριμεῖα  χολὰ ποτὶ ῥινὶ κάθηται (“I am afraid of Pan ... and he is bitter and a sour bile  always sits on his nostrils”). But the reader realizes that this is a ploy on the un- named goatherd’s part to avoid playing the pipe himself, so that he may enjoy the  song of Thyrsis, whom he immediately asks to sing—and Thyrsis does oblige— as if the song would not disturb Pan’s siesta!33   In short, the Pan who emerges in literature after the later 4th century cares  about people and intervenes on their behalf, is no longer dreaded, and is closer to  human institutions. This set of traits is similar to those of the Pan of Dyskolos,  who is not reclusive but charming, benevolent and downright urbane. This    transformation begins with Menander’s moving the god’s grotto away from the  wilderness: while in real life Pan’s shrine in the deme of Phyle was on a steep and  inaccessible part of Mt. Parnes, here it is situated among houses, within civilized  society.34 Even if the stage backdrop is intended as a schematic representation of  reality, the position of the grotto is still significant, because its proximity to the  households on either side is connected to the development of the plot, which  requires that Pan be a neighbor of Knemon and his daughter and thus motivated  to intervene. Yet another way Pan shows himself newly at home in the life of the  polis is through the structure of his prologue, which is loaded with figures of  speech: parechesis (ἀπάνθρωπός τις ἄνθρωπος, 6; ἐπιμελῶς ... ἐπιμέλειαν,  37–8), hyperbaton (ἐπιεικῶς ... πολύν, 8), epidiorthosis (ὄχλον λέγω; 8),  metaphor (ζυγομαχῶν, 17), asyndeton (19–23) and periphrasis (ὕπαρχον ἦν,  24). The presence of rhetorical elements calls to mind public address, whether  delivered in the assembly or in court, both domains being central aspects of civic  organization. By having Pan introduce the play (performed in a dramatic  festival), Menander situates him directly in the heart of the polis.  The intellectual agility of the new Pan’s persona is another indication of his  association with the city, since the terms “urban” and “rustic,” ἀστεῖος and    33 Pan as an unthreatening figure appears also in Mosch. 5 and AP 9.341, in both of which he  is depicted as an unsuccessful lover. But his sexual misbehavior does occasionally continue to be  mentioned; see Theoc. Epigr. 3 and AP 9.338, both of which treat the same theme: unsuspecting  Daphnis is sleeping, while Pan and Priapos approach him with purpose. Theoc. fr. 689 refers to the  god as τρύπανον αἰπολικόν (the goatherds’ screw); see also the expression πανεύειν τὰς  γυναίκας, Herakleit. Incred. 2.5 in Photiades (1958) 118.  34 For Menander’s mixture of realistic and unrealistic elements and selective depiction of  Phyle, cf. Osborne (1987) 18; Brown (1993) 192–3.

With the first sentence of the play Pan introduces a metatheatrical element by  alluding to the artificiality of the dramatic space and attempting to engage the  imagination of his audience to transform the skene into the deme of Phyle (τῆς  Ἀττικῆς νομίζετ ̓ εἶναι τὸν τόπον Φυλήν). By sharing privileged                  information, he also transforms the spectators into confidantes, who are thus  enabled to follow the developments on stage with an appreciative eye.37 But the  god’s intellectual agility is primarily revealed through his skillful plan of action,  which starts with inspiring Sostratos not with the brutal, lustful, self-indulgent  passion of a classical Pan, but with love that is chastely aimed toward civil          marriage and the bearing of legitimate children for the community.38 This “new”  Pan provides for the viability and perpetuation of the polis.  It has been suggested that Pan’s direct involvement in the action ends with  Sostratos’ falling in love, and that the developments leading to marriage should  be attributed to coincidence rather than divine intervention.39 It is never said, for  instance, that the dream that makes Sostratos’ mother visit Pan’s grotto and offer  sacrifice is sent by Pan himself. Yet the dream must have been sent by the god,  not only because Pan appears in it, but because the dream becomes the catalyst  for all the subsequent action that results in the fulfillment of his plan.40 The se-   35 Roberts (1984) 11. In Daphnis and Chloe, the city-dweller Klearista, upon hearing from  Lamon the details of the discovery of Daphnis as an exposed infant, is convinced that he is telling  the truth, because a rustic would be unable to make such a story up (πῶς δ ̓ ἂν καὶ ταῦτα  ἔπλασσεν ἄγροικος; 4.20). Cf. Dyskolos 201–2: ἐλευθερίως γέ πως / ἄγροικός ἐστιν (sc.  Knemon’s daughter).  36 Goldberg (1978) 57–68; (1980) 74.  37 The characters, e.g., assume that Sostratos’ falling in love is the result of Eros, and fail to   perceive Pan’s influence on events. The informed spectator, on the other hand, sees the workings of  the divine plan all along, and is thus able to better appreciate the resolution of dramatic tension at  the shrine. Cf. Zagagi (1995) 158.  38 Contrast the effects of being (or being thought to be) ἔνθεος by Pan in Sostratos (44) and  Phaidra (E. Hipp. 141): while the latter’s passion leads to the destruction of her family, the former’s  immediately establishes marital commitment.   39 For authors unwilling to accept a substantial involvement of the god, see Zagagi (1995)  192 n. 27.    40 Cf. Photiades (1958) 108–22, who attributes not only the dream to Pan, but the entire  arrangement of the play’s events. Her endowment, however, of Pan’s presence with strong  theological flavor strains the text. For the religious elements of Dyskolos, see also Keuls (1969) 209– </page> <page sequence="15">  “OLD” PAN AND “NEW” PAN IN DYSKOLOS 37   quence of events is significant: Sostratos’ mother, alarmed by the dream, decides  to sacrifice to Pan; the commotion generated by the preparation for this sacrifice  forces Knemon to stay home; by staying home, Knemon finds himself at the   bottom of the well; falling into the well convinces him to relinquish authority  over his daughter to Gorgias; finally, Gorgias offers his half-sister to Sostratos as  his bride. Knemon declared that he would not give his daughter in marriage  unless he found someone like himself (ἡνίκ ̓ ἂν ὁμότροπον αὑτῷ νυμφίον  λάβῃ, 336–8), but the precondition was virtually impossible to fulfill (λέγεις  οὐδέποτε, 337–8). Knemon’s accident is thus not a digression from the plot but  a necessary measure to remove a crucial obstacle. The god remains firmly in   control throughout.  The central role of Pan in his more domesticated persona is underlined by  the fact that in the later part of the play his shrine is the point of congregation for  Sostratos’ urban family, including his father Kalippides, whose blessing is          required for the marriage to be solemnized. Thus the grotto is transformed from  an abode of the wild into a gentrified locus that accommodates the sensibilities of  city-dwellers.41 Pan himself, through his decision to make Sostratos fall in love,  speaks more the language of the city than of the countryside, since in the play  ἔρως is understood to belong strictly to the former sphere, with its representa- tives Sostratos and Kalippides acknowledging its importance in marriage. Upon  hearing his son’s request, Kalippides is not only willing to accommodate him, but  thinks that there should be no alternative (ἧς ἐρᾷς σε λαμβάνειν / καὶ  βούλομαι καί φημι δεῖν, 786–7), for he knows (γινώσκων) that love adds                                                                           20, who perceives the play as an “adaptation of mystery concepts to a sentimental love story with a  moralizing tendency.” For a more balanced account of Pan’s influence on the action, see Goldberg  (1980) 135 with relevant bibliography. The god here operates differently from other divinities who  appear in prologues, because human action detracts from the developments he desires; see Zagagi  (1995) 159.  41 Cox (2002) 351–8, responding to the emphasis in Ramage (1966) 194–211 on the con- trast between city and countryside, argues that the dichotomy between Knemon’s family and  Sostratos’ is simply one of wealth, rich vs. poor. Instead, Kalippides’ and his wife’s preoccupation  with Phyle rather than the city indicates that they reside at the farm. See also Rosivach (2001) 127.  Yet already in the prologue Sostratos’ family is associated with the city; cf. Ramage (1966) 195. His  mother does indeed sacrifice to Pan, a rural god. But, as Osborne (1987) 192 points out, all the  evidence suggests that the god’s worshippers were not primarily from the countryside, but were  prosperous city-dwellers. For the connection between landowners and city residence, see Finley  (1973) 62–3, who reminds us that from the 5th century, and especially in the 4th, “the movement  into Athens was a shift in residence from the outlying villages to the city proper, not a fundamental  shift in property relations.”   </page> <page sequence="16"> 38 IPPOKRATIS KANTZIOSH  stability to a young man’s marriage (νέῳ γάμος βέβαιος οὗτος γίνεται, ἐὰν  δι ̓ ἔρωτα τοῦτο συμπεισθῇ ποιεῖν, 789–90). Gorgias, on the other hand,  admits that falling in love is an indulgence he cannot afford (οὐδ ̓ ἔξεστί μοι,  βέλτιστε). To Sostratos’ request for clarification, he responds that the problem  is his abundance of hardships, which do not allow him to enjoy recreation (ὁ τῶν  ὄντων κακῶν λογισμός, ἀνάπαυσιν διδοὺς οὐδ ̓ ἡντινοῦν). Although in this  exchange Gorgias does not explicitly cite the fact that he is a farmer as a cause of  his lack of erotic experience, Menander’s framing of his relationship to Sostratos  as counterparts from the country and the city, respectively, makes it clear that the  hardships in question reflect his status as a rustic.42 Ironically, Gorgias too be- comes a collateral beneficiary of ἔρως: not only is he able to marry off his half- sister, but he himself ends up in the bonds of matrimony, as a grateful Sostratos  brokers a second marriage. Pan’s intervention in the play has a ripple effect.    The Pan of Dyskolos and Menander’s Athens    Menander’s life coincided with major developments in Athens, since after  the defeat at Khaironeia by Philip in 338 and the even more devastating outcome  of the Lamian War in 322, the city underwent significant changes both as a      sovereign state and a society. The implementation of new policies by the           Macedonian-imposed oligarchies favoring large landowners at the expense of  small farmers accelerated discord and social disparity.43 This tension between the    42 See also Ramage (1966) 199; Lape (2004) 111.  43 After the defeat in 322, Antipater introduced a measure by which all citizens with a census  qualification of less than 2000 drachmas were disenfranchised (D.S. 18.18.4). Although the value of  this amount in terms of property is uncertain (Baynham [2003] 23), it must have been high  enough to exclude large numbers of citizens. This drastic step by the Macedonians was supported  by the landed gentry, who always looked at the lower strata with contempt. Thus Athens became a  plutocratic oligarchy (cf. IG II2 448 l. 61: οἱ ἐν τεῖ ὀλιγαρχίαι πολιτευόμεν[οι]) in which  approximately 360 wealthy landowners (κτηματικοί) gained control of the political and judicial  processes. Inevitably the gap between rich and poor became even wider, especially since the former  released themselves from traditional civic duties, such as liturgies. Disenfranchisement and  deterioration of conditions (ἐδόκουν σχέτλια καὶ ἄτιμα πάσχειν, Plu. Phoc. 28.4) created  fertile ground for disruptive dissatisfaction on the part of the disadvantaged, who became “trouble- makers” and “feisty” (ταραχώδεις ὄντας καὶ πολεμικούς, D.S. 18.18.4–6), cf. Jones (1957) 35– 6; MacKendrick (1969) 29; de Ste Croix (1981) 292, 301; Konstan (1995) 104; Shipley (2000)  130–3; Baynham (2003) 23; Green (2003) 2–6; Oliver (2003) 41–5.   </page> <page sequence="17">  “OLD” PAN AND “NEW” PAN IN DYSKOLOS 39   wealthy44 and the poor expressed itself also as a juxtaposition between city and  country, since the owners of large parcels of land, accustomed to leisure, prestige,  education and ambition for political dominance, tended to establish themselves  in the city. These realities are felt in New Comedy, a superficially apolitical genre,  which beneath its focus on private life is perhaps to be understood as an              unexpected voice for the democratic ethos of Athens, a protest against the disen- franchisement of large numbers of citizens from the lower strata, and even an  attempt to point out inequities and the measures necessary for reconciliation  across class lines.45 In Dyskolos the polarities of Athenian socio-economics are  mirrored in the background of the major characters: Sostratos’ family belongs to  the upper crust: they own a large property; the father’s name, Kalippides, has an  aristocratic ring;46 and the son pursues the leisure sport of hunting. On the other  hand, Gorgias’ life is at the other extreme, full of deprivation and hard work.47   This opposition between city/affluence and country/lack of resources is  mediated by Pan, a figure embraced by both sides: for the rustics he is a native  son and patron god; for the city-dwellers he is the popular embodiment of the  wilderness and countryside, both of which are now perceived as tamer and more  accessible.48 Thus Pan is close enough to Knemon and his daughter to notice her  pious ways and resolve to reward her, but also relevant enough to Sostratos’    urban mother to motivate her to bring her entire family to the god’s shrine at  Phyle for a sacrifice. Had Pan retained his distant, wild and aggressive persona of  the classical period, he would have not concerned himself with the conception    44 Finley (1973) 56: “In the Greek world, realty was above all agricultural land (understood in  its broadest possible sense, including vineyards, pastureland, and so on). Aristotle did not even  bother to mention houses in his enumeration of forms of wealth, and urban land values are a  relatively modern phenomenon in any serious sense.”  45 Cf. Lape (2004) 1–12; also Ramage (1966) 205–11; Konstan (1995) 190, with reference  to Giglioni (1984). Contrast, e.g., Wiles (1984) 170–80, who understands the playwright as a  proponent of moderate oligarchy; Major (1997) 41–74, who thinks that Menander’s advocacy of  channeling energy toward the οἶκος and away from the polis benefits the interests of Macedonian  imperialism alone.  46 It is one of the names suggested by Strepsiades’ aristocratic, urban wife for their son in  Clouds; cf. MacKendrick (1969) 29; Gomme and Sandbach (1973) 132.  47 Contrast Casson (1976) 57 n. 66: “Really poor peasants did not farm, as Gorgias did, with a  slave at their side.” Also Green (2003) 6. But the slave Daos seems to have a different dramatic  function than being an indicator of Gorgias’ economic status, which has been described repeatedly  as hardly comfortable (23–6, 208–11, 295–6, 343–4, 795). Even in Knemon’s case, we almost  forget that in fact he is not poor.  48 See also Osborne (1987) 192.  </page> <page sequence="18"> 40 IPPOKRATIS KANTZIOSH  and facilitation of a human marriage. The new Pan, however, visualizes  Knemon’s daughter in the role of wife (and mother) and prepares the ground  accordingly, in a setting which elsewhere in New Comedy would produce rape.49  Gorgias’ marriage to Sostratos’ sister, a by-product of Pan’s intervention, under- lines further the god’s ability to remedy the division between country and city  with all its concomitants stemming from socio-economic disparity. The ἔρως the  god inspires is thus strongly egalitarian in nature, because it contradicts the  norms of marriage intended for the reproduction of privileges and preservation  of social stratification,50 breaks barriers, creates economically mixed families, and,  at least in this case, relieves the tension between center and periphery. Even  Knemon, the “old” Pan’s alter ego, joins (albeit grudgingly) in the communal  celebration that brings the play to an end.   By distributing the god’s traits between two characters assigned antithetical  roles, Menander brings out Pan’s perennial ambivalence. In addition, the play- wright seems to recognize the evolution of this duality, which is prompted by the  zeitgeist of his own time: while classical authors present a remote Pan who primar- ily expresses the ferocity of the undomesticated, their Hellenistic counterparts  imagine him as the benevolent deity of a gentler wilderness, a figure rooted in  nature but also willing to accommodate humans in a social context. Menander  employs Pan in the latter capacity in Dyskolos, as the mediator between country  and city. And just as the god acts as a uniter, by adopting the principles of          inclusiveness and greater openness to communal integration, so does the       playwright offer the same values to his fellow Athenians as a healing response to  the deteriorating conditions of his time.
