<plain_text><page sequence="1">Principles of Traditional African Art in Yoruba Thorn Wood Carvings: Conversations with Titi Adepitan Excerpts from interviews by Sarah Krose, Monday, 24 July- Friday, 28 July 2000, The Museum of Anthropology, The University of British Columbia, Vancouver, British Colum? bia, Canada Sarah Krose: How do the thorn carvings fit in with more contemporary Nigerian art in terms of, well, contemporary Nigerian art, tourist art? What place do they have in the spectrum? Titi Adepitan: They don't quite represent the very core of Yoruba art, because they are tourist art, as you observed. For one thing, the Yoruba imagination is a rigorously religious one and works like these can only be defined in terms of what serious artists would do for recreation, you know, more or less like creating a lighter side to their more serious engagements. And the figures actually illustrate this. They depict people in various poses, various attitudes, at various chores, you know, that capture the everyday, the humdrum. But I don't think they really do speak for the (pause) soul of the Yoruba approach to art in a fundamental sense. . . . They look a lot to me like just marginal art, but not marginal in the sense of cheap or low or debased. Marginal in a sense that is very, very unique, to the Yoruba conception of art in general. You'11 find it in music, in writing, in every kind of creativity. The serious artist who does serious work, and has time once in a while to create things on the lighter side. I mean, it's very central to the Yoruba reception of creativity. Could you comment on the state. . . . These were carved around early 1970s, 1972 is when they were collected. Could you comment on the state of Yoruba society around that time, maybe what the artist was, at least in a political sense, perhaps. By 1972, Yoruba society couldn't really be described in purely homoge- neous terms. You want to keep in mind that Yorubaland has been the center of the Nigerian nation for almost a century now, from 1914 actually. That is the date of the amalgamation of the different provinces into the country of Nigeria. And what that means is, people come from various parts ofthe country to flourish in Lagos. Politics, commerce, education, all kinds of things invariably took their shape and definition in Lagos. Lagos is not quite the heartland of Yorubaland in terms of culture and things like this. Lagos is too cosmopolitan, too "generic," too . . . almost fake. For statements on culture you need to go to places like Ilesa or Osogbo, Abeokuta. Abeokuta for instance is very noted for tie-dyed fabrics, batiks; to Ibadan, the city of Nigeria's first university. And clearly by 1972, all of these things had taken shape. It's not quite correct as I read somewhere just now, to suggest that culture, society was at a very pristine stage, where people are drumming, people are dancing?they "dance automatically"? as somebody said (laugh). I read that and I was amused. The only thing Research in African Literatures Vol. 34, No. 1 Spring 2003: 96-125</page><page sequence="2">Titi Adepitan 97 is that many of the carvers themselves must have been, you know, country folk, and so they tended to recreate visions of the countryside from their own imagination that was itself limited by the quality of their exposure or non-exposure. I think that is very, very important. If a student of art, a carver or an artist who had a Western training in these things were to do something like this, you would find nuances of interpretation, you know, deriving directly from their own contact with other realities from across the world, I suppose. Is there a symbolism associated with the tortoise? Oh yeah, the Tortoise is the archetypal Yoruba trickster figure in the same sense as the Raven in First Nations folklore, or the spider in West Indian folklore. The tortoise is the archetypal figure of the trickster. In what context? In a myriad of contexts. The Tortoise is the animal who is wisest in the animal kingdom. The smartest, the cleverest, the most devious, the most mischievous, the most self-destructive, the one who gets punished for his own machinations and so on and so forth. And several stories are built; virtually every single trickster story is about the tortoise. He is clever. We have tons of such stories. The wisdom, at least as the Tortoise stands in North American literature, the wisdom of the Tortoise is associated with its age. Precisely the same in Yoruba culture. The wrinkles on his neck attest to that, you know, longevity. He's wise; he bides his time. He can't walk very fast but if he must take part in a race with a swift-footed animal like, let's say, the cheetah, the Tortoise will plant members of his family at every milestone, and say, "Oh, let's start." And the cheetah will take off, and get to point "A," find the tortoise there ahead of him and continue to run, get to point "B" and find the tortoise ahead of him. And he'll run himself to death. He'll drop dead at some point and there will be a Tortoise to take the credit (laugh). Many of the figures on the table right now appear to be figures with musi- cal instruments, and I was wondering if you could pick out a few and talk about what they're doing and maybe comment on the atmosphere in general. Music in general in Yoruba culture is a form of dialogue, a mode of dis- course, a form of communication. The musician?he doesn't compose, he doesn't perform in isolation. Incidentally, one of my favorite poems is one by Nicolas Guillen. He was a Cuban poet. He has a poem called "The Muse" in which he tries to appraise the status of the performer?the poet particularly. In olden times, Guillen writes, the poet performed before an orchestra and a public, but now the poet likes to shut himself up in his study, in his cubicle, and grinds out thoughts that he expects his readers and audience to decode. Clearly you have here entertainment in a tradi- tional sense. Several of the pieces illustrate what goes on between say, two</page><page sequence="3">98 Research in African Literatures performers or between a performer and a celebrant, a performer and a dancer, sometimes between a male performer and a female performer. We've already talked about this?the man trying to show his dexterity (points). Here is a drummer, another drummer?this is a different kind of drum (Af403). Here you have a male talking drummer engaging a female performer, I think, manipulating the maraca. So these are two perform? ers and the woman is enjoying it because it's not just about handling her maraca, it's also about dancing (Af402). There you have two other per? formers. There's a female performer, I think there is a child behind her, but I can't see clearly from here. Is it a child? Yes. A-ha. It's a child. Gestures like this go all the way back to what we said earlier about the woman who is into so many roles in society?the mother, the entertainer, the performer, the musician, the poet sometimes. Now, I'm not quite sure whether they're intended to represent the same atmosphere. They may simply have been represented on the same platform. They may not really interact in the same way you might say for this. Is there anything else that you might want to comment about these? Not much except that we might also consider building something of a statement for what all of this adds up to. What are the artists, the carvers who operate this medium?what are they up to? What aspects of society, of reality are they trying to depict? Could we say more than they dare claim for themselves? Could we impute claims to them that are not even perti- nent to the very medium itself? I mean, I think such issues are really very important. I think it's interesting too, like I mentioned before, that the artist did these specifically for the collectors, so I'm not sure whether they said, "We want you to make carvings of this or that" or whether he felt that he could only talk about certain themes with them. In any case, the medium is so context-specific. A platform, a figure, a single moment frozen like a picture frame in time and space. It's not really the medium for the involved metaphor of the master artist who is straining after effect, or you know. . . . It's interesting how the facial features on the carvings don't seem to change. It's because of the medium. The face has to be realized in miniature. What's the size of the head in many of these objects in proportion to the body? It's almost infinitesimal, so that the prominent landmarks on the face can only be represented by tiny lines and dots, tiny slits for eyes, pinches for nostrils, another slit for the mouth. But clearly this woman is represented more amply around the chest area. I mean she's topless and she has a loincloth around her waist. I would say that from the neck down there is a lot more attention to proportion than with the head. It could very well be that the head, you know from what Fve seen so far with these carv-</page><page sequence="4">Titi Adepitan 99 ings, the head is just stylization?it's not really made to convey expression of whatever kind?distress, joy, anger, whatever. Of course it has its bumps, noses, eyes, mouth, ears, but basically they're bland. You're not going to get the interpretation we are attempting from these faces. The expressions seem to be conveyed more through the actions than the features. Yeah, I would call these carvings done more along the lines of what in lit? erature we would call gestic. Gestic symbols, from gesture. I mean, she is dancing, she is crying, you don't see tears flowing down her face. She has her hands thrown back, so the motif is gestic, you know. You decipher what they are supposed to be doing from the gestures they are permitted. Now this figure here (Af 386), we have a seated man with a beard and what appears to be two gourds and a?I think those are cups of some kind. The gentleman is an old man. The beard on him is a stock representation of age, not really of hairiness. Actually, there is a proverb about grey hair being for the very old, the beard being for the elderly, and the moustache for the, you know, uppity young man (laugh). The beard is just to show that he is not very old, but he is an elder, and he's sitting against a background that I am very familiar with. He's drinking palm-wine. The containers are gourds, as you correctly observed. Even the cups are from the same material, it's just that they are smaller gourds and they've been sectioned right across so they can hold a much smaller quantity of wine. And as is the practice, particularly in the villages, the larger gourds merely serve to hold as much as possible, depending on the crowd, the number of people. Your exact portion is actually served out in the smaller versions of the same gourds, the same way that you might say that you could have your beer served in a pitcher here. And it's then rationed out in cups. I mean, you don't go straight for the tank for your own fill, you get what you can handle. The smaller gourd is in his left hand; the cup from the same material is in his right hand. Now you were talking about the beard being a sign of his status as an elder. Not of status. I'll give you the proverb just in case. The Yoruba proverb about facial hair is Eewu Vogbo, iriin'gbdn Vagbd, mamu ni t'dfojudi. Eewu Vogbo: "White hair is old age." Iriin'gbdn Vagbd'. "the beard is for . . ." how should I say? The beard is for . . . not adulthood, because that is like common currency, because once you are past eighteen you are an adult. Irun'gbon Vagba simply means that it's only elders who have that to show. A mature man. Yeah, for maturity. Thank you. Mamu?actually, the word Mamu does not quite mean "moustache." The proper name for moustache is irun'mu, that is "hair across the lips." Mamu simply is a play on this very context?don't drink. When you dip your moustache in a cup of palm wine, it collects suds and froth and everything all over. It's like you use it as a sieve (laughs).</page><page sequence="5">100 Research in African Literatures It has a practical purpose. It has a practical purpose. And for the young teenager or man in his early twenties, that's what you want to show off with, "Oh, I have facial hair now." So, they would rather not represent the elder in this particular carving with a moustache because it doesn't really give him his proper due. On the other hand, a beard says that maybe he is old enough, strong enough, bold enough, confident enough to grow one. But it has little to do with status. Actually in Yorubaland, a man of position like a king wouldn't grow a beard. I mean, it's very interesting. There are things they wouldn't consider proper, like having a bushy face. So the final part of the proverb: Mamu ni Vafojudimeans the moustache is the symbol of insubordination! Here is the piece that started this project more or less, the mammy wagon that was in Exhibit "A" last year (Af416). It's probably the most colorful piece. It's a bus that tries to capture the electric atmosphere of public transporta- tion in Nigeria. In front, you have a driver who has the steering wheel firmly in his grip. Beside him you have a female passenger making wild gestures. Her mouth is open, she's looking ahead but for all you know, she may not see anything. She may be so prepossessed with the point she's trying to communicate to the driver that nothing else in the world is likely to matter. At the back of the bus you have other passengers, some of them?virtu- ally all of them in this example?actually face backwards. Which is odd because the very nature of this means of transportation is that you find whatever way you can of sitting, because you are not really its main pay- load. The main payload is the goods and foodstuffs and groceries and things that seem to enjoy pride of place?even here. If you look, you'll find pots. There are all kinds of objects?baskets, pots, things?those are the primary goods. And I suppose its overall design is influenced by this fact that it's supposed to be a produce lorry?something to carry farm produce from the hinterland to the city centers, the markets and the city centers. So the travelers just sit however they can. They hang on, more or less, and the bus goes on. It's called "mammy wagon." I've never really tried to see what that name is supposed to mean or what phase in the history of the country it's supposed to be highlighting. In the riverine areas for instance, part of the mythology is of mermaids. Half women, half fish. Howso? Because of the river culture. I've seen exhibits here from Eastern Canada, maybe Inuit carvings that pay tribute to the same personage of folklore? the mermaid; but in Nigeria they're known as "mammy water," "mother of the river," I suppose. "Mammy water," or "mamm)i water" (stress on the last syllable) ?I think they also use the same expression across West Africa. So the idea of a mammy wagon certainly must have derived from the idea of a mother figure, not in any human or even anthropomorphic sense, but simply in the sense of something that's huge, that's big, something that can hold things, something that's bigger than ordinary. A bus this size is big. It's a wagon. I suppose there must have been much smaller wagons, so this</page><page sequence="6">Titi Adepitan 101 is the bigger?the mammy wagon. But in addition to this, there are also a number of other names for it. Actually the idea of the mammy wagon is no longer quite prominent. You do have buses like this in Nigeria but they are very few and far between. The contemporary name for them is molue. Molue is a corruption of the English phrase? "mold it." To mold. To maul, actually. When those buses first came on Nigerian roads, they were very prone to accidents. When such an accident happened, you couldn't tell limbs from faces and torsos. Everything had been twisted beyond recogni- tion. They had been re-molded. It wasn't really a term of approval; it was an indictment of its proneness to mishaps. The victims were, like, mauled, or re-molded, you know, mangled by metal, so they gave it the name, molu e, which was the closest the Yoruba language would appropriate the word "mold." It also goes by the name "bolekaja"?"Step down and let's flght." Now, bolekaja is closer to the situation that this bus is trying to describe, because if you take a look again at the woman by the driver's side, she's making wild gestures, talking and yakkity-yakking on and on. Almost cer- tainly she'11 be complaining that "Oh, you left one of my items behind at the garage. If you don't turn round and go back for it, I'm not going to pay you." And the driver will say, "Look! Stop nagging! I want to concentrate on ..." (Woman) "Leave me alone. You have left my pot of palm oil! I'm not going to pay you! And what's the matter with you anyway? That's what you did last week! That's what you did last month! That's what you did last year!" And she'll go on and on and on and on! If it's not with the driver, it might be with any of the passengers?"Oh, you are crushing my vegetables!" "I'm going to throw this thing down," and "Since when did you begin to come here? Why are you so cocky? I mean, we've been here since your fathers and forefathers and so forth." And they'11 go on and on, and at a point one of them will say, "Why don't you step down and let's sort it out?" Bo'le k'aja: it's a sentence. Bo'le: step down. K'aja: let's fight, let's sort this out once and for all. Sometimes they have bus conductors. The Yoruba word for bus conductor is agbero, the one who collects fares from the passengers. We sometimes also call them touts. They are as terrible as you'll ever get. Maybe we have the prime selection of bus conductors and touts anywhere in the world for their cantankerousness. I mean, they're always talking and talking and making trouble. And sometimes they're the first to throw such a challenge to passengers. "Oh, you are crazy! Because you are well dressed? You think I chose this job because I didn't go to school? I actu? ally wanted to do it, you hear? I wanted to do it!" It's an excuse, of course. He's bemoaning his lot. "Look! Because you are all dressed up, because you go to school? You are stupid! Step down and let's sort it out." Bolekaja. So that's how the bus?actually, there are several versions. This is almost exactly as it used to be. There is of course, a front glass window, and that's all you ever get. The rest is just wood outside of the engine. The rest of the chassis I mean is just wood. You have the usual front glass paneling. Every thing else is just wood. And then there will be inscriptions all over. Some of them will be very frightening. I recall that when I was younger, when I was just a small boy of six or seven, there was a whole fleet of them operated by one wealthy nuisance in town, and the inscription on it was Pasa?that's</page><page sequence="7">102 Research in African Literatures the sound of the speed, the reckless speed, pronounced, Kpa-salll Pasa. And then they numbered them?Pasa #i, Pasa #2, up to about twelve. On others you might find an inscription like Dagbere?"Say your final farewell." I mean, you see how ominous that is? Dagbere?your final farewell, before youleave! (Laughs) Now this mammy wagon has lovely bright shades of blue and green with pink potted plants. Were they all decorated somewhat or ... Almost invariably they come decorated, not with pots and plants like this, but the ones from the east, the eastern part of the country always carried paintings of?it's funny?Tarzan fighting a lion, or Samson. You know, they are stock figures from the Bible, figures from folklore or popular literature. The funny thing is that such paintings, because they're by roadside artists are not really supposed to be an advertisement for skill, for flair, or any? thing, as I said. So Tarzan may have a bicep here that's this huge and the other bicep may be twisted out of turn (laughs). Your lion may have fangs that are so long and then somewhere around the neck, he'll be so thin that you'11 wonder if the lion.(pause) How he could keep his head up! I was saying that there is something quite bothersome about the recurrence of objects of traditional belief in the works of the artist who is generally credited with making many of these exhibits we're talking about. And I put it down to maybe an urge to satisfy the needs, the requirements of his commissioners, that is those who commissioned the project. Clearly, an artist who has the promise of good money and the once-in-a-lifetime patronage of visitors from other lands, may be forgiven for going out of his way to scrape the bottom ofthe barrel, to show how culture?at least in his imagination?should be. But you may like to take a second look at the pho? tograph of him?you'11 find that he doesn't quite look like someone who would have much power of discrimination. How much of Canada would you be willing to tell me as a visitor? How much of it is my business anyway? How much of it is my place? What could I possibly ask you about Canada that wouldn't sound offensive? But you're able to decide because with your level of education, your location in society will warn you to beware of the Greeks, even when they bring gifts?you know? So you learn to give information based on your assessment of what or who your interlocutor is. Here, you have an artist who clearly was willing to do anything just to. . . . And I suppose that because he's also part of that level of culture, he would think that everything would receive the endorsement of his visitors the way he believed it should. For instance, the figure we have here (Af418) depicts a traditional maternity scene. This woman is giving birth. There is a midwife, maybe two midwives. One of them is a male with a beard, with a skirt. He is topless. The other figure is ofa woman who is also topless. She has a wrapper?it's not a skirt this time, and head tie, which is again, out of place in this situation. But I would just like to let you know that the very subject is misrepresented. Midwifery is one of the time-honored profes- sions in Nigeria and it takes no superstition with it. It takes nothing with</page><page sequence="8">Titi Adepitan 103 it. Just the requisite training that you need to have about how to relate to a woman who is in labor. And I also know that there is no mystique about it. There are women who deliver themselves. It's not about charms, it's not about superstition, it's not about amulets, and it's not about belief. It's just about what has to be done. It's a form of first aid. So this overdressing of the situation?people holding gourds and rattles and amulets and. . . . It's what they want to see. Midwifery is not... I mean, I don't want to say anything against the artist, but there is too much misinformation here, believe me. It's the easiest of all the professions I can attribute to women. The woman is in labor, you send for a notable midwife and she comes?"Water. Soap. I want this. Do you have oil" Every woman knows how to get her things ready well before then. That's even in the villages. No single woman I know would go to a local midwife in the towns, not to talk of the cities?they go to hospitals. So, the man has no place?at all. It's not a man's place. Which reminds me that in Nigeria, a husband is not obligated to be there when the wife is delivering a child. He may be outside of the ward, going nuts. It's here in the West that the husband has to hold your hand and stroke your fingers and say, "Oh honey, push!" We don't do that. So, the presence of the male figure is almost a gross misrepresentation. I'm not saying that in some dim past, a man couldn't have done the same thing or maybe a man used to be there. But it's not this elaborate ritual, you know?a shrine with all kinds of horns and amulets sticking out of pots and images and even at the foot of the couch you have several other things. And here is this woman in labor who just lies back, supine, waiting for some miracle to happen. It's a misrepresentation. What is the significance of the horns sticking out of the shrine objects? The horns are containers for holding concoctions. Not concoctions in the sense of things that are meant to be eaten, or any such thing. Concoctions simply in the sense of whatever properties, whatever ingredients go into building a charm. Because it tapers all the way down, you have a clean handle, and they normally load it with all kinds of things, traditional soap, you know. And it's supposed to be so powerful for incantation, for the power of sanction, the power of command. "Oh, I say to you let this be" and you lick it. You know, it's all so funny, but again, many Nigerians may not have seen a single one. It's a relic of the past (Af351). Here is a fowl. This woman is making a sacrifice, most likely of appeasement. She may want to be a mother and needs to offer a fowl to the goddess of whatever whatever. Or she may be embarking on a project and she needs to make an appease? ment to the gods, and that's what is being depicted here. But the man has created some of these objects in a way that you don't even find in the areas where those things are still in practice. I'll tell you one of those things that I really object to: the presence of masks. Such representations are very few and far between in Yoruba iconography. You can carve masks and adorn walls the same way that First Nations artists carve faces into totem poles and house posts; but I can't really conceive of shrines or shrine places in terms</page><page sequence="9">104 Research in African Literatures of the dominance, in terms of the preponderance of masks that the artist seems to be giving muscle to. The occasional mask? They would be more idol figures, or ... For certain beliefs, you might have figurines?effigies done on a small scale or in miniature. But usually what you have are objects, implements. One of the most respected Yoruba gods, Ogun the god of iron, has no images: any metal will do?a cutlass, a knife. He's supposed to be the god of metallurgy so anything that's iron or metal goes. There's no representation of him in anthropomorphic form, and that goes for virtually... Obatala doesn't have any particular images. Shango neither. For Shango, for instance, it would just be palm fronds. So the presence of so many masks and faces?it jars in my ears, I can't really identify with it. We have another two more, the same. . . . Oh, there's a whole bunch of them! There's a whole set of the same images. That's interesting. You may see why I think he probably did them after a fashion: "Oh, they seem to like this, make more of it." Here (Af363), this looks like a similar effigy scene with a larger number of figures gathered around in a circle. The effigies are in the center. Again, it's a scene from a shrine setting. There are the usual objects and totems that make up the shrine. There are worshipers, there is the priest, I think?no, the priestess in this case. There is the priestess; that's why she's unadorned. She carries a horn, she's topless, she's on her knees. So is this one here too (points). Yeah, the one on this side is also on her knees, but she has something on her head. And I would say that it's the priestess who should properly have something on her head while before a shrine, but for some reason, this artist keeps portraying the supplicants as quite at liberty to express them? selves whichever way they please, particularly in the way they dress. Being topless is not requisite to that sense of awe or respect or reverence, but clearly, there are so many men here that it would take a priestess?and a very old one at that to be topless. You may like to know I keep on highlight- ing the question about the different states of undress because not dress- ing properly is not a Yoruba thing. Women don't walk about naked. They don't even walk about topless. The average Yoruba person?including my humble self?we're so very self-conscious. I was telling a friend last year, a Kenyan friend, that look, we must begin to consider in Africa, the free- dom to express ourselves with our bodies as one of the major steps to take in order to . . . I mean, there is nothing shameful about it. It's when you put the intention behind it that it begins to acquire color and character. I mean, why be astounded simply because you see a woman's thighs? Why be baffled if a woman walks down Broadway in the summer in a skimpy? sometimes a bra and that's all. And I said to her, we have to learn to accept it as normal, otherwise we'll be so inhibited. The average Yoruba woman won't ever wear?go about topless for whatever reason. If she has to do this</page><page sequence="10">Titi Adepitan 105 before a shrine every male has to leave. "At this point we want you out ofthe room because there are certain things we need to do." Maybe one or two males who are so crucial to the rites that need to be performed may stay. So, there is some level of gratuitousness in representing women with their tops off. It doesn't quite represent the position of things. Believe it or not, even my own brothers, I can't imagine how they would look naked. Maybe when we were young, but certainly not from the time we became adoles- cents. It's not something you just throw into whatever form of expression. There are other parts of Nigeria, to be honest with you, where it doesn't matter. It's not that they are barbaric, it's not that they are savage, it's just that they recognize it as a very pointed statement on sexuality. From Benin actually?that's Midwestern Nigeria?from Benin to the Delta, women still today wear blouses that have very wide and low necklines. And part of the tease is to let the blouse slip across the shoulder so that you do a double take. And it doesn't matter to them. If they have to perform a dance, a traditional dance, they can take their top off. They do that quite often. They do that a lot, particularly the back. But the Yoruba person on the other hand, not only wears a top?we call it buba?that has a high neckline, she also goes about with a shawl at times, draped around her neck. Fm not saying that it's ideal just because it seems to ensure some measure of propri- ety. My point of view is that actually we should be a lot more adventurous. But it's also wrong, by the same token, to keep on representing women who wear elaborate headgear, yet at the same time remain topless. It doesn't stand to reason at all. (Af408) Now, this next woman gets into the weaving we were talking about the other day. Yeah, she's at the loom. The fabric on top is not quite what you get from the loom as it is. The loom produces thin strips of finely woven, sometimes also quite coarse, cloth. We call it aso-oke. Aso-dke, because okesimply means the north, and it used to be the specialty of people from the middle belt of Nigeria. And to those in Southwest Yorubaland?that's Lagos, Ogun, Oyo states and so on?it is oke, it is up north. So that's what she's doing, she's weaving. It's just like representing what they do all the time. Again with her baby on her back. . . . There doesn't seem to be any with just children. All of them are adults. Children, if they're there are just in partial roles. No, I think the point of babies strapped to the woman's back is simply that, here is a nursing mother who still has to perform some jobs, duties, obliga- tions. Sometimes when I see parents, not just here in North America, but in other places, who strap their kids to their front rather than to the back, I wonder: Now what's the difference? What is the choice to make? What choices are there to make between being a kangaroo, being a marsupial, and being an African woman carrying a baby on her back? A marsupial car- ries its young in a pouch in front, in other cultures women prefer the back. The point is that you have a form of parental care that ensures warmth. You strap a child to your back; you create a coziness that goes beyond anything.</page><page sequence="11">106 Research in African Literatures There is bodily contact, the ends of the cloth are tied so firmly around the baby's neck and tucked under the armpit, and there is also a sash that comes with it. There is always a sash that holds the base of the baby's?just between the backside and the midsection and then the woman knots it so that it's out of the question that the child will fall. Actually, in some parts of Yorubaland it's taboo for a child to fall off a woman's back. It's taboo. You don't do it, but I suppose there must have been some reason. If you taboo, you compel everyone to be that much more careful. Still, I find it interesting that in all of these figures, if they are supposed to be representations of everyday life, I would think that a common thing that you would see would be scenes of children playing, and there doesn't seem to be anything like that. Yes, another point?well, I don't think that's going to be strong enough to answer your query. I was going to say that the figures are so stylized you can't tell whether some are supposed to be children, but I won't say that because clearly, if they were children, they wouldn't don the traditional cap. I see a number of pieces here, like that, like the one?here . . . (Af430) Is this one a mother disciplining her child? I don't know, because the stick she is holding is a T-joint stick and that's not the object for spanking a child with . . . . If it were a cane, it would be much thinner. The child wouldn't be standing with hands akimbo, and I don't know. And she's not washing him, she's not cleaning him up. I really can't say. And she's all dressed up for the quite routine business of tidying up a child. I don't know that she's spanking him, I have no idea. Except that by now .... Okay, that's the sash. It doesn't sit here normally. It sits right here on the bump between the baby's butt and the woman's waist. The legs hang down by the woman's side. But I don't know. I don't want to say that she's spanking him. You don't do that with a T-joint stick, I mean you find a strip of. . . Still on the mother theme (Brings Af405 forward) (Af405) They're washing a child. Holding (the baby) upside down like that? It's the kink in the medium, which gives the impression of holding it upside down. Oh fine; it's not that she's washing.. .just a minute. Okay, she's wash? ing. There are two variations on this position. This is one. The woman is washing. It's not like holding a child upside down. It's not possible to hold a child upside down and get away with it, you know. . . . This is what they do. When you sit on a stool, your two knees are even and you put your baby across your knees. Of course you roll up your loincloth and then you put the head . . . . . . Across your arm. Yes. And then you shift position, and then you hold it and in any case, there's always somebody nearby to offer a hand, if you don't know what to</page><page sequence="12">Titi Adepitan 107 do. The other is when a child is being weaned and you think that it may not yet be used to regular food. By regular, I don't mean adult food, but maybe from breast feeding to a meal plan that may include soft stuff like pap, like custard and things like that. The word I came across in the interview is "force feed." I don't know what way to call the real thing because it's not "force feeding." You'd say o nro omoyen (she is feeding the child). You adopt more or less the same position, except that this time the baby's head is . . . not upright, but it has a lot more leverage than when you are just washing and you are trying to let the water slide down. You hold the child and put your hand to the mouth, pour liquid through your hand, and?maybe the child starts to cry. And you pour it so cleverly. It's not true that people do it and children die, it's not true. Of course there are ways that you can do such things, and usually it's done when a child is sick and wouldn't accept food by any other means. If not, bottle-feeding is?I really can't recall any member of the last two, three generations that wasn't bottle-fed. So you feed him, and as soon as he's done, you tidy up. I've seen that it's done in almost every situation where the recipient is helpless. Just sometime last year, I saw footage on CNN of a zoo somewhere in Asia. The snake sec? tion had trouble with certain species. They wouldn't eat. Once they were hungry beyond a certain point they continued to simply starve to death. So what they did was, some of the attendants would get hold of the snake, force the jaws open, and slide food in. As soon as the food went beyond the throat, they'd leave it and then it'd take time to digest and then come back to life, you know, so to say. You wouldn't just do this to a child who's eating normally. It can be messy, that's why you have this bowl holding the drains and drops and every thing. You don't just do it, it's when a child is ill and you think that oh, left to its own design, you might be in trouble unless you do something drastic. Now with all these different depictions of everyday life, it really causes me to wonder what sort of things wouldn't be portrayed in thorn carv? ings, what wouldn't be captured. Is there any thing that would be taboo or something the artist might shy away from? Of course, yes. But such choices are not really passed across as fiats, as regulations, as decrees. It takes a lot of factors: the carver's own location in relation to society itself, his beliefs, the level of his education, his assump- tions, his motives. For instance, such a carver had better not have enemies or rivals or people he doesn't like. He'll just keep making caricature upon caricature, and that's very common in Nigeria where creative expression is also social commentary. In the late '80s there was a Nigerian musician who had to go to jail for a conviction that had to do with Indian hemp?mari- juana. And when he came out, the first album he made, a whole side of it was devoted to lampooning the journalist, the female journalist who set him up?and the song was about the size of her cleavage, something like, oh, each side of her chest is 50 kilograms! I still like to sing that song because it takes the kind of evil genius that you can only come across in art? ists who wield an unapologetic claim on license! Just home in on one point and make hay with music. You know that the sentiment is not quite?it's not</page><page sequence="13">Af351: Courtesy UBC Museum of Anthropology, Vancouver, Canada.

Lampoon and satire in general are central to Yoruba art, so someone like this had better not have enemies. Certainly he's not going to fight shy of. . . Or else they might show up in his . .. A-ha. And as far as religion goes, certain things will naturally be inappro- priate, be deemed inappropriate. If you create a church scene, and I think we have a model across from here, it's because you're trying to show that moment, that space as it is. It may be a lot more neutral than we realize. The carver is not going to slant the angle of vision against the Church. Then, also remember what I said, this form by its very nature is very limited in its expressiveness. It's more or less like still paintings, pictorial representation. There is no . . . the artist doesn't try beyond what's necessary to insinuate, or to tuck in or to slant, or even strain after effect, get a scene. In literature we would call this a tableau vivant, a moving picture, I mean, just freeze it in time and space. That's a very appropriate description for this. A-ha. You just freeze it and you go. Of course, it's up to whomever is familiar with the scene that is so captured to keep on adding on, as I've been doing. "Oh this woman is not just here, it's a market situation. How does a market situation look in West Africa?" There will be other traders beside her and around her; there will be people milling around. There will be haggling and bargaining, there will be very specific exchanges of words sometimes, and so on and so forth. You keep on building up on the emblematic moment that's been captured in thorn wood. That's it. One of the things in the interview with the collector. They mentioned that they had a piece, or rather a scene depicting a human sacrifice, and they didn't feel that was appropriate to donate that to the museum. So it would certainly be a very . . . very powerful piece to show. I guess that sort of goes with the question of what wouldn't be shown. You see, it's a question that's fascinated me since in January of this year when I taught Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart. I had to read the novel over again. I've been reading it since high school. But for the first time, maybe because of my location here in Canada, itjust suddenly struck me that, could this guy have said too much depicting traditional practice, people beheading children, because some moribund superstition says that an appeasement is needed, you know? And at the point I almost felt embar- rassed, but again I took a second look and said oh, this is an act of courage. Clearly the right that an artist?and by that I mean any creative person, an artist, poet, writer, whoever?the right they reserve to depict reality, however they conceive of it, says something for the integrity that ought to come with the creative process. You don't deodorize something that's smelly simply because it's from your own side, or demonize something else because it's not from your side. If human sacrifice was a part of life in certain cultures, and I can't think of any cultures that never really passed</page><page sequence="20">Titi Adepitan 115 through that phase, you could have representations of it in writing, in art, in painting. Not in music, because music is a lot more contemporary, and it has that built-in capacity to edit itself, to update itself. Whatever is not appropriate is dropped off as a matter of course. So if they have the integ- rity to represent what used to be rather than what continues to be and that may be deplorable, I'd say that they are credible witnesses to the march of history. Here at the Museum of Anthropology you find that there're several door-posts and totem poles that depict severed human heads in the hands of other human figures. I don't see those and conclude that oh, the artist is trying to consecrate a moment in the here and now. It may very well be something that harks back to some far-flung time in the past. Yet there is a danger in that. Especially in the context of these other everyday figures, that a Westerner like the collectors might conceive of that... . . . as contemporary. . . . as contemporary, and take that in the wrong way. That's true. That's why I would?if I had a way of being a contributor to the manufacture?is it manufacture or preservation??of culture. . . . There are certain things that I would certainly not want to go into, if only because it's much better to let the dead lie dead and buried. I mean you don't go depicting practices that even the people from those same areas can no longer identify with. I'll give you an example. There was a part of Nigeria that in times past used to abandon twins, because they were considered bad luck. You'll come across that fact in history books. But when was the last set of twins abandoned? I couldn't possibly go on depicting that in fiction with? out being liable to accusations of mischief. And you may also like to know that when African critics indict Western writers for misrepresenting Africa, it's not so much for what used to happen as for the games of transposition that those Western writers seem to delight in. Conrad makes a journey to the Congo in the 1870s but takes the time scheme back some fifty years in his novel Heart of Darkness just to underscore the point that it was a savage landscape. When he was writing the novel, there were already newspaper houses in Lagos. As I told you yesterday, in the 1860s there was a newspaper house, there was railway. The society of Lagos, at least among the upper classes, was very Victorian from the late 1800s. But read Heart of Darkness, it's about savages who don't even have language, they can't talk, theyjust go (grunting noise). When a writer does that it's because he has a program, he has an agenda he is trying to pursue. So an African artist/carver could also lapse into such a mindset. Maybe giving them what they expected to see. It was unclear from the interview what their reaction to it was, only that they didn't see it was appropriate to donate that to the Museum. And then, in fairness to the matter that we are talking about, let's say that when I finished the interview, I came to the conclusion?you know, you don't even need to read between the lines. Certainly the couple who went</page><page sequence="21">116 Research in African Literatures over to Nigeria were quite forthcoming about what they did because, back at home in North America they felt quite secure, being interviewed by a white person. They wouldn't have said one-fifth what they were willing to let on if the interviewer was from another part of the world. And I'm saying this to let you know that a lot of what they had to say were not just pejorations of what the actual observation must have been like, it's also that they confess more or less what their own driving force, their motiva- tion was. One of these, clearly, was their tendency to always entice people, ignorant people. "Now, go and tell them that I need something, I need this particular kind of earthenware," and you can be sure the contact group would walk into the village and say, "Oh, I have a white woman here who is willing to pay good money. If you have any fine pots, she'll pay you." And the pot doesn't mean anything to the owner, if she can get good money in return. And they'11 go scrambling for things, and this woman picks and chooses, and then comes here to gloat about it. I mean, that's what's in the interview. So there is something about the interview that's really?almost devious, and I don't think that that word is too strong. The clever-by-half fellow who seems to sneak in and snoop into every nook and cranny of somebody's homestead when they're not looking: that's my reception of the interview I read. That's why quite a number of the claims they make amount to shopping for curios. "Oh, this is different, oh. ..." I don't really think it's something I'm proud of. But again, it was very common for collectors, especially in areas like Africa to just go in and grab everything that they can see because it's African, because it's foreign. That's the irony. I told you yesterday of the Yoruba professor of history who was here at the Museum last year: that I identified him as a Yoruba because of his attitude when he was entering the galleries. He became deferential immediately. He had his hands behind his back and (strikes a respectful pose). Those who make those things treat them with awe, not just respect. I'm not going to breeze into Visible Storage and go "Oh, what is this?" No, I see something that's beyond the quotidian, the ordinary, the workaday, and I feel respect. The foreign visitor just makes a grab for it because, oh, you have to beat the next person to it. They see the aesthetic, or the foreign aspect of it. But they have no con- nection that draws them to the object beyond that. Uh-huh. It's still the same old pattern that started some 150, 200 years ago. The hunt for exotica, you know? I don't know whether you read this novel, King Solomons Mines, by Rider Haggard. Allan Quartermain, She, all those novels by Sir H. Rider Haggard, or the novels by Karen Blixen, of Joyce Cary, of Joseph Conrad, of Robert Ruark, Something of Value. And it's all about settler culture, white settler culture in Africa; in East Africa mostly, but Conrad and Cary wrote on West Africa. The contact you make with an "Other" with a capital "O" that you can't understand, but on which you foist your own limited interpretation of reality nonetheless.</page><page sequence="22">Titi Adepitan 117 I think that it was the general feeling of the times too. Certainly it wasn't out of place. Oh, it was out of place by then?1972.1 finished reading the interview, and I was telling you this morning that the former deputy director general of the World Health Organization was a former university president; he had an uncle who was the president of the Nigerian Association of Alternative Medical Practitioners for several years. The interview mentions the man, the vice chancellor of the university. I'll show you. . . . (flips through inter? view transcript) So we're not really talking about a forest. There's a point where the interviewees say that the people's lives are taken over by leaves and trees. (Laughs) And I said, "My goodness, this is like going back to certain novels that you used to love to hate, or hate to love to read." I don't know. . . . So it's possible for an artist to portray things out of the kind of naivete or innocence that is not really excusable, because as you observed, it may give an impression that those things are still happening, whereas they may not. Now there are other figures here among the effigies, and I'm wondering if they're children or whether it's just another effigy. I think that's an effigy. Children would be out of place in this context. There is a word for it in Yoruba, it's shigidi. Or ere. Ere is an effigy, a statue, a totem in human shape. The Yoruba would call that plastic Oriental thing, the pink thing (points to object on lab top shelf) ere. Imagine putting that in a shrine, it would be exactly like this. You know it for what it is. It's not like you repose faith in it, but if at a shrine it's installed to represent some personage or idea or office, you see it as that. It's not as common as this; Yoruba religion, Yoruba thought is not founded on literal, anthropomor- phic images. It's not that you can't pray until you see an image of God in human form. I say that with so much earnestness because it's important. We don't conceive of God in terms of "Oh, he looks like me." It may just be the symbol: Obatala, white, as I said yesterday; Shango, palm fronds; Ogun, metal. It's association with nature too. Nature. Oya or Oshun, the river. There are no emblems in any anthropo- morphic form. It's only when you approach strong individuals who have their conception of divinity or the numinous in general, or who may just be quirky that you find such an odd assemblage of figures here, figures there. I think here is an artist who's trying to just pander to a particular taste: "Here is Africa." Even beyond this level, you'11 find musicians and artists whose education wasn't really grounded enough when they started out in the nitty-gritty of cultural politics who'll glorify things like this. The very best of our musicians sometimes may be caught sporting images that are supposed to glorify the so-called "African heritage." There's something very misleading about it.</page><page sequence="23">118 Research in African Literatures Let's move on to. . . . (Af414) This is a house scene. There seems to be a lot of people in there. I see someone lying down inside, a bunch of people out front. Is this a typical household, or is this a house at all? Is it some sort of a public building? It looks to me like a house. "Typical" is of course something I would need to qualify. Typical, yes; typical, no. Typical, no in the sense that this is not a house that you'd find in the towns, in the cities, in several places where the taste is certainly modern, having being influenced by so many cross- currents of ideas from other places. It's not really very contemporary. But yes, you'11 find several houses like this in the villages, in the hamlets. That's another word that I don't hear often here. No? It's still very common. Hamlet? I live in a hamlet. Uh-uh. We have hamlets in Nigeria. Smaller than a village. A cluster of houses. Yeah. This is straight from a hamlet and it depicts a typical setting, which says volumes for the nature of interpersonal relations. If we say it's a hamlet, as you observed, it's smaller than a village so people are bonded, mainly by the fact of need, collaboration, symbiosis, if you like. It costs a lot to build a house, on the one hand; on the other, say there are three brothers, each with his family, so they team up to erect a structure like this to live in?all three of them and their children. So you have a household that doesn't quite answer to the idea of the nuclear family in the West. It may be a con- tradiction in terms to speak, rigorously, of "the man of the house" because there are several?there may be several. Not several in terms of the First Nations Long House where you could have over 100 people living. We're talking about a household that may contain up to ten, fifteen, depending on the size. The architecture of the house is very basic. It's not thatch; it's a mud house. The roofing is zinc, that is, metal sheets, the usual house sheets. The windows are basic, for ventilation. There is a door?definitely there'11 be a door at the back although it's not represented here: there's always a door at the back. There is a central corridor in the middle of the house: it's not here. There are rooms on both sides. With this kind of house, the kitchen is outdoors. Toilets are outdoors, and there is a garden if pos? sible?not if possible. Frequently, it's not just a garden; it's a whole expanse of growth with choice trees?and I say choice because many of them are planted. Kolanut trees, fruit trees like mango, orange, citrus, guava, all sorts of things. In other words, such gardens are cultivated and it's nothing like what you are familiar with. The house may be just some kind of obser- vatory for what actually may be a family business. But it's not wild, I mean, up to eighty percent of the vegetation there has been chosen, planted by the owner of the house for managing, for maybe reasons of subsistence. So this side you may have one, two, three rooms, or four, sometimes five. On the other side, four or five rooms and then there's a central passageway.</page><page sequence="24">Titi Adepitan 119 Maybe it wasn't easy for the artist to get the basic architecture right. What we have here appears to be a verandah and that's all. It's not quite like that. I can't imagine a house with an interior like this. I initially got the impres- sion of a church or a shrine place, but clearly it's not. Every representation here is of a domestic setting. And we have what we call the verandah, what you might call the patio here. That's the frontage of the house. People don't play games in the morning; there are several proverbs that show that it's only the lazybones, the indolent, the ne'er-do-wells, who play games when more serious-minded types are off to work. So I think you have a scene here of early evening, dusk or sunset. So the two fellows here are playing a game of ayo. (Af348) Now, this looks like a typical classroom setting. Yeah, classroom setting. A beginner's class. This is how it used to look like when I was in elementary school, except that we had desks, not just seats, and we didn't sit on benches, we sat in chairs with desks in front of us. As I must have said yesterday, we were paired in twos. We shared a desk that could take two pupils with inkwells and pencil grooves and things like that. And the teacher had a chair and a table in one corner of the classroom. There was a closet?in Nigeria, the word for it is cupboard?where the knickknacks of class were kept: notebooks, chalk boxes, dusters, things like that. Whenever the teacher was teaching class, she would move over, usu- ally the blackboard stands against the wall, just like here. It's not something that stands like an easel, like this (represented in the carving). No, no, no, the blackboard is here against the wall, very wide, very broad, and she teaches one, two three, four?that's exactly what you have here (on the blackboard). One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. And then below that you have alphabets in Yoruba: a (a), b (bee), d (dee), e (eh), ? (as in heaven), f (fee), g (as in geese), gb (as in something falling heavily, gbam), h (as in he), i (i:), j (gee), k (key), 1 (lee), m (mee), n (nee), o (oh), ? (aw), p (kp), r (ree), s (with a small dot beneath it, sh), s (see), t (tee), u (oo as in loo), w (as in we), y (as in '^Gods'). That's in Yoruba? That's Yoruba. There are two "e"s for instance?"eh" and "ae." And A, B, D instead of ABC. We have no C in Yoruba, so it's A, B, D, E ?, F, G; and then after G, you also have another sound gb (makes sound). That's the Yoruba alphabet. It's interesting to note that in all of these, it's just the figures themselves that are carved in thorn wood. He seems to use a lot of this thin plywood for the bases?in this case, the benches as well, and the house. The other thing that's very significant and that I'm happy has suddenly turned up is the notion that women are not part of the processes of literacy and education in Africa. The notion is false, maybe one of the grossest remarks that people like to make. I've never schooled at any stage in my</page><page sequence="25">120 Research in African Literatures career as a student in a class with more boys than girls, believe me. And here, let's count the number of women who are represented?one, two, three, four, five, six?out of eight. Let's say that these figures are male: one, two?(points) this is male, this is male. This is a woman; this hairstyle is called shiiku because it ends in a bunch. One, two, three, four?out of eight. Fifty-fifty, you understand? I've never schooled, I've never taught in a school where women were not in a majority?never. I'm happy because an artist would give a reflection, out of innocence, of a class dominated by males, and he would do that in innocence, maybe because he thought that was the proper thing to reflect: what business has a woman being in a class? room? But even the teacher is a woman, so it's now five against four. Even in the higher grades, would it still be women (teaching)? In North America, at least maybe twenty, thirty years ago, it was common to see women teach elementary school for the very young children, and then as the grades got higher and higher, you would see more and more men teaching. In high school there might be mostly men. In high school on the other hand, we had class teachers who were nomi- nally class teachers, they never sat in front of class. I mean, there was a staff room, a common room, and whoever taught you depended on what subject it was. By then the idea of a male or female teacher had all but disappeared. I mean, it really had nothing to do with gender. It was just a question of the subject. And at university, it never mattered. I had female professors and so on. I'm just glad that even at this level of cultural expression we find some? thing that's so direct, so frank about what the situation is. I'm not trying to gloss over whatever shortcomings there may be in education, but as a Nigerian, not even as a Yoruba person, as a Nigerian, I really don't think that I hold any special privileges above women. We are looking at some of the effigy scenes from yesterday and noticing that there are some inscriptions on the bottom which I was wondering if you could translate for me. I think I told a story some two or three days ago, ofthe divinity who, accord? ing to myth, was assigned the task by God, the supreme deity, of mold- ing humans. And he made a perfectjob of it until, in some access of self celebration, he got drunk on palm wine, and in the drunken frenzy that followed, he molded all kinds of deformed creatures: hunchbacks, albinos, all kinds of people. And then when his eyes cleared he saw his error and vowed never to touch wine again. I also remember comparing him to the Roman god Apollo. He's the Apollonian essence, the placid essence, the pure one, the unsullied one. Wole Soyinka has argued an engaging theory for tragedy and ritual drama based on some of the personages of Yoruba cosmogony. He compares the gods of the Yoruba pantheon to their Greek and Roman counterparts?Ogun = Bacchus/Dionysus/Apollo; Shango has his counterpart in the God of Thunder and so on and so forth. It's a very powerful argument. Obatala's votaries dress in white and they don't drink. I'm not sure what the shrine would look like, I have no idea, but they dress in white, they are predominantly women. Sometimes they take to the</page><page sequence="26">Titi Adepitan 121 streets during their festivals; they shake rattles and gongs with instruments in them, praying for all and sundry. It's probably the most widespread of the famous Yoruba religions. I say famous because these are religious practices and observances known particularly in North America and Latin America. Yes, I believe we discussed this. So, that's all it says, but I'm really not in a position to vouch for the differ- ent effigies, what they stand for, whether they're part of the assemblage of figures and personages. But you said that's more representative of the nineteenth century than the twentieth? In terms of the sheer gratuitousness of it, I mean it's not as if you could just walk into a homestead or be passing along a street and find such a shrine. No, much of it isjust imagination; much of this isjust pandering to particular tastes. I have a favorite phrase for things like this because you find them not just in this kind of representation; it's also there in our litera? ture. I call them "artists of the gratuitous gesture"; the grand gesture that seems to say that. . . . It's the equivalent of name dropping, of showing off: "Culture, culture, culture, put this there, put that there, let them know," without realizing that whoever is going to see may not share their frame of mind. You think you are selling your culture, the other party thinks you are actually giving testimony to the barbarity or whatever that still shrouds your existence. Now, this is another such figure (Af366). This one has the horn coming out of the fellow's head. It says "Sango" on the bottom. Can you comment on that? Yes, Sango. Sango is the Yoruba God of Thunder. I've been trying to remember the equivalent god in the Roman pantheon. The God of Thunder is Thor ... No, that's Scandinavian. Thor, and the Hammer, mjollnir. That's Scandina- vian, although there are links between the Roman and Scandinavian. Would it be Zeus? Not Zeus. Zeus would be an almost blasphemous equivalent of the Yoruba Olodumare, the Supreme God. I say blasphemous because the Supreme God in the Yoruba imagination is not even conceived, ever conceived in anthropomorphic terms. Zeus is male and you can trace his genealogy up to Kronos, up to Uranos, up to his own children, Hera and all of them. But with us, Olodumare isjust that bubble of air. He doesn't have human form. Yeah, in the Christian sense, exactly in the Christian sense. But we would say that Olodumare assigned certain tasks to lesser divinities, one of whom is Obatala. Obatala molds humans, but it takes God to breathe life into them.</page><page sequence="27">122 Research in African Literatures Would they have human forms or representations? You mean those gods? Like Sango.... Many of them started as heroes before they became deified?not many of them, I don't want to exaggerate. Clearly Sango is believed to have been a human figure, a hero who emitted fire from his mouth. He was married to a woman by the name of Oya. O-Y-O? O-Y-A. O-Y-A. Yes, I think I'm familiar with her. Actually, her name is the Yoruba version of the River Niger, Odo Oya. Now, according to legend, Sango was the king of Oyo, and he had two generalissimos who were constantly at each other's throat because each had an especial talent for some skills at war. One, Gbonka, was an archer, I mean, an archer of incredible resource. If he shot an arrow, flames from it would consume whole towns. No! That's Timi. Actually the name Timi still goes on till today as the name of the ruling house in the town of Ede. Timi Agbale olofa ina ("Timi Agbale of the flaming arrows"). The other, Gbonka, the stronger of the two was a man of incredible means and supernatural powers and so on. He became too strong. I mean, that was a fact of most societies in times past?generals who kept on conquering new territories for their liege lord, and who eventually began to have dreams of sovereignty of theirs. Sango couldn't take this, so he set both against each other. The finest Yoruba opera is based on it. I think I have the play here by Duro Ladipo, Oba Ko So (The King Did Not Hang). That's the myth of Sango. Now, he set both against each other the first, the second, the third time. On each occasion, the stronger of the two, Gbonka, the man of charms and amulets, defeated the archer. So on the third occasion, Gbonka realized that the king would rather he died than the other fellow Timi, so he beheaded the other warrior just to make sure that he never had to go through with the stage-managed contest again. He then turned on the king and forced him to abdicate. The king abdicated, traveled up north along the Niger. At a point, the wife either lost faith or weakened and died and became the River Niger. Now the shame and the anguish were too much for the king, so he committed suicide by hanging. But in Yoruba tradition, a king does not die. Up till today, if you are announcing the death or "passing on" of a king, you don't say "the king is dead." You must know about the popular saying "The king is dead, long live the king!" in other places. With us, the king is never ever dead, he's just entered the rafters, entered the roof, passed through the ceiling: Oba w'aja, we say. So the menial who accompanied both king and queen saw his lord dangling from a rope, went back into town, and refused, when they asked him what had happened, to let on that the king had committed suicide. He replied uOba ko so" (The king did not hang). Which is the really intriguing thing about the material of myth and legend, because in the denial itself is con-</page><page sequence="28">Titi Adepitan 123 tained the admission! The king did notfhang. It became the title of the play by one of the finest Nigerian folk dramatists. The play was aided in large part by the famous German facilitator whom I've already mentioned, Ulli Beier. I think more than any other Nigerian folk play, it's traveled around the world, being staged at international festivals, Commonwealth festivals. I must have a copy of it here because I knew I might need it. So, clearly Sango started out, at least in the minds of the people, as a human figure, and the shrine we have here is supposed to be Sango's shrine. Again, I may not be able to vouch for the totems of representation. I mean, I really have no way of telling. As I said yesterday or the day before, Sango worshipers normally dress in red, and there are cowries sewn onto the sleeves and the outer hems of their ceremonial dress. The place of horns really says nothing. Of course, the hunter, the warrior who finally chased him out of the throne carried horns. He (Sango himself) also, at least from the play, carried horns and belched smoke from the mouth when incensed at the political imbroglio around him, an equivalent, you might say, of Timi's flaming arrows. As I said yesterday, horns were used as some kind of aid to invocation and the authority of sanction. You say something, you make a wish, it's almost as in magic. The horn is the equivalent of your magic wand. You make a pass in magic and you flick your (wand). With us, the horn is what you invoke the power of sanction with, by touching it with your tongue or by invoking it straight on. So simply, this is the shrine of Sango. It (the writing) may just be to remind himself or to help the collec- tors (know that) that's what he set out to do. Other than that, I don't see any distinctive suggestions that this?he could have painted this red I think, the clothes for instance. This is another one (Af 351). We have two men?one with a drum?a talk- ing drum, and the other one with a horn, and a woman with a chicken. It too has an inscription on the bottom. Do you have any thoughts? The "Kekere Osa ofOyo" (what was written on bottom) means?not the small, but the lesser deity of Oyo. Again, we can play one or two games of mean? ing: is it of Oyo or in Oyo} If it's Oyo, it would suggest Oyotown probably had certain deities which were ranked. But if it's a deity whose presence cut across several towns and cities, it doesn't really matter whether this is just a sample of a shrine of a particular deity of Oyotown, you will find sev? eral others across Yorubaland. In Yoruba, language is so nuanced. "Kekere" would simply mean, literally "small" as in omo kekere, a small child. Omo is child. Now, kekere may just be an irony, as in secret societies. If you call someone kekere awo, that is 'little member', he may be the custodian of the most sacred of observances, the most hidden secrets. So the term kekere is something that shouldn't be taken literally. Kekere Osa?"the small deity" or "the little deity" or whatever?may carry the implication that this deity has a lot more power than the so-called big ones. It's just in the Yoruba playfulness with language to subvert the suggestion of authority and power by attacking something, "Oh, you small. . . ." No, but they know where the power derives from. If he had a choice, if his purpose was to show that larger or bigger or stronger or more powerful deity was more significant,</page><page sequence="29">124 Research in African Literatures he would have done that, rather than pay tribute to the so-called "smaller one," if you know what I mean. And this last effigy figure we looked at yesterday (Af357)?again, two men and a woman kneeling this time. "Osa oko ofLonge/'Agzin, this is most likely from an obscure town or a small village. And I hope I will be forgiven for saying "obscure," because some towns, no matter how well meaning you may be, may not ever be known to you. It may be a town but I really don't know. I know a proverb though: Ewu nb? Viiko Lungl; Liingffunra f ewu. ("There is danger in Longe's farm (or hamlet or barn) but even Longe himself is a bundle of trouble.") (Laughs). In other words, if something is really much of a bother or concern to you, you try this fellow who owns the environment for size and you'11 find out why. Do you understand? So, it may be that this town is part of the back? ground for that saying, I don't know; but I can't really identify it either in my mind or on the map. Osa oko stands to reason. I just translated that saying as "There is danger in Longe's farm or barn or hamlet." All three choices suggest that it's likely to be a farm settlement or some outback. So the idea of Osa oko, the deity of the farm, not of the jungle?"oko" would translate as "bush" or "jungle" (but not some wild terrain) would make sense. Oko may also mean "a forest reserve," for instance; means "farm," means whichever location takes you away from the city center to some out? back, either to fish, or to hunt, or to plant, or for recreation. For rural folk there is usually a mode of worship, maybe a patron deity who supervises activities there. Again, I would call this a relic, because it would take farm- ers who must have been carrying on the practice from ancient times when belief in direct divine patronage was the very basis of life, of the relation? ship between humans and their cosmos. You know how animism works, polytheism rather? For everything you needed?and it's not an African phenomenon, it's just a feature of tribal society?for every activity you needed a patron god or saint or deity or divinity. Even with the Greeks. For everything that was done, there was a patron figure. Before Christi- anity that was the long and short of Judaism too. Jacob was traveling, got tired, made a pillow of rocks, and passed the night there. At night he had a dream. An angel appeared to him and gave him instructions. When he woke up the following morning, he turned (the rocks) into an altar. Later on, another angel appeared to him and they had a wrestling match and the angel couldn't throw him. The angel touched Jacob's tendon and he became lame, and changed his name from "Jacob" to "Israel." And again, that place became holy ground. And remember Moses, too. When Moses was on the Mount, God said to him, "Take off your shoes because the place on which you are standing is holy ground." So it's just the very nature of polytheism in general for there to be a divinity, a patron saint for almost every activity. It's Christianity that brought everything together under an umbrella.</page><page sequence="30">Titi Adepitan 125 Well, hopefully if something's ever done with this, you'll be able to come back and offer some advice again on this. But, it's been a very interesting week. Is there anything else that you'd like to say? Um. I've already indicated that for the Museum. . . . If the interest of the Museum goes beyond merely showcasing things like this, the thing is to go beyond here to see how, maybe with people like yourself, like Ruth, how we could do things that will articulate a sociological framework for many of these concerns, because they actually dovetail into so many other things. Some of the things I mentioned, like the Yoruba pantheon, also involve things like ritual, like drama, like the modes of worship, like our literature, like our reception of outside influence, like our theory of forms, the institu- tion of Obaship. The gods I described earlier today, Sango, Ogun, Obatala for instance, still continue to be of engaging interest to writers, you know, Nigerian writers, Yoruba writers who think that there is a lot in them that people should take an interest in. And I'm not really talking about any notion of divinity at the level of innocence. We are talking about intellec- tual engagement, engagement of ideas and ideals, principles?"Oh, if this god is supposed to do this, what are the implications?"?and those who have done some work don't ever stint on comments that may actually be negative in the way they highlight the gods. Some of the gods are known to be very despotic and so on and so forth. Nigerian intellectuals have traveled a long way from just being the so-called cultural spokespersons to being radicals, Marxists, and ideologues who'll say, "Oh, burn all the gods! Who wants gods? We don't need heroes" and so on and so forth. And more lately they've been trying to also take a second look and say, "Okay, if Ogun is a principle of this, why can't we do this?" I just told you that the Lagos mas- querade, Oyo, who is always dressed in white, who reveals his identity after performing his chants and dance, ought to be a principle of purity, you know? A way of calling the bluff of the bogey of godhead. I mean, when you unveil yourself it's like, "I'm human after all!" As we say in Yoruba, "There is no boju boju about it." Boju boju is hide-and-seek. There is no hide-and-seek. But we have yet to get to that point, and I hope something will happen.</page></plain_text>
