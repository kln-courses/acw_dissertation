<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RHETORICAL VALUE OF THE STUDY OF HEBREW. BY PROF. SHAILER MATHEWS, M. A. Colby University, Me. In addition to the importance which the study of Hebrew possesses as an aid in the interpretation of the Holy Scriptures, it has also a purely rhetorical value. Especially will it prove of service to the preacher in offsetting those tendencies to involved constructions which come naturally from the peculiar literary atmos- phere in which he has been educated. Besides the three fundamental qualities which all good composition must possess,-clearness, force, and elegance,-the sermon, in common with all spoken discourse, especially needs simplicity, concreteness, and a conversational intensity. The study of Hebrew will aid in acquiring these three qualities. 1. Simplicity. Both the words and the sentence in Hebrew are exceedingly simple. The language is in fact the kindergarten tongue of literature. Except in proper nouns, words joined by the hyphen, and the possible exception of nouns formed by the addition of prefixes and suffixes, the Hebrew has practically no compound words. In this it differs widely from all Indo-Germanic languages. While this lack may give the Hebrew a certain abruptness of expression, and render it incapable of concisely defining the subtler shades of abstract thought, it has at the same time given it an almost childishly naive diction. If a complex thought is to be expressed, requisition is made to a sentence and not to a single polysyllabic word. Such simplicity in vocabulary could not fail to be accompanied by simplicity in the structure of sentences. Like the English the Hebrew has lost the case ter- minations of its nouns, and except that it indicates the object of the verb when that object is definite, it is forced to depend upon the arrangement of words in the sentence for perspicuity. As in English, also, the Hebrew atones for its loss of inflections by the use of prepositions. In its construct state it approaches the English possessive, however, only in the juxtaposition of the two terms involved. Most Hebrew sentences are simple; or if compound, their constituent parts are few and brief. The long, involved sentence of the masters of Greek or Latin or German literature is wholly wanting. It could hardly be otherwise. The He- brew lacks the two great supports of the complex sentence, the suspensive particle, and a highly developed use of the participle. While the style of the Psalms and Proverbs and Job may be elliptical, there are very few cases of a lengthy periodic structure. The verb and its subject are placed near each other, and any construc- tion similar to that of the German, in which the parts of a compound verb may be distributed through a sentence, is unknown. The order of the verbal sentence, verb, subject, object, is seldom varied except for emphasis and in the circumstan- tial clause in which the subject comes first, although, as in all languages, broken constructions are not infrequent. This prominent position of the verb is much more in harmony with English habits of thought than is the Greek order-an order, however, seldom found</page><page sequence="2">THE RHETORICAL VALUE OF THE STUDY OF HEBREW. unmodified-of subject, object, verb. The English, because of its lack of case endings, never yielded gracefully to the severely classical structure, and in fact the philosophy of style at present favors an order not unlike that of the Hebrew. The readiness with which the Hebrew order lends itself to the English may be seen in a word for word translation of almost any passage. Take for instance Josh. 5:13,14. "And it came to pass in the being of Joshua by Jericho that he lifted up his eyes and beheld, and lo, man standing to-over against him and his sword drawn in his hand. And went Joshua unto him and said to him, For us, thou, or for our enemies ? And he said, No, for I prince of the host of Jehovah now have come. And fell Joshua upon his faces to the earth and bowed himself and said to him, What, my lord, saying unto his servant ?" Here by simply adding an article or copula and with the questionable exception of the order of the verb and its subject, we have almost idiomatic English. Compare this with a similar translation from any Greek or Latin classical writer. The similarity of the Hebrew and English order of words is at once marked. It may be thought that pleonasm and the parallelism of Hebrew poetry will tend to a tedious repetition. There is, of course, danger that a too close adherence to a double expression of thought, whether it be in synonymous or in obverse terms, will grow tedious, or, in any case, throw the writer into a rhetorical drift in which sharp, concise statement is difficult. But, as a rule, public speaking will bear a little more of the artistic expansion of the Psalms and Proverbs. Most audiences fail to catch the exact force of a statement on its first presentation. The position of the adjective in Hebrew is similar to its regular position in the Latin. Our English idiom is too firmly fixed to be much influenced by either. We have in the Hebrew, then, many of the elements which go to make an English sentence simple-the simple word, the close connection between the terms in the possessive construction, the absence of suspensive particles and con- fused participial constructions, the close connection of subject and verb, the short, straightforward sentence, and, withal, an order of words which is much like that of the English. 2. Concreteness. The secret of successful oratory lies largely in the presenta- tion of thought in sensible form. Abstract thought and expression are doubtless marks of the highest development of intellect and language, but they are not adapted to oratory. The general tendency of the education of the preacher is toward the abstract. The severe study of logic, metaphysics, mathematics, theology, and exegesis results in an exact but unpopular style. Picturesqueness of expression is regarded as unscientific; illustration, a source of fallacy in argu- ment. Precise definition replaces vivid description; analysis, grouping; and, too often, discussion, persuasion. This is clearly an abnormal state of affairs. Of all men the preacher should be able to materialize thought. He stands between ideas and actions. He must convert the unseen and spiritual into that which is practical and commonplace. How is he to gain this power ? By the study of nature and of such literature as deals with things rather than with abstractions. In this respect considerable rhetorical value lies in the study of the natural sciences. The mind becomes accustomed to dealing with matter, and the thought finds exercise and recreation in passing from the rare atmosphere of words and doctrines. As a result the stu- dent's vocabulary and phraseology grows less bookish. 277</page><page sequence="3">THE OLD TSTAMENT STUDENT. But the same result may be attained by appropriating the spirit of such liter- ature as may itself be full of concrete thought. And if this literature is at the same time full of religious life, and if the concreteness of thought extends to spiritual matters, such study works a double benefit for the preacher. It not only gives but applies the element for which he seeks. The Hebrew, in common with most of the Eastern religious literature, pos- sesses this combination of qualities. The Jew had no metaphysics, and his lan- guage lacks even clearly defined words by which metaphysical thought of any considerable depth may be expressed. It is, of course, possible that certain words which to us express only a concrete idea had by usage acquired a technical mean- ing. This process is present in all languages and is not always readily detected. But the general tendency of the Hebrew is toward personification rather than toward abstraction. It looks not so much at relations as at the facts in relation (cf. the various uses of the connective waw where the English is compelled to express in terms of relation that which the Hebrew expressed as simply co-exist- ing). Accordingly it formulates few general laws for nature, attempts no discus- sion of cause and effect, but sees simply certain individual facts in a more or less defined relation, and the universe itself governed, not by laws, but by a Person. It is this sensuous, often anthropomorphic, method of dealing with truths of the deepest philosophical or religious import which makes the study of the Hebrew especially valuable in a rhetorical way to the preacher. By it he is enabled to study the questions which connect themselves with his work without having his style invaded by abstract and technical words. The language of the Old Testa- ment, though perhaps more elliptical, is as concrete in dealing with pessimism as in Qealing with the Deluge; in treating of the philosophy of life, as in treating of war; in dealing with fore-ordination, as in singing a love song. While a general influence of this nature is felt by the student of the English Old Testament (which to a certain extent represents the spirit of the original) much of the vividness which attaches itself to the Hebrew word is lost. Disre- garding the question as to which is the original root idea, the verbal or the sub- stantive, we can see that both verb and noun alike are very realistic. Adjectives, also, are substantial, with meanings based more upon the separate impressions made upon the senses than upon generalizations; while all classes of words, if a slight examination be made of their real force, will be found to be filled with that illustrative power which is the charm of the master styles of all languages. For a language having so small a vocabulary the Hebrew is extraordinarily rich in synonyms. These are distinguished from each other, not so much by the relation which the meaning of each bears to the thinker or to the world in general, as by the pictures which each presents. The difference is sensuous rather than philosophical. For instance, the familiar words used to express joy are distin- guished by the different ways in which the joy is manifested, as by leaping, or shouting. These synonyms, if rendered correctly in English, set the imagination of the student at work. He cannot satisfy himself by using a generic word for them all. He must seek out the word or group of words which can exactly express the cus- tom, or belief, or action which the original has imbedded within itself. Such a search for vividness will react immediately upon his own thoughts and expressions. Illustrations, so called, are very frequently and skillfully used by the Old Testament writers. The oriental mind delights in parable and allegory and anec- 278</page><page sequence="4">THE RHETORICAL VALUE OF THE STUDY OF H:FRRuW. dote. The Hebrew lived in a world of tropes. Each object or thought suggested its likeness, until all things became types, or symbols, or similes. Sometimes these parallelisms are expressed in single words, sometimes in sentences, sometimes in long stories. They are often overdrawn, but they are always forcible. Those things which to our matter of fact, law loving, western minds seem nothing but data upon which to build some hypothesis or system, to the Hebrew were full of life and beauty. He was less a reasoner than an observer, more a poet than a man of science. His thought therefore became a succession of pic- tures and personifications-a panorama, in which word and sentence and chapter alike are parts. No one can enter even slightly into the spirit of such a literature without finding that his own style, especially if, like the Hebrew, it is used in the service of religion, is becoming richer in those concrete qualities which are among the first elements of popular preaching. 3. Conversational intensity. A style which is simple and concrete may be called conversational. It has the advantage of enabling the speaker to address his audience as so many individuals, and is, therefore, the elemental form of ora- torical composition. There is needed, however, that which shall add an intensity to what otherwise might be simply a clear and interesting address. The speaker must aim not merely at conviction but at persuasion. This third element is more specific than that quality which is commonly called force or strength, in that while it passes at times into what would be out of place in a private chat, it conforms closely to the laws of conversation. Much license of expression is allowed by it, its chief purpose being to avoid all declamation and stiffness, and to make the discourse as direct and personal as possible. If only it is kept clear, simple and concrete, the style may be made as irregular as the occasion may require. Exclamations, questions, pauses, all those sudden turns and shades of thought which give effect to conversation, may be allowed, provided, of course, that "all things be done decently and in order." Conversational ora- tory need never become sensational, but it must always be, in the best sense of the word, intense. The most characteristic representative of the Old Testament orators is the prophet. Moses spoke as a statesman, David as a father or psalmist, Solomon as a king and a wise man, but Elijah, and Jeremiah, and Isaiah, and the other prophets, spoke as sacred orators. Allowing for all the changes in times and conditions, for his lack of inspira- tion and power to foretell the future, the aim, the means and the appeal of the preacher of to-day are the same as those of the prophet. Both appear as teachers of morals and religion, the reformers of the church and society, and in a profound sense the representatives of Jehovah. The preacher is the legitimate successor of the prophet. It would seem probable, therefore, that the same general rhetorical principles, mutatis mutandis, would apply to both. Such is the case. The style of the prophet is simple, concrete, conversational, and full of a nervous energy which sometimes lifts it into the highest regions of eloquence. Whether we fully understand all that the prophets would say does not touch the matter of style. So far as the surface meaning is concerned their expressions are vivid and seldom obscure. Our failure to pierce into the depths which lie below the word and sentence does not affect the impression which their burning words and striking pictures make upon our thought. The spirit of true 279</page><page sequence="5">THE OLD TESTAMENT STUDENT. oratory is there and thrills the most careless student. Its consequent influence is toward reproducing its own nervous, direct, essentially religious style. But this carries us from the study of style into that of literature. And on that all men agree. The Old Testament is a literature of most wonderful beauty and worth. It is a library of masterpieces. The real question left is as to whether the study of the Hebrew scripture will actually impress these three desirable qualities-simplicity, concreteness and the spirit of true oratory-upon the preacher. It would be, of course, unreasonable to claim that any study can do more than develop powers already possessed by the student. But if, as all are ready to admit, the study of language in general is beneficial, if the spirit of the author becomes, as it does, in some measure, the spirit of the reader, if thought and lan- guage react upon each other until the one becomes the likeness of the other, then we may be sure that the study of a literature which possesses a wealth of religious thought expressed in simple, picturesque and intense language will most certainly bring into something like its own beauty and power the style of him who thinks its thoughts in its own sacred words. The Septuagint and the Greek New Testa- ment show what Hebrew thought may work upon the Greek; the English Bible what it may work in English, and the renewed attention which America is giving to the study, within the next few years will work out in our midst a pulpit style which shall be at once scholarly and popular. THE SONG OF MOSES, DEUT. 32. BY PROF. MILTON S. TERRY, D. D., Garrett Biblical Institute, Evanston, Ill. The exquisite poem preserved to us in Deut. 32, and known as Moses' song, is acknowledged to be one of the very finest monuments of the Hebrew language and literature. Whenever and by whomsoever written, it must ever command the admiration of Old Testament students. Without entering into any of the questions concerning its date and authorship, we here attempt a rhythmical ver- sion, which we trust the critical reader will find to be true to the original text, while at the same time it retains much of the spirit of the ancient poet.
