<plain_text><page sequence="1">MATHEMATICS AND CULTURE MATHEMATICS AND CULTURE.* BY J. W. N. SULLIVAN. IN talking about the relations of mathematics and culture or, rather, about the cultural value of mathematics, I think it advisable that I should first say a little about what I suppose the word " culture " to mean. In its general use it contains, I think, two ingredients, as it were. It refers to information and it refers to sensibility. An ignorant man, however refined his natural sensibilities may be, is not regarded as cultured. And a man who has amassed an immense knowledge of facts, but is quite unable to distinguish between what is valuable and what is not valuable in his information, is not re- garded as cultured. Of these two elements, I am inclined to think that sensibility is the more important. What the old writers on aesthetics used to call taste is, I think, more important than know- ledge for the formation of a cultured outlook. But the word " taste " as they used it, is too narrow for our purposes. It refers to our aesthetic sensibilities, and doubtless the cultivation of these is a very important part of culture. We would agree, I suppose, that a man who is completely insensible to the arts cannot possibly be cultured. But an acquaintance with, and an appreciation of the arts, though necessary, is not sufficient. There are many other elements which enter into our ideal of culture. Thus I should say that a man with no historical sense, a man who took the particular conventions and ideas of his own time as being the only ones worthy of respect, fell short of the ideal of culture. Mr. Henry Ford is reported to have said that " History is bunk ". One can only conclude that, in one respect at least, Mr. Ford is uncultured. Similarly with an intense provincialism. The type of Englishman, who seems to have abounded in the nineteenth century, who regarded all foreigners as in all respects inferior, was what we should call uncultured. In fact, a good deal of what passed, and still passes, for patriotism, is probably only provincialism and therefore due to lack of culture. Culture is chiefly, I think, the refinement and education of all our sensibilities, including our intellectual and animal sensibilities, and not only of those that are concerned with the arts. Other things being equal, I should say, for instance, that the man who could tell good wine from poor wine was more cultured than the man who could not. There is no need to labour this point. It would be generally agreed, I think, that an essential part of culture consists in the refinement and education of our sensibilities. And now I come to my main subject. On what grounds can it be asserted that mathematics has a cultural influence ? I gather, from various remarks that I have come across in the writings of various authors, that mathematicians have sometimes been re- garded as almost the least cultured of human beings. Mathe- maticians have sometimes been presented to us as being of so dry a nature and so warped a mind that almost every human interest is alien to them. Even James Clerk Maxwell, when a student at * Presidential Address to the London Branch. 243</page><page sequence="2">THE MATHEMATICAL GAZETTE Cambridge, complained that some of the men there saw the whole universe in terms of quintics and quantics and seemed incapable of realizing that the universe had any other aspects. And we have all heard of the mathematician who, on being persuaded to read Milton's Paradise Lost, said at the end that he didn't see what the man was trying to prove. Now it must be admitted that there are a good many mathematicians who lend colour to this assertion of insensitiveness. It seems to be possible for a man to have great mathematical ability and yet to be, in other respects, practically a barbarian. It would seem, in fact, that mathematics is a curiously isolated activity. It seems to be able to flourish in almost complete isolation from the rest of the elements of a man's nature. But we shall do well to distrust this conclusion. Psychologists are not dis- posed, nowadays, to talk about isolated mental faculties. Indeed, some of them have gone to the other extreme, and deny the existence of any special abilities at all. A genius, according to them, is simply a man with an abnormal amount of general ability. What line his genius takes is dependent on his circumstances. I find it difficult to go as far as this. I find it difficult to believe that, if their circum- stances had been interchanged, Napoleon would have composed the Ninth Symphony and Beethoven would have won the Battle of Austerlitz. But although I am disposed to believe that there is a special mathematical ability I am not disposed to believe that it exists in complete independence of everything else. I think we must admit, however, that it is more isolated than some other special abilities. Nevertheless, can we claim for mathematics any general cultural influence ? Let us ask, in the first place, what sort of information is given us by matheinatics, and as this enquiry will tell us something about the nature of mathematics, I shall devote some time to it. At the beginning, when this mysterious activity was still young, it was supposed to give us the most valuable of all information. It was supposed to reveal to us the ultimate principles on which the universe is constructed. To the Pythagoreans every mathematical theorem had a mystic significance. Number, it was thought, is the very essence of the real. Other aspects of the real which do not, at first sight, seem to have anything to do with number, were found by the Pythagoreans to be, after all, only aspects of number. The analogical method they used to establish this conclusion seems to us, nowadays, remarkably obscure. Thus they found that reason is merely an aspect of the number one. For what is the great characteristic of reason ? According to the Pythagoreans the great characteristic of reason is its unchangeableness, and nothing, they said, is so un- changeable as the number one. This sounds unconvincing to us, for the number one seems no more unchangeable than any other number. But the Pythagoreans must have thought there was a difference, for they go on to say that the number two is indeterminate. " Opinion ", therefore, as contrasted with reason, is an expression of the number two. Two is also, it appears, a feminine number, whereas three is a masculine number. Thus the very essence of 244</page><page sequence="3">MATIHEEMATICS AND CULTURE marriage is expressed by the number five, for it is the sum of the first masculine and the first feminine number. This way of thinking seems very strange to us, but we can agree, I think, that it must have made the study of arithmetic a very exciting pursuit. We must remember that many good minds thought in this way, and that it is a way of thinking that persisted for several centuries. Indeed, I am not sure that it is even now altogether extinct. St. Augustine, for instance, found that God created the world in six days because six is the perfect number. The number six is perfect because it is the sum and also the product of the first three numbers. A number with such remarkable properties is obviously perfect. Michael Stifel, the great German algebraist of the sixteenth century, changed his faith because he found that the numbers corresponding to the letters making up the name of Pope Leo the Tenth added up to 666, the number of the beast in the book of Revelation. This mathematician also, by applying a similar method to certain Biblical writings, found that the world was due to come to an end on 3rd October, 1533. Many peasants of his district, who believed him, abandoned their work, with the result that when the day came and passed, they found themselves ruined. This might surely be taken as an experimental proof that numbers did not possess the signifi- cance they were supposed to have. But the attitude persisted. Thus even Kepler, after demonstrating the mathematical properties of star-polygons and such-like figures, goes on to explain their magical properties in warding off diseases and other misfortunes. Indeed, Kepler's fundamental outlook was not unlike that of the Pythagoreans. He not only thought that Nature obeyed mathe- matical laws, but he thought that the reason for Nature's existence was that it illustrated these laws. This point of view is perhaps not unlike the philosophy of God the Pure Mathematician that Sir James Jeans has recently expounded to us. It would seem possible that Pythagoreanism still flourishes, not only in such beliefs as that 13 is an unlucky number, but in more rarefied forms. In its lower forms it certainly still flourishes. Quite recently, before the draw for the Irish Sweep took place, I encountered a man, in the local inn, who insisted on standing everybody a drink because he had drawn a winning ticket. His reason for thinking this was that the figures on the ticket added up to a number which had brought him good fortune throughout his life. Charles Dickens, you remember, was much impressed by the constancy of the yearly averages for deaths by railway accidents. If, by the end of November, he found the figures much behind, he was greatly depressed at the thought of the slaughter that was bound to take place the next month, and took care not to travel. Doubtless we have all met with several instances of the same kind of thing. Another, and more respectable aspect of Pythagoreanism, is the doctrine that mathematics acquaints us with necessary truths. The point of view is well put by Descartes in a famous passage from his Fifth Meditation: "I imagine a triangle, although perhaps such a figure does not 245</page><page sequence="4">THE MATHEMATICAL GAZETTE exist and never has existed anywhere in the world outside my thought. Nevertheless this figure has a certain nature or form or determinate essence which is immutable and eternal and which I have not invented and which depends in no way on my mind. This is evident from the fact that I am able to demonstrate various pro- perties of this triangle, for example, that its three interior angles are equal to two right angles, that the greatest angle is subtended by the greatest side and so on. Whether I want to or not, I recognise very clearly and evidently that these properties are in the triangle although I have never thought about them before, and even if this is the first time I have imagined a triangle. Nevertheless, no one can say that I have invented or imagined them." A triangle, therefore, according to Descartes, does not depend in any way upon one's mind. It has an eternal and immutable exist- ence quite independent of our knowledge of it. Its properties are discovered by our minds but do not in any way depend on them. This way of regarding geometrical entities lasted for two thousand years. To the Platonists geometrical propositions, expressing eternal truths, are concerned with the world of Platonic Ideas, a world apart, separate from the sensible world. The Platonic Ideas exist in a sort of heaven of their own and things on this earth are im- perfect embodiments of them. To the followers of St. Augustine these Platonic Ideas became the ideas of God; and to the followers of St. Thomas Aquinas they became aspects of the Divine word. Throughout the whole of scholastic philosophy the necessary truth of geometrical propositions played a very important part. If this outlook be justified, then the mathematical faculty gives us access, as it were, to an eternally existing, although not sensible, world. Before the discovery of mathematics this world was unknown to us, but it nevertheless existed, and Pythagoras no more invented mathematics than Columbus invented America. We no longer believe this to be a true description of the nature of mathematics. We no longer believe that mathematics is a body of knowledge about an existing, but super-sensible world. Some of us will be reminded of the claims certain theorists have made for music. Some musicians have been so impressed by the extraordinary feeling of inevitability given by certain musical works that they have declared that there must be a kind of heaven in which musical phrases already exist. The great musician discovers these phrases- he hears them, as it were. Inferior musicians hear them imperfectly; they give a confused and distorted rendering of the pure and celestial reality. The faculty for grasping celestial music is rare. The faculty for grasping celestial triangles, on the other hand, seems to be possessed by all men. These notions, as far as geometry is concerned, rest upon the supposed necessity of Euclid's axioms. The fundamental postu- lates of Euclidean geometry were regarded, up to the early part of the nineteenth century, by practically every mathematician and philosopher, as necessities of thought. It was not only that Euclidean geometry was considered to be the geometry of existing space-it 246</page><page sequence="5">MATHEMATICS AND CULTURE was the necessary geometry of any space. Yet it had quite early been realized that there was a fault in this apparently impeccable edifice. The well-known definition of parallel lines was not, it was felt, sufficiently obvious, and the Greek followers of Euclid made attempts to improve it. The Arabians, also, when they acquired the Greek mathematics, found the parallel axiom unsatisfactory. No one doubted that it was a necessary truth, but they thought there should be some way of deducing it from the other and simpler axioms of Euclid. With the spread of mathematics in Europe came a whole host of attempted demonstrations of the parallel axiom. Some of these were miracles of ingenuity, but it could be shown in every case that they rested on assumptions which were equivalent to accepting the parallel axiom itself. One of the most noteworthy of these investigations was that of the Jesuit priest Saccheri, whose treatise appeared early in the eighteenth century. Saccheri was an extremely able logician, too able to make unjustified assumptions. His method was to develop the consequences of denying Euclid's parallel axiom while retaining all the other axioms. In this way he expected to develop a geometry which should be self-contra- dictory, since he had no doubt that the parallel axiom was a necessary truth. But although Saccheri struggled very hard he did not succeed in contradicting himself. What he actually did was to lay the foundations of the first non-Euclidean geometry. But even so, and although D'Alembert was expressing the opinion of all the mathe- maticians of his time in declaring the parallel axiom to be the " scandal" of geometry, no one seems seriously to have doubted it. It appears that the first mathematician to realize that the parallel axiom could be denied and yet a perfectly self-consistent geometry constructed was Gauss. But Gauss quite realized how staggering, how shocking, a thing he had done, and was afraid to publish his researches. It was reserved for a Russian, Lobachewsky, and a Hungarian, Bolyai, to publish the first non-Euclidean geo- metry. It at once became obvious that Euclid's axioms were not necessities of thought, but something quite different, and that there was no reason to suppose that triangles had any celestial existence whatever. We now believe that a mathematical theorem is necessary only in the sense that it is a logical consequence of its axioms and postu- lates, and that its axioms and postulates are arbitrary. It appears, then, that there is no world, independent of the human mind, about which mathematics gives us any information. We can start from any set of axioms we please, provided they are consistent with themselves and one another, and work out the logical con- sequences of them. By doing so we create a branch of mathematics. The primary definitions and postulates are not given by experience, nor are they necessities of thought. The mathematician is entirely free, within the limits of his imagination, to construct what worlds he pleases. What he is to imagine is a matter for his own caprice; he is not thereby discovering the fundamental principles of the universe nor becoming acquainted with the ideas of God. If he can 247</page><page sequence="6">THE MATHEMATICAL GAZETTE find, in experience, sets of entities which obey the same logical scheme as his mathematical entities, then he has applied his mathe- matics to the external world; he has created a branch of science. Some writers, who accept this account of mathematics as a purely man-made thing, find it an extraordinary fact that the external universe, which is presumably not a man-made thing, should never- theless obey mathematical laws. If mathematics is merely a mental game, like chess, why should the universe obey the rules of this game ? This remarkable correspondence has led to far-reaching speculations. As a specimen of them I will quote from Sir James Jeans' recent book, The Mysterious Universe. He says : " a scientific study of the action of the universe has suggested a conclusion which may be summed up, though very crudely and quite inadequately, because we have no language at our command except that derived from our terrestrial concepts and experiences, in the statement that the universe appears to have been designed by a pure mathematician. " This statement can hardly hope to escape challenge on two grounds. In the first place, it may be objected that we are merely moulding nature to our preconceived ideas. The musician, it will be said, may be so engrossed in music that he would contrive to interpret every piece of mechanism as a musical instrument ; the habit of thinking of all intervals as musical intervals may be so ingrained in him that if he fell downstairs and bumped on stairs numbered 1, 5, 8 and 13 he would see music in his fall. In the same way, a cubist painter can see nothing but cubes in the indescribable richness of nature-and the unreality of his pictures shews how far he is from understanding nature; his cubist spectacles are mere blinkers which prevent his seeing more than a minute fraction of the great world around him. So, it may be suggested, the mathe- matician only sees nature through the mathematical blinkers he has fashioned for himself. "A moment's reflection will shew that this can hardly be the whole story. Our remote ancestors tried to interpret nature in terms of anthropomorphic concepts of their own creation and failed. The efforts of our nearer ancestors to interpret nature on engineering lines proved equally inadequate. Nature has refused to accom- modate herself to either of these man-made moulds. On the other hand, our efforts to interpret nature in terms of the concepts of pure mathematics have, so far, proved brilliantly successful. It would now seem to be beyond dispute that in some way nature is more closely allied to the concepts of pure mathematics than to those of biology or engineering, and even if the mathematical interpretation is only a third man-made mould, it at least fits nature incomparably better than the two previously tried. " Fifty years ago, when there was much discussion on the problem of communicating with Mars, it was desired to notify the supposed Martians that thinking beings existed on the planet Earth, but the difficulty was to find a language understood by both parties. The suggestion was made that the most suitable language was that of pure mathematics; it was proposed to light chains of bonfires in 248</page><page sequence="7">MATHEMATICS AND CULTURE the Sahara, to form a diagram illustrating the famous theorem of Pythagoras, that the squares on the two smaller sides of a right- angled triangle are together equal to the square on the greatest side. To most of the inhabitants of Mars such signals would convey no meaning, but it was argued that mathematicians on Mars, if such existed, wollld surely recognise them as the handiwork of mathe- maticians on earth. In so doing, they would not be open to the reproach that they saw mathematics in everything. And so it is mutatis mutandis with the signals from the outer world of reality, which are tlte shadows on the walls of the cave in which we are imprisoned. We have already considered with disfavour the possi- bility of the universe having been planned by a biologist or an engineer; from the intrinsic evidence of this creation, the Great Architect of the Universe now begins to appear as a pure mathe- matician. "In the secondplace, our statement may be challenged onthe ground that there is no absolutely sharp line of demarcation between pure and applied laathematics. It would of course have proved nothing, if nature had merely been found to act in accordance with the con- cepts of applied mathematics; these concepts were specially and deliberately designed by man to fit the workings of nature. And it may be objected that even our pure mathematics does not in actual fact represent a creation of our own minds so much as an effort, based on forgotten or subconscious memories, to understand the workings of nature. If so, it is not surprising that nature should be found to work according to the laws of pure mathematics. It cannot of course be denied that some of the concepts with which the pure mathematician works are taken direct from his experience of nature. An obvious instance is the concept of quantity, but this is so fundamental that it is hard to imagine any scheme of nature from which it was entirely excluded. Other concepts borrow at least something from experience; for instance multi-dimensional geometry, which clearly originated out of experience of the three dimensions of space. If, however, the more intricate concepts of pure mathematics have been transplanted from the workings of nature, they must have been buried very deep indeed in our sub- conscious minds. This very controversial possibility is one which cannot be entirely dismissed, but in any event it can hardly be disputed that nature and our conscious mathematical minds work according to the same laws. She does not model her behaviour, so to speak, on that forced on us by our whims and passions, or on that of our muscles and joints, but on that of our thinking minds. This remains true whether our minds impress their laws on nature, or she impresses her laws on us, and provides a sufficient justification for thinking of the designer of the universe as a mathematician." What are we to think of this argument ? It seems to me that Sir James Jeans does not give sufficient weight to the two objections he imagines being brought against his theory. Both objections are serious. Some mathematical logicians assert, for example, that a mathematical web, as it were, can be woven about any universe 249</page><page sequence="8">THE MATHEMATICAL GAZETTE containing several objects. If this be true, then the only evidence for a mathematical designer of the universe is to be found in the fact that the universe consists of several objects. This would seem a very inadequate ground on which to arrive at so far-reaching a conclusion. The second objection has also been made. Mathematics and logic, it is stated, are merely devices of adaptation or accom- modation to the world in which we find ourselves. They are ways of thinking that have been evolved in our struggle to survive. Our minds have evolved to fit our circumstances, just as our bodies have. In a different universe, supposing that life and consciousness could have existed, we would have evolved a different logic just as we would have evolved different bodies. I am not very happy with this point of view, but, until it is answered, I do not think we can conclude from the fact that we can understand the world that it had a designer. And I would like to point out that it is not per- fectly certain yet that we can understand the world. To say that the world obeys the laws of logic is to say that neither the world nor any part of it can be the subject of two true propositions of the kind which logic asserts to be inconsistent with each other. Well, even if the world does not violate this law, the reader of modern atomic theory must sometimes feel that it is getting pretty near to doing so. When we are told, for example, that a light quantum is at one and the same time large enough to fill the object glass of a telescope and small enough to enter an atom, we may wonder what has happened to the law of contradiction. The apparent dilemma, we are told, points to a necessary revision of our notions of space and time. This means, I suppose, that a new mathematical web will be woven, and this supports the contention of the mathe- matical logicians that mathematics will always prove adequate to anything. These remarks have been, perhaps, in the nature of a digression from my main subject. But before we can have clear ideas on the cultural value of mathematics we must know what it does for us, what its nature is. Is it a science ? Is it a game ? Is it an art ? So far as we have gone it seems to be more like a game than anything else. And there is a school of Continental mathematicians which asserts that this is what it is. Mathematics proper, they assert, is a sort of game, played with meaningless marks on paper, rather like noughts and crosses. They assert that mathematical analysis, as ordinarily taught, cannot be regarded as a body of truth, but is either false or at best a meaningless game. Not all mathematical logicians agree with this. There are some who still think that mathematics can be reduced to formal logic. I know of nothing more difficult than these attempts to pry into the nature of mathe- matics. And it is distressing to find, when one has reached the point of exhaustion, that the conclusions are still subject to controversy. So I shall leave on one side these fundamental investigations. I will merely remark, incidentally, that if mathematics is a game like noughts and crosses, its cultural value is presumably low. But, raising the subject to a more superficial level, I will ask 250</page><page sequence="9">MATHEMATICS AND CULTURE whether mathematics has not many of the characteristics of an art. In the first place I would point out that its history is not unlike that of an art, and particularly of the art of music. Like music, it seems to have an inherent power of development. We have all heard the remark that you only get out of a mathematical argument what you put into it, and it has always seemed to me that this re- mark is true only in a trivial sense. This remark was popularized by Thomas Henry Huxley, who was no mathematician, and who was engaged in a controversy at the time. I prefer a remark, that I came across a little while ago, by Heinrich Hertz. He says: " One cannot escape the feeling that these mathematical formulae have an independent existence and an intelligence of their own, that they are wiser than we are, wiser even than their discoverers, that we get more out of them than was originally put into them." The history of mathematics seems to bear out this assertion. Doubtless many of the primary mathematical concepts were sug- gested by experience, but many mathematical concepts have not been suggested by experience at all, but arose, quite without pre- vision, from the mathematical symbolism employed. Thus negative numbers were not suggested by experience. They arose auto- matically from the formula for subtraction, and they were so far from being foreseen that for a long time they were not understood. Even in the time of Newton, John Wallis, a very able mathematician, believed that negative numbers were greater than infinity. And for a long time the negative roots of equations were unintelligible to mathematicians. They simply neglected them. The mathematical machine had ground out these results, as it were, but they were so far from having been put into it that their emergence caused some- thing like consternation. This is true, also, of imaginary numbers. When they first appeared no meaning could be attached to them. They were dismissed as meaningless products of the mathematical machine. There are innumerable instances of what we might call this self-generative power of mathematics. Thus mathematicians were led on to invent algebraic equations of higher and higher orders purely from considerations of abstract form. Each equation sug- gested the next. It was not that Nature was suggesting to them more and more complicated problems. The greater part of mathe- matics, in fact, has developed in accordance with an inner life of its own, although there are occasions, of course, where branches of analysis have arisen to meet the demands made by certain physical problems. On the whole, however, mathematics has been remark- ably autonomous. In this respect it resembles the art of music more closely than any other art. Music is the least dependent on ex- perience, on suggestions from the external world, of all the arts. Music owes practically nothing, for example, to the sounds that occur in nature. And the musician, except in the sort of music called programme music, is not concerned to describe or illustrate anything in external nature. Music, at least as much as mathe- matics, lives in a world of its own. Its development, also, has not been dissimilar. It has been a step by step development, not 251</page><page sequence="10">THE MATHEMATICAL GAZETTE because, like a science, it has been accommodating itself more and more closely to an external world, but because primitive musical forms suggest more complicated forms. We see this in the develop- ment of the scale, in the development of counterpoint, and in the development of harmony, as well as in the development of such a great musical form as the sonata form. In both mathematics and music their independence of experience and their purely formal development are distinguishing characteristics. If mathematics is an art, it is more like music than it is like any other art, and it may be suspected that it appeals to not dissimilar sensibilities. In this connection it is interesting to notice that many mathematicians have been musical. A statistical study would show, I think, that music is the favourite art of mathematicians. So far as I can judge, from a necessarily very imperfect knowledge, mathematicians are not often interested in painting, the art which is most dependent on the external world. Also, their literary taste, judging from the poetry they quote, is sometimes deplorable. But if they like music, they usually like good music. I have met only one mathematician, an artist in his mathematics, who was really indifferent to music. But he had a brother who was a very good musician. Another point of resemblance between mathematics and music is the fact that they are the only two activities where we have the creative infant prodigy. The young Mozart and the young Pascal have not their like elsewhere. And this is what we should expect if Music and Mathematics are so largely independent of experience. The young mathematician and the young musician can proceed to create before they have learned anything about the world because, as a matter of fact, there is nothing for them to learn. One of the chief functions of an art is to give aesthetic pleasure, and before we decide that the cultural value of mathematics is that of an art, we must ask whether mathematics gives aesthetic pleasure. I do not think there is much difficulty about maintaining this. We all know, as a matter of fact, that mathematics has a very strong aesthetic aspect. Every mathematician feels the difference between an " elegant " proof and a proof which, as Lord Rayleigh said, " merely commands assent ". Everyone realizes the difference be- tween the mathematician who is an artist and the mathematician who is merely a workman. Many mathematicians have written about mathematics in a kind of prose poetry. Sylvester, who apparently saw all the colours of a sunset in a page of algebra, is a celebrated example, but I cannot forbear to quote a perhaps lesser known example from Boltzmann, quoted by Max Planck in the recent Maxwell Commemoration Volume. Boltzmann is describ- ing a paper by Maxwell on the Kinetic Theory of Gases. He says: "At first are developed majestically the Variations of the Veloci- ties, then from one side enter the Equations of State, from the other the Equations of Motion in a Central Field; ever higher sweeps the chaos of Formulae; suddenly are heard the four words: " put n=5 ". The evil spirit V (the relative velocity of two molecules) vanishes and the dominating figure in the bass is suddenly silent; 252</page><page sequence="11">MATHEMATICS AND CULTURE that which had seemed insuperable being overcome as if by a magic stroke. There is no time to say why this or that substitution was made; who cannot sense this should lay the book aside, for Maxwell is no writer of programme music, who is obliged to set the explana- tion over the score. Result after result is given by the pliant for- mulae till, as unexpected climax, comes the Heat Equilibrium of a heavy gas ; the curtain then drops." We must admit, I think, that, whatever we may think of Boltz- mann's analogy, he is certainly expressing a strong aesthetic re- action. And it was Henri Poincare, I think, who is reported to have said that in all his researches he had never been interested to find the value of x, but solely in the beauty of the methods by which he found that value. There is no need to multiply examples. Every mathematician knows that one of the chief charms, perhaps the chief charm, of mathematics, resides in its aesthetic aspect. I conclude, therefore, that the cultural value of mathematics is that of an art, and that the art it most closely resembles is the art of music. The cultural value of music is to be found, I think, in the states of consciousness it awakes in us. A great piece of music makes us aware of feelings, of sensibilities, that perhaps we had never experienced before. A thousand shades of joy and sorrow, a refinement of ecstasy, a purity of desire, such as we have never yet known, can be evoked in us by music. Our inner life is enriched, and that is the only life worth enriching. And I claim for mathe- matics that it does a similar thing for the more intellectual part of our mind. It subtilizes and refines our intellectual capacities as music subtilizes and refines our emotions. The student of mathe- matics passes continually from one level of abstraction to another. Such notions as the general concept of number, of a function, of continuity, really are additions to the resources of the mind. The student finds that ideas which were at first too elusive to be grasped, gradually become permanent additions to his mental furniture. The man who lacks these resources, to whom these ideas are meaningless, does not realize the possibilities of the mind. He lives in a poorer world. He lacks certain sensibilities. To that extent he is un- cultured. And if modern science persists with its present tendency of reducing the universe to mathematical relations between entities which are unimaginable, and can only be mathematically defined, of making the universe, in fact, a completely mathematical affair, then the non-mathematician will be completely at a loss. A funda- mental department of knowledge will become completely inaccessible to him. He will be, in one very important respect, uncultured. Mathematics will then acquire a new cultural status. It will be valued for the part it plays in refining and educating certain mental sensibilities, and also for the part it plays in providing the key to information which is indispensable to a truly cultured outlook. But even if it turns out that the universe is not essentially mathematical, that God is not, after all, a pure mathematician, it can still be main- tained, I think, that mathematics is an essential part of culture.
