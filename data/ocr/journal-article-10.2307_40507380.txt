Among ethnological works on the Eskimo, this book ranks with the most significant on at least three counts. First, it deals with an inland group of Eskimo, the Nunamiut of the Brooks Range in Northern Alaska, who depend on caribou hunting in a harsh moun- tain environment for their survival. Most other 359</page><page sequence="2">360 REVIEWS ethnographic studies of the Eskimo are con- cerned with groups living in a coastal rather than inland environment. For this reason alone, Gubser's book extends considerably the available knowledge on the problems of inland living of indigenous northern peoples. Second, as a scholarly work in its own right, the book is of unusual quality. The author begins with a history of native Alaskan contact with Whites, based on documentary study. This is followed by ethnohistory of the Nuna- miut based largely on field data. The next por- tion of the book is a remarkably insightful report of Nunamiut social organization, where household and community structure and ac- tivities are carefully depicted. A chapter on "The Individual" introduces a Lintonian per- spective on status and socialization that rounds out the picture of social organization. Perhaps the most intrepid effort is an attempt to relate concepts and mental processes to social struc- ture and natural environment, particularly the latter. While the entire book is descriptive, there are occasional expressions which are related to major concerns of social science theory, such as the Nunamiut notion of a "fractionally organic" universe and the rele- vance for societal survival of the Nunamiut cognitive processes of empiricism, supernatu- ralism, and anthropomorphism. The book as a whole is an important empirical contribution to any person interested in relating social or- ganization, psychological processes and ecology or ecosystems. The third reason for ranking this book as significant is its readability. As Murdock notes in the "Foreword," the writer produced the book while an undergraduate student at Yale University, following field work in Alaska. Probably for this reason the book has a rare directness, lucidity, and intimacy. Anecdotes, personal experiences in obtaining data, and the Eskimo words used in the text, as well as the careful attempt to explain Nunamiut thinking and describe their background, add up to a high level of communication with trie reader. This process is aided by the thoughtful addition of appendices containing a map of northern Alaska, a description of the summer camp community studied, a calendar of sea- sonal activities, a glossary, and a bibliography. While Gubser's book deserves a wide audi- ence extending from senior high school stu- dents to the highest levels of government service or academia, attention should be called to what the book does not say too much about, the processes of acculturation and the continu- ing impact of Western culture on the Nuna- miut. The author has emphasized indigenous Nunamiut society as it was and is, though his work repeatedly shows the impact of contacts with the outside "White" world. Other studies will be needed to show the processes through which Nunamiut society changes and is being related not only to the Brooks Range environment but also larger environments of mankind. B. Y.
