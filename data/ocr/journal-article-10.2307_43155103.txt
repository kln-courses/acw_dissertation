<plain_text><page sequence="1">Hume, Whitehead, and Philosophic Method* KENNETH R. MERRILL University of Oklahoma I. In this essay, I will (1) examine several Humean doctrines from a roughly Whiteheadian viewpoint1 and (2) examine the Humean analyses of reason and experience that underlie the specific doctrines discussed earlier. In the course of my examination there emerge two very different conceptions of the task of philosophy and of the methods by which the task is to be accomplished (although there are interesting similarities, too). The Whiteheadian notion of philosophy is brought out more by remotion, as it were, than by direct statement, for I try to avoid technical discussions of Whitehead's philosophy- a philosophy that bristles with jargon and, more treacherously, with peculiar uses of ordinary words. In fact, I generally avoid discussing Whitehead's own alternative to Hume's philosophy altogether, bringing in only enough positive Whiteheadian doctrine to make the attack on Hume in- telligible. The essay is focused primarily on Hume, with the critical tools supplied in large part by the writings of Alfred North Whitehead. Whitehead's attitude toward Hume is a curious mixture of almost extravagant praise and strong disapproval. Whitehead admires Hume for being interested in the right problems and, above all, for his merci- * I should like to thank John I. Biro and Robert W.

Hume's philosophy brilliantly exposes the blind alley into which most of the pathways of modern philosophy lead. On the debit side, Whitehead castigates Hume for accepting a set of assumptions that issue in a philosophical reductio ad absurdum , which is mitigated only by unphilosophical appeals to "practice," "custom," "habit," and the like. (An appeal to "practice" need not be unphilosophical, but Hume's is, for reasons that will become clear. ) As it turns out, then, even Whitehead's praise of Hume usually has a barb in it. It is as if Whitehead were saying, "Hume does what he does very well, but no philosopher ought to do what Hume does." Before we get into the details of Whitehead's treatment of Hume, it will be instructive to locate more precisely one or two of the main roots of Whitehead's ambivalent estimate of Hume. Those roots center in Whitehead's conception of the task of philosophy: ". . . the true method of philosophical construction is to frame a scheme of ideas, the best that one can, and unflinchingly to explore the interpretation of experience in terms of that scheme." (PR, p. x) Hume gets (qualified) high marks from Whitehead for unflinchingly pursuing the implica- tions of his scheme of ideas. He gets low marks for the scheme itself and for his unwillingness to modify or abandon the scheme when it proved to be inadequate. Specifically, Hume does not see that a philosophical scheme is unacceptable if it fails to cover the details of "practice." We cannot appeal to practice to supplement our philosophical scheme so long as we remain satisfied with the scheme. The appeal to practice must be for the purpose of making our scheme more nearly adequate, not for the purpose of keeping an implausible scheme inviolate. It is a muddle, especially for an empiricist, to suppose that a defensible philosophical scheme can fail in important respects to conform to experience. Let us look first at some specific issues in Hume's philosophy that interested Whitehead. We can then discuss more profitably some of the assumptions about the nature of reason, experience, and philosophy that underlie Hume's specific doctrines. II. A. Simplicity , Complexity , and the Method of Challenge The first principle that Hume lays down in the science of human nature- the first to be considered but also of the first importance- is this: . . that all our simple ideas proceed either mediately or im- mediately from their correspondent impressions." ( Treatise , p. 7) 136</page><page sequence="3">With appropriate qualifications the general principle that impressions are prior to ideas may be extended to complex perceptions. It is on this general principle that Hume bases his method of challenge, which is the heart of the polemical side of his philosophy. The method of chal- lenge is stated succinctly at the end of Section II of the Inquiry : "When we entertain . . . any suspicion that a philosophical term is employed without any meaning or idea (as is but too frequent), we need but inquire, from what impression is that supposed idea derived ? And if it be impossible to assign any, this will serve to confirm our suspicion." Given the confident, almost bristling tone of the preceding sentences from the Inquiry , we may well be surprised to recall that the principle that ideas follow from and copy impressions (which I shall on occasion hereinafter abbreviate as the "impressions-&gt;ideas principle") was es- tablished in the first place by a kind of empirical survey. Forgetting its matter-of-fact status, Hume transforms the principle into a near-relative (at least) of a necessary truth. Antony Flew (in Hume's Philosophy of Belief) has instructively documented Hume's tergiversations on this question, so I shall not discuss it further. The point is that Hume is unsure just what authority his "first principle" has. In his more bump- tious moments, typified by the second passage quoted in the preceding paragraph and by the famous "commit it then to the flames" passage at the end of the Inquiry , Hume verges on what Whitehead calls "the dogmatic fallacy," which is the belief that the principles of one's philosophy are "clear, obvious, and irreformable." (AI, p. 287) Hume's troubles with the impressions- »ideas dictum actually begin before he has even christened it the first principle in his science of human nature. Those early troubles are epitomized by the famous miss- ing shade of blue- the case of a person who, by Hume's own account, could imaginatively supply the simple idea of a shade of blue he had never seen. This exception to the general maxim is not, as Hume would have it, "so particular and singular, that 'tis scarce worth our observing." ( Treatise , p. 6) If if holds at all, the exception holds for the entire class of sensations. Now I think that Hume could have salvaged the general empiricist thesis that perception is prior to thought, had he been willing to recast it in a less rigid and doctrinaire form, especially in respect of imaginative freedom. But in Hume's formulation, this foundation stone has very quickly proved to be porous and crumbly. As might be expected, Hume's problems multiply when he tries to apply the impressions-ndeas principle to complex perceptions. For obvious reasons, he cannot straightforwardly extend the principle to complex impressions and complex ideas; but he does restrict the imagination to "compounding, transposing, augmenting, or diminish- *37</page><page sequence="4">ing" the materials afforded by sense (which are, finally, simple impres- sions of sensation). The impressions-»ideas principle is at this point still intact, or at least it is in no worse shape than it is with respect to simple perceptions. But in explaining how complex impressions and complex ideas get formed, Hume runs together at least three distinct notions, apparently without noticing what he has done. The following passage from Whitehead's Process and Reality summarizes those con- flations: He [Hume] fails to distinguish sufficiently between (i) the ť man- ner9 (or 'order7) in which many simples constitute some one complex perception, i.e. impression or idea; and (ii) the efficacious fact by reason of which this complex perception arises; and (iii) the mere multiplicity of simples which constitute the complex perception in this definite manner, (p. 199) Hume's account of space and time illustrates the first of these notions, i.e., "manner." But my senses convey to me only the impressions of colour'd points, disposed in a certain manner. ... we may conclude with certainty, that the idea of extension is nothing but a copy of these colour'd points, and of the manner of their appearance. ( Treatise , p. 34; em- phasis added) The idea of time is not derived from a particular impression mix'd up with others, and plainly distinguishable from them; but arises al- together from the manner , in which impressions appear to the mind, without making one of the number. ( T reatise , p. 36; emphasis added) The second of the notions- that of the efficacious fact by reason of which complex ideas arise- makes its appearance in Hume's theory of the association of ideas. Were ideas entirely loose and unconnected, chance alone wou'd join them; and 'tis impossible the same simple ideas should fall regu- larly into complex ones (as they commonly do) without some bond of union among them, some associating quality, by which one idea naturally introduces another. This uniting principle among ideas is not to be consider'd as an inseparable connexion. ... We are only to regard it as a gentle forcey which commonly prevails, and is the cause why, among other things, languages so nearly correspond to each other; nature in a manner pointing out to every one those simple ideas, which are most proper to be united into a complex one. (Treatise, pp. 10-11; emphasis added) 138</page><page sequence="5">In explaining the ideas of substance and mode, Hume makes use of the third of the conflated notions- that of a mere multiplicity of simples constituting the complex perception in a definite manner. The idea of a substance as well as that of a mode, is nothing but a collection of simple ideas, that are united by the imagination, and have a particular name assigned them But the difference betwixt these ideas consists in this, that the particular qualities, which form a substance, are commonly refer'd to an unknown something [Hume's emphasis], in which they are supposed to inhere; or granting this fiction should not take place, are at least supposed to be closely and inseparably connected by the relations of contiguity and causation. The effect of this is, that whatever new simple quality we discover to have the same connexion with the rest, we immediately comprehend it among them, even tho' it did not enter into the first conception of the substance The principle of union being regarded as the chief part of the complex idea, gives entrance to whatever quality after- wards occurs, and is equally comprehended by it, as are the others, which first presented themselves. ( Treatise , p. 16; second and third emphases added) Each of these three passages requires a brief comment. The manner of appearance of simples, which is crucial for Hume's theory of space and time, must itself be a simple impression or idea, for otherwise we must have a second manner of composition for the original manner, a third manner for the second, and so on ad infinitum . But it is clear that Hume does not regard manner as a simple impression or idea. It is equally clear that he could not (consistently) take manner as simple even if he wanted. In the first place, the manner of composition is not given with, or as, any of the simple components of the perception. In the second place, the manner of composition of any complex per- ception is inconceivable apart from at least two components of the per- ception-a circumstance that brands manner as inescapably complex. It follows from the preceding discussion that the manner of compo- sition both must be, and cannot possibly be, simple. Since the alterna- tive of a vicious infinite regress is equally impossible, it would appear that Hume's account of space and time (at least) is irreparably flawed. (I shall suggest below that the root of Hume's problems on this score is a mistaken conception of simplicity. ) The "gentle force" passage is pertinent to the discreteness of percep- tions, which is a doctrine that Hume seems to use, modify, or ignore as it suits his purpose. I shall later have something to say on the question of whether perceptions can, even on Hume's own showing, be quite so *39</page><page sequence="6">discrete as he says, so I shall remark here only that the admission of a gentle force among ideas represents a weakening (at least) of the claim that perceptions are different, distinguishable, and separable. In the third passage quoted- the one about substance and mode- Hume identifies "the principle of union" as the chief part of the com- plex idea of substance. This principle is ambiguous as between "man- ner" and "efficacious reason," but in either case it is inconsistent with the assertion that the idea of a substance is nothing but a collection of simple ideas united by the imagination. I will add, as a general comment on the simple-complex distinction, that the search for absolute simplicity seems to me to be a misguided enterprise, one that pursues a will-o'-the-wisp. (If the history of philoso- phy is any indication, this particular ignis fatuus is uncommonly entic- ing.) What is simple and what is complex depend on one's purpose and the mode of analysis one adopts. "Simple" always means "simple enough." Whitehead's advice on simplicity is, I think, the best ever offered: "Seek simplicity and distrust it." Hume's difficulties in the theory of perception stem in no small part from his unquestioning trust in the myth of simplicity. Whatever salutary uses the simple- complex dichotomy may be put to, in Hume's hands the distinction acquires the status of virtually unexamined dogma- a dogma that is as much Hume's master as it is his servant. The upshot of the first part of my paper is that Hume's account of the relations between impressions and ideas and between simple and complex perceptions, which he takes to be foundational for his whole science of human nature, is too unclear and too full of inconsistencies and exceptions to be taken as an ultimate philosophical principle. If this claim is true, the method of challenge, as Hume develops it, is base- less and Hume is deprived of one of his chief critical weapons. B. Force and Vivacity and the Discreteness of Perceptions Whitehead criticizes Hume's use of repetition to explain cause and effect: Given Hume's outlook, it is a case of explaining the unknown by the unknown- or, rather, by an import that is illegitimate on Hume's own terms. The cause-effect relation, according to Hume, lies "beyond the immediate impressions of our memory and senses." But so does repetition. Hume has confused a "repetition of impressions" with an "impression of repetitions of impressions." The same considerations hold of "habit": "Cause, repetition, habit are all in the same boat." (PR, p. 213) Hume would say, of course, that he admits memory. But when we examine Hume's doctrine of memory, we find that he has 140</page><page sequence="7">effectively divested it of its repetition character, replacing that charac- ter with a degree of force and vivacity. This account leaves out the vital character of memory- namely, that it is memory . The whole notion of repetition- and, with it, memory- is lost in the force-and-vivacity doctrine.2 I shall return later, and in a different context, to the problem of cause, but I shall now argue that the force-and-vivacity criterion itself is un- intelligible apart from repetition and that as a consequence Hume's doctrine of the discreteness of perceptions must be severely qualified. On the face of it, my line of reasoning runs counter to Whitehead's: He argues that Hume's force-and-vivacity doctrine excludes repetition and thus eviscerates memory. I shall contend, on the contrary, that the force-and-vivacity doctrine presupposes repetition and memory.3 To get clearly in mind the position I intend to attack, let us have a look at one of Hume's arguments. Hume is considering a common defi- nition of substance : "something which may exist by itself." So, far from being helpful, Hume complains, this definition is perfectly vacuous; it applies to absolutely everything that can be conceived, whether sub- stance, mode, accident, matter, or spirit. To prove this conclusion, which he obviously regards as devastating to the substantialists, Hume reasons like this: Whatever is clearly conceiv'd may exist; and whatever is clearly con- ceiv'd, after any manner, may exist after the same manner. This is one principle Again, every thing, which is different, is distinguish- able, and every thing which is distinguishable, is separable by the imagination. This is another principle. My conclusion from both is, that since all our perceptions are different from each other, and from every thing else in the universe, they are also distinct and separable, 2. Ralph W. Church finds Whitehead's criticism of Hume unconvincing, and part of it "astonishing" - the part, namely, in which Whitehead accuses Hume of failing to see that a repetition of impressions is not the same thing as an impression of a repetition of impressions. There is a modicum of justice in Church's complaint, but it is of a narrowly exegetical sort. So far as I can see, Church ignores, or fails to understand, Whitehead's arguments for the conclusion that, whatever Hume may sayy cause, repetition, and habit are all in the same boat. See Ralph W. Church, Hume's Theory of the Understanding (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1935), PP. 85-85. 3. Whitehead does in fact note Hume's qualification of the doctrine of the independence of perceptions. "There is a relation of 'derivation' of 'ideas' from 'impressions' which he [Hume] is always citing and never discussing. So far as it is to be taken seriously - for he never refers to it as a correlate 'impression' - it constitutes an exception to the individual independence of successive 'perceptions'." (PR, p. 208) M1</page><page sequence="8">and may be consideri as separately existent, and may exist separately, and have no need of any thing else to suppport their existence. They are, therefore, substances, as far as this definition explains a substance. ( Treatise , p. 233) It may be noted that Hume also accepts the dictum that what cannot be conceived cannot exist, which is logically independent of any of the propositions in the passage just quoted. This quotation provides as clear a statement as one could want of Hume's view of the absolute independence of all our perceptions. The argument it contains strikes me as slick, clever- and specious. It evi- dences a remarkable mixture of skepticism and metaphysical credulity. But let me be specific. I shall consider two related elements in Hume's "demonstration": (1) Hume's understanding of the difieren t/dis- tinguishable/separable principle ("separable" meaning "separable by imagination") and (2) the distinctness of our perceptions in the light of the force-and-vivacity criterion. (A third element, which I touch on later by implication, is Hume's assimilation of real, conditioned possi- bility to abstract, logical possibility.) Hume actually accepts a stronger principle than the one that appears in the argument quoted above- the different/distinguishable/separable principle. He also accepts the converse of the principle (or what he calls the inverse), viz., that what is separable is distinguishable, and what is distinguishable is different. Thus, we have "different if and only if distinguishable, and distinguishable if and only if separable." (See Treatise, p. 18.) In any case, it is a principle that Hume repeatedly in- vokes and, as it seems to me, misuses, its misuse being reflected in, among other things, the unsatisfactory, confused account he offers of abstract ideas and distinctions of reason. ( Treatise , pp. 17-25) Taking the first version of the principle, let us look at the two implica- tions involved: "Different" implies "distinguishable," and "distinguish- able" implies "separable." (Given the transitivity of "implies," there is, of course, a third implication- "different" implies "separable"; but if either of the first two implications fails, the third, insofar as it is deduced from the first two, fails as well.) "What is different is dis- tinguishable" is analytically true: To say that x and y are different is to distinguish x from y in respect of some property. If x and y are in every respect indistinguishable, then there is no possible ground for saying that they are different. The next move- "What is distinguishable is separable by the imagination"- is somewhat more tricky, but it, too, may be given an innocuous reading: To distinguish x from y is, in some sense, to separate x from y. But in what sense? That depends on what 142</page><page sequence="9">x and y are. For some x's and y's, I can separate them in the strong sense that neither requires the other, either in thought or in fact. Thus, if I see Jones (x) sitting on a park bench (y ) , I can separate x from y in that I can think of either without thinking of the other, and in that neither requires the other in order to exist. On the other hand, if x is a triangle and y is a line, I can separate x from y to the extent that a triangle is not a line, and a line is not a triangle; but I cannot conceive a triangle apart from a line. It follows that triangles, although distinguishable from lines, cannot be separated from lines, except in the weak sense ex- plained. (I can, of course, conceive a line apart from a triangle, and that shows that separability is not a symmetrical relation. The example of Jones and the park bench shows that the relation is not asymmetrical. It is, therefore, nonsymmetrical: If x is separable from y, y may or may not be separable from x. ) I conclude that Hume's understanding of the different /dis tinguish- able/separable principle is faulty and that his unguarded formulation of the principle ought to be rejected. I conclude also that since this principle is a crucial premise in Hume's argument establishing the in- dependence of perceptions, the argument ought to be regarded as un- sound. But even if Hume's conclusion- that all our perceptions are different and therefore separate and capable of independent existence -were validly deduced from true premises, it would still be inconsistent with his use of the force-and-vivacity criterion for distinguishing impres- sions from ideas. Hume divides all perceptions into impressions and ideas. How? By the superior force and vivacity of impressions. Thus the Treatise (p. i ) : "Those perceptions, which enter with most force and violence, we may name impressions. . . So also the Inquiry (p. 27): "By the term 'impression' ... I mean all our more lively perceptions " More force- ful and lively than what ? Than ideas, of course. Ideas are "less forcible and lively"; they are "the faint images of [impressions] in thinking and reasoning." What has happened to the absolute distinctness and separateness of our perceptions? Hume cannot even describe them without referring to other perceptions.4 4. Hume's doctrine of "custom" assumes that the "force and liveliness of one occasion of experience enter into the character of succeeding occasions." (AI, p. 236) His "gentle force" is a tacit acknowledgement of that assumption, but there is no place for it in his metaphysical doctrine. Hume wants to have it both ways, that is, he wants to have his ideas both entirely discrete and (at least) loosely connected. One might locate the gentle force in the mind rather than in ideas qua objects of consciousness, but that interpretation strikes me as an unnatural reading of the passage on pages 10 and 11 of the Treatise. It must be conceded, however, that *43</page><page sequence="10">For the sake of argument, we could concede provisionally that on Hume's account an impression of sensation might exist apart from any- thing else, but it could never be recognized as an impression of sensa- tion in such isolation. The force-and-vivacity criterion is a means of discriminating perceptions from one another and becomes unintelli- gible when applied to an absolutely solitary impression. As for ideas, it is a straightforward contradiction to assert both that a perception is a faint image of something else and that it requires nothing else in order to exist. An image that is an image of nothing is inconceivable, just as a shadow must be the shadow of something. We may, of course, be un- sure in some particular case whether a perception is an impression or an idea, as Hume allows ( Treatise , p. 2), but this consideration is of no help whatever to Hume. To wonder whether a perception is an impres- sion or an idea is to be unsure whether it satisfies or fails to satisfy the criterial difference between impressions and ideas. But to be unsure in this way requires that the problematic perception be compared with other perceptions. So, whether we know or do not know that a percep- tion is an impression or an idea, we must view it in relation to other perceptions. To the extent that we apply- or even attempt to apply- the force-and-vivacity criterion to our perceptions, to that extent we will find it impossible to conceive them in isolation from other percep- tions; and to that extent, on Hume's own principles, they cannot exist apart from other perceptions.5 III. Whitehead characterizes the "metaphysical rule of evidence" as follows: . . we must bow to those presumptions, which, in despite of criticism, we still employ for the regulation of our lives. Such presump- there are a good many other passages that admit of a crypto-Kantian construction. For an interesting development of the thesis that Hume is, if you will, a Kantian manqué, see Robert Paul Wolff, "Hume's Theory of Mental Activity," The Philosophical Review , Vol. LXIX, No. 3 (July, i960) ; reprinted in V. C. Chappell, ed., Hume: A Collection of Critical Essays (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, 1966) . 5. It is worth pointing out in this connection that there is generally no such sharp distinction as Hume suggests between something considered in itself and that thing considered in relation to other things. To have an idea (in the ordinary, non-Humean sense) of something often just is to have an idea of its relations. Our conception of an acid, for example, includes the effects acids have on other sub- stances. It is a muddle to suppose that we could identify a liquid as an acid and only later discover its corrosive effects. It is beside the point that we must learn by experience what those effects are; the point is that we have no proper idea of acid until we do know at least some of the effects of acid. 144</page><page sequence="11">tions are imperative in experience." (PR, p. 229) Hume, writing on behalf of "nature," admonishes his reader: "Be a philosopher, but, amidst all your philosophy, be still a man." ( Inquiry , p. 18) In the same spirit, Hume observes: "Nature is obstinate, and will not quit the field, however strongly attack'd by reason." ( Treatise , p. 215) In some ways, the preceding passages reflect similar impulses in Hume and Whitehead. They agree that there is more in the world, and in human experience, than can be expressed in analytic propositions. The deep-running differences between the two men flow from their understanding of what the philosopher is to make of that "more." Hume is content to have "two uncoordinated sets of beliefs, one based on the critical examination of our sources of knowledge, and the other on the critical examination of beliefs involved in 'practice'." (PR, p. 232) In that contentment Hume "reaches the high watermark [sic] of anti-rationalism in philosophy." (PR, p. 232) Whitehead cannot agree that philosophy is condemned to the kind of schizophrenia implicit in Hume's outlook. Philosophy is the search for a pattern of coherence among the "presumptions" that Hume and Whitehead agree in re- garding as unavoidable. In Whitehead's view Hume is pushed to his bleak estimate of the chances of finding such a pattern by his misread- ing of (1) the nature and authority of reason and (2) the nature of experience. We shall consider those two topics in turn. A. The Uses of Reason Hume's simplest and best-known account of "the objects of human reason or inquiry" is the one given at the beginning of Section IV of the Inquiry , where Hume explains "relations of ideas" and "matters of fact." In the course of that explanation, two quite different senses of "reason" emerge: ( 1 ) reason as the application of the principle of non- contradiction, and (2) reason as the application of the lessons of ex- perience. There is, of course, nothing amiss in Hume's drawing such a distinction (although we may question its utility), but we find that Hume repeatedly equivocates and vacillates in his use of "reason." Al- though he explicitly identifies matters of fact as objects of human reason, he almost immediately proceeds to talk as if reason and ex- perience are mutually exclusive. But when he wants to characterize cer- tain beliefs (in miracles, for example) as unreasonable, he slips back into the wider use of "reason."6 6. For a somewhat different discussion of Hume's equivocal use of "reason/' see Norman Kemp Smith, The Philosophy of David Hume: A Critical Study of Its Origins and Central Doctrines (London: Macmillan, 1941), pp. 99-102. M5</page><page sequence="12">In the narrow, or "strict," sense, it would not be unreasonable (al- though it might be psychologically impossible) for me to believe that I could touch a burning match to the fuse of a stick of dynamite with- out producing an explosion. In the wider sense, it would be unreason- able for me to believe anything contrary to past experience- a miracle, for example. So, depending on which sense of "reason" we adopt, it either is or is not unreasonable to believe that a miracle (that is, a violation of the "laws of nature") has occurred. In the strong sense of "reason" as based solely on the principle of noncontradiction, miracles are as reasonable as any other occurrences: "Any thing may produce any thing. Creation, annihilation, motion, reason, volition; all these may arise from one another, or from any other object we can imagine." (Treatise, p. 173)7 If we hold Hume to the narrow meaning of "reason" ("either demonstrable or unreasonable"), it is hard to understand his antagonism to certain forms of antirationalist religious belief.8 The fact is, of course, that Hume repeatedly appeals to rational prin- ciples (not, generally, labeled as such by Hume) other than those of a purely logical or analytic sort. It is to Hume's discredit that he finds no consistent way to incorporate such principles into his philosophy. The most he can offer is a conjectural account of how we come to hold rationally unjustifiable beliefs. But even his genetic explanation of those beliefs rests on assumptions that are not, in Hume's view, rationally defensible. For example, Hume makes repetition both an explanation of the production of certain ideas and a norm for the criti- cism of such ideas. But there is no reason why mere repetition should be a norm for anything. Repetition can be a norm only if it signifies the real interconnectedness of events in nature. Without such connections 7. A well-known illustration of the strong sense of "reason" occurs in Book II of the Treatise , where Hume is trying to drive home the point that passions as such cannot be unreasonable. He begins by claiming that it is not "contrary to reason to prefer the destruction of the whole world to the scratching of my finger." ( Treatise , p. 416) Then, as if to show that the passion concerned may be "unselfish," he goes on to say: " 'Tis not contrary to reason for me to chuse my total ruin, to prevent the least uneasiness of an Indian or person wholly unknown to me." ( Treatise , p. 416) It hardly need be added that, in any ordinary sense of "reason," the cases that Hume cites as not contrary to reason are wildly, psychotically irrational. 8. If Hume does not mean that belief in miracles is irrational, it is hard to see what he does mean. In "Hume's Interest in Religion," printed elsewhere in this volume, James Noxon argues that Hume holds that in fact no one ever believes in miracles. Whether this interesting interpretation of Hume is right or wrong, how- ever, it is clear that for Hume it is, or would be, irrational to believe in miracles. If Professor Noxon is right, the irrationality is so great as to preclude belief. 146</page><page sequence="13">our inductive procedures would be virtually baseless.9 If the freezing of water or the blackness of crows were in fact "chance" events (like the drawing of colored balls from an urn), the ratio of observed to un- observed instances in nature would be so small "as scarcely to justify a plausible guess."10 Hume's sense of his philosophical commitments is obscure in respect of his descriptive account of human beliefs; it is even more obscure in respect of his criticism of those beliefs. There are many beliefs, some of them inconsistent with others; but, most curious of all, there is a belief that beliefs should be reasonable (logically consistent, consistent with past experience, and so on)- a kind of second-order belief. This second- order belief is of the essence of rationality: It is the conviction that not all beliefs are equally good, equally compelling. This conviction, that criticism of beliefs is possible, rests on commitments of a sort that Whitehead describes as "speculative." For Hume all beliefs, reasonable and unreasonable, can be "ex- plained"; i.e., a causal account can be given for any belief whatsoever. Unless we give preeminence to the second-order belief in rationality, we have no basis, except personal idiosyncrasies, for preferring one belief to another. To hold that some beliefs are really to be preferred above others is to admit, tacitly at least, that there are nonarbitrary grounds for such preference, and that amounts to admitting that there are reasonable grounds for believing one thing rather than another. To all of this, Hume is prepared to give qualified assent, in some guise or other. For one thing, there can be no serious doubt that Hume takes his system to be true and other, competing systems to be false.11 The critical point, in Whitehead's view, is that Hume provides no means of coordinating his philosophical beliefs with the beliefs required for "practice." And explanation, as Whitehead reminds us, is the analysis of coordination. Just how we come into possession of a nonarbitrary standard of reasonableness remains, in Hume's account, pretty much a mystery. 9. Whitehead discusses the problem of simple location and induction in "The Century of Genius," in Science and the Modern World (New York: Macmillan, 1925)- 10. John Laird, Hume's Philosophy of Human Nature (London: Methuen, 1932), p. 132. Hume's "official" view is that of drawing balls from an urn, and even that simile suggests more knowledge than we in fact have. Events are entirely "loose and separate." Repetition does not increase probability in any intelligible way, although it does produce a kind of nonrational expectation in us. That Hume is eager to embrace determinism only heightens the sense of paradox about his position. 1 1 . See, for example, Treatise , p. xx and Inquiry, pp. 21-22. M7</page><page sequence="14">Custom, for Hume, is the great guide of life, and custom may explain, in a crudely mechanical way, why people behave in certain ways and believe certain things. But it does nothing to help us distinguish true from false and still less to explain why some violations of custom are reasonable while others are not. Repetition, by itself, is no norm, and it begs the question to put "the wise" on the side of certain beliefs, as Hume is sometimes wont to do. In Hume's hands, the whole explana- tory process is made to occur on one level, so to speak; it is linear. According to Whitehead, overstatement is one of the chief errors of philosophy, and he identifies two main forms of that error. The first is what he calls "the fallacy of misplaced concreteness," about which I shall have something to say later. The second major variety of over- statement "consists in a false estimate of logical procedure in respect to certainty, and in respect to premises/' (PR, p. n ) Whitehead goes on to observe that "philosophy has been haunted by the unfortunate notion that its method is dogmatically to indicate premises which are severally clear, distinct, and certain; and to erect upon those premises a deductive system of thought." (PR, pp. 11-12) Descartes comes to mind immediately as the paradigm case of the philosopher who makes the second kind of overstatement, but philosophers generally have been prone to the same mistake. Hume pays his dues to the rationalistic dogma "certain or else not knowledge," but he does so in an oblique, even negative, way. Unlike Descartes, Hume does not believe (at least officially) that we can discover necessary truths about "real existence and matter of fact," but he does accept logical certainty as the conditio sine qua non of genuine knowledge . In other words, he accepts the Cartesian criterion of knowledge, but denies that it is ever satisfied except in the case of "relations of ideas." In Whitehead's view Hume is right to reject the pretensions of rationalist philosophers to encapsulate reality in a watertight logical system; he is wrong to acquiesce in an account of knowledge that inevitably drives him to forswear knowledge in favor of custom, habit, practice, or what have you. Having allowed the rationalists to dictate the rules of the game, Hume concludes, reasonably enough, that philosophers have been dealt a hand they cannot play. For Whitehead the authority of reason derives from the fruitful inter- play of theory and practice. Theory becomes fantasy or dogma if it is not tied, in some way and at some level, to practice. Practice that is not informed by theory becomes dead, repetitive. Strictly speaking, practice without theory is impossible. Without some theoretical framework (to use an intentionally inexact phrase) , we would not know what evidence is relevant to which beliefs. Whitehead puts it like this: ". . . the rele- 148</page><page sequence="15">vanee of evidence is dictated by theory. For you cannot prove a theory by evidence which that theory dismisses as irrelevant/' (AI, p. 284) For this reason, progress is slow in any science that has failed to produce any theory of sufficiently wide scope.12 Beliefs are embedded in a network of other beliefs, theories, princi- ples; they are, in fact, embedded in a hierarchy of such networks. Hume's failure to appreciate the interconnections within the web of knowledge and belief is an important flaw in his system. Hume fails to see that the construction of a conceptual scheme, philosophical or scientific, is "a major effort of the speculative Reason. It involves imagination far outrunning the direct observations." (FR, p. 71 ) In the phrase "speculative reason," the word "reason" appeals to the "orderli- ness of what is reasonable while 'speculation' expresses the transcen- dence of any particular method." (FR, pp. 66-67) A scheme is needed to give significance to observation. A novel observation is likely to be lost if it is not connected with a scheme. On the other hand, the un- no vel observations of Galileo, Newton, and Darwin became important because those men had conceptual schemes- perhaps vague ones- in mind.13 By contrast, it seems never to occur to Hume that (to pick one of many possible examples) he takes for granted that his principles of 12. The Function of Reason contains Whitehead's most compact and accessible discussion of reason - its origin, nature, functions, limits. Despite some reliance on figurative language, Whitehead gives an account of the origin and self-regulation of reason that accommodates the "layering" of actual practice (in contrast to Hume's single-story theory) and the evolution of theories. The figurative language is, in fact, arresting and insightful. Whitehead suggests that reason has two poles or aspects: "There is Reason, asserting itself as above the world, and there is Reason as one of the many factors in the world." (FR, p. 10) The first form of reason man shares with the gods and is personified by Plato. The second form is shared with the foxes and is personified by Ulysses. Plato represents "Reason as seeking a complete understanding"; Ulysses represents "Reason as seek- ing an immediate method of action." (FR, p. 11) Each pole is essential but, by itself, deficient. "Ulysses has no use for Plato, and the bones of his companions are strewn on many a reef and many an isle." (FR, p. 12) Conversely, Plato without Ulysses is prone to fantasy and the construction of castles in the air. The function of reason, Whitehead holds, is to promote life, and it cannot successfully perform that function when it is exclusively theoretical (Plato) or exclusively practical (Ulysses) . 13. The notion of valence in chemistry provides a slightly more esoteric ex- ample of the importance of a scheme. Nineteenth-century scientists drew up a table of chemical affinities, which proved useful in their work. But the why of those affinities had to await further developments in atomic theory. (I take this example from Hartry Field, "Tarski's Theory of Truth," The Journal of Philosophy, Vol. LXIX, No. 13 (July, 1972) .) Examples of this sort strengthen our conviction that 149</page><page sequence="16">association hold for all perceptions indiscriminately. Without that as- sumption he would need a separate appeal to experience for each different kind of impression and idea- for sights, sounds, tastes, and so on, as well as for the interplay of sights with sounds, tastes with sounds, and so on. Hume's treatment of causality and, more generally, of the association of ideas reflects his efforts to make clear what the theoretical commitments of his system are. But his efforts are confused, in part, by his failure to distinguish descriptions of human thought patterns, which he often supposes himself to be making, from normative judg- ments, which he frequently indulges in.14 Given Hume's shifting, un- clear account of the offices and authority of reason and his inconsistent use of reason, it can hardly be surprising that he has no clear idea of what he is doing or what he is taking for granted. Despite the many and profound differences in the details of their philosophies, there is no reason to suppose that Hume would quarrel with Whitehead's dictum that a philosophical system should be co- herent, logical, and necessary, where "necessary" means "bearing in it- self its own warrant of universality throughout all experience." (PR, p. 5) A careful reading of Hume's Introduction to the Treatise and the first chapter of Process and Reality confirms the suspicion that Hume and Whitehead do not after all differ so greatly in what they aim to do. Beyond that, they agree on the ultimate authority of experience. Thus Hume: "None of them [i.e., philosophy, the sciences, and the arts] can go beyond experience, or establish any principles which are not founded on that authority." (' Treatise , p. xxii) So also Whitehead: "The elucida- tion of immediate experience is the sole justification for any thought." (PR, p. 6) Mentioning Hume by name, Whitehead says that he "accepts Hume's doctrine that nothing is to be received into the philosophical scheme which is not discoverable as an element in sub- jective experience." (PR, p. 253) Hume is wrong in supposing that we are, and must remain, in blank ignorance of the reasons things are as they are. The reasons that we discover are never final, of course, but they represent a genuine advance over earlier levels of understanding. Indeed, it is hard to understand Hume's adulation of Newton if Newton did not increase our comprehension of natural laws and thereby deepen our knowledge of the why of things. The whole process of scientific advance, which is often slow and painful, is the work of human reason - reason with a foothold in fact but not chained to fact. 14. It seems to me plainly wrong to say that Hume's account is wholly descrip- tive. I think we must suppose that Hume means what he says when he describes certain beliefs as absurd, fantastic, superstitious, and the like. For what seems to be a contrary view, see J.A. Robinson, "Hume's Two Definitions of 'Cause' Recon- sidered," in Chappell, op. cit., p. 167. 150</page><page sequence="17">In view of their agreement on some basic issues, how are we to explain the equally basic antagonism between Hume and Whitehead? We have already seen how Hume's rigid and simplistic empiricism, beautifully illustrated in his method of challenge ('produce the im- pression"), effectively cripples reason in its search for a coherent philosophical scheme. But perhaps more important than the eviscera- tion of reason is Hume's exiguous interpretation of experience. White- head agrees with Hume that the ultimate appeal in philosophy is to experience, but his reading of experience is radically different from Hume's. For Whitehead, as for William James, Hume's account of ex- perience is denuded, superficial, and infected with a number of un- criticized (and probably unrecognized) a priori prejudices. We now turn to Whitehead's polemic against Hume's theory of experience. B. The Analysis of Experience Hume overestimates the philosophical importance of introspection, but he underestimates the difficulty of describing direct experience and of judging the conformity of philosophical notions to experience. When Whitehead in effect describes experience as the ultimate court of appeal, he is not referring merely, or primarily, to a momentary spread of sense-qualities; he is referring to "the general consciousness of what in practice we experience." (PR, p. 25) "The mere interrogation of im- mediate consciousness at one immediate moment tells us very little." (FR, p. 77) The data from which philosophy generalizes must come from a variety of sources: from memory, the testimony of others, com- mon practice, science, literature, language, and other human institu- tions. Unless we take account of such data, we have no chance of find- ing stable, pervasive philosophical categories. (Whitehead observes that Kant sought "to balance the world upon thought- oblivious to the scanty supply of thinking." (PR, p. 229)) The strained attitude of introspective analysis is likely to produce "merely a reflection of the temperamental presuppositions of exceptional personalities." (PR, p. 25) When taken as reflecting a basic philosophical stance, Hume's demand "produce the impression" strikes one as quixotic, even pathological. But Hume not only restricts the range of data from which philosophy starts; he offers a superficial analysis of immediate experience. The easy assumption, which Hume shares with Descartes, Berkeley, and many others, that we can grasp immediate experience in its pristine purity is a mistake, but it is a natural one, given the philosophical tradition within which Hume writes. If experience be identified with what is clearly and *5*</page><page sequence="18">definitely present to consciousness, it is natural, perhaps inevitable, that Hume should conclude that all the perceptions of the mind "must necessarily appear in every particular what they are, and be what they appear/' ( Treatise , p. 190) This quotation illustrates one pole of Hume's vacillation between the question "What do we experience?" and the question "What can we experience?" Hume has a method for answering the second question. It is the method of introspection, by which we can "determine the given components of experience in ab- straction from our private way of subjective reaction, by reflexion, con- jecture, emotion, and purpose." (AI, p. 288) Hume's analysis of experience reflects the prejudice, endemic to Western philosophy since Plato, that what is simple, clear, and distinct must be basic. Whatever justification that attitude has in mathematics, it has none in philosophy. The contrary thesis - that clear consciousness of well-defined objects is the crown of experience and not its base- is more nearly true. Unfortunately, in visual perception, which has usually been taken as the model for all experience, the primitive elements of the experience are almost completely submerged under the clear-cut dis- crimination of colors and shapes. (I say "almost," for, as we shall see later, the proper analysis of seeing discloses a sense of what Whitehead calls "causal efficacy.") In touch and taste, the primitive elements (especially the functioning of the body in the experiences) are more obvious; but we are so mesmerized by the lure of the clear and distinct that we tend to dismiss those elements as irrelevant or to transform them into second-class sensations of the usual sort. Against Hume, Whitehead denies the doctrine of the "transparency" of experience- the view that all the elements of experience lie open to easy inspection.15 "The dim recesses of experience present immense difficulties for analysis." (FR, p. 77) The same theme recurs in Process and Reality : "We are not conscious of any clear-cut complete analysis of immediate experience, in terms of the various details which comprise its definiteness." (PR, p. 6) So, understandable or not, the Humean analysis of experience is wrong-headed and is a disaster for philosophy. Indeed, most of the difficulties of philosophy can be traced to the topsy- turvy analysis of experience that Hume so clearly illustrates. Whitehead contends, then, that Hume's theory of perception is 15. For an apparent concession by Hume that the inspection of experience is not so simple and straightforward as he usually seems to believe, see Inquiry , p. 22: "It is remarkable, concerning the operations of the mind, that, though most intimately present to us, yet, whenever they become the object of reflection, they seem in- volved in obscurity, nor can the eye readily find those lines and boundaries which discriminate and distinguish them." The effect would have been salutary had Hume taken these difficulties more seriously. 152</page><page sequence="19">fundamentally wrong. It is not Hume's logic but his basic assumptions about experience that Whitehead finds untenable. Given those assump- tions, Hume is driven quite logically to skepticism regarding knowledge of cause and of the external world. Hume correctly answers the question "How can we have knowledge of cause and of a real external world if our direct experience contains no evidence of causal connections and no evidence of a world transcendent to that experience?" The answer is: in no way. But the question is complex, in the logical sense. It assumes as a fact something that is not a fact and asks the question on that basis. The "fact" presupposed by the question is that direct experience reveals no element of causality and no evidence of real entities beyond the ex- perience. Whitehead maintains, against Hume, that a proper analysis of experience discloses an element of causal efficacy and (therefore) evidence of realities beyond the experience itself. This element is, ad- mittedly, more vague and difficult to isolate than Hume's impressions of sensation (or what Whitehead calls data in the mode of "presenta- tional immediacy" ) . Examples of the causal element in perception are memory (especially memory of the immediate past), visceral feelings, and the sense of the "withness" of the body in perception (for example, the sense of the efficacy of the eye in seeing) . What Hume does is to take a part of our experience - an important part, to be sure- and treat it as the whole of experience. In giving us a truncated version of ex- perience, Hume is guilty of what Whitehead calls "the fallacy of mis- placed concreteness"- the fallacy of mistaking an abstraction for a concrete reality.16 (We shall see later that Hume himself, on occasion, unwittingly admits the causality of the body in perception.) By fastening on those parts of experience that are most clearly per- ceived, Hume fails to find any element of causality. His trouble is that he is so dominated by a certain model of thinking that he cannot look in the right place to find the missing elements; he is, as Whitehead puts it, unable to view experience devoid of the a priori fig leaf with which he clothes it. It is this unempirical straitjacketing of experience that leads William James to qualify his own empiricism as "radical" and to insist that Hume's epistemological atomism flies in the face of the obvious fact that the connections in experience are just as surely 16. Hume in effect asks this question: How can we fabricate concrete particular facts out of the logically primitive impressions of sensation? The correct answer is that we cannot. "A young man does not initiate his experience by dancing with impressions of sensation, and then proceed to conjecture a partner. His experience takes the converse route." (PR, p. 481) Philosophy must begin with what is con- crete and then seek to explain what is abstract by means of the concrete. (Cf. PR, p. 30.) Any philosophy that reverses this process is, so far forth, guilty of the fallacy of misplaced concreteness. *53</page><page sequence="20">"given" as the disconnections. It will be worth our while to consider briefly Whitehead's analysis of how Hume is misled by a model of thinking that Hume explicitly repudiates. The model is, oddly enough, the substance-quality mode of thought. Consider the following statement by Hume: We may observe, that 'tis universally allow'd by philosophers, and is besides pretty obvious of itself, that nothing is ever really present with the mind but its perceptions or impressions and ideas, and that ex- ternal objects become known to us only by those perceptions they occasion. To hate, to love, to think, to feel, to see; all this is nothing but to perceive. ( Treatise , p. 67) Whitehead interprets this passage, and others like it, as implying two objectionable doctrines about the datum in experience: what White- head calls (1) the subjectivist principle and (2) the sensationalist principle. The subjectivist principle is "that the datum in experience can be adequately analysed purely in terms of universais." (PR, p. 239) The sensationalist principle is "that the primary activity in the act of experience is the bare subjective entertainment of the datum, devoid of any subjective form of reception. This is the doctrine of mere sensa- tion." (PR, p. 239) We shall concentrate on the subjectivist principle. In view of Hume's notorious nominalism, it is jarring to read that he takes the datum in experience to consist of universais. But Whitehead means what he says, and he proceeds to explain the "charge" in such a way as to make it plausible, if not absolutely convincing. The mind, according to Hume, knows only its own perceptions, that is, its impres- sions and ideas, and those perceptions are covertly treated as the quali- ties of a subject- the subject being the mind. Hume's examples of im- pressions of sensation in the first section of the Treatise are universais: red, scarlet, orange, sweet, and bitter. They are particular instances of the mind's awareness of universais, not of particular existents exempli- fying universais. Note how Hume characterizes the difference between impressions and ideas, or, as we might say, between perceiving and thinking: "The first circumstance, that strikes my eye, is the great re- semblance betwixt our impressions and ideas in every other particular, except their degree of force and vivacity." ( Treatise , p. 2) 17 17. Additional circumstantial evidence that Hume regards impressions (and ideas) as universais is his assumption that they can be repeated. Such repeatable entities are traditionally designated as universais. But there is a complication in Hume's scheme: Perceptions are incurably "particular" and therefore irrepeatable. It is not open to Hume to distinguish between character (or essence) and existence, for the idea of existence is not a separate one. (Cf. Treatise , pp. 66-68.) The up- *54</page><page sequence="21">Impressions of sensation are free-floating qualities that get attached to entities in the external world only by practice, custom, or habit.18 But they are attached to the mind or "soul": Impressions of sensation arise "in the soul originally, from unknown causes/' ( Treatise , p. 7; emphasis added) It is little wonder that Hume regards his perceptions as satisfying the Cartesian definition of a substance: They require nothing but themselves in order to exist- nothing, that is, but a mind in which to inhere. That Hume later criticizes the Cartesian notion of a substantial mind does not lessen his dependence on that notion in his theory of perception. The notion of cause is central for both Hume and Whitehead. Not finding cause in his analysis of perception, Hume is forced to seek it in a kind of mental fiction, produced by habit or custom, by which the mind passes from an impression to the idea of its usual attendant.19 In Whitehead's view, Hume is right in not finding causality among the data of presentational immediacy, but he is wrong in restricting per- ception to such data. For Hume our experience is limited, in its basic shot is that Hume cannot account for repetition but must assume it. (On the last point, see Church, op. cit., pp. 53-54.) 18. It is worth noting that practice, custom, and habit are the plebeian equiva- lents in Hume's philosophy of Descartes's veracious God. Like God, they serve to neutralize the corrosive effects of the skepticism implicit in the subjectivist principle. Although far from conclusive, this similarity between Descartes and Hume lends further support to Whitehead's contention that Hume, in spite of his sharp criti- cism of the notion of substance, is under the sway of the substance-quality mode of thought. It is a sign of incoherence at the most basic level when a philosopher is forced to make an ad hoc appeal, whether to God's goodness or to preestablished harmony or to custom, in order to save his system from collapse. 19. John Laird complains that John Cook Wilson and Whitehead ignore Hume's claim that we do have an impression of necessary connection - an im- pression of reflection. Hume holds that when we have a feeling of necessitai ion in our minds, we have an "impression" of cause. Our mistake consists in transferring the feeling to things. Repetition cannot do anything with objects, but it does some- thing to us: It produces an impression of reflection. Laird concedes that Hume should have concluded that the feeling of necessary connection is a manner rather than an impression or an idea. The feeling of de- termination is "a constrained associative transition" that compels belief , and belief is a manner of perceiving or conceiving. Laird also concedes that if the idea of cause must proceed from an impression, then Hume did not discover any such clear impression. See Laird, op. cit., pp. 128i. I will add just three comments. (1) Hume does deny that there is any causal feeling in the basic elements of perception - impressions of sensation. (2) White- head offers detailed criticisms of Hume's efforts to account for our idea of cause, and Laird's reminder does little or nothing to blunt the criticisms. ( 3 ) The Humean notion of "manner" has serious problems of its own, as we saw earlier in this essay, so Laird's suggested rehabilitation of Hume's theory of cause is not promising. *55</page><page sequence="22">elements, to the sights, sounds, tastes, and so on of sense-perception. Of course, Hume does not actually restrict himself to such a scanty supply of information about the world (and neither does anyone else): He appeals vaguely to "memory" and "practice" to supplement the infor- mation afforded by direct sensation. Hence, Hume's demand "produce the impression" is not merely quixotic, as I suggested above, but dis- ingenuous as well. As a final illustration of the inadequacy of Hume's method (and, indirectly, an illustration of Whitehead's own method), we shall fol- low, in abbreviated form, a portion of Whitehead's dissection of Hume's doctrine of cause. According to Hume, we infer a causal connection between events be- cause of the repetition of certain sequences in our experience. If A and B have been associated in certain ways in our experience, then we expect B when A is given. And that, in brief, is all there is to causality. Let us see how that explanation fares. Suppose an electric light is turned on in a room where a man has been sitting for some time in the dark. The man's eyes blink. Why? The physiological explanation is straightforward, even if the details are rather complicated. A spasm of neuro-muscular excitement is trans- mitted along nerves to some nodal center, and a responding nervous impulse causes the contraction of the eyelids. This account is, of course, oversimplified, but a technically refined account would still in- volve no reference to impressions of sensation or ideas. Although the account is wholly in causal terms, there is not the slightest suggestion of Hume's theory of cause. We may easily imagine how Hume would reply to this criticism: The physiological explanation is sheer conjecture about a side of the world of which we must remain completely ignorant. Very well. Let us put aside our instinctive reluctance to reduce a well-established science to the level of a fairy tale. Let us turn instead to the experience of the man himself. He knows what made him blink-- the flash of light. If his statement be doubted, he will retort, "I know the flash made me blink; I felt it." Hume would not accept the man's statement that the flash made him blink. There is no impression of making; there are just the flash and the blink. What the man actually felt, according to Hume, was his habit of blinking after flashes. There are obvious difficulties with Hume's explanation. Although it is improbable, the man may never have been exposed to sudden bright light, in which case he cannot have developed the required habit. (Since a newborn baby would react to a bright light in the same way as the man, the objection is not far- 156</page><page sequence="23">fetched.) But even if the man does habitually blink after flashes of light, how can a habit be felt when a cause cannot? Is there any more immediacy in the feeling of a habit than in the feeling of a cause? The feeling of a habit is not the perception of something that is there as a spatial object; it is not an impression of sensation, as Hume freely admits. The formation of a habit requires time; and the feeling of a habit requires memory, the feeling of the conformation of the present to the past. How is it different from a cause? (In view of Hume's hope- lessly inadequate account of memory, we ought to be suspicious of any doctrine that rests on his theory of memory.) Hume has confused a habit of feeling blinks after flashes with something quite different- the feeling of the habit of feeling blinks after flashes. The root of Hume's refusal to accept the natural explanation of the man's blinking is the dogma that all experience is in the mode of presentational immediacy- a dogma, as Whitehead wryly observes, "not to be upset by a mere appeal to direct experience." (PR, p. 266) There is another fact of experience that Hume's account of cause is ill-equipped to explain. In Hume's view, causal feelings are produced by the association of well-marked perceptions occurring in certain pat- terns. It is reasonable to suppose, accordingly, that inhibitions of "sensa"- the clear-cut data of presentational immediacy- should be accompanied by a diminution of causal feelings. Unfortunately for Hume, the contrary is the case. An inhibition of familiar sensa is very apt to leave us a prey to vague terrors respecting a circumambient world of causal operations. In the dark there are vague presences, doubtfully feared; in the silence, the irresistible causal efficacy of nature presses itself upon us; in the vagueness of the low hum of insects in an August woodland, the inflow into ourselves of feelings from enveloping nature overwhelms us; in the dim consciousness of half-sleep, the presentations of sense fade away, and we are left with the vague feeling of influences from vague things around us. It is quite untrue that the feelings of various types of influences are dependent upon the familiarity of well-marked sensa in immediate presentment. Every way of omitting the sensa still leaves us a prey to vague feelings of influence. (PR, p. 267) The point just made- that inhibition of the vivid data of conscious- ness does not diminish feelings of causality- receives additional sup- port if we look to the world of "lower" living things. What is lacking at the organic level of existence is not causal feelings but the clarity and variety of sensory perceptions. A jellyfish advances and withdraws, thereby exhibiting some dim perception of its causal relationship with *57</page><page sequence="24">the world beyond itself. Even a plant grows downward to water and upward to sunlight. "There is thus some direct reason for attributing dim, slow feelings of causal nexus, although we have no reason for any ascription of the definite percepts in the mode of presentational im- mediacy." (PR, p. 268) Apart from some possible qualms about White- head's "anthropomorphic" language (for example, "feeling," which is a quasi-technical term in Whitehead), there can be no doubt that Whitehead is correct in the way he fixes the relative importance of "causal efficacy" and "presentational immediacy" in sub-mammalian organisms. To the extent that he is right, and to the extent that we take evolution seriously, there is a presumption that Hume's doctrine of cause is wrong. In the very early pages of the Treatise Hume ascribes impressions of sensation to unknown causes. Nevertheless, just a few pages later we find him challenging the proponents of substance to produce the per- ceptual basis of their doctrine. Where does the idea of substance come from? Our senses? Which ones? "If it [substance] be perceiv'd by the eyes , it must be a colour; if by the ears , a sound; if by the palate , a taste; and so of the other senses." ( Treatise , p. 16; emphasis added) Discuss- ing the notion of extension, Hume argues that his senses convey to him "only the impressions of coloured points, disposed in a certain manner. If the eye is sensible of any thing farther, I desire it may be pointed out to me." ( Treatise , p. 34; emphasis added) Yet again: "Tis universally allow'd by the writers on optics, that the eye at all times sees an equal number of physical points. . . ." ( Treatise , p. 112; emphasis added) In each of these passages Hume has the eye seeing. The usual comment is that Hume is merely using common forms of expression, that he is really speaking only of impressions on the mind. Indeed, Whitehead conjectures that "in the dim future, some learned scholar will gain reputation by emending 'eye' into 'ego'." (PR, p. 180) Whitehead dis- agrees with that gloss: Hume is expressing his real conviction that the body functions causally in perception, and in any case the form of speech that Hume uses is intelligible because "it expresses the ultimate truth of animal perception." (PR, p. 180) If Hume had considered alternative causes of vision- excessive consumption of alcohol, for ex- ample-he might have been less ready to profess ignorance of the causes of perception. Why worry about eyesight and intoxication if the causes of vision be indeed unknown? "The reason for the existence of oculists and prohibitionists is that various causes are known." (PR, p. 26o)20 20. Whitehead describes Hume's profession of ignorance of the causes of per- ception as a piece of "make-believe"; Hume's real conviction is embodied in the 158</page><page sequence="25">Since in normal vision we see with the eye but do not see the eye, it is easy for Hume to extrude the body when he is discussing impressions of sensation and their correspondent ideas. He is more likely to ac- knowledge (unintentionally, it may be assumed) the "withness" of the body when he is trying to explain the process of experience, than he is when he is focusing on the clearly given objects of experience. We re- quire the notion of cause not only to live but also to philosophize, as Hume shows when he tells us how the perceptual process operates. IV. I have tried in the course of this paper to examine some important Humean doctrines from a Whiteheadian perspective. I have also tried to trace the sources of Hume's errors- if such they be- to his conception of philosophy, specifically his theory of reason and his analysis of ex- perience. The divergences between Hume and Whitehead on those issues amount to a profound difference in their visions of the task of philosophy (although there are important similarities, as I have also tried to show). I have said very little about Whitehead's own positive views, except as it was necessary for the discussion of Hume. I have de- fended Whitehead's views only in this oblique way: If Hume is wrong on some of the crucial issues broached, then Whitehead has a chance of being right, but not otherwise. Whitehead's criticisms of Hume reflect his regard for his great an- tagonist. Referring to Einstein, Whitehead observes that uncritical acceptance is the worst homage we can pay to genius. If lively, sustained criticism is a mark of respect, we must pitch Whitehead's esteem for Hume very high indeed. Although I have not verified my impression by an actual count, I believe that there are more references to Hume in Whitehead's "metaphysical" writings (i.e., those from 1925 onward) than to any other single philosopher. If this is true- and it cannot be statement that visual perceptions depend on the eyes. (PR, p. 259) John Laird de- fends Hume against Whitehead's charge. Although Hume's professed attitude toward "unknown causes" is in some sense make-believe, Laird argues, the make- believe just is Hume's philosophy. As an agent , Hume is convinced of the reality of bodies and causes and the efficacy of sense organs. The philosophical issue, how- ever, is what sort of rational proof one might find for such instinctive beliefs. Hume thinks there is none. See Laird, op. cit., p. 25 and 170. Laird seems to ignore Whitehead's reasons for saying that Hume is indulging in make-believe. Whitehead may, of course, be mistaken about Hume's state of mind, but that is irrelevant to the charge of inconsistency. If the make-believe represents Hume's real conviction as a philosopher, that just points up again the inadequacy of Hume's doctrine of reason and of his estimate of the sources of philosophical con- struction. *59</page><page sequence="26">far wrong- it is a measure of Whitehead's estimate of Hume's place in the history of philosophy. Descartes may be the most important source of the errors of modern philosophy, but it is Hume who most clearly and remorselessly drives them home. In choosing to do battle with Hume, Whitehead is acknowledging Hume's preeminence. If Hume is wrong- and Whitehead believes that he is wrong, in fundamental ways- he is interestingly and fruitfully wrong. He asks the right ques- tions, and that is at least as important as getting the right answers. Even the failures of a great philosopher are worth more than the jejune con- sistencies of lesser philosophers. Whitehead has Hume, among others, in mind when he says: "Philos- ophy never reverts to its old position after the shock of a great philoso- pher." (PR, p. 16) No other philosopher more richly deserves that tribute than David Hume, the greatest philosopher ever to write in the English language. 160</page></plain_text>
