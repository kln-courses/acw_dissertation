The sale coincided with Fabric, Wood and Clay: The Diverse World of Navajo Art, an exhibit of Navajo creativity in traditional and contemporary forms. In the exhibit, alongside familiar "Chiefs' Blankets" TDR: The Drama Review 50:4 (T192) Winter 2006. ?2006 New York University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology</page><page sequence="2">and silver work, was Florence Riggs's explosion of dinosaurs, meticulously woven into a three-by-four-foot vibrantly colored rug. Brown pitch-glazed pottery was dotted with horned toad lizards or shaped into grinning fat bears, paws raised in greeting or, perhaps, in gleeful attack. Mud-toy Uncle Sams sat astride painted mud horses. The exhibit featured the extraordinary carvings of the late Charlie Willeto, a medicine man whose violation of Navajo taboos concerning representation and wood carving earned him critical acclaim after his death at age 67,1 and perhaps, according to one of his two sur- viving sons, a tragic run of "bad luck" affecting his family (Rosenak 1998:56). Of Charlie's eight children with Elizabeth Willeto Ignacio, a gifted carver in her own right, only two are still alive. One of these two sons, Robin, then 40, was at the folk art sale: an impressive figure, standing out from the crowd of turquoise-studded Anglo collectors who had gathered early to survey the work. Robin is a big man, tall and heavy. A black leather bandana tied across his forehead gave him the appearance of an outlaw biker who took a wrong turn and ended up, incongruously enough, on the meticulously landscaped grounds of El Pedregal, the gal- lery and upscale retail complex that houses the Heard North. This complex also serves The Boulders, a luxury resort where, in February, rooms go for over $600 per night. Robin-an artist, like his father-arrived late to the sale and brought only a few pieces. His work is widely collected; most of these pieces were already sold when I reached his table. I was especially taken by his two-and-a-half-foot sculpture of an Indian wearing a floor-length bonnet, all carved out of cedar-his first work using cedar, he told me. Most carvers use cot- tonwood or pine. The figure seemed washed in browns rather than painted; the effect made it appear both faded and glowing, a quality also intrinsic to Charlie Willeto's work. The piece was sold, but I was still compelled by it. "What do you call him?" I asked. Robin was gazing down. I had to really look to see his quick half-smile. "Chief Dan George," he replied. There was laughter all around. Chief Dan George is arguably the most famous Hollywood Indian. In the film Little Big Man he asks Dustin Hoffman's character, "Am I dead yet?" Hoffman replies, "No, grandfa- ther." "Damn," Chief Dan George mutters. "I can never get this right" (Penn 1970). Robin Willeto's choice of an actor, and of this particular actor, to characterize his carving is illustrative. Like Chief Dan George in this scene, Robin is a trickster, actively staging both himself and his work in his encounters with traders and collectors. Even as he notes, somewhat wistfully, that he hopes to carve in the spirit of his late father, he disrupts genealogical continuity by spelling his last name "Wellito." When asked for an explanation, he told two author-collectors this was because of the Navajo postal system (see also Eddington and Makov 1995: 123). I've heard a variety of other explanations, including misspellings on his birth certificate but, whatever the 1. Charlie Willeto's age is a matter of dispute. As Chuck and Jan Rosenak note in Navajo Folk Art: The People Speak, while Willeto's death certificate lists the year of his birth as 1897, his family's tribal enrollment card lists 1906. He could have been as young as 58 when he died (1998:58). Figure 1.

Not only does Navajo folk art often disrupt or manipulate a variety of cultural taboos while simultaneously demonstrating continuity with other aspects of native cultural life, disruption and continuity are also integral to its circulation and display in collections and museums. Moreover, I suggest that such disruptions and continuities can be thought through in terms of performance-revealing aspects of the art itself, the commodity in general, and the networks both create, as performatively constituted. Maps in/and Stories Small Worlds Michel de Certeau observes, "What the map cuts up, the story cuts across" (1984:129), but, in the American Southwest, map and story-cutting up and cutting across-are not so eas- ily opposed. Stories, including sacred histories of Native Americans and oral histories of the non-Native traders, divvy up space and genealogy. Maps cut across these stories with other designations: reservations, monuments, historic sites, trading posts.2 Likewise, continuity and disruption are not binary opposites in this context but animating copresences. Negotiations between continuity and disruption are, literally and metaphorically, concretized into these folk art objects, as are both maps and stories. Two aspects of these negotiations between disruption and continuity in Navajo folk art concern me here. First, I briefly outline a theory of the commodity in/as performance. Here I hope to disrupt the conventional views of who and what performs, even as I signal continuity with extant definitions of both "performance" and "commodity." Second, I offer examples of some performance dynamics in specific works of Navajo folk art. First, definitions are in order. "Navajo folk art" is a contested and elastic term. In their book Navajo Folk Art: The People Speak (1998)-the first and only systematic, book-length treatment of the subject-Chuck and Jan Rosenak argue that the category is characterized as: work by untrained, self-taught artists that is nonutilitarian, highly personal, even idio- syncratic. The craft may be derived from communal traditions, but something personal must be added to qualify it as art. In other words, the craft may be learned but the art is self-taught. (5) Artists, traders, and collectors I've spoken with over five years (2001-2006) feel this primarily etic definition is overly and needlessly restrictive, and a close look at its presumptions makes it easy to see why. First, the distinction between craft/learned and art/self-taught is difficult to uphold in practice. The cases of families of artists are illustrative. The late Charlie Willeto is, arguably, the tribe's most famous folk artist. His small sculptures include human and anthropomorphic figures with arms upraised and bent at the elbows, and owls, many with moustaches. Willeto's works are painted using motifs from Navajo rugs and sandpainting, as well as rock art (Kogan 2002:19); many wear Navajo jewelry. His wife, Elizabeth Ignacio, and sons Harold and Robin, also carve. The subject matter of their carvings, their figures' stances, and elements of their painting are both idiosyncratic and yet clearly reminiscent of Charlie's work. As the Willeto family demonstrates, more than the mechanics of "craft" circulate in the learning process across generations. Navajo carver Homer Warren passed on more than simply his techniques for working sandstone into solid, yet whimsical, horses to his children. 2. The Rosenaks' book (1998) is an interesting example of this interanimating relationship between map and story. To facilitate their accounts of finding and meeting artists, which often reads like an adventure tale of bad roads and vague directions, they both cut up the Navajo reservation into regions and then cut across these divisions with their narrative.</page><page sequence="4">The facial features of his figures, and his color palette, are clearly discernible in the work of his daughters Delphine, Lindaphine, and Seraphine, though the work of each is, at the same time, quite unique. Also, the emphasis on being "self-taught" presupposes a level of isolation from institutions that is often more imagined than real, particularly for younger Navajo artists. Some "folk artists" have had formal art training in high school; others have attended community colleges or universities, or conservatories like the Institute of American Indian Arts in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The formulation "highly personal" in the Rosenaks' definition is also something of a mystification, divorced from the material conditions of the production of some artists' work. In a number of cases, family members of artists create and assemble the work, which is then signed by the individual. Finally, Native American art exposes the arbitrariness of taxonomies categorizing creative production. The spectacular baskets of Elsie Holiday, Rose Williams's pitch-glazed coffee pots, and Florence Riggs's pictorial rugs are neither purely functional nor purely decorative. Some of this work has been displayed in major art museums and pub- lished in "fine art" catalogs. Is this "fine art," "folk art," or "craft"? Here I opt for a more emic definition: pictorial rugs, carv- ings, pottery, baskets, and paintings can be considered "folk art" if they fit within, or expand, the existing range of objects already included in the category; and/or if the creator of the piece, or the trader3 or collector who buys it, considers it part of the category. Thus, "Navajo folk art" describes a set of relationships between people, objects, and history-not the biographies of individual artists or the properties of the objects themselves. Though the properties of Navajo folk art cannot be suf- ficiently generalized to serve as a prescriptive definition, the objects in question do share some similar characteristics. These include an economy of form; thematic or ironic ref- erences to Navajo traditions and/or everyday life; and often Figure 2. A grinning George W. Bush holds up a Navajo weaving, sidelining the unsmiling Navajo woman next to him, in Delphine Warren's sandstone carving God Bless the USA.

The role of traders in the creation, circulation, and expansion of the category "Navajo folk art" cannot be overstated for reasons that exceed the scope of this essay. 149</page><page sequence="5">150 150 a sense of commentary-sometimes biting, sometimes playful. Harrison Juan's wood carving of a leering Bill Clinton, for example, shows a smiling Navajo woman reflected in Clinton's sunglasses. Delphine Warren's grinning George W. Bush dwarfs a decidedly unsmiling Navajo woman at his side. In this sandstone carving, Bush is holding up a Navajo weaving that reads "GOD BLESS THE USA" and appears to be trying to elbow the woman out of the frame. Finally, these objects circulate in contexts that value not just the objects them- selves, but also-indeed especially-their "Indianness." The notion of "small worlds" I use here is polyphonic. First, many of the pieces I describe are themselves small worlds, like the Hathale family's "memory aids" discussed below. These pieces are literally "world making": they re-create and represent contexts ranging from the geocosmological to the vernacular worlds of everyday life. The work itself is often small. It does not typically participate in a rhetoric of the monu- mental where size, in and of itself, matters. Indeed, the small scale of much of this work focuses the viewer's attention on details, even in pieces with comparatively simple lines. This focus encourages a particular kind of close reading; viewers might read the actual details of a piece (color, shape, design), the details (spots, nicks, splits) in the material, and the intersection of both. These details may also speak as/of artists', traders', and collectors' personal or cultural fantasies and projections. They may refer to the "eventness" of the commodity situation, as discussed below. Finally, the arts I describe here circulate in small worlds-communities of artists, traders, collectors, and museums-where it seems every- body knows everybody. "Things Act" After Arjun Appadurai, I define the commodity as "anything intended for exchange" (1986:5). In so doing, I hope to avoid any binarism between "art" and "commodity," thus also avoid- ing what Appadurai calls "an excessively positivist conception of the commodity, as being a certain kind of thing, thus restricting [...] debate to the matter of deciding what kind of thing it is" (13). This is in contrast to Bill Brown, who distinguishes between the "object" and the "thing." The former is characterized by its use value and symbolic capital-that is, its com- modity potential-and the latter by its misuse value, its potential to be deployed counter to its purpose (Brown 2003:359). Appadurai's definition is particularly relevant to Navajo folk art, which functioned at its very outset as a medium for exchange rather than solely and simply as an aesthetic practice. Charlie Willeto, for example, carved and traded his work for food at a Lybrook, New Mexico, trading post (Rosenak 1998:22).4 This is not purely an historical phenomenon. For the major- ity of Navajo artists I have interviewed, folk art production is income production as much as self-expression. In some cases, it generates off-the-books income to supplement assistance payments. For others, like Mamie Deschillie (famous for her cardboard cutouts of fluffy sheep and other creatures, all adorned with sequins and bits of fabric, eyelashes and earrings), folk art puts children and grandchildren through college. For Appadurai, a contextual, social life is intrinsic to the commodity. He writes: Let us approach commodities as things in a certain situation, a situation that can characterize many different kinds of things, at different points in their social lives. This [...] means breaking significantly with the production-dominated Marxian view of the commodity and focusing on its total trajectory from production through exchange/distribution, to consumption. (1986:13) Further, the "commodity situation" in the social life of any "thing" can be productively enlarged by reading with and against the notion of "commodity fetishism" wherein objects 4. See also Steve Simpson's account of his initial meeting with Homer Warren (2002), and Kogan (2002).</page><page sequence="6">are animated, appearing "as autonomous figures endowed with a life of their own, which enter into relations both with each other and with the human race" (Marx in Bennett 2001:117). In classical Marxist terms, "things" perform and "living, laboring persons are deadened" (Bennett 2001:117). Yet, as both Appadurai and philosopher Jane Bennett suggest, the com- modity situation is not quite so simple. Bennett contends that "Marx is too dismissive" of this animation of the object. "Within his frame," she argues, "it is reduced to the atavistic practice of fetishization" (117). In contrast, Bennett sees the animation of objects as a source of productive questions: What does it mean for eth- ics and politics when objects appear as animate or as capable of making claims upon us? Is this best described as "fetishization"? [...] What are the theatrical techniques by which commodities exert power over human bodies? What is the role of repetition in commodification? What dimensions of the consuming self does such repetition act upon? (116) Viewed from a performance perspective, there are several striking elements about this list of questions. Implicit here are the assumptions that "theatrical techniques" and repetition are intrinsic to the commodity situation; our task is only to discover which ones and how. Further, in commodity situations, objects are not only animated; they not only enter into relations with us but, potentially, make claims on those who enter these situations as well. As Richards observes, "Things act, speak, rise, fall, fly, evolve..." (1991:11). Performance theory's emphasis on the embodied, contested notions of culture makes it a particularly useful tool for examining which theatrical techniques animate specific com- modity situations, and how particular objects assert their claims, in their individual contexts. Further, it clearly illuminates the macro- and micropolitics involved in these transactions. I suggest that objects animated in and by commodity situations, and Navajo folk art in par- ticular, perform in multiple senses of the word. Here I am working closely from Richard Bauman's definition of performance, developed in the context of his analyses of oral stories, including the folktale: I understand performance as a mode of communication, a way of speaking, the essence of which resides in the assumption of responsibility to an audience for a display of com- municative skill, highlighting the way in which communication is carried out, above and beyond its referential content. [...] Performance calls forth special attention to and heightened awareness of both the act of expression and the performer. Viewed in these terms, performance may be understood as the enactment of the poetic function, the essence of spoken artistry. (1986:3) Figure 3. Cardboard Chickens, by Mamie Deschillie.

(Photo by Judith Hamera) 151</page><page sequence="7">152 Bauman's references to "speaking" and "spoken artistry" are not impediments to my view of the commodity in/as performance. In the discussion "Story Time," which also examines the folktale, de Certeau argues for a view of story that makes a movement rather than simply tell- ing about it (1984:81). For de Certeau, stories bind the art of speaking to the art of operating in everyday life: [T]he same practices now appear in a verbal field, now in a field of nonlinguistic actions; they move from one field to the other, being equally tactical and subtle in both; they keep the ball moving between them-from the workday to evening, from cooking to legends and gossip, from the devices of lived history to those of history retold. (78) After de Certeau, I see a praxical and procedural homology between stories-"performance in the verbal field"-and Navajo folk art objects as "nonlinguistic action." Both are the prod- ucts of acts of poesis and devices of lived history; both move from the verbal field into those of the visual, tactile, kinesthetic. Both assume and demonstrate what de Certeau calls "savoir dire," the "know-how-to-say" (78), the communicative competence integral to a story's, or an object's, social and poetic functions. The object, like the performed story, is the membrane across which performers/artists and audiences encounter and imagine one another, whether from opposite sides of the proscenium or opposite sides of a trading post or gallery counter. None are simply texts waiting to be animated, but displays that bind communicative compe- tence, history, affect, action, and thought together within the commodity situation. Thus, the object in the situation speaks; it is simultaneously a story and an event. It animates relations of exchange even as it is itself animated in the process. These relationships between stories and the Navajo folk art object in/as performance are not simply theoretical. Acquisition of these objects in commodity situations is suffused with performance. Indeed, it is possible to view the purchase of these objects as the purchase of stories in performance. An anonymous 1905 article in Brush and Pencil asserts: One may view an olla or a basket and admire, in a casual way, its odd designs, and turn away with but a slight thrill of pleasure. Let the maker of that article interpret the significance of those colors, pattern, and shape, and he has found a feast for his soul. These are poems, histories, and creeds woven into every Indian basket and imprinted upon every decorated piece of pottery. (in Dilworth 1996:138) Further, this desire for story in performance and/as the commodity is not purely histori- cal-as Barry Simpson, a member of one of the major Southwest trading families and owner, with his brother Steve, of Twin Rocks Trading Post, indicates in the following narrative. The Simpsons are known for their commitment to and advocacy of Navajo basketry. They are widely credited with raising the profile of the form and with the development of the spec- tacularly complex "art basket." Here, Barry relates how Jonathan Black, whose wife Alicia Nelson is also a gifted weaver, negotiates performance in/as the commodity situation: On a recent visit [...] Alicia made her way into the trading post with a very interesting basket, which portrayed an ear of corn on a white background, surrounded by a green and black border. There were a number of people in the store, and everyone was drawn to the basket; they all wanted to know what it meant. Alicia quickly let everyone know that she had not woven the basket; her husband did, and he was in the car. The group wanted to know the symbolism behind the design. Having been through this scenario before, I knew what was coming. Giving me a nervous look, Alicia went to the door and gave Jonathan the "come on in" wave. It seemed to have no effect. Waving a second and then a third time with more emphasis, Alicia finally drew Jonathan from the car. Slowly coming up the steps, with a look of apprehension on his face, Jonathan hesitant- ly entered the store. It was easy to see that he did not want to be there.</page><page sequence="8">The people were happy to meet Jonathan, and they shook his hand, congratulated him on his artistic accomplishment and asked him to interpret the basket's hidden mean- ing. Poor Jonathan gulped, took a deep breath and began. Pointing to the ear of corn he said, "That's us." He then pointed to the white background and said, "That's the dawn." Finally he pointed to the encircling pattern and said, "This is protection." He smiled uneasily and exited the trading post, escaping back to the car and his childcare duties. Everyone looked after him, feeling, I am sure, a little shortchanged. Their inter- est had been sincere and they wondered what had happened. (Barry Simpson 2002) Perhaps what had happened can be explained using Miguel Tamen's notion of the "interpre- table object," one in which "'all kinds of unexpected things' speak" (2001:137). He writes: [T]here is a connection between deferring to an object and ascribing intrinsic prop- erties [or "hidden meanings"] to it. Deferring to objects is a description of certain activities, namely interpretation, that consists in the ascription of intrinsic properties to those objects. These activities I then went on to call "representation." In this sense, therefore, intrinsic properties have been described as a function of representation, not, as is customarily the case, as its antecedent. (140-41) Here, the basket's performative force does not suffice when its maker is available to interpret, and thus create, its intrinsic qualities/"hidden meaning" in performance. Jonathan Black's "author(-izing)" performance would, in turn, reanimate the performative force of the basket for its audience in the manner reminiscent of the process described in Brush and Pencil above. Specifically, what Black was asked to author(-ize), and what the audience may have felt "short- changed" by, involved both the basket itself, in its transformation from object to event, and its intrinsic "Indianness," which offers a "certain degree of power" predicated on visible, per- formative "markers of Indian difference" (Deloria 1998:176). Black's self-evident "Indianness" simultaneously replaced, supplemented, and author(-ized) the story/meaning of the basket as performance; perhaps his discomfort could be read as resistance to a commodity imperative to "perform or else" (McKenzie 2001). Black is, in some respects, the exception that proves the rule. In my experience, Navajo artists usually indulge the audience's desire for the interweaving of story and object in the commodity situation. As Barry Simpson notes, "the manner in which Jonathan teaches us about his art" forces the spectator to engage both the object and the story more directly and specifically, though other artists opt for different authorizing and supplementary performance strategies (2002). As I talked to Betsy Emerson about her fired mud toy horses, for example, she noted that the hair for their manes and tails came from her own animals. "So," she said, "if you're riding around Navajo country and you see a horse with no tail, he's mine" (2002). The idea of the performing object is not in itself new. Indeed, it is prefigured in Marx's theory of commodity fetishism and in Bennett's critique. Elaine Scarry adapts and modi- fies this Marxist framework in support of her argument that "artifacts are (in spite of their inertness) perhaps most accurately perceived as 'a making sentient' of the external world" (1985:281). Scarry posits that the object as "a projection of the human body" (281) is inti- mately linked to subjectification. Further, the projective animation of the object deprives it of "its privilege of being irresponsible to its sentient inhabitants on the basis that it is itself nonsentient" (285). She continues: [W]hen poets or painters perform the same acts of animation [that characterize animist spiritual practice], it is called "pathetic fallacy." But [...] to dismiss this phenomenon as mistake or fallacy is very possibly to miss the important revelation about creation exposed there. The habit of poets and ancient dreamers to project their own aliveness onto nonalive things itself suggests that it is the basic work of creation to bring about 153</page><page sequence="9">c1 a 154 this very projection of aliveness; in other words, while the poet pretends or wishes that the inert external world had his or her own capacity for sentient awareness, civilization works to make this so. What in the poet is recognizable as a fiction is in civilization unrecognizable because it has become true. (286)5 Two examples of performing objects illustrate Scarry's point while illuminating the spe- cific dynamics of the commodity situation of Navajo folk art. The first of these is the stage prop which, as Andrew Sofer suggests, occupies "an uneasy position between text and per- formance" (2003:vi). Props are animated by performance and, in the process, "trace spatial trajectories and create temporal narratives as they track through a given performance" (2). Just as Scarry argues for the object's capacity to animate the external world, Sofer posits that the function of the prop (and, indeed, of the theatre) is "to bring dead images back to life-but with a twist" (3); in a sense, they are part of a larger poesis of "drama's opportunis- tic reworking of its own past" (202). Navajo folk artworks, like stage props, are "object[s] that [go] on a journey" (Sofer 2003:2) across time and space, reworking both a real and imagined past. In this regard, they share some, though not all, of the elements Susan Stewart sees as intrinsic to the souvenir. According to Stewart: We might say that this capacity of objects to serve as traces of authentic experience is, in fact, exemplified by the souvenir. The souvenir distinguishes experiences. We do not need or desire souvenirs of events that are repeatable. Rather, we need and desire sou- venirs of events that are reportable, events whose materiality has escaped us, events that thereby exist only through the invention of narrative. Through narrative the souvenir substitutes a context of perpetual consumption for its context of origin. It represents not the lived experience of its maker but the "secondhand" experience of its possessor/ owner. (1993:135) Like the stage prop, Navajo folk art in/as performance is both repeatable and reportable, particularly for traders and collectors who develop long-standing relationships with artists in particular genres of work, and then narrate accounts of these relationships. For both the prop and the folk art object, materiality cannot be escaped; narratives supplement, author(-ize), and reanimate this materiality, as well as the contexts of production and audience consump- tion. Finally, the prop and the folk art object "live" at the intersection of "original" and "secondhand" (or "twice-behaved" [Schechner 1985:36]) experiences in a mode resembling a repertory. For the folk art object, like the memory aids discussed below, this "rep" element includes an historical dimension (history of the genre or artist), the performance intrinsic to the object itself (as ritual, in the case of memory aids), and the additional narratives that surround and frame it ("authorizing" from the artist, or tales of acquisition as pilgrimage, pedagogy, or "score," told by traders or collectors). All are intrinsic to the specific commod- ity situation. The lifelike "collector doll" offers another example of the animated, "sentient" object whose commodity situation illuminates that of Navajo folk art. According to A. F. Robertson, these dolls are "enclaved," made and traded in their own small worlds, restricted spheres outside of which their meaning is lost: "You have to be quite specifically involved in the pro- duction and consumption of this commodity to know what's going on and to give any sort of value to it" (2004:33). Similarly, the audiences for Navajo folk art and the venues in which it is presented constitute small worlds. Collectors are often familiar with other, more traditional and established forms of southwestern Indian art and turn to folk art because the genre is comprehensible and affordable. A traditional weaving invites a learned and practiced eye and 5. Scarry adds: "It should be registered from the outset that this habit of mind is restricted to neither poetic nor mythological forms of perception" (1985:286).</page><page sequence="10">may command thousands of dollars; a folk art carving is more immediately accessible and cheaper. Yet some knowledge of the genre is essential to the commodity situation, notwithstand- ing the occasional buyer who purchases a piece because it is "cute" or "feels powerful." Mud toys are an excellent example. These figures, produced by a number of artists, each with a distinctive style, are literally molded out of reservation mud, dried (though not generally kiln- fired), and painted. They are often whimsical: Navajo Santas riding chickens or, in the case of Mamie Deschillie's pieces, versions of exotic animals she has never seen that seem whimsical by default. Her rhinoceros, for example, looks like an orange mule. These idiosyncratic representations, the residue (real or imagined) of the artists' hands, and the "rez mud" all contribute to the "enclaving" of mud toys. Without some appreciation of these elements, it is difficult to assess the number of buyers willing to spend between 15 and 50 dollars for small, extremely fragile pieces of hardened earth. Robertson argues that collectors imbue their dolls with life in the manner reminiscent of Scarry's pro- jective theory of animating objects. But more than this, Robertson observes that a performance dimen- sion is central to doll collection and display: Keeping a doll boxed, with her label and price tag still fixed to her wrist, is considered inhumane. We were repeatedly assured that every doll was out on display, that all of them were loved and carefully handled, and that nobody [sic] was hidden away waiting for her dollar value to appreciate. (2004:53) These dolls made claims upon their owners: claims for love and for putative agency of/in display. Indeed, simple display is, as Bennett noted above, one of the theatrical techniques that enables the commodity to assert power over its audience. Relationships between projections onto, and the animation and display of, Navajo folk art objects are more complex, as are the nature of the claims made by these works on the viewer. Further, issues of dis- play lay bare larger workings of cultural continuity and disruption that circulate throughout the genre. Navajo culture has a strict system of representational taboos; this dictates what can and cannot be made, as well as what can and cannot be shown. Folk artists have engaged these taboos from the very beginning of the form. Charlie Willeto, for example, carved "replicas" of Yei-bi-chei dancers, which [he] was advised by chapter elders not to continue to make as yei (misfortune) would follow. This was at a time when the Gallup traders offered an abundance of yei carvings, including entire Figure 4. A colorful wood carving by the late Charlie Willeto, critically acclaimed Navajo artist.

[Charlie's wife] Elizabeth recalls about the early carvings they didn't know what to do with them and didn't let anyone in the community, or even family, see them. (LaChapelle 2002:9) Contemporary carver Lawrence Jacquez was also warned about making realistic impressions of cultural figures by members of the Navajo community. Roger Hathale's caution about memory aids, discussed below, is also relevant here. Representation quickly bleeds into a per- formance/event that has material consequences for the artist and the world, including possible personal or family illness, even death, and disorder and disruption of all sorts. Serious collectors are aware of these taboos and are either drawn to acquire and display objects because of them, or avoid certain imagery altogether. In my conversations with col- lectors, carvings of skin walkers-devil figures that are part man, part wolf-were to be particularly avoided because they were considered extremely negative and demanded respect. Commodity Ventriloquism/Buying the Performance Memory Aids The Rosenaks subtitle their book The People Speak, but I argue that in framing Navajo folk art as commodity-performance, who and what speaks is not always obvious. Specifically, I suggest that commodity performances, in the case of Navajo folk art, are complex acts of ventriloquism where objects enact stories of disruption and continuity created or imagined by all involved in the commodity situation, even if each participant imagines these differently. In the examples discussed above, the artist/performer animates the object in the com- modity situation through story; the residue of this story continues to be ventriloquized through the object across the contexts of trading post and collection. Yet there are two other options for commodity ventriloquism. In the first, the object itself performs a story seem- ingly intrinsic to its own design. In the second, the object performs the projections of its owners in a manner that recalls Seymour Polatkin's observation in Sherman Alexie's film The Business of Fancydancing (2002): "Indians must see visions and white people can have some visions if they are in love with Indians." The following example explores both of these types of ventriloquist performances, as well as issues of continuity and disruption, map and story, as all are concretized in the performance of a particular genre of folk art. The Hathale family, Bruce and Dennis, paint images on old bedsheets dyed the rosy brown or beige hues of desert rocks. The resulting images are themselves "small worlds"; they feature clouds, corn, trolls, mountains, water horses and water oxen, and rainbows- geographies organized into narratives and further organized into images. But these sections of dyed bedsheet do more than represent the world in a nonmonumental format. In a complex interplay of continuity and disruption, these textiles simultaneously create and represent the world in a sacred, mythic map and an accompanying ritual narrative available as, and for, performance. The Hathale brothers are the primary artists working in a genre called "memory aids," a variation on Navajo sandpainting.6 Hataalii is variously translated as "medicine man," "healer," or "singer," or more specifically, means a specialist in multiple genres of ritual performances that treat both individuals and the community (see Bahti 2000:8; Matthews 1994:40; Young and Morgan 1972:95). The late Roger Hathale, Bruce and Dennis's father, used 6. The origin of the term "memory aid" is unclear. Mark Bahti (2000) sees the term as the construction of ethnographers, but it is difficult to find evidence in support of this claim. Whatever its origin, the phrase is widely used by artists, traders, and collectors to suggest, if not directly imply, that images in this category are mnemonics for Navajo rituals, further reinforcing these objects' putative ties to real or imagined performances.</page><page sequence="12">sandpaintings-complex multicolored reproduc- tions of ceremonial motifs-to affect individual and communal cures.7 Mark Bahti writes: Sandpainting images require the careful attention of the hataalii, as a slight error could result in harm rather than a cure. The image itself, which must be started at sunrise and completed by sunset, can cause harm to those present. To prevent this from happen- ing, the image is first "erased" with a wooden stick with prayer feathers attached. In some instances the sand on which the image has been created rests on a tarp in order to facili- tate complete removal of the sand and image. The material is disposed of some distance from any home, trail, or corral. A final prayer is said over the remains, which some say "discharms" the sands. (2000:9) The sandpainting is a performance. It is an action as well as an object. Exact or inexact, its animation has consequences for the performers and for the world. Sandpainting is simultane- ously object, story, performance, and event. The paintings-and not only the performers- "work" in the performance context. Reproductions of sandpaintings have been widely circulated as both tourist art and fine art for decades. The Hathales' paintings on muslin, however, are especially interesting. According to Figure 5. (top) Water Ox and Water Horse, memory aid by Bruce Hathale.

As noted above, Bahti is suspicious of the term "memory aid"; for more on Navajo sandpainting and his view that the memory aid is largely a construction of ethnographers, see Bahti (2000). For my purposes here, I am not concerned with the "authenticity" of the memory aid as a cultural genre. As suggested above, fantasies of authenticity are just as pertinent to the commodity performance of Navajo folk art as are claims of authenticity. 157 157</page><page sequence="13">158 the Rosenaks, the late Roger Hathale suggested to his boys that they reproduce sandpaint- ings. However, the strict taboos on "fixing" these performances, particularly for an audience of outsiders, had to be both managed and disrupted. The Rosenaks quote Roger as saying: I [...] felt [my sons] could reproduce the sandpaintings I made for ceremonies as long as they were accurate. If others did this type of art they would be harmed, but I have the power to protect my boys. The idea was mine, but I have never made one myself. Certain figures would bring harm, but I will not let these be sold. (1998:77) Here it is worth noting the influence of the Rosenaks' book: It both contributed to the creation of, and legitimated as well as codified, the commodity situation for Navajo folk art. Certainly such an authoritative testament to the authenticity of the Hathales' paintings generated heightened interest in and the marketability of this work, particularly on the part of collectors who knew of the cultural taboos around preserving "actual" sandpaintings. For collectors, the vision of vicarious participation in "the real thing" would be inextricably linked to the social life of the memory aid. They could both buy and be in the performance. Yet the Rosenaks' account does not stand alone. James Ostler, owner of the Cow Canyon Trading Post, recalls Roger Hathale offering a different account, one emphasizing disrup- tion of, rather than continuity with, the "authentic" (2002). According to Ostler, Hathale told him that his experience as a medicine man did indeed protect his sons, but it was because of his advice on details that should be altered, with precisely the intention of disrupting authenticity. Because of the intricacies of the form, changes of color or breaks in lines effec- tively neutralize any threat posed by either fixing exact copies of sacred forms or making gravely consequential, though unintended, mistakes.8 The issue here (as in accounts of Robin Wellito's genealogical performances) is not which story is true, but rather how continuity and disruption often embrace one another in the commodity performance that is Navajo folk art. In an essay titled "Why Some Things Matter," Daniel Miller argues, after Georg Simmel, that "human values do not exist other than through their objectification in cultural forms". Further, he notes: "We as academics can strive for understanding and empathy through the study of what people do with objects because that is the way the people we study create a world of practice" (1998:19). Here I go further and suggest that what people do with objects, indeed what objects themselves do, is perform-and they do so in ways that animate both the objects themselves and the praxical networks of relations through which they circulate. In Navajo folk art, these objects/performances assert genealogical and cultural continuity while disrupting taboos; they cut across the maps-real and imagined-of the Southwest, as they move from backroom workshop or kitchen table to trading post to museum or collection. They cut up stories of authenticity and cut in references to popular culture. Finally, these objects/performances create and stabilize small worlds of creativity and commerce replete with history and desire, with "tournaments of value" and the politics of discipline, "diversion, and display" (Appadurai 1986:57). In so doing, these performances remind us of what Bennett has called "the uncanny ability of nonhuman things to act upon us" (2001:127). Epilogue As I noted in "An Answerability of Memory: 'Saving' Khmer Classical Dance," performance often lends itself to hero stories (Hamera 2002). In such accounts, performance offers its 8. James Ostler mentioned that on a visit to his Cow Canyon Trading Post, Roger Hathale noticed a memory aid carved from wood by another folk artist and shook his head disapprovingly, murmuring, "Too close. Too close" (2002). The author wishes to thank Tricia D. Loscher, Heard Museum North Exhibition and Program Director; Barry, Steve, and Georgiana Kennedy Simpson of Twin Rocks Trading Post; Northern Arizona University's Cline Library Special Collections; the late Jim Ostler, Cow Canyon Trading Post; and Robin Wellito for their help with this project.</page><page sequence="14">practitioners real or provisional agency to create or intervene in constructions of identity or to overcome exigencies. Yet it is just as likely to succumb to exhaustion, to deep personal anguish and social dislocation, to the memories it has deployed as both blessing and goad. Performances of/as Navajo folk art are no different. While collecting data for the larger project of which this essay is a part, I received word that Homer Warren had died. A Vietnam veteran, Warren was well known for his horses carved from sandstone, many painted with stars and striped saddle blankets. These horses have the rare and enchanting capacity to appear solid and commanding, and absolutely playful at the same time. Warren also carved figures from day-to-day Navajo life early in his career. He passed his art on to his five children. But he also had a problem with alcohol and fre- quently carved for "beer money." On 19 October 2002, I learned from Steve Simpson's email "Tribute" that Warren had fallen from the back of a pickup truck, hit his head, and died. Performances of/in the commodity situation are suffused with projections and fantasies, needs and wants, with the negotiations native artists undertake to gain a modicum of con- trol over their labor, and those collectors engage to vicariously share that imagined state. Sometimes these performances also include performances of abjection wherein the stories ventriloquized through these animated objects speak-sometimes very softly, sometimes not-of damage and despair.
