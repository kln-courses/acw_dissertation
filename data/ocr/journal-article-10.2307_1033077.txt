<plain_text><page sequence="1">Conservatism and Liberalism in American Protestantism By RENE DE VISME WILLIAMSON ABSTRACT: American Protestantism is diverse and multiform. There is no single voice that can speak officially for it. There are, however, several currents and crosscurrents within and among the Protestant denominations. Some of these are con- servative and others liberal in a theological sense. Numerous differences separate the two, but most of them can be traced back to their position with regard to the Bible, with some modifications introduced by different conceptions of the church. Protestants who are conservative or liberal theologically have a tendency to follow through politically, but there are changes taking place which are breaking down this parallelism. The neo-orthodox movement is conservative theologically but lib- eral politically. The ecumenical movement is neither as yet, but, because it is international and interdenominational and draws support from both conservative and liberal theological camps, it will probably develop its own political orientation.

It is the matrix within which American political thought and institutions were conceived and shaped. Our colonial background, our formative years as a nation, and the greater part of our national history are all stamped with a distinctively Protestant style of thinking and feeling. Protestants today constitute a numerical majority and are potentially a tremend- ous force. There is no understanding of American national character without reference to Protestantism. At the present time, it is fashionable to say that the United States is no longer a Protestant country. The situa- tion in which we find ourselves is most often described as one of religious pluralism. The period since the Civil War has seen an enormous influx of Roman Catholics, and they have multi- plied in numbers until they constitute the largest single church in the United States. Their influence has also in- creased as many of them rose to com- manding positions economically, so- cially, and politically. Another non- Protestant group, the Jews, has likewise seen its members rise to positions of great influence out of proportion to its numbers and concentrated in key urban centers. Finally, there is a large amorphous mass of Americans who are religious illiterates and whose church affiliations are either nonexistent or purely nominal. There is no accepted name for these people, but perhaps "secularist" comes near to identifying them. Their number and influence are such that it has been said that our era is not only post-Protestant but even post-Christian. Their faith, if any, is something called "Americanism," which Will Herberg has called the true religion of America. Their influence is so per- vasive that they have infiltrated some Protestant churches. The problem presented by the domi- nance of secularism nationally is mag- nified to international dimensions be- cause science has made the world one in a sense it never was before, and that world has a large non-Christian majority. Thus, we have become a reli- giously pluralist nation in a religiously pluralist world, and Christianity finds itself once again in the position of a minority religion, as it was in pre- Constantine times. Christendom is, therefore, faced with a major decision: whether to follow the counsels of the secularists, who urge us to accept reli- gious pluralism and solve the problem of interrelationships by a "live and let live" philosophy or some sort of reli- gious syncretism, or to heed the admoni- tion of the apostle Paul not to conform to this world but to transform it by obeying the great commission to carry the Gospel unto the uttermost parts of the earth. In this crisis, American Protestantism is hampered by a problem which is characteristic of our time and which bedevils many sorts of individuals and groups everywhere. I refer to the familiar problem of selfhood which is usually stated in the form of questions such as these: Who am I? What am I? What am I here for? What is the purpose of life and what is my relation to it? For the American Protestant, the question takes this form: What is Protestantism? Protestantism is a term which has many meanings, none of which com- mands universal acceptance and each of which raises serious difficulties. There is a theological meaning according to which anyone is a Protestant who believes in Jesus Christ as Lord and Saviour, in the authority and sufficiency of the Bible as the Word of God, in the universality of the priesthood, and in justification by faith through grace. There are, however, people who call 77</page><page sequence="3">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY themselves Protestants who would reject or modify some of these beliefs and add others which would not find general acceptance. An extreme case is that of Paul Tillich who identifies Protes- tantism with adherence to what he calls "the Protestant principle," which con- sists in having no principle lest we fashion a new idol for ourselves. There is an historical meaning which would identify as Protestants all who belong to churches which originated with the Reformation in the sixteenth century. The historical meaning, how- ever, is rejected by many of those to whom it applies. The Southern Bap- tists, for instance, do not admit to being Protestants, even though their beliefs are Protestant in the theological sense and the Baptist movement did begin in the sixteenth century. They claim that their church is a restoration of the New Testament church, wherein they show themselves to be true Protes- tants, inasmuch as that was one of the avowed aims of all the Reformation churches. Many Episcopalians also dis- sociate themselves from Protestantism because of their insistence on apostolic succession, and some of them consider themselves to be Catholics, albeit non- Roman. Ironically enough, the Epis- copalians form the only church whose official title contains the word "Protes- tant." And then there are groups, like the Mormons, that obviously cannot be fitted into the historical meaning. There remains a sociological meaning which is fixed neither by theology nor by history but by usage. According to the usage now prevalent in the United States, anyone is a Protestant who claims to be a Christian and does not belong to the Roman Catholic church or one of the Eastern churches such as Greek Ortho- dox. This is a very broad and loose con- ception which makes Protestantism a kind of religious grab bag for all Amer- icans who are not Roman Catholics, Eastern Orthodox, Jews, Unitarians, Buddhists, or atheists. This conception is unsatisfactory in many respects and does violence to the preferences-not to say convictions-of many Protestants. Nevertheless, it appears to be so sanc- tioned by usage that I shall adopt it in this article to facilitate communication. Protestantism is notable for its di- versity. It is divided into a small num- ber of great communions-for example, Reformed, Lutheran, Baptist, Anglican -and a large number of small sects- such as Mennonites, Church of God, Nazarenes, Pentecostal groups. Protes- tantism, therefore, cannot speak with a single voice. Moreover, some of the great communions, like the Lutheran and the Reformed, are organized into several denominations, and some, like the Baptists, are based on the principle of congregational sovereignty, so that no official voice is possible. There is yet another factor which contributes to the diversity of Protestantism, namely, the existence of great currents of religious thought and attitudes-such as funda- mentalism-which cut across denomina- tional lines. In an age like the pres- ent, when people often do not know and appreciate their own denomina- tional heritage, there are many Protes- tants for whom these great currents are more important that their church affilia- tion. The dividing line which really counts is theological orientation. The effect is apt to be divisive and even ex- plosive, entailing serious damage to the denomination and the churches which compose it. On the other hand, differ- ences of this kind deserve more respect than the other consequence of the weak- ening of denominational bonds which consists in frequent transfers of mem- bership from one church to another for the purpose of establishing one's social status in the community or of "hearing" a popular preacher. The nearest thing to an official voice 78</page><page sequence="4">CONSERVATISM AND LIBERALISM IN PROTESTANTISM is the National Council of Churches, but even this voice is very imperfect. The Council is not a sovereign body, and its pronouncements are not binding upon the member churches. There are often vigorous dissents within the member churches over some of the Council's pro- nouncements. Furthermore, membership of a few Eastern churches keeps the Council from being purely Protestant, and the nonparticipation of important fundamentalist-oriented churches means that the Council cannot speak for all Protestants. In the absence of an au- thoritative voice such as is possessed by the Roman Catholics, the best one can do is to speak of currents of opinion and thought in Protestanism. In other words, Protestanism speaks with many voices, and these voices do not say the same thing. RELIGIOUS CONSERVATISM Turning now to the subject of con- servatism and liberalism, the first point to be noted is that these terms have two meanings. One is religious and the other is political. The discussion of these terms is complicated by the fact that they are not congruent. The most that one can say is that they have a tendency to be congruent but that they are not by nature necessarily so and that they often do in fact diverge. Religious conservatism is partly a matter of doctrine and partly a matter of ecclesiology (conception of the church and church polity). Doctrinally, con- servatism means adherence to the Bible as the one solid and authoritative source of the Christian faith. The Bible is the Word of God, the Sword of the Spirit, the body of revealed truth which stands as a bright, clear, and unalterable stand- ard for the life and thought of man in the midst of ever-changing fads, phi- losophies, ideologies, national cultures, racial antagonisms, class conflicts, spe- cial interests, and religious dissensions and divisions. In general, the theologi- cal right accepts the historic interpreta- tions of Luther and Calvin, who like- wise took their stand on the Bible. The fundamentalists, all of whom belong to the theological right, tend to interpret scripture solely by scripture and to be distrustful of modern scholarship, gener- ally unfamiliar with the doctrines of the Reformation, and unimpressed by the historic witness of the church through- out the ages. To the fundamentalist, orthodoxy in its etymological sense of correct doctrine is the test of the Chris- tian faith, and his concern for what he regards as the purity of the church causes him to be much more distressed by heresy than by schism. The theo- logical right includes many nonfunda- mentalist Protestants or evangelicals who are acquainted with and subscribe to the great doctrines of the Reformation and whose uncompromising reliance on the Bible nevertheless makes room for the testimony of the church and the findings of modern scholarship. Among these evangelicals, the best known group is probably the neo-orthodox. The ecclesiological conservatives lay their emphasis on the church. To them, the church is not just another voluntary organization but the visible form of the mystical Body of Christ. They have a strong sense of history and an almost Burkean reverence for the church as an institution. They look upon the church as an establishment, a part of the order of the universe instituted by Christ and guided by the Holy Spirit that the Chris- tian might not be left to wander in un- certainty and isolation for the length of his days. Church pronouncements carry a great deal of weight which these con- servatives are loathe to challenge even when they disagree. For them, the greatest sin is not heresy but schism. The Episcopalians, who are usually ec- clesiological conservatives, like to ascribe this strong sense of the church to their 79</page><page sequence="5">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY own Catholic tradition. They may be right insofar as their denomination is concerned, but they are wrong if they mean to suggest that the Catholic tradi- tion has a monopoly in the matter. The same strong sense of the church is to be found among the Lutherans and the Presbyterians, just as it was with Luther and Calvin. Ecclesiological conservatism also has secular sources. The large Protestant de- nominations have developed full-fledged bureaucracies, usually in the form of denominational boards and commissions, and big Protestant congregations have something known as "the Church Staff." These bureaucracies are necessary to carry out programs of evangelism and Christian education, and they contain many admirable spiritually minded peo- ple. Inevitably, however, they develop established ways of doing things, form definite and stable contacts with other bureaucracies, acquire property to man- age and vested interests to defend, and enjoy considerable prestige. These char- acteristics attract organization men, and these people are predisposed to con- servatism. There is a difference between the two groups of ecclesiastical bureau- crats, a difference which might be ex- pressed in this fashion: the spiritually minded fear "splitting the church," and the secularly minded fear "rocking the boat." Both, however, are conservative. RELIGIOUS LIBERALISM Religious liberalism in the United States has been a reaction against con- servatism, particularly the fundamental- ist form of conservatism. As a theologi- cal movement, liberalism espoused the so-called "higher criticism" of the Bible. Laying great emphasis on the findings of history, archaeology, linguistic schol- arship, and comparative religion, the liberals became convinced that the Bible contained historical errors, scientifically untenable conceptions, ethically inde- fensible positions, and theological con- tradictions. Nor could they see any grand design or unifying thread in it. The Bible was only a library or collec- tion of books, the legacy of an alien primitive culture barely comprehensible to the modern mind. In taking this po- sition, the liberals undermined the key- stone of the Reformation, and their only claim to being Protestants was that most of them continued to use the Bible as a source of inspiration and religious truth, provided it was read with the omissions, corrections, revisions, and in- terpretations which they thought were recommended by modern scholarship and compatible with modern culture. Of course, no one can take such a po- sition with regard to the Bible without applying an extra-Biblical standard of some sort. The standards so used have been many, including the Renaissance, the Enlightenment, positivism, and sci- entism. At the present moment, the fa- vorite standard appears to be existen- tialism. Whatever the standard, there is always a common underlying element, namely, the rejection of revelation. God does not reveal Himself: it is man who discovers God. The liberal emphasis was and still is humanistic rather than theistic. These positions and emphases led the liberals to reject or question many of the historic teachings of the church, especially miracles or any other recognition of the supernatural, origi- nal sin, divine grace, the Virgin Birth, and the divinity of Jesus. The liberals also adopted another conception of the church. For them, the church is a vol- untary association of like-minded peo- ple whose raison d'etre is to function as an educational and moral-welfare agency. On the theological plane, therefore, it is difficult to classify religious liberalism as Christian, and it can be classified as Protestant only in the loose sociological sense adopted in this article for pur- 80</page><page sequence="6">CONSERVATISM AND LIBERALISM IN PROTESTANTISM poses of discussion. On the ethical plane, however, the religious liberals have been much more specifically Christian. They sincerely admired the Christian ethic and sought to apply it to life. Reacting against the narrow fundamentalist con- ception which makes the Christian life a code of purely personal conduct devoid of social significance, the liberals pro- pounded what came to be known as the Social Gospel. The thesis of the Social Gospel was that Christ is the Lord of all life and not just of the individual and the home, that no message addressed to the individual will be heard and bear fruit if it ignores the social, economic, political, and cultural forces which play so large and decisive a part in the life of every individual. As a result, religious liberals were found in the forefront of reform movements and vigorously sup- porting many noble causes. As I write about religious liberalism, I find myself using the past tense in spite of all efforts to the contrary. I suspect the reason is that this sort of liberalism is largely a thing of the past and a waning force in the present. It is noticeable that the term "modernism" which was so current in the twenties and thirties to identify theological liberalism has been dropped. Who wants to be called a modernist nowadays? Modern- ism could not survive the thundering voice of Karl Barth and the transition of Reinhold Niebuhr from theological liberalism to neo-orthodoxy. The hol- lowness of theological liberalism stood exposed for all to see, for it lacked the essential quality not only of the Chris- tian religion but of all religion, that is, transcendence, a relationship to a spir- itual power who inspires, corrects, over- rules, enlightens, judges, vivifies, and re- deems in the realms of both history and nature. The result of this exposure was to drive some modernists out of the Christian fold into the quicksands of secularism and to force the others to return to a more conservative theologi- cal position. The phrase "Social Gospel" has like- wise fallen into disuse. The reason is not that its basic position was unsound. Quite the contrary! But the Social Gospel had been made to rest on an untenable theology, and the result was that religious liberalism became the pris- oner of its social programs and its Chris- tian content got lost in social, economic, and political gadgetry. We can still see it today in the way the problem of race relations is treated by some liberals. There is no doubt whatever that racial segregation has no rightful place at all in the Christian church. But this truth does not justify anyone in equating Christianity with integration. A church will certainly not be Christian because of segregation, but it may be Christian in spite of it, and a church could be integrated and still have very little Christianity in it. What is involved here is a matter of depth and perspec- tive which only a truly Christian faith of the conservative variety can supply. POLITICAL OVERTONES OF PROTESTANTISM The rich and diverse forms, currents, and crosscurrents of Protestantism are not without political overtones. In gen- eral, it may be said that religious con- servatives have been politically con- servative as well. There is some differ- ence in degree here between clergy and laity. The latter has been more con- servative politically because its knowl- edge of the Christian faith is usually superficial. Most laymen are ignorant of their denominational heritage, un- schooled in church history, and unversed in theology. There is but little, there- fore, that can protect them from sur- rendering effortlessly to the middle-class outlook which has become character- istic of Protestantism. The tendency to transform the church from a community 81</page><page sequence="7">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY of faith to a status symbol is aptly ex- pressed in the title of a chapter in one of Vance Packard's books, namely: "The Long Road from Pentecostal to Episco- pal." The president of a well-known seminary put it in another way in ap- proximately these words: "Too often the United Presbyterian Church is only the Republican party at prayer." In addition to forces of secular origin, there has been something in conserva- tive theology itself which led to political conservatism. This is particularly true of the fundamentalist movement and truest of all in its premillennial wing. If the Christian faith is to be identified with strict individualism, the result will be hostility, or at least indifference, to- ward all reform movements. Why should the Christian strive for social, racial, or international justice if all he has to do is to wait for the Second Coming of Christ, when justice will be done throughout the whole world? Furthermore, the funda- mentalist insistence on doctrinal tests to the exclusion of all other tests leads di- rectly to heresy-hunting in the church. The transposition to heresy-hunting in politics is easy and almost automatic. Many fundamentalists, therefore, natu- rally gravitate to the extreme right in politics, where they espouse strident na- tionalism and undiscriminating anticom- munism, supplying the movement with eschatological fervor. Religious liberalism, through its So- cial Gospel, has naturally involved it- self in politics and, almost always, lib- eral politics. It has championed civil rights, economic reform, and world peace. These are all good causes, and the existing order, both national and in- ternational, needs the criticism of the enlightened Christian conscience. The liberals adopted a prophetic stance. But they forgot that, to be a prophet, you have to have a word from the Lord. And this they did not have. Their the- ology was inadequate to protect them from obvious mistakes. When they criti- cized the profit motive, they hit the cen- tral nerve of capitalism and, at the same time, weakened their case by basing their criticism on a highly oversimplified un- derstanding of human motivation and nature. Their plea for world peace has likewise been weakened by an unrealistic appraisal of human nature, from which the Christian doctrine of man could have saved them, and by a failure to appreci- ate the demonic forces which are loose in the world-liberals do not believe in demons! Thus, when liberals secure the passage of church pronouncements on disarmament which are "impartially" addressed to both the United States and the Soviet Union, they are not impartial at all but are unintentionally advocat- ing unilateral disarmament, which could only mean the conquest and sovietiza- tion of the United States and, therefore, of the whole world. Peace is far too complex a problem for such simple solu- tions and requires a hardheaded grasp of power politics in the perspective of the interaction between faith and rea- son, commitment and compassion, divine Providence and human will. SOME NEW PERSPECTIVES One of the most promising move- ments in contemporary Protestantism is neo-orthodoxy, for it blends the best in religious conservatism with the best in religious liberalism, and, by blending them, it transforms them both. Its founder is generally acknowledged to be Karl Barth. With his emphasis on God as "wholly Other" and not just a deistic concept or an anthropomorphic cultural projection, and with his emphasis on the supremacy and sufficiency of the Bibli- cal message independent of human philo- sophical systems, Barth shattered the fragile edifice of modernist theology and brought Protestantism back to its au- thentic source. Protestantism was once 82</page><page sequence="8">CONSERVATISM AND LIBERALISM IN PROTESTANTISM more evangelical. For rendering this service, Barth deserves everlasting credit. But there were two gaps in the Barthian message. One was the failure to pro- vide a proper place for the findings of modern scholarship and for the heritage of Christian thought from Augustine to the present. The other was the failure to provide a social message that would be relevant to our situation and yet true to the authentic evangelical faith. Sev- eral theologians contributed to this task, and none worked at it more successfully and brilliantly than Reinhold Niebuhr. The result was neo-orthodoxy. On the first gap, neo-orthodoxy liber- ated conservative Protestantism from its anti-intellectual bias. Neo-orthodoxy recognized that finding fault with the Bible is not an inseparable part of schol- arship. The Christian God is God-in- History, which means that He spoke through the prism of the personalities and cultures of those who wrote the Bible. It is quite true that the message transcends both the understanding and the cultural context of the Biblical writers, but the fact is that God spoke through them and, therefore, anything which sheds light on the context sheds light on the content as well. The ques- tion is not what we would like the Bible to mean but what the Bible does mean, and, for this task, the utmost intellec- tual honesty and the whole panoply of scholarly techniques are essential. Be- cause the Christian God is God-in- History, neo-orthodoxy rediscovered the church and rejected the flat unhistori- cal view of the fundamentalists and the utilitarian view of the liberals. The Protestant could recite the Apostles' Creed once again with complete sincer- ity and say: "I believe in the Holy Catholic Church." This meant that the entire legacy of Christian thought from the old church fathers to the present was available and relevant. On the second gap, neo-orthodoxy has yet a long way to go. Barth himself had no social message, and it took the monstrous challenge of Hitler to propel him into political protest. Since then, he has relapsed into his old neutralism and has refused to come to grips with the Communist challenge. Reinhold Nie- buhr comes closest to remedying the situation, and his The Nature and Destiny of Man remains the best and most comprehensive exploration of the issues involved. In general, however, it is already clear that neo-orthodoxy is liberal in its social and political orienta- tion, albeit its liberalism is subordinate to the Christian faith and has learned much from the excessive optimism and oversimplifications of the past. In this fusion of theological conservatism and political liberalism lies the hope of the world, for it recognizes that the Chris- tian faith is involved in everything and independent of everything, relevant to all movements and the prisoner of none, a front for neither the status quo nor utopia, a redeeming power that is liber- ating because it transforms personal and institutional identity without abolishing or smothering it. Another very promising movement in contemporary Protestantism is the ecu- menical movement whose chief institu- tional expression, for the time being, at any rate, is the World Council of Churches. It is essentially the redis- covery of the common life and faith of all Christians everywhere. The effect is to break down or circumvent the bar- riers which have shackled Protestants into isolation. Protestantism has been denomination-bound. The ecumenical movement, rightly understood, does not ask for the sacrifice of any denomina- tional heritage but demands that each should appreciate the common Christian core in the others and that all should look upon their differences as a variant of that common Christian core-if we were all the same, what could we pos- 83</page><page sequence="9">THE ANNALS OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY sibly contribute to each other? Protes- tantism has been nationalistic and con- fined to national boundaries. The ecu- menical movement is forming new ties and channels across national boundaries. Protestantism has been exclusively West- ern. The ecumenical movement is chang- ing this through the participation of the so-called "young churches" in Asia and Africa. Not all is well, of course, with the ecumenical movement. There are those who confuse the promptings of the Holy Spirit with the "urge to merge," who think that ecumenicism can be measured by the number of peo- ple they are acquainted with on five continents, and who believe that the household of faith consists in the multi- plication of interdenominational, inter- racial, and international "buzz groups." These people have been dubbed "ecu- maniacs," but the ecumenical movement is far bigger than they are and will even- tually have far-reaching political as well as religious repercussions, especially in foreign policy and international rela- tions. Protestantism may be confusing and diverse, but it is also creative and dy- namic, and it is getting ready to make an invaluable contribution to the excit- ing and critical times in which we live. And, in this age of science and tech- nology, Protestantism's contribution will be in the realm where we need it most: the realm of the mind and of the spirit.1 1 Publications useful to the casual reader representative of the movements treated in this article are: Christianity Today, conserva- tive theologically and politically; The Chris- tian Century, liberal theologically and politi- cally; Christianity and Crisis, conservative theologically and liberal politically.</page></plain_text>
