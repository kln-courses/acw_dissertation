<plain_text><page sequence="1">JOANNA WILLIAMS the Eponymous Elephant of Elephanta E LEPHANTA MAY NOT SEEM in need of atten- tion as much as other parts of South Asian art at the moment. This is precisely why the topic constitutes an appropriate tribute to Walter Spink, who is responsible for this happy situation. When I entered the field, the exact date of the great Siva cave at Elephanta was an unsettled question, but it was thought to be "somewhat late," following com- parable caves at Ellora, and "not exceptional archi- tecturally."' Beginning in 1967, Professor Spink hewed away at the received ideas, arguing that the Elephanta grew directly out of earlier excavations at Ajanta andJogesvari, constituted a precedent for the Dhumar Lena at Ellora, and could reasonably be placed in the mid-sixth century under Kalacuri rule.2 Meeting strong resistance from elders in the field, Spink gradually convinced many scholars. More sig- nificant even than the correctness of his dating or its acceptance is the fact that it has opened the way to wider approaches to an important monument. The cave's plan can now be seen as complex rather than confused; its iconography can be seen as orches- trated; and planners and carvers can be seen as work- ing in concert. Chronology matters in enabling us to see the significance of the great cave in relation to its actual precedents and not dwarfed by the consider- ably later and different Kailasanatha at Ellora. The present essay claims no such lofty contri- bution. It represents a footnote to the work of Walter Spink and his successors. A life-size image of an el- ephant once stood on the docks of the island in the Bombay harbor, leading to the Portuguese name for the island.3 In 1814 its front portion broke off, and in 1912 it was reassembled in the Victoria Zoologi- cal Gardens on the mainland. There the story is usu- ally left, a curiosity that originally stood half a mile from the cave, capturing the attention of early visi- tors and inviting an orientalizing gaze as if it really belonged in a zoo. Questions remain. Did it have any relationship to the cave? What was the original in- tent in carving it? In fact, these queries may be ex- tended to other monolithic images of elephants. If we turn from a front view of our image (fig. 1) to the Ardhanarisvara panel of the great cave (fig. 4), where Indra hovers on his elephant, it may seem un- likely that they were carved at the same time. Indra's vehicle charges majestically with delicate articulation of its lower leg, its ear and trunk bend gracefully, and the musculature of the head is shown with sensitiv- ity, including an almost anthropomorphic eyebrow ridge.4 Perhaps the head of the freestanding image is too damaged for facial comparison. The legs are clearly posts. The sole indication of fleshy mass is a schematic ridge behind the front legs (figs. 2 and 3). The body is tubular and elongated. Could this have been the work of the same carvers who gave us the subtle forms of the great cave? I SHALL GO ON to argue that in other unrelated sites the same differences can be found between a freestanding pachyderm and arguably contem- porary reliefs that depict with loving detail the ani- mal as it moves naturally. For example, in Orissa the animal that emerges from a matrix of rock at Dhauli shows a selective sense of observation (fig. 5). While the skull and ears quiver with life, legs and trunk are unnaturally stumpy. There is more inconsistency here than in the smaller images on A?okan capitals.5 Ars Orientalis, supplement 1 (2000)</page><page sequence="2">JOANNA WILLIAMS a!__~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~'i .,&lt;o..'.._ -N~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~...'.... ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ I~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~; .~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~i~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~... r 1 FIG. 1 FIG.2 FIG. 2 FIG. 3 FIGS. 1-3.

I shall argue that this is less a matter of technical advance or increase in representational skill than of altered meaning. At Mamallapuram in the seventh century, el- ephants are a prominent subject, both freestanding and in relief (figs. 8, 9). As at Elephanta, they share subtle cranial modeling but differ in the treatment of the legs. The precise way in which the top outer cor- ner of the ear folds over might suggest that they are the product of a single workshop of carvers; yet the ears in relief hug the body, while those of the image in the round flare out at right angles, made possible by the sturdiness of granite and increasing the awe- some impact of the animal. In the latter alone, the feet are schematic and the legs tubular, with three perfunctory semicircles indicating wrinkled skin. Chisel marks remain on the feet as on the matrix of stone, betokening incompletion. And in the mid-eighth century at Rastrakiuta Ellora a similar distinction is visible. The freestand- ing elephants that flank the Kailasanatha stand more stiffly than those lined up beneath the great temple. FIG. 10.

The difference is accentuated by the loss of the ears, which appear in figure 10 to have been fitted into sockets as separate pieces of stone, presumably flar- ing to the side energetically. Yet from no side does this animal in the round show the undulating curves and varied detail visible even in the stable support- ing row shown in figure 1 1 (or in the flanks of those who turn to fight lions that adjoin the key relief of Ravana Shaking Mt. Kailasa). One major factor in all these images is surely the working methods of the sculptors. Rock-cut forms must perforce be cut from the periphery inward; simple inertia would explain the fact that the matrix between the legs is attended to last. As Walter Spink has noted, in caves work from the top down is nor- mal. Surely the characteristic head of the elephant would be undertaken early on by the master carver. The fact that this was removed at Elephanta (and Udayagiri and Ellora) is a sign of the resources de- voted to the project of carving and of the assurance of the sculptors. Apprentices might work on the lower elements, as directed by the master (fig. 12). In huge 55</page><page sequence="6">JOANNA WILLIAMS images, the number of carvers is surely multiplied, and the master may have devoted himself to the head, now damaged in the case of Elephanta. If the original mass was a living boulder, a mistake might understandably occur in the length of the body of the animal being created by several artisans working simultaneously. Breakage of ears, trunk, or the entire head in the case of Elephanta, indicates the unfamiliarity of many of these undertakings, in which the designer was tak- ing unusual risks. At the same time, these various examples obvi- ously have diverse roles and meanings related to their visual presence. At Ellora, the two positions lend themselves to different interpretations. The row vis- ible in figure 11 constitutes a particularly vivid case of the supportive role of elephants and other animals, holding up the mountainlike templejust as they sup- port the universe. Hence the unsettling nature of the portion where they charge against lions, threatening the stability of world order, as does Ravana in the adjoining image. The symmetrical, larger freestand- ing pair would seem to guard the temple (fig. 10). They also evoke the living elephants that still inhabit the choultries of south Indian temples, used in pro- cessions when the utsava murtis travel outside. Thus the perfunctory form of the freestanding animals is appropriate to their formulaic function, whereas what one might expect to be a formula of support is viv- idly rendered as part of the dramatic conceit of this unique shrine. At Mamallapuram, the Great Relief has inspired a rich welter of narrative interpretations in which the elephants participate.7 The three-dimensional animal in figure 9 is single and not one of a pair of guard- ians. Its meaning has entered into discussions of the iconography of the nearby Arjuna ratha, be that a shrine to Indra, Murugan, or Aiyandr-S`std, as Su- san Huntington convincingly argues.8 Its meaning was surely enriched by a characteristic Pallava visual pun on the elephant-back (gaja-prstha) form of the Nakula-Sahadeva ratha immediately to the west. At Udayagiri, the contrast between the implica- tions of guardians (fig. 5) and lively animals in narra- tive reliefs is straightforward. Possibly the war el- ephants of Konarak confound these categories. They guard massively, as do horses and lions. Yet the el- ephants and horses are in greater movement than the heraldic, schematic lions. Each animal has its repre- sentational character, in part a function of familiarity and traditions of carving, but contributing to a dif- ferent impact and meaning. The significance of the Dhauli Elephant has never been explained to my satisfaction. The word seto (=Sveto), or "the white one," occurs at the end of the Sixth Rock Edict inscribed on the scarp below the image, and this has been interpreted as referring to Maya's dream of a white elephant and hence to the Buddha.9 A combination of political and religious meaning is also plausible in the Maurya context. But why the very deliberate engagement of the animal in a cloud of uncarved rock of the hill? I once put this question to sculptors in a village in southern Orissa, and one old man with twinkling eyes said to me, "Well, elephants and hills are alike: they both had wings that were cut off, so they fell to earth." The great elephantological text springs to mind, the Matanigalila by Nilakantha. This describes the event: Formerly elephants could go anywhere they pleased, and assume any shape; they roamed as they liked in the sky and on the earth. In the northern quarter of the Himalaya Mountain there is a banyan tree which has a length and breadth of two hundred leagues. On it the excellent el- ephants alighted (after flying through the air). They broke off a branch (which fell) upon a hermitage place, where dwelt a hermit named Dirghatapas. He was angered by this and straightway cursed the elephants. Hence, you see, the elephants were deprived of the power of moving at will, and came to be vehicles for even mortal men. The elephants of the quarters, how- ever, were not cursed.'0 Heinrich Zimmer, who had translated this text into German two years before the version of Franklin Edgerton quoted here, saw a connection with the myth that mountains once flew." Thus in the Ramayana, Mainaka tells Hanuman, 56</page><page sequence="7">THE EPONYMOUS ELEPHANT OF ELEPHANTA Long ago, my son, when the great mountains had wings, they ranged at will over the earth, causing obstruction everywhere. When the great god Indra, chastiser of Paka, heard about the mountains' behaviour, he cut off their wings by the thousand with his thunder- bolt.'2 Such free association of ideas characterized Zimmer's Geistgeschichte and struck the more positivist Edgerton as fanciful."3 The rural Orissan sculptor apparently took this same flight of fancy. I am led to wonder whether the comparison may not, along with simple visual resemblance, have encouraged many a carver, particularly those who began with rounded natural rocks, to envision elephants. I am not sug- gesting that they had read the seemingly obscure Matafigalilii but that it, like the Rama-yana, pre- served lore of broad folkloric currency. R-| ETURNING TO ELEPHANTA,arewetoimag- ine this rationale for the elephant by the docks? If that were one of a symmetrical pair, its primary function would seem to be a guardian, as at the Kailasanatha, Konarak, and Udayagiri. If alone like the monolith at Mamallapuram, identification with Sasta, Murugan, or Indra is less likely here. In either case, for the designers of the majestic cave, an added visual play upon the resemblance between rock and elephant rooted in the ground would en- rich the meaning in a way that complements the great images there. Obviously this common winged origin did not lead to the carving of elephants alone, as op- posed to lions, horses, boars, or serpents out of boul- ders. Each of these had its religious role, as did the elephant generally. But the commonality of elephant and mountain deprived of wings might well have enriched other interpretations, particularly for the carver whose occupation encouraged a respect for boulders. As Walter Spink's work on Ajanta has of- ten made clear, the ingenuity and intellect of the arti- san deserve credit. E Notes 1. Sherman E.

On the Sankisa elephant, details such as wrinkles on ankles and under the neck are schematic, yet the contours of the body curve with vitality. Cf. J.

On the abacus of the Sarnath lion capital, the elephant lumbers in movement, the slender trunk twisting to reveal creased skin on its inner side. 6. Debala Mitra notes that the detached elephants were probably added when the interior of the first-century C.E. cave was altered, and she cites an eighth- or ninth-century inscription near the added interior Gane?a (Udayagiriand Khandagiri [New Delhi: Archaeo- logical Survey of India, 1975], 39-43). Her plates give a good sense of the vividly cavorting elephants in the early reliefs. 7.
