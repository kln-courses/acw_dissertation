Introduction Amongst the objects of the little known Copper Hoard culture, anthropomorphs stand out for their human-like shapes. Scholars are not yet unamimous whether anthropomorphs are symbolic/ magic / ritual objects,1 such as Srivasta,2 Sanidev ,3 Vajra ,4 Indra,5 Marut6 or multipurpose cutting and hammering7 or hurling weapons,8 let alone the ongoing debate about their authorship.9 Distribution: Anthropomorphs are sporadically found and about a hundred of them have been so far reported from the Ganga- Yamuna Doab region and particularly from the upper Ganga Valley. The sites which have yielded anthropomorphs are situated between Ambala and Moradabad on one hand and Kanpur on the other.10 The largest hoard of anthropomorphs so far reported is from Madarpur (Tehsil Thakurdwara) in district Moradabad.11 It comprised 31 almost complete anthropomorphs. Two larger hoards were found from Pithoragarh district of Uttarakhànd Bankot (Tehsil Berinag), one of bight anthropomorphs were found while digging a stone quarry near Bankot Inter College12 and five anthropomorphs were discovered inside ajar from Khuna Tok in the village Naini-Patal.13 Typo- technology: Yule has classified anthropomorphs into four (I-IV) types using the attributes of size, weight and shape. The types I, III and IV are smaller in size than the type II anthropomorphs and do not have thick head.14 The length range and average weight of the former (types I, III and IV) are respectively 23.2 to 24.1 cm and 1260 gm and that of latter (type II) is 30.2 to 47 cm and 4500 gm in the same order; the maximum recorded weight is 6 kg. However, the length of the Madarpur specimens ranges from 14.5 to 26.8 cm; 20 out of 31 being less than 20 cm in length. Joshi has classified the anthropomorphs into seven (I- VII) groups relating them to their developmental stages.15 However, his last three groups do not seem to be complying with the evolution theory he tries to formulate. Many of the anthropomorphs are cut out of a copper sheet and some are cast in moulds. The head is made thick by beating and the outer edges of incurved arms are sharpened. Thus the cross-section of arms becomes almost triangular. The only exceptions encountered are</page><page sequence="2">1064 IHC: Proceedings , 69th Session, 2008 in the hoards of Madarpur, in which two specimens are found with one hand up and one hand down.16 The legs of anthropomorphs are either elongated or dwarf types and some of them are also sharpened. Another important feature of these objects is the chisel marks or slanting hammering marks on both sides. The metallurgical study of a Madarpur anthropomorph has revealed that it was cast without any further working operations. It was made out of almost pure copper (Cu) with minor impurities of carbon (C) and tin (Sb). The hardness of the metal was in the range of 65 to 80 kg/ mm2. The presence of sulphides (copper, lead and sulphur) has been related to the copper extraction process.17 II. Anthropomorphs of Fatehganj Fatehganj (east) is situated in the Bareilly district of Uttar Pradesh. The village is located on the bank of river Bahgul on the border of districts Bareilly and Shahjahanpur (see Map-1). The objects were found together (one above the other) by a villager and subsequently sold to a kabadiwala (rag collector). Later these were picked up by Col. Rajiv Rawat (an antique collector and one of the present authors). After being informed by Col. Rawat, the first author examined the objects and noted their uniqueness as given below. Now the objects have been shifted to the Panchala Museum of M.J. P. Rohilkhand University, Bareilly. Morphology and Technology: Anthropomorph I: It is 17 cm in height at the median axis of the body and weighs 1240 gm. The head is large, semicircular and thick. Its height is about 1/3 of the body height and width at the shoulder is 10 cm. The thickness of the head is 1.2 cm at the centre and 0.7 cm at the edge, which however varies at places (less than 0.7 cm). The edge is uneven. Deep hammer marks are clearly visible on the head. The impact of hammering was so much that the anthropomorph has bent down at the middle. Hammering is done only on one side. The anthropomorph is neck-less. Emanating from the base of head, the arms rise up slightly before descending down and curving in, forming arcs of 16 cm diameters. The arms are conspicuously very long (3 1 .5 cm) and extend about 4 cm below the legs almost surrounding the entire body from two sides. The width of the arms at the shoulder is about 3.5 cm that gently reduces down to 1.5 and 1 cm at places. Thickness of the arms at the shoulder is about 0.7 cm, which reduces gradually towards the palms. The inner edges of arms are slightly thicker (0.3 cm) than that of outer edges (0.2 cm). The left arm is broken from</page><page sequence="3">Archaeology 1065 the middle into two pieces. Hammer marks can be seen on both the arms and indentations have been formed on the inner edges. Unlike the anthropomorphs so far found in India, the present types have wide, oval palms, which are razor sharp at the tips. The left palm is 6.5 cm long and 3 cm wide and those of right palm are 6 cm and 3.4 cm respectively. The width of the body is 7.7 cm and has a more or less straight profile. The width expands to 10.3 cm at the base to form the legs. The legs are extension of the base. These are like fishtails; very short, narrow and sharp at the tips. The tips are partially broken. The base is concave in shape and thicker in the middle.

The thickness is 0.7 cm at the top and increases to 1 .2 cm at the centre of the head, then gradually decreases downwards and becomes 0.35 cm at the base. The ratio of maximum body width and median length is 1:1.7. Anthropomorph II: The second specimen is identical in features but the dimensions differ slightly as provided in the table. The head is semicircular and wider at the base. Unlike the former with more or less straight body, the latter has a constricted body. It has a wider and thick upper part and narrower lower part. It is slightly shorter in height and less in weight than the former. Its hands are broken but all the pieces are present. The left hand is broken in the middle into two pieces and is conspicuously smaller in length; the palm is also small and narrow. The legs are short, narrow, pointed and sharp at the tips and are like fishtails. The base is concave and blunt in the middle. The thickness of the specimen is more in the median axis of the body. It is about 0.35 cm at the top edge and 1 cm at the centre of the head, which is the thickest part of the object. The thickness gradually reduces down towards the chest (0.8 cm), waist (0.4 cm) and base (0.2 cm). The ratio of maximum body width and median length is 1.15: 1.65.</page><page sequence="4">1066 IHC: Proceedings, 69th Session, 2008 Map 1 X l; HU^UR/ ^ I k D A B A D ' ^ - &gt; / : ^ c, i' v~ 1 A' ),- / o &lt;*•***# i' '? !

These anthropomorphs do not possess chisel marks; however, deep hammer marks are noted instead on the upper surfaces. The marks are irregular in shapes and sizes. Both the anthropomorphs were found stacked one above other and may have been manufactured by the same artisan. Barring the long arms with oval palms, the head, trunk and base including the legs of the Fatehganj anthropomorphs are identical with those of Madarpur. However, the latter specimens are very thin in cross-section. These two unique specimens (anthropomorphs) from Fatehganj (east) mark a special place in the Indian Copper Hoards. If we assume the development of anthropomorphs has been from the axes (axes=&gt; lugged axes =&gt; anthropomorphs), the above specimens will stand in the end of one side, i.e., regarding the development of arms. The site also adds a new place on the map that falls further east of Moradabad on the border of Bareilly and Shahjahanpur on the bank of River Bahgul, a major tributary of River Ramganga. In fact, majority of the anthropomorphs are found in the region between Rivers Ganga and Ramganga than the Ganga- Yamuna Doab. With the present finds, Fatehganj (east) becomes the easternmost site yielding anthropomorphs in the upper Ganga valley. The results of scientific analysis of the objects are awaited which will shed more light on the technology of manufacture, composition and actual provenance of the specimens. NOTES AND REFERENCES 1.
