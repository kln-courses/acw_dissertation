<plain_text><page sequence="1">An Orthodox Modernist with a Modern View of Truth Ronald Burke Baron Friedrich von Hiigel (1852-1925) has often been classified as a Roman Catholic "Modernist." As Bernard Reardon has pointed out, this term has a number of different references in various disciplines.' Even within Roman Catholic theology itself the reference of Modernist is somewhat ambiguous. But when Baron von Hiigel is called a Modernist, his theology is being judged a part of the "system" of modern thinking outlined and condemned by Vatican decrees between 1907 and 1910. This paper proposes that such a classification is substantially inaccurate and theologically misleading. Although it is clear today that the Modernist movement was not unified enough to be called properly a "system," the Vatican decrees did condemn a number of particular ideas and persons under the single label of Modernism. These decrees never explicitly condemned von Hiigel or any of his writings. But he was described by contemporaries and colleagues as extremely impor- tant and influential in the Modernist movement. He was referred to as "the lay bishop of Modernism,"2 and not simply as one of its leaders but as its "archleader."3 If von Hiigel was so designated by the people who were most intimately familiar with his thinking, what basis is there for the proposal that it is specious to classify him as a Modernist? The proposal of this paper is not to establish conclusively that there is absolutely no basis for calling von Hiigel a Modernist. Rather, it is to pin- point a supposition of modern thought which led many Modernists to an heretical view of revelation. It points out that it was this view of revelation which was prominently and stringently condemned by the Vatican. And it 1 Bernard Reardon, Roman Catholic Modernism (Stanford, Calif.: Stanford University Press, 1970), pp. 9-16. On the same point, see Roger Aubert, "Modernism," in Sacramentum Mundi, ed. K.

Vidler in The Modernist Movement in the Roman Church (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1934), p. 204. 124</page><page sequence="2">An Orthodox Modernist shows that even though von Hiigel shared this common supposition of mod- ern thought it did not lead him to the heretically Modernist view of revela- tion. To the contrary, von Hiigel's notion of revelation was consistent with the primary currents of the Catholic tradition and was an orthodox reforma- tion of the notion of God's gift of himself to humankind. The point to be made, then, is primarily historical. And yet these consider- ations have some importance for doing Catholic theology today. For the Modernist supposition which von Hiigel held was the notion of the historical dependency of all human knowledge. That notion remains a part of contem- porary thinking. And the question remains today as to how such dependency can be allowed for all knowledge in a way that does not radically jeopardize Christian claims to the truth-value of revelation. Von Hiigel's theology is an instance of an effort to resolve this question. To outline von Hiigel's theology of revelation and show the sense in which he was not a Modernist, I will first review the debate on that topic. Second, I will summarize the Modernist position regarding revelation, the position condemned by Rome as heretical. Third, I will present von Hiigel's position on the character and value of revelation. Finally, I will evaluate the ortho- doxy of von Hiigel's understanding of revelation and the propriety of classify- ing his as a Modernist. THE DEBATE REGARDING VON HOGEL AS A MODERNIST Ever since the time that von Hiigel was not individually censured as a Mod- ernist by Rome's decrees, there have been disputes regarding the degree to which he was a Modernist. In his Norrison Prize Essay of 1933, entitled The Modernist Movement in the Roman Church, Alec Vidler felt von Hiigel required only brief reference. Vidler did affirm that von Hiigel "made it his business to encourage the special work of each [Modernist], to introduce them to the work of each other, to criticize where he detected timidity or superficiality, to suggest fresh lines of thought and wider ranges of study."4 But Vidler also explained that von Hiigel's "major writings . . were mainly concerned with subjects that were not directly involved in the modernist controversy."5 And Vidler claimed that after the beginning of Rome's condemnations, in 1907, von Hiigel gave less emphasis to his earlier Modernist concerns for academic freedom and historical-scientific research in theology.6 Vidler was correct in discounting the immediate relevance of von Hiigel's major works to questions crucial to Modernism.7 But he discounted too much 4 Vidler, p. 206. 5 Ibid., p. 204. 6 Ibid. 7 Von Hiigel's major work was The Mystical Element of Religion as Studied in Saint Catherine of Genoa and Her Friends, 2 vols. (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Co., 1908). This work had no direct relation 125</page><page sequence="3">The Journal of Religion the fact that in numerous important letters and essays von Hiigel dealt direct- ly with issues at the heart of the Modernist controversy And even if Vidler's claim were true that von Hiigel changed his position regarding Modernist concerns after 1907 (and some scholars would challenge that claim), the change does not explain why the Baron, "the arch-leader of Modernism," was not immediately condemned. Maude Petre, a friend of von Hiigel's and another scholar of Modernism (who was herself refused the sacraments because of her Modernist leanings), protested Vidler's scant treatment of von Hiigel. She felt that von Hiigel had played an extremely important role in the movement.8 And she seems to have convinced Vidler of her position, for in a later work, published in 1970, he referred to her objection and admitted the brief treatment of von Hiigel had been a "gap" in his earlier work. In fact, Vidler now called von Hiigel "the chief engineer of the modernist movement"(!).9 By 1970, then, Vidler allowed that some of von Hiigel's writings did per- tain significantly to Modernist concerns. And with that admission he had a less meaningful explanation of why von Hiigel ever escaped the deprecatory label of Modernist. Vidler continued to claim that von Hiigel had changed his position and become less of a Modernist, but even on this point he reeval- uated the date of the change and now proposed that in 1909 (rather than 1907) von Hiigel "got cold feet." He claimed the occasion of the change was the death and funeral of von Hiigel's Modernist friend, George Tyrrell.'o The change in date, however, as well as the admission of topics pertinent to Mod- ernism in von Hiigel's writings, begs even further the question of why von Hiigel was not immediately condemned. At least one recent scholar of von Hiigel and Modernism has agreed with Vidler's earlier position. J. J. Heaney has proposed that von Hiigel's major writings only put him "more or less on the margin of Modernism."" And to any of the issues at question in the Modernist controversy. There was little more relevance to Modernism in von Hiigel's second longest work, Eternal Life: A Study of Its Implications and Applica- tions (Edinburgh: T. &amp; T. Clark), 1912. 8 Maude Petre, Von Hdgel and Tyrrell (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1937), pp. 7-9. Petre asks the rhetorical question: "If von Hiigel did not have part in it [Modernism], who did?" (p. 9). 9 Alec R. Vidler, A Variety of Catholic Modernists (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1970), pp. 110-13. 10 Ibid., pp. 113-26, esp. 125. 11 Heaney made this proposal in his article, "Modernism," in The Catholic Encyclopedia (Wash- ington, D.C.: Catholic University of America Press, 1967), 9:994b. Heaney's agreement with Vidler's early position on this point may have been preliminary and subject to revision. Later changes in Heaney's judgment on broader questions concerning Modernism and/or orthodoxy were reflected in the 1974 Supplement to the Encyclopedia. In 1967 he had agreed with Vatican encyclicals that Modernism was "the application of naturalistic evolutionary philosophy and arbitrary historical criticism . . . to Catholic doctrine." He had claimed the outcome of the controversy was "a victory which preserved the essential life of the Church." In 1974 he was more open to the historical ambiguities of the controversy, proposing that the encyclicals were "theoretical constructs" and that the "short-term gains" from condemning Modernism resulted 126</page><page sequence="4">An Orthodox Modernist Heaney has also agreed that there was a significant change between the earlier and the later von Hiigel.'2 The greater part of recent scholarship, however, has not been satisfied with the claims of the marginal character of von Hiigel's involvement in Modern- ism and of his change in position. Bernard Reardon, for example, has argued that von Hiigel escaped Roman censure not so much because of what he did or did not write but because of "his rank and social influence and . . . the fact he was a layman."'" According to this argument, the reason for von Hii- gel's official escape from the label of Modernist was not theological but politi- cal. Yet Maude Petre was also a layperson, also of a notable Roman Catholic family in Anglican England, and was nonetheless denied the sacraments in her home diocese. Hence Reardon's political explanation seems at best some- what incomplete. Lawrence Barmann's monograph on von Hiigel has made quite specific and detailed the fact that von Hiigel's writings were very much involved in the Modernist controversy.'4 And Barmann's investigation also has argued that von Hiigel was "consistent to the end" in his position, not changing it in the face of condemnations as Vidler and Heaney had maintained. Yet Barmann's work is more historical than theological and does not directly deal with the question of whether or not von Hiigel's writings ought to be de- scribed as those of a Modernist. The work has simply noted, on the one hand, that von Hiigel was "the rallying point for modernist thinkers and their activities in western Europe." Von Hiigel's freedom from censure was aided, on the other hand, by the "distinctive diplomacy" with which the Baron wrote and by his continuing respect for the "supernatural depth in the insti- tutional Church."'5 Barmann's excellent study, like the others which have been mentioned and many more, has made important contributions to understanding Baron von Hiigel and the Modernist movement. But before evaluating the question fur- ther, it is important to note a way in which von Hiigel himself might be seen to explain his own escape from Roman censure. In his own explanation, von Hiigel distinguished between modernism and Modernism.'6 in "long-term losses" (Supplement, pp. 299-300). 12 See Heaney's "The Enigma of the Later von Hiigel," HeythropJournal 6, no. 2 (April 1965): 145-59 (see also his book, The Modernist Crisis: von Hiigel [Washington, D.C.: Corpus Books, 1968]). 13 Roman Catholic Modernism, p. 51. 14 Lawrence F.

It appears 127</page><page sequence="5">The Journal of Religion Von Hiigel admitted proudly that he was a modernist. He defined such lower case modernism as an appreciation of contemporary perspectives upon reality and history. Such an appreciation, he felt, was always essential to the life of the church and its ability to preach meaningfully Christian faith to the contemporary world. Von Hiigel's kind of modernism, then consisted in the "permanent, never quite finished, always sooner or later, more or less, rebe- ginning set of attempts to express and interpret the Old Faith and its perma- nent truth and helps according to what appears best and most abiding in the philosophy and scholarship and science of later and latest times.""7 The Baron von Hiigel saw this sort of modernism, with its balanced appre- ciation of Old Faith and present philosophy, to be invaluable. Against it he sharply contrasted the uppercase Modernism which had been condemned. The latter kind of Modernism had, von Hiigel admitted, led many persons toward skeptical agnosticism. The latter kind of Modernism had been a "con- glomerate of good, bad, indifferent or variously mixed . . . expressions and interpretations of the Faith." It had justly been condemned, he felt, because it had become alienated from much of "the positive content that had been (originally) fought for."'8 In von Hiigel's view, then, modernism was the appreciation of contempo- rary philosophies; Modernism was their deification. Von Hiigel felt that he had been a faithful Catholic modernist, neither early nor lately a Modernist. But he also lamented that the writings of many close friends, men like apolo- gist George Tyrrell and biblical critic Alfred Loisy, had passed over into the excesses of Modernism. Was or was not von Hiigel himself a Modernist? Further work must be done to resolve the question definitively.Vidler's early position that von Hii- gel was not integrally involved in Modernism cannot be maintained. His claim that von Hiigel changed his position is weak and contested. The pro- posals that von Hiigel escaped censure because of political reasons and his own diplomacy offer little in the way of theological understanding. The no- tion that von Hiigel maintained respect for the "supernatural depth" in the church may be of some help. But von Hiigel's own response to this question is perhaps most telling: it suggests that the problem is primarily one of defini- tions. The precise heretical elements in Modernism have remained rather unde- in von Hiigel, Selected Letters, ed. Bernard Holland (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1927), p. 248.

The words are similar to those used by Pope John XXIII to convene the Second Vatican Council, words imitated in a number of council documents. Pope John urged the council members to study and expound authentic doctrine "through the methods of research and through the literary forms of modern thought. The substance of ancient doctrine is one thing, and the way in which it is presented is another" (see Walter M. Abbott, ed., The Documents of Vatican II [New York: Guild Press, 1966], p. 715). 18 Von Hiigel, Selected Letters. 128</page><page sequence="6">An Orthodox Modernist fined. And the theological character of von Hiigel's position has never been adequately specified and contrasted with the heretical elements in Modern- ism. I propose, then, to pinpoint one of the most prominent and crucial heretical elements in condemned Modernism, the Modernist view of revela- tion. I will present von Hiigel's own theological position on this important point. And then I will argue that, whatever the political and historical rea- sons for von Hiigel's escape from censure, there is theological justification for the fact that he has not always been classified as a Modernist. THE MODERNIST VIEW OF REVEALED KNOWLEDGE The occasion of the Modernist "movement" or "tendency" at the end of the nineteenth century was a very real and painful experience among many educated Roman Catholics. The situation in England, von Hiigel's home in his adult life, was candidly portrayed by Robert Dell in 1904.19 Dell, himself a convert to Roman Catholicism, feared a serious decline in church member- ship. He felt the decline would result from the defiant inattentiveness of Roman Catholic church officials to the challenging questions of modern phi- losophy, modern exegesis, and the modern sciences of nature and history. All these disciplines were challenging common Christian and Catholic beliefs. The hierarchy of the church was not answering these questions, Dell com- plained, but only condemning them. The condemnations, he lamented, did not prevent the questions from "reaching Catholic ears." Von Hiigel read this article and sent a copy of it to his friend, Alfred Loisy, calling it "excellent."20 From more recent perspectives upon the times de- scribed by Dell, it seems that one reason why the questions of the modern intellectual disciplines were not being answered by the church was the fact that the questions were so radical. Many of the questions, to various degrees, reflected a developing spirit of the modern era in western Europe: a growing sense of the historical dependency of knowledge.21 In and of itself the historical dependency of knowledge was a neutral de- scription of the value of knowledge. It made no claims on the matter of 19 Robert Dell, "The Crisis in the Catholic Church," Fortnightly Review 455 (November 1, 1904): 846-60. 20 See Loisy's Mimoires pour servir a l'histoire religieuse de notre temps, 3 vols. (Paris: emile Nourry, 1930-31), 2:416. 21 Understanding the notion of the sociology of knowledge is necessary to explain the Moder- nist crisis in the Catholic church. For surveys of the development of the idea see (1) Robert K. Merton, "Sociology of Knowledge," in Twentieth Century Sociology, ed. Georges Gurvitch and Wil- bert E. Moore (New York: Philosophical Library, 1945), pp. 366-405; (2) Peter L.

Paul Edwards (New York: Macmillan Publishing Co., Free Press, 1967), 7:475-78. 129</page><page sequence="7">The Journal of Religion whether or not socially held "knowledge" was finally true or false. Its claim was simply that social and existential conditions influence the "shape" or "color" of knowledge. The description only noted that "knowledge" always refers to what is taken to be or believed as "knowledge" by a particular society. Hence knowledge is proposed to be not absolute, but relative to the society, the perspective in history, in which it is affirmed or presumed.22 The claim of the historical dependency of knowledge could be taken to require, however, a radically new Roman Catholic view of truth. Since knowledge is proposed always to be influenced by the historical perspective of the knower, truth was relativized. Any human truth could at best be claimed a partial truth, accurate from a particular perspective. Absolute truth, truth with a capital T, seemed to become a mythical ideal, impossible in the histor- ical world. Such a limitation applied to all human knowledge, biblical and doctrinal as well as personal and nonreligious. According to the scholastic philosophy of the Roman Catholic church in von Hiigel's times, the teachings of the church at least approximated eternal truths. There was said to be a correspondence between the knower and the known. As Dell noted, the church was committed to an ahistorical kind of medieval, scholastic philosophy. Many Catholic intellectuals, however, felt that the modern notion of the historical conditionedness of knowledge gave more consistent explanation to the data of history than did the church's scholastic philosophy. Major changes in the history of thought, differences between various cultures of the world, significant developments in the history of the church-all were better explained when knowledge was seen to depend not only upon the "nature" of the object but also upon the perspective of the knower. This view of knowledge was also very compatible with the discipline which was painfully gaining new strength in the Roman Catholic church: historico- critical exegesis of the Bible. The application of historico-critical methods to the Bible presupposed that there was a very real human and historical element in the composition of biblical texts. This supposition, when combined with the modern notion of the historical conditionedness of knowledge, had both positive and negative implications for Catholic theology. Positively it could help explain developments in ideas regarding God and ethics in the Bible and the history of the church. And it could be used to support the authenticity and propriety of the fact that Catholic faith was still a develop- ing tradition. If the shape of biblical faith was dependent upon the historical situation in which it was formulated, the same would also be true for the later tradition of Catholic faith. 22 Peter Berger, A Rumor of Angels (Garden City, N.Y.: Doubleday &amp; Co., 1969), pp. 7-8. For a more complete discussion of the epistemological basis and implications of the relativity of all knowledge and truth, see Gordon D. Kaufman, Relativism, Knowledge and Faith (Chicago: Univer- sity of Chicago Press, 1960), pts. 1, 2. 130</page><page sequence="8">An Orthodox Modernist Negatively, however, the human and historically conditioned character attributed to biblical knowledge could be seen as an attack upon the Bible's value and source. If the Bible were seen as a work involving a significantly human element, rather than a more exclusively divine element, its truth- value would be relativized-made dependent upon particular historical per- spectives. And to scholastic philosophy this would be equivalent to denying the truth-value of Scripture. Further, if God's authorship of the Bible were not emphasized in an almost magical way, there was no guarantee that it would continue to be affirmed at all, even in more mysterious and undefina- ble ways. This was one implication of Modernism which stood at the center of its condemnations by Rome. Rome's reactions against Modernism were led by Pope Pius X, elected to the papal throne on August 4, 1903, and by his Secretary of State, Merry del Val. Condemnations by the Holy Office of books doing modern historico- critical studies of the Bible began in December 1903. Other warnings regard- ing submission to Rome came in the form of encyclicals and dismissals of priests from positions and orders. Then, in 1907, came three of the strongest and most definitive steps against Modernist heresies: the Holy Office's decree, Lamentabili sane exitu (July 3); the encyclical, Pascendi dominici gregis (Sept. 8); and the motu proprio, Praestantia scripturae (Nov. 18). These were followed by refusals of sacraments to particular individuals or their excommunication. The anti-Modernist campaign was epitomized on September 1, 1910, with the oath against Modernism, to be required "of all professors and pastors of souls."23 Amid the furor of this almost brutal campaign against Modernism, neither Baron von Hiigel nor any one of his writings was singled out for censure or condemnation. Any summary of what was condemned as heretical in Modernism must attend to the two Roman documents most concerned to define and condemn the Modernist system, Lamentabili and Pascendi.24 Both of these documents proposed that Modernism, because it saw the Bible to be historically condi- tioned, also taught that Scripture need not be the revelation of a transcendent God. The decree Lamentabili consisted primarily in the enumeration of sixty-five condemned Modernist propositions. These propositions were derived from the writings of French biblical scholar, Abbe Alfred Loisy, but were condem- ned as characteristically Modernist. The recurring themes of the first third of these condemned propositions were that Scripture was very much a human and historically conditioned work (13-20); that it was not in every way au- thored by God nor directed by the supernatural (9-12); and that therefore historical exegesis deserved much greater claim to authority for interpretation 23 See Heaney (n. 11 above), 9:991-96. This summary of condemnations is paralleled by Aubert (n. 1 above), although Aubert falsely dates the anti-Modernist oath to September 1, 1909. 24 For translations of these documents I have employed Reardon's Modernism, pp. 237-48. 131</page><page sequence="9">The Journal of Religion than it was commonly allowed by the church (1-8). The remainder of the condemned propositions in large part exemplified the notion of the historical- ly conditioned character of Catholic beliefs and practices. Particularly, the decree condemned ideas regarding the historical development of faith in Christ's divinity (27) and resurrection (36); regarding the development of various christologies in the early church (31); and regarding the development of the sacraments (39-54), doctrine (52-56), and hierarchical authority in the church (59-64). A review of the decree, Lamentabili, suggests that Rome did fear that the admission of the historically conditioned character of Scripture threatened the value of revelation and also the authority of the magisterium. This decree was quickly followed up by the magisterium's most solemn and systematic condemnation of Modernism, the encyclical Pascendi. Modernists here were accused, negatively, of agnosticism and, positively, of what was called "vital immanence." Such immanence was condemned as a reductionist explanation of revelation. Modernists were defined as understanding revelation to result from an "interior sense," a "need of the Divine," experience only "in special and favorable circumstances," and having its roots "in the subconscious." According to the "folly" of condemned Modernism, "consciousness and revelation [were] synonymous." "Even the supreme authority of the Church must submit to religious consciousness," according to the Modernists, for this is "put on equal footing with revelation." Such a view of revelation required no reference to a transcendent God. Revelation was the result of the natural evolution in humanity of an immanent religious sense. According to Rome's definitions, then, a most prominently condemned aspect of Modernism was its view of revelation. Modernism was condemned not so much for advancing the historically conditioned consciousness of hu- manity as a necessary consideration in understanding the data called revela- tion, but for proposing that such consciousness was of itself a sufficient expla- nation of the existence of revelation. According to the condemned Modernist view, revelation was a product exclusively of the human psyche. Some Modernists did in fact doubt the existence of God, did deny his role in the authorship of Scripture, and did challenge the authority of the hierar- chy. Such positions became popular amid the growing modern sense of the historical relativity of knowledge. Rome reacted by condemning such tenden- cies in strokes too broad to allow precise distinction between the inescapable questions of a new era and the heretical responses of unorthodox faith. Rob- ert Dell, writing four years later than he did, might have referred to the anti-Modernist documents as further instances of condemning questions rath- er than answering them. But at least it is possible to discern one idea promi- nently attributed to Modernism and condemned in its name. This was the idea that God was not distinctively involved in revelation, for revelation was 132</page><page sequence="10">An Orthodox Modernist the immanent evolution in humanity of a natural religious consciousness. Was the theology of Friedrich von Hiigel an instance of such a position? VON HUGEL'S THEOLOGY OF REVELATION It has been proposed that the immanentist heresy in the Modernist controver- sy resulted-at least in part-from the modern assertion of the historically conditioned character of knowledge. Taking this proposal as a working hy- pothesis, it is possible to offer theological justification for the fact that al- though many persons and writings with Modernist leanings were condemned von Hiigel's theological position was not individually censured. For the no- tion of all knowledge being historically conditioned did contradict the church's absolutistic view of revelation's truth and did challenge popular views of God's role in revelation.25 But Baron von Hiigel's theology included an alternative view of truth and emphasized the role of God in revelation. The later-anathematized biblical critic, Alfred Loisy, was a leading propo- nent of the idea that theological assertions were dependent upon the perspec- tive in history in which they were formulated. Baron von Hiigel was a friend of Loisy's, corresponded with him frequently, and reviewed much that Loisy published. As was typical with the Baron, he agreed with as much that the man wrote as was possible before finding it necessary to withhold agreement. But even before von Hiigel became familiar with Loisy's writings he had already become familiar with the notion of the historical dependency of theo- logical knowledge.'6 Von Hiigel's acceptance of this idea, and his theological response to it, can be shown by examining four different moments in his life. First, as early as 1891 von Hiigel had circulated to a few friends a copy of the evaluation he had prepared of a manuscript by H. I. D. Ryder on biblical inspiration and biblical criticism.27 Ryder was a theologian of some repute in England, fairly broad-minded, but deeply schooled in scholastic theology. Even though von Hiigel did attempt to highlight what was good about Ryder's paper, it was quite clear he opposed the scholastic idea of inspiration it contained, the idea which envisioned God as the author (in a very literal and quite anthropomorphic sense) of the whole Bible. Von Hiigel agreed with Ryder that the entire Bible was inspired. But the 25 See the paper by Eugene TeSelle, "Between Historicism and Dogmatism: 'Tradition' and 'Development' in the Catholic Modernist Controversy" (privately distributed, 1970). 26 Von Hiigel was fluent in German and was well read in German historical and biblical scholarship. His ideas on the historical dependency of thought were influenced by such persons as Ernst Troeltsch and Rudolf Eucken (teacher of Max Scheler), as well as Charles de Smedt and John Henry Newman (see Barmann, pp. 9-11, 73, 92 n., and 167). 27 See von Hiigel's "Notes upon the Subject of Biblical Inspiration and Inerrancy," addressed to H. I. D. Ryder, May 18, 1891. I extend thanks to Jim Burtchaell, C.S.C., of the University of Notre Dame, for making these privately published notes available to me. 133</page><page sequence="11">The Journal of Religion Baron proposed inspiration to mean a "divine incitement of a person's will to write." Such inspiration did not mean that God necessarily altered the con- tent of what was written, especially not in regard to nonreligious content. In such matters the human biblical authors "wrote according to the ideas and knowledge of their times and places."28 Already von Hiigel's writings reflect- ed, then, his sense of the historically conditioned character of knowledge. In criticizing Ryder's paper von Hiigel did not have his own view of revela- tion fully developed. But his did have an analogy with which to explain one way in which God could be seen, in a properly broad sense, to be the auctor of Scripture. God might relate to a writer as He could to a weaver. "God could move a weaver to sit down and weave his ordinary, honest though rough and imperfect, broadcloth." This would make God the auctor of the product, and the product would be "inspired." This was especially true "if whilst the man weaves his ordinary natural warp God weaves simultaneously an extraordi- nary supernatural woof, and if He moved him to the first act only to find a non-miraculous but specially appropriate material on which to exercise the second, His own act."29 Von Hiigel's suggestion is that God could move a man to write something very ordinary, something that reflected the spontaneous theological and ethi- cal, as well as common scientific and historical, ideas of his day. God would be the primary auctor of such work, especially if within it could one day be discerned a broader historical woof, a plan by which the development of authentic monotheistic faith was given objective expression. Although von Hiigel only spoke analogously in this early essay, he emphasized the impor- tant initiative and overarching plan of God in an inspired work. A second sign of von Hiigel's attempt to reconcile historical relativity with an orthodox view of God's role in biblical authorship came in response to an encyclical. On November 18, 1893, Leo XIII published Providentissimus Deus. The encyclical was generally understood as a reaction against modern bibli- cal exegesis. It reaffirmed the doctrines of the plenary inspiration of Scripture and its inerrancy and warned of a rationalistic bias in those who found errors in the Bible. But the encyclical also made certain modern allowances. It accepted the idea that the Bible was not aimed at teaching scientific fact, encouraged greater scholarly study of the Bible and of related oriental lan- guages, and it did not condemn the long-developing scholarly opinion re- garding the four traditions in the Pentateuch. Baron von Hiigel took these allowances as the basis for a progressive interpretation of the encyclical.30 28 Ibid., p. 11. 29Ibid., p. 12. 30 See von Hiigel's letter, "The Papal Encyclical and Mr. Gore," Spectator (May 19, 1894), pp. 684-85. Charles Gore, a personal friend of von Hiigel's and the future Anglican archbishop of Birmingham, had written an earlier article on the encyclical, portraying it to promise a disas- trous future for biblical criticism in the Roman church (see Guardian [April 11, 1894], p. 530). 134</page><page sequence="12">An Orthodox Modernist Von Hiigel's interpretation of Providentissimus Deus presumed truth to be a dynamic rather than a static category. To claim that theological assertions in the Bible were "true" did not require they be appropriate to all times and places. On the contrary, God's self-revelation was so engineered as to "fit" the time and place in history in which it was received. From this point it could develop and "be reapplied by the Church" in later situations.3' In offering this understanding of revealed truth, von Hiigel defended the encyclical's claim to the plenary inspiration and inerrancy of Scripture. He centered his attention upon the more empirically contested claim of inerran- cy. Von Hiigel argued that "inerrancy" was a technical theological term. The theological conception of biblical inerrancy did not exclude the possibili- ty of "relativities, imperfections, inaccuracies of composition and of style, of mental method and of popular conception." Nor did this technical sense of inerrancy contradict the fact that in the Bible could be found the "successive, slow, often halting growth of even elementary religious ideas." There could even be theological divergences between different "schools" represented in the Bible. All this, according to von Hiigel's interpretation of the encyclical, was still to be "noted, registered and studied" by scientific-historical schol- arship in the Catholic church.32 How could such allowances be made for a document defined as inerrant? von Hiigel's critics asked. In response, von Hiigel offered his understanding of the church's technical theological language. Such language, he wrote, reflects the historical development of religious ideas. "Biblical inerrancy" was a claim that had been made for a long time in the church, but it was a claim that was still being refined and clarified. Its proper use might be much more qualified and nuanced than one would expect. Von Hiigel compared biblical inerrancy with other, still-developing, tech- nical terms in the vocabulary of the church. Comparable terms included "no salvation outside the Church," the "sacrifice of the Mass," and original "sin." What had happened to all these terms in the church's tradition? All had been significantly qualified. In 1854 Pius IX had made it clear that "invincible ignorance" made salvation a real possibility for untold numbers of people who lived outside the Roman Catholic church. Similarly Trent had affirmed the Mass to be a "sacrifice," but explained it as "unbloody, painless, and effortless." And Cardinal Newman had proposed that original "sin" could not be called sin in any ordinary, guilt-attached, sense of the word.33 According to von Hiigel's analysis the notion of the Bible's inerrancy need not commit the church irrevocably to the idea of no historical or scientific mistakes in the biblical text. Nor did it demand that the Bible was the eter- nally best statement of theological and ethical ideas. But von Hiigel also 31 "The Papal Encyclical," p. 685. 32 Ibid. 33 Ibid. 135</page><page sequence="13">The Journal of Religion argued that such qualifications did not lessen the value of the Bible for Chris- tian faith. For what the Bible did provide was a reliable record of a develop- ing, monotheistic faith. The message of God was intentionally "adapted" to the place in history of its reception. This meant the message was especially right for its own time and place. It also meant the message was not to be petrified for all time, and that the church always had the responsibility to reinterpret and reapply the message for later times. Von Hiigel's point was that the Bible was a historical and human book, but also one which marked a correct development of faith. It employed not some foreign language from outside of time. Rather it used "the current language of the times," using standards of history "astonishingly different from our own," nowhere violating the "literary ethics of [its own] time and people." The Bible, von Hiigel suggested, was the incarnation of the Spirit of God. This point emphasized that the Bible was bodily, finite, and related to history. But it also emphasized that it was truth, truth in a dynamic sense of leading humanity toward its intended union with God. Eight years after Leo XIII's encyclical, there was a third moment in von Hiigel's career which reflected his continuing confidence that all knowledge was historically conditioned and that such conditionedness demeaned neither the source of revelation nor its value. Evidence regarding this event in von Hiigel's life comes from a letter he wrote to George Tyrrell on December 18, 1901.34 In that letter the Baron told about a meeting he had had with the influential Padre Lepidi in Rome. He reported that Lepidi had liked his strong affirmation of the plenary character of inspiration. In fact, Lepidi liked it so well he was quite willing to overlook the three qualifications von Hiigel proposed to put upon the concept of inspiration. Von Hiigel proposed, first, that inspiration, like inerrancy, was a technical theological term. Sec- ond, the term meant for von Hiigel nothing more than that "everywhere God communicated as much and that kind of His truth as could be assimilated at that time and place." Third, "not even in the New Testament was this element of inevitable relativity wanting." Even those who bore witness to Jesus did not have an absolute, ahistorical standpoint, making them able to receive and formulate absolute and eternal Truth. Even here the revealed truth was inev- itably relative to the place and time in history in which it was received. Note both aspects of what von Hiigel has said. He has admitted the histori- cal relativity of knowledge. But he has not admitted that knowledge is rela- tive to an unplanned, random kind of history, rendering it worthless. Rather, he has seen it to be relative to the providential influence of God in (salva- tion-) history. Therefore he can claim that revelation is a gracious gift of God and that it is invaluable for the historical church. Of course the value of revelation in this view can only be verified in the indefinite or eschatological 34 For the text of almost the entire letter, see Petre's Von Huigel and Tyrrell, pp. 80-100, esp. 97-98. 136</page><page sequence="14">An Orthodox Modernist future. But such verification can be confidently expected by the church in faith and hope. This third moment in von Hiigel's career provides a good summary of his idea of revelation. But it does not entirely explain it. A fourth event in von Hiigel's life forced him to lay out more completely the explanation of his idea of revelation. The event involved the interpretation of the New Testament. On December 6, 1903, the Holy Office put five books by Alfred Loisy upon the Index of Forbidden Books.35 Von Hiigel leapt to Loisy's defense, feeling the issue was the right of a Catholic scholar to engage in modern historico- critical investigation of the Bible. But von Hiigel's defense put him at odds with a friend he greatly admired, Maurice Blondel.36 With his typical diplomatic sensitivity, von Hiigel sympathized with Rome's move.37 He saw it as a disciplinary action to "shield the faith" of "the great majority" of Catholics, Catholics who were "utterly unprepared" for the methods and results of 200 years of modern biblical study. Hence these people would also not be ready for Loisy's attempts to synthesize and respond to such studies. Yet Loisy's kind of work had to be done, according to von Hiigel, for the future of the church. The church's opposition to Loisy might be as rigorous as it had been to Aristotelianism, to redating the Dionysian writings, and to the theory of Copernicus. For in each case the hierarchy presumed itself to be defending faith per se rather than part of an outdated perspective upon reality. Yet von Hiigel was certain that some day, but only some day in the distant future, the church's opposition to Loisy's kind of work would come to an end. Von Hiigel's dispute with Blondel arose from a particular instance of the historical dependency of human knowledge asserted by Loisy. Two of Loisy's books, L'Evangile et l'Eglise and Autour d'un petit livre, had suggested that histori- cal exegesis showed the knowledge of Jesus to be human and history depen- dent. Both books claimed, for instance, that Jesus had been mistaken about the time of the Parousia and that he did not know of his own divinity. Soon after these books were condemned, Blondel developed his objections to them in three installments in La Quinzaine.38 35 The books were L'Evangile et 1'Eglise (Paris: Alphonse Picard et fils, 1902), Autour d'un petit livre (Paris: Alphonse Picard et fils, 1903), Etudes ivangeliques (Paris: Alphonse Picard et fils, 1902), Le Quatriime ivangile (1903), and La Religion d'Israel (Paris: Letouzey et Ane, 1901). 36 Von Hiigel called Blondel "a genius of the first rank" (Barmann, p. 69). He first met Blondel in 1895 and was deeply impressed by his L'Action. This book influenced some aspects of von Hiigel's own thinking. 37 See von Hiigel, "The Case of Abbe Loisy," Pilot (January 9, 1904), pp. 30-31 (see also his "The Abbe Loisy and the Holy Office," Times [London] [March 2, 1904], p. 15 [signed "Roma- nus"]). In this response to earlier letters in the Times, von Hiigel defended some of the particulars of Loisy's New Testament exegesis, as well as the necessity of freedom for Catholics to do historicocritical work. 38 The article was entitled "Histoire et dogme: Les Lacunes philosophiques de l'exegeses mod- erne." La Quinzaine published it between January and February of 1904. For an English transla- 137</page><page sequence="15">The Journal of Religion Von Hiigel replied in his article, "Du Christ eternel et nos christologies successives."39 Von Hiigel and Blondel were actually in considerable agree- ment, and some of their apparent discord regarding Christ's knowledge may have been a matter of semantics-attempting to distinguish, for example, between consciousness and knowledge. Both Blondel and von Hiigel were attempting to maintain the "true God, true man" paradox. Blondel feared that the assignment of historical dependency to the knowledge of Christ im- plied a denial of his divinity. Von Hiigel was more concerned to emphasize the human and therefore history-dependent character of Christ's knowledge. He was more ready than Blondel to accept the then-current agreement of historicocritical exegetes that Jesus shared the basic world view-including what might be called the "illusions"-of his time and place in history. What von Hiigel opposed was what he saw as a tendency toward ahistorical doce- tism. He could not accept Blondel's a priori certainty that Christ had a human consciousness of his divinity that was (von Hiigel wrote the article in French) "sans restrictions, sans arret, sans progres aucun, mais immediate- ment explicite et achevee.. . ."40 Von Hiigel's position on the question of the knowledge and self-con- sciousness of Christ can be explained by two principles in his theology. The first was that Jesus was truly human, as well as truly God. The second was that God is incomprehensible Mystery. Von Hiigel, with more dependency upon biblical exegesis than Blondel, attempted to explain how these two principles pertained to the consciousness of Jesus. In the first place, "human" was a complex and extremely important con- cept in von Hiigel's theology. It included the idea that every person was graced with an indwelling of God's "Eternal Spirit." It was this divine Spirit which gave all humanity a "restlessness" regarding life's finitude and a dim, evolving consciousness of God. God was within humanity (and the individu- al), as well as outside.41 Further, besides having the Eternal Spirit of God at its root, humanity was always involved in history. Human consciousness was influenced by its partic- ular place in history. And this was the case also for Jesus. The knowledge of tion, see Maurice Blondel, The Letter on Apologetics and History and Dogma, trans. Alexander Dru and Illtyd Trethowan (London: Harvill Press, 1964). Blondel had exchanged several long and important letters on the topic with von Hiigel and Loisy immediately after publication of the two books. For these documents, see Rene Marle, Au coeur de la crise moderniste (Paris: Aubier, 1960) (see also Emile Poulat, Histoire, dogme et critique dans la crise moderniste [Paris: Casterman, 1962]). 39This appeared in a later issue of La Quinzaine (58 [June 1, 1904]: 285-312). Because of von Hiigel's friendship with Blondel, the exchange of opinions on this issue is said by Barmann (p. 120) to have pained von Hiigel very much. 40 Von Hiigel, "Du Christ," in La Quinzaine, p. 309. 41 See von Hiigel, "On Certain Central Needs of Religion," in Essays and Addresses on the Philosophy of Religion," 2d ser. (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1926), pp. 89-131, esp. 106-8. 138</page><page sequence="16">An Orthodox Modernist Jesus was graciously fit for its time, necessarily colored by the society and history of which Jesus was a part.42 Von Hiigel made this second aspect of his idea of "human" most clear fifteen years later, long after Rome's opposition to heretical Modernism was proved. In 1919 von Hiigel proposed that the Incarnation could not, even by [God] Himself, be made other than the entering into, and possession of, a human mind and will endowed with special racial disposi- tions and particular racial categories of thought.43 Assuredly this mind and will would be filled and moved by the deepest religious and moral truth and insight, and would be preserved from all essential error concerning the direct objects of the divine in- dwelling and condescension. Yet this truth and insight would of necessity show, to minds and hearts of other races and times, imaginative and emotional peculiarities- certain omissions, combinations, stresses, outlines, colourings characteristic of the race and time of the Revealer. Otherwise the Revealer would begin His career by being simply unintelligible to His first hearers, and even, in the long run, to the large majority of mankind; and he would, in Himself, not be normally, characteristically, man.44 All humanity includes a gracious presence of God's Eternal Spirit in the human spirit, according to von Hilgel. But even in the extreme instance in history of the degree of that union between God and man, the historical particularity and dependency of the individual was not destroyed. In the true man, Jesus, historical particularity was not less a fact than the presence of God's Spirit. And this was the paradox of the Incarnation. The complex reality of humanness was the first of the two principles, then, which explain von Hiigel's position regarding the knowledge of Jesus. The second principle was von Hiigel's emphasis upon the "incomprehensibleness and ineffableness of God for all but Himself, both here and hereafter." The Baron saw this as the "highest doctrine of Christianity."45 And he found it to be exemplified in God's Incarnation. "Anyone who approached Jesus histori- 42 Von Hiigel felt that a person's graciously inherent dim consciousness of God could be purified by a dialectical tension with the continuing experiences of personal life and history. The idea is not entirely unlike Karl Rahner's idea of transcendental vs. categorical revelation, the latter being an objective correlate to the former (see my 1974 Yale dissertation, "Rahner and Revelation"). 43 "Racial" is a clumsy term in this quotation. Obviously von Hiigel did not use the same vocabulary as that popularized by the discipline of sociology. But his use of this term makes it clear that he does refer here to the historically conditioned character of knowledge. 44 "The Apocalyptic Element in the Teaching of Jesus," in Essays and Addresses on the Philosophy of Religion, 1st ser. (London: J. M. Dent &amp; Sons, 1921), pp. 119-43, esp. 125. 45 See von Hiigel, "The Church and the Bible: The Two Stages of Their Interrelation," Dublin Review 115 (July-October 1894): 315 (first in a three-part series).

The Mystery of God in history was never comprehensively perceived nor perfectly defined. It was only glimpsed and symbolized from a whole variety and series of diverse human perspectives. The value of the Christian revelation tradition was not that it provided a static and absolute perspective upon Truth. Rather it provided an ongoing variety of perspectives which, in balance and sum, von Hiigel found to be uniquely "rich and deep" for his own perspective. And he claimed the value of this tradition resulted from the fact that it developed out of the revelation of God, a revelation planted deep within humanity and objectified by God- directed events in history. In all four of these moments in his life von Hiigel contested an absolutistic or static view of revealed truth. His explanation of revelation did not examine so much the supernatural source of revelation, which he affirmed in faith and hope, but rather examined the human recipients of revelation. Here von Hiigel emphasized both the historical dependency of humanity and also humanity's divine potential, that is, the gracious and active presence of God in human consciousness. His theology argued that the God of revelation was at work both within the human subject of revelation (the perceiver, interpret- er, and formulator of events) and also in the external events themselves. In von Hiigel's perspective revealed knowledge was historically conditioned. But such knowledge was not cheapened by its historical character. Rather it was enriched. For although it required continuing reinterpretation and reapplica- tion, it was integrally a part of human history. This meant it was available, through the processes of historical-critical investigation, for understanding and appreciation in every historical age. EVALUATING THE ORTHODOXY OF VON HUGEL'S POSITION One of the most valuable points in von Hiigel's theology was his recognition that the historical relativity of knowledge did not demand that revelation was erroneous. He recognized that human truth claims were made from particu- lar sociohistorical perspectives and are therefore partial rather than absolute. 46Von Hiigel, "Du Christ," in La Quinzaine, p. 309. 47 See n. 40 above. 140</page><page sequence="18">An Orthodox Modernist But this was not equivalent to such truth claims being wrong. According to von Hiigel's dynamic sense of truth, even changes in such truth claims did not require that some (if not all) were false. That would be no more the case than to presume that someone in the British Empire had to be in error if one said the sun was in the west when another said it was in the east. One could be living in Bombay and the other in London. The truth claim held by each was partial or perspectival, but neither was false. Von Hiigel used the modern notion of historically relative standpoints to defend rather than attack the value of the Roman Catholic tradition of reve- lation. He argued that developments, differences, imperfections, inaccuracies, and illusions in revelation need not be errors. Rather they were reflections of the way in which God's revelation was adapted to the standpoint in history in which it was received. Such historical adaptations did not destroy the value of the revelation. For the revelation pointed its recipients in the right direction. Baron von Hiigel did recognize an important implication of his acceptance of the historically conditioned character of revelation. He recognized that it required that formulations of revelation would repeatedly need to be reinter- preted and reapplied by the church. For the fact that a formula of revelation pointed a particular people in history in the right direction did not guarantee that it did the same for another. But he felt that the Catholic emphasis upon the authority of the magisterial tradition, aided by the Spirit of God, could accomodate this problem. What von Hiigel did was to accept part of what was new in the philosophy of his day and use it to explain and support some older Catholic themes. He did not simply repeat the scholastic philosophical position which was still dominant in the Roman church. But neither did he deify the modern outlook by accepting all its demands and its agnosticism. And in this sense the Baron's theological position stood somewhere between the scholastic position defended by the anti-Modernist documents of Rome and the Modernist posi- tions which were condemned. Besides proposing to defend the value of tradition with a dynamic sense of truth, von Hiigel also attempted to formulate a new understanding of how revelation occurred. Like many Modernists of his time, he had proposed that the consciousness or standpoint of the human subject was extremely impor- tant in the formulation of revelation. He rejected the common scholastic idea that the human author of Scripture was as passive as a pen in the hand of God. Yet at the same time he rejected the condemned Modernist idea that revelation was only the evolution of a consciousness naturally immanent to humanity. For von Hiigel, revelation was neither the exclusive work of God nor the exclusive work of men. The first would have been a concession to fideistic magic and the second a concession to rationalistic secularism. But the posi- tion in between was difficult to conceptualize and develop. Von Hiigel re- 141</page><page sequence="19">The Journal of Religion ferred to the Eternal Spirit of God graciously present and active at the depths of human consciousness. This could be explained as a reformulation of Thomas Aquinas's idea of supernatural or uncreated grace-God himself-in humanity. And von Hiigel referred to God's providential involvement in human history. This was a traditional Catholic idea. With these two tradi- tional ideas, von Hiigel attempted to explain in a modern perspective how a transcendent God and true humanity might both be integrally involved in the composition of revelation. Von Hiigel's idea of revelation was that it was mystery rather than either magic or natural happening. And this position reflected the mainstream in the Roman Catholic tradition of orthodoxy. For this theme is an instance of the claim that the grace of God perfects rather than destroys or replaces human nature. Man's "ordinary, honest though rough and imperfect" writ- ings were not eliminated by revelation. Rather, they were used as an appro- priate material through which God might weave his act in history. This same middle road which von Hiigel attempted to maintain in ex- plaining revelation had also been reflected in an important thrust in the First Vatican Council. There the concern had been to maintain a path between fideism and rationalism. Fideism accepted magic to explain God's doings and rationalism rejected all influence of the supernatural in worldly affairs. The anti-Modernist documents can be considered as another attempt on the part of the church to avoid these two dangers. These documents, however, strongly condemned only the rationalistic explanations of revelation. Von Hiigel's position was in some ways more Catholic than the documents themselves, for his position made explicit the church's traditional opposition to fideism, as well as its opposition to rationalism. The preceding paragraphs have indicated that there was some theological justification for the fact that von Hiigel was not explicitly condemned as a Modernist. To presume that his theology of revelation was condemned would be theologically misleading. For Catholic theology must still attempt to ex- plain revelation in ways which avoid both fideism and rationalism. The struggle accurately to refine the church's understanding of this technical term, "revelation," continues. And a misunderstanding of the role played by Baron von Hiigel in this struggle, or a misunderstanding of precisely what Rome traditionally has condemned, could compound the difficulties in for- mulating for today an orthodox and meaningful understanding of revelation. The fact that Baron von Hiigel was not explicitly condemned is fortunate. It does help to clarify what the Modernist controversy was about. It might be claimed that there was nothing dramatically new and profound about von Hiigel's theology. But his writings were a selective reflection of modern thought. Von Hiigel's position on revelation maintained a balance between reason and faith which was traditionally Catholic. And this sort of balance has influenced the official and accepted Roman Catholic view of revelation 142</page><page sequence="20">An Orthodox Modernist in the latter half of the twentieth century. Von Hiigel's sense of diplomacy gave considerable appreciation to the positions of others, scholastics as well as modernists. It was as if he wrote always with an appreciation of one of his important themes: the historical relativity of standpoints makes no knowl- edge false, but makes even one's own knowledge partial and incomplete. 143</page></plain_text>
