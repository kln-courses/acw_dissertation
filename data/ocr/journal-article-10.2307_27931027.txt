<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Terracotta Shrine from Achzib By William Culican A model shrine of brown well-baked clay (Palestine Archaeological Museum 44.46) found in a Tomb at Achzib (A. ez-Z?b, Heb. Tel 'Akz?v) on the Phoenician coast north of Haifa is one of the most enigmatic objects of ancient cult (Taf. 1 ). Within the shrine is a strip of clay attached to the lower front and arched backwards to the back wall. Before joining the wall it is bent upwards to form a vertical projection decorated with eight flattened knobs of clay. The only other decorations are a plastic disc-and-crescent above the shrine on the headboard and some traces of red-painted strips on the top and the sides. Its careful make leaves us in no doubt that a deliberate attempt has been made to render an "aniconic" cult object. It has a number of close relatives from Cyprus in the Cesnola collection, all equally puzzling, but in comparison with the Achzib shrine, rather less deliberate and cruder. Atlas II pl. XIII, no. 1011 (Metropolitan Museum, New York, 74.51.1753) is a shrine of red terracotta (Ht. ca 14 ins.) covered with a grey wash on the outside. The recess contains a crude lump of clay, quite formless except for a double row of disc-like knobs on top of it and three small knobs on the floor, one at each side of the image (Taf. 2 A). There is the same disc and inverted crescent above the shrine. No. 103 on the same plate of the Atlas2 is somewhat similar. The central object here is rather club-shaped with three discs stuck on it. On the outside of the shrine at each side there are the remains of what appear to be short pilasters, almost certainly incense-stands, as we shall see below. Cesnola's Atlas tentatively explains these images as "symbols" of Aphrodite festooned with roses. Myres in the Handbook (cited note 2) attempts no explanation of the "pellets" but notes strong foreign influence in the shrine type, presumably referring to their derivation from the Egyptian naiskos. Atlas II, no. 73 is like 101 above, but has three discs on the floor of the shrine and two projecting red painted pilasters at the lower front of each side. The provenance of the Cesnola shrines is given as Idalion. Some explanation of the process of devolution from anthropomorphic image to an enigmatic aniconic shape is provided by three shrines from Amathus in the Cyprus Museum3. Of these C 75 (Cyprus Museum 47) carries a full female figure wearing the double crown of "roses", some indication of necklaces and with red-painted buttons applied in vertical panels to the body (Taf. 2C). That she is a fertility goddess is undoubted, since her hands are shown in relief grasping her breasts. In C71 (Cyprus 1 J. L. Myres, Handbook of the Cesnola Collection of Antiquities from Cyprus (New York 1914), no. 2130. Atlas references are to A Descriptive Atlas of the Cesnola Collection of Cypriot Antiquities by L. Palma di Cesnola (New York 1895?1903). 2 Ibid., no. 2131. 8 P. Dikaios, A Guide to the Cyprus Museum (Nicosia 31961), 205.</page><page sequence="2">48 A Terracotta Shrine from Achzib Museum 53) almost every detail of this image has been obliterated except for the paint ed eyes and the crude vertical rows of knobs on the body (Taf. 2 ). The whole image is enclosed in a framework of red paint vaguely suggesting a throne. The top is painted red except for a black area inside the crescent. In C 74 (Cyprus Museum 52) there is nothing left of the central figure except the crude indications of nose, crown, arms and abdomen (Taf. 2D). Nevertheless, this shrine is interesting for the preservation of one of the two pilasters set at the outside edges. It takes the form of a cone set in a floret of clay on a conical stand. The cone is painted red and can scarcely be intended for any thing other than an incense cone in a lily-stand4. The placing of twin incense can delabra in front of shrines is well attested from the carved stone funerary naiskos of the West Phoenicians5. The miniature pillars are at the same time in this case similar to larger versions flanking the door of a terracotta shrine of a different style from Cyprus, often invoked as a Cypriot or Cypro-Phoenician parallel to the twin pillars in front of Solomon's temple, themselves quite possibly related to incense stands6. The buttons and disc-and-crescent designs which decorate the tops of C71 and C74 are replete with astral symbolism, whilst the painted ladder design on the sides of better made C 75, and the painted triangles on the entablature more probably represent the architectural decoration of some major mcfbad form which these models copy, obvious ly not Egyptian. A further shrine in the British Museum (A 150) is from an excavated context at Amathus7 (Taf. 3 A). The image here retains nothing but the "rose crown" and a modelled object on the breast which I think is best explained as a m?daillon on a cord. The role of the medallion amongst Astarte devotees is well-known8. An alternative explanation that it is a winged disc is not supported, since an unpublished broken terracotta figure in the National Museum, Beirut, from Har?'ib has a similar outsize m?daillon (Taf. 6 ) in disc-and-crescent form. There is a ladder pattern painted on the sides of the Amathus shrine and three horizontal rows of triangles on the entablature. The two "pilasters" are slightly waisted and have cup-shaped tops, supporting the incense-stand interpretation. The tomb from which it comes contained a bronze strigli and a Greek black figure lekythos of the late sixth century B.C.9 and cannot therefore be regarded as earlier. (The second shrine from the British Museum excavations is quite different from this, and will be discussed below). Yet another of these model shrines from Amathus was in the possession of Ohne falsch-Richter and is illustrated by him on pl. CXCIX: 1?2 of "Kypros, die Bibel und Homer", now MS 156 of the University Museum, Philadelphia. It has recently 4 A genre terracotta from Achzib Taf. 6 A shows what I take to be a man holding such a model stand with incense cone on it, perhaps he is blowing on it. 5 Cf. e. g.

Betancourt who has used it to suggest architectural interpreta tions10. Especially he suggests that the rows of knobs indicate the ends of structural beams running horizontally through the walls. Inside is a crude female figure with a veil drawn over the head. This mantle has small buttons at head level. The right arm of the figure is lifted up to the face. There are vertical rows of buttons stuck on the outer edges of the shrine. One further detail of this shrine is important: on each inner side-face is modelled a pillar with capital of Phoenician "Aeolian" type: its volutes and stamens can clearly be made out in Ohnefalsch-Richter's photograph. Apart from the Amathus context noted above, that of Ohnefalsch-Richter's shrine is the only one known in Cyprus. Although no details are given, the tomb from which it came is illustrated (Kypros, pl. CLXXV, 2) and described as "Graeco-Phoenician", a term which in the author's terminology usually indicates the Bichrome pottery style of the middle Iron Age. At Amathus the British Museum excavators found the two shrines among a number of terracottas neatly piled in Tomb 183. Again this tomb contained pottery of the sixth century B.C. It is true that this may belong to a secondary use of the tomb, but the situation is not clear. Thus Mrs. Birmingham's assignment of the Cypriot shrines to the "early first millennium" cannot be accepted on the published evidence alone11. It is here that the context of the Achzib shrine is important, since the tombs from Ben-Dor's excavations contained nothing later than 650 B.C.12. Further more, since its clay has a most definite non-Cypriot appearance, perfectly consistent with the local Phoenician terracottas of the earlier group from Achzib, it can be taken to support her view that these shrines are symptoms of mainland (Phoenician) influence upon Cyprus. The provenances alone might here be significant: Idalion was certainly a Phoenician-dominated city13, whilst Amathus certainly received strong Phoenician influences in the early first millennium14. I see it as likely that these few terracotta shrines reflect in Cyprus a certain Phoenician tendency to aniconic representation and think it unlikely that they indicate sheer incompetence on the part of Cypriot artists in reproducing a more suggestive visual image of Astarte. Both the plethora of compe tent contemporary Cypriot images relating to the fertility cult, as well as the strong fact that the Achzib shrine is beautifully modelled, suggest that we have to do here with deliberate aniconism. The question it raises is whether such a devolution of imagery had taken place on the mainland of Syria and Phoenicia as well as in Cyprus. Related to it is the question of whether or not Mrs. Birmingham is correct in regarding these shrines from Cyprus as symptoms of mainland Phoenician influence in that island.

Prausnitz has pointed out that some of the Achzib terracottas belong to tombs of the Persian period. This does not appear to be the case with the tombs excavated by Ben-Dor, all of which as examined by me in the Palestine Archaeological Museum bear no sign of reuse in the Persian period except in the case of certain tomb-shaft deposits. 13 G.

This shrine houses the standing figure of a young male, strongly Egyptian in style (Taf. 3 ), but Phoeni cian in stance ? one hand down his side, the other drawn horizontally across the breast16. The shrine clearly has a cavetto moulding, a spreading winged disc on the entablature with a uraeus frieze above it. Its only variant from non-Egyptian style are the alternating black and red bands painted on the sides. Naiskoi with frontally standing figures are rare in Egypt. Our main evidence of them comes from the Phoeni cian west, particularly Motya17 and Sardinian Sulcis18. Miss Bisi19 in a recent study has clearly shown that in terms of West Phoenician evidence alone, Garbini's contention that such naiskoi were not used amongst Phoeni cians until the Persian period is unfounded. At the same time, however, there were no securely dated Egyptianizing naiskoi (i.e. with uraeus frieze) from Phoenicia which pre-date their appearance in the West in the early sixth century B.C. (Miss Bisi's date). The second Amathus shrine must at least be taken, from its context, to provide a terminus ante quern of about 600 B.C., whilst the mainland analogies to the vernacu lar Cypro-Phoenician shrines would suggest that naiskos shrines were in use in the Syro-Palestinian region from at least the eighth century onwards. Now from the excavations at K?mid el-L?z in the Lebanon comes a large model terracotta shrine (KL :72 :400) from the Late Bronze Age temple of Level III (Taf. 6 C-D)20. It is an interesting adaptation to Canaanite ideas and originally had either two free-standing pillars or else incense burners (now broken away) standing in front of it on low plinths connected with the frontage. It settles once and for all the question of Canaanite adoptions of the naiskos form. There was thus an extra-Egyptian tradition on which the Phoenicians of the West could draw and which might partially explain some of the aberrant features21 of West Phoenician naiskos types, not only the tall undecorated entablatures but also unusual pilaster forms, and, of course, the placing of the disc-and-crescent and frieze of flowers (mostly lotuses) on the front. Further support for a mainland origin of the type may be sought in the symbolic use of the disc-and-crescent. A shrine like A 150 was used by Ronzevalle to illustrate his argument on the relation of this symbol to Astarte, on the grounds that the formless images in these shrines were ancestral to the "Venus Lugens" of Roman coinage from Syria22. Incidentally the Ohnefalsch-Richter shrine would have supported his argu 15 A. S.

Although it is difficult to accept Ronzevalle's argument for the exclusive association of this symbol with Astarte, its use amongst the Phoenicians is well attested and can in itself be taken to support the Phoenician origin of the Amathus shrine type. It is here that the "rose-crown" and pelet decoration may be significant, even though few mainland examples can be quoted. This shrine type decorated with pellets is also known at Nippur, a crudely modelled example containing a bearded figure wearing a turban covered with pellets23. D. van Buren suggested that the pellets were stars "perhaps symbolizing the month"24. From Level E vxHama comes a crude female figure in a niche entirely edged with pellets25. She wears a turban with central pellet and there is a modelled disc and crescent at her feet. Details of the modelling link this figure with the North Syrian tradition of terracotta art (especially the pierced eyes). Nevertheless it is a unique piece and comes from a level in which Phoenician art objects (especially ivories) were present. There is next the question of roses. P. Betancourt's reconstruction (AJA 75, 427 f.) of the knobs as vestigial representations of structural elements is scarcely borne out by their use on the Amathus models. Nor would such heavy timbers be necessary for the construction of small naiskoi, which these shrines surely represent, rather than the larger structures of the Tamassos tomb with which he compares them. In fact these terracotta models and the Tamassos tomb have nothing in common except the engaged pillars against the inner inside walls. The old suggestion that the small discs are roses (or stars, to maintain a known Near Eastern ambivalence) commands more respect. Taf. 5C illustrates a late terracotta mould from Babylon in Brussels, illustrating a "baetylic" treatment of Babylonian Ishtar decorated with vertical panels of roses26. It is a remarkable analogy to the decoration of the Cypriot shrines. Even more relevant is a plaque found at the foot of the mound of Til-Barsip in Syria (Taf. 5 A) and dating most probably to the late Assyrian occupation there27. It is modelled in the form of a breast-pressing Astarte figure. Her hair is bunched outwards at the sides, rather in the Cypriot manner. She wears a crown of knobs. Her skirt, or what remains of it for the lower part is broken away, is decorated with three vertical panels of quatrefoil flowers. Scattered though these few items are, they present the only context in which the Cypriot model shrines are to be understood. There can be little doubt that their few identifying symbols are to be taken to refer (at least in the immediate Cypriot context) pl. : 12; also .

A rose crown with disc and crescent symbols is shown on a terracotta relief of a votaress from the "Aphrodite t?menos" at Idalion (Ohnefalsch Richter, Kypros, pl. LIII: 44) and the fertility figurine (ibid., pl. L: 4) is entirely naked except for a crown of pellets. Only one shrine, apart from the larger Amathus shrine, seems unconnected with the cult of the fertility goddess. This is a small example from near Idalion in the Louvre, which in its niche has a helmeted male figure holding a rod vertically in front of him. Around the front of the rod is a semicircular curb with excrescences at both ends. No explanation of it seems satisfactory: though certainly L. Heuzey's suggestion28 that he is working a mortar and pestle seems near the mark, for the shape of the "mortar" is close to a kind of shield-shaped curb placed around grain-crushing trays in some Cypriot terracotta genre groups representing women preparing meal for baking. It is, of course, an extraordinary puzzle why simply the crown of roses was left represented. That it was worn by hierodule figures cannot be doubted, since in the latest lineal descendant of the shrines discussed here, from B?t Nattif in Palestine29 of the Roman period, the naked figure wears only a crown of double circlets. We can only speculate upon their identifying role in Phoenician art. There is much to suggest (though nothing to prove) that Phoenicians used a string of roses to indicate the high est heavens and that therefore the rose-crown and the stars are synonymous symbols30. A series of plaque reliefs of female votaresses from the Old Babylonian period use roses and stars alternatively as background decoration behind the head. One fine example31 is decorated with disc-and-crescent and vertical rows of knobs in such a way as to suggest strongly that these latter are stars. We find it on the entablatures of shrines depicted on the Hathor-head capitals from Cyprus, such as Ohnefalsch Richter, Kypros, pl. CC: 1, 3, a particularly interesting example, whose structure appears to be non-Egyptian. Reference may be made also to a frequently illustrated pillar from Amathus (Kypros, LXXX: 7) which is carved with three superimposed symbols; the lower two, the disc and crescent and the winged disc are clearly celestial, above them is a frieze of rosettes. At a later date we find a rose frieze crowning carved Astarte shrines from mm el-Amed in Lebanon32, S?sa in Tunisia33 and Memphis in Egypt34, in all cases in place over the uraeus frieze and the winged disc. It seems hardly likely to be meaningless decoration. On the Memphis shrine we may note also that the star (which usually appears in the background of the seated Astarte) is rendered as a rose35. Rose-and-crescent also stand for disc-and-crescent frequently in Punic Art. 28 L. Heuzey, Catalogue des figurines antiques de terre cuite (Paris 1923), 151 and G. Per rot and Ch.

One is said to come from Phoenicia and is now in the Museum of the American University Beirut (Inv. no. 6712; Ht. 22,4 cm, W. 18,3 cm). Though badly broken, there yet remains the central niche carefully edged with neatly recessed panels and flanked by two columnar naked hierodules whose features clearly belong to Cypro-Phoenician tradition (Taf. 5 ). The breakage at the lower base suggests that a flat plate of clay extended in front36. The clay is of buff colour, badly fired leaving the core of an ashy grey colour. The hair of the hierodules is vertically striated with rows of small curls and painted black. They both wear elaborate double-string neddaces and one has an ill-defined headdress37 broken off. The inside and front face of the shrine show traces of having been painted with horizontal black bands. A second shrine in the museum of the University of Missouri, Columbia, comes from the Mt. Nebo region (Jordan) in ancient Ammonite territory and has been recently published together with some of this pottery which formed part of the same tomb group (Taf. 4 A? )38. On the main shrine two half-figures of hierodules have been placed in niches above the main opening, presumably relating to the Aphrodite Parakyptusa theme and remi niscent of the special niche made for a dove in an unprovenanced shrine from Palestine39. The painted decoration of rows of triangles above the facade is a close link with that of Cypriot shrines. In the find were included two miniature crouching lions which are thought to come from a second shrine, and indeed nothing could be more appropriate, since the lion is commonly associated with the naked Astarte hiero dule in the Ancient Near East and is used to decorate the Late Bronze Age "chapel" shrines which are forerunners of the Iron Age naiskoi40. The pottery of the find appears to be of Iron II date; and indeed a few other undecorated pottery shrines have been noticed in tombs of this date in 'Amman*1. The number of shrines without images is quite remarkable. Possibly idols of perishable materials had been placed in some of them, though it is equally possible that they served as "empty shrines" and in this and in the provision of deliberately anicono graphic fetishes, as in the Achzib shrine and its relatives, provide an Eastern parallel to the contents of Punic naiskoi, which range from human images through rough anthro pomorphe and purely geometric shapes, to what appears deliberate emptiness42. 36 This same feature was noted in remains of a shrine found by R. A. S. Macalister at Gezer, cf. Gezer II (London 1912), 437 f. figs. 517?519, which had a recessed surround and large flat plate in front. 37 A short conical headdress is worn by some of the caryatid figures on the Megiddo shrines illustrated by H. G. May, below note 40. 38 S. Weinberg, Muse (Annual of the Museum of Art and Archaeology, University of Missouri, Columbia) 3 (1969), 4. 39 F.
