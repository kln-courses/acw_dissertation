BENEFIEL-Litora mundi hospita: Mobility and Social Inter- action in Roman Campania IN THIS DISSERTATION, I explore the vibrant and dynamic region of Campania during the early Roman Empire, and examine the settings and contexts that brought people from the different cities of Campania together. This densely populated area was not only a popular destina- tion for the Roman elite; it also supported a dynamic network of social, cultural, and economic interactions among the residents of various Campanian communities. To reveal the nature and full extent of these interactions, I offer a picture of the region that uses the full range of available evidence, literary, epigraphic, and archaeological. Literary accounts of Campania portray the region as a favored site for travel and peregrinatio, highlighting in particular the cities of the Campanian coast. I begin by considering the details and omis- sions of this characterization, and then turn to evidence from non- elites within the region. Gladiatorial spectacles were advertised in cities across the region, revealing how their sponsors relied on inhab- itants traveling as a matter of course and demonstrating the willing- ness of spectators to travel to attend the games. Campania also yields evidence of the vigorous functioning of weekly markets (nundinae) in the first century AD. Indeed, the complex arrangement of the market schedule reveals a design intended specifically to benefit inhabitants of the region who could thereby attend markets at multiple points during the week. Miscellaneous graffiti scrawled on the walls of the city give voice to the individuals involved in regional travel and interaction, and to expressions of community identity. The dissertation concludes with a synthesis of the networks of communication and exchange in which most Campanian communities participated.</page><page sequence="2">Summaries ofDissertations This study thus aims to take us beyond the pleasure-seeking society that stressed luxury, amoenitas, and Campania's coast. The picture of Campania is richer, and textured with far greater detail, when we also take into account the dynamic networks of interaction that united and connected the region's communities. This study brings to light the remarkable permeability of the Roman city, and illustrates the highly integrated and mobile nature of ancient society. It contributes to our understanding of the cities of Roman Italy, and the life within them. Degree in Classical Philology 2005 EMMANUEL C. BOURBOUHAKIS-"Not Composed in a Chance Manner": The Epitaphios for Manuel I Komnenos by Eustathius of Thessalonike. Text, Trans- lation, Commentary WRITTEN IN 1180-1181, THE EPITAPHIOS FOR MANUEL I KOMNENOS, by the Byzantine classical scholar and man of letters, Eustathius of Thessalonike, marked the high point of mediaeval Greek funerary oratory at the close of the greatest revival of Greek rhetoric since the Second Sophistic. Besides securing a reliable text, accompanied by a translation to guide the non-expert reader, the aim throughout has been to identify the constitutive elements, whether rhetorical figures or panegyrical imagery, directed by Eustathius in a virtuoso display of Byzantine oratory. Among the aspects of the work which receive special emphasis are the structurally 'encoded' oral nature of the work as a text intended for performance before an audience of listeners, and the stylistic character of Eustathius' funerary encomium. As a study of the poetics of a self-described 'exemplary' funeral oration, the introduc- tion and the extensive commentary offer both a large- and small-scale mapping of the style and rhetorical devices of the text. In the course of doing so, key assumptions about Byzantine 'high style' texts and the manner we interpret them are re-evaluated and alternate paradigms are suggested.

In her wild, manic state of possession by Apollo, the Pythia is said to 'whirl like a bacchant, out of her mind,' bacchatur demens. Why should this priestess, who has nothing to do with Dionysus, be described in overtly Dionysiac terms? By the first century AD, there has arisen in literature a prophetic female type with characteristic attributes accumulated from the literary portrayals of other possessed female figures. These prophetic females become a vehicle by which individual poets can acknowledge and respond to a predecessor, emulating or departing from a prior tradition by manipulation of stock ingredients of the type. Using primarily a philological approach-that is, close reading of various ancient texts-I try to identify the constituent parts of the stock character, disentangling component threads from origins in Greek poetry to culmination in Latin poetry, and finally, to examine how Latin poets explore rearrangement of these components for inter- textual engagement with literary predecessors.

I focus on the professional performer, the rhapsode, and on the changing nature of his training and recitation. I argue that a diachronic under- standing of the rhapsodic profession is possible only when the rhap- sode is seen in his archaic cultural connection to the prophet and in his relation-spanning the archaic and classical periods-to orators and actors. There is a sense in which it is legitimate to view the rhapsaidos 581</page><page sequence="4">Summaries of Dissertations as a sort of prophetis and hypokritis. This work explains why and how this assertion holds true. For the classical period its focus is Athens, whose Panathenaic festival was then the venue for recitations of the Iliad and the Odyssey. Rhapsodic recitation, dramatic acting, and orator- ical delivery were three of the chief performance domains in classical Athens. Each exerted significant influence on the others, an influence whose nature and impact varied with time and which is not reducible to the universals of the performer-audience interaction. At first the rhapsodic trade helped to shape the emerging professional actors: even the label hypokritis was borrowed from the rhapsode. Just as the latter, as hermineus, mediated between the Muses and his audience, so origi- nally the actor was viewed as commenting upon and explaining the song of the chorus. The hermeneutic dimension of rhapsodic perfor- mance and the association between hermineus and hypokritis derived from the well-known kinship between mantic and epic poetry. This kinship also affected how cultural insiders viewed the poetic tradition itself: to it they attached a 'notional fixity,' as if the rhapsode always recited the same poem, when in fact he recomposed his material anew in every performance. I also argue that the sophists' engagement with rhetoric arose in self-conscious imitation of, and competition with, the rhapsodes, themselves the first to make poetry an object of study and commentary. Aristotle acknowledged the link between orators and rhapsodes in his discussion of hypokrisis in Rhetoric 111.1-12, which I analyze in detail against its historical background. Departing from previous scholarship, I read the relationship between 'style' and 'delivery' as one designed to capture the philosopher's concern with rhetoric's oral and auditory dimensions. Alkidamas' On the Sophists recognized the link between orators and rhapsodes too. In both cases, this recognition occurs precisely where the orator's use of written drafts to aid his training and delivery is being considered. This telling coincidence implies that the cultural factors responsible for this tech- nical innovation among speakers were also at work among rhapsodes. Hence, my investigation confirms that the fixation of the text of the Homeric poems was not the result of an act of dictation, but a gradual process driven by the changing performance practices of classical rhapsodes. One final direction of influence between the three perfor- 582</page><page sequence="5">Summaries of Dissertations mance domains extended from actors to rhapsodes and was evident in the increasing theatricality of rhapsodic delivery. The principal drive here was the Athenians" love of drama. This evolution towards the histrionic is traced not only for the fourth century BC, but also among the homiristai of Hellenistic and Roman imperial times. I end by consid- ering the extant record on post-classical performances of epic poetry generally. Degree in Classical Philology 2005 SARAH HITCH-The King ofSacrifice HOMERIC REPRESENTATIONS OF ANIMAL SACRIFICE have often been included in diachronic reconstructions and interpretations of the origins and meaning of this central action in Greek religion, but have not been the subject of an independent, full-length study. This disserta- tion, The King of Sacrifice. Ritual and Royal Authority in the Iliad, isolates the representations of sacrifice on the basis of the terminology and the context. Different terminology is used in the primary narrative and the secondary narrative of character speech, corresponding with shifts in emphasis on separate stages of the ritual performance, creating tension between the optimistic performance of sacrifice as a means of securing divine favor in the primary narrative and the frustration of mortals and immortals expressed in character speech. The performance of sacri- fice within the time of the poem forms a positive demonstration of Agamemnon's domination over the other troops in Akhilleus' absence; he performs or provides for all of the sacrifices in the primary narra- tive, which frame Akhilleus' withdrawal and return in books I and XIX. On the other hand, the gods and heroes complain that sacrifice does not have the power to influence the course of events. Agamemnon laments that Zeus favors the sacrifices of Hector, whilst Zeus laments that Hector's numerous sacrifice have not averted his young death. This narrative tension is most radically reflected in the character of Akhilleus himself, whose commitment to his impending death in the latter half of the poem is signalled by abstinence from and disregard for animal sacrifice.

By focusing on the semantic development of a fictional, non- referential being, the dissertation also contributes to the current debate about the nature of mythical thinking. A survey of the texts and images associated with Scylla shows that the figure eludes definitions in terms of narrative function or phys- ical description. Scylla appears in different types of stories, including the "combat tale" and the "girl's tragedy"; textual and visual sources differ strikingly in their description of her appearance. The identity of the figure thus seems to reside in the abstract combination of three signifies-sea, dog, female-that distinguishes Scylla from other figures of Greek myth and can be actualized in a variety of ways. In Homer, Scylla is one of the many opponents who delay Odysseus' homecoming; the episode is cast as a failed combat tale and sanc- tions Odysseus' inability to go through Scylla's straits unscathed. The Homeric crystallization of the story engages specifically Odyssean concerns including the role of mitis, the importance of direction in navigation, and the fear of being devoured. In 5th and 4th century texts and images, Scylla takes on a more distinctively human component; the anthropomorphic, female hybrid that results from this approach often channels anxieties about female sexuality and offers a counterpart to the figure of the vagina dentata evidenced in other cultures. Roman poetry displays a new interest in the monster's perspective. Most memorably, Ovid's version casts Scylla as the victim of a love story, a maiden who shuns sex and thus gets transformed into a monster. The changes in the semantics attached to Scylla are symptomatic and can be tied to broader cultural phenomena. The success of the figure comes from the metaphoric coherence of its three defining signifies and their ability to address a variety of anxieties connected with hazardous passages and transitions.

Recent readings range from a symbolic religious autobiography to an incongruous collection of titillating stories and a conundrum designed to motivate the reader to undertake a hopeless quest for meaning. The main goal of my disserta- tion is to demonstrate that the gist of Apuleius' humor lies precisely in the contrast between the moralistic potential of the main story-line and the incongruously frivolous manner of storytelling that serves as a means of comic characterization of the novel's primary narrator Lucius. In other words, I interpret the narrative of the Golden Ass as a kind of comedy of storytelling, in which Lucius plays the main part in his two capacities - both as protagonist and as narrator. The first chapter demonstrates that the narrative strategy of Ps.-Lucian's AoKtoloq iq 6voq, universally regarded as an epitome of Apuleius' Greek original, creates the impression that the message explicitly formulated at the end of the tale naturally follows from its story events. In chapter two I show that Apuleius' deviations from the Greek original produce a tension between the narrative as a whole and the religious moral attached to it in the final book. I also argue that Apuleius consciously contrasts the pecu- liar deviance of his primary narrative with narratologically straightfor- ward inserted tales and that, as a result, the incongruously moralistic tone of the final book of the novel begins to sound like a burlesque of moralistic interpretation of literature in general. In chapter three I argue that the contrast between the primary narrative and the moral superimposed on it at the end is further underscored by allusions to philosophers propagating a moralistic attitude to literature (Plato and Plutarch) and by intertextual links with Ovid's Metamorphoses. Finally, in chapters four and five I discuss Lucius the narrator as a comic figure and point to possible antecedents of his different facets in Petronius, Lucian, Plautus, and the Second Sophistic rhetoric.

Most of them date to the late Augustan/early Tiberian period and were found in Rome or its environs. They are unified by their small dimensions and also by a tendency to fill the limited space of their visual field with miniature figures accompanied by equally minute explanatory texts in Greek. The plaques are known by the epithet Iliacae because fifteen of them carry scenes from the Iliad and other poems of the Epic Cycle. Given their provenance, the reliefs of the Tabulae must have been intended to present Greek subject matter, particularly the stories of Greek epic, to a Roman audience. The dissertation focuses on nine Tabulae that offer comprehensive retellings of the Epic Cycle, in which friezes depicting scenes that lead up to the sack of Troy are arranged around a panel showing a bird's-eye view of the city as it is destroyed. Much more than uncritical summa- ries of Homeric epic, the nine plaques combine text and multiple types of visual narrative in order to recast the Troy saga for the world of early imperial Rome. Using ancient poetic and rhetorical texts, modern narratology, and inscriptions that appear on the tablets themselves, this study reconstructs how ancient viewers may have read the tablets' narratives. Comparisons among the nine tablets and a detailed analysis of their different narrative formats reveal that they employ the conven- tions of ancient mapmaking to engage viewers' interest in the ideologi- cally crucial scenes of Aeneas and his family departing from Troy. The study demonstrates connections between the tablets' decoration and the Roman library, and suggests that their small dimensions are a vital part of their meaning, compressing the whole of Greek epic into objects small enough to be held in one's hands.

LIKE OTHER POETS IN THIRD-CENTURY BC ALEXANDRIA, Theocritus strove to create a new kind of literature that offered itself as a sophisti- cated, learned, light, urban alternative to the heroic world of Homer. But instead of turning his back on Homer, Theocritus filled his diverse short poems with Homeric language. Did he simply mean to create a Homeric atmosphere as an ironic backdrop to his innovative pastoral idylls? An intensive study of some 300 Homeric nonce-words in the 31 extant complete poems of Theocritus has shown that the poet often used these distinctive rarities to link passages in his work with highly apposite passages in the Iliad and Odyssey. Not only do these intertexts help define Theocritean bucolic by ironic contrast with heroic epic, they also shed light on the fundamental problem of Theocritus's poly- morphic praxis. His contrapuntal reuse of Homer turns out to occur in his urban, mythological and erotic work, as well as in the pastoral idylls. Intermittently, but often, and with a clearly subversive purpose, he sets up an occult Homeric obbligato, signalled by rare words, which calls into question the surface argument of the poem. This procedure allows Theocritus to covertly mock his lovestruck shepherds and even to satirize the Alexandrian royal family while ostensibly singing their praises. An appendix lists all words in Theocritus that occur in Homer five times or less, with their locations in the Idylls and in the two epics. Degree in Classical Philology 2005 587</page></plain_text>
