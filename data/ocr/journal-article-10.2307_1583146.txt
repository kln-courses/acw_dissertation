Gdttingen, Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1979. 228 S. kart. DM 44.- Dr. Lorenz's new book on Arius must surely be recognized as by far the most impressive and thoroughgoing study of its subject that has yet appeared. It is not written for - beginners; it presupposes some knowledge of the Arian controversy; and it sticks closely to its declared purpose of determining the antecedents of Arian theology. But it opens with three chapters which might rank as introductory. The first outlines the progress of research from Mosheim to the present day. The second presents in tabular form the main points of Arius' teaching, as expounded by Alexander and Athanasius, with an added note on the date of the Thalia. The third offers a preliminary survey of Arius' doctrinal position, and introduces an important claim which will be developed later, namely that the basic point of Arius' system is not an insistence upon the unique majesty of the Father (which he shared with his opponents) but a distinctive Christology. From here on (p. 67) three main problems are discussed. First, Arius' relation to Origen, to his predecessors Philo and Clement, and to his followers, which occupies Chapters 4, 5, and 9; though a penetrating account of Lucian in the last-mentioned chapter makes it clear that his theology shows both agreements with Origen and important divergences, especially in denying the eternal generation of the Son. Secondly, Chapter 6 deals with Arius' relations to groups opposed by Origen, including Gnostics, but concentrating on the Adoptionists, together with Paul of Samosata. This is a well-balanced discussion, which at least makes it intelligible that Arius, despite his use of so many of Origen's characteristic themes, should have repro- duced some features of adoptionist Christology which are present in Paul. Thirdly, Chapter 8 presents a thorough and well-documented account of Arius' possible debt to Judaism. In view of the title of the book, it should be made clear that the author is by no means disposed to over-emphasize this possibility; he treats it with some reserve, and also notes that some points which might suggest Jewish influence are shared by other members of the school of Lucian; so the question of Jewish influence must be shelved until the latter's theology is examined (cf. p. 179), and we are finally told that though not unlikely in itself, it is not to be compared with the pervasive influence of Origen.</page><page sequence="2">300 REVIEWS The level-headed approach and the wealth of parallels adduced will make this a standard work for many years to come; and it will be some time before the author's distinctive theses can be properly evaluated. I myself would confess to just a tinge of disquiet at one or two points. First, it sometimes seems that the author's handling of the evidence inclines to the mechanical; reports of Arius' teaching are collected and processed with the most admirable efficiency, but without always re- calling their context and the purpose for which they were uttered. And there does not seem to be an over-all recognition of the contradictions which this evidence affords. Arius, it appears, was prepared to regard the Logos as the chief of all generated beings, as '(a) mighty God'; but also as simply one of such beings, 'one of the intelligible natures'; and also as just a man, a fallible personality, preserved from falling only by his own moral decisions. All sorts of explanations can be suggested: Arius may have been simply illogical; he may have changed his mind, either sincerely or deviously; he may have been saddled with opinions current among his supporters which he himself disowned; he may (as Dr. Lorenz occasionally admits) have been successfully caricatured by the Nicene party. I feel there is further work to be done here, for which the present study will be an invaluable aid; but it may be that Dr. Lorenz has assumed too readily that the reports of Arian theology can be made to yield a coherent system. Sometimes, it seems, indirect reports of Arius' teaching are treated as quotations,. or preferred to quotations. Thus I cannot see why the phrases set down by Alexander in his letter "Ev6bg b4auog (Opitz, Urk. 4b, ?? 7-10) should be called "Thaliazitaten"; there is no metrical evidence to suggest direct quotation, nor did Alexander have to wait for the Thalia to find out what Arius taught; it is much more likely that he summarized the objectionable points of his teaching before taking action against him, and that Athanasius was later able to confirm this syllabus errorum by quoting from the Thalia. Again, though Constantine's charge of anthropomorphism (Opitz, Urk. 34, ? 26) introduces an impressively learned account of the imagery of God's throne and place, I am inclined to approve the suggestion thrown out in passing, that it may be no more than a piece of polemical opportunism, "berechnete Schauspielerei", p. 168. Once again, I am less confident than Dr. Lorenz that Arius really taught that the Logos was Son 'by appointment' (Oacet) rather than 'by nature' (tpo6at). He</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 301 may indeed have done so - catch-phrases of this kind were certainly used in the controversy without too much reflection, though in fact it is hard to see why divine appointment is so much less than created nature; but then how does one explain the statement that the Son was "not first existing, and subsequently begotten or further establish- ed as Son" (obt -c6v 6rvca 7tp6tEpov, i5o~tpov yEVViWOva i1 ilttK- ntuyovwa Eig ui6v, Ath. syn. 16 = Opitz, Urk. 6 ? 3)? There is of course a certain unreality in the whole picture of a pretemporal adoption which Dr. Lorenz seems to ascribe to Arius: God created a being to serve as his instrument in making the world; one who was not predetermined to be perfect, but endowed with free will; could God, before creating him, foresee, but not determine, how this free will would operate? But the conflict of evidence still needs to be explained. The most arresting feature of the book is its claim that Arius' teaching stems from a distinctive Christology. This claim is developed along several distinct lines. The author explains how Arius will have modified Origen's teaching on the soul of Jesus. Arius, like many of his contemporaries, did not assign him a distinct soul; in Jesus, he taught, the Logos took flesh; but some of the adoptionistic features which appear in Origen's treatment of the soul of Jesus were transferred by Arius to the Logos himself, who is thus made to earn his divine status by good works; on the other hand some of the transcendent attributes of Origen's Logos were transferred to a distinct and higher Logos and Sophia, which are intrinsic and personal attributes of the Father. All this is well worked out, and to my mind convincing. But does it amount to saying that, for Arius, Christology was the deter- mining factor? I think there is still some force in the claim that Arius gave greater weight than his opponents to the need to safeguard the Father's uniqueness; he may even have thought that the sense of personal dependence on the Father, so evident in the Old Testament, was being eroded by Nicenes like Athanasius, who often seems to treat the Father as an unfathomable mystery disclosed only indirectly by means of his Logos. And we might ask for some further consideration of the claim (very carefully qualified as it is on pp. 124-5) that Arius stood in the tradition of a "Christologie von unten". It seems clear that he did point to the human limitations of the Logos as proof of his essential subordination to the Father; he did make his dignity in some sense dependent on his freely enacted decisions. But it certainly seems as</page><page sequence="4">302 REVIEWS if the impression that he taught that Christ was no more than a man was fostered by his opponents; it belongs with the notion that Christ was "merely one of the creatures", which was certainly voiced from the Arian side, but was expressly contradicted by Arius himself. In stressing the importance of Christ's moral decisions, Arius was adverting to problems which could not be adequately treated by the school- book logic of the period; a considered resolve to do right is something that has to be attained and upheld; it cannot be properly described either as a natural automatism or as a mere accident reversible at will. Aristotle had partly seen this (Eth. Nic. iii.5, 1114 a 12 ff., b 16 ff.); contrast c. Ar. ii.28, where Athanasius cosily remarks that anything learnt can be unlearnt, - as if Adam could forget his knowledge and re-enter Eden! And there is at least something to be said for a theology which attaches importance to the human obedience of Jesus and sees it as part of God's total self-revelation to man. There is an under-emphasis at this point in Athanasian theology which might suggest embarrassment. In his judgements of Arius under this heading Dr. Lorenz is possibly a little too conventional and rather less than equitable. I have voiced some doubts and reservations. But my concluding word must be an expression of gratitude for a magnificent book. Ely (Cambs.), Haddenham, 13 Station Road, G. C. STEAD</page></plain_text>
