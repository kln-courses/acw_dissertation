Shuttleworth's study of a novelist's vi- sion of science is darker and denser than those of Levine and Beer. Their George Eliot is a messenger of cultural wholeness; hers is an apostle of hopeless fragmenta- tion. Perhaps because Shuttleworth's in- vestigation does not yield cheery results, her book is not easy to read, though it gains authority as it goes along. The first hundred pages are dry and expository; like the George Eliot she writes about, Shuttle- worth hesitates to announce her bad news clearly. As she gets into the novels, how- ever, and especially as issues of gender and feminism pervade the material, Shuttle- worth relaxes. She claims that in the novels that follow the inhumanly idyllic Adam Bede, organicism becomes a male article of faith, and fragmentation a female historical reality. Just as George Eliot ar- rives at her own, skeptical vision by testing the theory of her male mentors and finding it unworkable, so Shuttleworth casts off the good student's mask to make a clear diagnosis of the impossibility of cultural in- tegrity for a woman who explores her his- torical situation honestly. George Eliot and Nineteenth-Century Science is a clear- eyed, illuminating account of the idealism of science as it confronts the dampening empiricism of a woman's art. NINA AUERBACH * Physical Sciences G. N. Cantor. Optics after Newton: The- ories of Light in Britain and Ireland, 1704- 1840. ix + 257 pp., apps., bibl., index. Manchester/Oxford, N.H.: Manchester Uni- versity Press, 1983. $20. This book is about the genesis and the etiology of the practice and the science of optics during the period following the de- cline and death of Newton. It is restricted to the period from about 1700 to 1840 and to the British Isles. The popular conception is that this was a fallow era in which little scientific activity and no progress took place. According to this view the century was held in the grip of a Newtonian cor- puscularism whose orthodoxy inhibited, if not prohibited, the development of alter- native points of view-or, that Newton himself had solved all problems perceived as being outstanding at that time, leaving little else for the poor natural philosopher to do in optics. Cantor shows us that, like so many other popular misconceptions, this one is indeed ill conceived. He demonstrates that Newton wavered between distinctly dif- fering concepts of the nature of light and its propagation, that these were offered as speculations-queries, actually-and that they were interpreted as fact, if not dogma, by later savants. Cantor identifies not two but four classes of theories concerning the nature of light. Class needs to be stressed as a larger taxon containing various genera and species of theories of light, each subject to some rather fast-moving evolutionary pressures. (Family rather than class would be a des- ignation more consistent with a biological analogy, but let's not quibble.) The first of these classes is what he terms projectile theories, meaning those in which light is described as a stream or flow of material particles ejected by luminous bodies and subject to Newton's laws of motion. Any deviation of these particles from constant, linear motion is explained in terms of forces analogous to the gravitational force but effective over only extremely short dis- tances. (We are reminded of the weak and strong forces of modern nuclear physics.) Newton postulated that color was caused by particles of different sizes and that dis- persion (the separation of a beam of white light into its colorful components by means of a prism) was caused by the differential effect of such forces on these particles. A distinction needs to be made between Cantor's concept of a projectile theory, in which the particles obey the laws of motion, and the earlier corpuscular theory, which we might assign to a fifth class, as- sociated with Pierre de Fermat, among others. This theory endowed corpuscles with a kind of anthropomorphic quality in which they exhibited laziness and sought the route of quickest arrival. Cantor's second class, to which he de- votes a single chapter, comprises what he calls fluid theories. Here Newton's influ- ence is weakest and the Bible and other ve- hicles of revealed knowledge are of greater importance. Light is conceived as a flow of a fluid analogous to, if not connected with, ideas concerning the nature of fire. It is too 245</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS-ISIS, 76: 2 : 282 (1985) easy to dismiss these concepts as unscien- tific, naive, and riddled with superstition and misinformation. Yet we see here for the very first time light as a bearer of en- ergy. The third class contains what Cantor de- scribes as vibration theories. Unlike the fluid theories, in which the ether flows, the vibration theorists conceived a lu- miniferous ether, one that bears and sup- ports the vibration that constitutes light. Cantor points out that its origins lie in Des- cartes's idea of a particulate ether that, al- though stationary, has a "tendency to mo- tion." This is the first of the four classes to appear reasonable from a strictly parochial twentieth-century standpoint. Here for the first time we see a sophisticated application of mathematics that is truly quantitative. Leonhard Euler is the hero of this saga, en- tering the stage from without the book's geographical domain. Light was conceived as being analogous to sound, the ether as being analogous to the atmosphere. It was in this context that experimental evidence forced the conclusion that light, unlike sound, vibrated transverse to its direction of propagation. Here we find problems, such as birefringence and polarization, treated experimentally and quantitatively. The final class that Cantor identifies is the wave theory. Like the vibration theory, it postulates the existence of a luminiferous ether. Three things distinguish the two classes. Most obvious is the notion of the existence of the wave front, which identi- fies Christiaan Huygens as the theory's ultimate origin. With this comes the idea of phase and, more important, phase differ- ences. And finally there is the full appli- cation of mathematical analysis. The most important developments occurred outside the book's defined geographical scope and are associated with P. S. Laplace, Etienne Malus, and J. B. Biot, whom Cantor cate- gorizes as projectile theorists. Thomas Young and Augustin Fresnel are identified as the leading wave theoreticians. How well does Cantor's classification scheme work? Is it possible to gather in- dividual scientists and their ideas into neat, disjoint piles? Is there any value in doing so? I believe that the effect is valuable in that it provides a fixed background, a stage setting if you will, against which we can observe and perhaps even measure the ebb and flow of the individual scientists' ideas. In this sense Cantor's scheme does indeed work. However, in a broader sense it is perhaps too rigid a model. For example, William Rowan Hamilton needs to be cat- egorized as a projectilist (perhaps even a corpuscularist) because of his connection with the use of Fermat's principle. Yet he is in the forefront of nineteenth-century mathematicians. Moreover, his contribu- tions were a signal influence in the devel- opment of the wave theory. In spite of these few reservations, I found this book to be interesting, provoc- ative, and stimulating. I recommend it highly. ORESTES N. STAVROUDIS N. T. Roseveare. Mercury's Perihelion from Le Verrier to Einstein. viii + 208 pp., illus., bibl., index. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1982. $49. Throughout the history of astronomy, to the end of the nineteenth century, astron- omers focused the majority of their atten- tion on studies of the motion of the bodies of the solar system and the fundamental stars that served as a reference frame. The most substantial advance in analysis of planetary motion had come with the de- velopment of Newton's formalism. In the eighteenth century, with the development of the analytic, as opposed to the geomet- rical, approach to the description of phys- ical problems, astronomers found that the new equations of motion could not be solved in closed form, and that approxi- mation techniques would have to be used. With each succeeding generation of astron- omers the number of terms retained in the approximations increased, and the quantity of calculations rose at a faster rate. The precise application of Newton's formalism to the solar system in 1850 in- volved calculation of the interactions of no less than eighteen bodies. Nevertheless, by this time better observations, new discov- eries, and profound theoretical develop- ments convinced astronomers that reliable tables of motion could be constructed. Urbain J. J. Le Verrier, as head of the Paris Observatory in 1854, inaugurated production of a new set of planetary tables less than a generation after the set in vogue had been introduced. In reworking his own Mercury tables of a decade earlier, he dis- covered in 1859 an anomalous advance in the perihelion of Mercury, which he claimed accounted for the discrepancy be- 246</page></plain_text>
