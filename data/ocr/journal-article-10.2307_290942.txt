These remarks are persuasive, but apart from the various constructions that may be put on the nature of "decisive reasons," they do not do full justice to the importance of the problem. If the dialogue is authentic, we have a senile Plato misusing rTOrot, and writing with an old man's arrogance a collection of second- hand and half-misunderstood remarks which cannot be paralleled in the admittedly genuine works; if it is spurious, the dialogue is, with what remains of the early Aristotle, our best source for the philosophy of the older Academy at the close of Plato's life or shortly after his death; and, as such, of supreme importance for tracing the development of Aristotle. If, as we may assume, the writings of Plato were accepted in the Academy as basic doctrine, a kind of thesaurus of unquestioned 7rotro and ideas, and the work of the Academics contained amplifications of those ideas and Ti&amp;roT, or their application to new problems and new fields, these more or less derivative writings competed with each other, but not with Plato, and are therefore to be understood by being compared with each other. It is by examining the Epinomis in this light that its authenticity will be determined or refuted, if it is ever refuted or determined to general satisfaction.9 BENEDICT EINARSON. CHICAGO, ILL. E.

Firenze, "La Nuova Italia," 1938. Pp. 719. This second volume of Professor Mondolfo's revision of Zeller's 5th edition deals with the Ionians and the Pythagoreans. A gen- eral review of Pre-Socratic philosophy in its first period is followed by two hundred pages on the Ionians whereas, following Zeller, the author devotes some four hundred pages to the study of Pythagoreanism. A brief resume of the introductory section, " Carattere e pro- 9 There is little fault to be found with Roeder's interpretation of the actual text of the Epinomis, except that it does not go deep enough. On p. 24, n. 2, however, he counters Jaeger's remark (Aristoteles, p. 26, n. 1) about the ui7ro4vi'juaTa Critias and Megillus have received (Epinomis 980d4f.), "Hier ist man plotzlich mitten im Kolleg," with a reference to Oearpov in Critias 108b4, d6-surely not similar enough to imply a "Kolleg." Oearpov is part of the image of the speaker as 7roL7Tr- (108b5). The Critias further supposes but four persons present, as does the Timaeus, not a numerous enough gathering, one would suppose, to constitute a non-metaphorical OeaTpov. 8 369</page><page sequence="2">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. cesso di sviluppo della filosofia nel primo periodo" (pp. 1-98), will indicate the nature and extent of Mondolfo's additions to the original. First (pp. 1-6), there is a long bibliographical note including a) source material, b) a review of bibliographical hand-books and indices, c) works on the Pre-Socratics usefully classed by general and specific subjects. Zeller's notes are fre- quently expanded but the author's main contribution is made in the form of a long note (pp. 27-98) where, starting with Zeller's thesis, he makes a critical review of the study, bringing it down to the present time, and concluding with a statement of his own views. Finally (pp. 89-98), there is a supplementary bibliography of works upon various aspects of the development of Pre-Socratic philosophy. This method of expansion of Zeller's work is carried through for each of the Ionians and for the Pythagoreans. We have as a result an exhaustive study of suffi- cient importance to stand in its own right, apart from Zeller, as a new work on the subject concerned. It is a huge and com- plex piece of work and one for which the reviewer can only suggest some of the main points with occasional reference to details of the argument. Mondolfo's is a unitarian's point of view; a view which finds a fundamental unity of scientific inquiry, both naturalistic and mathematical, on the one hand, and, on the other, "concezioni generali, suggerite sia dalla speculazione mistica sia dalla rifles- sione sui problemi umani" (p. 45). Thus Zeller is criticized (pp. 50, 57, 71) for failure to take full account of ethical ele- ments in the beginnings of Greek thought. Others are criticized for refusing to reckon with the unified religio-philosophical character (p. 682) of the Pythagorean tradition. The author's own interpretation which attempts' to trace the intricate relation of these apparently disparate elements is one which owes much to the work of such scholars as Joel, Tannery, Burnet, Heidel, Rey. From each of these, taking his departure from Zeller, Mondolfo has preserved something for the formulation of his own conclusions. Jaeger's Paideia, though it appeared too late for the author to consider it in forming his own conclusions, is discussed in an appendix (pp. 80 if.). It is a book which in its conception of the unity of Greek thought has much in common with this one. However, important points of disagreement, along with many of agreement, are listed. For example, Mondolfo divides with Jaeger in holding that the Greeks passed from con- sideration of the human world to the physical universe rather than the reverse (p. 87). His argument is enforced with an interpretation of L&amp;KL'a in the all-important Anaximander frag- ment (Frag. d. Vors. 2A, 9), which he sees as the final stage of the projection of "le nozione dell' ordine giuridico" (p. 89) from: the human sphere to the vaster cosmic sphere. The author's unitarianism has free rein in his discussion of the Pythagoreans. Indeed the synthesis of religion, philosophy, 370</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS. science, and politics is so basic here that we may perhaps look to his study of this school (pp. 288-688) as providing the model for his interpretation of the others. A review of Pythagorean studies and, Mondolfo's own contribution show how widely their scope has been and can be extended. Parmenides, Pindar, Aeschylus, Epicharmus and Democritus, among others, are added to illuminate the few classic references from Xenophanes, Hera- cleitus, Alcmaeon, Herodotus, and the hotly debated testimony of Plato and Aristotle. The author's careful consideration of this material is a convincing demonstration of the wide diffusion of Pythagorean ideas and influences, a diffusion which the sceptics have steadily refused to admit as a historical fact, but which when properly realized provides, as this work shows, a main approach to the whole study of Pre-Socratic philosophy. An illustration of the importance of understanding this diffusion is to be found in the author's analysis of Parmenides' poem as evidence of his close relation to Pythagoreanism (pp. 326 f., 646, 651 f.). Mondolfo holds (p. 651) that the proem is the new truth which has come to the convert from error, i. e. from Pythagoreanism, which last in turn is described in the doxa. It is surprising to find no reference in the detailed discussion to the excellent work of Professor Cornford in this field. Mondolfo believes in an unbroken development (p. 642) of a Pythagorean religious philosophy (p. 472) from early times. Hence concepts such as apjovl'a, Ao'yos Lu'4o(S (p. 669) belong to a pre-Heracleitean stage. Cosmic respiration (pp. 649 f., 670) is at least as old as Xenophanes. Philolaus' (a-rep ev 4povpa (Frag. d. Vors. B15) (p. 472) has both cosmological and an ethico-religious significance. It is related, we are told, to Anaxi- mander's ro 0eLov (cf. pp. 139 ff.) 7reptXEtv acravra KaL 7Tvdra Kvf^ipvaV (Aristotle, Phys. III, 4, 203 B), and to Aeschylus, frag. 70 (Nauck). A full discussion of the Philolaic fragments is given (pp. 367-382) where the author differs from Burnet, Frank, and others in holding that these writings were known to Plato. With the outlines and with many details of this study of Pythagoreanism the reviewer finds himself in close agreement. It does seem, however, that before we can retain confidently within the framework of early Pythagoreanism all that Mondolfo would have us retain we sometimes need a more convincing expo- sition of the historical relation of one theory to another. For example, in the case of theories of the soul four are listed (p. 562): 1) the self-moving soul, 2) respiration as a principle of life, attributed equally to the soul and to the universe, 3) the transmigratory soul, 4) the soul as number, harmony, or com- bination of opposites. The last, if we are to use the Phaedo (85e-86) as a commentary, cannot stand with a belief in immor- tality. Mondolfo's solution, following Rostagni, that the somatic and daemonic division of the soul is an early Pythagorean idea leads to a confusion. In fact it leads to the confusion which 371</page><page sequence="4">AMERICAN JOURNAL OF PHILOLOGY. Zeller tried to dispel and which Mondolfo himself deplores else- where (p. 660), namely, the habit of seeing in Pythagoreanism with Burnet a distinction between matter and form. Moreover, if such a somatic-daemonic theory, inherent in Plato's myth of Er, had been also Philolaus' theory of immortality, why is it not mentioned in the Phaedo where the criticism is made that the fundamental Pythagorean concept aipovla, no matter how you look at it, does not logically support a belief in immortality? The true relation seems to me to be, 1) Mondolfo is right in placing qfvXv-ap,povla and immortality in the Pythagorean tradi- tion; 2) he is wrong in supposing that the Pythagoreans were so acutely aware of a contradiction as to produce the essentially Platonic solution of somatic and daemonic divisions. Plato realized the contradiction, not the Pythagoreans. Finally, the reviewer feels that Pythagoreanism as described here may be placed too quickly in the full current of Pre- Socratic debate, or at least on evidence which is unfortunately doubtful. For example, Mondolfo sees (pp. 314 ff.) in the belief attributed to Xenophanes (Diogenes Laertius, IX, 19) that the substance (ovol4a) of God does not breathe () LE'VTrroL a3varvdv) not a simple declaration against anthropomorphism but a refer- ence to the Pythagorean theory of cosmic respiration (Aristotle, Phys. 213 B). Pindar, Nem. VI, 1 ff. is used by Mondolfo to substantiate this interpretation of early Pythagoreanism. This the Pindar passage can do only on a very technical rendering of 7rVEO,kev. The author goes on then to speak of a Pythagorean dualism of cosmos; and pneuma. He calls it (p. 316) a full dualism as opposed to a Heracleitean demand for unity. Surely we are proceeding here on questionable evidence to a formulation of ideology for early Pythagoreanism which is contrary to the obvious absence of integration frequently noted by Mondolfo himself. Such criticisms as these do not affect the reviewer's estimate of the value of this book. It deserves a place on the reference shelf of every scholar who needs to inform himself upon the literature of the subject and who wants to know where the debate now stands on the multitude of problems which have arisen in this complex field. One is impelled to question the wisdom of Professor Mondolfo's decision (cf. vol. I, pp. 11-14) to publish his work as a revision of Zeller. No doubt the continuity and development of modern scholarship in the field is thus empha- sized. Moreover, the book's value as a reference book is perhaps in this way enhanced. But as far as Mondolfo's own conclusions are concerned, they are frequently so remote from Zeller's, what- ever the latter's intuitions may have been (p. 595), that I believe they would have benefited from a separate and, therefore, less xoluminous statement.
