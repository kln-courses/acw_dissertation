The overall effect of many such works is pictorial-that is, the sculpture is viewed more as a painting than as a three-dimensional object. This is, of course, the same situation with much relief sculp ture, the difference being that sculptures by Louise Nevelson, George Segal, Joseph Cornell, or Kurt Schwitters are assem blages of three-dimensional objects to create freestanding "environments" rather than being carved or cast in high or low relief. Such assemblages vary all the way from the abstract "walls" by Louise Nevelson (Figure 1) or Merzbau by Kurt Schwitters (Figure 2) to the use of real objects and plaster casts of real people to create representational "tableaux"l by George Segal (Figure 3). Nevelson's black walls present cer tain painterly qualities such as chiaroscuro, a surface composi tion (employing shallow space and real shapes rather than suggesting them as in painting), and vertical and horizontal boundaries. (Joseph Cornell's boxes [Figure 4] provide anoth er kind of assembled sculptures using boxes with pictorial qualities.) The Cleveland Museum of Art has received a welcome gift from the Mildred Andrews Fund of an important black wall by Louise Nevelson entitled Sky Cathedral-Moon Garden Wall (Figure 1).2 Nevelson's wooden boxes, reliefs, and walls were developed in an aesthetic milieu which became increasingly flexible as ancient notions of absolute barriers between the various arts gave way before innovators such as Pablo Picasso (Figure 5), Kurt Schwitters (Figure 2), and Max Ernst (Figure 6), among others. By the time Nevelson began constructing her walls, it was generally recognized that materials and techniques are important largely as means for creating forms that reveal con tent and stimulate valuable aesthetic experience. Nevelson moved into new terrain as she used discarded architectural ornaments and random pieces of wood to create abstract forms and symbols. From early childhood Nevelson says she knew that she was going to be an artist. Born in Russia in 1900, she came to this country with her family when she was five years old. Her father became a builder and ran a lumberyard in Rockland, Maine. Thus, the child, Louise Berliawsky, grew up near dark fir forests, surrounded by odd ends of lumber and by a family concerned with construction. When she was twenty she married Charles Nevelson and moved to New York, where she studied painting and drawing Figure 2. Merzbau (detail). Wood, plaster, and other materials, ca. 1923-1943.

She traveled to Europe in 1930 where she studied briefly with Hans Hofmann at his school in Munich and took bit roles in films in Vienna and Berlin. She returned to this country in 1932 and worked as an assistant to Diego Rivera (along with Ben Shahn) on murals for the New Work ers' School. During the late 1940s and early 1950s she again traveled in Europe and Mexico. During these travels she was most impressed by African and Indian tribal sculptures, par ticularly totemic images. In the late 1950s several major museums acquired her sculp tures (Figures 7 and 8); and in 1965 a large, important wall, Homage to 6,000,000 I (Figure 9), was acquired by the Israel Museum in Jerusalem, and a gold wall, An American Tribute to the British People (Figure 10), was presented by the artist to the Tate Gallery in London. The above partial listing of Nevelson's activities and accom plishments serves as a reminder that recognition of her contri bution in the visual arts came somewhat later than it should have, probably because her art did not fit any of the traditional Figure 4.

Sculpture had been defined as a three dimensional form created by carving, molding, or casting. Nevelson's boxes and walls, however, are formed by assem bling already existing pieces of wood and, occasionally, by cutting some of the pieces to be assembled. In addition to the familiar walls, Nevelson has also made freestanding, three-dimensional sculptures in stone, metal, and plexiglass-as well as wood (Figure 11)-and boxes, re liefs, and landscapes.3 Many of the last two types are incorpor ated into the walls which are composed largely of boxes with a variety of objects arranged in their interior. Sometimes the openings are partly or completely covered, sometimes doors are added so that the box assumes a closet-like character, and sometimes the boxes are reversed, presenting a flat surface on which shapes are arranged to create a relief. Some walls are constructed of boxes of the same size (Figure 12), creating a regular, modular pattern. More often, however, they are made up of various kinds and sizes of boxes as well as reliefs and landscapes. Some of the walls are irregular with asymmetrical arrangements of boxes with a variety of wooden shapes attached to their inner-and sometimes outer-walls; others are sharply cut, as if with tools, and are arranged in orderly geometrical patterns (Figure 12). Some are more or less regular and shallow, and others are multiformed, using boxes of various depths. Still others are a combination of these 246</page><page sequence="6">OPPOSITE Figure 9.

Nevelson's walls create environments with a variety of emotional and poetic connotations. Some are painted white and a few are gold, but most are black. The white ones (Figure 13), like wedding cakes, seem to imply purity and dawn (as their titles suggest). The gold ones suggest richness and splen dor (Figure 14). And the dusky, black ones refer to night, shad ows, and mystery with hints of hidden gifts, treasures, or strange totemic figures. Even lighting has a great deal to do with the psychological effect produced by the different kinds of walls. The pure white and glittering gold ones usually respond best to bright light, while the black ones are most effective when dimly lit, some times using blue or violet lights, to increase their air of mystery. The Cleveland Museum's new wall is large but not monu mental; irregular in overall shape with a variety of boxes and images; a combination of clean-cut and uneven, rough shapes; and impregnated with warm, velvety black pigment.</page><page sequence="8">Figure 14.

Figures 15, 16, and 17. Details of Figure 1, Sky Cathedral-Moon Garden Wall. Sky Cathedral-Moon Garden Wall (Figure 1) was done in the years 1956-1959. The boxes are all oriented vertically with the largest on the bottom and nearly centered. It contains an anthropomorphic form (constructed of irregular pieces of weathered wood joined together [Figure 15]). Directly above this box is another of equal width but neither as tall nor as deep. Within it, box ends have been assembled in such a way that they suggest a large moon-like face. Two vertical inden tations (finger grips) refer to eyes, and a horizontal one is in the normal position of a mouth (Figure 16). Between these two boxes and in front of the upper one is an assemblage of the kind called a landscape. Four geometrically shaped blocks are fixed vertically in a line forming a procession before another shape composed of four blocks joined together to vaguely suggest an altar (Figure 17). On the dexter side of the two central boxes, and overlapped 249</page><page sequence="9">by the landscape, are two long, narrow, vertical boxes. The outer and deeper one contains long, ripped strips of wood nailed and glued to the sides and back. The inner one contains thick chunks of wood also mounted on its back and inner sides. Figure 18. Detail of Figure 1, Sky Cathedral-Moon Garden Wall, showing interior of box with door open exhibiting relief. On the sinister side of the central boxes are five others of varying dimensions. Two long, thin, vertical boxes (one with a hinged door) rest atop a broad and short box. The bottom side of the latter is turned out to form a surface on which sharp edged geometrical shapes are fastened to form a relief. (The inside surface of the hinged door mentioned above is also a relief [Figure 18].) Two more boxes-a long, vertical one mounted on top of a relatively short, broad one-form the outside edge of the wall. The bottom one contains sections of two shaped posts and other bits of architectural decoration; the upper one, eccentric but sharply formed shapes. Thus, the boxes on the sinister side contain abstract wooden shapes which are smoothly geometrical and machined; those on the dexter side have rough, irregular shapes; and the two central boxes and landscape exhibit anthropomorphic images. The dark interiors of the boxes allow glimpses of objects and figures. They imply secret places and hidden surprises. Some have pleasant connotations while others seem ominous. The viewer may be reminded of Christmas or birthday surprises, or of primitive and childish fears. The presence in the lower cen tral box, the facial image above, and the ceremonial implica tions of the landscape have already been mentioned. The altar like character of the total wall is even more obvious. Thus, the various boxes, the relief, the landscape, and the partly hidden forms and images combine to suggest an exotic and mysterious ambience. In addition to connotations of things and feelings, the boxes are arranged with attention to scale, visual balance, contrast, and order. Formal themes are repeated, albeit with variation. Considering Nevelson's methods of assembling the walls, this is to be expected. The design of walls such as Homage to 6,000,000 I (Figure 9) must have been planned before con struction. Others, however, seem to have been organized from a stock of already created elements. This latter type is in the spirit of the spontaneous and intuitive creative methods typical of the abstract expressionist artists who are Nevelson's con temporaries. It does not mean that such walls receive less thoughtful organization than those planned in advance. It means only that from a large selection of boxes some inspire the artist to create a wall which acquires a certain character and form during the process of creation. Some of the elements probably existed before the idea for the wall developed, and others were created during its construction. The repetition of formal themes in the Cleveland wall, for example, suggests a thoughtfully organized composition. There are many triangu lar shapes, circles, long vertical elements, and short thick ele 250</page><page sequence="10">ments which appear repeatedly in both rough and clean-cut forms. Since Pablo Picasso's early assemblages, Kurt Schwitters' Merzbau, and Marcel Duchamp's "found objects" and "found objects assisted,"4 many artists have created sculptures by assembling found objects. Yet none predicted, nor have any continued, Nevelson's unique treatment of wooden forms mounted in boxes which are assembled to create walls which function as environments. Furthermore, those "assembla gists" that did precede her in using the same general technique (e.g., Picasso, Jean Arp, and Schwitters) used it in ways and with purposes different from hers. The Cubists, Georges Braque and Picasso especially, made collages primarily for formal reasons (Figure 19), while the Dadaists-Duchamp and Ernst (Figure 6) in particular-used it to produce works with enigmatic, ironical, or satirical content. Nevelson, how ever, has composed boxes and odd assortments of wooden fragments-as a painter might do with pigments-to create images which suggest ineffable moods or emotions: affective experience which can be inferred from the visual forms but which cannot be clearly defined in logical terms. Wood, for example, is a natural material used by many primitive peoples. The sooty black color favored by Nevelson Figure 19. Still Life with Violin.

CMA 68.196 absorbs light, increasing the impression of dimly shadowed places. The anthropomorphic forms suggest totemic images; the long, irregular, vertical shapes imply natural growths or formations such as trees, or stalagmites; and the chunky shapes and crescent forms seem to refer to the moon and stars. Obviously not everyone will respond in exactly the same way to these forms. Each person carries his or her own person ality structure and stock of memories. Works of art such as Nevelson's walls will evoke somewhat different responses from each viewer. Nevertheless, the created images point the normal perceiver's experience in a certain direction while leaving some leeway for individual responses. It seems unlikely, for example, that one would respond to gold walls in the same way that he would to the dusky black ones; the wedding cake-like decorations of the white walls (Figure 13) can hardly evoke the same kind of response as a severely geometrical, shiny, black wall, such as City Reflections (Figure 12). In short, normal viewers must surely agree that certain forms are there, that they have certain characteristics, and that these suggest, in a broad way, certain kinds of feel ings, moods, emotions, or ideas. Beyond this point, however, individual interpretation enters, and, in a sense, the artist and perceiver collaborate to complete the work of art in terms of affective experiences. EDWARD B. HENNING Curator of Modern Art 1. The word "tableau" is used to suggest a representational graphic scene; however, it has overtones referring to the "tableaux vivants" which used to be a part of circus performances. Live people coated with white would assume sculpturesque postures beneath a curtain; when the curtain was removed the motionless, white, sculpture-like tableau was revealed. (The white plaster figures of Segal inevitably recall these tableaux.) 2. CMA 74.76 Sky Cathedral-Moon Garden Wall. Wood, painted black, 1956-1959, H. 85-5/8 inches (217.5 cm.).

The so-called "boxes" are simply wooden boxes in which she composes a variety of forms; they are meant to be hung on a wall or to sit on a flat surface such as a table. "Reliefs" are flat grounds (such as the bottom of a box) to which she attaches forms varying from irregular, rough shapes to severely geometrical ones. "Landscapes" are made by composing vertical shapes, suggesting figures or objects, on a flat, horizontal board. These elements are all displayed and viewed alone in some cases and as parts of walls in other instances. 4. Duchamp's "found objects" include such objects as a snow shov el, a urinal, and a bicycle wheel. "Found objects assisted" include such things as the reproduction of the Mona Lisa with a moustache drawn in and the title L.H.O.O.O. affixed. 251</page></plain_text>
