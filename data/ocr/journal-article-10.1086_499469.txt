      <p>In his latest volume, <italic>In the Beginning</italic> … <italic>Creativity</italic>, Gordon Kaufman clarifies and broadens his argument for thinking of God as “serendipitous creativity.” In doing so, he advances a constructive case for his view of theology as “imaginative construction.” By accomplishing these tasks, this compact book well serves as an introduction to the main themes in Kaufman’s theology while also extending his contribution to the debates regarding the relationship of religion and science.</p>
      <p>Versions of previously published essays stand at either end of three original chapters—a prologue previously published and coauthored with Francis Schüssler Fiorenza in <italic>Critical Terms for Religious Studies</italic> (Chicago, 1998), and an autobiographical epilogue originally presented in a slightly different version (“My Life and My Theological Reflection: Two Central Themes,” <italic>American Journal of Theology and Philosophy</italic> 22, no. 1 [2001]: 3–32). The three original chapters comprising this book refine Kaufman’s case that personal or agential constructions of God are inadequate to the moral demands of our contemporary ecological situation and need to be abandoned. Such views of God are understandable as reflections of the historical human existential priority of the Christian tradition, according to Kaufman, but reinforce an anthropocentrism that tends to “obscure and dilute” the ecological mind‐set and practices our contemporary situation demands (41). In addition, agential models of God are incompatible with evolutionary biological and cosmological descriptions of the world. By reconceiving God as “serendipitous creativity” and emphasizing the human as “biohistorical,” Kaufman intends to present an ecologically adequate, scientifically plausible, and historically conscientious vision of the symbolic polarity at the core of Christian faith.</p>
      <p>These ideas will be familiar to readers already in conversation with Kaufman’s other more recent projects. But he also offers here some helpful clarifications of his main ideas. In chapter 2, for example, he stresses in a new way the ultimately mysterious quality of creativity. Divine creativity is not a “force” within cosmic processes as his early writing in <italic>In Face Mystery</italic> (Cambridge, MA, 1993) may have implied, for that simply exchanges the idea of force for God. “Serendipitous creativity” is the ultimately unknowable, dynamically open, and mysteriously ongoing generative process of novelty. Kaufman argues that this understanding draws from the apophatic tradition of divine mystery and is also consistent with contemporary biological and cosmological theory.</p>
      <p>While clarifying the connection between “mystery” and “creativity” and furthering his argument against theological anthropomorphism, this analysis reveals a critical tension in his project as well. In chapter 1 Kaufman suggested that though his theological reconstruction of God is an alternative to traditional Christian ways of thinking, it also affirms the central Christian idea of the qualitative difference between God and the natural order. In his argument here in chapter 2 that “serendipitous creativity” is not a reifiable force outside cosmic processes but is, rather, a way of acknowledging the ultimate mystery within these processes, this difference is hard to register. This raises the question of whether Kaufman’s theological perspective finally adds anything to the scientific world picture, or whether it is only a theological way of talking about the mystery of the world that the natural sciences have already described.</p>
      <p>In chapter 3, Kaufman also helpfully distinguishes among different meanings and scales of “creativity”: cosmic, biological, and human. The cosmic scale of creativity, what Kaufman refers to as creativity<sub>1</sub>, cannot be regarded as “always manifesting what is ultimately valuable for humans” (60). For cosmic creativity generates, from a human valuational perspective, evils as well as goods. Creativity without qualification cannot be normative. Instead, what is to be normative for our human projects is the creativity manifest on the biohistorical scale of the earth and its environment—creativity<sub>2</sub>. This scale of creativity is normative for the direction of human activity insofar as it reveals, according to Kaufman, an anthropic trajectory of good. For Christians, the aim to conform human life to this biohistorical norm is honored by a christomorphic faith stance, nourished by the biblical images and narratives of Christ and reinforced by the ongoing imaginative constructions of human culture—creativity<sub>3</sub>.</p>
      <p>Again, this analysis clarifies Kaufman’s terms at the same time that it may prompt readers to ask for more. Given the normative role granted to creativity<sub>3</sub>, and especially in light of the reflections Kaufman offers in his epilogue on the influence of his Mennonite background, a productive space is opened for more work on the responsibilities of communities and institutions to form the habits of thought and practice that our ecological time demands. Kaufman’s relative neglect of this need not be interpreted as a weakness in his project. It is, rather, an opportunity for other scholars in the field of religion and science to build on his legacy. Kaufman’s volume is valuable, then, not only insofar as it describes but also insofar as it is itself a generative source of creativity for scholars researching and teaching in the fields of “religion and science” and “theology and ecology.”</p>
