<plain_text><page sequence="1">ILLUSION AND REALITY IN FREUD AND WINNICOTT: Toward a New Psychoanalytic Interpretation of Religion Mary Ellen Ross "Tf cattle and horses . . . had hands . . . horses would draw the forms of gods like horses, and cattle like cattle."1 Xe- nophanes' insight, repeated and elaborated many times in the history of western thought, articulates with special clarity the illusory nature of religious beliefs. But is this quality of illusion necessarily a bad thing? According to Freud it is, and in his analysis the religious universe is woven from illusions that hin- der our ability to act as autonomous adults. Freud employs a psychoanalytic critique: he argues we use religion to escape the burdens of adulthood by harboring the fantasy, developed in childhood, of a strict but loving paternal deity. In exchange for obedience, the deity promises to care for us. Freud holds that religion may render believers passive and that it contains elements of projection. And certainly American history is filled with examples of oppression that appear to con- firm Freud's insight, from the patriarchal assumptions of Puri- tan divines to the racist ideologies of antebellum planters. If God is male, what place can women have in society? And if God is white, what place can blacks have? We must always re- tain an element of suspicion about religion. And yet, as femi- nist and liberation theologians have shown, religion also offers Mary Ellen Ross is Associate Professor of Religion, Trinity University.

Some psy- choanalytic thinkers, including the British theorist D.W. Win- nicott, have shown how we can assess this more positive potential in developmental terms. In this essay, I turn to Winnicotťs work on illusion, play, and creativity to broaden the psychoanalytic depiction of religion. Our accounts of religion must encompass its capacity to op- press and to liberate. After contrasting the views of Freud and Winnicott, I examine the implications of their theories in a dis- cussion first of Alice Walker's novel The Color Purple and then of the Catholic mass. My goal is twofold: to foster a greater ap- preciation of the positive value of religious illusions while af- firming the necessity of a healthy skepticism concerning such illusions. But first I will review the starting-point for all subse- quent psychoanalytic discussions of belief: Freud's conception of religion. Religion as Oedipal In The Future of an Illusion, Freud uses the key psychoanalytic concept of the Oedipus Complex to explain the psychology of religious belief. Freud begins this analysis by pointing to the irrationality of religious doctrines. Since no external evidence exists to substantiate religious beliefs, such beliefs resemble the fairy tales of children. Why, then, do they retain their hold on most of the human race? Because, according to Freud, of their status as "illusions, fulfillments of the oldest, strongest, and most urgent wishes of mankind."2 These wishes arise because life is hard. On some level, we all would like to exist in the freedom of the state of nature, al- lowing our instincts free rein. However, nature matches gener- osity with cruelty, inflicting such a variety of catastrophes on human beings that isolated individuals cannot even begin to cope with them. Because of these threats, people band to- gether to confront natural forces communally and thus increase their chances of survival. But this accommodation, while solv- ing some problems, creates others. To exist in society, a per- son must renounce a good portion of his natural instinctual tendencies.3 He must work when he does not feel like it, limit himself to one sexual partner, and turn the other cheek when he wants to strike back. On top of all of this, the individual's</page><page sequence="3">Illusion and Reality in Freud and Winnicott 467 efforts toward self-protection inevitably fail, for in the end, eve- ryone dies. Adults suffering the cold destructiveness of nature on the one hand, and the constraints of society on the other, generally feel helpless. Their helplessness echoes the vulnerability of childhood, when they experienced themselves as small and weak, dwarfed by older siblings and parents. In that context, the father became the most significant figure in his capacity both to punish and protect, to evoke both fear and love. Adults faced with an impersonal universe yearn for that earlier situa- tion in which their sense of powerlessness was at least some- what assuaged by the promise of paternal protection, and they create gods. Thus, gods and fathers tend to look alike: strong, frightening, and demanding - yet also protective and consoling. This wish for paternal protection that in adulthood manifests itself as religious belief arises for the first time during the oedi- pal period of development, the period from approximately three to five years of age, when the child initially becomes aware of the father as a significant presence in his life. In tying religious illusion to the oedipal period, Freud links it to neuro- sis, for neurosis also origninates during this time. A neurosis signifies that the crises of the oedipal period have not been re- solved, that the individual seeks regressive or illusory satisfac- tions instead of separating from family and moving into the outside world to seek gratification in the sphere of reality. Put in more general terms, the neurotic fails to grow up, and clings to childlike solutions forever. The neurotic persists in defer- ring to the father - although now the father-in-the-head called the superego - and thereby relinquishes the autonomy and freedom of adulthood. The mass neurosis of religion requires that believers give up their autonomy as a group in submitting to the heavenly father, a figure of pure fantasy. For Freud, a fantasy nearly always involves a flight from un- pleasant reality. Except in an occasional essay on art, he avoids linking fantasy with even benign and beneficial creativity. Fan- tasy, for him, provides a refuge for the neurotic who cannot bear to face facts: ... in neurosis . . . there is no lack of attempt to replace a disa- greeable reality with one that is more in keeping with the sub-</page><page sequence="4">468 SOUNDINGS Mary Ellen Ross jecťs wishes. This is made possible by the existence of a world of phantasy, of a domain which became separated from the real external world at the time of the introduction of the reality prin- ciple. ... It is from the world of phantasy that the neurosis draws the material for its wishful construction, and usually finds that material along the path of regression to a more satisfying real past.4 As these words indicate, Freud identifies fantasy and illusion with neurosis, wish, and the dominance of the pleasure princi- ple. He places all these things in opposition to the acceptance of reality. In addition, although Freud did not intend it as such, his analysis of oedipal belief gives us a critique of patriarchy in its hierarchicalism and authoritarianism. At the apex of the oedi- pal hierarchy sits God. Beneath him are the political and reli- gious fathers - priests and presidents - who rule over the father in each family who, in turn, dominates his wife and children. The heavenly father and the more temporal fathers have a re- ciprocal relationship: the image of a paternal deity both re- flects the domination of powerful men on earth and actively reinforces their dominance by lending it legitimacy - after all, if the cosmos itself is partriarchal, shouldn't men rule the state and the family as well? Although oedipal religion reinforces rigid and non-egalita- rian social structures, it appears to offer some security. But this apparent security, Freud argues, is won at too great a cost: it requires that we avoid seeking freedom or autonomy and qui- etly take our place within an oppressively authoritarian social order. We become passive and blindly obedient to the various father-figures who dominate our lives. The world- view of oedi- pal religion demands compliance; criticizing it is defined as blasphemy. Any rebellion or assertion that the world-view op- presses those at the base of the hierarchy - women, children; the poor - is forbidden. Our patriarchal religion renders us alienated and therefore powerless. We create cosmic and social gods, but since the cre- ation involves unconscious projection with its roots deep in our pysches, we are not aware that we have done it. We assume the permanence and immutability of their authority and continue to defer to them, severely limiting our own power to fashion our lives in a rational way.</page><page sequence="5">Illusion and Reality in Freud and Winnicott 469 Religion as Preoedipal Freud's critique captures the developmental essence of op- pressive and authoritarian religion. But the complexity of reli- gious belief calls for multiple interpretations, and looking at religion's preoedipal qualities can provide us with another perspective. The preoedipal period stretches from birth to the onset of the oedipal period. The most important issue that arises dur- ing this time is that of the necessary oscillation between states of separation and fusion. Just after birth, an infant feels contin- uous with her environment, just as she was in the womb. This sense of fusion carries with it feelings of omnipotence: the in- fant senses that all her needs will be met automatically, just as they were prior to birth. A sensitive mother nourishes this sense of omnipotence for at least a few months by responding to the infant's cues and giving her what she needs.5 The infant has the impression, for example, that wishing for the breast will make it appear. The infant, therefore, is not shocked into an awareness of her separateness and helplessness immediately af- ter birth. Gradually, however, as the mother gets on with her life and is absent for increasing lengths of time, the infant comes to adjust to the state of separateness. But no one of any age outgrows the need for feelings of power over the world or moments of fusion with others and the environment. Preoedipal needs, although tempered, persist throughout life. If the infant's caretaker does not allow her the temporary il- lusion of boundarylessness, the infant may suffer from an ab- sence of a sense of self, a feeling of inner emptiness and detachment from her environment. Theorists who focus on se- vere psychiatric disorder refer to this as the schizoid state, here described in the dream of a schizoid patient: He dreamed that he lived in the bottom of a dugout, covered by a steel turret with two periscopes for eyes, two holes for tape- recording incoming sounds, and one hole for broadcasting messages. He appeared calm and unmoved to other people. In himself he felt like a frightened child cowering down inside his dugout. His turret was his depersonalized head dealing with the outer world.6 Winnicott, a member of the object relations school of psy- choanalysis, a school which focuses on preoedipal develop-</page><page sequence="6">470 SOUNDINGS Mary Ellen Ross ment, treats the issues of fusion, separation, and omnipotence in a distinctive way.7 Winnicott is most interested in the in- fant's actualization of his fantasies during play and the implica- tions that this bit of individual history has for communal cultural life. Winnicott describes play in terms of what he calls "transitional objects."8 For the infant or young child, the tran- sitional object - an article like a blanket or toy - becomes a sub- stitute for the mother in her absence. According to Winnicott, the child adjusts slowly to the realization of his mother's sepa- rateness through psychological fusion with the transitional ob- ject. The infant's ability to control the object compensates for the diminution of his sense of omnipotence as his mother be- comes less available. Winnicott calls the area in which transi- tional objects arise "potential space," which exists on the boundary between imagination and fact. Here the infant com- bines his fantasies with the material of concrete reality.9 And herein lies the paradox of the transitional object, for the world presents itself to the infant, and yet the transitional object originates with the infant himself: a father may, for example, give his child a teddy bear, but the child himself gives the bear a name and creates its personality and its past. This construc- tive activity gives the child confidence in his powers of creativ- ity, in his ability to imaginatively mold his world. Moreover, transitional objects are the precursors of all cultural creations; the kind of behavior that occurs in play constitutes the source of all subsequent creative activity. When Winnicott calls cultural creations "illusions," he means that they exhibit many of the qualities of the illusions of infantile potential space. We cannot refer to them as strictly fantasy or reality, for they exist in the area between the two. They fuse the deepest human longings for union with transcen- dent values such as harmony and equality with the materials of reality (words and images) so that these materials can express the ineffable object of longing.10 Religion is not only an illusion in Freud's sense of wish; it is also an illusion in this preoedipal sense of existing on the boundary between real and imaginary. Clifford Geertz's now- classic definition of religion affirms this quality. He says that religion is a symbol-system "which acts to establish powerful, pervasive, and long-lasting moods and motivations in men by</page><page sequence="7">Illusion and Reality in Freud and Winnicott 47 1 formulating conceptions of a general order of existence and clothing these conceptions with an aura of factuality that makes the moods and motivations seem uniquely realistic."11 The " general order" Geertz refers to here is an ideal ultimate order that provides a context for the ordinary and even extraordinary events of life and gives them meaning. It may not ease hard- ship or suffering, but it places them in the midst of an imagined all-encompasing scheme and hence renders them at least com- prehensible. For example, the Navajo curing rite consists of a standard plot which concludes with the healer's identification of the sufferer with the Holy People and the entire cosmic or- der they represent. Although the sick person seldom recov- ers - the most common disease among the Navajo is tuberculosis- describing the illness in terms of this grand scheme makes it more endurable.12 Geertz's definition is grounded in the understanding that religion combines facts and ideals in a creative synthesis; he understands the synthesis as creative because the type of synthesis differs from culture to culture. This kind of illusion differs from what Freud describes in sev- eral ways. For example, oedipal illusion involves a permanent flight from reality, while preoedipal illusion makes the confron- tation of reality and the reaching of maturity possible. This in- terdependence of fantasy and reality is one of the many paradoxes of the preoedipal period. That is, a person acquires the ability to accept reality only if allowed illusion: an infant deprived of the illusion that she can magically create her mother with a transitional object loses confidence in her pow- ers and will eventually lack the capacity for the creativity that makes reality tolerable. A person whose creative potential lies unrealized, a person in the schizoid state, will be so frag- mented, so unable to connect with her environment that she won't be able to face reality at all. Moreover, an important aspect of the capacity to confront reality consists of endowing unfamiliar elements of the external world with aspects of oneself to gain a sense of mastery over one's environment. This breaking down of strict boundaries between inside and outside occurs for both cognitive and emo- tional reasons. Human beings need to think of the correspon- dence between familiar and unfamiliar elements of reality to</page><page sequence="8">472 SOUNDINGS Mary Ellen Ross order experience and prevent chaos. We also have the related emotional need to avoid experiencing the world as alien, dis- tant, intractable. The analyst Marion Milner provides a case study that can serve to illustrate this point. One of her patients, a boy of eleven, was referred to her when he began having trouble in school. She knew he had the intelligence to do his schoolwork and that his problems were emotional. The boy's sessions re- vealed many images of fusion and boundary-destruction, in- cluding numerous references to fire and burning, boiling down, and melting. He began to recover and grow more inter- ested in school when he could project parts of himself onto the school - for example, when the school principal decided to al- low him to form a photography club and hold meetings on school grounds. Milner observes, "states of illusion of oneness are perhaps a recurrently necessary phase in the continued growth of a sense of twoness." Then she asks what happens when these states of oneness do not occur frequently enough: "I think this boy was telling me what may happen is that the world becomes grey, lacking in affective coloring, prosaic."13 Milner also points out that reality is more malleable than classical psychoanalysis would have us believe, and that an art- ist, for example, changes reality by making it confrom to imagi- nation: "The artist is acutely aware of the discrepency between, on the one hand, all the ways of expressing feeling that are provided by the current development in speech and art, . . . and, on the other hand, our changing experiences that are continually outstripping the available means of expression. Thus, she continues, "the artist wishes to cast his private exper- iences in such a form that they will be incorporated in the social world of art and so lessen the discrepancy."14 We can say the same of anyone fortunate enough to have creative work. Moreover, preoedipal illusion does not hinder an individ- ual's autonomy in the manner Freud describes. Rather, it cre- ates in the individual the possibility for autonomy. In his essay "The Capacity to Be Alone," Winnicott addresses the issue of the origin of the autonomy and psychological stability of the mature person. He begins with the observation that, at a cer- tain advanced point in psychoanalysis, a patient will often fall silent for long periods of time. Rather than making the tradi-</page><page sequence="9">Illusion and Reality in Freud and Winnicott 473 tional interpretation that this silence represents resistance, Winnicott argues that it demonstrates progress and hope - for the capacity to be alone begins with the experience of being alone in the presence of another. For most people, it begins in infancy as an attitude of emotional solitude in the presence of a caregiver or symbolic representation of a caregiver such as a crib or stroller.15 Winnicott connects the illusion of the transitional object with the ability of the infant to be alone for brief periods in infancy and ultimately autonomous as an adult. The adult can tolerate and even appreciate solitude because he has introjected the whole of this potential space - this friendly, holding environ- ment - and carries it with him wherever he goes. The capacity to be alone can only arise in the security of a constant relation- ship; independence and dependence are closely related. This insight enriches the psychoanalytic theory of culture by sug- gesting that while illusion in certain forms can deter the devel- opment of autonomy, in other forms it can make autonomy possible. Freud's depiction of the oppressive properties of religion in- cludes his interpretation of religion as a form of alienation. If we turn again to a preoedipal analysis, we can discern another perspective on illusion. Since such an analysis concentrates on the process of creating the illusion rather than the product of the illusion, we can conclude that illusion can actually serve as an antidote to alienation. Take, for example, the lines from the Indian poet Rabindranath Tagore that initiated Winnicotťs in- terest in the subject of play: 'On the seashore of endless worlds/children play."16 This image conveys the sense of illu- sion as an activity rather than a product. Children build castles in the sand and the tide sweeps them away and yet their disinte- gration doesn't matter - only the play itself truly matters. Religion is a form of cultural play, and through this playful illusion we gain a sense of empowerment, of being able to over- come obstacles actively and creatively. Rather than rendering us passive, this sort of illusion gives us a sense of mastery over our lives. We no longer need to accept the sharp distinction between reality and imagination, but can integrate them by act- ing in the cultural sphere. As long as we remain aware of our creations as creations, our illusions can help us overcome alien-</page><page sequence="10">474 SOUNDINGS Mary Ellen Ross ation: they can assist us in fighting the tendency to slip into passivity and the denial of our human powers. From Oedipal to Preoedipal Religion: The Color Purple Alice Walker's The Color Purple offers a description of the shift from a hierarchical oedipal world based on repressive religion to an egalitarian preoedipal one characterized by creative reli- gious illusion. Walker designs a setting in which fathers ini- tially rule over powerless wives and children and gradually transforms this to preoedipal space in which paternal authority has faded to insignificance. Over the course of the novel, op- pressed characters become active and the oppressors become gentle and nurturing; previously unbalanced relationships be- come symmetrical. The novel consists of a series of letters that Celie, a poor black woman, writes to God. She writes the first letter after her father rapes her. As a result of the rape, she bears a child, and when her dying mother asks her who the father is, she answers, "God," because her father and God are the only men she knows, and she wants to protect her mother from the truth. Walker here makes explicit the equation of God and father and alludes to the way a paternal image of deity both legitimates male power and violates women. These themes reappear throughout the first half of the novel. First Celie's father repeatedly beats and rapes her and then he hands her over to "Mr. " to marry. Mr. continues the abuse. At first Celie adopts the strategy of obedience. She submits to Mr. 's blows and the demands of her stepchil- dren. Fearing retaliation, she refuses to talk back, and she finds support for her passivity in religion. She says to her daughter- in-law Sofia: "Well, sometime Mr. git on me pretty hard. I have to talk to Old Maker. But he my husband. I shrug my shoulders. This life soon be over, I say. Heaven last all ways." Sofia replies, "You ought to bash Mr. head open. Think bout heaven later."17 The world Walker depicts gradually changes from this oedi- pal one to a preoedipal realm in which hierarchy is levelled and women and their relationships with each other move into the foreground. The shift begins with the entrance of the blues</page><page sequence="11">Illusion and Reality in Freud and Winnicott 475 singer Shug Avery, Mr. 's lover. She comes to stay with Celie and Mr. to recuperate from an unspecified illness. At first, Shug has nothing but disdain for Celie, whom she perceives as weak and passive. Gradually, however, as Celie nurses her back to health, the two become close; eventually they become lovers. Walker alludes to the preoedipal character of their relationship by depicting it as a mother-daughter rela- tionship with both women alternating roles: "She says, I love you, Miss Celie. And then she haul off and kiss me on the mouth. . . . Then I feel something soft and wet on my breast, feel like one of my little lost babies mouth. Way after awhile, I act like a little lost baby, too."18 This relationship changes Celie's life with redemptive force. Shug's love gives Celie happiness and hope, and with Shug as a model, she develops the capacity for courageous action. Her shame turns to anger, and she actively defies those who have denied her her freedom. For example, at dinner one night she announces to her family that she will leave home and follow Shug to Memphis. When Mr. expresses his dismay, she says: "You a lowdown dog. . . . It's time to leave you and enter into the Creation. And your dead body just the welcome mat I need. Say what? he ast. Shock. All round the table folkses mouths be dropping open."19 The incident at the dinner table highlights the fact that while Celie and Shug have a relationship that includes preoedipal el- ements, it does not repeat preoedipal themes in a simple way. This bond does not involve a regressive return to an earlier period: rather, it allows Celie to appropriate the resources of the preoedipal stage to progress forward into autonomous adulthood. Celie does not become dependent on Shug in the way an infant relies on its caregiver; her trust in Shug is trans- formed into trust in herself and in the world. This trust gives Celie the strength to deal creatively with surroundings that threaten to crush her if she is not courageous and inventive. Celie's new strength ultimately allows her to accuse even God. When she discovers that the man who molested her was actually her stepfather, and that her real father was lynched, driving her mother insane, she says: "My daddy lynch. My mama crazy. All my little half-brothers and sisters no kin to me. My children not my sisters and brothers. Pa not pa. You</page><page sequence="12">476 SOUNDINGS Mary Ellen Ross must be sleep."20 Disgusted, she stops addressing her letters to God, and begins to write her sister Nettie, a missionary in Africa. But Celie doesn't abandon religion. Indeed, through her conversations with Shug, she reaches a new conception of God. One day Shug says, "When I found out that God was white and a man, I lost interest." She goes on to describe a religious ex- perience that revealed to her that God is neither white nor male: ". . .one day when I was sitting quiet and feeling like a motherless child, which I was, it come to me: that feeling of being part of every thing, not separate at all." She continues, "I knew that if I cut a tree my arm would bleed." This experience led Shug to conclude that God is a part of everyone and every- thing, and also what binds everything together. She never again thinks of God as a person sitting in heaven.21 With Shug's help, Celie moves from a religion of alienation to a religion of autonomy. She no longer sees God as an old white man in the sky, as a distant figure who judges her and tells her she deserves her pain; she now knows God is every- where, including within her. This gives her strength and confi- dence, including the confidence to leave home and travel to Memphis. The novel ends with the reunion and reconciliation of all the characters. The hierarchical distinctions between men and wo- men have disappeared: even the two most submissive women, Celie and Squeak, live independent lives, and both sexes share the nurturing activities of cooking, cleaning, and caring for the sick. Mr. , the least sympathetic character, has grown compassionate, and one of the last scenes depicts him sitting on the porch with Celie while she teaches him to sew. At last Celie's social world has become an egalitarian community that mirrors her religion, which in its creativity, liberty, and mutual- ity resembles Winnicotťs illusion more than Freud's. Ritual Illusion Ritual also can have the characteristics of oedipal illusion; the Roman Catholic mass provides one example. For instance, we can see in the introductory hymns to the mass an attempt to maintain ties to a god explicitly addressed in paternal lan- guage: "Lord God, heavenly King, almighty God and Father/</page><page sequence="13">Illusion and Reality in Freud and Winnicott 477 we worship you, we give thanks, we praise you for your glory."22 The love and admiration expressed here are followed with the admission of guilt and the plea for forgiveness and protection emerging in the Penitential Rite: Lord, we have sinned against you: Lord, have mercy. Lord, show us your mercy and love and grant us your salvation. May almighty God have mercy on us, forgive us for our sins, and bring us to everlasting life.23 These liturgical segments portray God as a stern and demand- ing but also forgiving father and thus fit Freud's description of the deity as a projection of childhood memories and wishes. This deity can assuage feelings of helplessness and "bring us to everlasting life" because of his paternal power and authority. From the Freudian perspective, this flight into fantasized secur- ity could only be considered a form of neurotic dependency. In addition, we can see in the Roman Catholic mass the same maintenance of hierarchical social relations that Freud detected in all religious illusions. During the mass, believers confirm their willingness to obey God and, by implication, their submis- sion to Goďs religious and secular representatives on earth. The theme of the reconciliation of humans with God makes possible the reconciliation of believers with all authorities, for in the mass, God serves as a synecdoche for all authority. The mass can thus function as a socially-conservative force that defuses human anger and renders believers passive. But while the mass certainly contains these negative pos- sibilities, it also functions as an illusion in the more positive sense. For example, one of the most prominent themes of the mass is fusion. The alternate name for the ritual, communion, implies that the overcoming of separation among believers and between believers and God is a central element in the cere- mony. This segment of the Nicene Creed emphasizes the theme of unification: (We believe in) the Holy Spirit. . . who spoke through the prophets; and in one holy catholic and apostolic Church. We confess one baptism for the remission of sins; we look forward to the resurrection of the dead</page><page sequence="14">478 SOUNDINGS Mary Ellen Ross and the life of the world to come.24 Here believers affirm their unified community ("one holy cath- olic and apostolic church") with its common past, present, and future. Their affirmation occurs in an egalitarian context, for all share the state of sin and all are redeemed through God's action in baptism. No one is better or worse, higher or lower, than anyone else. This movement toward unity echoes the child's quest for unity in the context of transitional space. For the child, the de- sire for unity is the desire to retrieve the lost unity of earliest infancy; for the adult, this desire has been transformed over the course of development to the less specific longing for connec- tion with a community and the transcendent principles binding the community. This longing is satisfied not only with the re- petition of the Nicene Creed but also with the participation in the communal meal itself, which symbolically unites each be- liever with Christ's body and with each other believer, follow- ing Paul's statement "Because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread (I Cor. 10:17). The communion of the mass overcomes not only separate- ness within the believing community; it overcomes the separa- tion of imagination and fact as well. Turning again to the Nicene Creed: We believe in one God the Father almighty. Maker of heaven and earth, of all things visible and invisible; And in one Lord Jesus Christ. . . who for us human beings and our salvation came down from heaven. . . and became a human being. . . (he) will come again with glory to judge the living and the dead.25 If we combine these statements with the segment of the creed quoted earlier, we can discern the basic story: God made the world, spoke through the prophets, became human, and will come again. Here mythical, imaginative events (God's creation of the world, God's reappearance at the end of history) and historical events (the preaching of the prophets, the ministry of Jesus) are affirmed as part of a meaningful whole. This sophis- ticated linking of reality and fantasy has evolved from the in- fant's rudimentary fusion of hope and fact in the context of</page><page sequence="15">Illusion and Reality in Freud and Winnicott 479 potential space. But although the adult's ritual participation is a more abstract and complex use of potential space than the infant's play, the former has its roots in the child's imaginative experimentation. Moreover, ritual action, like child's play, imparts a sense of mastery over external reality. During ritual, worshippers make a hoped-for world appear: they experience what Milner calls moments of oneness that make mundane reality more tolera- ble. This is especially true in the liturgical treatment of death. While the reality of death - specifically Jesus's death - is af- firmed in the Nicene Creed, the final victory over death is also confirmed in the announcement that he rose from the dead af- ter three days. Thus the ritual illusion, like the preoedipal illu- sion, makes reality bearable by making it seem partially controllable - in other words, by offering hope. But ritual doesn't merely make reality more tolerable; in a more positive sense it engenders creativity. A ritual, in provid- ing a model of an ideal world beyond separation and death, of an egalitarian and harmonious reality, inspires creativity once it ends, and thus greatly enriches the culture that exists outside the realm of sacred time and space. This creativity can assume a form indirectly related to ritual, as in a painting on a secular subject, or can clearly repeat the structure and content of rit- ual, like ancient Greek drama. The ambiguity and complexity of religion call for a variety of analyses. Freud's depiction of religious illusion as a force for domination and deception speaks to a significant potentiality of religious belief, but his critique exhausts neither the subject of western religion nor the method of psychoanalysis as a way of comprehending it. If we look to psychoanalytic studies of the preoedipal period, we can find resources for comprehending the origins of theological narrative, ritual, and other forms of religious expression in their capacity to foster freedom, inven- tiveness, and self-sufficiency.</page><page sequence="16">480 SOUNDINGS Mary Ellen Ross NOTES 1 .

See, for example, Erikson's discussion of the relationship of preoedipal trust to the institution of religion in Children and Society (New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 1963) 247-51. 8. D.W. Winnicott, Playing and Reality (London: Penguin Books, 1971) 1. 9. When I use the word "reality" here and in the remainder of this essay, I do not mean some abstract and ahistorical entity, but the state of specific culture, located in a particular time and place. 10. The problem of the relationship of new illusion of the individual to es- tablished and communal cultural illusions is a difficult one, involving questions such as how the individual exchanges personal illusions for cul- tural symbols and how the cultural symbols arise in the first place. Win- nicott never addresses these problems in detail, but they have been discussed elsewhere. For example, see William James, The Varieties of Reli- gious Expérience (New York: Penguin Books, 1983); Max Weber, On Cha- risma and Institution Building, ed. S.N. Eisenstadt (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1968); Rudolf Otto, The Idea of the Holy (New York: Ox- ford University Press, 1958); and Paul Tillich, Theology of Culture (London: Oxford Unviersity Press, 1959). Although these issues have received much attention, they are far from resolved, and I unfortunately cannot resolve them in the space of a short eassy. 11.
