This is to particularly be used for true devotional for the activities state of Maha- is an important and long-enduring art tradition in India. This is particularly true for the state of Maha- rashtra, which is home to a number of well-known rock-cut sites, including Ajanta, Elephanta, and Ellora. Of these sites, Ellora is perhaps the most noteworthy for its large number of caves and the fact that it is a multi-religious site, exhibiting ritual spaces for three of India's indigenous religions: Bud- dhism, Hinduism, and Jainism. As the site spans in date from the late sixth to the tenth century CE - with renewed activity in the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries - many dynasties are often associ- ated with Ellora's excavations.1 Although Ellora's monuments are often considered to be the product of royal patronage, this attribution is based on limited inscriptional evidence and the assumption that royal funding was necessary to sustain such extensive excavation activities. In this article, I would like to reconsider the source of patronage at the site from the mid-eighth through the ninth century - a time when a dynasty of kings known as the Rästrakütas attained paramount sovereignty over the region. While I will briefly note the problematic epigraphical material associated with Ellora and the Rästraküta kings Dantidurga and Krsnarãja I, my examinations will focus on the art historical evi- dence at the site, for it is Ellora's monuments themselves that are the most reliable sources of infor- mation regarding issues of patronage. Donative images depicting acts of devotion are, for example, especially evident in Ellora's Jain caves. While most scholarship focuses on the site's Hindu and Buddhist monuments, very little atten- tion has been paid to Ellora's Jain caves. The Jain caves are located at the northern end of the site and they date primarily to the ninth and tenth centuries.2 Though they are an important visual record of Jain artistic and devotional activities in early medieval India, they are generally treated in the schol- arship as extraneous additions to a previously established sacred site.3 While the Archaeological Sur- I These include the Kalacuris, the Calukyas, the Rastrakutas, and the Yadavas. 2 Though the vast majority of excavation work appears to have been conducted during the ninth and tenth centuries, three Jina reliefs at the site appear to date much earlier. These reliefs were created when the artists first cut into the rock to form the large complex of caves commonly known as the Jagannãtha Sabhã. I am currently working on a detailed study of these Jina sculptures and their importance for dating initial Jain activity at the site. 3 Excavation activity at Ellora began in the late sixth century with a few Šaiva monuments. Approximately nine exca- vations date from this period, and in terms of their architectural plans and imagery they have some similarities with Cave i at Elephanta. A single cave (Cave 14) was most likely dedicated to the goddess Durgã and was carved in the early seventh century. For a relative chronology of Ellora's earliest caves, see Walter Spink, "Ellora's Earliest Phase," Bulletin of the American Academy ofBenaras 1 (1967): 11-22. While Cave 14 was under way, work began on the Buddhist monuments. There are twelve Buddhist caves at Ellora, located at the southern end of the site and traditionally dated from 600 to 730 CE. For an iconographical study of the caves and their imagery, see Geri H. Malandra, Unfolding a Mandala: The Buddhist Cave Temples at Ellora (Albany, N. Y. : State University of New York Press, 1993). During the mid-eighth through the tenth century, excavation activity continued to flourish, though the caves from this period belong to the Hindu and Jain religious traditions. Most publications on this phase of activity focus on the Kailãsanãtha 181</page><page sequence="2">vey of India (ASI ) has recognized five Jain caves at Ellora (identified as Caves 30-34), there are, in actu- ality, twenty-three individual excavations (figs. 1-3). The larger figure takes into account the number of excavated spaces that have shrines carved into their back wall and thus provide a place for worship activities. The complexity in the layout of Jain devotional spaces at Ellora has been noted by José Pereira in his book Monolithic Jinas : The Iconography of the Jain Temples of Ellora (1977). 4 To date, this is the only published monograph on Ellora's Jain monuments. In this article, I utilize Pereira's sys- tem of numbering the Jain caves as it more precisely identifies individual excavations and their shrines within the larger complexes recognized by the ASI.5 Another contributing factor in the relative neglect of the Jain caves is the manner in which India's rock-cut monuments are studied. Scholars interested in Indian Buddhism tend to examine only Bud- dhist caves while those interested in Hinduism primarily focus on India's Brahmanical monuments. Due to this bias, India's rock-cut excavations are studied in isolation according to religious affiliation. This separation has had a detrimental impact on studies of Ellora because it denies the site's dynamism as a multi-religious center. It also obscures how the site developed, as work on these monuments tended to cross religious boundaries. This was particularly true during the ninth century, when exca- vation activities focused on both Jain and Hindu monuments. How these monuments affected one another in terms of the employment of donative imagery is briefly addressed in this paper.6 The neglect of the Jain monuments at Ellora is, however, most apparent in regard to the sculpted imagery, despite the fact that there is a great variety of visual forms. For example, housed inside the main shrines and carved into the sidewalls of the excavations are images of Jinas. Jains venerate a group of twenty-four teachers known as Jinas who have achieved liberation by means of conquering their attachment to worldly pursuits. The term Jina means "victor" or "conqueror," which emphasizes the difficult path leading to spiritual deliverance from the cycle of rebirth ( samsãra). As spiritual victors, these teachers have not only conquered samsara but have also become victorious in attaining omni- temple. Significant contributions include: M.K.

The second complex of caves is carved to the northwest and is known as the Jagannãtha Sabhã, with six individual excavations numbered J21-J26 (fig. 3). A rock-cut monolithic temple, called the Chotã ("little") Kailãsa, and its subsidiary excavations form its own group. The final monument is J4, a large but unfinished cave-temple located between the Chotã Kailãsa and the Indra Sabhã complex. 6 For a detailed analysis of shared conceptions and articulations of sacred space between Ellora's Hindu and Jain mon- uments (specifically the Kailãsanãtha and Chotã Kailãsa), see Lisa N. Owen, "Absence and Presence: Worshipping the Jina at Ellora," in Archaeology and Text : The Temple in South Asia , ed.

Prior to their final liberation and com- plete withdrawal from the world, all Jinas give a sermon based on this knowledge in order to estab- lish the path leading from the phenomenal world to one of ultimate release. For this reason, Jinas are also called Tlrthañkaras, or "makers of the ford or crossing place. " It is through their teachings, which are left behind and propagated by mendicant leaders ( ãcãryas ), that the Tlrthañkaras establish the crossing place for others to attain liberation. In addition to denoting a ford or crossing place, the term tïrtha can also refer to the four components of the Jain congregation: Jain monks (munis or sãdhus ), nuns (ãryikã s or sâdhvïs), laymen (srãvakas), and laywomen (srãvikã s).7 Thus the Tlrthañkara is also considered to be the "maker of the Jain community." Images of the Jina, or Tlrthañkara, are always depicted seated or standing in meditation. They visu- ally portray one of the "goals" of the religion, namely the attainment of a liberated state, free from the effects of karma. However, because the representation of the meditating Jina did not significantly change after its emergence in some quantity in the first century CE , Ellora's ninth- and tenth-century images, if discussed at all, are often dismissed as conservative, repetitive, and in general, uninterest- ing. The consequences of this narrow view are many and have been addressed by Janice Leoshko in a number of articles.8 She notes that the relative neglect of the Jina image in comparison to Buddhist and Hindu imagery reveals a bias in art historical inquiries towards the unique or innovative art form. Through her work in this field, it has certainly become clear to me that a re-assessment of the treat- ment of Jina images is a pressing need. For example, rather than viewing these images as "conserva- tive" or "repetitive" we might consider the success of these forms because they haven't significantly changed over time. In addition, we can consider the powerful effect of literally being surrounded by Jinas in Ellora's excavations. The general dismissal of the Jina image as a significant visual form has also resulted in the neglect of the small devotee figures that are sometimes represented alongside the Jina. These human figures typically flank the Jina and make gestures of homage. It is through an examination of such figures (identified in a few cases via inscription as the donors of the sculpture) that we can begin to formulate questions regarding Jain patronage and religious practice at the site. Moreover, this type of examina- tion can serve as a framework from which to view the Hindu and Buddhist caves and their construc- tions of devotional and/or donative activities. Of significance, this approach will concentrate on what is manifested at the site rather than on an overarching dynastic affiliation of the caves. Before exam- ining Ellora's donative imagery, however, it is necessary to briefly outline how most scholars approach the issue of patronage at the site. 7 As members of the Jain community occupy various places on that crossroad towards liberation, they too can be con- sidered a tïrtha.

Even though excavation activity spanned over four centuries, there is only one inscription in situ that ties the site to a specific dynasty of kings. This dynasty is the Râstrakùtas, a powerful lineage of rulers who controlled much of peninsular India from the mid-eighth through the tenth century.9 In this section of the article, I would like to re-assess the evidence of Rãs trakùta patron- age at Ellora during this period. Specifically, I will question whether two kings, Dantidurga and Krsnarãja I, were actual patrons at the site, or whether their ties to Ellora were more along the lines of visiting and using the caves for ritual and political purposes. The earliest epigraphical evidence that links the Râstrakùtas to the site are the Ellora plates of Dan- tidurga dated 742 С E . These plates, which were found at Ellora, record a gift of a village by Dantidurga to some brahmins from Gujarat.10 According to the titles listed in the grant, Dantidurga was still a powerful feudatory of the Cãlukyas at this time.11 The transaction of the gift was made at the site - identified as Elãpura - after Dantidurga had purified himself by bathing at the Guhešvara tirtha , the sacred pilgrimage place of the "Lord of the Cave." This ritual ablution may have taken place in the body of water formed by the waterfall adjacent to Cave 29, one of the earliest Hindu excavations at the site dating to the late sixth century.12 The name Guhešvara is also significant as Ellora is recognized today as the tirtha of Ghrsnešvara, one of the twelve jyotirliňgas of Šaivism. While the antiquity of these associations needs to be further investigated, this record nonetheless clearly demonstrates that Ellora was an important site for Dantidurga prior to imperial Rästraküta dominance in the region. Dantidurga's involvement at Ellora as an independent sovereign is recorded in an inscription engraved on the west wall of the Nandi pavilion (also called the nrtya mandir) preceding the Hindu Cave 15. Througout Ellora's monuments, this is the only inscription in situ that links the site with any royal dynasty. The epigraph begins with an invocation to Siva and continues with a genealogy of the Râstrakùtas.13 The list of kings and their meritorious deeds ends with Dantidurga, who is praised for his military might in defeating the Cãlukya king Klrtivarman II, and for subjugating the kings of 9 For a good overview of the lineage and activities of the Rästraküta kings, see K. A. Nilakanta Sastri, "The Rãshtra- kütas," in A Comprehensive History of India , vol. 3, part 1, ed. R. C. Majumdar and K. K. Dasgupta (Calcutta and New Delhi: Indian History Congress, 1981), 440-84; and Ronald Inden, Imagining India (Oxford: Blackwell Publishers, 1990), 213-70. 10 S. K. Dikshit, "Ellora Plates of Dantidurga: Saka 663," Epigraphia ìndica 25 (1939- 40): 25-31. The village is identified as Pippalãla, which may be associated with the modern village of Pimpral, about 53 kilometers from Ellora. il Dantidurga's titles include mahãsãmantãdhipati ("high lord among tributaries") and prthivïvallabha ("beloved of the earth"). According to S. K. Dikshit, the latter title was used by important feudatories of the Cãlukya and Rästraküta dynasties. Ibid., 26. 12 Spink, "Ellora's Earliest Phase," 11. It should be noted that the vast majority of Hindu excavations at Ellora are dedi- cated to Siva. 13 The kings include: Dantivarmä, Indrarãja (I), Govindarãja (I), Karkarãja (I), Indrarãja (II), and then Dantidurga. The first two kings probably reigned at the beginning of the seventh century. For the inscription, see James Burgess, Report on the Elura Cave Temples and the Brahmanical and Jaina Caves in Western India , Archaeological Survey of West- ern India 5, 1877-80 (London: Trübner &amp; Co., 1883; reprint, Varanasi: Indological Book House, 1970), 87-89. 184</page><page sequence="5">Kañcl, Kaliñga, Košala, Mãlwã, and Lata, among others. Although the Cave 15 inscription is undated, the consolidation of control over these areas - as well as Dantidurga's newly acquired status as srïval- labha (the "Beloved of Sri")14 - suggests a date of around 750 CE . Also contained in the record is a brief description of a great gift ceremony ( mahãdãna) that the king performed in the ancient capital of Ujjayinl.15 The performance of a mahãdãna ceremony typi- cally included the gifting of gold and precious jewels to one's subjects.16 It was also through this cer- emony that the king became endowed with a "divine body," a body infused with what Ronald Inden calls "the luminous will of Vishnu."17 As such, the mahãdãna ceremony established the king as ulti- mate sovereign over all of India - and indeed the world. Thus the inclusion of this act in the epigraph of Cave 15 clearly articulates Dantidurga's new political relationship to the site: Dantidurga is no longer a feudal king but the paramount overlord, the "Beloved of Sri." This designation seems to be the instigating factor in inscribing the epigraph, as no other subject is mentioned in the remaining verses. Of significance, there is no mention of Dantidurga commissioning a temple nor granting land to brahmins. The record, which is left unfinished in the thirtieth verse,18 only states that Dantidurga stayed at the site with his troops.19 Moreover, the decision to carve the epigraph at Ellora was most likely fueled by the fact that the site was known and used by Cãlukyan kings in the early years of the eighth century.20 The inscription carved on the monolithic pavilion of Cave 15, therefore, served as a visual proclamation of Rästraküta dominance at the site. The art historical evidence of Cave 15 also raises questions about Dantidurga's assumed role as patron. The large, two-storied excavation is dedicated to Siva, not to Visnu as we might expect given 14 Šrivallabha , or simply vallabha , was a title used by Cãlukya kings and appropriated by the Rästrakütas. It proclaims the king as the "beloved" or "favorite" of /ri" (fortune or wealth). Sri is also the name of one of the female consorts asso- ciated with the Hindu god Visnu. Parallels between the king and the god Visnu are further articulated in Rästraküta inscriptions in which the kings themselves are described as earthly manifestations of Visnu. For examples pertaining to Dantidurga, see Inden, Imagining India , 245. For the title srïvallabha used by Dantidurga in the Cave 15 inscription, see Burgess, Report on the Elura Cave Temples, 88, v. 23. 15 Burgess, Report on the Elura Cave Temples, 89, v. 26. According to Bhagwanlal Indraji's transliteration recorded in Burgess' Report, the Sanskrit reads: dattam yenojjayinyãmapi nripatimahãdãnamãscharyabhãtam nyãyyam samchintyadïp- tadyutibahukanakam ratnamuktãvatarhsam mãnikyãkírnnamanyam divasamaviratatriptadínãrthisãrtham karttum krídãma- pürvvämaparanripatibhih svapnakãlepyanãpyãm . 16 According to an inscription by a successor of Dantidurga, the king performed the "Golden Embryo" ceremony ( hiranyagarbha), which ushered in not only a new royal era but a new Golden Age ( krtayuga). For this inscription, see D. R. Bhandarkar, "Sanjan Plates of Amoghavarsa I : Saka-Samvat 793," Epigraphia Indica 18 (1925-26): 235-57. The inscription is also discussed by Ronald Inden in Imagining India , 247-48. However, it should be noted that Inden col- lapses the information contained in the Sanjan plates with that recorded in Cave 15. The epigraph in Cave 15 only men- tions a mahãdãna , not the hiranyagarbha specifically. 1 7 Inden, Imagining India , 248. 18 The unfinished state of the inscription is usually explained as a result of Dantidurga's untimely death. 19 Burgess, Report on the Elura Cave Temples, 89, v. 29.

Despite the dedication, six over-life-sized reliefs featuring Visnu and four of his avatãrab have been carved into the southern side of the upper story excavation. These reliefs gave rise to the more popular name of Cave 15, the Dasãvatãra. Both Dantidurga's inscription and the presence of Vaisnava iconography prompt Inden to characterize the monument as the king's "grande finale," his final act in becoming the paramount sovereign. According to Inden, Major temples were not built by just anyone or at a miscellaneous 'auspicious' time. The building of a temple was undertaken, in this period, as part of the conquest of the quarters itself, what we might call its grand finale. Dantidurga topped off his conquest of the quarters with the cave shrine at Dasavatara. He thereby attempted to complete himself as the new king of kings and paramount overlord of the entire earth. More importantly, by participation ('devotion', bhakti) in his over- lord, the god he and his preceptor and the major devotees of the religious order ('sect') took to be the true cosmic overlord in and for the dynastic era he had inaugurated, he would transform his very being, moving closer and closer to union with that god.21 Yet a closer inspection of the imagery and layout of Cave 15 does not fully support the idea of the Dasã- vatãra functioning as Dantidurga's grand imperial statement. Carved on the bracket-capitals of the veranda pillars on the upper story excavation are images of seated Buddhas (figs. 4, 5). They measure approximately 30 centimeters in height and can be seen from the courtyard floor. They exhibit some of the typical iconographical features of Buddha images at the site, namely snail-shell curls of hair, elongated earlobes, and hand gestures such as dhyãna mudrã (med- itation) and bhumisparsa mudrã (earth-touching). Given the practice of carving cave-temples from the top down and from front to back, these images and the pillars themselves most likely constitute a rel- atively early phase of excavation for this complex. The presence of these images certainly calls into question the initial impetus in creating this monument. Some scholars, such as R . S . Gupte, B.D. Ma- hajan, and Krishna Kumar, propose that Cave 15 was originally started as a Buddhist monastery.22 Other features of this cave, such as the individual monastic cells in the lower story and the rock-cut bed carved at the top of the stairs linking the two stories, do indeed suggest such an attribution.23 In addition, the interior pillars in Cave 15 are identical in form to those carved in the neighboring Bud- dhist Cave 12. There is also a similarity in the rendering of some of the motifs found on the veranda pillars in Cave 12 (lower story) and Cave 15 (upper story). It should be mentioned at this point that Cave 12 is traditionally viewed as one of the latest Buddhist caves at the site, dating to the first quar- 21 Inden, Imagining India , 248. 22 Gupte and Mahajan, Ajanta, Ellora, and Aurangabad Caves , 184; Krishna Kumar, "The Buddhist Origin ofSome Brah- manical Cave-Temples at Ellora," East and West 26, 3/4 (September-December 1976): 359-73. 23 In his analysis, Kumar considers other motifs found in Cave 15 that he interprets to be "Buddhist." These include nãgas , yaksas , makaras, pürnaghatas , lions, and elephants. However, his arguments are not convincing as these ele- ments are typically shared across Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain monuments. See Kumar, "The Buddhist Origin," 364-73. For an iconographical study of shared motifs found on Ellora's pillars, see Lisa N. Owen, "Rock-Cut Pillars at Ellora: Interpreting Form and Function," Kalã: The Journal of Indian Art History Congress 15 (2009-10), 35-55. 186</page><page sequence="7">ter of the eighth century CE . Thus, if Cave 15 was indeed started as a Buddhist monastery, the initial stage of excavation most likely dates to this period as well. This of course would indicate that Dan- tidurga was not responsible for the monument at its inception. At best, his "grand finale" was a pre- existing cave that he then had modified and transformed into a Hindu temple. The epigraphs linking Ellora to Dantidurga's successor, Krsnarãja I, are even more problematic as they are not physically connected to the caves nor do they date during his imperial reign (756-773 CE). Nevertheless Krsnarãja I is often credited with commissioning the site's most extraordinary monument, Cave 16, better known as the Kailãsanãtha temple. This temple, dedicated to the Hindu god Siva, replicates a constructed temple although it is carved entirely from the mountain. It features a rock-cut gateway, a pavilion for Siva's vãhana Nandi, the temple proper with subsidiary shrines, and a number of other excavations carved into the enclosure walls of the complex. The strongest evidence that identifies Krsnarãja I as the patron of the Kailãsanãtha is found in the famous Baroda plates issued forty years after his reign.24 These plates record the gift of a village by the ruling king of the Gujarat branch, Karkarãja II . The reference to Krsnarãja I and a Siva temple at Ellora (Elãpura) is found in the genealogical account of the dynasty written at the beginning of the grant. Here, Krsnarãja is said to have constructed a temple so wondrous that it astonished the gods and even the architect who made it.25 Given the scale, the high quality of the craftsmanship, and the artistic conception of Ellora's Kailãsanãtha temple, most scholars concur that the temple mentioned in the inscription is this monument. Whether or not this is the case is, however, difficult to determine as no epigraphical evidence at the site confirms this association. Thus, what the Baroda grant does tell us is that by 812 or 813, when the grant was issued, a Siva temple at Ellora - possibly the Kailãsanãtha - was considered to be one of the greatest achievements of this king. Although Krsnarãja I is linked to the site through this ninth-century grant, other land grants issued by his successors in the ninth and tenth centuries do not repeat this information, nor do they mention a Siva temple located specifically at Elãpura.26 24 J.

Krsnarãja III himself is credited with building a temple called "Krsnešvara" (Karhad plates), which appears to have been constructed in North Arcot District, Tamil Nadu. See R. G.

Did these kings actually commission temples or did they utilize this sacred site for ritual and ultimately propagandistic purposes ? Does a temple constructed during a king's reign and/or his pres- ence at the site necessarily imply royal patronage ? These are difficult but important questions, partic- ularly for understanding the internal development of a site such as Ellora, where phases of artistic pro- duction are often dated by scholars to correspond with the regnal years of a specific king. The ramifi- cations of such an approach are also witnessed in the scholarship regarding Ellora's Jain caves. Given both their circa ninth-century date and religious affiliation, Ellora's Jain excavations are often considered by default to be the royal commission of the Rästraküta king Amoghavarsa I, who reigned from 814 to 880 CE and clearly supported Jain endeavors. Amoghavarsa was the patron of the Jain author Jinasena27 and the Jain mathematician Mahãvlrãcãrya.28 He also granted land to support the maintenance of various Jain temples in Karnataka,29 and it is believed that he abdicated the throne to pursue a life of religious contemplation.30 Though this king might have had personal leanings towards Jainism, in the corpus of Rästraküta inscriptions, there is no evidence that he sponsored work at Ellora (Eläpura) or even visited the site. In fact, in the early years of his reign, the imperial Rästraküta capital was shifted from Ellora's environs to Malkhed, a city located approximately 145 kilometers southeast of Sholapur.31 More important than the lack of epigraphical evidence connecting Amogha- varsa to the caves, however, is the visual evidence within the Jain monuments themselves. I now turn to an examination of the donative inscriptions and portraits of Ellora's Jain patrons. AT THE FEET OF A JINA In addition to the enshrined Jina image within the temple sanctum, reliefs of Tlrthañkaras are carved within the main halls of the caves. Jinas seated or standing in meditation can be found along the side- walls of the excavations or flanking the main shrine. In some caves, the images are over life-sized and carved in groups of two or three; in others they range in size from 30 to 244 centimeters in height and cover the entire wall space from floor to ceiling. While the number of carvings in Ellora's Jain monu- ments varies from cave to cave,32 1 found at least forty-one sculptures across the site that depict human figures at the feet of a Tlrthañkara or Jain deity.33 Some of the human figures are clearly from the 27 Evidence of Amoghavarsa's patronage is stated in the prasasti of Gunabhadra's U ttarapurana . 28 Hampa Nagarajaiah, A History of the Rastrakutas of Malkhed and Jainism (Bangalore: Ankita Pustaka, 2000), 95, 4.7. 29 In 860 CE , Amoghavarsa granted land to Acarya Naganandi for the Nagula basadi. See ibid., 17, 1.9.1. 30 Bhandarkar, "Sanjan Plates of Amoghavarsa I , " 235-57, v- 4-8. These plates, however, also mention that Amoghavarsa sacrificed his little finger to Mahãlaksml to avert an impending world calamity. 31 This is recorded in the Deoli and Karhad plates of Krsnaraja III cited in n. 26 above. 32 For the number of relief carvings in each cave, see the image lists and diagrams in Pereira, Monolithic J inas . 33 Thirty-one of these images present devotees at the feet of ajina, while ten depict figures in veneration of a Jain deity. Unlike Jinas, Jain deities are not liberated beings. As such, they are accessible to devotees during worship and can bestow blessings and grant wishes. Goddesses, for example, became increasingly important in devotional activities during the medieval period. See John E. Cort, "Medieval Jaina Goddess Traditions," Numen 34 (1983): 235-55. 188</page><page sequence="9">monastic community. For example, monks ( munis) are depicted without clothing in accordance with Digambara practice.34 In some of the images, monks are represented with a small whiskbroom that is held under the crook of an arm. This implement is used by munis today to clear the ground of tiny insects so that they are not tread upon or injured.35 Images of Digambara nuns ( ãryikãs ) are identifiable through their simple garments and shorn hair. Members of the laity are also found at the feet of ajina or Jain deity. They typically hold offerings towards the Jina and are adorned with jewelry such as neck- laces, earrings, bracelets, and armlets. Out of these forty-one sculptures, five are carved with a donative inscription that clearly identifies the devotee(s) as the patron. In all five images, it is the Jina that is the central focus of veneration, illus- trating the primary position occupied by the Tlrthañkara in devotional and donative practices. All five sculptures are carved on the shafts of pillars, a location which suggests that they were added at a subsequent date to the original excavation of the caves. Had they been planned during excavation, they would most likely occupy more prominent positions within the cave-temple, such as along the side- walls or near the shrine.36 Thus, their location on pillars, as well as a stylistic consideration of the images (discussed in detail below), suggests a date of execution in the late ninth or tenth century. While a total of five inscribed images seems quite small given the large corpus of imagery carved in the Jain caves, these sculptures nonetheless provide valuable information regarding patronage at the site. Each image presents us with a visual record of the donor that clearly articulates gender and socio-economic status. This information is further qualified through the donative inscription, which states the individual's title, occupation, and/or name. Various types of donors are represented, sug- gesting that an array of devotees was interested in image production at the site. Of significance, none of the devotees are identified via inscription as being affiliated with a royal court or with a particular family of kings such as the Rästrakütas. Nor do any of the donor figures resemble representations of kings found elsewhere in the Jain caves.37 Rather than heavily ornamented figures with tall crowns or elaborate headgear, the donors represented in the five inscribed sculptures range from groups of monks 34 There are two major sects in Jainismi Svetãmbara ("white-clad") and Digambara ("sky-clad"). Svetãmbara monks and nuns wear white robes. Digambara monks wear nothing at all, believing that one must renounce all possessions, including garments, to achieve moksa. Digambara nuns, on the other hand, are not allowed to abandon their robes and so they wear an unstitched cloth. In Digambara artistic traditions, the Jina is always represented without clothing or ornamentation. Ellora's imagery is often classified as Digambara because of the nudity of its Jinas and the presenta- tion of the munis. The Digambara affiliation of the site is discussed further at the end of this article. 35 The use of a whiskbroom accords with the practice of ahimsa, or " non-harm. " 3 6 See for comparison the shrine and antechamber of J 19 and J20, which exhibit an elaborate sculptural program of human and divine devotees that was carved during the initial excavation of the caves. Lisa N. Owen, "Depicting a Jain Assem- bly: Representations of the Samavasarana at Eilora," J inamanjari 34, 2 (October 2006): 44-60. 37 Nearly every Jain cave has a relief depicting King Bharata, son of Rsabhanãtha and brother of Gommatešvara (also known as Bãhuball). In Ellora's images, Bharata is typically portrayed as a seated figure with his hands raised in ven- eration to his meditating brother. Bharata wears a tall crown, large circular earrings, necklaces, bracelets, and arm- lets. His lower garment is generally composed of three or four swags of material that drape horizontally across his hips. Kings and/or royal male figures can also be found in the samavasarana imagery comprising the shrine programs of J19 and J 20. 189</page><page sequence="10">and nuns to couples and individuals who wear limited amounts of clothing and jewelry.38 Two of the images portray solitary male devotees who are ascetic in appearance but are clearly not munis. Another sculpture, which will be discussed first, presents a male lay devotee accompanied by a female figure. DEVOTED PATRONS IN ELLORA'S JAIN CAVES The first inscribed donative image to be examined is carved on an interior pillar of J15. This excava- tion, measuring approximately 20 meters deep, is the lower story cave in the complex commonly referred to as the Indra Sabhã (fig. 1). With the exception of the shrine and its monumental image, however, J 15 remains largely unfinished. Some of the pillars are only roughly blocked out and the rear corners of the cave have not been fully excavated. Given the unfinished state of the cave, the donor and/or artist chose the most visible place for sculpture - on the front face of a well-formed pillar just to the right of the entrance (fig. 6). The addition of this relief on the pillar, as well as the completed shrine Jina image, indicates that J15 was in active worship during the late ninth and tenth centuries.39 The inscribed relief covers much of the pillar, which measures approximately 4.3 meters in height. The standing Tlrthañkara is the Jina Rsabhanãtha. Rsabhanãtha (also known as Ädinätha) is the first of the twenty-four liberated teachers and is nearly always depicted with long strands of hair that touch the top of his shoulders. This particular attribute was established early on in Jain art as demonstrated in a few Kusãna-period sculptures from Mathurã.40 At Ellora, the Jina displays this attribute as well as snail-shell curls that cover his scalp. The latter hairstyle, found also on Buddha images and in some representations of monks and ascetics, alludes to the practice of shaving one's head or pulling out hair by the handful ( kesaluñcana) during initiation into a monastic order. The donor figures are carved on either side of Rsabhanãtha, with the male figure to the viewer's left. He measures over 30 centimeters in height and is carved at a slight angle that allows the viewer to see him in three-quarter view when directly facing the pillar (fig. 7). The donor is seated with his legs crossed in front of him and his palms together in homage ( anjali mudrã). As his palms are slightly cupped, he may also be holding an offering. He wears a lower garment with a thick belt, bracelets, and a necklace. He has a mustache, beard, and long hair that is tied up in a bun on top of his head. 38 This is not to suggest that portraits of kings and/or other royal figures are shown only in imperial regalia. For exam- ple, the inscribed portraits of the tenth-century king Rãjarãja I Cola and his queen LokamahãdevT on the Sivayõganãtha temple at Tiruvišalúr depict them in simple dress and limited jewelry while worshipping a lingapïtba. See Padma Kaimal, "The Problem of Portraiture in South India, circa 870-970 A.D.," Artibus Asiae 59, 1/2 (1999): 76, fig. 23. Moreover, as Kaimal points out, other insignia, such as attendants, a chattra , and a throne, may be included in por- traits to designate a royal subject. 39 The shrine image in J15 was also replastered and painted, most likely in the thirteenth or fourteenth century, when other renovations were made in the Jain caves. These modifications attest to the cave's continued importance for devo- tional activities. 40 N.P. Joshi, "Early Jaina Icons from Mathura," in Mathura : The Cultural Heritage , ed. Doris Meth Srinivasan (New Delhi: American Institute of Indian Studies, 1989), 332-67. 190</page><page sequence="11">The donative inscription, located beneath the figure, is written in Sanskrit in devanãgarí script. It states that Sri Nãgavarma had the image made ( mnãgavarmakri [r] tã pratimã)Al A female figure, who is not mentioned in the inscription, is seated opposite Nãgavarma and displays the same seated pos- ture and mudrã (fig. 8). Although the head and face of this figure are severely damaged, she appears to be simply dressed and ornamented with a double-stranded necklace and bracelets. She also wears a long, thin cloth that covers her chest. The ends of this cloth drape over each forearm. Carved beneath her proper left knee is some sort of offering. While the information contained in the inscription seems somewhat limited, we do know that the male patron's name is Nãgavarma. We can also assume that the patron is not a king or important feuda- tory as no title is included in the epigraph, only the honorific prefix srl. Also notably absent is any men- tion of a mendicant teacher ( ãcãrya ) who might have encouraged or inspired the donation. This is unusual, as a number of medieval donative Jain inscriptions provide the name of the ãcãrya as well as the appropriate mendicant order.42 The donor's motivations for the donation - such as the elimina- tion of karma, the welfare of others, or the benefit of one's parents - are also not mentioned. Thus, the most that we can glean from the inscription itself rests in the name of the patron, Nãga- varma. Although personal names have only been studied in limited ways, they can nonetheless con- note the religious tendencies of a person and/or signify socio-religious conditions within a given time period and locale. Personal names of donors that contain the term nãga (a divine serpent) have, for example, been recorded in connection with a number of ancient sites across India. In his study on the religious function of names in early Buddhist donative inscriptions, Gregory Schopen has noted the appearance of nãga in the names of donors associated with Stüpa 2 at Sãficl.43 By compiling an inven- tory of names, he discovered that the number of donors with distinctly Buddhist names such as Bud- hapãlita ("Guarded by the Buddha[s] ") or Saghamita ("Friend of the Sañga") was quite small in com- parison to other names which are not necessarily "Buddhist." According to Schopen, names such as Nãgapiya ("Beloved of the Snakes") and Nãgasena ("Dependent of the Snakes") that are recorded in association with Stüpa 2 seem to reflect that " a significant number of individuals may have made dona- tions to Buddhist establishments without, however, ever being 'Buddhist' to the degree that they had been given or took Buddhist names: 'Buddhism,' in other words, may never have been a significant component of these individuals' self-identity."44 41 James Burgess and Bhagwanlal Indraji, Inscriptions from the Cave-Temples of Western India with Descriptive Notes, &amp;c. (London, 1881; reprint, Delhi: Indian India, 1976), 98. In the transliteration provided by J.F. Fleet, the name Nãga- varma is spelled "Nãgavarmma." However, upon my inspection of the inscription at the site, I did not perceive a double "m." 42 Mendicant orders have a number of subdivisions, including gana, gaccha , phaddaga , and kula. 43 Gregory Schopen, " What's in a Name : The Religious Function of the Early Donative Inscriptions, " in Buddhist Monks and Business Matters : Still More Papers on Monastic Buddhism in India (Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2004), 382-94. 44 Ibid., 384. For the importance of nãgas in the art historical evidence associated with Saña, see Julia Shaw, "Naga Sculp- tures in Sanchi's Archaeological Landscape: Buddhism, Vaisnavism, and Local Agricultural Cults in Central India, First Century ВСЕ to Fifth Century CE," Artibus Asiae 64, 1 (2004): 5-60. 191</page><page sequence="12">Similar trends have been recognized by H. D. Sankalia at later Buddhist establishments.45 In his study of personal names recorded at various monastic complexes in the Deccan dating from 200 ВСЕ to 400 CE , Sankalia notes the popularity of names containing the terms nãga , mitra , or soma , among others - names that he classifies as "miscellaneous" since they do not identify the donor specifically as a Šaiva, Vaisnava, Buddhist, or Jain. Unlike names such as Šivaghosa, Šivabhůti, and Mahãdeva, which clearly suggest that the individual is a devotee of Siva, names with the prefix nãga- are essentially "pan- religious" in nature, as the worship of nãgas is not exclusive to any one religious tradition. The asso- ciation of nãgas with aspects of rain, fertility, abundance, and treasure, not to mention their role as protective deities for Hindu, Buddhist, and Jain divinities, demonstrates their widespread appeal and function in South Asian society and religion. The popularity of names containing the term nãga can also be seen in later epigraphical sources. Closer in time, proximity, and religious affiliation to Ellora's Jain caves is the large corpus of inscrip- tions carved among the hills and monuments of Šravana Belgola. These epigraphs, dating primarily from the seventh through the twelfth century, record a variety of activities at this southern Digam- bara tJrtha. Many of the inscriptions commemorate the ritual death by fasting (sallekhanã) that was performed by pious monks, nuns, and laypeople.46 Out of forty-six inscriptions in this category dat- ing from the seventh century, for example, two names contain the term nãga: Nãgasena, identified in the inscription as ajain teacher ( guruvadi ), and NãgamatI, an advanced nun (ganti).47 The occurrence of the term nãga in the names of these two monastic individuals is quite interesting since Digambara mendicants ordinarily adopt a new name upon initiation. This new name often reflects the lineage of the novitiate's teacher by containing the suffix - nandi , - kïrti , - candra , - sãgara , - vijaya , or, as in our case at Šravana Belgola, -senaAs Thus, the prefix nãga- retained in the monk's name Nãgasena must have also been considered an appropriate marker of Jain identity. "Nãga" is also found in the names of lay pilgrims who visited Šravana Belgola in the tenth through the twelfth century. Carved on some of the site's prominent outcrops of stone are the names Nãgayya, Nãgadeva, and Nãgarasa.49 These individuals came to Šravana Belgola to pay homage to the Tlrthañ- karas, to the monks, and/or to the tïrtha itself. The name Nãgavarmma is recorded in at least four inscriptions from this period, one of which identifies the individual as a sculptor or engraver.50 Thus, these records indicate that within a medieval southern Digambara context, individuals that have names with the prefix nãga- can very well be identified as Jain devotees. Its widespread use, particularly in this region, may also be linked to the growing popularity of devotion towards the twenty-third Jina, Pãrsvanãtha, who is recognizable in the visual arts through his canopy of nãga- hoods.

The second part of the donor's name at Ellora provides a bit more information on our patron. While the first part of a name tends to indicate one's religious tendencies, the second component, or suffix, can denote one's varna (class) and/or profession.52 The "varma" in Nâgavarma's name most likely comes from varman , a term connoting different types of protection such as shelter, defense, and preser- vation. Of significance, varman is also often included at the end of the names of ksatriyas , one of the four social classes established in ancient India. According to ancient and medieval literature, the ksa- triya varna was a class of kings and warriors. Ksatriyas typically held martial and/or administrative positions ranging from village headman to paramount overlord. They served as members of a king's army, as governors, local rulers, ministers, and sovereigns. While the absence of a title in the donative inscription in J 15 rules out an imperial occupation for Nãgavarma, his presentation as a jeweled figure does indicate that he is a man of some financial means. This is also conveyed by the jewelry and dress of the female devotee (presumably his wife)53 seated opposite him. Her presence in the visual record confirms that Nãgavarma is neither a student, a mendicant, nor an ascetic, as it would be improper for such individuals to be presented in close contact with a woman. Thus it seems clear that Nãgavarma is a married man with some financial means who may also be identified as a ksatriya. However, before pursuing this identification further, it is instructive to look at some related images within Ellora's Jain caves. Although the J 15 relief is the only inscribed example of such a pair, interestingly, there are at least seven other images at the site that bear compelling visual similarities to our patron.54 An almost iden- tical version of the Nãgavarma relief is found in the nearby excavation numbered J 13 (fig. 1). The sculp- ture is carved on the southern (left) veranda pilaster of this cave and faces the entrance into J15. Like the Nãgavarma relief, an over-life-sized standing Tlrthañkara is carved on the pillar shaft. Two devo- tees are seated at the Jina's feet; however, both figures are unfinished. Details can only be observed in the male devotee (this time on the viewer's right), who clearly sports a beard and a mustache (fig. 9). He appears to have the same hairstyle as Nãgavarma given the matrix of rock left for the bun of hair. He makes a gesture of homage to the Jina, with his hands held at chest-level. Given its similarities to the J 15 carving as well as its proximity to that image, the J 13 relief was most likely executed at the same time as Nâgavarma's donation. In fact, it may be another commission by this particular individual. 51 Hampa Nagarajaiah,//«^ Pãrsva Temples in Karnataka (Hombuja, Karnataka: Sri Siddhãntakeerti Granthamale, 1999); MadhavN.

I would like to thank the anonymous reader who suggested this alternative identification. 54 The seven sculptures are found in J13, Ji4(2 reliefs), J 21, J 24 (2 reliefs), and J26. 209</page><page sequence="30">A small painting located on the northern (rear) wall of J 21 is perhaps a better-preserved example of a donor/devotee couple who have the same general physical features as Nãgavarma and his wife (fig. 10). 55 The male is seated in a pose identical to that of Nãgavarma and he has the same facial hair as his carved counterpart. The painted figure is ornamented with various types of jewelry including a neck- lace, earrings, bracelets, and armlets. The condition of the painting allows us to see details of his upper garment and the fact that he has a sword or dagger attached to his belt. The hilt of the weapon can be seen just beneath his proper right arm. The female figure seated next to him wears a cloth, or dupattã , similar to that of Nagavarma's wife. As in the carved figure, she lets one end of the cloth drape across her forearm. She grasps the other end of the dupattã with her proper right hand, securing it across her chest. Although the seating arrangement of these figures differs from that of Nãgavarma and his wife, they are nonetheless painted next to an over-life-sized Jina image that is carved on one of the rear wall pilasters. In addition to being part of a donor/devotee pair, the mustached and bearded male appears as a solitary worshipper in four of the seven reliefs.56 Interestingly, two of the four sculptures present the male devotee in adoration of the Jain goddess Ambikã (also known as KúsmãndinI). Ambikã is the attendant deity of the twenty-second Jina, Neminãtha, but at Ellora, she is presented as an important goddess in her own right (fig. 11). Images of Ambikã are identifiable through three main attributes: a mango tree that forms a lush canopy over her head, her lion vähanay and a small child who either sits in her lap or stands nearby. At Ellora, Ambikã is also often accompanied by female attendants, and her Jain affiliation is limited to a small, seated Jina that adorns her headdress or appears above the tree.57 Two reliefs of Ambikã, found in J24 and J26, include an additional figure to this standard iconogra- phy. In both sculptures, a bearded male devotee is carved in the lower left corner of the relief, behind the lion vãhana. The devotee in J24 exhibits the greatest amount of detail (fig. 12). His hair is pulled back in a bun in much the same fashion as Nägavarma's and the painted male figure from J21. Also similar to the painting is the treatment of the devotee's facial hair. In both works, the ends of the mus- tache curl upwards. The figures wear almost identical necklaces, armlets, and bracelets. Of significance, the sword or dagger included in the painting is prominently carved in this sculpture. This element is repeated in yet another representation of a bearded male devotee at the site, this time in association with the Jina Pãrsvanãtha. Pãrsvanãtha plays an extremely important role in Ellora's caves as there are over forty-five representations of this Jina.58 While some of the images depict Pãrs- 55 Although this painting is probably part of the renovations that were conducted in this cave in the thirteenth or four- teenth century, its similarities to the Nãgavarma relief prompt me to include it in this discussion. 56 These are found in J14, J24 (2 reliefs), and J26. 57 It should be mentioned that Ambikã is also worshipped and identified as a Hindu goddess. Leslie Orr has examined the limitations in designating a fixed, specific religious identity to goddesses such as Ambikã in "Identity and Divinity: Boundary-crossing Goddesses in Medieval South India, "Journal of the American Academy of Religion 73 (2005): 9-43. 58 The following caves contain sculptures of Paršvanatha, with the number of representations in parenthesis: Chota Kailãsa complex (5); J6 (i); Jio (3); Jíl (i); J12 (i); J13 (i); J14 (i); J16 (i); J17 (i); J18 (3); J19 (5); J19A (i); J20 (2); J21 (и); J22 (4); J23 (2); J24 (1); J25 (3); and J 26 (1). Painted images of Pãrsvanãtha can be found on the front wall of the shrines in J19 and J20. Images of Pãrávanãtha continue to make up a large percentage of Jina images installed in Jain temples today. For Jain temple worship practices in Patan, Gujarat, see John E. Cor t Jains in the World : Religious Val- ues and Ideology in India (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2001), specifically 234, n. 78. 2IO</page><page sequence="31">vanãtha as an isolated figure, the majority show him being attacked by various demons. According to early medieval textual accounts that describe this event,59 Pãrsvanãtha, in a previous life, tried to save a pair of snakes that were being burnt in a brahmin's sacrificial fire. Although Pârsvanâtha's rescue attempt failed, he was reborn in the next life as the twenty-third Jina, while the snakes were reborn as a serpent king and queen. The brahmin, on the other hand, was reborn as a demon and attacked Pãrs- vanãtha with fire, rocks, and torrential rains in order to curtail the Jina's enlightenment. But Pãrs- vanãtha was not deterred from achieving liberation because the serpent-king, Dharanendra, shielded and protected him by spreading his multiple cobra-hoods over the Jina's head. The serpent queen, who is identified as PadmãvatI in later texts, also protected Pãrsvanãtha by holding a parasol over him. The sculptures at Ellora include these narrative details in addition to a number of other demonic figures that try to distract the meditating Pãrsvanãtha (figs. 13, 19, 22). Common to most of the reliefs is a large rock-throwing demon who is typically carved in an upper corner of the sculptures. In some cases, this figure has both arms raised above him, seemingly supporting the edge of the relief which visually serves as his boulder of destruction. This demon can be identified as Sambara (or Meghamãlin), the reincarnation of the evil brahmin Kamatha, who hurled large boulders at the meditating Jina.6° Other demons (or perhaps different manifestations of Sambara) surround the Tlrthañkara. These typ- ically include a wild-haired demon riding a lion, a knife-wielding bull-rider, and a grotesque figure with a demonic face emerging from his stomach. Most of these demons wield weapons that include curved daggers, tridents, thunderbolts, spears, clubs, and/or bows and arrows. Unarmed figures make angry gestures with their hands or faces. The frenetic activity that encircles the Jina contrasts with the Tlrthañkara's solid, meditative stance of kayotsarga. In addition to the demons, most of Ellora's Pãrsvanãtha reliefs include a seated couple in the lower right corner. Both figures are heavily ornamented with a crown, earrings, necklaces, armlets, and bracelets. In some of the sculptures, these figures are presented in adoration of the Jina with their hands clasped in añjali mudrã. According to M. N. P. Tiwari, who has studied Ellora's Pãrsvanãtha reliefs in detail, these figures represent a penitent Sambara and consort.61 Whether or not this is the case is difficult to determine, as there are no visual or textual precedents for this couple.62 Visually, they serve to balance PadmãvatI and her snake-attendants ( nãgmts), who are carved in the opposite corner of the relief. Like the ornamented couple, the nâgïnï s face the Jina and are presented in añjali mudrã. Thus, in these reliefs we may be witnessing the portrayal of human and divine worship of the Jina. While most of Ellora's reliefs of Pãrsvanãtha adhere to the description above, the sculpture carved in J14 includes a solitary, bearded devotee in the lower left corner of the relief (figs. 13, 14). Both his small size and his position behind Pâdmâvatï's lotus pedestal set him apart from all other figures in 59 For an overview of medieval Jain texts that contain passages on the attack on Pãrsvanãtha, see U.

The male worshipper in this sculpture, like the ones already discussed, sits with his legs crossed in front of him and his hands in homage. Although individual strands of hair are not depicted, it is clear that he has long hair tied back in a bun. He has a beard and mustache and is ornamented with a necklace and bracelets. A small dagger is worn at his hip. In light of the seven images of a bearded and mustached devotee in Ellora's Jain caves, as well as the inscribed portrait of Nãgavarma, it seems clear that we are witnessing the construction of an ideal type of lay devotee at the site. This does not, however, negate Nägavarma's identity as an actual patron. Nor does it disqualify his image as a "portrait." As Padma Kaimal points out in her study of South Indian portraiture: In order to function as a portrait, an image need not adhere to any particulars of the subject's appearance but it must somehow successfully articulate within its own culture its role as an index to that person's extra-artistic reality. The specific devices employed to articulate that role and the aspects of the subject considered worthy of representation can vary enormously.63 As in other types of portraiture in world visual culture, the representation of Nãgavarma at Ellora goes beyond a concern for mimicking physiognomic peculiarities. His portrait, in fact, emphasizes his piety, marital status, social identity ( varna), and possibly his profession. His appearance as a "type" of layman in no way contradicts the fact that he was a specific historical person. In other words, his presentation as a married, pious householder is not peripheral to his individual self.64 The inclusion of a weapon, specifically a sword or a dagger, in three of the site's bearded devotees further clarifies the social rank and/or profession of these figures. While it is uncertain whether or not carrying arms was commonplace in medieval India, according to dharmasütra literature, members of the ksatriya class typically engaged in martial combat and were allowed to mete out punishment.65 Unlike a brahmin or a vaisya , who could only take up arms to defend himself, ksatriyas were allowed to be armed at all times since it was their responsibility to protect themselves and others.66 The three devotees with daggers, along with the - varma suffix in the name of our actual patron, Nãgavarma, rep- resent strong evidence indeed of ksatriya patronage at the site. Lending further support to this conclusion is the prominent role of ksatriyas in South Indian medieval image production. For example, the colossal Gommatešvara image at Šravana Belgola was commissioned in 981 or 983 CE by Cãmundarãya, a leading general of the Ganga dynasty.67 Moreover, early medieval donative inscriptions in Karnataka indicate that the vast majority of patrons were local 63 Kaimal, "The Problem of Portraiture," 66. 64 For a comparable approach to donor portraits, specifically in medieval western India, see Jack C. Laughlin, Arad- hakamürtH Adhisthãyakamiirti: Popular Piety, Politics, and the Medieval Jain Temple Portrait (Bern: Peter Lang, 2003). 65 Patrick Olivelle, trans. , Dharmasutras: The Law Codes of Apastambha, Gautama, Baudhayana, and Vasistha (Delhi : Moti- lal Banarsidass, 2000).

See L.K. Srinivasan, "Shravana Belgola in Legend and History," in Homage to Shravana Belgola , ed. Saryu Doshi (Bombay: Marg Publications, 1981), 47. There are a number of inscriptions at the 212</page><page sequence="33">rulers or administrators, some with martial affiliations.68 Although many of the patrons appear to have been high officials of the state, like Cãmundarãya, they typically acted independently of kings in their commissions. While no similar analysis has yet been conducted on the corpus of inscriptions from southern Maharashtra, I think it would be beneficial to at least consider Ellora from such a perspec- tive in light of the representations of this type of devotee at the site. Moreover, there is an overwhelm- ing interest in Gommatešvara at Ellora, evidenced by at least nineteen large-scale images of this Jain figure, two of which include a bearded and mustached devotee.69 IN PERPETUAL HOMAGE: BRAHMACÄRINS AND THEIR PRESENTATIONS AS DONORS The sculptures examined above give us a glimpse of at least one type of patron involved in the devel- opment of imagery in Ellora's Jain caves. However, other images at the site present an entirely differ- ent picture of their patrons. One such sculpture is located in J 13, directly across from the unfinished "copy" of Nãgavarma and his wife. Like the relief it faces, this sculpture is carved on a veranda pilaster and features an over-life-sized Jina image (figs. 15, 17). Seated in the lower right corner of the relief is a male devotee in añjali mudrã. The figure measures just over 30 centimeters high. Unlike Nãgavarma and the other bearded and mustached devotees, this figure does not have facial hair. Instead he has a youthful appearance and elongated earlobes, usually considered a mark of renunciation. His hair is worn close to his scalp, as indicated by the shallow hairline across his forehead, and he is also seated in a different pose. Rather than crossing his legs in front of him like the other figures examined thus far, this devotee raises his proper right knee, shifting his weight onto his left leg which is tucked under- neath his body. He wears a short cloth around his hips and a sacred thread ( yajnopavïta ) across his torso but no jewelry. Directly beneath this figure is a circa late-ninth- or tenth-century Sanskrit inscription that iden- tifies the Jina image as Santi and the patron as Srl Sohila, a brahmacãrin ( msohilabrahmacärinah sãn- tibhattãrakapratimeyam) .7° It is significant that his identification as the patron of the image is further qualified by his status as a brahmacãrin , a celibate student who undertakes a period of study of sacred texts. While this term is often associated with Hindu religious traditions, it is also used by Buddhists and Digambara Jains.71 According to two medieval Digambara authors, Cãmundarãya72 and Âsãd- site, both on the image and on architectural elements, that indicate that the Gommatešvara statue was commissioned by Cãmundarãya. Interestingly, in some of the epigraphs carved at the base of the image, the patron, Cãmundarãya, is identified only by name and with the honorific prefix srl. See Vilas A. Sangave, The Sacred Shravanabelagola: A Socio- Religious Study (New Delhi: Bharatiya Jnanpith, 1981), 72 -76. 68 Singh, Jainism in Early Medieval Karnataka , 137. 69 The male devotees are found in the Gommatešvara reliefs in J 14 and J24. 70 Burgess and Indraji, Inscriptions from the Cave-Temples of Western India , 98-99. 71 The institution of the brahmacãrin appears to be a distinctly Digambara practice as it is not encountered in Svetãm- bara traditions. John E. Cort briefly describes the roles of this institution in medieval Digambara communities in "A Fifteenth-Century Digambar Jain Mystic and His Followers : Tãran Taran Svãml and the Tãran Svãml Panth, " in Stud- ies in Jaina History and Culture, ed. Peter Flügel (London and New York: Routledge, 2006), 265. 72 Caritrasara of Camundaraya (Bombay: Manikacandra Digambara Jaina Granthamala, no. 9, 1917), 20-21. 213</page><page sequence="34">hara,73 there are at least five types of Jain brahmacarin. The five categories are enumerated and briefly described by Robert Williams in his book on medieval manuals of Jain lay practice ( srãvakãcãras ): (1) upanaya-brahmacãrin - the young student who after the upanayana ceremony studies the àgama before entry into the household life; (2) avalamba-brahmacãrin - one who passes a novitiate as a monk studying the àgama in the ksullaka stage but then goes back to the household life; (3) adïksà-brahmacàrin - one who studies the àgama without taking orders or wearing the monk's garb, but adheres to the household life; (4) gãdha-brahmacãrin - one who becomes a boy ascetic ( kumàra-sramana) but later abandons this higher ideal for the household life either of his own volition or owing to pressure from a ruler or from relatives or because of parïsahas' (5) naisthika-brahmacãrin - a man who begs his food, wears a red or white loincloth and the sacred thread on his chest, and has his hair shaven save for a top-knot.74 Although the five types of brahmacàrin are differentiated according to their level of study and their physical insignia, all five must be of the twice-born varna and have undergone the upanayana ceremony (the investiture of the sacred thread). In addition, all five must remain celibate during their period of study. However, unlike Hindu brahmacãrim , who are typically unmarried, it is clear that at least two types of Jain brahmacàrin (the avalamba and the adïksà ) can enter into the householder life prior to study. Traces of this practice may even be seen today, as Digambara laymen who have attained the sev- enth prat imã (one of eleven stages of spiritual progress towards mendicancy) receive the title of brah- macàrin. According to Padmanabh S. Jaini, the seventh stage or pratimã (known as brahmacarya pra- timà or abrahmavarjana) represents an almost complete renunciation of one's household life.75 The brahmacàrin must not only abstain from all physical contact with women, including his wife, but also refrain from wearing tailored clothing. The brahmacàrin wears a garment consisting of two or three long pieces of cloth and is prohibited from wearing jewelry and from using certain toiletries such as soap and scented oil. Given the visual and textual evidence of the Sohila portrait, it seems clear that this individual is indeed one of the five types of brahmacàrin mentioned in medieval Digambara texts. His lack of hair and jewelry indicate that he is engaged in a moderate form of renunciation, a practice that is appro- priate for any of the brahmacàrins listed above. However, he is most likely an upanaya brahmacàrin as he wears the sacred thread and has the youthful appearance of a student or young man. His celibate, and possibly unmarried, status is further demonstrated by the inclusion of a figure seated opposite him. Rather than being portrayed with a wife, as in Nagavarma's relief, Sohila faces an attendant goddess 73 K.C. Shastri, ed. and Hindi trans., Dharmamrta ( Sagara ) of Ašadhara (New Delhi: Bharatiya Jñanapitha, 1996), 7.19-20. 74 Robert Williams, Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Medieval Šravakacaras (London: Oxford University Press, 1963; reprint, Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1983), 36. 75 Jaini, The Jaina Path of Purification, 183. 214</page><page sequence="35">(fig. 1 6). The goddess is most likely the sâsanadevï of the Tlrthañkara Sãntinãtha, the Jina named in the inscription. The female figure is clearly not Sohila's wife given her ornamentation and the fact that she is standing rather than seated. Although her proper right hand is now broken off, it appears that she initially made the gesture of abhaya mudrã ("do not fear"; also an early gesture of teaching). In her proper left hand is a manuscript, indicating her role as protector of the sãsana (teaching/doctrine). Thus, Sohila is presented in adoration of both the Jina and the preservation of Jain doctrine, a fitting portrait for a brahmacãrin. The relief of Sohila is not, however, the only portrait of a brahmacãrin within Ellora's Jain caves. Carved on an interior pillar of J25 is a small relief measuring less than 61 centimeters in height (figs. 3, 18). The relief features three figures: a standing Pãrsvanãtha, the goddess PadmãvatI, and a male devo- tee who is carved to the proper left of the Jina. The devotee is actually the largest figure of the three, even though he is carved at a lower level than the Jina to indicate his subservient status. Unlike the other devotees we have examined at Ellora, this figure venerates the Jina in a standing position. In fact, given the placement of his proper left leg, it appears as if he is taking a step towards the Tlrthañkara. The devotee wears only a loincloth ( kaupïna ) that is tied in a knot on his left hip. His hands are placed together in veneration and he has a basket or begging bowl hanging from the crook of his arm. He has elongated earlobes and his hair is rendered in tight snail-shell curls, elements that designate a renun- ciant. Although there are only three figures in this relief, the depiction of the goddess PadmãvatI with her parasol extended over the Jina's head indicates that we are looking at an abbreviated version of the demonic attack on Pãrsvanãtha. As such, U. P. Shah and M.N. P. Tiwari have independently iden- tified the male devotee in the relief as Sambara, the reincarnation of the evil brahmin Kamatha.76 According to both scholars, the brahmin is shown here after being defeated by the Jina and is thus paying homage to the spiritual victor. While this interpretation is certainly plausible, it does not take into account the epigraphical evidence associated with this relief. Carved directly beneath the sculp- ture is a Sanskrit donative inscription written in a circa late-ninth- or tenth-century Kannada script.77 To my knowledge, the epigraph has not been transcribed or fully translated. However, according to a summary of the contents published in J aina-Êilãlekha-Samgraha , the inscription records that a bãla- brahmacãrin established or set up two images of the goddess PadmãvatI.78 The term bãlabrahmacãrin in the epigraph may refer to an individual who has been a brahmacãrin for most of his life, as bãla lit- erally means "young or childlike. " Alternatively, bãla could be the name of the donor who is then fur- ther identified as a brahmacãrin (i.e. as in the epigraph identifying the brahmacãrin Sohila). In either case, it should be noted that brahmacãrim at this advanced level would not personally finance the pro- duction of images. Like nuns and monks, they would most likely encourage other members of the laity 76 U. P. Shahjaina-Rupa-Mandana (New Delhi : Abhinav Publications, 1987), 337 and pl. 76 151A ; Tiwari, "Paršvanatha Images in Ellorã," 113 and pl. 61. 77 While J. F. Fleet attributes a mid-eighth- to mid-ninth-century date to this inscription, other scholars suggest a date in the ninth or tenth century. See Pereira, Monolithic Jinas , 90, n. 4; and Vidyadhar Joharapurkar, ed .Jaina-Êilãlekha- Samgraha (Delhi: Bharatiya Jñanapltha, 1971), 7-8. 78 ]o''bt2^'itV2X,Jaina-Silalekha-Samgraha, 7-8. 215</page><page sequence="36">to provide the monetary funds for the commission.79 The importance given to PadmãvatI in the tex- tual record is also particularly interesting since there are no independent images of this deity in this cave as we might expect.80 However, there is a large-scale relief of Pãrsvanãtha with PadmãvatI in atten- dance on the left wall of the excavation. Although this relief does not contain an inscription or a por- trait of a male devotee, it might be the second image mentioned in the epigraph, especially since it is located adjacent to the pillar relief. If the male devotee portrayed in the J25 relief is in fact a portrait of the bãlabrahmacãrin mentioned in the donative inscription, then we have evidence of yet another type of brahmacãrin who was inter- ested in image production at the site. Visually, the portrait accords with textual descriptions of a naisthika brahmacãrin. As recorded in medieval Digambara texts, a naisthika brahmacãrin is distin- guished from the other types through his greater asceticism: he must beg for his food, shave his head (with the exception of a top-knot), and wear only one piece of cloth. The representation of the male devotee in this relief seems to exhibit these required characteristics. Descriptions of the medieval naisthika brahmacãrin are comparable to those of advanced Digam- bara laymen (the ksullaka and ailaka) who have reached the eleventh and final pratimã. Indeed, even the term naisthika (literally "forming the end; final, last") may make reference to this final stage in a layman's progression towards mendicancy. According to Ãsãdhara,81 the ksullaka wears a white loin- cloth, shaves his beard and head, and must take food in a seated position. He is allowed to eat from a bowl or from the palm of his hand. The ailaka has similar but more extreme restrictions. Donning only a loincloth ( kaupïna ), the ailaka must tear out the hair of his beard and head ( kesaluñcana) and can only eat from the palm of his hand. He is also equipped with a peacock-feather whiskbroom, much like that carried by Digambara munh today. In fact, the institution of the ksullaka and ailaka is also found in contemporary Digambara practice, indicating that these stages continue to be a successful means for the layman's transition into full mendicancy.82 That these types of advanced laymen had a strong presence at Ellora is further demonstrated in two other Pãrsvanãtha reliefs at the site. Although these images are not inscribed, we see a similar type of figure portrayed in devotion to this specific Jina. Both images are found on the facade of J22, an exca- vation located across from J25. This particular cave has suffered considerable damage and has been heav- ily restored by the ASI. Nonetheless, the two images under examination remain intact and are found on either side of a 1.5-meter- tall relief of the attack on Pãrsvanãtha (fig. 19). On the left side of the sculp- ture, near Padmâvatï's feet, is a standing male figure with elongated earlobes and a shaved head (fig. 20). He has his hands pressed together in añjali mudrã and, like the bãlabrahmacãrin in J25, appears to 79 The instrumental role of Jain monastics and advanced laymen in "suggesting" or "encouraging" members of the laity to commission and pay for images contrasts with patterns of early Buddhist monastic patronage. In Buddhist con- texts, monks and nuns were clearly involved in all aspects of image production, including financial transactions. For a detailed analysis of early Buddhist donative inscriptions, see Gregory Schopen, "On Monks, Nuns, and 'Vulgar' Practices: The Introduction of the Image Cult into Indian Buddhism," Artibus Asiae 49, 1/2 (1989): 153-68. 80 The only presentation of this goddess as an independent deity at Ellora is found in J18. 81 Shastri, Dharmamrta ( Sagara) of Ašadhara, 7.34-50. 82 For a more detailed description of ksullakas and ailakas in contemporary Digambara practice, see Peter Flügel, Demo- graphic Trends in Jaina Monasticism," in Flügel, Studies in Jaina History and Culture , 344-45. 216</page><page sequence="37">take a step towards the Jina. Again like the bãlabrahmacãrin , this figure dons only a loincloth. The cloth is worn in a similar fashion with the ends tied in a knot over the left hip. Directly across from this devotee, on an extension of rock to the right of the entrance, is another male figure who is identical in appearance (fig. 21). Reasons as to why these eievenxh-pratimã laymen are presented specifically with the Jina Pãrs- vanãtha (and PadmãvatI) remain unknown. However, it may be the result of this Jina's growing pop- ularity in the ninth and tenth centuries, especially in South India. With the expansion of the biogra- phy of Pãrsvanãtha, important religious values were highlighted and directly associated with this Tlrthañkara - themes such as the concern for all living creatures, the refutation of Vedic sacrifice, and the benefits of meditation. Themes of compassion and karmic retribution are also featured in the medieval narratives concerning Pãrsvanãtha, as are acts of devotion as illustrated by this Jina's atten- dants, Dharanendra and PadmãvatI. These messages come to the forefront in reliefs of Pãrsvanãtha at Ellora. Perhaps this is one reason why advanced lay devotees wanted to be presented in perpetual ven- eration of this particular spiritual victor. OTHER ADVANCED LAY DEVOTEES: PORTRAITS OF ÄRYIKÄS AT ELLORA Directly related to the Pãrsvanãtha images in J25 and J22 is yet another sculpture of this Jina with an advanced lay devotee. However, in this relief, located next door in J23, the devotee is female (figs. 22, 23). She stands directly under the tip of Padmâvatï's parasol with her hands held low near her waist. Though the sculpture is damaged, it appears that her hands are clasped in homage. She has elongated earlobes and a bare scalp, and wears a single piece of cloth with a central pleat in the front. Held in the crook of her proper right arm is the handle of a whiskbroom. All of these elements indicate that the female figure is a Digambara nun, or ãryikã. During the medieval period, Digambara ãryikãs were not considered mendicants but celibate, advanced laywomen.83 Unlike munis, ãryikãs are prohibited from becoming naked ascetics. Under no circumstances can a woman relinquish her clothing in public. This injunction effectively prohibits ãryikã s from ever abandoning all their possessions at the time of initiation ( diksã ) and thus denies them any chance of attaining moksa during that lifetime. The importance of ascetic nudity for Digambaras is also witnessed in their views of Svetãmbara monks, who are also not considered to be full-fledged mendicants due to their use of monastic robes. The injunction that ãryikã s may not renounce clothing gradually developed into the doctrinal for- mulation that women could not attain moksa based on their gender.84 In essence, Digambara nuns would have to be reborn as men (and then become naked munis) in order to attain spiritual liberation. Perhaps the earliest text to address the issue of female salvation is the Sutraprãbhrta (Suttapãhuda) .85 83 Singh, Jainism in Early Medieval Karnataka, 128; Jaini, The Jaina Path of Purification, 24 6. 84 Padmanabh S. Jaini, Gender and Salvation ; Jaina Debates on the Spiritual Liberation of Women (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1991), 3. 85 Ibid., 3. 217</page><page sequence="38">Although the date and authorship of this text remain in dispute,86 its views on salvation had direct social relevance in medieval Jain monastic thought and practice. In a passage on the true nature of renunciation the Sûtraprâbhrta states : According to the Teaching of the Jina, a person wearing clothes cannot attain moksa even if he be a Tlrthañkara. The path of moksa consists of nudity ( nagna); all other paths are wrong paths. In the genital organs of women, in between their breasts, in their navels, and in the armpits, it is said [in the scriptures that] there are very subtle living beings. How can there be the mendicant ordination ( pravrajyã ) for them [since they must violate the vow of ahimsa' ? Women have no purity of mind; they are by nature fickle-minded. They have menstrual flows. [Therefore] there is no meditation for them free of anxiety.87 Medieval Digambara texts such as Prabhacandra's Nyãyakumudacandra and Jayasena's Tãtparyvrtti reiterate and expand these arguments, positing that liberation is impossible for women based on the impurities of their bodies as well as their mental deficiencies. Although ãryikã s are deemed inferior to muni s and are excluded from spiritual liberation, nuns can and did achieve a certain level of respect and status from members of the lay community. During the medieval period, nuns had frequent interaction with the laity and were often the main disseminators of doctrine to female and male disciples.88 Medieval orders of nuns were administered and governed by superior ãryikã s (also identified as kanti or ganti), thus there was a level of advancement within the monastic organization. Though these advanced nuns were still supervised by male ãcãryas, they did have the authority to regulate the daily activities of the nuns in their order. According to epigraphi- cal evidence from medieval South India, nuns could and did receive endowments of land for the main- tenance and upkeep of the local Jain temple which they managed.89 Other inscriptions from the south, particularly from Šravana Belgola, record that some nuns performed sallekhanã , the ritual death by fasting.90 Such a holy death (which is strongly recommended for mendicants) would have garnered great respect for that particular order of ãryikã s. The presence oïâryikâs at Ellora and their instrumental role in image production is also witnessed in two inscribed images carved on the interior face of two veranda pillars in J25 (the same excavation with the bãlabrahmacãrin donation). In these reliefs, a group of ãryikãs is depicted alongside a group of naked munis (figs. 24, 25). The location of these two group portraits and their similarities in style and content (both textual and visual) indicate that they were carved as a pair in the late ninth or tenth century. Most likely they were executed at the same time as the bãlabrahmacãrin s image as their dona- tive inscriptions are also written in a Kannada script. 86 Padmanabh S. Jaini dates the Sûtraprâbhrta to around 150 CE and attributes the authorship to Kundakunda. How- ever, there is some disagreement with this assessment. For an examination of the primary sources and chronology of Kundakunda, see W. J. Johnson, Harmless Souls: Karmic Bondage and Religious Change in Early Jainism with Special Ref- erence to Umãsvãti and Kundakunda (Delhi: Motilal Banarsidass, 1995), 91- hi. 87 Jaini's translation of verses 6-8 of the Sutraprabhrta in Gender and Salvation , 35. 88 Singh, Jainism in Early Medieval Karnataka , 129-30. 89 Ibid., 129. 90 Settar, Inviting Death , appendix 4, 249-52. 218</page><page sequence="39">The two inscribed pillar reliefs depict ajina standing on an open lotus. On the Jina's proper right is a group of monks seated on small, oval cushions. Their lack of hair and garments easily identifies them as munis. All of them hold their right hand in a gesture of teaching or blessing. In contrast, the nuns on the proper left of the Jina are not seated on cushions nor do they make a gesture of teaching. Instead, they press their palms together in añjali mudrã. In both reliefs, the monks and nuns face for- ward towards the viewer. This visual connection is strengthened through the gestures of the small monk and nun closest to the Jina, who peer out from behind the larger mendicants seated in front of them. This particular arrangement also intimates that we are looking at a large community of men- dicants with the back rows being obscured by those seated in front. Beneath each carving is a Sanskrit inscription that is written in a Kannada script.91 Both epigraphs have sustained considerable damage from natural erosion and from modern drill holes that were bored into the pillars to erect a metal barricade. The barricade rails have since been removed but the dam- age is irrevocable. Based on what is still legible, the inscriptions appear to provide almost identical information. They record a series of names, some of which appear to be monastic and gender specific. The names of two monks are recorded as Nãganandi and possibly Dlpanandi while the names that may be associated with nuns include Silabe, Aluka, and Ãcale. A distinctly non-Jain name - Šivadevapati - is found in one of the inscriptions. This individual may be the lay donor who paid for the images. He may also be represented in the relief on the southern (left) veranda pillar, as this sculpture includes a male figure who stands behind the group of monks. Two other reliefs within this cave present a similar group portrait of munis and ãryikã s. One is located on the rear face of the northern (right) veranda pillar. Though this relief does not contain a donative inscription, it provides a visual record almost identical to that of the two works previously examined. However, in this relief the standing Jina is recognizable as Pãrsvanãtha due to the snake canopy overhead. To Pârsvanâtha's right is a group of monks who are seated on small, oval cushions. As in the other depictions of monks in this cave, each one raises his proper right hand in veneration/ teaching. To Pârsvanâtha's left are the ãryikã s. They are seated at ground level with their legs tucked in front of their bodies, and they press their palms together in añjali mudrã . As in the inscribed sculp- tures, the monks and nuns are represented in groups of five or six. However, there are no additional devotees in this particular relief. In the second example, a laywoman and possibly a novitiate monk are carved among the munis and ãryikã s on the damaged front wall of J25. Like the other images in this cave, a group of monks and nuns flank a standing Tlrthañkara (fig. 26). Carved in the left corner of the relief, when viewing the sculpture, is a seated monk who is much smaller in scale than the munis that precede him. Both his size and position within the relief indicate that this individual is either a newly ordained monk or of junior status within the order. Taking up a similar position at the end of the series of ãryikã s is a small female figure (fig. 27). However, it is clear that this individual is a laywoman.

Thus, like the munis, the ãryikã s are arranged in a cer- tain hierarchical order with the most important (and largest) figure closest to the Jina. While this gen- eral arrangement is reflected in the other three reliefs, the pecking order is more pronounced in this case due to the inclusion of the novitiate monk and the laywoman. Moreover, the lower status of the ãryikã s in the mendicant hierarchy is also expressed in this relief, as the nuns are carved at a lower ground line than the other figures.92 There are, of course, other subtle indications of the munis higher status. As mentioned previously, only the monks are seated on cushions. Also noteworthy is the large scale of the chief monk seated close to the Jina. His size not only dwarfs the other munis , but in effect challenges the figure of the stand- ing Tlrthañkara. In contrast to the bulky form of the chief monk, the Jina's importance in the relief is expressed through other means, such as his central position, his lotus pedestal, and the triple parasol over his head. Given the slender form and smaller scale of the Tlrthañkara in all four of the reliefs, I wonder whether these are scenes of bhãva püjä (mental devotion) directed to ajina mürti (image under worship).93 What is striking about these images is the fact that a group of ãryikã s is presented at all consider- ing their low status in medieval Digambara monastic society. The depiction is all the more curious as I am not aware of any similar group portraits in medieval Digambara Jain sculpture. One possible explanation may be that these sculptures were commissioned by members of the Yãpanlya sect. Now defunct, the sect was prevalent in southern India, particularly in northern Karnataka, in the fifth through the fourteenth century.94 Early medieval epigraphs directly associated with the Yäpanlyas abound in the present-day districts of Dharwar, Kolhapur, Belgaum, and Gulbarga and they indicate that Yãpanlya monastic communities were involved in the maintenance of Jain temples and images, showing a preference for the Jinas Neminãtha and Pãrsvanãtha.95 Some of these Jina sculptures are still enshrined in temples today and are now identified and worshipped as Digambara mürtis .9б In addi- tion, the seventh-century Meguti Jain temple at Aihole was commissioned by an individual who most likely belonged to this particular sect.97 The possibility of Yãpanlya patronage at Aihole is significant as a rock-cut cave at this site (c. mid-sixth or seventh century CE ) is often considered to be the "model" for Ellora's Jain excavations. 92 The lower position of the nuns in this relief may also be due to a problem in the rock, the result of a diagonal fissure extending across the sculpture above the nuns' heads. 93 As nuns and monks have no physical offerings to make, they participate in bhãva püjä, which consists of mental devo- tions and hymns directed towards the Jina image. Members of the laity can perform bhãva püjä and dravya püjä , the latter practice involving the offering of material objects such as food, flowers, lamps, and incense.

For the Yãpanlyas, ascetic nudity was not required to attain moksa , either for males or females. Although male ascetics in this sect typically abandoned all monastic garb and thus physically resembled Digambara munis, one could attain liberation with a modicum of clothing.98 Yãpanlyas not only refuted the Digambara position on nudity as a requirement for mendicancy and moksa , but they also proposed that women were both physically and mentally capable of traveling the ascetic's path. In fact, the Yãpanlya text Strïnirvânaprakarana (A Treatise on the Nirvãna of Women), written by the ninth-century mendicant Sãkatãyana, is the first authoritative work to argue that ãryikãs could attain moksa in their present lifetime." Although this text comprises only approximately fifty verses, it set the stage for later arguments put forth by various Svetãmbara authors in support of female mendicancy and liberation. The higher status of nuns in Yãpanlya monastic society, as well as the fact that monks from this sect physically resembled Digambara munis , is strong evidence indeed for asso- ciating Ellora's reliefs with this particular group, especially since the sculptures present the ãryikã s on almost equal footing with the naked munis. Moreover, some of the names of Yãpanlya ãcãryas recorded in the northern Karnataka inscriptions contain the suffix - nandi , much like our Ellora monks Nãganandi and Dlpanandi.100 Given the strong presence of the Yãpanlyas in Karnataka at this time, as well as the Kannada epigraphs associated with Ellora's sculptures, we should at least consider Yãpanlya patronage at the site. While Yãpanlya patronage may have occurred at Ellora, it is also important to recognize that the group portraits in J25, like all others, are deliberately constructed. While certain elements may reflect historical reality, others may highlight what the donors and/or artists perceived as relevant character- istics that should be represented. Thus, there are two ways that we can interpret the visual record doc- umented in these reliefs: (1) either Ellora's monks and nuns actually operated as a relatively cohesive community, or (2) they wanted to present themselves in such a manner. The presentation of munis and ãryikã s as a united and fairly large community is quite interesting when we consider the historical context of the late ninth and tenth centuries, especially in regard to the structure and organization of Jain religious traditions. During the early medieval period, Digam- bara and Yãpanlya ascetic communities were divided into a number of sects and subsects based largely on preceptorial and regional connections.101 These various ascetic groups naturally held that their own customs and practices were more orthodox than others, leading to sectarian rivalries on issues such as the use of a monk's whiskbroom and a settled versus a peripatetic lifestyle. However, by the ninth cen- tury many mendicants lived year-round in monastic establishments that were located near or adjacent to Jain temples. According to Paul Dundas, permanent monastic living was a practice which later Digambara writers were to stigmatise as a sign of decadence, an unhappy compromise in the corrupt world age when ascetic values were declining. Depictions of Digam- 98 According to Padmanabh S.

In essence, these individuals became the visual spokesmen and prop- agators of medieval Jainism. With the emergence of these powerful figures, coupled with the fact that disparate groups of Jain ascetics had no collective or mutually agreed upon identity, the number of naked muni s started to decline during the medieval period. Rather than forming a cohesive group, monks appeared to have been independent operators in their pursuit of spiritual liberation. In his analysis of medieval inscrip- tions from Karnataka, Michael Carrithers notes: Indeed, it is difficult to discern in the southern Digambar epigraphical literature any more than the bare mention of munis , and certainly there is little evidence that munis existed as a saňgha, that is, as a corporation within society. It is even possible that for a good deal of Digambar history ini- tiation as a muni occurred mostly as an option exercised late in life, as is the case today, or on the point of death. Digambar Jainism presents us with the spectacle of an ascetic religion that has got along very well without the ascetics.104 While medieval epigraphical sources (both Digambara and Yâpanïya) record the names of individual monks, they are often linked with high-powered bhattãraka s who are also mentioned in the inscrip- 102 Ibid., Ю 6.

See Michael Carrithers, "Naked Ascetics in Southern Digambar Jainism," Man 24, 2 (June 1989): 221. However, more recent studies under- taken by Peter Flügel indicate an increase in the number of Digambara mendicants in 2000 and 2001. See Flügel, "Demographic Trends in Jaina Monasticism," 355 (Table 12.8), 359. 222</page><page sequence="43">tions.105 This seems to have been the case at Ellora as well, for the title of bhattãraka is discernible within the fragments of the J25 Kannada inscriptions. Thus, what we might be seeing with Ellora's group portraits is a presentation of the site's community of monks and nuns that were, in actuality, slowly dwindling in number. This seems to be confirmed by the relatively few representations of mendicants in Ellora's thirteenth-century Jain monuments, located to the northeast of the site's main complex of Jain caves.106 CONCLUDING REMARKS ON PATRONAGE AT ELLORA The array of donor and devotee figures in Ellora's Jain caves clearly suggests the complexities of patron- age and devotional activity at the site. In my examinations, I have found that Ellora's Jain communi- ties consisted of a variety of individuals who were interested in image production. These figures, who range from ksatriyas and brahmacãrim to monastics and bhattãraka s, indicate that we need to recon- sider attributions of kingly patronage for these excavations. My examinations of Ellora's Jain images also show that a great number of devotional and artistic activities took place within these monuments in the late ninth and tenth centuries. According to the visual and epigraphical evidence, Ellora's Jain caves were recognized as an important Jain tirtha , par- ticularly for Jain communities that lived further south. This is supported by the presence of three dona- tive inscriptions written in a Kannada script.107 The images associated with these inscriptions suggest that Ellora was important not only to southern Digambara Jains but possibly to members of the Yãpanlya sect as well who were prominent in northern Karnataka. If this is the case, then we might need to reconsider Ellora's affiliation as a site that catered solely to Digambaras. The interest in presenting the donor/devotee in a perpetual act of veneration - as seen in the Jain caves - seems to have also made an impression on some of the site's later Hindu imagery. Prior to the ninth century, almost all humans represented in relief carvings in Ellora's Hindu caves appear as part of a particular narrative. The clearest example perhaps is one of the many reliefs that depict the puranic episode of Mãrkandeya. Mãrkandeya was a devotee of Siva and is portrayed in the reliefs worshipping a Siva linga. According to various textual accounts, he was fated an early death at the hands of Yama, who is depicted in Ellora's carvings in the act of slipping a noose around his victim's neck. However, at the moment of contact, Siva springs forth from the liňga and destroys the god of death with a swift kick of his heel and a thrust of his trident. Mãrkandeya is thus saved and can continue his devotions. Scenes of this narrative, with all of the key elements, appear in Cave 15 and on the exterior of the 105 For Digambara examples, see Settar, Inviting Death , 9, n. 23, 89, 169-70, 183, and 190-91, among others. For the Yãpanlyas, see Upadhye, "More Light on the Yãpanlya Sangha," 13-14» I7- 106 Ellora's thirteenth-century monuments are typically not included in studies on the site, nor are they visited by tourists as they are not part of the World Heritage designation. For an examination of these monuments, see Lisa N. Owen, "Beyond Buddhist and Brahmanical Activity: The Place of the Jain Rock-Cut Excavations at Ellora" (Ph.D. diss., University of Texas at Austin, 2006), 252-62. 107 Continued contact with communities further south is also indicated by a few fourteenth-century inscriptions written in a Kannada script that are found within the Kailãsanãtha complex. See Burgess and Indraji, Inscriptions from the Cave- Temples of Western India , 97-98. 223</page><page sequence="44">Kailãsanãtha temple. Both carvings date from the mid-eighth to early ninth century. By the mid-ninth century, however, another presentation of devotion appears in Ellora's Hindu caves, one that features an anonymous human worshipper at the feet of a Hindu deity. A few scenes of human worship, for example, can be found along the elevated, pillared gallery that forms the back of the Kailãsanãtha temple enclosure. Carved along the back walls of this gallery is a series of large-scale images of various Hindu deities. The majority of reliefs are Šaiva with the excep- tion of those carved in the south gallery that feature the god Visnu and his avatãras. Both the style and location of these reliefs suggest that they were carved well after the completion of the temple proper, most likely in the mid to late ninth century.108 Each relief within the gallery is framed by pilasters and typically presents the deity in iconic form. Although there are a total of forty-three reliefs, only five depict deities accompanied by human devotees. Three images are found in the east (rear) gallery: a Siva with Nandi, an image of Harihara, and a four-armed Visnu in añjali mudrã with his upper hands holding a lotus and a conch. The remaining two reliefs, located in the southern (right) gallery, depict Visnu with a mace and discus, and Krsna supporting Mount Govardhana. All five of the panels have a single male lay devotee carved in a lower corner of the relief. With the exception of Siva's devotee, all of the worshippers are adorned with headgear, necklaces, and bracelets. They are presented on one or both knees with their hands in añjali mudrã. While the male worship- ping Siva also presses his hands together in homage, he is portrayed in a standing position. This par- ticular devotee is also noteworthy for his ascetic appearance as he wears only a loincloth ( kauplna). Visu- ally, there is a striking similarity between this figure and the ascetic male devotees presented in hom- age of Pãrsvanãtha in Ellora's Jain excavations. In addition to these five gallery images, there are six small reliefs along the base of the enclosure walls of the Kailãsanãtha complex that depict human devotees paying homage to Siva.109 These reliefs, measuring approximately 30 centimeters high, depict anthropomorphic forms of the god, who is flanked by either standing or seated male ascetics. In one sculpture, an enthroned Siva is worshipped by an ascetic male who is seated on a wooden stool (fig. 28). 110 He has long hair that reaches the middle of his back, is bare-chested, and appears to be wearing only a loincloth. He faces Siva with his hands clasped in homage. Across from this devotee is a female worshipper who sits upon a more elaborate seat and is adorned with jewelry and an ornate headpiece. She too faces Siva and makes a gesture of homage. Given their location and execution, these reliefs of human devotion - like the gallery images - appear to have been created after the completion of the main temple. Thus, they are contemporary in date to the Jain donative images and seem to reveal a new interest in including representations of human worshippers within the site's Kailãsanãtha complex. 108 For an in-depth look at the relative chronology of Kailasa's monuments, see M. K. Dhavalikar, "Kailasa: The Stylis- tic Development and Chronology," Bulletin of the Deccan College Research Institute 41 (1982): 33-45. 109 Two reliefs are located at the base of the northern (left) gallery preceding the Lañkesvara temple while two others are found in front of an unfinished two-pillared cave. A single relief of a standing Siva with devotees is carved at the base of the eastern (rear) gallery near the southeastern corner, while a seated Siva with a solitary devotee is found at the base of the southern (right) gallery. no This relief is found at the base of the northern (left) gallery preceding the Lañkesvara temple. It differs from the oth- ers in that the devotees are carved on a scale similar to that of Siva. 224</page><page sequence="45">As these images are not inscribed, it is difficult to determine whether they are portraits of specific donors such as we have seen in Ellora's Jain caves. In fact, throughout the entire Kailäsanätha com- plex, there is only one donative inscription dating to the mid-eighth or ninth century that identifies an actual patron. The inscription is carved next to an over-life-sized relief of Gaja-LaksmI and it records that this sculpture is the gift of one Bhadrañkura of the Rädhe family ( kula ) ,ш While nothing is known of this patron, the relief of Gaja-LaksmI is seen by everyone who enters the Kailäsanätha complex as it is carved at the entrance and one must pass by it in order to see the temple proper. The dedication of this relief, not by a Rästraküta king but by an individual from an important and perhaps local fam- ily, is indeed significant, particularly since the sculpture plays such a prominent role in one's experi- ence of the temple. When we take a closer look at the art historical evidence at Ellora, we start to see a very different picture of patronage than what is typically presented in the scholarship on the site. The caves at Ellora seem to have been sustained and expanded not by Rästraküta kings, but primarily through the efforts of those who worshipped there. The range of devotees and donative acts attest to the site's efficacy as a sacred tïrtha , a designation that was established early in its history and most likely attracted its first recorded royal visit by the king Dantidurga. This visit in turn may have solidified Ellora's status as an important religious center and accelerated the commissioning of images and perhaps entire excava- tions by devoted individuals and monastic communities. Given the plethora of devotee and donor por- traits at the site - combined with our knowledge of India's medieval period as an age dominated by regional cultural units - we should be able to at least consider other means of patronage at Ellora apart from the royal family. And, perhaps more importantly, further consideration of the site's Jain imagery will shed light on the much neglected developments in Jain artistic practice.
