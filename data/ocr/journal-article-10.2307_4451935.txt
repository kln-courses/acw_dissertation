<plain_text><page sequence="1">Stdents' Ideas About Ptants ac Plant Growth CHARLES R. BARMAN MARY STEIN SHANNAN MCNAIR NATALIE S. BARMAN ring the elementary grades, children build understanding of biological concepts through direct, con- crete experiences with living things, their life cycles, and their habitats (National Research Council, 1996). Research has shown that children and adults often develop under- standing about their physical and natural world which are quite different to those presented by the scientific commu- nity (Osborne &amp; Freyberg, 1985; Angus, 1981). To examine young students' ideas about plants and plant growth, an invitation in Science &amp; Children was extended to K-8 teachers to participate in a national study (Barman, Stein, Barman &amp; McNair, 2002). Along with the invitation was a protocol that instructed teachers to con- duct student interviews and record their responses. Specifically, students were asked to look at pictures of 12 items and indicate whether they believed the item was a plant or not a plant. They then were asked to explain what all plants have in common. With a second set of pictures of 12 items, students were asked to identify the things that plants need to grow. Again, after they made their selec- tions, they were asked to explain how each of the items they selected help plants to grow. Two hundred twenty- seven individuals from 16 states in the United States, one United States Territory, and one Canadian Province responded to this invitation and contributed data from more than 2400 students. Rationale for Study In previous work with students, a number of researchers (McNair &amp; Stein, 2001; Tunnicliffe &amp; Reiss, 2000; Osborne &amp; Freyberg, 1985; Stepans,1985; Bell, 1981) have found that students' understandings of plants and what plants need to grow are often limited. For exam- ple, in McNair and Stein's research (2001), when asked to draw a plant, children and adults alike often drew, or thought about, flowering plants. Similarly, Bell (1981) found that some children did not consider trees to be plants. It was also found that many students did not con- sider an organism to be a plant unless it possessed specif- ic characteristics or parts such as a flower or stem. Alternatively, some students thought that nonliving exam- ples or other organisms were plants simply because they had structures that resembled a flower or stem. The first research question, Is this a plant or not a plant?, sought to provide information on students' ideas about what they believe characterizes a "plant." The set of pictures were comprised of a range of items-some that we believed would be fairly obvious to most students (e.g., a flower) to items that would probably be difficult for many to distin- guish based on the characteristics (e.g., mushroom). We wondered to what extent flowering plants would continue to be the most easily identified category of plants. Are today's students still having difficulty, as past research sug- gested, identifying trees, bushes, or grass as plants? Finally, some items that might provide the need for greater expla- nation were included in the selection. For example, when deciding whether items with very plant-like characteristics, such as a mushroom or a walking stick, are plants, stu- dents may feel more of a need to explain their reasoning. When considering the second question, What do plants need to grow?, ideas can become even more compli- cated. According to the National Science Education Standards (National Research Council, 1996), students in grades K-4 should understand that plants have basic needs that include air, water, nutrients, and light. The idea that plants need things provided by people may make more sense to young students. For example, we plant plants in soil, water them, and set them in a lighted space. These needs may be more obvious to students than the idea that plants need air to grow. In addition, students often ascribe human characteristics, or anthropomorphic explanations, CHARLES R.

For exam- ple, students often believe that plants need "food" in a way that is similar to food that people eat. So when they hear that plants make their own food, they are often think- ing about food in terms of some- thing that the plant ingests or "eats" (Roth, 1985; Smith, &amp; Anderson, 1984). Because the National Science Education Standards (1996) outline specific things K-8 students should know about plants (Table 1) and previous data indicated that elemen- tary students had difficulty under- standing some major ideas about plants and plant growth, it seemed appropriate to initiate an investigation to determine the current thinking of elementary and middle school stu- dents related to these topics. Plants are a vital component to our Earth. They are the basic connection between the sun and the energy flow that exists in all ecosystems. Students have daily experiences with plants from an early age and should know a great deal about plants as they combine their daily observations and experiences with concepts presented each year in school. However, miscon- ceptions are also introduced and reinforced at early ages. Understanding these misconceptions can help us to better address them in the classroom. Data Collection &amp; Analyses As indicated earlier, the investigators who participat- ed in this study followed an interview protocol that was included with the 2002 Science &amp; Children invitation. In this protocol, the investigators were provided with one set of pictures depicting plants and objects that are not plants and another set of pictures showing things plants need or don't need for growth. Using the first set of pic- tures, the investigators asked each student to identify those illustrations that are plants and when they com- pleted the classification task, they were also asked to explain what all plants have in common. With the sec- ond set of pictures, the students were asked to identify the things plants need for growth and to explain how each of the things they identified as needed for plant growth actually helps a plant grow. The students' responses to both sets of pictures are shown in Tables 2- 4. A proportional analysis of the frequency of "yes" responses between grade levels was conducted using Stata (Statacorp, 2003) to determine whether significant differences existed between the responses in each grade category. The results of these analyses are also shown in Tables 2-4. Reviewing the Data Results of Which Items Were Plants The K-8 students had a consistent and fairly good grasp of which pictures were plants and those that were not (Tables 2-4). For example, most of the students (95% or more) were able to identify a flower as a plant and there was consensus that the bush and the fern were plants. Most of the students knew that bread mold wasn't a plant (74% or more), however, about half (50-60%) misclassified a mushroom as a plant. In this case, the stalk of the mush- room resembles the stem of a plant. Significant differences were apparent in the way K-8 students identified plants (Tables 2-4). Over 50% of the K- 5 students believed a seed was a plant versus 37% of the students in grades 6-8. Students in grades 6-8 appeared to have more difficulty identifying certain organisms as plants than the students in grades K-5. For example, 78% of the students in grades 6-8 identified grass as a plant while 86% of the students in grades 3-5 identified grass as a plant. A similar pattern was shown in how the students classified an oak tree (78% for grades 6-8 versus 88% for grades 3-5) and a pine tree (77% for grades 6-8 versus 84% for grades K-2 and 86% for grades 3-5). When reviewing information about the students' ver- bal responses and explanations, it became evident that characteristics that students strongly associate with plants are that they have leaves, stems, are green, and grow in the ground/soil. Although some significant differences were observed between the grade levels, students generally selected the flower, fern, and bush as being examples of plants and these examples clearly show the aforemen- tioned characteristics. Some significant differences were also observed in their classification of grass, the oak tree, the pine tree, and the Venus Flytrap; however, the percent- ages of students who thought these were plants were still 74 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 68, NO.2, FEBRUARY 2006</page><page sequence="3">Table 2.

Bell (1981) found that children did not consid- er trees plants, and more often referred to flowering plants as "plants." This may be due to limited classification skills rather than specific content knowledge about plants. An example of this can be observed with one student's verbal response when asked whether a tree is a plant. The response was, "No, it's a tree." In addition, very few stu- dents believed that the walking stick, telephone pole, or bread mold were plants. For example, one student's response to bread mold was "It can't grow, its not alive." The two items that appeared to be most difficult for stu- dents to characterize were seeds and the mushroom. This is not surprising because seeds have the potential of becoming a plant and mushrooms have many plant-like characteristics. A student reasoned, "It has no blooms or flowers" and therefore decided the seed was not a plant, again supporting Bell's (1981) findings. Results of What Plants Need To Grow Tables 2-4 display the K-8 students' ideas about what a plant needs for growth. Although some significant differ- ences exist between the grade levels, the majority of the K-8 students identified the sun, water, potting soil, air, and plant food as the most important factors in plant growth. About 60% of all of the students believed oxygen was needed for growth and less than half of the students thought earthworms were needed for growth. As would be expected, significantly fewer stu- dents in K-2 (30%) and 3-5 (59%) believed carbon dioxide was important compared to 65% of the students in grades 6-8. In addition, a significantly smaller percentage of the K-5 students versus students in grades 6-8 considered a light bulb important for plant growth. When considering what plants need in order to grow, students tended to por- tray plants as requiring what humans need in order to grow. For example, the ideas that plants "eat," "drink," and "breathe" occurred frequently. The stu- dents observe plants as being provided sunlight, water, and food externally, much like their idea of how they themselves take in food and water to grow, or stand in the sun to be warmer. When talking about the sun, the K-2 students generally said it helps the plant grow by warming the plant. Students in grades 3-8 said the sun helps the plant make food, it gives the plant energy, and it provides heat for the plant. Even though some of these stu- dents stated that the sun helps plants make food and gives plants energy, there was very little discussion about photosyn- thesis or the process of how plants make their own food. The students' discussion showed no appar- ent link between carbon dioxide and photosynthesis. When talking about the importance of water for plants, the students generally felt it was needed for the plant to "drink" or it provided nutrients for the plant. Likewise, plant food was seen as providing food for plants. As one student stat- ed: "Plant food keeps the plant from getting hungry." Even young children seemed to understand that plants need water and sunlight. For example, one student said, "Sun gives light, warmth and food." A surprising number of K-2 students also understood that plants need air (78%). This could also be because they know that humans need air and consider plants to need the same things that we do. Significantly fewer K-2 students (Tables 2-3) believed that plants needed oxygen and sometimes explained that they thought that oxygen and air were the PLANTS &amp; PLANT GROWTH 75</page><page sequence="4">Table 3.

In addition, significantly fewer students in grades K-5 versus those in grades 6-8 felt that carbon diox- ide was needed for plant growth. One younger student called it "a poison." Some students indicated that a reverse type of breathing took place with plants breathing in carbon dioxide and exhal- ing oxygen. Discussion The students in this study were grouped as grades K-2, 3-5, and 6-8. This is similar to the way the National Science Education Standar-ds (National Research Council, 1996) indicate what students should know in elementary and middle school (Table 1). Asking about plants was of interest because plants are not only a part of our daily experience and of the environment around us, but they are a topic addressed at every grade level in school. As students learn more about plants in each successive grade, it is expected they will become familiar with plant structure, plant needs, plant growth and reproduction, and eventually under- stand more complex concepts, such as the role of plants in the ecosystem, plant diversity, genetics, and molecular struc- ture. In this discussion we will make an effort to tie some of the students' respons- es to some of the K-4 and 5-8 standards dealing with plants. The K-4 standards indicate that by the time the students reach 5th grade, they should know plants need air, water, nutrients, and light. The K-2 students did not appear to make a connection between plants needing air and water for food pro- duction. Instead, they talked about the plant needing air for "breathing" and water for "drinking." In previous studies researchers found that students, from young children through high school, had misconceptions that included plants not needing air, or breathing, much like people and other animals (Canal, 1999). Even when students understand that carbon dioxide is utilized in food production, they think of it as a reverse type of breathing with oxygen being "exhaled." They also indicated that the sun provided warmth for the plants but did not talk about sunlight as necessary for plant growth. These appear to be age appropriate responses for this group of students. Many of the students in grades 3-8 identified air, water, nutrients, and sunlight as important for plant growth. However, a good portion of the students in grades 3-5 believed that the air was needed for breathing and the water was for plants to drink. It was unclear as to what role the grades 3-5 students believed light and nutrients played in plant growth. For example, many thought that sunlight provided heat and warmth for the plant and some believed that plants needed food "to keep them from getting hun- gry." Similar to related studies, students are more likely to see sunlight as something helpful to plant growth, but not essential (Canal, 1999). Although the middle school stu- dents appeared to agree that sunlight and nutrients were important for plant growth, their understandings of the components of the grades 5-8 standards dealing with how plants make food and how energy is passed through an ecosystem were unclear. Plus, the fact that many of these students still clung to the idea of plants "breathing air" and "drinking water" leads one to believe that they have a lim- ited understanding of how plants make food. A few of the grades 6-8 students indicated that an arti- ficial light could take the place of sunlight in providing energy for plants. This notion was generally absent in any of the K-5 responses. It's possible that only a few students 76 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 68, NO.2, FEBRUARY 2006</page><page sequence="5">Table 4.

It is also possible that these students viewed the picture of the light bulb as the bulb itself rather than light from a light bulb. Only a few of the K-2 students iden- tified roots as a common structure of a plant and some of these students said that potting soil "holds the plant in the ground." It appears that the K-2 students need more experiences observing differ- ent root systems of plants. Through these observations, they may come to the real- ization that these structures are an inte- gral part of a plant and that they are responsible for anchoring the plant. Although students are typically taught the external "parts" of a plant during the early years of school, they are prone to focus on what they can see, what is visi- ble-which in many cases are the stem, leaf, and perhaps flowers. According to Canal (1999), despite the effort made to teach students about the basic function of plant parts (i.e., roots) there are fewer learning activities or assignments focused on function than on basic struc- ture. There also appears to be a need to help the K-2 students visualize plants as living things. This notion seems to become more prevalent among the views of the students in grades 3-8. The National Standards indicate that students in grades 5-8 should know that all organisms are composed of cells. This means that students in the middle grades should know that plants contain cells and that the cells of plants have basic dif- ferences from animal cells (e.g., presence of cell walls and plastids). However, the idea of plants containing cells was absent from the middle school students' responses in this study. This could be because the pictures used in this study's protocol did not elicit this type of information. Although there was a significant difference between each grade level with regards to the importance of plant food (Tables 2-4), a large percentage in each category felt plant food was essential for plant growth. This could be because students view the plant food as containing the nutrients that plants need in order to grow, but based on what they said about plant food, it is more likely a result of the misnomer of "plant food." Instead of fertilizer, these students view it as a source of food for the plant. As one K- 2 student stated, "Like humans, plants need food to sur- vive." Another middle school student made a similar state- ment, "Plant food is like human food." As found in similar studies (Canal, 1999), elementary students have a persist- ent notion that the food source has to come from outside of the organism. Ozay and Oztas (2003) found that even secondary students largely misunderstood the process of food production. Students at all grade levels could benefit from investigations that compare plant growth with and without plant food. It might also be helpful if teachers made the point that plant food is actually fertilizer that pro- vides nutrients for plants and is not a source of food. Another interesting finding in this study was that for some plant specimens, namely the oak tree and grass, there was a trend of significantly fewer students identifying these as plants in the early grades (K-2) and middle grades (6-8), with the greatest numbers identifying these as plants in grades 3-5. While there are many possible explanations, one possibility is that students begin with a fairly narrow definition of a "plant" and subsequently broaden it as they PLANTS &amp; PLANT GROWTH 77</page><page sequence="6">Table 5.

Then, as students learn more about scientific classifi- cation schemes they begin to narrow these broadened def- initions once again. Teaching Implications Through this study, we were able to identify some common student misconceptions about plants and plant growth. Some examples of these misconceptions, the stu- dent explanations that led to their identification, and some teaching implications are provided in Table 5. After review- ing the results, we found that the students' verbal expla- nations of what they were thinking, and why, were very helpful in understanding students' existing concepts about plants. For example, when a student indicates that he/she believes that a tree is not a plant, it is more impor- tant to find out why the student has that belief rather than simply focusing on whether the answer is correct. Informal conversations with children can reveal more about their understandings than responses to closed questions. Even young students appeared to understand many basic characteristics of plants and their needs. Knowing this, teachers can move beyond what is already understood into ideas about plants that students haven't considered. Providing real examples of non-flowering plants or plants without the typical features that students are familiar with may help them to broaden their understandings. Letting children "dig in" to observe root structures and consider their functions may help them to think more deeply about how plants are different from animals. Similarly, when ask- ing students what plants need in order to grow, the teacher can ask students whether there is anything that a house plant needs to grow that humans do not have a role in pro- viding. Students at all grade levels attributed anthropomor- phic characteristics to plants, such as breathing, drinking, and eating, in their explanations of plant needs. It is in this realm that the teacher's role is critical in helping students go beyond their existing understandings. The teacher can help students understand ways that plants are different from humans in form and function. The teacher can also help students understand ideas that may not be readily observable to students. For example, when a bee travels from flower to flower, what exactly is it doing? Student interpretations of this included delivering things like 78 THE AMERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER, VOLUME 68, NO.2, FEBRUARY 2006</page><page sequence="7">honey from flower to flower and "sharing" resources among the flowers. The idea that the bee is obtaining a substance that it needs and, in the process, that it also aids in plant reproduction is foreign to young students. Conclusion The investigators identified several misconceptions that K-8 students have regarding plants and plant growth. This information can be useful to the teachers of these stu- dents and to prospective teachers of these children. For example, it was clear from comments received from the teacher investigators that, through the student interviews, they not only gained a better understanding of their stu- dents' ideas about plants, but also gained insight into the kinds of activities that might help them develop deeper understandings of these organisms. As one teacher indi- cated: "I learned so nmuch about my students' way of think- ing and the effectiveness of my teaching methods." Another teacher indicated: "After obtaining the informa- tion from the interviews, I can see where I need to make future modifications in my plant unit." It appears that this investigation has made an impact on the teaching strategies of these teachers. Research has shown that students' prior knowledge could significantly influence classroom teaching and learning (Lumpe &amp; Staver, 1995). Hopefully, this study will also serve as a cat- alyst to other teachers to seek ways of probing their stu- dents' understanding of various science concepts and will help them guide their future planning of units dealing with plants. In the case of teachers who will be working with these students in the future, the information from this study may serve as a reality check of what information their students will bring to their classes about plants, plant growth, etc. As this study indicates, students' views of specific science topics may be very different from the accepted beliefs. Therefore, it is good educa- tional practice to find out what your students know before engaging them in any new information. References Angus, J. W. (1981).
