<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES AND NEWS EDITED BY CLEMENT W. MEIGHAN GENERAL The summer of 1955 was an exceedingly active and productive field season for American archaeology. A few statistics on the projects reported here for the sum- mer are a good demonstration of the growth experi- enced since World War II. The figures are not precise, because not all projects get reported in NOTES AND NEWS, and because various details are sometimes omit- ted from the reports. However, a reasonable approxi- mation to work accomplished is reported, and the figures for this are quite impressive. They include (for summer 1955 only): Institutions and organizations sponsoring field work: 58 Survey projects: 26 Excavation projects: 56 Field Schools: 10 Number of persons in the field during the summer: at least 300. In addition to this field activity the meetings of the Pecos Conference, the Great Basin Conference, and the Ohio Valley Archaeological Conference were held dur- ing the summer. Four special seminars sponsored by the Carnegie Foundation also met in different parts of the country. The analytical work thus made some at- tempt to keep up with the digging. Although comparative figures are not available for other years, it is clear that the 1955 season must be near the record for summer activity. Some new areas were investigated during the sum- mer, but much of the work continues to be concen- trated in better-known regions such as the Southwest (5 of the field schools were here), and the high-culture centers of Mesoamerica and South America. Large areas of the New World remain unexplored archaeologically, and a greater diversification of effort would be reward- ing. NORTHEAST ONTARIO. In cooperation with the University of To- ronto, the Royal Ontario Museum of Archaeology exca- vated the so-called Serpent Mounds at Rice Lake. Under Kenneth E. Kidd's general supervision and direction, W. Richard Adams conducted the field work. Prelimi- nary explorations and the mapping of the site were the principal activities. Continued work is anticipated dur- ing the 1956 season. The existence of these mounds, a rare manifestation in Ontario, has been known for many years. No definite statement as to their content has yet appeared. NEW YORK. The New York State Museum and Sci- ence Service began a major program of survey and excavation on Long Island, where rapid expansion of population is destroying numerous archaeological sites. Following a preliminary reconnaissance by William H. Sears, William A. Ritchie with a crew of 3, during August, excavated an extensive habitation site near Stony Brook, on the north shore. This site appears to be of considerable significance in the eastern New York area because it is one of the very few components of the little-known, apparently Early Woodland complex, characterized almost exclusively by the use of the nar- row-bladed, "fishtail" type of point, a primary marker for the Orient focus. This focus has so far been defined only on the basis of 4 burial sites on eastern Long Island exhibiting what Ritchie has described as the "northern burial cult." Several other Long Island sites were tested and will be excavated next season. During the past summer a new publication appeared -Bulletin of the Nassau Archeological Society, Vol. 1, No. 1. Its contents will be of particular interest to stu- dents of southern New England and greater New York City archaeology. Lawrence M. Conant, 72 Hilton Ave., Garden City, Long Island, N.Y., is the editor. In this issue reports on the activities of the society's members are accompanied by comments on the archaeological sequence in coastal New York and on kaolin pipes bearing the initials "TD." Edward D. Patterson reports that continued work in the Garvie Point site on Glen Cove, L.I., indicates an archaic occupation. He also notes that the Muskeota Cove site on Long Island is being investigated and Orient-like material is being found in the lowest levels. Julius Lopez has compiled the information available on the Schurz site located on Throgs Neck in Bronx County. Here recent excavations by Harry Trowbridge and George Younkheere and others have provided a number of potsherds, post- molds, and lithic materials. His study of the sherds indicates a series of occupations ranging from the North Beach focus of the Windsor aspect to the early Clasons Point focus of the East River aspect. The work on the site is hindered by modern structures and the remains of a colonial dwelling. NEW JERSEY. The RCA site near Princeton Junction in New Jersey was excavated during late July and August under the sponsorship of the David Sarnoff Research Center, Radio Corporation of America, by the Archeological Society of New Jersey, State Museum, Trenton. Under the supervision of Dorothy Cross, the work was conducted by Donald D. Hartle, of Hunter College. This is a stratified site producing steatite ves- sel fragments in the lower levels. Steatite-tempered pot- sherds also were present as were later pottery types. This site is one of the less disturbed sites in New Jersey and appears to have been occupied during the Archaic, Early Woodland, and late periods. 334</page><page sequence="2">NOTES AND NEWS NINTH CONFERENCE ON IROQUOIS RESEARCH The usefulness of the informal research conference for exploring some central theme for identifying new research problems and for reporting research accom- plished was again achieved October 14-16 when stu- dents of the Iroquois Indians of New York and Ontario met for the ninth time in 10 years at Red House, New York, to discuss the theme of "Exploring Ways of Achieving Cooperation in Anthropological Studies in the Northeast." This theme provided a vehicle for dis- cussing state and local relationships in archaeology, pro- fessional and amateur responsibilities in archaeology and ethnology, the roles of local and regional museums, relationships between universities as training centers, and the opportunities provided by the conference for field work. The conference was limited to 35 invited participants who had recently contributed to the ad- vancement of Iroquian research, of whom 28 attended. The Red House conferences are traditionally family affairs and until the rains of this year, the glorious autumn weather has made these weekends a pleasant outing. For the continued use of the administration building and quarters of the Allegany State Park, the conference is again indebted to Charles E. Congdon, chairman of the Allegany State Park Commission, and to M. H. Deerdorf of Warren, Pennsylvania, who was host at the "doings" of the Very Little Water Society. The annual Iroquois Conference owes its inspiration to the late F. G. Speck and has from the beginning been organized and chaired by W. N. Fenton, who this year was assisted in planning by W. A. Ritchie and C. E. Gillette. The conference has no formal organiza- tion and no regular members. The attendance com- prises mainly anthropologists, many of whom are part time workers in archaeology, ethnology, language, and history - the only prerequisite being an active and con- tributing interest to some phase of Iroquoian studies. The agenda included a discussion of state and local relations led by John Witthoft, Pennsylvania Museum Commission; professional and amateur relations led by William A. Ritchie, State Archeologist, New York State Museum and Science Service; museum and university relations, Irving Rouse, Yale University; ethnologist and Indian, Anthony F. C. Wallace, University of Penn- sylvania; and the structure of suppport, W. N. Fenton. This discussion lasted throughout Saturday and was actively engaged in by everyone present. Those who did not have a chance to say all that occurred to them in meeting carried on in small groups far into the night. On Sunday morning we heard from the "new voices" in Iroquoian research who were introduced by Wallace. These included Jacob Gruber, Temple Uni- versity, Philadelphia, on a study of artistic styles in Iroquois masks; Cara B. Richards, Cornell University, on a study of women's roles at Onondaga; David Landy, Department of Social Relations, Harvard University, on child rearing practices of the Tuscarora; Anne Marie Shimony of Yale University, on the longhouse commu- nities of Six Nations Reserve, Ontario. The chairman summarized the high points of the conference as follows: 1. The need had been identified for an archaeological extension service from the New York State Museum and Science Service to local societies, schools, and col- lectors of New York antiquities. 2. The present type of conference on the theme of improving state and local relationships in antiquities of New York should be repeated at the local level, and such additional conferences are contemplated. 3. Sentiment favored education and diffusion of pro- fessional scientific knowledge to the use of legal sanc- tions to prevent vandalism of sites and it was held that an antiquities act would be unworkable. 4. National universities like Yale and Toronto should encourage research by state and local museums but must evaluate these programs in the light of national re- sponsibilities. And, it is recognized that Iroquoian studies in archaeology, ethnology, and linguistics have provided part-time research opportunities for the facul- ties and an opportunity for the training of graduate students. 5. It was evident that in arriving at an over-all pro- gram for the conference one must know the number of students available in the universities of the area and what parts of the program each university would as- sume. There is a need to identify a few solid projects in language, social relations and political organization, personality studies, and archaeology to show how the main concept of conservatism can be studied in relation to change, using the Iroquoian field as a laboratory. 6. From the "new voices" came the suggestion of a clearing house of research in progress and in the recent past so that young scholars might make their choice to approach the field in an intelligent manner. The discussions and recommendations on Saturday and Sunday followed the presentation of one solid paper which was appropriate to the theme for the con- ference and was delivered this year by the Very Rev- erend Thomas Grassmann of the Mohawk-Caughnawaga Museum at Fonda, New York, on "The Excavation of Historic Caughnawaga." Father Grassman's talk was illustrated by slides and highlighted, very appropriately, excellent cooperation between professional and amateur scholars in a local setting. Of the conference, this year, 2 things can be said: the conference identified a new field of research in the area of Indian education which is in the trend of the times when education and anthropology are finding common research interests. In the selection of the theme and in the candor with which it was discussed the conference touched one of the significant problem areas in the organization of scholarship: how to foster good communication between national, state, and local levels of the community of science without control flowing from the top; and provide the amateur, part- time scholar with a sense of full participation. EDITOR'S NOTE: The preceding conference report was prepared by William N. Fenton. A more detailed report of the archaeological discussions during the conference will appear in the next issue. 335</page><page sequence="3">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ILLINOIS. Southern Illinois University sponsored a 2- month field session in the Cache River valley under the supervision of Howard D. Winters, who was assisted by a staff of specialists from the university and a group of 9 students from several schools. A considerable por- tion of the work was financed by a grant from the National Science Foundation, with J. Charles Kelly as the senior researcher in charge of the Cache River Valley Project. The field work was undertaken as part of a long range program which will study the adaptations of the successive occupations of the Cache River valley to a single, although changing, ecological zone. Excavations during the present season were made in 3 sites pertain- ing to Archaic and Early Woodland occupations. In addition numerous surface collections were made on sites in the northern and central portions of the valley. These sites produced material ranging from Paleo-Indian to Late Woodland occupations. Practically no Mississip- pian material was found in the areas surveyed. Prelimi- nary analysis of the material has given interesting clues to the interpretation of occupation patterns and eco- logical adjustments within the valley. Intensive study of the artifacts is scheduled during 1955 and 1956, with assistance to be provided by a number of specialists. Ultimately the data from this area will be integrated into a program designed to study adaptations of early hunting-gathering groups to differing ecological zones and successive changes in environment in the eastern United States. On August 20 the Illinois State Museum concluded the first season of a proposed 3-season excavation pro- gram at the Modoc Rock Selter. This rock shelter, test excavated in 1953, yielded dates of 9000 to 10,000 years ago from the lowest levels. 'Over half of the site was excavated to 19 feet below datum level. Since the surface of the site varies this meant excavations varied from 2 to 10 feet in depth. An abundance of artifacts and other remains were col- lected. The artifacts indicate that the zones excavated belonged primarily to an Archaic period dating from approximately 2000 to 3000 B.C. Several flexed and bundle burials were excavated. Postholes indicated wind- breaks around several fireplaces. A major part of the work during this season was the testing of the soil deposits at the site for pollen. These tests were successful and pollen analysis will be a major part of future research at the Modoc Rock Shelter. John S. Tarr, a graduate student at the University of Arizona, served as geochronologist and made the tests for pollen. A botanist was in the field during the summer and made collections of present day flora which will be the basis of comparative study. Seeds of ragweed and hack- berry have been identified from the fire pits. Mechanical sifters and a conveyor belt were used and sped the work considerably, with better preservation of fragile material than was obtained through hand screen- ing. The field work was carried out by a crew of 14 students with Melvin Fowler as Director and Dick Keslin as Assistant Director. MlSSOURI. The University of Missouri was awarded a research grant of $22,500 by the U. S. Park Service, Region 3, to conduct salvage excavations in the Table Rock Reservoir area, Barry County, Missouri. The field work will be supervised by Carl H. Chapman, Director of American Archaeology at the University of Missouri. Two other University of Missouri field parties under the direction of Richard A. Marshall and Robert T. Bray have been working in the Table Rock area throughout the summer. Five shelters, 2 caves and a rock cairn were investigated by these parties. A grant from the Missouri Archaeological Society sponsored the excavation of a cave in Calloway County. J. Mett Shippee, who has been in charge of the exca- vation has found that the site may well be comparable to Graham Cave. So far there is evidence of 3 cultures, one of which ties in with the Graham Cave early man horizon. Richard O. Keslin has been added to the staff of the Department of Sociology and Anthropology in the posi- tions of Director of the Museum of Anthropology and Instructor in Anthropology. OHIO. The Ohio State Museum and Ohio State Uni- versity cooperated in an excavation of a large Adena mound. The site, known as the Niles-Wolford mound, is located approximately 6 miles northwest of Circle- ville, Ohio, near the village of Fox. Exploration revealed 2 subfloor tombs beneath the mound. The larger tomb, measuring 151/2 feet in length, 81/2 feet in width, and 31/2 feet deep, contained 5 extended burials; the smaller tomb contained 2 extended burials and a reburial de- posit of bones. Burials in both tombs were wrapped in textiles and placed between layers of bark. Large stem- med spear points, worked pieces of deer antler (atlatl handles), and bone awls were among the burial asso- ciations. The work was under the direction of Raymond S. Baby, Curator of Archaeology, assisted by Robert M. Goslin, with 8 university students. At the second meeting of the Ohio Valley Archaeo- logical Conference since its organization in 1953, arch- aeologists from Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, Ken- tucky, Indiana, Illinois, and Missouri met at the Angel Mounds, August 12-13. The general theme of the in- formal sessions was the Mississippian manifestations in the Ohio Valley with emphasis on the Angel site. The conference host, Glenn A. Black, conducted a tour of the site and exhibited the fine collections of artifacts recovered there. Brief reports were presented by the delegates on current field work in their areas. Chair- man of the conference was William Mayer-Oakes, Car- negie Museum, who was re-elected for 1956. The editor, John W. Bennett, Ohio State University, was also re- elected. Raymond S. Baby will serve as secretary- treasurer for 1956. WISCONSIN. Warren L. Wittry, Curator of Anthro- pology, State Historical Society of Wisconsin, spent the month of August, 1955, in the excavation of 4 rock- 336 [ XXI, 3, 1956</page><page sequence="4">NOTES ANID NEWWS shelter sites in Sauk County. The work was sponsored by the Wisconsin Archaeological Survey. At 3 of the sites operations were limited to testing, while at the 4th site the rather extensive excavations begun in 1954 were continued. All of the sites investigated are strati- fied, with one of them having a deposit over 9 feet in thickness and evidence of occupation -as deep as 71/2 feet. The bulk of the materials found represent the Archaic, Middle, and Late Woodland periods and their analysis will provide important information on these periods in central Wisconsin. SOUTHEAST FLORIDA. The Department of Anthropology and Arch- aeology of Florida State University conducted a summer field season in the vicinity of Ocklockonee Bay, Wakulla County. Most of the time was spent in a re-examination of the Nichols site, excavated by C. B. Moore in 1901. The mound proved to be predominantly Weeden Island II with Fort Walton period intrusions. Burials were confined to the upper part of the mound above a shell mantle. C. B. Moore dug a peripheral trench of varying width around the mound but left the central portion untouched. A small test in the Simmon's Lodge midden indi- cated a time span from Deptford to Fort Walton. A wall trench was traced for 15 feet and is probably a part of a Weeden Island structure. Survey in the Ocklockonee Bay area located a few additional sites, largely in the Weeden Island periods. Many shell middens have very little cultural material and are apparently only shell collecting stations. GEORGIA. The Columbus Museum of Arts sponsored 6 weeks exploration at the Ruud Plantation site on the lower Chattahoochee River below Columbus during July and August. Joseph R. Caldwell was in charge of oper- ations with several volunteer assistants from Fort Ben- ning. The summit of Temple Mound A was cleared to disclose parts of 5 building units and a wattle-and-daub wall around the top of the mound. Caldwell is prepar- ing a preliminary report for Early Georgia. The occu- pation on top of Mound A appears to have belonged to a Lamar-like culture with strong Savannah resem- blances. A deeper occupation is strongly reminiscent of Macon Plateau. Some Fort Walton materials are intermingled with the more recent Lamar focus. David W. Chase, a volunteer with Caldwell at the Ruud Plantation site, reports a large Early Swift Creek site at Hallocka Creek on the Fort Benning reservation. Surface collections and materials from stratigraphic test pits are to be studied at the University of Georgia. This site is of particular interest as Early Swift Creek sites are very rare in Georgia. The Hallocka Creek site shows an Early Swift Creek assemblage, with some Deptford check and simple-stamped wares, duplicated somewhat in the Santa Rosa-Swift Creek horizon of northwest Florida. Also present, apparently in good stratigraphic context below the Early Swift Creek levels, is fiber- tempered pottery and a presumptive late Archaic or prepottery horizon. Vernon Hurst, geologist with the State Geological Survey, and A. R. Kelly continued laboratory study of the factors of decomposition in selected weathered flints, cherts, and quartzites. Currently large stemmed projectile points of a metamorphosed siltstone or sand- stone, dubbed "aplite" in some reports and generally found in a Stallings Island context, are receiving special attention. Still more detailed study of the microstruc- ture of flint and chert will be possible as soon as X-ray equipment is installed in the new state offices now being completed. A. R. Kelly continued explorations for the second season on the west Mound B periphery and plaza area at Etowah Mounds State Park. Two additional Etowah period "trash pits" or saucer-like depressions were un- covered along with a portion of a second Wilbanks house pattern. The 2 field seasons now provide a gen- erous stratigraphic picture of Etowah chronology in terms of ceramics, relationship of Mound B structure to superimposed house floors in the village area, and the premound occupation. It is certain that the last period of mound building occurred in the Wilbanks period. A rich premound midden approximately 2 feet thick, plus accumulated fill in a premound saucer- shaped depression, 12 feet in diameter and 5 feet deep, indicate that Mound B was built in the Etowah IV and Wilbanks periods. An Etowah IV period house, with parallel post supports and no wall trench, was partially uncovered in place over the fill of one of the Etowah "saucers." After the Wilbanks occupation, along the west slope of Mound B, extending out into the pre- sumed plaza area, occurs an occupation which is neither Wilbanks nor North Georgia Lamar, since it lacks en- tirely Lamar rim features and incised pottery. This epi-Wilbanks or "early Lamar" has been tentatively called the "Tumlin" period. It overlies a 1-foot thick orange clay loam "platform" which extends west from the original feather edge of Mound B, with Etowah and Wilbanks deposits in position beneath it. Phillip E. Smith assisted during July at Mound B, Etowah, and during July and August carried out a sur- vey at Fort Mountain State Park, Chatsworth, for the Department of State Parks and the University of Geor- gia. The Fort Mountain survey was extended to other sites in the general piedmont area where stone walls and prehistoric stone structures had been reported. Smith, A. R. Kelly, and Joseph W. Johnson of Chatta- nooga visited key sites, doing some aerial reconnaissance and photography. Included in this survey were stone circles in Putnam County originally reported by A. R. Kelly and still more recent discoveries of "circles" in Habersham County. Phillip Smith will prepare a pre- liminary survey report this fall. Clemens De Baillou continued survey at New Echota and visited Oklahoma's various historical societies and museums with Henry Malone, historian with the Atlanta Division of the University of Georgia. They uncovered additional information on the Council Chamber at New Echota. 337</page><page sequence="5">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY OKLAHOMA. A University of Oklahoma field party under the direction of Robert E. Bell spent 6 weeks excavating in a small portion of an extensive Fulton period site. The site, which includes mounds, extends along the west bank of the Glover River in McCurtain County. SOUTHWEST The 1955 Pecos Conference was held at the Labora- tory of Anthropology in Santa Fe on August 15, 16, and 17. The conference was welcomed by Boaz Long, Di- rector of the Museums of New Mexico, and Stanley Stubbs, conference chairman. The opening meeting on Monday afternoon was devoted to archaeological reports on the summer's field work. Robert Lister, of the Uni- versity of Colorado, was chairman. A summary of the reports, given by states, follows: UTAH. James Gunnerson and Dee C. Taylor reported on survey and excavation in the Fremont culture area. [See NOTES AND NEWS, Great Basin, this issue for details.] Clement Meighan of UCLA excavated a puebloid site near Paragonah. This is the second year of excavations in a large village area which originally contained over 400 trash mounds. Adobe granaries and pit-house struc- tures were uncovered. The site is believed to date into the 1200's. COLORADO. Robert Lister, of the University of Colo- rado, directed the Department of Anthropology's third summer field school at Mesa Verde National Park. Fif- teen students excavated in a late Pueblo II to early Pueblo III ruin on the mesa. The rooms excavated will be stabilized to form part of the permanent exhibit at the park. Joe Ben Wheat, of the Colorado University Museum, excavated in a Basketmaker III site on the Yellowjacket River. Six structures, a small antechamber pit house, and 5 surface granaries were dug as well as part of a great kiva. Herbert Dick, of Trinidad Junior College, reported that that institution and the Harvard Botanical Museum are jointly sponsoring a permanent camp on the Purga- tory River in eastern Colorado. Work was undertaken in Trinchera Cave which produced a long stratigraphic sequence including both ceramic and nonceramic ma- terial. NEW MEXICO. The University of New Mexico ran 3 digs during the summer. Work at Pottery Mound pro- duced a beautifully painted kiva. At the preceramic Lucy site in the Estancia Valley, both Clovis and Sandia points were uncovered in situ, as well as later pre- ceramic types, in association with elephant, bison, horse, and mastodon bones. With the later "Pinto-like" points were hearths, handstones, and milling stones. A 5-week excavation in the Gallina area uncovered 3 pit houses and a tower of stone and adobe with tunnels leading from the pit houses to the tower. In addition, thick- walled rectangular rooms and slab-walled granaries were excavated. Fred Wendorf of the Laboratory of Anthropology reported on the highway salvage archaeology program which has resulted in 26 sites partially or completely excavated. The National Forest Service and the New Mexico Game and Fish Commission are cooperating in this program. Stewart Peckham described 2 Tularosa River sites of Pueblo II to Pueblo III period encountered in highway salvage work. They appeared to have both pit houses and pueblos occupied at the same time. Three Pueblo I-II sites, one with rectangular pit houses with Lino Gray and San Francisco Red and 2 with round pit houses, surface storage rooms, and Lino Gray, Red Mesa Black-on-White, and Kana'a Gray were exca- vated near Albuquerque. Three sites were excavated near Tesuque. One was a nonceramic saucer-shaped pit house, the second a small adobe-walled pueblo with a deep kiva, and the third pit houses below a Santa Fe Black-on-White period pueblo with a circular kiva. Charlie Steen of the National Park Service described work in a small stratified cave site on Pigeon Creek near a swampy area. Archaic horizon points, adobe-lined fire pits, a microblade, and fossil bison, were strati- graphically above Clovis points, crude choppers, and small fire pits. Stanley Stubbs, of the Laboratory of Anthropology, spoke on advising local archaeological groups and men- tioned that the Taos Society is excavating a Pueblo II pit-house village. He also told of work by the labora- tory done in 2 historical period sites in Santa Fe. At San Miguel Church a pre-1628 church foundation was found to underlie the present church which dates from 1710. At the south side of the Plaza, a military church foundation was uncovered. The original shape of this cruciform church, dating from the 1750's, was formerly unknown. Richard B. Woodbury and Nathalie F. S. Woodbury, of Columbia University, continued with the second season's work at El Morro National Monument. A cir- cular kiva in the Pueblo IV ruin, partly excavated last year, was completed and analysis of material from the site begun. This ruin is being stabilized by the National Park Service. Alan P. Olson reported on the work of the Chicago Natural History Museum under Paul Martin on the Blue River where a portion of an early Pinedale phase pueblo was excavated. This is the latest sign of Pueblo occupancy in this area. ARIZONA. Edward B. Danson reported on the tenth annual season of the University of Arizona and the Arizona State Museum's archaeological field school at Point of Pines. Excavations were continued under the direction of Emil W. Haury in the large Pueblo III-IV ruin, where 11 more rooms were excavated. A 5-room cave site was excavated by the James Giffords which produced dry materials of the 1300's. A nonceramic site was excavated by Haury which produced an as- semblage of artifacts, points, protopalettes, pipes, and cremations which suggests a pattern of culture that could have led into the Hohokam. David Breternitz, 1955 dig foreman, reported on the second year's excava- 338 [ XXI, 3, 1956</page><page sequence="6">NOTES AND NEWS tions in an A.D. 900-1000 period pit-house village near Point of Pines which produced square, shallow pit houses, as well as later crude small pueblos. Two great kivas were excavated at this site. Robert Euler, of the Museum of Northern Arizona, reported on historic Walapai sites and told of an ar- chaeological survey near Inscription House where over 100 sites, mostly of the Pueblo II period, were located. Geologists participating in the survey are working on the correlations of archaeology and recent geological events. In a survey conducted for the Museum by Douglas Schwartz of the University of Oklahoma, 100 sites were also located in the Grand Canyon area. These were both Anasazi and Fremont in culture as well as Walapai. Robert Fournier reported that John McGregor of the University of Illinois and the Museum of Northern Arizona cooperated in a second season's excavations in the Pollack site, a Pueblo III Sinagua pueblo south of Flagstaff. TEXAS. Jack Hughes spoke of the archaeological sur- vey conducted by the Panhandle-Plains Museum and Archaeological Society. Sites encountered included rockshelters, campsites with a Pueblo-Caddo cultural mixture, and early man sites. MEXIco. Edwin N. Ferdon, of the Museum of New Mexico, reported on an archaeological reconnaissance in the Tarahumara area of the Sierra Madre where the Indians are still occupying cave sites. He also reported on a temple at the La Quemada site which closely resembles the ground plan of the Great House at Casa Grande National Monument, Arizona. Jesse Nusbaum archaeological consultant, National Park Service, reported on his work during the past year. Six pipeline surveys have been underway during the year, covering large areas of the Southwest. The afternoon session of August 16 was devoted to a factual summary of upper Rio Grande archaeology. This was ably presented by Stanley Stubbs and covered present day archaeological knowledge from the early man finds up to the historical period. Fred Wendorf indicated problems still to be solved and periods and areas still needing work. Wednesday morning, August 17, the Society for American Archaeology seminar working on the topic "The American Southwest, A Problem in Cultural Isolation," reported on its deliberations. Jesse Jennings and Erik Reed co-chairmanned the seminar which also included Clement Meighan, J. C. Kelley, J. B. Wheat, James Griffin, and Stanley Stubbs. Emphasis was on the new evidence of close Mexican influence on the Southwest and actual movements into the area from Mexico during the 700's, 1100's, and 1400's, bringing in ceramic, architectural, and ceremonial features. The Museum of Northern Arizona has extended an invitation to the Conference for the 1956 meeting. The Interim Committee appointed for 1956 consists of Malcolm Farmer, Chairman, Thomas Cain, and Fred Peck. SOUTHWEST CERAMIC DEPOSITORY The Northern Arizona Society of Science and Art has designated its collection of sherds as a "Ceramic Depository for the Southwest." A special room in the Research Center at the Museum of Northern Arizona has been provided to house the approximately 9000 sherds. Each archaeologist who describes a Southwest pottery type or ware is invited to place specimens in the Depository as examples. Rules for the Depository are published in Plateau for October, 1955 (Vol. 28, No. 2). GREAT BASIN The second Great Basin Archaeological Conference met at the Southwest Museum, Los Angeles, on August 31 and September 1. Ruth Simpson of the Southwest Museum was chairman. Due to the length of the pro- gram it is not possible to report the meeting in detail. A total of 19 field reports was presented and 2 sym- posia were held - one on Pleistocene Archaeology and one on Artifacts versus Naturifacts. In addition, papers on related sciences were given, including geology, bi- ology, and climatology. Effective displays were arranged for exhibit of specimens from the sites reported. From 60 to 80 people were present at the formal sessions. The 1956 meeting will be in Salt Lake City, with Jesse D. Jennings of the University of Utah as chairman. UTAH. The University of Utah summer field school, under the direction of Jesse D. Jennings and his assis- tant, Dee C. Taylor, excavated 2 Fremont culture open village sites between Salina and Emery, Utah. At one site, Poplar Knob, 4 rectangular houses with a total of 5 rooms were excavated. All had coursed masonry walls and had been built on the surface of an isolated knoll. The artifact yield was small. The second site, called the Old Woman site, was more rewarding in that 3 types of structures were present. There were 3 round pit houses, each about 2 feet deep with plastered walls, forming an arc at the edge of the site. Centrally were 2 contiguous rectangular jacal houses which had been built on the ground surface. One had burned and was rebuilt with coursed adobe. Also in the central part of the site were 2 coursed adobe rectangular gran- aries (also surface structures). Of special interest were 11 complete pottery vessels and 4 clay figurines. The latter had been accidentally fired when a house burned. They closely resemble figurines reported by Morss from Range Creek Canyon. These excavations greatly increase our knowledge of the Fremont culture since only one other open village site has been excavated, and it was much farther from the area where this culture was first defined. The material is being prepared for publication by Taylor. The Utah Statewide Archaeological Survey under the direction of James H. Gunnerson completed a second year in the survey of eastern Utah, exclusive of the Anasazi area. Work in summer, 1955, was centered in the drainage of the Dirty Devil River with limited time spent in surrounding areas. Over 100 new sites were 339</page><page sequence="7">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY located, most of them assignable to the Fremont culture. Gunnerson also spent a month assisting with pipeline salvage archaeology in eastern Utah. Charles Dibble, collaborating with Arthur J. 0. An- derson of the Museum of New Mexico, has continued the translation of the Florentine Codex. Book XII of Sahagun is in press and translations of Books IV, V, and IX are in progress. Of special interests to archae- ologists is his clarification of the description of lost-wax casting of gold. PACIFIC COAST WASHINGTON. Douglas Osborne of the University of Washington reports that the archaeological survey of the coastal strip of Washington's Olympic Peninsula resulted in locating a number of important archaeologi- cal sites. Wave action is rapidly destroying a number of these sites, and it is hoped that excavations can be undertaken in this important area beginning in 1956. The work was carried out under a contract with the National Park Service. The Washington State Parks and Recreation Commis- sion supported historical archaeological research at Old Fort Simcoe, located on the Yakima Indian Reservation. The party was led by Edward Larabee, and was made up of students from the University of Washington and other institutions. Archival work and excavation were combined to attack the problem of the location of older and original buildings of the fort. These, when accu- rately located, will be partly restored or marked for visitors. The University of Washington, the Wasco County Museum Commission, and some members of the Ore- gon Archaeological Society have been cooperating in an attempt to salvage some of the archaeological remains which will be inundated by the rising pool of The Dalles reservoir. A great deal of destruction is currently going on through construction activities associated with building the dam and relocating the railroad. Robert Butler, University of Washington graduate student, has been directing the salvage work. One of the major problems in this area has been the constant irritation of the many, and often militant, pot hunters. OREGON. A full field season of work was carried out by Luther Cressman of the University of Oregon at the site at Five-Mile Rapids, about 5 miles east of The Dalles on the Oregon shore of the Columbia River. The season of 1953 had been spent on another part of this site and that of 1954 on this section. The 1955 season was devoted to securing a greater horizontal exposure in the deeper levels of the site. The work at this site had a 2-fold function: (1) salvage in the area of the reservoir of The Dalles dam, and (2) study of this area for its bearing on the problem of the relation of the cultures of the Intermontane area to these of the Ore- gon Coast, in the project for the study of the prehistory of the Oregon Coast. The 1955 work was supported by a grant from the National Science Foundation for the Oregon Coast prehistory project. The geological evidence indicates that at the early occupation of the site the river level was higher than now. Molluscan remains from the earlier levels are of a type now found in a cooler climate than presently characteristic of The Dalles area. The avifauna from early levels contains condors, Coragyps occidentalis, cormorants, gulls, bald eagles, and a few waterfowl. Other faunal remains include both marine and terres- trial forms from the several ecological areas which meet just west of the site. Salmon vertebrae occur in great numbers along with the other animal remains. Examples of cultural change throughout the levels are: bolas in the level of the bird bones but lacking in the upper levels; the method of stone implement manu- facture, from percussion to pressure; no discernible fireplaces to well-developed ones; ground stone tools to ground and sculptured ones; an unknown method of disposal of the dead through burial to cremation; casual throwing out the food debris to disposal outside of the site. The occupation of the site was continuous from the earliest period of use to the end but the incidence varied. What appeared to be a geological disconformity in the 1954 excavation proved not so on the basis of the more extensive evidence from 1955. The best esti- mate of the beginning date of use of the site, based on geological and paleontological evidence, is late Pleisto- cene, while the cremations postdate 1820 since trade goods of that date were with a burial under cremation debris forming the top of the fill. Radiocarbon dates will be secured to give a chronological series to which the various parts of the fill can be related. CALIFORNIA. During the summer, F. A. Riddell of the University of California Archaeological Survey, con- ducted an extensive excavation of a large habitation site in Lassen County, California (Las-7). The site afforded evidences of stratification, and this, taken with its unusual depth for the area and the large number of artifacts associated with both burials and cremations, is expected to make it an extremely important site in the interpretation of early Great Basin - Northeastern Cal- ifornia interrelationships. R. F. Heizer was engaged during August in a prelim- inary survey of sites in the Humboldt Valley, Nevada, in anticipation of a field research project in 1956 which would aid in tying together some of the loose ends of problems still remaining in the region. A. B. Elsasser continued the survey of the Central Sierra Nevada instituted in 1952 by the Archaeological Survey. Approximately 30 sites in California and Nevada were located in 1955. These sites fill a gap in Alpine and Mono counties in California and Douglas County in Nevada. The immediate goal of the survey plan in this region is to determine if possible the ex- tent of the Kings Beach culture, a probable late pre- historic or protohistoric Washo culture, and to discover whether or not the range of the Martis culture, the presumed earlier culture in the area, was similar to that of Kings Beach. 340 [ XXI, 3, 1956</page><page sequence="8">NOTES AND NEWS The excavation of a large habitation site in Berryessa Valley, Napa County, California, was completed by J. A. Bennyhoff, A. E. Treganza, and A. B. Elsasser, under contract with the National Park Service. A. E. Treganza excavated in several shellmounds around San Francisco Bay in an effort to establish the exact landfall of Sir Francis Drake in 1579. No addi- tional direct evidence was uncovered to indicate that San Francisco Bay was the spot, although several iso- lated finds in Marin County still serve to leave the ques- tion in abeyance. A field party of 4 from the University of Southern California-William J. Wallace, Edith S. Taylor, John Peter Redwine, and George Knitzman - conducted an archaeological survey in the Grapevine Mountains in Nye County, Nevada, continuing a survey of Death Valley National Monument under the sponsorship of the National Park Service. Forty-nine sites were located, at least half of which were rock shelters. The majority of remains were left by the recent Shoshonean peoples, although one site yielded evidence of an earlier occu- pation. A revisit to the Tule Springs site in southern Nevada by an expedition from the Southwest Museum resulted in the locating and excavation of an additional number of ash beds, including a pit where one or more camels had been cooked. These ash beds, like those previously found, contained the split and broken long bones of a variety of extinct animals, including mammoth and camel. Only one unmistakable stone artifact was found on this trip. This was a biface chipped implement, perhaps unfinished. In a side canyon some distance from the main camp site, a large part of the skeleton of a mammoth was found. Near the remains of the skull and on the same level, a small bed of charcoal, perhaps a contemporary fire of human origin, was found. The expedition mapped and photographed the most important localities. Members of the expedition believe that the site is pre-Mankato in age. LOWLAND SOUTH AMERICA ARGENTINA. In February and March of 1955, 0. F. A. Menghin investigated sites in the Province of Chubut. Two large rock shelters with paintings of the so-called "grecas" style were located about 100 km. west of the town of Trelew on the lower Chubut River, where a new dam is under construction. One of these also contained cultural refuse a meter in depth, containing a nonceramic lithic industry of the Tehuelchean type. More detailed excavation is planned here. A site in which the petroglyphs were drawn on fallen rocks was found at Las Plumas, about 190 km. west of Trelew. These are of a more recent style, which is also found in Santa Cruz, Neuquen, and Cordoba provinces. In the vicinity of Las Plumas is a typical Tehuelchean surface site corresponding to Bird's Phase IV. Enormous shell middens on the Valdez Peninsula, containing Mytilus shells and a large number of human skeletons, are also for the most part of Tehuelchean origin. One with fewer molluscs belongs to Bird's Phase V. BRAZIL. Archaeological reconnaissance in the Rio Maraca area of Brazilian Guiana by Peter Paul Hilbert has revealed another burial cave with anthropomorphic urns of the distinctive Maraca style. Hilbert revisited the sites reported by Ferreira Penna and Lima Guedes and in one of these found red and white paintings on the rock wall showing a series of heads similar to those modeled on the burial urns. No habitation sites could be found, and all the burial sites were disturbed or largely destroyed. The Museu Paraense "Emilio Goeldi" in Belem, Brazil, has been taken over by the federal government as the headquarters for the Instituto Nacional de Pes- quisas de Amazonia. The outlook is good for a return to the position the museum held in the late 19th century as the center of Amazonian research. Eduardo Galvao has been put in charge of the Division of Anthropology. Peter Paul Hilbert has left his position in the Territory of Amapa to join the Instituto staff. CARIBBEAN. Investigation of early historic sites con- tinues to be a field of active archaeological interest. Excavation at Sevilla la Nueva (circa 1510-1540), under the direction of C. S. Cotter for the Institute of Jamaica, (See AMERICAN ANTIQUITY, Vol. 20, No. 1, p. 94.) has outlined the first unit of the site, which appears to be a house with an enclosed, mortar-paved courtyard. The brick-lined well that yielded a series of Gothic sculp- tures is in the patio, while another brick-lined well or cellar (as yet uncompletely excavated) is within the house. The house structure comprises 2 or 3 ground floor rooms with every indication of a second story and perhaps more. This structure has been tentatively identified as the "Spanish Castle" with a "tower" noted by Sir Hans Sloan in the late 17th century. Work is planned to continue steadily. The present excavations are now being fenced to protect them. The archaeologi- cal problem has been confused by the robbing of brick and cut stone from the ruins and the subsequent dumping of 18th and 19th century English refuse from the Seville Great House plantation. However, the lower levels, floors, and ground level outside the walls yield typical Taino pottery and Spanish ceramics, coins, and other artifacts of the early 16th century. VENEZUELA. J. M. Cruxent, Director of the Museo de Ciencias Naturales in Caracas, and Irving Rouse, of Yale University, conducted a series of test excavations in eastern Venezuela during August and September. They are preparing a joint paper on the archaeological chronology of Venezuela, and their excavations were intended to fill gaps in this chronology. They obtained a 4-period stratigraphy in the vicinity of the city of Carupano and less complete sequences in the central Llanos, around Barcelona, and on the island of Cuba- gua. A number of charcoal samples were obtained for analysis by the Geochronometic Laboratory at Yale University. The cultural remains indicate several new relationships with the West Indies; for example, one of 2 nonceramic cultures encountered may be ancestral to the Ortoire culture of Trinidad, previously excavated by Rouse and John M. Goggin. 341</page><page sequence="9">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY HIGHLAND SOUTH AMERICA ARGENTINA. In February and March, 1955, Alberto Rex Gonzalez undertook investigations in the Laguna Blanca zone, Departamento de Belen, Catamarca Prov- ince, Argentina. A number of important sites had been located the preceeding year and some of these were excavated. Rectangular walled field enclosures were found to belong to several different cultural periods, among them La Cienaga phase of Barreales culture. Houses associated with La Cienaga phase are oval, semi- subterranean structures with walls of stone without mortar and a stone-lined entrance. They are scattered among the field enclosures. Dwellings and graves of La Cienaga and graves of Conderhuasi were also exca- vated in the Corral Blanco zone. Over the past several years, Pedro Krapovikas has surveyed several parts of the Argentine Puna. At Te- benquiche, on the shore of the Salar de Antofalla (Catamarca Province), he excavated in a large ruin composed of extensive agricultural terraces on the hill- side, rectangular field enclosures bounded by low mor- tarless stone walls on the level land, and among the latter, circular house remains. A small cemetery con- tained elliptical graves lined with flat stones and cov- ered by a counterfeit grave, also built of stones. Associ- ated with these were pottery pipes, cylindrical vessels of black or gray pottery, a few metal objects including 2 of gold, and a vessel with affinities to the Candelaria culture. Surface sherds included Barreales type incised and polychrome decoration. The excavation and reconstruction of the Pucara (fortress) of Tilcara, near the village of the same name in the Province of Jujuy, is the first restoration of an aboriginal site attempted in Argentina. It is being supervised by Eduardo Casanova on behalf of the Faculty of Philosophy, University of Buenos Aires, fol- lowing the idea of the late Salvador Debenedetti. The hills occupied by the site and some of the adjoining land have been expropriated by the Provincial govern- ment and granted to the Faculty of Philosophy. A general topographic survey of the site, areal photog- raphy, general clearing, and exploration to locate old paths, graves and dwelling units have been completed, and 20 of the dwellings have been reconstructed. Plans include the construction of life size figures engaged in everyday pursuits, to be placed in the houses, and the erection of a regional museum and a residence for the use of those who wish to undertake research in the region. CHILE. Jorge Iribarren, Assistant to the Director of the Museo Arqueologico de La Serena, reports the discovery of a site of the "Shell Fish-hook Culture" in Guanaqueros. This confirms Bird's supposition of the southward extension of this earliest preceramic maritime culture in northern Chile. PERU. Frederick Engel has been excavating the La Capilla site in San Bartolo, 53 km. south of Lima. A test cut in one of the main shellmounds at the site revealed a dense accumulation of refuse with approxi- mately 3 m. of Inca-Rimac refuse overlying more than 6 m. of Chavinoid-Ancon debris. Engel hopes to en- counter the preceramic level underlying the latter. Dur- ing the preliminary work some interesting Chavinoid architecture was cleared and a new "Red-on-red" ware, apparently of the Formative epoch, was discovered. Excellent examples of Chavinoid-Ancon ceramics, bone, and shell work were also found. Alan R. Sawyer, Assistant Curator of Decorative Arts of the Chicago Art Institute, arrived in Lima at the beginning of June. The Chicago Art Institute has recently acquired the important Wasserman San Blas and Gaffron collections of Peruvian prehistoric art, and Sawyer planned to spend some 3 months in Peru and Bolivia gathering relevant archaeological information. He also accompanied Alfred Kidder II during a portion of the University of Pennsylvania field project. Louis Stumer reports that at the Cerro la Campana site in the Chill6n Valley (north of Lima) he found a primitive variety of ceramics of the Maranga style in grave association with ware of the Playa Grande 3 type (similar to the type found in the top layers of strata cuts in Playa Grande and Marquez). The significance of this linkage is that it demonstrates the coexistence of Playa Grande (Interlocking) in the Chill6n Valley with Maranga (Proto-Lima) in the Rimac. A second round table discussion on Peruvian archae- ological nomenclature is being organized by the Soci- edad para la Antropologia Peruana in Lima. The dis- cussions will be based upon the tentative recommenda- tions adopted at the Lima Conference held in January 1953 under the auspices of the Sociedad. BOLIVIA. Alfred Kidder II arrived in Bolivia and studied the spread of Tiahuanaco in the La Paz-Puno region. Work is being carried out under University of Pennsylvania Museum auspices, with the cooperation of the Bolivian authorities. AWARDS TO A. V. KIDDER On November 2, 1955, The Order of the Quetzal, in the Grade of Commander, was awarded to A. V. Kid- der, in the Hall of the Americas of the Pan American Union, Washington, D.C. The award was made by the Guatemalan Secretary of State, Dr. Domingo Gorcolea Villacorta, in the presence of Guatemala's President Castillo Armas. This high honor was bestowed on Dr. Kidder by the Council of the Order of the Quetzal of Guatemala in recognition of his "scientific and altru- istic work in archaeology" and the contribution that this work has made to the understanding of Guatemala's historic and prehistoric background. During the summer of 1955 Dr. Kidder was the recipient, in absentia, of an honorary doctorate from the University of San Carlos of Guatemala, one of the oldest institutions of higher learning in the New World. 342 [ XXI, 3, 1956</page></plain_text>
