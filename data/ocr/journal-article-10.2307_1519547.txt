<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK LIST 373 Gonzalez, Professor of O.T. and Hebrew Language at the UPCM, died in a road accident in August 1986, leaving practically completed an annotated Castilian translation of the major medieval Hebrew commentators on Amos. This has now been published, with the addition of a clear and helpful introduction by Maria Teresa Ortega Monasterio. The biblical text (in the version of the Alba Bible) is presented verse by verse, followed by a "catena" of medieval comments, which are themselves carefully annotated. This form of presentation renders the volume easy to consult, and brings into interesting relief the different characteristics of the various commentaries. [N. R. M. DE LANGE] G. W. SAVRAN, Telling and Retelling. Quotation in Biblical Narrative. Indiana Studies in Biblical Literature. xii + 161 pp. Indiana University Press, Bloom- ington and Indianapolis, 1988. The particular form of quotations studied in this revised version of a Brandeis University dissertation is that where a speaker repeats his own or another's words to a third party. Notable examples of this device are found in Gen. xxiv and the Joseph story, but they are also frequent else- where. Such quotations may be labelled either "verifiable" if the words are repeated from an earlier passage or "unverifiable" if they are not. The interest of the study arises from the fact that frequently the words are not quoted exactly, so that narrative and contextual considerations come into play to help explain the differences. Limiting his analysis to the narratives of Genesis to 2 Kings, Savran first summarizes such formal features as the introductory formulae used, who is quoting whom to whom, and so on. The bulk of the work is then discussed under two main headings: "story analysis", which studies quotations from the point of view of the characters within the narrative, and "discourse analysis", which studies them from the point of view of the narrator's communication with his reader. An appendix deals separately with the particular and frequent use of this phenomenon in the book of Deuteronomy. [H. G. M. WILLIAMSON] W. H. SCHMIDT, Exodus, Sinai und Mose. Erwdgungen zu Exodus 1-19 und 24. Ertrage der Forschung 191. viii + 165 pp. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt, 1983. DM 37.50; for members DM 22. The research reviewed here relates not so much to the composition of the book of Exodus (though Schmidt clearly continues to find the existence of the sources J and E a necessary hypothesis) as to traditio-historical questions about the role of Moses and the foun- dations of Israelite religion. Schmidt provides a useful introduction to the modern discussion about Moses but, as he is aware, few solutions: the caution in historical reconstruction introduced by M. Noth's questions remains influential. Never- theless, like other recent scholars he is unconvinced by the theory that the exodus and Sinai traditions were originally separate and, in a final chapter which follows the treatment of the various sections of the Exodus narrative, he examines in some detail the possibility that the "Midian tradition" forms an additional bond between Israel in Egypt and at Sinai and a proof that Moses is an original element of both episodes.

Univer- sitiitsverlag, Freiburg, Switzerland; and Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, G6ttingen, 1987. Schroer's book is a publication of her dissertation (1986). After a brief intro- duction in which she looks at the history of the subject, the problem, and the pic- tures in Israel and the ban on representations, she considers in ch. 1 sculptures in the shape of trees, flowers and fruit. In her first section she discusses Asherah and asherahs in the O.T. The second section discusses the decorative element of the flora in the formation of Solomon's temple. Ch. 2 examines sculpture in the form of animals and mixed beings, including cherubim, sphinxes, stag demons, teraphim and ephod. Ch. 3 discusses O.T. reports of anthropomorphic depictions</page></plain_text>
