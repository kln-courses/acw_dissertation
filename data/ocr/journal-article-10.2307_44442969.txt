Black By the early 1890s, it was becoming apparent to neuroscientists that the 250$ nervous system did not consist of a continuous protoplasmic network as was previously believed, but rather was composed of an intricate assem- bly of anatomically distinct units. "Neuron theory," as this new conception was called, stimulated an outpouring of speculation and research that made this one of the most productive periods in the development of ideas about the structure and function of the nervous system. This essay concerns one early speculative venture- the amoeboid theories of neuronal mobility- which sought in the mid-1890s to apply neuron theory to the explanation of complex neurological and psychologi- cal phenomena. Fascinated by the new image of neurons as individual cells and inspired by the conceptual liberation of neuronal endings from their previous entanglement in a continuous network, the proponents of these theories were led almost irresistibly to compare neuronal dendrites and axons to the pseudopods of amoebae and leucocytes. They suggested that neuronal endings were capable of limited movements of extension and retraction, which would alter interneuronal conduction. Such alterations in interneuronal conduction would in turn correspond to different conscious states. The boldness and simplicity of this analogy attracted much attention and prompted a series of researches conducted between 1895 and 1900 to verify the amoeboid theories experimentally. But adequate empirical sup- port was not forthcoming, and after 1900 the concept of neuronal mobility faded into oblivion, another casualty in the struggle to correlate mind and brain. In order to examine the amoeboid theories and evaluate their historical significance, we will first look at the historical context in which they arose; then turn to the theories themselves and to the researches and controversies BULLETIN OF THE HISTORY OF MEDICINE Vol. 55 Pp. 34-58 0007-5140/81/0551-0034 $01.00 ® 1981 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">Pseudopods and Synapses 35 they engendered; and finally we will consider their relation to subsequent neurophysiological developments. As will be shown, an examination of these theories casts an interesting new light on the circumstances surround- ing the introduction of the concept of "synapse" by the physiologists Michael Foster and Charles S. Sherrington in 1897. The importance of the theories also lies in the fact that they reflected and reinforced the trend toward functional thinking in terms of neurons and synapses. The amoeboid theories were put forward by French and Belgian his- tologists between 1894 and 1900, and elicited responses from the leading histologists of the day. The ensuing debate was also pursued outside his- tological circles, though it did not engage the psychologists, who may have found the theories too simplistic.1 The general framework within which the amoebists attempted to provide histological explanations of psychological phenomena was association psychology, the theory of mental function that predominated in the second half of the nineteenth century.2 With the advent of neuron theory, there was a tendency among some histologists to assume that the neurological basis of the temporal and spatial association of ideas was quite literally the "association" of neurons through interneuronal con- duction.3 Alterations in interneuronal conduction, for which the amoebists proposed a mechanism, were thought to underlie alterations both in the state and in the content of consciousness. The particular problems in clinical psychology to which the amoebists addressed themselves were hysteria and hypnosis, the two subjects being eagerly studied by medical psychologists in the 1880s and 1890s.4 But the main feature of the amoeboid hypothesis as an explanation of psychological phenomena was that it was pre-eminently biological, rooted in the two main biological generalizations of the nineteenth century- cell theory (1839) and evolutionary theory (1859).5 The complexity of the nervous system and the need to develop suitable histological techniques, meant that it took fifty years for cell theory to be verified for nervous tissue. Several essential steps in the development of the neuron concept can be identified.6 Nerve cell bodies and nerve cell fibers in 1 See, for example, L.

BLACK the central nervous system were first described in the 1830s, but were assumed to be separate elements. Evidence that fibers and cell bodies were connected was provided in the 1840s, though this idea was not widely accepted until the 1860s. The two kinds of nerve branches -axons and dendrites- were first differentiated by the German histologist, Otto Deiters (1834-1863), in a monograph published posthumously in 1865.7 For many years it was believed that these branches formed a continuous network in the central grey matter, but in 1883 the Italian histologist, Camillo Golgi (1843-1926), using his silver impregnation technique, demonstrated that dendrites end freely and not in continuity with other nerve endings.8 He held that nerve conduction occurred only through axons and their collater- als, which formed a continuous network in the grey matter, and that the dendrites had a non-conductive, nutritional function. In 1887 the German neuroembryologist, Wilhelm His (1831-1904), and the Swiss neuropsy- chiatrist, August Forel (1848-1931), suggested that axon terminals also end freely;9 but the first to give direct histological evidence for this was the Spanish histologist, Santiago Ramón y Cajal (1852-1934).10 His work, pub- lished in 1888, was soon verified by others,11 and the nerve cell, with its free-ending terminations, was at last recognized as a discrete anatomical unit, first called the "neuron" in 1891 in an influential review by the German histologist, Heinrich Waldeyer (1837-1921). 12 It was not long before neurophysiologists began to exploit the phys- iological implications of neuron theory, particularly in elucidating the differences between conduction along nerve trunks and the more complex process of conduction through grey matter that underlay spinal reflexes. Previously the complex changes occurring in central grey matter had been attributed to the nerve cell bodies (called "ganglion cells"), which were Clarke and C. D.

Nerve fibers were thought to be passive conducting elements.13 Neuron theory meant that there was a new element in the central grey matter-the place of linkage between neurons (later called the "synapse")- which physiologists increasingly recognized as having functional importance.14 In- deed one enthusiast declared that the neuronal junctions, not nerve cell bodies, constituted the "nerve centers" of grey matter, where the complex processing of nerve impulses took place.15 However, the neuronal junction remained a hypothetical structure, a "vue de l'esprit," in the words of one critic.16 It was not possible with Golgi's silver impregnation method to see the differentiated terminals of adult neurons in any detail, though it could be perceived that axons end in small swellings.17 Since the detailed structure of the nerve cell junction lay beyond the limits of the light microscope, it became the subject of considerable speculation.18 Most neuronists envisaged an intervening space or gap at the junction between adjoining neurons and regarded the conduction of nerve impulses over the gap as a process comparable to electrical induction.19 It seemed plausible to view this gap as a resistance to conduction which had to be overcome and which necessitated the generation of new impulses in transmitting excitation from one neuron to another. From this it was a short step to the view that resistance to conduction would vary according to the size of the interneuronal gap, conduction being easier if the gap were smaller and more difficult if it were larger. Some theorists went on to suggest that the size of the gap might vary at different junctions in the nervous system, or might vary at a given junction at different times according to circumstances. What the amoeboid theories offered with their hypothesis of the extension and retraction of neuron terminations was a mechanism for increasing and decreasing the gap at the neuronal junction. Association psychology supplied the data that the amoebists sought to explain, and neuron theory furnished their basic premise; but their principal tenet- that neuronal endings were endowed with movement- came by 13 These pre-neuron views are discussed in Liddell, Discovery, pp. 77-97. 14 One of the first physiologists to attribute some of the special properties of grey matter to the inter- neuronal linkages was Edward Schaefer (see footnote 99), who suggested that the latency of reflexes and unidirectional conduction might be a function of the nerve cell junctions. See E. A Schaefer, "The nerve cell considered as the basis of neurology," Brain, 1893, 16: 164-67.

BLACK analogy from studies on the movements of unicellular organisms and of motile cells in higher organisms. In this respect, the amoeboid theories were an expression of the post-Darwinian zeal for comparative studies. Darwin's evolutionary theory provided a great impetus for a comparative approach to all areas of biology, including behavior.20 But initial studies of animal behavior were anecdotal and anthropomorphic,21 and, in reaction to this, researchers who began to study the behavior of unicellular organisms in the 1870s introduced an objective terminology to denote the directed movements of microorganisms in response to stimuli. This was intended to preclude any reference to an organism's 4 wishes," "fears," "dislikes," etc. Thus the term "phototaxis" was introduced in 1878 to describe the move- ment of cells in relation to a light source, and, from 1884, the term "chemiotaxis" was used to denote movements in response to chemical substances.22 It was the chemiotactic behavior of Rhizopods, the class of protozoa to which the amoeba belongs, which most interested the amoebists in the comparisons that they drew.23 Researches were also conducted in the 1880s on the movement be- havior of motile cells in higher organisms. In 1883, the Russian zoologist, Elie Metchnikoff (1845-1916), proposed the then radical idea that leuco- cytes perform a defensive function in the body through their ability to move toward and to phagocytose foreign bodies.24 He studied leucocyte migration and phagocytosis intensively over the next ten years and noted that some bacterial substances attract leucocytes, while others repel them. The hypoth- esis that this phenomenon was akin to the positive and negative chemiotaxis observed in unicellular organisms was advanced by MetchnikofFs student, Gabritschewsky, in 189025 and further elaborated by Metchnikoff himself in his classic monograph Lectures on Comparative Pathology (1892), in which he set out his evolutionary theory of inflammation.26 The extrapolation of the concept of chemiotaxis from the behavior of microorganisms to the behavior of leucocytes in higher organisms set a precedent to be followed by the amoebists in comparing neurons to amoebae. The extension of this concept to the explanation of nervous activity was 20 See discussion in E. R Hilgard, "Psychology after Darwin," in S. Tax, ed Evolution afier Darwin, 3 vols. (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, I960), 1: 269 -88. 21 For example, see G.J. Romanes, Animal Intelligence (New York: D. Appleton, 1882). 22 Accounts of this work are given inj.

In 1886, His had published new evidence for the "outgrowth theory" of axonal development, according to which each axon "originates as a process from a single cell."27 First advanced in 1857, this theory had been less popular than its rival, the "multicellular theory," which postulated that an axon was formed either within, or as an extracellular product of, a pre-existing chain of cells that extended from the axon's cell of origin to its destination.28 His was unable, in his preparations, to see the actual tip of a nerve fiber as it grew out from its cell of origin, and this remained a drawback to "outgrowth theory" until 1890 when Cajal was able to demonstrate the growing tip of a nerve fiber in chick embryo using the Golgi silver impregnation method.29 Cajal's visualization of this "growth cone" gave a great impetus to the outgrowth theory,30 but another problem was its difficulty in explaining how axons were able to reach their destina- tions, often over long distances, from their cells of origin. The multicellular theory, with its concept of a pre-existing chain of cells to guide axonal growth, made this developmental feat more comprehensible.31 Cajal's solu- tion was to propose that the directed growth of nerve fibers represented a chemiotactic phenomenon. Citing the work of Metchnikoff and others on chemiotaxis in motile cells, he hypothesized in 1892 that neuroblasts also possess chemiotactic sensibility: If one admits a chemiotactic sensibility in neuroblasts, one must suppose that these elements are endowed with amoeboid movement, and that they are ex- cited by the substances secreted by certain nerve, epithelial or mesodermal cells. The neuroblast elongations would be oriented in the direction of chemical currents and go to meet the secreting cells.32 Cajal employed the concept of chemiotaxis to explain more than just the outgrowth of nerve processes. It was already known that at certain em- bryonic stages neuroblasts actually move from one location in the nervous system to another. Cajal suggested that chemiotaxis lay at the root of these movements as well. This use of the concept of chemiotaxis to explain the growth and migration of embryonic nerve cells lent further credibility to the analogy between amoebae and adult neurons that underpinned the amoeboid theories. Another speculation which influenced the amoeboid theories was the 27 His, "Geschichte des Rückenmarkes," p. 514. See also W. His, "Ueber die embryonale Entwickelung der Nervenbahen,"/friaí.

BLACK hypothesis that the growth of nerve cell branches that begins in embryonic life continues into adulthood. The Italian psychiatrist, Eugenio Tanzi (1856-1934), proposed in 1893 that the passage of impulses between two neurons produced a "functional hypertrophy" of those neurons comparable to the hypertrophy of muscle cells with exercise.33 An increase in volume took place along the length of the neuronal branches in a manner analogous to their embryonic development, and the distance between the neurons at their junctions was correspondingly decreased. Tanzi reasoned further that resistance to interneuronal conduction was inversely related to the size of the junctional gap and therefore that each act of conduction over a junction, i.e., its exercise, facilitated future conduction over that junction by decreas- ing the interneuronal distance. This increase in the efficiency of conduction through exercise underlay the acquisition of skills. Whereas Tanzi postulated that some types of learning correlated with improved efficiency of conduction over existing connections, Cajal had al- ready suggested earlier in 1893 that learning might also involve the forma- tion of new connections.34 He postulated that the growth of axons and dendrites continued indefinitely into adult life, although the capacity for growth varied at different periods, being greatest in the young and least in the elderly. He proposed that the exercise of cerebral function increased blood flow, and hence nutrition, to the neuron groups that were brought into play. This in turn promoted the growth and proliferation of axon collat- erals and dendrites in the direction of conduction. By this means, connec- tions already existing between neurons would be reinforced as the number of junctions between them increased, and new connections between previ- ously unconnected neurons would develop. In Cajal's view, this multiplica- tion and diversification of interneuronal connections made possible a more refined adaptation to the environment and underlay man's ability to learn creatively.35 These growth theories of learning were favorably received in the 1890s,36 and the basic ideas they contained- that learning involves the for- mation of new synaptic connections and that transmission over synapses promotes changes which facilitate further transmission over those synapses- remain viable hypotheses today.37 According to these growth 33 E.

In August, 1894, the French clinician, Jacques-Raphael Lépine (1840- 1919), reported a case of hysteria in which he had been impressed by how quickly his patient could pass from complete deafness to perfect hearing.39 To explain this behavior, Lépine, a supporter of neuron theory, hypothesized that "some psychic influence" had caused a small retraction of the terminal ramifications of neurons in the auditory system. This inter- rupted the contact between neurons which was necessary for conduction and resulted in deafness. The sudden return of hearing could be explained by the re-extension of the terminations and the re-establishment of contact "under the influence of the will." Lépine went on to advance the more general hypothesis that sleep was due to the generalized retraction of sen- sory neuron terminations brought about by chemical alterations in the ner- vous system. He did not specifically refer to these movements of retraction and extension as amoeboid. Apparently unaware of Lépine's hypothesis, the eminent French his- tologist, Mathias Duval (1844-1907), proposed a similar theory six months later in which he explicitly compared neuronal branches to the pseudopods of amoebae. Duval, an ardent Darwinist, was a strong proponent of neuron theory and believed that the special conducting properties of grey matter could be attributed to the neuronal junctions rather than to cell bodies.40 According to Duval, actual contact between neurons was not necessary for interneuronal conduction; a certain degree of proximity would suffice. Building on Tanzi's hypothesis that interneuronal distances could be de- creased by growth stimulated through exercise, Duval postulated that the gap between neurons at their junctions could vary according to particular circumstances from moment to moment, and that this took place by means Lund, Development and Plasticity of the Brain (New York: Oxford University Press, 1978). Many modern theorists share with Cajal the assumption that neuroembryological mechanisms continue to operate postna- tally in adult life. See, for example, R Galambos and S. A. Hillyard, "Determinants of Neural and Behavioral Plasticity: An Overview," in F. O. Schmitt, ed., The Neurosciences: Second Study Program (New York: Rockefel- ler University Press, 1970), pp. 289-300. 38 But since neuronal growth was often compared to amoeboid movement, some commentators referred to these theories as amoeboid theories, though Cajal and Tanzi did not do so. See, for example, J. Soury, "L'Amiboisme des cellules nerveuses: Théories de Wiedersheim, Rabl-Rückhard, Tanzi and S. Ramón y Cajal," Rev. gén. sciences pures et appliquées, 1898, 9: 370-76. 39 J.

A popular lecturer, Duval published textbooks and researches on embryology and neurohistology. His pro-Darwinian stance is evident in his book he Darwinisme (1886). See E.

BLACK of movements of extension and retraction of the neuronal terminations made possible by a "veritable amoeboid property of their protoplasm."41 In support of his hypothesis, Duval cited two isolated examples from the neurological literature describing apparent movement phenomena in nerve cells.42 He tried to show how his theory could explain the neural basis of such complex processes as "memory, imagination, association of ideas, habit and education." For example, he suggested that stimulants such as tea and coffee excited neuronal terminations to move closer together, thereby facilitating conduction with the result that "imagination, memory and associ- ation of ideas become more active."43 Just as a strong stimulus caused an amoeba to retract its pseudopods, so "violent or abnormal excitations" caused the retraction of neuronal terminations which produced the anes- thesia and paralysis seen in hysterics. Duval's amoeboid theory, presented at the meeting of the Société de Biologie in Paris in February 1895, aroused a great deal of favorable in- terest.44 Lépine responded immediately by drawing attention to his own theory of neuronal mobility and extending it to the explanation of hyp- nosis.45 In reply, Duval acknowledged Lépine's priority and further elabo- rated his own analogy of neurons to amoebae.46 Following the same evolutionary trend of thought that had led from the behavior of microor- ganisms to the behavior of leucocytes and neuroblasts, Duval proposed that the extension and retraction of neuronal terminations, which resulted in the facilitation and inhibition of interneuronal conduction, represented positive and negative chemiotactic movements respectively. The important neurophysiological processes of inhibition and facilita- tion, which were the subject of much speculation and research in the late nineteenth century, were thus in Duval's view reducible to the "elementary processes such as those which one can observe directly in leucocytes."47 Duval likewise went on to develop his "histological theory of sleep," which he regarded as the most fruitful application of the amoeboid theory.48 Ac- 41 M.

The amoeboid theory of</page><page sequence="10">Pseudopods and Synapses 43 cording to Duval, sleep was a state in which the reception of peripheral stimulation by the cerebral cortex was reduced or abolished. The conduc- tion of sensory impulses was interrupted and sleep would supervene when the cerebral terminations of sensory neurons were in a state of retraction. This Duval compared to the retraction observed in "the pseudopods of a leucocyte anesthetized under the microscope by an absence of oxygen and excess of carbon dioxide."49 However, he did not make clear what specifi- cally caused the sensory neurons to retract their endings in the induction of sleep or to re-extend them in the process of waking up. Duval and Lépine both agreed that movement of neuronal endings resulted in alterations in the resistance to interneuronal conduction which altered the activity of neurons. These alterations in neuronal activity, taken together, corresponded to different conscious states, but Duval and Lépine differed in their views of how neuronal movements affected nerve conduc- tion. Lépine believed that actual contact at the junctions was necessary for conduction. According to his model, neurons could either be in a state of contact or in a state of non-contact at their junctions, depending on the degree of contraction of their terminations. During normal waking activity their terminations were extended and in contact. Conduction could there- fore proceed without obstruction. In sleep or abnormal states such as hyster- ical paralysis, the terminations were retracted, contact was interrupted, and conduction could not take place. For Duval, close proximity at the neuronal junction was sufficient for conduction. Conduction occurred over an interneuronal gap, and was facili- tated or inhibited as the gap was narrowed or widened by movements of the neuronal terminations. Conduction would be blocked if the gap became too wide. The junction could therefore be likened to a "switch," which could turn the interneuronal current on or off. However, the junction could also modify conduction without actually blocking it, by altering the size of the interneuronal gap. In Duval's model, the interneuronal distance could vary between a maximum and a minimum, and the junctional resistance varied accordingly. Duval regarded this theory of the chemiotactic movement of neuron terminations as a legitimate "identification of the neuron with an amoeba and its pseudopods."50 He did not propose that the movement of these "nervous pseudopods" produced actual displacement of the neuron, as did the extension and retraction of pseudopods in the locomotion of amoebae. Duval interpreted the term "amoeboid movement" broadly to mean any sleep was favorably reviewed in the following editorials: "Les neurones et les théories histologiques du sommeil,"/ anat. et physiol., 1896, 32: 478 -80; F.

Pouchet, professor of pharmacology in Paris during this period, used Duval's theory to explain the actions of hypnotic drugs and anesthetics. See G.

Later adherents of the amoeboid theory were not so comfortable with Duval's description of neuronal movements as amoeboid. They consequently referred to the theory as "retraction theory" or the theory of "morphological plasticity of neurons." Nevertheless, Duval adhered to his analogy, which captured the imagination of many researchers and brought considerable attention to the mobility concept. Duval's analogy was a bold stroke of evolutionary reductionism which attempted to explain the activity of structures high on the evolutionary scale in terms of those lower down. As he put it, his analogy "reduces even the highest cerebral aas to histological processes similar to those which we observe in amoebae and leucocytes."51 Whereas other reduaionistic hypotheses often attempted to reduce the living to the non-living, i.e., to the invisible molecular interaaions of physics and chemistry, Duval's reduaion stopped, more arrestingly, at something both visible and familiar- the living cell. This tended to deflate the lofty complexity of the cerebral funaions, a tendency which some critics viewed favorably and others condemned. Let us now look briefly at the reception accorded the amoeboid theories. Cajal records that the Lépine-Duval hypothesis of neuronal mobility was initially received very sympathetically.52 The most enthusiastic responses 51M, p. 76. 52 S. Ramón y Cajal, Histologie du système nerveux de l'homme et des vertébrés, Tr. by L Azoulay, 2 vols. (Paris: Maloine, 1909-11), 2: 883. Interest in the new hypothesis brought to light an amoeboid theory proposed in 1890 (and subsequently ignored) by H. Rabl-Rückhard (1893-1905) in the context of the old network theory. See H. Rabl-Rückhard, "Sind die Ganglienzellen amöboid? Eine hypothèse sur Mechanik psychischer Vöigange," Neurol.

Gesellsch., 1895: 38-42. Rabl-Rückhard suggested that the dendrites of the cortical pyramidal</page><page sequence="12">Pseudopods and Synapses 45 came from outside histological circles. In a review of neuron theory in 1896, 53 the Russian neuropsychiatrist, Vladimir Bekhterev (1857-1927), found the mobility hypothesis plausible and in harmony with his own specu- lations, but he awaited empirical support.54 The American neurologist, Fran- cis Xavier Dercum (1856-1931), in his presidential address to the American Neurological Association in 1896, 55 heralded the amoeboid hypothesis as the new basis for a "rational and biological psychology," and showed how it could elucidate many clinical features of hysteria and hypnosis. The Ameri- can neuropathologist, Ira Van Gieson (1866-1913), was no less eager in a review published in 1898. As if the analogy to amoebae was not graphic enough, he spoke of the neuron as a "tiny octopus" with the "power of movement over its shorter arms or tentacles."56 He applied the amoeboid hypothesis to the explanation of epilepsy, suggesting that a seizure resulted when some stimulus caused a sudden retraction of neuron groups in the association cortex and released the lower sensory and motor centers from inhibitory control. Within histological circles, however, the amoeboid theories fared less well.57 The first critique came in 1895 from no less an authority than Albert von Kölliker (1817-1905), the acknowledged patriarch of German histol- ogy.58 He found the idea of the "constant animation" of the nervous system by amoeboid movements incompatible with the orderliness and continuity of psychological processes.59 He also deplored the tendency to regard the neuronal terminations and their linkages, rather than the nerve cell bodies, as the key functional elements in the central nervous system. His main criticism, however, was that the amoeboid theories lacked empirical sup- cells formed a complex dynamic network which, during cerebral processes such as thinking, was continually breaking up and reuniting so as to produce a constant change in connections. The British histologist Alexan- der Hill, also in the context of network theory, raised the possibility that the "protoplasmic processes of nerve cells do not form a permanent network but have a certain mobility, forming variable connections along the lines traversed by nerve impulses," in a review, "Current nerve anatomy and physiology," Brain, 1891: 568. 53 V.M. Bekhterev, "Die Lehre von den Neuronen und die Entladungstheorie," Neurol. Zbl. , 1896, 15. 106-7. Bekhterev, who made substantial contributions to neurology and neuroanatomy, is best known for his later work on conditioned reflexes and social behavior (which he called "Psychoreflexology"). 54 Another Russian psychiatrist, Serge Soukhanoff, combined features of the amoeboid hypothesis with Cajal's growth theory of learning to explain the neurological basis of mania, retarded depression and the organic brain syndromes. See S. Soukhanoff, "La théorie des neurons en rapport avec l'explication de quelques états psychiques normaux et pathologiques," Arch, de Neurol., 1897, 3 337-47; 4. 15-28. The Italian psychiatrist, Ernest Lugaro, also utilized the amoeboid hypothesis and Tanzi's growth theory in his speculations on the neurological basis of various psychiatric syndromes. See E. Lugaro, "I Fatti i le induzioni nell'odierna istologia del sistema nervoso," sperim. freniatria medie, leg., 1893, 19: 419-72. 55 F. X. Dercum, "The functions of the neuron,"/ Nerv. Ment.

BLACK port. He pointed out that movements of nerve endings had never been observed in transparent living animals and that stimulation of axons in nerve-muscle preparations had never been seen to cause contraction of their terminations.60 In a critical review, also published in 1895, Cajal agreed with many of Kölliker's objections, but was sufficiently intrigued by the amoeboid hypoth- esis to attempt to test it experimentally.61 He reasoned that evidence for the extension and retraction of neuronal terminations might show up as differ- ences in their external appearance in Golgi preparations. He therefore kept a group of reptiles and amphibians continuously exposed to light for one month and compared the appearance of nerve endings in their retinas and optic lobes with those of another group which had been kept in darkness. He found no difference in the appearance of neurons in the animals whose optic systems had been at rest in the dark, as compared to those whose systems had been continuously stimulated. He counted this as evidence against the amoeboid theories. Having rejected the hypothesis of neuronal mobility, Cajal went on to suggest his own "histological mechanism of association, sleep and the wak- ing state" based on the alteration of resistance to conduction at the inter- neuronal gap.62 He proposed that it was the neuroglia cells, not the neurons, which were capable of contractile movements. He had been struck by the variation in the external form of neuroglia cells in the cerebral cortex. They could appear in a retracted form with short, thick processes; in an extended form with long, branching processes; or, in any form between these ex- tremes. While other researchers had interpreted these different forms to represent different types of glia cell, Cajal held that they represented differ- ent phases of activity.63 He disputed the commonly accepted view that the function of glia cells was to support and protect neuronal tissue, claiming instead that the glia acted as insulators which prevented the lateral escape of current from neuronal branches and confined current flow to the neuronal terminations. According to Cajal, when the glial processes were extended, they "stepped between the nerve endings" to block or reduce interneuronal conduction. Natural sleep or sleep induced by hypnosis or drugs resulted when there was a generalized interposition of glial processes at the inter- neuronal linkages. Interneuronal conduction returned when the glial pseudopods retracted. Unlike most of Cajal's fertile hypotheses, his concept of glial amoe- boidism, which elevated the lowly glia cell to the command of inter- 80 Lépine and Duval had not specified whether both axons and dendrites were contractile. Kölliker's criticism undermined the view that axon terminations moved; consequendy, research to verify the amoeboid hypothesis was directed toward providing evidence for the movement of dendrites. 81 Cajal, "Bau des Centrainervensystems," pp. 367-78. 82 Ibid., pp. 375-78. 83 For conventional views on the role of glia cells in the 1890s, see A van Gehuchten, Anatomie du système nerveux de l'homme, 3rd ed., 2 vols.

The speculations stimulated by the amoeboid hypothesis of neuronal mobility were not enough to ensure its survival. Concrete empirical support was needed, not further theoretical elaboration. This was difficult because preparation of nervous tissue for microscopic examination precluded ob- servation of cellular movements. Nevertheless, the ameobists conducted a number of researches between 1895 and 1900 to find evidence for neuronal mobility. In particular, they studied changes in the external appearance of pyramidal cell dendrites, and the ensuing debate hinged on whether or not these changes could be interpreted to represent movements of retraction. This debate deserves further examination. Since it was not possible to observe neuronal movements directly in the functioning brain, researchers had to seek verification of the amoeboid hypothesis in tissue sections. Their main assumption was that evidence of extension and retraction would appear as differences in the external mor- phology of the neuronal terminations. Differences in the internal morphol- ogy of neurons under different conditions of activity had been well documented during the previous decade.66 It seemed reasonable to expect that the external morphology would vary as well, and that such alterations would affect neuronal interrelationships. The general method of testing the amoeboid theories was therefore to subject animals to different kinds of stimuli and then to compare Golgi preparations of their neural tissue to unstimulated, control animals prepared in the same way. Cajal, in 1895, was the first to carry out such experiments.67 As previously mentioned, he found no differences between the stimulated and unstimulated animals, but another researcher reported in 1896 that fish exposed to light showed contraction of their retinal cells, whereas fish kept in the dark did not.68 Over the next few years, other investigators also claimed that the external morphology of neurons did in fact vary in response to different stimuli. The particular neurons they studied were the pyramidal cells of the cerebral cortex in experimental animals and in post-mortem clinical material. To understand their results, we must briefly discuss two 84 For example, see A. von Kölliker, "Ueber die neue Hypothese von Ramon von der Bedeutung der Neuroglia- Elemente des Gehirns," Sitzungsb.

BLACK technical aspeas of the appearance of pyramidal cell dendrites in Golgi preparations- the dendritic spines and "varicose atrophy." The dendritic branches of cortical pyramidal cells possess numerous small lateral projeaions with which the axonal endings of other neurons articulate. These were called "spines" by Cajal, who first depiaed them in 1891, and their significance remained controversial for many years.69 Köl- liker believed they were artifacts of the Golgi staining method.70 Other histologists, including Cajal, noted that the axons appeared to end in contaa with the spines and therefore suggested that the spines were organs of interneuronal linkage.71 The amoebists strongly supported this view, and the spines became key elements in their argument. The occurrence of small swellings or varicosities along the branches of pyramidal dendrites, first reported in 1893, was another phenomenon seen in Golgi preparations which was the subjea of much debate.72 When these varicosities occurred in any number, the dendrites took on the appearance of a pearl necklace or rosary, the so-called "moniliform" appearance. Al- though occasionally seen in normal tissue, the moniliform appearance was most commonly observed in toxic or diseased states, and hence was de- scribed as "varicose atrophy" by many pathologists, who regarded it as an irreversible degenerative change. The amoebists argued that the varicosities, which were usually accompanied by the disappearance of dendritic spines, represented the retraaion of pyramidal dendrites in response to irritation. The leading light in the research effort to verify the retractability of neuronal terminations was the cell physiologist, Jean Demoor (1867- 194i).73 In his earlier investigations Demoor had examined the effects of various stimuli (such as chloroform and carbon dioxide) on proto- plasmic movements in plant cells, protozoans and leucocytes.74 He was stimu- lated by the Lépine-Duval hypothesis to extend this type of investigation to 89 S. Ramón y Cajal, "Sur la structure de l'écorœ cérébrale de quelques mammifères," La Cellule, 1891, 7.- 125-176. Cajal, who first noticed these structures in 1888, called them "épines collateralles" {Ibid., p. 139). Other terms later used were "gemmules," "thorns" and "pyriform appendages." 70 Kölliker, Handbuch, 2: 647, 755. For other views see Barker, The Nervous System, pp. 74-7, and A. Hill, "Note on 'thorns', and a theory of the constitution of grey matter," Brain, 1897, 20. 130-37. 71 For example, Azoulay, "Psychologie histologique," p. 260, and H.J. Berkeley, "The intra-cerebral nerve- fibre terminal apparatus, and modes of transmission of nerve impulses," Johns Hopkins Hosp. Rep., 1896,5.- 89-93. Cajal initially thought that the axon terminals went in between the spines (Cajal, Les Nouvelles Idées, p. 50). 72 R. Colella, "Sur les altérations histologiques de l'écorce cérébrale dans quelques maladies mentales," Arch. ital. biol., 1893 ,20: 216-18. Colella reported the varicosities in cases of alcohol intoxication and general paralysis of the insane. There soon followed reports of varicosities in a variety of experimental and clinical material and also with the use of methylene blue staining. See, for example, W. L. Andriezen, "On some of the newer aspects of the pathology of insanity," Brain, 1894, 17: 548-692; J. Renaut, "Contribution à l'étude de la constitution de l'articulation et de la conjugaison des neurones," La Presse Médicale, 1895,3 - 297-300; and H.J. Berkeley, "Studies on the lésions produced by the action of certain poisons on the cortical nerve cell," Johns Hopkins Hosp. Rep., 1897, 6: 1-88. The significance of these varicosities is still not well understood. 78 Demoor, who was professor of physiology at Brussels University from 1901 to 1937, conducted re- searches on leucocyte behavior and heart physiology (1922-30) as well as on neurophysiology. He was also an influential writer on the education of retarded children. See P. Rijlant, "L'oeuvre scientifique de Jean Demoor," in Mélanges Jean Demoor (Paris: Masson, 1937), pp. 7-29. 74 J.

In another experiment, Demoor allowed a dog to recover from mor- phine for thirty-six hours and found that its cortical cells had the same appearance as the control animals. He inferred that the cortical cells had undergone varicose changes during morphinization but had subsequently returned to normal, and he therefore concluded that the moniliform state was not an irreversible degenerative change but a reversible retraction of the dendritic protoplasm in response to irritation. He pointed to studies of protoplasmic irritability in amoebae which had shown that an amoeba reacts to injurious stimuli by retracting its pseudopods to reduce its volume, adopt- ing a spherical shape, and remaining immobile. If the noxious stimulation was not prolonged, this protoplasmic change was reversible. According to Demoor, the protoplasmic irritability of neurons had an important func- tional consequence: the retraction of dendrites isolated the nerve cell by disrupting its linkages with other neurons and thereby interrupted inter- neuronal conduction. Later that year Demoor adduced suggestive evidence from other proto- zoan studies to support his interpretation of the moniliform state in cortical neurons. The evidence was drawn from the work of the German physiologist, Max Verworn (1864-1922), on a subgroup of the protozoan class oîRhizopods which had filamentous, semipermanent pseudopods that closely resembled the branches of neurons.76 In particular, Verworn noted that the varicose changes which chloroform produced in the fine pseudo- pods of such organisms appeared strikingly similar to those described by Demoor in pyramidal dendrites.77 This inspired Demoor to con- duct his own experiments, in which he exposed Rhizopods to electrical current, morphine, cocaine, and other stimuli, and observed that small var- icosities formed at the tips of the filamentous pseudopods and then moved toward the cell body.78 Prolonged stimulation produced a series of these varicosities along the filament, resulting in the typical moniliform appear- ance. To Demoor this confirmed once again that the moniliform state repre- sented the reversible response of a fine filament of protoplasm, whether it was part of a nerve cell or a protozoan cell, to irritation (Figure 2). 75 J.

Bottom right: The same rhizopod after exposure to chloroform. The pseudopods show beaded varicosities. (From Verworn, General Physiology, 1899.) Demoor disputed the claim that the varicosities were technical artifacts, arguing that the degree of varicose change varied in nervous tissues in a reproducible fashion. He did not refer to the retraction of neuronal endings as "amoeboid movements," which to him implied actual locomotion of the protoplasmic unit, but spoke instead of the "morphological plasticity of neurons."79 But while he repudiated Duval's terminology, he nevertheless refined Duval's reductionist analogy by providing more graphic similarities between neurons and protozoa than Duval had been able to do. Demoor went on to apply the theory of morphological plasticity to everyday life, suggesting that varicose changes represented a normal physiological response to irritants. Examples of such irritants were hypnotic drugs and what Demoor called the "dormitive substances" which accumu- lated in the nervous system during waking activity. These irritants caused varicosities to form in the outer dendritic ramifications of the cortical neurons and to move toward their cell bodies. Contact with other neurons was gradually suspended and sleep supervened. If exposure to irritants was 79 Ibid., pp. 26-27.</page><page sequence="18">Pseudopods and Synapses 51 constant, as in disease or chronic intoxication, loss of contact could become permanent. This underlay the moniliform appearance of cortical neurons found in such pathological states as dementia, alcoholism, and general paralysis of the insane.80 To complement Demoor's researches on varicose changes, his labora- tory co-worker, Micheline Stefanowska, undertook detailed studies on the dendritic spines of pyramidal cells in Golgi preparations.81 She maintained that the spines were organs of axo-dendritic linkage, whose gradual appearance in animals after birth correlated to psychic development. In her experiments, the pyramidal cells of animals whose cerebral cortex had been stimulated by various means showed a reduction or complete loss of dendritic spines along with some degree of varicose change. She hypothesized that the irritating stimulation caused the spines to retract into the dendrites, thereby "rupturing contact" and interfering with interneuronal conduction. Another of Demoor's co-workers, Louis Querton, found that varicose changes with partial or complete loss of spines occurred in the pyramidal dendrites of animals that were hibernating.82 He inferred that this represented the retrac- tion of dendrites which interrupted interneuronal contact and resulted in the cessation of psychic activity characteristic of hibernation. Most of the research submitted as empirical support for the retraction hypothesis emanated from one laboratory group in Brussels and hinged on the interpretation that varicosities and loss of spines represented the retrac- tion of neuronal dendrites in response to irritation.83 This was a debatable inference at best, and the whole basis of the amoebists' argument was undermined when researchers in other laboratories were unable to dupli- cate their results.84 The amoebists stoutly defended their methods, but the final blow came in 1899 when two American investigators, Weil and Frank, published a preliminary report of their three-year study on retraction theory. Using both human and animal brain preparations, they found that the de- gree of varicose change in pyramidal dendrites was independent of the 80 J.

They concluded that the var- icosities, which were so crucial to the amoebist position, were simply ar- tifacts of the Golgi method.85 By 1900, unequivocal empirical support for the amoeboid theories had failed to materialize. The eminent Belgian histologist, Arthur van Gehuchten (1861-1914), who had been generous to the amoeboid theories in the 1897 edition of his popular textbook on the nervous system, had to admit in the 1900 edition that the significance of the loss of spines and varicose changes remained an open question despite a considerable research effort.86 The amoeboid hypothesis remained unverified, he commented, but it exem- plified the fertility of neuron theory in generating new research. On the other hand, Duval published an enthusiastic defense of the amoeboid hypothesis in 1900, declaring that with the work of Demoor and others it was no longer a mere speculation; it had entered the realm of solid fact.87 But his cause was already lost, and a more objective review of the evidence published in the same year reflected the general consensus by concluding that the hypothesis of neuronal mobility, however plausible, had simply not been proved.88 In his influential monograph on neuron theory published in 1900, the American physician, Lewellys Franklin Barker (1867-1943), marvelled that a "theory so feebly supported by the facts had been so widely accepted and made the basis of clinical generalizations."89 The growing skepticism quelled all enthusiasm for the amoeboid theories, and there is little reference to them after 1900.90 Knowledge of these theories does cast an interesting light on the early formulation of the synapse concept, which was introduced when interest in the hypothesis of neuronal mobility was at its peak. With the amoeboid theories in mind, we will now look at the early development of the synapse concept. 85 R Weil and R Frank, "On the evidence of the Golgi methods for the theory of neuron retraction, "Arch.

Sherrington (1857-1952).92 Sherrington felt the need for a special name for the nerve cell junction because of its functional importance, and after con- sulting a Greek scholar, Foster suggested the term "synapsis," from the Greek verb "to clasp."93 This was shortened to "synapse" in succeeding publications. Sherrington's view on the structure and function of the synapse was not spelled out in Foster's Textbook .94 But a short paper published in 1897 reveals that Sherrington, at that time, was seriously entertaining the amoeboid hypothesis that variations in resistance to interneuronal conduc- tion were due to an "alteration at the gap" between adjacent neurons caused by the extension or retraction of their terminations. In this paper, he applied the hypothesis to the interpretation of some experiments concerning synapses between sensory neurons in the afferent spinal roots and motor neurons in the anterior horn of the spinal cord (that is, the neurons involved in spinal reflexes). Starting from the observation that reflexes are more easily elicited from the skin surface than from the cut ends of peripheral nerves or of afferent spinal roots, Sherrington suggested that this phenome- non was due to an "increase in resistance to conduction between afferent terminals and anterior horn cells caused by the severance of tonic excitation from the periphery. . . ."95 He posed the question: Is this increase in resistance in the neural conduction due to change in the mutilated afferent nerve cell- e.g. retraction of its cell-processes withdrawing them from their normal apposition against the motor cell- or is it due to change in the motor cell or its processes- e.g. retraction of its dendrites?96 To arbitrate between these two possibilities, Sherrington adduced some observations from his ongoing researches on spinal reflexes in cats and 91 M.

Gerson, Michael Foster and the Cambridge School of Physiology: The Scientific Enterprise in Late Victorian Society (Princeton, N.J.: Princeton University Press, 1978). 92 Sherrington was professor of physiology at Liverpool University (1895-1913) and then at Oxford (1913 - 1935), and shared the Nobel Prize for physiology with E. D. Adrian in 1932. For a discussion of his fundamental researches on spinal reflexes and motor integration, see Liddell, Discovery of Reflexes; R Granit, Charles Sherrington: An Appraisal (London: Thomas Nelson, 1966); and J. P. Swazey, Reflexes and Motor Integration: Sherrington's Concept of Integrative Action (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1969). 8d An account of this search for a suitable term is given in Swazey, Reflexes, p. 76. 94 In a paper published several months before the Textbook, Sherrington verified experimentally that one important function of synapses was to ensure that interneuronal conduction occurred in one direction only.

BLACK monkeys. He had noticed that when the sensory roots of the hind limb were cut, reflexes of that limb were more difficult to elicit from other parts of the body than when the roots were intact. Yet movements of that limb could be elicited by stimulation of the pyramidal tract fibers more easily after section of the roots than before. He inferred that this was due to the fact that cutting the roots interrupted the normal continuous flow of impulses along them "in such a way as to render the connection of the motor nerve cell closer with some afferent endings and less close with others."97 He concluded: If increase of resistance to conduction at a synapsis, that is, at a place of neural linkage, be due therefore to greater separation of nerve cell from nerve cell by retraction of cell branches, I would urge that it occurs in a very marked degree in the dendrite branches of the motor cell of the ventral hom of the spinal cord.98 Two unpublished letters from the same year further illustrate that Sher- rington conceived of the synapse not just as a place of linkage, but also as the act of linking neurons together through the movements of their termina- tions. Sherrington wrote these letters to Edward Schaefer (1850-1935) in the fall of 1897 to discuss the terminology to be used in the latter s proposed Textbook of Physiology. 99 In the first letter, he rejected Schaefer's suggestion of "junction" or "conjunction" for the interneuronal linkage, because these terms implied "that the things joined are passive agents in the act of union, i.e. that the combination is made of them, but not at all by them."100 Schaefer persisted, however, and after conceding most of Schaefer's terminological preferences (such as "nerve-cell" rather than "neuron") Sherrington replied in the second letter: As to "junction" I feel less easily reconcilable. If a Latin form, capere not jüngere should be the root. The mere fact that junction implies passive union is alone enough to ruin the term - Synapse- which implies a catching on, as e.g. by one wrestler of another- is really much closer to the mark.101 His defense of the term synapse prevailed, and it was adopted for use in the Textbook , which was published in 1900. Up to that time the term had been used mainly by Sherrington and his associates, but after its appearance in this authoritative reference book it caught on both in England and abroad. 97 Ibid., p. 518. 98 Ibid., p. 518. This report has been quoted in detail not only because it shows how Sherrington used the amoeboid hypothesis to interpret a particular experimental result, but because it also illustrates the basic approach evident in his work from 1897 on, which was to understand spinal reflexes in terms of synaptic events. 99 E.

The Latin and Greek roots he advocated both em- bodied this connotation. This contrasts with his later recollections concern- ing the introduction of the term synapse. In a letter (1937) to the American physiologist, John F. Fulton, he wrote: The concept at root of the need for a specific term was that, as was becoming clear, "conduction" which transmitted the "impulse" along the nerve fibre could not as such obtain at the junction, since a "membrane" there lay across the path, and "conduction" per se was not competent to negotiate a "cross-wise" membrane "synapsis" strictly means a "process of contact", i.e. a proceeding or act of contact, rather than a thing which enables contact, i.e. an instrument of contact. "Syndesm" would not have had that defect, i.e. it would have meant a "bond."102 In this account Sherrington appears to have forgotten his original concep- tion of the synapse. As his letters to Schaefer attest, it was the active connota- tion of the term synapse that Sherrington particularly wished to stress in 1897; he regarded this not as a defect, but as a virtue. He did not begin to refer to synapses as membranes in his publications until 1905.103 The fact is that Sherrington's conception of the structure of synapses changed between 1897 and 1905, reflecting his growing appreciation of advances in physical chemistry and their application to the explanation of nerve conduction.104 Instead of a process of making contact, possibly involv- ing the movement of neuronal endings, the synapse as conceived by Sher- rington in 1906 was a "surface of separation," which controlled the move- ment of charged molecules. It was a cross-wise membrane which could "restrain diffusion, bank up osmotic pressure, restrict the movement of ions, accumulate electric charges ... or intervene as a membrane between dilute solutions of electrolytes of different concentration - "105 Just when the transition to his new view of the synapse occurred is not certain, since he did not refer specifically to the structure of synapses between 1897 and 1905 in his published and extant unpublished writings.106 His writings of 1897, how- 102 This letter is quoted in Swazey, Reflexes, p. 76. 103 His first written reference to the synapse as a membrane occurs in C. S. Sherrington, "Ueber des Zusammenwirken des Rückenmarksreflexe und das Prinzip der gemeinsamen Strecke," Ergebn. Physiol., 1905 ,4: 815-6. 104 Of particular importance were the concepts of semi-permeable membranes and resting potentials developed during the 1890s by Ostwald, Querton, Nernst and others. Such concepts were employed by Sherrington's student and successor at Liverpool, J. S. Macdonald, who was working in Sherrington's labora- tory at this time on a physical model of nerve conduction. See J. S. Macdonald, "The structure and function of nerve fibres," Proc. Roy. Soc., 1905, 76B: 322-50. 105 Sherrington, Integrative Action, p. 16. Although Sherrington no longer thought of the synapse as an alterable gap, he nevertheless continued to regard it as a variable resistance. See Integrative Action, pp. 157, 312. His rejection of the amoeboid hypothesis was reinforced by his experimental findings on the latency of reflexes, which contradicted the hypothesis that neuronal extension was required for synaptic transmission. See Integrative Action, pp. 22-25. 106 The extant unpublished writings of Sherrington are held in special collections in university libraries at Liverpool, London (University College), Yale and the University of British Columbia, and also at the Wellcome</page><page sequence="23">56 SANDRA E. BLACK ever, make it clear that the origins of the synapse concept cannot be prop- erly understood without reference to the amoeboid theories of neuronal mobility.107 The amoeboid theories of neuronal mobility deserve to be better known for several reasons. First, they have intrinsic interest as one of the first attempts to explain psychological phenomena in terms of neuronal and synaptic events. Their basic hypothesis that different states of consciousness corresponded to alterations in interneuronal conduction caused by neu- ronal movements was alluring in its simplicity. It presented a dynamic view of the neuron and of interneuronal relations that emphasized neuronal and synaptic plasticity.108 But the amoebists' attempts to explain psychologi- cal phenomena, while suggestive, were sketchy and never fully worked out. For example, the amoebists did not discuss the role that short-term synaptic alterations produced by neuronal movements might play in the longer-term changes required for memory and learning. Such long-term modifications had been the focus of the growth theories of Tanzi and Cajal, who postulated that the growth of neuronal terminations was the neural correlate of learn- ing.109 The amoebists mainly addressed themselves to phenomena such as sleep and hysteria, which involved the interruption of normal mental func- tions, because these fitted more easily into their model of the interruption of interneuronal conduction through the retraction of neuronal terminations. Secondly, the amoeboid theories generated a number of researches on the external morphology of cortical neurons, directing particular attention to the presence of varicosities and to alterations in the dendritic spines. The ensuing controversy stimulated further neuropathological researches, and Institute of the History of Medicine in London, the Royal Society of London, and the Ubrary of Congress in Washington. 107 In some respects Sherrington's early view of synaptic structure is closer to the modern concept than his 1906 view. Electron microscope studies have revealed that there is a gap between neuronal endings at the synapse, the so-called "synaptic cleft." See J. C. Eccles, "The Development of Ideas on the Synapse," in C. M. Brooks and P. Cranefield, eds., The Historical Development of Physiological Thought (New York: Hafner, 1954), p. 39. 108 Plasticity, a vague but vital concept in the neurosciences, has in the last decade again become a major focus of speculation and research. A number of possible physiological mechanisms of synaptic modulation have been proposed. These include alteration in release and uptake of neurotransmitter, change in receptor number and sensitivity, synaptic activation of protein synthesis, and especially noteworthy in the context of the amoeboid theories, "plastic structural changes in the synaptic cleft that enhance or decrease diffusion of the neural transmitter." See R.J. von Baumgarten, "Plasticity in the Nervous System at the Unitary Level," in Schmitt, The Neurosciences (1970), p. 261. For a more detailed discussion of these possible mechanisms, see F. Weight, "Physiological Mechanisms of Synaptic Modulation," in F. O. Schmitt and F. G. Worden, eds., The Neurosciences: Third Study Program (Cambridge, Mass.: MIT Press, 1974), dd. 929-42. 109 Current views on the possible mechanisms whereby short-term synaptic modulations may be translated into longer-term effects, such as the formation of new synaptic connections, are discussed by F. E. Bloom, "Dynamics of Synaptic Modulation: Perspectives for the Future," in Schmitt and Worden, The Neurosciences, pp. 989-1002; and T. V. P. Bliss, "Synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus," Trends in the Neurosciences, 1919,2: 42 -45. Of particular interest in light of the attention focussed by the amoebists on dendritic spines is recent experimental work on the hippocampal cortex of mice showing that repetitive stimulation causes swelling of the dendritic spines with which the stimulated axon terminals make synaptic contact. It is suggested that this long-lasting increase in the area of dendritic spines is a mechanism for increasing synaptic efficacy. See E. Fifkova and A van Harreveld, "Long-lasting morphological changes in dendritic spines of dentate granular cells following stimulation of the entorhinal area,"/ Neurocytology, 1977, 6: 211-230.</page><page sequence="24">Pseudopods and Synapses 57 the amoebists' belief that the spines were an apparatus of axo-dendritic linkage is the accepted view today. Thirdly, an examination of the amoeboid theories gives a fascinating insight into the speculative trends that developed in the decade following the introduction of neuron theory. Foremost among these was the growing conviction that the neuronal junctions were key elements in the central nervous system and that they accounted for the differences between conduc- tion along nerve trunks and conduction through grey matter.110 The culmi- nation of this trend was Sherrington's comprehensive analysis of the func- tions of the synapse in The Integrative Action of the Nervous System (1906).111 Some theorists went on to suggest that the neuronal junction served as a variable resistance which determined the changing patterns of interneuronal conduction throughout the nervous system.112 The amoebists popularized and accelerated both of these trends. They proposed an intrigu- ing mechanism for varying resistance by suggesting that the neuronal junc- tion was an alterable gap whose size varied through the movement of neuronal endings. Although this mechanism could not be substantiated, the resulting debate provoked counter-proposals and helped to maintain the neuronal junctions at the center of neurophysiological speculation. Finally, knowledge of the amoeboid theories provides an interesting new insight into the origins of Sherrington's attempts to analyse nervous system activity in terms of neurons and synapses, which found their most fertile expression in his epoch-making monograph, The Integrative Action of the Nervous System. In particular, these theories help us to understand the historical basis for the choice of the term "synapse" to denote the neuronal junction- a term derived from the Greek verb "to clasp." At the time of his early formulation of the synapse concept, Sherrington thought of the synapse as the active process of one neuron making linkage with another to allow transmission of nerve impulses. It was in this context that he defended the term synapse and helped to ensure its survival. But by 1906 his views had changed, and his concept of the synapse as a fixed, transverse membrane came to dominate neurophysiological thinking for the next fifty years.
