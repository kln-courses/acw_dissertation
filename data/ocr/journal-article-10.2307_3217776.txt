It would have been interesting to have explored He Yan's own assumptions in a more systematic fashion. Also, more could have been said about the specifics of the Buddhist influences on Zhu Xi and his reading of the Analects. Gardner notes the obvious features, such as the introduction of the concepts of "principle" and "material force," but presents as traditionally "Mencian" the strong theories of innate goodness that Zhu Xi reads into the Analects. As scholars such as P. J. Ivanhoe have argued (see his Confucian Moral Self Cultivation [Peter Lang, 1993], 50-55), however, the "discovery" model of self-cultivation one finds in neo-Confucianism is a far cry from Mencian developmentalism, and is itself a result of reading Buddhist metaphysics into Mencius. Indeed, one could argue that the very choice of Mencius as the orthodox successor of Confucius reveals the influence of contemporary belief in an unspoiled "Bud- dha nature." Overall, though, this is a revealing book, well worth the read for anyone interested in the development of the Confucian tradition or the more general phenomenon of commentary and canon formation. EDWARD SLINGERLAND UNIVERSITY OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA Phantasmic Anatomy of the Statues of Mathura. By SANDRINE GILL. New Delhi: MUNSHIRAM MANOHARLAL, 2000. Pp. xxvii + 112, figs., illus. Rs 450. The question most often asked by a visitor to a gallery of Indian art is "Why do the images have many heads, arms, and eyes?" Upon noting that such images represent deities, the visitor, especially the Western visitor, is often so perplexed that his appreciation of the art is considerably diminished. Attributing multiple bodily parts as well as animal parts and forms to the divine bewilders the general Western viewer. This bewilderment could be sustained from about the sixteenth century onwards, that is, ever since the West first came into contact with Indian art, because of a dearth of objective analyses. The first scholarly book analyzing India's special vision of the divine was an historical ac- count of Europe's encounter and reaction to such icons. Partha Mitter's Much Maligned Monsters certainly broke fresh ground when it appeared in 1980. It was not, however, until the publication of the first art historical accounts within the last fifteen years that interpretation of the icons took center stage. In 1988 and then in 1997 two scholarly monographs appeared to investigate "why" and "what are the meanings behind the iconographic conventions." Sandrine Gill's book is the third. It focuses on deities portrayed with many bodily parts or with a fusion of anthropomorphic and zoomorphic parts. Unlike the preceding works, hers is dedicated ex- clusively to understanding the stylistic aspects of such renderings. As she sees it, Mathura, during the first three centuries of the Christian era, created icons of the gods which "are in fact literal translations of their supernatural powers." The anatomy given the gods can be characterized as "phantasmic," that is, unreal, imaginary, or fantastic. The addition of limbs and forms, and the combination of human and animal bodies, result in the phantasmic anatomy of her title. Gill wants to know how the artist solved the problem of fusing or juxtaposing forms not seen in nature. "The aim of this study is to present a typology of the human anatomic transformation but there are also numerous other types of combina- tions as the imaginary bestiary" (p. xxv). She isolates three types: the multiplication of limbs and bod- ies, the fusion of two bodies, and the replacement of a human head by an animal head. With no pretense at drawing conclusions from an exhaustive sculptural corpus, Gill devotes four chapters to these types in order to determine the ways multiplicity and other imaginary anatomical inventions were depicted mainly in the early art of Mathura. 1.

This opening chapter introduces the reader to certain characteristics of the book. The discussion is based on a preponderance of the author's line drawings of previously published material. She prefers sketches to photos because "images published are not always of good quality" (p. xxvii). This preference can lead to trouble. For example, Gill an- alyzes Mathura Museum No. 39.2858 (her fig. 11) on the basis of fig. 13 in K. Desai's Iconography of Visnu (New Delhi 1973) and notes that the upper right arm of Visnu is not visible from the front, a stylistic phenomenon she then compares to her previous fig. 10. However, the upper right is quite visible in a better lighted photo taken from a different angle.2 Further, the discussion does not unfold according to consistent logic; neither a chronological nor an iconographic sequence is observed. Thus Mahisasuramardini's six arms are described first, then her eight arms, and lastly her four arms, even though the latter are the earliest renderings. Moreover, the Durga whose four arms are analyzed on page 17, sketched in fig. 35, and compared to one of the earliest examples in fig. 34 is in actuality a two-armed Durga in the Kushan period; it was later reworked into a four-armed version.3 The author's conclusion in this chapter is that the additional arms of Visnu and Mahisasuramardini are "displayed geometrically," that their function, size, and position differ from the principal arms, that there are two ways of joining "supplementary" to principal arms, and that extra arms are needed to hold attributes which are symbolic in nature. This reviewer cannot agree on the last point (see Srinivasan, Many Heads, p. 12). Chapter two, "Multiple Heads and Bodies," describes representations of vertical superimpositions, radial (termed "radiation" in the English translation of the 1993 work) projections, and the combina- tion of the two for the "Nand column," Sasthi, Skanda, Visnu Caturvyuha, Vaikuntha and Visnu Visvarupa, Siva, and Brahma. Gill's limited bibliographic sources and the rather uncritical reading of some of those that are cited are evident in this chapter. For example, she fails to take note of the faulty reconstruction of the right side of the famous Visnu Caturvyiha icon in the Mathura Museum (nos. 392-95), and thus makes stylistic pronouncements based on imagery that is not original to the sculp- ture.4 This icon as well as several others in the chapter features a tree in the back of the sculpture which Gill believes corresponds to the vertical and/or radial composition seen in the front (see pp. 38, 39, 45, 52). This belief needs some justification in view of the fact that trees occur in the back of icons that are devoid of any sort of "phantasmic anatomy." Two pertinent images come to mind: the pre- Kushan Mathura Buddhas in the collection of Vasanta Choudhury of Calcutta and in the Cleveland Museum's collection.5 I, for one, am somewhat doubtful that the depiction of trees in the back is meant to correspond with the composition of the multiple heads and/or arms in front, and therefore I would wish to have some sort of supporting evidence. For example, can the trees be botanically iden- tified and can it be demonstrated that the artisans have modified the trees' growth patterns to conform to stylistic renderings of the multiplicity conventions in the front? Chapter three, "Fusion of Two Bodies," gathers examples of Ardhanarisvara and Harihara where two different bodies are fused into one unique body, and also examples of addorsed bodies (or heads) of Yaksas, Kuvera, Scythian males, Ganesa, and Buddha/Bodhisattva icons. In describing a panel with Ardhanarisvara and three other deities, Gill identifies one deity as "Vasudeva" (fig. 101, p. 63; Mathura Museum 34.2520). The same deity having much the same iconography and made in Mathura around the same time is elsewhere identified by Gill as "Visnu" (figs. 10, 12, 13). The main visual difference between her "Visnu" of figs. 10, 12, 13 and her "Vasudeva" of fig. 101 is that the god holds a flask in fig. 101, and he holds a conch in the left hand in the other figures. However, Gill 2. E.g., see D. M. Srinivasan, "Vaisnava Art and Iconography at Mathura," P1. 36.V.B in Srinivasan, ed. Mathura: The Cultural Heritage (New Delhi, 1989). 3. See H.

Nowhere does Gill intimate that the flask is held by the very same god who holds the conch in later representations. That god is Vasudeva-Krsna. His identification and iconographic depiction have been determined, and the results have been published.6 The author does not provide any conclusions for chapters two and three. Chapter four, "Replacement of a Human Head by an Animal Head," "aims to understand how the animal head was joined to the human body by the artist" (p. 75). Depictions noted include various Yaksas and Yaksis, Naigamesa, Matrkas, Varaha, and Ganesa. This chapter demonstrates that the art- ist, be he of the Kushan or Gupta age, employs a necklace at the juncture between the animal head and the human body. However, to set the stage for the later cult representations of Ganesa, Gill uti- lizes an example offered in 1978 by A. K. Narain which has long, and repeatedly, been discredited.7 The concluding chapter five gives a short overview on "Reactions to Sculptures with Phantasmic Anatomy." Herein is contained a rather passionate and not inappropriate plea for viewers to open themselves to the power of phantasmic anatomy and approach such sculptures on their own terms, unconditioned by Western aesthetic norms. The conclusion ends with this thought: "In one way or another, the forms of the works of art should always be considered as sufficiently expressive by them- selves before referring to textual sources" (p. 107). Whereas art conceived by Indian artists during different periods can enthrall by the sheer power of their forms, I am afraid that this is not often the case for the images discussed in this book. First, these images stand at the beginning of the conception of sectarian art and therefore exhibit the initial steps preceding subsequent mature expressions. Second, although these phantasmic forms are rudi- mentary, they symbolize complex religious ideas which evolved throughout the Brahmanic period. The resultant early phantasmic art of Mathura can indeed evoke wonder and awe when the highly de- veloped religious symbolism is extracted from out of the incipient forms. For such an extraction to succeed, a wide panoply of interdisciplinary sources is needed, including also the stylistic analysis at- tempted by Gill. If Gill continues in this direction, it is hoped that she will use a comprehensive vi- sual corpus of early Mathura art, and its bibliography.
