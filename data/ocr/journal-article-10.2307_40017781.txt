<plain_text><page sequence="1">IS THERE A THOU "WITHIN" NATURE? A DIALOGUE WITH H. RICHARD NIEBUHR Linda Holler ABSTRACT This essay argues that the status of nature in H. Richard Niebuhr's ethics is ambiguous. In his theory of value, as described in "The Center of Value," nature is part of the extended community of being that assures the objective disclosure of value rather than its subjective (homocentric) projection. Yet in the epistemological reflections of The Responsible Self and The Meaning of Revelation, Niebuhr considers nature an object to which we, as subjects, are not fundamentally related. I attempt to eliminate the ambiguity and preserve the "objective relativism" of Niebuhr's value theory by appealing to the insights of both feminists and one of Niebuhr's mentors, Martin Buber. The concern of this essay is the status and role of nature in the work of H. Richard Niebuhr. Four reasons motivate my desire to ask whether and to what extent he conceived of Thou-relations with the beings of the natural world, animate and inanimate. First, I think he would take the question seriously. Of all modern traditional theologians, perhaps none is more attentive to the issue of homocentricity than he. For example, in The Meaning of Revelation, he (1941:21) is extremely critical of Ritschl for positing a religious view that "rests on the fact that man distinguishes himself in worth from the phenomena around him." Explaining that Ritschl uses the value-relation of humanity's opposition to nature to define a relationship with God and thereby give human beings value, Niebuhr (1941:23) remarks that this "inversion of faith whereby man puts himself into the center, constructs an anthropocentric universe . . . has occurred over and over again . . . [and is enhanced when] man's dominion over nature is put prior to his dependence on the Creator." Niebuhr fought for the inclusion of all beings in the sphere of value by fighting against all artificial boundaries placed on the community of being. And, in opposition to the mainstream of Christian theology, Niebuhr refused to define the community of being as humanity. In Radical Mono- theism and Western Culture, he (1970a: 27) criticizes even Albert Sch- weitzer's "reverence for life" as constituting a henotheism "of the community of the living which excludes from the realm of value all that is 81</page><page sequence="2">82 The Journal of Religious Ethics not alive." His critique of polytheism and henotheism maintains that our own selfhood is artificial, even narcissistic, when boundaries are placed on the horizon of beings to which we stand related. Assuming, then, that Niebuhr would take the question of Thou-rela- tions with nature seriously, my second concern is to render his ethics fully and explicitly sensitive to what is going on around us with respect to the destruction of the natural world. In the decades since Niebuhr's death, our conquest of nature has begun to show itself suicidal: we are depleting or poisoning the life-sustaining environment of this planet and have wrought an extinction of plant and animal species unparalleled since the ice age. Each day it becomes painfully more obvious that we do not live solely in relation to that limb of nature we call human being, but rather in relation to the whole body of nature in its diverse and finally mysterious interwork- ings. In this body we are truly one among a seemingly infinite many, and so we must take care to adopt an ethic that does not blind us to the value- laden being of the particulars that come into relationship to compose it. My question, Is there a Thou "within" nature? is, however, not limited to the morality of our actions toward nature. Nor is it a question about the essence of nature - its inherent selfhood or "subjectivity" intrinsically understood. The issue is not whether stones, trees, lemurs, dolphins, and stars are persons. The issue is whether we can perceive their moral integrity as existents within the community of being by ceasing to objec- tify them and, instead, encounter them as Thous. The Thou is, in other words, not some thing "within" nature, nor it is a thing "within" us. Subjective life is a manifestation of being, that, like value, emerges only in relations between beings. As philosopher of science Mary Midgley says in Animals and Why They Matter, subjectivity "is not an extra, abstract, general phenomena"; it is not something that could "be separately de- tected and added as a kind of stuffing for some of the players" (Midgley, 1983:134). The only way to "detect" the subjective life - the selfhood, worth and being - of anything other than oneself, and thus one's own, is to be able to recognize the life you share with it and thereby meet the other in an encounter of mutual relatedness. Niebuhr (1941:131) finds "projections into the world of purposes and animae" characteristics of "primitive metaphysics and naive science," but would be object to attributing to the natural world the life we share with it? The issue is encounter, not projection: my argument is that our refusal to recognize our relatedness to others makes projections upon them inevitable by making identification with them impossible. The refusal to risk identification with, or stand in relationship to, others who are not, seemingly, like oneself is, after all, an enclosure of selfhood that is not limited to speciesism. It is a quality in classism, nationalism, racism and sexism; it may be the foundational criterion on which</page><page sequence="3">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 83 henotheism is based. My third concern is therefore with our ability to perceive the presence of being - the subjective worth rather than objec- tified utility - of anything other than ourselves and thus our own. Can we who live in a culture informed by a persistent instrumentalism that con- strues all things as tools or means to ends break out of that reduction and perceive beings as ends-in-themselves? Can we who live in a culture informed by a behaviorism that construes selves as "epiphenomena," a culture that Niebuhr (1970c: 140) described as one in which "what alone is acknowledged, accepted as actual, is the object," enter into relationship so as to recognize the subject inherent in the object? The issue is critical, because until we do so we cannot see ourselves; we will continue to question the value of commitment and remain blind to the morality of personal worth. My working presupposition is that insofar as we are severed from the community of diverse beings, we are unaware of our own being, and, like Narcissus, we will see that community only in our own image: the image of objects divorced from the beings in relation to which they have selfhood and value. Thus while asking Niebuhr to acknowledge nature as Thou, by acknowledging that subjective life is absent to us in every being from which we stand separated and present to us in encounter with every being to which we stand related, I am, more importantly, searching for a means of "detecting" our own subjectivity. Our own lives are artificial when we are enclosed within ourselves. I do not wish to devalue the importance of human inter subjective relations, nor am I looking for what Dorothee Soelle (1984:10) calls a means of "cheap reconciliation," a creation faith that glories in the wonders of nature, blind to "present, unjust orders . . . as if the God of nature had triumphed over the God of history." Human intersubjectivity is the ground upon which all of our knowledge and commitments are based. Encounters with other humans act to eliminate the problem of solipsism, define the horizon of all possible encounters, and continually test our ability to see ourselves in relationship. But as long as culture is so drastically divorced from nature, human intersubjectivity cannot in itself act to eliminate homocentrism. What is needed is an all- inclusive connectedness with others, the unification of nature and history; in Niebuhr's language, a truly radical center of value. My fourth and final motivation in seeking to make Niebuhr's argument come to terms with the status and role of nature is to eliminate a subtle but pervasive dualism that I have always found problematic in his thought. The fracture between practical reason and pure or speculative reason informs Niebuhr's work, even against his own wishes, as it informed the philoso- phy of his time. That Niebuhr himself was concerned about the dichotomy is seen as early as The Meaning of Revelation and as late as The Responsi- ble Self:</page><page sequence="4">84 The Journal of Religious Ethics The two-aspect theory of history [internal or practical and external or speculative] like the two-aspect theory of body and mind, may be made necessary by the recognition that all knowing is conditioned by the point of view, that the exaltation of differences in understanding into differences of being raises more problems than it solves, that the intimate relations of subjective and objective truth require the rejection of every extreme du- alism. But it is evident that the theory does not solve the problem of unity in duality and duality in unity. It only states the paradox in a new form and every paradox is the statement of a dilemma rather than an escape from it. (Niebuhr, 1941:59-60) Useful and unavoidable as this distinction [between practical and spec- ulative or observing reason] is, it tends to lead us somewhat astray by dissolving the unity of the self, somewhat as the similar, useful, but also misleading distinction between body and mind does. Equally serious has been the consequence that the separation has often led us to ignore the practical or ethical elements in our knowing as well as the observing, interpreting elements in our doing. (Niebuhr, 1963:82-83) When one reads Niebuhr with an eye to his views on the status of nature it becomes evident that the distinction between reason as practical and reason as speculative does exalt "differences of understanding into differences of being," does dissolve "the unity of the self," and does ignore the "practical or ethical elements in our knowing." The distinction indeed parallels a host of other distinctions that taken as a whole threatens to tear Niebuhr's theory of value apart and leaves his ethics open to the charge that he most wished to avoid - homocentricity. The distinctions that parallel practical/speculative reason are Thou/It or subject/object, revelation/inquisition, and culture/nature. To confront Niebuhr on this level is to recognize a linkage of practical reason, Thou or subjects, revelation, and culture, all of which stand in opposition to a linkage of speculative reason, It or objects, inquisition, and nature. These di- chotomous presuppositions are admittedly those that have characterized Western civilization at least since the seventeenth century. However, they are presuppositions that have proven epistemologically bankrupt, even within science, and morally henotheistic. This essay will appeal to both feminist insights and the work of one of Niebuhr's mentors, Martin Buber, in the hope of healing the fracture. There is much to be gained here, because the dualism confronted is in the largest sense framed by a divorce that arose in the West with the death of metaphysics - the divorce between epistemology and existentiality. That divorce leaves knowledge bound to the vacuous abstractions that, for Buber (Brown, 1962:104), constitute "an autopsy upon the corpse of 'real living,' " while we live anxious, skeptical, half-hearted lives, unsure about</page><page sequence="5">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 85 the nature, validity, and value of experience, commitment, and encounter. Niebuhr (1970c: 139-140) saw that our capacity for objectification was destructive, and he lamented its attendant existential anxiety. Blinded to the fact that by consigning the discussion of selves to practical reason, however, Niebuhr did not see that speculative reason is released from the moral weight of existentiality and, left to its own seductive abstracting devices, is a major source of our rendering selves and their worth "epiphenomena." If we can disclose the practical agenda behind the subject/object dichotomy, emphasize the necessity of subject-to-sub- ject encounters as the only possible means of inhibiting projection in value and knowledge, then knowledge becomes concrete, the self unified, and existentiality trusted. I begin with Niebuhr's "objective relativism" as set out in "The Center of Value" and Radical Monotheism and Western Culture. I believe his objective relativism overcomes, and constitutes an important corrective to, subject/object dualism. Apart from one important exception, Niebuhr there preserves the value-laden encounter of being to being by staying within the existentiality of selves who have their own being only as being- in-relation-to. Second, I wish to confront the subject/object, culture/ nature, revelation/inquisition dichotomies as seen in The Meaning of Reve- lation and The Responsible Self. I will argue that his epistemological reflections dismiss the value-laden encounter among beings and thereby fall into what he calls a "subjective relativism" characteristic of all forms of polytheism and henotheism. Insofar as knowledge is defined under the auspices of subject/object dualism, it is limited to a self or selves-in- isolation and thereby remains projective rather than disclosive. Finally, I would like to recast his objective relativism to include both value and knowledge by making concrete its subjective ground. SUBJECTIVITY AND OBJECTIVITY IN RELATIONAL VALUE THEORY The opening remarks of Niebuhr's "The Center of Value" are devoted to protecting value from "objective" abstraction. Value is not an isolated reality that exists, in-itself, outside of the encounter among beings. Niebuhr (1970b: 100) quickly eliminates the "objective" detachment of value by showing that whatever their speculative claims about the good, most value theorists end up defining the good "by reference to a being for which other beings are good" when dealing with concrete ethical prob- lems. Previous value theories are thus for Niebuhr implicitly relational - they are embodied rather than disembodied. He (1970b: 102) states that his theory of value is "objective in the sense that value relations are under-</page><page sequence="6">86 The Journal of Religious Ethics stood to be independent of the feelings of an observer but not in the sense that value is itself an objective kind of reality." Value has, in other words, no "objective" existence as some thing, quality or essence in and of itself; it has no "objective" status dualistically understood. Value does, however, have objective presence - it is disclosed rather than projected because it emerges in the encounter of being to being. The presence or disclosure of value is its objective status understood non-dualistically, and that status is protected by Niebuhr's further, and more complicated, elimination of "subjective" abstraction. Value emerges in relations among beings, but because it emerges in encounters that transcend limited forms of human desire and awareness it is not "subjective" in a dualistic sense. Dualistically understood, "subjec- tivity" refers to an enclosure of the self that, by reducing reality to the reality of the self, projects value as its dogmatic and self-centered atten- tions dictate. Niebuhr protects his value theory from subjective relativism first by placing value in encounters that are unlimited in the community of being. He (1970b: 103) makes a sharp distinction between desires and needs, agreeing "with the subjective value theory insofar as [it] regards value as relative to being, disagreeing, however, with the relativism which makes the good relative to desire rather than to need, or which makes it relative to man as absolute center of value." Donald Berry (1985:1) finds the distinguishing feature of Buber's phi- losophy to be the "insistence that what he calls 'the innateness of the longing for relation' is not expressed in the sphere of the interhuman alone," and in the notion of need Niebuhr comes very close to such an ontology. By locating moral value in the realm of need rather than desire, Niebuhr takes the discussion of the subjective nature of value away from the dualistic rendering of "subjectivity" as either private or purely human property and places it in concrete and inclusive relatedness: "wherever being confronts being, wherever there is becoming in the midst of plural, interdependent, and interacting existences" (Niebuhr, 1970b: 127). Value is not "subjective" in the sense of being determined by the whims of individ- ual or collective human desire. All beings (he [1970b: 106] explicitly in- cludes animals) have needs and are in a process of becoming what they are in essence. That essence can be distinguished from, but never divorced from or realized apart from, relations that extend to all other existent beings. Having preserved the disclosure of value by placing its emergence beyond purely human considerations, Niebuhr secondly addresses sub- jective relativism as it exists in modes of faith or forms of human world- awareness. Niebuhr argues that value systems contain, whether explicitly or implicitly, centers of value by which other values are judged. The center</page><page sequence="7">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 87 of value functions to define the boundaries of relatedness; it acts as an aperture of awareness or closure to the sphere of value or the beings for whom needs are to be met. In essence, the center of value defines the limits of subject-to-subject encounters or the boundaries outside of which others are considered objects rather than subjects. The choice of a center of value, moreover, is "religious in character" since it has at its "starting point some being or beings in relation to which good is judged to be good and evil evil" (Niebuhr, 1970b: 110). Faith acts to promote either subjective or objective relativism by defin- ing the boundaries of our loyalties to the community of being. Niebuhr associates desire (subjective relativism) with polytheism and henotheism - two enclosures of the self that make projections inevitable - and need (objective relativism) with radical monotheism - the inclusive, open encounter of being to being that makes disclosure possible. For Niebuhr there is no good-for-the-self apart from the good-for-others, and, as he (1970b: 105) says in a footnote answering George Schroder's charge that his relational theory of value posits a self in relation to itself: "I know of no self-relatedness apart from other-relatedness." Both goodness and self-relatedness demand a world-awareness that fully transcends the sub- ject/object dichotomy. As defined by Niebuhr, polytheism manifests sub- jective relativism because it is based on a self-in-isolation. I am a subject and all others are objects. This enclosure includes only individual desire or the good-for-me-as-measurer. l Henotheism is likewise defined as man- ifesting subjective relativism because it is based on selves-in-isolation. We are subjects and all others are objects. This enclosure is larger, yet it includes only collective desire or the good-for-us-as-measurers. Our awareness of the good or what meets the needs of a being is, like self-awareness, objectively present, disclosed rather than projected, only insofar as we are all subjects - value-laden existents in relation and in the process of becoming. Relational value theory is objectively relative rather than subjectively relative when no limits are placed on our loyalty to the community of being. For Niebuhr, the only center of value that maintains inclusive relatedness is the transcendent One-Beyond-the-Many of radical monotheism. "Radical monotheism dethrones all absolutes short of the principle of being itself. At the same time it reverences every relative existent. Its two great mottos are: 'I am the Lord thy God; thou shalt have no other gods before me' and 'Whatever is, is good' " (Niebuhr, 1970a:37). This center of value Niebuhr imagines not only to be inclusive of the totality of beings but also personal in nature - personal, because it is difficult, if not impossible, to have faith in or love an abstraction. One can love only a particular, and thus the center of value must function like a self in the sense that we come to trust or not trust in it. But despite his</page><page sequence="8">88 The Journal of Religious Ethics emphasis on then personhood of God, one should not caricature Niebuhr's picture of the God of Abraham and Jesus, as passages like the following demonstrate: We may call it the nature of things, we may call it fate, we may call it reality. . . . We may not be able to give a name to it, calling it only the "void" out of which everything comes and to which everything returns, though that also is a name. . . . What it is we do not know save that it is and that it is the supreme reality with which we must reckon. . . . It is to have a love for that which is not exclusive but inclusive since this reality, this great X, is the source of all things and the end of all. (Niebuhr, 1970d: 122-23) The love for that which is inclusive assures that all beings are included in the realm of value, and those beings include the natural world: "Spar- rows and sheep and lilies belong within the network of moral relations when God reveals himself; now every killing is a sacrifice. The line cannot even be drawn at the boundaries of life; the culture of the earth as a garden of the Lord and reverence for the stars as creatures of his intelligence belong to the demands of the universal will" (Niebuhr, 1941: 122). To Niebuhr (1970a:53), radical monotheism constitutes a great leveling, a Puritan iconoclasm the counterpart of which is the sanctification of all things: "every being is holy."2 As he says in "Faith in Gods and God," an essay written in 1943 that contains his darkest musings on the human condition and the reality of which radical monotheism speaks: Faith is never so complete that it is not accompanied by self-defensiveness. But this is its requirement: that all beings, not only our friends but also our enemies, not only men but also animals and the inanimate, be met with reverence, for all are friends in the friendship of the one to whom we are reconciled in faith. (Niebuhr, 1970d:126) With regard to Niebuhr's value theory, therefore, the answer to the question, Is there a Thou "within" nature? is yes. The answer is yes in the sense that nature, by virtue of its existence, "participates in being and is related to the universal and the unitary" (Niebuhr, 1970a:87), because, like us, it is - and so is good. The worth of nature is assured, and the natural world is given an important role in preserving the disclosure of value by acting as part of the embodied relatedness that calls the narcissistic agenda of homo mensura into question. However, there is one important abstraction that has not been elimi- nated. The God of radical monotheism breaches the relationality of both being and value in that God lies beyond both being and value (Niebuhr, 1970a:33), and "one cannot say that God has need of any being external to himself" (Niebuhr, 1970b: 112). As such, the subjective life of God like the subjective life of any self-in-isolation is very much in question, and George</page><page sequence="9">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 89 Schrader's charge, invalid with reference to the many, appears to be valid with reference to the One. Here the feminist critique of traditional doc- trines of God may be useful. "Separateness, as a quality of divinity, becomes extolled as a virtue in and of itself. . . . [Relationality is seen to be] a weakness of being bound through pain and suffering to other beings" (Soelle, 1984:14). It is possible that God's isolation, like the knower's isolation in Niebuhr's epistemological reflections, is a projection of the human desire to maintain power over things rather than the presence of an inclusive love for that which is in need. SUBJECTS AND OBJECTS IN DUALISTIC REASON The history by which we came to embrace two distinct ways of know- ing, one participatory or practical and the other detached or speculative, is long and complex. For our purposes it is only important to realize that these two epistemological postures were extended to include fixed on- tological correlates - persons and nature. To wit, we know persons in the participatory subject-to-subject encounter of practical reason (Kant's command to "act always so as to treat humanity as an end-in-itself and not as a means" was here relevant), and we know nature through the detached, subject/object methodology of the natural sciences (Descartes' distinction between the "mental" and "non-mental" was here pervasive).3 In The Meaning of Revelation, Niebuhr adopts this dualism by dis- tinguishing between internal and external history. As he describes the two perspectives, neither is correlated with truth or falsity: the external per- spective deals with objects - it looks at; the internal perspective is con- cerned with subjects - it looks with. External history is a form of abstract reasoning associated with the "head"; it needs no living selves and by a disembodied detachment deals in "data relating to dead things" (Niebuhr, 1941:46). External history is impersonal; it views societies as "made up of atomic individuals related to each other by external bonds" (Niebuhr, 1941:51) and measures value by the criterion of power rather than rele- vance to persons (Niebuhr, 1941:47). Although Niebuhr never names it such, external history is knowledge conceived in Cartesian/behaviorist terms. It is the perspective of the "scientific" observer who stands "out- side" and in so doing sees only things, objects, forms without content, billiard balls affecting each other by force, without need, purpose or intention. Highly critical of science and scientists when they serve the lesser causes of nationalism, scientism or technology as driven by a mechanistic view of the universe, and fully aware of the findings of modern physics that show the knower always related to the known, Niebuhr remains uncritical</page><page sequence="10">90 The Journal of Religious Ethics about what it means to posit such a detached, "objective" observer as this external knower. Unlike his criticism of "objective" value, Niebuhr crit- icizes the external perspective only when it is taken to be the sole perspective (scientism) or when it is applied where it does not belong - in internal history or the lives of human persons and God. He implies that external history is a complete and unbiased record of what is going on, as well as a mirror of self-reflective truth. Niebuhr (1941:65) remarks, for example, that "the church's external history of itself may be described as an effort to see itself with the eyes of God" and (1941:66) "external history is the medium in which internal history exists and comes to life." External history is a mode of self-reflection in that "to see ourselves as others see us, or to have others communicate to us what they see when they regard our lives from the outside is to have a moral experience" (Niebuhr, 1941:62). Yet it is difficult to see how one can learn about the self from the external perspective when, by Niebuhr's own definitions, that perspective is not truly intersubjective because it can see only "data relating to dead things," external bonds and force, objects rather than subjects. In affirm- ing the importance of external history, Niebuhr inadvertently elevates separateness into a virtue. Unlike his relational theory of value, knowl- edge based on external history seems to have "objective" existence as a reality lying outside of the encounter among beings. In both feminist accounts of knowledge and that of Martin Buber, external history is not simply one perspective held next to another. Exter- nal history embodies the perspective of a self or selves-in-isolation; it is a sign of a failure of relationship. In Reflections on Gender and Science, Evelyn Fox Keller succinctly states the feminist perspective on detached "objectivity" in knowledge by positing that the external knower is, in the first instance, an alienated self. My argument is not simply that the dream of a completely objective science is in principle unrealizable, but that it contains precisely what it rejects: the vivid traces of a reflected self image. The objective illusion reflects back an image of individuals unto themselves, severed from the world of other objects (animate and inanimate) and simultaneously from their own subjectivity. (Keller, 1985:70) If we were to state the feminist position on external knowledge in Niebuhrian terms, we would say that the "non-participatory knower" is a non-reflexive being created by a divorce from the beings in relation to which it has subjective life and value. It is the "I" of the I-It that Niebuhr (1963:73) characterizes in The Responsible Self as an "I" that "does not know itself as known; it only knows. ... It values but does not value itself or its evaluations." The external standpoint is an enclosure of the self by which the human "I" turns the world outside of itself into an It, renders</page><page sequence="11">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 91 the world absconditus, and, in so doing, becomes the measure of all things. It is important to realize that having lived on the "object" side of the subject/object dichotomy (as embodied in the masculine/feminine distinc- tion), when feminists look at the history of our lives they find all forms of dualism emerging from an Us/Them or over-and-against mentality. Divi- sions between two terms appear to have been constructed and then perpetuated in our history not for the sake of maintaining balance between them, but for the sake of eliminating one term or preserving the value and priority of one term over the other. As Sandra Harding (1986:23) writes: "Objectivity vs. subjectivity, the scientist as knowing subject vs. the objects of his inquiry, reason vs. emotions, mind vs. body . . ., in each case it has been claimed that human progress requires the former to achieve domination over the latter." Dualism captures and fosters power- relations rather than authentic encounters, and to understand our own history we should read subject/object or culture/nature as subject versus object and culture versus nature. Keller, herself a scientist, is describing the moral outcome of the subject/object disjunction, the hidden agenda that informs "external" or "objective" knowledge but that the distinction between speculative and practical reason has led us to ignore. When one does not divorce the head from the heart or epistemology from existentiality, then one can see that what is called "objectivity" in dualistic epistemology is called "isolated subjectivity" in concrete existentiality. The feminist position stated in Niebuhrian terms is that, given a dualistic framework, "objectivity" acts to mask polytheistic and henotheistic value-relations. "Objectivity" exalts the I-It mentality and represents the failure to identify one's own life with the life of the other. Whether based on fear, narcissism, or the love of power, the external knower reflects a desire to control the world by reducing it to an object having only instrumental value. Niebuhr would, of course, agree with Keller that the "I" of the I-It is an existential problem but only when persons are treated as objects rather than selves. He (1941:75) attributes this alienated "I" to what he calls "evil imaginings of the heart" and a life divorced from revelation (or disclosure). He (1941:74) describes "isolated subjectivity" as a depraved mode of existence that "can never enter into the knowledge of another self." He (1941:74) sees that this "I" is a self that "lives in a real isolation in which others serve only as mirrors in which the ego is reflected;" that, for this isolated "I," "it is always the T that is known and never the 'Thou.'" But Niebuhr places this critique of "isolated subjectivity" in internal history and does not see that speculative reason is both open to this charge and an active validation of this narcissism. In my view, Niebuhr is uncritical of the external perspective for three</page><page sequence="12">92 The Journal of Religious Ethics reasons. First, that perspective is informed, consciously or unconsciously, by the paradigm of the externality of God, the model of a Person who, having no needs, stands apart from the community of being. Second, in the distinction between internal and external history Niebuhr, in spite of his concern to preserve the unity of the self, ruptures it by divorcing the head from the heart. Assuming that one's "observing" life is unrelated to one's moral life, "evil imaginings" are reserved for the latter. Third, he does not associate the I-It of external knowledge with the instrumental and be- haviorist agenda of isolated subjectivity because, unlike his value theory, Niebuhr's epistemology entails an ontological distinction between human beings and the rest of nature that obscures both the standpoint of the knower and the being of the natural world. In this regard, he diverges from Martin Buber, who coined the term I-It and was one of the first major philosophers to call the ontological correlates of speculative and practical reason into question. Buber proposed, radically, that detachment and participation as modes of knowing belong only to the human knower. Buber, like Keller, focuses on the "I" doing the knowing rather than the object of knowledge. For Buber, human beings relate to the world in two modes of attention, as It and as Thou, and, like loyalty to a center of value, it is the stance of the human being that determines the form of r elatedness. One finds a critique of the human propensity for objectification in Buber's work rather than a culture/nature hierarchy. Like the community of being Niebuhr describes in "The Center of Value," Buber makes no ontological classification of the world into things and persons, thereby placing limits of subject-to-subject encounter on our faith, loyalty, awareness, and connectedness. Niebuhr, after all, began The Meaning of Revelation by focusing on the standpoint of the knower. He is close to Buber's criticism of dualism when he (1941:5) explores the meaning of Einstein's theory of spatial and tem- poral relativity, when he (1941:60) states that we must not exalt "dif- ferences in understanding into differences of being," and when he describes participation and detachment as simply two different perspec- tives. These perspectives are made necessary, he (1941:60) explains, by the recognition of our historical embeddedness which affirms that "all knowing is conditioned by the point of view" of the knower. Yet, having said that all knowledge is standpoint dependent and having (1941:36) likened our immersion in history to the immersion of a fish in water, he appears to take the fish out of the water by implying that there are "non- participatory" knowers. Unlike the objective relativism of his value the- ory, speculative reason dismisses both the embodied nature of knowledge and its inclusive subjective ground. Practical reason is likewise limited to relations between human persons (and God). Therefore both forms of knowledge are, in terms of his value-theory, subjectively relative.</page><page sequence="13">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 93 As the following passage demonstrates, Niebuhr's description of the process of external knowing assumes an ontological distinction between persons and nature that acts to mask the knower's isolated subjectivity. This knower does not encounter the other and does not meet the criterion of selfhood that Niebuhr defines in The Responsible Self as reflexivity, a self that is an object to itself. Our knowledge of other persons differs from our knowledge of objects externally regarded not only by being directed toward different aspects of reality but also by being a relationship between different terms. In objective knowledge the self is the only active being; it does the knowing; it brings to bear upon its object the concept and hypotheses in mind. In experimenta- tion it manipulates the object; in evaluation it employs its own standard of measurement. To all intents and purposes of the knower the object is a passive or dead thing. ... In all such knowledge the knower is the doer; he asks the questions which are to be answered; he judges the answer; he probes into nature's secrets and discovers what is hidden. (Niebuhr, 1941:105-106) Here Niebuhr's description of how we know nature is very much like that of both Francis Bacon and Immanuel Kant. We are, as Kant said, the "appointed judge who compels the witness to answer the question which he himself proposes"; we are, in essence, the Inquisitor. As Inquisitor we receive answers only to questions that we pose, and we can confuse our answers with what is actually going on in that which we are interrogating. Manipulation is thus assured, while there is no disclosure or self-reflection because the being of the object is denied. This external knower is clearly homo mensura, bringing its standards of measurements, projecting its own concepts and hypotheses upon the object, and judging the responses through previously posited criteria. The I-It relation is, in other words, fundamentally "subjective" because it is based on a subject cut off from the object it is "experiencing." Just as it is useless to describe value as objective when it emerges from a self-in-isolation, so it is useless to describe one's "discoveries" in knowledge as objective when the only active participant is the knower. Like value, I-Thou names the objective relation in knowledge because it preserves the encounter necessary for disclosure.4 When Niebuhr turns to the process of knowing selves in internal his- tory, moreover, we find the mutual encounter between beings also in question. Niebuhr understands revelation as the mode of knowing associ- ated with internal history or the history of persons. It is an event in which the other, as knower, comes to us and allows us to see ourselves. His (1941 : 105) rationale for speaking of revelation rather than discovery is that revelation is "the only word in our vocabulary which does justice to the knowledge of persons or selves." As opposed to knowledge of objects</page><page sequence="14">94 The Journal of Religious Ethics externally regarded, knowledge of other selves is described in this man- ner: In the knowledge of other selves both the relationship and the related terms are different. This knowledge does not run from a subject to an object but from the other to the self and back again. We cannot know here save that we are known. We cannot be the doers but must first suffer knowledge of ourselves. ... No amount of initiative on our part will serve to uncover the hidden self-activity. It must make itself manifest or it cannot be known. Selves cannot be discovered as America was found by Columbus, by sailing in the direction of a secret and a guess; this new continent must come to us or remain unknown. (Niebuhr, 1941:106) In referring to this coming "to us" as a process by which one knows only a knower, Niebuhr continues to maintain the ontological distinction between persons and nature. We can therefore summarize his description of external and internal knowledge as follows: to know an object (nature), we are the only active being; but to know a subject (human persons or God), we must first be known - we "cannot be the doers;" "our action is the second and not the first thing" (Niebuhr, 1941:106). In the subject/ object account, there is interrogation rather than meeting; I approach and objectify the passive other. In the subject/subject account, revelation is prior to meeting; I am passive and the other approaches me. But are not both of these positions extreme? Where is the mutual and inclusive en- counter of being-to-being necessary for an objective relativism? WTiat is to prevent this "new continent" from becoming manifest in this tree, this stone, this sparrow, or this virus? Why is my own revelation as a self confined, for a lifetime, only to other persons who approach me? With regard to Niebuhr's theory of knowledge, the answer to the ques- tion, Is there a Thou "within" nature? is no. The answer is no because in a dualistic framework any consideration of nature as Thou is seen to be a personification of it. In Midgley's language, some of the players have a special "stuffing." Selves are ontologically unique; they are defined by reflexivity, and anything other than an I-It relation with nature is consid- ered a projection of our own "stuffing" upon it - anthropomorphism. For this reason Niebuhr finds the Cartesian subject-versus-object relation to nature helpful rather than problematic. It is clear in Niebuhr's posthumously published The Responsible Self( 1963: 101) that the Carte- sian agenda has released us from a burden by enabling us to put aside our "old anthropomorphic patterns of interpretations." Identification with nature - a "third-person being" (Niebuhr, 1963:81) - is a personification that modern persons transcend. There are many systems we do not think of as "personal or anthropomorphic in character," including the system of nature (Niebuhr, 1963:139). Nature is "that large world of events and</page><page sequence="15">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 95 agencies that we regard as impersonal, as purely objective or thing-like in character"; nature constitutes the "congeries," a mass or heap of disor- der, "energies that we know but that we do not interpret as knowing us or as knowing themselves" (Niebuhr, 1963:79). Thus, "what he [humankind] calls his conquest of nature is for the most part less an assertion of dominance than a new interpreting of nature's ways. ... He is neither obedient nor disobedient to nature's laws, neither opposed to, nor associ- ated with, its purposes" (Niebuhr, 1963:102). This system is "powerful; it is heedless of our concerns; it is neither good nor evil. But we are in it and must adjust ourselves to it, be responsive to it" (Niebuhr, 1963:139). But how do we respond to this impersonal other and why, if "whatever is, is good," is nature neither good nor evil? The natural world comple- ments our needs more than it is "heedless of our concerns" (heedlessness is itself here used anthropomorphically), and how can we not be associ- ated with the purposes of nature if we are in fact a part of it? Why worry about homocentric projections of value and not homocentric projections of knowledge? Why criticize Albert Schweitzer for having only a "rever- ence for life" and validate a perspective of knowledge through which all things become dead? Why criticize Ritschl for distinguishing human being in worth from the rest of nature and adopt an ontology that keeps us forever separate from it? And is it not possible that the restriction against anthropomorphism is, like the requirement for detached "objectivity," a conceptual mask for our inability to engage in subject-to-subject encoun- ters? Unless one wishes to maintain that Niebuhr's statements about knowl- edge are one thing and his value theory another, then one can, perhaps, salvage both from the charge of homocentrism by a final repudiation of the perspective of the non-participatory observer - as it exists within the isolated subjectivity of the external knower and as it exists within the isolated subjectivity of God, the paradigm of the knower who approaches me. This repudiation demands that we maintain an objective relativism in knowledge by understanding objectivity as a disclosure or a revelation present only in the encounter between subjects. Both Buber and the feminist critique of dualism propose that as embodied, interconnected, historical, and responsible selves we must not exalt separation but act to preserve the ontology of life as encounter. NON-DUALISTIC OBJECTIVE RELATIVISM Niebuhr (1941:78) would say that insofar as we move out of the de- tached perspective of abstract thought and into action or participation we come to internal history, where as agents we "simply cannot escape</page><page sequence="16">96 The Journal of Religious Ethics thinking in terms of persons and values." But we have seen that the detached knower is no less an agent than any other being. Detached agency is a form of agency that, like polytheism and henotheism, reduces the world to an object of desire, a commodity. We cannot preserve the dualism between knowing and acting because it blinds us to the faith that exalts the mentality of the I-It, hinders our realization that all knowledge and action is value-laden, ruptures the unity of the self, and turns the story of our lives into an appendix. If one focuses on encounters among diverse beings and our own con- nectedness to those encounters as Niebuhr does in "The Center of Value," then history is neither external nor internal but the realm of being and becoming. History is the living dialogue of selves-in-relation, and to be commensurate with Niebuhr's objective relativism, it must include natural history and not be limited to the cultural henotheism of human being. However, for Niebuhr to consider encounter between subjects the ground of objective knowledge, he would have to understand that Thou-relations with nature are, like Thou-relations between persons, disclosures rather than projections. To Niebuhr (1941:72), "the question which is relevant for the life of the self among selves is not whether personal images should be employed but only what images are right and which are evil imaginings of the heart." He (1941:75) attributes evil imaginings to "an animistic and self-centered world," and we have seen him find the Cartesian agenda helpful in elim- inating such projections. He is correct to be concerned about which personal images are right and which are evil imaginings. An- thropomorphism, personification and the "pathetic fallacy" can all be described as projections of a self-centered world in which one attributes to others that which should be attributed rightfully only to oneself. However, when one pays attention to Niebuhr's use of the terms animism and personification, one finds that they are applied more appropriately to the Cartesian/behaviorist agenda than to Thou-relations with either nature or persons. What Niebuhr means by the term animism is not the affirmation of life and purpose that arises in connectedness to beings; he means the proj- ection of human desires and human purposes upon other beings as in fetishism, the manipulation of "objects" for personal gain. On one level he sees evil imagination manifested as an almost magical attempt to control the activity of the natural world, as if willing rain could cause it to be so. He (1941:72) defines such attempts as "mythological," meaning "the employment of personal images in objective knowledge where it is always deceptive, leading to unfulfillable expectations and to inept actions on external objects." I see evil imagination as manifesting instrumentalist control that concretely forces our own images onto others - for example,</page><page sequence="17">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 97 cows born with giant udders but no knees because we desire their udders and overlook their need to have knees. Niebuhr also sees evil imagination as an attempt to blame others for our own inadequacies - projecting from the isolated "I" image after image of persecutors. Animism is described as a personification that projects "the image of the depraved race, now in the form of a Semitic, now of a Germanic, now of a Negro . . ." (Niebuhr, 1941:73-74). But the projection of one's fears occurs because one has failed to enter into encounter. Subjective life is a projection only when it dismisses encounter, and if entering into relatedness is the primary issue, then it is just as problematic not to attribute to others a likeness that is due them as selves in the community of being as it is to attribute a likeness that is not due them. Both are projections that make encounter impossible and feed the fear of the self-in-isolation. Our likeness is our worth, relatedness, and need, and that worth, relatedness, and need is disclosed only in the affirmation of difference - the affirmation of the other as Thou. I consider a tree. I can look on it as a picture . . . ; I can perceive it as a movement . . ., ceaseless commerce with earth and air. ... I can classify it in a species and study it as a type. ... I can subdue its actual presence and form so sternly that I recognise it only as an expression of law. ... I can dissipate it and perpetuate it in number. ... In all this the tree remains my object. ... It can, however, also come about, if I have both will and grace, that in considering the tree I become bound up in relation to it. The tree is now no longer It. I have been seized by the power of exclusiveness. . . . Let no attempt be made to sap the strength from the meaning of the relation: relation is mutual. The tree will have a consciousness, then, similar to our own? Of that I have no experience. ... I encounter no soul or dryad of the tree, but the tree itself. (Buber, 1958:7-8) Buber clearly envisions the possibility of encountering any particular existent as Thou and he is clear that the encounter is not an animistic personification of the tree. To the contrary, Buber explains that the en- counter is simply allowing the tree "not to be subjected to the will of man, but left to its own nature"; relation is a way of affirming the tree "as existing just as it is, in its own right, independent of our purposes" (Berry, quoting Buber, 35). What one finds in encounter with the tree is not a wood nymph, but the first lesson of intersubjectivity: I am not you, you are not me, but we are together. Donald Berry (one of the few interpreters of Buber to take his remarks on nature seriously) realizes that it is confusing to consider the relation "mutual," but he (1985:36) thinks Buber is saying "that it is in our relating attitude to the other thing or being that we become persons, not that the other thing or being becomes a person, unless he or she is human."5</page><page sequence="18">98 The Journal of Religious Ethics The attempt not to impose one's own images, attitudes, intentions, desires, will, fears and sensibilities upon others is more than legitimate; it is the critical, reflective, objective dimension of entering into relationship to. But the objective dimension is only possible when, through an act of empathetic imagination, the subjective life of the other is present and thus able to show us to ourselves. Personal images that are right are thus those lived in a life of revelation, a life of encounter that affirms both our likeness and our differences. To see others as subjects is to affirm our commonalty without denying the uniqueness of each particular. The pathetic fallacy is, in other words, pathetic only as a failed attempt at empathy that denies others their own being. We would do better to describe the problem of "evil imaginings" as the "non-empathetic fallacy," or the failure of related- ness. The most common way we commit the non-empathetic fallacy is to refuse to acknowledge that others who differ from us are selves. Niebuhr commits this fallacy in The Responsible Self when he defines selfhood as having one criterion - reflexivity. Reflexivity is the essential criterion of human selfhood; however, to assert on that basis that it is the only criterion of selfhood is to fail to acknowledge difference and to project an artificial boundary on the community of being. Historically, many criteria have been used to define selfhood - sex, race, class and religious prefer- ence. Jews are not Christians, blacks are not white, and women are not men, therefore none are fully human. Beings of the natural world are not reflexive and are therefore not selves. We also commit the non-empathetic fallacy by refusing to acknowledge in others that which we do find in ourselves and is due them legitimately - their likeness to us in the community of being - worth, relatedness, and need. Niebuhr may commit this form of the fallacy when, in "The Center of Value" and Radical Monotheism and Western Culture, he attempts to preserve the "wholly otherness" of God by asserting that God is beyond being and has no needs. It is significant that Niebuhr (1970b: 112) refers to his statement about the absence of God's needs as a "dogmatic beginning" and a "psychological relativism" - a relativism by which one "may be able only to say that whatever is exists because it pleases God." If we understand the pleasure of God in terms of desire rather than need, then we attribute to God that which we find in ourselves but wish to overcome in ourselves - the moral arbitrariness of polytheism and henotheism. If we understand that what is "pleases" God because it fulfills God's needs, then God, like us, suffers and enjoys, and we find the presence of God in every being. Which is the evil imagining? Niebuhr (1941:73) says that evil imaginings are "shown to be evil by their con- sequences to selves." Insofar as the inscrutable "otherness" of God has acted in our history not to preserve inclusiveness but to promote and mask</page><page sequence="19">Is There a Thou "within' Nature? 99 our own desire to control each other, let us consider the first option the evil imagining by which we created God in the "psychological" likeness of our own image and the second option the true meaning of Imago Dei. God, like us has needs. When we realize that it is our encounter with the subjective life of the other that assures revelation, then Niebuhr's objec- tive relativism is preserved only by the subjective life of God as it is embodied in the needs of every being. Buber leaves this issue with the ultimate ambiguity that it deserves: "There is a becoming of the God that is. The world is not divine sport, it is divine destiny. . . . God needs you for the meaning of your own life" (Brown, 1962:126). Finally, we commit the non-empathetic fallacy by focusing on the mind rather than the body, discounting the necessity of feeling, emotion, and sensuality as modes of our existence necessary for encounter and thereby disclosure. Niebuhr commits this fallacy when he says that value is objec- tive because value-relations are "independent of the feelings of an ob- server." What he needs, and I think wants to say is that value-relations are independent of self-centered projections. Value-relations must be indepen- dent of projections to have objective existence, but they are not indepen- dent of feelings. Feeling is the way I come to recognize the life and needs of the other and myself, and to participate in their fulfillment. Feeling connects and discloses; anesthesia encloses and confuses. Feeling is not relativizing but universalizing; it is how I meet a particular being and come to love both myself and that which is other. The missing link between culture and nature, the head and the heart, is the body of God as reflected, for Christians, in the One who suffered the needs of all beings, and who said "consider the lilies." It is ironic but perhaps fitting that Buber, a Jew who loved "the grace that appears ever anew in earthly material," might remind a Christian of the power and universality of incarnation (Berry, 1985:3). The body of God is the diver- sity of the Many in interaction, and without this body we have no objec- tively present or subjectively inclusive value-center. God's lack of embodiment no more issues in inclusiveness than the knower's detach- ment issues in knowledge of that which is other, or abstraction from feeling issues in the recognition of the good for the other. It is the reflection of the One in the Many, the identification of the "center of value" with the "center" of all beings, that makes sanctification possible. Niebuhr might agree. He (1963:2) acted on the premise that dialogues are never finished, he (1941 :x) found self-defensiveness the primary error in all thinking, and he (1941:96) saw that the most painful form of reason- ing is reasoning that leads to knowledge of oneself. If anything, he under- estimated our love of power and the pain of self-reflection. Dualism em- bodies the psychological relativism of Western civilization, the history of our conquest of each other, third-person beings and third world persons.</page><page sequence="20">100 The Journal of Religious Ethics Dorothee Soelle (1984:6) suggests that "our connection to the source of life is the basis for increased tolerance and unity among us," and perhaps the affirmation of the diversity of the Many will make us One. That life requires diversity is the first lesson an ecosystem teaches us, and to know ourselves as selves means little if we are not responsible to all selves who, in relatededness, form the community of being. NOTES 1. Readers who are unfamiliar with Niebuhr's work should note that he uses the term polytheism in a distinctive (and perhaps misleading) manner. The term is more appropriately associated with a secular universe, the likes of which arose with the desacralization of the natural world, than it is a society that was either animistic or worshipped "many gods." Polytheism is defined by Niebuhr as a center of value based on self-interest, loyalty to one's own self, now desiring this, now desiring that. As polytheist, I worship or value only the things that provide my well-being. Henotheism is loyalty to a group, normally a group of selves "like me," for example, nationalism, racism, or sexism. 2. Niebuhr is fully aware of the difficulty of radical monotheism's desacraliza- tion and yet resanctification of the many in relation to the One: "How difficult the monotheistic reorganization of the sense of the holy is, the history of Western organized religion makes plain. In it we encounter ever new efforts to draw some line of division between the holy and profane. . . . [For example] the sacredness of human personality, or of life, is maintained along with the acceptance of a purely utilitarian valuation of animal existence or of nonliving being" (Niebuhr, 1970a: 53). 3. One of the best discussions of the history of this distinction and the uses of the terms "objectivity" and "subjectivity" that accompany it is James Brown's (1962) text, previously published as Subject and Object in Modem Theology. 4. Given the last three centuries of Cartesian/Newtonian history, it may sound odd, even anthropomorphic, to consider the "object" of knowledge a "subject." However, the work of Werner Heisenberg and Niels Bohr in quantum mechanics provides one example. Both of these physicists affirm that objectivity is judged not by the detachment of the knower but by the disclosures of the object under consideration - the object becomes a subject of disclosure. The object-as-subject is, as Brown (1962:18) reminds us, the original meaning of the term "subjectivity" as used by Duns Scotus. Scotus used the term "subjective" to refer to the concrete object being considered - the subject matter. Objectivity referred to an act of self- reflection by which one became aware of one's own presuppositions and ideas about the subject. Objectivity was the self-reflective act of breaking through one's own prescribed models to allow the subject to be present. Kant, from whom we derived our modern uses of the terms, reversed their original meanings. I have attempted to maintain their original meanings throughout this essay because the modern usage is both dualistic and rejected by the findings of the twentieth- century science.</page><page sequence="21">Is There a Thou "within" Nature? 101 As for the use of the pragmatic or instrumental criterion as an arbiter of objectivity in knowledge, Jacob Needleman (1976:14) - who also understands ob- jectivity as disclosure or revelation - states: "The pragmatic successes of science need to be looked upon mainly as signs of the sorts of questions we modern men are actually asking of reality . . . unless a man is aware of his own aims, and unless he is sure that his own aims correspond to the purposes that exist in objects, then the pragmatic criterion is of little use as a key to knowledge. " Finally, Barbara McClintock, a contemporary maize cytogeneticist (and Nobel prize recipient), says that nature is so complex "it turns out that any mechanism you can think of, you will find" (Keller, 1983:179). If we can find anything we can think of, then interrogation is simply following our own footsteps in the sand. To McClintock, knowledge always occurs as an encounter dependent on the identification of one's own life with the life of the other. One must observe and listen as well as question. To her the word "organism" is a code word meaning "object-as-subject" (Keller, 1983:200). For an elaboration of what it means to consider the object as subject, see my essay, "Thinking With the Weight of the Earth," forthcoming, Hypatia. 5. Berry is concerned to develop an environmental ethic and likens his position to Kant's command to treat persons as ends rather than as means. He (1985:37) clarifies that "our standing in relation to the natural does not preclude our using the natural as a means for the satisfaction of our needs; that using, however must be consistent with allowing the natural now and again to be what it is apart from our purpose for it." Anyone who is interested in Buber's statements about nature should read Berry's text. It is an excellent work that reviews all major positions on what it means to see nature as Thou, explores Buber's own developments in understanding Thou-relations with nature, and charts every reference to nature that Buber makes.
