<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE SACRED AND THE SECULAR: TLINGIT POTLATCH SONGS OUTSIDE THE POTLATCH Sergei Kan Introduction' T HE SECULARIZATION OF TRADITIONAL sacred performative genres in Na- tive North American is not an entirely recent phenomenon but it has become more common in the last few decades. During that period, the influence of Euramerican culture on many of the Indian people, particularly those who no longer speak their native languages and/or understand the meaning of traditional rituals, has increased. At the same time, with the rise of ethnic consciousness and pride among Native Americans and with the intensification of their struggle for civil and economic rights, efforts to preserve the ancestral heritage by "desacralizing" it, that is by teaching the younger generation sacred songs and dances and encouraging them to perform these in secular contexts (powwows, intertribal dance competitions, festivals of indian culture, etc.), have also accelerated. These efforts have been boosted by the federal money becoming available for bilingual programs and an increased interest in American Indian arts and performative genres in the wider non-native society. The positive results of these efforts include the perpetuation of some important aspects of traditional culture among the younger people, the strengthening of the link between generations, the boosting of self- esteem, particularly among the young who, in the elders' view, are being overwhelmed by the modem materialist world and, hence, lack spirituality needed for their survival. This development, however, has some negative consequences as well, including the decline of the religious practices' spiritual value in the eyes of many of the younger performers, which hurts the feelings of the older and more conservative people for whom they remain sacred. Since the performance of traditional songs is often done by the youngsters lacking the knowledge of the native language and the nuances of the traditional culture, they sometimes become emotionally and intellectu- ally removed from what they perform. In other words, there is more emphasis on the form of the performance rather than on its content and meaning. Sergei Kan is Assistant Professor of Anthropology and Native American Studies at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. 355</page><page sequence="2">356 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1990 In this paper, I discuss one attempt by traditionalist Tlingit elders to justify and legitimize the performance of some sacred ancestral songs and dances in a non-traditional setting, while preserving at least some of their sacredness.2 Ethnographic Background Traditional Tlingit society was divided into matrilineal moieties and clans, the latter being further subdivided into matrilineages.3 Clans and lineages owned crests, names, subsistence areas, and other forms of tangible and intangible property. Among their most precious possessions were songs and dances, many of them describing and depicting crests. Theoretically, these possessions were inalienable, their performance restricted to the ritual context, of which the potlatch was the primary one.4 The potlatch was the final stage in a sequence of mortuary rites, in which the deceased's matrikin recycled some of the major attributes of his or her social persona, sent food and gifts to their matrilineal ancestors, and remunerated those members of the opposite moiety who had earlier performed the mortuary services. By generously paying the guests for witnessing the performance of songs and dances and the display of crests, the hosts increased the value of the latter and, through that, their own rank and status (Kan 1986; 1989a). In addition to the most sacred and valuable songs referring to the performers' crests and/or their departed matrikin, several other types of songs were used in the potlatch. Among them were the so-called "spirit imitating songs" (yedik utee daa sheey[). Their words, often unintelligible, were believed to be the voices of the shamans' spirit helpers (sing. yedik), and it seems likely that these songs had once been actually used by the shamans during their seances. As Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer (1988:12) have recently pointed out, the language of these songs seems in some cases to be a human foreign language, such as Haida or Tsimshian, and in other cases an unknown language revealed by the shaman's spirit helper. For example, the yedik utee dance for the Chdatl kuyedik, the Halibut Spirit, shows a halibut being caught on a hook. By the end of the last century, as shamanism became largely obsolete, these songs/dances began to be used as part of the potlatch entertainment, while retaining some of their sacred and awesome quality (Kan 1989a: 227-229; cf. de Laguna 1972: 632).5 The existing sources differ on these songs' function within that ritual and the specific moment at which they were performed. Some mention their use to comfort the mourners, others describe the greeting of the guests with one or several yeik utee songs (Billman 1964: 63). At</page><page sequence="3">THE SACRED AND THE SECULAR 357 the present time, they are performed at the height of the potlatch, just prior to or immediately after the distribution of gifts. Quite often, the performers, or at least some of them, are those hosts that are given names in the potlatch. In this manner they seem to increase the value of the names received and, consequently, raise their own and their entire matrilineal group's status and prestige. Thus, like the abovementioned songs about crests (today called "national" songs in English) and the mourning songs, the "spirit imitating songs" remain clan and lineage property, whose performance calls for a distribution of wealth to members of the opposite moiety. In addition, in the eyes of some of the potlatch participants, yeik utee songs and dances have retained their "supernatural" quality which differentiates them from any other performative genre used in the potlatch. Thus, the yedik utee dancers hide behind a blanket, with only their bobbing shakee.dt headdresses rising above it, hiding the dancers' identity and emphasizing that they are only impersonating the spirits.6 When the dancing is over, the blanket is used to wipe the sweat off the faces of the dancers and is then presented as a gift to one of the distinguished guests. This act dramatically expresses one of the key notions of the traditional potlatch, the idea that the hosts are giving part of their own selves to the opposite moiety. In addition, the more traditionalist participants insist that the yeik utee songs and dances emit superhuman power, which could harm or bring benefits to the audience, depending on how it responds to them (see below).7 The Matrilineal Order and the Potlatch in the Twentieth Century One of the major changes the Tlingit have experienced in this century has been a gradual decline of the matrilineal order and its replacement by the nuclear and the bilateral extended families. While many of the people still know their clan affiliation and continue to be given Tlingit names, the matrilineal order now functions primarily within a more restricted sphere of the mortuary complex. The memorial potlatch persists, with many of its essential elements more or less intact, but its impact on the overall sociopolitical life has significantly dimin- ished (Kan 1989b). In addition, the potlatch has lost some of its sacred quality, at least for many of its young and middle-aged participants. In fact, the lack of knowledge of Tlingit among most of those under the age of forty to fifty and of the ceremonial expertise among many of the middle-aged people has increasingly widened the gap between the traditionalist elders (who usually run the potlatch) and the rest of its participants (ibid.).</page><page sequence="4">358 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1990 The "Cultural Renaissance" of the 1970s While the decline of the Tlingit language use and the knowledge of traditional songs and dances has been troubling the elders for quite some time, they were unable to ameliorate the situation until the early 1970s, when federal funds became available for Indian Education programs which sprang up in many Tlingit communities. This, of course, was also the time of the "cultural renaissance" on the Northwest Coast. While the teaching of the Tlingit language has had a rather limited success,8 traditional carving, beadwork and other visual arts, as well as singing and dancing have experienced a significant revival. In 1975 the Sitka Indian Education Program, which I will focus on here, was fortunate to recruit a highly knowledgeable elder, Charlie Joseph, Sr. (Tlingit name Kaal.atk) (1891-1986), as its chief song and dance instructor. Initially, he was reluctant to undertake this task, fearing criticism from the conservatives opposed to the use of clan property by nonmembers. However, confronted by a choice between remaining loyal to the indigenous law and seeing traditional singing and dancing decline further, and violating that law for the sake of preserving the ancestral heritage, he chose the latter. It is interesting that, like several other elders who have become the teachers of traditional songs and dances, Charlie Joseph, Sr. claimed to have been influenced in his decision by a close encounter with death, in his case, a plane crash. To legitimize his innovations, Mr. Joseph, Sr. used traditional ideas and rhetoric. Thus, by invoking a powerful rhetorical image of the grandfather/grandchild tie and the practice of allowing one's grand- children from other clans to perform the songs of one's own clan, he cast himself in the role of his students' grandfather, who had the right to teach them any Tlingit songs, regardless of their clan ownership. The fact that the traditional custom involved only the child's paternal grandfather (i.e., a member of its own moiety) was conveniently glossed over.9 As Kaal.atk explained in one of his speeches: Even from long ago our grandchildren we placed high above ourselves. Yes. We cherish [value highly] them. Even those things we treasure we used to offer up to them to those people who are grandchildren. That is why now we made it their vision (Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1981:3).1o</page><page sequence="5">THE SACRED AND THE SECULAR 359 In the process of teaching singing and dancing, Charlie Joseph, Sr. also tried to give the students some knowledge of the traditional social structure, so that they would recognize the true owners of the songs and dances they performed. In addition, those children who did not have a Tlingit name were given one (belonging to their mother's clan), and were outfitted with some garment depicting their clan crest. This approach seems to have satisfied the elders, who rarely complain when they see their own clan dances and songs performed on stage, espe- cially since many of them find their own grandchildren among the performers.11 Having mastered a number of traditional songs and dances, many of which are still performed in potlatches, the Sitka youngsters, known as Gajaa H6en Dancers, began taking part in various intertribal con- tests and festivals of native art and culture. They have also travelled to various places outside Alaska, performing for non-native audiences. While the children's success has received high praise from the elders, their ability to understand the deep meaning of what they perform and to empathize with those who are still moved to tears by the sad songs, have been called into question. Many elders say that without the command of the language and a good understanding of the traditional culture, the children will simply "go through the motions." And even though most of these critics admit that this is better than nothing and are happy when their own grandchildren join the dancers, they often express their ambivalence about this "cultural revival." They are par- ticularly troubled when the youngsters tread upon the more unfamiliar and dangerous ground of superhuman power. These feelings were dramatically expressed in the course of one such performance staged by the Gajaa H6en Dancers in May of 1980. The 1980 Elders' Conference The 1980 Sitka Conference of Tlingit Elders was sponsored by Sealaska, the regional native corporation which acts as the caretaker of the money that was given by the U.S. Government to the natives of southeastern Alaska in 1971 in return for land. The meeting's goal was to hear the elders' opinion about their own special needs (health care, housing, etc.) and their views on the future of the corporation and of the Tlingit language and culture. By honoring the elders, the younger and more Americanized Tlingit leadership was using a traditional cultural value of respect for the seniors to legitimize its own special role within the native society. As one of these native politicians explained,</page><page sequence="6">360 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1990 We are not looking to running the [Sealaska] Corporation in a traditional style, but we are realizing that there are many advantages associated with doing things using traditional tribal ways .... [We are trying to] find a happy medium [that would] merge our traditional ways and values with the new corporate ways (Tundra Times, 3/10/1982, p. 11). The conference's theme was "Sealaska Elders Speak to the Future." It turned out to be an important step in bringing the traditional elders and the native corporation leaders closer together and strengthening the elders' role in contemporary Tlingit society.12 The conference's highlight was a banquet which included a per- formance by the Gajaa H6en Dancers under the direction of Charlie Joseph, Sr. As part of that presentation, the youngsters performed several songs about crests and a few mourning songs. An important innovation was the inclusion in the program of several yetik utee songs and dances (Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1981:V). My impression is that such songs had been performed on stage before but probably not in front of a large group of traditional elders. The performance was presented as entertainment as well as the youngsters' tribute to the elders. A few words of gratitude were expected from the elders. The latter, however, were so moved by the performance that they responded with a series of long speeches, aimed at both showing their appreciation and casting the event into a more traditional ceremonial form. On the whole, they were very pleased with the children's ability to carry on their ancestral tradition. They spoke about the urgency of the task of preserving traditional Tlingit culture. As one elder put it, if the children would not perpetuate their ancestral heritage, they would soon be carrying around books about it, written by white people. In other words, an authentic, lived cultured would become history, no longer controlled by the Tlingit people themselves (ibid.:14a). It is interesting that much of their praise was expressed in the idioms of the traditional potlatch rhetoric. Thus, some orators asserted that the performance had brought back the memories or even the actual spirits of their deceased clan relatives, whose voices could now be heard once again in their clan songs. And that, they said, had given them emotional and physical strength, for example, by soothing the pain of losing their beloved kin. As one speaker put it: And the way they used their words these little grandchildren of mine when I hear them from their lips it is as if I can still see them [my ancestors]. That is how I feel. That is why my mind/soul gains much strength (ibid.:59a).</page><page sequence="7">THE SACRED AND THE SECULAR 361 To reiterate their gratitude, some of the elders donated money to the dance group. Speeches like that as well as the giving of money emphasized reciprocity as the fundamental principle of the traditional Tlingit so- ciocultural order. Because of the elders' rhetorical skill, the emotionally charged image of reciprocity was not weakened by the fact that, in this case, the reciprocal exchange of "respectful" ritual conduct, words, and feelings took place not between moieties but between generations. The traditional model of reciprocity was so powerful that the elders felt compelled to invoke their own clan songs and crests. They felt this was particularly necessary because of the youngsters'use of the potentially dangerous yedik utee songs and dances. The tone of the elders' speeches was set by George Davis, a very knowledgeable and highly respected elder, who acted as the audience's chief spokesman and master of ceremonies. In his words, of all the songs they [children] sang there are two among them that are sensitive and cannot be sung without a reply before people take leave. That's the way our ancestors lived it (ibid. 12a). A number of speakers followed his lead, emphasizing that without their response, the cycle of reciprocity--one of the fundamental principles of the traditional Tlingit sociocultural order--would be broken and the powerful "spirit songs" would be "echoing" or "floating aimlessly in the air." To transform the potentially harmful effect of the yedik utee into a source of good fortune (laxeitl), the elders, in the style of the traditional potlatch oratory, invoked their own "spirit songs," thus restoring the proper balance in the spiritual and social universe. As one speaker, William Johnson, explained in a highly emotional statement delivered in English: I wish somebody would interpret what we are saying. We can't help it, we have to use our own language: it is too heavy, it is too heavy for us ... how they come out.., .the Indian doctor [shaman's ydik utee] songs ... We can't just walk out of here and forget about it. They ask the Indian doctor to bless us, so we could have the power. In return, with our songs we are holding hands with them ... so that the Indian doctor songs would not hurt anybody (Kan 1979-1987). Several elders used the animals whose spirits were being "imitated" in their own yeik utee to strengthen the image of reciprocity and mutual</page><page sequence="8">362 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1990 love. Thus, George Jim, whose clan owns the Wolf Spirit song, stated that the wolf was "lapping up the trouble from among" the participants (Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1981:3 8a). Other elders offered their clan crest objects (e.g., blankets, canes, etc.) as a "brace" and protection against the yetik utee songs that the children performed.13 I should point out that the elders' response to the performance of ydik utee was not entirely "traditional." Thus, due to their limited numbers, lack of time, absence of ceremonial regalia, and general unpreparedness, they did not actually raise their hands to shield themselves from the performers' spirits or sing their own yedik utee, but insisted that they were doing it in their souls and minds. Another manifestation of the elders' creativity, an ability to adapt their rhetoric to the circumstances of the specific event, were their references to the Sealaska corporation and the Alaska Native Brotherhood and Sisterhood, as the new social groups of the Tlingit people. And even though these organizations are not kin-based, the elders used the family and kinship idioms, so as to reinforce the image of continuity between the past and present culture and social experience of the Tlingit, the central theme of the entire conference. Conclusion In the event I described, the elders were clearly improvising and innovating, while also drawing heavily on the traditional potlatch rhetoric and symbolism. Skillfully using the potlatch-style oratory, they managed to avert the danger posed by the yedik utee from themselves and their "grandchildren," while also giving the latter a lesson in such fundamental values of traditional culture as reciprocity and mutual love and respect. Implicitly, the elders were also juxtaposing the individual- istic white people's culture, which had been imposed upon the Tlingit, and the culture of their own ancestors where relatives are supposed to care for each other. As Charlie Joseph himself eloquently put it, one way love [love for oneself] will die, but love for each other will live a long time (Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1981:64). Of course, we should not overestimate the transformative power of language and oratory. The elders were obviously unable to impose their entire version of the meaning of yeik utee songs and other aspects of traditional culture upon the young performers. I imagine that most of them realized that and saw their own speeches not only as education for the young but a way of convincing themselves that there was still</page><page sequence="9">THE SACRED AND THE SECULAR 363 continuity between the culture of their parents and that of their children and grandchildren. Of course, this continuity is constantly being chal- lenged by the reality of the modern life of the Tlingit. However, it can be recreated and strengthened in the potlatches and potlatch-type perfor- mances, which bring together the different generations. The secular- ization of yeik utee and other traditional performative genres continues, along with the language loss and the further Americanization of the Tlingit. The elders cannot stop the "tide of change" (their favorite image) but can only slow it down by reinterpreting new ideas and practices in terms of traditional metaphors. They can also involve the youngsters in potlatching, in which the same songs and dances the latter perform on stage, are used to com- memorate their deceased and living kin. Since even the young can be and often are moved by this ritual, especially when the dead being honored are their own beloved kin, they could still be taught about the sacredness of the potlatch songs and dances. In fact, some of the more active members of the Gajaa Heen group have been taking an active part in potlatches, including the one in memory of Charlie Joseph, Sr. himself, which occurred in October of 1987 and in which they performed some of the songs and dances he had taught them. Another way of cultivating respect for the potlatch among the young would be to encourage them to give speeches in it, even though they could only do so in English. As long as this continuity between traditional ceremonialism and "Indian education" is maintained, the indigenous Tlingit culture would not become completely secularized, even for those young people who no longer speak Tlingit or share their elders' belief in the existence of benign and dangerous spirits (Kan 1989b). To generalize from this case, I would suggest that we must be careful not to jump to premature conclusions about the "secularization" or "desacralization" of indigenous sacred rituals. The mere fact that the latter are being performed on stage for native and even non-native audiences does not necessarily mean that they have completely lost their sacred (religious) and emotional significance. To justify such an inter- pretation, one has to investigate a number of issues, including whether the same performative genres are used in the sacred context by the same performers. The latter must be questioned about their attitudes towards and understanding of what they perform. One also has to pay attention to the audience which may interpret the performance different from the performers themselves. Finally, the history of the process of "seculariza- tion" has to be carefully investigated, so as to determine the identity of the specific individuals responsible for turning traditional forms of ritual action into staged performances, the potential conflict this might have engendered, and the society's response to it.14 In Native North</page><page sequence="10">364 AMERICAN INDIAN QUARTERLY, FALL 1990 America and in many other parts of the world this kind of research is still in its infancy.'5 And since the "secularization" of traditional songs, dances, and other genres is clearly on the rise, we, anthropologists, have our work cut out for us. NOTES 1. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the 86th Annual Meeting of the American Anthropological Association, Chicago, Illinois, November 22, 1987 and was commented upon by Linda Degh and Martha Lampland. Nora Marks Dauenhauer and Richard Dauenhauer also read that earlier draft and made a number of valuable suggestions. The help of all of these scholars is greatly appreciated. The Dauenhauers' own writing on Tlingit oratory and especially their unpublished paper "'Because We Cherish You': Treatment of Shaman Spirits in Contemporary Tlingit Oratory" (1988) helped this author clarify some complex issues dealt with in the present work. In fact, the two papers seem to complement each other nicely. 2. The paper is based on the author's ethnographic research among the Tlingit which began in 1979 and continues to this day. 3. By "traditional" I mean the nineteenth-century Tlingit culture. Some of its aspects, particularly the world view, have survived to this day, especially among the more conservative older people. 4. Clan property could be alienated when captured in war, used as an indemnity payment for insult or injury, and under some other circumstances. 5. Other native explanations of the origin of the ydik utee daa sheeyi point to the land otters and the Tsimshian (Kan 1979-1987). The former are the powerful anthropomorphic monsters, dangerous to man, with a strong association with shamanism. The latter are the traditional enemies as well as trading partners of the Tlingit, believed to possess potent magic and other outstanding forms of superhuman power. 6. The shakee.dt headdress consists of a frontal relief crest animal, often surrounded by abalone shells, surmounted by sea lion whiskers and flicker feathers, with a long train of ermine skins hanging down the back. Held in place by bristles or feathers was eagle down that the wearer shook out when dancing, creating white, fluffy drifts that covered everything like snowfall (see Jonaitis 1986:20-21; Kan 1989:127-128). 7. See Peck (1975:73), Kan (1979-1987; 1989b), and Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer (1981). From the point of view of the more traditionalist participants in the potlatch, the nature of the sacredness of the two types of potlatch performance discussed here was somewhat different. The "national" and "crying" songs are seen as sacred because of their reference to the unchanging collective heritage and destiny (shag6on) of the matrilineal group, including its departed members. While their performance remains a very solemn activity and while some of the elders sill insist that the singers have to be ritually purified, it appears unlikely that they are seen as emitting superhuman power, even though many of the traditionalists continue to say that through them the spirits of the ancestors are brought into the ritual domain. Yedik utee songs and dances, however, are still charged with substantial superhuman power, likened to a sharp knife by some of my informants (Kan 1979-1987). 8. The youngsters attend Tlingit language classes a few times a week and study it as a foreign language, without taking advantage of their own grandparents (and occasionally parents as well) who can speak Tlingit but find it easier not to do so when the children are around. So far, native language classes have not been able to combat the influence of the school, television, and other forms of the dominant society's mass culture. It is unlikely that a turnaround could occur, until the language is taught in a natural setting. Tlingit language specialists are predicting its total demise in about fifty to sixty years (Dauenhauer and Dauenhauer 1987:X-XI). 9. The Tlingit have a single term [axj leelkw ([my] grandparent) for both the paternal and the maternal grandparent. In addition, Mr. Joseph seems to have based this important innovation on a traditional practice of the father temporarily lending his clan songs to his children, as a way of honoring them.</page><page sequence="11">THE SACRED AND THE SECULAR 365 10. The translations of the speeches given at the 1980 Elders' Conference are either those of Nora and Richard Dauenhauer (1981) or my own (made with the help of several informants) (Kan 1979-1987). 11. What they do frequently complain about is the quality of the performance, pointing out that the youngsters "are not doing it right," which often means that the traditional style of singing and dancing is not being followed. 12. Since then, such meetings have taken place on a regular basis and an Advisory Council of elders have been formed to instruct the corporation on how to preserve the cultural heritage and use indigenous concepts and values in the world of contemporary politics. In the aftermath of the 1980 Elders' Conference, the Sealaska Corporation has created the Sealaska Heritage Foundation, whose task is to collect, preserve, and disseminate traditional Tlingit songs, dances, oratory, and Tlingit history in the oral and written form. 13. Cf. Dauenhauer (1975) and Kan (1983; 1989a) on the traditional potlatch oratory proper. 14. It should be mentioned that since the turn of the century, some of the potlatch songs and dances have been performed outside the context of this rite, for native and non- native audiences. Some of these early performances were staged for the purpose of fundraising by the Alaska Native Brotherhood, a progressivist native organization (initially opposed to the potlatch) which has fought for the civil rights and the general wellbeing of the Tlingit people since 1912 (Drucker 1958; Kan 1979-1987). Traditional songs and dances were also occasionally performed for tourists and as part of the various civic celebrations in communities where whites and Indians lived together. We know little about the nature of the songs that were used on those occasions, but I suspect that the clan- owned songs about crests or the ydik utee would not have been performed without the owners' special permission. Instead, the less serious "love songs" and songs obtained from neighbouring tribes (both being a standard type of potlatch entertainment) must have been used. This interesting issue requires further study. 15. It would be very interesting to investigate why some Native American tribes have been more reluctant than others to secularize their sacred songs and dances.
