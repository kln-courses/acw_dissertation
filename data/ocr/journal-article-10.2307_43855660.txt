<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Chronology of Philistine Figurines* Michael D. Press Indiana University ABSTRACT: This article provides new perspectives on the development of Philistine figurines over the course of the Iron Age I. It begins by surveying the major types of figurines in Philistia in this period and considering changes in the assemblage, based primarily on the stratigraphy of the major sites with significant figurine corpora (Ashdod, Ashkelon, Miqne). It then moves to a comparison of developments within Philistia to those in the Aegean and Cyprus. Again, sites with stratigraphie sequences are the most important sources of data, both on Cyprus (Enkomi, Kition, Sinda) and in the Aegean (Lefkandi, Mycenae). Of note is the fact that Philistine figurine developments parallel Cypriot and Mycenaean Greek developments through most of the twelfth century BCE, supporting the idea of continuing contact among the three regions for several decades. Through careful consideration of comparative stratigraphy, then, figurine assemblages - despite their relatively small size - can provide an important supplementary source of data for the chronological debate regarding the Iron Age I. In the final discussion at the 2004 Vienna workshop on 'Late Helladic IIIC Chro- nology and Synchronisms II: LH UIC Middle', one of the topics of discussion was: 'What aspects of material culture other than changes in ceramics are likely to be most helpful in establishing more finely subdivided slices of time during the 12th and 1 1th centuries B.C. in the Aegean?' (Rutter 2007: 347). To this Elizabeth French suggested, among other objects, figurines (Rutter 2007: 351). Indeed, figurines have been overlooked as chronological indicators in discussions of the Late Bronze-Early Iron Age transition throughout the eastern Mediterranean. This is particularly the case regarding Philistia. Part of the problem, to be sure, is that the chronology of the figurines has been poorly understood, with even the basic types not fully recognised until fairly recently. Now, with the final publica- tion of material from Tel Miqne-Ekron and Ashkelon, and the resulting possibility * This article is a revised version of a paper given at the 2009 ASOR annual meeting. Thanks are due to Ami Mazar and an anonymous reviewer for their helpful sugges- tions. I would also like to thank the Leon Levy Expedition to Ashkelon and its directors, Lawrence Stager and Daniel Master, for allowing me to publish the Ashkelon figurines, and the Tel Miqne-Ekron Publications Project and Seymour Gitin for making the Tel Miqne-Ekron figurines available for study and for allowing me to use images of the Ekron figurines.

My purpose in this article, then, is twofold. First, I summarise the present state of our knowledge of Iron I Philistine figurine types and present a more detailed scheme for the internal chronology, or development, of Philistine figurines (elab- orating on Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009). This chronology presents many possibilities for further understanding of Philistine culture and cultural change over the Iron Age I.1 Secondly, I compare the development of Philistine figurines to that of figurines in other Mycenaean (or Mycenaean-impacted) culture areas of the eastern Mediterranean, specifically the Aegean and Cyprus.2 My purpose is to use the figurines as an alternative source of evidence for addressing the Iron I chronological debate in Philistia, between the traditional (high, or conventional) and the revised (low) chronology. Even though the data-set is relatively small and no final judgments can be made on it at this stage, I believe that this line of enquiry may be fruitful and may lead to valuable (albeit tentative) conclusions. THE DEVELOPMENT OF PHILISTINE FIGURINES The two general classes of Philistine figurines in the Iron Age I - female figu- rines (the predominant class of anthropomorphic figurines) and animal figurines (mostly bulls) - can be subdivided into the following: psi figurines, Ashdoda figurines and hybrid/nude figurines; and decorated bulls and undecorated minia- ture bulls/other animals (Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009; Press 2007; 2012). Note that the mourning figurine (Dothan 1982: 237-249) is not among these main types. This is a minor type at best in Philistia; its identification was, in fact, largely based on a few unprovenanced examples (Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009: 48-49; also Press 2012: 19, 143-146; 2007: 34-36, 160-165). Most other figurines labeled as 'mourning figurines' are, in fact, probably examples of psi figurines. Before moving on to the chronological discussion, a note about methodology is in order. The chronology is based on the three main Pentapolis sites that have been excavated and at least partly published: Ashkelon, Ashdod and Miqne. These sites have the largest collections of Iron I figurines and the most complete stratigraphie sequences (at least among published sites; Tell es-Safi may provide additional information in the future). The Iron I levels of each site consist of four l Although 'Philistine' material culture continues through the end of the seventh century BCE, this paper deals only with Iron I Philistine types. 2 Mycenaean-type figurines are also known from the Amuq Valley, southern Turkey. To date, however, only three clear examples - two psi figurines and a decorated bull - have been published, from the 1930s University of Chicago excavations (Pruß 2010: 200-202, pls. 24:204-205, 69:5 13). While renewed excavations at Tell Tayinat might yield additional examples (see Harrison 2009: 1 83), the data published to date do not allow meaningful comparisons to Philistia, Cyprus, or the Aegean.</page><page sequence="3">1 42 MICHAEL D. PRESS main strata or phases (table 1). These strata are roughly equivalent, although there is some evidence that the Ashkelon phases start earlier than those of the other sites and may end before 1000 BCE, rather than after, as at Miqne (Stratum IV) and Ashdod (Stratum X), as the work on Ashkelon ceramics by scholars such as Yasur-Landau has suggested (personal communication, 2009). For the purposes of this discussion, I will refer to four main phases of Iron I Philistine stratigraphy: according to the conventional chronology, these would be the early- to mid- twelfth century (c. 1 175-1 150/35 BCE); the late twelfth century ( c . 1 150/35-1 100 BCE); the first half of the eleventh century (c. 1100-1050 BCE); and the second half of the eleventh century (c. 1050-1000/980 BCE). The basic data for Philistine figurines is to be found in Press 2007; 2012; and Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009. In Table 1.

It is as yet impossible to produce a complete correspondence of the data, as some of it (particularly from Miqne) is still unpublished. Most significant are the discrepancies concerning the number of psi and Ashdoda figurines, stemming from the difficulty in distinguishing between psi and Ashdoda heads. In this study, I use the neck diameter as the key criterion: psi heads almost always have necks under 2 cm in diameter, whereas the diameters of the Ashdoda necks are almost always over 2 cm (for use of this distinguishing principle, see Press 2007: 168-169 and table 1; 2012: 146-147). Heads not assigned to either category in other studies (e.g., Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009), designated 'polos heads' or 'bird heads', have also been classified here on the basis of this criterion. I have tried to indicate other cases of discrepancies below, and I provide more detailed presentation where necessary. Nevertheless, these differences are not significant enough to affect the major conclusions of this study. Psi Figurines (figs. 1-2) The psi figurine is the type most closely connected to Mycenaean models. In the Aegean, it is one of the three main types of standing figurines (along with phi and tau figurines); in the twelfth century, it is by far the most common (French 1971: esp. fig. 1). The earliest examples found in Philistia to date come from Ashkelon Grid 38 Phase 19B, Ashdod Stratum XII and Miqne Stratum VIB - that is, from the second half of the twelfth century (in the conventional chronology). The clear occurrence of several figurines of this type in such contexts counters Schmitt's idea (1999: 595, 599) of a long time gap between Mycenaean figurines of this type and Philistine parallels. Nevertheless, it is somewhat problematic that no exam- ples have yet been found in the earliest phase of settlement at Philistine sites. Ben- Shlomo has observed that a few Philistine psi examples are made of a finer clay typical of early monochrome pottery (Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009: 45); this leads us to believe that these examples, among the earliest found, were in fact produced in the earliest phase of Philistine settlement (see below). In any case, psi produc- tion in this earliest phase would have been minimal at best. It appears to have increased in the second half of the twelfth century, peaking in the late twelfth to early eleventh centuries. By the second half of the eleventh century, the type may have been on the decline; while the number of examples found is the highest, these include many figurines from secondary contexts (such as pit and leveling fills). There is no evidence of production beyond the early tenth century at the latest. Echoes of the psi type, however, are found in certain Iron II types, such as the Ashdodite heads from Ashdod (Press 2012: 180-181; 2007: 244-246) and the figurines from the Tel Yavne stands (Ziffer and Kletter 2007; Kletter, Ziffer and Zwickel 2010), which appear to be hybrids, combining Mycenaean handmade technique and style with local Levantine gestures.</page><page sequence="5">1 44 MICHAEL D.

Number of psi figurines in Philistia (arranged by chronological phase) Ashdoda Figurines (figs. 3-4) The Ashdoda, a unique fusion of female figure and chair, has been perhaps the best-known Philistine figu- rine type since its discovery at Ashdod in the 1960s (Dothan 1971: 21, fig. 91:l;Dothan 1982: 234). Unlike the psi figurine, the Ashdoda does not appear in the twelfth century at all. The earliest examples are found at Ashdod Stratum XI, Miqne Stratum VC and Ashkelon Grid 38 Phase 1 8 A.3 Thus, the Ashdoda seems to make a sudden appearance around 1100 BCE. It is not surprising 3 Previously, Ben-Shlomo and I had reported one Ashdoda head (Dothan and Porath 1993: 79, pl. 45:1) as possibly coming from Ashdod XII (Press 2007: 272-273; Ben- Shlomo and Press 2009: 53 and fig. 9). I have since been able to study this figurine at the IAA storage facility in Beth Shemesh and have concluded that it is almost certainly a psi head (Press 2012: 194-195), on the basis of its smaller neck diameter (under 2 cm; Press 2007: 168-169 and table 1; 2012: 146-147). In addition, note that the Ashdod Xllb fragment (Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.36:4; cf. Ben-Shlomo</page><page sequence="6">THE CHRONOLOGY OF PHILISTINE FIGURINES 1 45 Fig. 3. Ashdoda fragments from Ashkelon: 1) reg. no. 50559; 2) reg. no. 44919; 3) reg. no. 52435 that the Ashdoda should be a later development: whereas the Philistine psi figurines are clear continuations of the Mycenaean late psi type and in some cases exact parallels can be found, there is no exact parallel to the Ashdoda in the Aegean or on Cyprus (Press 2007: 206-212, 272-274; Ben-Shlomo and Fig. 4. Number of Ashdoda figurines in Philistia (arranged by chronological phase) and Press 2009: table 3, no. 13) is not an Ashdoda shoulder, as suggested in the origi- nal publication. Other reports of Ashdodas found in Miqne VII or Ashdod XII, meanwhile, are incorrect (Press 2012: 194, n. 9; 2007: 272, n. 170).</page><page sequence="7">1 46 MICHAEL D. PRESS Press 2009: 54; Press 2012: 162-164, 194-195). It instead appears to represent one or more stages of development beyond anything in these areas - a develop- ment that must have occurred within Philistia. There are two main types: a larger, more common form and a less common smaller (miniature) variant, which tends to be more elaborately decorated. The nearly complete example belongs to the smaller variant; consequently, this type has mistakenly come to be seen as emblematic of the Ashdoda. The differences in type do not appear (at this stage of research) to have chronological significance. The Ashdoda's greatest popularity occurs in the first half of the eleventh century (Ashdod XI, Miqne V, Ashkelon Grid 38 Phase 18A). It continues in use in the second half of the eleventh century, although not quite as common, and, like the psi type, occurring more frequently in secondary contexts. Thus, a decline appears to have started, culminating with the disappearance of the type by the early tenth century. Only at Ashdod is there any sign of continuation of the type, in the form of the 'late Ashdoda', a type restricted to Iron II contexts at this site (Press 2007: 264, 267; 2012: 192; Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009: 53). Hybrid Figurines (fig. 5:1) This is a much smaller group, only recently noticed through the comparative anal- ysis of material from different Philistine sites (Press 2007: 248-250, 275-276, Fig. 5. Miscellaneous figurines: 1) hybrid figurine (Ashkelon reg. no. 54478); 2) minia- ture plainware bull (Miqne obj. no. 4708); 3-4) decorated bulls (Miqne obj. nos. 6646 and 620, respectively)</page><page sequence="8">THE CHRONOLOGY OF PHILISTINE FIGURINES 1 47 305-306; Press 2012: 182-183, 195-196, 209). It consists of two examples from Ashkelon and one each from Ashdod and Miqne-Ekron. The type is unpainted, presenting a nude human, most likely female. The sex identification, while not necessarily clear on the figurines due to their relative crudity, is suggested by close parallels from Cyprus (discussed below). I have termed this group a 'hybrid' type based on the apparent combination of Mycenaean technique (handmade, use of applied pellets) and local Levantine iconography (nudity, including emphasis of pubic triangle; possible representation of gesture of hands to breasts). All known examples of this type from Philistia date from the end of the twelfth to the mid-eleventh century BCE: Ashkelon reg. no. 45388 (Phase 17B; Press 2012: cat. no. 77), Ashkelon reg. no. 54478 (Phase 18B; Press 2012: cat. no. 186 [our fig. 5:1]), Ashdod H1205/1 (Stratum Xlb; Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.62:5), and Miqne obj. no. 1400 (Stratum VB; unpublished). Decorated Bulls (fig. 5:3-4) The most notable type of animal figurines is a group of decorated bovines (Ben- Shlomo and Press 2009: 58-60), which occurs only at Miqne. The figurines are made of a buff or brown clay, with brown or red matt paint, usually in stripes and bands. The type is very similar to Mycenaean bovine figurines, but is distin- guished by 'naturalistic' features (such as the dewlap and back hump on many examples - also evident on Cypriot examples, especially from Sinda; Ben- Shlomo and Press 2009: 60), as well as by the use of matt (in contrast to glossy) paint. These figurines appear to be restricted to the twelfth century: they are most prominent in Stratum VII (five examples, three from primary contexts), are perhaps less popular in Stratum VI (four examples, two from primary contexts), and then disappear entirely (Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009: table 4, nos. 24-32). Miniature Plainware Animals (fig. 5:2) This is the other main type of animal figurine, with most examples probably repre- senting bulls (Ben-Shlomo 2010: 114-117). It too is largely restricted to Miqne, although there is at least one probable example from Ashdod (HI 179/1; Dothan and Ben-Shlomo 2005: fig. 3.36:8). In addition, a figurine fragment found at Ashkelon in 2009 appears to belong to this group (reg. no. 61162), although its context is currently phased as LB. Besides their size and lack of decoration, this type is notable for the signs of burning that commonly appear. Similar figurines have been found on Cyprus, especially at Enkomi (Karageorghis 1993: 43, pl. 22:8). Since the data for the miniature plainware animals from Miqne are still largely unpublished, the type cannot be discussed at any length. However, I am not aware of any chronological significance of the type within the Iron Age I. Summary To summarise the results of the above survey, according to chronological phase:</page><page sequence="9">1 48 MICHAEL D. PRESS 1 . The period from the early- to mid-twelfth century is dominated by decorated bulls at Miqne. In Philistia in general, there is perhaps a very limited produc- tion of psi figurines. 2. In the late twelfth century, decorated bulls continue, but are now in decline. Psi figurines are more prominent. 3. A major shift occurs in Philistine figurine production in the first half of the eleventh century. Decorated bulls are no longer produced, and a new major anthropomorphic type - the Ashdoda - appears. The few examples of the hybrid type also appear at this point. Overall, this phase is apparently the high point of Philistine figurine production, with Ashdodas and the continuation of Philistine psi figurines at or near their peak. 4. The second half of the eleventh century, on the other hand, is marked by a general decline in figurine production: Ashdoda and psi types continue, but in reduced numbers. It is not clear if any other major types are present.4 COMPARATIVE STUDY Having presented the main Philistine types and their chronology, I will now move to a comparison with figurines from Cyprus and the Aegean. This comparison will help us to evaluate the relative merits of the high vs. low chronologies in Iron I Philistia. While it is impossible to draw final conclusions at this point, due to the small size of the data-set, I believe that enough evidence is now available to make a real contribution to the debate and to formulate working hypotheses for further research. The comparative study consists of two parts. First, I present parallels for specific types of figurines from the various regions. Second, and more impor- tantly, I compare the phase-by-phase development of figurines in Philistia with developments in the Aegean and in Cyprus. 4 While a detailed discussion is beyond the scope of this article, the conclusions presented here (see also Press 2007; 2012; Ben-Shlomo and Press 2009) concerning the influences and chronology of Philistine figurines counter the suggestions of schol- ars who would use figurines or other material culture to suggest an important non- Aegean element in the initial Philistine settlement, whether from Cyprus, the Levant, or some other source (e.g., Brug 1985: 185-188; Vanschoonwinkel 1999: 90-91;more recently, Russell 2009). The Iron I figurine types are largely Aegean in origin, and the few non-Aegean elements (particularly Cypriot; Levantine elements do not appear with any certainty) appear only in the later phases of the Iron Age I, from the early eleventh century according to the conventional chronology. On the other hand, other representational clay objects in Iron I Philistia, specifically zoomorphic vessels, show little Aegean affinity, but rather, significant connections with the Levant, Egypt and perhaps Anatolia; the chronology of these objects, however, is unclear (see Press, forthcoming).</page><page sequence="10">THE CHRONOLOGY OF PHILISTINE FIGURINES 1 49 Parallel Types French, in her definitive study of Mycenaean figurines (1971: 133-139), isolated four major groups of late psi figurines, characteristic of the post-palatial period or LH UIC ( c . 1200-1050 BCE). Group A is similar to the regular Mycenaean psi type, but with applied pellet breasts; group B, developed further from group A, is the most common type and is characterised by geometric designs based on straight lines (as opposed to the wavy lines of earlier psi figurines); group C has very elab- orate decoration, similar to the Close Style (or pleonastic style5); and group D includes more irregular features, such as thick stems and arms that are either stubby protrusions on top or straight extensions to the sides. French was, more- over, able to identify chronological differences among the groups: group A begins in late LH IIIB and ends before LH IIIC Middle; group B, also beginning before the end of LH IIIB, continues into LH UIC Middle; groups C and D, meanwhile, are confined to LH UIC Middle.6 While no late psi A figurines have been found in Philistia, several of the Philistine figurines are good examples of the other late psi types defined by French. Thus, for instance, the vertical line down the middle of the stem, with horizontal lines extending from it - a typical decorative feature of late psi B figu- rines - is found on a few examples from Philistia, for example, from Ashkelon (fig. 1:1) and Ashdod (M1925; Dothan and Porath 1982: fig. 34:2). Moreover, these Philistine examples display profile shapes, proportions and arm positions typical of late psi B figurines (but not of later types): their stems are thinner and their arms extend upward rather than out to the sides. 5 For this term as a description of an LH UIC pottery style with more elaborate decora- tion, see, e.g., Mountjoy 2007: 223, 225; Rutter 2007: 347. 6 Weber-Hiden (1985; 1990; 2009) has suggested modifications to French's scheme of Mycenaean figurine chronology, including to her conclusions on late psi develop- ment. While Weber-Hiden 's work allows for some further refinement of the typology, her conclusions are largely based on unstratified finds and thus are of limited value for chronology (cf. French 2006: 261 n. 37; 2009: 20). Weber-Hiden also redefines the late psi groups (e.g., 2009: 31-33), although the fact that these are redefinitions and the role played by these definitions in her revised chronology are not explicitly stated in her work. French's publication of the important assemblage from Lefkandi (2006), not yet available for her 1 97 1 study, has confirmed the basic outline of her scheme (see below). The recent publication of material from Tay lour 's excavations in the Citadel House Area at Mycenae (French 2011) also corroborates this basic outline, with late psi A and B figurines beginning in LH IIIB2 and late psi C and D types only in LH UIC. However, as French observes, the late psi D figurines all 'occur quite early in the stratigraphy though the contexts are indecisive' (201 1 : 91); in fact, most of the late psi C and D figurines, including all four late psi D examples, come from Stratum X, i.e., LH IIIC Early 2. It is unclear whether this is due to the problematic nature of the contexts, noted by French; is a local development at Mycenae; or is an observation of wider chronological significance. If the latter, the observations below concerning the date of late psi C and D parallels in Philistia may be of less significance.</page><page sequence="11">150 MICHAEL D. PRESS Other Philistine figurines display features typical only of the late psi C and D types. A recent find from Ashkelon, for instance, has a thicker stem and arms that extend to the sides, features typical of group D (fig. 1:2). At the same time, the more unusual decoration may have its closest parallels with group C examples. Several examples of this group - e.g., from Mycenae (French 1971: pls. 20b:278,279 and 20d:52-16) and Lefkandi (French 2006: pl. 73:23) - are similar in having little overall torso decoration but distinctive patterns, particularly ring- ing of the breasts. Note also a late phi figurine from Athens (dating unclear, but probably twelfth century; French 1971: fig. 5) with a similar zigzag pattern down the centre of the torso. The late psi C figurines are also characterised, like the Ashkelon example, by more elaborate necklaces. A good comparison might be a small group of larger group C figurines, from Asine (Frödin and Persson 1938: 309, no. 5; fig. 212, fourth from left), Ialysos (Maiuri 1923-24: pl. 4), Phylakopi (Atkinson et al. 1904: pl. 39:16) and Aigina (Pilafidis-Williams 1998: pl. 42:159-160): the Ashkelon figurine is itself slightly larger than the usual Philistine psi figurines and also shows the same elaboration of the necklace and ringing of the breasts. There are other examples from Philistia with arms extended straight to the sides. Another example from Ashkelon (fig. 1:3), also with a thicker stem, displays an unusual set of horizontal stripes running the length of the body; compare Mycenaean figurines from Asine (e.g., Frödin and Persson 1938: figs. 212, 213:5). An example from Ashdod (S/50; Dothan 1971: fig. 65:10), with black stripes outlining the torso but no painting on the torso itself, has a very close parallel from Amyklai (French 1971 : pl. 22a); unfortunately, neither comes from a good stratigraphie context. Even such cases, however, are very significant; given that late psi C and D types appear to be confined to the second half of the twelfth century in the Aegean, close parallels from Philistia as well as Cyprus (see, esp., Coche de la Ferté 1951: pl. 7:1-2, from Enkomi; cf. French 1971: 136) suggest that contact among these regions continued decades after the initial settlement of Mycenaean groups (if we follow the higher chronology; but see above, n. 4). 7 Table 2 shows all the Philistine figurines that fit into French's late psi classifi- cation scheme. While the classification of these figurines is perhaps somewhat subjective, the list includes all of the best Philistine parallels for post-palatial Mycenaean figurines. Significantly, the Philistine examples from stratified contexts are concentrated in the second half of the twelfth century (five out of eight examples); moreover, all of those from primary contexts were found in late twelfth-century levels.

Above, I discussed the possibility that a few figurines from contexts in the second phase of Philistine settlement were, in fact, produced in the first phase. The evidence for this suggestion was the nature of the fabric. The two examples under discussion - from Ashkelon (fig. 1:1) and Miqne (fig. 6) - in addition to being made of finer clay, are, in fact, two of the best examples of late psi B figu- rines to be found in Philistia. Stated differently, the late psi B type occurs in Philistia in both well-levigated and poorly-levigated clay - i.e., clay typical of</page><page sequence="13">1 52 MICHAEL D. PRESS Fig. 6. Psi figurine from Miqne (obj. no. 5080) (for further details, see table 2) both the early/mid- and the late twelfth century. On the other hand, the late psi C and D parallels in Philistia have, at least to date, been found only in coarser clay, i.e., clay typical of the second half of the twelfth century. These results correspond to what we would expect from the chronology of the Mycenaean late psi groups on mainland Greece. Although the small size of the data-set precludes certainty, the initial patterns are striking, giving rise to an important working hypothesis that could be tested with further figurine finds. There are also parallels to the hybrid type on Cyprus, particularly an example from Ashkelon (fig. 5:1) and one from Enkomi (reg. 1167; Dikaios 1969b: pl. 147:40-41). The Ashkelon example is from Phase 18B (c. 1100 BCE), while the Enkomi example is from Level UIC (early eleventh century). As for decorated bulls, Miqne 620 (fig. 5:4) is an unusual example, with a combination of painted straight and wavy lines and dots. This decorative style finds an exact parallel among the 'elaborate style' bulls recently identified by French at Mycenae (2011: 94-95, figs. 25f, 26a-c,e) and Lefkandi (2006: 259, 263, pl. 75:64,79). The Miqne example comes from Stratum VIB (the late twelfth century, according to conventional chronology). The Mycenae examples, mean- while, are found throughout Strata IX-XI (UIC Early 1-Middle, or throughout the twelfth century), whereas the two Lefkandi examples are both from Phase 2 (late twelfth-early eleventh century). Overall, the dating of the specific parallels supports the traditional, as opposed to the revised, chronology, although the ambiguity in several date ranges means that the revised chronology cannot be ruled out. In any case, since the number of such figurines in good stratigraphie contexts in Philistia is limited, this analysis cannot be pushed too far. Comparative Stratigraphy For a more reliable method, let us turn to the comparative stratigraphy of other sites with Mycenaean figurines. This survey will consider the material at each site, phase by phase. As a result, the primary data will derive from figurines found in a clear stratigraphie context.

This type is particularly prevalent in Level IIIA, but declines over the course of the twelfth century until disappearing by the end of century (Level UIC, or even late HIB). In fact, Mycenaean types in general (both the decorated bull and the psi) have disappeared by late HIB, while two new types appear at this time: the hybrid type and a 'goddess with upraised arms' type. The latter is clearly distinct from the Mycenaean psi and shares several features with Cretan figurines of the twelfth and eleventh centuries (see, e.g., Karageorghis 1993: 58; Webb 1999: 213). A similar situation is found at Sinda (table 5, fig. 8), although its sequence is not as extensive, given that the site was abandoned around the LC IIIA-LC HIB transition (c. 1125 BCE). The site yielded over a dozen decorated bovine figu- rines, as opposed to a single female (Furumark and Adelman 2003: 118-119, pls. 37-39). Most of the figurines were found in Level II (especially in the fill mixed with destruction debris for the construction of Level II, labeled in the report 'Sinda Il/Catastrophe I'), i.e., in the first half of the twelfth century. By Level III, the second half of the twelfth century, there are very few figurines (only two or three bulls). Although the information from Maa -Palaeokastro is quite limited, given its brief period of habitation (table 6), the same basic trends are evident, with three or four decorated bulls (and two undecorated bulls or other quadrupeds) and no female figurines (Karageorghis and Demas 1988).9 Fig. 7.

The special context of Kition, that of a temple, might be responsible for the differences from other sites in figurine frequency; thus, the rarity of Mycenaean types combined with the popularity of the 'goddess with upraised arms' type, starting around 1 100 BCE, is paralleled at the Sanctuary of the Ingot god at Enkomi (also dating from LC HIB), where a group of over 100 'goddess with upraised arms' figurines was found (Courtois 1971). The possibility that these Floor II and I finds are in fact residual should also be considered. At the same time, the find of a mourning figurine (originally attached to a vessel) from the necropolis of Alaas (Karageorghis 1975: pls. 38, 80) supports the idea of at least limited continuity</page><page sequence="21">1 60 MICHAEL D. PRESS into the eleventh century. Although the figurine was not found in excavation, it comes from a cemetery site whose use is known to be limited to the latter part of late LC IIIB (c. 1075 BCE). Of additional interest is an apparent hybrid figurine found in the 'fosse funéraire' at Kition, excavated in 1959 by Karageorghis (fosse funéraire/18, Karageorghis 1960: fig. 110), who dated the context to late LC IIIA or early LC IIIB (c. 1125 BCE; Karageorghis 1960: 568-569). This figurine may, therefore, be the earliest dateable example of the hybrid type on Cyprus.10 The general picture on Cyprus, then, is very similar to that found in Philistia for much of the period. The twelfth century overall is marked by the rarity of Mycenaean female figurines. Meanwhile, the popularity of decorated bulls on Cyprus is matched at Miqne, at least. In both places, moreover, the bulls appear to decrease in popularity over the course of the twelfth century, more or less disap- pearing by 1 100 BCE (though note the possibility of continuity at Kition into the eleventh century). Generally speaking, the years around 1100 mark a turning point, with the introduction of distinct types in each place: the 'goddess with upraised arms' type in LC IIIB Cyprus and the Ashdoda in Philistia. In addition, while Mycenaean female figurines continue to be produced in Philistia (perhaps with even greater popularity), they largely disappear on Cyprus. The Aegean (table 8). - Paradoxically, while the types of Mycenaean UIC figu- rines are far better known and defined in the Aegean than anywhere else (thanks to their relative popularity and to greater scholarly attention, especially through the work of E. French), our knowledge of the figurines in stratigraphie sequence is poorest of all. This state of affairs is largely due to lack of publication. French's 1971 study was based largely on material from Wace's excavations at Mycenae, but the actual stratigraphie data are not published in full. More recent excavations at Mycenae (by Taylour, 1959-1969, in the Citadel House Area), as well as at Tiryns, have produced important new sequences, but these data are not yet fully available. The recent publication of the post-palatial levels at Mycenae includes a complete listing of all LH UIC figurines (French 2011: 862-876), but detailed stratigraphie analysis and correlation is not completely feasible on the basis of the published data.11 Meanwhile, the stratified material from Tiryns is largely unpub- lished (Vetters 2009; 2012); a deposit of figurines from the Syringes at Tiryns has 10 Note also a possible hybrid from the Level IIIA destruction at Enkomi (reg. no. 1 161 ; see table 4). 1 1 There are several problems with the presentation of the Mycenae figurine data. There is no detailed catalogue, and most of the UIC figurines are not illustrated in this volume, due to the disjunctive nature of the Mycenae publication series. Most signifi- cantly, while the list in this volume does include contextual information, determination of exact phases is not possible in several cases, as data for many of the secondary contexts are not presented and there is no master list of stratigraphie units.

Thus, the only fully published major site that has both a significant stratigraphie sequence and a large number of figurines is Lefkandi (French 2006). The data from this site can be supplemented somewhat by smaller assemblages from other sites, such as the partially stratified tomb material of Perati (Iakovidis 1969-70; 1980). Finally, the developmental sequence provided by French (1971) is still an important resource; comments. Nevertheless, it is possible to determine that, in most cases, the 1959-1969 Mycenae data corroborate those of Wace's earlier excavations (used by French for her seminal study) and from Lefkandi and other sites.</page><page sequence="23">162 MICHAEL D. PRESS in many respects this sequence has been confirmed by the results from Lefkandi, which French did not utilise in her original survey.12 Contrary to Cypriot sites, Lefkandi produced a roughly equal number of female and bovine figurines (table 9; fig. 10). In fact, while French did not deal explicitly with the relative popularity of these types in LH UIC in her original study, there is no suggestion that one is markedly more popular than the other; all indications are that both types continue to be found in significant numbers (see, e.g., French 1971: 133-139, 151-158). Thus, this general trend is paralleled at Perati, and is confirmed by the results of Tay lour 's excavations; for the latter, French notes that there were 75 female and 77 animal figurines of the LH UIC type (201 1 : 87). 13 The only noticeable major trend is a general decline in the popu- larity of Mycenaean figurines - a decline, perhaps beginning in LH IIIB2, that continues through LH UIC (cf. French 1971: 133, 153; 2006: 261). The most remarkable drop-off, however, seems to occur between LH UIC Middle and Late (in, or shortly after, 1100 BCE). Of the 44 figurines of LH UIC type from UIC levels at Lefkandi, at most four are attributable to Phases 2b and 3; other figurines found in these phases are clearly residual, from pre-IIIC types (French 2006: 257). At Perati, meanwhile, only one figurine (a bull) can be clearly attributed to a Phase III (UIC Late) context (Iakovidis 1969-70: pl. 56:494, from Tomb 56). While the data from Taylour's excavations at Mycenae are not fully clear, it appears that most UIC figurines were found in Strata IX-XI (UIC Early to Middle), with very few even possibly attributable to Stratum XII (UIC Late and Submycenaean; see French 201 1 : 862-876); however, this trend at Mycenae may be due, at least in part, to the excavation of fewer UIC Late contexts. In her 1971 study, French did not specifically address the endpoint of Mycenaean figurine production. However, no new figurine types appear after UIC Middle, and, combined with the general trend of decline and specific evidence from sites such as Lefkandi, it appears that Mycenaean figurines had largely, if not completely, disappeared by this time (cf. Weber-Hiden 2009: table 1; Dickinson 2006: 228-230). There are some clear echoes of Mycenaean figurines continuing in Submycenaean or even Protogeometric (such as at Elateia in central Greece [Alram-Stern 1 999] or even elsewhere at Lefkandi itself [Popham and Lemos 1996: pl. 126f]), but these continuations are sporadic and contain at most a few 12 The recently published LH IIIC assemblage from Aigeira (Alram-Stern 2006: 112-118) makes a significant contribution to our knowledge of post-palatial figurines from Achaea, but unfortunately the stratigraphie sequence at the site is not sufficiently detailed for purposes of comparative stratigraphy. The same problem is presented by the smaller group of LH UIC figurines from the settlement contexts of Renfrew's excavations at Phylakopi (French 2007a). 13 Roughly equal proportions of post-palatial late psi and animal figurines are also found in the assemblages at Aigeira (Alram-Stern 2006: 112-118).</page><page sequence="24">THE CHRONOLOGY OF PHILISTINE FIGURINES 1 63 Table 9.

Fig. 10. Number of LH UIC figurines at Lefkandi, arranged by phase examples in each case - examples, moreover, which have now moved past their Mycenaean models. Summary While each region (the Aegean, Cyprus, Philistia) shows unique tendencies in the twelfth century, until close to 1100 BCE the general picture appears to be one of continued interac- tion among the regions, if not always in a direct fashion. Thus, the two most common types in all regions are psi</page><page sequence="26">THE CHRONOLOGY OF PHILISTINE FIGURINES 1 65 figurines and decorated bulls. While the former are still fairly popular on main- land Greece, they are much rarer both on Cyprus and in Philistia. On Cyprus, they are dwarfed in popularity by the latter; a similar situation obtains at Miqne-Ekron, even if the type is strikingly absent from other sites in Philistia. In addition, the decorated bull appears to disappear gradually during the twelfth century in all regions. Thus, it appears that, at least on a general level, the Aegean, Cyprus and Philistia follow parallel trajectories in the twelfth century. The major shift occurs in the late twelfth century. By that point, Mycenaean figurines have mostly disappeared. In the Aegean, figurine production in general, is sporadic in the eleventh century (an exception appears to be Crete; see, e.g., Dickinson 2006: 228-230). Cyprus shows significant Cretan influence in LC HIB, in the form of the 'goddess with upraised arms' type, which becomes the main figurine type on the island for the subsequent few centuries. Only in Philistia does Mycenaean figurine production seem to continue at the same pace or even increase (at least in the case of psi figurines, although they exhibit new features evolving away from Mycenaean prototypes). The new figurine type - the Ashdoda - is a local development. Contact between Cyprus and Philistia may still be in evidence, in the case of the hybrid figurines, but these are rare in Philistia. In contrast to the twelfth century, the general character of the figurine assemblage in each region in the eleventh century is quite distinct. CONCLUSIONS This analysis has important ramifications for the comparative chronology of these regions in the twelfth and eleventh centuries, and specifically for the chronology of Philistia in the Iron Age I. At the current state of research, the evidence provided by the figurines clearly corroborates the conventional chronology of Philistine settlement. The conventional chronology gives us a result in which Philistine figurine developments parallel those in the Aegean and on Cyprus for most of the twelfth century, only diverging at the same point in time as the diver- gence in mainland Greece and Cyprus occurs (toward the end of the twelfth century). If we were to accept the lower chronology, the implication would be that the Philistines began to produce specific types only as - or after - they disap- peared in the other regions, a scenario that is highly unlikely.14 14 It is possible that an individual figurine type might have appeared in Philistia as it was declining in the Aegean or Cyprus. Use of the low chronology, however, would result in this situation for every figurine type and sub-type shared among these regions for nearly a century. Such a result is, in my view, highly unlikely. In addition, based on current evidence, accepting the low chronology would mean that certain groups, such as late psi C and D figurines, would appear in Philistia only in the eleventh century, after they had apparently disappeared both in the Aegean and on Cyprus.</page><page sequence="27">166 MICHAEL D. PRESS Ultimately, my thoughts on the chronological debate match those of Susan Sherratt (2006a: esp. 364), based on an analysis of the pottery. As Sherratt has pointed out, the advocacy of the low chronology has completely failed to take into account the effects it would have on the wider chronology of the eastern Mediter- ranean. Given the correspondences in pottery (as in the case of figurines), only two possibilities exist under the low chronology. One is that the dates for both Cypriot and Aegean chronology would also have to be lowered by about 50 years. This result appears to be unacceptable, however, based on the stratigraphie sequences at sites along the Levantine coast (Ras Shamra, Tell Kazel, etc.; see, e.g., Jung 2007); on finds of imported Mycenaean UIC, above all at Beth-Shean, where it clearly appears in levels dated prior to 1150 BCE (Mazar 2007: 571-574); and on the 14C dates published by Manning et al. (2001) for the start of LC III on Cyprus - c. 1200 BCE or shortly after. The alternative is to accept a continuous 50-year gap between developments in Philistia and those elsewhere in the eastern Mediterranean. I would completely agree with Sherratt's analysis of this possibility: besides the fact that this result has no logical explanation, it also has a much larger effect - it completely undermines the principles of compara- tive stratigraphy which have provided the foundation for the fundamental work in chronology, far beyond Philistia or the twelfth century. Thus, this possibility would also undermine the very principles used by the proponents of the low chro- nology for their proposal: the observation of the lack of Philistine pottery in Lachish VI (e.g., Ussishkin 1985: 222-223; Finkelstein 1995: 218) would thereby be rendered meaningless. I must stress once again that the data-set is quite small and that ultimate judg- ments must rely upon the sequence of pottery. Nevertheless, the analysis of the figurines provides some preliminary conclusions in support of the tradi- tional (high) chronology. The figurines constitute an important supplementary source of data - one that has been previously unexploited. In this article I hope that I have demonstrated their potential to contribute to the broader chronological debate. REFERENCES Alram-Stern, E. 1999 The Mycenaean Figurines of Elateia, in Phroussou, H.
