MAPUCHE SILVER June Bedford1 Oddly enough there have been two occasions when the history of the British and the Mapuche have touched, though by no means profound- ly - in the sixteenth century and the early nineteenth century. London was, somewhat tenuously, involved with the Mapuche Indians of Chile. In 1554 Philip II of Spain was at the court of Mary, Queen of Eng- land, on the occasion of their marriage. With him was his equerry Don Alonso de Ercilla (y Zuniga). Messengers arrived in London suddenly from Spain. They brought news of yet another disastrous Spanish defeat in the New World, and the killing of the prestigious and successful General Valdivia. Yet again more men had to be sent to subdue the fierce native people whose territory lay in what is now southern central Chile, and the young Ercilla went back to Spain to join this expedition. He has been cred- ited with giving his enemies the name Araucanos, and certainly gave them universal European fame in his best-selling, widely translated, popu- lar and very generous epic about their indomitable defence of their land: La Araucana (published in many editions in Europe during the latter part of the sixteenth century). They held the Spaniards back for well over 300 years: the longest defensive war in history. Since that time they have been generally known as Araucanians; now at last they are called by a name in their own language, and acceptable to the indigenous peoples of the area: Mapuche, people of the land. What was once their territory, but which they now share with many Chilean people, is marked on maps as Araucania, or La Frontera. It lies between the Bio-Bio River, the historic river marking the boundary they held so remarkably, and the Tolten River, to the north of Valdivia. That this land has been inhabited for many thousands of years is known, but where the people came from is still a mystery. Father Housse, who spent 34 years in Chile and nine with the Araucanians, claims they deserve the 'epic' he wrote about them '360 years after Ercilla's epic' - Une Epopée Indiennee - and suggests a long and perhaps rather fanciful direct passage from Asia (Housse 1939:2). However other unusual evidence could be suggested to endorse this view: Eliade points out that Mapuche shamanism is uniquely close to clas- sical Siberian shamanism (Eliade 1964:51, 53, 122ff, 141, 325, 326). Two concrete ritual features are there amongst much else: the shaman (machi) mounts her notched cosmic tree (reive) and beats the drum (kultrun). Alvin Josephy also points out that 'certain shamanistic practices, unknown else- 75</page><page sequence="2">June Bedford where in South America, were similar to those of Siberia and the Arctic' Gosephy 1969:256). Since much of Mapuche traditional life has been main- tained their religious ceremonies are still celebrated and the machis still are powerful shamans. Having seen how lack of 'full comprehensive instruc- tion' can weaken the religious structure of the Mediwiwin (Clifton 1994:197) it is significant that, with the Mapuche, it is still the case that those who have a 'calling' to become a machi will receive the conventional rigorous and lengthy training from an accredited machi. Photographs of machis, almost entirely a woman's profession, in Schindler 's book Bauern und Reiterkrieger, taken in the 1980s, show them wearing lavish silver decoration (Schindler 1990:93, 99, 100, 101, 102) but in this not differing from other women in the photographs, also laden with jewellery. (Since the English language has no word for finery of the Mapuche type, this unsuitable word will have to be used.) Emile Housse maintains 'Amongst no other people in the world do the women wear about themselves, as much jewellery, on feast days, as the well-to-do Araucanian women' (Housse 1939:195). There is no suggestion that special jewellery is worn by machis, though I was at first surprised to see that two of them, in Schindler 's photographs, were wearing pendants with some brass sections instead of the usual completely silver sequil de tres cadenas. (Schindler 1990:93, 99) (Plates 5, 6). However I have now learned that this is entirely secular and a novelty of the 1960s (Reccius 1983:21). Silver touches the shamanistic world also in the matter of ritual: after her long apprenticeship the machi's final acceptance is celebrated in the ceremony - machiluwn - where her sacred tree, which she is to mount at the supreme moment of the ceremony, has been set up 'over ancient silver coins' (Del Solar 1992:91). There is also a tentative suggestion of another shamanistic connection with one of the most popular pieces of silver jewellery, the sequil de tres cadenas, or sequil acucha. This has been graphically, if not literally, implied by Leslie Faron, who shows in the frontispiece of his book, Hawks of the Sun (1964), a photograph of women wearing sequil de tres cadenas, with the caption 'What has happened to you on your trip to the sky? Have you become hawks of the sun?' This is the traditional rhetorical question asked of powerful ancestral spirits who all become birds or butterflies or other winged creatures. As can be seen in Plates 5 and 6 the upper panel is in the shape of two heraldically opposed birds with wings outstretched. Perhaps Faron was suggesting a possible representation of the hawks of the sky. But a very much more prosaic prototype has been put forward, I have now discovered: the escudo imperial de los Hapsburgo (Reccius 1983:20). Yet undoubtedly ancestors remain all-important. Faron maintains that 76</page><page sequence="3">Mapuche Silver The most dramatic aspect of social action involved in the central concept of Mapuche morality revolves around the belief that ancestors are sacred and influential spirits whose existence regulates, and depends upon, human moral conduct' (Faron 1964:5). Augustin Edwards, himself a Chilean, understood very well just how significant this intense feeling for their ancestors was during the bitter Mapuche war against the Spaniards. Historians describe as almost beyond belief their bravery and determination in their long struggle, but Edwards points out in Peoples of Old (1929:88) that 'even greater than their fear of death or even the most horrible mutilations was the dread inspired by deportation to the mines in the highlands of Peru, whither the Spanish conquerors, owing to lack of labour, used to send them in thousands. For there they had to abandon their supreme aspiration of dying in their native country and of sleeping the eternal sleep at the side of their ances- tors. This was then, as now, one of their ineradicable desires.' It was at the ngillatun festival, held at difficult times and at times of cri- sis, that the invocation of the ancestors took place, by men who arrived on horseback and performed the necessary ritual. The horse came to be of very great importance in Mapuche life. When they first saw the horse it was a terrifying foe and Spaniards on horseback were taken to be centaur- like creatures. But very soon they had captured horses and became quite superb horsemen, using them to great advantage against their invading Spanish enemy and in later confrontations. They were the first native peo- ple to control and ride horses in the New World. Only 20 years after the Spaniards' arrival in their country, by 1560, they were controlling and rid- ing the herds of horses they had bred from those taken from the Spaniards. It is not surprising that at the time when silver work was at its peak the horse was the recipient of superb silver decoration: spurs, bri- dles, stirrups, head stalls and even ornamented whips. It will be seen that the horse was very important in Mapuche life at the end of the eighteenth century. Going back in search of answers about early Mapuche decoration to the many travellers and chroniclers who for over 400 years had been observ- ing and writing about them, ever since Ercilla, we learn that earrings were enormous and of brass. Falkner writes that women have no attire for their heads but have their long hair plaited in two large tresses, which hang down on either side. They wear earrings, or pendants, or square brass plates about two or three inches broad, and as many deep, with a piece of the same metal well hammered to prevent their ears, which are wide- ly bored, from being cut. They wear strings of sky-blue beads 77</page><page sequence="4">June Bedford round their necks, arms, and ankles. (Falkner 1774:131) In the prestigious Museo Chileño de Arte Precolombino in Santiago, whose catalogue I am using as a basis for my nomenclature (Reccius 1983), they regret there are no specimens of the early earring (of 20 or more cms), as evidently only one pair now survives, in the Museo de Don Bosco de Punta Arenas. Edmond Reuel Smith, of the US Navy Astronomical Expedition to Chile, 1855, describes 'the female head-dress, composed entirely of beads of different colours' and goes on to say 'the neck is encased with a leather collar, studded with silver [ngutroe]. A great profusion of beads, in strings of various colours, are worn hanging upon the breast, with the addition of silver dollars, thimbles, etcetera.' (The 'thimbles' would have most likely been small cones.) Then later he writes 'the other [garment] is thrown over the shoulders and pinned in front with a silver pin, the head of which is sometimes globular, but more frequently is flat, and about the size of a small dinner plate' (Reuel Smith 1855:208). So the globular silver pin, the punzón ucucha and the 'small dinner plate' on a silver pin, the punzón tupu, were certainly already in use in the middle of the nineteenth century (Plates 16-18, 13-15). However by the time Father Housse is describing the jewellery in the 1930s he mentions all the main types which are so clearly set out in the book of the 1983 exhibi- tion, Platería Araucana at the Museo Chileño de Arte Precolombino (Rec- cius 1983). He also describes a type which is not shown - the bracelet - but since he adds that this is something that was 'reserved long ago for wives of the chiefs' perhaps they may have been kept and treasured (Housse 1939:196, 198). Augustin Edwards (1929:54) also mentions bracelets, 'trau- co, and also trari mamum - which they wear round their wrists and ankles/ Neither of these types are present in the Museo Chileño's catalogue. The mention of the bracelets 'reserved for the wives of the chiefs' takes us to the very heart of the extraordinary historical background which lay behind the sudden appearance of Mapuche silver pieces of such quality. The prosperity of the chiefs in the eighteenth century was a very important part of the revolution that had taken place in Mapuche life. Referred to by the Spanish as caciques, but by the Mapuche as lonko and ulmen, they had not in the past ever had the autocratic power they achieved in the latter part of the eighteenth century. Indeed so democratic were the attitudes of the early centuries of the Spanish invasion that when battles were immi- nent representatives of the various Mapuche groups got together to choose an overall and all powerful war-leader, toki. The very moment the warlike situation was resolved his powers completely disappeared. This was not 78</page><page sequence="5">Mapuche Silver the case at the end of the eighteenth century. The powerful and wealthy chiefs wanted to retain their power and wealth, and to be seen to be impor- tant people, with their horses and their wives bedecked with silver. During the centuries of sporadic warfare after the Spanish invasion the Araucanians were sandwiched geographically between a mixture of peo- ple to the south, the Chileans, who had in effect accepted Spanish rule, and the still threatening Spaniards to the north. But the eighteenth century was regarded by the Mapuche as a pacific period, as there were only two short wars against the Spaniards. They were able to concentrate on their enormous potential assets. Although they were squeezed in between Spaniards and Chileans, they had used this to their advantage. They had spread eastwards into the Pampa, and found allies in the wilder tribes who roamed this enormous plain, the size of France and Germany togeth- er. This was known as The Araucanisation of the Pampa'. Indeed so far east had they penetrated, and so powerful had they become, that extraor- dinarily we find several chiefs offering the military command in Buenos Aires their help against the British, who had taken Buenos Aires in 1806 (the second British connection). It is, of course, said that the Spaniards refused their offer! The chiefs had by then great herds of cattle, horses and sheep. They were extremely powerful, controlling large roving bands of men, and they were now able to trade with their non-Mapuche neighbours and become wealthy in the accepted sense. The significant fact about this wealth is that 'by the end of the century [eighteenth] the Mapuche began to accept silver money in payment for their animals, with the sole purpose of converting it into adornment for their women, and apparatus for riding/ They also found silver objects 'easily movable, and good for interchange in moments of necessity' (Reccius 1983:10). Unlike those of earlier years, when there was no respite from war, these chiefs loved to enhance their status. What better than getting the retrave or silversmith (and every chief had his resident retrave) to make more and finer silver accoutrements for the chief's horse and more jewellery for his wife, and often also for his daughter's dowry? The silver jewellery too, in time, became more even than a status symbol. Reading between the lines it seemed that silver was almost an obsession: it played a large part in their lives and acquiring it took up a great deal of their time and energy. When payment was offered in ounces of gold, this was always refused with positive distaste. That was a peak time for the Mapuche, but things started to go wrong. In 1810 the Chileans, following the international fashion of the time, fought for and won their independence from Spain. During the nineteenth 79</page><page sequence="6">June Bedford century the Mapuche were to find them more difficult to defeat than the Spaniards. The story of the Mapuche from then on is a sad one and many of them are now in reservations. But their culture remains vital and they form the third largest indigenous population in South America with, I have recently learned from a Mapuche quoting a census of 1992, a popula- tion of over one million people. Not all the silversmiths have disappeared. The retrave Armando S. Huaiquilis, shown in a photograph taken in 1983 (Schindler 1990:96) is still using exactly the same equipment for sand-casting described in Housse and Edwards, and no doubt going very much further back. A dou- ble box-type frame is filled with fine, moistened sand. A model of the required piece of jewellery is then placed in the sand and compressed to make a mould. The sand is then allowed the dry and the two halves of the frame are held together by a leather strap. In the photograph the silver- smith has spread an animal skin on the ground with his equipment. Sit- ting on a stool beside it, he is pouring the molten silver from a small stone crucible held in a pair of tongs into the mould. As he pours the silver into one channel the air escapes from the other channel that has been provided. (The silver would almost certainly have been an alloy.) Like the smiths of older days he would also use hammering of either cold or heated silver. In the case of the globular pieces they would have beaten the sheets of silver thin with a hammer, then bent and soldered them. Mapuche silverwork still leaves us with many unanswered questions. Yet we must admire this late flowering of silver craftsmanship, totally unique and imaginative, from a people who have been celebrated only for their bravery and warlike qualities. Dating the Silverwork It is a difficult task to give an exact date to the Mapuche jewellery that has survived. Helmut Schindler, of the Munich Völkerkunde Museum, main- tains that nothing can be dated safely in the eighteenth, or even the early or middle nineteenth century, since with changes in fashion silver was contin- ually melted down and made up in the 'new' style (Schindler 1990:139). Günther Hartmann of the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin, points out that the Berlin museum's very earliest pieces were only acquired in the second half of the nineteenth century: the first pieces singly, between 1854 and 1864, and the first collection in 1870, through a Berlin businessman. This had been collected earlier by the Governor of Punta Arenas and the age of the pieces when collected is not known (Hartmann 1974:43). However Walter Reccius, the distinguished Mapuche scholar after 80</page><page sequence="7">Mapuche Silver whom the Furman family named the great collection of Mapuche silver- work they gave to the Museo Chileño de Arte Precolombino, Santiago, comes to grips with the problem. He mentions the historic background of metalworking by the Mapuche in his splendid book Platería Araucana (Reccius 1983), and then goes on to deal historicaly with the creative, exu- berant period of Mapuche silverwork which started during the eighteenth century and continued well into the twentieth. Although the silversmiths had, in the early period at least, to accommodate the whims of their mas- ters, the powerful lonkos, the styles were extremely traditional and conser- vative. Because of this we can follow their development and appreciate the amazing individuality within the boundaries set. Reccius sees the peri- od of Mapuche art history since the Spanish invasion in four epochs: Epoch 1 The early post-hispanic years: very little remains from this time. Epoch 2 The eighteenth century and the very early part of the nineteenth: the beginning of the flowering of Mapuche silverwork. Epoch 3 The nineteenth century: with new types and the further develop- ment of former types. Epoch 4: The twentieth century: continuation and eventual decline. His information about the order in which the different types of objects developed and changed is also extremely helpful in dating them. Yet nei- ther he nor any of the other authorities on the silver have been able to give any exact dates to the pieces: Schindler (1990) gives no dates at all and Hartmann (1974) gives only dates before which the pieces must have been made, supposedly when they came to the Völkerkunde Museum, Berlin. Notes on the Plates Plates 1-24 show types of Mapuche jewellery as listed and sketched in Platería Araucana. Approximate dating is also based on this work (Reccius 1983). Private collection. Photographs by Errol Bedford. A. Sequil (Plates 1-6) Pendants worn either attached to a traripel (a collar usually made of leather, sometimes covered with small silver beads) or held in place by a tupu, a large pin with a flat disc or a sphere at the top. 81</page><page sequence="8">June Bedford (a) Sequil de tubos. Pendant with tubular hangings, ending in a circular or oval ornamented silver plate, with unusually complicated decorations of anthropomorphic figures and single heads. On the foot of the decorated plates hung varied small pendants such as discs, five-finger plates or sometimes small modelled anthropomorphic figures. Plates 1-3 show discs with figures. (For tubular hangings see Plate 24.) Reccius tells us that this is the earliest sequil type (Epoch 2), with an animal or human head on the oval pendant (Plate 3) and that there is also very rarely an anthropomor- phic figure with arms and legs extended on the oval pendant (Plates 1, 2). From this we can infer that this type was first made in the late eighteenth century and that these three pendants were probably made then or fairly early in the nineteenth century. (b) Sequil de placas. Pendant (or 'breast ornament') generally made of sil- ver plates joined together, with a decorated oval plate at the foot. There are many varieties of this type, which was the second type of sequil to be made (Epoch 3) and Reccius describes one with four plates of silver, but adds that they vary between four plates and ten (Plate 4). We can infer the date of this very fine silver piece, with eight silver plates, to be the first half of the nineteenth century. A very similar sequil is scrupulously dated by Hartmann (1974) as pre-1922 (no. 45). This was presumably when it reached the Museum für Völkerkunde, Berlin. (c) Sequil acucha or sequil de tres cadenas. At the end of the nineteenth cen- tury appeared a new type of pectoral with three chains, which could be attached to the garment with a metal clasp instead of needing the traripel (collar) or tupu (pin) (Plates 5, 6). This type (Epoch 4) cannot easily be dated: it is probably still being made owing to its tremendous popularity. It is seen in many 1980s photographs in Schindler's book (1990:13, 75, 93, 94, 99, 102, 135, 158, 198). It is interesting to see that what Reccius points out in the development of the trarilonco is also the case here with the three heavy hanging chains: the links have become the decoration. Some help with dating is given by the quality of the silver: the somewhat darker colour of the metal in Plates 5 and 6 suggests that it is alloyed and I would date them to the 1920s or 30s. B. Trarilonco (Plates 7-9) Although this type of adornment looks like a necklace it is a head orna- ment worn with the silver discs hanging down over the forehead. There are more or less elaborate types of chains, with differing links. 82</page><page sequence="9">Mapuche Silver (a) Cadenas de eslabones esculpidos. Chains with cut and decorated links (Plate 7). (b) Cadena de placas. A chain with panel-shaped links (Plate 8). (c) Cadenas de eslabón simple. Chains with single links (Plate 9). Reccius tells us how the type of links in these various headbands provides the information for dating them. The very earliest type made in the eigh- teenth century (Epoch 2) was simply coins joined with small flat links. The trarilonco eslabones esculpidos with 8-shaped links (Plate 7) and the rectan- gular plate link (Plate 8) also appeared in the eighteenth century. These early examples were made of very fine coin silver. This is not the case with Plates 7 and 8, which probably date to the first half of the nineteenth cen- tury. The third type he mentions (Epoch 4) (Plate 9) is when the link itself has become the decoration: as he puts it, 'the little link between the big links has become the main link!' Plate 9 can therefore be dated to the latter half of the nineteenth century or even into the twentieth. In this specimen the deterioration of the silver is very noticeable: it has a considerable con- tent of another metal, probably copper. C. Trapelacucha (Plates 10-12) These pendants with crosses and dangling discs of silver are made in many forms. The crosses are of course not Christian crosses. Father Housse (1939:116) makes it quite clear that successive groups of Francis- cans, Jesuits and Capuchins made little impact on the Mapuche. He writes 'after 320 years of evangelisation the proud and bellicose Araucanians were as pagan as at the time of the conquest'. (a) Trapelacucha de tubos with silver tubes. (b) Trapelacucha de placas with panels of silver (Plates 10, 11, 12). (c) Trapelacucha de cadena con eslabones simples with a chain with single links (Plate 12, R). Reccius tells us that it was the silver tubes with the hanging crosses (no pho- tograph) which were the earliest of this genre (Epoch 3) and I think we must also put the trapelacucha with three chains and crosses (Plate 10, L) with the earliest pieces at the beginning of the nineteenth century. Next in date (also 83</page><page sequence="10">June Bedford Epoch 3) came the chains made of silver plates of varying sizes joined with links, and the majority of pieces in Plates 10, 11 and 12 are of this category, probably made during the middle to the second half of the nineteenth cen- tury. Interestingly the chain of the third and latest type of trapelacucha which Reccius describes evolved in the same way as the sequil (Plates 5 and 6) and the trarilonco (Plate 9): the links became the decoration and formed the whole chain (Plate 12, R). This last piece could be twentieth century. D. Tupu (Plates 13-18) The tupu is a large pin used to fix other decorations at the neck of the wearer, and comes in two forms: the flat disc and the spherical. (a) Punzón tupu. Flat disc (Plates 13, 14, 15). (b) Punzón acudía. Spherical (Plates 16, 17, 18). Reccius dates the tupu back into pre-hispanic times. He suggests it has evolved from simple copper pins and has been preserved into modern times. Since the eighteenth century very large punzón tupus have been made, 7-20 cms in diameter with decorations of crosses and circles. Attached to the backs of the discs are pins of 15-45 cms. In the region of Panguipulli smaller ones are made of very fine silver with diameters from 7-8 cms. The two smaller punzón tupus (Plates 13, 15) may well be from this area and could be eighteenth century, as could the larger pin in Plate 14. The punzón acucha evolved from small copper pins into very large sil- ver spherical pins (Epoch 2), 6-12 cms in diameter with pins from 12-40 cms. They often had a cross on a small extra column at the top. Slightly different punzón acucha were made at San Juan de la Costa in the province of Asorno and a region between Victoria and Freire. The two very large specimens in Plate 17 are of very fine silver and probably early nineteenth century. The smaller ones in Plate 16 are also of very fine silver but I would place them in the mid-nineteenth century. Plate 18 is more difficult to place as it is of inferior metal but has the look of age. I would date it to the twentieth century. E. Chaguai (Plates 19-21) Chagua i, earrings, or large ear ornaments, have evidently been worn for a very long time by Mapuche women, and one plain type seems to have sur- vived. There are several other types of which two are described here. 84</page><page sequence="11">Mapuche Silver (a) Chaguai'Chapel. This is a direct descendant of the large old earring but much smaller and trapezoidal not rectangular. Epoch 2, late eighteenth or early nineteenth century (Plate 19). (b) Chaguaitu. These earrings are said to be in the shape of the new moon and its various stages. Epoch 2, late eighteenth or early nineteenth century (Plate 20). (c) Chaguai-upul. Bell-shaped earrings. This type lasted throughout the nineteenth century. This pair, which are of very fine silver and worksman- ship, can be placed in Epoch 3, in the early nineteenth century (Plate 21). F. Ngutroe (Plate 22) Small silver beads on strips of woven material. Reccius tells us of the great popularity of this ornament which Mapuche women wrapped around their hair and used in many other decorative ways, and adds that they especially liked the zigzag design. Epoch 3, nineteenth century. G. Ihuelcuk (Plate 23) Rings seem not to be greatly worn, as few are shown. Some are plain silver and others have a decorated silver disc attached. Reccius suggests that rings were taken over from Europeans. They were first made with a five centavo piece at the time of its issue between 1911-20, and then copied. Plate 23 was not made from this coin so must be later, possibly 1930-40. H. Llol-llol de tubos (Plate 24) There are many types of llol-llols, with bell-shaped silver cones, but Rec- cius gives no detail about their decorative purpose. However, Schindler makes it clear (1990:44) that silver adornment 'should not only delight the eye, and direct your gaze to the wearer, but also attract your attention acoustically. For that reason it is provided with numerous hangings and attachments, which with every movement let you hear a soft jingling and tinkling/ Although Reccius does not mention this particular type, he puts chicol and regni-regni, which are very similar, into Epoch 2. The llol-llol in Plate 24 is probably late eighteenth century. It illustrates the tubular hang- ings which also form part of the sequil de tubos and trapelacucha de tubos. 85</page><page sequence="12">June Bedford ríate 1 rendant from foot of sequil de tubos or sequil de placas.
