As someone who only comparatively rarely ven- tures into first-hand research involving animal behav- iour, I found much of value in this book, as I am sure undergraduates and graduates would too. However, it would be interesting to be able to ask Charles Dar- win for his own thoughts! PAUL M. BRAKEFIELD C. A. Spinage (1994) Elephants. Pp. xvi+319. T. &amp; A. D. Poyser Ltd, London, UK ?25. ISBN 0-85661-088-7. Although it is not apparent from the book itself, this is one of a series of natural history volumes, which Poyser has recently taken over from the previous pub- lishers. There has been a rash of elephant books over the last decade and one might ask what is new about this one. As far as the biology of the elephant is con- cerned, there is nothing that is not already well known, but in the degree of detail of the history of man's relationship with elephants, this book is unique. Dr Spinage has one of the best private collections of books on elephants and there is little that he does not known about them. His approach is scholarly and meticulous and one can be sure that if he gives a date in antiquity it will be the correct one. Similarly, one can rely on biological information being factually accurate. It is a pity, therefore, that the text is not referenced in the usual way to enable the reader to follow up some of the assertions made. If the omission of references is the policy of the series editor, then the book is not appropriate to the series. There are full, although not exhaustive, chapter by chapter reference lists at the back of the book, but it is not always clear to which publication a particular statement refers as the names of the researchers are not given (unless they have died, preferably at least a century ago!). In some cases with which I am familiar, the appropriate ref- erence is not cited in the bibliography. The book is divided into 15 chapters that combine biological and historical detail. The first chapter, which deals with the evolution of the order Probos- cidea, is one of the least satisfactory and I wonder if a reader unfamiliar with the subject would feel fully informed. A few illustrations of members of the extinct families would have helped to make the various relationships clearer. Some statements are misleading if not incorrect, e.g. 'The mastodons of the family Mammutidae were allied to the true elephants rather than to the mammoths.' Surely the woolly mammoth was a true elephant? The anatomy and physiology of the elephant are dealt with competently, with little nuggets of detail, such as the record weight of a gall stone. The chapter on reproduction is slightly more anthropomorphic than one would expect from a scien- tist, and it is a pity that the modern trend is followed of not distinguishing between 'suck' and 'suckle'. The life history and disease risks occupy a couple of chap- ters and a third is devoted to the elephant's social life. This is a reliable and up-to-date account although I wonder if 'incontinence' is an altogether accurate word to describe the dribbling of urine by the musth male. This probably is not involuntary but has the function of advertising the elephant's reproductive status. A chapter on feeding leads into the puzzling question of tree destruction by elephants. The author considers the various possible reasons but, perhaps wisely, does not decide in favour of any particular hypothesis. Over-population is probably a factor and several case histories are considered, although it might have been better to have discussed these after, rather then before, the chapter on population dynamics. There are two excellent chapters on ivory and the ivory trade, which, as one might expect, are covered in great detail. The final chapter is concerned with the domestication of elephants and shows that the African species is every bit as trainable as the Asian. It is indeed surprising that more use has not been made of African elephants for transporting national parks' visitors on game-viewing trips. The book is well illustrated with pleasing line draw- ings by Larry Norton, who has also contributed an evocative painting for the frontispiece of a huge tusker. There are many black and white photographs scattered throughout the book as well as a group of coloured plates. Since only a few of these carry attributions, the others are presumably by the author, who is well known as an accomplished photographer. This is a distinguished contribution to the literature on elephants. It is well written and a pleasure to read, with the factual information laced with anecdotal detail. This enlivens the text even though there may be some repetition, e.g. the story about the slaughter of the Asian bull by cannon shot in Geneva in 1820, which is recounted on p. 73 and again on p. 273. The book is full of reliable information and can act as a reference volume as well as a text to be read through from beginning to end, but anyone dipping into it to check a fact is likely to submit to temptation and continue reading far beyond the original page consulted. An additional bonus is that by today's standards, it is relatively cheap. It can be thoroughly recommended. S. K. ELTRINGHAM D. Brown &amp; P.
