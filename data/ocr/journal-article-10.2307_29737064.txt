Springer 2006 DOI 10.1007/s 11159-005-5614-2 INTRODUCTION: EDUCATION AND SOCIAL JUSTICE JOSEPH ZAJDA, SUZANNE MAJHANOVICH and VAL RUST The epistemology of social justice Social justice has fascinated many thinkers around the world, including Pla? to (427-347 BC). In The Republic he argued that an ideal state would rest on the following four virtues: wisdom, justice, courage, and moderation. When Thomas Aquinas (1225-1274), influenced by Aristotle, wrote that "justice is a certain rectitude of mind whereby a man does what he ought to do in the circumstances confronting him" (quoted in Kirk 1993), he believed that justice was a form of natural duty owed by one person to another. Sim? ilarly, Immanuel Kant (1724-1804) maintained that actions are morally right if they are motivated by duty without regard to any personal motive, or self interest. Kant's theory of social justice is based on the concept of selflessness and moral duty. His moral theory based on duty is also known as deontol? ogy. In his view, the only relevant feature of moral law is its universalisability, and any rational being understands the categorical imperative, namely: "Act only on that maxim which you can at the same time will to become a uni? versal law" (Flew 1979 191; Johnson 2004). The term "social justice" was first used in 1840 by a Sicilian priest, Luigi Taparelli d'Azeglio, and given exposure by Antonio Rosmini-Serbati (1848) in La Costitutione Civile Secondo la Giustizia Sociale (Novak 2000). Subse? quently, John Stuart Mill (1806-1873) gave this anthropomorphic approach to social justice almost omnipotent status in his book Utilitarianism, Liberty and Representative Government (I960: 57-58): ... we should treat all equally well ... who have deserved equally well of us, and that society should treat all equally well who have deserved equally well of it, that is, who have deserved equally well absolutely. This is the highest abstract standard of social and distributive justice, towards which all institutions, and the efforts of all virtuous citizens, should be made in the utmost degree to converge. At the end of the 19th century, the term "social justice" was used by social reformers as an appeal to the ruling classes to attend to the needs of the new masses of uprooted peasants who had become urban workers, or dispos? sessed (Novak 2000). The meaning of social justice may vary according to different definitions, perspectives and social theories. Most conceptions of social justice refer to an</page><page sequence="2">10 Joseph Zajda, Suzanne Majhanovich and Val Rust egalitarian society that is based on the principles of equality and solidarity, that understands and values human rights, and that recognises the dignity of every human being. In this sense, it reflects the three values and symbols of the French Revolution (1789-1799): liberty, equality and fraternity. Globally, the most frequently quoted expression of the founding principles of social jus? tice is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which was endorsed by the international community in 1948. Most social-contract theories from Rousseau and Mill onwards stress the importance of the state that gives pri? ority to the "welfare of its citizens and that ensures that some basic inalien? able rights are protected" (Schugurensky 2004: 2). A social-justice-oriented government, if it is to reflect its ideology of egalitarianism and move beyond the level of policy rhetoric, has to ensure a more equitable and fair access to resources, and socially valued commodities. As White and Talbert (2005: 59) explain, education for social justice needs to move beyond functionalist and vocationalist-oriented perspectives on schooling (which stress education for jobs) to one where the traditional model of schooling becomes a transforma? tional pedagogy: ... we must prepare children for active participation as global citizens; and this means that we have a responsibility to teach for social justice ... Social justice educa? tion moves beyond traditionalist essentialist practice by suggesting that student and teachers are active and equal participants in all schooling ... Advocates for social jus? tice education suggest that our schools are often demeaning and disempowering pla? ces where children and their teachers are either bored into submission or where the transmission and socialization techniques destroy any hope for critical-thinking. Traditionally, when wrestling with questions of inequality and social injustice, scholars and social reformers have turned to the works of such philosophers as Jeremy Bentham, John Locke, Thomas Hobbes and John Stuart Mill. No? tions of social justice typically find their derivation in Plato and Kant's moral philosophy and in particular the latter's concern that actions must be con? nected to moral considerations. Jeremy Bentham (1748-1832) and John Stu? art Mill judged the morality of an act solely on the basis of its results. The latter also argued passionately that "All persons are deemed to have a right to equality of treatment" (Mill 1960: 59). Justice was achieved in any situa? tion where the greatest happiness was achieved by the greatest number of people. Bentham advocated socially imposed external sanctions of punish? ment and blame to make the consequences of improper action more obvi? ously painful. Social justice was to be achieved through deterrence based on the rational calculation of "equal punishment for equal crime". Mill took the view that human beings are also motivated by such internal sanctions as self esteem, guilt, and conscience. He also argued, from a Kantian categorical imperative, that "we ought to shape our conduct by a rule which all rational beings might adopt with benefit to their collective interest" (Mill 1960: 49). One needs to remember, however, that justice is, by definition, social. The shift in meaning occurs when the term "social" no longer describes the</page><page sequence="3">Introduction 11 product of the virtuous actions of many individuals, but rather the Utopian goal toward which all institutions and all individuals are "made in the ut? most degree to converge" by coercion: In that case, the qualifier "social" in the term "social justice" refers to something that emerges not organically and spontaneously from the rule-abiding behaviour of free individuals, but rather from an abstract ideal imposed from above (Novak 2000). One of the key factors in achieving social justice, however, is the emergence of a con? sensus that society is working in a fair way, where individuals are allowed as much freedom as possible given the role they have within the society. Hence, true social justice is attained only through the harmonious cooperative effort of the citizens who, in their own self-interest, accept the current norms of morality as the price of membership in the community. In recent years, the concept of social justice has been associated with the moral and political philosopher John Rawls, particularly as developed in his works A Theory of SocialJustice (1971) and Political Liberalism (1993). Rawls draws on the utilitarian principles of Bentham and Mill, the social-contract ideas of Locke, and the categorical imperative of Kant. His reference to social justice in A Theory of Justice (1971: 3) proposes that "Each person possesses an inviolability founded on justice that even the welfare of society as a whole cannot override. For this reason justice denies that the loss of freedom for some is made right by a greater good shared by others." Social justice, as de? fined by Rawls, is an abstraction which is humanistic in essence. As Maxine Greene (1998) has noted regarding Rawls' conception of social justice, although the latter follows in the Kantian tradition of moral reason, his view of justice is "not necessarily universal, nor does it reflect some high? er order" (Greene 1998: xxxv). While Greene finds Rawls' theory of "justice providing a regulative framework for what individuals think and do in a free society" laudable (p. xxxvi), she cautions that Rawls has in mind a self determining citizen as an individual, not necessarily as a participant member of society (p. xxxvi). For Greene, community and its responsible interactions are the key. For this reason she finds that J?rgen Habermas (1979) has pro? vided a more promising alternative for educating for justice in his theory of "communicative democracy", whereby members of a community come together voluntarily to discuss matters of significance and must justify their preferences through arguments, explanations, and different modes of persua? sion (p. xxxvii). Greene also reminds us (p. xxxviii) that when the require? ments for justice are addressed, distinctions have to be made: "Equitable or fair treatment ... does not mean equal treatment - certainly when that means treating people with widely disparate needs in the same way." When Maxine Greene speaks about social justice, and more specifically about ways we can teach for social justice, she embraces that interpretation of social justice that is concerned with basic human rights that all people are entitled to, regard? less of conditions of economic disparity or of class, gender, race, ethnicity, citizenship, religion, age, sexual orientation, disability or health. She advo? cates that teachers become activists in raising their students' consciousness</page><page sequence="4">12 Joseph Zajda, Suzanne Majhanovich and Val Rust (? la Freirean "conscientisation" of 1970) of conditions of oppression and ways to work for the eradication of injustices and disparities in society. She exhorts teachers of conscience to take up this challenge (p. xlv): To teach for social justice is to teach for enhanced perception and imaginative explorations, for the recognition of social wrongs, of sufferings, of pestilences wherever and whenever they arise. It is to find models in literature and in history of the indignant ones who have taken the side of the victims of pestilences, what? ever their names or places of origin. It is to teach so that the young may be awak? ened to the joy of working for transformation in the smallest places, so that they may become healers and change their worlds. In presenting this notion of social justice and recommending ways to bring about positive social change, Greene is clearly endorsing an articulation of the concept as it is understood by those who stand on the left of the politi? cal spectrum. Her understanding of the concept parallels the work of such critical theorists of Levin, Carnoy, Torres, Giroux and Apple, among others. Of course, people of other political persuasions have also claimed social jus? tice as an ideal to be sought after, but in their interpretation, social justice will be realized by the individual efforts of free citizens to "exercise self government by doing for themselves, and without turning to government, what needs to be done" (Novak 2000). Such interpretations reject any no? tions of a social safety net for the disadvantaged, or social contracts where those privileged with power and means voluntarily support those in need, or government regulations to bring about a gradual end to inequalities and dis? parities. For people of this political standpoint, such actions would be con? sidered as misguided efforts in social engineering. Naturally, this group would support the free-market economy, deregulation and privatization. On the surface, the need for social justice in the world is self-evident. But we must explore the questions that John Rawls asked: "What makes a soci? ety just? How is social justice connected to an individual's pursuit of the good life?" (Nussbaum 2001). Is social justice simply achieved through the moral acts of autonomous citizens in a free society who of their own volition and with good will and by consensus meet the ethical obligations of their community? But what if the moral norms of the society include reprehensi? ble practices? What then are the responsibilities of citizens with regard to norms of morality of their community when the norms contravene basic hu? man rights? In a just society the citizens understand that results of their acts are incumbent not only on themselves but are universally applicable. Social justice as an ideal construct The word "social" distinguishes "social justice" from the concept of justice as applied in the law, and from more informal concepts of justice embedded</page><page sequence="5">Introduction 13 in systems of public policy and morality, which differ from culture to culture and therefore lack a global dimension. "Social justice" refers to the overall fairness of a society in its divisions and distributions of rewards and bur? dens. Friedrich Hayek points out a major defect of 20th-century theories of social justice (see Novak 2000). Most authors assert that they use it to desig? nate a virtue (a moral virtue). But most of their descriptions ascribed to so? cial justice refer to impersonal states of affairs - "high unemployment" or "inequality of incomes" or "lack of a living wage" are often cited as in? stances of "social injustice". Hayek argues that social justice is either a vir? tue or it is not (Novak 2000): If it is, it can properly be ascribed only to the reflective and deliberate acts of individual persons. Some scholars who use the term, however, ascribe it not to individuals but to social systems. They use "social justice" to denote a regulative principle of order, especially the redistribution of wealth, income and power. Their focus is not virtue but political economy and power (Novak 2000). The nexus between social justice and education indicates the problematic relationship between society and the state, as seen against the background of comparative education research. Social justice as a construct is an attempt to answer the following question: How can we contribute to the creation of a more equitable, respectful, and just society for everyone? There are at least three conceptual and methodological issues that are relevant to current dis? courses of education and social justice. Firstly, there exists an assumption that the term "social justice" has a monocultural and linear definition. However, the term "social justice" is a multi-layered ideal construct and refers to a contested and contentious con? cept (Troyna andVincent 1995). Sharon Gewirtz (1998: 469), for instance, found "very little explicit discussion of what social justice means or ought to mean". Similarly, Fazal Rizvi (1998: 47) has noted a semantic ambiguity concerning social justice: ... the immediate difficulty one confronts when examining the idea of social justice is the fact that it does not have a single essential meaning - it is embedded within discourses that are historically constituted and that are sites of conflicting and divergent political endeavours. Others have expressed concerns that that some terms commonly used as syn? onyms for the term "social justice" are in fact "dangerous" (Dunkwu and Griffiths 2001: 11) because they could denote a monocultural or other limit? ing position, rather than connotate the contested and competing interpreta? tions of the term in a culturally and ideologically diverse world. Secondly, it is assumed, as one of the many taken-for-granted assumptions, that social justice is attainable in any society, and at any time. Glenn Rikowski (2000), however, argues that social justice cannot exist in a capitalist society: Social justice is a latent social form within capitalist society that cannot attain real existence. As sustainable social justice is impossible on the basis of capitalist social</page><page sequence="6">14 Joseph Zajda, Suzanne Majhanovich and Val Rust forms, the drive to create social justice in capitalist society fired by the anger of shocking social inequality - pushes at the boundaries of capitalist social relations, and against the limits of capital itself. The struggle for social justice in capitalist society is, therefore, an aspect of a struggle for a form of life where social justice is possible. Thirdly, there is an ambivalent nexus between the state, social stratification and social justice. The greater the social inequality, the less one finds social justice. The unequal distribution of economic, social, and political capital is likely to make it difficult for pedagogues to address differences and oppres? sions in schools and society globally. Social justice and inequality Despite the seemingly egalitarian spirit of the reformers and policy-makers promoting social justice, and in view of the market forces dictating privatisa? tion and marketisation in education and society, ambivalent legacies of the past and unresolved critical education and policy issues continue, by and large, to remain the same, and are "still on the policy agenda" (Zajda 2002: 87). They include, among other things, the "stubborn issue of inequality" (Coombs 1982: 153), first examined in a comparative context in 1957 by Kandel (1957: 2) with reference to schooling in the West. Similarly Carnoy argues that while decentralisation and school autonomy may result in some educational improvement, decentralisation reforms tended to increase inequality in educational performance between "the poorer states (municipal? ities) and the richer ones" (1999: 55-56). Privatisation, decentralisation and marketisation in education and society have a direct impact on the imple? mentation of the principles of social justice in schools. However, as Zajda (2005: 18) has argued elsewhere: ... the principle of providing quality education for all, in view of the presently wid? ening gap of wealth, power, income, SES disadvantage and inequity between the rich and the poor locally and globally continues to remain a myth. To solve the inequalities requires an ideological and radical policy shift in current models of governance, and an authentic and equal partnership between the state, multi? national corporations, policy-makers and educators, all working together towards the eradication of inequality and poverty locally and globally - for the common good of humanity. Some critics (Weiler and Maher 2002) argue that social justice is difficult to achieve in a society where social inequality debate is dormant: ... examples of transformative pedagogy, the need to respect and encourage the voi? ces of students, curriculum which critiques popular culture and analyzes social inequality are invaluable to prospective teachers. Moreover, progressive programs educating prospective teachers need to include both models of progressive peda? gogy and curriculum and courses exploring the historical and contemporary politics</page><page sequence="7">Introduction 15 of education, to give prospective teachers tools of analysis and action. On the other hand, calls for liberatory teaching can appear to ring hollow notes in underfunded and inequitable public schools, where knowledge and teaching practices are increas? ingly standardized and monitored through high stakes testing. The creation of an egalitarian and just society for everyone is a dream for all empowering and egalitarian pedagogues. But it will remain a dream, and mere hollow rhetoric, or magic words in policy, unless we debate more vig? orously social inequality in the global culture. We also need to act, not just talk. We need to critique vigorously the status quo of stratified school systems. We need to focus our debate on the "dialectic of the global and the local and the unequal distribution of socially valued commodities" (Zajda 2005: 18). Weiler and Maher (2002) argue that inequalities in education together with privatisation and marketisation have a profound effect on social justice: As numerous educational researchers have documented, existing schools are pro? foundly unequal, stratified by race and class, and increasingly driven by the stan? dardized testing of students and teachers and the deskilling of teachers through the introduction of packaged curricula geared to standardized tests. The "marketi? sation" of education is dominant at both the federal and state levels, with free market educators calling for the privatization of schooling through a variety of means - vouchers, for-profit charter schools, the commercialization of school spaces and forced dependence on advertising. Social justice as a social policy is the natural aspiration of all democratic societies and remains the only long-term guarantee for developing and sus? taining peace, tolerance and harmony in the world. The XII World Congress of Comparative Education Societies The papers presented at the XII World Congress of Comparative Educa? tion, held in Havana in October 2004, wholeheartedly embraced the task of uncovering injustice where it exists and recommending ways to remedy the problems and strive for the betterment of humanity - especially its dis advantaged and suffering masses. The preparations for the Congress were in a sense an exercise in social-justice education in action. Prior to the Congress, mini-conferences were held in the various Cuban states, and the best papers were chosen to be presented at the main meeting. The thematic groups featured studies and commentaries on issues closely related to the pursuit of social justice. Let us look at some highlights from the inaugural address given by the Minister of Education of the Republic of Cuba, Luis G?mez Guti?rrez. He opened his speech by reminding delegates of the appalling conditions that disadvantaged people around the world live in to? day. He focused on illiteracy and the plight of children (G?mez Gutierrez 2004: 3):</page><page sequence="8">16 Joseph Zajda, Suzanne Majhanovich and Val Rust Despite the commitments made by many nations to provide education for all, illit? eracy continues to rise, forcing over 860 million adults to live in utter ignorance, while 120 million children - that is to say, one in every five school-age children - do not attend primary school. According to UNICEF this problem, which should shame a society living in the 21st century, will not be resolved until 2100 ... This, however, isn't the only problem that affects our youngsters. Every year 11 million children die from diseases that could have been prevented or cured. Over 200 mil? lion girls and boys work and millions more are sexually exploited. G?mez Guti?rrez decried the fact that while billions of dollars are spent on defence every year, wealthy first-world countries have chosen not to donate the modest sum of US$ 10 million per year that would ensure availability of education for all in the neediest countries. He also warned delegates of the catastrophic future for the world as the consumer societies continue to squander the world's natural resources. Along with the efforts undertaken in Cuba to provide access to education for all, G?mez Guti?rrez (p. 5) also dis? cussed those to prepare teachers to serve in remote areas of the country and how the people have drawn inspiration from their national hero Jos? Mart?: Our national hero, Jos? Mart?, set us a precedent when he taught us "social equal? ity is impossible without equality of culture". So providing free education to all isn't enough, we must also make sure that the same possibilities are open to all children born in Cuba and that they all receive the same standard of education which may then be developed by each child according to his or her own abilities. He gave details of programs in Cuba delivering preschool education, primary and secondary education, education for those with special needs, and upper middle education, or the stage at which students study for a diploma that will lead to entrance to university or a professional and technical education insti? tute. He also outlined an educational reform in Cuba that is designed to pro? vide access to higher education for anyone who desires it (p. 10): All Cuban citizens [have] the right to study for a degree in their own municipality at no personal cost. The university has expanded from its traditional confines and now has branches in every area in need, even in the countryside and mountainous area ... Cuba is becoming one big university. He also discussed some of the education and literacy projects that Cuba has engaged in around the world: All of these ideas, all of these transformations, every breakthrough we make in education are all linked to Marti's concept that "homeland is humanity" and to the solidarity and internationalism that are longstanding in our country. There? fore, we in Cuba repeat that we are more than willing to share our experiences. Very effective methods have been designed by Cuban educators to firstly teach students how to read and write and then to achieve a basic education using radio and television as teaching aids. The selfless involvement of Cuban specialists in projects in Haiti, Nicaragua, New Zealand, Guinea-Bissau, Mexico, Mozambique, Guatemala, Venezuela, Belize and Argentina has produced significant results.</page><page sequence="9">Introduction 17 G?mez Guti?rrez continued his address with the challenge to the delegates to demonstrate their commitment to education and to profit from the oppor? tunity afforded them at such a gathering to exchange ideas that might facili? tate the development of appropriate educational systems for each country: Whatever our philosophical ideas and opinions, we are all united in our commit? ment to education, this is a battle for love and hope that every single person should fight for with whatever weapons they have. Thankfully it is impossible to mechanically copy an education system or transfer it from one country to another, and there is no unique system. We believe that if all of us gathered here today were to learn from one another by sharing our diverse experiences and adapting them to our own situations we could find the key to a successful education system for each country. Or to use the words of Jos? Mart?: "let the world be grafted onto our republics, but the trunk must be our own." G?mez Guti?rrez concluded his address with a quotation from Fidel Castro Ruz in which the latter calls upon Cubans to develop an educational system that reflects an equitable and just society (p. 12): Today we are seeking what should be and will be, in our judgment, an educa? tional system that increasingly corresponds to the equality, full justice, self-esteem and moral and social needs of all people in the type of society that Cubans have decided to build. This address and other plenary speakers set the tone for the XII World Con? gress, and reflected the aspirations for social justice around the world held by the congress participants. The present special issue The articles in this special issue of the International Review of Education are revised versions of papers presented at the XII World Congress of Compara? tive Education on the theme "Education and Social Justice". Elvira Martin Sabina's Foreword provides an informative background look at the Congress and shows how the papers presented reflected the on-going dynamics of comparative education. Some of these paradigmatic shifts have been evident in the policy work of the World Council of Comparative Education Societies (WCCES), an umbrella body which currently includes 34 comparative educa? tion societies. The most visible activities of the WCCES since its creation in 1970 have been a series of high-profile World Congresses of Comparative Education. The WCCES also promotes research programmes involving scholars in various countries. Currently, joint research programmes focus on: theory and methods in comparative education, education of women and girls, teacher education, education for peace and justice, and other topics. At this international congress with close to 1,000 delegates presenting in 14 thematic groups and three special symposia, along with invited keynote</page><page sequence="10">18 Joseph Zajda, Suzanne Majhanovich and Val Rust addresses, there were numerous worthy scholarly papers and studies to choose from when compiling this collection. Indeed, those articles that are included represent but a small fragment of the scholarly papers presented during the conference. This special issue analyses and critiques the overall interplay between edu? cation, social justice and the state. The articles draw upon recent studies in the areas of education and social justice. By referring to the call of Bourdieu and Passeron (1990) for critical policy analysts to engage in a "critical soci? ology" of their own contexts of practice, and poststructuralist and postmod? ernist pedagogy, the present collection examines the way central discourses surrounding the debate of education and social justice are formed in the contexts of dominant ideology, power, and culturally and historically derived perceptions and practices. The articles that follow in this special issue critically evaluate some of these topics and their future implications for both policy-makers and educa? tors. They suggest policy solutions in resolving some of the paradoxes and dilemmas of the problematic and ambivalent relationship between the state, democracy, social justice and the market forces of globalization. Karen Mundy in "Education for All and the New Development Com? pact", attempting to explain the somewhat misleading rhetoric of "education for all", looks critically at the evolution of an "education for all" consensus within the international community, redistributive forms of multilateralism, and a global public good. Kassie Freeman in "If Only My Eyes Were Differ? ent: The Loss of Identity and the Under-utilization of Black Children's Edu? cational Potential - Rethinking Assimilation and Social Justice" explores the formation of social identity in the United States, the social, economic and educational problems experienced by the Black American children, social inequality, and implications for social justice. In "Freedom's Children: a Gender Perspective on the Education of the Learner Citizen", Madeleine Arnot focuses on the 'learner as citizen' who, through citizenship education courses, is prepared often for a gender-divided world - even though the pro? cesses of individualisation have significantly reshaped contemporary gender relations. She discusses the implications for democracy and social justice. Jennifer Chan-Tibergien in "Cultural Diversity as Resistance to Neoliberal Globalization: The Emergence of a Global Movement and Convention" con? siders the globalising processes of commodification, arguing that neo-liberal policy discourses in education define and shape dominant patterns in cul? tural diversity. She maintains that cultural diversity in the global culture merely serves to re-assert the cultural hegemony of the North. Dominique Groux in "L'apprentissage pr?coce des langues: des pratiques sociologiquement et politiquement marqu?es" contrasts the various forms of language training of certain countries and within countries. She evaluates the correlation between bilingual training and private schools, and the choice of bilingual education as a political and economic goal, and suggests that cur? ricula may be culturally discriminatory. The latter has implications for social</page><page sequence="11">Introduction 19 justice in education and society. Macleans A. Geo-JaJa in "Educational Decentralization, Public Spending, and Social Justice in Nigeria" critiques the process of decentralisation and privatisation in Nigeria. By reviewing the impact of decentralisation and privatisation on education, he shows that they have not led to desired outcomes, such as equity and social justice. W. James Jacob in "Social Justice, and Gender in Chinese Higher Educa? tion: Regional Issues of Equity and Access" provides an analysis of the con? temporary history of the gender gap in education generally and higher education specifically. He examines issues related to the ethnic boundaries that exist in higher education and suggests that social justice issues of equity and access need to be resolved. Clara Lig Long Rangel and Antonia Zenaida S?nchez Proenza in "Cuba's University for Seniors: A Look at the Universalization of the University" fo? cus on the new programme of university studies for adults, looking specifi? cally at the Special Municipality of the Isle of Youth against the backdrop of the larger policy of universalization of higher education. The authors pro? vide useful information about Cuban perspectives of adult education, and discuss the "workshop" as an important mode of educational work. They also comment on students' evaluations of the programme. Regina Moromiz ato Izu in "Quality and Equity in Early Childhood Care in Peru" discusses policy documents and programmes of the early childhood education in Peru. She presents various conceptual models and data and concludes that most programmes are successful. Finally, in her WCCES Presidential Address "Integrating Cultural Com? plexity, Postcolonial Perspectives, and Educational Change: Challenges for Comparative Educators", Anne Hickling-Hudson, in examining global cur? rents of colonialism, decolonisation and postcolonialism affecting education and society, uses some of her personal insights into the postcolonial condi? tion to reflect on comparative education. She argues that socialisation in neo-colonial ideas of race is still hegemonic, and that understanding how this works will help comparative educators to carry out critical studies of how education can be changed to provide social justice. By focusing on social justice globally, there can be seen on the whole an attempt to answer one of the most pressing global questions: Are social, eco? nomic and cultural divisions between the nations, between school sectors, between schools and between student numbers growing or declining? The au? thors represented here consider and examine current discourses surrounding social justice, education and social stratification. There is a lack of emphasis in comparative education research on the relationship between poverty and education and the "withdrawal of the state as a major provider in the field of education in many parts of the world" (Soudien and Kallaway 1999: 378). This has serious implications for global discourses surrounding democracy, human rights and social justice. What are the implications for democracy, and social justice of the policy shift away from "the social democratic vision of education that was characteristic of the 1960s and 1970s?" (Soudien and</page><page sequence="12">20 Joseph Zajda, Suzanne Majhanovich and Val Rust Kallaway 1999: 378). By examining the competing discourses of education and social justice, this special issue of the International Review of Education attempts to evaluate critically both the reasons and outcomes of education reforms and policy change with respect to social justice, thus providing a more informed critique on the Western-driven models of social justice, democracy and equality in education.
