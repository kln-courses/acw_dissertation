INTRODUCTION: THE ZNAGA AND THE GIBLA The gibla, the south-west of Mauritania, is a monotonous region of gum acacia trees, baobabs, 'dead' dunes, and hillocks. This 'backwood' is the last refuge of Znaga Berber, once spoken far to the north in whole regions of the Western Sahara. A number of short poems, a cycle of folk-tales, and a handful of masterpieces of extended odes in praise of the Prophet-some 200 years old and written in Arabic script--this is the meagre literary legacy of a proud and cherished tradition. To-day there is little to distinguish the Moors who still speak Znaga from those who do not. Names, both Arab and Berber, are common to their respective genealogies. Many of the place-names they all know, the names of the plants they collect, and their social conventions are Znaga. Their institu- tions are fundamentally Berber. Yet, despite this common inheritance, despite the mutually feverish concern to master the forms and content of Arabic syntax and literature, systematized and composed a thousand years ago and thousands of miles distant, these southern Znaga Zwaya have a peculiar tradition; they are a peculiar people, as 'gold dust is to clay', and as 'the right hand is to the left '. Five of these tribes, the Tashumsha,' were to play the principal part in the diffusion of scholarship in the south. They claimed to have arrived in the Sahara in the fourteenth century and to have emigrated from Tarudint in southern Morocco. They openly acknowledged the fact that they were Berbers, and their names clearly indicated this, but like all other wandering tribes in the Western Sahara they were impelled to establish familial links with the Companions of the Prophet and with leaders of the murabit.7n. One of their scholars, Sid Ah.mad wuld Asmuhu, alleged in a lineage that not only was their ancestor the Caliph Abf Bakr al-Siddlq but that another ancestor in their family tree was a certain 'Isa al-Lamtfni. The claim was to have important con- sequences. Not only did the Saharan tribes concede that at least one of the branches of the Banft Dayman-one of the most respected tribes of the 1 A myth common in Mauritania traces these five tribes to a league or band of robbers who alighted near to a camp of the Midlish Zwaya. One of the robbers was sent by his comrades to spy out the camp, and he heard a reciter of the Qur'An repeating its contents. The robber, intrigued by its sound, memorized what he had heard and repeated it to his companions on his return, deeming it to be an exceptionally fine example of popular folk-song (ghin6'). His comrades, fully aware of its true meaning were smitten with remorse, repented of their ways, and joined the Midlish as clients.</page><page sequence="2">ZNAGA ISLAM DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 497 Tashumsha confederation-the Idakfiji, was linked to the Bdfikal Sanhaja, but that there was no doubt that some at least of the ancestors of all the Banfi Dayman stemmed from the Lamtfina. The first of the Tashumsha elders to emigrate south-westwards was Idabyaj Ya'qfib, the ancestor of the Idachfagha. He came to Abbwayr 2 but he found the whole Adrar to be too unsettled a place to pursue his scholastic calling in peace and in tranquillity. One day he left it, accompanied by his sister and his wife. He had only a she-ass to carry them both and his precious books, but owing to divine intervention he encountered a kneeling elephant at a short distance from Abbwayr. This obedient animal bore them to the Midlish (Majlis al-'ilm) who pastured in the Tris. Close relations were established, Idabyaj Ya'qfitb married among them, and tribal links were to continue long after his descendants moved southwards into the gibla. Another Tashumsha patriarch, Muhund Amghar 3 who lived in the fifteenth century, also emigrated southwards, and he was to found the most famous of all the Znaga 'holy families ', the Banfi Dayman, named after al-Fagha (faqIh) iddayman, the grandson of Mitsa b. Muhund Amghar. Al-Fagha Mfisa who died about 1500 was a miraculous child. He exclaimed aloud the name of Malik b. Anas, the founder of the Maliki madhhab, the very moment he was born, and he learnt much from his mother who was both learned and devout. She came from an ancient Moroccan tribe called the Id Kashghadha. Not only was her memory of the Qur'an so exact that she was called 'the ninth copy' of the sacred text in her household, but her very presence in it was a happy omen since it was believed that a family which contained a member of this tribe would never be struck by a meteor, a very evil omen, and that the place where they resided would never suffer wrath. 2 Daymini tradition dates the sojourn of the Tashumsha in Abbwayr to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Shinqiti certainly existed in the fifteenth century since the representative in Timbuctou of the Sultan Akil, Muhammad Nadda, came from this town, and he held office prior to 1433 during the dynasty of Mlli. Abbwayr (Timengassen), 'Old Shinqiti' was allegedly founded prior to modern Shinqiti. It was regarded as the cradle of many Zwhya tribes which later migrated to the south-west. European accounts seem to confirm that these two settlements existed side by side before Abbwayr disappeared from history. In a letter sent from Arguin to Lisbon in 1591 by Melchior Petoney several towns in the Adrdr are referred to : ' One city there is called Couton, another Xanigeton, as also the cities of Tubguer, Azegue, Amader, Quaherque, and the town of Faroo'. The region is described as rich in well-built towns, cattle, barley, dates, and gold. The following tentative identification may be made : Couton is Widin, Xanigeton is Shinqiti, Tubguer is (T)Abbwayr, Azegue is Aziigi near At.r, Amader is Amdayr al-Kabir and al-Saghir, both a day and half from Shinqiti in the direction of At.r. Quaherque is just possibly Asharayrig in the Adrdr, a spring adjoining a mountain where the tomb of the scholar Ahmad b. al-Baahir b. al-H.anshi al-Ghall~wi is located. Faroo is hard to identify. Muh.ammad wuld Mawlid wuld DJddih has proposed Ferenni. Cf. H. de Castries, Les sources inddites de l'histoire du Maroc, II, Paris and London, 1925, 45. 3 The root mghr in Zniga and Tuareg is synonomous with that of the Arabic title of Shaykh. This signifies a man of the age of about 60 and over, and therefore respected for his age. It also denotes male ascendant (paternal uncle or the man who has married the mother after the death of the father), and master of servants, teacher of pupils, chief in general terms or the power which wields authority.</page><page sequence="3">498 HI. T. NORRIS At this time the gibla of Mauritania became a 'holy land' of Berber scholars, their dependants, and their clients. Although Znaga Berber was the popular tongue and their kinship revealed many of the characteristic features of a 'Tuareg' matrilineal system, Classical Arabic works on many subjects were studied and cherished even if the grammar books and standard texts were few. At the same time wells were dug, primitive mosques were built, herds of cattle were raised, and the 'holy families' often settled in specific localities. The tombs of chiefs became religious sanctuaries, and their Islamic character seemed in no way to conflict with pagan Berber beliefs, particularly the ancient tree and serpent cults of the negroes and the Gudala Sanhaja, whose pasture lands once included these remote localities. Muhund, one of the three sons of Iddayman, died about 1600. He was buried at Ra's al-Kalb. The association with dogs offended some, and the name of the district was later changed, but the burial spot itself (Kathib Tigigt 'Dune of the Lady Minstrel') w.s retained, and the pious saw nothing profane in associating the holy man with a nameless singer of the musician class, already a social group at this quite early date. After his death a tree grew upon his tomb. There was no other tree like it in that locality. Its branches bore leaves of different colours. Some were green, others yellow and deep red, while a few were as white as snow or jet black in their hue. Some were multi-coloured. A type of mange, a sore, or a similar ailment, had only to be rubbed with them, and a cure was immediate and instantaneous. The tree was guarded by a great snake which hung on its branches. It prevented the plucking of leaves unless by the hand of the descendants of Muhund b. ITddayman, the occupant of the tomb beneath. The guardian snake was the servant of the holy man and was associated with the tree.4 Serpents and snakes were sometimes part of the body of Zwaya holy men. Sidi Muhammad al-H.anshi al-Tishiti (d. 1769) was a snake beneath his navel. The discovery of this secret by his sister led to his hasty departure from Tishit and his subsequent sojourn in Tirenni in the H.awd. Thus the evils of nature were both tamed and used to further the will of the Almighty in the life of His chosen Muslim community. In the seventeenth century the Tashumsha and other Zwaya tribes in this region were protected by more powerful 'Arab' or 'Arab-Berber' tribes such as the Awlad Rizg, the Awlad Mubarak, and after the battle of In Titam in 1630 by the dominant HIassani Banf Maghfar who were permanently to establish their supremacy as warrior princes. This protection involved a reduction in status and the payment of a ghardma, a form of collective tribute. The Zniga tribes found this tribute a heavy burden. Often their protectors were quite incapable of defending them, and as their way of life was pacific and contempla- tive, the increasing insecurity disrupted their studies and their commercial and pastoral pursuits. Many scholars sought a communal life, not in a ribat or a Scf.

Many of the latter were not ' Arabs' at all. The Tashumsha in particular suffered humiliations not only from Arab Ma'qil groups but also from Zniga tribes which disregarded a religious vocation, tribes such as the Khbabsha, the 'Azizat, the Ma'qil Barabish, and the Anbat Znaga who claimed kinship ties with the Lamtfina through Yahya b. 'Umar, the brother of Abfi Bakr b. 'Umar al-Lamtiini. The Tashumsha had many holy men at this time who championed Islam and defended pacific God-fearing tribes, Znaga speakers in particular. Saints such as Aba Zayd of the Idaygub and his cousin Baba Ahmad al-Daymani provided food or rain when either was scarce, punished offenders by long- distance guidance of meteors and magic spells, and undertook swift journeys on holy donkeys and on flying sticks. Baba Ahmad was honoured by the Maglfar 'Arab' clan of Ahimad b. Daman. It is said that Portendick (Injil) near to Nouakchott was founded after the conclusion of a treaty between Ahmad b. Daman and a European, possibly a Portuguese called Rodrigo or Rodrigues. The latter had written to the Arab prince asking for a trading agreement, and it was Baba Alhmad who read and translated the proposal to this prince. As a reward the latter gave Baba Ahmad a portion of the dues (amkibal or kharij) exacted on trading vessels, and this privilege was enjoyed by his descendants. Aba Zayd, it is said, also undertook a mission to the Europeans on behalf of Zannfin b. Daman. He was unjustly imprisoned by the infidels but he escaped supernaturally, and his oppressors let him depart in peace with his servant, and a gift of a honey-skin, tent-posts, and a pair of shears. Other saints experienced 'out of the body' states, sometimes during periods of suffering and distress. Thus Muhund b. Ahmad, 'the companion of the Prophet', who was greatly respected by the Hassani prince Bakkar b. 'Ali al-Brakni, was gravely injured by a fall from his camel. During his con- valescence he performed the pilgrimage to Mecca 'in the spirit' despite a torrential thunderstorm. Another saint, Barekallah b. Ya'qiib, cured the stricken body of his favourite cow, Tunmu'du 'Woman Blacksmith ', by reciting verses from the Burda of al-Biisiri. The grandson of Barekallah, Sid al-Amin, called Shiddak, was kept alive by salt loaded on his donkey train. This salt provided him with all the food and drink he needed. Sidi 'l-Fa4il (Fal) b. Muhund b. Iddayman was a friend of Aba Zayd but this did not prevent him taking exception to the latter's use of a meteor to avenge the accidental death of his dearest son. The former saint plunged the meteor in the sea or in the Senegal river, and Aba Zayd, aware that he had perhaps on this occasion exceeded his saintly powers, later confessed to him that had he not extinguished it all the innocent people of the region would have burnt. Aba Zayd was a</page><page sequence="5">500 H. T. NORRIS religious adviser to the Maglhfar ' Arabs' of the Trarza, and Sidi 'l-F.dil fulfilled a somewhat similar role. The sons of Ah.mad b. Daman gave him a camel since their father had observed that saints of comparable status had been highly honoured by the Brakna ' Arabs ', and it was a matter of honour to show him a respect at least equal to that accorded to others by their Trarza cousins. Despite tribal animosities and personal rivalries relations between the Zwaya Tashumsha and the princely 'Arab' families were on the whole cordial. At least the traditions which survive in no way indicate a bitter hatred. And yet, in a short time, the whole of the gibla was to be plunged into chaos by a dynamic Tashumsha Zwaya personality and Islamic idealist, Nasir al-Din. A prolonged war was to upset the ancient modus vivendi, and the embittered Zawi, Sidi 'l-Fadil, was to condemn his patrons in the harshest of terms: 'I hate the Banfl Ma~hfar (" Arabs ") since they will slay my sons. There is no escaping a most evil day which will befall them'. The war of Shurbubba (1055-85/1645-75 ?) was unprecedented.5 At its conclusion the Banil Maghfar princes of the Trarza were undisputed masters, and the Tashumsha, like other Zwaya, were compelled to submit to a gharama and to other humiliating conditions, and most important of all, their uncon- ditional religious services. To the outside observer the situation north of the Senegal river seemed to be little different from the prevailing tribal patterns, many centuries old. Notwithstanding slaughter and dispersion, the Zwaya still actively pursued their religious vocation. They continued to speak the Znaga tongue, and they employed it as a literary language in Arabic script. Sabbar b. Baba Ahmad, who was a contemporary of the noted Oriental scholar Niir al-Din Abu 'l-Irshad 'Ali b. Ah.mad b. 'Abd al-Rahmin al-Ujhiiri (d. 1656), was regarded by some of the Zwaya as at least the equal of the latter in his scholastic attainments. Furthermore he was credited with miracles, two of which were praised in Znaga verse. The saint restored the sight of a man who had lost an eye, and he repaired a rent butter-skin by the touch of his hand. These acts were recorded and perpetuated in a Znaga poem of two verses composed by AhImad b. Aghlaydit al-Thmaglwi.6 5 Shurbubba appears to have been a war cry, and although the name Sharr Bubba also denotes this war, there is disagreement as to which of the two is the more accurate. A sharr among the Tuareg indicates a war between tribal factions and peoples while a simple raid for booty (ghazw) is known as an annemensi or amdjer (H. Lhote, Les Touaregs du Hoggar, Paris, 1944, 321). Shurbubba embraced both types of warfare. The Moors distinguish between a jihad 'holy war ' and a sharr, a war without religious significance. It seems clear that during its course Shurbubba had some of the features of both, although most Zwaya regard it as primarily a religious war. This emphasis may account for the scepticism which associates it with an ethnic conflict sparked off by a tributary called Bubba. 6 Mukhtir wuld HI.midun has provided the following Arabic rendering of this poem : .~.~ L, -LG JA j</page><page sequence="6">ZNAGA ISLAM DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 501 .LL ~L~ Cl 41 $1 (tSY 4- i 3 CP l iiyl$ c? Across the Senegal river where the Wolof states had suffered the military might of Nasir al-Din and his Zwaya fanatics, the war of Shurbubba was by no means forgotten. In 1686, the French traveller La Courbe described Shamama (the cultivated banks of the Senegal river) and its people, the Zwaya Idaw al-Hajj and the triumphant ruling family of the Trarza Bani Maghfar only 10 years after the war had ended. The negroes had by then regained their freedom from the Moors, although their herds of cattle were depleted because of' great wars against the Moors who had ruined all the country'. These wars had come about because certain Moors had preached Islam, and notwithstanding the fact that their religious pre-eminence had been acknowledged, had wished to further dominate the local Wolof peoples. They had persuaded the latter to revolt against their own kings in order to set up a' kind of Republic '. They had made the negroes believe that by religious power and by prayer they could make their millet grow without sowing, and that they would need to toil no longer. As the people disliked manual work they were initially persuaded to help the Moors who fought the kings of Brac (Burigrig) and Damel, who died in battle, and also Bourguyolof (Bur-Jolof) who, after his defeat, had been forced to flee for his life. When the following year no millet appeared, and the people were compelled to eat their cattle to live, they elected other kings who regained their independence, and at length drove the Moors back across the Senegal river.7 2. MUHAMMAD AL-YADALLi The Zwaya epic of Shurbubba, as told and interpreted by the Moors, is the composition of one man, a saint and poet and one of the supreme scholars of the Tashumsha Zwaya, Shaykh Muh. ammad (Muhammadh) b. al-Mukhtar b. Muh.ammad Sa'id al-YadalI (Yadaji) al-Daymani (d. 1166/1753). His father al-Mukhtar had fought during the war of Shurbubba in the Zwaya cause. Al-Mukhtar's wife had been taken captive with other Zwaya womenfolk who had been unable to escape because they had no camels. He resolved to find his wife and somehow rescue her : ' I will return to my wife to bring her away, perchance God through her will favour me with a pious son'. He managed to escape with her, carrying her pick-a-back, putting her down every now and then to rest, until she arrived in his camp. She bore him Muhammad al-Yadali. He grew up to be a man of average to tall build. He was fine-featured, white- skinned, and he was shy and avoided looking others in the face. He possessed a pipe but nobody ever saw him smoke it. When still a youth he once came to one of his teachers whose special task was to teach him baydn (rhetoric). After studying two sections of it he left his teacher's assembly and did not return. Then after several days his master received a composition on rhetoric, and when 7 Premier voyage de Sieur de La Courbe fait i la coste d'Afrique en 1685, ed. P. Cultru, Paris, 1913, 132, 133, 146.</page><page sequence="7">502 H. T. NORRIS he inquired which student had written the remarkable text he was told that Muhammad al-Yadall was its author. Muhammad al-Yadali revealed his genius in miracles and in literary works. Both are equally important in Zwaya eyes, since no scholar of the first rank was worthy of his vocation unless his sanctity was great enough to establish a cycle of miracles as well as his learning wide enough to compose a corpus of texts. The biographer of Muh1ammad al-Yada1l, al-Nabigha al-Ghallawl, in his book al-Najm al-thiqib fi ba'd ma li 'l-Yadilr min al-mandqib (according to the copy by Sid Ahmad wuld Asmuhu) supplies an ample dossier on the miraculous facts of the man he so admired. Some examples follow. 'One day al-Yadall was walking with one of the people when suddenly a savage dog set upon them. Al-Yadall pointed his index finger at it, and it perished. Once he travelled mounted with some people making for Igidi from Akshar. The two of them left the camp leading their camel to ride away on it. While they were walking and chatting, lo, they had finished their journey and had reached Tgidi and had traversed a week's distance in that single hour.' '(Al-Nabigha) said, on the authority of one of psychic powers, quoting the latter. " One night I went forth to go round the Ka'ba. I took one step in Igidi, then I went beyond the Ka'ba, then I retraced my steps back to the Ka'ba, and I went round it. Then I went around the mosque of Medina, then I came to cemetery of Baqi' (at Medina), and while I was going round 'The mothers of the believers' and other tombs than theirs, I encountered one of God's saints who said to me, 'You are people of the (Mauritanian) gibla, do you think that you visit (the tomb) of Muhammad al-Yadali at In-Tu'ffukt 8 when this is his tomb in the Baqi' ? ' In a dream I perceived a light rising up from the tomb of al-Yadall, and it joined the tomb of the Prophet. Then I saw the Prophet, the blessing and peace of God be upon him, and with him was al-Yadali within the (surrounding) lattice. They were laughing, and around them both were many scholars and saints, but not one of them was allowed within. I, the beholder in the vision, said to myself, 'Would that I knew how it is that al-Yadali acquired this status which no other man enjoyed'. I glanced towards al-YadallI, and he said, 'Because of my love for him in my life on earth and the degree to which I praised him'."' 'One day he travelled, accompanied, in search of pasturage far from water and habitation. They were exceedingly thirsty, and were nigh unto death. Muhammad al-Yadali left for a while. While they were yet in dire thirst he brought them four goat-skins of water. They said to him, " Where did you get this water ? " He said, " So-and-so, the Daymani, gave it to me at Fumm al-Dayhhan in Igidi ". That spot was a distance of half a month's travel from where they were. Then he poured out the water and returned the goat-skins 8 According to the author, Tu'ffukt in Zniga indicates 'the sun', and the name means 'the well of the sun'. (However, for the meaning ' sun ', Faidherbe, R. Basset, and F. Nicolas give forms with non-geminate f. But the last-named does give forms with geminate f meaning ' clart6, lumiBre ', etc.) It lies at the extremity of the Igidi heartland,</page><page sequence="8">ZNAGA ISLAM DURING TIIE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 503 to their owner immediately. One day he travelled towards Atar. When he had accomplished part of his journey, his camel had a brutal fracture, its shoulder bones protruded from its skin, and his riding beast and milch-camel grieved. He went on foot towards a settlement, but when he had walked to a certain spot his feet were too exhausted to go further. He returned to where his camel was and recited over it the following words from the Burda of al-Bfilsiri. " How often has his hand by its touch cured him who is sick, and has unloosed knots from the noose of him who is slightly deranged " (v. 86) and " If his miracles, in grandeur were to correspond to his worth, then his name when invoked, would give life again to decaying bones " (v. 47). The camel knelt, shook, and was cured on the spot. He saddled it, mounted it, and went on his way until nightfall. Then he tethered the camel. When it was morning he followed after it, and lo, it had cut its tether. He continued to track it, until he lost it. He found the noon heat oppressive so he went to a tree and sat in its shade, and while he was having his siesta, lo, an artisan (?) came riding upon the camel and made it kneel. He (al-YadallI) saddled it and went to his (the artisan's) tomb because he was one of those who dwelt in the grave.' 'One day they journeyed from morning until the late afternoon, and when they camped, his ink-well, which he needed in order to write, was missing. It had been left in the camp, and it was among those things he prized most. He called one of his nine daughters (his sisters were nine, and his aunts were nine), and she came to him, and he said to her, " Bring my shufrud "-it was his fihrist-this (Znaga) word indicating the book wherein were gathered narratives from other books. She brought it to him, and he said to her, " Pull it out ", and she took it out of its cover, and he said to her, " Shake its cover ", and she did so; then he said to her, " Put it in again ", and she put the book inside the cover. He said to her, " Take it out ", and again she did so. He said to her, " Shake its cover ". She did so, and the ink-well fell out of it, that ink- well which had remained in the camp they had left.' 'One day he said to one of his friends that he never beheld anyone without seeing on his forehead either wretchedness or happiness (?) (perdition or bliss ?) as a yellow line, but he counselled him to keep this disclosure a secret while he was alive, and that he never told anyone that he was wretched or happy out of respect for the Almighty and out of fear lest one be angry and the other happy.' 'One night he was asleep when the people suffered a year of drought. In his sleep he saw the renowned Sidi Ahmad Lahbib, who said to him, " On the morrow call for alms in the mosque, and whatever you collect give as charity to a poor man riding on a camel. On account of him rain will reach you, and your adversity will be ended ". When he (al-Yad1i) awoke in the morning he called for alms, and no one had done this before. He was asked the reason. He said, " The alms you give to-day will be given to a poor rider, and the drought will depart from you on account of him if God so wills ". Events transpired as he had foretold.' 'He told how once he was absent at a great distance, and the people</page><page sequence="9">504 H. T. NORRIS performed the noon prayer. Everyone in the mosque prayed except for the saint al-Maqfilr, chief of the Banfl Dayman. He was asked the reason why, and he said, "I will not pray this noon prayer save in the company of Muhammad al-Yadali ". They said, " Muhammad is absent in the north-west, so how can you see him ?' " He said, " He will now come, wearing his green darrd'a in which are two rents ". Meanwhile they heard the bellow of a camel ridden by Muhammad al-Yadali who was wearing his green darrd'a. He dismounted, then he came to al-Maqfilr, putting two of his fingers in the two rents of his darrd'a. He shook hands with him and told him that he was aware of what had been said by the people and he had come to prove him to be truthful.' 'One day the idea occurred to his wife to ask herself how she could be in a position to see which hand of al-Yadali was the longer, since it was said that one hand was longer than the other. He was sitting, then he arose, made sure he could see no one near-by by glancing about him, and then showed both his hands to her, stretching them forth, and lo, one was longer than the other. He withdrew them, and neither exchanged words save those which were in her thoughts. Nasir al-Din said before the marriage of al-Yadali's father that one of his hands would be longer than the other.' 'One day he came out of the mosque, and two savage dogs attacked him. He blew upon two of his fingers, pointed them towards the dogs, and they flew from the ground towards the sky and fell dead on the ground, all of a sudden. He said, " By God, were it not for the fear of God I would act likewise with mankind ".' 'Once his family were in need of clothes, and lo, a man came one night carrying a provision bag filled with clothes on top of a bull. He unloaded it at his abode, and he said to him, " Who are you ? ". He said, " I don't know ". He said to him, "Where do you come from ? " and he answered, "I don't know ". Then he and his bull vanished, and none knew who he was. Al-Yadali began to divide the clothes among everyone who was naked.' 'Once he was absent. His wife was of wondrous beauty. One of the young men was keen on visiting her at night. When it was dark, he saddled his camel and rode towards the Shaykh's wife. When he had gone part of the way an intense blackness met him, and all sides of him were enveloped in it. He made his camel kneel, and when he dismounted to await a respite, he was met by a bear, and it defecated upon him, upon his garments and upon his camel, until he stank far worse than a corpse. He returned fouled and polluted, and he lay concealed in the open desert watching the tribal camp until the next day he was met by a gum-collector. He said to him, " Help me with some water ". So he brought him some, and he washed himself thoroughly in it. By this he learnt his lesson.' 'One night he left the mosque making for his tent, and he spied three men with his wife. One of them fled in fear of the Shaykh. One of them came to him, grasped his back and repented to God and prayed to him for wholeness</page><page sequence="10">ZNAGA ISLAM DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 505 and soundness in this world and the next, and this was granted to him. One of them stayed seated in his place out of shame towards the Shaykh. The latter put his hand upon his head and prayed that he should be guided aright. He became a saint, and henceforth he never looked at a woman other than his wife. As for the one who fled, disaster befell him, God knoweth best.' 'There was once a man who had an ailment in his stomach, and he was at death's door, having despaired of the doctors. While he was in this condition one day he met a slave of Muhammad al-Yadali who came to the cattle resting- place near water and who leant over the camels' drinking trough and drank from it. The sick man said to himself, "I will drink the remainder of this slave's drinking water, perchance God will cure me by the baraka of his saint ". When he had swallowed a sip of it, he was gripped by al-layya (colic or pain near the navel), and he went quickly into open country, and that malady left him on the spot. Then he became fit and lived for a long time.' 'There was once a woman confined to her bed with consumption, and one day it happened that Muhammad al-Yadali came riding to the resting-place for cattle near water. She said to her mother, " Go and bring me the remainder of his camel's drinking water so that I may be healed ". She brought her water from the drinking trough in which his camel had drunk, and she drank it. When she did so, she vomited forth her sickness on the spot, and she was made whole through the baraka of the Shaykh.' 'One day some young men took hold of him, and two who were strong covered his eyes. Then the rest of them took the text of Khalil.9 They opened it, and they asked him about the place they had opened. He told them, and they went on opening the book and asking him until they had completed the text of Khalil. By his psychic power he told them about the place they had opened. They released him, and this became proverbial so that afterwards they used to say, " Is it news of al-YadallI you ask about after the night of the book ? ". One night Walid b.

'Abd al-Qidir said to him, "I am an ignorant man, I cannot remember anything unless it is written down, so put down in writing what you say ". So he wrote it for him, and when morning came, he found it in his possession written down.' 'Also among his miracles are his experiences while journeying to Agadir Dilma (Arguin). Al-Nabigha said, relating his story, that Muhammad al-Yadil said, " This ode (Salatu Rabbi) 11 has great virtue and baraka, and it in no way dishonours the baraka of the Prophet, the blessing and peace of God be upon him. I have observed its baraka in many localities, and this is one of them. Once I rode on a vessel of the Christians sailing to Agadir Dilma so that I might make myself acquainted with some of its marvels. We journeyed until nightfall, and a violent wind arose which almost broke the ship in pieces, and the crew were near to total loss. They sought for help in their dire misfortune while I was on my own at one side of the ship, and no one paid me attention, and none knew me nor I him. Then one of them began to repeat this verse, ' The blessing and peace of God be upon my beloved the best of mankind '. I arose and said to him, 'Do you know who composed this verse ? '. He said, 'A Zawi from the people of the gibla whom I do not know '. I said, ' I am he ', and I recited to him part of the ode. He went to the crew, and they started to ask me who I was and what was my business, and I told them. Then they put me in a part of the boat where I would be in peace, and at that moment the baraka of the.Prophet, the blessing and peace of God be upon him, came upon me, and then the wind abated, and it was calm, praise be to God, and we continued to pursue our course until we came to Agadir Dfima, and they carried me on their shoulders to the shore.

Muhammad al-Yadaill was a prolific writer 's although he showed little interest in legal studies. He was a theologian and a historian. After prayer and Qur'an study he would spend each day writing some extended composition or a number of short treatises or opuscules. ' If he required a library of books, other than his own (for reference), he would read (the works) in two days, then return them to their owner speedily. One of the pious and trustworthy has mentioned that when Muhammad al-Yadall began to recite the Qur'an he would only have to pass some grass, or a stone, or dry mud to take it in his hand and to testify by it. When he died, may God have mercy on him, a pious woman sorrowed for him, and there was true love between them in God, for God, by God, from God, and towards God. Then she saw in a dream that there was not a tree nor a stone on the face of the earth but it danced and said, " Muh.ammad al-Yadali ", praising him the saint Muhammad Sa'id; and the most excellent in dancing was the Qandalis, the taydim (baobab) in Hassaniya. The earth rejoiced for him, and the sorrow which she felt over him ceased because of that vision. Whenever folk betook themselves to their beds at night, he lit his candle and spent the night writing until the sun rose. He had a swift jade. When others rode, he saddled it, grasped its rein, and he sat beneath a tree and began his writing, and when they had gone a mile or so, for example, he would fold up his books, gather his instruments together, mount his horse and urge it forward to overtake them. Customary habits in copying works were disregarded in his case, since he would write two fascicules at the beginning of the day and two at its end. Without intent to boast he used to say, " Had I not been a nomad, then I would have written as many works as al-Suyfiti ".14 And it is reported that he also said, "How many people have attained the degree and goal of Nasir al-Din and kept quiet about it ", thereby meaning himself.' The ideal society which Muhammad al-Yadali conceived for the Zniga Zwaya is described in his Shiyam al-ZawayJ. He saw the future of his com- munity as a shining Muslim example, surrounded by the iniquitous and the pagan. The light of the Prophet Muhammad was reflected in his saints. The Zwaya should avoid hostility, strive to do good works, and establish a brother- hood with other social groups. Muhammad al-Yadali not only regarded this as the ideal life for the Tashumsha but also sincerely believed that it was the kind la See Appendix I. 14 The greatest polygraph in Islam, Jalsld al-Din al-Suyiiti, 1445-1505.</page><page sequence="13">508 H.

'Features of both their morality and their way of life were the elimination of matters of dissension and their avoidance of close contact with other people, seeing their virtues and being blind to their vices. Theirs was an absence of self-satisfaction, and they wronged no one for their own pleasure. It was other men, and only they, who behaved in a hostile manner towards them. They treated others with a gentle courtesy, showing hospitality to both humble and exalted alike, and they rendered unto no man evil for evil. Little was their covetousness of other men's possessions and especially the doers of iniquity, minimizing their social contacts with outsiders as much as they could and in particular with (the Banf) H.assan and with those who were close to them, except for that one who they were persuaded was a member of their company, a follower in this exemplary way of theirs. Henceforth he was as one of them, whether he was a negro or a Sanhaji (a Znagi tributary), and they shunned those who had dealings with (the Banf) Hassan. And (it was their custom) to honour that which was revered by the Muslims and to delight in their welfare and to respect the God-fearing and the learned, and to cherish the poor.' Islam had many foes. There were Christians on the coast and on the Senegal river, but to Muhammad al-Yadali and to his pupil Walid b. Khaluna 15 they were not the most deadly threat. Both admitted that many of God's enemies were to be found in the mosque, and many of God's saints were to be found in the church. The worst enemies were the 'godless' H.assan, 'Arabs' who were 'cutters of the road' and who refused to accept the obligations of Islam, although nominally Muslims. These Bantf Hassan, the Banfl Maglfar in particular, had betrayed Islam. They were not Znaga, but the Tashumsha did not oppose them for any ethnic reason. Were they not themselves, in part, HIimyarite Lamtflna and did they not claim descent from the Caliph Abfi Bakr al-Siddlq ? The Tashumsha Zwaya had once fought desperately for their ideals. They had lost, since the Banf H.assan were more expert in the art of war (they were better horsemen), dissension had split the Zwaya camp, and their Imam Nasir al-Din had been slain when the fruits of victory were within his grasp. The hero of the bitter war of Shurbubba was a mujahid, not a scholar, but to Muhammad al-Yadali there were certain circumstances where armed defence of the faith could be justified. Since Nasir al-Din bore all the marks of sanctity and had chosen to fight, who could criticize, let alone condemn, the mysterious ways of the Almighty in dictating Zwaya fortunes ? Military defeat was hard to explain. Yet in some strange way the Zwaya had suffered defeat to deepen their spiritual experience. It was his duty to record for posterity the Zwaya epic and to portray its hero as an example for future generations of the Tashumsha, among whom the Banfi Dayman were undisputed leaders.

His miracles and his military feats were all explicable by superhuman power. The point is emphasized again and again in MuhIammad al-YadMlI's writings: ' The pure lights in the saints are only (duo) to the illumination of the Prophet- hood bestowed upon them. The " real presence " of Muh.ammad may be likened to that of the moon. The moon only sheds its light on account of the appearance of the light of the sun and its receiving of it. The sun shines by day, and also by night, due to the appearance of its light in the moon. Thus, just as the sun's light continues both by night and by day, so the lights of the Messenger of God (the blessing and peace of God be upon him) remain in saints (who came) after him, because they acquired that by following him, and they have been illustrious in undertaking to imitate him. As it has been permitted to the Prophet to recount the unknown and unseen, so it is permitted to the saints; since that which is possible as a mu'jiza (miracle of a prophet) is also possible as a kartima (miracle of a saint) '. 3.

Muhund Amghhar (the ancestor of the Banfi Dayman) was so obscure in origin that many scholars of authority in other Mauritanian tribes were unaware of his real name and knew him simply as Nasir al-Din. MuhIammad al-Yad1I has portrayed his hero as light-skinned, curly-haired, short, and flat-nosed. He turned his toes inwards when he walked, and his countenance was lit up as though by a radiant light. Whenever he engaged in commerce or undertook a journey, those of lowly status in the community entrusted their wares to him, and he would fill their vessels from his own supplies. His wife was of noble rank, and she was very beautiful, but he rarely slept with her since he was an ascetic and he spent his nights in prayer. He fasted regularly, and he was punctilious in his religious observances. Certain respected scholars tested him in order to be convinced that he was of exceptional sanctity and merited their allegiance. His sanctity was observed in certain virtues and in supernatural powers. He was able to attract all men to him and to make them embrace his teaching whatever their class or whether they were 'Arab ', 'Berber ', or ' Siidani '. He spoke with authority in matters of faith, and he pronounced independent judgements on the authenticity of had~th and Qur'an exegesis. He predicted signs which foretold the deaths of men, and he revealed many other powers of clairvoyance. He disclosed the whereabouts of concealed objects, and he manifested powers of telepathy. He described the abode of believers in the hereafter, and he knew the names of the dead whose bodies were preserved from decay and who would act as intercessors. Sometimes he ordered graves to be opened to demon- VOL. XXXII. PART 3. 35</page><page sequence="16">510 H. T. NORRIS strate the infallibility of his psychic powers. One such example was the grave of a Persian saint from NIshaptir who was buried in that district. He honoured the scholars, and he cared for the needy. He felt an acute pain in his hand if he shook hands with the disobedient or with those who were rich and uncharitable. Al-Khitdr 16 was his constant spiritual solace and travelling companion. Nasir al-Din was a healer of body and mind, and he was a vessel of baraka which was absorbed by the laity in his washing water and in his uneaten food. ' Were you not to take my baraka ', he once said, ' I would rub it on the trees and offer it to the beasts of the field.' These proofs were important. Certain scholars disbelieved or resented them, but it is clear that other aspects of his life and teachings were to have far greater consequence in the development of his religious movement. He was a revivalist, an exhorter and a successor to the Caliphs. His commands were addressed to all men, yet peculiarly directed towards the Banti Dayman. Their age of hijra had now in the fulness of time become their age of spiritual and temporal jihdd. For three years he preached repentance and reflection on the world to come. The prevailing Berber attitude to the role of women was modified; they were confined to their tents, their voices were not to be heard. During this period Awbek changed his title from Sayyiduni to Imdmun&amp;, then to MushY' al-Din and finally to NJsir al-Din. His followers tacitly acknow- ledged this titular succession, which perhaps represented attempts to acquire a definitive status for himself in his expanding Islamic umma. His goal was to found a community, which would transcend ancient tribal and ethnic divisions and which would resemble the ideal society of the early Caliphs.'7 All the Zwaya were to be united in loyalty to their Imam, and every Zwaya leader swore allegiance (bay'a) to him under an acacia tree. Yet within the life of the community as a whole there were to be no radical changes in class interdependence, in tribal alliances, or in marital relations, neither was this Islam incompatible with Znaga life or social connexions, or their cult of saints and holy places.'s To administer his community Nisir al-Din selected his most trusted advisers from his relatives. His wazir was his cousin Abhum b. Ahmad, whom he called 16 Al-Khadir or al-Khidr is a mythical personage who is human, angelic, mundane, and celestial; cf. El, first ed., s.v. ' al-Khadir '. '7 He is alleged to have said, ' We and the Companions of the Prophet on the Day of Judge- ment will be alike as two crows '. 8 ' " It suffices a woman of the Banti Daymin in order to enjoy superior honour to marry a Daymrni ", he said.' The teaching of Nigir al-Din had no appreciable effect on the matrilineal character of his society. This is apparent not only from the Kitab al-ansab of Walid b. Khhluni, but in an interesting detail preserved from the missing work of Muh.hammad al-Yadili, Ghazawat Shurbubba. 'The faqik al-Amin informed Nigir al-Din of his mother's names. The genealogists had written them down as dictated by the genealogist al-F.dil b. Id Muhund al-Shaqr~wi. Niir al-Din traced them back until he reached one whose name had been erased and the faqih al-Amin had forgotten her. When Niir al-Din told him who she was he said, " Awbek (Nigir al-Din) has correctly spoken. She indeed it is ". Then N~ir al-Din said, " Had I so wished I could have traced them back to our mother Eve ".'</page><page sequence="17">ZNAGA ISLAM DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 511 qd&amp;di 'Uthman.

Abi Bakr who was the son of al-Mahi's sister. Al-Mah. i was the particular confident of Nasir al-Din. It is clear from the title of wazir and the appointment of qdudis that Nasir al-Din wanted an administrative reorganization of his community. Muh. ammad al-Yadali observed that 'up to that time no such person had assumed the position of sultan or governor in the gibla '. The concept of a supreme head whose word transcended that of tribal leaders was alien to it, although the Zwaya tribes knew that there were kings among the Wolof who from time to time had raided their bank of the Senegal river to take their kinsfolk captive. Other Zwaya writers argued that the Dar al-Islam had hitherto lacked a reformer (muslih) in this region, since the Sa'dian rulers of Morocco never held it within their spiritual jurisdiction. In this spiritual vacuum, the Imam Nasir al-Din was the temporary divinely elected muslih, and his Imamate was established as of divine right by conquest, military power (shawka) and by lineage (nasab), since the Banft Dayman claimed descent from AblY Bakr al-Siddiq.19 Rulers of Sudanic states are cited as the source for all these titles applied to Nasir al-Din, but the influence of Saharan myths and popular legends about the Almoravids are of far greater relevance since they are specifically referred to in Muhlammad al-Yadali's works. Al-Murbit. appears in Mauritanian personal names but the title of Zwaya is of similar intention and is specifically deemed to be such by the local authors.20 Neither does ' Arab ' or 'Berber' have particular significance for those Saharans or Znaga who wish to attach a tradition or a precedent to earlier religious movements which to them were matters of pride. There are various reasons for this. Foremost amongst them is the accepted view that the Lamtflna, because of their alleged Yemeni lineage, have as much right to ' Arab ' descent as, if not more than, the Banfl Ma'qil or any other recent intruder group. 'Arab' indicates 'warrior' or 'freeman', chiefs of the Banft Hassfin, or almost any Saharan. It depends entirely on the context of the term used and the 19 There was no relationship between N5eir al-Din and the Sultan of Morocco (where at that time the 'Alawite dynasty had yet to establish itself) comparable to that of aykh ME' al-'Aynayn over 200 years later.

Ren6 Basset, Mission au Sinigal, I, Paris, 1909, 575. 2o Dhat alwdhu wa dusur states ' Perhaps the Zw~ya (Zawiya) are named thus because they adopted the zawiya set aside for learning and for worship, and they were given this name on account of that. Perhaps the reason why they are called Talba is because they are talabat al-'ilm, and perhaps the reason why one of their number is called Murabit is the derivation of the word from rib.t, namely murabatat al-'adiw (i.e. being stationed on the enemy's border).

NORRIS intention of its user. To the Znaga Zwaya and other Western Saharan Berber groups, ethnic distinctions had been blurred and confused long before the birth of Nasir al-Din.21 The Znaga Zwaya felt themselves to be distinct from the 'Arab' Banil Maglhfar or 'Berber' warrior Anbat Znaga by reason of lineage or language, or by vocation or in their social status. Conflict was an issue of pasturage rights, ownership of wells, class, or religious ideology. Any appeal for common unity among the Zwaya would inevitably draw upon the heritage shared by the largest number of their particular community. The Lamtiina were 'Arabs' according to local belief. It is the Lamtfina who furnished a precedent for holy war, for propagation of the faith, or its defence, irrespective of the creed or colour of the infidel. Muhammad al-Yadali in his commentary on his poem Salatu Rabbi quotes a report regarding N.sir al-Din which not only illustrates the beliefs of the local Zwaya about his person, but which refers specifically to the Lamtfina. Significantly this report emanated from the Lamtfina Tajakant. ' I was told by a man of the Awlad Abayri of the Id Abhum, whose name was al-Mukhtar b. 'Umar and who had grown up among the Tajakant and who was with them during the days when they fought with the 'Aruisiym, and (this is what) he said, " I rode one day, during those wars, with the saint al-Ma1hjiib al-Jakani, and we were both going towards Qasr Tugba.

I will report what I have heard from the elite of the trustworthy. I heard the scholar Shaykh al-Tilib 'Abdullih b. al-HI.jj Mubammad al-Ragig al-'Alawi make mention more than once that the fifth of the Awlid IHassin afore- mentioned was named 'Ubaydalla (in H.{assiniya colloquial), and that he was the ancestor of the Idaygub of the Zwiya Tashumsha of the furthest Maghhrib. I also heard his (correct Arabic) name 'Ubaydullih. I have seen written in the hand of al-HI. jj Bu Bakr b. Mu1hammad b. Muham- mad b. al-T.lib, friend of al-Ijumm~ni, that he accounts his ancestors back to 'Umar b. Hassin. I have heard this from others, except that I have learnt from a reliable source that Ijummin stem from the Izammit Tuareg, and that he " arabised " Izammit into Ijummin. I said that Ijummin are two tribes. One of them is called the Id-Kayti and the other the " Arabs ". It could be that the Id-Kayti are of the seed of 'Umar b. H.assin while the others are Izammiten. The reverse is possible, that al-HI.jj Bu Bakr is related to 'Umar b. H.assin (and folk are to be trusted in their genealogies), and that the others are called the " Arabs ". This name excludes those who have a lineage from Izammit since they are Massfifa Sanhija Tuareg, and they are not called " Arabs " '. In this same work the author admits the mixed offspring of 'Uthman b. Maghfar since he had four sons.

Then he mentioned a sign to me which would be visible in his teeth and another in his nose-namely the obliqueness of its shape. Then when the days of N.sir al-Din came, I journeyed to visit him with a party of riders from the Id/jayjba, and we came to the Zwaya camp at night. A man quickly came to us and said, 'Where is al-Mukhtar b. 'Umar ? '. That both surprised and worried me, since I knew not the man nor any other amongst the people of the camp. I was then pointed out to him, and he said, ' Answer the summons of our Imam N.sir al-Din '. So I went with that man, and I approached his exalted presence. A crowd prevented me from approaching him. I stayed there as long as God so willed it, until waiting there was burdensome to me and none cared about me. I returned to my companions, and I spent the night with them. Early the next day the messenger of N.sir al-Din came again and said, 'Where is al-Mukhtir b. 'Umar ? '. He was told where I was. He said, ' Answer the summons of Nasir al-Din '. So I went with him until we came to his exalted presence, and there were present with him a number of his close associates, the martyr-saint al-Ma.hi b. al-Fadil and his cousin Noir al-Din and the martyr Muhlammad b. al-Saykh al-Amin b. al-Fdil and the qSdl 'Uthman. At that time they were most anxious to speak with him so they left me for a while. Then NMsir al-Din turned to the martyr Muhlammad b. al-Amin b. al-Fadil, and he said to him, 'Ask al-Mukhtar b. A'mar ('Umar) about that thing said to him by al-Mah1jaib '. He asked me, but at that time the episode about the youth which he had told me about was no longer in my mind, so long ago it was. I said, 'Many matters were discussed between al-Mahljaib and myself. He was involved in wars, and we were concerned with matters relating to blood-money. I do not recall this matter which you say had been drawn to my attention '. They spoke together for a while, and it occurred to me that I appeared to have been forgotten in regard to their desire to know what the saint had said. Then Nasir al-Din turned to the qSdd 'Uthman and said to him, 'Ask him about what al-Mah1jaib said to him '. He asked me and importuned me. I repeated, 'I do not recall this matter which has been drawn to my attention '. Nasir al-Din said, 'Ask him about what al-Mahjaib said to him before they arrived at Qasr Tugba '. I remembered the whole episode exactly, and I knew that he was the youth whom al-Mahj ib had told me about. I looked for the two signs on his face which he had mentioned to me, and lo, there was the one in his nose. I asked myself, 'How can I see the sign in his teeth ? ' He appeared to read my thoughts. He smiled, and I saw the sign in his teeth. I knew that he had only smiled in order to show it to me. I said to them, 'That matter you ask me about, I know no more about it, than you do '. They smiled. I said to myself, 'Would that I knew the identity of the " Arabs " of the face-muffler mentioned to me by al-Mah1jfib '. It was as though my thoughts were once again disclosed to him, and he said, ' Only the</page><page sequence="20">514 H. T. NORRIS Lamtiina pray veiled' (or he said 'the Murabitiin' "2 [the reporter was in doubt]), indicating thereby that the " Arabs " of the face-muffler were the Lamtiina because their insignia was the wearing of a lithdm and veiling of the face, and the fuqaha' ruled that to be veiled was reprehensible save for those who wore it as their insignia. It is said that the clan of Nl~sir al-Din was from the Lamtfina." ' This story sheds light on the motives behind the movement of Nasir al-Din. It is clear that a need was felt to relate the episodes of his life to an earlier jihad and to give his jihad eschatological significance. A prophecy of the Tajakant, who pastured in the gibla as well as the Adrar and the Moroccan Sils, provided it. Despite these references, there is little to indicate that Nasir al-Din deliberately intended to represent his movement in any way as an historical Almoravid revival, nor does it appear to have begun as a ' pan-Berber' revolt as is frequently suggested. It is significant that the Lamtfina are referred to as 'Arab al-Nigdb. They were veiled, yet Nasir al-Din could hardly have been permanently wearing a litham, if al-Mukhtar b. 'Umar could identify prophetic marks in his countenance. The Znaga-speaking Zwaya and Sanhaja of the south had already relaxed, if not entirely given up, this characteristic custom under the influence of 'Arab' habits, or due to some modification in their cultural life. Other accounts are silent and, in general, the teachings of Nasir al-Din bore little resemblance to those attributed to the Almoravid 'Abdullah b. Yasin. The forces of Nasir al-Din first attacked the negroes across the Senegal river. Filta (Toro) was conquered by the hand of al-NahlawI b. Agd 'Abdullah (of the Idayjba), and N.sir al-Din made him governor over it. Juluf (Jolof, Senegal) was conquered by al-Fadil b. AbtY Ya'dil al-Idachfagha. He made Sarango, a pious man of theirs, governor. Isanglian (Kajar) was conquered, and Anjay Salla was appointed governor. Shamama (Walo) was conquered by al-F.dil b. Muh. ammad al-Kawri. He was aided by units of the Idaw al-H.Iajj and 60 men from the Tiijfat, a village in the south-west Tr~rza founded by the Tajakant. Nasir al-Din personally entrusted him with the task, and there is a brief reported account of this expedition by Ah1mad b. al-Amin.23 22 The doubt of the reporter is unfortunate since the Lamtfina were not the only Murabi.t0n, nor were the latter all Mulaththamin. Since Mulaththamnn, as a title, lacked the honour and religious sanctity of the former, and as the lithim is a key feature of the story, the context suggests that Nigir al-Din said Lamtfina, if indeed there is any authenticity in this story whatsoever. 23 'We journeyed with him (i.e. al-Fdil b. Mul.ammad al-Kawri) after the noon prayer. We sent (word) to the village of Tfijfat (Qjfat), and they reinforced us with 60 men. We spent the night at a river in Shamama known as Abikh. A man from the people of the king called Burigrig (the Brak of Walo, a region south of Rosso) came to his master and informed him that he had seen a " Moorish " army. That same hour he sent to one of his noblemen who bordered on the power of the " Moors ", and he came to him with eight horsemen. He told him the story reported to him by the other man regarding the (Zwaya) camp and that men of it had been conveyed over the river (Senegal).

The local population were not in favour since he came from a group who were kinsmen of theirs. Instead, they preferred a man whom they deemed to be the most just, Anti .Srr. Nasir al-Din disapproved of the choice. He warned the qS1di 'Uthman that this man would act treacherously. Islamic observances were revived on the south bank of the Senegal river, and penalties for infringement were imposed. The reason for this Senegal jihad is nowhere explicitly stated by Muh.ammad al-Yadali except that a number of women and children who had been carried off by the ' negroes' were liberated, and that there was a need to check raids made by Wolof princes into the Mauritanian interior. Nasir al-Din may have turned his attention south to the fertile river areas because to the north and to the east certain H.assani groups, the Zwaya Kunta, and the 'ArusiyIn, presented greater military or political obstacles to expansion. The homage sworn to him and also, no doubt, his initial successes, had rallied the bulk of the non-negro population of the gibla to his cause, and the Banti Maghhfar seem to have been prepared to recognize his spiritual authority. Wolof states such as Kajor had been influenced by Mauritanian Islam as early as the fifteenth century.24 Niisir al-Din may also have wished to control the gum entrep6ts of the Idaw al-H1.Jjj, his allies, west of Rosso. About this time, in 1638, French seamen employed by the Compagnie de Marchands de Rouen et de Dieppe installed themselves in the island of Bocos (Babagueye) although their base was to be transferred to Saint Louis in 1659. Nasir al-Din was interested in the growth of commerce as well as the expansion of the faith. For example, he did not oppose the smoking of local tobacco. This view was commonly held by Zwaya scholastics and saints. Commercial interests always played a part in moulding their theology and their local tribal policy. It is likely that religious zeal in this movement, as in many others was tempered by secular factors. The control exercised by the Banfl Maghhfar of Portendick was not the least important among them. to be a coward ". Then he returned to his people. On the morrow we advanced towards (the king). He observed our movements, and he said, " How plentiful the game in Sham~ma is to-day ". Al-Najib b. 'Abdull~h was with the drum on a camel, guiding the army by it and standing behind Niir al-Din. When (the king's) men showed themselves to us with intent to fight, he (the king) fled on his horse. Al-Najib cried out to the cavalry, and they knew that it was the king they had seen fleeing. The cavalry pursued him, overtook him, and slew him.' 24 In Walo Niir al-Din is regarded as the suzerain of the 'pretender' Teedyek whom he helped to the throne. Cadamosto described the innermost court of the king of Budomel (Kaj6r) and noted that 'very few men are bold enough to penetrate thither, save Christians, who are allowed to go about freely when they are present, and also the Azanaghi priests, that is, those who are learned in the law-for more liberty is bestowed upon these two classes than upon his own negro subjects .... Through the great familiarity which Budomel showed me, I was per- mitted to enter the mosque where they pray, arriving towards evening, and having called those of his Azanaghi, or Arabs, who are constantly on duty in the mosque-we would call them priests (they are those who are learned in the law of Mu.hammad), he entered with some of his chief lords into a certain place ' (G.

NORRIS Nasir al-Din next introduced the levy of the zakat. He sent Sidi 'l-Hasan b. al-Qadi (al-'Alawi) as his agent to collect it in herds. The chief of the Tashidbit Lamtfina tribe prevented him from taking the total claimed, but local tradition maintains, that it was a tributary of this tribe, Bubba by name, who was the cause of the dispute since he it was who persuaded the chief of the Tashidbit to seek the military help of Haddi b. Ah.mad b. Daman, prince of the Banfl Maghhfar of the Trarza. Haddi ordered a party of 'Azzilna, a Hassani group, who were noted for their raids, to pillage the herds collected by Sidi 'l-HIasan. Beforehand he sought a fatwd declaring that it was lawful for him to do so. The fatwd was furnished by one of the Zwaya, Talib b. al-H.ajj 'Abdullah al-Balhlasani. It declared that there was no recognized Caliph to whom allegiance had been sworn, and that since N.sir al-Din was not that Caliph, he had no right to demand zakdt. This was not the first split among the Zwaya but it had serious consequences since this scholar kept most of his tribe out of the conflict which followed. Sidi 'l-H. asan proposed that the Zwaya should retaliate against the Banti Maglifar since the latter had resorted to arms. But most of the Zwaya were cautious. They first sent two leaders, Achfagha 'l-Amin and Mu1bammad b. Baba Ahlmad, to verify the circumstances and to meet the Banti Maghhfar. Their action was wise in view of the standing of the family of Baba Ah1mad among the Awlad Daman. They returned, bringing word that the Banti Maglifar no longer regarded agreements with Nasir al-Din as binding, and that they would pay no compensation, nor would they make peace. Further hostilities followed. A Zwaya council decided that military action was justified, but again there was a number of abstentions. The tribes which rallied to NMsir al-Din 25 included the Tashumsha, the Midlish, the Tandaglia, the Idayjba (Al Jayjba/ Ijayjba), the Idaghzaynbu (Al Zaynab) and the Bartil and members of the Ikumlilan, the Intaba, the Idayllak, the Anjamira, the Itmaddak, and the Lamtfina who dwelt with the Idayjba. In the Adrar, Talib b. MuhIammad b. al-A'mash al-'Alawi of Shinqiti advised the local Zwaya not to become involved. However, in the south 30 emigrant Idaw 'Ali joined the forces of N.sir al-Din, and half of them were killed in battle. Even among the Tashumsha there were certain scholars who took no active part. They included al-F.dil b. Bhba AhJmad and Barekallah b. Ba Zayd who supplied the Zwaya troops but who argued that a neutral status might serve Zwiya interests best, if circumstances were unfavourable, or if there were to be further negotiations. There was a 25 A proportion of these tribes claimed to be Sanh~ja. The Tandagha of south-west Mauritania are among the most ancient Zniga-speakers. They were settled to the north until the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries.

The Idayjba were centred in Agin.

They acknow- ledged Nasir al-Din as a religious leader, and they hesitated in branding the Banil Maglifar as kuffar, an extreme view held by some of Nasir al-Din's supporters.2 The Zwaya forces were raised on a voluntary basis. Muh1ammad al-Yadali reported that N.sir al-Din initially had 12,000 men, including units of cavalry, at his command.27 They were divided into two armies. The first, which operated in western districts, was commanded by the qfidd 'Uthman. It saw no active service. The second army, which marched eastwards, was known as the expedition (or battle) of Intfiji. The raid was a success despite minor Zwaya losses, and booty was taken. Only two members of the Banti Dayman partici- pated. Nasir al-Din denied them a share of this booty. A puritan disregard for material possessions was demanded from his kinsmen. The second engagement occurred at Jiwa. The Banfl Maghfar raided Zwaya herds and killed two men of the Mdaw Jan (Midlish). N.sir al-Din pursued them with his cavalry, and they recovered their herds. Thirty-three of the 'Azzlina were killed. The third engagement, Tirtillas, was the key battle in the war. N.sir al-Din was slain.28 This name in Znaga is Tirtichas ' bones are hidden' and a large cemetery was in its vicinity. The battle inspired a number of stories which related that Nasir al-Din, while seated on his horse, predicted his own death there, although the Banti Maghfar would be defeated. After losing 100 dead, the enemy was pursued by al-Fadil b. al-Kawri. Among 28 The point is argued by Muhammad al-Yadali in different parts of his biography. He supports the view that a jihMd against ' Arabs' who are ' cutters of the route' is of greater merit than a jihad against the Christians. 27 The figure of 12,000 corresponds to a force of men, called in Mauritania a lemkalla. This name is specifically applied to the army of Abfi Bakr b. 'Umar al-Lamtiini when he pursued his jihud in the Sahara and the Sfidin. 28 One Zw~ya source has compared the life and death of Niir al-Din with that of his near- contemporary Sidi Mulhammad al-'AyyEshi of SalA in Morocco. Both were alike ' as one crow to another '. This comparison is interesting. It indicates that local Zw~ya did not equate the life of their hero with that of murabi.tMn, but with that of a Moroccan mujahid who lived at the end of the Sa'dian empire. Both men had certain aims and circumstances in common. Al-'Ayy~shi began as a scholar, but later became a mujahid against the Christians at Azemmur. He was recognized as ruler of Sals and its vicinity where he received the support of many Moroccan 'ulam&amp;' in his wish to assume command of the holy war since his ' fighting of the enemy was not dependent on the existence of the Sultan (who was opposed to him) when a jamn'a of Muslims could take his place '. Al-'AyyElii rallied both Arabs and Berbers, and allegiance was sworn to him, although several of the Arab tribes broke their allegiance. Al-'Ayyihi had great success against the Christians at Larache and elsewhere and against Arab and Berber betrayers, in particular the Moriscos who treacherously aided the Christians. Certain 'ulama' ruled in fatwas that it was lawful for him to fight them because of their infidelity to Islam. The Moriscos were scattered, and the Zwaya DilE' interceded for them, but they were rebuffed by al-'Ayyihi, who fought them and their Berber allies on his return from Tangier. Al-'Ayyshi was defeated in battle and fled to tribal nomads who treacherously slew him on 19 Muharram 1051/Tuesday, 30 April 1641 at 'Ayn al-Qaeab. His head was carried to Salk, cf. Mu.hammad al-Saghhir b. al-H. Tjj Mu1ammad al-WafrAni, Nuzhat al-b4di, lithographed edition, Fez, 1307/1889-90, 225-32.</page><page sequence="24">518 H. T. NORRIS the Zwaya dead were several of Nasir al-Din's close companions.29 The battle of Khawwira followed shortly after, but nothing is known of its circumstances. The cause of Nasir al-Din was so linked to his person that it had no chance of success after his death. Religious idealism was increasingly identified with family disputes, Zwaya bigotry, or hatred of the Banti Maghhfar, and power struggles occurred among the leaders. As the ' war' of Shurbubba continued, its motives became confused, and the fact that the martyr had no son made it even harder to choose his successor. Achfaghha 'l-Amin b. Sidi 'l-Fadil (FMl), the second Imam, was in a strong military position following Tirtillas. The Banfi Maghhfar, who had retired to the north, came to terms with him on the pretext that his ancestors were not Lamtiina. The new Imam lacked the fanatical conviction of his predecessor, despite the fact that he was a noted scholar, respected by Zwaya and Banfl Magihfar alike.30 He was inclined to make peace, and prospects of a ditente between the parties to the dispute appeared to be promising. However, the bulk of the Zwaya were opposed to it. They turned to the qd~d 'Uthman who replaced him. The Zwaya particularly resented the fact that their Imam and his brother had married daughters of a Banfi Maghhfar prince.3' They were the first to act in this way, thereby breaking a Zwaya rule, although at a later date other Zwaya did the same. The third Imam, the qgdd 'Uthman, Abhum b. Ahmad, revived a militant policy. Despite his frequent absence due to scholastic preoccupations, he sent a force of 800 men to raid the Banfl Maghhfar at Tilimmis, and 400 camels of the Awlad 'Ayid were seized. The levy of zakdt was reintroduced, implying that his predecessor had made some concessions in this respect, and an expedition sent to collect it was led by Sidi 'l-THasan al-'Alawi. A trap was laid by some of the Awlad Rizg and by the Awlad Khalifa, led by their chief Awdika b. Bti Ayyfib. It was part of a concerted plan of revolt, aided by Burigrig, the Wolof chief of Shamima, and the chiefs of the Rghiwit and Biran. Awdika b. Bfi Ayytib sent Sidi Ahlmad al-Taqariti and al-Fa4.il al-Baffiri as emissaries to the Banfi Maghhfar, with the proposal that they should raid the zakat expedition when the main body of Zwaya troops were scattered or unprepared. The proposal was accepted, and the forces against the Zwaya were combined. The Banii Maghhfar, led by Haddi himself, were supported by the Awlad Khalifa, the Awlad Ghaylan, and elements of the negro population of Shamama who were eager to shake off the Zwaya yoke. Sidi 'l-U.asan al-'Alawi 29 Al-Faqih b. al-Amin was asked whether the Zwaya dead should be washed and prayed over. The qJd. 'Abdullih al-Shinqiti revealed in a fatw5 that they should not be washed and prayed over. Al-F~dil b. Biba Ahmad said, ' Treat them as martyrs as they pronounced them- selves to be '. It is reported that a light shone from the tombs of the Zwaya deceased when they were buried. 30 His scholastic attainments were compared favourably to those of Niir al-Din, Abu 'l-.Hasan 'Ali b. Alhmad al-Ujhiiri, Miliki jurist of Cairo (d. 1656) who seems to have enjoyed great respect in Mauritania and Morocco at this time. a3 He married Fi4ima bint 'Ali b. Ahmad b.

The battle was known as 'Ulayb al-Gha.zaya ' the little dune of the qkd1s '. The Zwaya had cavalry commanded by al-Fa4il b. al-Kawri among the Idaw Fal. Upon hearing the news of the attack he raided the Awlad Khalifa, the Baffir, and the Rghiwat, and slew many of them. That day was the battle of al-Saki. The q(dli 'Uthman was told of the death of Sidi 'I-Hasan al-'Alawi and his companions, and he raided Shamama which he found prepared to meet him. At Injinfi the Zwaya force was defeated, and the q~ddi 'Uthman was killed by the troops of Anti Sarr in a battle in which it is said the negroes used magic in order to bewitch the Zwaya.32 Most of the Zwaya swore allegiance to Nir al-Din, al-Mubarak b. Ilabibullah b. al-Fa4il b. Muhammad b. Dayman, but the army and certain loyal Awlad Rizg gave their allegiance to his cousin al-Fa4il b. al-KawrI. The latter was pressed by his brother Ibrahim to renounce the Imimate. Some reports even suggest that he joined the Banfi Maghhfar with some of his people.33 There were more grave dissensions amongst the Zwaya. Most of the Idaw Jan of the Midlish withdrew, and so did the scholars al-Fadil b. Baba Alumad and Barekallah b. Ba Zayd who had never really favoured Zwaya militancy. At al-'Arsh a Zwaya force of 400 men was surrounded by cavalry of the Banfl Maghhfar, but they managed to escape. A more important combat occurred at Tin Yijmara ** where the Zwaya were weakened by the withdrawal of the Awlad Rizg. They were surrounded by the Banft Maghhfar, and the fourth Imam, Noir al-Din, was killed together with many of his supporters. The fifth Imam, Munir al-Din, the brother of Nasir al-Din, with 100 cavalry and other of his followers found refuge in Senegal or among the Idayjba, while the deposed second Imam, Achfaghha 'l-Amin b. Sidi 'l-Fadil, sought help from the Banii Maghhfar to feed and shelter the Zwaya women and children whose husbands and fathers had been killed or had crossed the Senegal river. When he arrived among the Idayjba, Munir al-Din discovered that they had sworn allegiance to al-Nahawi b. Agd 'Abdullah Idayjbi. After discussion, authority was restored to Munir al-Din, and with the help of the Idayjba he won a number of victories. However, one day he remained behind in the Zwaya camp with al-Nahawi and a small force. Al-Mukhtar b. Agd 'Abdullah had departed with the bulk of the Zwaya on an expedition. In his absence a certain 'Ali al-Bfi 'All, a relative of the Banfi Maghhfar on his mother's side, rode to the Banii Maghhfar and told them that only a token force remained in the camp. The 32 Nicir al-Din had prophesied that the qSdi 'Uthmin was one of a group of his companions who on the Day of Judgement would complain of the heat from Hell, so great would be their labours as intercessors for sinners. aa Although possible, this act does not appear to have impaired the sanctity of al-Fdil b. al-Kawri. Two trees unknown to Mauritania grew on his grave at Tin Yadir. Visitors to his tomb used to acquire baraka from their leaves, but after dissension had broken out among his descendants, the leaves withered and both trees dried up. a4 This name is also rendered as Tin-jummaran.</page><page sequence="26">520 H. T. NORRIS Banfi Maglhfar surprised it, and in the engagement at BRi Kalla, Munir al-Din and al-Nahawi were killed. The sixth Imam, al-Mukhtar Agd 'Abdullh, surpassed his predecessors in his successes against the Banfl Maglifar and the negroes of hamama. He killed over 100 of the chiefs of the Banii Maghhfar, and he took booty in horses, camels, slaves, and other costly possessions. But at Amadir the Zwaya were surrounded. After a day-long defence they were forced to flee under cover of darkness, many of them badly wounded. They disagreed about whether the horsemen should flee southwards, leaving those who were on foot to take refuge in the 'mountains and the valleys '. Amajan, the brother of al-Mukhtar Agd 'AbdullAh, reminded him that his predecessors had preferred martyrdom to flight. The Zwaya force remained to face its opponents on the following day, Tin Yifdid, the final battle of the war. The enemy attacked at dawn, and the Zwaya were almost annihilated. The Imam was thrown from his horse and broke his neck. His foes cut off his head and carried it back in triumph.35 The Banfi Maghhfar proceeded to attack the main Zwaya camp, and they carried the women and children into captivity. The Zwaya remnant banded together and escaped. They crossed the Senegal river, joined the Zwaya troops already there, and pursued a jihdd against unbelieving negroes. The Zwaya who remained north of the river split up into small groups. According to their spokesmen they had lost the war against the Banti Maghfar, because they had an inadequate knowledge and experience of military tactics, and because they had failed to take sufficient advantage of their first victories. Shurbubba reputedly lasted 30 years.36 In a poem of Shaykh al-Q.di 35 Muhammad al-Yadali records a miracle which involved the Imam's head. The Banji Mag1hfar intended to place his head beneath a pot on the fire but whenever they brought it near to the fire it flew a great distance away from it. Miracles of this kind occur elsewhere in the region. The head of Sidi 'l-'Ayyashi, for example, was heard and observed reciting the Qur'An at night. It was returned to its place, and many people repented (Nuzhat al-.5di, 232). 36 Mauritanian scholars who have studied the life of Nadir al-Din suspect that this 30-year chronology is arbitrary or of esoteric significance. The war itself was very short and localized, the religious movement may have lasted a generation. The date of the death of Nadir al-Din is possibly nearer to 1674 than 1650, particularly in view of the seventeenth-century account of Louis Chambonneau entitled ' L'histoire du Toubenan ', edited by Carson I. A. Ritchie in Bull. de l'IFAN, S6r. B, xxx, 1, 1968, 338-53. News of these events were reported as far east as the H. awd. since the Walita Chronicle records that a battle between the Banii Maghhfar and the Zwaya, referred to as waq'at AsArabiba, took place in 1084/1674. The Chronicle corroborates evidence of the brevity of the war. The movement of Toubenan (Arabic tawba 'repentance', Wolof tilbfan) in all likelihood denotes the consequences of the jihid, the Imimate, and the reforms of the partisans of Nigir al-Din and his successors. The first Bourguli (Wolof barkeli ' blessing' ?)-' Le Grand Maistre des Prikres' (Imam ?), killed by Haddi (himself not of the Toubenan) may well have been Nigir al-Din, and his brother Mahomet Dine, one of his successors, the fifth Imam, Munir al-Din. The latter's predecessor, Hiatmankaly, killed in 1674, was almost certainly the third Imam, the q~d., 'Uthmin. In his description of the Toubenan movement Chambonneau portrays it as puritanical, opposed to superstition, unlawful polygamy, and musical entertainment. It was aimed at converting the negro 'proletariat' and encouraging them to depose their impious rulers.

Muhund Baba it is recorded that it began in the year Shanah (1055/1645) and ended in the year Shafah (1085/1675). This epic, recorded in the writings of Muh.ammad al-Yadali, is a mixture of tribal chronicles, miracu- lous feats, and Sanhaja myth. Was N.sir al-DIn simply a local mujdhid or murabit, or was he a figure of regional importance, like the Imam al-'Ayyasi in Morocco ? What is the real explanation for the sudden change from Zwaya pacifism to war against Muslim negroes, and then against the 'Arab' Banft Maghfar ? There is no record of a specific mystic order or its revival which might have been the cause, nor did Nasir al-Din survive in the memories of his followers either through descendants, or as the author of scholastic works, or as the founder of a religious fraternity. He remained a military leader, like Abfi Bakr b. 'Umar. The life of the southern Znaga Zwaya at the end of the war differed little from the life they had lived before it began. While it lasted many of them were indifferent, they changed sides or they pursued their calling in the service of friend and foe alike. Battles were fought without a cause or without a date known to Muh1ammad al-Yadali. It is as though the biographer saw the perennial, inherited sanctity and presence of the Prophet Muh1ammad himself as the raison d'etre of his hero. Is the Imamate of Nasir al-Din, then, largely a myth or a creation of Muh1ammad al-Yadali himself ? Myth alone, even if superficially shaped by Almoravid tales, cannot explain the original intention of the Imamate, the motive for the Senegal jihad, or the religious idealism which permeated the Zwaya movement right up to its final defeat and the dispersion of the last of its adherents. As a religious leader Nisir al-Din was unsuccessful if his life is superficially compared with that of Sidi Mulhammad al-Kunti, his predecessor by over a century. The latter also asserted Lamtfina familial ties, but he used the strength of the Banfi Ma'qil and the weakness of the remnants of the Lamtimna to his own advantage, by entering into an alliance with the former and by keeping aloof from the conflict when the latter were defeated. He was blessed with offspring who were instrumental in propagating the tenets of the Qadiriya order in large areas of the Sahara and the Siidan. He thus ensured that the Kunta enjoyed an honoured status among people of widely differing ethnic groups. In this respect the pacific policies of certain of the southern Zwaya who acted as religious advisers to the Awlad Dimin and the Brakna prior to the movement of NMsir al-Din were closer to Kunta policy. The life of N5sir al-Din, however, had a dramatic and fundamental effect on the development of Islam in much of Mauritania. Idealized by Muh. ammad al-Yadali, his life was held up as an example not only in the gibla but also French and Zwiya (cf. pp. 291, 301, and 302), and commercial interests may well have been at stake. No mention is made of these in the Arabic accounts, nor of the ' cultural revolution ' in Senegal, comprehensively described by Chambonneau. To describe Shurbubba as a ' Berber' revolt against an ' Arab ' yoke is wholly misleading. It was a religious movement and a religious war. Ethnic factors admittedly played their part, but these may well have been exaggerated by later biographers and tribal historians.</page><page sequence="28">522 H. T. NORnrS among the Ahl Barekallah (Barikalla) in the Tiris, and he was lauded by their most famous poets. The gibla, on the very doorstep of Senegal, became a major Zwaya centre, exerting an influence far across the river. In time it became the spiritual heart of Mauritania. The mission of _ayh Sidya, the founding of his zdwiya at Biltilimit, and the honour enjoyed by the Zwhya among the Trarza- all these stem from the religious zeal of Nasir al-Din and the influence of the personality of his biographer. The memory of Nasir al-Din was to provide an ideology for the national conception of the Islamic republic of Mauritania. It is hardly surprising that his life and movement, unconnected with Morocco unlike that of Shaykh Ma' al-'Aynayn, should have a significance for Mauritanian national sentiment, and that the main facts of his life should appear prominently in the history textbooks now used in Mauritanian schools. Thus the Zwaya hero of MuhIammad al-Yadali has become a national hero. His Znaga back- ground, his jihdd, and war with the 'Arabs ' are now regarded objectively as part of an historical process. Mauritanian nationalism is seen to be fore- shadowed in his shortlived umma which embraced all races and which sought to build up a new community in the coastal sdhil where some believed centuries earlier the Almoravid 'Abdullah b. Yasin had established his prophetic ribt..7 APPENDIX I The major works of MuhIammad al-Yadali (excluding poems in praise of his contemporaries) are as follows. al-S yard'fi ansdb k.hayr al-ward. This work in one volume on the genealogy of the Prophet and the Islamic Arabs has been versified by al-Badawi al- Midlishi. Part of this urjfiza is quoted by Ah).mad b. al-Amin al-Sinqiti in al-Wasit, Cairo, 1958, 351, as by Ah1mad al-Badawi al-Majlisi. Here it is referred to as an original composition entitled 'Amild al-nasab, and the name of Mulhammad al-Yadali receives no mention. Without a copy of the Siyard' it is impossible to say how indebted the poem is to the work of Muhlammad al-Yadali. The claim that it is a versification is made in the Daymani text Dhat alwh, wa dusur. Tribal pride may have exaggerated an inspiration into a versification. A muqaddima on the subject of tawh.id, title unknown. a Some recent writers have tended to discount the image of the ribSt, either as a place of meditation or as a stronghold of ascetics, in shaping the beliefs of Saharan Muslims. P. F. de Moraes Farias in his survey ' The Almoravids ', Bull. de l'IFAN, S6r. B, xxix, 3-4, 1967, 847, asserts that 'For the Mauritanians Abfi Bakr and his army are the Almoravid Movement .... For them the Almoravids were not a movement that started in the south but a religious body coming from the north'. Myth or fact, whether on Tidra island or in riparian Shamima or else- where, Zwhya scholars undoubtedly regard the archetype of their class to be in some way connected with the physical retreats of 1ggig b. Zalwi and 'Abdullih b. Yisin, even if the latter may be portrayed in the guise of al-Khadir, who manifests himself in God's greatest saints in every age, and who is associated with springs and with the sea, where he perennially dwells on an island or on a green carpet. The person of al-Khadir may be of significance in linking the imagery of the eleventh-century muribit and the ZAwi of a later age. Al-Khadir, the spiritual guide, was the inspiration of Nadir al-Din and also of the myth of the life and personality of the Shitiri youth of Shinqiti. Their century was typified by spiritual leaders of a similar type.</page><page sequence="29">ZNAGA ISLAM DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 523 A commentary on the above entitled Kitdb fard'i~d al-fawd'id.

APPENDIX II Walid al-Mustafa b. Khaluna al-Daymani (d. 1797) was the most famous pupil of Muh1ammad al-Yadali. His works have a special significance for the Znaga communities of the gibla. He is usually described as a historian, and compared with his master his list of works is short. They are, however, of equal interest and give a clear picture of the ideas and beliefs of eighteenth- century Mauritanian Berber society. His Znaga works are summarized in a short passage from D..hdt alwdh wa dusur (plate i). The two Znaga odes by Walid b. Khaluna are unique. They show that he was able to express religious concepts and Siffi ideas in Znaga and Classical Arabic without significant concessions to H.assaniya save in rhyme and prosody. The subject-matter of the opening of al-Mazrilfa, for example, a poem of some 150 verses, is typical of the devout feelings expressed throughout. It would, however, be premature to furnish a translation from the available Znaga texts. They are being edited by my colleague Dr. J. F. G. Bynon. The following Arabic commentaries on the first 10 verses provide interpretations by Zwaya scholars, bilingual in Arabic and Znaga. (a) The version by Mukhtir wuld Hamidun : (b) The version by Muh~ammad 'Ali al-Daymani, a descendant of Walid b. halun5 , in Abbwayr al-Tawras (Trarza) :</page><page sequence="31">ZNAGA ISLAM DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES 525 Al-Makziz, the second poem, contains 238 verses. It employs Arabic to a greater extent, and its theme covers a wider range of subjects. After an entreaty similar to that in al-Mazrilfa, Walid b. Khluna discusses the doctrines of God's unity and of praise of the Prophet. He then turns to man's short- comings, and he declares God to be the bestower of benefits, more particularly the faculty of understanding books and religious studies. After various requests, he prays that he may die in the true faith. This in turn prompts him to discuss death itself, burial, and the Day of Resurrection. The intercession of the Prophet is sought, then the holy months are invoked, the divine revelation to man, and the Sflras of the Qur'an. After a description of Paradise the poem concludes with another lengthy praising of the Prophet and of his family. Among the most interesting features of this poem is a list of Arabic texts and authors which the poet incorporates in his central verses. A comprehensive description of works known or studied by the Znaga-speaking Zwaya in the eighteenth century, if not earlier, is thus provided. One other surviving Znaga poem is attributed to Wilid b. Khuluna. It is a gdf (a b a b a b) followed by a tal'a (c c c d c d c d)-very rare in Zn~ga- and a second gaf (e f e f). The contents include a request for salt, butter, and tobacco, but the opening gaf is regarded as a prophecy of the Christian occupa- tion of Mauritania. ? * * .- .."? - ? . ? &gt; . .- C Freely translated the poem says, ' A time will come when the pupil will write but act without profit, and the people of Ashaktub (Idawjay) will camp at Inhukara.

PART 3. 36</page><page sequence="32">526 ZNAGA ISLAM DURING THE SEVENTEENTH AND EIGHTEENTH CENTURIES Both didactic poems, al-Mazrifa and al-Makziz, reject the concept of tajsim, usually translated as ' anthropomorphism '. The term is of wide and often loose signification as Professor A. S. Tritton has shown, in his Muslim theology, London, 1947, 104, 105. Fehmi Jadaane in his L'influence du stoicisme sur la pensee musulmane, Beirut, 1968, 160, 161 distinguishes tasbih from tajsim, and points out that the mujassima were not all ' anthropomorphists ' while the mushabbiha were invariably so. Ibn Tfimart repeatedly accused the Almoravids of tajsim, and in this North African context it is tempting to detect some connexion. It is also of interest that the Kunta Shayks devoted attention to this question in teaching Islam among the Tuareg and the Sudanese. Shaykh Sidi Mu1hammad al-Kunti (d. 1826) in his biography of his father Shaykh Sidi al-Mukhtir al-Kunti (d. 1811), Kitab al-tard'if wa 'l-tald'id, wrote : 'I heard that a man from the Kel Anukandar (Tuareg) was a saint and (possessed) psychic power. So I made a point of visiting him, and when I alighted among the tribe where he was I found him engaged in a discussion about ideas of a kind alien to human nature. While he was addressing the people, he said, "I rode my horse, and it carried me aloft. It passed through the heavens, and, lo, there was the Lord Almighty, sitting upon His throne, and I sat by His side ". Then he told me what He had said. I said, " You say nothing which Shaykh (Sidi al-Mu!h.ti~r) has said ". Then I exclaimed, "May God disapprove of you and your belief! Were it not for the fact that our parties of riders had departed, we would have gone out from among you, lest the calamity which will afflict you will befall us likewise. You, in this discourse of yours, and in what you have claimed, have combined four kinds of unbelief. You have claimed to have passed through the heavens in your body and with your horse. This is unbelief. You have attributed corporeality (to God), and tajsim is shirk, and to Him who is mighty and glorious you have associated both aspect and location. This also is shirk. You have presented yourself before God Almighty, thereby, in loftiest status. This too is shirk. All the same, these (people) believe that you are a saint despite your paganism ". " Depart from us-may God not bring you back ", he said. When I returned to hayklh (Sidi al-Mukhtar al-Kunti) and told him what I had heard from the man, he said, "Most of the common people you see are Muslims in name only ".'</page></plain_text>
