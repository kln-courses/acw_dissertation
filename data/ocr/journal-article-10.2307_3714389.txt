<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE VALKYRIES. SINCE the publication, in 1890, of W. Golther's monograph on the Valkyries' no great progress has been made towards the discovery of the hidden origins of these figures of Teutonic hero lore. Golther's main contribution to the problem lies in the fact that he clearly pointed out the multiplicity of the roots of the Valkyrie tradition, since no one explanation will satisfactorily account for the various features of the myths. One of these roots reaches down into Indo-European times, the conception of female warrior divinities being found among other branches of the Indo-European group2. A second root he finds in the existence among the Teutons of female warriors, mentioned by the chroniclers both of antiquity and the Middle Ages3. But he rightly believes their chief r6le as the companions of Othin and the heroes of Valhal (in which they have become immortal) to be the product of the Viking Age and, in part at least, owing to Western (Celtic) influences 4. His chief con- tention, viz., that the poetic conception of the Valkyries, with which we are all familiar, thanks, largely, to Wagner's music-drama, is not primitive Teutonic but not anterior to the Norman expeditions, can be controverted only by additional data of bearing on the history of con- tinental German religion before the introduction of Christianity. That a large amount of new material be forthcoming on Mediterranean or Central European soil is hardly to be expected. The investigator into ancient Teutonic religion must therefore largely draw on anthropological sources and the comparative method whenever the existing documents leave him sadly in the dark. Dr Golther devotes some space to the belief in warlike virgins of supernatural character such as we meet in Sanscrit, Greek, and Celtic mythological sources, and he deduces the correct conclusion that the conception is Indo-European. Curiously enough, he passes over the (continental) Teutonic Idisi of the First Merseburg Charm and an Anglo-Saxon bee-charm, limiting himself to a bare mention5. He does not refer at all to the two female figures connected with Tyr in two monuments unearthed in Britain and going back to Roman times prior to the fall of the empire. 1 Wolfgang Golther, Studien zur germanischen Sagengeschichte.

A few lines will therefore suffice to make the matter clear even to a more general reader. In Northern England, at the site of the old Hadrian's Wall, at Housesteads, two altars were excavated in the last century, bearing two inscriptions3: (1) Deo Marti Thincso et duabus Alaisiagis Bede et Fimmilene et numini Augusti Germani cives Tuihanti v. s. 1. m. (2) Deo Marti et duabus Alaisiagis et numini Augusti Germani civesTuihanti cunei Frisiorum Ver ....Ser ....Alexandriani v. s. . m. One of the altars shows, on the right side, the relief of a female figure, doubtless one of the Alaisiages. Another relief, likewise con- nected with the altars, is a representation of an armed warrior, probably Mars Thincsus himself, accompanied by a bird (goose or swan), and on both sides two hovering genii. The altars were erected in the reign of Alexander Severus (A.D. 222-235). They are ex-votos, erected by Teutonic soldiers from Lower Germany, who served as mercenaries in the Roman legions. In October 1920 a third altar dedicated to the Alaisiages was dis- covered at the same site, bearing the following inscription: (3) Duabus (or Deabus?) Alaisiagis Baudihillie et Friagabi et numinibus Augustorum numerus Hnaudifridi v. s. 1. m.4 A good deal has been written to explain the character of the male divinity, called Mars Thincsus. Whatever may be the origin of that name, it may be considered as established that the ex-votos were erected to him, in all cases, by warriors in his quality of a war-god, and as a war-god he must be regarded in any successful interpretation of the monuments5. As a consequence, the two female figures with their enigmatic names6 must be related to the main figure in the same quality; they must be companions of the war-god and show charac- teristics which justify their occurrence on reliefs of this character. It would be of course hasty to identify the two divinities-for such they are without doubt-with the Valkyries, all the more so because our 1 Cf. Th. Siebs, Mitteilungen d. schles. Gesellsch. f.

Further enquiry must affirm or contradict this conclusion. As early as 1889 R. Heinzel referred to two similar figures mentioned in certain Norse documents'. The Jomsvikinga Saga, a late composition but narrating events of the tenth century and utilising old material, tells the following story. Jarl Hakon, before the decisive battle with the Vikings of Jomsburg, lands on an island and prays to Thorgerd Holgabrudr, but without receiving an answer. Then he promises his own seven-year-old son Erling as a sacrifice. She accepts the offering, the child is killed, and during the ensuing battle Thorgerd and her sister Irpa hurl arrows and big hailstones against the Vikings, who are completely defeated. In one version the two sisters are actually seen standing on Hakon's ship, hurling their deadly missiles2. The Icelandic sources further state that on the island of Hladir Hakon had a temple with the images of Thor, Thorgerd and Irpa. We do not learn that Thor was standing between the two female divinities, but symmetry in the arrangement of figures in a group was doubtless as strict a rule in Ancient Norway as it was in the Mediterranean countries and as it has been ever since3. Paul Herrmann refers to Thorgerd and Irpa as 'weather-goddesses,' a term justified in a way and yet not sufficient. Obviously, their mode of aiding Hakon is but one of many they might have adopted. Nor did the Jarl know in advance what sort of aid to expect. Further, the Valkyries were often supposed to give precisely this type of aid, to strike panic into the enemy. The Norsemen designated such a feeling of sudden terror by the name herfjotur, which is also the name of a Valkyrie4. Still more closely related, it would seem, are the Idisi of the Merseburg Charm, as their assistance does not by any means consist of a mere participation in the battle. With the figures of the ex-votos they have in common their connexion with a chief divinity. Without deciding off-hand in favour of the priority of Tyr over Thor, it may safely be said that the two 'weather-goddesses,' whatever their real and original names, Sitzber. d.

What was their origin ? It is to be noted that neither Tyr nor Thor was originally a war-god. The former, as is well known, was a sky-god, the bright sky personified', the latter a god of the thunderstorm. It should be added that in Greece and Italy both divinities are fused into one, Zeus and Jupiter, who are both sky- and thunder-gods. Since group images usually, if not always, presuppose some sort of relationship between the various divinities represented2, it may be assumed that the two goddesses or semi-god- desses were most probably thought to be the daughters of the chief divinity; they were then the 'daughters of the Sky' or the 'Daughters of the Thunder,' and we must next enquire whether similar figures are found in the mythologies or religious beliefs of other peoples, Indo- European or other. Zeus is credited with numerous offspring, but the number of his daughters is as small as that of his sons is considerable, and no wonder, since female births were held in little esteem in Ancient Greece-and elsewhere. But among Zeus' boys we do indeed find figures which, but for their sex, correspond very well to the Alaisiages of unknown function and the Norse 'weather-goddesses.' The name of the ALO6 KCOVpot, the 'Sons of the Sky,' comes to the mind immediately. In Lithuania we hear of the Dewa Deli, likewise 'Sons of the Sky3.' The Indian Agvins, too, are sons of the sky-god. But the existence of such personages is not peculiar to the Indo-Europeans alone. In Portuguese East Africa (Mozambique) it is the custom to attach to twins, when born, the col- lective name of Bana ba Tilo or 'Children of the Sky,' where the word tilo is used for 'sky' in the most general sense of the term, including the thunder, the lightning and possibly the rain4. The close relationship thought to exist between twins and the sky is brought out by a number of strange customs obtaining among the same people and discussed by Sir J. G. Frazer5. I limit myself to mentioning a few of these, referring 1 Cf. R.

In time of drought the people will take a mother of twins, put her in a hole and pour water on her. This is believed to cause an abundant rainfall. Or they will go in procession, the women naked, headed by a mother of twins, and pour water on the graves of twins. Or they will disinter the body of a twin and rebury it near a river or water-course. When a thunderstorm threatens the village, they will say to a twin, 'Help us, you are a Child of Heaven. You can therefore cope with Heaven; it will hear you when you speak.' And the child will go out and request the thunderstorm to pass away. When the storm is over, the child is thanked for its services. In ancient Peru one of twins was held to be a child of the lightningl. Elsewhere we are told that both twins, whether men or llamas, were considered children of the lightning2. Under these circumstances it is not strange that twins should be credited with a direct influence upon the sky and the weather. The examples from Mozambique quoted above are by no means isolated. The Tsimshian Indians of British Columbia believe that twins control the weather; they therefore pray to Wind and Rain 'Calm down, breath of the Twins3.' Similar beliefs are held by the Kwakiutl Indians on the Pacific Coast, near Vancouver4. Among another tribe of Canadian Indians twins were believed to control the wind5. The Chuswap Indians, likewise inhabiting the Pacific Coast regions, hold that twins are endowed with power over the elements, especially rain and snow. If a twin bathes in a lake or stream, rain is bound to follow6. Among the Thompson Indians twins have control over good and bad weather7. Twin apples are credited with the power to allay tempests in Brittany, in the neigh- bourhood of Cape Finistere8, and the Spartan Dioskouroi were stillers of storms and saviours of hardpressed mariners9. Nor were such beliefs unknown to the Teutonic peoples. In a remarkable passage of the Pidreks Saga"? we are told about the epiphany of the Harlungen, in whom already Miillenhoff saw an ancient Teutonic twin couple": 'When the wind comes from the west and the south and the sun is bright, and at times a soft rain falls, and it is fair in the north and east, what else 1 Harris, Boanerges, p. 9. 2 Ibid., p. 136. 3 Ibid., p. 143. 4 Ibid. 5 Ibid., p. 144. 6 Ibid., p. 146. 7 Ibid. 8 Ibid., pp. 284 and 411. 9 Ibid., p. 285. 10 Saga Didriks konungs af Bern, udg. af C.

The mythical character of this passage was clearly recognised by F. Panzer, who, by the way, was no adherent of Mullenhoff's Dioscuric theory'. In the Jomsvikinga Saga the two companions of the thunder-god do not influence the weather upon the request of the pious husbandman; neither may we suppose the Alaisiages to have done so and to have therefore been honoured by the ex-voto of a centurion in the Roman army. In both cases, we may be certain, the two were in the first place divinities of war and battle. Whether in addition they were prayed to by the peaceful farmer of Norway and Northern Germany, we cannot tell, history being silent on that score. But we do know that this war- like character fully justifies our surmise that they are 'Children of the Sky,' for they, too, are mighty in battle, as we shall see presently. The part played by the Spartan Dioskouroi in the battles on the Sagra2 and on Lake Regillus3, and by another twin couple, later, when the Gauls threatened Delphoi4, is of course well known. Similarly, in 'certain parts of South Africa, in war-time, it was the custom to send twins in advance of the main line of the army5.' Nor did this warlike quality die with the ancient twin divinities; the Christian saints were there to take their place, and twin saints followed twin gods. Thus Protasius and Gervasius protect the Milanese, till they are themselves captured by the host of Frederick Barbarossa and sent to Germany, where they continued to protect the city of their abode in much the same fashion as they had done at Milan. While they were then in Breisach, their place in Milan was taken by St Ambrose, who also possessed many Dioscuric features6. Amicus and Amelius in Lombardy are warrior saints and Dioscures7, and so are the saints Yago and MillAn in Spain; like Castor and Pollux of old, they appear on white chargers and decide the battle of Simancas in favour of the Christian arms. If the Alaisiages are then associated with the war-god, who was also a sky-god, and if they are honoured by a contingent of Teutonic mer- cenaries serving in the Roman army of Britain, the inference is justified that they, too, are heavenly twins. But, it may be objected, so far we have not heard of female Children of the Sky; is the inference not 1 F.

The answer is that Dioscurism is not limited to boys any more than twin-births are; but it must be admitted that the number of girl twins is smaller than that of boy twins, at least in mythology, no doubt for the same reason which accounts for the small number of Zeus' daughters as compared with the multitude of his sons. In Lettish folk-lore we meet two female figures called Devo duktele, the 'Daughters of the Sun,' the exact parallel of the Vedic Divo duhital. In Ancient Greece we hear of the Leukippides, the brides of the Spartan Dioskouroi, according to some versions, of the Messenian twins Idas and Lynkeus, according to others2. The hyperboraean maidens Hyperoche and Laodike, both connected with the Apollo cult of Delphoi and Delos, were twins who routed the Gauls by raising a terrific storm against them. True, in the version of Pausanias they are spoken of as two heroes, Hyperochos and Laodikos3; but Dr Harris is doubtless right when supposing them to be but a masculine presentation of the white maidens from the north4. For when the Pythian priestess of Delphoi was appealed to for counsel at the approach of danger, she replied that she and her White Maidens would take care of the matter5. At Leuktra, famous for the defeat of the Lakedaimonians in 371 B.C., there existed an ancient twin cult of two maidens, the Leuktrides, said to have been wronged by two Spartan youths, just as the Leukippides were said to have been fallen upon by the Spartan or, according to others, by the Messenian twins. The Leuktrides had a powerful part in bringing about the defeat of the Spartan host in the fatal battle which destroyed the Lakedaimonian hegemony over Greece6. If female twins play such a conspicuous part in Greece, where women cannot be said to have held a prominent position in public life, how much more considerable must have been their role in the Teutonic world, where women were admitted to important political and priestly functions, a fact which justly struck the Roman observers7. Alaisiages is the name the two divinities have in common. Two of the inscriptions quoted above besides mention their individual names; but it is a noteworthy fact that these names do not agree. Thus the goddesses of (1) are called Bede and Fimmilene, those of (3) Baudihildi8 and Friagabi. We are therefore justified in concluding that there existed 1 Harris, Cult, p. 43. 2 Roscher's Lexikon, i, 1, cc. 1160-1. 3 Pausanias, Descr.

Siebs, Mitteilungen, p. 12. 61</page><page sequence="8">The Valkyries several twin couples all designated by the common name of Alaisiages'. This is only what was to be expected at the outset. Neither are the Alaisiages the only twin couple of Teutonic mythology. Tacitus mentions the Alcis, whom he identifies with the Dioscures2. The Harlungen and Ammius and Sarus are still others3. Miillenhoff, working under the illusion that Kastor and Polydeukes were the only pair of Dioskouroi among the Greeks, quite naturally concluded that there existed only one Teutonic twin cult and attempted to force an identification of the various Teutonic twins, an endeavour as hopeless as if one should attempt to identify the Spartan twins with the Messenian couple Idas and Lynkeus, or both with the Theban twins Amphion and Zethos or the Elian Moliones. Everything points to the existence of innumerable local twin cults, each twin couple being the property of a fairly narrowly circumscribed district, and if the Spartan twins as a noteworthy excep- tion extended their rule over the Hellenic world and even Italy, this is an exceptional case, entirely owing to the epic poets. There is not the slightest reason to suppose matters to have been different among the Teutons. Thus the Alcis were in all probability Vandalic, Ammius and Sarus Gothic, and the Harlungen Alamannic twins. From inscription (2) we may conclude that it was often thought unnecessary to add the individual names of the two divinities, their common name Alaisiages being deemed sufficient. In this, too, there is an exact parallelism among the Greek twin couples. Thus the common name of Dioskouroi as often as not designates both brothers, and so does in Rome the name Castores. Of most Hellenic twin couples the common name was far more often used than the individual names of the brothers or sisters. Thus we hear of the Apharides, the Leukip- pides, the Moliones, the Boreades4, and others. In the case of the Leuktrides the individual names have so far fallen into oblivion that the various sources disagree, reporting different names. In that of the A~vins no individual names are known. If we leave classical soil and go among the 'savages' of Africa, we find the same situation. Thus in Benga (West Africa) twins are always called Ivaha and Ayenwe. Among the Yorubas they are called Ibeji (twins), and in numerous instances, both in Europe and in other parts of the world, their names, though not the same, are but slightly differentiated5. The fact is that individuality 1 Siebs, Mitteilungen, p. 11. 2 Tacitus, Germania, cap.

To come to the name Alaisiages itself, the most plausible etymology of those hitherto proposed is doubtless that of Th. Siebs2, also adopted by W. Golther3. Siebs derives the word from eisa, which means in Old Norse 'to rush' or 'to hurry,' which in turn would go back to a Prim. Germ. verb aisjan. This etymology leaves no doubt about the relation- ship of the two divinities to the weather and fully corroborates what has been said above about the 'Children of the Sky' and the 'Children of the Thunder.' Between the time of the Britannic inscriptions and the Viking Age, when we find the belief in Valkyries in its fullest development, there is a gap of several centuries, filled with the most far-reaching revolutions in the history of the Teutonic tribes. That there should be numerous and important differences between the Alaisiages of the third century and the Valkyries of the Icelandic sources is but to be expected. We must attempt to take them up one by one, in the hope of accounting for them with the scanty source-material at our disposal. The most characteristic and vital feature of the Alaisiages was their number, which they have in common with other twin divinities. This number recurs, as we have seen above, in the Scandinavian North, where Thorgerd and Irpa may be safely considered as parallel figures of Bede and Fimmilene. In the Hdkonarmdl, written shortly after the fall of Hakon the Good (ca. 970), mention is made of two Valkyries, called GQndul and SkQgul, sent to the battle-field by Gauta Tyr, to carry the king to the halls of Othin4. But on the whole it must be admitted that in the Valkyrie tradition the number two is an exception rather than the rule. Thus in the VdlundarkviS a their number is three5, in the Helreij Brynhildar eight6, in the HelgakviSa Hjorvarbssonar twenty-seven7, and whole bands approach Balder's funeral pyre in VQluspd8. While their number has thus increased, their functions have remained essentially the same. They are still inseparable from war and battle In the case of Thorgerd and Irpa, as was pointed out above, the aid 1 Mod. Lang. Review, xvIII, pp. 152 f. 2 Zeitsch. f. dtsch.

Nor is this an isolated case. Accord- ing to the Helgakcvi6a Hjorvarbssonar their horses shake, and from their manes the dew falls into the valleys, and hail, fertilising the fields'. Rain-giving and fertilising powers are really inseparable, and as a con- sequence, perhaps, we note that everywhere twins are credited with powers of fertility, both animal and vegetable. Thus the twins Apollo and Jacob caused the cows and ewes of their flocks to bear twins, and we are told besides that the cattle and sheep they tended for Admetos and Laban greatly prospered under their care2. Among fisher-folk twins are believed to ensure rich catches3. To agriculturists they are sent by the gods as a blessing on the crops, and various ceremonies, meant to quicken the growth of cereals, are connected with and based upon this belief4. In the First Lay of Helgi the Valkyries appear to the hero; light gleams about them and rays of lightning shine forth from the gleam5. Since there is no mention of a thunderstorm, we must suppose heat, lightning or some other electric phenomenon to accompany the epiphany of the maidens. Turning from the North to the Mediterranean world, in the hope of clearing up the passage of the Eddic poem with the aid of the richer source-material flowing in Southern Europe6, we im- mediately think of S. Elmo's fire, which appears on the masts and yards of ships during storms or immediately before. The phenomenon was known to the sailors of antiquity as well, and the tradition runs that when the light was double it indicated the presence of the Dioscures and was a good omen, but a single flame was thought of ill omen and credited to Helen, the sister of the Spartan twins. In his great work Boanerges Dr Harris pointed out that the Heavenly Twins are the patrons of river and, later, of maritime navigation, and he furthermore proved that S. Elmo is but a Christian form of Remus, the twin brother of Romulus, and that here as elsewhere the pagan divinity was replaced by a Christian saint7. In the same poem the hero Helgi, upon the request of the Valkyrie Sigrun, sails to her father's realm, to save her from an unbecoming 1Stanza 28; Gering, p. 156. 2 Cf. Sir J. G.

For why should clouds take part in a human battle? 7 Harris, Boanerges, pp. 195 ff. 64</page><page sequence="11">ALEXANDER HAGGERTY KRAPPE match. A storm breaks, and the vessels are in danger of being over- whelmed by the waves. Then Sigrun appears in the sky, snatches Helgi's ship from the clutches of the grim sea-goddess Ran, and leads the heroes into port'. The Valkyrie fills then the function ascribed to the Dioscures by the Mediterranean peoples. In the midst of the storm she appears to them, like the Heavenly Twins, tovor5aL rTepvy eOa &amp; ' atWepoS a('avT7-e, as the Homeric Hymn expresses it, saves them from the storm and the angry waves of the ocean, and guides their ship safely to land2. There is still one important feature of the Norse Valkyries which requires explanation, viz. their connexion with the swan-maidens. The data bearing on this aspect of the Valkyrie tradition have been col- lected by Dr Golther3, and there is therefore no need to repeat them here. We may also unreservedly accept his statement: 'A Valkyrie may occasionally be a swan-maiden, but a swan-maiden is not neces- sarily a Valkyrie, but only accidentally here and there in Norse Poetry.' Various explanations have been put forward to explain this occasional connexion of Valkyries and swan-maidens. Thus W. Hertz saw the reason in the fact that the swan 'is the favourite bird of lakes and clouds5.' W. Golther held the belief in the fylgja, i.e. the hero's double appearing to him in the form of an animal or a bird, responsible for it6. Neither explanation is particularly convincing, for one fails to see why the swan should be the favourite bird of clouds, or, if Golther's sugges- tion be adopted, why wolves, bears, eagles, and hawks (to mention but a few of the animal forms generally adopted by the fylgjur) should not have taken the place of the swan in most cases. It should be noted that the swan-maiden motif is usually identical with the story of the fairy wife who deserts her husband upon the breaking of a taboo7. But the nature of the fairy wife may vary greatly. Generally speaking, she is a fairy in Ireland and France, a vila in Slavonic countries, a nightmare in Northern Germany8, and the Hindoo 1 Helgakv.

Granting, then, that the Valkyries are supernatural beings, credited with extraordinary beauty, it is but natural that sooner or later they were made to take the place of Celtic fairies or Slavonic vile, if, as is likely enough, the story of the fairy wife came to the Teutons from their neighbours, west or east. There is indeed no need to have recourse to the belief in fylgjur. It would however be erroneous to suppose that the fairy wife deserting her husband is always a swan-maiden. As a matter of fact, her forms differ widely in the various versions of this story complex. Very often no animal shape is mentioned at all2. In certain Norse and Irish versions she is a seal3, in two Arabic tales a dove4, in a Slavonic story a peahen5, in another Slavonic variant a goose6, in a third a she- wolf7. She is a vulture in an Indian tale from South Americas, a dove in a Basque9, a Catalan?", a Spanish", a Portuguese12, an Italian 3, a Bohemian14, and a Hungarian Marchen'l, a duck in a Portuguese narra- tive from Brazill6, whilst in many versions she is merely referred to as a bird'7. At the most it can be said that the swan form occurs rather frequently in tales from Northern and Western Europe; but it is not absent in Eastern and Central Europe18. At all events, it is certain that the conception of swan-maidens is very old in Northern Europe, as can be judged from an allusion of Aeschylus19; it does not belong to the folk- loristic material imported from the East in comparatively recent times. 1 Tawney-Penzer, The Ocean of Story, ii, pp. 34 ff., 245 ff. 2 Cf.

This conclusion is further borne out by the significant fact that in quite a number of tales the Valkyries appear in the shape of swans, whilst they desert their husbands in only one, the VolundarquiYa. Jacob Grimm was the first to compare the swan-shaped Valkyries with Leda and the swan-shaped Zeus1. More recently M. Salomon Reinach again pointed out the similarities existing between these figures of Norse and Mediterranean mythology2. There is indeed enough evidence to show that the swan (or goose) was somehow con- nected with the twin divinities of old. I can here refer only to a few important traits, drawing attention to the study of Dr Harris on Apollo and His Birds, forthcoming in the Bulletin of the John Rylands Library. Zeus, the father of the Spartan twins, lay with Leda in the shape of a swan; the Dioskouroi were born from an egg. According to Lucian,the Phrygian caps they wore were considered the shells of the egg3. A poem of the Augustaean period mentions a gander as Leda's mate4, and on ancient monuments the Dioscures and Helen are often accompanied by a goose5. Leda (Lada), the Phrygian name for 'woman,' 'lady,' cannot be separated from Leto (Latona), the mother of another twin couple, Apollo and Artemis. The twin Apollo, accordingly, is likewise connected with the swan. At Tenedos, Tenes, the eponymous hero, was the son of Kyknos (= the swan), who had been nursed by a swan when exposed like so many other hero children. According to another local legend of Tenedos, Apollo himself was the father of Tenos, hence the equation Apollo = Kyknos, a fact which had already struck 0. Miiller toward the middle of the last century6. Antoninus Liberalis knows of another Kyknos, a son of Apollo7. From the traditions relating the killing of a hero Kyknos by Achilles or Herakles both U. v. Wilamowitz-Moellen- dorffs and L. R. Farnell9 inferred the existence of a hero Kyknos dying 1 Deutsche Mythologie, i (1875), p. 362. 2 Cultes, Mythes et Religions, ii (Paris, 1896), pp. 42 if.; Les theoxenies et le vol des Dioscures. 3 Dial.

If we remember that in a number of instances priesthood of a divinity means identity with the divinity', we are again led to the equation Apollo = Kyknos. Through- out Classical and Hellenistic times the swan was considered as the sacred bird of Apollo2. A team of swans draws the chariot in which he comes from the Hyperboraean lands, a sure indication that the connexion of the god with the bird is not of recent date but was already in existence before the Nordic Apollo reached Hellenic soil. According to a parallel legend of the Leda myth, known to the author of the Kypria, Nemesis, when pursued by Zeus, transformed her- self into a goose3. Although this tradition has come down to us only in fragments, we are justified in inferring that in the sequel of the story Zeus, in the shape of a swan or, more probably, a gander, had inter- course with her and begot Helen and the Dioscures4. The same story was known to Tzetzes, who refers to it in his famous commentary on Lykophron5. Metamorphosis into animals very often indicates a former theriomorphic stage in the development of the divinity in question6, and the inference is that Leda-Nemesis was a goose. Lada (the form which is at the base of the Attic Leto and the Latin Latona) was unquestionably a proto-Hellenic or Western Asiatic mother-goddess. As such she is closely related with Aphrodite Ourania, of Semitic origin, whose sacred birds were swan and goose7, and with the Capi- tolian Juno, whose sacred geese played a well-known part in Roman history. There can indeed be little doubt that we are here dealing with different forms of the same divinity, carried west by the Etruscans. But to come back to the twins, it is worth noting that the Moliones8 and doubtless also the Leukippides9 were born from eggs. Nor is the egg-birth peculiar to the Hellenic twin couples alone. According to a legend current among the Guamachucos of Peru, the twins Apocatequil and Piguerao were born from two eggs deposited by their mother before her death'?.

On the Etruscan cista of Volterra Zethos, one of the Theban twins, is winged2. The Boreades are able to pursue the Harpies thanks to their ability to fly. Kastor and Polydeukes likewise are often depicted as winged, and there can be little doubt that originally they were birds3. The former bird nature of the non-Hellenic twins is equally apparent. Reference has been made to the egg-birth of the Peruvian twins. The horses of the Hindoo Agvins are called hansas, a word which in Sanscrit denotes 'swan,' goose,' or ' duck4.' The natural inference is that originally the chariot of the Vedic twins was drawn by these birds, sacred to the twin divinities, and that in a period still farther back the twin gods were themselves swans, geese, or ducks. In an ancient Gothic legend which I examined two years ago5, Svanhild is the name of the sister of a pair of Teutonic Dioscures, killed by a monster (the old King Ermanarich) and avenged by her brothers. I wish to conclude this array of facts (tedious in the extreme, I fear) with a curious survival from Mediaeval England. The voeux du paon are of course well known to all students of the European Middle Ages, and there is no need to refer to them at length here. What is note- worthy is that in England vows on swans occur. To quote Matthew of Westminster6: allati sunt in pompotica gloria duo cygni vel olores ante regem phalerati retibus aureis vel fistulis deauratis, desiderabile spectaculum intluentibus. quibus visis rex (Eduardus I, a. 1306) votum vovit deo coeli et cygnis, se proficisci in Scotiam, mortem Johannis Comyn et fidem laesam Scotorum vivus sive mortuus vindicaturus. Now it is certainly a remarkable fact that in the ancient world the Dioscures were commonly appealed to in asseverations and in contracts. Edepol and Mecastor are found time and again in writers of colloquial Latin. But in the Greek-speaking part of the Empire the same habit prevailed. When the pagan Dioscures had to go, the Christian saints took their place in regard to this as to any other function. As Dr Harris pointed out7 in the East Saint Polyeuctes replaced Polydeukes, as the avenger of perjury par excellence, and if he came to occupy the same position in Western Europe as well, the reason is that he displaced a 1 Op. cit., p. 25. 2 Ibid., p. 42. 3 Cf. the study of M.

The modern custom of swearing by Gemini is a survival of the ancient belief in the Heavenly Twins as guardians of truthfulness, a function which they acquired thanks to their sonship of the all-seeing Father Sky1 and, Dr Harris might have added, to their father's power of sending his bolt down upon the perjurer. If then in Mediaeval England vows are made upon the swan, the reason is that the swan was the bird of the Heavenly Twins and that originally the Twins were thought to make their ap- pearance in the form of swans2. The set of facts brought out in the foregoing pages and the number of which could doubtless be considerably increased, will no doubt show the correctness of M. Salomon Reinach's conclusion that the Spartan Dioskouroi were themselves birds, that is, swans or, perhaps, geese, in the oldest stratum of Hellenic religion3. In the light of the universal character of twin cults we may safely extend this conclusion to the other pairs of Heavenly Twins, the Moliones, the Leukippides, the A9vins, and some of the Teutonic twins. It will thus be found that the swan-shape of the Valkyries, which has always proved a disconcerting feature in the attempts made to penetrate to the origin of the enig- matical beings, not only does not contradict the evidence brought forward in the previous pages but bears it out most perfectly4. The swan-shape of the Valkyries no less than the electric phenomena accompanying their epiphany, their influence upon the weather, their power of fertility and their character of saviours in pericalo maris, a feature which they have in common with the Spartan Dioskouroi and the Vedic A9vins5, their kinship with the sky-god and their appellation, is most easily explainable by the assumption of their Dioscuric origin, but these various features are indeed difficult to reconcile by any other theory put forward heretofore. The question will be asked, How is it that man came to think of an especially intimate connexion between the Heavenly Twins and certain species of water-fowl? The problem puzzled Dr Harris quite as much as it had puzzled the mythologists of the older school. He rightly rejects the idea that swan and goose can be thunder-birds, and he thinks of the existence of totems as responsible for the identification6, a The Cult of the Heavenly Twins, p. 56. 2 The well-known oath of Socrates and his disciples by the goose has doubtless the same origin. 3 C.M.R., i, 56 ff. 4 It is tempting to identify the bird of one of the Alaisiages reliefs with the Dioscuric swan or goose. Yet such an identification is somewhat hazardous, as the bird may well belong to the main figure, Mars Thincsus; cf. Heinzel, op. cit., p. 54. 5 Harris, The Dioscuri, etc., p. 15. 6 Boanerges, p. 310. 70</page><page sequence="17">ALEXANDER HAGGERTY KRAPPE solution which had already occurred to M. Salomon Reinachl. I have pointed out above that the hypothesis of the older school of mythologists, which saw in clouds the tertium comparationis, is unsatisfactory because this explanation really does not explain anything. I have intentionally extended the data of bearing on the relation- ship of the birds with the Greek and Asiatic pantheon beyond the field of Dioscurism proper. Lada-Nemesis as well as Aphrodite Ourania and the Etruscan and Latin Juno are mother-goddesses, who stand for the principle of fertility, both animal and vegetable. This feature they have in common with the Heavenly Twins, and it is precisely for this reason that the former were made the mothers of the latter, just as the Asiatic Artemis, for example, is depicted with a multitude of breasts. For a reason not difficult to divine the water birds, swan, goose, and duck, always in touch with the one all important element of fecundity, were thought to be especially imbued with the fertilising powers. Hence it was that they were raised to the position of fertility daemons and later, stripped of their animal form, developed into anthropomorphic divinities, whose chief function remained the promotion of fecundity. This conjecture is borne out by the role played by water-fowl in the beliefs and religious and magical practices of many backward races. The imitation of their cries will bring rain2. According to a legend from the Far East, the swan is a girl metamorphosed into the bird when it could not obtain water from its mother3. Similar beliefs prevail among the European peasantry. In the Tyrol a bathing goose means approaching rain4. At Sauerlach, Bavaria, a curious procession used to take place on Whit-monday called the Water-Fowl. The chief figure was a horseman enclosed in a huge swan's neck and head5. There can be little doubt that, like so many other Whitsuntide processions acted by the rural population of Europe, the Water-Fowl is essentially designed to promote the growth of the crops, and the swan's mask in particular is expected to bring down the desired rain. The old English superstition that the swan cannot hatch without a peal of thunder still points to the con- nexion of the bird with the sky and the thunderstorm6. In Iceland the nightly song of the northern swan indicates rain or thaw7. The cries 1 C.M.R., II, 51 ff. 2 W. R. Halliday, Greek Divination, London, 1913, p. 257; Sir J. G.

A word must be said about the relationship of the Valkyries to the supreme god of the Teutonic Olympus. We have seen that the Alai- siages were associated with the old Teutonic sky-god, whose daughters they doubtless were. This divinity was crowded out by Othin-Wodan during the first centuries of our era. We should therefore expect the new god to take over the attributes and perhaps also the family of the old. This is precisely what we find when the Norse documents make their appearance in the Middle Ages. Othin has appropriated unto him- self the wolves which originally accompanied Tyr2, he is the husband of the earth-goddess, originally doubtless Tyr's wife, and he has likewise attracted the Valkyries, formerly Tyr's daughters. Their elevation in rank, if such it can be called, to Hebes or female Ganymedes cannot be separated from the rise of the heavenly Valhal, which has nothing primitive about it. But Tyr was not the god of the thunderstorm, he had lost this function on Thor in prehistoric times. Since the Heavenly Twins are also and primarily the sons or daughters of the thunder-god, we should only expect some of the Valkyries to accompany Thor. The case of Thorgerd and Irpa proves this expectation to be true. In the quotation from the Hdkonarmat given above I differ from J. Grimm and the editor of the Corpus poeticum Boreale in the trans- lation of the line Ggndul ok Skggul sendi Gauta tyr, which is usually rendered by The god of the Gauts sent Ggndul and Skggul. Thanks largely to the study of place-names we know now that Tyr was indeed a great god of fertility and the husband of Nerthus, the Teutonic Mother Earth, and that this ancient Tyr-cult has left numerous traces in Scandinavian heroic legend in the migration period3. I am therefore inclined to see in the line of the Hdkonarmdl a survival of a former stage, when Tyr was still the supreme sky-god and the Valkyries his daughters. The conclusions of the foregoing study may be formulated as follows: (1) The earliest extant evidence of the Valkyrie tradition are the ex-votos dedicated to the Alaisiages in the third century. 1 Keller, Thiere, p. 297. 2 Cf. chapter vi of my Studies. Cf. especially Kemp Malone, The Literary History of Hamlet, I (Heidelberg, 1923), pp. 27-28, 118, 122. 72</page><page sequence="19">ALEXANDER HAGGERTY KRAPPE (2) The Valkyries show all the characteristics and fill all the func- tions of the Heavenly Twins, sons or daughters of the sky or of the thunder: they are fertility daemons, helpers in battle and at sea; in many instances a dual name has practically displaced their individual names, and their epiphany is accompanied by electric phenomena. (3) They were originally believed to be white swans, a stage of religious development of which numerous survivals are found as late as the Viking Age. This swan-shape facilitated their becoming the heroines of Teutonic variants of the Fairy Wife tale. (4) The reason for their swan-shape must be sought in the powers of fertility, that is, of producing rain, which is attributed to swans, geese and other water-fowl. (5) The Mediaeval English vow on the swan is a late survival, indi- cating that, like the Greek and Roman Dioscures, the Valkyries had at one time been guardians of truthfulness. (6) When Othin took the place of the ancient sky-god, they became associated with the new divinity. (7) Their position in the warrior's paradise of the migration period and the Viking Age is late and the outcome of the social revolutions which swept the Teutonic world after the fourth century of our era.
