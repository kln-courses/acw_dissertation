<plain_text><page sequence="1">93 EARLY AGRICULTURAL SETTLEMENTS IN THE SINJAR PLAIN, NORTHERN IRAQ By N. Y. MERPERT and R. M. MUNCHAEV In the spring of I969 the Soviet archaeological expedition began extensive studies of early agricultural sites in north-western Iraq. Up to that time the investigation of archaeological cultures representing the early stages of development of food- producing economies in Mesopotamia had been confined to north-eastern Iraq and western Iran, the mountains of Kurdistan and the Zagros with their foothills and valleys. But in north-western Iraq, from Mosul to the Syrian frontier, there are areas whose natural resources offer an equally fruitful prospect for investigation of this process. One such area particularly favourable to agriculture from its earliest stages is the broad and fertile Sinjar plain. Eastward the plain borders on the Mosul region, beyond which lie the Kurdish foothills around Erbil and Kirkuk, and on the north it is bounded by Jebel Sinjar, rising to a height of c. 1250 m. This range reproduces on a small scale the natural conditions of the Zagros, and abounds in caves, but is as yet inadequately investigated. Winter rainfall is relatively high, and a number of small perennial streams flow from the hills into the soft alluvial soils of the plain, which are extremely fertile and favour the construction of simple irrigation systems; in places these now extend up to 15 km. south of the range.' Local conditions were thus attractive to settlers from the beginning of the period of wheat and barley cultivation, and in addition the region is well situated to encourage external cultural connections. From the earliest times the Sinjar plain has been a major highway linking Mesopotamia with Syria and the Mediterranean, and it is not surprising to find here a great concentration of sites of all periods. InI the 6o km. that separate the towns of Balad Sinjar and Tell Afar some hundreds of tells have been discovered, from the earliest agricultural settlements to numerous fortified cities of the second and first millennia B.C. which protected the western approaches of the Assyrian kingdom, and in particular its last and greatest capital, Nineveh. In comparison with other regions of Mesopotamia the Sinjar plain has not been adequately explored. Archaeological investigation was first undertaken here in the late thirties of this century, under the direction of Professor Seton Lloyd, who identified more than 200 sites and conducted limited excavations on single sites of relatively late date. On the basis of excavated material he distinguished twelve chronological groups among the pottery found on survey. Of these Group I, the At the invitation of the British Academy Dr. Rauf Munchaev visited London in 1973, and lectured on the excavations at Yarim Tepe. The Editors of Iraq are glad to acknowledge a generous contribution from the British Academy, which has enabled them to ensure a swift publication of this paper, and thereby to bring to English readers the results of these important excavations, which have previously been published in Soviet archaeological journals.

MUNCHAEV most ancient, he compared with wares of Samarra and Nineveh II, i.e. with the latter part of the Hassuna period, which had not then been identified.2 Group 2 he associated with the Halaf culture, noting that sites of this phase are extremely rare in the region by contrast with their frequency east of the Tigris; 3 'Ubaid sites were found to be numerous. In the past twenty years investigation of the area has been continued by David and Joan Oates. The number of known sites has more than doubled, and material has been found that might be related to the Jarmo culture of the seventh millennium B.C., one of the earliest stages in the development of agriculture.4 But excavation has again been confined to relatively late sites, notably the second millennium town of Tell al Rimah, and the third millennium town at Tell Taya, excavated by Dr. Julian Reade.5 No early agricultural settlements have been investigated, and the Soviet archaeological expedition set out to remedy this onmission. As tlle prime objective of our work we selected a group of tells situated IO km. soutlh-west of Tell Afar and locally known as Yarim Tepe (Turkish " Half-mound "), because one of the tells has been cut away by a brook that has changed its channel.,6 There are in all six mounds forming a compact group less than i km. in extent. Three of these are of considerable size and have produced abundant material to show that they severally represent settlements of three of the most important early agricultural cultures of northern Mesopotamia, Hassuna, Halaf and 'Ubaid. DuLrinig the first three seasons, from I969 to I971, excavation has been concentrated oni two of these, Yarim Tepe I and II, respectively of Hassuna and Halaf date. Yarim Tepe I Yarim Tepe I, the extreme eastern mound of the group, is located at a distance of 250 m. from the west bank of the brook, here called Joubara Diariasi. It has a maximum diameter of IOO m. and rises 4.5 m. above present field level, and the surface pottery is wholly of Hassuna type with the exception of a few casual sherds. Investigation of the mound and its surroundings, and in particular the cutting of a trenclh down the slope for stratigraphic purposes, revealed that the occupations levels extend leyond the apparent limits of the mound at a depth of I 5 m. or more below the prcsent surface of the surrounding fields, and that the total depth of deposit cxceeds 6 m. Clearly there has been a rise in the level of the surrounding land, associated with a rise in the water table. At the period of its maximum extension the area of the settlement reached 2 hectares, and its dimensions are thus closely comparable with those of the type site. The elevation of Tell Hassuna I above the bed-rock of' the neighbouring stream is 7 m., but the actual depth of Hassuna 2 S. Lloyd, op. cit., I28 n. 3Ibid., 124-26.

Of the fifteen building levels identified at Hassuna five belonged wholly to the Hassuna period and Halaf pottery made its first appearance in the sixth. In Yarim Tepe I the whole deposit is of the Hassuna culture, and in the stratigraphic trench eight major building levels, each incorporating several sub-phases, have been distinguished; although there are a number of graves and storage pits of later periods, no trace of later occupation levels was found.8 Excavation began in the eastern sector of the mound and by the end of the third season i ,440 sq. m. had been exposed; work proceeded on a grid of IO m. squares 9 with intermediate baulks at intervals of 2 *5 m. to ensure a complete stratigraphic record of the relationship between all major building complexes and the minor alterations and additions that were made to them. In defining successive " levels " of occupation we have relied on such structural relationships, observed both in the foundations, walls and associated floors of individual buildings and the gypsum surfaces of the open spaces between them; these are discussed in more detail below. Each of the levels represents a considerable lapse of time, and is marked by con- sistency in the overall layout of some large units despite modifications of detail which are often extremely complex. The transition from one level to another is, conversely, characterized by a contemporary replanning of large units in different parts of the settlement, although it may be bridged by other units. These transitional units were often those founded in the later phases of one level, and survive into the next with, at most, some internal reconstruction. Other lesser evidences of structural continuity are found, the reuse of individual rooms or even single walls within a unit, or the levelling of a structure that is then packed with debris to provide a solid foundation for its successor. It must therefore be emphasized that the precise definition of building levels may vary from unit to unit, and that the detailed sequences sometimes have only a local validity. Level i (0-0 o 7 m. below datum). The uppermost building level is represented only by isolated patches on broken walling immediately below the surface on the crest of the mound; on the flanks it has been entirely destroyed by erosion and ploughing. Only in squares 37 and 47 can fragments of a coherent plan be discerned, representing a multi-room complex not less than I5 m. in overall length, aligned from north to south and with an open courtyard adjoining, of which only a small area on the west side is preserved. Within the complex can be traced a rectangular room 3 5 by 2 * 5 m., apparently living quarters, two subsidiary chambers 2 * 5 m. square and parts of two other rectangular rooms; in one of the rooms were the remains of a round kiln. Levels 2 and 3 (o 7-I *0 m. and I O-I .4 m. below datum) within the excavated area seem to reflect earlier versions of the Level I plan, although some reconstruc- tions were observed. Structural remains of these levels occurred in most squares but "The number of building levels can only be determined finally after the excavation of con- siderable areas of the settlement, and will no doubt be greater in the centre of the mound than in the stratigraphic trench. Level 8, reached here in I971, is not the earliest. The levels are numbered from top to bottom. 9 Numbered from I to ioo, increasing from west to east and north to south.</page><page sequence="4">96 N. Y. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV their state of preservation was again poor; particularly in the central sector they were badly damaged not only by erosion but by later burials and domestic rubbish pits of varying date. Square 47 was a rectangular rooin of the same dimensions, 3-5 by 2 5 m., and approximately in the same position as the Level i room already referred to, with an oven in its south-west corner. A door in the north wall gave access to an internal courtyard, and on this side there were also subsidiary structures, including very small store-rooms, I .5 by I-2 m. and I o by 0 7 m., and a blind alley 50 cm. wide and at least 3 0 m. long. The living room was connected by another doorway to a second room of the same length but only I 5 m. in width, from which an external door opened southwards on to a passage over 4 0 m. wide. The passage separated this unit from its neighbour, of which a pair of rooms, each 3 5 by 3 in m., was uncovered in square 57. At this time the central part of the settlement was intensively occupied. In square 46 was found a complex of structures including small rectangular store-rooms, I * 5 by I *o m., as well as long corridors, 4 o by I 5 m. One of these corridors led to a round over of tandir type, and in the other a large jar for the storage of grain or water, 70 cm. in height and diameter, had been let into the floor and packed around with stones. Ovens were found both in the rooms and in the small internal courtyards. One observation of especial interest may be made here, although it applies to all the upper levels. The passages and open spaces that separated the buildings had been repeatedly surfaced with gypsum plaster to form a kind of road surface. In square 57 between Levels 3 and 4 there were five such plastered surfaces, each 2-3 cm. thick, at intervals of 4-8 cm., and similar sequences have been found in Level 5. Equating these surfaces with the associated structures has enabled us to establish a " microstratigraphy ", giving a framework of relatively short sub-phases for the dating of both buildings and finds. The discovery also reflects a high degree of organization in the measures taken by the community to cope with the rainy climate of this part of Mesopotamia in the winter and spring months. Level 4 was again seriously disturbed by later pits and graves, but structural remains have been found in eight squares (Plate XXXVI), and throw light on specific features of the development of the eastern half of the settlement at this time. In two areas, the south-west corner of square 57 and the middle of squares 37, 47, and 48 were found at least thirteen large round kilns, originally domed, some of which were more than 2 o m. in diameter. They were situated outside the houses, although they may have been sheltered by some flimsy structure, and clearly served some industrial purpose, probably the firing of pottery. 10 Near the kilns were several round or oval pits, up to 50 cm. across and I o 0 m. long, filled with ashes and charcoal, and beside the kiln in square 57 was a well-preserved trough-like construction of clay, oval in shape and I 5 m. long by 50 cm. wide. Not all of the kilns were in use at the same time, but their arrangement in groups, sometimes marked off by boundary walls, suggests that this was an established industrial quarter, and indeed Level 5 kilns were found in the same area. The central group of kilns was flanked on the north, east and south by large houses, each with several rooms. The most characteristic is Complex 7, in squares 48 and 58. 10 This is confirmed by the discovery of kiln-wasters nearby.</page><page sequence="5">PLATE XXXVI 27, 23',S 3 7 __ _ ____ _________------ --l | r - - - - - - - - - ~-~ - r - 39 AMAl 47 A m I IMA S I AA A I i17~~~~~~~~~M .

In one of the rooms there was a round oven of tandir type (Plate XLb), in front of which a stone mortar for pounding grain had been plastered into a clay base. This house originally contained not less than six rooms, and measured at least 8 o by 5 o m. overall. Farther to the north, in squares 38 and 28, the houses of this level slope downhill, indicating that the site was already a mound, and in two other areas we found evidence of the architectural continuity between levels that has been men- tioned above. In the north-eastern sector, squares 27 and 37, the main features of a layout already elaborated in Level 5 were preserved in Level 4, while in the central area, square 47, the buildings of Level 5 survived into the early phase of Level 4, but were then superseded by a quite different, almost circular structure. This building IO m. in diameter, with the stubs of internal partitions surviving against the inner face of the perimeter wall (Plate XLa); it directly adjoins the southern group of kilns, and presumably served some special function, though there are no relevant parallels on known Hassuna sites; it affords an instance of the variety and complexity of Hassuna architecture."' Level 5. None of the later graves and few of the pits penetrated to the fifth building level, which has consequently yielded a relatively complete picture of the layout of the settlement (Plate XXXVII). In this respect it may be compared with Level 5 at Hassuna itself, which was far better preserved than the other levels and also yielded basic information about the planning and construction of the settlement.12 In Yarim Tepe I the house-walls were preserved to a height of more than I m., and from the structural evidence we were able to plan units in detail and to identify the stages of their development, from the initial nucleus through the later additions. This yielded not only the history of individual complexes but also a picture of the development of whole areas. In the I,400 sq. m. so far exposed 13 no less than 12 large buildings have come to light, all of them containing numbers of rooms, and certain common elements of planning can be discerned. The initial nuclei were regularly disposed in relation to one another, often with their long axes parallel, and separated by open spaces in the form of passages or small courts, plastered with gypsum. But the growth of the population and the subdivision of families into separate units brought about a parallel elaboration of the house plans,14 and to the original nuclei were added new areas both for functional and living purposes. Space for these was gained by encroachment on the passages, courts and blind alleys, some of which were roofed to serve as rooms. Some separate units merged, density of occupation constantly increased, and the consequent obliteration of the original layout was one of the factors that imposed the need for radical replanning and a new building level. This complex picture of the evolution of a whole area has been built up by the observation of architectural details such as unbonded joints between walls, differences in the level of their foundations and floors, and the relation between structural additions 11 Round buildings are known from Hassuna, Level Ic, but they are very different from ours in size and, apparently, in purpose. JNES 4, 272 and fig. 28. "' Ibid., 274-75- 13 The remains of buildings of Level 5 have been discovered throughout the area so far exposed, with the exception of the stratigraphic trench. 14 A similar extension of the houses can also be observed in modern Arab villages in Iraq; H. J. Nissen, Sumer 24 (1968), 107.</page><page sequence="8">98 N. Y. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV and the sequence of replastering in the courts and passages. The history of doorways has proved particularly revealing, since they usually lead from the living rooms into passages and courtyards and the provision of a new doorway marks the final stage in the creation of a dwelling unit designed to house a new family. Most of the structures seem to have been intended for domestic purposes. As a rule one of the rooms of each house contained an oven; it was usually the largest, with doorways leading to the open air, rarely into other rooms. This may be confidently identified as the principal living room, with the other smaller chambers serving subsidiary functions, principally the storage of food. These had no ovens, and sometimes lacked doorways; in such cases they may have been bins with access over the top of low partitions or from the flat roof of the buildings, in the manner known from other early agricultural settlements in the Near East 15 and also modern villages in Northern Iraq. Usually in the room containing the oven, or in a chamber directly accessible from it, there was a massive stone mortar for pounding grain, let into the floor and wedged in position with large sherds and stones which were then plastered over. Even when the ovens were located in small open courtyards, the mortars and grinding stones were placed under cover. Some buildings, however, yielded no ovens or mortars, nor any of the usual debris of domestic occupation, and these must be excluded from the category of living quarters. The best example is a structure in the north-east corner of the settlement (Complex i), 6 m. wide and not less than i6 m. long overall, oriented from east to west. It contained at least 14 rooms arranged in two rows, of which 12 are of consistent size, 2 -4 by 2-0 m., while the two rooms at the east end are somewhat smaller, 2 o by I-5 m. There was only one doorway, opening into the south-west corner room, and the whole buildings looks like a storehouse with, to judge by its size, some communal function. It was originally separated from the main residential area to the south by a passage more than 2 m. wide, but later additions to the dwelling houses narrowed it to i m. or even 70 cm. It should be noted that Complex I itself resulted from the reconstruction of the north-west sector in the later phase of Level 5; in the earlier phase of the same level its site had been occupied by a house of the normal type. South of the passage lay three other multi-room complexes, nos. 2, 3 and 4. The first two were separated by a north-south passage which was later partitioned into rooms; the original entrances to both complexes were blocked. Complex 4, which existed from a late phase of Level 5 into early Level 4, affords an unusually complete picture of the process of development. It was an irregular quadrilateral some 7 by 6 m., with two ranges of three rooms on the north side terminating in a single long room at the east end. The rooms in the north range varied from I 25 to I *5 m. by i - I to I *2m. and were interconnected. These in the southern range were slightly larger, but only the south-east room had a doorway, leading into the courtyard that occupied the southern half of the complex. The long east room, 3 5 by I*o m., also opened off the courtyard, and contained an oven and mortar. The courtyard originally measured 6 * o by 2 5 m. but was later subdivided by a partition wall, and a store-room about I -2 m. square was built in the south-east corner. On the west of the courtyard was an open space, plastered with gypsum, 15J.

Four of these, nos. 5-9, comprising not less than 15 rooms, were fused together by later additions to form a virtually separate unit divided only by internal courtyards. On the east this unit was separated by a passage from the continuation of the residential area, in which a characteristic complex is no. I0, in squares 48 and 58. The nucleus of this complex, some IO by 6 m. and aligned from north-west to south-east, was laid out in the transitional phase between Levels 6 and 5 and consisted of ten or twelve rooms with average dimensions of I 6 by I 5 m. The north-west room, however, was double this size and obviously contained the oven, although it was badly damaged by later construction. There were originally open spaces on the east and south, but the addition of two rooms and boundary walls surrounding courtyards, one with an oven, brought the eastern space within the confines of the unit. The southern space was similarly fenced in, with a number of new rooms around it, one again containing an oven. This addition was sufficiently important to require a change in the plan of the original nucleus, one of whose walls was displaced to make way for it, and both afford excellent examples of the elabora- tion of an original plan that resulted from the subdivision of family units. A similar process can be observed in Complex no. I I, immediately to the north. The nucleus, 6 by 2 5 m. and again oriented from north-west to south-east, also dates from the Level 6-5 transitional phase. It contained four rooms, but the entrance is unusual in Hassuna buildings, consisting of a passage 4 3 m. long and 70 cm. wide with an entrance at the north end and an inner doorway leading into the north side of one of the rooms. Half-way through Level 5 annexes were added to the east and south sides of the nucleus, which underwent a general reconstruction before the end of this building phase; some walls and partitions were moved, doorways were blocked and a large rectangular oven was built on the site of one of the southern annexes. At the beginning of Level 4 further drastic changes were made. Partition walls were demolished and part of the rooms themselves were filled up to provide a solid foundation for new construction. The outer walls of the house were also rebuilt, but their outline was not substantially altered; the general plan of the nucleus thus survived for the beginning of Level 5 to the end of Level 4. Evidence of Level 5 building activity has also been observed in the northern sector of the settlement, west of Complex I, where the remains of multi-room houses, with elaborate alterations and additions, have come to light; and we have noted above that the alleys and open spaces of Level 5 were frequently replastered with gypsum. Level 6 presents a no less complicated structural history in the 400 sq. m. so far investigated (Plate XXXVIII, squares 17, 27, 37, 47). One complex of great interest is no. 15 in square 47. It is io m. long and up to 4 m. wide, with a pair of living rooms each 2 5 by 2 0 m. at the south end. In the eastern room was found a vaulted oven, with a firing shaft opening through the partition wall into the next chamber. North of this nucleus were added domestic quarters that produced an accumulation of grinding stones, pestles, sherds of thick-walled storage jars and animal bones. At the north end of this unit was an interesting cellular structure of eight or nine rounded compartments, hollowed out of a stamped clay layer and designed to hold pottery or gypsum containers for foodstuffs. Similar structures, one of semi-circular plan and about 2 m. in diameter, adjoined the east side of the unit,</page><page sequence="10">100 N. Y. MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV while on the west were large open courtyards.'6 The second large complex of Level 6, no. i6, was explored in squares 37 and 27. The nucleus was a rectangle 8 by 3 m., divided into the rooms with interconnecting doorways. The suite was entered by a door in the west wall of the southernmost room, which had an open hearth shielded by clay screens in the north-east corner. In the middle roonm an unusual structure adjoined the west wall, consisting of a rectangular plastered surface, 48 by 35 cm., slightly below floor level and surrounded by a raised clay lip, with a second similar platform a little above it to one side. These may represent the emplacement for a large grinding stone and the working space in front of it. The third, northern room was certainly a kitchen. In the north-east corner was a well- preserved oven, 65 by 6o cm. at the base, with a dome 20 cm. thick and 33 cm. high. There was an opening in the top, as is normal in tandir type ovens, and also an ash-vent at the base. In the west wall of the kitchen there was a second external doorway. All these structures were associated with the earliest house floor of Level 6 but the floor was then repeatedly raised to keep pace with the overall accumulation of occupation debris on the site and corresponding changes took place in the internal arrangements. The oven, which had been founded at 3 25 m. below datum, was partly dismantled and filled in, and another constructed on a new floor 30 cm. above and obstructing the west door of the room, which was now blocked. Later, but still within Level 6, the floor was raised by a further I5 cm. and the oven again removed, this time to the north-west corner. Finally the whole suite was packed with the debris of its own walls, thus preserving their lower parts, and used as the foundation for Level 5 construction. In general, the buildings of Level 6 exhibit some distinctive features, notably the cellular structures which held storage vessels, but the principles and techniques of construction have much in common with Level 5, notably the use of rectangular multi-roomed pise buildings as the nuclear units. The buildings of Levels 7 and 8, however, show marked differences even in the limited area so far exposed (square 47), and are clearly associated with the earliest development of the settlement and of the Hassuna culture. The rectangular buildings are smaller and simpler in plan than in the later levels, with thinner walls and no trace of plaster. Most important, they are found together with round structures; for instance, in Level 8 a two-roomed rectangular house, I0 by 2 5 m., was almost surrounded by a number of round buildings up to 2 5 m. in diameter with, originally, conical roofs. In one of these were found three crouched human skeletons, but the others yielded no trace of burials and there is no reason to suppose that they were funerary structures. The question of their purpose and the functional difference between them and the rectangular houses is still unsolved, but their relative frequency in the early levels is of great significance,"7 for they represent the continua- tion of a wide-spread and ancient Near Eastern tradition which originated when the brushwood shelters of nomadic hunters were translated into the first permanent dwellings. Round houses, either semi-subterranean or constructed of clay and stone 16 Similar round structures were found in Level ic at Hassuna; see n. ii above. The authors of the Hassuna report suggest that the open courtyards were used as cattle enclosures at night. 17 As noted above, round structures at Hassuna are found only in the earliest phase of the settlement, Level i c.</page><page sequence="11">PLATE XXXVIII 16 17 is _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ _ 25 27_ ES 36 37 3&gt; _~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ ._ norp86-~~ 57 58 Yarim Tepe I.

The later appearance of rectangular houses is in many of these cases stratigraphically attested, at Mureybit,18 Beidha,'9 Ramad,20 Jericho lb 21 and Ganj-i-Dareh.22 On the other hand in certain areas, notably southern Turkey,23 the rectangular house tradition has been shown by recent investigations to be very ancient, and it is not surprising to find the two types coexisting on several of these sites at certain periods, e.g. Beidha Level 4 and Ganj-i-Dareh I; we postulate a similar explanation for their simultaneous use in the lower levels of Yarim Tepe I. In the later Hassuna culture the rectangular house type was dominant, while in other cultures the round plan continued to develop and remained the principal house form, most characteristic of the Halaf culture; many Halaf examples were found in the excavation of our second mound, Yarim Tepe II, and will be described below. One other unusual architectural feature of the lowest levels of Yarim Tepe I should be mentioned here, a clay platform about i m. high that was found in Level 7, square 47, near the middle of the settlement. It had been pounded flat and the base was faced with cakes of clay; it served as the foundation for some domestic structure, probably a granary. Architecture andfurnishings-general observations The buildings of the six upper levels of Yarim Tepe I, taken as a whole, illustrate the elaborate overall planning and organization of the settlement as well as relatively sophisticated structural techniques which reflect a developed tradition of domestic architecture. All these levels are characterized by large rectangular houses of several rooms.24 The walls of the houses and the vaults of the large ovens were built of compact clay blocks, and in some individual buildings we have been able to detect a regular pattern in the laying of these blocks as well as approximate uniformity of size. This suggests that the development of standard units leading at a late stage to the use of sun-dried bricks, took place within the context of Hassuna building techniques. The outer walls of the houses were massive, usually 45-50 cm. thick, and were often reinforced by buttresses at the angles and opposite the junctions of internal partitions. Such buttresses are typical of Samarra architecture, and later became a characteristic feature of Sumerian buildings. The authors of the Hassuna report assert that they served not only to strengthen the walls but to support the beams that 18 M. N. van Loon and J. H. Skinner, JNES 27 (I968), 267-75. DI .

MUNCHAEV carried the flat or low-pitched roofs.25 The method of roofing, with poles laid across the beams and covered with reed matting and finally a thick layer of clay, is universal in village houses in the area to the present day. The floors of the houses are of hard- packed earth, often speckled with ash and charcoal; floors as well as walls were sometimes coated with clay plaster, and instances of a more elaborate technique have been found, e.g. in House 89, Levels 5-4, in which the plaster was laid on matting which rested in turn on a bed of small stones and sherds. A standard feature of doorways, known also from Hassuna, is the provision of a high still of clay, often surfaced with large sherds. In another house, no. go, clay benches were found against the wall of one room.286 Ovens and kilns Among the best-preserved and most characteristic elements of domestic equipment are the ovens, used for baking bread and also for heating in the cold north Mesopotamian winters. A number of different types have been found throughout the excavated levels, but they fall broadly into two categories, round or almost rectangular. Among the latter are open hearths with high walls, and vaulted ovens with an aperture taking up almost the whole of one end wall. A well-preserved example of the vaulted oven was found in house no. 57, Level 5; it measured over I m. long, 8o cm. wide and the vault was 30 cm. high. The round ovens include open ring-shaped hearths, tandirs with an upper aperture and probably also an ash-vent near the base, as well as the cupola-shaped ovens with side apertures; large pottery kilns of the cupola type are up to 2 m. in diameter and consequently cannot have had an upper aperture for access. A well-preserved tandir was found in building no. 86 (Level 5; Plate XLb). It was I 45 m. in diameter and 50 cm. high, with walls I8 cm. thick; the floor was well plastered with clay, on which were strewn small stones to improve heat retention, and outside the aperture was a small pit to facilitate removal of the ashes. Another oven of the same type was found in Complex I5 in Level 6.27 The most notable discovery, however, were the two-stage pottery kilns found in I97I, in Level 5, square 48, and another in Level 7, square 47. The latter has an internal diameter of i 2 m. and is relatively well preserved (Plate XLc). The combustion chamber was sunk into the ground, and roofed with a massive plate of clay up to I0 cm. thick, pierced by some 50 apertures, I5 cm. across, which con- ducted hot air into the domed upper stage containing the pots to be fired. Hitherto the first occurrence of such sophisticated two-stage kilns has been ascribed to the Uruk period, and even to its latest Jemdet Nasr phase, which the Yarim Tepe example antedates by at least 2,000 years. 25JNES 4, 275. 28 Similar doorsills and benches have been noted at Hassuna; JNES 4, 274. 27 In Hassuna the earliest ovens in the shape of " a simple clay barrel tipped towards the ground at an angle of 30? " were found in Level ib; JNES 4, 267. In the later levels vaulted ovens similar to those of Yarim Tepe I are widespread. The authors of the report call them " bread ovens " and remark that " they are only slightly different from the modern Arab lanouir "; ibid., 262, 272, 275, etc. Similar ovens are known from settlements of the Samarra culture. At Matarrah an open hearth was found; JNES Ix, 7. At Tell es-Sawwan vaulted ovens have been dis- covcred, including large kilns for firing pottery.</page><page sequence="15">EARLY AGRICULTURAL SETTLEMENTS IN THE SINJAR PLAIN, NORTHERN IRAQ I03 Burials In the area so far excavated six burials of infants have been discovered within the houses. Four of them belong to Level 5, one in a small pit beneath a doorsill, two beneath the floor and the fourth in a recess cut in a wall to receive it. In the last case the skeleton lay on a sherd from a large jar and the recess was blocked by another sherd. One burial was found in Level 4; two newborn children, probably twins, were interred in a small pit dug for the purpose beneath the floor of a room. The sixth grave, also beneath a room floor,was found in Level 7. In all cases the skeletons were contracted, lying on the right side with the head to the east or south. The practice of infant burial beneath house floors was widespread among early agricultural populations, including the earliest Mesopotamian cultures.28 The cultural assemblage (i) Pottery The habitation levels of Yarim Tepe I yielded a large quantity of material, principally pottery, which adds substantially to our knowledge of this most important aspect of Hassuna material culture. Considerable light has been thrown on the earliest Mesopotamian wares by the seventh millennium settlement ofJarmo in the mountains of Iraqi Kurdistan. In the five upper levels (Jarmo II) primitive but recognizable wares made their appearance, superseding a pre-pottery assemblage.29 A similar situation can be observed at Tepe Guran (Luristan)30 and at Ali Kosh in the Deh Luran plain of south-western Iran.31 Pottery of Jarmo type has now been discovered over a wide area of the Zagros mountain region, e.g. Tepe Sarab,32 as well as peripheral sites on the plain, notably Tamerkhan.33 It marks the first known stage in the development of pottery in regions bordering on Mesopotamia; the second stage is represented by the Hassuna culture in northern, and Samarra in central, Mesopotamia. These evince highly developed and widespread ceramic traditions in the plain, linked to some extent with those of the Zagros.34 Pottery of Hassuna type was first found at the bottom of the deep sounding at Kuyunjik (Nineveh),35 in levels I and Ila, but its systematic study was possible only after the excavation of Hassuna itself had produced a much richer assemblage.36 The excavators here distinguished four principal groups, which they called " Coarse Neolithic " (Level I), " Archaic" (Ib-2), " Standard " (3-6) and " Samarra " (Level 3 and above). The same classification has more recently been 28 At Hassuna, from Level i b onwards, I 2 infant burials in jars were discovered, one a pair of twins; JNES 4, 263, 267-68. At Tell es-Sawwan many infants were buried in shallow gypsum-lined pits in the corners of rooms; Sumer 2I, 24. At the same settlement, in Buildings i and 2 of Level i, more than I30 crouched skeletons, almost all children, were buried in narrow oval graves beneath the floors, accompanied by a rich inventory; ibid., 23, and K. A. Al-Adami, Sumer 14 (1968), 57. Isolated adult burials were also found at Hassuna; JNES 4, 267, 272. But no cemetery of the Hassuna culture has yet been discovered. 29 R. J. Braidwood and B.

MERPERT AND R. M. MUNCHAEV retained and elaborated by Dr. Takey Dabbagh,37 and it is in general confirmed by the evidence from Yarim Tepe I. The great majority of pottery discovered here in Levels i to 6 belongs to the Hassuna Standard group, with an admixture of the imported Samarra style, but in Level 6 sherds with the gloss and burnished red paint of the Archaic group began to appear, and in the lowest level of the stratigraplhic trench we found specimens of the Coarse Neolithic wares. Among the Hassuna Standard wares the most characteristic Yarim Tepe I shapes are: (i) Open bowls witlh rounded or flat bases and a curved or sharply carinated transition to straight sides, terminating in straight or everted rims.38 (ii) Jars with flat or rounded bases, globular bodies and cylindrical or, more rarely, flaring necks (Plate XLI, I-3).39 (iii) Jars with flat or rounded bases and sides with a straight or ogival profile; some very large examples were clearly used for the storage of grain (Plate XLI, 5-6).40 (iv) High, flat-bottomed and straight-sided beakers.41 Also worthy of special mention are the large oval trays of coarse ware, with thick sides and ribbed bases. The excavators of Hassuna suggest that these were used in winnowing to remove the husks of wheat and barley.42 Sherds of these trays lhave been found at all levels in association, as at Hassuna, with both Archaic and Standard wares. The decoration of the pottery from Yarim Tepe I is in the main characteristic of Hassuna Standard ware. By contrast with the Archaic material, decorated only by painting and burnishing, it includes three types of ornament, painted, incised, and a combination of painting and incision.43 The incised ornament is found on the bowls and, more commonly, the jars. It is executed with a thin stone or bone blade, usually occupies much of the surface of the vessel and employs geometric motifs, lines, chevrons, " fir-tree " designs and triangles with oblique cross-hatching. Painted ornament occurs on vessels of almost all shapes, and is applied in a range of colours from deep red through pink and brown to black over a light grey, cream or pink slip. The most common painted motifs are oblique cross-hatching, sometimes in opposed panels, bands, chevrons, solid triangles and " caterpillars ". Painted and incised ornament has been met with on bowls and jars. The usual combinations are incised and painted triangles with incised and painted bands, painted oblique cross-hatching with the incised " fir-tree " pattern and painted solid triangles with incised hatched triangles. Incision on the outside of a vessel is sometimes combined with painting on the inside. 3 Takey Dabbagh, Sumer 21 ( 1965), 93. 38 Ibid., Plate I, types 2-4; Plate 1I, types 20-22, 24-35- 39 Ibid., Plate IV, types 53-64. 40 Ibid., Plate I, type I5; Plate 11, type 36; Plate III, types 43-45. 41 Ibid., Plate 1II, type 42. 42 JNES 4, 262. 43JNES 4, 279.</page><page sequence="17">PLATE XL 0Wi.k. 0 LS .&gt; _ !t _0itbA VA~~~~~~~~~~ Cd .. _.j_ o] + ................................ s . i ;~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~........

Some sherds decorated in two colours, red and chocolate brown, should be mentioned as a rare exception to the usual monochrome.45 One painted vessel is of very unusual shape, resembling a bivalve shell with a narrow neck in the centre of the carination and an orifice at one corner; a similar pot was found at Hassuna.46 In the lowest levels so far excavated, 7 and 8, the pottery shows some features that distinguish it from the later material. Although the repertoire of shapes and the techniques of decoration show an overall consistency that confirms the essential unity of the sequence represented by this settlement, incised ornament is less common, paint colours are more vivid and the combination of painting and incision, common in the late levels, is completely absent from Levels 7 and 8. At the same time we find vessels with a glossy red surface, a wide red band beneath the rim, rows of pecked incision or applique horseshoe motifs which disappear entirely from Level 6 onwards.47 The absence of Samarran pottery in the lowest levels is a most significant fact; it is not found until Level 6 or even, perhaps, the transition from 6 to 5. The active impact of Samarra culture from central Mesopotamia was clearly an important landmark in the development of Hassuna settlements, apparent not only in the spread of its characteristic pottery but also in the changes we have observed in the layout of the settlement, in the form of houses and in building techniques. Another phenomenon that coincided with this development is the first appearance in the Level 6-5 transitional phase of extremely interesting anthropomorphic figurines, discussed in more detail below. (2) Tools and ornaments Tools include knives, other cutting implements and sickle blades of flint or, more often, obsidian, as well as mortars, pestles, querns and hammers of crystalline rock; it should be noted that none of the large hoes characteristic of Hassuna has yet been found. Among other implements are bone awls, needles (Plate XLII, 7), polishers and handles, sometimes decorated, as well as clay spindle whorls and " sling bullets " (Plate XLII, 5).48 Small articles worthy of mention are the stone toilet sticks (Plate XLII, 8), some superbly fashioned large beads of marble and chalcedony,49 44 Samarran pottery has been the subject of much discussion since its first discovery in I91 I (E. Herzfeld, Die Ausgrabungen von Samarra, Band V: Die Vorge- schichtlichen Topfereien von Samarra). I t has been related to the Hassuna complex (R. J. Braidwood et al., INES 3 (I 944), 65) and suggested by Braidwood in his prefatory remarks to the Hassuna report to be the product of specialized travelling craftsmen. Lloyd and Safar (J7NES 4, 282) regard it as either a deriva- tive of Hassuna or a direct import from outside, and the last suggestion may now be considered proven. The excavations at Tell es-Sawwan and Choga Mami have proved the existence in central Mesopotamia of the Samarran culture, akin to that of Hassuna and at times in close contact with it, but undoubtedly independent. 45 At Hassuna only one similar sherd was found; JNES 4, 28I . 46 Iraq Museum, Baghdad, no. IM 50267. 4 At Hassuna these ornamental elements are characteristic only of the lower levels; JNES 4, fig. 6. 48 These " sling pellets " were very numerous. Their purpose seems to be controversial. Safar suggests that they might be heated in the ashes and used as pot-boilers; JNES 4, 267. 49 Similar beads have been found at Hassuna; cf. INES 4, Plate XI, X and 2.

Of outstanding importance is the discovery in Level 7, square 47, of a bead rolled from thin sheet copper. There is no possible doubt of its stratigraphic position, for it lay beside the two stage kiln described above, in a deposit sealed by several house floors of Levels 6 and 5, and must consequently be assigned to the early phase both of the Yarim Tepe I settlement and of the Hassuna culture; it may therefore be regarded as the earliest metal artifact yet found in Mesopotamia. (3) Figurines Of special interest is the group of clay female figurines, of which 38 pieces have so far been found, (Plate XLIII, i-io). Most of them came from Level 5 and represent a well developed and clearly defined type, a standing figure with a high conical coiffure or head-dress, oblong eyes set obliquely, a narrow waist, hips of exaggerated breadth and vestigial legs; symmetrical breasts are sometimes schematically modelled, and the figurines are decorated with horizontal incised bands. A painted figurine, a small seated figure and a tiny head with almond-shaped eyes in relief were found in the upper levels.50 One figure has a grain of wheat beside one of her eyes, demonstrating the association of the whole group with the cult of fertility and the image of the Mother Goddess. Another find of particular interest from a Level 5 room is a unique terra-cotta object in the shape of a cigar, terminating at one end in a sharp cone painted with ochre, at the other in a ram's head (Plate XLIII, 9); the body is pierced with regular holes, suggesting that it was a musical instrument or whistle. At the same time its general shape implies a phallic symbolism and, again, some relationship with a fertility cult, with which the ram's head might also be associated.51 Evidence for the economy The economic basis of life in Yarim Tepe I was clearly an already advanced combination of agriculture and animal husbandry, both of which are well docu- mented. For agriculture we have the direct evidence of numerous grains of two varieties of wheat, Triticum aestivum G. and Triticum Spelta, and of multi-row barley, Hordeum vulgare G.,52 as well as the indirect testimony of sickle blades, mortars and hand mills and the specialized storage complexes witlhin the houses; it is in any case implied by the permanent character of the settlements. The evidence for animal husbandry is equally definite. Together with the bones of wild animals, gazelle, wild ox, wild boar, hare and other species, we have numerous and unquestionable examples of domesticated goat, sheep, pig and, most important, cattle.53 The 50 This is the largest collection of figurines strictly assignable to the Hassuna culture that has yet come to light. From Hassuna itself there are a few figurines, and many fine examples have been found at the contemporary Samarran settlements. Tell es-Sawwan, F. El-Wailly and B.

Chronology of the settlement Numerous specimens of carbonized wood and grain from different levels have been submitted for radio-carbon dating, but in anticipation of the results we may offer a preliminary assessment of the chronology. Yarim Tepe I represents the whole period of development of the Hassuna culture beginning with the coarse pottery phase,54 and it is important to note that this period ended before the flowering, probably even before the first appearance, of the Halaf culture in this region. This is demonstrated by the discovery of the Halaf cemetery, dug into the already deserted Hassuna settlement which thus affords a terminus ante quem for the Hassuna occupation and casts serious doubt on the synchronous development of the Hassuna and Halaf cultures that has been suggested on the basis of isolated radio-carbon dates. More- over, any suspicion that this might represent only the late phase of Halaf is effectively disproved by the existence of a massive, 8 m. thick accumulation of stratified material on the nearby mound, Yarim Tepe II, which is exclusively of the Halaf culture and embodies several phases of its development, including the earliest. The lower chronological limit of the Hassuna culture has usually been tied to the end of the preceding Jarmo culture, a conclusion which, though based on typological data and general considerations, appears basically correct. There are no stratigraphical indices. The stratigraphy of Tell Shimshara on the upper reaches of the Lower Zab, which at first appeared to embody a transition from Jarmo to Hassuna material, has been reconsidered by P. Mortensen, who has shown that both phases should be assigned to the Hassuna culture.55 The overall chronological position of our sequence, and of the Hassuna culture in general, is determined by typological correspondences with the neolithic and early chalcolithic settlements over a vast area of the Levant, southern Anatolia, northern and central Mesopotamia and south-west Iran, notably Jericho IX, Megiddo XX, Ras Shamra IV A-B, Amuq A-B, Carchemish, Mersin XXIV-XX, Sakse-Gozu, Mohammadjaffar and Sabz. The absolute chronology of this period can be outlined with the aid of the few available carbon dates, of which we select those most relevant to the dating of Hassuna and Samarra settlements.56 (i) The end of the early phase of Hassuna: W 623 Matarrah 56I0 ? 250 B.C. P 855 Tell es-Sawwan I 55o6 ? 73 B.C. (ii) The late phase of Hassuna: P 856 Tell es-Sawwan III 5349 + 86 B.C.57 W 66o Hassuna V r0o80 + 200 B.C. 64 Lloyd and Safar considered that this phase was unrelated to the Hassuna culture and that the lowest level of Hassuna, i a, should be ascribed to some other group of population. Braidwood (_NES 4, 258) doubted this conclusion, postulating a coherent development with the same population, and this is confirmed by the discoveries at Yarim Tepe I. 5 P.

MUNCHAEV These data clearly indicate that the development of the Hassuna culture spanned the whole of the sixth millennium B.C. and this accords with the evidence available from comparable sites outside Mesopotamia.58 rarim Tepe I. The Halaf Settlement Mention has already been made of the cemetery dug into the abandoned settle- ment on Yarim Tepe I. Typical Halaf pottery was found in the graves (Plate XXXIX, 6), as well as some stone vessels and mace-heads (Plate XLII, 3, 4). Its most interesting feature is the form of some of the graves, in which a lateral chamber opened off the bottom of a shaft, the earliest known occurrence of this method of interment. The settlement to which the cemetery belonged constitutes the mound of Yarim Tepe II, about 250 m. west of Yarim Tepe I and overlooking the brook, Joubara Diariasi, which has cut deeply into its eastern flank; the " half-mound " that remains has given its name to the whole site. Yarim Tepe II appears originally to have been roughly circular in plan, with a diameter of I00 to I40 m.; its surviving length is I20 m. from north to south, with a width of 25-40 m. and a height of almost 9 m. In order to discover the character and thickness of the occupation deposit, we began in I969 by excavating a step trench for stratigraphic purposes from the highest, central part of the mound down to the level of the brook. The Halaf culture is one of the most brilliant of the cultures associated with early agriculturalists in the Old World. It was named from the site of Tell Halaf in Syria, excavated by Baron M. von Oppenheim almost forty years ago,59 and since then a considerable number of Halaf sites have been investigated. It now appears that the culture extended over northern Mesopotamia, including parts of Iraq and Syria, as well as south-eastern Turkey, and that its influence was actively felt westward into Palestine and the Levant,60 and north-east to the region of Lake Van 61 and even Transcaucasia.62 At present two main groups may be distinguished, a western one including among others Tell Halaf, Brak and Chagar Bazar,63 and an eastern group characterized by Arpachiyah 64 and Tepe Gawra.65 None of these settlements has been completely excavated, the best known at present being Arpachiyah, just east of Mosul, and many essential questions remain unresolved, notably the problems of the origin and early development of the culture and the interrelation between its various provinces.66 In this connection the excavation of Yarim Tepe I, occupying as it does an intermediate position between the western and eastern groups of sites, must prove of the greatest importance, and this was a prime motive in our decision to begin work there in I969. 58 E.g. the dates for the Mohammed Jafar phase in south-west Iran, 5270 and 5870 B.C.; Hole, Flannery and Neely, op. cit. n. 3I, 334. 59 M. von Oppenheim, Tell Halaf I.

The upper levels have proved to be badly disturbed by numerous graves, of which some forty have already been excavated, and many pits evidently dug for domestic purposes; about ten pits so far opened have yielded material of Late Assyrian aspect. Very little remains of the two uppermost building levels, and Level I was represented only by isolated patches of hard-packed earth floor up to 5 cm. thick. The remains of similar floors of Level 2 were found in many places at a depth of 50-80 cm. below the surface datum, with, in square 23b, a curved pise wall that appears to have belonged to a round structure; a large stone found nearby may have been part of a buttress supporting the same building. Level 3, averaging I I m. but in places up to I * 5 m., below datum, was also extensively damaged, but has yielded isolated dwellings with auxiliary structures and hearths as well as extensive remains of flooring, and a further two levels have been exposed at depths from I *7 to 2 8 m. We now have, in addition to a considerable quantity of artifacts of various types, information that contributes to the study of house-plans and building techniques both at Yarim Tepe and in Halaf communities in general, and can base on it a brief discussion of north Mesopotamian domestic architecture in the fifth millennium B.C. Yarim Tepe II shows no evidence of deliberate planning and, like other known Halaf sites such as Arpachiyah,67 was intensively built up. Almost all the dwellings are one-room mud-brick houses, with the round " tholos " plan and a diameter of 3 to 4 m. In rare cases the walls were lined externally and internally with a thin gypsum plaster, painted in red. The best-preserved example proved to be a tholos in square 23b at a depth of I 2-2 '05 m., which was 4.5 m. in diameter. Its walls stood to a height of not less than 8o cm. and were on average 25 cm. thick, reinforced in places by buttresses. Two doorways were found, on the north-west and south-east sides, of which the latter was evidently the original entrance, later blocked and replaced by the opening in the opposite wall. One of the stone door sockets remained in situ. A number of successive floors were cleared, each composed of fine, hard- packed greenish-grey clay 68 and gypsum, and in the north wall of the house was an intriguing feature, a rectangular recess 55 cm. high, 40 cm. wide and 20 cm. deep. Adjoining this tholos on the south, and slightly later in date, were the remains of another less well-preserved but interesting round house. It was divided internally into two unequal parts by a pise partition, and the smaller section was in turn subdivided into two compartments that were undoubtedly used for domestic purposes, probably the storage of produce. The finds were informative, for they included considerable quantities of charred cereal grains as well as crushed storage jars, a large pestle and other objects. Comparable structures designed for habitation and general domestic purposes have been unearthed in the lower building levels. In Level 4, squares I9 and 24, the remains of three adjoining houses were discovered at a depth of 2 *0-2 *8 m. below 67 Mallowan and Rose, op. cit. 68 The floors, and sometimes the walls, of most of the domestic structures at Yarim Tepe II were coated with the same clay, obtained from the nearby stream.</page><page sequence="30">110 N.

No. 5, the largest was 4 I 5 m. in diameter and the smallest, No. 9, 2 .75 m. On the north-west side of No. 6 lay a small pise annexe, I 40 by X 2 m., opening directly off the round room. In the centre of the latter were found traces of the hearth, while scattered around the floor were two stone querns, a pestle, a grinding stone and a quantity of sherds. The annexe was used as a store, and yielded two jars, a sling bullet, one flint and one obsidian sickle blade and a number of animal bones. A similar pise house, with a round room 3 8 m. across and an adjoining rectangular annexe I 55 by I I m., was found in square 29 at a depth of 2 * 7-3 *0 m. Here the rooms were connected by an opening 45 cm. wide, with a surviving sill io cm. high. We may assume that this combination of a circular main room with a rectangular subsidiary annexe is one of the standard house plans in the settlement,69 but the most popular type of dwelling was still the single-roomed round house.70 The largest example of this type so far, Tholos no. 7, was also excavated in I97I; it was 5 m. in diameter and had walls 6o cm. thick. It must be added, however, that rectangular buildings have been found at Yarim Tepe II. One was discovered in 1971 in square I9 at a depth of 3 I to 3 4 m. It was approximately 3 5 m. square with walls up to 20 cm. thick and in the east corner was a space 40-50 cm. wide separated by a clay partition from the rest of the room, perhaps for cooking, since a small round portable hearth made of clay was found in it. Other groups of two or three rectangular rooms of different sizes have been found, and in the south-eastern sector of the settlement was a particularly interesting complex consisting of several small rectangular rooms, I 65 by I *2 m., I .4 by I i m. and the like, one round structure I-5 m. in diameter and two clay ovens. There has hitherto been no generally accepted interpretation of the function of the tholos-type buildings in Halaf settlements, and their use as dwellings seemed particularly open to question. But the excavations at Yarim Tepe II, and also at ayonu in south-east Turkey where a number of these round pise buildings have come to light, have established this domestic character beyond doubt, and in Yarim Tepe II they clearly represent the basic type of house. 1' So we may now confidently conclude that the circular pise building is a typical form of residential architecture among the fifth millennium population of northern Mesopotamia, and it is in sharp contrast to the forms characteristic of Yarim Tepe I although, as we have observed, several round structures were found in the earlier settlement. The archaeological evidence in general, and that of Yarim Tepe II in particular, demonstrates that the cultural and historical development of northern Mesopotamia in the Halaf period is characterized not only by a change in house plans, a further development of the agricultural and stock-breeding economy and a growth of 69 There are well-known examples of the same combination of a round and a rectangular room at Arpachiyah; there the surviving walls were of stone, but there were many other examples of pisi construc- tion (Mallowan and Rose, op. cit., fig. I3). '? Up to now some 30 tholoi, including the large houses and smaller subsidiary rooms, have been found at Yarim Tepe II, more thani in all other Halaf sites combined. At Arpachiyah there were io, at Tepe Gawra i, at Nuzi 2, at Uay6nu in south-east Turkey g (R. J. Braidwood et al., Science I64, no. 3885 (1969), 1275-76). 71 Pisi buildings of tholos type were also found in the earliest level of Yarim Tepe II, in the step trench dug in I969.</page><page sequence="31">EARLY AGRICULTURAL SETTLEMENT'S IN THE SINJAR PLAIN, NORTHERN IRAQ I I I population, but also by the appearance of some new elements in the material culture. It is not our purpose in the present article to establish the causes of these very considerable changes in the development of the region at the dawn of the Metal Age, but we should like to call attention to one very interesting fact. The latest archaeological research in Transcaucasian territories has established that, at about the same time, the round pise building of tholos type made its appearance in the Kur-Araxes valley as the basic pattern of domestic architecture.72 This can hardly be dismissed as a coincidence, especially when we bear in mind that imported specimens of characteristic Halaf painted pottery are first found in Transcaucasia at the same date. Questions arise, of the widest importance and interest, concerning the cultural and historical links between the ancient Near East and the Caucasus in the epoch of the formation and development of early agricultural communities, a subject which has hitherto been largely neglected. We cannot conclude this summary discussion of the architecture of the Halaf period at Yarim Tepe II without a reference to the only building so far discovered that appears to be other than domestic in character. Unfortunately this important pise structure, in squares 23 and 28 at a depth of I 6 to 2 * 35 m., was severely damaged by later buildings and pits and we cannot yet present a restoration of its plan. The principal feature was a wall 8 4 m. long, aligned approximately from north-west to south-east and standing to a height of between 40 and 8o cm. It was built in two phases; the earlier south-eastern sector, about 4 m. long with two adjoining chambers 6 *o by I * 75 m. and 3 5 by 2 O im., was constructed in the usual manner with layers of light yellow clay 5-6 cm. thick alternating with a 2-3 cm. layers of greenish grey clay, and was coated with plaster up to 4 cm. thick. A 30 cm. deposit of occupation debris accumulated against this structure before the building of the second phase, which extended the principal wall 4 4 m. to the north-west. The extension, a solid mass of reddish clay, was buttressed at some points on both faces and varied in thickness from 40 cm. to I O m., and a small room, I -75 by I *62 m. adjoined its south side at the far end. Unfortunately its damaged state leaves us in ignorance of the overall plan and many structural features that might have afforded clues to its purpose, but it is noteworthy that none of the usual debris of domestic occupation- pottery, implements and bones-was found within the building or in its immediate neighbourhood, and we may conclude that it was some public edifice, perhaps of a religious character. Cult buildings are known to have appeared in an early phase of the development of agricultural communities,73 but none has yet been discovered in northern Iraq as early as the fifth millennium, and in general only one building has so far been identified as a shrine in the context of a Halaf settlement. This is the remains of a rectangular pise structure of several rooms, 6 25 by 5 I m. overall, which was found by M. E. L. Mallowan at Tell Aswad in northern Syria and plausibly interpreted by him as religious in character.74 72 K. H. Koushnariova and T. N.

MUNCHIAEV Ovens and kilns The remains of a considerable niumber of hearths and ovens of different conlstruc- tion, form and purpose have been discovered in the various levels of Yarim Tepe II. These include small round clay hearths, dome-shaped tanour ovens up to I m. in diameter for baking bread, two chamber furnaces and large kilns for firing pottery. The ovens were sometimes built into the walls of houses, but were more often located close by, in the open air. In the north-eastern sector of the settlement a closely packed group of round ovens of the tanour type was uncovered, all built of clay and up to 8o cm. in diameter. Stone and bone objects; evidencefor the economy Among the considerable range of objects recovered from the excavation of Yarin Tepe II were stone and obsidian implements-sickle blades, querns, grinding stones, pestles and so on-that reflect all the operations of harvesting and preparation of agricultural produce. About 200 flint and, more commonly, obsidian blades originally formed part of composite sickles, and some still bore traces of the bitumen that was used to fix them in wooden or bone hafts. The corners of many blades sh1ow traces of sheen, indicating that they were set at an angle in the haft to give the sickle a serrated cutting edge. The stone material also included a number of ornamental pendants, and among small terra cotta objects were a few female figurines and a stamp seal (Plates XLIII, I 2; XLII, 6). A considerable quantity of carbonized grain was found and has been submitted for specialist study and identification, together with a rich osteological material. The animal bones from the I969 season were studied by the late Professor V. I. Tsalkine, who concluded that all the main domesticated species, including cattle, sheep, goat and pig were represented among the herds and flocks of the population of the Yarim Tepe II settlement.75 Pottery The pottery includes all the known Halaf repertoire, displaying the standard range of techniques.76 It is hand-made, tempered with a mixture of finely crushed stone, sand and shell and commonly slipped and burnished. It falls into two main groups, painted and unpainted, of which the second is more numerous; it is note- worthy that the highest standard of modelling is displayed in the painted wares, especially the smaller vessels, among which there are some thin-walled examples of very fine quality. The absence of handles is a Halaf characteristic. The most frequent forms are bowls, cups (Plates XXXIX, 5; XLIV, 5; XLV, 4) and a variety ofjars with bulbous bodies and low undifferentiated or everted rims (Plates XLI, 1-4; XLV, I-3). Many large jars were up to 50 cm. or more in height, and some of these have been completely restored; they are of pear-shaped or globular form and constitute a type not previously reported from other Halaf sites. As can be seen from the examples illustrated (Plate XLIV, 1-3), the decoration extends over the whole vessel from rim to base. 0f very common occurrence at Yarim 75 The specialized study of the osteological material from Yarim 'lepe I and II is at presenlt in the hands of V.

The extremely attractive Halaf painted pottery is richly represented. It is mainly monochrome, but there are a considerable number of bichrome and polychrome specimens; various shades of red and brown are the dominant colours. The bowls and cups are usually covered with painted decoration inside and out. Up to the present over 350 different motifs have been recorded from Halaf pottery.77 Various geometrical patterns prevail, such as simple hatched triangles and rhom- boids, straight and undulating lines and zigzags, together with the more elaborate "chess-board ", four-petalled flowers, the Maltese cross and the bucranium (Plate XLVI, 2). Of especial interest from Yarim Tepe II are the naturalistic motifs, such as the fragments of a cup with a representation in black paint of a flock of feeding aquatic birds (Plate XLVI, 5-6), sherds with realistic portrayals of goats and deer (Plate XLVI, 1-2), and even an entire scene with birds of prey attacking a flock of deer (Plate XLVI, 4); parallels for these motifs may be found in particular on the pottery from Tell Halaf.78 Attention should also be called to two pieces for which no known parallels exist in the Halaf repertoire; the first is a bowl with its light yellow outer surface ornamented with large circles of solid brown paint (Plate XLV, 4), and the second a sherd with a realistic representation, in dark brown paint on a light ground, of a rampant cheetah, Acinonyxjubatus (Plate XLVII).79 Since only upper levels of the Yarim Tepe II settlement have so far been partially excavated, the authors have deliberately refrained in this article from attempting any detailed comparative analysis of the pottery and formulating conclusions from it. At present we may confidently assert that several characteristic features of our material point to a close association with the western group of Halaf sites, while there are at the same time obvious traits in common with the eastern group. It is equally clear that in our pottery we have both shapes and motifs that are unparalleled in either group, and Yarim Tepe II occupies a special place among the sites of the Halaf culture in the fifth millennium B.C. It has also contributed to the establishment of its chronology, for the examination of carbonized grain found at a depth of I 7-I .9 m. below surface datum yielded a radio-carbon date of 32IO? 130 B.C.80 In conclusion, the mounds so far examined at Yarim Tepe have made an important contribution to the study of the cultural and historical development of northern Mesopotamia in the sixth and fifth millennia B.C., as well as to the solution of general and specific problems. The Soviet expedition aims in future seasons at the widest possible investigation of both Yarim Tepe I and Yarim Tepe II. 7 Ibid., Plates XIV-XXIX. 78 M. von Oppenheim, Tell Halaf 1. 79 A represenitation of a spotted beast of prey, roughly delineated and in bad condition, occurs on a sherd from Tepe Gawra, Level XII; A.
