<plain_text><page sequence="1">1937 October-December ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS' NOTES ON RECENT ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXCAVATIONS SUMMARIES OF ORIGINAL ARTICLES CHIEFLY IN CURRENT PUBLICATIONS DAVID M. ROBINSON, Editor Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore NECROLOGY Dr. Jean Paul Richter, who was an authority on Italian art, died at Lugano on August 25 at the age of 90. Born at Dresden on January 7, 1847, the son of Karl Edmund Richter, a distinguished clergyman of the Lutheran Church, and Fred- erique Mook of Lorraine, he studied theology at Leipzig. On a journey to Italy in 1869 his interest in Christian archaeology was roused, and he de- termined henceforth to devote himself to the study of art history. During these studies he be- came the friend of Senatore Giovanni Morelli (Lermolieff), whose method he admired and fol- lowed. Both held that historical, documentary, and traditional knowledge respecting works of art was only of secondary importance as compared with the evidence to be derived from the study of the pictures themselves, and that the study of the individual parts and forms was of the highest im- portance, for they were the outward and visible seal of an artist's character stamped upon his work. During his student days Dr. Richter travelled extensively in Italy and the Near East, and in- cidentally did work for Karl Baedeker, the founder of Baedeker's guide books. Subsequently he settled in London, but lived part of the year in Italy. His first book was on the mosaics of Ravenna. In 1880 he published a small biography of Leonardo da Vinci, which then led to his "Literary Works of Leonardo da Vinci" (1883), which established his reputation. Other works were "Italian Art in the National Gallery" (1883); "Quellen der Byzantinischen Kunst- geschichte" (Vienna, 1897); "Lectures on the National Gallery " given at the Royal Institution (1898); and "The Golden Age of Christian Art," written in collaboration with Alicia Cam- eron Taylor and dealing with the mosaics of Santa Maria Maggiore (1904). Dr. Richter was also a collector and acted as adviser in the formation of collections. He was the fortunate discoverer of several masterpieces, such as Giorgione's portrait of a young man, now one of the treasures of the Kaiser Friedrich Mu- seum in Berlin. He helped Dr. Ludwig Mond in the formation of the Mond Collection, the most important part of which was bequeathed to the National Gallery. A catalogue in two volumes compiled by Dr. Richter appeared in 1910. The Hertz Collection, bequeathed to the Italian State and now in the Palazzo Venezia in Rome, was formed by him, and his catalogue appeared in 1998. He formed the Cannon collection of paint- ings of the Veronese School, which was recently presented to Princeton University by Henry W. Cannon, junior, in memory of his father. A cat- alogue containing Richter's detailed studies on Veronese Renaissance Art appeared in 1936. Dr. Richter's last years were spent at Lugano, where he continued working to the last. When he died he had practically completed, with the help of his daughter, the revision of his "Literary 607 1 The Department of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books is conducted by Professor DAVID M.

Dr. George M. Whicher, professor emeritus and for twenty-five years head of the department of Greek and Latin at Hunter College, New York, died on November 2. He was born on July 29, 1860, at Muscatine, Iowa, the son of Stephen Emerson and Anna Meason Whicher. He was graduated from Iowa College, now Grinnell, in 1882 and received his master's degree there three years later. In the meantime he had studied at Johns Hopkins and later did post-graduate work at Columbia University. Dr. Whicher's first teaching post was as Pro- fessor of Greek and German at Hastings College in Nebraska. In 1888 he became Classical Master at Lawrenceville School, Lawrenceville, N. J. Two years later he went to Brooklyn, where he was Professor of Greek and Latin at Packer Collegiate Institute. He held this post until 1899, when he went to Hunter College as head of the Depart- ment of Greek and Latin and as full professor of those languages. Dr. Whicher was interested in archaeology and from 1918 to 1921 was president of the New York Archaeological Society. He also was general secretary of the Archaeological Institute of Amer- ica, president of the New York Classical Club and of the Phi Beta Kappa Alumni of New York in 1917-18. In 1921 he was the professor in charge of the Classical School of the American Academy in Rome. He was an Officer of the Order of the Holy Redeemer of Greece. Dr. Whicher's books included "From Musca- tine," "Roman Pearls and Other Verses," "Son- net Singing," "Amity Street," "Vergiliana," "On the Tiber Road" and "Roba d'Italia." He also edited the 1924 "Anthology of Hunter College Verse." EGYPT A Gold Comb or Pin Head from Egypt.-In the City Art Gallery of Manchester, England, is a small object of gold, measuring 4 x 3.6 cm., and weighing 3.48 grams, which consists of three free- standing figures on a low, oblong base with orna- mented front. They represent Demeter, Perse- phone and Harpocrates. Demeter, with sceptre in the left hand, wears a corn wreath with two large ears standing up diagonally over her fore- head, and Persephone, the central and taller fig- ure, has her himation drawn up behind the head and wears a stephane and polos. Harpocrates wears the double crown of Egypt and raises his left hand, wrapped in his mantle, to his mouth. The sculptural character of the drapery and the resemblance of the tracery on the base to jeweller's work suggest a date in the first half of the third century B.C., when the mixture of Hellenic with Egyptian religious forms was beginning. Deme- ter's prominent ears of corn may be reminiscent of the vertical plumes worn by Isis, mother of Horus-HIarpocrates. The gesture of the latter fig- ure, if interpreted by the Greeks as a sign of silence, must refer to the mystery cults of his two companions. (E. S. G. ROBINSOn, J.H.S. lvii, 1937, p. 79.) Excavations at Sesebe.- Archaeological in- vestigations are being carried on at the site of the fortified town of Sesebe by the Egypt Exploration Society's Expedition to Nubia. An article on the excavation by the Director, Professor A. M. BLACKMAN, appears in Ill. L.N., August 14, 1937, pp. 272-273. Three standing columns bearing reliefs of Sethos I, which rise above the debris, have always marked the site. In 1907 Breasted discovered that reliefs of Akhenaten had been erased, This increased the importance of an exca- vation on the site. The fortification wall has been traced; in each of the four sides was a gate. Along one side of a forecourt were three temples resting on a single substructure. They have unfortu- nately been used as quarries for later building material. Some fine fragments of reliefs and sculp- ture were found in the remains. Four sets of foundation-deposits were found in situ beneath the northwest and southwest corners of the sub- structure. Plaques and scarabs bear the name of Amenophis IV, showing that the building was erected before the fourth year of his reign when he changed his name to Akhenaten. A small crypt was found in the foundations of the central temple. The walls were decorated with reliefs representing Amenophis IV with several deities. Both the occurrence of the crypt and the polytheistic representations are unusual. South of the temple are storehouses and part of the resi- dential quarter. Numerous small finds included fragments of Mycenaean pottery. PALESTINE AND SYRIA Recent Discoveries at Atchana.-Excavations at Atchana, near Antioch in Northern Syria, which were begun last year under the auspices of the British Museum, have been continued with</page><page sequence="3">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 609 great success. A report on some of the most recent discoveries by Sir LEONARD WOOLLEY is published in Ill. L.N., October 9, 1937, pp. 604-605. A summary of the first report appeared in the A.J.A. xli, 1937, p. 120. Among the interesting finds in the early trial trench cut across the mound was the painted pottery. Further excava- tion has produced a large collection of fragments and some complete vases, including amphorae and goblets. The decorative patterns are linear and floral, generally in a creamy white on a dark ground, but occasionally in dark on light. Surface finds on the mound show that it was uninhabited after the twelfth century B.C. In the latest build- ing found were Mycenaean sherds dating from the thirteenth or fourteenth centuries. In the same level were discovered some cuneiform tablets, two belonging to the Ras Shamra series. Painted pot- tery appears also in the next level, from the four- teenth to the fifteenth centuries. This period was ended by a complete destruction. Hittite seals were found with the pottery. The most extensive excavation was conducted in the fourth level, where the painted pottery first occurs. A house was found which was of typical Hittite construc- tion. It had been destroyed suddenly and the con- tents of the storerooms were in situ. Some im- ported Cypriote ware will furnish good evidence for dating the local painted pottery found in the same context. Another building was also par- tially cleared. It had mud-brick walls, with pol- ished basalt revetment at the bottom. The upper parts of the walls were either plastered or panelled in wood. One passed on entering through a colon- nade. The bases for the columns are still in place. Magnificent small finds were made in the building; one, an ivory toilet box in the shape of a duck, is illustrated. More cuneiform tablets were also found there. These buildings are the oldest Hittite constructions yet found in Syria. The fourth level is dated in the sixteenth century B.c. Et-Tell. - The masterly hand of PE'R VINCENT is again evident in his careful analysis of the ex- cavations conducted at et-Tell during 1933-1935 by Minme. Krause-Marquet. The site was occupied as early as the aeneolithic era, but its fortification dates from the beginning of the Bronze Age (early third millennium). A double rampart was erected: the outer wall, 2.50 m. thick, follows the crest of the hill; the inner wall, twice as thick, rests not on the rock but on a bed of beaten earth to allow for drainage and settling. On the northwestern part of the mound are the ruins of a palace, sanc- tuary and fortress. The palace consisted of a large reception room, 20 x 6.50 m., surrounded on three sides by a corridor, 2.50 m. wide. Beyond this was a large walled courtyard, Pere Vincent's reconstruction of the palace is quite different from that of Dussaud in Syria, 1935, pp. 347-349. The sanctuary comprised two rooms, one at a lower level than the other. The first, measuring 8.50 x 5.50 m., contained a semicircular niche in the southwest corner, where the flesh of the sacrificial victims was cooked, to judge by the animal re- mains. Around part of the room ran a bench on which a number of votive vases was found. A piece of carbonized wood, about 1.25 m. long, found on the floor, can scarcely be the remains of a roof- beam, as it is an isolated piece, but may be the remains of an asherah. The second lower room, about 8 x 7 m., contained another niche and an altar, also in the southwest corner. Many re- mains of offerings were found here as well as some badly damaged alabaster of the first Egyptian dynasties. A platform in the southeast corner was covered with cups. Along the west side were four chambers for the storing of offerings. PNre Vincent warns against any comparison of this sanctuary with early Palestinian temples, for it may have been of the open-air variety. Traces of three periods of building appear on the site: the original fortification about 2900-2800 B.c., a restoration about 2600 following a fire, when the fortress and a new outer wall were added. About 2000 B.c. the site was destroyed and turned into a nameless ruin; it was not occupied again except for a short period during the Early Iron Age (ca. 1200-1050 B.C.). P~re Vincent contends that there is no contra- diction between these archaeological facts and the Biblical record in Joshua 7-8. The site was already a "ruin" ('ai) when the Israelites captured it, although a later embellishment of the tradition has supplied it with a king. He thinks the forces of Bethel, and perhaps of some other neighboring towns, took up a position in "the Ruin" whose walls still presented a formidable appearance and there, at the head of the pass, awaited the inva- sion from Jericho. With the capture of "the Ruin," the fall of Bethel would naturally follow. Mention of this fact does not appear until Judg. i, 22-26, but it is evident from the break between Josh. viii, 89 and viii, 30 that it has intervened. (R.B. xlvi, 1937, pp. 231- 66.) Megiddo.- A report on the excavations at Megiddo by GORDON LOUD, Field Director of the</page><page sequence="4">610 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Megiddo Expedition of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, is published in Ill. L.N., October 16, 1937, pp. 655-658 and 684; in- cluded are two pages of photographs in color. During 1936-37 excavation was continued in areas tested during the preceding season, notably the north and east sections of the city. Several new levels were added to the stratification previ- ously recorded, especially some dating in the Middle Bronze Period. In the northern section the palace, occupied during the fifteenth to the thirteenth centuries, was investigated. Five build- ing periods can be distinguished, although, since there was never a complete destruction, there is very little change in floor-level or plan. The orig- inal foundations are in Stratum IX, dated 1550- 1479 B.C. The last three periods occur in Stratum VII (1350-1150 B.C.). The destruction between the fourth and fifth buildings was more violent, which probably accounts for the fact that the builder of the last palace added a subterranean vault for his treasures. A magnificent collection of carved ivories was found there. They are described in Ill. L.N. October 23, pp. 708-709. Another hoard of small objects was found under the floor of a room in the second palace. They may, however, have belonged to an occu- pant of the third building. The collection appar- ently represents gifts from Asiatic and Egyptian royalty. A few of the most beautiful pieces are. a gold bowl in the form of a shell; cosmetic jars of serpentine, with gold rims; a gold chain; a carved ivory tusk, banded with gold; lapis lazuli seals and beads; and an electrum ring. In the eastern area under excavation private houses of earlier periods were cleared. In Stratum XVII, the Early Bronze Period of about 2000 B.C., the area was occupied by a public building. Pri- vate houses appear in Stratum XIII. They were small and built along irregular streets. Strata XI-IX belong to the Late Hyksos Period. Here is a definite city-plan, with straight streets cross- ing at right angles. Each of these three strata is characterized by a different burial custom. In XI family tombs of stone were built under the house floors; in X bodies were buried in simple graves; in IX several bodies were buried together in trenches. This period may be that of the final siege in 1479 B.c., when Megiddo was overthrown by Egypt under Thutmose III. Nabataean Temple at Khirbet et-Tannir.-- A report on the excavation of the Temple of Atargatis at Khirbet et-Tannfir, by Dr. NELSON GLUECK, appears in Ill. L.N., August 21, 1937, pp. P298-300. An article on this temple was re- cently published in the Journal (cf. Arch. Notes, pp. 361 ff., of the present volume). There are a number of additional photographs of architec- tural and sculptural fragments in Ill. L.N. Nabataean Inscriptions.- Three Nabataean inscriptions were discovered amid the ruins of the Nabataean temple at Khirbet et-Tannmir. One is dated in the second year of Haretat IV (8-7 B.c.) and is apparently dedicated to a divinity named Rds 'Ain of el-La 'abdn. But Rds 'Ain is a most unusual appellation for a god. El-La 'abdn re- calls the modern name of the wady which the temple overlooks, el-La 'abdni. But P]RE SA- VIGNAC admits that the reading of the inscription is not absolutely certain. (R.B. xlvi, 1937, pp. 401-416.) ASIA MINOR Kusura. - WINIFRED LAMB reports briefly (Arch. Anz. 1936, cols. 406-411) on an excavation at Kusura, about fifty kilometers from Afyon- Karahisar. There is a settlement about four hun- dred meters in length and a cemetery. Three periods are distinguished. The first is chalcolithic; its pottery is good and sometimes has patterns incised or painted in white. In the second period there are houses with rectangular rooms; the pot- tery often has wide ribs and other plastic decora- tion; at the end of the period are red-cross bowls like those of Troy V, suggesting 9000 B.C. as an approximate date. In the third period the pot- ter's wheel appears; there are traces of Central Anatolian and perhaps of Phrygian influence; the houses are usually long and narrow; a singular "shrine " was found. The cemetery contains pithos burials and graves of stone slabs. Hittite Sculpture. - Professor JOHN GARSTANG, Director of the Neilson Expedition to the Near East, describes the discovery of a Hittite relief, cut on rock overhanging the Jeihan river at Sir- keli, about sixty miles east of Tarsus (Ill. L.N., July 31, 1937, pp. 7910-911). The relief consists of a single bearded figure, clad in the garments of a Hittite priest. Behind the head are hieroglyphs, which tell that it was set up to or by a King Muwatalli. It is very similar to the representa- tions of Hittite kings which have been found in the north, except that there the figures are beard- less. Chieftains were pictured with beards, how- ever, in the south, for example at Marash, where it is known that there was a dynast by the name</page><page sequence="5">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 611 of Muwatalli. He was the son of Mursil, who con- quered the southern kingdom of Arzawa, and Muwatalli is said at one time to have retired from the capital, and to have lived in another city. Near the sculpture is a large mound, marking the site of an important city. A brief investigation has shown that it was occupied throughout the Im- perial period. Another point which makes the identification of this city as the temporary head- quarters of Muwatalli fairly certain is its loca- tion. In a battle which he fought against the Pharaoh at Kadesh in Syria his army was made up of levies on tribes from Asia Minor, and it has always been something of a mystery how good communication lines could have been established over the only known road into Syria by way of Marash. The discovery of this new site has re- vealed the route of a second main road, running directly from the capital either over a steep pass through Taurus, or more easily through the Cili- cian Gates. Both of these roads would have gone to Aleppo (ancient Haleb), where the armies were probably assembled. Arzaova.- E. O. FORRER denies Sommer's identification of Ahhiyava as Cilicia, and argues that Cilicia was the Arzaova conquered by Mur- silis. On the north Arzaova extended to Tavanuva or Tyana (Thoana), and on the northeast to Oda, east of Antitaurus, on the borders of the Hatti kingdom. The Arzaovan state Tattassa was in the valley of the Holaya, in the north; its capi- tal Dunna was Ptolemy's Tynna, Xenophon's Dana (Anab. 1, 9, 20) (not Thyana, which was off Cyrus' route), near modern Zeive, on the Taurus highway. Apasa, capital of Arzaova, was Tarsus (not Adana). The Arinnanda Mountains are now called Misis Dag, with the city Puranda at their coastal end, near the old mouth of the Pyramus; the island on which the refugees gained temporary refuge was the modern Kara-Tas, in olden times separated from the mainland by a shallow sound, now filled up. The whole Arzaova campaign of Mursilis is set forth with identifi- cations, and also the localities mentioned in the inscription of Maduvattas. Ahhiyava must have been Mycenaean Greece. (Klio xxx, 1937, pp. 135-186; appendix and detailed folding map, pp. 967-969.) Two Decorated Pillars from Cyzicus.--The autumnal rains of 1939 uncovered two pieces of architectural sculpture at the village of Hamamli situated near the site of ancient Cyzicus. These have since been placed in the Museum of Istanbul. Each piece is the upper fragment of a pillar decorated by a standing Dionysiac figure. The part below the thighs is missing, yet this is no great loss, since the statues were originally in the form of herms. Each figure plays the important archi- tectonic role of forming a part of the pillar which it decorates, being sculptured in the same block and only slightly disengaged from it. The one figure is naked and carries a kid on the left shoulder; the other wears a Dionysiac crown and the skin of an animal. Although these attributes seem to indicate that the figures are satyrs, yet the strong physical bodies, sensuous lips, broad noses, and heavy locks of shaggy hair suggest representations of savage demi-gods rather than the graceful roguish satyrs of classical tradi- tion. What relationship these figures may have had to the cult of Dionysos, which we know existed at Cyzicus, excavations alone can re- veal. (P. DEVAMBEZ, R. Arch. ix, 1937, pp. 176- 194.) GREECE GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS Recent Excavations on the Acropolis. - For the past seven years excavations have been conducted by Dr. OSCAR BRONEER on the slope of the Acro- polis, northeast of the Erechtheum, where he dis- covered a sanctuary of Eros and Aphrodite. Dur- ing the past season two wells about sixty feet in depth were cleared. The contents of the fill in- cluded many magnificent small finds. Pictures of some of these discoveries with brief descriptions by Dr. Broneer are published in Ill. L. N., Au- gust 28, 1937, pp. 360-361. Among the most im- portant are a charming archaic bronze horse and rider; a large black-figured krater by Exekias (the first example of this shape that has been attributed to him). Two-thirds of the vase is preserved, de- spite the fact that two large millstones had been thrown into the well on top of it. Also found was a fragment, of a painted terracotta plaque dating from about 700 B.c., and some two hundred os- traka of Themistokles. The Agora Excavations in Athens. -A prelimi- nary report on the most recent discoveries in the Athenian Agora, by Dr. T. LESLIE SHEAR, is published in Ill. L. N., September 11, 1937, pp. 430-439. There are photographs of many of the most interesting finds, especially in the fields of sculpture, terracottas and vases. Diodorus and the Sacred War. -Since 1856 the declaration of Schaefer that the text of Diodorus</page><page sequence="6">612 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY XVI gives two parallel accounts of the origin of the Sacred War has been generally accepted, with the corollary that his two years from the seizure of the temple at Delphi by Philomelus in 357-6 to the declaration of war by the Amphicty- ony in 35.5-4 should be reduced to one; but no two scholars agree on the details of the readjustment. N. G. L. HAMMOND rejects in toto the suggestion of a doublet, and in a detailed interpretation of the text explains the apparent confusion by showing that, after mentioning the beginning of the war, Diodorus goes back to narrate the events which led up to it. The matter is of some importance, be- cause with the history of the Sacred War are in- volved the rise to power of Philip of Macedon, the dating of the early speeches of Dpmosthenes, and the' Naopoioi lists. (J.H.S. Ivii, 1937, pp. 44-78.) The Burning of Delphi.-In R. Et. Anc. xxxix, 1937, pp. 108-110, A. PIGANIOL dis- cusses the date of the third burning of Delphi. G. DAUX, in his excellent work, Delphes au IIe et au ler siecle (pp. 391-397), quotes the obscure tradition which places this burning by the Maedi "at the time of the war with Mithridates and the civil war," i.e. between 88 B.C. and 81 B.c. (Plu- tarch, Numa 9, 12) and agrees with A. J. Reinach (B.C.H. xxxiv, 1910, pp. 949 and 307) that the treasures must have been intact in 86 B.c. when Sulla confiscated them (Plutarch, Sulla 12, 4). St. Jerome dates the fire in 84-83 B.c. and Appian places the punitive expedition of L. Scipio "in the thirty-second year after the first contact of the Romans with the Celts." The invasion of the Maedi must, according to this view, have taken place in 84-83, after Sulla had gone on farther east into Macedonia and Asia. Piganiol, however, thinks that Sulla would not have left his line of retreat and communication unprotected and that the Thracians would not have chosen this time to attack Delphi. Pomtow puts the burning even later (83 B.C.), after Sulla had left the east, and makes it coincident with the burning of the Capitol ("Die drei Bruinde des Tempels zu Del- phi," Rhein. Mus. li, 1896, p. 373). Piganiol would date the burning much earlier, say in 89 or 88, supposing the treasure to have been tempora- rily removed to a place of safety, and would count Appian's thirty-two year period as having begun in 118-117 B.c., when the governor Sextus Pom- pey was slain by the Galatians. The Eleusinian Mysteries. - In R. Et. A4nc. xxxix, 1937, pp. 97-107, GEORGES MAAUTIS discusses four matters connected with the Eleu- sinian mysteries: I. Comparing a passage in Plutarch's De facie in orbe lunae (949 C), descriptive of the destinies of souls after death, with a citation in Stobaeus from Plutarch's De anima (Edition Bernardakis VII, p. 93) where men's feelings at death are likened to those of initiates at the Eleusinian mysteries, the author finds that the "Initiates" mentioned in the first passage must be those of the Eleusinian mysteries. He emphasizes verbal re- semblances, XELg~C^Es "A1tov, xapa tE7' EXWrlbo 76iElas (as in Isocrates, Cicero, Crinagoras, Aris- tides), oE-EdpbOLt EbEvTaOlda (cf. Pindar, Pyth. IX, 125; Olymp. XIV, 24; Aristophanes, Frogs, 326, 343, 374) and infers from the Orphic beliefs here indicated that Orphism must have played a considerable part in these mysteries (M'autis' recent work, L'dme hellenique d'apres les vases grecs, p. 165, treats of this question more fully). II. Pausanias (X, 98, 4), in describing the painting of the Nekyia in the Lesche of Polygnotos at Delphi, speaks of a ghoul-like demon of Hades, who, he says, was unknown to Homer in his Odyssey, the Minyad, or Nostoi, and who, ac- cording to the statement of the exegetes, was named Eurynomus. He was evidently a dreadful creature, sitting on the skin of a vulture, of a blue-black color, "like the flies that light on corpses," with bared teeth - a devourer of dead bodies. F. de Ruyt (Charun, demon dtrusque de la mort, pp. 17, 67, 79) connects him with the Etrus- can Charun, whom he resembles in color, bared teeth, dreadful character and in the fact that he is outside the lower world. In the painting, described by Pausanias, Eurynomus is at the left, among those who, like Sisyphus and Tantalus, have no part, as have Tellis and Cleobea at the opposite side of the picture, in the happiness of the Eleusinian mysteries. III. The pass-word (o~ialPz7ga) of the Eleusin- ian mysteries, as recorded by Clement of Alexan- dria (Protrepticus, II, 21, p. 18p) reads: I have fasted, I have drunk the kykeon, I have taken (the object) from the kiste: after performing the act, I have placed (the object) in the kalathus and from the kalathus in the kiste. M6autis finds that this series of acts, representing a symbolical impregna- tion, is set forth in all detail in a painting, which he fully describes, found in the Villa of the Mys- teries at Pompeii, but he insists that these rites cannot have been performed by the three thousand celebrants of the Eleusinian mysteries within the</page><page sequence="7">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 613 time limits of the festival. He thinks that Clement has confused the ritual of some small sect at Alexandria, possibly of Dionysos worshippers, with that at Eleusis. IV. The meaning of the term, 6 ' uvyleEs ' arLas, inscribed on the bases of many small statues dedicated to children of the foremost Athenians, and found in the excavations at Eleusis, has been much disputed. Dismissing Boeckh's idea that it meant "near the altar" and August Mommsen's that it signified that the child had lit his torch at the hearth of Demeter in Eleusis and the explanation of Foucart, Kern and Deubner that it was equivalent to 6yqpora'a (i.e. from the relia of the Prytaneum at Athens), Melautis, comparing the expression 610' a&amp;rlas apXceOaL, "to begin with the essentials and the fundamental importance of the goddess Hestia," thinks that the child, as the typically pure wor- shipper, presents the prayers for the whole family and for the state. He speaks of Christ's attitude toward children (whose angels are always before the face of His Father in heaven). So in the paint- ing in the Villa Item, referred to above, a child is charged with the reading of the ritual, under an older woman's supervision. The child is, therefore, the first initiate, the type of the primordial initiate. An Order of Alexander the Great.-In R.1 Et. Anc. xxxix, 1937, pp. 5-26, ANDRE AYMARD treats of an "order" (called athaypallppa in C.I.G. V, 2, p. XXXVI, D 1, and brirawyga by Hyperi- des) of Alexander the Great, brought to the Greeks by Nikanor, toward the end of 324 B.C., and known to us from the oration of Hyperides against Demosthenes in the Harpalus affair. The part of the order which refers to the rein- statement of those who had been banished from the Greek cities is clear and has been properly interpreted, but in 11. 13-16 of the 18th column of the papyrus which read: 7repl 70r robs KOL Vobi avXXbyovs 'AXadicv TE Kat 'ApKWa[a] Kat B][cy]r&amp; [v . . . . . followed by a lacuna of several lines or perhaps an entire column, there has been much uncertainty as to what is meant by KOLVYOV ~ vXXTyovU, which many explain as referring to the dissolution (supplying the word KaraXVo-at) of all the leagues, including the KOLVa of all the states in the Corinthian League, or at least of the Achaeans, Arcadians and Boeo- tians. Aymard, calling attention to the complete uncertainty of the reading BotLwr&amp;[v ..... (where the reasonably sure letters ot-rc may form part of the verb with which 7ro (repl 7roe) agrees) and also to the fact that the Boeotians at this time had no connections with either Achaea or Arcadia, shows that -apart from the futility of such a dissolution of assemblies, which could un- der more favorable conditions reassemble-the KOtAL of Achaea and Arcadia (for the latter he adduces inscriptional authority) continued to exist after 324 B.c. Although many states con- tested before Alexander at Babylon the restora- tion of those who had been banished, no action seems ever to have been taken as to the second part of the decree. The author ventures to suggest that in the lacuna a request may have been made that the KOLvoL crbiXXoyot should confer divine honors on the victorious king. Attic Festivals.-L. DEUBNER publishes (Arch. Anz. 1936, cols. 335-343) a black-figured lekythos in Palermo, with five women in procession; the first and the last carry torches, the other three boughs and baskets, of which one has the form of a liknon (winnowing-basket). These women are probably the cavrXptat, who, at the Thesmo- phoria, brought up from the underground megara of Demeter and Kore the pig and other objects which had been thrown there at the Skira and were to be mixed with the grain for sowing. The torches would give light underground, the baskets would contain the objects, the liknon would be suitable in a festival of Demeter. The conven- tional boughs may well represent pine-branches. An dvrXkpta symbolizes the Thesmophoria on a later relief. H. A. Thompson has suggested that the pig was thrown in at the Thesmophoria and the remains brought up some time later, but this is wrong; he errs in associating the procession to Skiron with the deposit in the megara. Deubner publishes also a red-figured pelike with a scene from the Haloa: a nude hetaira taking one phallos from a basketful. Recent discoveries have made known the Zosteria, have confirmed the distinc- tion between the Tauropolia and the Brauronia, and have shown that a footrace made part of the festival of Hekalos and Hekale. Bronze.--D. ZONTSCHEW publishes (Arch. Anz. 1936, cols. 411-416) an oval, two-handled bronze bucket found in a tumulus near Pastrovo, Bul- garia. It is 24 cms. high and 20 cms. in diameter, not complete. On one side are Dionysos and the panther in relief; on the other side a youth, an animal and a herm. The style is that of the late fifth century B.c. The decidedly linear character of the work is not Attic; the bronze was probably</page><page sequence="8">614 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY made in South Italy, perhaps at Tarentum. Other bronze buckets are mentioned, and J. Werner adds a list of twelve in various museums. ARCHITECTURE Polygonal Walls.-In R. Et. Anc. xxxix, 1937, pp. 111-194, H. ROLLAND describes ex- tensive polygonal walls of a fine fifth-century Hellenic type (presumably like the wall which stopped Caesar before Marseilles), which have re- cently been fully explored, measured and photo- graphed in excavations carried on at Saint-Blaise (Bouches-du-Rhone). This is a fortified spur, of about 125 m. in length, which projects from a higher plateau in a southerly direction and domi- nates at a height of about fifty m. the lakes Engrenier, Pourra, Citis and Valduc; the latter forms a creek on the west side of the promontory where vessels could anchor for leaving supplies and getting fresh water. The walls of massive construction form toward the south an irregular pentagon with two lines of wall, with a bastion in each, extending northward on the east and west sides, and with a separated tower on the west, which controlled passage alongside the fort toward the north and protected a narrow postern gate in the wall of the fortification itself. From the structural technique and copious pottery remains Rolland would (though somewhat doubtfully, in the lack of similar monuments with which to compare it) date the building of the fortress in the fourth, or perhaps be tter, in the fifth century B.C. It seems to have been an outpost for the de- fense of Marseilles and to have been used, as originally constructed, for only a short time. (Cf. Strabo IV, 1, 8, t6Lbrep ol MaooaXtkTrat lrbpyovs vo-rf77oLav prlla77Ia . . .a :OLKELOMpVOL dVraTl rpobrov l77y X'cpaC.) In later Gallo-Roman times the walls were made higher and strengthened by towers. The original blocks vary greatly in length and height (two to three meters by 39 to 59 cms.) and are in some cases marked with rude letters, B, K (perhaps KaTrw, as being found on the lower face), A, T, V and U. Fragments.-W. ZUCHNER publishes (Arch. Anz., 1936, cols. 305-334) the results of a prelimi- nary investigation of fragments of architecture and sculpture in the Asklepieion at Athens and on the Acropolis. There are about fifteen thousand. Sixty-two pieces belong to a marble sima, pre- viously assigned to the old temple of Athena; Ziichner doubts this assignation; each side of the gable measured at least 9.50 m. There are some two hundred pieces of the sima assigned to the Peisistratean temple, and many pieces of other simas already known. About half of the antefixes of the Parthenon exist in part; four are replace- ments of Roman times. Two fragments of ceiling- coffers of the Parthenon permit the reconstruc- tion of the painted ornament. There are three antefixes from the Nike temple; twenty-seven, all Roman, from the Erechtheum. The kalypters of these antefixes are of two types, one rounded, one straight; the latter may belong to the north porch. From the Erechtheum there are also Lesbian cymatia and pieces of the figures of the frieze. Thirty-five fragments belong to bases, several in the form of Ionic capitals. Fragments of sculp- ture are numerous; the only one illustrated be- longs to a peplos statue of ca. 480 B.C. SCULPTURE Amazons. - Four mounted Amazons, respec- tively in the Naples Museum, the Palazzo Pa- trizi, the National Museum at Rome (from Anzio), and the Villa Borghese, have been recognized by A. SCHOBER as copied from a single series; partly by comparison with the frieze of the temple at Magnesia, he placed this series in the second half of the second century B.C.; and since he followed earlier students in identifying it with the dedica- tion of Attalos on the Acropolis at Athens, he con- cluded that it was Attalos II who made the dedi- cation. There is, however, no definite evidence for a connection between these Amazons and the Attalid monument. On the contrary, as compared with pieces surely derived from it, they are senti- mental and lack expressiveness and variety; none of them is made of grey-blue marble; the surface of the plinths is different; the proportions are dif- ferent and inconsistent among themselves, show- ing disregard of structure. The mounted Ama- zons, then, have nothing to do with the series in Athens. The Borghese and Anzio sculptures have foes for the Amazons, added by copyists; in the former the additions show late Hellenistic style, in the latter Antonine. The originals of these two Amazons made a pair; presumably the other two would have pendants also; there would thus be at least six originally. A bronze statuette found at Mogilowo in Bulgaria is probably derived from the pendant of the Patrizi type; this is confirmed by groups on Roman sarcophagi, which also show other imitations of the series. A fragment in Florence does not belong to this series, but is a male Niobid; here again sarcophagi offer evidence.</page><page sequence="9">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 615 It is the only representative in the round, so far known, of a Niobid group made fairly early in the second century, probably in Rhodes; from this group the originals of the Amazons were imitated. (B. SCHWEITZER, Jb. Arch. I. li, 1936, pp. 158- 174.) Erechtheum. - C. BLiMEL publishes (Jb. Arch. I. li, 1936, pp. 154-157) a small female head, evidently from a relief, bought in Switzerland and taken to Berlin. It could well belong to the frieze of the Erechtheum; by its size, to a seated figure. Among the known fragments of the frieze there is no head really comparable. The Hermes with Infant Dionysos at Olym- pia. - Commenting on H. W. Law's suggestion (J.H.S. Ivi, 1936, p. 236; A.J.A. xli, 1937, p. 321) that the second-century pedestal on which the "Hermes of Praxiteles " once stood marks the date of the removal of the statue to the Heraeum from some other place, S. CASSON remarks that, considering the number of empty bases which must have been in existence at all Greek shrines after the Romans had carried off their booty to Italy, no inference at all about this particular statue can safely be made from the pedestal. (J.H.S. Ivii, 1937, p. 80.) Herakles and Eurystheus at Knossos.-A broken and badly weathered marble relief, which was found in 1903, covering a Roman drain at the Villa Ariadne near Knossos, shows a full-length, nude figure of Herakles, striding to the right and carrying the boar on his left shoulder, about to drop it on the head of Eurystheus, which emerges from a pithos on the ground in front of him. The Herakles is of the Myronian type, with close- cropped hair and beard. His right hand is raised, grasping the shoulder of the boar, which lies with legs in the air and head hanging down in front. The lion skin, folded under the boar, hangs down behind the figure of Herakles, and there are traces of the quiver and club. Variations of this subject occur on a metope at Olympia, where the hero is clothed and carries the boar on his head, while the shoulders of Eurystheus are well out of the jar; on a much-damaged metope of the Theseum, on which Herakles stands close to the pithos with his right foot resting on the brim; and on an archaic votive relief in Athens which shows the boar car- ried tail to the front and vigorously struggling. Herakles here is nude, but wears the square-topped lion-skin cap. No Eurystheus is present. This relief may be dated at 50 B.c., the Olympia metope at 470-460, the Theseum metope at 448, and the Knossos relief between the last two, per- haps at 455. The legend told in the Hymn to Pythian Apollo that Cretans were brought from Knossos to establish religious rites at Delphi indicates an early religious centre here. The chief temple at Knossos in Hellenistic times was dedi- cated to Apollo Delphidios or Delphinios. Frag- ments of Daedalic sculpture found here may be from an earlier temple. The Herakles metope now shows that this was rebuilt, apparently in the Doric style, about the middle of the fifth cen- tury. Another marble relief in Crete (Rethymno Museum) is a stele showing an athlete pausing beside a tree to the left, carrying his strigil and oil-flask in the left hand, while his dog sniffs at a bird with outspread wings which he holds in his right hand. The head is missing. The artist has emphasized beauty of outline rather than mus- cular development. The position of this work in the series of such stelae suggests a date about 460 B.c. This and the stele of an archer, of which the head alone is preserved at Candia, are prob- ably imported, perhaps from Paros, and are certainly not by the artist of the Herakles metope. The Herakles and Eurystheus scene occurs again, in a greatly inferior design, in a clay mould for terracotta plaques found at Girgenti and belong- ing in the last quarter of the sixth century. (S. BENTON, J.H.S. lvii, 1937, pp. 38-43.) VASES Attic Lekythoi at Canterbury.- Four Attic lekythoi in the Beany Institute at Canterbury are pictured and briefly described by G. C. COOK in J.H.S. Ivii, 1937, pp. 81-82. Three are red- figured, and the scenes are Nike before an altar (twice) and a woman's toilet, all by the painter of the r.-f. pyxis at Bowdoin College. The fourth, a white lekythos, shows a man and a woman with offerings, standing on either side of a tall grave stele with anthemion top. This one has outlines and some details in yellow and light gray. The four were all found in Athens in 1821-23, and are part of a collection presented in 1844 by Viscount Strangford, whose son was at the time M.P. for Canterbury. An Etruscan Imitation of an Attic Cup.-It is well known that Etruscan artists imitated the designs on vases imported from Attica, but it is unusual to have both the original and the copy preserved. This seems to be the case with an Etruscan red-figured kylix now in the Rodin</page><page sequence="10">616 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY Museum in Paris and an Attic kylix from Vulci in the Vatican. The scenes on both are revels of satyrs, with four figures on each side of the Vatican kylix and only three on the copy, the latter being several centimeters smaller; but the correspondence in these six figures is striking in spite of minor differences of attitude and details, as well as of technique. The two vases are not far apart in date, between 470 and 450 B.C. Probably the Attic vase, when imported into Etruria, was used in a workshop before being sold, and then remained in Vulci, while the copy was exported to Apulia. Its history can be traced, with gaps, back to 1836; it has meanwhile suffered breakage, with some losses and the addition of a false foot. A retrograde inscription on the interior is read: AULES V[I]PENAS, perhaps a signature. Rodin was greatly interested in antiques and studied them closely. His Bacchus a la cuve seems to have been suggested by the tipsy satyr trying to bal- ance himself on the bottom of a krater turned upside down, who appears in the central medallion of this piece. His collection, though little known, includes some seventy vases hitherto unpublished. (N. PLAOUTINE, J.H.S. lvii, 1937, pp. 99- 927.) Vases in Bonn.- A. GREIFENHAGEN publishes (Arch. Anz. 1936, cols. 343-406) fifty-one non- Attic black-figured vases and fragments, not previously well published, in Bonn. The collection contains about one hundred and thirty-five such vases. The discussions are brief but scholarly. Included are: an Early Corinthian alabastron with a serpent devouring a man (No. 6); a Cum- aean cup with human features in relief (No. 21); an Aeolic pitcher (No. 92); a neat Vroulian amphora (No. 98); several plastic vases; a well-- preserved Ionic amphora, not closely placed (No. 45); an aryballos of top-like form, with the incised inscription, MEvat6as ELE EoFEoE Xaport, which is probably Boeotian (No. 49). Wedding Scene.-L. DEUBNER publishes (Jb. Arch. I. li, 1936, pp. 175-179) a small bowl, in Bonn, with a wedding scene. The drawing is poor, the period late fifth century. The bride and groom are about to enter their cart, drawn by mules. A youth holds two torches, to avert evil spirits rather than to give light. The bride is completely veiled; this, though found in no other wedding picture, probably was the actual practice; good painters made the face visible for artistic reasons. The bride's house is shown with a gabled roof. Beside the door are strokes representing the KopvOXrlX7 (branches of laurel twined with wool) displayed when sons became ephebes or daughters were married. The house possesses other remark- able features, which are interpreted as a colon- nade on the second floor, opening on an interior court, and an exterior stair. EPIGRAPHY Some Pre-Roman Inscriptions in Cyprus.- The first installment of a projected small Corpus of Cypriote inscriptions, fruits of a visit to the island in 1936, includes eleven numbers. One of them, at Polis (Marion-Arsinoe), on what was apparently an upright at the doorway of a sub- terranean tomb, is in the Cypriote syllabary characters, retrograde, and gives a new variatioll of the sign for ri. Of the ten in Greek letters, all later than 300 B.C., one at Hagios Tychon (Am- athus) affords the first evidence of the worship of Zeus Meilichios in Cyprus. Most of the others refer in some way to the contemporary Ptolemy, from Soter down, or to the Egyptian forces in the island. Several are additional parts of texts al- ready published, or in some way supplement or explain their contents. The unusual use of the nominative for the person honored occurs once. New for Cyprus are the names Epinikos, Myrsine, and Hyperbassos. So is the lampadephoria, and the joint appearance of Hermes and Herakles as patrons of a gymnasium at Kythraea (Chytroi). Several stones now found at Famagusta were doubtless brought by the Venetians from the ruins of Salamis, four miles to the north. (T. B. MIT- FORD, J.H.S. ]vii, 1937, pp. 28-37.) A Charitable Foundation of A.D. 237.- Two Greek inscriptions, a deed of gift and an honorary decree, which were copied by W. M. Ramsay and J. R. S. Sterrett in 1883, are now published for the first time in full by W. H. BUCKLER. They record the establishment of a perpetual fund of the value of two thousand five hundred Attic drachmas for the benefit of his fellow-townsmen by one Varius Aurelius Marcus of Orcistus, a place on the borders of Phrygia and Galatia. The income of one thousand drachmas, to be set aside and known as the Corn-Purchase Fund, is to provide a pound loaf of bread for each villager annually, and that of the other fifteen hundred is to be spent for a banquet in the Gymnasium, for all the people, on Happiness Day each year. The decree provides that, in recognition of the gener- osity of the said Varius Aurelius Marcus, on this and other occasions, a statue with inscription</page><page sequence="11">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 617 shall be erected at public expense in some con- spicuous place, as an honor to be enjoyed by his children and descendants. It also provides for the investment and administration of the fund by the archons of each year and the town clerk. Both documents were sealed by the archons and in the second case by witnesses as well, but signed by the town clerk, Aurelius Bassion, who had prob- ably received the money, and the decree was filed by the Keeper of Records. Orcistus did not at this time have a city government with a boule, but was a town, KW/l27, with a council of Elders, yepovata, who had front seats in the ecclesia. These documents, copied from a basis which was later destroyed, are of interest both as examples of the procedure in such cases and for the details of this particular case. (J.H.S. Ivii, 1937, pp. 1-10.) Inscription from Thasos.-The stone was found at Thasos in 1934 in a corner of an old con- vent, which served as a museum and which was torn down to make way for the new museum. It is approximately six inches in height, six and a half inches in width and three inches thick. Its upper, front, and side surfaces are polished; its rear sur- face and the under surface, which was found broken, are only roughly hewn. This stone prob- ably was set with its rear surface against some wall and driven into the ground. On the front ap- pears in neat clear-cut letters the inscription: A10*JKTH IOrPAITP.IO. This dates from the end of the fifth or the beginning of the fourth century B.C. The text suggests that the stone marked the site of a spot connected with the cult of Zeus. This stone and its inscription are com- pared with two other similar stones: the one found by M. G. Mendel in the same quarter; the other found by M. P. Perdrizet at Kariani at the foot of Mt. Pangee in Macedonia. (P. GUILLON, R. Arch. ix, 1937, pp. 195-200.) NUMISMATICS Alexander Tetradrachms.- In Nunm. Notes and Mons. No. 77, CHARLES C. TORREY makes a study of Semitic graffiti on nine Alexander tetra- drachms belonging to the Demanhur hoard pub- lished by E. T. Newell in No. 19 of the same series some years ago. Torrey establishes a fact that has been frequently denied, namely that the Jews in Egypt, while using Greek for general purposes, never entirely abandoned the use of their own Aramaic among themselves. Evidence to support this is found also in the papyri emanating from Jewish sources in Egypt during the Hellenistic period. CZECHOSLOVAKIA Prehistoric Portraiture. - In Ill. L. N., October 2, 1937, pp. 550-553, the most recent discoveries from the site of the prehistoric settlement at Vestonice in Czechoslovakia are described by Dr. KARL ABSOLON, leader of the expedition. There is a brief introduction and comment on the impor- tance of the finds by Sir Arthur Keith, F.R.S. Dr. Absolon dates the occupation of this site by mammoth-hunters of the Diluvial Period about thirty thousand. years ago. Among the most im- portant of the numerous finds were spoons with handles carved from rhinoceros shoulder-blades. These are the first spoons with handles that can be dated earlier than the Neolithic Age. Notches cut in spears and other objects in clear groups of five are taken as an indication that Diluvial man knew how to count. The most amazing discovery was a small ivory head, a little under two inches in height. This is the first palaeolithic portrait ever found. It is described by the author as rep- resenting a man, but Sir Arthur Keith believes it is a woman. The article is profusely illustrated. A consid- erably enlarged picture of the portrait head is used as a frontispiece. JUGOSLAVIA Trebeniste.- In the Anqlo-Yugoslav Review iii, pp. 101-104, NIKOLA VULIC summarizes the recent discoveries at Trebeni'te. Since the World War, six new graves of special value have been opened. Among the interesting finds have been two gold masks of a type known at Mycenae, a large silver drinking horn, and several important vases, some of them of Attic workmanship. The author believes that we have here a necropolis of various Illyrian princes and nobles, who were able to import Corinthian and Attic goods. Perhaps their city was near the present Ohrid, perhaps the ancient city of Luchnidos. In the failure to find actual ruins of a city from this period, this must be a mere conjecture. Heraclea.-In the South Slav Herald vi, p. 5, announcement is made of preliminary work by the municipality of Bitolj in excavating the Graeco- Roman city of Heraclea. Also there have been discovered a basilica with numerous magnificent and well-preserved mosaics, and various other works, and Roman inscriptions.</page><page sequence="12">618 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY U.S.S.R. Recent Archaeological Discoveries Throughout the Soviet Union.- Three reports which provide a background for these more recent notes have been published in the American Anthropologist (E. Golomstock, "Anthropological Activities in So- viet Russia," Vol. xxxv, 1933, pp. 301-327; Henry Field and Eugene Prostov, "Recent Ar- chaeological Investigations in the Soviet Union," xxxviii, 1936, pp. 260-990; and "Archaeology in the Soviet Union," xxxix, 1937, pp. 457- 490). The general arrangement of the material below has been treated geographically under the headings Abkhazia, Azerbaidzhan, North Cau- casus, Crimea and Black Sea Region. The maps, drawn at Field Museum by Richard A. Martin and published in the 1936 report, may be used as reference. Abkhazia.-The following resume of the work of expeditions in Abkhazia during 1935-1936 was received from A. KASHBA, Director, and L. SOLOV'EV of the Institute of Abkhazian Culture (AbNIIK) of the Georgian Branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences. 1. In 1934 an expedition from the Institute of Anthropology and Ethnography (IAE) of the State Academy of Sciences, Leningrad, and the AbNIIK under the leadership of I. I. MESHCHA- NINOV excavated dolmens near Kiur Dere. Among the objects of particular interest was a bronze trident of fine workmanship. Urn burials, yield- ing objects of Koban type, were unearthed near Esheri. 2. In 1935-36 L. N. SoLov'Ev of AbNIIK, assisted by M. M. IVASHCHENKO of the Archae- ological Institute of the Commissariat of Edu- cation of Georgia, excavated near Ochemchiri a large tumulus, built in the fifth century B.c. The excavators suggest that this mound was con- structed in order to prepare a convenient building surface in the middle of the marshes to serve as part of a commercial harbor for the coastwise trade of Greek merchants. It is probable that this harbor was mentioned in the Periplus (fourth century B.C.), wrongly attributed to Scylax of Caryanda (first half of the sixth century B.c.) under the name of Gyenus (Huenos: the Rus- sian transliteration is Giuenos), a river and city of Colchis on the eastern shore of the Black Sea and west of Georgia. Many sherds of imported black polished ware were found, together with a bronze armlet and a bird-shaped gold pendant, which are unique in the Caucasus. Re-established during the Roman epoch, the settlement flourished throughout the Middle Ages and later, being mentioned in the seventeenth century by the Italian traveller, Angelico Lamberti, under the name Tguanas. At the base of the tumulus and on the adjoining level platform was uncovered an aeneolithic site, settled by the builders of the early dolmens and attributed to the first half of the second millen- nium B.C. Since there had been a change in level, the cultural stratum, partly submerged under the sea, was covered by a thick layer of deposits. Here was a curious cultural complex, possessed of traits which heretofore were deemed typical of several distinct epochs. Stone implements predominated. Flint implements, typologically Upper Palaeolithic, included gravers, Font- Robert points, etc. Microlithic sickle-blades and triangular notched arrowheads showed delicate pressure flaking, typical of the early dolmen pe- riod. The majority of the tools, made of sea peb- bles (schist, diorite, granite), represent knives, chisels, gouges, scrapers, axes, and net-sinkers. No polished implements were present, but there were some bone tools (awls). Agricultural imple- ments such as sickles, stone hoes, and handmills were more in abundance than those used for hunt- ing or animal husbandry. Animal bones belonged almost exclusively to domesticated animals, es- pecially Bos, less frequently Sus, and more rarely Capra and Ovis. The pottery offers a great variety of forms and is characterized by a hand-made coil technique. 3. ZAMIATNIN, in his report entitled "Paleolit Abkhazii," describes nine Upper Palaeolithic sites, twenty-three Mousterian sites, and ten older sites which he ascribes to the Acheulian and Clac- tonian periods. In 1936 Zamiatnin excavated a grotto containing Mousterian deposits near Adler in northern Abkhazia. He also discovered another grotto with Mousterian remains near Sochi. Last year L. N. SOLOV'EV conducted geological explorations, as a result of which it became possi- ble to coirdinate cultural stages of the Palaeolithic period with various sea terraces and phenomena of glaciation. He will publish these results. Near Tsebelda was found a grotto containing Upper Palaeolithic stone implements and human bones. Lower Palaeolithic implements were excavated near Sukhum. 4. In 1936 L. N. SOLov'Ev discovered several "Eolithic" sites, the most important located near</page><page sequence="13">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 619 the villages of Andreevskoe and Neidorf (Neu- dorff). At Andreevskoe ashes, charcoal, and num- erous wooden implements, awls, pins, and other pointed tools predominating, were uncovered in a stratum of peat. The largest specimens included hoes, some of which had near the pointed end twisted (or braided) thongs of vegetable fibers. The same cultural layer yielded animal bones and flint and limestone, unretouched implements of "Eolithic" type. From the geological evidence this site was attributed to the Mindel glaciation. In a stratum of interglacial peat, overlaid with thick moraine deposits, another discovery of many well-preserved wooden implements, typo- logically akin to those from Andreevskoe, was made in the neighborhood of Neidorf near Suk- hum. No stone tools were present. In addition to the work being done in Abkhazia by AbNIIK, an expedition from GAIMK (Gosu- darstvennaia Akademiia Istorii Material'noi Kul'tury) explored the region to be occupied by the Sukhum hydroelectric station. A large cave in the gorge of the western Gumista River, and several tumuli were excavated yielding sherds and whetstones of the Mediaeval period. Two Bronze Age sites were investigated. Azerbaidzhan.- The following important con- clusions resulted from the 1935 excavations of Bronze Age tumuli (Gummel, Sovetskaza Arkheo- logii'a i, 1936, pp. 213-214): (a) The majority of the tumuli are family burial grounds with multiple burials; both individual and collective burials are represented by the graves. (b) Family tumuli were planned in the following manner: A point A was determined as the "sun of the tumulus"; a N 5 6 -- s % \~ \ 4% % ??. J S I , I 0 1 2 METERS W-E line was drawn through point A forming the "main diameter of the tumulus." Another point, representing the center of the future tumulus, was determined in the middle of the "main diam- eter." Lines from the first point to the periphery of the tumulus served as axes for the graves. These were in some cases parallel to the sides of the grave and in the other cases diagonal. (c) Hence, the rule for the ray-like orientation of graves, verified on sixteen tumuli, may be stated as follows: a ray from the "sun of the tumulus," located on its "main diameter " must coincide with either the principal or with the diagonal axis of the grave. (d) This rule permits us to explain apparently irregular orientation of burials etc., as well as to consider mathematical and astro- nomical knowledge of the people etc. (e) This rule permits restoration of partly obliterated tumuli, their simplified mapping, discovery of later buri- als, and discovery of overlooked burials in previ- ously excavated tumuli. (f) The "sun of the tumulus" "sending its rays into the tombs," determined the location of the skeletons as much as the apparent movement of the sun across the skies. North Caucasus. -The Mozdok Expedition of GAIMK (M. A. MILLER, leader) worked on a site beside the tracks of the North Caucasian Railroad. Twenty-two burials, the majority of them in three tumuli, were excavated, together with a portion of an ancient settlement. A cul- tural layer one meter thick in the latter contained sherds of homogeneous pottery of the sixth to the fourth centuries B.C., and some animal bones. Graves of the first to fourth centuries A.D. yielded numerous skeletons, including a deformed cranium, of the type commonly associated with burials on the plains near the Volga. Another group of discoveries were tumuli of the so-called late nomads, attributed to the sixth to the tenth centuries. Thus this site, located on a promontory surrounded by the old bed of the Terek River, was found to be rich in remains of widely separated epochs, covering a span of at least fifteen centuries. Of exceptional interest here were the remains of the ancient Scythian period. Crimea and Black Sea Region.- According to SELIVANOV (Sovetskaia Arkheologi?ia ii, 1937, pp. 921-9227) the excavations at Olvia (Olbia), sus- pended in 1932, were continued under the joint sponsorship of GAIMK and ANU (Akademiia Nauk Ukraini). The expedition, led by L. M.</page><page sequence="14">620 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY SLAVIN and F. N. MOLCHANOVSKII, uncovered an entire city quarter of the Hellenistic period. Several important buildings, including a temple and a communal dwelling, were found. These buildings, partly excavated during previous sea- sons, were measured and a report prepared for publication. A section of the northern defensive city wall, two to three meters thick, was studied, and about a hundred meters of the clay subfoun- dation of the wall was uncovered. Some seven hundred square meters were ex- cavated in the port section of Olvia. The Roman stratum, two to three meters thick, was exam- ined in 1935. A large cultural complex of the second to third centuries A.D. was brought to light, including the remains of two bakeries con- taining ovens with very large aprons. Work was also carried on in the necropolis. Among impor- tant objects recovered from two burial vaults were about one hundred golden objects, including sixty-three leaves from a wreath. The Kerch Expedition (cf. Field and Prostov, American Anthropologist xxxix, 1937, pp. 468-469) of GAIMK, begun by O. O. Kruger, was continued under V. F. Gaidukevich for its third year of study of the social and economic life of the ancient Bosphorus. This expedition consisted of two sections, one of which carried on excavations five kilometers southeast of the cities of Tiritaka-Dia and Myrmikia, another on the Kamysh-Burun River ten kilometers south of Kerch, formerly Panticapea, the capital of Pontus. The work in the Kamysh-Burun area culmi- nated in the complete uncovering of a defensive wall, three meters thick, attributed to the fifth century before our era. Water conduits (sewers) leading away from the town were discovered in connection with the wall. Remains of later fisheries were found in the settlement when the wall was destroyed. This included a complex of fish-salting cisterns, and the remains of a large building con- taining fifteen millstones, granaries with remains of wheat, animal bones, pottery etc. Two large wineries were discovered in Myrmi- kia. These were characterized by slanting con- crete platforms, each divided into three sections, terminating in reservoirs for grape juice. The grapes were sorted and pressed by foot in the side sections. The final pressing was done mechanically in the central section where the stone pediment of a large press was found. The study of the plastering utilized wherever the buildings came in contact with the grape juice, disclosed the ex- tremely durable character of solutions used by the builders. Many Roman sherds were discov- ered in the remains of the wineries.

BYZANTINE AND MEDIAEVAL Cyprus as a Fashion Centre. -Professor Talbot Rice recently undertook an expedition to Cyprus, on behalf of the Courtauld Institute in London, in an attempt to corroborate the statements of mediaeval historians and later travellers that Cyprus held an important position in commercial fields during the Middle Ages. It had been stated that Cyprus was one of the most important cen- tres of textile manufacture, and was also re- nowned for metalwork. The costumes portrayed on Cypriote ikons were studied. They are obvi- ously made of fine textiles, distinguishable from any made either in Byzantium or the West. The artists, therefore, were probably copying material of local manufacture. Cyprus was a very popular place to which to travel in early mediaeval times, and Cypriote knights also went west and partici- pated in tournaments in Spain and London. Cypriote costume influenced western court attire. One piece of Cypriote costume, called the cypri- ana, was said to have been "all the rage" at one time. The results of this expedition are discussed by TAMARA TALBOT RICE in Ill. L. N., August 7, 1937, pp. 246-247. The Bollandists. -Although not directly of archaeological interest, one may not omit mention of the review which prefaces this issue of the Analecta Bollandiana Iv, 1937, pp. v-xliv. A hundred years ago, in January 1837, the Bolland- ists resumed their work on the monumental Acta Sanctorum. A Jesuit group, the Bollandists suf- fered severely when the Society was suppressed. Undaunted they carried on for over forty years, much handicapped by the loss of their library and means of support and publication. This article briefly notices with historical sobriety the misfortunes of the dark days of the period of Enlightenment and Revolution and then pro- ceeds to tell of the happier, though often very anxious times since 1837, a century of gradual recovery and development, the fruit of which</page><page sequence="15">ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS AND DISCUSSIONS 621 today commands the respect of scholars of every race and creed the world over. Of the five articles, which with book reviews make up this issue, only one (pp. 1-28) by FATHER DE JERPHANION on the characteristics and at- tributes of saints in Cappadocian painting is of immediate value to the archaeologist. Asymmetry in Mediaeval Architecture. -In La Critica d'Arle ii, 1937, pp. 66-76, L. CREMA considers the problem of the significance of asym- metry in mediaeval architecture. He gives a number of interesting examples among the Italian Romanesque churches, and mentions several sug- gested explanations. His conclusion is that, al- though the laws of perspective were known and sometimes employed, the planimetric alterations do not represent a series of systematic attempts to correct or create particular effects of perspec- tive. Basilica of S. Aquilino in Milan.-In La Cri- tica d'Arte ii, 1937, pp. 55-65, C. ALBIZZATI publishes plates and a detailed description of the large marble portal of the basilica of S. Aquilino in Milan. The portal, hitherto not adequately known to students of Roman art, is interesting from the point of view of the development of decorative sculpture. It is an unusual example of the work of the early period of the empire, and in the elaboration of its carving seems to announce the taste of the later Romanesque period. Cathedral of Benevento. -In L'Arte viii, 1937, pp. 90-109, P. DELLA PERGOLA discusses in detail the iconography and style of the bronze doors of the cathedral of Benevento. After a summary of variois opinions concerning date and attribution he states his own theory, that the differences of style seen in the panels indicate the work of two men, one working not later than the end of the twelfth century, the other working not earlier than the middle of the thirteenth. Correggio.-In L'Arte viii, 1937, p. 133, A. VENTURI publishes a portrait of a woman painted in 1517 by Correggio. It is the earliest extant work known by this artist. Maiolica.-In Faenza xxv, 1937, pp. 3-14, G. LIVERANI discusses the problem of the origin of Italian maiolica. While giving some credit to the theory of oriental inspiration suggested by Frederick O. Waag6 (Hesperia iii, 1934), he points out possible prototypes in Italy and be- lieves that there is not enough evidence to arrive at a definite conclusion. Sculpture of Bartolommeo Ammannati.-In La Critica d'Arte ii, 1937, pp. 89-95, A. GABRI- ELLI discusses the stylistic development in the sculpture of Bartolommeo Ammannati, and attributes to him on the basis of style and the evidence of early writers the statues of David and Judith at the tomb of Sannazzaro in S. Maria del Prato, Naples, and the bronze satyr in Vienna. Among other works discussed at length are the relief sculptures of the archway of the Villa Benavides, Padua; the allegorical figure in the Museo Civico and a tomb statue in the Eremi- tani, Padua; the Del Monte tomb in Rome; the fountain of the Piazza della Signoria, Florence; and the Bacchus of the fountain of Borgo S. Jacopo. Venetian Drawings. -In La Critica d'Arte ii, 1937, pp. 77-88, HANS TIETZE and E. TIETZE- CONRAT discuss the characteristics of Venetian drawings of the first half of the sixteenth century. They make some attributions on the basis of style and discuss, in particular, the drawings of Veronese, Antonio Aliense, Titian, Domenico Campagnola, Giorgione, and Lorenzo Lotto. Early Valencian Painting. -In Archivo Espanfol de Arte y Arqueologia vii, 1936, pp. 239-250, the BARON DE SAN PETRILLO continues his accounts of the histories of early Valencian paintings. The first account is that of the late fourteenth century altar-piece of Saura de Besaldfi in the old church of the Sangre in the town of Liria. This shows a Crucifixion above, a Madonna and Child below, St. Vincent and St. Stephen in the center, and, on the sides, eight scenes from the lives of these saints. In the same church is the altar-piece of St. Anthony of the Capelliure Chapel. It is crudely done and interesting only for its iconography. The third account is that of the Vincente Gil retable, executed about 1428 for the church of San Juan del Hospital, of Valencia. At present some of its panels are in the Metropolitan Mu- seum and some in the collection of the Hispanic Society in New York. Fifteenth Century Retable.- In Butlleti dels Museus d'Arte de Barcelona viii, 1937, pp. 65-71, 97-112, and 129-139, J. FOLCH I TORRES gives an account of the history, iconography, style, and recent restoration of the fifteenth century retable of the " Conestable," formerly in the chapel of St. Agatha in the old Pla(a del Rei, but now in the Barcelona Museum. This triptych represents the Epiphany, a slightly smaller one just above rep- resents the Crucifixion, and the side panels show the Annunciation, Nativity, Resurrection, Ascen-</page><page sequence="16">629 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY sion, Pentecost, and the Death of the Virgin. He also discusses in some detail the architectural structure of the altar-piece and gives documentary evidence concerning its date and its relation to other works of Huguet. Juan de Zamora.- In Archivo Espailol de Arte y Arqueologia xii, 1936, pp. 239-250, D. A. IISIGUEZ discusses the similar style of three paint- ings by Juan de Zamora, a contemporary of Alejo Fernandez. These works are the Virgen de los Remedios in Santa Ana, Seville (formerly at- tributed to the Master of the Virgin of the Rose), and two altar-pieces of the collegiate church of Osuna. There is a brief summary of the life of the artist and some documentary evidence concerning these and other works by Zamora.</page><page sequence="17">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS PLATE XXI Great excitement was aroused in Greek arch- aeological circles this past summer by the return to Athens of an archaic marble statue (Fig. 1), a shipped to Paris. When found the Apollo was in- tact except where the legs had been broken off below the knees. According to one of the peasants FIG. 1.- ARCHAIC APOLLO IN THE NATIONAL MUSEUM AT ATHENS sixth-century kouros, which had been smuggled out of Greece in 1932. The statue, which is over life size, had been found by peasants during illicit digging at Anavyssos, about twenty miles south- east of Athens, and sold to a dealer who had it the feet were discovered a short distance away, probably still standing where the figure had originally been erected; but all real archaeological evidence has been lost or destroyed by the diggers. As they also found the statue too heavy to handle 623</page><page sequence="18">624 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY easily, they placed large stones under its back and thighs and struck it with another stone on the stomach near the navel, causing it to break in the center. The pieces were first hidden in the grass and later in a stable. After its sale to the dealer it was taken at night to the little port of Oropos and there buried in the sand for several days. It was later loaded on a sailboat and transshipped to a steamer bound for a foreign port. While the dealer was negotiating for the sale of the statue in Paris, village rumors led to the discovery of the affair and the arrest of the peasants. They were tried, convicted and sentenced to varying terms of im- prisonment and fines. The dealer likewise was condemned by default to eight years imprison- ment and a fine of forty million drachmae but the exact hiding place of the statue could not be ascertained. Five years later the dealer was appre- hended in Paris, but could not be extradited under French law. Soon after his release, however, he decided to surrender the statue to the Greek authorities, and in July 1937 the three cases con- taining the ten pieces of the kouros were turned over to the Greek Legation in Paris, whence they were escorted back to Athens on the Orient Ex- press by four police officers. The statue is now in the National Museum, where it is being put to- gether again. The kouros measures about 2 m. in height, and is of Attic workmanship like the one in the Metropolitan Museum, but later in date, belonging to the second half of the sixth century. In the course of the flood-prevention work now being carried out in the bed of the Kephissos river, near the powder factory, a very fine grave relief was found. It is of the naiskos type with pediment, with three figures, two bearded men and a woman, all standing. In the Kerameikos the continuation of the ex- cavations between the Dipylon Gate and the Tomb of the Lacedaemonians, carried out by the German Institute from November 1936 to Janu- ary 1937, has shown that the clay-brick wall formerly assigned to an archaic burial monument 1 is in reality the inner enclosing wall of the long- sought heating room for the Circular Bath. This discovery suggests that the round building with the terrazzo floor must have been a vapor bath. The Bath and its accompanying heating room show four building periods, which fall between 486 and 404-3 B.c., since the circular structure was not used after the building of the Lacedaemonian Tomb, and on a wall beneath it was found an os- trakon, the inscription of which forces us to date it as later than the year 486. Scratched on the upper and lower sides and edge of a cylix stem is MEAAKL-EEI HIPPOKRATO% AMLOPEKE- E EN .2 The purpose of the heating room is indicated by the successive layers of burned matter. In its earliest construction-period the room had care- fully built stone walls on three sides, faced with clay brick on the interior, while the fourth wall, on the side toward the Bath, is built entirely of clay brick. Within these walls was cut the earliest fire box, its shape like a broad trough with rounded corners, resembling the potters' kilns found in January, 1937, above the fourth-century Street of Tombs, at the eastern corner of the site for the new museum.3 The practical use of this trough in the heating room of the Bath is not clear. The three following periods change the arrangement - the foundations of the walls of the room now con- sist of large blocks, the floor is covered with pav- ing slabs and a trough is left only in front of, and under, the north wall, opening into the adjoining room. Apparently it was from this side that the fire was built under the tripod above the trough. The kettle in which the water was to vaporize would have rested on the tripod and when heated would have been carried into the vapor bath. Small pits with vessels set in them, perhaps for holding soap and ointment needed by the bathers, were cut in the floor and particles of a tallow-like substance were found in an adjoining room. The water from the Bath was not carried off by the three underground channels, as had been formerly assumed, but probably emptied into the open ditches running along the street. It was only in Hellenistic times that the use of these ditches was finally abandoned and a tunnel driven down into the rock, although some of the channels had been filled up during the second half of the fifth century. In this same region more than a hundred foun- dation pits for wooden posts had been cut, the greater part of them during the period of the Peloponnesian war. The excavators are now in- clined to believe that these were used for the erec- tion of the high platforms from which the funeral orations for those who had fallen in the war were 1 A. A. 1936, p. 213. 2 Note the mention of the deme and the use of the dative which is known in the Agora collection only on a later example: KAAAIAI AIAYMIO (Prosopogr. Att. I, 7823). In the Agora the name appears twice on sherds as: M EAAK LEE . 3 See below p. 625.</page><page sequence="19">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 625 delivered, near the public graves.4 Since the dead were presumably buried together each year of the war, it would entail the building of the platforms annually and thus explain the great number of post-holes. The first public tomb beyond the cross street opposite the Bath, which from its position might be that of Anthemokritos, has not yet been excavated. It appears, however, to belong to the fourth century and is certainly later than the Lacedaemonian Tomb, which makes this attribu- tion doubtful. It was badly damaged in later times. Before this region, included between the City Wall, the Eridanos, the side road to the Piraeus and the Processional Way to the Academy, was built up with the Bath establishment, it was ceme- tery land, but appears never to have been very popular. In the section between the Roman marble sarcophagus in front of the Dipylon Gate and the Circular Bath, were found three graves of post- Mycenaean date, twenty-two of Geometric times, and four belonging to the later sixth century. The post-Mycenaean graves lay at the extreme southwest and may be taken as a sort of outlying fringe of the necropolis under the Pompeion. One of these, containing a male skeleton, is important, as the burial was not made in the rectangular grave pit itself, but in a cavity hollowed out on the long side, which was closed with three tiles; these, however, had fallen when the grave was covered, and were found lying side by side on the floor of the tomb. With the skeleton were laid two of the usual jugs, decorated on the shoulder with hand- drawn semicircles, and a well preserved sword. The neighboring grave, lying approximately at right angles to the first, was that of a youthful woman, whose right arm, folded across the breast, held a jug, while the left hand was brought up to the chin. On the floor of the grave lay scattered the remains of a bone ornament, probably delib- erately broken, perhaps a pin for fastening her garment. The grave was covered with stone slabs and had not been cut straight in the ground but ran in a somewhat curving line, to which the posi- tion of the dead was made to correspond. The third post-Mycenaean grave forms a transition to the Geometric: it consists merely of a pit filled with ashes, in which the sherds of a pair of jugs and two iron rings were found. The Geometric graves belong, for the most part, to the second half of the eighth century. They are inhumation burials and are significant as being typical of the general re-emergence of the old manner of burial in the late Geometric period. Among them, a large amphora, containing some tiny jugs and cups, served as a child's tomb. Only three graves are earlier, namely, a badly damaged Protogeometric inhumation, a crouched burial and a cremation grave, rich in objects dating from the beginning of the eighth century.5 Graves of the Orientalizing and Early Archaic periods are lacking. The graves from the late sixth century include a child's grave (with an unpainted amphora containing two small skyphoi), a crema- tion grave with a number of shattered black- figured lekythoi, an inhumation grave with three "Lydian" ointment vessels, and a stone osteo- theke. The latter is a new type, being made of a massive rectangular poros block, hollowed out to receive a bronze urn, in which were placed the ashes of the dead and two large black-figured lekythoi. The urn was closed with a lead cover and a second poros block was laid over the one below. At the end of the fourth century tomb-robbers tried to get into it, but succeeded in lifting only half the block, leaving the contents of the urn undis- turbed. After this the region was not again used for graves until the Hadrianic period. The excava- tions of 1914-1915 had opened up most of these Roman burials, but Dr. Kubler found one still untouched. This proved to be that of a woman and contained many funerary objects: vessels of glass, buckles of bronze, bone spoons and two red clay saucers, one of which had the following inscrip- tion scratched on it: A CY P I H. The new museum for the Kerameikos is rapidly nearing completion. It is built at the far end of the fourth-century Street of Tombs, opposite the present gate on Piraeus Street, and will, I imagine, be entered from Hermes Street as well as from the Kerameikos itself. In excavating for its founda- tions some potters' kilns were found at the eastern corner of the site. On the evidence of the very few glazed sherds found with them they are dated from the fifth to the fourth century B.C. and are thus the earliest Attic potters' kilns known. They are three pear-shaped pits, cut one after the other in the same spot, with the later ones sunk more deeply into the rock than the earliest. Two of them have a central supporting wall. A line of develop- ment can be followed from the archaic circular form which we know from the Corinthian pinakes 4 Thuc. II, 34. - All these early graves will be treated in detail by Dr. Ktibler when he publishes those found under the mound of Hagia Triada.</page><page sequence="20">626 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY and which maintained itself in Troezen and Kynouria to Hellenistic times, through this new pear-shaped kiln of the Classical period, to the rectangular form. The kiln in front of the Dipylon gate of late Hellenistic times,6 has a straight rear wall only, while the one in the Pompeion, which is later than the fourth-century building but earlier than the Hadrianic reconstruction, already has a definite rectangular form.7 In the spring and early summer of 1937, the British School at Athens sent expeditions to both Siphnos and Crete. "G. M. Young and J. K. Brock continued their excavations in Siphnos for a period of just over six weeks. A number of new areas were explored, for the most part without interesting results. One Roman grave was found close to the group of first-century A.D. Roman graves excavated in 1935. It produced a silver ring and a fragmentary tall glass vase of "pinched" shape. On the north- east slope of the Kastro, a seventh-century house was excavated: the ground plan is almost com- plete and the walls better preserved than those found in 1936. "The site of an archaic necropolis was found close to the road leading to Apollonia, but unfor- tunately the whole area had been completely dis- turbed and the only finds were a few interesting sherds. "The last fortnight was spent in excavating the area at the northeast end of the Acropolis, which, by then, had been cleared of the greater part of the mediaeval and later d6bris. "On the sea side the rock was reached almost immediately: but a fine stretch of (probably) late sixth century marble wall that surrounded the acropolis was disclosed. On the inner side, where the rock fell away, a series of mediaeval cisterns seemed to preclude the possibility of earlier finds. During the last week, however, an undisturbed votive deposit came to light, associated with some early foundations which have in part escaped the mediaeval builders. One building has a rectangu- lar end and a stone base, probably for a wooden column. It is uncertain whether this was a temple, but f urther excavation may provide more evi- dence. "The richest part of the deposit dates from the first half of the seventh century, but the whole deposit, which was unstratified, covers the period from 700 to 550. The finds include ivory fibulae, beads and other objects, an ivory seal representing a centaur with a branch; a good terracotta head; an alabaster ring (Fig. 2), with a seated male figure engraved on the bezel (Fig. 3); bronze fibulae; FIG. Q. --ALABASTER RING SLIGHTLY OVER ACTUAL SIZE (Courtesy of Mr. Young) and a quantity of pottery, in- cluding some fragments of a very fine late Protocorinthian oinochoi? and two interesting anthropomorphic vases, of which unfortunately only the lower parts are preserved. FIG. 2. -ALABAS- TER RING. BEZEL (Courtesy of Mr. Young) One of these is decorated in Naxian, the other in "Siphnian" style. "The opportunity was taken to extract, under the supervision of the Greek archaeological au- thorities, an archaic marble head, either of a kouros, or of a sphinx, from the wall of a private house into which it had been built. This fragment (total length 29 cm.) is much weathered and thickly covered with white-wash on the exposed front surfaces. It has also been marked in places with a black pigment. Two holes have been drilled into it, one in the crown, and the other in the broken surface of the neck underneath. Adjoining the latter are the remains of cement, containing red particles, apparently of brick-dust. These holes and the cement suggest that the head was set up again in later times." 8 Excavations were carried out under the leader- ship of Mr. John Pendlebury, and with the assist- ance of the Craven Fund, in the area of the Lasithi plain during June 1937. "The exploration of the cave at Trapeza having been completed in 1936 the first few days were devoted to a series of tests on the same slopes, during the course of which 6 A.

Young.</page><page sequence="21">NEWS ITEMS FROM ATHENS 697 small deposits of the Neolithic, Middle Minoan I and Late Minoan III periods (the latter a larnax burial) were cleared. Next the projecting acropolis, locally known as the Kastellos, was surveyed and partially excavated. Here two burials of the Neolithic period were discovered, the first to be excavated in Crete. They were in the nature of rock shelters, the actual burial stratum being filled with small stones. A third burial was found in a cave called Skaphidhia about a kilometer away. These burials confirmed the provisional dating of the local mottled pottery decorated with faces and 'tresses' in relief, which had been found in the single pure stratum at Trapeza in 1936 and had been assigned to a traditional Neolithic- Early Minoan I date. Most of the summit of the Kastellos has been denuded, but the foundations of several houses were cleared. Unfortunately no Early Minoan plan could be recovered but suffi- cient was found to show that while the Neolithic population lived in the Trapeza Cave and buried their dead on the Kastellos, the Early Minoans lived on the Kastellos and buried their dead in Trapeza. On the northwest slopes a fine house was excavated, which provided further proof that in the provinces the Middle Minoan I period was immediately followed, with no break, by Middle Minoan III. A great number of vases was dis- covered, forming the basis for a corpus of local pottery types. "After a sufficient number of tests had been made in this region the work moved to the neigh- bouring village of Lagou where the cutting of the newly constructed car road had brought to light a quantity of archaic terracottas. It was found the modern road follows almost exactly the ancient paved road, to the south of which lay a large public building which has been partially cleared. To the north of the road the facade of a big archaic house was excavated. The chief point of interest was a rough baetylic stone set in the pavement before the front door. Only the facade and the porch were cleared as well as a room with an attractive pavement of kidney stones laid in classical times. The interior lies below a vineyard and is covered by over two and a half meters of earth. Since a very rich floor deposit began with the door leading into this, it would seem that further excavation would provide very rich material which had prob- ably lain untouched. "The two buildings mentioned above are out- skirts of the great city which lies on the hill over- hanging this part of the plain -the Papoura of St. George. This city, from a superficial exploration and from an examination of chance finds made by the peasants, must have been one of the largest and most important in Crete during the archaic period. In area it is exceeded only by Knossos, Gortyna, Aptera and Polyrrhenia, while the ar- tistic standard of the terracottas is as high as any found. Unfortunately inscriptions are lacking and there is no name in literature which fits it. "The depth of earth and the fact that a trial excavation would be a leap into the blue and might extend indefinitely led to the conclusion that the archaic and classical parts of the site were better left to another time. There was, how- ever, a tholos tomb of the Geometric period which had been partially robbed by the peasants and which formed one of a group at the east end of the Papoura. This was carefully cleared and proved to be of the utmost interest. In diameter it is over two meters and the incline of the walls shows that the height was the same. Surrounding it, however, was a heavy rectangular mass of masonry, equal on every side to the diameter of the tomb and ex- tending to within about a metre of the original capstone. At first this block of masonry had stopped short on a level with the low door of the tomb itself, but it had later been extended -to make the whole roughly square - in order to form a dromos. This extension may have been at a lower level, so that the tomb appeared terraced. Previ- ous depredations had broken most of the pottery and dispersed the other objects, but enough was left-even before mending-to show that the tomb belonged to the mature Geometric period and from the evidence of polychrome sherds con- tinued in use down to the borders of the archaic period. The most important small find was a dou- ble axe of Minoan shape, but in iron. "The last days of the excavations were devoted to the high peak of Karphe, which overhangs one of the approaches to the Papoura. The sherds found on the surface had inclined us to believe that the site was Late Minoan, but excavation proved that it was only another instance of the conservatism of Lasithi, whither no doubt the old population fled. All the remains hitherto exca- vated are, as one would expect from the wild ap- pearance of the place, Protogeometric. "Two tholos tombs, one already partially cleared by Sir Arthur Evans in 1896, were ex- plored. They formed part of what seems to be a regular Appian Way, being backed by a heavy terrace wall from which other walls project to</page><page sequence="22">628 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY enclose each tomb. These tholoi are square at the base though the circular vaulting begins after two or three courses. Again the surrounding rectangu- lar mass of masonry was present and these tombs are evidently the first example of freestanding built tholoi in Greece. Both unfortunately had been thoroughly cleared out in ancient times. "Finally a building which lay on the sheer edge of the windy saddle between Karphe and the ad- joining peak of Mikra Koprana was excavated. This turned out to be a shrine, the first of its period to be discovered. It consisted mainly of a large room with an altar at the north end and ledges around the south and west sides, broken only by a rough flight of steps leading up to a cor- ridor and a further room with a similar ledge. Though the earth was under half a metre deep the rocky nature of the ground had prevented cultiva- tion and a great quantity of pottery was discov- ered which, when mended, will be found to represent most of the types of the period. Most important, however, was the discovery of the frag- ments of no less than nine cult figures in clay, of which two have been partially mended (P1. XXI). They are the direct descendants of the Minoan goddess type of L. M. III, best known from the shrine of the Double Axes at Knossos, and repre- sent a phase half way between the L. M. IIIb ex- amples from Gazi and the bronze statues from the Geometric temple at Dreros. The features are clearly and harshly marked. The head is sur- mounted by a crown, which is topped by birds and discs. Both arms are raised in the Minoan style and the tubular skirt is also Minoan.

Hard by the Great Sphinx, where all tourists to Egypt go, whether or not they are able to journey four hundred odd miles farther south to visit the temples of Thebes, and where the holiday crowds from Africa's largest city, Cairo, are wont to con- gregate, Selim Hassan extricated an imposing monument of the Eighteenth Dynasty king Amenh.otpe II, a limestone stela, twelve feet high by five wide, which had survived there, protected in a bank of mud, for over three thousand years, its existence in the frequented spot wholly un- suspected. The new stela is reported to be dated to the king's second year (ca. 1447 B.c.) and would then be the only one extant known for a certainty to be of that year, the year number being lost from his Karnak stela and only conjectured to be the second. The hieroglyphic text has not yet been communicated to scholars and is eagerly awaited. Preliminary accounts' indicate that it is in ex- cellent condition and that its twenty-seven lines in part have to do with the king's marvellous suc- cess in archery, in rowing, in foot-races, and in managing horses. When published, it will supple- ment inscriptions longer known bearing on this king's sportsmanship; one hopes, for instance, for illuminating ideograms of the "targets" of "Asi- atic copper" and even for the spelling of the word "target," should it be written out also phonetic- ally. No hint has yet been given whether the stela has historical value. One would like further to learn whether it was set up before or after the king's military campaign in Asia to quell the re- bellions incident to the demise of Th. utmose III, a campaign generally ascribed to Amenhotpe II's second year. The Egyptian University's excava- tions at Hermopolis Magna, having received notice in an earlier number of this JOURNAL, will be passed by bere.2 Reports have also been given in this JOURNAL of part of the work of the Department of Antiqui- ties at Sakkareh, that conducted by Walter B. Emery 3 and R. Macramallah.4 In addition, Jean- Philippe Lauer reopened investigations at the pyramid of Unis, of which the temple had been uncovered by Barsanti in 1900 and a plan made by Mr. Lauer in the winter of 1929 to 1930.5 And the activities of Selim Hassan included also excavations in the Sakkareh field at the tombs of Ti 6 and Ptahhotpe.7 In a quarry of Old Cairo the Department of Antiquities early in January 1937 found a late rock-hewn tomb containing a huge sarcophagus of hard limestone; although plun- dered, the sarcophagus itself was of some interest, and so were the robbers' leavings of pottery and amulets. Another late tomb was discovered there before the end of the season, one containing in its principal chamber fifteen sarcophagi of limestone and in its lateral chambers eleven others. Unfortu- nately the tomb had been thoroughly ransacked in recent times.8 In Upper Egypt, the Depart- ment was occupied as in past seasons at Karnak, 1 The Egyptian Gazette, Nov. 6 and 30, 1936; The Times (London), Nov. 7, 1936; Ill.

Baraize in the winter of 1935 to 1936, that of recondition- ing .Hatshepsfit's temple at Deir el Bahri, was continued last winter and will require several seasons to complete;4 its objective is to place again in position blocks found in recent years and generally to utilize the fruitful researches of H. E. Winlock and others at the temple. The mummies of the historic kings of Egypt were subjected to another moving in 1936. It will be recalled that under the regime of Ismail Sidky Pasha they were taken from the Egyptian Museum in Champollion Street to the Mausoleum erected for the founder of the Wafd party, Zaghlfil Pasha. After the return of the Wafd to power in the elections of May 1936, the mummies were sent back to the Museum and there consigned temporarily to the Director's house. A special building is to be erected for them, perhaps in drier Heliopolis, or even possibly in the region of the Great Pyramids as proposed by some, and financial provision has been made for it in the Budget of 1937 to 1938.5 Turning to the work of foreign expeditions and institutions in Egypt, I note that the Cairo Branch of the German Archaeological Institute excavated from the beginning of December, 1936, to the beginning of February, 1937, at its neolithic concession, Merimde, in the West Delta, the cam- paign being under the general charge of the Cairo Branch's Director, Professor Hermann Junker of the Egyptian University.6 On the neighboring Middle Kingdom site, Abu Ghalib, Swedish schol- ars excavated somewhat longer, from December 8, 1936 to March 6, 1937. Four more houses were found of the same type as the group discovered in 1934 and described in Volume VI of the Mit- teilungen des deutschen Instituts fiir dgyptische Altertumslkunde in Kairo. Three tombs, too, were discovered and many small objects, of which the most interesting are seals and impressions made with them and the neck of a glass bottle claimed to be dated unquestionably to the Middle Kingdom. The puzzling microliths (flints) charac- teristic of the site are now believed also to be of the Middle Kingdom.7 An innovation for the Belgian Fondation egyptologique Reine Elisabeth was the excava- tion which it started last season in Egypt, its concession being the important ancient city at El Kab, fifty-two miles south of Luxor. Its first short campaign was expended at the main east temple and closely joined west temple, which the Director, Jean Capart, thinks were dedicated respectively to the tutelary goddess of Upper Egypt, Nekhbet, and to ThI4t; the triad within the three sanctuaries of the east temple he believes to have been Nekhbet and forms of Thit and Horus. Inspired apparently by the enormous amount of older material recovered in the lower levels at Medamad and Tid, he looks forward to exploiting for their historical yield similar "archaeological reserves" (to use his apt term) beneath the final temple levels at El Kab. The preliminary sketch plan accompanying his article 8 offers several corrections to the late Somers Clarke's plan (Journ. Eg. Arch. VIII, 1922, P1. VI) as well as the addition of a gate just west of the first pylon of the larger temple in the central long axis of the west temple. Before this gate Mr. Capart found scanty remains of a protective lion with royal figure against its breast determining the position of its better preserved pendant which he had dis- covered earlier near the east gate of the temenos. And he also gives reasons for supposing certain walls and a granite threshold in the main temple to be vestiges still in position of the hypostyle hall of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Excavations were conducted by the University of Milan at Medinet Mad! in the Fayyfim, Achille Vogliano being in charge in 1936 to 1937 as in the preceding season.9 The University of Turin worked at Gebelkn, opening tombs of the First, the Fifth, and the Tenth Dynasties.10 The 1 Chron. d'Flg. 24, pp. 173-174. 2 Ibid., p. 174. 3 Eg.

In the excavations of last winter a notable collection of more than two hundred Greek and demotic ostraca was amassed, estab- lishing the existence of a family of Jews in one quarter of the town and revealing their fortunes as to taxation and other matters both of local and general interest through a number of generations. The beauty and palaeographical interest of the ostraca also are extolled by Bernard Bruy're," Co-Director of the dig. The joint expedition of the Louvre, Paris, and the French Institute of Cairo continued its ex- cavations at Tfid, ancient Tuphium, in 1936 to 1937 under the direction of F. Bisson de la Roque as in previous seasons. The results were less excit- ing than in the preceding season, but nevertheless valuable, the sacred pool constructed at the open- ing of the Christian era being investigated. The pool was found to have been fed by infiltra- tion from the Nile and to have had two levels with their own quais, one for the dry season and one for the time of high Nile, there being a difference of 6.65 m. between them and connecting stairways having landing places. From the upper courses were recovered blocks of sandstone bearing evi- dence that they came from a building decorated by Amen lhotpe II and Merenptah and dedicated to Sebekre(; this is thought to have been situated across the river in the region of Gebelin. A poorly built stairway serving as a Nilometer was ex- cavated at one side of the temple and from its upper end were taken fragments of statues of some interest.4 Quite as important a news item as fresh discoveries is that of an investigation con- summated in a fine publication such as T6d (1934 a 1936) by F. B. R., issued this past season as Volume XVII in the series "Fouilles de l'Institut fran:ais du Caire, sous la direction de M. P. Jouguet." A few illustrations of objects from the cache of Amenhotpe II, the finding of which was a sensation of 1935 to 1936, were given after nega- tives of the French Institute a year ago in this JOURNAL. Now that the highly important early reliefs from Tuphium have been published by their finder, I repeat here typical pieces, in Figure 1 part of a pillar of red hornblende granite bearing the name of Userkaf,5 first king of the Fifth Dynasty, in Figures 2 and 3 sunken reliefs of the Eleventh Dynasty king Samtowy Nebhepetri( Mentu- Ihotpe,6 and in Figure 4, p. 635 a sample of the work done under S(ankhkari( Mentulhotpe, last, or next to the last, king of the dynasty.7 Mr. de la Roque believes that temples were erected on this site under Userkaf and under the two kings of the Eleventh Dynasty whose blocks he found reused. To support this view, he assumes that Sesostris I, also a builder on the site, laid his foundation at a lower level, thus obliterating traces of the earlier structures, since he himself found no traces of them and holds it to be improbable that Sesostris I would have made his temple duplicate precisely the ground plan of an earlier one. Mr. de la Roque may well be right, although one must not lose sight of the possibility that, like the Eighteenth Dynasty pieces reused at the lake (see above) and like a stela of Amenhotpe II transported in an- tiquity for reuse from Elephantine to Armant,8 the pre-Twelfth Dynasty blocks here might have come originally from a distance. The question of how often and how far in ancient Egypt used material was moved for reutilization is continually cropping up, as at Lisht, North Pyramid, where many blocks, clearly of varying dates, may possi- bly all have come from a single nearby ruined 1 Chron. d'Eg. 24, p. 180. 2 That of Apr.-June, 1937, p. 317, citing Ill.

These new reliefs of the Eleventh Dynasty -in all twenty-eight in tolerable preservation, as well as numerous lesser fragments-are more important for stylistic than political history. But for the latter, the relief of Figure 3 yields the valu- able information that there were three Intefs thought by one of their near followers to be en- titled to the cartouche of kingship. Another block which almost certainly fits above this one gives the Horus names of the two last, Wah(ankh and Sehertowy, the third Horus name, meaning "Quieting the Two Lands," being appropriate to a king who must have had much to do with bringing the Northerners finally under subjugation to the Theban family which composed the Eleventh Dynasty. Incidentally it should be recalled that "Quieting the Two Lands," of which this is the earliest known instance in a king's titulary, was borne as Horus-of-Gold name by a later liberator, Kamase of the Seventeenth Dynasty. The dis- parity in size between the three Intefs and the two deities and officiating king, surely Samtowy, of Figure 3 is paralleled in another block found at Tfid I and in a rock relief at Shatt es Rigaleh.2 In the rock relief a King Intef faces the larger-scale figure of King Samtowy Nebhepetr,( Mentuhotpe, his attitude being one of respect, but not neces- sarily of adoration, as some will have it. Mr. Winlock explained him as a Crown Prince-Co- regent of this Mentuhotpe, who died before he could reign alone.3 Mr. de la Roque, however, accounts for the lesser relative size of the Intefs as indicating that they were kings over a part of Egypt, not over a united North and South (see p. 77 of his book). A commendable feature of the book is its careful analysis of the style of the two groups of Eleventh Dynasty reliefs. The earlier (Figs. 2 and 3) shows the arms disproportionately long, crowns disproportionately tall, the hiero- glyphs unduly large in relation to human figures and often badly set; in the relief of Figure 2, arms which it embarrassed the artist to draw are partially eliminated, and the vulture headdress is awkwardly done, as if it were mostly inside the crown with head and tail sticking out through holes in the latter; but very great merits of this art are its sobriety and vigor. In the style of S(ankhkari (-all too insufficiently illustrated in Figure 4-awkwardness has almost disappeared, the scale of the hieroglyphs is less overwhelming for human figures, the proportions of these figures are more nearly correct, the garments and head- dresses are much patterned, elegance having taken the place of extreme sobriety. For Mr. de la Roque these are two stages in the formation of a style, the beauty of which culminated in the opening reigns of the Twelfth Dynasty. For my part, I am inclined to consider as the apex the work done under S(ankhkare( at Tfid and elsewhere; in com- parison with it, I find, for instance, the decoration of Sesostris I's chapel of limestone now being reassembled in the "Musec" at Karnak over- elaborate and fairly recherche in its departure from nature when depicting the details of dress and the objects represented in the signs of the writing. Mr. de la Roque's admirable and lucid book covers the entire occupancy of this temple- site down through the time of the Copts, but two special monographs are yet to be issued, one by an Assyriologist on the foreign treasure of Amenhotpe II's cache and another by G. Posener and Mrs. Vandier on the reliefs of Sesostris I found enclosed within the rear wall of the Ptolemaic pronaos. An enterprise at Thebes undertaken solely by the French Institute of Cairo is that of investi- gating certain of the funerary temples along the border of the cultivation and desert on the west bank. The scene of the excavations carried out by Alexandre Varille and Clement Robichon since December 1934 is just to the northeast of the great complex of Ramesses III at Medinet Habu and beyond the funerary temple of Eye and I-Iarem1hab, dug previously by the Oriental Insti- tute of the University of Chicago. To the four temples discovered in 1935, a fifth to the north of them has been added this past season and will have to be excavated further next year; it was found to have belonged to the Twentieth Dynasty king Ramesses IV, who lived in the second quarter of the twelfth century B.c. Other chronological results of this last campaign are the ascription of the enclosure wall of the enlarged temenos of the Amenhotpe temple found by them to the Twenty- first Dynasty and the fixing of limits for the date of the northernmost of their four temples first discovered as not later than the time of Ramesses IV or earlier than the close of the reign of Amen- ' F.

The clearing of the pool in the temple of King Amenlhotpe III's great statesman of like name (Figs. 5-7) was also a task of the past season. Like the one at TMid, it was found to de- crease in area downward, terminating in a well of great depth which gave access to infiltrated Nile water; its construction must have been fraught with difficulty because below two meters of rock were strata of gravels; quite at the bottom were found bones of a common Nile fish, Synodontis schall, indicating that the pool was stocked in antiquity; the excavations of 1936 to 1937 re- vealed also, to the north of the pool, a stairway which descended steeply and making a turn opened into the pool; this has been added on the plan of Figure 7; and evidence of drastic altera- tions, probably contemporaneous with the en- largement of the temenos, was found, and the tree-holes around the pool were examined, loam and the remains of sycamore trees being found in them. Of the objects turned up in the course of the season, a head of painted pottery, thought by the finders to date from the time of Amen1hotpe III and to be derived from a statuette of Osiris or Ptah, is given in P1. XXIIA. But more fascinat- ing to me is the probable identification of the Ipuky pictured and mentioned in a pleasing frag- ment of bas-relief with one of the sculptors of tomb 181 of which the delightful paintings were published in 19~5 by the Metropolitan Museum of Art.1 This relief may give us the sculptural style of Ipuky; at least it presumably indicates that he was engaged in the decoration of the temple of Amenlhotpe, son of IHapu.2 The work so brilliantly carried out among the scanty and confusing re- mains of four temples is well set forth in another handsome publication of the French Institute of Cairo, printed in Cairo at its own press, and pub- lished in the late autumn of 1936 as No. XI in the same series in which appeared the book on ancient Tuphium briefly reviewed above. This Volume I of a work entitled Le Temple du scribe royal Amenhotep, fils de Hapou and written by C. Robichon and A. Varille has forty-eight excellent plates, many of them double or folding and two colored; its text, although adequate, is kept down to forty-eight pages, the more remarkable since the opening chapters are devoted, not to the ex- cavations, but to passages in papyri and an in- scribed stela bearing on the temple and known long before these authors identified its site. Especially welcome is the fine Plate I reproducing photographically Stela No. 138 in the British Museum with its nineteen lines of carved hieratic. Of it, Mr. Varille gives a transcription into hiero- glyphs and a translation with intelligent com- ments on a few passages, in particular a difficult one in lines 3-4, thereby correcting, and adding not a little to, the results obtained by previous students of the text. Volume II of the work will discuss the inscriptions and catalogue the objects found on the site. Still another French expedition is that of the University of Strassbourg working under Pierre Montet at Tanis. The past season's excavations were conducted at two places, around the first pylon of the "Great Temple" and in the region of the temple of the foreign war goddess (Anat. The first produced valuable stelae and statue-frag- ments of the Saite period, which in part add to the data about a personage already known and prove that even though the capital at the time was in the West Delta, this eastern border town was not neglected; the second presented enigmas of con- struction, being as yet chiefly productive of reused material which includes some blocks going back as far as the Old Kingdom.3 British work under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Society was conducted in 1936 to 1937 at three sites in the Nile Valley. At (Amarneh John Pendlebury completed the excavation of the Great Palace, finding at its northern end servants' quarters built after the manner of the Workmen's Village, although more carefully. Reliefs, including one of the transport of an obelisk, models, sketches, fragments of scenes representing the royal family, parts of a painted ceiling of ducks and butterflies, charming bits of painting on papyrus, a complete Mycenaean vase, a Cypriote vase with some of its one-time contents preserved, were recovered in the palace and other buildings of the center of the city, now entirely exposed, enabling one to consult the plan of this capital of the ancient world.4 SNorman de Garis Davies, The Tomb of Two Sculptors at Thebes. 2 A.J.A., Jan.-Mar. 1937, p. 120, condensed from Ill.

Myers, included a number of investigations - at the main temple, at a platform of crude bricks bearing cartouches of Amenhotpe III, but de- nuded of its superstructure, at a Coptic hermitage, at a cemetery of "pan-graves," where new light was shed on the purpose of painted skulls buried around the individual tombs, their horns emerging from the earth, at various spots occupied briefly by Bedouins of the Predynastic and Early Dynastic periods, and on the Armant-Nag( HIam- madi trail, where Thirteenth Dynasty inscrip- tions were found, yielding the names of a queen and princesses not hitherto known. Of all this prolific work, the baring of the Ptolemaic temple's pavement of reused blocks, four deep and compris- ing in area some two thousand square meters, fires the imagination the most. The decorated blocks, of which a fine example is given in P1. XXIIB, range in date from the Eleventh to the Twenty- sixth Dynasty and are stated to be in brilliant con- dition, many of them with colors as fresh as when first laid on. One may hope for an artistic and his- torical harvest of high importance, when once they have been taken out, sorted, and studied, but the task is being delayed by the necessity of moving a cemetery overlying about half of the temple. Concurrently with all the foregoing, an expedition to the High Desert, led by H. Winkler, explored wadis of the Kuser road and of routes to the north and east of Luxor and Armant. Over a thousand rock drawings ranging from Palaeolithic to Arab times and several new Horus names of early kings were found and photographed.' An exhibition of the season's results was held in London from September 1 to 25, 1937. Like a continuation of its (Amarneh project are the new excavations of the Society up the Valley in a wild spot of the Anglo-Egyptian Sfidin somewhat north of the Third Nile Cataract. There, at Sesebi, the connection of which with Akhenaten was a discovery long ago in 1907 of the late Dr. Breasted, A. M. Blackman has made notable discoveries, not only at the site of the three temples founded by Akhenaten -as founda- tion deposits reached this last season testify -but also in the town and cemetery. The temples were begun before the king's fourth year, when he still styled himself Amenhotpe, and were decorated in part in the first (Amarneh period before the change in the form of the Aten's name in the ninth year; thus the king's early style, in no way erratic, and that of his first (Amarneh period have been found here far to the south; so also have many fragments of Mycenaean vases in houses. The middle temple had a small crypt decorated before the fourth year and showing the king in the company of various deities; it is unique today, except for one of Ptolemaic date at Dendereh. The most striking relief depicts life-size heads of prostrate negro enemies and parts of their bodies and bows from what must have been one of the earliest of battle scenes to a large scale on the wall of a temple, though the subject is familiar on chariots and a chest of the Eighteenth Dynasty. Other objects found witness to some occupancy of the site before and after the time of Akhenaten. An estimated half-season's work remains to be done here next year, after which Dr. Blackman hopes to dig at S6leb, thirty miles distant, which is noted for its Sed-festival scenes.2 The Egypt Exploration Society and the Ori- ental Institute of the University of Chicago con- ducted what will probably be their last season of joint work in the temple of Sety I at Abydos, Miss Calverley in charge. Volume III of their great publication will appear, it is hoped, before the close of 1937, and Volume IV is so far under way that it can be finished in England. Surely funds ought to be procurable for a future Volume V to make complete the record of the temple's scenes and inscriptions.3 Mrs. Guy Brunton, whose artistic gifts and training have in recent years been devoted in part to ancient Egypt, also in 1936 to 1937 made further delightful facsimiles executed in water colors on ivory of Tut(ankhamfin ornaments and copied two daggers of the king together with their sheaths; also she again sought to render vivid in the language of modern painted portraiture the appearance, as known from ancient sources, of royal personages of the past -this time King Djoser Neterkhet, King Teti's queen, and, from the Classical age, the renowned Cleopatra.

And the Oriental Institute of Chicago went forward on a curtailed basis having given up among other things its Memphis House. To its work in collaboration with the Egypt Exploration Society I have referred above. From Dr. Nelson 2 I hear that Medinet Habu, Vol. IV, went to press in the summer of 1937, that it "will contain the material from the great feast scenes in the second court . . . and certain parallel material from the other Theban temples, especially that bearing on the feast of Min . . . This will make a volume of about 492 plates, many of them double, and about nine in color. . . . I figure that I can publish the re- mainder of the temple in a single volume by printing on both sides of the page and using a smaller format. There will be some 250 plates in that volume." For the next season emphasis on the Institute's activity at Karnak, especially in the temple of Khonsu, is contemplated: "The Karnak job seems to me the more important now that we have published the greater part of the Ramses III temple at Medinet Habu. Of course we shall continue with the latter temple, but the buildings on this side of the river are going rapidly and we must get on with this work." 3 At the Camp of Harvard University and the Boston Museum of Fine Arts, to the west of the Great Pyramids, under George A. Reisner, the entire staff was engaged last winter principally with publications and only secondarily with ex- cavations, and there work went on at an acceler- ated pace. Two volumes of a definitive work by Dr. Reisner, The History of the Giza Necropolis, are ready and the first will go to press in the autumn of 1937. Volume I includes eight chapters, four appendices, seventy-one plates, some three hundred line drawings in the text and several maps. It covers "the historical relations of the Giza necropolis; the basis of the chronology; the fields of tombs; the six nucleus cemeteries of mastabas; and separate chapters on the types of mastabas, types of burial chambers, and types of funerary chapels. This volume will also contain appendices giving detailed descriptions of the mastabas of the early nucleus cemeteries."4 Next will be published chapters IX-XVI giving the service equipment of the chapels, the funerary furniture of the burial chambers, the chronology of the finished mastabas and rock-cut tombs, the history of certain great Gizeh families, and the history of the royal family of the Fourth Dynasty. Descriptions of the mastabas of the Fifth and Sixth Dynasties will follow those of the Fourth, and a volume has been prepared by W. S. Smith on the development of Egyptian Sculpture, mainly down to the end of the Old Kingdom. Chapter XII is concerned with the development of pottery during the Fourth to Sixth Dynasties at Gizeh for which, in addition to much other mate- rial, Dr. Reisner had available a corpus of recon- structed vessels from the tomb of Queen .Hetep- .ieres, mother of Khufu, the result of seven years of patient fitting together. "While this publication has been going on a small gang (7-15 men) has been employed on making minor clearing to eluci- date questions arising in the description of the separate mastabas. On the edges of certain ex- cavated areas, we have cleared small ruined mas- tabas and cleared up the chronological connection of these mastabas with those of the excavated field. In the course of minor clearing we have found a number of statuettes, three new reserve heads and a number of other objects . . . some of the objects are now in the Cairo Museum and the rest in Boston." 5 An exhibition of the sea- son's production of paintings by Joseph Lindon Smith, including much from the tomb of Ptaih- hotpe at Sakkareh, was held at the Camp just before his sailing this past Spring, as in many earlier years; this always enjoyable event was given further interest this year by the presence of the President of the Museum of Fine Arts, Ed- ward J. Holmes and Mrs. Holmes. From the Harvard-Boston Camp also emanated a moving and comprehensive tribute by Dr. Reisner 6 to the person and accomplishment of the great master in Egyptology, Adolf Erman, who died on June 26, 1937, leaving us all bereft.
