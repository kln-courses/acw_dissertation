<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mythology of Nut and the Birth of Ra von R. A. Wells An analysis of star patterns for the Old Kingdom and earlier suggests that the origin of the legend concerning the sky goddess Nut and the course of the sun steins from early inhabitants of the Nile Valley or Delta. By observing the stars, these people created ameans of measuring time which led to the development of a calendar. At the same time, such nightly observations led to stories which later formed the pantheon of myths connected with gods and goddesses who were worshipped for thousands of years. This paper indicates that Nut originated as an anthropomorphic form of the Milky Way and that a particular position of this group of stars in the pre-dawn sky on the morning of the winter solstice gave rise to the legend of the birth of the sun de picted in many monument scenes. Other aspects of Nut are also discussed. 1. Introduction There are numerous allusions to astronomy in the lore of ancient Egypt which survive in the monuments and documents handed down to us from Dynastic times. The sun was worshipped as a creator deity and the moon as the regulator of Time and Truth. The star Sirius regulated the later forms of the calendars and was identified with various goddesses, among them Isis, Hathor, and Satet. Isis, the consort of Osiris, and Satet, the consort of Khnum of Elephantine, were heavenly reflections of the accompaniment of the constellation Orion by the smaller attendant Canis Major, of which Sirius was the prominent star. At death, it was the aspiration of every pharaoh to become one with the ihmw-sk, the inde structible polar stars. Almost every aspect of daily life (and death) in ancient Egypt had some connection with astronomy. For anyone who has</page><page sequence="2">306 R. A. W e 1 1 s SAK 19 / \* / \ \ **ig. !

I would like to add to this collection by drawing attention to certain astronomical relationships that are so consistent with the mythology surrounding the goddess Nut that equating the former as the progenitor of the latter seems beyond doubt. Rather than presenting a complete concordance of all the scenes and source phrases connected with Nut, however, in the interests ofbrevity I merely wish to select the basic elements of the standard scene1 as 1 Many scenes are available.

I shall depart from the diurnal aspects of this interpretation and proceed from the simplest explanation of the scene, that of a mother giving birth,a process which lasts longer than a day. In fact, the Nut 2 The translation of the text lines and author commentary from P. Carlsberg 1 sup plemented by those from the Seti I and Ramesses IV scenes given in EAT, I, pp. 36 94, provide a direct source of these events from at least the New Kingdom.

Most of the Egyptological literature treats Nut as an entity separate from any anthropomorphic stellar representation although at least one ascribes Nut to an area of the northern sky5. There is, however, one particular astronomical representation which, if clearly seen under proper dark conditions, obviously strikes one by its human-like, even female, form. That is the Milky Way, the outer arm of our galaxy, which can only be seen in the darkest conditions of a moonless night. This band of myriads of stars has a ghost-like, whitish appearance highly 3 E.

The tomb ceiling shows Nut in the form of Siamese twins joined back to-back. They stretch lengthwise along the middle of the ceiling with their bodies arching in opposite directions along the vaulted narrow dimension. Six suns are spaced along each torso for a total of 12. Adjacent scenes are related to tables of stars marking the hours of the night in the Ramesside star clocks for the whole year. Twelve such tables for 6months of the year are positioned on the south side of the twinned Nut, and another 12 for the remaining 6 months are located on the north side. A similar Siamese twinning with 12 solar disks was omitted in Fig. 1. ** The connection of Ra with the year is treated more fully in my forthcoming "Ra and the Calendars" inRevolutions in Time: Studies in Egyptian Calendrios (1993),A. J. Spalinger, ed.; but it is alluded to at some length below. 5 V. Davis, Arohaeoastronomy, no. P, Journal for the History of Astronomy 16 (1985) S102-S104. The article has the merit of correctly interpreting the seasonal gyra tions of the Milky Way as highly suggestive of the Egyptian word mr-nh3y usually translated as 'Winding Waterway'. However, the suggestion that the Milky Way di vides the "northern" sky from the "southern" and that Nut is consequently to be identified as the whole sky north of the Milky Way carries much less force. She cites as evidence for such an interpretation the scribal lines in EAT I, p. 43, A.I, 1-3: "This is the picture on the papyrus. The female figure of this position that is to say, her head is in the west and her hind part in the east? is the goddess, is the northern sky". Since the scribe was rather definite in describing the position of the female figure with specific body parts, I would interpret the phrase "... is the northern sky" to mean "dominates the northern sky" which, of course, is just what the Milky Way itself does. For a lengthy discussion of mr-nh3 and variants in the Pyramid Texts and in later readings of the Middle and New Kingdoms and the relationship between the 'Lake of Flames', the'Lake of Knives1, the'Winding Waterway1 and the course of the sun god after his birth, see Altenmiiller, ZAS 92(1966)86-95. For further examples of the reading of the hieroglyphs for this word and variants thereof and its relationship to the course of the sun in the heavens, also see the dissertation of Ulrich Luft, "Beitrage zur Historisierung der Gotterwelt und der Mythenschreibung", in: Studia Aegyptiaoa IV, no. 22, pp. 34-37, Budapest (1978).

Star Charts In interpreting the ancient legend in the standard scene, I have used star positions andmaps computed for 3500 B.C. by aplanetarium computer program7 inwhich positions of selected stars were checked for accuracy with the writer's independent algorithms already used in an earlier study8 connectedwith the 5th Dynasty sun temples at Abu Ghurab. After computations, thebasic star maps were supplemented with the outline of 6 D. H. Menzel and J.

Subsequent topocentric figures in this paper show the horizons for the latitude and longitude of Cairo (30?N, 30?E in round numbers). The essential elements of Nut as the Milky Way depicted in Fig. 2 are the already mentioned bifurcation at Cygnus and thickening in the head area near Gemini. It should be noted here that the bifurcation of the Milky Way at Cygnus is not without significance. Cygnus, the swan, is also sometimes called the 'Northern Cross' because of its obvious ap pearance. Figurines of primitive societies in clay or other materials which represent the female form have been found which denote the gen italia by a cross inscribed in the appropriate position between the legs9. A further element that is apparent in Fig. 2 is that a number of pro minent constellations occur along the Milky Way in addition to those just mentioned, e.g., Auriga, Perseus, Cassiopeia, Cepheus, Lyra, Sag gitarius, and Scorpius to name some of them. These constellations are composed of bright stars distinctive to their patterns, one or more of which are considerably brighter than the others in each. It so happens that these very bright stars are located within or near the confines of the Milky Way (Fig. 2). In a number of instances, these bright stars are even more enhanced because, although within the banded boundary of the Milky Way, they are located inareas devoid of Milky Way whiteness, i.e., within bays or inlets where there are no background stars. The net effect of this distribution is that the Milky Way appears as a whitish, diaphanous figure bespeckled with brighter stars10, a logical explanation of the source of the Egyptian art form in the representation of Nut with stars depicted along her body. 3. The Birth of Ra - The Winter Solstice Having determined that the Milky Way provides an excellent source for the Egyptian representation of the sky goddess Nut, it remains to be seen whether any other astronomical events are also contained within the 9 E.g., Fig. 60 (Ilios, 226), p. 67 in C Schuchhardt, Schliemannrs Excavations (London, 1891, orig. ed.), Benjamin Blom, New York (1971), illustrates a typical example although this particular one is in lead, not terra cotta. 10 Please note that the shaded area in the diagrams denoting the Milky Way is de limited by discrete lines. In reality, of course, the Milky Way edges grade off gradually like wisps in a much more diaphanous manner than canbe illustrated here.</page><page sequence="7">1992 The Mythology of Nut and the Birth of Ra 311 initial elements of the legend connected with the birth of Ra that can also explain the Egyptian art form. The birth of Ra, or mswt R?9 is clearly meant to be understood as sun rise. As noted in ?1, many scenes show the sun coursing through the body of Nut as the underworld, emerging from herbirth canal atsunrise, flying along the heavens during the day to re-enter Nut and the under world through her mouth at sunset. Astronomically, there is no rela tionship between the sun, thesun's path inthe ecliptic, and the Milky Way that could give rise to this diurnal picture. If there is a re lationship with the sun passing near (or through) the Milky Way, then it must be a seasonal (i.e., yearly) rather than a daily event. A first step in the search is to ask the question: "is there a particular in cident, recurrent on ayearly basis, which combines the sun,the eclip tic, the Milky Way, and position on the horizon?". A helpful indication is afforded us in Neugebauer and Parker's11 dis cussion of the cosmology of Seti I and Ramesses IV, in particular the text lines B.I,16-17 which describe the direction of the rising sun: "It is in the southeastern side behind Punt that this god exists. It is in the southeastern place of the falcon behind Punt that the god exists, that is to say, the falcon which is on the picture. It is said: It is Re who is established there". This direction is not too specific; however, from Egypt Punt probably lay as far to the south on the eastern horizon as the sun can reach, i.e., the winter solstice. The comments (p. 38) of Neugebauer and Parker before presenting this translation imply the same: "The sun originates orrises in far distant regions inthe Southeast, the country of Punt. Perhaps this is the direction from which the sun is supposed to rise when it is farthest away from Egypt at the time of the winter solstice. It is difficult to say whether these two introductory chapters are concerned with the primeval origin of the sun or with its daily rising". It is clear from what is presented below that at least in this part of the text, the scribe is referring to the primeval origin of the sun? the direction of which appears to be marked by the winter solstice. Else where4, it was indicated that the origin of the 365-day interval against 11 EAT, I, p. 45.</page><page sequence="8">312 R. A. W e 1 1 s SAK 19 N E S i'Sun Fig. 3.

Monitoring the movements of the sun god must have been one of the earliest of Predynastic observations in the Nile Valley; and it would have been natural to interpret the sun's yearly motion along the eastern horizon from the southernmost point at the winter solstice to the northernmost point at the summer solstice and back as journeys or visitations of the god to each of the two kingdoms? the due East point forming at least the heavenly boundary between them. The determination of the number of days in the interval as 365 did not pose any difficulty to a primitive society12 . 12 A likely method of counting the days accurately is described in the article of footnote (4).</page><page sequence="9">1992 The Mythology of Nut and the Birth of Ra 313 A/.V;' ..I-,-*- \ V Jmm/ A"?ff: &gt;\^fcX,/ ?&lt;\ t. fi Yi I Fig. 4. The same appearance (cf. Fig. 3) ca. 2 hours later at sunrise (7:05 a.m.). Although stars are no longer visible, note that aline drawn from the north celestial pole (ncp) through the star Deneb (a Cyg) and intersecting the horizon at the sunrise point will form agreat circle. The same relationship will not hold for dates earlier or later than this date and time because the horizon position of the sun moves. With the winter solstice seeming apparently important to the early Egyptians, itwould be expected that the first lunar calendar would have used this date to begin their year. Indeed, as has been noted4, the derivation of the civil month name 'Mesore', which comes from mswt Rc, and its position as the last month inthe year probably owes its origin to this early lunar calendar. Since the lunar calendar year would begin only after the winter solstice,as subsequently when the Sothic Rising later came to mark the beginning of the year it similarly began after prt Spdt, then the last position of Mesore isperfectly understandable. The feast of the winter solstice celebrating thebirth of Ra would have to have occurred in the last month of the lunar calendar, which would have taken its name mswt R? eponymously as the name of the month13. 13 A more complete discussion of problems encountered with theorder of Egyptian month names is given in the footnote (4) reference. However, given the significance of the birth of Ra, the development of the calendar would result in the last month being named after the most important feast in it. The description in text deals with the original Predynastic state of affairs, not to be confused with any later developments.</page><page sequence="10">314 R. A. W e 1 1 s SAK 19 The star charts alluded to in ?2were used to study the movements of the sun and the Milky Way when the former was near the winter solstice. It was apparent that on the day of the winter solstice in the early morning around 5:00 a.m., roughly 2 hours before sunrise at about 7:05 a.m., the Milky Way, or the part representing Nut from the waist to the feet was visible, stretched along the eastern horizon from the NE clockwise towards the south (Fig. 3). The legs were spread apart with one above the other. The birth canal area of the Milky Way defined by the con stellation Cygnus, orperhaps the last star in the cross, Deneb (aCyg), was also prominent, this star having attained sufficient altitude (ca. 8?) tobe clearly seen above the dust layers that would be close to the horizon. Earlier in the evening, the whole figure starting with the feet had been rising off the horizon as the sky rotated towards dawn. By the time illustrated in Fig. 4, the feet area (near the constellation of Ophi ucus) is close to the local meridian and very near the zenith, i.e. directly overhead (right ascension and declination grid lines are 15? apart). The Milky Way disappears, of course, in the twilight and ap proaching dawn14. But when the sun appears on the horizon at the sol stice point, it does so at a position where aline drawn from the north celestial pole through Deneb and intersecting the rising sun forms a great circle (Fig. 4; ncp ? a Cyg ? sun's center). It is somewhat difficult to illustrate the significance of the corre lation because rise times are also important. Earlier inDecember prior to the morning of the winter solstice (in the Julian calendar, the winter solstice occurs on January 16 at this date), the Milky Way has not risensufficiently for the Cygnus area tobe visible before sunrise. Only for about two weeks prior to the solstice will that part of the llf The sun has a depression of -18? below the horizon when astronomical twilight ends (or begins). For larger depressions, thereis no scattered sunlight at all in the sky. For smaller depressions, scattered sunlight increases. A depression of -12? marks the end (start) of nautical twilight. Between these two values, the sky begins to lighten and the brighter stars will still bevisible although the fainter band of the Milky Way will disappear towards the smaller value. A depression of -6? marks the end (beginning) of civil twilight; between -12? and -6? the sky is noticeably blue, and only the very brightest stars will remain visible. At 5:00 a.m. on the winter solstice in 3500 B.C., the solar depression at Cairo was -26?. By 5:30 a.m., it had diminished to -19? and by 6:00 a.m. to -13?. The Milky Way would have disappeared or almost disappeared by about 5:45 a.m. although Cygnus, itself, would still be visible for perhaps another quarter hour. Not long after 6:00 a.m., most stars would have been extinguished.</page><page sequence="11">1992 The Mythology of Nut and the Birth of Ra 315 Milky Way become apparent. It has completely risen just above the horizon by 5:00 a.m. only about a week before the solstice, however. For these dates, a line drawn from the north celestial pole through Deneb to the horizon at sunrise will not form a great circle because the sunrise position has not moved far enough southwards. The great circle relationship is valid only on the morning of the winter solstice. A few days after the winter solstice, Cygnus will rise too near sunrise tobe seen atall. Moreover, at these later times the sun will have begun its northward journey moving the sunrise point out of position again. Whether this great circle relationship is a critical aspect of the winter solstice' sunrise is, of course, moot. But the fact that one cannot see Deneb or Cygnus in the appropriate spot at the moment of the appearance of the sun is highly reminiscent of another astronomical event reported in connection with the Satet crown from a gate scene on the island of Bigeh15. The crown shows a scorpion pushing the solar disk with inscribed star ahead of itself with its claws. At the time of the construction of the Ptolemaic gate, the path of the sun passed through the constellation of Scorpius in the direction towards the claws. But, of course, the path through Scorpius itself can only be deduced by watching the patterns of stars just before sunrise and just after sunset for several weeks on either side of the constellation. In any event, the fact that Cygnus and this part of the Milky Way are visible close to sunrise inthe early morning for only about anhour or so14 for a few days prior to the winter solstice is quite remarkable. If the great circle relationship is accepted as an event determinable by the ancient Egyptians, then its significance may lie inthe fact that it would mark the straightline pathway from that point about which the ihmw-sk rotate that would be followed by Nut's offspring from her womb (Deneb) in a manner similar to the hieroglyph (Gardiner's B3): Aft to its birth on the horizon. 4.

The appearance of the western horizon at Cairo at 6:00 p.m. at sunset on the Vernal Equinox (Apr. 19, 3500 B.C., jul.). Although the stars cannot be seen at this time, the head of Nut defined by Gemini (left twin at the eye socket; right twin at the mouth), her arms outstretched to the left (i.e., south), and her waist and legs below thehorizon to the right indicate the critical positioning of the Milky Way when it becomes visible after the sky has darkened, (cf. also Fig. 6). servational source for the ingestion of the sun now needs to be found. The significance of the winter solstice point as the birthplace of the sun suggests the possibility of the summer solstice as the other source, which would complete the picture by symmetry. In fact, no correlations whatsoever between the head of the Milky Way at Gemini and the passing of the sun near this point were found. Ingestion of the sun, of course, implies sunset as the horizon point. But nothing specific was found by examining the sky patterns after sunset on the summer solstice. Needless to say, other horizon positions were examined for possible correlations. The surprising result turned out to be that only after sunset on the spring equinox was the appropriate relationship found. About an hour and 15 minutes after sunset, the head of Nut near Gemini lies due West face upwards on the horizon, Figs. 5,6. It would have therefore been quite natural for the early Egyptians to interpret the spring equinox sunset as the time when the sun enters Nut through her mouth.</page><page sequence="13">1992 The Mythology of Nut and the Birth of Ra 317 S X W ''' \ N Son .'.V Fig. 6. The same appearance at 7:15 p.m. when the sky is dark enough (solar dep. = -16?) forthe Milky Way tobe seen. Gemini is just touching the horizon while part of the head of Nut has already dropped below it. Fig. 5 shows the appearance of the Milky Way at sunset. In the after noon, thebody of Nut from the waist upwards to the head and arms moves toward the due West point of the horizon. As the figure gets closer, most of the body drops below the western horizon. It is not until the sky would be dark enough after sunset for the Milky Way tobe seen that only the head and arms are left remaining above the horizon with the head at the point where the sun had set, Fig. 6. The correlation is much more direct than that forthe winter solstice, of course, because the ecliptic, or path of the sun, passes directly through the Gemini area of the head near what one would consider the mouth of the goddess, Fig. 2. As can be seen in Fig. 5, however, the sun has already passed through the Milky Way by the time of the spring equinox. Obviously, during the transit across the Gemini area of the Milky Way, the latter cannot be seen. But by the time of the equinox, this part of the Milky Way can be seen shortly after sunset as illus trated here.</page><page sequence="14">318 R. A. W e 1 1 s SAK 19 Although the head lies on the horizon with mouth gaping open, that part of the Milky Way defined by the foot stars of the right twin in Fig. 6, which are closest to the mouth area, are not setting due West at this epoch. They do set due West atan earlier epoch, however, i.e., earlier than 3500 B.C. This observation is perhaps a line of future investi gation for more precisely dating the time of origin of the legend of Nut. But before that can be done, a more precise mapping of the Milky Way as a shrouded figure would be needed to define the position of the cup-shaped mouth area more accurately. Even though both the birth and eating aspects of Ra in the Nut myth appeared to be quite evident in these correlations, it seemed rather curious that the latter relationship had occurred at the spring equinox. Nevertheless, these associations are strikingly reinforced by counting the number of days between the spring equinox and the winter solstice at this epoch. A value of 272 days is obtained. This interval is iden tical to the 9 month period of human gestation. Hence, it can be argued that several natural events have all conspired to produce the myth of Nut in its earliest form. 5. Discussion and Summary Scenes depicting the goddess Nut usually show her outstretched, naked body bespeckled with stars with her feet poised onone horizon and her hands on the opposite one. The sun god Ra is shown entering her mouth, passing through her body, and exiting through her birth canal. There are other accompaniments to this picture which vary from scene to scene, but which have been ignored in this discussion because they are either ancillary or else later additions of lesser significance. The sun disk near her mouth has usually been interpreted as an indication of sunset, the passing through her body as the nightly passage of Ra through the Duat, and the exit from the birth canal as the daily rising of the sun. While indeed such an interpretation may be drawn from this scene, es pecially in later Dynastic times, it is not a satisfactory or complete explanation of what may have given rise to the original art form. Generally, I have found that when seeking astronomical explanations for Egyptian beliefs one should keep associations, correlations, or rela tionships simple and direct. There is little need to impose highly ab stract conditions, which only exist in the modern mind, ona primitive society. That being the case, direct answers to the following three</page><page sequence="15">1992 The Mythology of Nut and the Birth of Ra 319 questions were sought: (1) was there in Predynastic times an astronomical phenomenon that could have given rise to the sky goddess Nut in female anthro pomorphic form complete with stars scattered along her body? (2) at the same time, was there a particular relationship between this phenomenon and the sun which could account for the birth of the latter and when did this event occur? (3) for the same period, was there another relationship between the two which could have been the direct basis for the entering of the sun into the mouth of Nut? Easily observable answers have been given to all three questions. The female figure is the Milky Way with legs formed by the bifurcation at the constellation of Cygnus and the head formed by a bulging of the star clouds in the vicinity of Gemini. Cygnus is visible as a cross, which is also a means of denoting the female genitalia on primitive figu rines. The stars along the body of Nut were the brighter stars in the constellations arranged along the Milky Way. A study of Predynastic star patterns indicated that the constellation of Cygnus was visible in the morning sky for only a few days prior to the winter solstice shortly before sunrise. Since the anthropomorphic form would have had the appearance of a female lying on her back with legs apart, one higher than the other, it would have been natural to inter pret the rising of the sun at the winter solstice as the birth of Ra, having been deposited there from the womb of Nut along a straightline path from the north celestial pole. Thereafter, the sun moved northward from its point of origin but returned to its birthplace once each year. The correlation with the head of Nut was found to occur after sunset on the spring equinox when the sun sets due West. About an hour and a quarter after sunset, when the sky would have been dark enough to see the Milky Way, the head of Nut could be seen facing upwards on the horizon with her mouth near the due West point. It is hard to imagine a more spectacular evocation than the goddess having consumed the sun as it passed through her mouth. Having now treated the conception/birth aspects of the sun with respect to the Milky Way at some length, it isworthwhile tore-read the scribal lines quoted earlier5 regarding the position in the sky of Nut's body parts. More sense is obtained from them by equating Nut with the Milky Way than with the whole area of the sky north of the Milky Way.</page><page sequence="16">320 R. A. W e 1 1 s SAK 19 The number of days between the spring equinox and the winter solstice also happened tobe the period of human gestation, further adding to the picture of conception at the first and birth at the second of these times16. In fact,this specific relationship is probably the origin of the theological concept of Ra as the self-creating god in which he brings his own self into being. A final note of significance relates to the due West point of the horizon. Throughout the whole of ancient Egyptian history, the west represented the location of the Necropolis, and facing the west was an important orientation for the deceased. It is clear from the corre lation in this study that importance was placed on the due West point as the entrance into the Duat. In fact, the Old Kingdom pyramids may have had their E-Worientation primarily because the entrance into the Duat was due West17. It is true that most of them have the mortuary temples and valley temples on the eastern side of the monument. Consequently, many people have interpreted the orientation of the pyramids as being primarily to the east; but this may have simply arisen because of the geometry? the order from the river to get to the sarcophagus chamber places these smaller structures first. Simply to argue that east faces the direction of sunrise is not enough since we can now say with some definite force that thebirthplace of Ra was not due East but rather to the southeast at the horizon point of the winter solstice sunrise18. 16 The timing of these events has a note of curiosity about them. Since we are dealing with conception and birth, one might also expect a correlation with the rise of the Nile and fertilization of the land and the time of harvest. However, The Nile rise was a summer event, often near the summer solstice, sometimes as early as late May, but not asearly as March (Greg.). On the other hand, there is such an agricultural correlation between conception/time of birth elsewhere. The spring equinox in Predynastic times marked the rise of the Tigris-Euphrates rivers and floods in Mesopotamia. One might therefore ask whether the earliest form of the Nut myth arose there instead and was later imported into Egypt? *' The pole star aDraconis had an influence as well since the ihmw-sk revolved around a point very close to it without setting. As is well known (see I. E.S. Edwards, The Pyramids of Egypt, Penguin, Harmondsworth, U.K.,1985, rev.ed., pp. 279-80 for the more complete discussions), the north face 'airshaft1 of the Khufu pyramid as well as the north face main entrances of all of the Giza pyramids are inclined at an angle such that light from the pole star could have entered the various structures. 18 The author is indebted to Dr. Anthony J. Spalinger for a critical reading of an earlier draft of this paper and for the provision of some reference material. He also gives a note of thanks to Dr. Abdel-Azzuz Sadek for having expressed his own belief that Nut was the Milky Way which was the impetus eventually to complete this article.</page><page sequence="17">1992 The Mythology of Nut and the Birth of Ra 321 6. Addendum As a note of interest, it might also be adduced that the relationship between equinoctial sunset/conception and midwinter sunrise/birth for the origin of Ra as the self-creating god is also the origin of the matrilineal inheritance of the throne of Egypt. One title of the reigning queen was normally 'God's Wife' (i.e., of Amun in the early 18th Dynasty, for example)19, and the pharaohs, at least since the 5th Dynasty, were referred to as 'Son of Raf. Although Ra was the self creating god par excellence, as this paper has shown he could not have given birth to himself without the help of the goddess Nut, a female. Hence, it is likely that the concept of the inheritance of the throne through the female line owes its origin to celestial events that gave rise to the mythology of Nut and the birth of Ra. 19 For adiscussion of the matrilineal inheritance of the throne in the 18th Dynasty see C Aldred, Akhenaten, (rev. ed.,1988), pp. 134-141. Whatever the title used in previous eras, the basic idea that the sun god assumes the form of the reigning pharaoh to impregnate the chief queen in order to produce the new pharaoh does reflect the action of the sun entering the mouth of Nut to impregnate her for his own birth at the winter solstice 9 months later. The first-born female of the reigning queen, of course, inherits her mother's role as Nut. Consequently, the first-born male as the sun god must marry his sister in order to perpetuate the cycle. That it was not always possible to maintain the cycle perfectly or even consanguineously gave rise to different Dynasties and other problems which are not of concern here.
