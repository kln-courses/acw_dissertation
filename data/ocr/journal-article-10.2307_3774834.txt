<plain_text><page sequence="1">Art and Illusion among the Classic Maya MICHAEL D. COE Although the brilliant artist-archaeologist Tatiana Proskouriakoff had never seen the famous murals of Bonampak in situ, but only as copies, her analysis of them reflects majority opinion about Classic Maya painting: that these ancient artists had no skill, or even interest, in producing the illusion of depth or solidity for shapes drawn on two-dimensional surfaces. Half a century ago, she wrote: "[I]t seems to me that the pri- mary aesthetic value of the Bonampak paintings lies not in their coloring, but in their lines, and that they are best regarded as colored drawings. Comparison with great paint- ings of the Renaissance or later Western styles which were concerned with three-dimensional forms, visual color effects, and chiaroscuro, would be unjust."' In this essay, I will demonstrate the opposite, that several kinds of illusion- istic techniques, including chiaroscuro (use of light and shade), were practiced among the lowland Maya during the Classic period. The late art historian Ernst Gombrich, in his Art and Illusion,2 argued that there had been a "revolution" in Greek art between 550 and 350 B.C., when three-dimensional Mlu- sionism in the form of chiaroscuro, foreshortening, and cast shadows was introduced. Although no monumental paintings of the period have survived, quite a lot is known about them from Roman copies or imitations, such as some of the murals at Pompeii, and the famous mosaic of the triumph ofAlexan- der over Darius. This Greco-Roman tradition survived into later centuries, notably in the remarkable encaustic portraits preserved on mummies from the Fayum in Lower Egypt. While individual artists of other cultures may occasionally have tried these techniques, their efforts, according to Gom- brich, "remained without consequence," since "they do not become part of a tradition to be improved and extended, as they do in Greece." I have great admiration for Gombrich as a scholar and thinker, but here he exhibits cultural narrow- ness, for there has long been an obvious exception to this dictum, namely, the Upper Paleolithic cave-painting tradi- tion of southwestern France and northern Spain.At present, it appears that the world's oldest art consists of the extraor- dinary 35,ooo-year-old cave murals of Chauvet Cave, with sophisticated depictions of horses, lionesses, rhinos, bison, and the like.3 Not only are line and chiaroscuro shading used with great aplomb, but also overlap or occlusion (see below), to produce an overwhelming feeling of solidity and Opposite: detail of figure 8. realism for these long-extinct beasts. Like the so-called Greek revolution, the cave paintings also begin a tradition, which in this case is 13,000 years long, dying out only with the end of Magdalenian culture. It would now appear that there were not one, but four of these illusionistic revolutions: in the Upper Paleolithic age of Western Europe, in Classical Greece, in Renaissance Italy, and in the Maya lowlands. SEEING WITH THE BRAIN Illusions in art are essentially phenomena of perception. As neuropsychologist Richard Gregory tells us, the eye and brain combine "to give detailed knowledge of objects beyond the range of probing touch.... Seeing is probably the most sophisticated of all the brain's activities."4 The brain-that is, the visual cortex-is constantly making perceptual hypotheses on the basis of electrical impulses transmitted to it from the retina, and this process is not under intellectual control. V S. Ramachandran put it this way: "Our visual experience of the world is based on two-dimensional images: flat patterns of varying light-intensity and color falling on a single plane of cells in the retina.Yet we come to perceive solidity and depth.We can do this because a num- ber of cues about depth are available in the retinal image: shading, perspective, occlusion of one object by another, and stereoscopic disparity. In some mysterious way the brain is able to exploit these cues to recover the three-dimensional shape of objects."5 The ability to exploit shading is probably the most primitive of all.To the vertebrate brain (including our own), since there is only one sun in our solar system, the light source is usually from above, and that light source is single. The extreme antiquity of this perceptive cue can be seen in the widespread evolutionary exploitation of countershading in nature: that is why preyed-upon animals such as fish and deer are dark on top and light below-to avoid detection by predators, they must not appear to be three-dimensional. As experiments by neuroscientists have shown, to convey a convincing image of depth, a shaded surface must also be enclosed by an outline; changing an object's boundaries can produce striking changes in perception. Yet in the real 53</page><page sequence="2">1- _SES A- - ^ _ Xr B ' - r , r iL A_' _ AL | - 'as S lo !e r Ad - l w - I ,.K g - : I it'd 50 s Pt90S - r * P He * - % An - 7i Hasp, As.., X am '$:!; 04&gt;,ni, X W A. - e'={s 6w; _ - He _ _ ,fE'4:(v , * 4 as ,Xi_ v ,,n,,W,,j, DX 1 _ ir _ _ I i .

Artists as early as those who produced the images in Chauvet Cave had discovered which key contours must be perceived by the visual brain-and drawn by the hand-to identify the essential structure of an object.6 Even illusory outlines can produce depth.That is the secret of the effectiveness of line drawings. Yet, as deeply rooted in our unconscious minds as shad- ing is, even this may be overridden by other, more deeply rooted perceptual clues. Perhaps the most powerful of these is face recognition, present even in newborn infants. In a much-reproduced pair of images by R. L. Gregory,7 we see on the left a "normal" photograph of a sculpted human face, lit from above; on the right is a photograph of a hollow mold taken from that same face, similarly lit. It is virtually impossible for a viewer to perceive the right-hand image as anything other than the same "positive" face, but lit from below.We, that is, our brains, are "hard-wired" to see brows, noses, and chins as coming toward us, rather than receding. We see with our brains, not with our eyes. But chiaroscuro, light and shade to produce the percep- tion of solidity, has been only one device used by artists in some cultures to create a sense of distance on a flat surface.8 Some of these others, such as linear perspective and texture gradient, are peculiar to the art of the Western world from the Renaissance on. Cast shadows are known as early as the Greco-Roman tradition, while aerial (atmospheric) perspec- tive is also found in Chinese and Japanese painting. But one device, occlusion (overlay, overlap), is based on the principle that unless it is transparent, any object obscures anything fur- ther away from the viewer and directly in line with that observer. The simplest and strongest of all clues to depth, it is already spectacularly present in the art of the European Upper Paleolithic, for instance, in the depictions of herds of game seen in both cave painting and engravings on bone or antler. Plato famously disdained not only poetry but also "mimetic" (illusionistic) art, and would have banished both from his state. He argued that both pandered to the "lower reaches of the soul," to what we would now call the uncon- scious mind. He preferred the idealized, conceptual, iconic images of Egyptian art, forms that arose from reason, to the images of the "Greek revolution" that appealed to instinct. As art historian Paul Hills explained: "The symbolic mode of iconic art presented things as they were in their permanent, most significant form and as separate entities, related not by the visual continuum of light and space but in a hierarchy of ordered and immutable design."9 To Plato, illusion equaled delusion. Even so, high-level Platonic knowledge may still play a part in the perception of solid objects on two-dimensional surfaces. In the final stage, visual information interacts with high-level knowledge of light sources and of the nature of complex, three-dimensional objects.'0 Figure i. Spheres showing frontlit (a) and backlit (b) illumination in illusionistic art. 54</page><page sequence="4">CHIAROSCURO IN CLASSIC MAYA PAINTING In ancient Greek and Roman chiaroscuro, as well as in late medieval and early Renaissance painting in Italy, the artist generally placed the perceptual light source above and slightly in front of the scene or object (fig. ia).This can be seen in the somewhat diffuse light and shadow used in the frescoes of Giotto (1266-1336). The great innovator in the development of three-dimensional illusionism, however, was surely Masaccio (1401-?1428), whose great figural scenes in the Brancacci Chapel in Florence are illuminated from a single light source on one side, as they would have been from the chapel's actual window. By the end of the fifteenth century, Florentine painters like Botticelli were already making further experiments with chiaroscuro, play- ing with light sources simultaneously coming from more than one direction. An excellent example is his justly famous Birth of Venus in the Uffizi, where he has subtly combined the effect of frontal lighting with a delicate back- lighting to produce a stunning illusion of solidity in the limbs and body of the foam-born goddess. The same kind of apparent backlighting (fig. ib) is the hallmark of the three-dimensional chiaroscuro employed by Classic Maya artists. I must first caution the reader that, in thinking about Maya painting, it should be remembered that our knowledge of Classic Maya practice is seriously skewed by the nature of the available evidence, which by necessity is based almost entirely upon polychrome vases from the Late Classic period. There are no surviving codices, although there once must have been many thou- sands in all of the royal libraries of lowland capitals. Even more serious has been the loss of the mural art of these same cities, with a few lucky exceptions, most notably, as we shall see, Bonampak and the important Early Classic B-XIII mural of Uaxactun. The latter is known only from a water- color copy by the talented Guatemalan artist Antonio Tejeda, as the original was destroyed by hands unknown some time after its discovery by Carnegie Institution of Washington archaeologists." We are also dependent upon copyists for the analysis of the Bonampak murals, for these brilliant paintings, relatively intact upon their discovery in I946, are now only shadows of their former selves after more than half a century of neglect and inept attempts at cleaning by the authorities-a loss to the world of art com- parable in scope to the World War II bombing of Andrea Mantegna's Eremitani frescoes in Padua. The vases, now easily studied thanks to the rollout photographic record published by Justin Kerr, exhibit extensive use of shading cues. I first began to notice this phenomenon on pictorial ceramics in i97I, when I was mounting an exhibition on Maya hieroglyphic writing in the Grolier Club in NewYork. In the catalogue of the exhibi- tion, I saw this technique as a kind of "reverse chiaroscuro," since, in contrast to most Western practice, the Maya painter shaded the inner parts of limbs and torsos and illuminated the edges.'2 One of the eighth-century vases in question, Grolier 30, is painted with a double scene showing two enthroned individuals receiving maize tamales from subor- dinates. Two of the latter are seated on the left (fig. 2), with arms folded in submission. While generally ocher in color tone, the interiors of their faces and bodies have been smoothly darkened with subtle, semitransparent layers of pigment slip, apparently applied either with a dry brush or, more likely, with the tip of a finger. Our perception of the illumination is one of a diffused light coming from some- where beyond the scene.This is exactly the kind of backlit chiaroscuro that I now realize was present on many Maya vases, and (to anticipate) even in Maya murals. A detail from another Late Classic polychrome vase shows a very sinister-looking, seated ruler leaning forward to witness the beheading of a captive (fig. 3). Again, a darker pigment has been lightly applied to his largely naked body to present the illusion of solidity, with diffused background illumination. But there is something else: foreshortening of the upper part of his bent right leg. Even though the Maya artist never used linear perspective (any attempt to show it brands the vase as a fake), foreshortening is a very effective way of indicating depth, one that recurs at Bonampak. The immense difficulties in producing such complex and convincing scenes on ceramics with brush and colored slips make us wonder at the technical expertise and artistic finesse of these long-dead artists: they were painting in a medium that completely altered in color during the firing process, they were working on a very small scale (compared to the murals), and they had to wrap these involved scenes-some of them perhaps taken from codices-around cylinders and 55</page><page sequence="5">w- ) S~~~~~~~~~~~~~w , 'A h&amp;4 Figure 2.

They also had to understand Maya texts and know how to write them in a beautiful hand. The greatest of them were masters of chiaroscuro effects. One of the finest Late Classic polychromes in exis- tence is a black-background cylinder in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (fig. 4). The vessel illustrates four Maya deities, along with a decapitated yet still-flying bird, in a mythological scene believed to center on the birth of the Maize God. The sophistication of the shading can be seen on that deity's body at the top of the vase, with the same I / I'_ ~~~~~~~~~~~~~.) Figure 3.

In a detail not much larger in reality than a postage stamp, another deity on this cylinder, the Jaguar God of the Underworld, is similarly shaded with a glaze of reddish pink color, perhaps underly- ing the fiery nature of this being suggested by its large, orange-red eye (fig. S). Classic Maya chiaroscuro can become increasingly formulaic in the hands of vase painters somewhat less sophisticated than the greatest masters of the art. Another black-background 56</page><page sequence="6">- - s 1~~~~~~~~~~4i - - Figure 4. Maya vase illustrating the birth of the Maize God (at the top of the vessel), Late Classic, A.D. 700-800.

Here we also have glaze-like applications of darker slips to indicate rounded, solid forms, but in a sort of "pink blush." I have seen a number of Late Classic vases with the same "pink blush" chiaroscuro, not simply on the bodies of humans and gods, but also on throne cushions and even on glyphs, to indicate that all these objects have depth (fig. 6).This has become a repeated cultural cue that tells the viewer, yes, this is indeed an object in three-dimensional space. 4 A Y'a 47 ' - Figure 5 Jaguar God of the Underworld gesturing toward the Maize God, detail of figure 4.

Private collection (Ki837, photograph: C Justin Kerr). An even more stylized technique is what I will call the "ttwo-toned cue," used only for the bodies of humans and anthropomorphic deities. Here, most of the torso, limbs, and even the head are painted in a flat red, with a narrow white or light-colored band left along edges. This is clearly not decorative body painting, as I once believed, but a more abstract form of backlit chiaroscuro. Figure 8 is a detail from a dancing Maize Gods vase identical in iconography to the "pink blush" figures in figure 7, but depicted in the "two- toned" mode. These two depth cues may even co-exist on the same vase (fig. 9), where the enthroned individuals are "ttwo-toned," but the Wind God engaged in writing a codex below them is given depth by the"pink blush" cue. Thus far, I have said nothing about Early Classic pictorial ceramics, for the simple reason that I know of no examples of chiaroscuro illusionism on pottery before the Late Classic I.' 1.: '4 _- ..- Figure 8.

Speaking of the "Greek revolution," Gombrich wrote: "Narrative art is bound to lead to space and the exploration of visual effects, and the reading of these effects in their turn demands a different kind of "mental set" from the magic scene with its enduring potency."i3 Polychrome ceramics of the Early Classic in the Maya lowlands, in fact, have remarkably few narrative scenes. In comparison, there is a profusion of narration on Late Classic polychrome vessels. Again, concerning Greco- Roman painting, Gombrich commented that "it is surely no accident that the tricks of illusionistic art, perspective, and modeling in light and shade were connected in classical antiquity with the design of theatrical scenery."'4 The Spaniards, including Bishop Diego de Landa, were im- pressed by the theatrical performances put on by the Maya, which included not only ritual dramas but also farces and 58</page><page sequence="8">4L-f~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~-f -Y~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~4 P11~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Figure 9.

I believe that this aspect of Maya culture is strongly represented in the narrative art of Late Classic ceramics; even the palace scenes, with their swagged curtains and musicians, resemble theater stages. Small wonder that vase painters should attempt to model the principal actors-gods, kings, queens, subordinates of various categories-with the "tricks" of light and shade, as well as foreshortening and occlusion. THREE-DIMENSIONALITY IN MAYA MURAL ART? Were Maya wall paintings, such as those of Bonampak, mere "colored drawings," as Proskouriakoff claimed? If one knew Bonampak only from the cartoonish renderings of the Mexican artist Agustin Villagra,'S one would have to agree, but the quarter-scale copies made by Antonio Tejeda tell another story. The originals of Tejeda's far more sensitive renderings, on permanent view at Harvard's Peabody Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology, clearly show examples of chiaroscuro.Tejeda had the advantage of seeing these frescoes immediately after their discovery and before decades of deterioration. The most accurate reconstruction of Bonampak's three painted rooms are the immensely impressive half-scale watercolors produced by artists Heather Hurst and Leonard Ashby as part of a large-scale project directed by Mary E. Miller of Yale University. These are based upon color and infrared photography, and on multispectral scanning. Heather Hurst tells me that she is also convinced that the figures in the paintings show three-dimensional illusionism. A con- vincing example is the sprawling, tortured, and probably 59</page><page sequence="9">Figure io.

Even Gombrich, who generally ignored Pre-Columbian art in his surveys, was impressed by the foreshortening shown here when he saw it inVillagra's copy.'6 The far more accurate rendering by Hurst and Ashby (fig. io), partly based on an infrared photograph taken by Giles Healey in 1948, clearly exhibits chiaroscuro modeling, as probably once did all of the many human figures depicted in these three rooms. A small mural panel affixed to one of the platform temples on Tonina's Grand AcropolisI7 depicts a reclining captive, clad only in a white loincloth and with one knee upraised, posed against a deep red background; his body and limbs show the same kind of backlit, chiaroscuro modeling that we have seen on so many coeval Late Classic vases. The recent finds at San Bartolo illuminate the deep roots of Maya mural painting in the Pre-Classic period.'8 By the last phase of Early Classic civilization in the Peten, during Tzakol 3, wall painting was already remarkably well devel- oped, as seen in the three-meter-long mural discovered on the west wall of Structure B-XIII at Uaxactun.I9 The excellent half-scale watercolor copy that Tejeda made immediately after it was uncovered has never been properly reproduced, but I have examined the original, also in the Peabody, and again, it is obvious that chiaroscuro modeling was used here in the same way as in Bonampak. If more wall paintings had survived from elsewhere in the Maya lowlands, the innovations of Maya painting, com- pared to the far more conservative sculptural tradition, could be better appreciated." Occlusion (overlay) was often used as a depth cue in Maya illusionism-a technique that goes back to Paleolithic animal paintings-but one wonders about position in the field.Typical of Western European art, this is an elementary rule of perspective: since we view the ground plane from above, the further away an object is on this plane, the higher it is in the visual field.2' A Late Classic polychrome vase from the Peten displays a highly theatrical scene, in which a crowd of celebrants stands before a ruler seated on a portable throne or palanquin. It is how this crowd is depicted that is of special interest (fig. ii).Three of the four most important individuals have their feet in stan- dard elevation, right "on the deck," so to speak; likewise, the three figures seated below and in front are in the usual posi- tion. But the knot of eight warriors to the left is different: they are massed in depth in a tour-de-force of illusionistic occlusion while the position of the leftmost individual's legs and feet show that the artist was aware of the position-in- 6o</page><page sequence="10">Figure i i.

The Maya mural painter must also have had this "trick" in his (or her) repertoire. CLASSIC MAYA HUMANISM Except for the Classic Maya, no other culture or people in ancient Mesoamerica, or for that matter, in the rest of the Pre-Columbian world, had the slightest interest in illusion- istic art. It is probably no accident that these same Maya also had a deep interest in portraiture, a trait that they certainly inherited from the Olmec. In fact, in the entire Western Hemisphere, only these two, along with the Moche of coastal Peru, were concerned with individual human beings, and with the human physiognomy. And further, it is significant that only the Maya had a writing system in which everything in their language could be expressed. One has only to look at the mural art of Teotihuacan to appreciate how different this was from the Maya painting tradition. At Teotihuacan are iconic representations only, with the same flat figure depicted repeatedly on a particular surface as though the artists were dealing with wallpaper. Plato would have been pleased by this as much as he would have been repelled by Maya narrative and illusionism. The art of Teotihuacan celebrates the eternal, not some transi- tory moment in time. There are no portraits ofTeotihuacan rulers, and no real writing in the strict sense, either. And despite all that we know about Aztec kings from post- Conquest accounts-a much later time, to be sure-it is still pertinent to ask, where are their pre-Conquest portraits? I think that we are faced with the same phenomenon in the three of the four cultures that independently developed a tradition of illusionistic art, namely, ancient Greece and Rome, north-central Italy in the Renaissance, and the Classic lowland Maya (I exclude here the Paleolithic cave tradition, which was exclusively centered on animals). All three shared a deep concern with individual human beings, and their actions and aspirations. Yes, there were gods and super- natural creatures in their worlds, but what was really im- portant was the human body, placed in a particular space and existing at a certain time. I can only call this concern "humanistic."22 6i</page><page sequence="11">NOTES i. Tatiana Proskouriakoff, "Artistic Aspects of the Bonampak Paintings," in Karl Ruppert, J. Eric S.

Probably because of the very small sample of Classic ceramics then available, Grieder underestimates the widespread use of shading or chiaroscuro in painting of the late Classic period, and its sophistication. 62</page></plain_text>
