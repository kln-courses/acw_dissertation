<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Trickster in Klamath Mythology THEODORE STERN I No CHARACTER in American Indian mythology has drawn more persistent attention than the trickster. Amoral, in turn greedy, cowardly, boastful, stupid, and lecherous, he is profoundly ignoble, yet possessed of supernatural power that often enables him to accomplish his selfish ends. In his course he may bring incidental benefit to mankind, and sometimes may go even further, stepping forth as champion of the less powerful against monsters bent upon destroying human beings. Widely popular, the trickster is known in America throughout the major part of the hemisphere, and his exploits are repeated with perhaps more stability than any other type of myth. In some regions he appears in human form, usually that of an older man; but over broad areas of the hemisphere he is found in the guise of an animal. In western North America, he takes the form of Raven along the North Pacific Coast of southern Alaska and northern British Columbia, to be replaced by Mink, then Bluejay, to the south; and giving way to Coyote in the Plateau area of eastern Washing- ton and Oregon and adjacent Idaho and Montana, in California, in the Great Basin region of Utah and Nevada, and in the Southwest. Occasionally, but not to any considerable degree, the traits attributed to the animal itself may play some part in the development of the characteristics of the trickster himself. Thus, Raven is said to be particularly distinguished by his insatiable greed, Mink by his amorous proclivities, and Coyote through vain boastfulness.' It often occurs that, in contrast to the picture presented above, more stress is laid by a mythology upon activities of the trickster of positive merit to man- kind. Franz Boas found a plausible explanation in the development of a dualism inherent in the ambivalence of the trickster. It seems quite intelligible that with the progress of society there should develop a tendency of substituting for the coarse motives of the primitive transformer higher ones. With the consciousness that the changes effected by the transformer were use- ful to man may have developed the idea that they were made with the view of benefiting mankind... Hence we find that wherever this idea is brought out most 1 F. Boas, Tsimshian Mythology, Bureau of American Ethnology Annual Report, 31 (1916), 876 f. [ 158]</page><page sequence="2">KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY 159 clearly, the tales of the trickster are ascribed to a different being. The personage of the transformer is split in two or more parts; the one representing the true culture hero, the other retaining the features of the trickster." Considerations of like nature have led de Angulo and Freeland to draw a dis- tinction between the Coyote cycle, comprising the trickster tales per se, of perhaps general distribution, and the somewhat more elevated theme of Grandfather Coyote of north central California." In similar vein, the Hills find it useful to draw a line, in Navaho mythology, between the "trotting or traveling coyote" stories and those of Coyote as a Holy Being.' As one aspect of a developed dualism, the trickster may appear as the mar- plot junior associated with an exemplary and powerful senior, often an elder brother. Such pairs appear in the Plateau region as Panther and his younger brother, Coyote, Wolf and Wildcat, Eagle and Coyote, Fox and Coyote, and Marten and Weasel (or Mink). In northern California the pair is most often Fox and Coyote and Fisher (Marten) and Weasel. Occasionally, the dualism is, as it were, self-created, as when the Takelma (Oregon) hero, Daldal, splits himself in twain with an arrow. Sapir, in discussing this motif, advances the view that Daldal represents "an amalgamation of the conception of the typical single culture hero, who is at the same time transformer and trickster ... with that of the 'Hero Brothers.' "" II The relationship between the various forms of the trickster-in the Grand- father role, in the "trotting" cycle, and as a sibling pair-is well exemplified in the mythology of the Klamath Indians of southern Oregon." Here the trick- ster is a familiar-not to say, popular-character; and incidents of deceit and cunning abound. In appraising the attributes of Klamath tricksters, it is possible to make inferences from the roles played by each, by the interpersonal situations in which he is involved. However, one must bear in mind that attitudes toward 2 Introduction to J. Teit, Traditions of the Thompson Indians of British Columbia, American Folklore Society Memoirs, 6 (1898), lo.

Moreover, as we shall see, the present-day attitude toward certain characters may well be colored by the European standards which have been adopted. The characteristics of the tricksters at Klamath may in part be delimited by first noting those beings which approach, but do not attain, the conditions usually considered requisite by folklorists.7 The evil father-in-law, who transforms his sons in order that they may slay Cottontail Rabbit, fails to qualify: his personality is one of unrelieved evil. Somewhat closer to the qualities of the trickster is the stock character, known only as Gajichwach Son, and occupying the role that in the mythology of the Modoc, neighbors and close linguistic congeners of the Klamath, is allotted to Tusasas, Joker." For the Klamath, he is the vain and boastful one, whose shabby possessions reflect his shiftlessness, and whose baseless claims lead invariably to his humiliation. Unlike the tricksters, he lacks supernatural, or even merely mundane, power. In effect, Gajichwach Son is a buff, intro- duced as a humorous byplay in a myth centered about the deeds of other char- acters. A better claim to trickster status can be put forth for Skunk. While Tusasas in Modoc mythology is equated with this animal, the Klamath Skunk is quite distinct. He is never confused with Gajichwach Son, and the role he plays is consistent throughout. It might be added that Curtin's collection of Modoc myths reveals no counterpart to the Klamath Skunk tales. The salient char- acteristic of Skunk is his scent, here likened to flatus, coupled with an inordi- nate vanity. In one myth, five Skunks march along, slaying those who do not admire them, until Eagle in revenge kills all but the youngest. The latter thereupon masquerades as a shaman, slays with his flatus all of Eagle's kinsmen gathered at a seance, and is abducting Eagle's sister when Eagle himself clubs Skunk to death. When Morning Star calls, Skunk revives from what he deems mere slumber. A second myth recounts Skunk's fishing, shooting the fish with his flatus, so disgusting his sister-in-law that she induces his wife to flee with her to the Dalles. Skunk follows them there, rejects all who paddle across for him, and only consents when his sister-in-law comes. By pretending to be jealous for him, she persuades him to crawl inside a sack, which she then dumps into the river. 7 For comparative purposes, I am using the definitions set forth by folklorists, e.g., S. Thompson, Tales of the North American Indians (Cambridge: Harvard University Press, 1929) and The Folktale (New York: Dryden Press, 1946); E. W. Voegelin, "Trickster," "Transformer," "Coyote," in M. Leach, ed., The Funk and Wagnalls Standard Dictionary of Folklore and Mythology (1949-1950). I have not found a single term applied by the Klamath to denote tricksters. 8 J. Curtin, Myths of the Modocs (London: Sampson Low, Marston &amp; Co., Ltd., 1912), pp. 155-157, 165-167; 199 f., 223-225, 229, 253, 254-263, 307, 366-369.</page><page sequence="4">KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY 161 The Skunk myths thus offer adequate grounds for considering him a trick- ster. Given on occasion to disguise, able to dispatch his foes, he iS at the same time vain, foolishly amorous, and capable of being deceived. The Klamath consider him a "bad fellow," but an amusing one-their reaction to most of the other tricksters. Another pair of characters are Chakeak, Little Lad, and Wolf. The two myths collected from one informant do not afford sufficient basis for judging their attributes. In two, Chakeak acts as the assistant of Wolf, who pretends to be ill in order to lure animals into his lodge. The first tale involves deer, which are drawn in to dance at the supposed death of their foe. As they dance, Chakeak pushes the animals one by one into a prepared pit. In the second myth, Chakeak summons an elk to doctor the "patient," acts as his interpreter, mocks him, and thus gives away the plot. These may validly be considered trickster tales, although the character of Chakeak' and that of Wolf are not as well developed as those of other tricksters. Chakeak also appears in a third myth, recounted by the same informant, in which he and his grandmother slay a monster grizzly bear which is destroying their village. In this tale, Chakeak plays a role appropriate to the boy heroes of American Indian myth- ology." Perhaps the most popular pair in Klamath mythology today are Mink and his younger brother, Weasel. Mink is clever and resourceful, a warrior, "tricky," but consistently just in the roles he plays. Like a shaman, "he knows everything that happens." Both he and Weasel are shapeshifters, but it is chiefly Mink who transforms others. In the myths collected about him, Mink harms only those who give him direct provocation, or those who menace others. In effect, his role is very like that of the Transformer in northern Cali- fornia. Weasel, on the other hand, is the marplot, "always getting into some- thing." He lacks completely, however, the base qualities of the trickster. Mis- chievous, curious, a restless bundle of random activity, a "kid brother" who wants to try what Mink is doing, and fails in the attempt, Weasel is only occasionally represented as having great power of his own. His loyalty to Mink is profound, although one myth finds him egging on his son to slay Mink's. Upon occasion, Mink will carry him thrust inside his clothing, much as his counterpart rides in Marten's quiver in northern Californian mythology. Mink and Weasel feature in a number of myths which are combined loosely into a cycle. The episodes combined in this manner may vary from one story- teller to the next. In one sequence, the brothers visit Fish-Hawk and his wife, 1 In the corresponding Modoc version of the first, he is replaced by Coyote. Curtin, op. cit., pp. 183-185. 10 See Thompson, Tales of the North American Indians, pp. 78-125, and The Folktale, pp. 329-344.</page><page sequence="5">162 WESTERN FOLKLORE their sister. A tiny gift of food which they bring, when swallowed by the con- temptuous Fish-Hawk, swells miraculously, and it is only on the petition of his wife that Mink prescribes the treatment that will save him from choking to death. When, at Fish-Hawk's command, a meager fish is broiled for them, Mink causes it to grow. When he has eaten, Mink throws the bones into the water, when they become a large fish again. Fish-Hawk spears it, is dragged into the water, and once more is rescued by his wife upon the intercession of Mink. Brought to land, the fish resumes again its meager form. Another tale introduces the Lost Brother theme, without however the journey to the sun so frequent in northern Californian cognates." Here the irrepressible Weasel is drawn by curiosity to the scene of torchlight fishing, where he plays fish and is speared for his pains. Mink thereupon turns himself into an old woman, deceives and slays a woodchopper gathering pitchwood for a fire to dry the captive; and in the guise of the woodchopper is ferried across the river, where he rescues Weasel and burns his captors, house and all. In the sequel, Mink deceives and slays five monsters. Another myth tells of the deeds by which Mink destroys the Thunders, sparing a kinswoman living with them. Here again it is the feckless Weasel who lets one of the Thunders escape. Mink thereupon prescribes and limits the activities of Thunder in the postmythic world. Sexual matters enter but little into the myths of Mink and Weasel. The former is frequently depicted as the husband of the durable and devoted Wood Tick. One myth, however, has Weasel bringing home a crowd of women he has met, only to have Mink reject all but a pair of one-eyed women, one for each. That night, Weasel, the novice, attempts in random fashion to have intercourse with the various parts of his wife's body; and it is only the next morning that Mink can give him the proper instructions. Another myth, re- corded in fragmentary form, introduces Weasel as the seducer of Frog, whose husband catches them in flagrante. Although the Klamath view Mink as akin to other tricksters of their myth- ology, the folklorist is more profoundly struck by the degree to which he differs from them. In the myths at hand, Mink engages in trickery only when forced to do so. Weasel, who exhibits weak marplot attributes, is essentially the foil for the actions of his elder brother. In contrast to the rivalry and deceit which characterize relations between such pairs as Fox and Coyote in northern Cali- fornia and on the Plateau, the dominant stress in the Mink-Weasel relation- ship is that of elder and younger brother. The Klamath dwell upon the grief which one brother feels at the supposed death of the other. While Mink is occasionally severe with Weasel's lapses, on the whole he is protective. On his 11 And present in the Modoc version, Curtin, op. cit., pp. 300-303.</page><page sequence="6">KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY 163 part, Weasel is only rarely motivated by a desire to get the better of Mink": he causes trouble out of an absorbing curiosity, in a bumbling effort to be help- ful. He is innocently mischievous, usually well-meaning, but inept. It is evident, therefore, that Mink and Weasel, as well as their numerous counterparts extending within the Plateau into northern California, and so frequently found in the widespread Lost Brother myth, may on occasion possess culture-hero or transformer qualities akin to those of the monster- slaying "twin heroes." By the same token, they seem to be fairly distinct from those pairs found associated in the same region with a creator-marplot role. Coyote, the archtrickster of so much of western North America, is, surpris- ingly enough, not prominent in the mythology collected in 1951. That this is no recent development is indicated by Gatschet's observation that Coyote was far less popular among the Klamath than among their southern congeners, the Modoc, a fact which he seems to ascribe to the relative paucity of the beasts in the Klamath Lake country." Other explanations, it seems to me, are at least equally plausible; they will be offered below. The minor stature of Coyote seems undoubted. He appears in no role that is central to Klamath cosmogony; indeed, the tales collected are of the typical "traveling coyote" type." Typi- cally, this handful of myths presents Coyote as a gambler (an activity favored in Klamath culture), otherwise characterized by a lecherous bent, by wanton cruelty, and by stupidity. In a familiar tale, he tries to imitate little Thunder- bird in juggling his eyes, only to have Crow swallow them in mid-air. The blinded trickster goes down the mountain, sightless or with rose hips for eyes, bumping into trees which then disclose their name; until at length he reaches water. The sequel has two versions. In one, Coyote tricks Deer and snatches his eyes as a replacement. In the other, he encounters a man who tries the eyes of various animals, ending with those of a fish. Going along, Coyote then meets a grizzly bear, engaging him in a contest, which includes the motif of the substituted vomit, in order to determine which of the two is the more horrible. A little further, Coyote meets five formidable skunks, whom he pacifies by pretending kinship. Finally, he walks into the mouth of a monster, slays him, and releases the people who have been devoured. In another tale, he matches strength with Bull-Fish, in the course of which he is nearly drowned. A third myth opens with the gambling contest into which he inveigles a small bird. 1 The exception is in the episode in which Mink's son nearly strikes his cousin with an arrow, whereupon Weasel counsels the latter to shoot to kill in a similar instance. Yet, after the two boys have slain each other, one informant found it not extraordinary that the grieving Mink should then put his brother into his bosom when he went out to mourn. '1 Gatschet, op. cit., II: i, p. cii. A Yana myth, from north central California (R. B. Dixon in E. Sapir, Yana Texts [Together with Yana Myths Collected by R. B. Dixon], University of California Publications in American Archaeology and Ethnology, 9 [191o], 213), recounting the efforts of Fox to remove all traces of Coyote from the earth, in order to prevent his rebirth, specifies that the spot overlooked was at Klamath Lake. Perhaps this is another reflection of the same observation. " An exception is the myth to be found in Gatschet, op. cit., II: i, p. ciii, in which the culture hero, in order to shorten the winter, smashes half of the moons hung in the lodge of a female coyote.</page><page sequence="7">164 WESTERN FOLKLORE When he has won all his possessions, Coyote goes on to Sage-Hen's house, where he ruthlessly burns to death the young Sage-Hens. The parents ambush him and knock him over a cliff, after which the small bird revives the dead children. In yet another well-known tale, Porcupine has tricked Elk and has slain him, whereupon Coyote comes up and engages him in a jumping contest for the meat. After winning, Coyote goes off, leaving his cap behind on guard; but Porcupine outwits the cap, carries the flesh up a tree, and, when Coyote and his children return, deceives them and drops the backbone upon them, killing them. Coyote's amorous ventures are less numerous than might be expected. The only myth collected involves his long-distance intercourse with a girl across the river, in the midst of which Coyote loses the end of his organ. In order to recover it, he masquerades as shaman and is called in when the girl becomes ill. During the seance, he has intercourse with her and recovers what he had lost. When he is discovered he takes to his heels. In the dawn of the world, when the mythic beings choose the forms and roles they will bear, Coyote elects to be the Moon. From his vantage point, nothing is hidden from him, and he begins to broadcast the private acts of men and women below. From that time on he is ordained to travel on earth and to "sing" in the dark, as he does today. The tricksters thus far noted-and from these remarks Mink and Weasel must be excepted-do not enter prominently into myths detailing the origin of features of the present-day world. It is otherwise with the next to be de- scribed, the major figure of Klamath mythology, Kmukampsh, "ancient old man," anthropomorphic deity and analogue to the trickster-transformer of much of western America. A culture hero, creator, ordainer of the present order, he also betrays himself as a "tricky, treacherous, and low character, as a typical beast-god."" The beginning of the world finds Kmukampsh adrift upon a lake.'" Presently he strands upon Gopher's house and joins him. Gopher brings forth from his mouth the foods that will be eaten, then causes his guest to sleep while he rears up the hills and mountains of the Klamath world. The two play games, in so doing producing many natural features of the present landscape. Then it is that Kmukampsh peoples the world with animals and, placing a charac- teristic material in each territory--obsidian for the Achomawi and Paiute, marble in the Shasta country, tules for the Klamath-from which mankind, it seems, arises. As the smoke of their campfires rises, Gopher acknowledges him as the "elder brother."'' It might be added that Klamath who today do not 15 Ibid., II: 2, p. 139. 16 The Klamath word may actually be applied to any large body of water. 17 Curtis, op. cit., p. 21o. Gatschet, op. cit., II: 1, p. lxxxi, also alludes to it.</page><page sequence="8">KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY 165 know the tale even in fragmentary form still refer to Kmukampsh by the epithet, "earth-maker." Aside from the version just given of the creation of mankind, the Klamath have two others. One has him making the Klamath from serviceberry bushes and another people from skunks." The other version has Kmukampsh bring back bones from the afterworld, from which he creates the present-day tribes." The theft of fire is not detailed in any Klamath myth now at hand, but a sequence almost identical in its chief features with the Modoc tale-the obstacle flight of Kmukampsh, the fast runners, and dove-appears instead in another context, the recovery of Mink's stolen heart.' A number of myths allude to a council of mythic beings, presided over by Kmukampsh, in the course of which the present order of things is ordained. The length of the seasons is determined in the course of a dispute between Ant and Bear. At the same time, another myth relates that Kmukampsh reduced the number of moons, in order to shorten the winter, by smashing all but twelve in the possession of a female coyote." In the course of the council, the duration of human life is established during an argument between Garter- Snake and Gopher, the latter as marplot.22 I am unaware of a myth narrating the origin of death in either Klamath or Modoc collections. Finally, animals decide the form they will assume in the present world. Kmukampsh acts directly in a few cases for the benefaction of mankind. At Klamath Falls, he erected a fish dam" and elsewhere in the Klamath country he set up three sweat lodges for those mourning their dead.2' On Sprague River, where he had his poorly made lodge-now a cave, but still leaky-the deity enacted the first-sucker rite and ordained that those to follow should do likewise.25 Present-day localities were named by him," and many natural fea- tures are attributed to his acts. Aside from these acts, and a handful of others of similar nature, few of his deeds reflect altruistic intent. More frequently, we find baser motives of char- acteristic trickster form. The cunning Kmukampsh disguises himself and incites the sage-hens to war on each other, then claims the valiant dead for cremation. Just as he is roasting the juicy fowl, his ruse is discovered and he 18 Gatschet, op. cit., II: 1, p. 103. Cf. L.

Greed emerges in another tale, with the familiar Moses motif. Kmu- kampsh disguises himself as a baby and floats downriver to two women, who take him in. When they are gone, he devours the camas roots spread out to dry, then tries to shift the blame on an antelope. When his tracks give him away, the trickster takes to his heels. In a few myths, Kmukampsh is simply the dupe of other scapegraces. Thus, his wife, Frog, betrays him with Weasel; the irate deity hurls a maul which the coupling pair only manage to dodge. More usually, however, it is his own actions that bring him to grief. It is by his lecherous qualities that Kmukampsh is particularly distin- guished. The size of his member is said to be truly mythic, and in some dis- cussions becomes the focus of some elaboration.27 When he impersonates his foster son, he tucks it away beneath his belt. In order to verify his suspected identity, Night-Hawk is hired to produce a breeze that lifts his loin cloth; and the impostor is truly exposed." When Kmukampsh shams death in order to seduce his daughter, it is by a comparison of this feature that the daughter and her mother discover the deception. Thereupon, the trickster takes to his heels. In another tale, he transforms his organ into meat drying on a rack and offers it to passing women. In yet another, he lunges after two girls bathing in the river, only to miss them both. Another has him abusing himself in apparent privacy only to have his act broadcast by a floating feather. The standard myth of his lechery, however, involves his attempt to seduce the wife of his foster son, Aisis. Attracted by her, Kmukampsh causes sparks to fly from the fires so that, in dodging, she exposes her privates. He then induces Aisis to climb a tree, produced from the clean-stemmed sorrel grass, to secure meadow larks which have been transformed into eagle fledglings. When Aisis has divested himself of his clothing and has climbed into the tree, the trickster magically causes the tree to rise, stranding Aisis in the sky. Kmukampsh then goes home clad like Aisis, takes the wife, though his mas- querade is suspected, and goes south on a gambling excursion with Silver Fox, just as Aisis formerly did. It is in vain; he is shown up on every side, and when Aisis wins his way back to earth, Kmukampsh in turn is tricked and destroyed. From the heavens, he comes to life again and seeks to cover the world with pitch; but Aisis thwarts him once more." In a few instances, the trickster is depicted in a more kindly light. His death is brought about in part through his grandson, with whom he plays affection- " According to Gatschet, ibid., II: 1, p. lxxx, the thistle is called "Kmukampsh's organ." 2s Cf. Curtin, op. cit., pp. 14 f., where the Modoc version has instead a blue disk secured from the real father of the foster son, as the identifying mark. If this is not a bowdlerized version--one of Curtin's informants was a woman and his collections were published for the general public-it suggests the increasing sublimation of the culture hero as we approach the central Californian area. 2 Gatschet, op. cit., II: 1, pp. 94-97, has two incomplete versions; Curtis, op. cit., pp. 21o-212, has one extended account; Stern MS has three additional forms.</page><page sequence="10">KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY 167 ately. In several stories mention is made of a daughter of whom he seems fond. Parenthetically, it might be remarked that his wife is usually identified only as "Old Woman" and does not appear in any myth, with the exception of that concerning Weasel and Frog. It is to his daughter that Kmukampsh brings the infant, Aisis, whom he has rescued, and it is she who helps him raise the boy. When his daughter, married to Wolf, dies, the informant dwells upon the anguish with which Kmukampsh hands her ghost the funeral dress. Clinging to her dress, he travels to the realm of the dead, where he experiences the bewildering indignities of a world in which everything is contrary to mun- dane experience. At length, he returns, bringing with him the bones to be transformed into the present tribes of men." These, then, are the chief tricksters of Klamath mythology. However, other characters also appear briefly in a corresponding role, as does Porcupine in the slaying of Elk. The prevalence of myths revolving about the trickster type is a commentary upon its popularity in Klamath mythology. At the same time, there are certain delimitations of role, ranging from the shrewd and essentially righteous Mink, who has many of the attributes of the culture hero, to the base and wanton Coyote. Kmukampsh alone spans the full range, extending even beyond Mink in power and beneficial role," and, at the other extreme, he easily matches the lecheries and greed of Coyote. The contrast in some of these qualities best appears in those myths in which several of the characters appear together. One has already been mentioned involving Weasel and Kmukampsh. Another extended myth relates the war made upon Mink by monsters living in Crater Lake. In one sequence, a female monster succeeds in stealing the heart of the valiant Mink, and gives it to her people for a ball, upon which Weasel comes to Kmukampsh for help. Gather- ing swift runners, Kmukampsh seizes the heart and flees, confounding his pursuers by shifting his shape successively into a stump, a thicket, and a river. The heart is then passed to a series of fast runners, who relay it on until it is brought back home, placed in the body and Mink is revived. The sequence of the flight is closely paralleled in Modoc mythology by that of the theft of fire, the role of Kmukampsh being taken by Fox-Old-Man.32 In the Klamath version, informants stress the great power of Kmukampsh. Another myth involves Coyote, who follows the love song of an unseen woman, oblivious to the needs of his children at home. After some days he encounters her, the daughter of Kmukampsh, and marries her. On their 30 See also Spier, op. cit., pp. lo2 f., for a summary of this myth. Another Orpheus myth, with human characters, was also collected in 1951. A. H. Gayton, "The Orpheus Myth in North America," JAF, 48 (1935), 282, gives an outline of a myth collected by Spier, again with human actors, but differing from that told me. 31 Although his motivation seems in the main egotistical. 32 Curtin, op. cit., pp. 51-59, especially p. 53.</page><page sequence="11">168 WESTERN FOLKLORE return he finds his children dead, and his wife must bring them back to life. On the basis of this tale, some Klamath assert that in the visit to the land of the dead, the daughter's husband is actually Coyote, and not Wolf. Of another myth, of considerable interest, two variant versions are known. The first tells of a man whose grizzly bear accompanies him as a dog. In the course of visits to relatives, the man is received by Kmukampsh, who, despite the disclaimers of his guest, insists upon him pitting his dog in turn against five dogs owned by Kmukampsh. In each successive struggle, the combatants rise higher into the air, and the flesh of the dog drops down to earth, as the grizzly dispatches him. After the fifth dog has been slain, the grizzly rises to the moon. Kmukampsh then revives his dogs. The second version forms part of the Mink and Weasel series. Here, as they are returning from a series of adventures, Weasel plays the role of his brother's dog, and in the dogfight is armed by Mink with his special weapon. The insistent host is Night-Hawk, and the dogfight in the air forms only the last of a set of contests between Mink and the boastful, aggressive Night-Hawk. The resemblance between the two versions is heightened by a correspondence between the names of the host's five dogs." Further light upon the qualities that seem distinctive of the tricksters can be gathered from the attitudes of the Indians today. Here we must be aware of changes in attitude that arise from the processes of culture change. There is evident, for example, a shift relative to the elements we would consider ob- scene. These were formerly considered an integral part of the myth and, although the stories were narrated to a mixed audience of all ages, no details were omitted. Increasingly, as the Klamath have become aware of Euro- American attitudes, and as they themselves espouse them, there has been a tendency to elide or cover up what today are the equivalent of "dirty stories," restricted to small groups of adult familiars or to the members of a single sex. Christianity has likewise introduced a far clearer dualism in the super- natural sphere than appears to have existed earlier. As early as 1877, Kmu- kampsh was identified with the Christian deity. While such terms as "our ancient father" and "the one on high," applied to the Klamath deity, may be aboriginal in application, they establish common ground with Christian usage. Indeed, in rendering the Christian concept of God into Klamath, the term, "the one on high," was selected as appropriate." A contrasting term, "the one below," also cited by Gatschet, is according to the statement of an elderly informant merely a name coined for the introduced concept of the - Not all the names could be recalled, but there were at least two out of the five which were identical in the two versions. - Gatschet, op. cit., II: 1, p. lxxix. I have recast the first term. Both the Orpheus myth and that relating to Aisis end with Kmukampsh dwelling in the sky. For an early evaluation, see A. S. Gat- schet, "Volk und Sprache der Maklaks im siidwestlichen Oregon," Globus, 35 (1879), 170.</page><page sequence="12">KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY 169 Devil. In a Klamath version of the Garden of Eden, God, in the guise of Kmukampsh, is pitted against the machinations of "the one below."'' Addi- tional basis for the native identification of Kmukampsh and the Christian God is found in the chance correspondence in name and circumstances of relationship of Jesus and Aisis. The identification had already been made by 1877 by some Modoc," although it is perhaps less popular with the Klamath with whom I have spoken. Thus a Modoc, who is today a fundamentalist preacher on the reservation, remarks: "You know, Kmukampsh and Aisis- that's nothing but God and Jesus. The Indians knew the story of the Bible, but they were ignorant in those days. They thought that the lakes they performed their miracles around were the Klamath Lakes: they didn't know it was really the Sea of Galilee." Undoubtedly, the identification is aided by the fact that Kmukampsh and Aisis are among the few characters in Klamath mythology who are anthropo- morphic. Of many of the others, a certain measure of uncertainty is voiced. Informants were repeatedly baffled by the fact that mythic beings combined bestial and human attributes. Some of the characteristic qualities of certain beings appear to be derived from those attributed to their present-day brute counterparts." Although the anthropomorphic character of Kmukampsh effectively re- moves him from this area of doubt, his trickster qualities make his identifi- cation with the Christian Deity doubtful in the minds of many Klamath today. In the major myth in which Aisis appears, the actions of Kmukampsh are seen by informants as incompatible with those of Christianity. "Kmu- kampsh-they say he's God-I think he's the Devil myself!" sums up the views of many. It might be hypothesized that the introduction of the concept of polar duality for divine beings, and the failure of Kmukampsh to attain the higher pole, may have led to his being relegated to the diabolical role that forms the other extreme. Under these circumstances, it might be argued, the Kla- math divinity has in historic times been increasingly identified with baser deeds, and his tricksterlike character correspondingly accentuated. On the whole, such as theory finds little support in the data at hand. The trickster myths in the Kmukampsh series can be traced back, in the accounts of elderly informants, to a period too early to have been affected by mis- sionary activities. Gatschet, speaking of Coyote, notes that he is represented as "a being which has many points of contact with Kmukampsh, but is dis- 3 Gatschet, Klamath Indians, II: 1, pp. xciii f. 36 Ibid., p. xciv. 37 Cf.

A sidelight upon the ambiguity surrounding the mythic beings is the fact that the linguistic forms used of them are at times those proper to humans, and again appropriate to the beast.</page><page sequence="13">170 WESTERN FOLKLORE tinct from him. Both are regarded simultaneously as sky-gods and as funny clowns."" Present-day informants, it might be added, roundly reject any identification of the two and express incredulity when informed that other tribes told Kmukampsh myths with Coyote as the hero. This showed, said one man, how poorly other tribes understood the myths. It seems improbable, therefore, that the trickster tales of the Kmukampsh series represent a recent borrowing from a well-developed Coyote series. Rather, the presence of char- acteristic "traveling coyote" tales in the Kmukampsh cycle would seem to offer a probable explanation for the relative poverty of such tales relating to Coyote himself."3 If Kmukampsh is never identified with Coyote, he is often confused with Mink. First noted by Gatschet,4" the confusion is present even today, and one informant smilingly corrected himself repeatedly in the course of a single tale. Klamath today take pains to distinguish between the two. "Kmukampsh, is not a gambler, like Aisis. He named the birds and beasts, and brings people to life again. His wife is 'little old woman.' He's not like Mink: Mink's a warrior." It seems plausible that confusion arises because the two popular characters are similar in the great power they possess and the manner in which they exert it. Attitudes toward these beings are revealed indirectly in the use of their names in daily life. A shrewd man might be nicknamed "Mink": on the other hand one boy received the appellation because he always lied out of a tight spot. "To act like [Mink]," observes Gatschet, "is to do something not meaning to do it apparently." Elsewhere, he adds, "In speaking of some- body who acts on the sly, and differently from what he professes and means to do, the Klamath Lake people will say: 'He acts like [Mink].' "41 Spier speaks of Indians named respectively after Kmukampsh and Mink. "Both names," he states, "were given because their bearers are liars-which gives some insight into their idea of the tricksters."42 III It is obvious from the internal inconsistencies in Klamath mythology, in which the same phenomenon may be accounted for in several different ways, `s Gatschet, Klamath Indians, I, ciii. 39 There are some possible parallelisms in Klamath myths relating to the two beings. A frag- mentary reference by an informant seems to refer to a Coyote tale paralleling Kmukampsh and the bathing girls. Again, Gayton in "Areal Affiliations of California Folktales," American Anthropol- ogist, n.s., 37 (1935), 592, on the basis of Spier's unpublished collection of Klamath myths, refers to a tale in which "Coyote disguises himself as a baby and floats down a stream to intrigue women..." It may be, however, that the latter was locally collected as a Kmukampsh myth. 40 In one myth, Mink is replaced throughout by Kmukampsh (Gatschet, Klamath Indians, I, 107- 10o8). Present-day informants claim that this is clearly erroneous. 41 Gatschet, Klamath Indians, I, cll, 115 (109, 2, 6, 8). 42 Spier, op. cit., p. 6o.</page><page sequence="14">KLAMATH MYTHOLOGY 171 and in which the same character may appear, now in one role, now in an- other, that the component myths represent the results of historical accretion, of diffusion from adjacent areas, and that they form series that have tended to cluster about popular characters in the local mythology. The intimately reflexive relationship between the qualities developed for a given character and the myths in which he appears is a commonplace in folklore. Some roles which a character plays may possibly arise out of elabo- rations of some of the traits imputed to him. On the other hand, it appears that a popular character may attract to himself a number of tales not formerly within his cycle, and the resulting amalgam may then develop qualities not originally integral to him. A good example of this is Kmukampsh himself. It is evident that he belongs to a series of anthropomorphic deities extending from northwestern Cali- fornia north along the Oregon coast. Of the northwestern California deity, found among the Wiyot, the Hupa, the Yurok, and the Karok, Kroeber says: The stories almost universally told about him include among their chief inci- dents accounts of how he obtained by trickery salmon from the woman who was keeping them shut up; of how he first brought about birth, women having been previously killed at the birth of their children; of how he tried to kill his son by causing him to climb a tree, in order that he might obtain his wife; of how his son thereupon left the world for the one across the sea; and how he himself was finally carried off to the same place after having succumbed to the temptation of a woman who was a flat fish. This character is always represented as erotic and tricky, but does not show the other despicable qualities, such as gluttony and cowardice, usually attributed to Coyote, and often to the trickster in the mythologies of other tribes. A second culture-hero, who is more respected, is primarily a destroyer of evil beings; but in the common versions he has less part in the shaping of the world. A third character, whose function and importance vary considerably even in myths told by different individuals of the same tribe, is the dentalium shell. Occasionally this personage is raised to the rank of a creator. Coyote appears fairly frequently, but, although he sometimes destroys monsters, is usually of contempti- ble character.' As Gayton has since pointed out, the mythology of the northwest Cali- fornians-indeed, of the whole northern quarter of California-"aligns with the coastal and inland area of Oregon and Washington.""' Northward along the coast, the equivalent of the northwest California trickster, still anthropo- morphic, reappears. Among the Coos, he shows traces, in the motif of the 43 A. L.

For the Klamath, Kmukampsh would also seem to partake of the gradual approximation of the northwest California anthropomorphic deities to the full-fledged Coyote of the Plateau. It might be added that anthropomorphic tricksters crop up elsewhere in the West, as in the Old Man of the Blackfoot and Crow of the Plains." To the simple, Plateau-like Coyote character, other attributes have been combined in the Klamath trickster. In north central California, as Kroeber has pointed out, "cosmogonic beliefs revolve about a dualism, comprising a creator and an unstable assistant who sometimes mars and again supple- ments the work of his chief." Coyote, the assistant, "seems to have the older and deeper roots." The creator, best developed in north central California, is conceived as anthropomorphic-as Earthnamer among the Maidu-but to the north sinks to bestial level as Silver Fox among the Achomawi." Now, the Klamath myth of the creation marks an extension northward of the char- acteristic northern Californian tale. Silver Fox, so important in the Achomawi version, is also to be found in a prominent-though not a creative-role in Modoc mythology," but among the Klamath he is only distinguished as the companion of Aisis. In the Achomawi myth of the creation, Silver Fox and Coyote are adrift upon the waters in a canoe; when Silver Fox creates, he first makes Coyote cover himself with a blanket, apparently so that the act of creation will not be observed. In the Klamath version, it is Kmukampsh who is adrift alone; it is Gopher who first brings forth foods and it is Gopher who causes his companion to sleep while he rears the land.

The stress laid upon the unseemly deeds of an aged male is a matter of some interest. It will be recalled the Kmukampsh is also translated as "Old Man of the Ancients." The Yurok Wohpekumeu is "Widower-across-the-sea," and myths relating to other of the anthropomorphic tricksters present them likewise aged. Coyote is often called to scorn as a ridiculous old man, even as far away as among the Apache. (M. E.

Essentially, by about the time the Klamath are reached, the dualism of creator and marplot assistant of the northern California area has given way to a single individual, in whom both roles are combined. Thus it is that the Kmukampsh cycle-and it is no more than a loose aggregate of myths gathered around a major mythic character-combines a creation myth of north central Californian type with many tales proper to the anthropomorphic trickster-transformers of western Oregon and Coyote of the Plateau."2 There is little evidence today-although it is dangerous to be categorical-that these diverse tales were ever reconciled and molded to present a consistent picture of the hero. Instead, Kmukampsh remains an imperfect fusion of diverse qualities, an ambivalent Coyote type overlaid with more positive creator characteristics emanating from the north central Californian area. It may be said in summary that the plurality of tricksters in Klamath my- thology indicates the measure of popularity accorded to this type of character. At the same time, certain tricksters were preferred above their fellows. While it would be hazardous to attempt to explain the reasons why they were favored, it becomes evident that those best characterized, that is to say those which form the focuses of elaboration, are to a fair degree mutually distinct in con- ception. Thus, Mink-Weasel, Kmukampsh, and Skunk do not overlap sig- nificantly in characterization; as a corollary they achieve special popularity, with the result that about the first two at least loosely organized cycles have developed. On the other hand, those characters which stand too close to the popular ones in their attributes-for example, Coyote with relation to Kmu- kampsh-tend to receive but little attention, and accordingly occupy but a 51Maidu: R.
