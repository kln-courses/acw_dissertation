<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Testament of Faith. By P. G. S. HoP- wood. New York: The Macmillan Company, 1939. xiii + 215 pages. $2.00. This is an excellent, thoughtful, in the best sense popular philosophy of religion, the fourth book to appear in the "Great Issues of Life" Series edited by Rufus Jones. The latter quotes in his Intro- duction some words from near the close of the book which admirably express the gist of its message: "Religious experi- ence can stand on its own feet and look the universe in the face. It is no hybrid growth on the emotions, no beggar asking almis of the intellect, and no fungus on the healthy progress of the life urge. Reli- gious faith attests itself on the side of feel- ing, on the side of mind, and on the side of action. It gathers up these aspects of man's personality and unifies them into one harmonious development" (vii and 214). Hence, the title proposed by the editor, The Validity of Religious Experi- ence, describes, if not more accurately certainly much more clearly what the book really achieves.</page><page sequence="2">19391 BOOK REVIEWS 137 Is religious experience relevant to real- ity? Is it auto-suggestion or the result of wishful thinking? When it functions, is there a response from the other end? Is its analogy in a real telephone or a toy one? Is it an illusion but with great val- ue for the human race, as some think? These and many other similar questions that open stimulating discussions filled with keen criticisms, wholesome argu- ment, and spiritual insight make up the book. Along with many a happy phrase are, here and there, some hearty wallops for a type of popularizer short on facts, and particularly for the "new psycholo- gists." There is little that has not been said before. However, it is said not only well but also in such timely and thought- ful fashion as to prove very useful. But a few of these issues treated can be noticed here. Dr. Hopwood provides a good review of the theory of knowledge for the average reader, and refers to the literature from Kant to James, Dewey and Sorley. Many a college student believes the senses bring in knowledge but here Dawes Hicks is quoted: "Nor is it the ear that hears, but the mind is doing the hearing. The mind is no automatic reg- ister of facts presented by sense from the external world. It unifies, organizes, and interprets everything which enters through sense" (17). He discusses the role of mental constructions, space-time, change, and process in getting any notion of experience, and makes it clear there can be no experience without thought. And too, that this thought is never fur- nised with the experience. The author cites the capacity of the mind to discard the outmoded and inadequate, even when counter to its preferences, as evidence it is to be trusted. Religious experience, he insists, is to be treated much as other ex- perience, and our deepest religious insights are to be trusted as we trust "our deepest insights in all fields" (I5o). Refreshing criticism, under the theme of "Can We Gather Grapes of Thorns?" is given those who would explain the healthy and normal phases of the mental life by means of the abnormal. Too often psychology would explain health by dis- ease, and he cites an example or two of such "nonsense masquerading as knowl- edge" (49). "Whatever tends to promote the integration of personality has on it the stamp of reality" (52) and "an ex- perience which disintegrates is not of real- ity. It is not of God" (59) seem to distin- guish between the real and the unreal by whether it works. When the former is replaced by the latter "peace and power are replaced by frustration and futility" (57). He is aware that the abnormal may bring integration and has an explanation for it (59) but one wonders if it is so sim- ple as that. However, he makes his point that "the neurosis theory breaks down on the significant fact that religious experi- ence in its true form brings integration and harmony, and releases resources of living energy which builds up the self" (58). To this neurosis view he directs a bit of sarcastic humor: Jesus "was so completely neurotic himself that he was able to restore those who were neurotic !" Some psychologists believe God is but a projection of the needs, hopes, and fears of man, that when men see God they see, per- haps, themselves. He has been pictured as a projection of sex love or the "Father- Complex." God is "nothing but" a pro- duct of human fantasy. Dr. HopWood might have paid his respects to the "nothing but" fallacy but devoted his attention to what the critics more consciously had in mind. God is only a mental construct! But why deny it ? So it is with all experience, he reasons, "for projection covers the whole field of life" (40). The important question is, does the projection hit anything as it is pro- jected ? That psychology cannot answer. It lifts a ghost it cannot lay.

"The idea of the uni- verse as a gigantic machine is another pure anthropomorphism. Man projects onto the universe what he knows about a machine, but no one supposes that science is invalid because of this. It gets out of its depth because it does not push its anthropomor- phisms far enough, for it has yet to discover a machine that designed itself, runs itself, stokes itself, renews spare parts when needed, and never has to stop that repairs may be made" (2oo). What is the ultimate validity? Fruits? No, attractive as this is. "The mistake of the pragmatic school is to suppose that the will is the only ground of validity, whereas it provides only one pathway to reality." He sees the need these pragmatic tests have of the rational. It is the need of a religious belief like that of immortality which seems highly useful to some while quite useless to others (169). The ultimate test is in the personal, the non-physical even more than the physical. If the scientist analyses the brain into atoms, on whose nature he no longer has anything but pointer readings, he gets no trace of thought. Where is it? Somewhere else than in a collocation of atoms. These he must see against a non- physical background, which has something in it that analyses the brain. "Without the thought background of which I am consci- ous I should never know that I had a brain" (181). The last chapter, particularly the last fifteen pages, is an argument for Personalism as a philosophy of religion. Implicitly, at least, that goes for much of the book. "Like life and religion, we can recognise personality but find it difficult to define. . . . Personality means the richest, the most definite and most progressive type of living unity we know" (207). This is a book that merits the careful reading of serious students of religion, touching, as it does, many of the vital relig- ious issues of our day. IRWIN R.
