<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pascal Acot, ed., The European Origins of Scientific Ecology (1800-1901), intro. by Patrick Blandin, trans. by B. P. Hamm (Amsterdam: Editions des archives contemporaines, 1998), xx + 932 pp., $150.00, $55.00 paper. Despite appearing to the casual observer as an integrated discipline orga- nized around a few simple concepts, ecology is a highly synthetic science assembled over the past century from many disparate parts. Although this assemblage has become technically much more sophisticated and methodologically many times more complex, ecology at the end of the twentieth century is little closer to achieving anything like conceptual or methodological unity than it was at the beginning. To some extent, this lack of unity is the result of the science's multiple points of origin, but an equally important factor is the considerable leeway in interpretation to be expected from a discipline whose subject matter is interrelationships. In any event, the absence of consensus is not necessarily a sign of failure but may be the result of success, or rather many small successes, in constructing separate explanatory schemes and sampling procedures that cover a staggering array of natural phenomena. One of the central values of this new collection of facsimiles of nineteenth-century European works is that it acknowledges the diverse origins of the science and the plurality of explanations and interpreta- tions. Here we have assembled in two volumes: phytogeographical essays by Alexander von Humboldt, Augustin-Pyramus and Alphonse de Candolle and August Grisebach; works on vegetable physiology by Justus von Liebig and</page><page sequence="2">406 BOOK REVIEWS Jean-Baptiste Boussingault; an excerpt by Sergei Winogradski on soil micro- biology; geographical essays by Karl Ritter, Elisee Reclus, and Friedrich Ratzel; Karl Mobius's classic treatise on oyster culture; a selection from pioneer limnologist Franqois-Alphonse Forel; and several selections by Ernst Haeckel; not to mention Erasmus Darwin on the biological control of plant diseases, Charles Darwin on the struggle for existence, and Charles Lyell on the significance of migration and invasion. This is an eclectic collection, to say the least, but a valuable one, especially since most of the original sources are difficult or impossible to find in many libraries. There is certainly merit in assembling together such a broad range of works in their original languages and original typefaces. The reproduc- tions are of good quality considering that they were based on photocopies, although it is regrettable that Humboldt's illustration of montane vegeta- tion zones is missing, especially since Jean-Marc Drouin rightly refers to it as "superb" in his introductory remarks. A paragraph summary in English precedes each selection, and a few of the selections are accompanied by translations from the same period in English, German, or French. In addition to Patrick Blandin's general introduction, there are brief introductions for the six sections by Drouin, Pascal Acot, Marika Blondel-Megrelis, Patrick Matagne, Donato Bergandi, and Acot along with Gerhard Muller. Consistent with the science whose history they recount, there is no clear unity among these introductions, except that almost all of them point out the minimal influ- ence of Darwinism on early ecology. I believe this is a result of focusing too heavily on natural selection, which clearly never established a strong foothold in the nineteenth century, and not on Darwin's role in directing attention to details of both biotic and abiotic features of the natural environment. The introductions, in any case, are uneven in quality and tend to look forward to twentieth-century developments. The most interesting for me was Bergandi's treatment of the role of human geography in the origins of ecological science. As with all thematic collections, the nature of the ensemble is instructive in itself. Since ecology is essentially a twentieth-century science, despite Ernst Haeckel's coining of the word in 1866, this collection represents the prehistory of ecology or, if you will, the precursors to scientific ecology. In the forward Pascal Acot quickly dismisses such possible precursors as Aristotle, Linnaeus, and Buffon for their finalism, providentialism, and anthropomorphism, respectively. Historians agree, he states, that the proper place to begin is with Humboldt. Fair enough; one must start somewhere. He then adds, regarding the other works in the collection: "In order to avoid any ahistoric choices, the texts were selected based on their actual influ- ence on the scientific context of the epoch, not in light of what we know today, retrospectively, about the history of ecology" (p. xviii). Given that</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 407 ecology as such did not exist in the nineteenth century, there is little chance that such a criterion could be enforced. Needless to say, all the selections were included for their perceived relevance to twentieth-century ecology. Erasmus Darwin's piece is here simply as an example of what later came to be called "biological control." Verhulst's articles on the mathematical laws governing population growth are included not because of their relevance to the nineteenth-century debates over human population and economics but because of their rediscovery by twentieth-century population biologists. An obscure work by Dureau de al Malle is included because twentieth-century ecologists mistakenly credited him with suggesting an early version of the concept of ecological succession. Liebig is found here because twentieth- century ecologists make so many references to his law of the minimum; Boussingault, because his work contributed, ultimately, to our understanding of the nitrogren cycle. Despite his questionable impact on ecological science in the late nineteenth century, Ernst Haeckel gets the lion's share of selections - four of them, including two in multiple translations - mainly because he coined the word for the science. There are some curious omissions as well. Absent from this collection are selections by early nineteenth-century biogeo- graphers who do not fall easily into the Humboldt-de Candolle-Grisebach traditions, such as Edward Forbes, Hewett Watson, and Joakim Schouw, as well a later naturalists and biologists whose work combined elements of animal and plant physiology with studies of adaptation and geographical distribution - certainly Carl Semper and A. F. W. Schimper, but also Carl Bergmann, Moritz Wagner, Julien Vesque, Oscar Drude, Karl Goebel, Ernst Stahl, et al. It would be easy enough to extend this list, but the editors of any collection such as this must make difficult choices. While this two-volume set does not represent the last word on the nineteenth-century origins of ecological science, it certainly makes a valuable contribution to the source material in the history of ecology. Perhaps this example will encourage other collections organized around different sets of criteria. Eugene Cittadino</page></plain_text>
